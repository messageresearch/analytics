Description:
3) 54-1114  REDEMPTION.BY.JUDGMENT_  JEFFERSONVILLE.IN  SUNDAY_
«  E-43       †        Now, in the 19th Chapter, I believe it is here, of--of--of the Book of Exodus, God the Lord makes...
And the LORD spake unto Moses and... Aaron, saying,
This is an ordinance of law which the LORD hath commanded thee... Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me a red heifer without spot, wherein... no blemish, and upon which never came a yoke:

And ye shall give her to Eleazar the priest, and... he may bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:
And Eleazar the priest shall take... her blood with his finger, and shall sprinkle of the... blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times:

Oh, if you notice, red heifer. Notice, being the female, typing the church... Red, the color, had--couldn't be spotted now; it had to be a solid color. And red always gives a--a--a signifies redemption. You say, "Red always signifies danger." It does to us in a red light, but it's always redemption too; don't run it. So red is always been the sign through the Bible. The harlot Rahab let the spies down through a scarlet cloth or scarlet cord, which was a sign that God left her house standing .

«  E-44       †        Now, notice, red here, this red heifer was to be brought and was to be killed in the presence of Eleazar. And he was to take her, hoofs and all, and burn her. And before she--while she was dying, he took and dipped his fingers in her blood and sprinkled it to the tabernacle and dipped his fingers in the blood and sprinkled it towards the tabernacle and did this seven times, signifying the seven dispensations, or the seven church ages that the church would be sprinkled by the blood, that the judgment was placed upon the heifer. Seven times the blood was sprinkled: the blood sacrifice, making an atonement, standing in the stead of judgment seven times. Then the heifer was put into a fire and was burned up to a, ashes.

Then anyt...

gonna let Katie we're gonna start with the biggest and go to the smaller that's why everybody Savannah Kaylee is gonna come here and I'm gonna give her I'm gonna give her this one this one's anointed it releases doesn't been using it if you just go right ahead Louisiana camp when well we drove to Louisiana and at first we didn't go to the morning services because our hotel was literally an hour away so we just went to the evening services so the evening services were amazing I really like them I just they're amazing so Saturday nights have always been my favorite because they have the prayer line and I love the prayer line so as soon as you go in and start crying um all right uh I kind of just felt like it was amazing so because I liked it so much I went in twice and I don't think you're supposed to do that [Applause] but I went in anyways so the second time I went in it was a the same thing but a lot better so going into the prayer line I felt like st. Anne was telling me put your hands down don't lift them up but I just kept pushing lifting them up amen yes amen it's alright sorry okay so coming out of the first time then I felt like I should just go back in because God was like telling me that I needed this and I didn't want it to end because it was just so amazing so the first year that I went to camp I just couldn't stop crying and this year I couldn't stop crying for a longer time amen so I just believe that I kinda got something out of that and yeah yeah I just got like God just told me yes that I needed it and the devil couldn't do anything about it yeah that's right amen Navin thank you that's all she was shy who thought that girl was shot Olivia then asked her then my two brother bless you today I want to thank poppy and the church for letting me come to this camp third time this past three years and the first year I went I got baptized and I really got molested by that and it stuck with me all these years and this year was really different and it really changed me the first service that we had I held back and I did not go up for prayer and I really regret that but the second year I mean the second time the second service I went up for piyo and I'm so glad I did that the devil kept on telling me not to but I still did and I really got blessed by that and Saturday night is always the best because they have the power line work and so I was going through the pay line and I felt something lift me up it was amazing and I started screaming and jumping and then I fainted and I saw a light and I don't know how to describe it but it was truly amazing and I woke up and they were dragging me off the stage and I started skiing again and it was truly amazing and I really got blessed this year thank you Aven Esther why they're growing up one thing man they are growing up um first off I would like to thank brother and sister Dell for paying for this camp so that we could go first I was really when I first went to this camp I was expecting something I was like okay this year I know I'm going to get saved I don't I didn't know which one day it was but I just knew so the first few services before Saturday night I yeah I was like jumpy fired up I was praising God and stuff but there was just something holding me back like something was there and the devil was like saying you're not gonna get saved yeah he was just putting me down he was um yeah he was just telling me a bunch of stuff trying to get into my head and for a little bit I listened to him they know then the preacher made a really good point he said if you really didn't have Jesus and why would they bother bother like trying to tell you that she didn't have that so Saturday night was the prayer line so I was like okay I felt like tonight was the night so I went through the fare line and I was just like the devil tried to come to me again I was like you know what I don't care and go away there you go so hey so I just like going like God and I believe I really got saved this year go stop Thanks older fumbling going yeah I'd like to thank brother down the church for letting us go this year and I believe youth camps give kids in general all kids of all ages the opportunity to be in a godly atmosphere surrounded by other message believers and Christians and it's really an opportunity to let God work in your life yeah and but the Danny steamin brother Andrew did an amazing job and showing God in every verse every sermon was a gift and it was different each time and one thing brother Tim says at the camp that stood out to me was to always come expecting and every service come expecting that's right whether you're young whether old or whether at your home your church you're a youth camp always come expecting because if you come expecting God will show up and if you need them to heal you he'll be your healer and if you need him to save you he'll be your Savior no matter the circumstances hey that stood out to me and how can I and how I can apply that to my life and I believe in all our lives thank you [Applause] nice shirt you got on everybody okay so um first off I would also like to thank brother and sister Dale for allowing us to have this experience at this you camp and I want to start off my testimony by saying that before camp I was dealing with a lot I was struggling with a lot having to do with them the message and deciding on whether it was true or not and mainly because because of that that struggle that I was dealing with I had some friends that I used to be in the message and they went out in the world and they were trying to convince me that this message wasn't true and that brother Brendan was a false prophet and they were using a lot of that information from the internet and using that you know to kind of battle against me and what I believed and it was really it was a big struggle for me and I was really trying to decide what to believe and I really wasn't sure so on the way to camp I was just kind of really battling that in my mind and when I got to camp out I was really praying like God please reveal this to me because I just want another the truth I just need to know the truth and um so the first few services were really good they answered a lot of my questions actually named but by the end of the camp all my questions I'd been answered every last one and when I went through the prayer line when I got to the the start of the prayer line I felt like the devil was really battling me and I know he was battling everyone it was it was real struggle for everyone but um when I got there I wanted to turn around and I was like I don't know if I can I don't know if I can do this you know but I just pushed through and I went through the prayer line and lifted my hands up and I I felt a presence there I know the angel of the Lord was there and a lot of my friends and other young people were there they said the same thing that they know that angel of the Lord was right there guiding everyone through the prayer line and I really felt that presence and after I went through the prayer line I walked to the back of the church and I was just kind of meditating on God and I looked up and I actually saw the pillar of fire at the end of the prayer line I saw it up above the prayer line it was like an orb I looked at it and it flew behind me and disappeared and I'm really thankful that God let me experience that and something that I'll never forget and it was like a clarification to me that there's no way anyone can tell me that this message isn't true this is this is the truth and this is what it's going to take us in the rapture and I'm really thankful for it and I want to thank the church and everybody for letting us experience this camp and thank you that's all Fame gettin while attender because the devil done started before you get there yeah you notice they always said that right before the wedding the prayer line the devil said something he's usually the first one standing in the prayer line but we know one that's more powerful graters he is in us and he's in the world thank God for all those brothers like brother Danny and all them their brother Andrew Glover the give of their time and give her their heart for the for the use of this of this message so thank God kids you got us to support poor Lucy whatever you need we're here to support you we we didn't just go from zero age to 58 we went through the same things you went through demons might have different names but it was the same demon the same devil so you have our full support of everything that that we need to do so let's let's turn now into revelation 6 and get started for just a little bit kind of review where we were at this morning and then continue on what we were talking about so revelation 6 we're gonna read 1 through 4 so let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you today Lord you've give us another chance to come and be in your house to worship you in spirit and truth and to hear that you're not dead you're alive you're alive in the youth you're alive in the child you're alive in the older generation all of us Lord you take care of every one of us Lord you are an ever-present help in the time of trouble you said you'd be there when no one else would be father you've given our youth of this church you good workgroup to to be someone they can come to and and speak to so lord I pray that that you would minister to these young children also in the time that we're here and that we would not do anything to hinder their walk with God that we'll all be as brother Dale says when you dedicate the baby in this church you did it this whole church dedicates that baby we all are commissioned to live before it so that it can be raised in the admonition of God forgive us of our sins Lord that we do make against you Lord all the things that are going through our mind of the world and the things of the world and Lord we pray that you just now settle us for just a little while longer Lord this day and you be the speaker Lord you'd be the one that does the revealing you'd be the one that does the manifestation be the revealer of the word Lord people with each one that's here Lord be with ones that are sick all the prayer requests that we've heard and the ones that are in all of our hearts Lord we pray that you would minister to each one probably give us this day our daily bread give them ministry Lord the the missionaries give them fruit for their labor Lord as they labor in the fields Lord to bless them and take care of them we ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen revelation 6:1 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and heard it was the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see I saw him behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him he went forth conquering and to conquer we've covered that already now we're on the second seal and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast which was what the Ox say come and see and there went out another horse that was read now this is another horse but the same rider and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword and you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word Lewis when Lewis was talking Wednesday night you know he was talking about a war he was talking about a battle a spiritual battle amen because the kingdom of God is taken by force Satan is going to use all his junk again just why not use a little bit back God give us a two-edged sword and it's the Word of God it's not something that Satan concocted or somebody concocted and it's going to go away no this word that we got is always eternal never will change the poor oh the poor old Mormon Bibles changed five or six hundred times this has been written how in the world are you going to put set your life on something that's change that mean time but it has not changed this Bible Lord has been written since the foundation of the world it was in the mind of God and it was made manifest in words that we can read so if you know what God said just open Bible read what he said that's what he said is it he didn't say nothing else this is exactly what he said so in this seal that we're talking about today for just for a background we now we were talking this morning if you'll bring up the part about Redemption we're going to fly through these first ones and then we'll get into the what we want to talk about but we now change to another to another horse rider wake up back then another horse rider thank you all right they're just having a shuffle around a little bit like that that's okay but we're still coming plan of redemption we're still talking about the plan of redemption for the breaking of the seals is not necessarily for the soul we'll keep reading this because I want you to understand that that the soul is redeemed by the new birth the shed blood of Jesus Christ at Calvary but this will bring full fellowship back in the manifestation you and I what we have you have to have it in your heart to be closer to God it has to be a desire in your heart to know more about the Creator it has to be a desire in your heart to know about the guy that took you from a miry pit like we were talking about the the the glass picked you up now listen if God picks you up remember God doesn't do Gaza to do like us you know we may walk by and go I think I'll pick that up I don't want to use that only you something else God's not that way once he reaches and picks you up or picked that glass up he was going to do something with it him anyone just going to put it on a shelf so same way with you if he's picked you up today he's gonna use you for something hey man I think sometimes we do think well I think you know God God picked me up but I don't know what he's gonna do with it he knows exactly what he's gonna do with you what we have to do though is yield ourselves to that yield ourselves to what God's wanting for us in this end time because he you have to be specific for your day Leuchars new birth it's not the same it's the same new birth but it's not that is if we the just shall live by faith now if we just believe that we could all go down to bustering days and have a beer and eat some hot wings and watch television no really I mean that's but now that's not our day right amen why we have moved up God has moved us to a higher plane to where now we know that has to be done away with no more that no more drinking smoking gambling cutters why I said every one of us in this room today if you're born again under the message of this hour you're a so special group of people and it's what God said no I'm trying I'm not trying to build you up yeah I'm trying to help your faith but I shouldn't have to be you know God doesn't need cheerleaders he's God he can handle it himself hey man because remember he's got to be specific to you they meant you you and God together as persons there in the walk that you have amen but it will bring full fellowship it will bring when since I've been looking at these things a little bit more you know what it does it makes you it's kind of like when we first started him in school and we were we were working on our like Deanna's not here today but she was here this morning 2 plus 2 is 4 2 plus 2 is 4 2 plus 2 is 4 2 plus 2 is 4 then you move then you know yeah that would be kind of it would be real mundane to be in the 8th grade and the teacher go out now today we're gonna learn 2 plus 2 is 4 and you're gonna go man I learned that back but if you had to bet for what you had back there right but see you want more you want the calculus 2 trigonometry I wanted and I wanted to get into some things that it challenged you a little bit and I think that's what God wants to do God wants to take us in the word and challenge us he's already said it he's not going to change we're the ones just gotta change he's not going to change listen there will be a bride that takes a rapture there will be a bride that takes a body change I'm just gonna believe that I am one of them amen because there's no word in the word he'll ever tell you you clean nowhere nowhere in the Bible he's gonna say now you're just not gonna make it now there's a group that won't make it because they decided they wasn't gonna make it amen but there is a group there they decided they was going to make it and they made it because you and I are standing here today with the fullness of the word the fullness of redemption my Martin Luther would have loved to be sitting here today not just to hear me but to but to hear the message of the hour and tape man you know what if I was Martin Luther I'd if I was listening to brother Ram I say I'm glad that prophet mentioned my name I'm glad he mentioned my name a lot cuz I was part of the plan I was part of the plan of God all these men are parts sure their heads of the church are there seven stars but they they would have been nothing without the people they would have been nothing without the congregation most of the people in these ages Columba died Columba died before they started somewhere in there one of them did but what happened somebody picked up his message they picked up Paul's message and because Paul died right here in the first part of the church age 80 50 something and he died in whatever was a little bit after that but what happened was somebody hey they didn't even have recorders they had to go by what John was preaching because John was the last one to die he was you know went up into the 1890s then he was the last one they said John what did Paul say John said I tell you what Paul said I tell you what I saw over there in Revelation and you know what those people believed there why cuz they had the whole ego the Holy Ghost will always lead you to the word not sure there's gonna be times he's gonna go more in the world did that come from but you just wait a while that Potter he starts and we got a pottery place right across the road that's one of my first jobs he's starting and he was a master Potter but you know why sometimes he starts that pot and it start wobbling you know what do you do he didn't throw it away he just pushed him back down put a little more water of the word put a little more water on it flipped it over and you know what pretty little strawberry jar about that high put the lip on it and that's the way God did with you but I remember he didn't make a mistake in making you our problem is we get a little wobbly we get a little too much of this and a little too much of that but once everything is perfect it's been putting that kill and you can't change it either once it's made made you can't change it same way with you and I once you're born again you're born again once you've come up this statue of a perfect man listen what would be a father that would give you these things and then take them away from you no no no he wants to enhance what you have he wants to take what he's already taught and say that's my child he's listening he's learning so the breaking of the seals is not necessarily for the soul but what I've just been talking about full fellowship back to where Adam had no problem walking in front of God we should come boldly to the throne now remember what we were talking about with the example of the Holy of Holies you know you got your Holy of Holies and you got you out of court well let's go in here out of court and then you got an inner Court where the candlesticks were then you got the Holy of Holies one man goes in there talks to God there weren't a whole bunch of people in there right now there was a lot of people out here and some of the priests could go in here remember even David went in here Nate some of the shewbread but he didn't eat tasty bread in that holy holy he'd have been a dead fella because why because God said only the high free so the high priest would go in well now what would the high priests do when they're by South but when he got finished he come out when you get born again you don't just get I wished I wish you could get tucked away with garden and nothing else bother you I wish we could go into what they call a Holy of Holies brother brining and everything it will just wait yeah well don't worry in the Millennium even here when we get a body change but in the Millennium it's all gonna be just like the Holy of Holies all the time but right now we had to walk he had to walk back out and go again he had to walk listen the high priests had to go through here to get to the holy Holies the next year he had to go through the same thing hey man same thing with you and I you got to go through I die daily being born again being justified freely going through here now we're in this second court or sanctification and that's what we're talking about today excuse my voice but let's go to the next skip that down to number two just a kind of background this morning we were reading this and I want to read it again now remember this is for sister Jeanne said she wasn't here this morning yeah I'm picking on you now told you I would but remember but remember this is the seal this is the seal that had all this sealed up once our brother Brian said now when we go through breaking these seals you're gonna see it goes phlegm back in the scripture we're going to read something a little while all the way back for each one of those seals the whole thing together the whole mystery lives right here in these seals see every mystery of the Bible lays in these seals and the seals cannot be broken until that time I'm proving here in a minute notice now the book remember is sealed here's one that one fellow here's one another one's wrapped a seal you know this was like a book we already explained this but just a little bit more okay somebody chimed in on the internet this is the way a book looked back then the book didn't look like this this was a scroll it was an unrolling of a piece of paper it's a book of redemption and the whole thing together makes the book and it's sealed with seven seals so it's got a seal on it being it's on the back side it's called just wound up so since wound up the seal mystery is on the inside and it only says the wild horse rider black horse rider what you talking about this what had it sealed this but once that seals broke you can read what God's got inside of it this is the important part amen the Diploma is really not the house to finish school it shows you finish school but they're not gonna give you a diploma if you never step your foot in in a college before so what's important that grade 1 to 12 all the time you put and all the effort and all the tests you took hello all attached you took then you get a diploma which says you finished the course and please it don't let it be a death certificate hey man don't let it be a death certificate only the one that says you went from death unto life a man from Genesis to Revelation a complete plan of redemption is revealed in these seven seals so that's what we're talking about we're talking with a revelation of complete redemption in these seals god help us to get it all right let's go remember the seals I told you this morning the seals done this it shows the redemption of the Jews to Gentiles the world and the defeat of Satan so I like this it's the defeat of Satan this he's done and he's finished and then y'all ought to be happy about that this guy he torments me I don't know about y'all must go home different nothing hey torments me always run kids I'm telling you that's his job and he's good at his job but we got a god this better at his job we got a god that's now in human flesh rat around you able to help you show you the way the truth in the life you show that's Jesus I know that the words yeah he's still hanging on the cross he still got that Roman seal I was so much this morning I like that cuz when that Roman went right here before this first Church has happened Rome put a seal brother Larry on a tomb a Roman seal they sealed it with wax in the Roman seal and when God broke the seal Rome still said now they just come in and stole his body so the first lay that Roman Rome right there to me is the first life they never meant anything they lied about that and got a whole group of people to lie with them Oh Satan is a liar but when Peter stood on the day of Pentecost oh praise the Lord when Peter stone their pen coughs he said I don't have to see that to me yeah I know it's empty cause it didn't me he poured itself inside of us starting on the day of Pentecost till the day you got born again he broke that self Satan had on you and then he put his eternal seal what kind of Roman seal could keep God in a tomb I don't think Jesus had to do this let me get that stone off hopefully no you know what the Angels angel just said move let my let my guard out move and that thing just wept no effort nobody grunted on the day of the resurrection it was just and Jesus probably looks at the angel said thank you I may need you later and then walk thrown out hey man so that was God in human flesh he had a glorified body amen you think I'm crazy remember what happened at the when Jesus went into the wilderness you remember what the Bible said when he came out of the wilderness he said angels angels comforted him ministered to him amen so let's don't go so far while just when I said that your eyes get crossed don't you think God had a Jesus that angels all around him you know what and they knew who he was this dumb humans didn't like Tony's the devil and angels are over in another dimension going that what where's Bob Bob's in the back what this guy's nothing but God himself the Bible even tells you that the devil believes and Oh God and trembles but he started riding in this age going come on change that I'm gonna make him bleed free when I can only see one myself what it's Sivir all right review we reviewed the wild horse the Roman seal all right let's keep going cuz I'm only going down through here we talked about Daniel you can't possibly hit all the things because it could take just one of those seals and stay just bring it right through the scripture right now see it takes months and months it's just had us to we had we had ten services on first seal now we won't have them in any on second because I told you had to have a foundation but and that first Hill is very important what it does it turns your mind and tastes like I said before it takes that womb of your mind and it it totally changes the way you're thinking because the wait listen people the way everybody thinks listen and part of it most of the people in the message that that seal was the revelation of the wild horse rider and that's it that's it we should have a rapture and nothing said keep late hey man there's something that we've got to have that's never been known before you show all that makes you special yeah I didn't say that he did the property God stood on the sixth seal he said you're not getting it he said it's not even for you and I don't think any of us were there but he said somebody's gonna get it because he's talking about that little crystal that little diamond that when he changed the when he changed the radio station it would hit that crystal and once it hit that crystal sea it'd be a sound that we would hear that nobody else would hear it's a sound that nobody else would hear listen this is foreign even the most people in the message this is so foreign how do you mean the white horse riders the Antichrist in US and that's all that and that's not all there is to it it's not that just opened it up so you can see the rest of it that just opened up the revelation of one God cuz that's what they had the first church age see it took months and months and months you still wouldn't have it cuz the seal itself times the entire scripture from Genesis to Revelation one sale all right let's go to the next one real quick the sixth seal now the earthquake let's compare scriptures now I won't have you got pence on paper with you I want to do something for you for writing down okay anyway I want you to read with me as you do compare scripture of this great event I want you to understand something what happened the winds did not and what happened on Thursday morning I believe was of God what brother Lewis preached on Wednesday night Thursday morning a 5.3 earthquake hit California off the coast not inside off the coast and she's supposed to slide off into the ocean the great earthquake will happen I promise you when we come to a place cuz we're not gonna be here very long after that amen one way the other anyway you want to look at it you know there's doctrines if it's gonna be the resurrect it doesn't matter it doesn't matter you think we're gonna die if we gonna get a body change no listen we can come right if we if we're elect to get have a body change and come to a place an atomic bomb under my chair and don't stop it Oh Tomic bombs everybody goes haywire you say atomic out in the world what's the first thing they do oh Lord I hope they don't drop a bomb on you know what I'm satisfied that the Prophet told us there won't one bomb hit this earth till we're gone so I ain't gonna worry about it dirty bomb whatever bomb any atomic bomb I'm telling you brother branham give us many many keys that should be settled we should not be nervous about this thing don't worry about China North Korea what America's gonna do don't worry about that worry about what's happening in your country because this is what country you can change you can't change that country out there I want you to read with me as you do compare Scripture this great event that we will see that this great secret of mystery that was under the sixth seal of the book of redemption now remember these are hidden mysteries in the sixth seal all together is one great big book you say he keeps saying sixth seal it's got to be seven hold on a minute just say Scrolls rolled together and otherwise the whole book of redemption that's how the Old Earth whole earth was redeemed because remember the seventh seal has no it has no scene there silence in heaven for this place might have an hour there's nothing written and why did Jesus come up in Matthew 24 and just preach sick sail you know what he was doing he was preaching and then at the end he went to Israel but at the end he stopped just for a minute but they wasn't nobody there to get it there wasn't nobody there to get it but he said I've expect to you are the thunder that you're missing I am he that will redeem your body now you say where's that in the Bible I think I read it in that little love letter part that God told us to read because Jesus told to me see watch this watch this was this was this nice top he preached 73 16 because sick sales finishes Redemption just like we said this morning the six fold purpose puts Israel in the Millennium the six seals puts us in the Millennium that's just as easy as you can make it right there amen Daniel 9:24 say if seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and the holy city so there's two things we're looking at here to finish the transgression make an end of sins make a reconciliation for iniquity bringing everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy don't know what the most holy that's six things alright then what happens when brother brown said the north the most holy is when we come back in the Millenium cuz we're the most holy a man only prophet could tell us that a man so who's who is with us I'm sorry who do we come with who do we come with right at the end of the six seals Christ comes on the scene at the end of the six fold purpose Christ comes on the scene takes us all in the Millennium then all right say man now what is this break it again pull it up the next one excuse me six fold purpose to finish the transgression to finish what to finish Israel's transgression what is the transgression it's to go against something that we're back on the first seal so this is all this country stuff a transgress against me is to do it wrong to me remember they transgressed against God they told economy's bill Zebub all right transgress against uses their own to you so Israel did it wrong to God and in this 70th week what's going to happen God is going to finish the transgression of Israel God is going to finish our transgression Hey look when God finishes something it's done amen that's why I was telling you when god finishes something he doesn't say oh well let me back up I gotta know he knew God never backs up God never makes a he never has a moment never sinned hoops Amen told Esther was in the eternal thought and it's expressed so he cannot make a mistake finish the transgression will be turning away the ungodliness from Jacob and then all Israel will be born again all of them will receive the Holy Ghost that's through the two prophets right now the next one is to make an end of sins and we'll get to that next Sunday so now let's go to the seal that's where we were at this morning right here when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see and they went out another horse it was red now we got to deal with red we've dealt with white we've dealt with a white righteous church that was on the earth and we dealt with a white imposter amen contrast and power was given to him that sat there own to take peace from the earth and they should kill one another pretty bloody scene and there was given unto him a great sword all right he'd have their story it was a bluff back here and then we read through the church and we read through the Book of Revelations we're not gonna read it again but now we come to this excuse me this fourth church age now this fourth Church age started in 606 and lasted to 1520 during that time the Crusades were from 1095 to 1291 the Pope called for the liberation of Christians during that time now what we were talking about remember we read and I got this we're brother Branham I'll read it right here it's not up here something I'm gonna read it I'll read it next Sunday do you know what five Tyrel means dominating female that's why that that scripture says you have to Jezebel's doctrine and you've made it the truth and they put a pope the head over it and we'll read it this next Sunday but he says look it was also in this church age that the false church defied the first commandment and broke the second commandment remember the commandments of the seals we put them right here what was the second commandment you'll have no other I don't pull up an idol and all that stuff right that's what brother Brown said I'll read it right here next Sunday well I got ahead of myself I thought that was really good for us to keep like I said this thing just keeps on folding and folding and unfolding but we got to get the gist of this whole thing so go to the next one Matthew 24 Jesus said and you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see remember what Lois was preaching of I was rejoicing Wednesday night here he comes up and God said Jesus said you gotta take this kingdom by force a war you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you be not in trouble for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet so now we've come up to a red horse power was given to take piece and kill and he was given the great sword and we know that that parallels the fourth Church age just like we read this morning revelations 2 and 20 talking about he went from a deed to a doctrine and now in this church age just like we showed you that there was a seven churches in the Old Testament the Dark Age the middle church age in the Old Testament was when what Jezebel and Ahab married church and state married together right amen so that's why he said he says you in other words you're letting this doctrine of this dominating female take over this woman Jezebel your your what does it say let's read it it says what are you doing in other words it said you're letting her in your church a woman's not supposed to hurt some authority over a man a man that all right I mean staying you but yeah that's what it says they're lettin Jezebel or Sabbath or T over what Christ they changing doctrines verse 18 to 18 and to the angel of the church in Thyatira these things say it's the Son of God so it's coming straight from Almighty who liked his eyes under light a flame of fire and his feet like fine brass I know thy works and charity and service and faith and patience and works last to be more than the first notwithstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest there it is thou sufferest that woman Jezebel you're letting her in the church you're letting the false woman take over listen though we are the bride of Jesus Christ but we are the greatest thing since God walked on the face of the earth we're not number one God is the head Jesus Christ is our husband now what he says about me he's gotta back up amen what he said if he says that I am the same as him but I won't let him say that me I'll get in trouble cuz that's what the problem is satan is over here going i think i won't be like that i think i'll try to i think i'll try to entice them in with all with a beautiful woman remember john admired that thinning a man john admired it it was beautiful but that angel said hey John that's not where you want to go right but they suffered that woman Jezebel in other words a letter in the church which calls herself a prophetess to teach and seduce my servants to commit fornication of the ething sacrifice an idol I give her space to repent and she repented not behold I will cast her into a bed and then that commit adultery with her her daughter's denominational ideas they meant remember that that's what the Prophet told us that the had daughters in the daughters was the denominational churches because they are going to go through the Great Tribulation and I'm not saying they're not going to get to go to heaven but they go have to stand and give an account for their works so he's going to throw in the great - why would you say well they don't throw the great tribulation see that they're out of here now they could be given eternal life except they repent of their deeds I just don't want to stand before any judgment with my works I don't care how pure I am I don't care how righteous God said I was but when God tells me I'm righteous that moves me over into another place if I move myself over here guess what I'm gonna carry with me my works but when I move over when God says you come over here because your works are gone you're gonna be judged by my words I'm gonna say okay Lord that's just like the wife being submissive to the husband okay whatever you say Lord and I will kill her children with death what not natural death spiritual death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the reins in the heart and I give unto every one of you according to your works there it is again but until you I say into the rest of thought IRA now remember it's dominating female as many as have not this doctrine in which have not known the depths of Satan as they speak I will put upon you none of the burden just to be a Christian during that time you were completely utterly destroyed dead naturally dying amen but that which you have already hold fast till I come here overcometh and keepeth my worst of the end him will I give power over the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of Potter shall be broken to shivers even as I received in my father and I will give him the morning star amen so they're not going to be lost they're a great powerful church sitting in a dimension waiting on me and you amen wait no man you ever they're all waiting no men you to do what not to say well gods give us a lot more than you guys so y'all can stay in there for a while no we're our pulls should be getting them out of there the pull should be I don't want any more death to happen I don't want to go to a funeral no more amen so let's look at sanctification under this seal real quick just for a second because remember the first one would be justification the second because what I'll let listen I'll let the Prophet I came to spill sanctification I'll let the Prophet tell you no don't let him tell you this so let's go to numbers 19 verse 1 mm-hmm pick this up because I thought this was great because look Satan was there when that was written when the Bible was written Satan was standing right there okay he said they're gonna have to have a red heifer why is it red well if they're gonna have a red heifer I'm just gonna get me a rental hey sometimes it scares me that I think the same way the devil does but me wasn't wise read why is he going a white one and then a red one and then a why didn't you stay on one he's deceiving yes God moves so does Satan so God said I'm gonna give him a red heifer then I'll show you in a minute we're brother Branham talks about Redemption so Satan is going to give them a red horse think it there okay I mean what would you think listen let's put our self right here coming out of all this and then what happens with Constantine and all that church estate comes together and then they got this one guy that I'll read you next Sunday I think I still got it we're even in the history that when they made the Pope and fallible well man when you make the Pope infallible but now there's a nominal I want to say this derogatory but a peasant that's poor in the street and when they put church and state together they start elevating huh they start elevating the economy making things look better giving them programs letting them eat better I I saw a movie one time where they were and it was a documentary about Al Capone you know Al Capone was a murderer a thief a liar or a monk I mean listen but during the Depression the way he made his money is he got all of the bums in New York brought him into a place and fed him everyone fed him every day he got that group of people to like him so much until they started talking and they said oh I'll Capone's the greatest thing everyone's he feeds us he's put clothes on us and then it kind of goes out that's Matt was what made him untouchable that's what made him untouchable for all them years they got him on all kind of charges but he brought the poor people in that's what the Pope did the Pope Constantino that they brought them poor people in and they give them something to eat they put him in a church program sneaky I'm not against Church programs I'm just telling you how Satan works he's shrewd like Louie said go back to that the kingdom of God is taken by force not by flattery I thought flattery was the devil you never here nowhere in the Bible where God said I'm gonna work a little flattery here no he said Satan works flattery amen this is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded saying speaking to the children of Israel that they bring the red heifer without spot wherein there's no blemish and probably brother Brian can tell you more about that but he's only can be so many haters right so many hairs that can be a different color and from what I hear is going on now they're trying to genetically modify that red heifer here in the United States to make it where there's no no hairs their white swearing there's no blemish go see that's what Israel Israel it doesn't listen Israel that doesn't think Jesus is here come and go back again they're trying to bring the Messiah they're trying they're not they're not like brother Ram said they're serious but they could be seriously wrong amen but they're trying they got to get that red heifer because why watch what happens a red heifer without spot wearing there's no blemish and upon which never came a yoke I'll tell you what the Prophet said about all this in a minute and he's so given her give her until he Eleazar the priest that he may bring her forth without the camp and one shall slay her before his face and the eyes are the priest shall take her blood red with his finger and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times and one shall burn the heifer in her sight and her skin or flesh her blood with her don't shell he burned and the priests know the priest shall take cedar wood hyssop and scarlet and cast it into the midst of the burning of the effort then the priest shall wash his clothes and he shall bathe his flesh in water and afterwards he shall come into the camp and the priest shall be unclean until the evening time because in the evening time he's considered CLE that's what I'm reading and he that burn is Herschel watch this closing water bathe his flesh and water and shall be unclean until and a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and lay them without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation it is a purification for sin they can't go in because that purification began first they had to have that water of separation as a perfect purification for sin and what is sanctification cleaned clean and set aside outside the camp for service that all right say ma'am okay everybody got that judgment by Redemption 1954 this is what the prophet of God said about it now the nineteenth chapter I believe book of Exodus the Lord God makes the Lord God spoken to Moses and Aaron saying this is an ordinance of law which the LORD hath commanded thee speaking of the children of Israel that they bring me a red heifer without spot wherein no blemish and upon which never came a yoke you shall give her till he aids are the priests and he may bring her forth without the camp and once she lay her before his face and Eleazar the police priests shall take her blood with his finger and sprinkle of the blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times now watch because remember we're talking about a red horse so Satan had to have something to copy and then remember the law of contrast if Satan had something that was white I mean if God had something that was white a white righteous church was on the earth when the white horse rider rode out then it had to be a red there had to be something signify that read for him to use that red-colored of rides because remember he's not an originator he's a copycat all right he's a copycat what about that you know even us as human beings have original thoughts we have original thought Satan never had an original thought he's a copycat he waits for God to do something there's a name for that oh if you know this redheffer know this is what the Prophet says about it being the female type in the church because remember all your other offerings had to be around had to be a male of the first year had to be this had to be a male there's only one other offering tell me what it is there's only one other offering that you can offer a she-goat there is an ignorance offering that Abraham he told Abraham there is a she-goat to offer for an offering of ignorance and I say I love that because you know what I'll kill him she goes all the time okay why God that wasn't funny but it was I mean I do it was for an ignorance offering if somebody done something out of the ignorance they offered her she go but now here you've got a female a red heifer a heifer - what a cow right notice being the female topping the church red the color couldn't be spotted now it had to be solid so this red horse couldn't be spotted that Satan's riding on it had to be red all right now had to be a solid color and red always gives us signifies what if we ever heard that word before redemption you say red always signifies danger it does to us in the red light but it's always Redemption - don't run it so red has always been the signal through the Bible the harlot Rahab let the spider to a start scarlet cloth or scarlet court which was a sign of God left her house standing now notice here this red heifer was to be brought Hilde in the presence of Eleazar he was to take her hoofs and all burner before she while she was dying he took him dipped his finger in her blood and sprinkled it to the tabernacle and dipped his fingers in the blood and sprinkled it toward the tabernacle and did this seven times signifying the seven dispensation or seven Church ages amen towards redemption to all 7 Church ages are the seven churches that the church would be sprinkled by the blood that the judgment was placed upon the heifer seven times the blood was sprinkled the blood sacrifice making an atonement standing instead of judgment seven times then the heifer was put in the fire was burned up ashes than anything that Israel it made a what they call the waters of separation now watch this right here now you talk about fit right into what we're talking about and there was burned scarlet scarlet hyssop and was put together and burnt which meant the dispensation of what grace justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost through cedar hyssop and scarlet and was all burnt together hey man that's a good quote I like that one look at number four fellowship 1955 positionally place yourself now for tonight get under the blood all these things that's in your heart get them out go before God under the blood confession your wrongs and call and make it right help me Moses got an answer to prayer right away because he went to God what God's Way under the blood for he could have fellowship he went in under the blood now notice the lamb was slain back in the Old Testament they had a red heifer told Moses when they started this journey saying they'll make a provision listen God knew that that sacrifice those sacrifices could not make those people clean we read it last night there's no way if it'll made them clean I read you the quote last night if Caiaphas killing a lamb and sprinkling the blood you know the once a year atonement if that was all I needed then eternity with it said you the eternal life would be right there and it wouldn't have no use to going anywhere else but the Bible says every year he had to go in to do the same thing every year but Christ never had to get on a cross again that's done and finished now make a provision for the cleansiness look that word up cleansiness of the people as they journey on how you and I what daily sanctification you and I daily sanctification you shall brother I was clean and set aside for service yeah but you had to move from that first one if you stayed under that clean and set aside for service Satan could fill that thing back up I'd proved it to you this morning when the unclean spirit goes out of a man amen 10:4 is important but now let's go to the one we're talking about under the seals now same thing though you're already sealed in but God still calls for a daily sanctification through what that statue of a perfect man because you don't get all them virtues when you first get the new birth you get faith you have a potential to get them all amen but we need virtue we need knowledge or we were you know what Peter would have said Peter said hey you got it all when you believed he didn't say that he said those that haven't received the divine nature of God they bow in person divine hey man hey but one person divine that's Almighty God he said receiving the divine nature of God go on and add these things up listen how in the world you gonna get God's character and you don't have gardenia paint my brother Graham said some people have these things and they're just natural people I know somebody just like brother Richard Wilson was telling us he said that was a man in his work that if you walk to him Clement said look I'm gonna take your paycheck away from you for the next four weeks he said okay that's you wouldn't do that to me I'd show you my temperance but this guy was a safe person he was just a nominal gun what name a nominal Christian he was just a God he was just so making mouth so see the meek shall inherit the earth but listen the meat with the new birth shall inherit the earth hey man not just the meek you can be meek and humble and be the devil I'm gonna charge you fella now make a provision for the cleanliness of people as they journey on for if they do do wrong they're out of fellowship read it and before they can fellowship I want you to make a waters of separation for them and when Moses was commanded to take a then Moses command to take a red heifer a young heifer now I want you to notice the word red means something to you and I read means danger but read in the Bible means redemption redemption through the blood all the way from Genesis to revelations there's a red streak of blood all the way through red all the way notice they had to come under the shed blood amen that all right so now we're talking about sanctification we'll get into that more next Sunday but let's go to the next one here now let's read Matthew 12:43 now when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man I want somebody in the name of the Lord to tell me where that unclean spirit was before it left you it was you it was your own nature when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through Dry places why because he's a demon oh yeah he was a demon and still he is he walketh through Dry places seeking rest finders none how you noticed a demon what's this then he said I will return into my from whence I came out Satan thinks he's got something oh and when he has come he findeth empty swept and garnished cleaned sanctification means what cleaned and set aside for service not in service because I've told you a thousand times sanctification is the best place to be and it's the absolute worst to stay that way you stay in that God Satan is going to make you think you're born again that's where a lot of people in this message is I'm sorry by the way they act and the way they do I'm sorry they might be foolish virgins but you know what that's between them and God then go with he and take you with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself so where was that that spirit brings some more wicked than himself where was he right there this is a guy we talk about right here okay and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation so that's what do they do it they're getting a good sanctified condition like brother Dale's preaching if you can't let me just be real real straight with you if your pastors not born again you can't get born again you can only go as high as your pastor I'm just telling you what the prophecy it may is that right what he said that's why man can preach thirty years and preach this message and standing that pulpit or knowing it by God come on brothers anointed by God and then all of a sudden go prophets wrong you can't do that and be born again you can't deny the Word of God and be born again you can have some confusion absolutely but you can't just didn't ah and walk away from Ivan that's what I want to ask Geoff Jenkins one day I'm sorry he's named Valentin everybody knows I want to ask you f Jenkins I see you buried hundreds of people under this message you baptized hundreds of people under this message now you're saying it's all false what about the people they died under your ministry thinking thinking you had it and you didn't we hadn't dealt with ink well we are now you know the unclean spirits are a lot stronger they're not just putting out false doctrine out there just going completely against the message they're just blasting it out but what about the people what about the people in the congregation that built their whole life on this message you can't tell me that man was born again now he might have been sanctified that unclean spirit went out but he came back listen if you were a drunk and that unclean spirit went out he's not gonna bring seven more drunk spirits he's gonna say I didn't get him the first time but I'll get him the second time I'm gonna bring some of my religious buddies with me and I'm gonna make him worse seven times worse than the first brother Brown calls them a 2-fold more child of hell and then so you think it's really sweet that we get up here and we talking we all right yeah you wouldn't love to be no preacher I promise you that what brother Lewis had to bring I mean look listen to what listen what Jesus said jesus said if you don't force a father mother sister brother God I'm going to a funeral today to bury my kin you should let the dead bury the dead what the brother nail told you that somebody died your family and you're going to bake what's the dead better dead you need to be in church Kingdom Garth taken by force Wow sweet old Jesus platen ropes driving people out of a temple and he planted them so it took him a while he didn't just pick something up and fit a rage no he planted him a rope he said when I get this thing down to the end I'm going to work it man so sometimes we think well you know the the Spirit of God is meek it is and it makes you a Meeker person but still there's a time when it has to raise up and it has to fight because Satan is a fight or two but remember if you take that situation right there and leave it the way it is you're in bad shape but every one of us has to go through that every person that's born again has got to go through that right there why is it in the Bible I'll read you 100 quotes for brother Graham talks about that coming out the unclean spirit going out 20 calls him sometimes a two full more child to hell he knew what would happen listen him being a prophet he saw these things leave people he literally saw him sister I see you've got an evil spirit let us pray sister the evil spirits gone from you why he saw that thing leave but you know what he says though remember remember when the the maniac remember the maniac remember he fell there brother Brown's feet but brother brother said that spirit came back homey because he loved that spirit see now that guy was at a place where I believe that that if he would have accepted Christ he'd have been okay don't you think the unclean spirit went out it left him but what'd he do he's not gonna like that thing that's why we understand chief occasion there's a lot of things that we'll talk about some Sunday there's a lot of things that goes on but one thing's for sure it puts you in line of service for God that doesn't put you in service but it puts you in line for service all right let's read this last one and then we'll stop right here the contest I like this one right here I'd like to stand here now lay on to go back through the Bible and show you a man back there he came face to face with how the contest against the enemy they fortified themselves by the Word of God no one had an experience of it and knew that God told him it was gonna rain and the contest was on between science than the Word of God science says it can't God said it will amen that same thing exists today it will happen it does happen there is devils but Jesus cast them out and he gave his church authority to do so cast out devils in my name he cast Seven Devils out of a pretty woman one day and he said when the unclean spirit has gone out of the man he walks in dry places returning back then bringing seven other devils with him now brother Browns paraphrasing he's not reading exactly but once what he says now that goes to show that a man was cleaned of Devils there was something in him gone out a devil had gone out now when the devil moved out that God that gives God an opportunity oh my an opportunity to move in so when he goes out let the Holy Spirit come in don't just leave it there if you do just repent of your sins and go on then you're gonna be worse off than ever but get that place where Satan once lived good grief yes prophet Satan did live in me get it filled with the Holy Spirit of God then you'll have the strength of God's Word in you manifested and cast out devils the contest is on so even light shining God's Holy Spirit is present amen let's read Ephesians 5 and then won't stay and we'll close right here and then I'll pick this up next Sunday Ephesians 5:26 oh wait let me read that one wait nope I got to continue reading sorry sorry guys thank you this is the age of life based on my gosh Thank You brothers cuz I'd stopped right there I'm sorry first this is the age of life personal life of Christ were the chemical of his body what was him first under justification the water baptism second under the new birth of Wesley sanctification which cleanses and thirdly under the baptismal Holy Spirit putting that sanctified vessel in the service see the word sanctify means it's the compound Greek word which means cleaned and set aside for service set aside for service now the Holy Spirit puts it in service and will notice when the unclean spirit has gone from a man he walks in dry places that's exactly what the church has done Baptists Methodists those who believe in sanctification then jesus said the unclean spirit went out returns back to this church body Saint they've got a problem coming to church gets here for you two most time he's here when you're not all the time is here when you're not unless you took him with him then Jesus says the unclean spirits that went out returns back to this church body finds the house garnished swept clean living pure clean all right but then if that house isn't filled and occupied then he comes in with seven other evil demons worse than he is and the last stage of this place is 7 times worse than it was at the first place they had been better to stay Lutheran than it would be to receive the light and fail to follow it so will the Pentecostals say you know what I mean the house is garnished now let's read Ephesians 5 then let's see right here we're gonna stop features 5 verse 26 this is God speaking that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself he's not even going to trust anybody else to present us he's going to present himself he's the presenter he's going to present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish that red heifer without blemish in that Old Testament was a type of you and I in the end time coming under the waters of separation washing of the water by the word now they only had so much word to go on but we're talking about this this second part of sanctification this super sanctification because you shut already unless an unclean spirit should already be gone if you're born again it will be gone if you're born again amen then you've got to go back here now you got to go back to here why because there's doors in doors there's little demons big demons gone Satan but there's little demons that what memory reason there's five doors we have said this before memory reason memory where's it that where do you reason conscious affection imagination that's all right here where I'm pointing it's not down here it's right here that's the sanctification I'm talking about the unclean spirits still hear the little demons the little demons big demons not in me no more I ain't worried by big demon little demons is what I'm worried about this set on my shoulder and say you need to do so-and-so to your brother because I think he's talking about you I think he's doing there I think he's doing that Satan when you mouth is moving your life even when Satan is telling the truth he's lying even when the devil is telling the truth good you know what he'll tell you so you need to go to church we ain't lying but I want you to go to church and I want you to talk about six songs oh brother songs uh-huh hello that root of bitterness the property God talks about in the words of the church that root of bitterness it's not a born-again it's not the Holy Ghost no that root of bitterness is what you talking about this one's on one thing remember what brotherly kindness is what I when I did the statue a perfect man remember I told you brother kindness is not down here you got to go through all them to get to brotherly kindness right before the headstone come that must be pretty rough goes down here it's real wide a lot of people make it it just keeps going narrow and there were never because they remember what Billy Paul said about brother Branham he said I didn't know who daddy's enemies her friends were now I'll promise you one thing that ain't happened to me yet and the congregation says amen then ain't happened to me yet so he's still working on me the little demon this sits right here on the shoulder he can't get in me but he can sit right here and talk through these what he can talk through these inlets too right here he can't talk to this but what this has got to do is it say Satan I did not hold that I did not all that he's still working on me to make me 100 to be let's stand our feet that's why these seals listen if we just took this thing as a red horse rider and he was killing people in the Dark Ages and he was given a sword which is a word he was given a word to go by see that's putting it out there I just gave it to you in your house in your vessel you have to twist afternnon in your vessel to be sanctified well if louisa give his songs right if dick had playing the right key I mean really I'm just telling you worthless human being but you watch as we go up through this statue a perfect man though it is the waters of separation because there's only a certain group of people that water separation didn't clean everybody some people didn't want it listen all of Israel now we know all of Israel is going to be saved though that has the 144,000 we know that but Israel nominal will not be safe unless they get the new birth of Israel nominal it's just that and then went over there several years ago they're just as bad as we are they have murders they have prostitutes they have all these things the Jewish Kingdom ours I'm sorry the the children of Israel are the 144,000 the children of Israel Jacob and they're scattered the scattered everywhere right now but there's going to be 144,000 come in and accept this message the problem is we're not the problem the good thing is them two prophets we're not gonna have to spend 40 years explaining one God they know that there's only one God remember what to ask brother groundmass gets it will wholly be so he'd be beside who will that be said it'll be God they know that because remember it's only gonna take three and a half years for them to get justified sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost part of the wave statute pray for whatever you want to say they've got to be mature cuz they're gonna leave this place amen I know they'll be killed but still they still they're not they're going to be killed by their own brethren I've told you that they're gonna be killed because remember the feeling the fifth seal deuces how long how long to avenge our blood and that angel said wait a minute the ones your brothers are in that other dimension up there and on the earth and what happened to them they've got to be killed like you are they got to be
