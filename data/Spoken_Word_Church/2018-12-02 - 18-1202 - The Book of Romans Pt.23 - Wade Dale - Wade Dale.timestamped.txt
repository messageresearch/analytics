[0:00] brother yang sees interpreting for the
[0:02] for the brother is going to be here
[0:05] Wednesday night alright so now Romans 10
[0:14] alright come on guys time not yours
[0:17] let's go
[0:17] Romans 10 brethren my heart's desire and
[0:21] prayer to God for Israel is that they
[0:24] might be saved
[0:26] [Applause]
[0:28] cried the bear them record that they
[0:30] have a zeal of God but not according to
[0:33] knowledge become like this last week or
[0:36] less Sonny for they being ignorant of
[0:38] God's righteousness and going about to
[0:41] establish their own righteousness right
[0:43] the law
[0:44] the Pharisees thought as long as they
[0:47] did the Ten Commandments and read the
[0:50] Torah and did what God said in the in
[0:53] the Bible
[0:55] well the Old Testament from the Bible
[0:57] that they were fine and they were until
[1:00] the god of the letter of the law stepped
[1:04] down in front of them when the god of
[1:06] the leg of the law step down in front of
[1:08] them then their righteousness couldn't
[1:12] be established anymore because it wasn't
[1:14] their righteousness anyway all right
[1:17] going about this now arises this is Paul
[1:21] talking and remember he's going to Rome
[1:23] but he's talking to the Jews but he's
[1:25] going to Rome to visit the people that
[1:31] are in Rome does I'm doing believe have
[1:33] not submitted themselves unto the
[1:35] righteousness of God in other words they
[1:37] turn Christ down the turn the embodiment
[1:41] of the word they turned him down
[1:43] all right before Christ at the end but
[1:45] see now I want to say that I want you to
[1:48] look at something now when I read being
[1:52] in the fifth seal which we're going to
[1:54] be talking about this afternoon not so
[1:56] much about that part I'm trying to get
[1:57] some
[1:58] the way first but God came to them first
[2:02] God came to the Jews first they were his
[2:05] people he gave them the promise to
[2:08] Oracle's to this the that he gave them
[2:10] everything they needed that what did
[2:14] they do they turned it down right they
[2:16] turned it down and they became they
[2:19] became not his wife anymore they tried
[2:21] to live by their own righteousness and
[2:23] God blinded their eyes so that the
[2:26] Gentiles could come in okay he literally
[2:30] blind them because look come on read the
[2:34] Old Testament the way we read the Old
[2:36] Testament we see Jesus Christ all
[2:39] through there right they prophesied
[2:42] Moses said I'll send a prophet like them
[2:44] to me a virgin's young and see all those
[2:46] things were written in the Old Testament
[2:48] it was not here they they they actually
[2:51] they rehearsed them every Sabbath day
[2:54] they would read a part of the Torah they
[2:56] would read a part of this it would read
[2:58] a part of that right but when the man
[3:01] came that Moses and all the prophets
[3:04] talked about these enough the current
[3:06] you know the car team Dell they said
[3:07] ladies blood be on us and our children
[3:10] and God said okay I knew you were going
[3:13] to do that but I knew I wanted a Gentile
[3:16] bride because like we were talking last
[3:18] night there's a lot of things that going
[3:23] put up with with the Jews because of
[3:28] this well what we're talking about last
[3:30] night in the Bible study we were talking
[3:34] about prayer lines and stuff and laying
[3:38] on of hands and all that
[3:39] brother Brown says 30 or 40 times that's
[3:43] a Jewish tradition that was given to the
[3:47] Jews because the Jews needed some kind
[3:52] of contact he said that's not even for
[3:56] the Gentile church he was pretty plain
[3:58] he said that wasn't even given for the
[4:01] Gentile church to you I mean have any
[4:02] kind of look even the angel
[4:05] Brown had the vision of the third pole
[4:07] what do they angel telling you
[4:09] explaining this thing away you're you're
[4:11] in like brother Brown said he said my
[4:14] success is not in playing on the fans
[4:16] even in the prayer lines he does call
[4:20] hardly does he lay hands he does he said
[4:23] I'll lay hands on if you want me to but
[4:24] what was his true message was the
[4:27] discernment when he turned away from
[4:29] that prayer line and started calling
[4:30] people 30 and 40 feet away and he says
[4:33] see I never touched you will see that
[4:37] and I'll cover a little bit after I
[4:40] don't know people to get like daddy said
[4:44] last night I hope everybody understood
[4:46] it was people were kind of talking but
[4:48] he said that light brother doubt like
[4:50] the God said or Jesus they'll be
[4:52] stranded in that and swallow camel you
[4:54] know we we pick one thing and we don't
[4:56] hear no more of a sermon if it goes
[4:57] against what we think every bit of it
[4:59] you forget the rest of it this is what I
[5:02] heard you say right you know so but I
[5:06] believe the paralyzing safety needed but
[5:08] now when we get into the seals when we
[5:10] get into the third pull the third
[5:11] clothes not laying on hands the third
[5:13] pole is not for airline the third twelve
[5:16] speaking the word that's why we got to
[5:18] come up to because it's a tradition even
[5:21] call we read it where he said we must go
[5:24] on perfection not laying again what
[5:26] baptism even says laying on a man's all
[5:29] those things like that we got to come up
[5:31] higher from that that's telling Jim
[5:33] that's not that's our tradition that's
[5:34] why everybody when you say that they go
[5:37] why because that's the way they've been
[5:39] taught since then we're a little child
[5:41] to have a prayer line and everybody
[5:44] shout and fall out and speaking comes
[5:46] and that's not even in the Bible they
[5:52] lay hands on people for the Holy Ghost
[5:53] but even I look to the quote last night
[5:55] or brother Branson that is in the Bible
[5:57] and we will lay hands on receive the
[5:59] Holy Ghost he said but he said when Paul
[6:02] was at the house of Cornelius while he
[6:05] was preaching the Holy Ghost fell on the
[6:07] pavement Joyce and all the laying on of
[6:09] hands it's believing the Word of God and
[6:11] that's what we got to get thick but
[6:13] we're saying last
[6:14] I like the way this church is built
[6:16] because it's built on you individuals
[6:20] doing your own pray now other churches
[6:24] you want what you look pastors leave her
[6:27] dive and look what churches did that
[6:29] school why because they built it all on
[6:32] one man they built it all having to get
[6:34] into brothers songs up well if he would
[6:36] have taught his people I've always said
[6:40] the reason Jimmy Carter wasn't
[6:43] successful he was a great man great man
[6:46] he didn't surround herself with good
[6:49] people he surrounded himself with a
[6:50] bunch of liars and cheats Ronald Reagan
[6:56] comes in and surrounds herself with good
[6:57] people and he likes them handling that's
[7:00] the greatest man is unless some honey
[7:01] helps do it you know that build your
[7:05] build your same way here builds your
[7:10] church to to let everybody believe I'm
[7:15] just that way I mean you just you just
[7:17] got to believe it and and like I said
[7:19] too before it just goes it's been
[7:22] raining for three days I have nothing
[7:23] God's mad at you right there's nothing
[7:26] to do with it
[7:27] that's nature if you motor blows up in
[7:32] your car you said well God must be mad
[7:33] at me times beat this thing well maybe
[7:34] if you need to speak it yeah you can but
[7:37] that's a car it's a mechanical piece of
[7:38] equipment forget it
[7:40] that's the devil playing in your head
[7:42] right right I mean come home and like
[7:46] laying on of hands see we we talk would
[7:48] take laying on of hands that's temporary
[7:51] that's temporary listen all them people
[7:55] brother branham pray for in all those
[7:57] years probably 99.9% of them are laying
[8:01] in the grave somewhere so the healing
[8:04] was temporary do good hallelujah praise
[8:06] God they live longer they have better
[8:08] life but they had nothing to do with
[8:11] body change this is what we're talking
[8:14] about we're talking about coming up to a
[8:15] level to where the body change is not
[8:17] going to be going through a prayer line
[8:19] or laying on of hands right it's going
[8:21] to be believing for your cell brother
[8:23] Dale will not speak your body into a
[8:26] glorified condition but he can preach it
[8:29] enough to where you can see it and then
[8:32] God will change your body by what you
[8:34] said right to me I'll say to me that's
[8:36] just that's just so simple everybody
[8:38] else you just depending on what's just
[8:40] how you been right it's just how you
[8:42] been right whatever all the thing for
[8:49] one week burst up in that's what's right
[8:51] the lake get out of that thing and then
[8:54] he's gonna give me the whole brook and
[8:57] you know what it done it just might a
[8:58] bunch of junk you can't get the Holy
[9:01] Ghost by that I'm sorry
[9:03] yeah I believe in that you can't get the
[9:05] whole ego so here we go preach the Holy
[9:11] Ghost until they get the Holy Ghost and
[9:13] they want to get to hold those then let
[9:14] God work you know but let's no let's
[9:17] don't you know you say well I lost my
[9:18] job for the glory of the Lord no you
[9:20] lost your job could you probably weren't
[9:21] doing right thing or they were changing
[9:24] and it was you out of your control right
[9:25] so I wouldn't brother Brad I'm saying
[9:32] the third pull is now laying dormant I
[9:35] got that cold at the house remember I
[9:37] preached on the third pole about ten
[9:39] years ago where the three poles here
[9:41] journey I preached that long time there
[9:42] and but one of them is speaking the word
[9:47] but it's if it's laying dormant now
[9:49] runner-up said the third pole is laying
[9:51] dormant so what's going to cause it it's
[9:55] not going to cause because you can go
[9:56] out and make thousand dollars a week and
[9:58] live in a nice house and have a nice car
[10:00] no it's going to happen when all that
[10:02] goes and anything what you got to do
[10:06] then you speak the word for something to
[10:08] eat then you speak to work for something
[10:09] a Great Dane you speak the word for
[10:10] something to go somewhere right now
[10:12] that's not going to happen
[10:13] I mean it will in a small mining point
[10:16] but we're trying to get everybody to a
[10:18] place to where our mentality is is we're
[10:20] not going to die we're going to have a
[10:21] body change that's going to come from
[10:22] what's inside of us about the word that
[10:24] we hear I mean look at Paul I said last
[10:26] night look at Paul Paul did not sit
[10:31] pretty picture Paul did not stand around
[10:35] and say oh I got 39 stripes again God
[10:39] must not be with me no he said I glory
[10:42] he said I glory in my infirmities why
[10:46] because he saw the people that he called
[10:48] flashbang be put to death because of him
[10:50] and he said whatever I get that's what I
[10:52] get that time let's don't base our our
[10:59] let's don't base our revelational
[11:01] circumstances a revelation can't be
[11:05] based on circumstances because God is
[11:10] going to reveal to you that you gonna
[11:11] take a body change but you're gonna be
[11:12] standing in a dead body you know what I
[11:15] mean the one that's this dying because
[11:17] even the 3040 days when the dead come
[11:20] out of the ground we're gonna be changed
[11:22] after that so if somewhere during that
[11:23] time we'll get a buddy change so we've
[11:25] got to believe to get them out of the
[11:26] ground get them a glorified body and
[11:28] then us come to a place to where that
[11:31] will transpire so it's a lot of things
[11:33] got to go on we just got it you know
[11:35] what I go back to what brother Clarke
[11:37] said though well the Bible says those
[11:39] who endure to the end shall be saved the
[11:42] only way you're going to know you make
[11:43] it is to endure to the end cuz we see
[11:46] people falling all over the place now
[11:48] but let's go be ignorant of God's
[11:50] righteousness and go about establishing
[11:52] our own righteousness have not submitted
[11:54] themselves unto the righteousness of God
[11:56] for Christ is the end of the law for
[11:58] righteousness to every one that
[12:01] believeth
[12:01] believeth for Moses described the
[12:05] righteousness which is of the law that
[12:06] the man which do
[12:07] they stain shall live by them he's
[12:10] interpolating somewhere weird I miss
[12:12] that man it must be wailing are we under
[12:16] get back over on the other one you see
[12:20] the parentheses Lord of mercy did I miss
[12:26] it
[12:28] getting education we'll see there it
[12:36] says number six it's got a hole there in
[12:38] front there sorry but Moses ground the
[12:42] rocks would sit under laughs I don't
[12:43] further it would've been right thing the
[12:45] man was doing these things you live by
[12:46] them but the righteousness which is of
[12:48] faith speaketh on this wise say not in
[12:51] thy heart who shall descend into heaven
[12:53] that is to bring Christ down from above
[12:56] or who shall descend into paint that is
[12:59] to bring up Christ from the dead but
[13:02] what says it the word is nigh thee even
[13:04] in thy mouth and in thy heart not just
[13:08] in your mouth but in your heart because
[13:11] out of the abundance of the heart the
[13:12] mouth speaketh that is the Word of Faith
[13:14] which we preach then if thou shalt
[13:17] confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus
[13:19] and shalt believe in thine heart that
[13:20] God has raised him from the dead thou
[13:22] shalt be saved
[13:24] for with the heart man believeth not
[13:26] systems because because the your body
[13:31] can't do that your bodies just it's just
[13:33] as I was thinking the other day and let
[13:37] me just put this point in to that we a
[13:39] lot of people when I preach about them
[13:41] not worry don't worry about the bodies
[13:43] not anything to be a prevalent concern
[13:46] with here's an example what's the worst
[13:49] thing you can think of sister this is
[13:52] being a prostitute
[13:52] I mean you've defiled your body you've
[13:55] defiled your one hood and all those
[13:57] things but you can get born again you
[14:02] can get born again that has nothing to
[14:03] do the lady that was at the woman at the
[14:05] well had she had had five defilements
[14:08] and she was living with a man that was
[14:10] there in defilement then you understand
[14:11] what I mean defining the worst thing you
[14:13] can think of but she was safe but now
[14:17] you could take a virgin they lived to be
[14:19] 20 years old me deny God and she goes to
[14:21] hell so see it's not the body this thing
[14:24] okay
[14:26] it's what's inside
[14:28] but with the heart inside man believeth
[14:31] unto righteousness because there is no
[14:33] rocks code he's going to tell you in a
[14:35] little while
[14:35] there's no righteousness in this there
[14:37] is none this is not right this this was
[14:39] not rightness and there never will be
[14:40] rightness this thing I got because it
[14:43] come from mom and dad an act that was
[14:45] permitted by God after the fall to get
[14:47] me here so that I could believe with my
[14:49] heart under righteousness and you make
[14:52] that circle back again right that's what
[14:54] we're going back to we're going back to
[14:56] that part for with the heart man
[14:59] believeth unto righteousness and with
[15:00] the mouth confession is made unto
[15:02] salvation for the scripture says
[15:04] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[15:07] ashamed but there is no difference
[15:09] between the Jew and the Greek
[15:11] what he brings them back together
[15:12] there's no difference between the Jew
[15:14] and the Greek for the same lord over all
[15:16] is rich unto all that call upon him
[15:19] whosoever shall call upon the name of
[15:21] the Lord shall be saved
[15:24] you'd say well and everybody that calls
[15:27] on the name of the Lord shall be saved
[15:28] go back to the heart part God knows in
[15:32] your heart he knows your heart better
[15:35] than you knowing because he knows what
[15:37] your heart is gonna do the next day and
[15:38] the next day and the next day how shall
[15:42] they call on him who they have not
[15:43] believed and how shall they believe in
[15:46] him of whom they have not heard and how
[15:49] shall they hear without a preacher
[15:51] because remember faith cometh by hearing
[15:59] listen there is there is zero chance of
[16:03] you getting born again if you not heard
[16:05] the word but you there's nothing at the
[16:06] judge there's nothing to judge that
[16:08] there's nothing there's nothing to
[16:09] convict you by the word is what
[16:12] convinced you inside you the word
[16:15] conviction you come under conviction
[16:18] because of the word not because of what
[16:22] grandpa said her grandma said I said
[16:25] many times before I wish I could save my
[16:26] kids mom tried to save me for
[16:28] 20-something years you can't do it
[16:29] there's no way but let God get a hold up
[16:34] the inside man see so I had not
[16:38] everybody called one name Lord shall be
[16:40] saved but the bible does say whosoever
[16:42] shall call upon the name of the lord
[16:43] let me interpolate with an honest heart
[16:45] shall be safe
[16:47] some people call them name of the Lord
[16:49] that's like we talked about you know
[16:51] people finding Jesus in jail you know
[16:53] you you go just up you go in jail then I
[16:55] begin to become four legs especially if
[16:57] you're on death row you know I mean
[16:59] really and some of them may be sincere
[17:01] but some of us not you know that about
[17:04] what the what life thing they had legal
[17:07] but see there again there's a law man
[17:10] murder if he gives his heart to God he
[17:13] gets born again he's just as clean as
[17:14] you are but he did that with his with
[17:17] his body that his body participated in
[17:19] what he did but the inside man was
[17:22] changed and cleaned out it was given a
[17:26] new heart
[17:26] that's what does equal sin I'll give you
[17:28] a new heart and how shall they preach
[17:31] except they be sent as it is written how
[17:33] beautiful are the feet of them that
[17:34] preach the gospel of peace and bring
[17:36] glad tidings of good things see I
[17:38] preached a sermon you know about feet
[17:40] long time and that's why them the Bible
[17:44] always shows Jesus with the feet of
[17:46] brass
[17:46] because what is brass divine judgment
[17:48] but where does divine judgment come from
[17:51] the preaching of the word that's the
[17:54] divine judgment is the preaching of the
[17:56] word all right now beautiful and feeding
[17:58] them to preach the gospel of peace and
[17:59] bring glad tidings of good things
[18:02] but they have not all obeyed the gospel
[18:05] for Isaiah said Lord who has believed
[18:08] our report in other words who has
[18:11] believed our report he has the same
[18:13] question who does believe that report so
[18:16] then faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[18:18] by the Word of God but I say have they
[18:22] not heard yes verily their sound went
[18:26] into all the earth and their words unto
[18:28] the ends of the world but was it applied
[18:33] or was it taking them not always no but
[18:38] I say did not Israel no usual they
[18:43] should have known the Messiah was going
[18:44] to be
[18:44] they were looking for him to come the
[18:47] way the Bible said he came exactly that
[18:50] way I will provoke you to jealousy by
[18:55] them there are no people and by a
[18:58] foolish nation I will anger you all
[19:02] right when most by foolish nation I will
[19:04] anger you all those ayats but Isaiah is
[19:09] very bold and says I was found of them
[19:13] that sought me not I was found of them
[19:17] that sought me not us Gentiles okay
[19:21] Calise God they went look at my brother
[19:24] and said they we were not wheat he says
[19:25] we brings a whole Gentile nation he said
[19:27] we were not looking for my side wait a
[19:30] clue we not have a clue that there was
[19:33] no Messiah we were we were Romans we
[19:36] were Gentiles
[19:37] we were demons and gods and other gods
[19:40] and these gods and that God would you
[19:42] had one God they had that part right
[19:45] they just forgot then he was coming in
[19:48] human flesh but what happened though is
[19:50] we'll cover in the fifth seal God black
[19:52] had to literally put his hand over their
[19:54] eyes to keep them from seeing what was
[19:57] going on so you and I could come in
[20:01] here's nothing wouldn't be that break in
[20:03] that in that 70 weeks a day there had to
[20:06] be a break to get a Gentile bride but I
[20:12] think it's very potent I was found with
[20:13] him something on I almost made manifest
[20:16] unto them that asked not after me but to
[20:21] Israel he says all day long I have
[20:24] stretched forth my hand in other words
[20:26] for three and a half years I was among
[20:28] all of you and you turned me down you
[20:31] rejected me I have stretched forth my
[20:35] hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying
[20:39] people and as to what the Jews are still
[20:42] known you know but you know what God is
[20:44] never gonna forget them come he said he
[20:45] went he told one they ran to look up
[20:51] count stars look down count the sands on
[20:54] the seat man try doing that you can
[20:57] Calahan Paul let's let's count the whole
[20:59] oceans to sand on the ocean beach that
[21:03] I'll not forget Israel I say then hath
[21:06] God cast away his people god forbid now
[21:08] see if you were listening let's go back
[21:11] to the example of money there if you
[21:14] heard that sermon from Paul you can
[21:16] pretty much so much that God has kicked
[21:18] the Jews out AHA right but you went
[21:22] listening to the whole thing I say then
[21:24] hath God cast away his people god forbid
[21:27] for I also AM an Israelite of the seed
[21:30] of Abraham of the tribe of Benjamin
[21:32] he knew his lineage it was a Jew he knew
[21:36] his lineage but he knew that lineage was
[21:38] worthless
[21:40] in other words hey Paul was alive when
[21:43] Jesus was here he was alive somewhere
[21:48] he might have never met Jesus but he was
[21:50] alive if if Jesus died maybe 30 and Paul
[21:54] was in 1856 when he died and he was an
[21:57] older man he had to be either about the
[22:02] same age of Jesus or somewhere around
[22:03] that so he was there during the time but
[22:05] he missed the whole thing
[22:08] you know why this time remember he said
[22:10] I was born one out of new season or one
[22:12] hundred do time brother you should have
[22:17] been as well apostle how's that putting
[22:18] bag puts it right in there where he
[22:20] should have been that that 12th man but
[22:24] we know that can't happen because of
[22:26] what Paul had to do
[22:27] Paul had to take us to believe on Jesus
[22:30] Christ not believe only got standing
[22:32] there Jesus Christ believe on Jesus
[22:33] Christ that you have not seen right okay
[22:36] God hath not cast away his people which
[22:39] he foreknew we're gonna get to a little
[22:42] bit of their own fish sail because he
[22:43] he's gonna get white rose the people
[22:45] that didn't even want what about grace
[22:49] what you not that the scripture saith of
[22:52] Elias how he maketh intercession to
[22:54] guard against neutral same Lord they
[22:56] have killed the prophets and digged down
[22:58] thine altars and I am
[22:59] alone on that sequence but what's that
[23:02] the answer of God unto him this is kind
[23:05] of where I think went sunny a little bit
[23:07] more down through here kind of backed up
[23:09] for a minute cuz I want to cover that
[23:10] other but I have reserved to myself
[23:12] seven thousand men though not bowed the
[23:15] knee to the image of bail even so then
[23:18] it's this present time also there is a
[23:20] remnant according to the election of
[23:22] grace you know watch Paul st. Paul
[23:24] saying hey it looks bad out there in
[23:27] Israel but God has a has a group of
[23:31] people because remember one hundred
[23:32] twenty were Jews the three thousand were
[23:34] Gentiles 120 or Jew so God did come to
[23:37] the Jews and give him the whole girls
[23:38] person so he forget he used them to
[23:42] carry the gospel but knowing though that
[23:44] they'd be rejected looking at what I'm
[23:46] not killed for what they believe and if
[23:52] by grace then is no more of works
[23:54] otherwise grace is no more grace because
[23:57] what is great we'll get into that and
[23:59] fifth seal a little bit more grace is
[24:01] unmerited favor there is nothing you
[24:04] could do that's why I said grace cannot
[24:06] be something that man has developed
[24:09] running no way that has to be the
[24:12] sovereignty of God because you and I
[24:16] whether you the best Saint in the world
[24:19] you have a list of do and don't and they
[24:23] did and they didn't and they don't and
[24:26] they do and right that's right all right
[24:29] now I know how that grace is unmerited
[24:31] favor all that merit right here on that
[24:33] you've been looking up and saying up if
[24:38] this works grace is no effect now
[24:43] remember there was contention there with
[24:45] James and and Paul about this not
[24:48] between them but now where they say well
[24:50] it's gotta be my work I like my brother
[24:53] Brown he comes in preach works his face
[24:55] expressed
[24:56] okay so faith is see we that's why I
[25:00] said grace is something you and I that's
[25:02] why
[25:03] come to that fifth seal we have to be in
[25:05] the fifth seal to see sure we get grace
[25:08] every day the grace of God is what saved
[25:10] us but the grace of God when we get all
[25:13] these do's and don'ts and isms and all
[25:15] out of our out of our mind like we me
[25:18] and Jim were talking last night and I'll
[25:22] probably say this and getting trouble
[25:24] with it upstairs
[25:25] but laying on of hands and stuff like
[25:27] that that is that denominational idea
[25:30] that we got to get rid of
[25:39] if we gotta go on now then I'm not
[25:41] really all that brother I'm seven Son of
[25:43] Man will be revealed in a different form
[25:45] a different way so it's going to be
[25:49] different than anything we are well
[25:50] previously talked because the Son of man
[25:54] didn't in stream of demons remember he
[26:00] did not scream two things he that's why
[26:03] I said it we don't know if we don't know
[26:04] what the Son of Man is if you want to
[26:06] make a list though you meant to Mark
[26:07] Luke and John amazingly that's what the
[26:09] son of man is so that was him and he had
[26:12] screaming the demons but you know what
[26:15] he had bad days and good things right
[26:22] jesus wept
[26:24] Jesus cried over things wine that was
[26:28] the humanity part one day we'll talk
[26:32] about that because when we get trapped
[26:35] we're trapped in these first three
[26:36] dimensions when Wheatland when God done
[26:39] what he did and separated out of many
[26:41] more when Adam and Eve did what they did
[26:42] and God had to separate them he put us
[26:44] in this them in the first three
[26:46] dimension life like matter and we can't
[26:49] clean you outside of that we get in a
[26:53] fifth dimension if we die we get the
[26:55] sixth dimension if we die we can't get
[26:57] yourself a dimension until the glorified
[26:59] body comes fourth dimension is what
[27:01] you're seeing here Internet waves don't
[27:04] coming through this wall right now and
[27:06] that's the way God contacts us but
[27:08] that's the way the devil contacts so the
[27:09] same way so the fourth dimension we've
[27:12] tapped into but we can't what I'm saying
[27:14] is we can't go into the fourth dimension
[27:16] with this what we have so we're trapped
[27:18] in this dimension and there's certain
[27:21] things happen in this dimension
[27:22] that's why I'll read you two this
[27:24] afternoon rather I've never quoted it
[27:29] but he saved many many times when we
[27:30] come to that fifth seal that's in
[27:32] another dimension
[27:33] God had to take John into another
[27:36] dimension so you and I are gonna have to
[27:38] tap into another dimension to get out of
[27:41] here not the fifth dimension but the
[27:44] fifth seal all right we don't want to
[27:47] have been a fifth dimension
[27:48] and that's the senator day right but I
[27:51] keep telling you about the state's
[27:53] dimension in this dimension there's a
[27:54] buffer in there remember they the the
[27:56] Bible says there's a great gulf fixed
[27:58] you know when Lazarus wanted to talk to
[28:00] Abraham he said well I can't get to you
[28:03] and you can't get to make one that's a
[28:04] great dog Daisy was in one dimension and
[28:06] and Abraham then the other but they can
[28:08] see each other you come to a place where
[28:10] they can see each other so that's what
[28:12] you're gonna have to do this where
[28:13] brother Brown said daughter become so
[28:15] visible among this now we know the
[28:17] corporal body is not going to be in here
[28:18] but he's gonna be so visible among there
[28:20] is he gonna be visible in us yeah it us
[28:23] yes it's gonna be visible in us and then
[28:28] the rapture will take place then the
[28:29] body change and then the rapture will go
[28:31] all right so let's get back to grace to
[28:33] look um about a little bit of Stephanie
[28:35] grace is not great if there's one mark
[28:38] that you did something to give it then
[28:42] becomes work there I understand that it
[28:46] then becomes works because you can pin I
[28:49] did this to give this that's not grace
[28:55] grace is unmerited favor period that's
[28:59] what a man can't you can't fathom it but
[29:01] we can start believing it
[29:02] well the fifth seal is so important
[29:04] that's why I'm laps back under the word
[29:05] to the body change we got to see that
[29:08] it's not it's not this and it's not your
[29:13] bank account you don't matter if you got
[29:16] three cars for 30 to god that to
[29:19] remember that's in this dimension we're
[29:21] trapped in this dimension with life like
[29:23] matter and we have to do thank you yes
[29:25] we do because Jesus didn't have to do
[29:27] when you come into this dimension he had
[29:30] to eat he slept he had done the bathroom
[29:34] he had to do all the things that humans
[29:37] do and he was Almighty God and they hung
[29:40] on mighty God on a cross so let's get
[29:45] this thing out of our mind that we're
[29:47] coming to this sinless perfection to
[29:48] where see that's our problem
[29:50] our thought process is if I never get to
[29:53] a place I speak the word anybody ever
[29:56] cut me off on the road I'll just
[30:00] if my boss is giving me a bad day I'm
[30:03] just that's my brother Brown said power
[30:07] without character isn't Technic it's the
[30:11] power of God but if you don't have the
[30:14] character to use it he's not gonna give
[30:15] it to you because he knows what you
[30:17] gonna do it
[30:18] I read your quote today brother Brown
[30:21] talks about the power being in you to
[30:23] create a world and go live on it you
[30:26] have the power and he said if you're a
[30:28] born-again Christian you have the power
[30:30] tonight to go create a world and go live
[30:33] on it yourself yes but there's a lot
[30:37] what this dimension and the word but in
[30:41] this dimension you can't do that
[30:45] but we gotta do now this dimension we
[30:48] got in not what's going on right here we
[30:51] got a denied death because really close
[30:56] this is where only this is the only
[30:58] place where there is death you should
[31:01] know the fifth amended the state's
[31:06] dimension they have died from this
[31:07] dimension who went into that one right
[31:10] so the only death reigns in this
[31:13] dimension the first three lifeline
[31:14] member so we got to know that because it
[31:17] doesn't happen anymore else that's why I
[31:20] said we got a we got a long way to go
[31:22] and what we're going to get there we got
[31:23] to change our thinking from the old
[31:26] previous and brother that was gonna
[31:29] preach at this morning that horse
[31:31] forehead is the nomination though idea
[31:33] is that you and I have not been people
[31:36] over there cross the road that we have
[31:39] right so he'll get to this afternoon I
[31:42] hope it kind of melt meld them with what
[31:44] I'm sure it will but if it's it works
[31:47] then it's no more grapes otherwise work
[31:50] is no more work
[31:52] what then Israel have not obtained that
[31:54] week what that which he seeketh for but
[31:58] the election has the
[32:00] painted and the rest were blanket we
[32:07] attain to were the elect is for was the
[32:11] elect but they were blinded look
[32:17] interpolating the rest were blinded and
[32:23] if you take that out put it unto this
[32:25] day well now Paul is gonna explain why
[32:27] according and is written so it goes back
[32:29] to the Word of God and God had given
[32:31] them the spirit of slumber eyes that
[32:35] they should not see and ears if they
[32:38] should not hear because they saw God in
[32:41] human flesh they excuse me they heard
[32:44] God in human flesh but they turned him
[32:46] in actually they called him an L right
[32:52] see that's what I mean we if you read
[32:54] that about the son of man he was so much
[32:59] human
[33:03] till they call them enamel they said
[33:07] you're a wine-bibber you only hang
[33:09] around prostitutes and sinners they call
[33:13] them belzebub why because they had their
[33:17] preconceived idea of what God supposed
[33:20] to be like what he didn't fit one
[33:26] criteria they had on their little list
[33:31] he had fit one he was so far away from
[33:35] that list till they called him the devil
[33:38] but he was all money God that's what I'm
[33:40] telling you we need to throw away our
[33:41] lists don't weigh our lists and give
[33:46] back and see the grains he got to give
[33:48] it unto this day and David said let
[33:53] their table be made a snare and a trap
[33:55] and a stumbling block and recompense
[33:57] them to them that their eyes be darkened
[34:00] that they may not see and bow down their
[34:02] back alway Paul says I say then have
[34:07] they stumbled that they should fall god
[34:09] forbid
[34:12] you read - have they stumbled that they
[34:16] should fall god forbid they thought
[34:19] later stumble but rather through their
[34:23] fall through their fall salvation has
[34:29] come to the Gentiles for to provoke them
[34:32] to jealousy
[34:34] now if the fall of them be the riches of
[34:37] the world look like and the diminishing
[34:39] of them the riches of the Gentiles how
[34:41] much more their focus in other words the
[34:44] Gentiles are going we got this this this
[34:46] this this
[34:47] this this this this this I mean the
[34:48] juice we got this Gentiles just said we
[34:53] believe you was my son what did they
[34:57] have to go on that's why the Gentile
[35:00] iced wine of God loved the Gentiles when
[35:02] he spoke to that Gentile that Centurion
[35:05] didn't need he didn't know nothing about
[35:06] the law nothing but he said I perceive
[35:11] you're a man of authority he said I'm a
[35:13] man of authority in other words if I say
[35:14] go they go if I say come they come what
[35:17] was he saying sir I see something in you
[35:20] called Authority if you say go demon it
[35:23] goes if you say coming comes whatever
[35:25] you speak not touch whatever you speak
[35:28] it'll happen
[35:29] so he said that found on faith and
[35:32] therefore Wankel they always need to lay
[35:34] on hands I don't mean the touching and
[35:35] the shaking and the throwing and all
[35:37] that stop you right you got to get away
[35:42] from them now to follow them be the
[35:45] riches of the world and the diminishing
[35:47] of them the riches of the Gentiles how
[35:49] much more their fullness excuse me for I
[35:52] speak to you Gentiles in as much as I am
[35:55] NOT the apostle of the Gentiles I
[35:57] magnify my office for I speak to you
[36:01] Gentiles in as much as I am the apostle
[36:04] times it not does sorry
[36:06] it is much that's why I looked out
[36:08] though he what do you say that as much
[36:10] as I am that thank you sister bless you
[36:11] as much as I am that's my wife that's
[36:21] okay she keeps me straight across to me
[36:24] as much as I am the apostle of the
[36:26] Gentile I'm going to find another now
[36:28] that don't mean he exalted itself no
[36:33] he's telling the truth he went to the
[36:36] Jews the Jews civil they don't know this
[36:38] so he goes to the Gentile so he's now
[36:41] the Apostle and he's setting up he's
[36:44] fixing to go to the Romans they're
[36:45] Gentiles I magnify my office if by any
[36:51] means I may provoke to emulation
[36:53] whatever English jealousy then which are
[36:58] my flesh Jews and might save some of
[37:02] them
[37:03] he's still tried when he said long I
[37:06] turn to the Gentiles that man could you
[37:08] walk up said I'm gonna be baptized name
[37:09] of Jesus Christ and I want to be saved
[37:11] he said now you're G got it now they
[37:13] came in to write quite after casting
[37:17] away of them be the reconciliation of
[37:19] the world watch out the receiving of
[37:21] them but life from dead don't know where
[37:25] she's not kicking them out and look we
[37:30] must be real careful we we don't want to
[37:34] keep anybody out we that's not our job
[37:38] we preach on a denominational idea
[37:41] that's wrong not to people right but now
[37:43] the people become that that's their
[37:45] business but you can't do anything about
[37:46] that so we don't preach hands to people
[37:50] they're there you know what like say the
[37:52] more sincere than we are most of the
[37:54] time but they've been caught in a system
[37:57] that's false this up the devil okay but
[38:02] they've been caught in there because my
[38:04] brother Graham said they're worshipping
[38:05] the devil thinking they're worshiping
[38:07] God that's the worst deceit there is
[38:08] that's time way with you enough
[38:15] but for the casting way that may
[38:18] represent the worst one students in the
[38:19] okay 480 first-fruit be holy the lump is
[38:22] also holy and the root be holy so other
[38:25] branches now what's he saying remember
[38:26] we were grafted in that olive tree is
[38:33] Israel it's alive he's not gonna forget
[38:36] her
[38:36] we were just grafted in I like to graft
[38:40] it in part in the 70 weeks of Daniel you
[38:42] got 70 weeks of Daniel there's your tree
[38:44] then all of a sudden God brought in the
[38:46] middle of it he grasped in the Gentiles
[38:49] the wild olive branch into the tree the
[38:53] trees are alive it's what he's saying
[38:55] right here great the first fruit be holy
[38:58] their holy people the Jews the lump is
[39:01] also hoping and if the root be holy
[39:03] store the branches they just didn't get
[39:06] crops like wheat Gotti but they will
[39:09] come to the fifth seal in the sixth seal
[39:12] they get him again 144,000 and the ones
[39:15] that were Jews they've got their lot
[39:17] ropes just because lured youth get in
[39:20] and if some of the branches be broken
[39:22] off and thou being a wild olive tree us
[39:25] were grafted in among them and with them
[39:30] for take us of the root and fatness of
[39:32] the olive tree boast not against the
[39:34] branches but if thou boast thou bear'st
[39:37] not the root but the root thee so the
[39:39] life comes from root that will say then
[39:42] the branches were broken off that I
[39:44] might be grafted in let's talk about
[39:46] saying let's go woman that's active
[39:49] Owens
[39:52] because of unbelief they were broken up
[39:55] yeah those yeah well I'm gonna work they
[39:57] be my coming later do you find the books
[40:00] of the Bible in this paragraph
