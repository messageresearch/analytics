[8:53] we got a good crowd this morning so

[9:01] John 1 and second Corinthians 5 Heavenly

[9:16] your love and understanding be with us
[9:18] as we try to minister about the things
[9:21] that you have shown unto us we ask you
[9:24] to just open the eyes of each one of us
[9:26] that we may walk therein we love you and
[9:30] we thank you bless each one remember the
[9:32] sick among us
[9:33] you said you sent your word and healed
[9:35] us and delivered us from destruction so
[9:37] this blessing got each one have your way
[9:40] now and keep us Lord in Jesus name Amen
[9:45] showing one maybe this will begin to be
[9:49] opening up a little bit to us and to
[9:53] give us a little better understanding
[9:55] because I'm trying to
[9:57] express something and I've been doing it
[9:59] for many years but it kind of keeping
[10:04] the point or talk before you but yet not
[10:08] opening up so far to just say things you
[10:14] know but to be something that I can
[10:16] decode has been on my heart for about
[10:19] probably 15 20 years something on the
[10:22] Godhead and I've been speaking on it and
[10:24] trying to bring it just a little more at
[10:26] a time a little more at a time and you
[10:29] think I repeat myself well that's good
[10:31] weary keep repeating ourselves and until
[10:33] we get it but if you'd watch you would
[10:36] see that I move up a little bit I do
[10:40] that deliberately I bring it and I move
[10:42] up a little bit I bring it and I move up
[10:45] a little bit so you know maybe you need
[10:47] to listen more careful and say well you
[10:51] know what he didn't bring it that way
[10:53] the last time it might open up a little
[10:56] better unto it okay now in the beginning
[11:00] was the word and the Word was with God
[11:03] and the Word was God the same was in the
[11:06] beginning with God all things were made
[11:09] by who made by the word and without the
[11:12] word without him not anything made that
[11:16] was made not anything made that was made
[11:20] in him was life and the life was a lot
[11:24] of men and the light shyness in darkness
[11:26] and the darkness there's no way the
[11:29] darkness could comprehend light because
[11:33] light automatically puts out darkness it
[11:37] doesn't matter how dark it is strike one
[11:41] match that light will put out all the
[11:45] darkness all right see but you can pile
[11:48] all your darkness you want to up and
[11:51] keep piling it on that match it won't
[11:54] put that match out there's no way
[11:56] because it is the word okay we've been
[11:59] on the thought here and we'll pick it up
[12:01] a little bit so let's go to 2nd
[12:03] Corinthians 5 and we'll begin verse 1
[12:08] well we know that if our earthly house
[12:10] of this
[12:11] Minako were dissolved we have a building
[12:13] of God in house not made with hands
[12:15] eternal in the heavens
[12:17] for in this we groan earnestly desiring
[12:20] to be clothed upon with our house which
[12:23] is from heaven if so be that being
[12:25] clothed we shall be shall not be found
[12:28] naked for we know we know what for we
[12:32] that are in this tabernacle and then do
[12:36] groan being burdened all right not for
[12:41] that that we should be unclothed but
[12:43] clothed upon that mortality might be
[12:46] swallowed up of life and he that hath
[12:50] brought us for the self same thing is
[12:53] god who also hath given unto us the
[12:56] earnest of the Spirit you may be seated
[13:00] the Lord that is listening to the
[13:02] reading of the word now I want to try to
[13:08] keep you know dwelling on some things
[13:13] until you get it oh you know but now
[13:17] what we'll be doing today if I can get
[13:20] through this morning I will try but if
[13:22] not I will do it next Sunday you know to
[13:26] try to get everything in the line
[13:27] because I want to make sure you keep it
[13:30] in a line and a thought all right now
[13:33] what I want to do today is talk about
[13:38] that we've been back before time we've
[13:41] been back you know in eternity zand
[13:44] showing and they're things like that and
[13:46] we'll repeat some of that coming down
[13:49] but yet my whole purpose has been in
[13:52] mind is to get us to think about how
[13:55] that it will eventually come down to
[13:59] where we are all right if you're talking
[14:03] about before the foundation of the world
[14:05] we've been talking about how God
[14:07] condescended downwardly to reveal
[14:10] himself to man all right there was no
[14:13] way to just you know him to be able to
[14:16] just step out and and that would be it
[14:18] you know because there would be no way
[14:21] to understand because you said well you
[14:24] could but
[14:25] cause you can look and see you could see
[14:27] him you know he would be standing there
[14:29] yes that may be true but remember the
[14:33] devil can impersonate all of the things
[14:36] and he could be standing there also but
[14:41] if you descend slowly from and that's
[14:46] maybe a hard way of saying it but it's
[14:48] the best way to I know and I believe
[14:51] that's what God has done he has so
[14:53] slowly unfolded himself down to reveal
[14:58] himself to you and I all right now we
[15:02] said well we just believe it's God you
[15:04] know why do we need to know all of this
[15:06] and all of that
[15:07] we just believe it was God well
[15:10] everybody in the world believes his God
[15:11] so what do you got
[15:13] you know we believed it when wizna
[15:15] Baptist we believed it and we're the
[15:17] messages we believed it was in the
[15:18] Catholic we believe we believe in God
[15:22] well sure that's why you don't hear me
[15:25] throw those people because they do
[15:28] believe in God but you know what that
[15:32] was where were you an hour and a time no
[15:37] I've always believed it this away but I
[15:40] just you know well that's our haptics
[15:42] it's up to you to keep on being deceived
[15:44] but now thinking about the great eternal
[15:51] God and how he's condescended to reveal
[15:54] himself to you and I why would that not
[15:56] be the greatest goal of any Christian
[15:58] life I mean if you believed it if you
[16:03] believed you had a totem pole and it was
[16:06] these to be in the image of your God
[16:09] wouldn't you want to study that totem
[16:11] pole to see what you could know about
[16:14] him
[16:15] where he come from and what he is what
[16:17] he's made of and and all the things
[16:19] wouldn't you want to do it that one well
[16:21] why wouldn't you want to do within God
[16:23] to that much more of understanding the
[16:28] greater extent of understanding to to be
[16:32] able to comprehend a living God to
[16:37] manifest himself
[16:39] - you and I all right now but yet
[16:42] thinking about him and thinking of how
[16:44] that he's condescended and to think that
[16:48] he has he doesn't uh he said I'm God and
[16:53] I change not
[16:55] he said well he changed what if - that
[16:57] no no that's where the problem we think
[17:00] he changed no he didn't change he just
[17:03] transformed into another form just like
[17:09] you you as when you got married you
[17:11] become a husband then with children come
[17:13] along you become a father and then a
[17:15] grandfather and a great-grandfather and
[17:16] on and on that what you didn't change
[17:20] you just manifested more of your nature
[17:25] and your ways and the things comes into
[17:27] being all right and that's the way that
[17:30] I believe God is doing to reveal itself
[17:32] to you and I but now what I want to do
[17:35] today is if I can get through if I don't
[17:38] I'll finish it next week I want to talk
[17:40] about how Jesus Christ came into being
[17:45] all right cover that part and then cover
[17:50] the way Adam came into being uh-huh and
[17:55] cover that part and then cover how you
[17:59] and I came into being all right okay
[18:04] then that way you know we can say well
[18:07] we've got it lined up at least we
[18:09] understand the Scriptures because we can
[18:10] follow it down all right
[18:13] so then we've spent a quite a time
[18:15] speaking about in previous messages that
[18:19] we don't believe in an eternal sonship
[18:24] all right but we believe that God
[18:29] Himself condescended into another form
[18:35] our took on another phone what's the way
[18:39] you want to express it you do your
[18:41] terminologies I'm not into all of that I
[18:43] just look at it the way that I see God
[18:45] how that he would unveil himself and he
[18:50] could not be made known
[18:52] without it coming the way that it came
[18:55] now you say well they could have done
[18:56] this he could have done that well you
[18:58] know the Bible says that who was
[19:01] backwards you back there I believe it's
[19:02] in the book of Job in it was you back
[19:04] there to tell me how to do these things
[19:07] oh that's wonderful in it we think we're
[19:10] smarter than his now remember one thing
[19:13] the way God came is the only way God
[19:16] could come he couldn't come another way
[19:21] cuz he'd be changing his mind his
[19:24] daughter is being or whatever so then
[19:27] why not just think about the way that he
[19:29] came and it's a wonderful understanding
[19:33] too to be able to you know we talked
[19:36] about God when we were in the Methodist
[19:38] Baptist Presbyterian Catholics or
[19:40] whatever we were we talked about God we
[19:42] prayed to God we we worship God we see
[19:48] now it's becoming more personal to line
[19:52] up into a fellowship with the very being
[19:57] himself that created us all right
[20:02] beginning to understand why we're here
[20:05] and what we're doing we're just not a
[20:07] not on the log it has happened to be a
[20:09] Polliwog one time and a frog the next
[20:12] time and a just out of the other the
[20:14] next time and I never didn't know how
[20:16] they got from the alligator to the bird
[20:18] that was one of them it was in that
[20:20] theory of Darwin somewhere when tonight
[20:23] was coming up believe you come from an
[20:24] alligator to a bird there's a lot of
[20:27] chains art had to be done but but listen
[20:33] see we've been talking about that we
[20:37] don't believe in eternal sonship no but
[20:41] we believe that the Son of God was God
[20:46] made manifest in another form a simple
[20:50] in you are a son and then you have
[20:59] children that's in another form it just
[21:01] keeps unfolding as it comes down
[21:04] alright but see really
[21:06] what we look at see he's in another form
[21:09] called a Sun and that's were that see
[21:13] the people of the message that can
[21:15] handle it pretty good and talk about
[21:17] things a little bit they it's hard for
[21:20] them to go back i watch this ever since
[21:22] being in the message he's hard for them
[21:25] to back up in eternity and talk about a
[21:27] Sun because automatically your mind
[21:34] clicks insists that at work because
[21:38] automatically your mind says wait a
[21:39] minute you back an eternity in you're
[21:41] talking about a son a son at the
[21:42] beginning their son had a beginning they
[21:48] then you've messed it out but if we just
[21:52] think about that back in eternity before
[21:56] the world or anything ever begun God
[21:58] himself just unveiled another form maybe
[22:02] that's the way of saying maybe instead
[22:04] of stepping over into or whatever you
[22:06] want to do use your terminologies your
[22:09] thought in your mind to understand but
[22:11] yet we know he he didn't change himself
[22:15] but he changed the way he was doing and
[22:18] he condescended downward to to be see
[22:23] then you would come up with John one or
[22:27] you would come into the word and it
[22:30] would say you know in the beginning was
[22:32] the word workers we've got in the Word
[22:33] was God
[22:34] alright see that's not a with God it's
[22:37] never over here now it's God revealing
[22:40] himself alright so he stepped down from
[22:46] the great eternity z-- and brought into
[22:49] being the word great words we used logo
[22:55] a theophany
[22:55] see we where we like to think about that
[23:00] we know them big old theological words
[23:02] but do we know what it means
[23:06] see then we can we bring it out that the
[23:09] word was the creator all right and being
[23:16] the Creator God the word
[23:19] would be easily called a son not another
[23:24] God not another being but the same being
[23:27] stepping into another form that our
[23:30] minds can start comprehending what is
[23:33] taking place all right so he steps over
[23:37] into another form called the word and he
[23:40] begins to create who the great eternal
[23:44] God seek begins to create in another
[23:53] form and is like I said to you over and
[23:56] over we went through the scriptures we
[23:58] brought it down from Genesis all the way
[24:00] the same God creator all the way through
[24:03] the word but is talking about the great
[24:06] eternal God within that great eternal
[24:08] God has made flesh among us all right
[24:11] now that flesh man Jesus he never
[24:14] created not because he was a creation
[24:19] himself all right
[24:22] see then I've told you over and over but
[24:24] yet been to look at it the father never
[24:27] created the he stepped into another form
[24:32] to reveal himself or condescend downward
[24:36] just like you are
[24:38] your father rather than your father
[24:41] all right now how would you say you know
[24:50] the Bible is full of dust saith the LORD
[24:52] right all right and we know that when it
[24:57] finally come to Jesus Christ he never
[24:58] said thus saith the Lord show and he was
[25:00] Almighty God all right now that's enough
[25:02] proof to prove it but he never said thus
[25:04] saith the Lord but all you prophets said
[25:06] thus saith the Lord why because God was
[25:12] using the vessels to speak and the
[25:18] Prophet was standing here I don't say
[25:21] looking Dehradun whatever but yet he was
[25:24] saying thus saith the Lord and other
[25:29] words God was speaking through him
[25:32] to bring it out but then we come over to
[25:37] David and Zion to showing that how great
[25:39] it would be
[25:40] see David would not say to us say the
[25:42] Lord David would say in the spirit he
[25:46] would say they pierced my hands and my
[25:48] feet or or saw them whenever was wanted
[25:50] was to do anything he would speak those
[25:53] things showing that it would eventually
[25:55] come in to a greater form because he we
[26:01] don't look in the Old Testament to find
[26:03] the Son of God because our human minds
[26:07] think of a time that he had to dwell on
[26:10] earth but that is the flesh man that
[26:15] inward man the soul does the often is we
[26:18] call it the inward part we'll get to
[26:20] that more today trying to describe it
[26:23] because what it is it's a word body it's
[26:28] a word form body
[26:29] that's worth for the Prophet all right
[26:32] it's simply God moving over into another
[26:34] one form and speaking but what's the
[26:39] difference then listen God says to a
[26:43] prophet you know go down and tell this
[26:48] go down till that go down and say this
[26:50] or that the Prophet goes down and he
[26:54] starts describing what's going to take
[26:56] place of Nineveh or whatever we're
[26:59] thinking on the sea and you know Jonah
[27:03] and he says looks back he tells this
[27:06] this this going on
[27:07] he said that's dust saith the Lord well
[27:13] you know what he has delivered to
[27:16] mankind the voice of Almighty God there
[27:21] is it right
[27:22] see that's why your prophet would say
[27:24] thus saith the Lord because it was it
[27:26] was not just saying to your mind that
[27:30] wouldn't work now had he moved over into
[27:34] a New Testament form you can get to the
[27:38] to that and understand it but as long as
[27:42] he's back darzee he's coming forth and
[27:45] he's using that
[27:46] say it the Lord meaning God is speaking
[27:52] through a vessel God speaking see
[27:58] through a vessel but then to show you
[28:01] what it was going to turn out to be and
[28:05] you never thought of this why would he
[28:06] come forthwith with David and M speaking
[28:10] in the first person I mean that's a
[28:15] wonderful thing see that moves a little
[28:19] closer than thus saith the Lord David
[28:25] didn't say thus saith the Lord they
[28:26] pierced my hands and my feet
[28:28] no David in the spirit spoke of what
[28:33] would take place meaning the son of God
[28:39] now listen because I'm trying to express
[28:41] something to you meaning the son of god
[28:44] was back there speaking through the
[28:51] prophets of the dust at the Lord now
[28:57] watch this in a minute and it'll open
[28:59] that wild prophet would say something
[29:01] why would he say he said we see mount 70
[29:06] he said but then we see no more of
[29:08] melchester day he said because
[29:10] melchester day become
[29:12] Jesus Christ no charity become Jesus
[29:21] Christ is that another person no we got
[29:24] to keep the same thought all right all
[29:26] right see God begins to condescend and
[29:30] reveal itself and as he does see those
[29:34] prophets would say thus saith the Lord
[29:36] but then it would move into a little
[29:39] higher form with David and Solomon
[29:42] enough and they would prophesy our speed
[29:45] as though they were the very one that
[29:51] was talking and David didn't say you
[29:54] know well they'll pierce his feet
[29:59] no he said they pierced my hands and my
[30:04] feet just like it was happening to him
[30:08] well you know what in spirit it was it
[30:14] was happening that's what David would
[30:18] say by the spirit the Lord said unto my
[30:24] lord the big doctrine in the message now
[30:30] called to lords but you know what I
[30:32] never didn't hear that person use that
[30:34] thought I'm honest as can be
[30:36] I never heard I heard a lot of the
[30:38] messages of the brother trying to
[30:40] understand what he was talking about but
[30:41] I never heard him try to use that form
[30:43] see because it's not to lords see the
[30:49] Lord said unto my lord this is the Lord
[30:53] this is the Lord it's just a cordon
[30:55] who's talking same person just another
[31:00] form we're familiar with the word sin
[31:03] morphe the terms we talk that means
[31:07] change in form but not change in person
[31:11] no change in personality but change in
[31:16] form to make itself known all right as I
[31:20] said those prophets they would you keep
[31:25] gonna pray for me because this thing's
[31:27] bothering me then he says I got
[31:30] pneumonia I on a map Omonia but not know
[31:33] you have a lot of oh but listen thinking
[31:44] about the great eternal God to reveal
[31:49] himself and the way he done it he could
[31:53] never do it any other way so he would
[31:58] come down he would become the word he
[32:03] would create and the things would take
[32:06] place but then he wouldn't leave that's
[32:09] why I love that statement to prophet
[32:11] made it he
[32:12] really really shoulder thing that when
[32:16] he said when he created man said even
[32:17] though he's sinned he said he never went
[32:20] back off and left him I love that he
[32:25] said he'd come right down to live with
[32:27] us what in a sinful condition to live
[32:36] with us not to Quall somewheres else has
[32:38] been me and you we didn't throw the
[32:40] thing down and walk out wouldn't what
[32:43] think about it all right she's in those
[32:47] prophets as they'd say thus saith the
[32:49] Lord he meant God was using the vessel
[32:52] to speak forth well do you know what the
[32:54] words they say it now listen I slow it
[33:00] down a little bit okay the words those
[33:04] prophets said I'm asking you a question
[33:11] was not that word just as much a part of
[33:15] God as it would be if God said himself
[33:20] are you listening he's not that word no
[33:25] matter if it spoke by donkey or a bird
[33:32] they don't change the word the word is
[33:36] real and see how close those prophets
[33:40] were to the eternal God then as I said
[33:44] to show that it was going to change and
[33:45] come power David will say they pierced
[33:49] my hands and my feet that's a higher
[33:51] form or a greater understanding than it
[33:54] would be to say they're gonna pierce his
[33:58] feet and it was thus saith the Lord you
[33:59] know he didn't say it that way alright
[34:05] now getting the point of seeing how that
[34:08] he condescended God Himself condescended
[34:14] to reveal himself to mankind now if you
[34:21] rejected the words of those prophets
[34:25] would there be any difference in the
[34:28] rejection of the words of a prophet than
[34:31] to reject the words of God himself if he
[34:33] was standing there would it be any
[34:35] different see what that's all we think
[34:42] we don't see God well that bald head
[34:44] going up lowball head you know what I've
[34:48] always said about that who was the one
[34:49] that kept telling us their kids and the
[34:52] kids when I turned talking about old
[34:54] bald head who was that mom and daddy
[34:56] almond daddy's one calling him ol ball
[34:58] here called mom and daddy didn't believe
[35:00] God was speaking through the man oh yeah
[35:03] every once in a while he gets it good
[35:05] because when he rides on me right when
[35:09] he brags on me that's God but said when
[35:11] he tells me that I'm doing wrong that's
[35:13] not God
[35:15] well I didn't know God changed that much
[35:17] but anyhow getting the point that that
[35:25] eternal God begin to condescend downward
[35:30] and as he moved in he became the word
[35:35] and then he could say let there be all
[35:40] right
[35:41] let there be and things would come into
[35:43] being who've the word now who was that
[35:46] word now come on let me ask you this for
[35:50] it makes a statement how many years it
[35:53] allow you been here and hear me made it
[35:55] what is the new birth what is the new
[36:01] birth and many times you heard me
[36:02] explain that for it's the birth of the
[36:07] word right it's the word made alive oh
[36:13] no it's you Gibson it's just see that's
[36:16] where you you're still open a costal the
[36:20] new birth is a birth of the word well I
[36:23] keep that thought in mind for a minute
[36:25] if it's the birth of the word then you
[36:27] see how it comes from glory and you'll
[36:29] see why Jesus said what he said cuz in
[36:34] plain language when he said to Nicodemus
[36:35] you must be born again you know what
[36:38] brother Brown
[36:38] he said they're right he said you must
[36:41] be born original says you must be born
[36:44] from above where I was born from that's
[36:50] really what he was saying to Nicodemus
[36:52] all right coming in to a form that we
[36:57] talked about it's called the word all
[37:00] right
[37:00] and as that word came down that that
[37:03] word would be the offspring of God you
[37:10] were thinking while ago about the new
[37:12] birth is being a birth of the word so
[37:13] why not think about the birth of the
[37:14] word would be God birthing himself in
[37:16] you as a son and daughter of God all
[37:21] right
[37:21] see not God the Son
[37:26] that's trinitarianism but the son of God
[37:33] see we're still we had that you know we
[37:36] believed God the Father God the Son and
[37:39] God the Holy Ghost no there's no such
[37:45] thing in the Bible within the Bible
[37:47] there is no son of God and see that's
[37:53] where we don't keep our thinking in the
[37:56] right order when we talk about son we
[37:58] think about the beginning and we try to
[38:00] figure out some beginning instead of
[38:02] thinking about the condescending of
[38:04] Almighty God down word that we could see
[38:08] in and he would reveal himself to us and
[38:11] it would be the word now when I talk
[38:18] about the word you don't you'll get it
[38:20] in a minute so I'm gonna let here in a
[38:21] hurry when I'm talking about word of God
[38:24] I'm not talking about dead letters on
[38:25] the page now Paul's done made that plain
[38:27] the letter killeth right but the Spirit
[38:31] gives life so I'm not talking about dead
[38:33] letters on the page now I ain't talking
[38:35] about something you read I'm talking
[38:37] about something that when it's made
[38:38] alive to you then you are seeing that
[38:41] Almighty God just as real as it would be
[38:44] if you were standing before the
[38:45] foundation world dwelling with him
[38:49] all right we'll see it's not God the son
[38:52] but the son of God in other words the
[38:55] word made alive make it now listen let's
[38:59] hold it to his part for a while see it's
[39:03] not God the Son we don't believe in
[39:05] eternal son ships and all different
[39:06] things like that all right well we
[39:09] believe that God himself
[39:12] reveals himself in another form called a
[39:16] son now why would it be called a son
[39:25] because you got to figure out some way
[39:27] to get his children here and I have to
[39:32] put that in because it is what am I
[39:34] going to say why would it be called the
[39:36] son God why wouldn't it just call the
[39:41] word see we could get by if it was
[39:49] called the word we could get by with
[39:51] using the terminologies of mankind but
[39:55] remember I invite you if you got a
[39:58] Scofield Bible I invite you to go back
[40:01] to the creation and even read what he
[40:04] says when he says the son of God was the
[40:09] word see the son of God is not a
[40:14] beginning of a God he never had in the
[40:17] beginning so why would you have the
[40:19] second person to have a beginning or the
[40:21] third or whatever he never had no
[40:23] beginning it's the same God as he
[40:26] reveals himself as he makes himself
[40:30] known in another form and he's called
[40:35] the word now you're to John 1 in the
[40:39] beginning was the word with God remember
[40:41] though 1 Genesis I mean John 1 is back
[40:45] for the foundational world you transfer
[40:48] it down to Genesis 1 and then it says
[40:50] God created heaven the earth now you're
[40:52] bringing it down to tense abilities
[40:53] we're we've been all of this time for
[40:56] months now still up in heaven and we're
[40:58] trying to condescend a little bit
[41:00] downward now and as we condescend
[41:02] downward to
[41:03] and we're talking about the world as it
[41:05] was back there which was the Son of God
[41:10] not if he had a beginning it's the same
[41:13] God we talk about Jesus being a son of
[41:18] God right no he was not just a son of
[41:23] God as another person he was that God
[41:26] made manifest in another form the same
[41:32] God but I'll make this statement or you
[41:39] can think about it there's a whole lot
[41:41] more to this than just what we say who
[41:45] did Jesus pray to and then we say who do
[41:48] you pray to
[41:51] there was a communication gap between
[41:54] see that's where I hold it and people
[41:57] don't want to follow that line don't
[41:59] bring that father out of heaven yeah but
[42:03] you're a tunas mm-hmm don't bring that
[42:08] father out of heaven and it even change
[42:12] your form and come down and kind of send
[42:15] down through those forms but yet he
[42:19] himself stays the great eternal or else
[42:23] how are you gonna call Jesus a great
[42:25] eternal God if you don't condescend
[42:28] slowly okay watch now all right see
[42:31] Jesus was now watching Jesus then was
[42:36] the son of God not God the Son he was
[42:40] the son of God the word made alive
[42:42] making him by the word being alive
[42:45] making him the son of God are a child of
[42:52] God generally no problems with that I
[42:57] could take the same person and keep
[42:59] descending and don't have any problems
[43:05] because see you buy the new birds will
[43:09] get down into you become a child of God
[43:13] but you're not another God you'd the
[43:16] same God made manifest as a child may I
[43:20] quote brother Branham I did the other
[43:24] day there
[43:25] he said dar he was like a child play in
[43:29] before the father's door in the creation
[43:33] instead he said let her be and that
[43:37] comes forth he said like a child there's
[43:43] no trouble using those terminologies but
[43:45] yet he was still believing it correct
[43:47] all right see all right
[43:51] not another person but the same God that
[43:57] was in heaven is now condescending
[44:01] toward earth we're beginning to
[44:04] gradually move out of the Eternity sin
[44:08] bringing it to war to earth
[44:10] all right see then the son of God was
[44:14] the father in another form called a son
[44:22] I'm quoting brother Branham the father
[44:30] me may he manifest himself in another
[44:39] form and you can call him a son of God
[44:44] because any child of God is this child
[44:47] of God her son and daughter of God all
[44:52] right see now John one should be
[44:58] becoming more clearer unto us because
[45:04] that son the Prophet we gave them back
[45:06] there the other day questions and
[45:08] answers on Hebrews that God begin to
[45:16] move out into another form
[45:18] called a son and then he could create
[45:21] see now you can hold your scriptures
[45:24] correctly
[45:25] God created Genesis God created this God
[45:28] created God Chris and then it comes over
[45:30] said ever it created all things by Jesus
[45:31] Christ well you know what he's like I
[45:35] trying to do that last Sunday then that
[45:37] means one thing for certain to me that
[45:41] person I'm talking about is God I was
[45:45] trying to prove he was God in the
[45:47] beginning of doing the creation and it
[45:48] was guarding and he was creating a body
[45:55] a rod he's still created he's creating
[46:01] us a new body not a new like another
[46:05] he's making this body new see that way
[46:10] we coming to the understanding all right
[46:14] brother Brown said on the message who is
[46:16] God he said out of the bosom of the
[46:20] Father came the son what not he stayed
[46:29] up here another one over here and that's
[46:30] moving over there he just changes his
[46:33] form to reveal himself to whatever form
[46:39] he wants to do and he would have to
[46:41] condescend to Word to speech because the
[46:45] word low-cost and think it means speech
[46:47] breath right Jesus comes over in his
[46:51] Bible I'm in darkness scripture and he
[46:53] breathed on the disciples and says
[46:56] receive ye the Holy Ghost they didn't
[47:00] get it right then they didn't get it
[47:01] till the day of Pentecost but yet he
[47:03] breathed on them now would he would they
[47:06] have ever been a Pentecost if he hadn't
[47:09] to breathe these are four units and they
[47:13] let down and you ain't got no leg to
[47:16] stand on now you don't understand it
[47:19] because see once he said that that
[47:21] proved he was the creator god when he
[47:25] breathed on them disciples he spoke them
[47:30] into exists
[47:31] has to become the children of God and he
[47:35] spoke you and I into the same existence
[47:38] they would have to go to Pentecost and
[47:40] get the word breath word that they had
[47:46] held made alive right they become a
[47:51] children of God okay
[47:52] now then we covered that in Romans 1 and
[47:57] 8 the Bible says that he was declared to
[48:01] be the Son of God with power he was
[48:09] declared to be the son of God
[48:12] now can we get into a thought brother
[48:14] branham made and you have to listen real
[48:17] careful he says now he said there's no
[48:19] scripture where he called himself son
[48:20] God now I'm quoting from one message
[48:24] right he said there's no scripture and
[48:29] he was called himself son of God see he
[48:31] called himself son of man and that's
[48:37] exactly right
[48:39] because the son of man was that man
[48:41] flesh that was standing there but the
[48:45] Bible would say he was declared to be
[48:46] the Son of God then brother Branham
[48:48] comes along later what about him what
[48:50] about a prophet they would make a
[48:52] statement he makes a statement of it he
[48:56] says in other words show me the
[48:57] scripture he says where Jesus ever said
[48:59] he was a son God he comes on he holds
[49:06] that thought he's right and he says see
[49:10] that he said you say well where did they
[49:14] get the you say from him saying it he
[49:18] said you say that Jesus never declared
[49:21] himself to be the Son of God he said see
[49:23] there he did because he was the word now
[49:28] that is that a direct contradiction
[49:34] now because he never declared himself to
[49:37] be the Son of God when he was declared
[49:39] himself to be the Son of man but yet all
[49:42] the way through he was declared even to
[49:45] the king
[49:45] you know he said what was it he said
[49:47] unto this end was I born he said in
[49:51] other words not born to be the son of
[49:52] God and see you say well you deal with
[49:57] me and you said what brother Dale you
[49:59] just confused
[50:00] no I didn't confuse you but you got
[50:04] brother Brown saying one day that he
[50:05] can't call him this on the block then he
[50:07] got another was served where he did call
[50:08] him song God so evidently a lot of
[50:11] people didn't understand what he wasn't
[50:13] saying okay
[50:15] get the thought declared to be the Son
[50:18] of God the power and the resurrection it
[50:24] says in that scripture all right he was
[50:27] declared to be the Son of God with the
[50:30] three Hebrew children because he was the
[50:32] preserver he was not the son of man in
[50:36] that situation and the king said we told
[50:39] one a43 announcer now these four and
[50:42] said one of them looks like the son of
[50:43] God because like I've always said hey
[50:46] the guy had a little sense he looked
[50:49] down in there and he saw forward he
[50:50] needed a third three in and he looks
[50:52] back and he says where did that other
[50:54] guy come from and said if that thing so
[50:56] hot it burns up and killed him out here
[50:58] and who's been protecting these people
[51:00] all night long and said he can't be
[51:02] nothing but just gonna go you know what
[51:07] he was declaring to be Almighty God come
[51:11] on King was declaring him to be the
[51:15] Almighty God not just a son of God
[51:17] couldn't you if he could see him he was
[51:20] seeing something and he the could see it
[51:23] he'd have to call it a son come on
[51:29] church but the Bible said and we're
[51:33] still with him trying to converse in the
[51:35] Bible said God want to read what the
[51:37] prophet said here in just a minute
[51:38] in Colossians it says in him dwelt the
[51:42] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[51:47] in him who the flesh man dwelt the
[51:53] fullness of the Godhead bodily right
[51:57] that was Almighty God the Creator that I
[52:02] told you there was talking about Sunday
[52:03] that Peter said thou art the Christ the
[52:08] Son of the Living God he was saying you
[52:11] are the Creator God there is no other
[52:14] god beside you Peter when when he said
[52:19] that Jesus said well you didn't get the
[52:21] whole story about the Son of Man but
[52:24] said you got enough to build a church on
[52:25] the church is built on the revelation of
[52:28] Jesus Christ being what one true and
[52:31] living God
[52:32] listen called the word called the son he
[52:42] didn't have any problems then we
[52:45] shouldn't have any problems why because
[52:50] of knowing the way he came now listen to
[52:52] the way he came then we'll read it I
[52:55] know ain't gonna get to it that's
[52:56] alright Jesus Christ the word created
[53:06] all things you go with me so that means
[53:10] you had to be Almighty God so we don't
[53:13] believe in such a persons or a son and
[53:15] eternal son ships or anything we believe
[53:17] in God making himself manifest in many
[53:20] forms our ways just as we are any many
[53:24] forms in ways and the Bible says even
[53:26] the eternal Godhead can be understood by
[53:29] the things that we see you're a father
[53:31] you're human you're a son you're your
[53:34] grandfather you're what you know just
[53:37] looking at ourselves and see Almighty
[53:39] God come into clarity to where we can
[53:42] understand alright but now think about
[53:45] it he came as the creator the word
[53:53] now watch him now who is the creator
[53:57] word the son of God now God the Son not
[54:03] another person the son of God the word
[54:07] was back there to create right and Paul
[54:14] could call him Jesus Christ because he
[54:21] knew that the flesh was not to point you
[54:23] done that but it was the Christ but he
[54:26] knew Jesus was Almighty God made
[54:32] manifest in another form called the son
[54:38] now watch the way he the sins he creates
[54:47] he does all the things he's back there
[54:51] he's back to her in a mighty way are you
[54:55] falling with me he was there in a mighty
[54:56] way who was it that pulled the skins off
[54:59] of those animals and throw them back
[55:00] guard for Adam and Eve to put on well
[55:06] I'm trying to get you to see how it
[55:08] really is no he just a spirit on plain
[55:13] language spirits can't pull skin off you
[55:16] got to get something a little more
[55:17] tangible right all right so who was that
[55:25] that stood in the garden who was that it
[55:29] came down each day in the garden
[55:32] and talked with his children who was
[55:38] that that when sin entered the picture
[55:40] he didn't run off and leave them he come
[55:46] down and he pulled the skin off the
[55:48] manimals well yeah I've always believed
[55:52] God and I make it real I would've gone I
[55:57] could make him so real you could see him
[55:58] standing here
[56:01] if you ever see him by the our faith you
[56:05] will see more about how tangible he is
[56:07] when I saw him at 11 years old I had no
[56:10] problems understanding and knowing
[56:11] something real was standing there I've
[56:16] seen him since then a lot of times okay
[56:18] all right that's why I don't have no
[56:21] problem you can believe it if you want
[56:23] to that's nothing to me because it ain't
[56:25] gonna put no feather in my hat and
[56:29] you're not gonna believe it unless God
[56:31] reveals it was listening to at a place
[56:33] not where brother Branham was talking
[56:34] about as he's called the house and he
[56:37] was talking about the people and he said
[56:40] but they can't believe it that's what he
[56:45] said he said what they can't believe it
[56:51] he's a prophet telling people it's like
[56:55] why he was bringing out the other night
[56:56] you know the word brother brother said
[56:58] it's gone from you there's no way for
[57:00] you to know it I said right around to
[57:04] coming to the Lord what's it's gone from
[57:10] you well what about all the people
[57:12] sitting there I know what he's talking
[57:13] about
[57:13] why don't I got it he's just gone from
[57:18] you oh that was some secret thing that
[57:23] he was to know okay it's gone from me
[57:26] no problem no troubles it still signs on
[57:29] me it's gone from all right listen
[57:35] then the word was the Creator so he
[57:43] condescended down from being the great
[57:48] eternal in the word form now watch him
[57:54] tell you what that word form is and then
[57:57] you'll understand more about the message
[57:59] so let's pick that thought up with her
[58:00] brothers we'll go over to to number two
[58:05] okay let's pick up number two on the
[58:10] notes
[58:11] this is taken and this will be for most
[58:13] of it will be taken from who's this
[58:15] Melchizedek and watch him now in the
[58:21] beginning God dwelt along with his
[58:23] attributes as I spoke of this morning
[58:25] that's his thoughts as I said you know
[58:28] that's this house there was nothing just
[58:30] God alone but he had thoughts just like
[58:33] a Great Architect can sit down in his
[58:35] mind and draw out what do you think it's
[58:37] he's going to to bill create now he's
[58:41] talking about the architect he cannot
[58:42] create he can take something that's been
[58:44] created and make it out of different not
[58:45] like that but he gets in his mind what
[58:47] he wants all right that's not the way
[58:49] with God
[58:49] see that's what's out then it's he
[58:51] speaks it that's the architect guy all
[58:54] right he's the word then I thought when
[58:56] it's expressed is the word now we get
[58:58] into God I thought Express is a word but
[59:01] it has to be a thought first so it's
[59:03] God's attributes then it becomes a
[59:05] thought then a word notice those who
[59:09] have eternal life was with him and in
[59:11] him in his thinking before there wasn't
[59:13] even an angel of fear of him or anything
[59:15] that's eternal if you have eternal life
[59:19] he always was not your being here but to
[59:22] shape and form that the infinite God
[59:24] okay not our beings are doing all the
[59:28] things okay drop one over now okay let's
[59:34] see now go ahead number four can we pick
[59:39] up that point I just want you to get
[59:42] this four we get through go ahead to
[59:43] number four word right still taken who
[59:47] it is Melchizedek paragraph 64 just a
[59:49] continual reading garden desist this
[59:52] stage of his creation later formed into
[59:54] flesh Jesus know from what from the
[59:58] great beginning spirit then he came down
[1:00:00] to be the word bringing itself out the
[1:00:04] word doesn't yet make itself listen it's
[1:00:07] just spoke out in morphe later he
[1:00:11] becomes flesh now watch that in a minute
[1:00:14] you've got two thousand years from the
[1:00:19] beginning creation to come to Jesus
[1:00:21] Christ
[1:00:23] kinda watch him later he becomes flesh
[1:00:27] Jesus Mortal to taste that for all of us
[1:00:29] sinners when abraham met him he was
[1:00:31] Melchizedek he unfolds here what all the
[1:00:36] attributes will do in the final in ever
[1:00:39] son of Abraham ever son of the faith
[1:00:43] will absolutely do the same thing but I
[1:00:46] want you to watch how we have to come
[1:00:51] now think about it you know that Abraham
[1:00:55] met the word
[1:01:00] Abraham met God in theophany the word
[1:01:10] now he said ever some of the faith would
[1:01:14] have to do the same now we're not going
[1:01:20] up into heaven and God set us down teach
[1:01:25] us a whole lot we better get the idea
[1:01:28] and write this down here is worse gonna
[1:01:30] take place right
[1:01:32] I think do what he wants to when he gets
[1:01:34] dire but we got to get there first so we
[1:01:37] got to get something here to get us dire
[1:01:38] is that plain enough how about ever son
[1:01:42] of the faith meeting Melchizedek that's
[1:01:48] what he said he said every son in the
[1:01:52] faith would do the same as Abraham what
[1:01:55] did they round me
[1:01:56] why did brethren spend all of that time
[1:01:58] and people saying you mean to tell me
[1:02:01] now that that Melchizedek was God he
[1:02:06] said it was Almighty God right Abraham I
[1:02:15] don't talk to him
[1:02:17] fellowship with him but one day he met
[1:02:21] him and Gudrun said he met him in he saw
[1:02:29] him and theophany
[1:02:32] read who is this melt shattered if you
[1:02:34] will and read it over and over and over
[1:02:37] see you I don't get that part but that's
[1:02:41] alright yes you'll do it because you'll
[1:02:43] do it anyway you won't go read what I
[1:02:44] asked you to read and then you're
[1:02:47] confused about what I say about what he
[1:02:50] said well at least if you read what he
[1:02:53] said you would know I said what he said
[1:02:56] right I mean at least you'd know that
[1:03:00] you'd have to say what he thought he
[1:03:02] said that but if you don't go look it up
[1:03:06] you don't know whether he said it or not
[1:03:09] you guess an editor trying to hit on
[1:03:12] this but if you go read it well you're
[1:03:18] just reading it the way you won't read
[1:03:19] nothing
[1:03:20] okay I guess I can read this away and
[1:03:23] you can read this away I thought John
[1:03:26] was John I thought cat was kid I thought
[1:03:29] there was 20 how many 26 letters in the
[1:03:31] alphabet and it takes all of them to
[1:03:34] make all these words on this page that's
[1:03:39] why I see I print them out and give them
[1:03:41] to you you know yourself what most of
[1:03:45] the preachers do come on one of these
[1:03:48] days you'll wise up a lot of them quotes
[1:03:51] you what Brett around said but there's
[1:03:54] not verbatim a lot of it's not verbatim
[1:03:58] a lot of it is what they think he said
[1:04:05] at least I tell you give it to you where
[1:04:10] you can read it okay what you do with it
[1:04:13] after then if you ain't got enough to go
[1:04:15] home and look up and listen to a message
[1:04:17] of who is this melchester dick but you
[1:04:21] know what do we do now I'm not throwing
[1:04:23] off on her brother I loved him but I
[1:04:26] made a statement one time I said see
[1:04:29] there we need to read a message you know
[1:04:36] in him titled mastered yo who's this Mel
[1:04:38] Chad we need to read the book you know
[1:04:40] what the brother got mad at me about
[1:04:43] he got mad at me because that I said we
[1:04:46] need to read it and he said I was
[1:04:50] throwing off on him because he couldn't
[1:04:52] read you say people won't do it you're
[1:04:57] sitting there doing it right now letting
[1:05:00] those little boogers get on your
[1:05:01] shoulder and talk to you about what with
[1:05:07] the brother he was mad at me for cause
[1:05:09] that I said we need to read it you know
[1:05:14] what I meant everybody else did but
[1:05:17] seeing he did too but he used it as an
[1:05:21] excuse to not listen to the tapes or get
[1:05:28] somebody else to read it you think
[1:05:29] people won't do that listen but what is
[1:05:35] he excuse me he unfolds
[1:05:40] whatever attribute will do it's what we
[1:05:46] just read he unfolds when speaking of
[1:05:48] Abraham of whatever attributes would do
[1:05:51] Abraham met Melchizedek served him bread
[1:05:57] and wine and sit down and talk to him
[1:06:00] and that was Almighty God in a form
[1:06:07] called a theophany that's your prophets
[1:06:10] words all right what kind of a man was
[1:06:17] that what kind of a man did he meet
[1:06:23] prophet said he met Almighty God well
[1:06:30] what is your new birth is it not the
[1:06:33] birth of the work which is almighty god
[1:06:36] okay listen let's go to number five
[1:06:40] brother we don't get we'll get a few of
[1:06:44] these time
[1:06:49] paragraph 67 going on through a little
[1:06:52] bit now we see the attribute sons of
[1:06:56] your spirit have not yet entered into
[1:07:00] the word form body now what is it
[1:07:04] theophany soul of an individual and what
[1:07:11] is the soul of an individual it's the
[1:07:17] body you go to when you die all right
[1:07:26] sinners have that we've been through all
[1:07:28] of that but Christians have eternal
[1:07:32] theophany so it's a lot differs from the
[1:07:36] Christian in the center so you were to
[1:07:38] define that out of what we're reading we
[1:07:40] yet leave it at town now we see the
[1:07:42] attributes sons of his spirit have not
[1:07:44] yet entered into the word form body we
[1:07:47] was not born in Word form body
[1:07:51] I've spent the whole message to declare
[1:07:53] one thing he came one way we're gonna
[1:07:58] come another way cuz he never came into
[1:08:03] world to be tempted he said oh the Bible
[1:08:07] said he was tempted in all points
[1:08:08] he never came into the world to be
[1:08:10] tempted he came in the world
[1:08:12] that's Christ himself eternal God Adam
[1:08:16] and mankind came
[1:08:19] to be tempted he said we'll wait a
[1:08:22] minute Adam here to eternal life yeah he
[1:08:24] had eternal life but he had a natural
[1:08:26] body that he could be tempted and he was
[1:08:28] and he fell okay so we're talking about
[1:08:33] how God comes then Adam will come and
[1:08:36] then we will come right that the
[1:08:41] three-point but who is he now
[1:08:44] well you and I have it to come that what
[1:08:49] a theophany this body is subject to the
[1:08:51] world an earthly waiting for the earnest
[1:08:53] change of the body
[1:08:54] in other words when we go we go back now
[1:08:56] watch the difference between him and you
[1:08:58] as a son now there's a difference
[1:09:04] between Jesus Christ and you and me as a
[1:09:08] son okay is that words the difference
[1:09:15] between him and you as a son see he was
[1:09:20] at the beginning the word any morphe
[1:09:26] body
[1:09:28] he came and lived in that he Jesus
[1:09:33] Christ Almighty God came and lived in
[1:09:37] that in morphe body as who milchester
[1:09:45] day he appeared to Moses in the burning
[1:09:49] boat he appeared in many forms right he
[1:09:53] appeared many times to many ones in the
[1:09:55] Old Testament right
[1:09:57] what is Almighty God to watch you see he
[1:10:01] was at the beginning he Jesus Christ was
[1:10:04] at the beginning the word in the morphe
[1:10:06] body
[1:10:07] he came and lived in that in the person
[1:10:09] of Melchizedek there's he son god
[1:10:13] there's he'll oh gosh there's he
[1:10:14] theophany there's all the terminologies
[1:10:16] back in the Old Testament
[1:10:19] you have a brother Dale he never was the
[1:10:22] son of God till he come into the new
[1:10:23] test i sweatin what he said so I'm gonna
[1:10:27] listen what he said you play all you
[1:10:30] want to look look what he said he came
[1:10:36] in and lived in that in the personal
[1:10:38] male charity then later we never heard
[1:10:43] no more of melchizedek why why did you
[1:10:49] never hear anymore of melchizedek I'm
[1:10:57] asking you a simple question
[1:10:59] I love questions I love to ask them
[1:11:03] brother brother kind of got me one time
[1:11:06] he said he's in a meeting of that
[1:11:10] misters meeting and I got up and asked a
[1:11:13] question I love you was sitting there
[1:11:16] that day brother got up behind me he
[1:11:18] said I hate for a man to ask the
[1:11:20] question said when he was the only man
[1:11:23] in the building had the answer I said I
[1:11:26] would not ask the question if I hadn't
[1:11:29] had the answer
[1:11:30] I stood that way the answer they had to
[1:11:35] agree when it was finished that's why I
[1:11:37] got out he's a lifer that's a man a
[1:11:39] question and he's the only one in the
[1:11:41] building got the answer you brag all you
[1:11:44] want to listen then later we never heard
[1:11:52] no more about yesterday
[1:11:55] why because Melchizedek became Jesus
[1:12:01] Christ now let me ask you a question was
[1:12:08] Mel Chadwick God brother now brother
[1:12:13] branham spent a whole message declared
[1:12:14] that Melchizedek was Almighty God all
[1:12:18] right then when he went into Jesus
[1:12:23] Christ who was he a second person or a
[1:12:25] third one no it was the same God stepped
[1:12:28] into another form what was the
[1:12:30] difference in Jesus and Melchizedek
[1:12:33] Melchisedec was spoke into existence the
[1:12:36] flesh God stepped into it and come to
[1:12:40] live and be that all right come on now
[1:12:43] his body was not at the Alpha knee part
[1:12:47] because the Alpha knees don't eat in
[1:12:49] that man that Melchizedek the flesh man
[1:12:53] ate all right so then the flesh man
[1:12:57] wouldn't God the flesh man was a
[1:13:00] creation of God to step into right
[1:13:04] full-grown man
[1:13:06] Melchizedek could not die for your sins
[1:13:11] but he became Jesus Christ to be able to
[1:13:14] die what a baby to fulfill the scripture
[1:13:19] is born of a woman a flesh born of a
[1:13:22] woman created by the prophets of the
[1:13:25] word they had brought and God stepped
[1:13:29] into that flesh what was the difference
[1:13:32] in Melchizedek in Jesus they looked
[1:13:34] alike never didn't leave cause brother
[1:13:38] I'm the one who said it he said Abraham
[1:13:41] saw a male chastity but the off in the
[1:13:45] form of God he said Moses sawmill - I
[1:13:48] saw the off in the form of God
[1:13:51] so who's Moses see he saw melted it it's
[1:13:54] just not listed at that point Lots now
[1:13:56] come on we're getting to where we're at
[1:13:57] we're gonna quit in the minute
[1:14:01] then later we never heard no more of
[1:14:03] Melchisedec so he just goes off the
[1:14:06] scene we hear no more of him he's really
[1:14:08] disappear you know he didn't disappear
[1:14:13] he just hung around a little while and
[1:14:15] come in another form come on that's my
[1:14:19] whole story of trying to get you to see
[1:14:21] God condescending is a great eternal
[1:14:24] changing in form not changing gods look
[1:14:29] because he became Jesus Christ
[1:14:31] Melchizedek watch him was the priest
[1:14:40] but he became Jesus Christ what all the
[1:14:47] fulfillment of the Bible advocate healer
[1:14:49] savior deliverer this whatever you want
[1:14:52] to name him he became all of that the
[1:14:54] Alpha and Omega the beginning and the
[1:14:55] end
[1:14:55] Mel shattered it was the priest that's
[1:14:57] why it's called the priest of the Most
[1:14:59] High God he was the priest back there to
[1:15:06] help him but he wasn't the rest of it
[1:15:08] but he became Jesus Christ then watch
[1:15:12] him now you bypass that because in that
[1:15:19] form he knowed all things and you have
[1:15:22] never been able to know that yet we'll
[1:15:26] back up
[1:15:27] no minute but I want to stay up there
[1:15:28] with that but I'll get you come like
[1:15:30] Adam like me
[1:15:31] I remember brother trying to decide that
[1:15:34] one time because of the English major of
[1:15:37] the way the commas and things fell and
[1:15:40] he was trying to say that Adam come a
[1:15:41] different way well we know Adam coming
[1:15:45] every way he was a creation that's no
[1:15:46] problem you and I were in the creation
[1:15:49] we come from natural birth yeah he was
[1:15:52] trying to make it into a doctrinal
[1:15:53] listen you become from the attribute to
[1:15:58] the flesh to be tempted okay now we got
[1:16:00] to hold that right now because we just
[1:16:01] to the point of talking about Jesus so
[1:16:04] let's keep him here now who is he
[1:16:09] what is it theophany into the word form
[1:16:15] body a word form body a body formed by
[1:16:24] the word of the person and he became
[1:16:30] Jesus Christ and can be called a son of
[1:16:34] God God is not another God it's the same
[1:16:41] God he's the fulfillment of the Old
[1:16:43] Testament brought into the basis of
[1:16:46] seeing him standing on earth as the
[1:16:50] great eternal
[1:16:51] you need to say if you don't believe
[1:16:53] that I am he will die in your sins he
[1:16:55] said on my father one if you've seen me
[1:16:57] you've seen the father right cuz who was
[1:17:02] he
[1:17:02] he was the word come on brother he was
[1:17:06] the Word made flesh
[1:17:08] what is it theophany word body
[1:17:12] he said you bypass that will pick that
[1:17:14] part of why because it don't mean bypass
[1:17:17] like going around 285 because if you do
[1:17:20] you're gonna get hooked up with Perez I
[1:17:22] believe was his name wasn't the ball
[1:17:24] player and you're gonna go around and
[1:17:25] around and around and around and he
[1:17:27] couldn't find how to get off for that
[1:17:29] time right by Pais don't mean you got
[1:17:33] something you got to bypass you'll hold
[1:17:36] this till next Sunday's where we start
[1:17:38] talking by face simply means you never
[1:17:43] came that way you never came like him he
[1:17:53] came straight into word but you know
[1:17:57] what well he was there in word you and I
[1:17:59] was in him but just remember none of us
[1:18:05] can ever be all of God each one of us
[1:18:09] could be a part that we can never be all
[1:18:11] of God but he was all of God he was all
[1:18:16] of God he was the word body and the
[1:18:23] prophet uses irony uses word body later
[1:18:26] but he seemed to hear word form body a
[1:18:32] body formed by the word which is the
[1:18:38] word we never see Melchizedek no more
[1:18:43] why not why couldn't he be in other
[1:18:46] places in there no because he's changing
[1:18:50] his form to be Jesus Christ now listen
[1:18:56] what I'm saying your prophet said it
[1:18:59] Melchizedek and the Bible says that he
[1:19:02] was made after the order of
[1:19:04] a priesthood Jesus Christ was not just a
[1:19:10] priesthood he was a further development
[1:19:13] or unfolding of Almighty God from
[1:19:17] Melchizedek into Jesus Christ which
[1:19:23] would make him Almighty God and then he
[1:19:27] would be the fullness of the Godhead
[1:19:29] bodily bright but as a baby he could not
[1:19:35] die for your sins I'm no problem with
[1:19:38] these brothers that want to preach that
[1:19:40] Jesus wasn't God to the River Jordan
[1:19:41] he's still terminology they were used
[1:19:44] the wrong term he wasn't a full
[1:19:46] manifestation until the River Jordan
[1:19:47] there's no problem he said well maybe
[1:19:52] that's what they're saying well maybe it
[1:19:53] is but that wasn't what I heard but
[1:19:55] that's alright I'm accused we're not
[1:19:58] hearing too good anyway so don't worry
[1:19:59] about it but why do you see mouths as
[1:20:04] dick don't more in the Old Testament
[1:20:12] because he met Abraham who is the father
[1:20:16] of faith it's not meaning that God never
[1:20:20] appeared no more if you're to Moses he
[1:20:23] appeared many things after appearing to
[1:20:25] Abraham
[1:20:26] it's just meaning that Melchizedek was
[1:20:29] the high priest and you needed nothing
[1:20:35] else anymore
[1:20:36] because he was not going to be able to
[1:20:39] die for the people you needed him as
[1:20:42] high priest to make intercession right
[1:20:48] but when Jesus Christ came he was o
[1:20:52] mighty God but you know what you know
[1:20:59] what I love about it that's where you
[1:21:01] won this drivers crazy trying to
[1:21:03] understand on there you see one that
[1:21:06] says Jesus was the last form of God I
[1:21:09] differ with that the people of this
[1:21:11] message say Jesus was the last one I
[1:21:14] differ with them because the bride of
[1:21:17] Jesus Christ is the life form of God to
[1:21:21] the Gentiles then he transforms himself
[1:21:24] to the Jews in another in morphe so it's
[1:21:29] not over with it just comes to you and I
[1:21:33] to the greatest of all this thing what
[1:21:35] about it what is it theophany a word
[1:21:38] form body a body formed by the word it
[1:21:48] took those prophets to bring forth the
[1:21:51] body of Jesus Christ take any of them
[1:21:54] out and they would not work put them all
[1:21:58] together and let them bring their part
[1:22:00] they will they produce Jesus Christ John
[1:22:04] being the life to introduce him right
[1:22:09] you'll notice I don't remember John they
[1:22:14] were saying thus saith the Lord
[1:22:15] if I'm wrong on that you correct me to
[1:22:18] scripture but I'm not making the doctor
[1:22:19] in this making appointment John never
[1:22:22] said thus saith the Lord
[1:22:25] he was so close in his introductory till
[1:22:29] he said behold the lamb of God it takes
[1:22:33] away the sin of the world
[1:22:35] or what are you trying to say trying to
[1:22:38] make a simple of the point a prophet
[1:22:41] says thus saith the Lord that's God
[1:22:43] speaking through the prophet to mankind
[1:22:44] right David said they pierced my hands
[1:22:48] and my feet that son of God that was
[1:22:51] back there kept stepping in to mankind
[1:22:54] until he stepped in enough to say they
[1:22:57] pierced my hands and my feet why because
[1:23:00] he was Melchizedek but then you don't
[1:23:04] see him because you don't need you
[1:23:05] priest you're heading towards a
[1:23:07] priesthood there's a lot of difference
[1:23:09] in the priests and the priesthood Jesus
[1:23:13] Christ was all of the priesthood even
[1:23:15] everything because he was Almighty God
[1:23:18] listened called a son

[1:23:27] the Word of God what we got really
