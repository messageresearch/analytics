[31:01] let's say one more thing what is it Oh
[31:06] next Sunday sometime next Saturday of
[31:09] Sunday I want to meet with all the
[31:10] Sunday School teachers anybody that
[31:13] teaches Sunday School will try to figure
[31:16] out Saturday or Sunday one of the two
[31:18] days just for about 10 or 15 minutes
[31:20] and go over some things I was telling
[31:22] somebody the other day I don't want to
[31:25] use this loosely but this place has
[31:27] become like a submarine it's a long tube
[31:30] with two floors and a lot of people in
[31:33] it so they put thousands of people in a
[31:36] submarine and it's just a little round
[31:38] tube so we're gonna have to learn how to
[31:40] adjust and move and maybe one shift come
[31:43] out while the other shift comes in and
[31:46] but thank God and for what brother Dale
[31:51] was saying this morning I just want to
[31:53] add one thing to it is just we've never
[31:55] had this influx of young people number
[31:58] one and we've had you know 90 or 100
[32:01] come every once in a while and then it
[32:03] drew a little down to 50 or 60 or 75 but
[32:05] but we're clocking 90 to 100 ever
[32:08] service now so and I say this loosely
[32:11] that's the hundred problems like brother
[32:14] down and you know little church little
[32:15] problems big church big problem well we
[32:18] just we try to do the best we can with
[32:19] what we've got what I'm trying to say
[32:20] and we're trying our best to get
[32:23] together and move things around and
[32:25] figure out how we how will survive this
[32:28] submarine trip for about eight hours on
[32:29] a Sunday hey man so let's just all be
[32:33] sailors and let's all just move out of
[32:36] the way and let the other sailor go
[32:39] through we didn't quit uh standing
[32:40] around and we always like to stand down
[32:42] there right where you go into brother
[32:45] boy Sunday School class so regina's here
[32:48] she'd tell you she said I that's just a
[32:51] place everybody stands we don't we don't
[32:53] need to stand there and we need to move
[32:54] out of the way and let people do their
[32:56] job but god bless you let's go to Psalms
[32:59] 85 but we just need to bear with each
[33:04] other we're we're living in a time that
[33:09] I told you if all them people downstairs
[33:13] start coming in that we're praying
[33:15] diligently that they do then we will be
[33:18] having to have two services in morning
[33:22] and two in the afternoon I really
[33:23] doesn't bother me and I know it doesn't
[33:24] brother bother brother Dale to get
[33:27] everybody in here because we want to
[33:28] take this ship home
[33:30] and ships nothing without its members as
[33:34] ships nothing without the people in it
[33:35] it'll just float on its own and it'll
[33:38] kind of drift everywhere but if you've
[33:39] got somebody that's it - at the helm
[33:41] that knows where he's going knows what
[33:43] he's doing if you got people that are
[33:45] doing their job and doing what they're
[33:47] supposed to do then that ship will go
[33:48] exactly where that we that guard leads
[33:52] in in gaad's us - and it won't be a it

[38:02] it'll be very long today cuz we got a
[38:04] baptismal service and man I love
[38:07] baptismal services and you know what I I
[38:11] think that we might have another one we
[38:16] gonna give you plenty of time we got
[38:18] plenty of towels we're right there
[38:19] sister Lisa's house and she's so
[38:21] gracious to to let us get into the
[38:23] baptismal pool and I am sure we will
[38:27] find something for you to wear if you
[38:30] want to be baptized
[38:31] amen so you just think on these things
[38:33] and if you have a if you have a
[38:35] situation where you are not sure you
[38:38] need to get sure a man because this
[38:40] revival that we're talking about now
[38:42] sure it's not going to be a worldwide
[38:43] revivals and I'm gonna be a revival that
[38:45] that the whole world is gonna come to
[38:48] spoken word church with their cameras in
[38:50] there you're not gonna see WSB and and
[38:53] almost different trucks outside with
[38:55] their satellites on but these people are
[38:57] having
[38:58] that's not promised it's promised to be
[39:01] a secret but it will be a revival it
[39:05] will be something that you and I will
[39:07] benefit from looky brothers like black
[39:10] he's already benefited so let's all
[39:12] benefit from this let's all I you know
[39:15] there's many times before we I think
[39:17] brother Joe told me that that we didn't
[39:19] have any baptism in 2019 now may be
[39:22] wrong but I don't think we did but
[39:25] before that several years you'd have
[39:28] four or five and then you'd have a group
[39:30] of six and then you have a group of
[39:31] eight and then then you'd have a group
[39:33] that the three or four and then it would
[39:35] it was kind of Wayne you know and not
[39:38] have one for kind of bad that we went
[39:40] the whole year without having a
[39:41] baptismal service but still we're only
[39:44] eleven days in the tree into January and
[39:47] we got three coming up so God's on the
[39:49] move listen he's in his bride and his
[39:53] Brides gonna move with him because he is
[39:57] her headship he moves she moves with him
[40:01] how's that six one this is where I want
[40:04] to mmm we're gonna talk today a little
[40:06] bit about zeal who's there six one says
[40:09] come and let us return it to the Lord
[40:11] for heaith torn and he will heal us he
[40:14] hath smitten and he will bind us up
[40:17] after two days after two days after two
[40:20] thousand years Christ came on the earth
[40:22] two thousand years ago and brought us a
[40:25] message he brought us a revival that has
[40:28] been going on in the bride since the day
[40:32] of Pentecost all right and it's going on
[40:35] but when I would listen as we were
[40:37] talking last Wednesday night
[40:39] there's revivals that have come and then
[40:41] the revival fires started dying then God
[40:45] would bring another messenger and the
[40:47] revival fires would go back up again and
[40:49] then they would it was a cycle
[40:51] I don't ever forget brother and why I
[40:54] still remember this but brother Matthew
[40:58] Lord now from South Carolina
[41:04] Watkins Thank You Matthew Watkins about
[41:07] ten years ago came here and preached a
[41:08] sermon called cycle of a revival I don't
[41:10] know if you remember that or not but I
[41:12] did but that cycle is continuing on but
[41:15] listening we're not you and I we're
[41:17] after this two days we're after that
[41:20] promise of the two thousand years of one
[41:23] church age coming and a minister coming
[41:26] and then he brings his message and then
[41:28] then everybody dies off and all kind of
[41:30] isms and schisms get into the get into
[41:33] the church and then God sends somebody
[41:36] else to bring it back up and bring a
[41:38] revival and that was happy that happened
[41:40] seven or now eight times going after
[41:43] Pentecostal now this is not a cyclo folk
[41:47] we're either going down or we're going
[41:50] up and then there's not going to be
[41:53] that's another cycle to where we can
[41:55] throw this message to where well all I
[41:57] need to do is just half way live it
[41:59] because they somebody come in little
[42:02] this is it after two days he will revive
[42:07] us now Witney brother George Quinn same
[42:10] God's Word has to come to pass he spoke
[42:15] it and it has to come to pass so after
[42:18] two days will he revived us in the third
[42:20] day he will raise us up and we show
[42:23] living his site showing that this age is
[42:26] calling for a resurrection not a dying
[42:32] and somebody else coming there's not
[42:33] listen the next group to come is 144,000
[42:37] Jews that's the next group there is no
[42:40] other group coming that's God going to
[42:44] the Jews to to prophets so you and I
[42:46] can't throw it on to anybody else one
[42:51] more time take your finger like this
[42:53] whose problem is it right there you go
[42:59] because you're in the third day you're
[43:01] in that three you're after the 2000
[43:03] years you're in the time now this is not
[43:05] a cycle of revival this is it
[43:08] there's no cycle this is it you know you
[43:13] can cycle through a lot of things you
[43:14] can take clothes and run them through a
[43:15] cycle but there's got to be a time when
[43:17] you get them clothes out of the washing
[43:18] machine because they're clean and that's
[43:22] what we're looking at now let's read
[43:25] this number number one I took the other
[43:27] one out this is one that sister Esther
[43:28] Broughton I really appreciate that
[43:30] because what's what what's what brother
[43:32] brown this is recognizing your day in
[43:33] this message can everybody see that can
[43:39] you see it in the back cuz I want to
[43:41] read this all of us read it together
[43:43] okay now recognizing you're Dennis
[43:48] message brother branham is praying God
[43:53] created me or me a revival let me be the
[43:58] revival let each one of us be the
[44:01] revival the revival in me make me Lord
[44:06] to hunger make me Tudor's created me
[44:11] Lord that what is needed in me not your
[44:14] brother in me let me from this our own
[44:22] be done more consecrated servant a
[44:26] better servant more blessed of you more
[44:30] able more humbler more kinder
[44:33] more willing to work more looking to the
[44:36] things that are positive and forgetting
[44:39] the things that are in the past and the
[44:42] negatives hello let me press toward the
[44:46] mark of the high calling of Christ amen
[44:50] amen amen
[44:53] because that's exactly what we're
[44:55] looking at we are looking at this cycle
[44:57] of revival that is not going to cycle
[45:02] anymore everybody got that created me a
[45:10] revival I think the devil stole one of
[45:13] my one of my notes
[45:21] bhudev oh well whatever he did that's
[45:25] okay y'all got part of it in there
[45:27] anyway don't you I think I took a piece
[45:29] of it back there but listen what we're
[45:31] doing here why are we here that's my
[45:36] question why are we here we are here to
[45:39] number one as we were talking like this
[45:42] morning in the Sunday school class we
[45:44] are here to stay fortified behind the
[45:47] Word of God and then we are here to not
[45:51] cower down you bring number two up now
[45:54] cower down to the devil right we are
[45:59] here to stay because what happened to
[46:02] Eve and one de nieve didn't have the
[46:04] word she had the word she was fortified
[46:10] behind the word as long as she stayed
[46:12] there but what your brother Brown say
[46:15] Eve came out from behind the protection
[46:18] of the word and that's when Satan got
[46:20] her but now if we're gonna have a word
[46:22] revival then we got to get back behind
[46:25] that word regardless of what anybody
[46:29] says regardless of how you feel it
[46:32] didn't say how you feel it said do you
[46:35] believe amen so we've got to be a
[46:38] believing group of people let's read
[46:40] number two the angel of the Lord and
[46:43] when we see these crowds together and
[46:44] that doesn't mean revival that's just
[46:47] gathering but a revival is when people
[46:50] get really right with God
[46:52] and pray through that black prayed
[46:58] through what's our problem I'm more
[47:03] using because you know what hits fresh
[47:04] we love fresh meat we love things that
[47:08] are fresh
[47:09] we liked an influx of fresh people why
[47:12] because as we get older and God knows it
[47:15] as we get older we get more likes and we
[47:17] get more well you know but a revival is
[47:22] when people get really right with God
[47:24] and pray through and starts to a revival
[47:26] throughout the city and everything you
[47:28] see they put away sin put away their
[47:30] iniquity turn to God turn around and
[47:32] start back again going down the road
[47:34] let's go to number three
[47:38] resurrection of laughter brother I feel
[47:40] real good about it anyhow what this
[47:42] church needs today is a good revival not
[47:45] a new doctrine or a new order just the
[47:51] stirring up of what you already know
[47:53] about now listen like sister Kathy was
[47:57] though we were talking about revelation
[47:59] we've got it packed up here for years
[48:04] and maybe not for some but four years we
[48:07] got it packed up here you know God
[48:09] promised an eleventh-hour worker would
[48:11] get paid the same amount of money as
[48:13] somebody that worked 11 hours and he
[48:16] only worked one hour because that's the
[48:19] agreement that's what God dudes does the
[48:21] 11th hour worker when that 11th hour
[48:22] worker comes in God just packs it all in
[48:25] because he's not gonna leave you here
[48:26] for your child or of his but just as
[48:29] throwing up of what you already know
[48:31] about but let's get it from here down to
[48:34] here and I was telling sister Kathy
[48:36] really what happens is is you're not
[48:37] taking it from here to here the Holy
[48:44] Ghost is down here reaching up and
[48:47] getting what you've got and brings it
[48:51] down and anoint it because if you put it
[48:53] from here to here that's you doing it
[48:55] you can't put it from here to here cuz
[48:58] that's the problem we keep it here we
[49:00] try to put it down here but when the
[49:01] Holy Ghost remember the Bible tells us
[49:03] that the Holy Ghost will lead you and
[49:05] guide you into all truth all truth not
[49:13] part all truth so he because remember
[49:16] what you take in now get this when you
[49:19] take something in you're taking the word
[49:21] of God in now is that false no its truth
[49:26] the Word of God is true
[49:29] but the letter killeth if you don't get
[49:33] a revelation if the Holy Ghost you got
[49:35] doesn't reach up and get that and bring
[49:37] it down into that inner part of you and
[49:39] then what quickens it because what
[49:41] happened on the day of Pentecost what
[49:43] happened the day two days before
[49:44] Pentecost know what happened eleven days
[49:46] before Pentecost Peter and all them had
[49:50] it up here right they had nothing down
[49:53] here to reach and get it so they ran
[49:56] from the Lord the Lord told him I'm your
[49:58] Peter I'll I'll cut the note Jesus said
[50:03] I got to die alone
[50:04] I packed it in you Lord st. John 17 I've
[50:07] sanctified them
[50:08] I have breathed on them and told them
[50:11] you know what they're gonna do and the
[50:12] things are gonna do it's all up here
[50:14] Lord but there was nothing down here to
[50:17] reach and get it but on the day of
[50:19] Pentecost when that pillar of fire come
[50:21] down and I don't believe it set on it
[50:24] but I believe it went right on in them
[50:25] and that fire went into here what he do
[50:28] it drugged all that that they knew and
[50:31] it quickened it and what's the first
[50:33] thing Peter said Peter step down he says
[50:35] this is that what do you do he went
[50:39] right to the Word of God he said this is
[50:41] that that was promised now he didn't say
[50:44] that two days ago he didn't say that 11
[50:47] days ago he was scared to death but he
[50:49] stepped out throw the door open and said
[50:51] this is that this is what we've been
[50:54] waiting the whole world's been waiting
[50:55] on this right here
[50:58] the whole world's been waiting on you to
[51:01] be here today the whole world's been
[51:03] waiting on you to come to this service
[51:05] oh we just here for nothing I mean we're
[51:10] just here in haphazard and you know we
[51:12] we just showed up at church one day and
[51:15] God don't run his business look down
[51:17] let's go to number four now a minister
[51:21] cannot bring a revival even though we
[51:23] stand here we holler we clap we go hey
[51:25] y'all it cuz it does you no good until
[51:30] it quickens what you got
[51:33] there's no preacher can bring a revival
[51:36] he doesn't pack it with him I wish we
[51:39] did we just hand it out and the only
[51:43] thing to do is just be loyal to God and
[51:45] His Word
[51:47] we got a loyal pastors been Lord the
[51:49] Lord where it's being you we're the
[51:56] problem take your finger pointing like
[51:58] this who's your problem thinking okay
[52:01] the revival has to come by the people in
[52:05] your home in your life and a revival
[52:09] isn't adding new members to the church
[52:12] that's okay if it does its reviving that
[52:16] what you've already got your revive
[52:18] means to bring back and as we showed you
[52:20] the the definition I don't know if it's
[52:23] the next one or not but it's to what
[52:26] it's not to today today we're not going
[52:29] to the number five anyway today we're
[52:31] going to a baptism of service now if you
[52:36] are born again you can get born again
[52:39] before you get baptized happened in the
[52:42] book of Acts I just got finished reading
[52:45] the book of Acts cuz I wanted to read
[52:46] the book of Acts cuz that was the
[52:47] greatest revival that ever started among
[52:49] a group of people and it was 120 in the
[52:52] upper room and they weren't preachers
[52:53] yet hello the revival started when they
[53:00] took what they had and went out into the
[53:02] world and created a revival that still
[53:05] to now till now we're feeding on that
[53:09] same revival but
[53:10] you and I are not gonna cycle through
[53:12] another preacher though cycle through
[53:14] another star in other words another
[53:16] prophet we had one prophet the next
[53:19] prophet that hits the earth is going to
[53:21] Israel
[53:21] there's not another major prophet so you
[53:24] and I in the days of the voice of the
[53:30] seventh angel what we need today is an
[53:35] old-fashioned God's that revival clean
[53:37] up the home clean up the art get things
[53:40] ready are we doing that have you walked
[53:44] in your house and you know that's not
[53:45] it's not clean tonight you should not
[53:48] have anything in there really this you
[53:50] that you need to hide or throw away or
[53:52] okay because you know God visits when
[53:55] nobody else does okay all right but
[54:00] what's he saying clean up the home clean
[54:02] up the heart in other words get
[54:03] everything in order men be men women be
[54:06] women that's a quote brother I'm telling
[54:07] if men will start being men and women
[54:09] start being women will have a better
[54:10] church they men start a revival in your
[54:13] home and it'll begin at the church
[54:14] preacher don't bring it in his briefcase
[54:17] I wish we could God sends it from heaven
[54:22] to the individuals that's true number
[54:25] six that's the way to get a revival it's
[54:31] when you really get in the spirit of
[54:33] revival now look not whooping it up or
[54:36] something
[54:36] in other words like I said Wednesday
[54:38] night we don't what I'm gonna bring in a
[54:40] worship team to get a revival like
[54:44] they're doing churches and get to I mean
[54:45] we got lights up here but they're not
[54:47] red and blue and green and we we don't
[54:49] have smoke I wish there's I hope it or
[54:51] not smoke in here they'd be a fire but
[54:54] you know how they have all that stuff
[54:55] while they're doing they tried to build
[54:56] people up fleshly fleshly emotions we're
[55:00] talking about a word revival with a word
[55:02] inside of you it's going to revive and
[55:06] do exactly what it said because God's
[55:09] Word will always come to pass
[55:12] not whooping it up or something but by
[55:15] praying it down until there's a revival
[55:19] strikes your heart until all the logs of
[55:22] ecclesiastic says
[55:23] and all the logs of fanaticism and all
[55:26] the laws of system and all the logs of
[55:29] unbelief flows out then the waters of
[55:32] God comes falling down upon you never
[55:33] waters waters waters is revival all
[55:36] right
[55:37] comes falling there you are all right
[55:39] let's go to number seven hey by all
[55:43] rights Amen Oh Christian people
[55:46] this is 1948 old Christian people bind
[55:51] yourself together with one heart in one
[55:53] court for God cannot no more send the
[55:56] gifts to the church why do you think we
[55:58] don't have gifts that's why for God
[56:04] cannot no more send the gift to the
[56:06] church while the church is separated he
[56:08] saw brother Dale he's talking about
[56:09] denominations is he this is the only
[56:17] church I'm dealing with this is the only
[56:18] church you should deal with I'm not
[56:20] worried about what's going on out there
[56:23] while the church is separated then he
[56:26] can send the Holy Ghost unless you're in
[56:27] one accord so he can't send the Holy
[56:29] Ghost he can't send the gift if for 91
[56:31] accord that's right for it comes by the
[56:33] Holy Ghost believe it he said how do I
[56:37] know I have the Holy Ghost what's in you
[56:42] agrees with the word word by word and
[56:46] causes a word revival inside of you that
[56:50] you press play when you need to you come
[56:54] to church when you're supposed to I said
[56:57] that right press play when you want to
[56:59] come to church when you have need to
[57:01] which is ever signed in and all that but
[57:06] because we're going to talk about
[57:07] something in a few minutes that we've
[57:09] never talked about before it's called
[57:10] zeal it's called zeal the zeal of the
[57:14] people but I want you to see the wisdom
[57:17] of a prophet because there were people
[57:19] in the Bible calls elux and they were
[57:23] zealous about what they were doing so
[57:25] jealous they would kill people
[57:27] paul was a zealot before he was born
[57:30] again he had a zeal to kill right he
[57:36] they only kill people now that was wrong
[57:38] the seal was okay but he used it wrong
[57:41] but I tell you what brother Brown said
[57:42] in just a few minutes all right let's go
[57:43] to number eight and when the revival
[57:47] comes looks what always comes when he
[57:49] comes to today of Jesus just in the
[57:50] minority just a few people just a few
[57:55] people look like John have their own the
[57:59] bangs just a few people the greatest
[58:01] prophet ever come on the face of the
[58:02] earth but before Jesus introduced the
[58:05] Messiah they turned him down just a few
[58:10] people gathered around from the region's
[58:12] roundabouts to hearing about 99 percent
[58:15] of them rejected his message and walked
[58:17] away yet it was a great revival in a
[58:19] shaking time God shakes things and
[58:23] people don't realize it's being done I
[58:26] want you to think about that because
[58:31] we're listening we're human beings we're
[58:34] looking for an emotion we're looking for
[58:36] a great light to come down as human
[58:41] beings we would love to have that who
[58:46] feeling well I can do the same thing
[58:49] with an ice cube down the back of your
[58:52] neck and you'll be running up down this
[58:54] aisle trying to get the thing out of you
[58:55] how do you close right and then ain't be
[58:59] no God no where but when you can take
[59:02] and fortify yourself behind the Word of
[59:04] God and realize that God's Word will
[59:07] come to pass and it's going to come to
[59:08] pass in you ain't not your neighbor in
[59:12] you when it's going to come in you
[59:15] that's the shape listen brother I've
[59:17] said to make the devil shake it's to
[59:21] live the Word of God you can sit there
[59:23] and talk all you want to and we can spew
[59:25] and spout and bla bla bla we want to but
[59:28] if you live a good Christian life Satan
[59:31] does not know what to do with that
[59:33] because remember if you mess up that
[59:36] means you what you come out from behind
[59:38] the word brother branham said Satan
[59:39] can't get in but you can come out and he
[59:43] can get into your house not all the way
[59:45] down to the soul but he can get into
[59:46] this house
[59:47] and he can Greek have it God shakes
[59:52] things and people don't realize this
[59:54] being done see God shakes his church the
[59:58] revival is to his church I believe the
[1:00:01] church is called out now roll that back
[1:00:04] then what's the what's the date on the
[1:00:06] Oaks 19 what is it 1961 1961 God brother
[1:00:13] Brown got through brother Brown says I
[1:00:15] believe the church is called out now but
[1:00:19] the thing to revive us is to revive and
[1:00:21] shake that church to its place again you
[1:00:25] and I have a position to come to and
[1:00:27] that's where we can have power and
[1:00:30] character we've got the power brothers
[1:00:35] and sisters if you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:00:36] in your soul you can create a world and
[1:00:39] go live on it but what are you going to
[1:00:42] do with it when God releases the power
[1:00:44] and you're just a baby give the baby the
[1:00:47] car keys oh let's take all these kids
[1:00:51] that are under about 8 years old and
[1:00:52] give them all your car keys let them go
[1:00:54] outside turn the cars on you better not
[1:00:57] be out there what's it going to be a
[1:00:59] disaster
[1:01:01] but now the same set of keys in the same
[1:01:04] car we all came in with one we know what
[1:01:12] to do with it that's what God has been
[1:01:15] for 50 years trying to train us and
[1:01:18] guide us how to use and grab his vehicle
[1:01:22] call the Word of God because if we had
[1:01:26] the power without character remember
[1:01:28] what that is that's the tannic and then
[1:01:31] somebody cut you off on the side on the
[1:01:33] road what you'd want as Apple mount of
[1:01:36] existence but if you got the baptism of
[1:01:40] the Holy Ghost what makes it different
[1:01:42] you want you bet you pray for that
[1:01:44] person don't forgive them they don't
[1:01:47] know what they're doing and there's a
[1:01:49] lot of people driving they just don't
[1:01:50] know what they're doing
[1:01:54] and by all rights Amen oh man come on
[1:01:58] that's right alright let's go to number
[1:02:01] nine
[1:02:01] remember Wednesday night load you either
[1:02:04] weren't here brother Bram tells a story
[1:02:06] about a man called Peter Cartwright
[1:02:08] their Baio case a man wake up this is
[1:02:12] worth more than your sleepy time Peter
[1:02:16] Cartwright God told him to how God told
[1:02:19] him to have a revival he goes and finds
[1:02:22] a building in town and he's washing the
[1:02:24] walls washing the windows the bully of
[1:02:27] the community with the gun and the big
[1:02:29] tall guy comes walking in and says hey
[1:02:31] buddy who are you he's in other words he
[1:02:34] said I'm Peter Cartwright what are you
[1:02:35] doing here I'm gonna have a revival that
[1:02:37] big bully says angle-angle have no
[1:02:40] revival as long as I'm here you know
[1:02:43] what said before you have a revival you
[1:02:48] got a wit me first Peter Cartwright was
[1:02:54] a Christian man let me point that out I
[1:02:57] don't know if he just got out of prison
[1:02:58] but he was a Christian man and brother
[1:03:00] Brown said he was a little man but what
[1:03:03] happened Peter Cartwright said oh I do
[1:03:05] well I'll just do that next he didn't
[1:03:09] let it linger to the next day he didn't
[1:03:10] wait til the big man got he just went
[1:03:14] about his business that's the same thing
[1:03:17] you and I need to do with the devil
[1:03:18] don't let it linger
[1:03:19] that black didn't let it linger these
[1:03:22] others don't let it linger
[1:03:24] because Satan will take your joy he will
[1:03:28] take the words you got and make it none
[1:03:31] affect grabbing by the coat walk over at
[1:03:38] least by like I know this is a preacher
[1:03:42] real nice guy
[1:03:46] why you shouldn't be acting like that
[1:03:49] preacher doing what he's doing well
[1:03:52] brother Brad was making a point Peter
[1:03:55] Cartwright took his coat off well I'll
[1:03:57] just do it next walked over there and
[1:03:59] reach the big old bully by the collar
[1:04:01] knocked him down on the floor jumped on
[1:04:03] top of me and said
[1:04:04] I must fight if I sure ain't I must
[1:04:09] fight if I should rain increase my
[1:04:11] courage Lord pounded that he didn't just
[1:04:14] take a feather and go now stop that's
[1:04:21] why I say we're doing the devil the
[1:04:23] devil comes first we go oh quit quit
[1:04:26] then pound the tar out of it how do you
[1:04:36] do it with the Word of God you can't do
[1:04:37] it on your own but God give you the word
[1:04:42] Jesus did it all by he pounded a pile
[1:04:45] the devil every day why by the Word of
[1:04:47] God pound the tar out of him said you
[1:04:51] got enough the man said yes he got up
[1:04:58] and shook his hand he got saved the next
[1:05:00] 90 church but that's what we got to do
[1:05:03] the big old devil comes and said you go
[1:05:06] have a revival cuz I'm here then what
[1:05:09] does the Holy Ghost say in you oh I
[1:05:12] gotta whip you let's just start right
[1:05:15] now we gonna whip him he's gonna get a
[1:05:18] bloody eye a bloody nose and we gonna
[1:05:25] break him all up heading our way down to
[1:05:27] the baptismal pool because we have
[1:05:30] defeated you know we need to be just do
[1:05:44] what God says just do what God said that
[1:05:47] gives him the bloody eye just do what
[1:05:50] God said that's enough don't try to do
[1:05:53] it on your own stand up and say God if
[1:05:56] nobody does and I will Peter Cartwright
[1:05:59] didn't call his friends
[1:06:03] at that time he didn't probably have any
[1:06:06] he was in a new place washing the
[1:06:09] windows get rid have a revival you know
[1:06:11] why because God told him to have a
[1:06:14] revival God's telling you tonight today
[1:06:16] have a revival see what you can do
[1:06:21] listen a lot of this right here is
[1:06:24] reversed in our case we're the ones
[1:06:30] getting beat and whipped why I must
[1:06:36] fight if I should rain maybe what
[1:06:39] brother Branham had that dream of that
[1:06:41] vision about the guy beating - beating
[1:06:43] the woman all right beating the woman
[1:06:46] and he said stop that stop that and he
[1:06:48] says he got bigger and bigger and bigger
[1:06:50] what increased my faith faith has
[1:06:54] muscles brother Brown said one time face
[1:06:56] got hair on his chest
[1:07:00] thanks pretty burly that was faith that
[1:07:04] guy had a gun on his side he'd be hard
[1:07:06] for us to do that in this day and time
[1:07:08] grab somebody by the collar with a gun
[1:07:10] in his pocket
[1:07:11] all right look at number 10 I'll tell
[1:07:18] you our nation is simply polluted
[1:07:19] there's not a hope left of this nation
[1:07:22] as I see now that's okay because we're
[1:07:25] not part of this nation sure we live in
[1:07:28] the United States greatest greatest
[1:07:30] country in the world to live and prosper
[1:07:34] in but the nation is gone pray for the
[1:07:41] people in the nation only an
[1:07:44] old-fashioned revival and according to
[1:07:46] the scripture it'll never be nationwide
[1:07:48] so we're not looking for a nationwide
[1:07:49] revival anymore it's gonna be like Peter
[1:07:51] Cartwright it was Peter cart riding the
[1:07:53] devil inside of one room and he went at
[1:07:56] it with him listen we have the devil's
[1:08:00] answer he had the devil's answer he had
[1:08:02] that man's answer he wept him so then
[1:08:05] there's just left it'll be a revival
[1:08:07] among the people the elect of God now I
[1:08:11] want to tell you something today just
[1:08:13] like I told you all the other day about
[1:08:14] Communion and foot washing
[1:08:17] it's something that Christians do
[1:08:21] it's a communion between you and God not
[1:08:25] you and your neighbor you and God if we
[1:08:28] come up and present the communion to you
[1:08:30] and you don't take it you've got a
[1:08:32] problem and it's pretty apparent that
[1:08:34] you have a problem because brother Brown
[1:08:38] said Christians will take communion
[1:08:40] that's an ordinance of God just like
[1:08:43] water baptism if you start in your
[1:08:45] Christian walk you gonna want to be
[1:08:48] baptized I wanted to be baptized even
[1:08:51] though I had been baptized when I was 12
[1:08:53] years old
[1:08:54] in Athens or no nine years old in Athens
[1:08:59] or 10 I needed to be baptized again why
[1:09:02] because my conscious I had done all that
[1:09:04] bad for 20 years yeah I'll let the devil
[1:09:09] whip me for that length of time but when
[1:09:13] you go down to that water and you say
[1:09:15] Satan this old my hands gonna get buried
[1:09:18] today and you are not going to resurrect
[1:09:22] with it because we don't understand
[1:09:24] Satan has no power he cannot resurrect
[1:09:26] one person he can resurrect itself
[1:09:31] there's no power no way to reproduce
[1:09:35] yourself but it's to be a revival among
[1:09:39] the people the elect of God listen if
[1:09:41] you're elect of God you will be in a
[1:09:45] revival it's promised after two days but
[1:09:50] it won't be a sweeping revival take the
[1:09:52] whole nation in everyone's never will
[1:09:54] number 11
[1:09:58] now that's the reason today this is the
[1:10:00] third seal the revivals that were
[1:10:01] supposed to have we have denominational
[1:10:04] revivals now remember this is going to
[1:10:06] be a word revival only to the bride
[1:10:09] elect of Jesus Christ in the end time
[1:10:13] right say ma'am it's not two
[1:10:15] denominations can't have a word revival
[1:10:18] you can't revive something that's
[1:10:20] already
[1:10:21] [Applause]
[1:10:23] you can resurrect something to stay
[1:10:28] that's when you get born again you're
[1:10:31] resurrecting something that's dead but
[1:10:33] the denominations have already made
[1:10:35] their choice they are dead can't be
[1:10:38] revived
[1:10:39] so yeah they'll have their revivals but
[1:10:41] what's it gonna be fleshly revivals it
[1:10:44] cannot be a word revival can't be why
[1:10:50] because there's too many errors we
[1:10:54] haven't had a real stirring no no no no
[1:10:56] no sir this is 1963 preaching the seals
[1:10:59] don't think we got revivals we haven't
[1:11:02] oh they got millions and millions and
[1:11:03] millions of church members but not a
[1:11:05] revival know we're don't know the bride
[1:11:09] the elect that's not a revival yet
[1:11:14] there's been no revival there no
[1:11:17] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[1:11:19] yet see we're looking for it
[1:11:21] it'll take those seven unknown thunders
[1:11:23] and you boy everybody starting to go
[1:11:24] well we don't know what that is
[1:11:26] it's the plan of redemption folks it's
[1:11:29] the plan Redemption how God's gonna take
[1:11:32] you from point A to point B in your body
[1:11:35] spirit insult that's just too simple
[1:11:41] because what because what's gonna wake
[1:11:43] you up what's gonna wake you up when you
[1:11:46] realize who you are when you realize
[1:11:49] what you're doing here why you're here
[1:11:52] and that you're right in this very plan
[1:11:55] of God what a wake it up he'll send it
[1:12:03] he promised it remember God's Word has
[1:12:08] to come to pass it will be a word
[1:12:15] revival it will not be a fleshly revival
[1:12:18] but we can get happy about it those that
[1:12:24] bite pretty happy right now sister Freda
[1:12:27] sister Anna butts really happy right now
[1:12:28] because you know what we're going to do
[1:12:29] something we're gonna do something that
[1:12:31] the devil or never wants you to do
[1:12:34] the devil will never tell you to go on
[1:12:37] be a Christian and be baptized no no
[1:12:39] he'll do his best to keep you out of the
[1:12:41] water
[1:12:42] amen but remember this is a pure word
[1:12:47] revival so now all right
[1:12:50] let's for just a few minutes we have the
[1:12:52] word here
[1:12:53] I'm not talked about just right here I'm
[1:12:55] talking we have the pure unadulterated
[1:12:56] word through the prophets message and
[1:12:58] that's what we preach all these brothers
[1:13:01] all the people that we have here you
[1:13:03] you've heard the Word of God okay what
[1:13:06] are we doing with it what are we doing
[1:13:09] with it I'm asking you what are we doing
[1:13:10] with it
[1:13:11] number 12 testimony on the scene 1964
[1:13:14] and then we begin to find out miracles
[1:13:17] isn't taking place no more like they
[1:13:19] were baptism are not taking place like
[1:13:24] they were it is it because the sick go
[1:13:27] home sick it isn't because of God it's
[1:13:32] because of the lack of the revival among
[1:13:34] the people there is no revival they sit
[1:13:37] and listen go home and say well I guess
[1:13:40] that was pretty good mm-hmm there is not
[1:13:43] that zeal there is not that something in
[1:13:46] the people that should be there now what
[1:13:49] is the word zeal what does it mean let's
[1:13:53] go to the next one a couple more quotes
[1:13:56] zeal means in being our indignation
[1:14:00] which we don't want any of that but look
[1:14:03] fervent mind jealousy you say oh I don't
[1:14:07] want to be jealous
[1:14:08] God's jealous God's jealous if it's
[1:14:11] godly jealousy he said I love you with
[1:14:13] godly jealousy hey man we should love
[1:14:16] the Word of God with godly jealousy we
[1:14:18] should be jealous of anything outside of
[1:14:21] the Word of God emulation look
[1:14:23] excitement of mine ardor fervent of
[1:14:29] spirit zeal and ardour and embrace in
[1:14:32] other words an unction to embrace the
[1:14:36] Word of God pursuing the Word of God
[1:14:38] defending the Word of God Zeeland behalf
[1:14:42] of for a person or thing the fierceness
[1:14:44] of indignation Peter to zeal now look
[1:14:47] started with the zealots in the Old
[1:14:50] Testament in the New Testament they were
[1:14:52] zealous and even someone in the Old
[1:14:53] Testament they were zealous but you know
[1:14:55] what they did they over run their wisdom
[1:15:02] by their zeal but let's go to number 13
[1:15:08] brother Graham said we will see Jesus
[1:15:11] 19:58 that enthusiasm the church today
[1:15:14] lost its enthusiasm look why cuz it's
[1:15:21] got out of the vine what's to find the
[1:15:23] Word of God I am the vine jesus said you
[1:15:28] are the branches where does the life
[1:15:30] come from come from the vine all right
[1:15:32] we've got out of the vine it's no more
[1:15:35] being energized by the spirit wells of
[1:15:37] water bubbling up an everlasting life
[1:15:39] they've lost that zeal something's
[1:15:43] missing God remains the same Christ
[1:15:47] remains the same but his church has
[1:15:49] disassociated itself with his connection
[1:15:52] divine the spirit I'm just telling you
[1:15:56] what the Prophet said in 1958 all right
[1:16:02] let's go to the next one I mean that
[1:16:06] burning up watch this I mean that
[1:16:09] burning zeal of God nothing can stop it
[1:16:11] all right so the burning zeal of God
[1:16:13] nothing can stop it except you in your
[1:16:18] own self look at Hebrews 11 where
[1:16:20] there's just one nod of those Patriots
[1:16:22] from God they subdued kingdoms wrought
[1:16:24] righteousness stopped the lion's mouth
[1:16:26] and escaped fire the things they've done
[1:16:28] through faith by just one nod from God
[1:16:31] and let me let me interpolate that was
[1:16:36] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[1:16:37] their song that was an anointing of the
[1:16:41] Holy Ghost all the people not an inward
[1:16:45] dwelling what will we do with an inward
[1:16:48] dwelling today God can send a preacher
[1:16:53] and Hammer that word as hard as he can
[1:16:55] and we go to sleep like some of you are
[1:16:57] now
[1:16:58] get up and walk out no wonder we're
[1:17:01] walled in the church is hmm I know this
[1:17:10] is tape it goes to a lot of places
[1:17:12] same here this goes all over the world
[1:17:15] because we have a tape sale completely
[1:17:17] around the world goes to missionary to
[1:17:18] foreign field and I mean everyone yes
[1:17:20] don't return this is to time to return
[1:17:23] while the calls coming
[1:17:25] this is our call brothers and sisters
[1:17:28] and ain't coming through me it's coming
[1:17:31] in the Word of God it's coming by the
[1:17:34] ignorance of preaching the message
[1:17:36] yes sir these signs shall follow sons
[1:17:39] not slaves I like that's why I put it in
[1:17:41] there these signs shall follow up sons
[1:17:44] not slaves our problem is we thought we
[1:17:46] were sons and daughters of God for all
[1:17:48] these years and we found out we're
[1:17:49] slaves so get born again and be a son
[1:17:53] and daughter of God not bondsman not
[1:17:57] servants why you gonna be a servant to
[1:18:00] sin but sons everybody all right
[1:18:06] burning zeal of God nothing can stop it
[1:18:10] amen
[1:18:12] all right now these those those of you
[1:18:14] that have quotes don't have these two I
[1:18:15] picked these up watch what brother Bram
[1:18:17] said now this is this is the wisdom of a
[1:18:19] prophet once there's 1956
[1:18:21] what is the vision Oh God all flesh is
[1:18:27] like grass the ends clothes
[1:18:28] oh Christ of God received these poor
[1:18:30] people into the kingdom someday I must
[1:18:33] stand yonder at the throne of God and
[1:18:35] give an account for my ministry I wonder
[1:18:38] what people think about that when they
[1:18:39] start talking about brother branham's
[1:18:40] wrong and this is it just is it just
[1:18:45] mayor's well I'm telling you it's a trap
[1:18:47] of the devil it's a trap of the devil
[1:18:49] because brother Brown is preaching they
[1:18:51] we've we've taped eleven hundred and
[1:18:54] something sermons why would God go to
[1:18:56] all that trouble if we didn't need it
[1:19:00] come on people this message is sacred
[1:19:04] this message is pure the people have
[1:19:08] made it of none effect jesus stood up
[1:19:11] one day and said you've got the Word of
[1:19:12] God but you by your tradition
[1:19:15] you've made it him none effect to the
[1:19:16] people I say today that's what's
[1:19:20] happening in the ministry they have made
[1:19:21] it up not a fact brother Brad said has
[1:19:23] always been preachers he's never had
[1:19:27] problem with ladies always that problem
[1:19:29] with preachers I like what brother
[1:19:31] Clarke told me about brother Jeff's
[1:19:33] brother Jeff said when he'd find a
[1:19:34] minister that was a little bit off or he
[1:19:36] wanted to talk to him about his doctrine
[1:19:38] he'd take him to a steak house and wait
[1:19:39] till the brothers started putting steak
[1:19:41] in his mouth he wait till that brother
[1:19:43] puts the big piece of steak in his mouth
[1:19:44] and then he'd go at him God the brothers
[1:19:47] gone that's wisdom give account for
[1:19:56] these things that you're permitted me to
[1:19:57] do Lord he's got to give an account for
[1:19:59] what you and I are sitting here
[1:20:00] listening to in the midst of the people
[1:20:05] to declare the resurrection of the Lord
[1:20:07] Jesus God I must answer for that Oh God
[1:20:10] look burnsy Oh down into my heart more
[1:20:13] and more and wisdom that I might know
[1:20:16] how to lead the people to the Lord Jesus
[1:20:18] he wanted zeal but he wanted wisdom but
[1:20:22] watch this next quote and we'll stop
[1:20:23] right here number 16 musicians get ready
[1:20:26] to come watch I remember the last time
[1:20:29] hear from Raymond rich you caught me by
[1:20:31] the trousers leg as we were coming to
[1:20:34] church here in Los Angeles no I beg your
[1:20:36] pardon Long Beach we were going to the
[1:20:37] auditorium they like not Raymond's a
[1:20:39] personal friend of mine he had a
[1:20:41] breakdown he's in a terrible condition
[1:20:42] he said brother Brown don't go too long
[1:20:44] he just came back from Korea Raymond's
[1:20:47] getting a little far up the road too you
[1:20:48] know he said you'll kill yourself and
[1:20:50] said look what a condition and I've been
[1:20:52] along these lines yeah that got it got
[1:20:56] all the way down to the quote yet but
[1:20:57] anyway it looks like you got haven't got
[1:20:59] time look they've cut the quote off the
[1:21:03] rest of the quote says and it makes you
[1:21:04] nervous so I just hope the Lord forgives
[1:21:07] me that my zeal will never overcome my
[1:21:10] wisdom
[1:21:13] that my zeal will never overcome my
[1:21:17] wisdom because you can have so much zeal
[1:21:19] to you hurt people
[1:21:20] or you have so much zeal to where you
[1:21:23] just run right over people instead of
[1:21:24] having wisdom he'd give me wisdom to
[1:21:27] know how to handle my zeal rather they
[1:21:30] didn't have that somehow that got cut
[1:21:31] off for the quote but the quote says
[1:21:32] Lord forgive me that my zeal were not
[1:21:35] overcome my wisdom that's what I'm
[1:21:38] telling you a word revival it's not you
[1:21:40] all getting up jumping shouting praising
[1:21:42] God I'd love that that would be fine if
[1:21:45] we all get together and bind together
[1:21:46] like on the day of Pentecost I'll
[1:21:48] guarantee you that's what will happen
[1:21:49] cuz that's why it happened then but it's
[1:21:52] that we have a zeal I want us to have
[1:21:54] more zeal for God but don't let it
[1:21:58] override our wisdom to say hey we got to
[1:22:02] get the word first this is a word
[1:22:04] revival so if we get the word first then
[1:22:08] let's take the zeal and let's push that
[1:22:10] thing we got to push this thing to the
[1:22:13] coming of the Lord musicians come we got
[1:22:15] to push you and I I must fight that's
[1:22:21] okay we're getting ready to close don't
[1:22:24] worry Peter Cartwright I must fight if I
[1:22:32] should rain increase my faith Lord he
[1:22:37] pounded the tar out of that man let's
[1:22:39] pound the tar out of the devil on the
[1:22:42] way down to the baptismal service if you
[1:22:46] could see in another dimension you see
[1:22:48] angels standing lining the highway right
[1:22:55] standing at attention because what does
[1:22:58] the Bible saying the whole heaven
[1:23:01] rejoices all the Angels rejoice when one
[1:23:04] soul one soul we got three one soul
[1:23:08] comes home so they stand in their
[1:23:10] detention and they're gonna watch us go
[1:23:12] down and you know what the devil may be
[1:23:14] there but you know what he's doing
[1:23:20] what's happening over there out the
[1:23:24] angel turns around and says none of your
[1:23:26] business cuz it ain't none of his
[1:23:28] business he has no business being there
[1:23:30] we got less than the devil's real but
[1:23:34] God's more real the devil's real he's a
[1:23:37] real person but God by his word has give
[1:23:40] you power to overcome the devil let's
[1:23:44] stand to our feet give you a seal you
[1:23:49] say brother Wayne what are you talking
[1:23:51] about praise God
[1:23:53] five minutes more you did last week
[1:23:58] decide that you're going to read a
[1:24:01] little more than you did decide that
[1:24:06] you're gonna let God rule your life a
[1:24:10] little bit more than you did last week
[1:24:16] then you won't be such a zealot you'll
[1:24:18] have wisdom and guard to be able to use
[1:24:21] that wisdom and then you can move
[1:24:24] forward with God have a zeal that's what
[1:24:28] brother Brown said that's why I read
[1:24:29] that the church is lacking because
[1:24:32] they've lost the zeal they've lost the
[1:24:36] fervor
[1:24:39] how many of you brothers that had been
[1:24:42] married and you know I went to the
[1:24:45] Philippines for about three weeks and
[1:24:47] June and I've you know be we've made 40
[1:24:50] years this year but last year I went to
[1:24:53] the Philippines for a couple of weeks
[1:24:55] and
[1:24:58] I had a fervor to get back home I wanted
[1:25:03] to see my bride I didn't care if it was
[1:25:05] 40 years or four minutes I wanted to get
[1:25:08] back home why I had missed her sure I'd
[1:25:12] been able to talk to her but God wants
[1:25:17] to see us face-to-face there's a barrier
[1:25:23] there they're stopping him and it's
[1:25:25] called us because we're gonna see him
[1:25:28] one day face to face our great
[1:25:31] bridegroom and he wants to see he has a
[1:25:35] fervor to see me in you now what me and
[1:25:38] you need to have is a fervor to see him
[1:25:40] as much as he wants to see us cuz you
[1:25:43] know what His Word says he can't come
[1:25:45] here unless he comes in youth he can't
[1:25:50] come unless he comes in you me and you
[1:25:51] so this is it we've come to the place
[1:25:55] the revival has begun just make sure you
[1:26:00] don't get left behind let's sing a song
[1:26:03] god bless you page 315 oh if you're in
