[9:49] Sunday afternoon service amen amen so
[9:52] just remember these if you'd like turn
[9:54] in your scriptures second Thessalonians
[9:58] 2 in Genesis
[10:03] 3 now while you're turning there and
[10:05] standing I would like to say something
[10:07] to you that I want to apologize to my
[10:10] wife for jokingly saying something there
[10:14] Sunday that there was no derogatory
[10:18] thing intended but it was a joke and I
[10:22] shouldn't have been joking and all but
[10:24] it's just one of those things and I'm
[10:26] sorry I will try my best to
[10:29] keep away from that but you know about
[10:34] the message part now I wonder how many
[10:36] of you sisters have thought about what I
[10:39] said about my wife instead of thought
[10:40] about what I said right or what the
[10:43] scripture would say or the Bible would
[10:44] say about um you know how you treat your
[10:48] husband cu the prophet said as you treat
[10:51] your husband so is it how you you treat
[10:55] Christ so then you know uh just think
[10:58] about those things and remember there's
[11:01] a saying you'll never be remembered for
[11:04] the goods you've done you'll always be
[11:07] remembered for the Goofs you made that's
[11:09] right okay so but I apologize to my wife
[11:11] about that I'm sorry that I shouldn't
[11:14] have been jokingly saying something
[11:16] about something that you know but so
[11:21] just keep that in mind all right 2
[11:24] Thessalonians 2 and
[11:26] Genesis 3 kind of an odd thing to go
[11:29] over and then come back down all right
[11:32] but we want to tie it together uh into
[11:35] the message Father we thank you we love
[11:39] you we ask you that you would just bless
[11:41] us now with your presence and
[11:43] understanding that you would guide each
[11:45] and every one of us and that you'd give
[11:46] us Lord what you'd have for us this day
[11:49] forgive our sins and Lord forgive us in
[11:53] any way of life and not working
[11:55] according to what you would want us to
[11:57] be and just have your way now and keep
[12:00] us lead us by thine understanding hand
[12:02] as we read your word you come and speak
[12:05] to our hearts and our lives we love you
[12:07] and we thank you in Jesus name amen also
[12:12] the doctor said I do not have to have
[12:14] the operation as of this time
[12:20] so thinking about taking my thyroid out
[12:23] but he said he didn't think it was
[12:25] necessary right now but he wanted them
[12:27] to get to working on auses I said well
[12:30] for 20 30 years have been working on
[12:33] this crepiness to try to get it out so
[12:36] you know maybe one of these days they'll
[12:38] figure out how to do it cuz I asked him
[12:40] I said well if I take the thyroid out
[12:41] would it help that he said I can't
[12:43] promise you anything I said well all
[12:46] right but he said himself said well
[12:48] let's just wait I said okay you know
[12:51] let's do
[12:52] that all
[12:54] right yeah wait said after hunting
[12:56] season we have to wait get over there
[12:59] there goes her joke again right all
[13:01] right let's go to Second
[13:04] Thessalonians then we'll come back to
[13:06] Genesis because this is not going to be
[13:09] just dealing with the garden and the
[13:13] things I want us to get down to the
[13:16] original sin and see that the original
[13:20] sin would have to still be here y you
[13:24] remember when brother brandom was
[13:26] talking to the man you know and and he
[13:28] really didn't didn't have the answer
[13:29] something similar to the basis of what
[13:32] was that went on and and the man told
[13:35] him said now wait a minute brother
[13:37] random said whatever was there has got
[13:39] to still be here yeah he said okay Lord
[13:43] then the Lord came on the scene and
[13:44] showed him you know what it was you know
[13:47] so just remember that as we're trying to
[13:49] to get to the
[13:52] point 2
[13:54] Thessalonians we'll start reading in
[13:56] verse 7 just to sa time for the m of
[13:59] iniquity do already work only he who now
[14:02] lth will let until he be taken out of
[14:05] the way then shall that Wicked be
[14:07] revealed whom the Lord shall consume
[14:08] with the spirit of his mouth and shall
[14:10] destroy with the brightness of his
[14:11] coming even him whose coming is after
[14:14] the working of
[14:16] Satan watch even him whose coming is
[14:19] after the working of Satan with all
[14:20] power and signs and lying wonders and
[14:23] with all deceivableness of
[14:25] unrighteousness in them that perish
[14:29] because they received not the love of
[14:30] the truth that they might be saved and
[14:33] for this cause God shall send them
[14:36] strong delusion that they should believe
[14:39] a lie that they all might be damned who
[14:43] believe not the truth but have pleasure
[14:46] in unrighteousness now let's go back to
[14:48] Genesis then cuz I said we want to tie
[14:51] it together and bring it down to the
[14:53] hour that we're living to finish all
[14:56] things up Genesis 3
[15:00] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[15:02] beast of the field which the Lord God
[15:04] had made and he said unto the woman y
[15:06] hath God said ye shall not eat of every
[15:09] tree of the garden and the woman said
[15:11] unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit
[15:13] of the Trees of the garden but of the
[15:16] fruit of the tree which is in the midst
[15:18] of the garden right God ha said ye shall
[15:20] not eat of it neither shall ye touch it
[15:23] lest you die and the serpent said unto
[15:25] the woman ye shall not surely die for
[15:28] for God does know that in the day you
[15:31] eat thereof then your eyes shall be open
[15:34] and you shall be as God's knowing good
[15:37] and evil and when the woman saw that the
[15:39] tree was good for food and that it was
[15:41] pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be
[15:45] desired to make one wise she took of the
[15:47] fruit thereof and did eat and gave it
[15:49] unto her husband with her and he did eat
[15:52] and the eyes of both of them were open
[15:54] and they knew that they were naked and
[15:56] they seed fig leaves together and made
[15:58] made themelves aprons you may be seated
[16:01] the Lord add his Blessing to the reading
[16:04] of the
[16:05] word
[16:09] now I want to make sure that you follow
[16:12] the point of the way that I was trying
[16:14] to bring out um Sunday afternoon
[16:19] especially and and seeing the
[16:22] situation that we talked about Sunday
[16:24] morning and then on the end of the
[16:26] evening service about what that
[16:29] God first created a spiritual man that's
[16:32] right all right and that spiritual man
[16:35] was Genesis 1: 126 and 27 which
[16:39] according to the
[16:41] prophet that man was created before the
[16:44] foundation of the world Amen he was not
[16:47] created spiritually on the sixth day any
[16:50] day whatsoever amen he was created in
[16:53] eternity all right because we saw that
[16:56] spiritual man was the man land Christ
[16:59] Jesus the one true seed of of uh
[17:03] Galatians 3:16 amen all right and then
[17:07] the natural Man was created in Genesis 2
[17:10] now that was created on the sixth day
[17:13] amen the natural man Adam was created
[17:17] there in Genesis and the prophet said
[17:19] now one is a natural man the other one
[17:20] is a spiritual
[17:23] man now you say but brother Dale uh what
[17:27] would that tie to together because uh
[17:30] you know we believe that that it was
[17:33] only in God's
[17:35] mind back before the world well all of
[17:38] the previous messages to anyone just
[17:40] hooking on and hearing this uh I don't
[17:43] have time to cover all of it but if you
[17:45] go back about seven or eight messages
[17:47] and try to listen you know it would uh
[17:51] you could be able to understand what
[17:52] we're talking about if not you won't
[17:54] know what we're trying to say but the
[17:57] point is that
[17:59] if you say it was just in his mind or in
[18:01] a way or something like that then you're
[18:04] cutting off the real truth that that man
[18:08] that was created back there was part of
[18:12] God
[18:14] right God stepped over into another form
[18:17] right right and begin to create it
[18:19] that's right not another God Amen but
[18:22] another form amen and if we wasn't there
[18:25] in him in that form mhm that he was in
[18:31] then the prophet of God says we'll never
[18:33] be there that's right all right so then
[18:36] that's just puts it to a point you know
[18:38] of of doing it but see what I've tried
[18:41] to get you to see is on the one true and
[18:44] living God the way I believe
[18:46] it God just stepped over into another
[18:49] form to to begin to create it was the
[18:53] same God Amen in another form that's
[18:56] right all right called a son of God God
[18:58] word logos theoy etc
[19:01] etc all right now he done that to be
[19:05] able to
[19:07] create because only the that only Jesus
[19:10] Christ was the creator according to uh
[19:13] the scriptures Hebrews 1 John 1 uh you
[19:16] know and all of
[19:18] that and what is it James 3 or what
[19:20] where it says that Jesus Christ created
[19:22] all things or Ephesians 3 all right now
[19:27] what I tried to get you to see about God
[19:29] the way I look at
[19:31] it and I mean this is the way I see it
[19:34] he he stepped over into another form
[19:36] right yeah all right now we won't take
[19:40] it up tonight because we're not going to
[19:41] get there but we'll begin to cover more
[19:45] into Sunday Services as to begin to talk
[19:49] about this man and creation and life and
[19:52] the existence of the Old Testament
[19:55] people and you'll see that that that
[19:57] same God that stepped down to to create
[20:02] was the same God that just stepped over
[20:03] into another form to be the Christ of
[20:06] the Old Testament amen the one to lead
[20:09] the children of Israel the you know the
[20:11] the pillar of fire the the the the
[20:14] things of the Old Testament and we'll
[20:16] see that that is the same Christ all
[20:19] right then that same Christ just stepped
[20:20] into flesh amen some 2,000 years ago
[20:25] into a human body that was prep
[20:29] all right and that same God was in that
[20:32] flesh not another God Amen not another
[20:35] person or identity same God Amen all
[20:38] right see then what I trying to get you
[20:39] see then then he just stepped over in
[20:41] the day of Pentecost amen when the Holy
[20:44] Ghost came he just stepped over in
[20:46] another form amen all right and see then
[20:50] we're the final imorph or final form of
[20:54] God in this end times then there
[20:57] shouldn't be any trouble to understand
[21:00] that we not as people not as little some
[21:04] form of identities or some little
[21:05] something you want to make but that we
[21:08] were there in him according to uh as we
[21:11] spent so much time in Ephesians it says
[21:14] that Ephesians 1 about four says that we
[21:18] were chosen in him that's right before
[21:21] the foundation of the world now what was
[21:24] chosen before the foundation of world
[21:26] the Christ right the eternal
[21:29] life not us as people
[21:33] Y and then we come to earth now that's
[21:36] where we are in our studies we've
[21:37] dropped to Earth and we're going to pick
[21:39] up and see how we developed our name our
[21:43] ways our doings here on Earth and then
[21:46] we'll see what part Christ plays with
[21:48] all of those things amen all right see
[21:52] that's that's what I wanted to bring I I
[21:54] wrote started wri notes and and then
[21:56] when I did I se well uh there's a gap
[21:59] you know so I need to fill it in all
[22:01] right and you'd have to be me okay I'm
[22:04] sorry when I look at something like that
[22:06] I don't want to leave a loophole right
[22:08] or a gap I want it filled in where you
[22:11] can just come flow right across and and
[22:14] be able to to see where we're at all
[22:16] right
[22:19] now we know that Eve was in
[22:26] Adam and I trying to bring out Sunday
[22:28] you know people say oh she was just a by
[22:32] product you know making her some kind of
[22:34] a dog meat or something you know
[22:38] compared to the man being a porterhouse
[22:39] steak or some kind of a fancy thing and
[22:44] I I spent my whole time trying to get
[22:47] you sisters to see your rightful
[22:49] position like I said then I flood a dub
[22:52] by some I say and ruins the whole thing
[22:55] and you forget all I talk and you just
[22:57] remember what to say
[23:00] but the Eve brother Brown said was
[23:02] co-equal amen absolutely yes
[23:06] sir amen we look at a
[23:11] byproduct a byproduct according to
[23:14] Webster is a
[23:17] secondary or incidental
[23:20] product like as in the process of
[23:23] manifest
[23:25] manufacturing all right it's something
[23:28] produced in making or doing something
[23:30] else right not the main product
[23:35] right but see it's like I tried to get
[23:37] you to see that you
[23:41] know God made male and female for the
[23:46] animals then when it come to the to the
[23:48] woman he didn't do
[23:51] that he went back to the original
[23:53] product that was standing there
[23:55] Adam and he took from Adam that's right
[23:58] a rib and made
[24:00] Eve all right and Eve was in Adam
[24:04] brother around said in
[24:06] theop in the beginning well why can't we
[24:10] see the truth of
[24:12] it people want to make it look like some
[24:15] kind of a garbage can yeah or created a
[24:18] certain way so you know that things
[24:20] could fall in in a way of making her do
[24:23] it well if that be true then God's the
[24:26] author yeah
[24:28] remember now I can quote brother
[24:32] brandom brother brandom said Satan was
[24:36] he
[24:36] designer now what's he talking about
[24:39] right
[24:40] right what's he talking about right
[24:43] that's right did he design her body
[24:47] no did he design design her spirit no
[24:51] did he design her as a person no no no
[24:54] no no God did amen right
[24:58] but see then Satan took over
[25:02] right the same lie he told in heaven
[25:05] that's what we want to get to the
[25:06] original sin the same lie that he told
[25:08] in heaven it's the same lie he told Eve
[25:12] and that's the same lie that he still
[25:13] telling today
[25:16] right I can't get away from that so
[25:18] forgive me you know I I wanted to and
[25:21] you talk to God about it or somebody
[25:23] else ever somebody told me to do it this
[25:26] way you have to make your Choice that's
[25:29] right but God created
[25:33] Adam and he saw Adam
[25:36] lonely so he took part of
[25:41] Adam then that would make her not an
[25:44] original creation all right so we're in
[25:47] marriage and divorce and brother Bram
[25:48] and the quotes brother BR made said see
[25:50] she wasn't in the original she wasn't
[25:53] right the other females were made in the
[25:55] original the dog the cat the horse the
[25:58] you know but she wasn't she was a
[26:01] byproduct she was in
[26:05] Adam then taken from
[26:08] Adam and placed into a position
[26:12] that we covered it Sunday that she was
[26:16] co-equal with Al
[26:18] right now how are you going to make a
[26:21] co-equal
[26:23] product such a garbage can byproduct
[26:26] that the preacher to do with the message
[26:30] right that's right I'm not a male show
[26:33] in his Pig but neither am I what is the
[26:35] other side of it Susan ain't here to
[26:37] help me I'm not a femin I'm what he
[26:43] said I just believe in the truth right
[26:46] amen right I believe God created e
[26:50] perfect amen yeah all right right but
[26:53] yet knowing that if he put her in flesh
[26:59] that she would fall right cuz he knew if
[27:02] he brought Satan into
[27:05] being he would fall yeah but did he make
[27:09] Satan fall no you can't do that cuz you
[27:12] down the author right did he make EA no
[27:15] you can't do it so she would put on
[27:17] three more agency amen that's right all
[27:19] right and she made her
[27:21] choice and that's what we want to deal
[27:24] with for a little bit now because look
[27:27] even if you say well she was a lesser
[27:30] product well what are you going to do
[27:31] there in the Bible where Adam said she
[27:34] is now
[27:36] bone of two other
[27:39] guys
[27:41] no said she's bone of my bone amen and
[27:46] Flesh of My Flesh right she had no
[27:51] original
[27:55] DNA had to be an Adam amen right and
[27:59] remember she never got her name Eve
[28:02] until she fell amen that's right her
[28:05] name was Adam that's right a
[28:12] byproduct Adam but then when she fell
[28:16] she received the name Eve because it
[28:18] means mother of all living all right so
[28:21] it put it into a
[28:23] place all right so God never went
[28:26] somewhere else to get it he went right
[28:29] straight to the original
[28:31] product and got Eve from the original
[28:35] product of
[28:37] Adam bringing her into
[28:41] being and in doing that look what the
[28:45] position he put her in coequal that's
[28:49] right right
[28:54] yep Satan was co-equal with
[28:58] God except for creation is that what
[29:01] your Prophet said that's what he said y
[29:03] said he couldn't create that's why he
[29:06] pass out Supernatural gifts that's why
[29:08] he can imitate the Holy Ghost he can do
[29:09] all kind of signs and wonders
[29:13] amen
[29:15] now but when Eve chose
[29:18] wrong see then her attribute was
[29:22] displayed into the the the committing of
[29:26] an act
[29:28] just as I tried to express that the
[29:30] Angels couldn't smoke drink Che or
[29:32] running around with women up in heaven y
[29:35] cuz they had no gender part to be able
[29:37] to do
[29:38] it so then that's not sin sin is to
[29:44] disbelieve right all right right sin is
[29:47] to disbelieve God's word right all right
[29:53] now she
[29:55] believed Satan's life
[29:59] all
[30:00] right just
[30:03] like Lucifer
[30:06] Satan got the angels in heaven to
[30:10] believe his lie
[30:13] amen all
[30:15] right so then now we come to quote
[30:18] number one
[30:20] brother
[30:24] Anderson you read all above and belows
[30:26] the things but just get what we
[30:29] underline and what we're thinking
[30:31] about now think of what your Prophet is
[30:35] saying and and your
[30:37] mind you know I I've always tried to
[30:39] tell you about your mind how your mind
[30:41] works right all right and and it can be
[30:44] locked in on
[30:46] something and you can quote it but it it
[30:49] locks in
[30:51] right all right
[30:53] now my mind used to be locked
[30:58] on this
[31:01] quote CU When I read that I thought
[31:04] brother randam who give you the right to
[31:07] interpret the scriptures or to change
[31:10] the wording when you said that the ends
[31:12] and the buts was
[31:17] per and you know what one day I
[31:20] read what he
[31:23] said he didn't change anything he said
[31:27] the original said
[31:31] that right was your mind locked on a
[31:33] point that brother randam just said the
[31:36] LIE yep should have said the lie was he
[31:40] telling us some better way of
[31:41] understanding no he was right in the
[31:44] scripture for this caus man she sent
[31:46] forth a strong Lo that they should
[31:47] believe a a lie it should have been
[31:50] translated there as I looked in the
[31:55] Lexicon Dei not a lie same one he told
[32:00] Eve
[32:02] now whatever the LIE is is the original
[32:06] sin right so that's what we're talking
[32:08] about tonight the original
[32:10] sin so now what is the original
[32:15] sin
[32:17] that we need to
[32:20] see that is still affecting us today
[32:24] when I told you whatever started in
[32:26] heaven came down to even the garden and
[32:29] is now prevalent today because we are in
[32:32] the Alpha and Omega the beginning was
[32:35] back there the ending is here and so is
[32:38] Satan amen telling the same lie that's
[32:41] right right now what did he tell Eve in
[32:44] the
[32:44] garden you shall not
[32:48] die right
[32:52] right simple plain language right you
[32:56] shall not die
[32:59] what is he telling the now forgive me
[33:02] just be with me what is he telling the
[33:05] basis of Christianity
[33:08] Today right you're born again y that's
[33:13] right you shall not
[33:16] die now may I quote brother Brandon do
[33:18] you need this one he said where at one
[33:21] time Satan used to tell you you was lost
[33:24] right yeah right
[33:27] but he says now Satan tells you you're
[33:31] saved
[33:36] right same
[33:39] lie Eve you shall not die
[33:47] y you were made for
[33:50] this you now will
[33:53] understand the great Mysteries
[33:57] and know all about the the creations and
[34:01] the things and all about the situations
[34:04] does that bring you down to where we are
[34:06] right where is there a group of people
[34:08] in the world today that is advanced in
[34:12] understanding of natural and spiritual
[34:15] things any more than the Believers of
[34:18] this end time message amen that's right
[34:20] absolutely right right when we could
[34:23] baffle the scientific world with our
[34:27] knowledge right coming from a seventh
[34:29] grade education man right that's right
[34:33] you're
[34:34] right you understand what I'm saying
[34:38] amen the same lie that he told
[34:41] Eve you shall not
[34:46] die now you say unto the people in the
[34:49] end time you shall not
[34:55] die did you you be as Gods y knowing all
[35:00] the
[35:02] Mysteries you know and Paul said we
[35:05] could is that right amen Paul said you
[35:08] know all Mysteries and not have love
[35:10] right that's it
[35:14] m so then we're sitting in the same
[35:17] situation the original sin that started
[35:20] in heaven was transmitted down to earth
[35:23] right and we're sitting in the same
[35:25] situation of that sin
[35:29] even to what I was trying to bring out
[35:31] the other day see because he told Eve he
[35:34] said you'll be as God right but I don't
[35:37] want to be as God right right
[35:42] amen come
[35:44] on I don't believe a child of God is as
[35:47] God all right right amen I believe a
[35:50] child of God is God Amen in another form
[35:54] amen called a son amen
[35:58] well
[36:00] amen what if that could be part of the
[36:07] LIE see you're only going to be able to
[36:11] understand and be able to fight Satan if
[36:15] you have the new birth
[36:18] right amen if you don't you're going to
[36:21] be caught am I am
[36:25] too in El Li right right that's right so
[36:30] now is it tying together with you
[36:34] right go remember what we brought out
[36:37] that Satan starts off be as God y then
[36:40] he comes up sitting in the temple of God
[36:42] to show him himself to be as God or
[36:44] whatever in Isaiah but then when he gets
[36:46] over in the end time right he says to be
[36:52] God right and you know what we just read
[36:55] in the Bible
[37:00] for this
[37:02] cause God has sent them a strong
[37:07] delusion yeah
[37:11] Amen to believe the
[37:14] lie Y and be damed God would do
[37:22] that God sends God permits the delusion
[37:27] he doesn't send it
[37:29] right he permits it to come into being
[37:32] right right why to try us amen right
[37:36] remember the other day and they in here
[37:37] again where brother around said this
[37:39] bride is to prove well it's number three
[37:42] on the notes but hold on we got to get
[37:43] number two first we she's to prove to
[37:46] Satan that she won't fall for that lie
[37:48] right amen we're here on the ground to
[37:52] fight it out with the devil and watch
[37:54] when you get on up here where it's at
[37:55] we're in the head all right
[37:58] amen all
[38:03] right going up let's pull this up while
[38:05] we at it number two the first seal 3:10
[38:09] 1963 B18 that other one was the first
[38:12] seal paragraph
[38:14] 87 U that we just went off where we were
[38:17] talking about it should be translated
[38:19] thei all right
[38:24] look God said if they want
[38:27] it just let them have it
[38:31] yep now he didn't make nobody do
[38:34] anything did he but he says if that's
[38:36] what they want let them have it and I'll
[38:40] actually make them believe that that's
[38:43] the truth cuz I'll give them a reprobate
[38:46] mind concerning the
[38:48] truth that's
[38:50] right now folks that's not
[38:53] trinitarianism
[38:55] right that's not
[38:58] denominationalism of what church we
[38:59] should belong
[39:03] to there's no strong delusion in that is
[39:07] there
[39:09] n because if you want to go to it you go
[39:12] talk to one group of people and they'll
[39:14] tell you that they're the ones with the
[39:16] truth and this other group ain't but you
[39:17] move up to that group and they'll tell
[39:19] you they the truth and they ain't
[39:21] everybody believes they in the truth
[39:23] right that's right but what what if we
[39:26] have a reprobate
[39:30] mind you know that God never gave you
[39:32] the reprobate
[39:34] mind he would be the author of rep
[39:37] probation or how You' say it the author
[39:38] of doing wrong
[39:40] right but he knew what we'd
[39:45] want he knew that Eve would want to
[39:49] believe Satan's
[39:51] lie come on he's not God if he didn't
[39:54] that's right right he couldn't make her
[39:57] believe
[39:58] it but he
[40:00] knew to give her a
[40:04] choice she would wind up into that lie
[40:08] yep and sin would come into
[40:11] origination all right look at the next
[40:14] one
[40:20] then God of his evil age paragraph 37
[40:24] 1965 801 with we find that this Evil
[40:27] Ages to prove to Satan she is not like
[40:30] Eve that she is not that type of a woman
[40:33] what and she will be Tried by his
[40:36] word the Bride As Adam's bride was Tried
[40:40] by the
[40:42] word you're going to be Tried by the
[40:44] word amen now what does that
[40:51] mean what did Eve fall on let's go and
[40:54] reading and Adam's bride believe
[40:56] believed every bit of the word all but
[40:59] confused on one
[41:05] promise that he's the same yesterday
[41:07] today and forever failed on One Promise
[41:10] under the temptation of the enemy face
[41:12] to
[41:15] face now what is brother random talking
[41:20] about she believed everything but
[41:23] Hebrews
[41:25] 13:8
[41:29] see Satan convinced her that God would
[41:32] not keep his
[41:34] word cuz his word said you eat thereof
[41:38] you're going to die right
[41:41] right Satan said n no no no you don't
[41:47] understand he ain't going to kill you
[41:49] cuz you're so
[41:51] wonderful he just can't do it without
[41:55] you
[41:57] she really got buil up then didn't she
[42:00] right what
[42:04] happened she believes Satan's lie now
[42:07] brother R said to believe Satan's lie to
[42:09] serve
[42:10] Satan that's his words to believe
[42:13] Satan's lie to serve
[42:16] Satan now you getting what I'm talking
[42:18] about what was her lie what was the lie
[42:21] you shall not
[42:23] die you are the bride of
[42:27] Adam God created you they're just
[42:30] withholding the secret little things
[42:32] from
[42:33] you the great
[42:39] Mysteries what about
[42:45] today how come today that you
[42:49] have people that won't come to
[42:53] church right they go to church church is
[42:56] where they play tapes and things ain't
[42:59] none of my business I'm preaching that's
[43:01] where y'all get me wrong you think I'm
[43:03] beating on something like that no I'm
[43:05] talking to you amen I'm not talking to
[43:08] the internet I'm not talking to people
[43:10] listening out there they listen all they
[43:11] want to I'm not talking to anybody out

[43:25] pastor if you want to listen that's your
[43:27] business I pastor this
[43:31] church all
[43:33] right
[43:36] now what would be the
[43:41] thing that would come into
[43:44] view from Eve
[43:48] and the situation of
[43:51] Adam and Satan you know through the
[43:55] Beast
[43:59] and brother randam said we're all
[44:02] born and watch it he didn't say we're
[44:05] born from the Beast and eat now he
[44:06] didn't say that cuz you only split half
[44:08] the condition there cuz there was two of
[44:10] them you know Cain and a one from one
[44:13] side one the other side all right but he
[44:16] said we're all
[44:18] born
[44:20] between Satan and
[44:24] Eve right
[44:26] now brother D my Mom and Daddy was holy
[44:28] sweep people away
[44:31] amen did that make you anything no
[44:35] that's right if you think it did you got
[44:38] a problem right that's right that's
[44:41] right but what was
[44:44] her
[44:49] situation that would have to come
[44:53] down and be the same situation
[44:57] here I'm talking about the end time now
[44:59] now we're we're not talking about down
[45:00] to the ages or nothing that's what I'm
[45:01] trying to preach it sin in Heaven Sin in
[45:04] the garden sin here the original
[45:08] sin all
[45:09] right
[45:11] now in the garden you find God coming
[45:15] down in the cool of the day right right
[45:19] amen you
[45:22] find
[45:24] Adam you find Eve
[45:27] eat and you find the
[45:31] Beast all
[45:35] right now if she disbelieved Hebrews
[45:41] 13:8 what would be our
[45:46] disbelief
[45:50] right what would be the disbelief
[45:54] today
[45:58] now brother randam said spoken words
[46:00] Original Seed you go
[46:03] back he said she couldn't
[46:06] wait that's
[46:08] it
[46:10] amen now who was it she couldn't wait
[46:17] on she couldn't wait on her head which
[46:19] was Adam right amen you agree that's
[46:23] right
[46:24] amen
[46:27] she couldn't wait on her head which was
[46:31] Adam all
[46:34] right now what would it be in the end
[46:39] time from that same quoting there of
[46:42] spoken word Original Seed I'm pretty
[46:44] sure if not I can find it in a hurry for
[46:47] you brother brand said so is it in the
[46:50] end time right
[46:53] amen so they can't wait
[46:58] wait for the Holy
[47:02] Ghost to get
[47:07] into anybody want to help me
[47:15] there couldn't wait for the Holy
[47:19] Ghost to get into the five-fold
[47:24] ministry
[47:29] uhoh did that strike home
[47:32] amen did that get down under your fifth
[47:35] rib you
[47:39] know what's wrong with the people of
[47:41] this
[47:43] message I hope you were listening to the
[47:45] situation L that there was God y there
[47:48] was Adam there was Eve and there was a
[47:53] beast
[47:54] now we've had God through a
[47:59] prophet are you listening to bring us a
[48:03] message
[48:05] right just like God was walking in the
[48:08] cool of the evening with them
[48:12] amen we've had God to bring us a message
[48:15] to a prophet amen that he walked in the
[48:18] cool of the evening with the bride of
[48:20] Christ and showed signs and
[48:23] wonders amen vind ating the
[48:27] man of the word that he was
[48:32] bringing but then all at once something
[48:36] happened and the the man was removed
[48:39] from the
[48:45] situation now the people don't know what
[48:47] to
[48:48] believe come on that's
[48:51] right I didn't write the
[48:54] book
[48:57] I just try to tell you what the book
[49:02] said so Eve wouldn't wait on her
[49:08] head her headship was the word in
[49:13] Adam
[49:19] right Satan through the
[49:23] Beast just simply got hurt to disbelieve
[49:26] that Adam would ever tell her the truth
[49:29] that's
[49:34] right he said brother Dale you always
[49:36] preach deep I I can't see where there's
[49:38] anything deep about that that's just as
[49:41] simple you say yeah it is cuz you
[49:43] studied it out no what's what's hard
[49:45] about believing that right am I right
[49:49] there was Adam there was Eve there was
[49:51] the
[49:52] Beast there was God there was Satan
[49:54] trying to do all his
[49:58] and Eve wouldn't wait on Adam to tell
[50:00] her y
[50:05] right well we got the prophet's
[50:09] message thank God for all of the
[50:11] printers and the things that's put it
[50:12] into books and textes and computers and
[50:15] things like thank God for it that's
[50:17] right
[50:18] right as I said we have the answer to to
[50:22] all of the questions of life
[50:27] planets and worlds and what's to
[50:36] come but you know there was
[50:38] a fivefold Ministry guy in the garden
[50:42] MH they just called his name
[50:45] Beast
[50:49] y are you listening that's
[50:52] right let called his name Beast you
[50:56] he didn't have
[50:58] one the Beast began to
[51:03] explain what Adam was supposed to
[51:09] explain
[51:12] that's so now we come down in the end
[51:15] time and we're standing down here with
[51:17] the prophet's
[51:20] message the prophet is not here to be
[51:22] able to explain it to us
[51:25] but I don't think he needs to be right
[51:28] right all but that's I think the Holy
[51:30] Ghost supposed to do it that's right
[51:32] brother R said they couldn't wait for
[51:35] the Holy Ghost to get into the to the
[51:38] ministry and
[51:40] express what was being
[51:46] said bless God I don't have to depend on
[51:48] no preacher okay bye Eve
[51:53] right that's right come on on not a
[51:59] joke truth right
[52:03] amen but I can get it for myself that's
[52:05] where the trouble
[52:07] is that's that same
[52:11] woman that thought she could get it for
[52:14] herself that was in the
[52:18] garden now let's take her for a
[52:22] second Now Eve was the first woman
[52:25] preacher you agree
[52:28] y I don't have nothing to do with women
[52:30] preacher forget that right I ain't going
[52:33] to argue with nobody whatever to
[52:35] do not throwing off on them or nothing
[52:38] just trying to make a
[52:41] point Eve preached to the
[52:44] Beast did we read
[52:47] it Eve told the Beast what God
[52:52] Said right and who was the god that told
[52:56] her that
[52:59] Adam right
[53:01] right
[53:05] amen Adam told her you know don't
[53:10] do and she become a
[53:12] preacher she preached to the
[53:19] Beast the Beast was probably what is the
[53:22] word astonished by her
[53:27] answers but Satan wouldn't right cuz
[53:32] that's what he wanted her to do
[53:34] yep he wanted her to preach the gospel
[53:37] to
[53:38] him where he could show her the loop
[53:42] hold the
[53:46] problems the things that she needed to
[53:52] know right you you'll be as God knowing
[53:56] good and evil
[54:00] right
[54:03] okay so what happens
[54:09] then what's happened to the end time
[54:11] people
[54:13] right I told you I'm not preaching
[54:15] somewh else so I'm talking here
[54:18] now I know I get in trouble trying to to
[54:21] preach to you try because people sitting
[54:23] there looking at me say I believe
[54:24] everything the prophet say
[54:27] is you believe that when you was a
[54:29] trinitarian too you believed everything
[54:31] the Bible said to you about a trinity
[54:33] being
[54:35] true I'm not somewhere else I'm
[54:37] preaching to you and me
[54:42] tonight because that same lies right
[54:45] here amen
[54:48] right brother D don't you believe that
[54:51] we have the Holy Ghost
[54:54] amen the prophet explained
[54:58] that said people say we don't have no
[55:01] need of a teacher or anything because
[55:03] we've got the Holy Ghost it's our
[55:06] teacher he said then why did God
[55:09] put teachers in the 5-f
[55:13] ministry amen right right
[55:18] amen you see that's what I tried to get
[55:20] you to see the other day and I still
[55:22] haven't brought that out really but the
[55:25] five-fold ministry is predestinated
[55:28] eternally from God because it's in the
[55:31] word
[55:32] right naming them
[55:37] Etc the nine spiritual
[55:40] gifts is listed in the Bible and talks
[55:43] of but it's not predestinated eternally
[55:45] because that's what your Prophet had to
[55:46] say
[55:48] all see then that's a
[55:51] gift to the church right
[55:56] is the fold
[55:58] Ministry what is their
[56:01] job brother brandom what is the fivefold
[56:04] ministry to do do you need this
[56:07] quote he said they'll they'll take these
[56:10] big nuggets that I have brought or
[56:12] nuggets or whatever use the word there
[56:14] right and he said they'll break them
[56:16] down right amen right to the
[56:22] people that's what the church couldn't
[56:24] wait on
[56:28] right what would have happened had the
[56:31] had Eve not listen to the Beast all this
[56:34] wouldn't have took place true right what
[56:38] would have happened if the Angels had to
[56:39] listen to Lucifer none that would have
[56:41] took what would have happened if
[56:44] everybody would have stayed with what
[56:45] Paul
[56:46] said
[56:48] right wouldn't be no problem with right
[56:51] that's
[56:52] right so Satan had to attack the
[56:57] word that's what brother R
[57:01] says to try to get people to not believe
[57:07] what the Bible said right to try to get
[57:10] people to not believe what brother
[57:12] Brandon
[57:13] said
[57:17] yeah and to try to get the people to not
[57:19] believe what the fivefold ministry said
[57:21] hey and I'm number one okay to make the
[57:27] statement that the way most of the
[57:29] preachers of this message preach I don't
[57:31] want to listen to them amen that's right
[57:34] amen yes sir I don't mind saying that
[57:38] Amen Brother D no I'm not
[57:43] judging I'm just telling it like it is
[57:45] amen right I wouldn't want to listen to
[57:48] it that's right why because they're not
[57:50] saying what the Bible say am brother R
[57:52] said I'll be glad when a day comes
[57:54] that's right but people will look you
[57:56] straight in the eye and say you're not
[57:58] saying what Paul said
[58:00] amen that's right but of course that
[58:03] makes you very unpopular it's all right
[58:08] amen cuz popularity ain't going to it
[58:11] don't work right
[58:13] right we see gifts and callings are
[58:16] without
[58:17] repentance so there's a lot of people
[58:19] get gifts y that don't repent to get
[58:22] them right right
[58:25] you know that's right you don't make
[58:27] you're a Christian because that you you
[58:29] got a gift that's right
[58:36] right but now
[58:41] listen we read in the scripture that he
[58:46] gave some Apostles some prophets some
[58:48] evangelists some pastors some teachers
[58:50] for
[58:53] what what it for right for the
[58:56] perfecting of the
[59:03] Saints now perfecting there in a is a
[59:06] word which is used like
[59:11] completion of bringing it to a full age
[59:17] Etc it's not because I'm up here that
[59:20] that makes you
[59:21] perfect right no
[59:25] I believe everything brother brother I
[59:27] believe everything you
[59:33] say I've had people who say that to me a
[59:35] lot of time that didn't hang around too
[59:37] long that's all
[59:40] right I have no
[59:45] problem but what about turning
[59:49] down the fivefold ministry
[59:53] right
[59:55] would that be the same as Eve not
[59:58] believing Hebrews
[1:00:02] 13:8 right
[1:00:05] okay pull up number
[1:00:09] four sir as we would see Jesus
[1:00:14] 54328
[1:00:18] e35 let's let brother brandom answer
[1:00:20] that question brother brandom does
[1:00:22] Hebrews 13:8 tie together with the
[1:00:24] five-fold
[1:00:26] ministry
[1:00:29] okay God has men to build houses he has
[1:00:32] some to preach the gospel some to teach
[1:00:36] God has set God has set in the church
[1:00:38] first apostles prophets teachers
[1:00:40] evangelist and Gifts of healing and
[1:00:42] working of Miracles and so forth Aller
[1:00:46] the perfecting of the Saints Jesus
[1:00:49] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:00:52] forever
[1:00:53] am
[1:00:55] all right so it puts together what
[1:00:58] happened in the
[1:01:01] garden Eve disbelieved Hebrews 13:8
[1:01:04] right Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:01:06] today and forever come on so she
[1:01:08] disbelieved the ministry that was there
[1:01:10] that she should have listened to right
[1:01:12] amen which was her head
[1:01:18] amen see now he's made us come to the
[1:01:21] end
[1:01:23] time and then we can be in Satan's
[1:01:29] delusion by not putting our confidence
[1:01:32] in the
[1:01:41] ministry to believe that they of
[1:01:49] God could we be standing like
[1:01:53] Eve
[1:01:58] M look at the next gifts preaching 19 56
[1:02:03] 1207
[1:02:09] E28 what there are in the church five
[1:02:12] offices Apostles or missionaries either
[1:02:14] one both the same thing word means one
[1:02:18] cent and apostles Prophet teachers
[1:02:21] evangelist pastors God said to them in
[1:02:23] the church
[1:02:25] but because we would be an
[1:02:28] apostle the prophet couldn't
[1:02:32] say you're not in it so it's not a
[1:02:36] onefold ministry that's right amen right
[1:02:41] is that what he's saying right are the
[1:02:43] pastor to the Evangelist or so forth but
[1:02:47] they're all little
[1:02:50] lines are you reading it all little Lin
[1:02:54] lines of God that's put into the church
[1:02:57] for the perfecting of the

[1:05:59] to keep a couple of eggs and an extra
[1:06:01] biset something work you
[1:06:05] know what about it I didn't write the
[1:06:09] book I didn't make the statements the
[1:06:11] prophet
[1:06:12] said that the 54 Ministry was for the
[1:06:15] perfecting of the Saints I didn't write
[1:06:17] the book that said the f full ministry
[1:06:19] was for perfecting
[1:06:21] the and perfecting means completion
[1:06:24] right
[1:06:27] right and brother brandom I don't know
[1:06:29] where got it in
[1:06:31] here but he was saying like fill me up
[1:06:35] in the Statue of perfect man right long
[1:06:38] into the back of it he's talking about
[1:06:40] fill me up Lord that I might teach
[1:06:42] others Apostles prophets evangelist
[1:06:43] Pastor teachers for
[1:06:46] the bringing of these things into the
[1:06:49] body right how you going to climb up
[1:06:51] statue of perfect man well I just
[1:06:59] jump what about
[1:07:03] it okay that's the next
[1:07:05] one Anderson which stat perfect man
[1:07:09] paragraph
[1:07:10] 45 62 10:14 the morning for God has set
[1:07:14] in the church Apostles Prophet teachers
[1:07:16] pastors V all for the perfecting and
[1:07:19] bringing all these virtues into it for
[1:07:21] that perfecting of the for that that
[1:07:24] Perfection of the coming of the Son of
[1:07:32] God now he ties it together with the
[1:07:35] coming of the Son of God and the
[1:07:36] five-fold ministry and the perfecting of
[1:07:37] the
[1:07:38] Saints do we believe
[1:07:42] that
[1:07:45] right is our dependence
[1:07:48] upon Perfection coming to us lying
[1:07:51] within the five-fold ministry
[1:07:54] or is it something we think we can do or
[1:07:58] have not done or
[1:08:00] whatever
[1:08:03] Y what about
[1:08:06] it brother D it just sound like you're
[1:08:08] trying to scare us and pull us to
[1:08:13] yourself I can't change your mind on
[1:08:16] what you
[1:08:17] think but I've been here 40 for 35
[1:08:22] years and I I don't see too much pulling
[1:08:25] going
[1:08:28] on I didn't come and get you in the
[1:08:30] churches you were in you came
[1:08:35] here if I've ever produced a point of
[1:08:37] you thinking that brother Dale thinks
[1:08:39] he's a number one
[1:08:41] guy you better believe you missed it
[1:08:44] that's
[1:08:46] right I've got to depend upon the
[1:08:48] five-fold ministry myself that's right
[1:08:50] that's where you can't get preachers
[1:08:51] depend upon preacher nope
[1:08:54] I oh they quote five four minutes were
[1:08:57] perfecting the Saints but where do they
[1:08:59] use the ministry or what do they
[1:09:03] do that's why congregations are starving
[1:09:06] to
[1:09:07] death right brother and people are
[1:09:09] leaving congregations because that they
[1:09:12] won't move
[1:09:15] on I didn't do
[1:09:18] that but you see
[1:09:22] folks the greatest battle ever
[1:09:26] fought started in heaven right go these
[1:09:30] are on the quotes we won't read them
[1:09:32] they get the last one
[1:09:34] but the greatest battle ever fought the
[1:09:37] prophet of God preached the message he
[1:09:39] said sin didn't originate on Earth said
[1:09:41] it originated in heaven that's right
[1:09:43] that's right y when they disbelieve the
[1:09:46] word of God to take their own
[1:09:52] ideas then that that made those
[1:09:56] things he said
[1:09:59] those angels that
[1:10:03] fa he said D even give us a nature
[1:10:07] y That's
[1:10:09] right now don't talk about giving us a
[1:10:12] soul now get taught the wrong time
[1:10:15] that's
[1:10:16] right they pervert
[1:10:18] us because D's work to come
[1:10:22] to
[1:10:25] then you see
[1:10:27] spirits y
[1:10:32] spirits and you see them
[1:10:35] manifested and you see Baptist Methodist
[1:10:39] Presbyterian Pentecostals
[1:10:43] Brites okay that's what the other
[1:10:44] preachers they don't never bring that
[1:10:46] word in on end right
[1:10:48] they
[1:10:50] Lula you
[1:10:52] know what kind of act do we
[1:10:57] need
[1:10:59] Spirits get into people and cause them
[1:11:02] to form
[1:11:04] denominations Spirits get into people
[1:11:07] and cause them to form organizations
[1:11:09] which is the step before denomination
[1:11:11] brother R say you can't denominate this
[1:11:13] message but he said you can organize it
[1:11:15] and let you see
[1:11:18] it that's right so look about the world
[1:11:20] today and see what it
[1:11:22] is
[1:11:25] but see the battle went from an angels
[1:11:27] in heaven it came to Earth the prophet
[1:11:30] said and started and he said there had
[1:11:33] to be a mutual ground for it to start in
[1:11:35] he said so it was started in the human
[1:11:39] mind
[1:11:42] now the human mind of an
[1:11:49] individual it can be wonderful or it can
[1:11:51] be damaging that's right
[1:11:54] it's going what you use it
[1:11:58] for they used it to make gunpowder and W
[1:12:01] up killing people he used it to make
[1:12:04] guns wind up killing he used to make
[1:12:05] airplanes wind up killing he used it to
[1:12:07] make
[1:12:09] bombs the human
[1:12:14] mind you see Eve in the human mind was
[1:12:18] trying to face Satan now listen to this
[1:12:22] point if you agreed a while ago about it
[1:12:25] that she didn't listen to her head and
[1:12:27] didn't stay with the ministry of the
[1:12:29] hour listen to this
[1:12:32] point she was attacked in her head yep
[1:12:37] not in her
[1:12:39] heart that's right you read it go
[1:12:43] ahead Satan's attack is through the mind
[1:12:46] run around and said God's approach is
[1:12:48] through the heart right right so Eve in
[1:12:53] Head Thought she could fight it
[1:12:59] out no man quote brother
[1:13:02] brandom is a match for the
[1:13:08] devil none of those prophets or anybody
[1:13:10] was a match for the Devil the only match
[1:13:13] for the devil's ever been was the Lord
[1:13:14] Jesus Christ that's right
[1:13:17] amen until even Gabriel the great
[1:13:21] Archangel could be h Ed by
[1:13:26] Satan but Michael couldn't
[1:13:30] amen all
[1:13:32] right so the battle started in the human
[1:13:38] mind and that human mind Satan began to
[1:13:41] try to get her to
[1:13:43] reason and she went to her
[1:13:47] heart and tried it by the
[1:13:52] word it would would not have fallen
[1:13:54] there would have been no
[1:13:56] fall see our human brain is what Satan
[1:13:59] starts
[1:14:01] in right yep and begins to work on us
[1:14:04] that's
[1:14:05] right because your spirit connects to
[1:14:08] your brain don't ask me I don't know how
[1:14:10] I'm just talking all right memory reason
[1:14:13] conscious affections and things we talk
[1:14:15] about that Spirit realm but where do it
[1:14:17] work through it has to work through the
[1:14:18] human
[1:14:22] brain
[1:14:23] am I right right brother Rand said those
[1:14:27] senses are fine if they're lined up with
[1:14:31] the word
[1:14:33] right but he said if not
[1:14:38] right then they become the Devil's
[1:14:41] Playground right right brother R I
[1:14:43] believe it's Blasphemous night I know
[1:14:45] excuse me Grace about fault that he said
[1:14:48] eve got her
[1:14:50] flu stopped up right Amen in other words
[1:14:55] her memories and conscious affections
[1:14:57] Etc her flu you know what flu are like
[1:15:00] on a stove and the pipes on the you know
[1:15:03] heater and different
[1:15:04] things somebody on the internet might
[1:15:06] not understand what I'm saying but it
[1:15:08] just simply means she let him stop up
[1:15:12] those things right with his word
[1:15:19] yeah cuz he took God's word and
[1:15:21] perverted it Satan don't have a word he
[1:15:22] don't have seed that's right he took
[1:15:25] God's seed and perverted it God's word
[1:15:27] and perverted it and in her mind she
[1:15:29] began to
[1:15:30] reason y I don't need that I don't need
[1:15:35] to find full
[1:15:37] ministry y I just get it
[1:15:41] myself I can read the books and listen
[1:15:43] to The Taste and hear it exactly from
[1:15:45] the
[1:15:51] prophet I didn't write the book as I I
[1:15:53] keep saying God wrote the book
[1:15:58] right see it was thrown down to the
[1:16:01] human and it become into
[1:16:04] humans brother Brown said he started to
[1:16:07] try to
[1:16:08] destroy God's creation that's right
[1:16:12] that's in greatest battle
[1:16:14] ever to try to destroy God's
[1:16:19] creation so you see Cain killing a
[1:16:25] y you see the battle from then on of
[1:16:28] mankind that we'll get into more Sunday
[1:16:30] and going on with
[1:16:33] it it started in the human
[1:16:39] mind because Satan knew if he could get
[1:16:42] into that
[1:16:43] mind come on through reasoning memory
[1:16:46] conscious effect and all that works
[1:16:47] through that he knew if he could get her
[1:16:49] to stay in that
[1:16:52] real then it would produce whatever he
[1:16:55] desired
[1:16:58] see so no telling how long it took him
[1:17:01] there to reason with
[1:17:04] her she wasn't trying to be a bad woman
[1:17:07] brother Brown said there's no n goes to
[1:17:08] these convents and all to be a bad woman
[1:17:11] said she goes there to
[1:17:14] pray and commit her life to God but said
[1:17:18] she winds up being a prostitute to the
[1:17:20] priest
[1:17:22] right
[1:17:24] she didn't go there for that
[1:17:27] purpose she was blinded in her mind
[1:17:34] right decisions is what's made in the
[1:17:41] mind jump over Brother Anderson to
[1:17:44] number 10 let's read number 10 number 11
[1:17:46] okay the greatest battle of Vault
[1:17:49] paragraph
[1:17:50] 400 62 311

[1:17:55] attack listen his attack watch listen
[1:17:59] close this Clos his attack is what
[1:18:02] disbelieve God's word and that's his
[1:18:04] attack there can you see the greatest
[1:18:06] battle was ever fought there's only two
[1:18:08] forces Satan and God and what is Satan's
[1:18:11] weapon against
[1:18:14] you is to try to get you to disel your
[1:18:21] weapon he disarms you what is your
[1:18:24] weapon the word right come on we don't
[1:18:26] have to do it all do we he disarms you
[1:18:30] let's let's listen real quiet now listen
[1:18:32] and if he can get you to disb believe
[1:18:34] your weapon is
[1:18:36] equivalent if he gets you to believe
[1:18:38] that your weapon is not strong enough
[1:18:41] he's disarmed you right look he's
[1:18:45] disarmed you when you get when he gets
[1:18:47] you to disbelieve that weapon when you
[1:18:50] lay that down that finishes your fight
[1:18:54] you're done hold that weapon don't you
[1:18:57] lay it down we see his
[1:19:01] unbelief to get you to disbelieve your
[1:19:06] weapon Eve was fortified behind the word
[1:19:10] right she had her head which was
[1:19:14] Adam she had the Holy Ghost In the
[1:19:16] Garden leading them around y
[1:19:21] right and yet Satan entered through her
[1:19:26] mind and got her to disbelieve God's
[1:19:30] word what about here in the end
[1:19:33] time
[1:19:34] am you see we we spend a lot of time
[1:19:37] talking about a battle and what happened
[1:19:38] back Dar but go ahead brother Anderson
[1:19:42] pull up the next one the greatest battle
[1:19:44] ever
[1:19:45] fought paragraph
[1:19:49] 60 and so an Army in getting ready for a
[1:19:52] battle first there's got to be select
[1:19:55] some soldiers they got to be dressed for
[1:19:57] fighting they've got to be trained for
[1:19:59] fighting now listen and I believe the
[1:20:02] that the greatest
[1:20:04] battle that was ever
[1:20:08] fought is now ready to go in action
[1:20:14] right now he spent his whole point of
[1:20:17] the greatest battle ever fought in the
[1:20:19] human mind basically falling at back
[1:20:21] there right
[1:20:24] come on but then he drops it down to the
[1:20:30] end where we're at now
[1:20:34] right the battle is ready to
[1:20:36] go in the human
[1:20:39] mind right
[1:20:41] now you're sitting there saying I wish
[1:20:44] you'd shut up where I could get
[1:20:46] home I'm
[1:20:51] tired
[1:20:55] well who does he think he
[1:21:00] is I'm the bride of
[1:21:03] Christ I can't be
[1:21:06] deceived you know we quote that a lot
[1:21:09] and I know what the scripture said and I
[1:21:10] know what brother R said it's impossible
[1:21:12] for the true bride to be deceived but
[1:21:14] how you like this
[1:21:16] one he said if he didn't cut the work
[1:21:18] short frankly it would get them confused
[1:21:22] right
[1:21:23] right you want that
[1:21:27] quote he said he had to cut the work
[1:21:32] short that work there in the scripture
[1:21:34] where it said he do a short work that
[1:21:37] means he do a short word it's
[1:21:41] translated brother ROM didn't change it
[1:21:43] I didn't change it the translation in
[1:21:45] the original said it would be a short
[1:21:46] word right right
[1:21:50] man what
[1:21:54] we are to prove to Satan that we won't
[1:21:56] fall like Eve by disbelieving the
[1:22:02] word but you know
[1:22:04] what now let's get plain and blunt for a
[1:22:08] second you got to have the
[1:22:12] word before the possibility of
[1:22:15] disbelieving it can come to pass right
[1:22:18] do you agree that's right amen that's
[1:22:21] right Luke with a trinity couldn't
[1:22:23] disbelieve the seals you know come on
[1:22:26] marriage and divorce whatever you
[1:22:28] going there must be a falling away if
[1:22:31] there's a falling away you got to be
[1:22:33] somewhere to fall from right right
[1:22:38] right well bless God I'm glad at I'm at
[1:22:41] Lula where we got the word that if you
[1:22:43] make us the Apex of it I didn't if you
[1:22:46] do it then just remember we're the
[1:22:48] quicker ones to fall oh my because we've
[1:22:51] reached that place
[1:22:53] so be careful what you say about us oh
[1:22:57] you
[1:22:58] might be getting in bad
[1:23:01] shape but they never said
[1:23:04] that some of you say that I believe we
[1:23:08] have the word yes because we tried to
[1:23:10] stay with it
[1:23:11] amen and thank God for that we have used
[1:23:15] the fivefold
[1:23:20] ministry yep to try to bring that word
[1:23:27] amen as I've always told you if I knew
[1:23:30] where there was a prophet was a real
[1:23:32] Prophet not fly by nights and all that
[1:23:35] if I knew where there was a real Prophet
[1:23:37] anybody out there on the internet find
[1:23:38] give it to him and send it to him a real
[1:23:41] Prophet that can really has got the gift
[1:23:43] and don't worry about it if he comes
[1:23:44] here we'll know whether he's right or
[1:23:45] not right because if he discerns me out
[1:23:48] I don't mind telling him in a hurry hey
[1:23:49] you missed it
[1:23:51] right one brother was telling me one
[1:23:53] time he said something you know and we
[1:23:55] were at a church and he was talking
[1:23:57] about something he was like you know he
[1:23:58] was leading it like he had discernment
[1:24:01] well I'm not saying he didn't I just
[1:24:03] simply told him I said well if you ever
[1:24:05] discern me out you'll find out down
[1:24:07] inside of there there's something
[1:24:09] good well I don't mind that any
[1:24:11] Christian ought to say that you should
[1:24:13] say that that's right why would you be
[1:24:15] worried about being discerned out why
[1:24:18] would you be worried about being called
[1:24:19] out that's
[1:24:21] right right
[1:24:22] but it's like they used to tell about
[1:24:24] Jack Cole and them you know Jack Cole
[1:24:25] start calling it out and look back and
[1:24:28] brother Brown did too he start calling
[1:24:29] out people and telling them what they
[1:24:31] were doing and all at once the prayer
[1:24:32] line just start and everybody be just
[1:24:35] dropping out why people say boy bless
[1:24:38] God me I'm before I go for a prophet I'm
[1:24:41] going to pray that's good I
[1:24:45] seable but what are you afraid
[1:24:49] of Are You Afraid of the truth that's
[1:24:55] right why wouldn't we want to know the
[1:24:57] truth
[1:24:59] amen would you know what our problem is
[1:25:01] we cover up ourselves until we've got to
[1:25:03] where we can believe Satan's
[1:25:10] lie and he can tell us all how goody
[1:25:12] goody we are and how we believe the
[1:25:18] message and we can be right in the
[1:25:20] middle of the devil's lie right right
[1:25:23] brother you you sure don't sound you
[1:25:27] know I just tell it like it
[1:25:35] is
[1:25:37] M see there ain't no hope for nobody
[1:25:39] outside of Jesus
[1:25:42] Christ that's my only hope always has
[1:25:45] been my hope and always will be my hope
[1:25:47] that's right is Jesus Christ that's
[1:25:50] right yes sir if there there's anything
[1:25:53] that's ever come from this man's lips it
[1:25:55] was Christ
[1:25:59] amen I'm talking about the right part A
[1:26:01] lot of the wrong Parts Old Samuel Dale
[1:26:03] yeah we agree with that everybody knows
[1:26:05] that no problem you just pray for me I
[1:26:09] have to answer for my attitude and my
[1:26:11] ways you won't have to right but we'll
[1:26:16] all answer for what we do about the word
[1:26:18] right now I hope you listen because I
[1:26:21] thought now
[1:26:22] you
[1:26:23] know like brother said eve failed on
[1:26:26] Hebrews 138 I mean I even had people to
[1:26:28] question me here about it say well well
[1:26:30] brother D I don't understand that what
[1:26:31] does that mean well I didn't understand
[1:26:34] it too well
[1:26:37] either but sometimes when I start
[1:26:39] preaching God can use the old fell to
[1:26:41] bring out some things that's
[1:26:44] right I believe she turned down to 54
[1:26:47] Ministry now what what those 54 Ministry
[1:26:50] back there oh that
[1:26:57] something I don't see why they wouldn't
[1:27:00] right that's right there was a man
[1:27:01] standing there that was named Adam right
[1:27:04] that could name all the animals
[1:27:08] right why not come on brothers let's
[1:27:13] Stand
[1:27:14] Together think on these
[1:27:17] things what is the original
[1:27:20] sin to dis believe God's word
[1:27:25] right
[1:27:28] right you know why a lot of times
[1:27:30] Brother Dean I talking about this a
[1:27:31] minute ago you know and I don't say it's
[1:27:33] every time because God's testing you to
[1:27:35] do that but you know a lot of
[1:27:38] times we don't believe that we're healed
[1:27:41] but yet we say we are by our
[1:27:44] mouth we confess with everything except
[1:27:47] the
[1:27:48] heart cuz I've never said it from the
[1:27:50] heart that I was healed and it didn't
[1:27:51] take place that's right right
[1:27:55] H but I said it a lot of time to the
[1:27:58] head and still just as sick as could
[1:28:03] be maybe sometimes we're not getting
[1:28:05] down into the
[1:28:09] heart then there is times come on that
[1:28:12] brother around and said after all that
[1:28:14] you've done and confessed and set and
[1:28:16] all everything he said and you're not
[1:28:19] healed he said just stand right there he
[1:28:22] said CU God is trying you to see if
