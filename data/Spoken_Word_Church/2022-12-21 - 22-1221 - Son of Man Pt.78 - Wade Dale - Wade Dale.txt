we're all blessing each other I just talked to brother Mike I'll take a few minutes ago and he is um he's doing all right he is the only problem they have now is that uh they're looking at another brain bleed on the other side of his of his of his head they said is uh brain kind of at the uh when they had the accident it kind of was like a basketball it kind of went I said well at least it's full I mean at least you had I mean some of us probably you know be like this like what the old saying was about a BB in a boxcar but think of that one for a minute but he said that just keep praying for him uh he's calling off church for a few weeks to get on the men but uh the whole deal is is getting that uh stamp put in his heart where the aneurysm could be and they were going to do it um first of January but now they're gonna have to wait till the 27th of January to make sure that brain bleed doesn't uh uh according to him the doctor said it's getting better it's shrinking so we're just going to keep praying that everything's that everything shrinks down he's but remember him in his person he is is messing with his mind uh it's it's messing with his his psyche is messing with you know one we always ask why we we do ask why but there's a it's a purpose for everything I'm uh you know all the things that we go through in life is for a purpose you say well I got scars of this well maybe God lets you go through them so you can talk to somebody else about it tell them you went through it and look we made it through all right so you know if we were all if we all come here perfect was perfect we would never have a problem when when we surely wouldn't be able to talk to anybody that wasn't perfect so we all are imperfect as we were talking the other day about uh Bathsheba and the different ones there's only one Virgin Mary and that was the only one that produced a child and that was Jesus Christ everybody else had some scars everybody else had a past right so we do too so let's just remember brother Mike and Sister Janet in prayer and uh and and just remember his his thought process his his thinking and and not be depressed that depression man it'll it'll get you I know some of y'all been through it and you just got to get up and go and just remember that God loves you and we're praying for you we're praying for him also a couple of announcements we're going to since we're not going to be here this coming Sunday everybody have a very Merry Christmas and uh we will see you well brother Daniel Martinez will be here next Wednesday June and I are

we'll have brother Wayne out here about 30 minutes after service starts let him preach as long as he wants to and then we'll have songs I know some may be already getting some ready we'll have songs and testimony until midnight and then we'll be taking communion just like we always do and if you want to bring some finger food some sweets something very small not a not a meal but y'all done this before so you know what to do I don't have to announce what to do you know what to do all right bring some sweets and and uh if Sister Trudy McMillan's um watching in shrimp that's all I gotta say

right so just remember that also no service this coming Sunday um uh one more thing oh brother Joe Canada and sister Anna terence's um Anna not Anna Roberts are going to have colonoscopy tomorrow so remember brother Joe that's why he's not here he didn't take my advice about using a cork but he he just stayed home so sister Anna's having it so we need to really pray for her she's had some intestinal issues and um and we want to pray that the Lord that everything will be fine also brother Joe this is first one bless his heart but you know we're gonna pray that they don't find nothing either when they don't find anything they give you another 10 years or so to get over that one also January the first there'll be no service so let's just pray for them in this in the morning uh early I'm sure they're going to be be there and then also Hudson um we're praying for him with his with his stomach issues so and also remember I I since we're not going to be here next Sunday uh there's a group going to the nursing home to see brother Hal Thomas on January the 7th at 10 o'clock January the 7th at 10 o'clock at uh The Landings of Gainesville brother Joe has put it up here on the screen and I think he's got it on the website if you have any questions talk to him or brother Joe Salas about bringing instruments and singing and all that that y'all done maybe a couple of two three years ago it's been I guess before coven um that's been able to do that but I appreciate brother Joe Salas for bringing it back and and us going to see brother Howe would be a wonderful wonderful thing to do so we appreciate them doing that and we would love to support that so anybody wants to go they really love to see the young kids and the young adults the older people do and the singing and and the worshiping so that's a Ministry that's just as important as this right here all right that is a Ministry to the older people that don't hear that every Sunday just a little over 10 years ago and I woke up during it and I was laying there and I was looking at it and I was looking I thought oh that is so neat and when I said it they gave me some more stuff and put me to sleep but I thought let's read scripture thank you sister appreciate that there'll be no well we just close and go home I've got something in my head I can't get out I've had one too but I ain't gonna do that I'm not going to make a commentary on it okay so just pray for them tomorrow that the Lord will that listen that they will not find anything look at the procedures the procedure but finding nothing is what's good they thank God me and Mom both we had ours done last year and couldn't find nothing so so we're good huh I'm not commenting on that either so but uh listen I appreciate doctors I appreciate what they do I appreciate um uh we like we prayed for little Hudson last night but I told him also get some Epsom salt Epsom salt a little bit of Epsom salt and a Dr Pepper it will set you free so and it did help him and he really was uh didn't have to go through uh x-ray today so we thank God for doctors and the medicine that we have and we appreciate them but you know what we pray that the Lord will direct them to find everything right so that's what we're going to pray tomorrow for for sister Anna and brother Joe so just keep these all in your prayer and like I said there'll be no service this coming Sunday call somebody go see a family member call somebody you haven't talked to in a while and just tell them God bless you and you love them extend our love out to the people in the world this is a Dying World folks I'm telling you the more you listen the more you talk to people this place is it's hell on Earth we're just so protected a lot of times that God has protected us but people out there are struggling bad really bad and we appreciate um the Lord giving us a message of the hour more than ever the Holy Ghost but more than that too the message of the hour that we can that we can put on a tape or listen to some good preaching and that will just kind of soothe everything away so let's remember all these and let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this evening you give us the Lord middle of the week and Lord I didn't mention but this weather coming in Lord we know there's not going to be a lot of precipitation but there's going to be a lot of cold temperatures and Lord for all of us it has to go outside and work Lord I pray that you'd keep us healthy and strong Lord and being the temperatures are going to be so low there'd be ice and be as brother Terence said we need to make sure we check our water and all the pipes and the lines Lord we pray Lord that you would just we know it's winter time we know we're not going to have 70 degree weather but Lord just let it not hurt anybody let all the cars be able to start and let all the heaters be able to run and let us not be without electricity Lord because they're saying we're going to have some strong wind along with that cold and Lord that's a combination for limbs falling on on trees falling on power lines and us being without power and it being the teens that's really really dangerous but father we know you are the master of the Wind you control all things Lord and you knew this before the foundation of the world and you knew we would pray tonight earnestly that you would help us the next three or four days Lord and as we come to December the 25th we know you were not born on that day but we honor you Lord that that you did come as a child and you were born of a virgin you come exactly the way the scripture said and we are just going to Lord just enjoy our time off Lord and enjoy our family and giving gifts to each other father I pray this the greatest gift would be that someone will receive the Holy Ghost this weekend that someone would receive the word of the hour Lord and come home to you Lord we pray that you'd just be with brother Mike OT Lord just bless him Lord he's a he's been a soldier for years and years more than we've been a lot of people have been born in this building Lord and I pray that you would just help him Lord help him in his in his uh not be depressed and not be the that Satan will not get in his mind and start making him worry about things because worry the Bible says and fear makes torment and we don't want that for our brother Lord comfort him in his time of need Lord I pray that you should be with brother Joe and sister Angela in the morning Lord that they go through the procedures of the doctors Lord they can only do what they're doing but Lord You Are the Healer you're the one Lord that can prove to the doctors that everything's fine and there's no issues and Lord little brother little Hudson different ones Lord that need prayer sister Freedom

driving okay be here tomorrow should already be on the way all right they're my favorite people all right let's go part 78. tonight we're going to talk a little bit more about virtue and being about being virtuous because the Bible tells us we're going to read here and we'll let you sit down in the beginning was the word where it was with God and the Word was God in other words everything we talk about everything there is everything in the Bible was before the foundation of the world God knew it he saw it he predestinated it by foreknowledge he saw what was going to happen and he predetermined it wrote it in the Bible and put it up and let man come to the Earth and then we live through we are now living through our predestination so that word was made flesh and you and dwelt among us and we beheld as glory of the glory of the only begotten the father full of grace and truth you may be seated in the Lord has blessing just for a minute tonight good to have everybody back brother Louise uh and brother Aaron and brother Bob couldn't have each one of them back and thank you for uh going out and letting your light shine and we appreciate that amen so um Luke 6 verse 19 says the whole multitude started to touch him for there went virtue out of him now remember what is virtue virtuous strength virtue is when we're going to talk a little bit about The Virtuous life because that virtuous life is that's here in Proverbs 31 who can find a virtuous woman and we were talking about this Sunday and and it really struck me that that this is Solomon talking about his mama don't get quiet on me this is Solomon right in Proverbs talking about his mother his mother that was ravished by a king come on somebody taken against her will basically you can't call it rape because he was a king if she'd have said no he'd have killed her he was Cain nobody questioned it but Bathsheba then had to learn to live with that had to learn to live with David killing her own husband listen to this taking her for a wife and then the first baby they had it was it was killed all right but in all that she kept her integrity and all that Solomon as he grew up he looks back and he says and and I was listening to a brother the other day talking about this even in the uh in the uh Jews and they have like um it's in their tradition said that that Solomon had a strong but right beside his and I swear Bathsheba said that's how much he thought of his mother he was married a thousand wives but he loved his mother why because he saw her come from where she was come on somebody uh this is us we're talking about I read you the quote where brother Brown says Where The Virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ something's got to be transformed something's got to come to a place to where even though we came out of the pits of hell yeah we can be virtuous who can find a virtuous woman for what her price is far above rubies we're going to read in just a minute that a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband we'll talk about that in a minute you know Jesus Christ is talking about crowning him and crowning him and crowning him he can't wear but one crown you know who his crown is it's Pride his bride is his crown he can't wear but one Crown you can't put 25 crowns on his head no he's king of kings and Lord of lords but he has a crown around him which is called his bride that's what we're going to talk about just a little bit down here a little bit closer but thank God I was thinking yesterday morning about these mystery truths all these things and the seals that you and I uh and I know some that are new in the message they don't really see the seals but if you've been in the message a while it's just a wonderful thing that God opened that up to a group of people so that we can see the mystery truth and not have to wonder whether the Methodist is right or the Presbyterian or right or the Baptist or right or the Pentecostal right or the brandemites are right God's right and he sent us a prophet to give us these mystery truths that will literally turn us back to the faith of the fathers it's going to literally change our body all right so these mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so now how's it going to happen we've got to be Sanctified through the truth you can't be Sanctified through untruth now listen Luther Wesley they had some truth but remember they were reformers they're not restorers they were reformers they reformed you kind of like Alcoholics Anonymous they reform you but now they were Sanctified through their truth that they had for the day but they didn't have all the truth that's why they're laying in the grave that's why the Pentecostals that's why the Baptists that's why the people in Old Pentecost even new Pentecost they're laying in them there there they went down by the word that they had but it wasn't all truth Luther Wesleyan Pentecost until they had the Oneness movement they all are laying in the grave because they were filled with the Holy Ghost and baptized in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost thereby with me but now you and I can't take that today and say well I'll just no we had a Prophet come to open the book to bring us the truth not a truth he brought us the truth he said as thou has sent me into the world even so I send you into the world so he's sending us listen brother Ryan could have just stayed in Jeffersonville preached 1100 sermons he said I don't tape those don't worry about it no he knew he was going to be worldwide he knew that it would be the days of the voice of the seventh angel that when he begins to sound well come on let's be truthful when he was here nobody understood who he was just like Jesus Christ nobody understood who Jesus was when he was here but the group after come on somebody the group after one that understood the disciples on the dead Pentecost 120 as they went out into the world they understood why that man was doing what he did and said what he said after he left after you hear the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in other words after you get born again then we've got a a message that now we have been sent to send it to the world brother Joe Greene now is over in the Philippines he was asking me to go with him and I just couldn't because of the time period but he's over there now spreading the gospel praying the truth helping the people out and it's the truth I hate it and it's going to be on their head for these people that that say this message is wrong and then try to disprove it that's just like disproving that God's God can't do it that's just proven that the Lord was nobody but a but a uh just a good man a good Prophet you know that you still see that because their eyes have been blinded but when that veils comes off their eyes they're going to see that they're Messiah is who they killed but listen it's not going to be all Jews not every Jew over there it's only 144 000. not to four or five million that's over there now they're going to be just as lost as the rest of the Gentiles is lost and for their sake I sanctify myself why that he can turn and look at the disciples and say look you can live like me as I live in this world so do you as I was sent into this world as brother boy and I were talking sitting in there but remember they called him everything but God they called him a devil called him a wine bibber did you hang around and and sinners all the time you just all around all these people just a filthy bunch he said I didn't come to the people that wasn't sick he said I come to seek to sick people he came to sick people we needed him to heal us and then in our physical body and for their sake I sanctify myself that look that they also might be what Sanctified through the truth so now I believe we have the truth so let's just put that out of the way if you don't believe we have the truth you need to get that out of the way before you leave or you need to leave I mean really it's time to quit fooling around it's kind of need to get in or get out don't put one foot on this side of the fence in the straddle the fence nope remember Satan owns the fence but you see people in the messaging I think Junior and I were talking about this the other day that are always right on the line always right on that line just pushing the line you're gonna get sucked into the world is what you're going to get you're gonna get sucked in the world why not the Bible says flee from the appearance of evil flee flee from that fence that you think well maybe I can get by because my dress is not exactly the way they said and uh come on now we're going to either either live right or we don't live right we're going to get sucked into the world all right that's why I believe I believe church is not just because I say come to church but the Bible says come to church I get strength when I come to church I I get I get what I need from church tell me you get what you need out there no you get what you need in here this is what you live on as we're gonna see right here brother Brown said you're not you have a free world agency and then we're going to talk about we know we're talking about the middle round the spirit Realm but look if it's the spirit of God it'll feed on the things of God it won't feed on anything of the world all right so what do you listen I love steak most of you do too but now I don't like hummus that's for a different kind of people but you say well it's just still it's still food yeah but I don't like hummus I like to come to church on Wednesday night and get meat because I'm an eagle I'm not a worm that can eat that stuff sorry about that brother John you like hummus you don't thank you brother at least we're we're the only two I think there's others in here too but remember what do we feed on listen like brother Brown said so if you're gonna feed on the things of the world you'll like that but I like to feed on meat because I'm an eagle all right we we want to eat Eagle food that's why I come to church that's why I press play that's why I listen to the ministry all right now look brother Ryan tells us didn't the most important thing for us to do though is obeying what God Said do it's what brings your power all right let's just take it all in a nutshell you say well let's pray in this fasting that's coming to certain it is but let's just put it all into one thing obeying the word of God will bring you the power it will bring you virtue it's what brought virtue is obedience to the word of God and we read in first Samuel what about a prophet saying Saul kill them all get rid of them let's not ever see him on the face of the Earth again let's not have one of them little demons grow up to be a big demon hello somebody because if he's dead he won't bother you anymore but if you just put him in a closet or if you just like Saul was going to put him in a put them in a uh in a jail cell well they got a chance to get out and they steal your enemy I don't care if he's in the jail that's still your enemy Samuel said we're going to take care of that I told you to obey what God Said but you didn't so obeying is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of brown for Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft as I was telling you all before it and I'll tell you again Rebellion is not doing what God Said right coming to church late that's Rebellion because you know better but I get to church by the way that's not what the whole thing is the prophet of God said 20 minutes before the service starts you need to be in the sanctuary praying reading your Bible and some of you get here 20 minutes after so you're rebellious and a rebellious I'm just reading you what the Bible says Rebellion is the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness oh my right here buddy oh y'all point this way stubborn guy right here I'm working on it y'all y'all are helping me work on it too foreign stubbornness is as iniquity and adultery because you know not to do it you know not to be selfish or stubborn be stubborn because stubborn has nothing to do with God because what are we supposed to do I'm going to read you something in just a minute that's going to blow your mind what the brother Brown said about coming together as a virtuous woman and a man getting married which will be the type of us in Christ I hope y'all are seeing this this is not just women every time I say virtuous woman I'm talking about you if you're the bride not talking about you if you're not bride everybody with me all right these are all stories of virtuous women and now we are the bride listen there an example you're the real product I'm gonna read you here in just a minute we'll get to it I'll make sure we do if I have to scroll through all this because it's a wonderful quote very profound because thou Hast rejected the word of the Lord he has also rejected thee from being King all right so he what he took the kingdom away from Saul just because of one item one thing he disobeyed the word of God are they okay with that I'm reading the Bible now brother Brown says we're not building an organization this is why I want you to see we are built as individuals so I don't want you to look as we go up to Statue of perfect man and say well now Donnie he's just been Heap he ain't even well Lord I think he's just at Faith well that ain't none of your business okay you make sure wait Dale's at face and virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience and godliness you worry about yourself because Christ didn't send us to build this whole church as an organization Christ sent brother Branham me to build individuals to the statue of Jesus Christ that they might what be the powerhouse the PowerHouse and the dwelling place of the Spirit by his word I was just reading some quotes back here everybody was um you remember the the woman that committed adultery on her husband and then brother Brown discerned that she was going crazy she'd been to every doctor she had been to every place she could go and she comes to talk to brother Brown and brother Brown says you had an affair right when you first got married and you have not told that to your husband she says I can't do I can't tell him that he's a deacon of the church remember what brother Brown say he said well your husband's got the same thing to tell you about and she said no not my husband I was just reading it no not my husband there's no way he said okay lady he said if you want to be healed he said you go get your husband and you got to come back here and make it right because you didn't sin against God you're sitting against your husband so the story goes as you keep going on what happens they she comes and she said I gotta confess he said well she says now this man told me she didn't call brother and they said this man told me you were in a blue Cadillac with a girl with a pink dress works for Chevrolet and he said who told you that well brother Brown had discerned it but anyway instead of him saying bless God I'm just you know that's I'm the man I do what I want to do no they both got down on their knees they both asked forgiveness to each other they both came to brother Brown because brother Brown's wife said Billy you think they'll be back he said they'll be back he'd already seen it he said they'll be back and we're starting to a deacon in the church because they what they confessed it but he said he said lady he said what church do you go to he said brother John says he said no wonder Brothers Johnson church is not moving because of that one unconfessed sin of that woman that she did when she was a white probably wasn't even the church he said that devil will lay there until you get it out time to let it out folks time to confess it all we've all done things that we need to get rid of and we're not a Powerhouse yet somebody asked the other day said well what's holding us back each of our individual unconfessed sins you said I got to confess you need to confess to God if you did something wrong everybody with me Lord bless whoever that is if they had a wreck or something but he wants us to build up individuals and he told that lady he said lady they could have pour a 55 gallon drum of anointing oil on your head and he said it wouldn't do you any good right that one thing 55 gallons of anointed oil and it won't do a bit of good he said Satan has a right to stay right there now when they confessed and came back brother round said I laid my hands on her he said Satan now you have no right and he said the devil left her and he said they got back together reconciled with each other went back to church Powerhouse to me that made a Powerhouse of a church just because of us confessing all of our faults one to the other but that's the idea that when going up this pyramid onto your face virtue versus knowledge well now you're coming to a place and we know virtue we'll talk about this just for a minute virtue is what power anyone knows what the word virtue means we must have it virtue went from him to heal the woman that was sick he's expecting the same virtue in his church not a substitute the same identical why is it because it's him transferred into you it's him him the person of Jesus Christ transferred into your body yes what a paradox you're a walking Jesus Christ you just don't know it yet your mind has been so muddled and so so taken over by the world your memory reason contraception imagination is just bottling that thing up it's like an atomic bomb that goes off in a little bitty little bitty area about that big you've got it all locked up but when you ever let it get one crack let's let it out this year folks and let's just have one crack you get one cracking that thing will just explode and we'll become a better Church everybody wants to become a better Church don't we don't even want to be become a better church we want God to work in our life we want them not to just have dull services and and well well that one's that one was okay and and this one's all right brother Bob's a little off last night if somebody's back here preaching I just use Bob if somebody if somebody's up here preaching the word of God they ain't off if they're telling you the truth right it may be that you didn't like what Bob said which made him wrong but God didn't ask you if you thought it was right virtue in anyone else so I'll praise God anyone knows that the word virtue means see we must have it The Virtue went from him to heal the woman that was sick he's expecting the same virtue in his church because he was our example and if we had virtue to give to the people he expects us to have verse and if he had virtue to give to the people he expects us to have virtue to give to the people and what is virtue virtue is strength or power every once in a while go back and watch that uh movie of brother random of where he was in Washington D.C and watch that you watch him he's just he's preaching away and it don't look like he's he's not any kind of stress or or you know he's just preaching away and but all of a sudden when he turns that prayer line you see him start wobbling you see him start moving and you see brother Billy Paul reach and grab him under his armpits because he's so he what that's virtue that's the strength that people were pulling out of him because even brother random explains it thank God he did explain a lot of things to us he said now I can see certain Visions from God he said I can have 50 visions and it don't bother me one bit he said but one discernment on that platform because what that person's drawing it out of him when you're saying when you're seeing a vision it's not somebody grabbing or pulling anything but when you've got a person standing there and they're drawing strength from you it's coming from your human body and you become weak but thank God he's explained that brother Brown says you got to have virtue for what your community just your church yep no whole world if you have faith you must have virtue with it you have virtue for the whole world and he's talking about Reverend Mr Lilly what happened to Lily starts in the mud he pushes out and what happens to the Lily when it opens up the bee comes and gets the pollen like I was saying before and it still makes me chuckle a little bit when you go through a cemetery and you see all those plastic flowers and you see the bees you know you just see a bee flying over going this is great lands on that thing and goes hmm no virtue that's the same thing with me and you does the world see enough virtue in us to land on us and know they can get virtue out of us come on somebody I like it when it gets quiet with thinking it opens itself up for honey that's why a true pastor me me me me no what we open ourselves up we open ourselves up and and draw strength from that for the bee comes and gets his part don't complain it just gets it it's just got it to give out what if the bee comes in there insufficient funds no honey that will be would scratch his head and say what kind of Lily is that look he's not selfish he's got older before he can give out already he's got to have it before he can give out honey it's got to have it before you give out Beauty he's got to have it before you can give out virtue you have to have it so add to your faith virtue listen remember she touched not his physical body but she pulled out of him what she needed and then we're talking about the three pulls and we know what that is that's the pull to Ren to tear what she does is what she did is she tore the strength out of the Lord Jesus and those people at the platform they tore out of brother Brown they tore out now remember the first poll was he would take him by the hand now he didn't stagger during that time I mean we don't realize that but he didn't never say anything about getting weed but he said when he started doing the discernment when he started getting weak because he'd hold him by the hand and then his little pimples would come up and he'd tell them what it is but boy when he was digging into their life he was going into their soul he was going into the very being he wasn't just he wasn't just he wasn't just the outside guy holding the hand said well you know you got cancer we know he could tell them where that was at anyway so he was probably seeing a vision but when they come to that discernment that was really the Lord Jesus doing the Discerning it was not William Branham so when he entered that body you say well he was already in there by the Holy Ghost yes that's true but there's anointings why did Brother brown with the baptism of the Holy Ghost said he stood there and said I can't do nothing until he comes what you would think now as a human being you would think he had that inside of him already and he just thought blurted it out no special anointing that came to that prophet he said I'm waiting on him and he would say many times he'd say what did I just say he told one one time he said hey as listen to other days he said whatever I said lady was right now what's up he said but whatever until he depended on that was God telling he said lady whatever I said it was right you need to do that he didn't even remember what he said but we're sitting under the third pool we're we went through the first pool went second pull is what to me it's the virtues the third pull is coming we know that it's the opening of the seals but we've got to go through to draw the support or attention of I want the world to draw attention to me and you that we're different that we're not just the world with a little bit of extra on it are like brother Brown said some people have these virtues not even born again they're just good people like Brother Richard Wilson said he was working with a guy one time he said that guy was so Meek and Mild that he said I believe if you took his paycheck and said Ronnie I'm gonna take your paycheck and I'm you're gonna cash it and give it to me he said I believe the man to do it and he wouldn't he wouldn't get mad at you a bill that he'd never been mad today in his life well now boy his Temperance was gone because he had no temper but he probably was not born again and probably if he didn't get the baptism of Holy Ghost we know where he's at at the moment he's waiting his judgment but we want the world to be attracted to us through Jesus Christ not through me like the sports stars oh yeah there's a point there's a pool out there folks you know that it's pulling our young kids away pulling some of us away watch this instead of this go to a you know what well I'm gonna say it anyway hahaha you see people that can't come to church yet you see them at all kind of functions on Facebook so what can you draw strength from that is there any virtue in that nope nope there's no virtue in that we make all kind of excuses but you know what this is the hour and this is the day I was talking to somebody on the phone the other day this is the out you're going to manifest who you are oh brother Tim cross is going to be with us in February when I go to the wedding in Ohio if we're still doing that I think we are but he will be here with you that weekend bro Tim and I were talking about that so but just pray for him but that's what it is I mean if the world's falling apart and here we are still in the world but our discernment should be that it pulls out the virtues that's already in the Holy Ghost it's not that it's not that that you know here hold on this for a second all right that's virtue and I've got the Holy Ghost and I got to go and and buy it from somewhere it's already inside of you what you got to do is is what he said have an outlet gotta drill a hole played for the water to get out for the virtue to get out because listen you and I were born in sin and still have a sinful nature in the outside guy the memories and conservation imagination now inside if you're born again you don't have that so let's let that work more let's let that out more you say how read your Bible when you are reading something else or as Louise says when you got your Netflix owner what is it uh you all them ones you were talking about Sister Clay the toll toll brother Luis the other day she said I don't know what you talking about that Tick Tock and tender and all that well I don't even know what you're talking about thank God you don't know what he's talking about because I probably want I promise you one thing it is messing with people's minds hours included yeah it's what I said you can't come to church and sit in a church service for a couple hours but you can go to your kid's birthday party and set two or three hours it's all in what you want to do has nothing to do with well I might get sick or I might get when we gonna throw that devil out of here amen but remember it you got it but remember you can't be the Lily that's plastic and say Come on B yeah come on down here and then there'd be nothing there for the bee to get that be my sting you if it don't get honey it just might sting you if you don't get some pollen so I want to be cautious and not say well we just need to throw everything out to the wind you all know that we need to know that we know that we know we need to know that God's working in our life and that he is building us up to a Powerhouse of the word of God and then the third poll was what brother Brown said it can't be imitated it was the opening of the seal Satan doesn't know anything about this that's one thing Satan doesn't know about me and you it's how those seals open and they're going to change our body because see he can't take a body change so he can't be he listen he was the writers in the seal right he was the one that had the thing hid he was the one that got on his White Horse and wrote it through the people he got on his red horse brother Ryan said he got off the white one got on the red one and rode right through those denominations that's why the denominations have there's no denomination he's going to ever know what third pull is brother Ramsey no impersonate the first pull you can impersonate the second pull and plenty of people did but when you come to the opening of the word what do you do he stood by himself no one else came behind him except us because remember he said it's not for you it's not for the 1963 people sorry about that but I believe in dispensations this is a dispensation to know when brother Brown stood there said it's not for you said but right around the coming of the Lord these things will be made known well this is the coming of the Lord folks so these things are going to have to be made no we're going to have to come yeah but we can't get stuck in a second pool either this arm is good it's wonderful but think about this when you take that second pull and you listen to the tapes 99.9 of the time I can't remember one that didn't brother Branson I'm waiting on him I'm waiting on him if he doesn't come I can't do anything I'm waiting on him then he'd say he's here well now go to 1964 and 65 he had just small prayer lines then they weren't big auditoriums because they they didn't like his doctor no more he was preaching Doctrine and they didn't like it no more so only a few of the faithful ones were there but you know what he did when he got finished with a sermon look at a couple in 64 and 65. he starts Discerning right there he and God had something come so close together in those seals and in that in that headstone that he wasn't waiting on Jesus to come anymore we're not commissioned the bride's not commissioned to wait on Jesus Christ anymore brother Brian said I'm not saying he's coming I'm saying he's here but what is it herein he's here in discernment he's hearing the word of God and we're not waiting for the discernment to happen oh you're saying boy it makes you better than the prophet I can hear somebody thinking it right now no that doesn't he's the one that said it I didn't the Bible said in the days of the voice of the seventh angel well who's the voice of that seventh angel it is his bride the voice is in his bride [Applause] it's transferred off those books and tapes and become a Living Word of God it's become something that you and I just don't use as quotes anymore come on somebody we're living this thing out we're not prophesying anymore we're part of the prophecy we are the prophecy I can imagine them Apostles never acted like us now brother Brown's just ditching us pretty good right here I said I can imagine them Apostles never acted like us they went around probably meant a few words until they got In a Pulpit they walked in they've done what they were supposed to do and they walked out yes sir they had power they had virtue they had no arguments with men they knew where they stood that's all they knew who they believed they kept on walking in the spirit just as I said the other night that one little nod that's all God had to do then nothing was going to stop them now what we were supposed to be restored back to is everybody with me tonight we're supposed to be restored back to that I'm reading right here that's only in discernment though second Paul that's not the third ball right that's the second poll that's discernment of spirits they were able to discern as the first church age but they had nothing as far as the seals go listen John wrote symbols John didn't interpret he wrote symbols but oh praise God when he eat the book when he eat the buck that next group of people that he was being a part of but he was acting out the part of us eating the book we become the book and then the Bible says prophesy to many tongues many nations that's what we're doing look what's this they didn't question and study in hum Hall and worry like we do this is the prophet whether they should do this are whether they should do that they went ahead and done it anyhow just one little nod from God that done it just as soon I'll tell you it happened to me one time very privately one time we were in Jamaica dad and I we were up on the mountain they were getting ready to um build a church there called uh Ginger Hill the church hadn't been built yet big old huge tit they were several hundred people in under that tent and sister Brady was there and she just had her operation for breast surgery and she she had to hold her hand uh none of all I don't think been a part of it I got a neighbor not a neighbor but somebody's on my route your your arm it bothers you because they take all those lymph nodes out and they take the breast off they take the they take the muscles off and your arm just swells up it gets this big there's a customer I got Heather um matters she her hand is she's got a little compression thing on it to keep it because it's big because they took all the lymph nodes out well sister Bray they did the same thing she had her arm up like this right here in the service and she was just praising God we were just praising God and I preached on the vision that brother Branham dad you remember that I preached on Division remember brother Brown had a vision about Jamaica about people going up the mountain and coming back and up the mountain coming back and I told him I said you are now that Vision we were on top of a mountain we were on Ginger hill we were getting ready to establish the church and they were going every day up and down that mountain bringing us in and bringing us out dad preach the morning servants I preached the afternoon service and I told him I said you are now that Vision you're not a prophecy you're the people standing up brother around Saul your face he might not called your name but he saw you and boy the power of God hit that building and I did one thing that I regret to this day God told me he said speak to Sister Brady and she'll be healed and I didn't I didn't do it you know why I doubt it Paul yeah I'm sorry I'm supposed to be I'm going to be truthful and that that's bothered me that's been what about 20 years ago 15 years ago it bothers me to this day then I didn't go ahead and speak the auction you say well what if it didn't happen well I believe I finally said it it would have happened because I believe that was God Satan doesn't want you to get well right Satan does not want you to get better how many times did Brother Dale many times in a crowd you don't even know he's praying for you and you tell him about a problem you got he just walks behind you and grabs you back not your sisters we know that but he'll take you by the handshake hand and may give you that little extra squeeze you know what that is that's that virtue oozing out of his hand or or somebody like I had back trouble one time and Brother Dean the same way you just touch your back hug them in that you know just pound them on the back you ain't got to start screaming and shaking and shouting and everything else no just hug them in the neck say God touch them and guess what he did it and he's done it to us many many times folks that's that's virtue I missed that naughty you know she ain't got to hold her hand up like this but I'm gonna apologize to her when I get there when she comes back here and I glorified body and we'll say honey I'm sorry if I'd have said what I supposed to have said maybe you wouldn't had this trouble because she had trouble with that arm all the time she always had to keep it up over her head like this to keep circulation from making her arms swell up and I and I hate that what are you trying to say if you get an auction let it out Let It Go you know if I walk up brother and I say brother now you mind if I pray for you if he says no you don't need to pray for me there's nothing wrong with me they might be the next day but there might be something coming that God sees that he wants you to have a connection with we need to be probably I'm trying to say a little more spiritual than we all that we have been because that's what happened in the first church age they were a spiritual bunch of people they little not from God compared with every bit of this and with his word so there's healing in the word of God right there's faith in the word of God right Lay Your Hands on the seat in the shower cover I just reading just now was I was looking up something about I can't remember what it was he said you don't have to be a deacon you don't have to be a preacher he said the Bible says lay hands on the set he said you sisters lay hands on the set y'all feel somebody having trouble go lay hands on them the first little knot of God compared with everybody listen with his word they note it was the word of God and look away they went didn't have to worry about nothing you know what we have to worry about now we have to worry about a denominational demon a whirly demon a Wi-Fi demon a website demon uh you name it but listen God made us for this hour if he made us for this hour he will equip us to what we need listen we're not going to fall apart if you're an astronaut astronaut you will not fall apart because why you you've trusted NASA I trust my NASA the one that's built my ship to get me out of here I trust it when I get in it sister Alicia they said hit this button I hit that button they said don't touch that button oh I think I'll do it anyway no don't touch that button you touch that button after you've already launched what are you saying by the way we're astronauts we have been equipped listen astronauts they trained for years you know how they train with weightlessness in a swimming pool they put all that gear on with an oxygen mask and it replicates them being in space with no you know no gravity until I have to go down in the water to be able to walk on the moon well if I don't walk down here then I'll go walk up there right come on somebody if you don't walk down here if you don't get your training down here you're not gonna walk up there and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard it where the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts said come and see which was the lion which was the powerful animal and I saw him Behold a white horse and he's telling him how to Bow this is Satan riding out now this is Satan riding out during the time that I just told you about the little not from God so it wasn't they were discluded over here and they were protected no it's just like job Satan probably said you protected that church let me add them I'll make them curse you and die God said okay but don't kill him I gotta let them go through all these Church ages I gotta have my people and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and you know what Satan's Crown was Satan's Crown was the People Too Satan's Crown was not see or wrong Satan's Crown was a pope it was the Bishops and the Cardinals and the Hail Marys and all those different things that was their crown we all I mean what's the clown going to do any good you go stuff a crown on somebody's head that does no good even the king of England or the Queen of England you put a crown on her head does no good it's the power behind the crown it's just showing the authority when she's got an owner he's got it on but the whole authority of them putting it on him is because of the people behind them same way with me and you wasn't going this way but I'm heading in this direction anyway white means what light Satan is what now he's a minister of light but remember the Bible tells us that if your light be Darkness how great is that Darkness the light that the Pharisees and Sadducees wanted to project it was the darkest time the people in this age I am sorry the church not the bride the church the church is saying they have light but they're totally dark they say they're worshiping God and the Bible says the worship and Satan I'm not making this up all right amen and for us to be The Virtuous sin that's brought to Jesus Christ we can't fool with that guy out there we can't have that second husband we can't have that other husband we only gotta have one can't have a one marriage and divorce remember women you can't have another husband man we can well don't get quiet Jesus Christ was married to who the Jews he had to put her away give her a writing of divorcement because she committed adultery and then he married a gentile bride everybody with me well you start talking about marriage and divorce and people's fingernails start falling off you see this that Chevrolet he's going to talk about something but used of white garments as a sign of innocence and purity of Soul That's what Satan wants you to think he wants you to think you're pure when you're not the word conquer remember was Nico we were we've been talking about this the whole time because remember Nico Layton spirit is something that Jesus said to John on the Isle of Patmos he said I hate that thing I don't just not like it I hate it the Conqueror to carry off the victory and that's what Satan's going to do let's go let's get right here real quick Revelation 2 4. nevertheless look I have somewhat against it because thou has left that first eleven he's talking about the first church age the PowerHouse that we were talking about Satan got into it and he started what pulling it apart denominating it dividing them that's what Satan is doing with the bride trying to with the bride he's trying to divide us trying to pull us apart trying to fight against each other remember therefore from Wentz Thou Art fallen so you know where you fell from and repent and do the what first works what back over there in the church age that's why we can't Skip and you know you got this group it says 47 to 63 you don't have to listen to that only when the sales break now we're not that way and you know that that is a that is your that is your what that is your foundation that is all this built part of the building if you don't have that if you just try to go right here you you don't even know what you're doing you don't know what you're talking about that's agape love after those virtues are working in your life I will come quickly somebody asked what he said Remember the candlesticks each one seven he said I'm gonna remove your Candlestick if you don't change except thou repent but this thou has that thou hate us the Deeds of the Nicolaitans which I also hate listen God hates denominations he don't hate the people but when you get connected to that and you say that's your Doctrine then that is you a Baptists don't say well I'm not really a Baptist I'm really Methodist no I'm a Baptist that's when I asked that kid doesn't not too long ago I said hey Methodist going to heaven he's kind of looked at me because I said you're a Baptist y'all just think y'all are the only one that's got truth right why don't you go to Methodist Church well I don't believe everything they say I sure so they ain't going I said so I ain't going so the Pentecostals ain't going and he never had I really shouldn't have done that he just got out of school but uh I wanted him to think about it I wanted to think about when he spews out of his mouth I'm a Baptist in everybody else's faults but see you and I can stay I can stand here tonight and say we're the bride and everybody else is false because it's the truth they have some truth but they don't have the truth he'd have to near let him hear what the spirit said to the church or two him that overcome it every one of these are an overcoming who are you overcoming the preacher some of you probably would love to do that overcoming South right overcome yourself will I give to eat of the Tree of Life which in the midst of the paradise of God Satan starts with a false power let's read this right here real quick and I'll get to my point I may have to skip down through a little bit but I want to try to get done pretty quick now the mystery of the book are revealed when the seals are broken and when the seals completely are broken now look what he says when they're completely broke the time of redemption is over because the lamb left the intercession post to walk out to take his claim he was a mediator between that he was a mediator between that because look he has to mediate until you become godliness you ever thought about that he has to mediate for you until you get rid of your temperance praise God but he's standing there mediating for you till you get rid of these things and you have these working in your life then he comes down and seals that thing he was a mediator between that but when the real Revelation happens on the seals as they begin to break the lamb is coming forth from the sanctuary where that's us that's us he's coming forth from the sanctuary that says Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary pure and holy tried and true with Thanksgiving I'll be a living What sanctuary so he's coming forth from where the Lamb's not coming forth from out there he's not coming forth from this church building he's not coming forth from this oh it's done now just the words Living Bible Satan can play with this all he wants to he does anyway father son Holy Ghost is what this Bible says hell's Eternal is what this Bible says we can sprinkle is what this Bible says you know what they're preaching now in their pulpep that ain't nothing to do with God but the bride preaches the truth because that then is the power not the book you the sanctuary you read it last night in other words Revelations 5. out of the Mist and took the book now who is the book you're the book so he has no more so he's no more mediator because even they called him a lion and that's the king he's not a mediator then remember when you're sealed off I'm not talking about coming to adoption I'm talking about when we come back in a glorified body there's no we don't have to pray we don't have to go to church some of y'all really like that but if you don't come to church now you ain't gonna be a part of that church either come on somebody remember what I just read doing being obedient is better than sacrifice listen one more time I know it's a it is a sacrifice to come to church you have to really fight demons to get here y'all don't look over with your wife she ain't no like that don't do that kids Little Devils it's all their fault no it's yours you're the parent but it is a fight get back to this we talk about the actors we were talking about this the other day and some of you is looking a little strange but it's an actor because see in our intellectual mind we go and say well now brother Brown said that's what Pharisee meant Pharisee means actor I saw he's talking about here because this is one man playing the part of several people Jesus Christ God almighty is playing he's not three people he's playing the part of the three manifestations but it's the same guy moving It's Not actors as in a whole room full of actors no this one guy's playing all the parts so that actor's okay although the actors of these seals begins at the first church age now remember so you'll get the background of it thoroughly or thoroughly as possible the actors I'll place it like that because an actor is a man who changes his mask and in this act tonight we're going to see that Satan changing his mask now why is he changing his because Christ changed his he moved over in the first church age in a white righteous Church Satan takes a mask shows it to John John thinks man this is pretty cool he's riding a white horse he's conquering he's got a crown on his head it must be oh no it's the devil it's the devil Christ acting departed he did when he became from a spirit to man he only put on an actor's garment what human flesh and came down in the form of the man in order to be a kinsman redeemer you and I listen when you're born again you become you're the bride then you have to put on a new mask to go off that statue a perfect man right right it's an extra anointing but you got to put that mask on to be in the stature of Jesus Christ you can just be a Christian and and and like brother Brown said malnourished fight your way all the time but yeah you're bride but why not let's get let's be the powerhouse let's move over here and put this mask on that is the mask that what imitates that and not be an imitation be him made manifest because you know what it's not you changing the math just caught that it's not you changing the mask it's God saying hey come over here I want you to play this part come over here I want you to play this part hey come over here you're my bride I want you to play this part amen because where's our kinsman redeemer it's inside of you as sea life comes from the body you are better be careful you have the Kinsmen Redeemer you have to give it out so you become a part of that kinsman redeemer oh get quiet with me if you want to but if you've got Jesus Christ inside of you the only Jesus Christ the people going to see is who through you you aren't we Jesus Christ May manifest in another form called The Bride well that kinsman redeemer part is inside of you that's the reason they all are in Parables or symbols the way are they hear like beast beast beasts and these actors begin in the first church age so they begin down here in the first church age as I was just saying trying to look he said there's a great mess up comes along what they didn't follow the script the script is the Bible it was laid out in the first church Aid they had the full word of God the prophet said but what did they do they let another actor they let another person come in and say I'm the Pope I'm God in human flesh no he was the devil in human flesh and you know what you and I were until we were born again we were the devil in human flesh so why can't we be God in human flesh when we get to New Birth what's so strange about that Christ reveals itself to the seven Church ages to those Church ages there's a great mess up comes along then at the end of the church age right here where we're at the seventh Angel's message is to pick up those lost Mysteries and give it what give it to the church not keep it give it to me and you but not then revealed in their true State what back then it is now revealed and it's true condition look brother Brown said there's a mystery that goes with that writer and we know who that is so guess what there's not a mystery anymore we know he's a white he wants to be a white righteous church we know he wants to get on a white horse we know he wants to imitate God we know where he's at hey man all right let's read this real quick and we'll and we'll close who can find a virtuous woman for her prices far above rubies like I said before this is Solomon talking about his mom his mother that went through a king taking her and violating her and getting her pregnant and then having her husband killed you don't think she didn't know that yeah she knew that so she knew though that she had to accept she was fixing to go live with a murderer that murdered her own husband that's why I'm telling you folks you never see in the Bible where God condemned Bathsheba he sent that Prophet to David he didn't send that Prophet to Bathsheba he didn't call her a and a prostitute he called David a murderer and a liar and he also called him a thief remember the story stole that one lamb David said bring him here we'll kill him well I'll take him apart myself Nathan said you're the guy David and all I'm sure David just flushed even being a mighty king you know what being a king if he was of the wrong breed brother John he just said kill that Prophet bring me another one that man's lying no he knew he was caught he knew he did that and he knew he couldn't cover it up no more and then God Nathan said David I prayed for you Thou Art the man but I prayed for you thank God we had a prophet pray for us in the end time he prayed that we make it just like Jesus prayed in John 17 that we make it in this world watching Proverbs 12 verse 4 says a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband now look I'm not talking about a virtuous woman you because let me tell you something um this morning I was reading some quotes a little bit on marriage and divorce but brother Ralph said now sisters if you dress wrong oh I'm sorry I said marriage and divorce sorry about that you say that and everybody goes let's open up a little bit brother Brown said Sisters You Can Be Lily white to your husband you can claim your virginity on the night of your wedding he said but if you put yourself out in front of a man and he's lusted after you he said you have committed adultery already with that person wow wow so listen folks I'm telling you without the grace of God we're all dead without the grace of God there's nobody could preach there's nobody could teach there's nobody could be a deacon only a few one or two I thank God for Grace thank God that brother Brown stood one day and said don't do that no more if you ever do it again said man I said you're right in other words you're out from under this Grace don't make it greasy Grace don't make a greasy Grace folks I'm telling you don't make it greasy Grace brother Brian said you get one shot as long as you don't do it no more you're good why because we needed it every Church what Paul had one didn't he Moses had one didn't he Jesus called a woman well he didn't but they called her into acts of adultery according to the Torah she was to be stoned and killed right there but what Jesus do same thing with Rahab he just killed all her accusers he said first one of you has no sin cast the first stone well he got rid of them and he said lady were your accusers they've already left well he said I don't accuse you because I didn't see it happen right that's one of the reasons this quote that you're The Virtuous sin with pride of Jesus Christ because Jesus didn't see do that he heard your voice of repentance and he knew your heart think about David David was a man now listen nobody in the Bible nobody in the Bible God ever stood up and said this is a man after my own heart a murderer a liar a thief an adulterer and that would be premeditated murder because he wanted him dead it wasn't just an accident but God said that's a man after my own heart he saw the heart of David he didn't see the left part of David he didn't see the humanity part of David he saw that David cried out if you'll notice in the Bible he lays out on the stones and cries and prays for days when that kid gets ready to die he had a repentant heart and God forgave him and made it so clear that now he promised David this adulterer this liar this murder this put your name in there he's going to have a name over in the Millennium called the son of David he thought so much to David he's carrying that lineage on over to the son of David which will be Jesus Christ and David's going to be going thank you God for Grace Proverbs 12 let's see a virtuous woman is a crown a crown a virtuous woman now the bride is a crown to her husband Jesus Christ but she didn't make it the same as rottenness in his bones so we look at the ones that we looked at the other day Rahab she was not a virgin she married an Israeli General they had Boaz Boaz was a mighty man you know what he didn't I don't believe he turned around and said my mom was just an old no he loves his mama she got trapped in it come on people I'm dropped by us we got trapped in this but remember I promise you want to say when Rahab married the Israeli General she didn't go horn again she became a virtuous woman she asked number one she asked salmon she said forgive me he said I'll take you because I feel that there's something there between us I'll take you ohaz was born type of Christ a type of a Kinsmen Redeemer then you know what Boaz made Roots she wasn't a virgin either we'll get to talk about this in marriage and divorce maybe later on but look Ruth was not a virgin she had had a previous husband but according to the law he died so she can marry again but she wasn't a virgin so she marries Boaz Boaz says Thou Art a virtuous woman the whole city knows you're right here root 3 verse 11. now my daughter fear not I will do to thee all that thou requires for all the city my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman there's a whole city where you live know that you're a virtuous person let me ask that question one more time does the whole city your neighbors your friends do they know you're different or do you act different out there than you do here so Ruth mayor's Boaz and they have Obed oh bad how's Jesse and Jesse has David and then David has a couple of wives hmm David David has another wife her name is Abigail everybody in just a second we'll have a little history here her name was Abigail she was married to neighbor which was his name was a fool right his name was the his neighbors right the neighbor he was a fool he died so she married David hmm I hope you think about that a little bit we were married to a fool one time his name was the devil but when God killed him we married the right one we married our David the real David the real David that what took Bathsheba and at one time he lusted after at one time and and the story even goes more about Bathsheba a little bit deeper if you want to understand she was and this is what the story we look at the story and we go well now she knew the the palace was right here up above and and David you know David the king he has his little Entourage and they may blow this you know David's out on his porch looking around and and she's down there going no according to Jewish tradition again Bathsheba had just finished her period and according to the law you're supposed to wash she was not up there lusting after David she was not up there trying to make herself naked she was trying to keep herself clean anybody got anything since out of this she's trying to keep make herself clean according to the to the to the Torah according to the Old Testament she wasn't up there washing herself to you know flashing David she probably wasn't paying the attention because she just went through her seven days and she had to go through a washing of purification before she could because remember when David finds her like that he sees her and he tells the guy go get her well she gets pregnant right after everybody understand what I'm saying so it kind of makes sense it's not in the Bible but I don't think about she but nowhere in the Bible Bathsheba is called a prostitute nowhere in the Bible it says God has has cursed Bathsheba he's cursing David David's one that's got the problem all right so Bathsheba then has to learn to love David you yeah right right right right that's learning to love Jesus Christ she learned to love the man that had her first wife her first husband killed and God cursed that first baby because of that Union because of David not because of Bathsheba but she had to overcome all that scars everybody with me today she had to overcome her scars and her disappointments she had to overcome that King that murdered her husband and that cursed her first child she overcome that and learned to love the Lord Jesus now we know David but you know you David was the Rascal but we're talking about the devil here we were trapped into this just like she was trapped into that there's no way she could get out of it if you just if you told the king no you could be killed so she was just taken in and David did what he wanted to with her but remember he learned to love her too because God spoke to David said you're gonna have a son and he's going to sit on your throne because remember David had a whole bunch of sons he said Solomon from this Union there's no Town brother about how many how many virtuous beautiful virgins that he married before that he picks this one to bring Solomon why because he picked me and you to bring Jesus Christ through our stupidity through all thy wrongs for all thy whoredoms do all my things that we did wrong he wants to bring the bride through this right here Lord man listen this will get ready musicians come on a virtuous woman cares for her family she's a hard worker while she toils Faithfully in meeting the needs of her own family she also doesn't forget to help the other needy people God brings across her path now I'm not talking about a woman I'm talking about the bride all right don't like me and you a virtuous woman also takes the time to look after her own health and be a good Steward of her body we are the body of Christ so our virtuous woman meaning applies to the heart and then to every area area of life the bottom line is a virtuous woman goes into strength well we talk about virtue the strength of the Lord and Faithfully completes whatever task that's a capital H so that's Jesus Christ he has for her to do when a person is described as having virtue it is seen as a quality that sets one apart from everyone else in character hello come on strength and morality it is a common characteristic that can be found within the mindsets of several women in the Bible from Ruth to Esther you got to remember one thing do you all know that Esther was not a virgin either one night with a king she spent the night with the king before she married him before he married her good people read your Bible Ruth to Esther to Mary as well as described of others through countless verses come on I want you to read I'm going to read this quote right here and this is this will hit us right between us let's stand our feet brother random he said I'm waiting three or four minutes let me get something short here maybe I can't give over completely to Jesus have I an evil spirit the question questions and answers let me just spend the rest of time on that there you can't surrender to Jesus question mark they don't see I don't know if it's a man or a woman I couldn't tell which it is God knows you can't surrender to Jesus why what's the matter if you are a woman don't you have to surrender surrender to your husband to be a wife surrender all you are listen to this a little lady when you were married virtuous fought all your life us this is us we're fighting to stay that yes a little lady when you're married virtuous fought all your life to stay virtuous but one day you found a man you found a man that you loved you were his completely the thing that you'd fought for Against All Your Life and tried to live clean and clear now Your Surrender every bit of that to him is that right you put yourself completely in his hands are you seeing what he's talking about you have to fight to live a virgin life but once you find the right husband come on somebody once you find the right husband you give every bit of that you give every to him you lay it all on his arms you lay it all on his shoulders you say Lord Jesus I'm Yours I'm no other man's now everything I've saved up I'm giving to you I've saved my body for all these years now I'm fixing to give it to you all that you stood for in decency and moral everything like that now you turn over to a man because you surrender yourself to that man can't you do the same thing to Jesus Christ surrender yourself that way all that I am all my mind all my thoughts certainly this is a great fight we're in but one day when you get born again you take every bit of that and you give it to him you give everything you have and you give it to the Lord Jesus you turn over him to one man not many one and then brother Brown could tell us that we are the virtuous sinless you're her first husband that you were married to the world the anointed bridegroom which foreign you has watched you by the washing the Water by the word in other words real quick you're standing completely Justified as though you never did it to begin with this is my message to the church as we go off the air you're standing if you're standing on God's word and with God's word every amen every God every Tittle where are you standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from them shocks and get out here in the weep where you can get right before the sun I hear the coming of the combine you're standing complete Justified like you never did it in the first place talk about Thanksgiving I feel real good you are the pure virtuous now wait a minute brother white you just said do we give all of our virtue to him yeah we do but he's the one that's going to say you're have you have kept yourself for me and now I say you are The Virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman is born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned at the first place you are perfect by the blood of Jesus Christ let's sing a song you see when things that's worshiping for a moment [Music] I would not be denied I would not be denied tell Jesus came and made me home I would not be denied [Music] stood upon his word oh I might be denied I would not be denied tell Jesus came and made me whole I would not be denied oh Satan said they ever tell you that ah you're worthless God's nowhere to hear you he don't care about you he won't let you go through these things if he really caring about you no you're going through those things about your character I would not be denied oh I would not be denied tell Jesus came and made me whole I would not be denied amen you love the Lord he's good to us isn't he this is truly a time for us to unwrap some gifts some gifts of the Spirit we can unwrap all the gifts we want to and get toys and guns and knives and shouldn't have said guns food pulpep they might be listening to them I think we're a terrorist or something but we get all these gifts but let's have some let's open some gifts of the Spirit some wisdom some Faith some knowledge maybe sometimes an interpretation that'd be all right with me some prophecy it lays inside of you folks it lays inside of every one of us the Bible tells us to exercise your gift just like you exercise your muscles and you exercise that fork up to your mouth come on we ought to exercise the gifts that's in the Bible well that was for another day no I thought that day was this day well what if it see there you go what if it don't happen what if that nod what if are we going to keep doubting lay hands on the seat that shall recover that's what the Bible said you don't have to shake them pull them you don't even tell them you're praying for them [Music] you know what brother Brown said the best the greatest thing you can say to somebody what is it God bless you God bless you now we we say that sometimes in repetition but we really I believe the bride really means it because when I say God bless you Sister Anna I want God to bless her I want literally God to come down and bless you for whatever you need and even some of the things you probably don't even ask for he'll give it to you he's a good god brother Brown said don't ask for little things he said ask for the big things so I'm gonna ask for gifts to break out in the church I'm going to ask for us to grow up this statue of perfect man get better in God oh and you know what we have New Year's resolutions coming up right let's have some New Year's revelation because of Revelation you're not two months later forget about the yeah come on somebody you've never done that have you never met oh okay we make New Year's resolutions I'm gonna quit eating maybe for two or three weeks till that bacon comes off the grill [Music] come on now I'm not gonna eat ice cream that's kind of liking people for Lent then people that give up lent well I give up lent all the time I'm not eating hummus ever so that's easy for me to give up during Lent hey man well now that's not what Lynn's about really it's about giving up something you like uh in other words to fast and pray I'm not trying to make a joke out of it but that's what we do as human beings we saw it's easy for us to not like something we don't like but what about trying to live this when we don't want to have Godly Temperance come on somebody we're human when we don't want to have so much godliness uh and brotherly kindness to love somebody that really hates you I mean really hates you and you love them anyway that's what we're coming to folks this year we're coming to that we're going up that statue of perfect man you better get on the ladder because here we go we're heading up starting with virtue be a virtuous person but have some power a virtuous person does have power amen and that's what it wants to have you have a Merry Christmas God bless you pray for brother Daniel as they're traveling and he'll be speaking for you Wednesday night regular service and
