[18:42] Matthew and just we sto off of verse 23
[18:46] there t tonight and I want to I I wanted
[18:49] to go on but I want to we've been on
[18:54] what is a
[18:55] marriage and and I I want it to basic
[18:58] basically be on a weekend that we can
[19:00] cover uh like what is a
[19:04] divorce and uh who can divorce and what
[19:08] can take place and you know in God in
[19:10] the word and in the The Prophet's
[19:12] message you know we want to get it all
[19:14] in there together and then that way we
[19:16] can be settled in what we believe and
[19:19] and don't have any troubles you know and
[19:21] irregardless of who it hurts you know uh
[19:25] right a lot of things that hurt is the
[19:28] things that really helps after a while
[19:30] you know it it feels good later on right
[19:34] so we need to know that and we need we
[19:36] will'll try to Pi up Sunday and then
[19:38] we'll just go on from there and then
[19:40] when we finish up whatever we take of
[19:43] the uh what is a divorce and things
[19:45] we're basically saying now what is a
[19:47] marriage right and uh but then we will
[19:50] get down to what is a divorce and see
[19:54] what it really is you know in in the
[19:56] point of what we're trying to make but
[19:58] but I want you to pay special close
[19:59] attention tonight because this is what's
[20:01] on my heart all right uh brother Brandon
[20:04] will say a lot of
[20:05] things and and in saying them you know
[20:10] you you
[20:11] uh you wonder you know should he said it
[20:15] this way or should he said it that way
[20:17] or you know should the Bible had said
[20:19] this or should it had said that you know
[20:21] uh you know you wonder well then you
[20:24] come and find out that uh it was the
[20:26] only way it could be said right to be
[20:28] correct right you know now we'll get to
[20:30] it after a while where brother brand
[20:32] said eve committed adultery right now
[20:36] that's right well now how could she
[20:37] commit adultery before she had ever as
[20:39] the world thinks married to Adam or or
[20:42] connected in any way or any form so
[20:44] we've been dealing with those things you
[20:47] know and we'll see that the prophet knew
[20:49] exactly what he was talking about okay
[20:52] so let's go to Matthew
[20:54] 1:18 now the birth of Jesus Christ was
[20:56] on this wise when his mother mared Mary
[20:58] was spouse to Joseph before they came
[21:00] together she was found with child of the
[21:02] Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being
[21:05] a just man and not willing to make a
[21:07] public example was minded to put her
[21:09] away privately now notice she was a
[21:11] spouse they were engaged all right while
[21:14] he thought on these things behold the
[21:16] angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a
[21:18] dream saying Joseph thy son of David
[21:21] fear not to take unto thee marry thy
[21:23] wife we quote that yeah you know we we
[21:25] really want that part to be late in
[21:28] but we don't look at verse 19 it said
[21:30] then Joseph her husband
[21:33] right we don't look at it that a lot of
[21:36] times we just dwell on uh Mary thy wife
[21:39] or that which is conceived in her of the
[21:41] Holy Ghost and she shall bring forth a
[21:43] son and thou shalt call his name Jesus
[21:44] for he shall save his people from their
[21:46] sins now all this was done that it might
[21:48] be fulfilled uh which was spoken of the
[21:51] Lord by the prophet said behold a virgin
[21:54] shall be with child and shall bring
[21:56] forth a son and they shall call his name
[21:59] Emmanuel which being interpreted is God
[22:01] With Us Now go to Second
[22:05] Corinthians Paul saying the 11th chapter
[22:08] verse 2 for I am jealous over you with
[22:12] Godly jealousy for I have espoused y you
[22:17] to one husband that I may present you as
[22:19] a Chase virgin to Christ now if I get
[22:22] time if I don't I hope you'll understand
[22:25] if you want them I've got them brother
[22:27] bandam said I'm jealous of you right
[22:29] I've espoused you to Christ right you
[22:32] know right see we're we're already
[22:34] espoused to Christ that's not only were
[22:36] we're espoused by Paul as to be the
[22:39] bride of Christ and thing but it's
[22:41] personal in this age that brother Brown
[22:43] said I've espoused you and I I'm I have
[22:45] a Godly jealousy about you he said
[22:47] that's why we stay with the word you
[22:49] know okay go ahead to to Ephesians 1 now
[22:52] if I have time we'll get to this in whom
[22:55] ye also trusted after yet you heard the
[22:57] word of Tru truth the gospel of your
[22:59] salvation in whom also after you believe
[23:01] you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of
[23:03] Promise watch which is the
[23:05] earnest of our inheritance till the till
[23:08] the Redemption of the purchase
[23:10] possession until the praise of his glory
[23:12] now that word
[23:14] earnest if I have time to get to the end
[23:16] of if it don't then you tie it together
[23:18] in the message that word earnest we only
[23:21] use it as like part
[23:23] payment right we talk about it as a part
[23:26] payment but the definition really and if
[23:29] I get time I'll get to it and give it to
[23:30] you but the definition of the word
[23:33] earnest is actually part payment but it
[23:36] means pledge right see when you go in
[23:39] you make a down payment on something you
[23:41] are pledging to pay the rest of it right
[23:46] so then we'll try to get it tied
[23:47] together and all that okay you may be
[23:49] seated the Lord had his Blessing to the
[23:51] reading of the word
[23:54] now may God be with each and every one
[23:56] of us amen you know all right
[24:00] now we have learned so far and been
[24:03] tying together all of the things to
[24:06] where that we could stay with
[24:09] the the Bible and the prophet's
[24:13] message and trying to learn what these
[24:16] words mean and we found that the word
[24:20] espoused Y is engaged engaged is betro
[24:25] you know all of those are the same words
[24:27] we used it gave it through the Bible
[24:29] showing how they were used in the Bible
[24:32] terminologies and and what they were
[24:34] doing now I've given these so much
[24:36] brother Joe's putting them on the
[24:38] Internet so that anybody else can can
[24:41] read them off but you know we look at
[24:44] things and we say well now um I believe
[24:47] because I've been taught okay that's
[24:49] what we've done we've been taught right
[24:51] and that's why the misinterpreted
[24:53] Theology and the problems with marriage
[24:55] and divorce that's right is because
[24:57] we've been Tau Tau a slanted view of the
[25:01] Bible and the Bible says exactly what it
[25:05] means it's all that's what I'm telling
[25:07] you right there it says
[25:09] it but what does it say
[25:15] Amen we we then we take our human
[25:19] interpretation and we translate that as
[25:22] to meaning what we think it should have
[25:25] said yeah right that's why you come up
[25:28] with misinterpreted theology but see we
[25:31] don't look at it as being that when we
[25:34] would consider that you're
[25:39] engaged see that when you're
[25:42] engaged all right but around said as far
[25:45] as God is concerned mention invisible
[25:48] unit of the bride of Christ paragraph
[25:51] 86 he was minded to put her away proudly
[25:54] see after he'd already engaged to her
[25:59] when you're engaged to her as far as God
[26:01] is concerned you're married to her
[26:04] that's
[26:05] right that's why I've cautioned you and
[26:07] I have ever since I've been Pastor here
[26:10] and we've spoke on this many many
[26:13] different times over the years you know
[26:15] like every four or five years or
[26:16] something I'll do a series on marriage
[26:19] and divorce because new people coming in
[26:22] and all and some have been here from
[26:23] back of the original ones when we would
[26:25] speak on it and you know you so you say
[26:28] well brother Dale you're right back
[26:30] where you was okay but maybe somebody
[26:32] else needs to hear it and maybe we need
[26:34] to think about it ourselves all right
[26:37] and so now to me the Bible and the
[26:40] prophet's message is saying that if
[26:42] you're engaged the word engaged is only
[26:44] used one time and there the Old
[26:46] Testament scripture that's using the
[26:48] word engaged it's basically a spouse or
[26:51] betro right all right that's the basic
[26:54] words that you will find in the the
[26:56] doing but now now
[26:58] listen brother Brown questions and
[27:00] answers 1964 8:30 the morning service
[27:04] and listen what he
[27:06] says I stood here because my own son
[27:09] sitting here that was promised to a girl
[27:11] and I said if if he never even had the
[27:15] ceremony that's what most people think a
[27:18] wedding a ceremony they don't think an
[27:23] engagement you know they don't say well
[27:25] well an
[27:26] engagement you
[27:29] it it they don't count that a wedding
[27:31] but the prophet did and the Bible does
[27:33] all right now we're going to see then
[27:35] why that it will say that Eve brother
[27:37] will say Eve committed adultery right
[27:40] right because she did amen see all right
[27:44] now so follow what he
[27:47] say and if he never even had he talking
[27:50] about bilip Pa now right the ceremony
[27:53] said over him no matter if he' ever live
[27:55] with a woman or slept with her don't
[27:57] matter where he slept with her live with
[27:59] her where he had the
[28:01] ceremony the girl or whatever it was
[28:04] when he made that v he's married he said
[28:06] Billy Paul or no Billy Paul said that's
[28:09] exactly right he's married when he made
[28:11] that
[28:12] promise now when a boy asks you to marry
[28:15] him and you
[28:18] accept you're
[28:21] engaged and as far as God is
[28:25] concerned you're married right amen now
[28:29] we've got the quotes in here we read
[28:31] about them we gave them there where he
[28:32] was talking about you know the in
[28:35] questions and answers
[28:37] 1964 uh 8:30 that was paragraph 165 this
[28:40] is paragraph
[28:42] 154 he said here's where you're really
[28:44] married you're married when you vow one
[28:47] to the other when you promise one
[28:49] another that you're that you'll take one
[28:51] another the justice of peace could give
[28:53] you a give you license that's legal
[28:56] terms of living together as husband and
[28:58] wife without being common law husband
[29:00] and wife but when you promise that girl
[29:02] and this you promise that man that
[29:04] you'll live true to him and you take him
[29:06] to be your husband you're married then y
[29:09] see engaged right all right we went
[29:12] through in Deuteronomy cuz a lot of
[29:14] people want to use that there in
[29:17] Deuteronomy you know of of the point of
[29:20] the the father being able to disallow
[29:23] The Vow we went through that the Bible
[29:25] said in the day right he Hearth it in
[29:28] other words immediately right amen upon
[29:31] hearing it he must go do it then right
[29:34] it may be a while but he must go do what
[29:36] he's doing right then see it's not
[29:38] people go along 6 months later make
[29:40] wedding plans and then come up and say
[29:43] well the daddy just allowed to the wed
[29:46] you said well that's talking about
[29:47] somebody that I know well truth is truth
[29:51] amen that's right whether it be you me
[29:53] or who it is amen I just read brother
[29:55] around said well Billy Paul right well
[29:58] he didn't have no problems telling the
[30:00] truth about it that's right but see an
[30:02] engagement is when a person asks you to
[30:04] marry
[30:05] them and you accept now if you don't
[30:08] accept that's not a weding that's
[30:11] right see so be careful what you do
[30:15] girls you young girls coming up keep
[30:17] this in your mind right don't make no
[30:20] vows that you don't intend to keep right
[30:23] and I like what Wade's been through on
[30:25] the series there of doing in the things
[30:27] like yet so what you need to do is you
[30:29] need to go back to your parents and say
[30:30] something to them about it right well
[30:32] they're old fol and they won't
[30:34] understand that's exactly right they're
[30:36] old fogy and they'll tell you like it is
[30:39] amen but you don't want it and you're
[30:41] going to pay for it right you're going
[30:43] to make your own bed hard and you're
[30:45] going to sleep in it if you have
[30:47] listened to old fogy grandma grandpa Mom
[30:50] and Daddy it might have been a whole lot
[30:51] different amen but you ain't going to
[30:54] listen and the one sitting here won't
[30:56] listen right
[30:57] he said brother Dale you're sure heart
[30:59] I'm exactly right you're not going to
[31:01] listen it's going to take God to deal in
[31:03] your heart to make you listen you and I
[31:05] didn't listen and the other won't listen
[31:07] that's right right well you're saying my
[31:08] daughter won't listen yeah you better
[31:12] hold on y you got a road to hold and you
[31:16] better tell them every day y hey don't
[31:19] do that yep don't do
[31:22] that don't make your vows cuz if you
[31:25] make your vows if a boy makes about you
[31:27] and you make about about you're you're
[31:29] done that's right
[31:30] Amen brother Brown said and I gave you
[31:33] the quote there the other day he said at
[31:34] least from now
[31:36] on he said you're married aren cuz
[31:40] you're married by your
[31:41] vows not when you vow the altar uhuh
[31:46] it's when you ask the girl and she
[31:47] accepts right amen now we're going to
[31:49] get into the spiritual with this in a
[31:51] minute and we're going to tryy to see
[31:53] because this is what keeps bearing on my
[31:54] mind I want us to see what really is is
[31:57] wrong with us and why organized religion
[32:00] is so wrong right
[32:05] amen I mean you know we don't have any
[32:07] problems with anybody out
[32:09] there but the system of the whole thing
[32:12] that's right you know not the people
[32:15] right the system of the whole thing is
[32:17] where the problem is at cuz that's
[32:19] what's taught them wrong that's what
[32:21] taught you and I wrong that's why we
[32:23] went out and done the things we done
[32:25] that's right but we're supposed to be in
[32:26] the day of trying to get things straight
[32:28] now I made a statement the other day and
[32:29] I better clarify it real good I
[32:32] guess and I I've made this statement so
[32:34] if not a new one somebody on the
[32:36] internet listening or not hearing before
[32:38] they wouldn't know it but there people
[32:39] sitting here know that I've always
[32:41] taught you one
[32:43] thing about these things you know I've
[32:48] always said it and I believe it I
[32:50] believe the grace of marriage and
[32:52] divorce had to come in the end time Amen
[32:55] to be able to set a people free amen so
[32:58] that there could be a change in a moment
[33:00] in a twinkl an ey everybody understand
[33:02] I'm snapping my fingers change change
[33:04] change amen I'm not talking about
[33:06] whether you're going into the Rapture by
[33:08] dying
[33:10] right right there will be people that
[33:12] are come up in the The Rapture and go
[33:14] that didn't know the truth about it that
[33:16] maybe me married four or five times sure
[33:19] cuz there no truth had been presented
[33:21] there right am all
[33:23] right but you see in this day
[33:28] so you can't take a man and four or five
[33:30] wives and type Christ right it doesn't
[33:32] work anymore right it's a man in his
[33:34] wife amen right type of Christ in the
[33:37] church amen all right now not wives

[33:43] wife singular all right brother R said
[33:46] polygamy is wrong that's in Daniel 70
[33:49] weeks all right so that's why I say that

[34:02] keep telling you about the brother
[34:03] preach that time that that you New Birth
[34:05] took care of of everything well if it
[34:08] did why brother R have to preach
[34:09] marriage and divorce what was the
[34:12] purpose he wouldn't have had to preached
[34:15] it no see because he he Tak the new
[34:18] birth well well then maybe he means the
[34:20] New Birth when it's completed
[34:24] okay but the new birth can only be
[34:26] complet when the grace of marriage and
[34:28] divorce is accepted right that's it amen

[35:59] to die and go by the grave I'm not de
[36:02] christianizing anybody I said they will
[36:05] die and go by the grave because they
[36:06] can't stand here to make the change amen
[36:09] amen that's right and you may not have a
[36:11] marital problem that will cause that but
[36:13] there's one thing about it we got a
[36:14] marital problem it's got to be
[36:16] straightened up here amen there's not a
[36:17] straightening up in heaven when we get

[36:41] understand but I believe it anyway amen
[36:44] all right but you following me now so
[36:47] then an
[36:50] engagement we not to take unto thee
[36:52] marry thy
[36:53] wife now they were in spoused MH they
[36:57] had not lived together they had not went
[36:59] down and performed ceremonial vows in
[37:02] front of the
[37:04] public but they were as
[37:06] spoused right and you know what they
[37:08] would have done they would have killed
[37:10] her
[37:11] right sure had Joseph not taken her
[37:15] place amen right thank you Lord amen you
[37:19] agree with that amen amen if he hadn't
[37:22] taken her place they would have killed
[37:24] her if Adam had taken ease place right
[37:29] God would have destroyed her
[37:31] right right amen now we know it didn't
[37:37] happen
[37:39] so we know God has all of this already
[37:43] figured out
[37:45] amen he knows what's going to take place
[37:48] amen and he knows how to hand thing amen
[37:52] yes sir he knew his brother BR said what
[37:54] in the world am I going to do said I got
[37:56] people sitting here men women married
[37:58] three or four times right he said what
[38:01] can I
[38:04] do now if you'll study the message get
[38:06] in the seals I mean get in the questions
[38:08] and answers in 64 1 2 3 4 they four four
[38:12] books on it and get in there you'll find
[38:14] him saying you go on as you are because
[38:18] PL times have been you know things have
[38:19] been made all right before he knew some
[38:23] things but he could not come out and say
[38:25] it because would have been only a
[38:27] presumptuous point oh I got a
[38:33] revelation but when he come forth with a
[38:35] revelation have you ever heard a man
[38:39] talk and there's one thing in that
[38:41] marriage and divorce is always bothered
[38:44] me my brother Brandon would come forth
[38:47] and say a question in God's word right I
[38:51] know I know the answer of sure man
[38:55] questioned it not God
[38:57] right right but he didn't emphasize it
[38:59] that
[39:02] way and where can you find Moses his
[39:04] grace in the Old Testament right I've
[39:07] asked you to read invisible Union and
[39:09] and marriage and divorce until where we
[39:11] get into the word
[39:13] divorce because you see the word divorce
[39:15] is exactly reverse of the word marriage
[39:18] right I've emphasized that over and over
[39:20] right you make your vows that means
[39:22] you're married when you're divorced
[39:24] you're breaking your vows you sign
[39:26] pledge to break Break The Vow that you
[39:28] made y that's right you're not signing
[39:31] the pledge to to break the paperwork
[39:33] that the preacher done filled out and
[39:34] the licenses and and the the what was
[39:37] done recording down at the courthouse
[39:39] right you're taking away your pledge
[39:43] right that's a divorce
[39:47] y right let's be serious about it
[39:50] brother we have seen his star to come to
[39:53] worship he's talking about the word
[39:55] espousal and he said in the in the East
[39:59] it's the same as marriage is it's the
[40:01] same as
[40:02] betral they were spouse they were
[40:05] married and when that sacred vow between
[40:08] them was taken Deuteronomy
[40:10] 22:23 and you'll find out that when this
[40:13] woman and man agreed to be married yet
[40:15] they did not take the vows for months
[40:18] and you know what he saying they didn't
[40:19] go before and do
[40:21] the if they ever broke that vow they
[40:23] were guilty of adultery that's right
[40:26] they were espoused y they were just the
[40:28] same as marriage am the law only that
[40:31] gives you a right to live together to be
[40:33] not common law husband and wife right
[40:37] all right now I hope this coming down to
[40:39] enough to where that we can comprehend
[40:42] an
[40:43] engagement and have moved away from our
[40:46] thoughts of what an engagement really is
[40:49] or an spouse or you know and find out
[40:52] about a
[40:55] marriage and found out what it means
[40:59] to make those
[41:04] vows but don't make them
[41:07] children that's right until you know
[41:09] that's the right one amen which means a
[41:11] lot of praying a lot of soul searching
[41:14] boys don't make the
[41:16] vows Right girls don't accept the vows
[41:20] no
[41:21] sir right you're in this day when the
[41:24] girls want to make the vows well that's
[41:26] not of a headship form but just don't
[41:28] get tied up in all that amen you stay
[41:31] away from it you got plenty of life I
[41:34] know I've got in trouble by being this
[41:36] way I know it but I didn't know it we
[41:38] were talking to this people one night
[41:40] and and I had bluntly stated that I
[41:43] didn't believe in the girls or to be
[41:45] married at 16 and four kids by
[41:49] 20 I just made it plain cuz that's the
[41:52] way I talk nobody can't you say well
[41:54] brother de what you mean anybody need
[41:56] that interpret it I don't believe in
[41:58] getting married at 16 and you say well
[42:00] what about you and Nanny okay my wife
[42:04] was 16 and I was 18 but we was
[42:11] grown we proved it we've been together
[42:13] 53 years this coming August
[42:17] 7th and a great family that serves the
[42:21] Lord all right what you
[42:25] see you know they wind up yes it's four
[42:29] 54 okay better get right be 54 we used
[42:32] arget you say 52 I say 53 so now I've
[42:35] got behind a year all right but anyhow
[42:39] listen when you make a vow to somebody
[42:42] you keep that V that's
[42:45] right you because that's that's that's
[42:49] your V by your words you be justified
[42:51] and by your words you be condemned
[42:53] that's right amen this is not just play
[42:55] parties and just oh well it don't matter
[42:57] what I
[42:59] say
[43:03] well it does to God
[43:05] Amen it does to God right amen and he's
[43:10] the one we're having to deal with right
[43:11] not what some preacher says or what
[43:13] their thoughts are right but now
[43:15] listen what about it can you tie
[43:19] together this is the point I tried to
[43:21] make the other week and I wanted to make
[43:23] sure anchoring
[43:26] can you tie
[43:28] together the new
[43:30] birth with your marriage and divorce
[43:33] that's
[43:34] right amen can you tie together the
[43:38] Bible of and why organized religion is
[43:41] like it
[43:45] is and why is it that the world is in an
[43:49] adulterous
[43:51] form that's right you know what you got
[43:55] millions and millions and millions
[43:59] of what we call Christian
[44:03] converts in the world
[44:06] today but why would a prophet talk about
[44:08] a little bride chosen out of day right
[44:11] amen
[44:13] right out of all the world full of
[44:15] religious people that are wonderful
[44:17] people sure marvelous
[44:20] people work theirself to death
[44:24] y but yet a proph would call them go to
[44:27] Invisible Union and read it over and
[44:29] over and over
[44:31] right can you tie that together to
[44:35] see that's what I'm trying to do with
[44:38] the word engagement see
[44:40] because when a man ask a woman to marry
[44:43] him and she accepts they're married
[44:46] that's right all right now God come unto
[44:49] me all you labor and heavy laden and
[44:50] I'll give you rest am did not God offer
[44:53] salvation to the world yes you
[44:57] agree right now even though he knew that
[45:00] they would not receive it and not
[45:02] fulfill it and come forth and be a bride
[45:05] etc etc right we know that but yet he
[45:08] still offered it amen and what makes
[45:12] organized religion so
[45:17] wrong and come on let's get on right
[45:19] down where we're at it don't matter you
[45:20] say Methodist Baptist Presbyterian BR
[45:22] right amen I don't mind saying words
[45:24] like that
[45:26] right because the people of this message
[45:28] are more denominated yes than the
[45:30] organized religions are I don't mind
[45:33] saying that I'm I'm sorry I have
[45:37] to but it's the
[45:40] truth all right what makes people
[45:43] married to what makes it to where that
[45:46] God one day will destroy
[45:51] them is because they made a a vow when
[45:54] he when he made a vow he he asked
[45:58] y he put forth his
[46:02] pledge he went forth to offer
[46:06] salvation now watch what I'm getting at
[46:08] so you have to be real careful so you
[46:10] can say well now when they accepted him
[46:13] when he when he asked them and they
[46:15] accepted him did that make a marriage
[46:17] that made them
[46:19] married and that made him married to his
[46:22] vow
[46:24] right
[46:26] but like Eve it we get to in a minute
[46:28] what happened to
[46:36] her you see why in the Bible that it
[46:38] says it be in the last days that that
[46:40] the women will say you know
[46:43] uh seven women to one man's coattail
[46:47] right said let us take thy name see
[46:50] because they want to be religious sure
[46:54] amen they want to be
[46:56] churchy but what makes it wrong of where
[47:00] they're
[47:03] at because they're pregnated by the
[47:06] devil's lie right amen just as we'll
[47:09] read in a minute is what he done
[47:16] y she become pregnated by the devil's
[47:19] lie right right then she become
[47:21] pregnated by the Beast as far as the
[47:23] natural
[47:24] Act
[47:28] see if God makes a if he sends you an
[47:32] invitation and you accept that
[47:37] invitation and then you don't fulfill
[47:39] you part of it you know you don't keep
[47:41] your vow that's it you go off and live
[47:45] with somebody else what are
[47:46] you that's what I'm trying to get at
[47:48] you're engaged to a boy boy ask you you
[47:51] accept and then you go off and marry
[47:53] somebody else what are you yep
[47:59] you're an adulterous that's
[48:01] right you're a whn
[48:04] y that's what the Bible calls it right
[48:08] you more the Revelation 17 why is
[48:11] she a
[48:13] why doesn't God just say I don't
[48:15] need fol none of it no because he
[48:19] offered and they
[48:22] accepted all right we'll read in a
[48:25] minute where brother randam said that's
[48:27] what
[48:29] happened Jehovah
[48:32] divorced the Old
[48:35] Testament
[48:40] right if he divorced her he'll never
[48:42] take her back his wife that's
[48:43] Deuteronomy 24 cuz there some
[48:45] uncleanness caused it to happen he can't
[48:47] come back and take her Deuteronomy 24
[48:49] read your Bible we went through it maybe
[48:52] not
[48:54] enough but but enough that you to
[48:59] understand you know that run around and
[49:01] said Christ
[49:02] bride went whing after man's ideas read
[49:06] invisible Union right these are not my
[49:09] words you say well how could Christ
[49:11] bride do it you ask the prophet he's the
[49:14] one that's saying the
[49:15] things but then you find out and come to
[49:18] find out what it is is really a so-call
[49:20] bride right why because they made their
[49:24] vows and accepted him but before the
[49:26] wedding ceremony could come they're done
[49:28] found pregnated by the devil right right
[49:33] right organized religion pregnated to
[49:36] people with the denominational
[49:39] isms
[49:41] right and they're an
[49:45] adulterous and an adulterous according
[49:47] to the Bible her husband is the first
[49:50] one to cast the
[49:52] stone you say you are you trying to say
[49:54] that God is mared right come on listen
[49:57] get it right in your
[50:00] mind he offered it yeah they accepted it
[50:04] then they went wrong right it's not that
[50:08] he went wrong he's right there to keep
[50:09] his vows amen that's right he's even
[50:12] there to bless them heal them deliver
[50:14] them right
[50:17] amen but what the problem is that
[50:20] they're married to him and then they
[50:21] went married the world that's
[50:24] right
[50:26] brother Mo back in about 1971 preached a
[50:29] series messages and I really enjoyed it
[50:32] it still bears in my
[50:33] heart are you married to Adam or are you
[50:37] married to
[50:39] Christ you know there is no divorce for
[50:42] a woman in the Bible
[50:43] n no what no grounds no
[50:48] nothing
[50:53] amen see the husband got to be dead
[50:56] y amen it's the only grounds a woman has
[51:00] for remarriage is her husband to be
[51:03] dead the brother R them in the marriage
[51:05] and divorce and it's not said to
[51:07] him but it's said to
[51:11] her right but now it ain't said to him
[51:14] like everybody wants to say
[51:16] it right even when the Pharisees we're
[51:19] going to get on to that when we get into
[51:21] the part of those Pharisees come to
[51:22] Jesus tempting him they said Moses gave
[51:26] us a right of divorcement to put our
[51:28] wives away for any
[51:36] cause so he didn't come out there and
[51:38] tell him wait just a minute no that's
[51:39] what brother dick and
[51:41] brother Ray and I were talking this
[51:45] afternoon you ever notice brother
[51:46] brandham when they asked him a question
[51:48] go to questions and
[51:50] answers and they ask him a direct
[51:53] question about something and he spends
[51:55] 30 minutes talking about it and he
[51:57] doesn't plainly tell you in plain blunt
[52:01] words black and white as we call it what
[52:04] the answer is he gives you the
[52:07] scriptures and the things that are
[52:09] related to it which should be the right
[52:13] answer but don't understand what I'm
[52:17] saying they asked him said brother
[52:19] Brandon said should women wear pajamas
[52:22] to bed and he just kind of giggled and
[52:24] ped It Off
[52:34] right it wasn't that he didn't want to
[52:36] answer it it's probably just too silly
[52:38] for
[52:39] him well do matter what women we up in
[52:45] bed oh but boy bless God yes I've been
[52:48] through it with heard it over and
[52:53] over the women wearing Brites
[52:57] you ain't never been through the long
[52:58] lines of these things and sometimes it
[53:00] gets PL vulgar to even talk about it but
[53:02] you know some of the preachers used to
[53:03] preach that women wasn't supposed to
[53:05] wear panty hoose because they had a
[53:07] crouch in
[53:09] them that's
[53:12] pling but that's the way people's
[53:14] done until people don't know what in the
[53:17] world truth
[53:22] is but you see somebody's trying to
[53:24] stand with the truth amen that's who I
[53:26] want to line up with amen all right get
[53:29] back on what we're talking
[53:33] about so let's just talk about this part
[53:36] of what makes
[53:37] a what makes a
[53:40] person what do you mean brother Dale cuz
[53:43] you go out and talk to organized
[53:44] religion people and you'll hear this
[53:46] right I accepted him as my savior Y and
[53:50] what else can I
[53:53] do huh
[53:56] well you accepted
[53:58] him what did you do different than what
[54:00] I
[54:01] done I he gave me the invitation and I
[54:04] accepted the
[54:07] invitation is't that what you
[54:12] done you remember the Baptist man had
[54:15] come to brother around him and said what
[54:16] else could the man do said Abraham
[54:17] believ
[54:20] God and it was imputed unto him for
[54:22] righteousness he said that's exactly
[54:24] right but he said God done something to
[54:28] Abraham amen that he gave him the sign
[54:30] of circumcision amen join he accepted
[54:34] his
[54:36] faith but do you understand what I'm
[54:39] saying when God offers the world
[54:44] salvation and then they say I accept it
[54:47] that makes them married to Jesus
[54:50] Christ come
[54:53] on you see yeah is he mad to them well
[54:56] it must be because he going to put them
[54:58] away in divorcement right and that's
[55:00] what he's got to do that's right and
[55:02] that's what he's
[55:05] done why because he accepts our
[55:08] words yeah but I just don't see how God
[55:10] could be married to a denomination he's
[55:13] not married to a denomination right he's
[55:15] married to individual people amen right
[55:19] brother ROM don't get it no where will
[55:21] you find brother R talking about God
[55:22] being married to an organized religion
[55:24] not going to get it a don't need even
[55:26] searching for
[55:27] it but he's married to individuals right
[55:31] who has accepted him as their savior but
[55:35] then they go off and live with another
[55:38] husband what is he going to do
[55:43] right divorce
[55:46] her because she broke her V let's see if
[55:49] we can just go through some of this
[55:50] thing and see all right go ahead brother
[55:53] Anderson pull up I told him we'd skip up
[55:55] 1 2 3 4 and we'll go up to number five
[55:58] look what the prophet had to say let me
[56:00] keep
[56:02] mind let me get my notes CAU up
[56:09] okay now watch what he said the end time
[56:11] sign seed 62 319 E12 that's what the
[56:15] bride has done with the
[56:18] world I want
[56:20] you why would he call him
[56:23] bride right but then why would he so
[56:27] emphasize that there's a little bride to
[56:29] come out of there right amen then why
[56:31] would he so emphasize on the seal book
[56:34] when he says I call you
[56:36] bride why because she'd been
[56:40] espoused some records had started being
[56:43] made clear about that time things was
[56:46] being cleared up yeah
[56:50] watch that's what the bride has done
[56:52] with the world United with the world
[56:53] with their Creeds and things and denied
[56:55] the word of God saying days of Miracles
[56:57] is p there's no such thing as the
[56:59] baptism of the Holy Spirit see you said
[57:02] well there's nobody in the message that
[57:04] says
[57:06] that I know I get in trouble when I do
[57:08] things so okay I'll get in trouble uh
[57:11] days of Miracles at pip one brother said
[57:12] the third pull is only far brother Bram
[57:16] and the Lord
[57:18] Jesus so that means the days of Miracles
[57:20] is
[57:22] p okay all right
[57:26] there's no such thing as a baptism of
[57:28] the Holy Spirit there's a big Doctrine
[57:29] in this message that you don't have the
[57:32] baptism of the Holy Spirit I just got
[57:33] through those doctrines and things
[57:37] right those heresies right amen so bring
[57:42] it on up to where we at
[57:45] okay bring the message up to where we
[57:49] at see we look back our say oh that was
[57:52] their
[57:53] problem
[57:55] well what's our
[57:57] problem look at
[57:59] it and where is she at
[58:03] now he say she's divorced
[58:08] y okay y now if they wouldn't married he
[58:11] wouldn't divorce
[58:12] her that's right so they were engaged
[58:16] they hadn't come to the wedding yet
[58:19] right right right but there
[58:22] engaged if you're getting what I'm
[58:24] saying they made their own vows and that
[58:26] vow are
[58:29] pledge is what made them married right
[58:33] why you can call him an
[58:35] adulterous look what he said just just
[58:38] Jesus's bride had done the same thing
[58:41] that Jehovah's bride did the same thing
[58:43] that that Adam's bride did you see yes
[58:47] just exactly the Bible said it the mouth
[58:49] of three Witnesses let every word be
[58:52] established there's three churches three
[58:54] Brides all of them done the same thing
[58:57] right all right going to the next
[59:01] one the sign of his coming
[59:05] 62407 paragraph E 101 remember Adam's
[59:10] bride was found with false seed that's
[59:13] exactly right now he didn't have no
[59:16] problem calling Adams Eve Adam's bride
[59:19] right yep he didn't say Eve was engaged
[59:23] no that's right right
[59:25] bride all right Adam's bride was found
[59:28] with false seed that's exactly right
[59:30] Jehovah's bride was found the same way
[59:32] right he divorced her and put her away
[59:35] is that right that was God Christ bride
[59:39] is that was God Christ bride is the same
[59:42] thing she's found with worldly
[59:44] organizational seed in her and not the
[59:47] gospel having a form of godliness but
[59:50] denyed the power thereof from the holy
[59:52] spirit in the world now what's it
[59:54] there's a sign of the last days God will
[59:56] divorce her and take his bride as
[59:59] concern certain as anything in here as
[1:00:02] it was in the days of no he's going to
[1:00:04] divorce all of this stuff out here and
[1:00:05] then he's going to take his real bride
[1:00:07] right is that what he's saying
[1:00:09] amen he's going he's talking about a
[1:00:12] bride a divorcer then he talk about's
[1:00:14] going to take his bride all right see
[1:00:17] that way you're not confused with the
[1:00:18] Bible right go on to the next
[1:00:23] one
[1:00:25] let's see what
[1:00:28] happened this
[1:00:30] is marriage and divorce 1965 221 the
[1:00:33] morning service paragraph 256 through
[1:00:36] 257 notice he can put her away but she
[1:00:40] cannot put him away right he did it has
[1:00:43] proved it in the days when Luther Wesley
[1:00:47] and
[1:00:48] Pentecost don't now where are they
[1:00:51] at
[1:00:52] right they're already divorced course
[1:00:55] right what's their
[1:00:57] problem they was married to
[1:01:00] him left went to another husband now
[1:01:04] they're an adulterous right right right
[1:01:07] so look what God's done with her look
[1:01:09] what he said
[1:01:12] happen now he can put her away but she
[1:01:14] cannot put him away he did it has proved
[1:01:17] it in the days when Luther Wesley and
[1:01:19] Pentecost when they refused to become
[1:01:21] the further part of him by having
[1:01:24] spiritual sexual fire to become
[1:01:26] pregnated with a f further part of the
[1:01:28] word you understand she refused the
[1:01:31] Lutheran Church refused Christ to have
[1:01:33] any more Desire with
[1:01:34] her you plain as your Prophet could say
[1:01:37] it Luther refused it now you not talking
[1:01:39] about Luther right right come on right
[1:01:43] you would have just read it now right
[1:01:45] said Luther no Luther was the bride
[1:01:48] right who he talking
[1:01:50] about the
[1:01:53] Lutheran he ain't talking about Wesley
[1:01:56] up here he ain't talking about those
[1:01:58] that were true Pentecost
[1:02:01] right come on read the message oh you're
[1:02:04] interpreted and we say just what he
[1:02:08] said he must a
[1:02:11] hypocrite look the Lutheran Church right
[1:02:15] y refused for Christ to have any more
[1:02:17] desire of her Luther refused it let me
[1:02:20] say this want to call me something
[1:02:21] anyhow so is it today with every one of
[1:02:24] the
[1:02:24] they fail to take that word they refuse
[1:02:28] Christ any woman that refuses a man his
[1:02:32] child now back up here he's talking
[1:02:36] about they refuse to have spiritual
[1:02:39] sexual a fire to become pregnated with
[1:02:42] the word now he's talking about down
[1:02:45] here
[1:02:48] what they're refusing a
[1:02:50] child right right come on and any woman
[1:02:54] that refuses a man his child has no
[1:02:57] right to be a wife to him amen you
[1:02:59] remember in the Bible when the King
[1:03:01] married Esther watch because the queen
[1:03:05] refused he just got him another one and
[1:03:09] when the what happened when she refused
[1:03:12] to come out with the King and Obey him
[1:03:15] the same thing it is when a woman that
[1:03:17] refuses to be wife to her husband
[1:03:20] amen
[1:03:23] now
[1:03:26] plain language is timeing
[1:03:30] together what's timeing together an
[1:03:33] engagement makes you
[1:03:39] married makes your husband and
[1:03:42] wife it don't complete this transaction
[1:03:46] it only Begins the
[1:03:48] transaction and you must go
[1:03:52] on all right
[1:03:55] and that's why Peter would
[1:03:58] say that the new birth Y is just the
[1:04:01] earnest of your inheritance
[1:04:04] right until the Redemption of the
[1:04:06] purchased
[1:04:07] possession all right so the new birth
[1:04:10] comes
[1:04:14] in and Abraham the seed that was made
[1:04:18] alive and when does the new birth
[1:04:21] begin when does it actually begin
[1:04:25] it begins when you accept Jesus Christ
[1:04:27] as your savior right amen but it's not
[1:04:31] complete until he gives you the baptism
[1:04:33] of the Holy Ghost right right that's
[1:04:35] right all right but now in
[1:04:39] engagement it's already finished
[1:04:41] irregardless of whether you ever have
[1:04:43] anything else to
[1:04:44] do right that's what I'm trying to tie
[1:04:48] together and Earnest a
[1:04:53] pledge listen Church we're in a
[1:04:56] dangerous situation whether you believe
[1:04:57] it or not that's right we come to Lula
[1:05:00] and we claim Lula's got the word and you
[1:05:02] never said it that way other of you
[1:05:05] have I've always just tried to preach a
[1:05:07] word right
[1:05:10] amen but where do we stand compared with
[1:05:12] all the rest of the message
[1:05:16] people but you see church we could be
[1:05:18] just as filthy in adulterous as anything
[1:05:21] else because if we take any of our ideas
[1:05:24] is contrary to God's word we're an
[1:05:25] adulterous
[1:05:27] right that's why it's so serious to
[1:05:29] stand here and preach the gospel that's
[1:05:35] right if I deny one word what am
[1:05:39] I right I'm a bastard born illegitimate
[1:05:43] child read spoken words Original Seed
[1:05:45] and see if he's right I got them L on
[1:05:47] the dment it didn't bring them because I
[1:05:49] knew I wouldn't have time to even cover
[1:05:51] what I want to on
[1:05:52] this look think about
[1:05:58] it look what he says on invisible Union
[1:06:02] paragraph
[1:06:04] 153 down through
[1:06:08] 157 now he shows us what the new birth
[1:06:11] is
[1:06:12] doing because the new birth is that you
[1:06:14] died to the old husband if the old
[1:06:17] husband ain't dead we remember an
[1:06:18] indivisible Union we'll get back to it
[1:06:20] later when we using the word it's not
[1:06:22] divorce him and hang him up no that's
[1:06:25] right see a lot of people as brother Mo
[1:06:27] said got their coat and hat left
[1:06:29] organized religion and come into this
[1:06:31] message
[1:06:32] y same old coat and hat that they wore
[1:06:35] when they was in organized religion same
[1:06:37] old Doctrine right you see them in the
[1:06:39] message all the time

[1:06:49] Ghost is that one of them back in there
[1:06:51] about somewhere just before you come

[1:14:05] it's hurt down where we're at
[1:14:07] right and paragraph
[1:14:09] 175 invisible Union how can a preacher
[1:14:13] goes out here to a seminary and looks at
[1:14:16] acts 238 and see that there's not a
[1:14:18] person in the Bible ever baptized in
[1:14:20] these those titles and then still says
[1:14:22] he's pregnant ated with the word of God
[1:14:25] telling you a lie he sold his Birthright
[1:14:27] he's committed adultery against the very
[1:14:30] thing that he said he is put away in
[1:14:33] divorce
[1:14:36] Y come on
[1:14:40] preachers that's right deny the word
[1:14:44] we're put away in divorce
[1:14:48] right come on because we made our vows
[1:14:52] right
[1:14:53] okay look at the next
[1:14:55] one questions and
[1:15:03] answers
[1:15:05] um don't wrong on the Top
[1:15:07] Line 6 28e okay we missing something at
[1:15:11] the top it U because
[1:15:14] it's 628 e okay these numbers is not
[1:15:18] comparing up here on the top cuz that's
[1:15:20] not 6
[1:15:21] 6559 see that
[1:15:23] you know okay we get on this on it's the
[1:15:26] paragraph
[1:15:28] anyway he said we got one more now now
[1:15:32] listen I want to ask you a simple
[1:15:37] question and hope you'll see what I've
[1:15:39] been trying to talk about married to
[1:15:40] organize religion or whether we've been
[1:15:43] married two or three times or whether
[1:15:46] we've been engaged two or three
[1:15:50] times you see they argued with brother
[1:15:52] brandom and they said
[1:15:59] fornication and
[1:16:04] adultery brother Brown said the words
[1:16:06] the
[1:16:08] same that's what I want to do approve
[1:16:10] for the next 15 20
[1:16:13] minutes CU even the garden as I said
[1:16:16] when we
[1:16:17] started her and Adam had not come
[1:16:19] together as husband and wife physically
[1:16:22] right
[1:16:25] why would he have not called her
[1:16:32] fornication are you
[1:16:34] thinking why does not the Bible and the
[1:16:37] prophet called her
[1:16:39] fornication called her
[1:16:45] adultery so you're going to have to
[1:16:47] change the Bible because Jesus said if a
[1:16:48] man looks on a woman un lust in his
[1:16:50] heart he ha committed fornication with
[1:16:52] her already
[1:16:54] now did I misread quote that right what
[1:16:57] does the Bible
[1:16:59] say a man looks on a woman to lust in
[1:17:02] his heart he's committed adultery right
[1:17:05] why is he saying those things why is the
[1:17:07] Bible saying why is the prophet called
[1:17:10] Eve committing
[1:17:14] adultery because she's
[1:17:17] engaged I hope that'll tie to you one of
[1:17:20] these days you'll understand when Eve
[1:17:22] was in gave to Adam you said well they
[1:17:24] didn't have no no they didn't but she
[1:17:25] was betr right well well no wait just a
[1:17:29] minute now he didn't say will you take
[1:17:31] and he said no no they didn't have to
[1:17:33] cuz there was only two of them right
[1:17:35] they wasn't a whole group standing
[1:17:36] around try to bicker over who's going to
[1:17:38] do
[1:17:40] what you said well can you put it with
[1:17:42] betral they pledged yeah because when
[1:17:46] she came out what did Adam
[1:17:51] say come on
[1:17:54] what did Adam say she's bone of my bone
[1:17:56] and Flesh of My
[1:18:00] Flesh they were engaged as spous betroth
[1:18:04] right
[1:18:05] right and she committed
[1:18:09] adultery no no no fornication she
[1:18:15] committed see that's where you're
[1:18:17] holding to the point of thinking
[1:18:19] fornication is somebody before marriage
[1:18:21] and adulter is after and that's fine CU
[1:18:24] that's the definition that's
[1:18:26] right but get the real definition
[1:18:30] right we went through there in in
[1:18:36] numbers that if a man find a girl
[1:18:40] betrothed and he rape her in other words
[1:18:43] lie with her they killed
[1:18:45] him if she didn't cry out to kill both
[1:18:48] of them why because she was
[1:18:51] betr right
[1:18:53] but then we covered the scriptures on
[1:18:55] down a little further that covered
[1:18:58] that if she was not betr or
[1:19:03] spous and he lay with
[1:19:06] her he could go make a deal with her
[1:19:09] daddy in B we done been through
[1:19:14] that
[1:19:16] right why because she was not a man's
[1:19:19] wife but if she was betr she was a man's
[1:19:22] wife
[1:19:24] Eve was Adam's wife whatever you want to
[1:19:27] think about it took to consummate that
[1:19:29] or finish it up if you want to think it
[1:19:32] was sex that made them married well you
[1:19:34] better believe in a hurry she committed
[1:19:36] adultery cu the Beast beat Adam
[1:19:39] D so come on she's married to the Beast
[1:19:42] then if you're going to make it marriage
[1:19:43] like
[1:19:44] that better think right
[1:19:48] amen all
[1:19:50] right but now listen to your prophet
[1:19:52] claim fornication and adultery but just
[1:19:54] think about what he's already said then
[1:19:56] we'll get to some more
[1:20:00] y they said brother Brandon what's the
[1:20:02] difference between fornication and
[1:20:04] adultery he says 1959 628 the evening
[1:20:08] service paragraph
[1:20:11] 185 what is the difference between
[1:20:13] fornication and adultery Matthew
[1:20:16] 199 CU it's used in Matthew 19:9 it's
[1:20:19] used fornication and adultery is using
[1:20:20] the same scripture you know on we'll get
[1:20:23] to that later Jesus said in Matthew 199
[1:20:26] whosoever put away his wife and marries
[1:20:28] another except it be for the cause of
[1:20:29] fornication commit adultery we'll get to
[1:20:32] those later I'm not trying to deal with
[1:20:33] that I'm trying to deal with the other
[1:20:34] point the difference between fornication
[1:20:37] and adultery the word could be applied
[1:20:39] either way so to make it clear what he
[1:20:41] was talking of there and a woman that's
[1:20:44] unmarried cannot commit
[1:20:48] adultery
[1:20:49] okay
[1:20:51] that's what 100%
[1:20:54] correct
[1:20:58] y y right but if she's engaged she's
[1:21:03] married that's right that's 100% correct
[1:21:07] now can you put the two together amen
[1:21:10] come
[1:21:11] on the word could be apply either
[1:21:14] way but to make it clear what he was
[1:21:16] talking about there a woman that's
[1:21:18] unmarried cannot commit adultery why
[1:21:21] because she's a young girl she's not
[1:21:22] guilty of doing it she's she's not
[1:21:24] married she's not
[1:21:27] engaged come on right if she's not
[1:21:31] engaged then the man that if she
[1:21:34] volunteered for him then it's
[1:21:36] fornication
[1:21:40] right did you understand the way I said
[1:21:43] it isue
[1:21:45] volunteers right it's fornication other
[1:21:48] words a girl that never had sex and
[1:21:50] never promised nobody to married and a
[1:21:51] and a man come comes along the first
[1:21:53] thing is
[1:21:56] fornication why because she doesn't have
[1:21:58] a husband
[1:22:00] right but he had
[1:22:02] one that's right so did
[1:22:06] Jehovah the Old Testament people had a
[1:22:09] husband so did the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:22:11] have a husband I'm trying to get that to
[1:22:14] tie together to you so
[1:22:16] look because she has no husband to
[1:22:19] commit adultery against it's unclean for
[1:22:23] her she has to confess that to her
[1:22:26] husband before they are married and she
[1:22:29] did she's did that if not and her
[1:22:32] husband finds it out later he has a
[1:22:34] right to put her away because she took a
[1:22:36] false Vow where the Bible says
[1:22:41] rituals all right for the Bible says it
[1:22:44] okay look at the so fornication is what
[1:22:48] a girl when she lives unclean that's
[1:22:50] fornication cuz she has no husband but
[1:22:53] when she's married and then when she
[1:22:56] lives like that she commits adultery
[1:22:59] against her husband so don't go with
[1:23:01] that uh Eve would be
[1:23:05] fornication I know it calls it
[1:23:07] fornication against Jehovah's bride
[1:23:09] right but she was committed adultery
[1:23:12] because she was married to Jehovah don't
[1:23:14] call it fornication to the bride of
[1:23:17] Christ call it
[1:23:20] adultery amen why because they was
[1:23:23] married
[1:23:26] right that's why he puts him
[1:23:29] away all right now let's just prove that
[1:23:31] let's go to to marriage and divorce 19
[1:23:35] be me to it now
[1:23:38] listen what's what
[1:23:40] he we know that it was
[1:23:42] Eve the Apple that she was supposed to
[1:23:45] eat where it's not even scriptural now
[1:23:48] they claim it it was an apricot it was
[1:23:50] neither one she committed
[1:23:54] adultery
[1:23:57] y now if you're anchoring down on what
[1:23:59] I'm saying you're understanding they
[1:24:01] were engaged married so she committed
[1:24:06] adultery had she not been engaged had
[1:24:08] she not been
[1:24:11] betro pledged to
[1:24:13] Adam it would have been fornication
[1:24:18] right come on but it's adultery because
[1:24:21] the wet came so it with the church come
[1:24:23] on she committed adultery that brought
[1:24:26] forth the first child that was Cain
[1:24:29] Satan own son or in him lay evil he did
[1:24:32] not come through Abel Satan's son was
[1:24:34] Cain okay go to the next one which is
[1:24:37] the invisible Union 1965 11:25 paragraph
[1:24:43] 229 how did you come to do this we were
[1:24:45] deceived into it by your first marriage
[1:24:48] to your adulterous
[1:24:51] parent
[1:24:55] oh
[1:24:57] now I want you to read this one real
[1:25:02] good and then you'll see that there is
[1:25:06] no good
[1:25:07] lineages right you know in this message
[1:25:10] see there's a Doctrine if you happen to
[1:25:12] be born from Adam you can be saved but
[1:25:15] if you come from the Beast you can't be
[1:25:18] saved now I'd like to see that in the
[1:25:20] prophet's message
[1:25:24] right come on you on the internet send
[1:25:25] it to me I'd like to see that right read
[1:25:28] what he says Y how did you come to this
[1:25:31] you were deceived into it by your first
[1:25:33] marriage to your adulterous parent
[1:25:37] Eve what it's no fault of your own by
[1:25:42] your natural birth you come after Eve
[1:25:45] who committed adultery
[1:25:48] y that's the reason you were born in
[1:25:51] adulteress
[1:25:55] yep come on y we were born in adulterous
[1:25:59] you're a siner to begin with that's
[1:26:01] right you were deceived into
[1:26:06] it see that's why we need to be born
[1:26:09] again
[1:26:10] amen and to be born again go back to
[1:26:12] Invisible Union and read it over and
[1:26:14] over to be born again the old husband
[1:26:16] got to be dead not divorced and put up
[1:26:19] in a corner right
[1:26:23] not take your coat and hat run into the
[1:26:24] message until I got the Holy Ghost
[1:26:27] that's right that's what most of the
[1:26:29] people
[1:26:31] claim well where's the husband
[1:26:34] died
[1:26:37] right you see why most people don't have
[1:26:39] the new birth right cuz their old
[1:26:42] husband's still alive that's right their
[1:26:44] old doctrines their old
[1:26:47] ideas yeah but brother de wouldn't marry
[1:26:49] back her let's get the last one
[1:26:53] let's see what the prophet had to
[1:26:55] say 74 invisible Union bride of Jesus
[1:26:59] Christ marriage is the oldest Institute
[1:27:02] in the
[1:27:03] world marriage was first was performed
[1:27:07] first and
[1:27:08] instituted in the Garden of
[1:27:13] Eden right that's not after the Beast
[1:27:16] got there
[1:27:19] no right that was why Eve is called an
[1:27:24] adulteress that's why you and I are
[1:27:26] called an
[1:27:29] adulteress that's why we've got to be
[1:27:31] born again amen that's
[1:27:37] right you see even though we're born
[1:27:40] again we only have the engagement
[1:27:45] situation I gave you the quote from the
[1:27:48] prophet so you can give a quote where
[1:27:51] brother R say we're married to him right
[1:27:52] now we are right exactly what I proved
[1:27:57] Eve was married to Adam
[1:28:01] sure
[1:28:04] right when you accept Jesus Christ as
[1:28:07] your savior and he gives you the baptism
[1:28:08] of the Holy Ghost you're married to him
[1:28:10] amen that's
[1:28:12] right
[1:28:17] right and then to take any man's ideas
[1:28:19] besides what he tells us we're
[1:28:21] adulterous that's right that's why the
[1:28:24] marriage and divorce situation is like
[1:28:26] it is Christian people trying to
[1:28:29] interpret the word of God
[1:28:31] right most of the time to fit their own
[1:28:35] Goods if you've ever heard and read the
[1:28:38] story of any of it to where it come down
[1:28:39] to the King James
[1:28:43] version I saw a movie one time where
[1:28:45] that they was depicting King James as
[1:28:48] and even the man said on it he says and
[1:28:50] that's what my brother said he' done I
[1:28:52] differ totally I mean not alltogether
[1:28:54] but King James was trying to get a Bible
[1:28:56] that would okay him to get married or
[1:28:58] been
[1:29:00] married I don't give a who that's what
[1:29:02] he wanted it
[1:29:03] for he brought us the word right that's
[1:29:07] right I don't care if it come from the
[1:29:08] Latin vate they brought us the word
[1:29:11] right
[1:29:14] amen my brother
[1:29:16] says King James wanted to set it up
[1:29:19] where he could divorce or already
[1:29:20] divorced or where it'd be okay whatever
[1:29:22] it was that's the stories that goes with
[1:29:24] the King James version but what do I
[1:29:27] care we got the word of God Amen right
[1:29:32] even though it come right through the
[1:29:33] adulterous
[1:29:34] hands come right down into us right we
[1:29:39] have God's word
[1:29:42] amen but the new birth is only the
[1:29:44] earnest right right
[1:29:47] amen the new birth is only the
[1:29:50] earnest The
[1:29:52] Pledge engagement the prophet said we're
[1:29:55] going to get married at the wedding
[1:29:56] supper amen I gave you one I to see a
[1:29:58] book where he
[1:30:00] said all that six seals going on we
[1:30:02] going to be up PR getting
[1:30:04] married when we already married now
[1:30:06] right he was married
[1:30:11] right Joseph and Mary was
[1:30:14] married

[1:30:18] consummated that right and it had to be
[1:30:22] 9 months later because he knew are
[1:30:25] not until the child was
[1:30:29] born amen I know I'm kill you a lot of
[1:30:32] things
[1:30:33] but you
[1:30:36] know you'll take this wrong but that's
[1:30:38] all
[1:30:40] right you know that' take a pretty good
[1:30:43] man to live with a woman for 9
[1:30:48] months without having intercourse and
[1:30:50] them already married as far as the world
[1:30:52] was concerned they went on down and and
[1:30:54] done their vows they went on through
[1:30:56] with the we sure it shows that God was
[1:30:59] in
[1:31:00] control but it also showed that it can
[1:31:03] be done that's right amen it shows that
[1:31:07] God can do it through a man amen sir
[1:31:11] Joseph was a wonderful man
[1:31:15] amen you see
[1:31:18] church when are we if we're engaged

[1:31:42] married why can't I say I'm married
[1:31:44] right why can't I say that's my
[1:31:48] husband if you'll notice over in the
[1:31:50] Book of Revelations brother dick I used
[1:31:52] to talk about this a l it finally does
[1:31:54] say it doesn't say that a bride has made
[1:31:56] herself ready doesn't say that why
[1:31:59] because at that time you're going away
[1:32:01] it says the wife has made her seated she
[1:32:04] went from a point of being an
[1:32:08] Engaged right she's went to that form to
[1:32:11] write here upon this Earth before we're
[1:32:13] changed somebody's going to be the
[1:32:16] walking Living Word of almighty God
[1:32:18] that's right and he can come and Unite
[1:32:21] with it right it won't be any man's
[1:32:23] ideas of traditions or thoughts right
[1:32:26] that's why churches I warn you
[1:32:28] constantly about these
[1:32:29] doctrines well that's all right that's a
[1:32:31] good
[1:32:33] brother yes so was the
[1:32:36] devil that's
[1:32:39] right here what people will say to me
[1:32:41] but brother you want not be so
[1:32:45] hard they don't
[1:32:48] understand well why don't they ask
[1:32:54] right come on why don't they
[1:32:58] ask
[1:33:00] right I stood here since
[1:33:03] 1974 and preached Daniel 70
[1:33:09] weeks never been invited but to one
[1:33:11] place to preach
[1:33:16] it then who wants to know about Daniel
[1:33:20] 78
[1:33:22] I didn't write the book your Prophet
[1:33:25] says in there if you don't understand
[1:33:26] Daniel 70 week you can't understand the
[1:33:28] seals I didn't write the book he
[1:33:32] did yet everybody knows the seals and
[1:33:34] all about them but what about Daniel 7
[1:33:38] what that's right well bless God you go
[1:33:42] down to the courthouse and you can't
[1:33:43] find where I've been married at one
[1:33:48] time how many times was he engaged right
[1:33:52] right how many girls do you ask and they
[1:33:54] accept
[1:33:58] you come
[1:34:00] on I don't like you I don't like me
[1:34:05] either no problem with that we got a
[1:34:08] 100%
[1:34:09] agreement but what does the word say
[1:34:12] that's it that's it that's
[1:34:15] right I bless God so and so righte far
[1:34:19] so and
[1:34:20] so
[1:34:23] just
[1:34:24] remember the reason organized religion
[1:34:26] is is where they're at today is because
[1:34:29] when God put the welcome out sent come
[1:34:32] out to them they accepted it and when
[1:34:34] they did they went off and lived in
[1:34:35] adultery just like Eve did amen it's
[1:34:38] like Eve that was engaged to Adam and
[1:34:41] she went and live with a beast just like
[1:34:44] Jehovah went whing after the things of
[1:34:47] the world and God right there with them
[1:34:52] just like the prophet said the bride of
[1:34:55] Christ he said that's why he didn't say
[1:34:58] down through the all the ages of the
[1:35:00] putting away he made it specific he said
[1:35:02] the Luther and the Methodist and
[1:35:08] Pentecostals refuse to become pregnated
[1:35:10] with the furtherment part of the
[1:35:13] word
[1:35:15] amen why don't we want the word
[1:35:20] folks is it condemning
[1:35:22] us
[1:35:25] right does it condemn you for somebody
[1:35:28] to tell you the
[1:35:30] truth it doesn't change a person God's
[1:35:32] the only one that can change a person it
[1:35:34] doesn't change a person in the world
[1:35:35] ain't never change nobody my wife my
[1:35:38] kids my nobody in this church has never
[1:35:40] changed anything what I said it
[1:35:43] right God has to come into your heart
[1:35:46] and show you what the truth is amen amen
[1:35:49] and that's why I Don't Preach like
[1:35:50] everybody else
[1:35:52] cuz if I did I'd beat us everyone to
[1:35:54] death dechristianize us all and empty
[1:35:57] the
[1:35:58] church but instead I keep trying and
[1:36:03] praying God let me say something that'll
[1:36:06] get to people to see it
