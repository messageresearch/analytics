[0:03] all right let's thank you wow let's get
[0:05] started
[0:07] um let's review this real quick before I
[0:10] erase it all right and then we're going
[0:14] to start on the second seal I hope we
[0:17] have uh got a little bit out of maybe
[0:20] the first seal yeah
[0:23] um I know that
[0:25] um that this mystery of iniquity is
[0:28] working we know it's in a
[0:31] man working out there but we got to
[0:33] realize it's in a man working in here
[0:36] this is where the mystery of iniquity
[0:37] that really matters is here when that
[0:40] when that man of sin see that Wicked
[0:43] one's made known in us but when that man
[0:45] of sin becomes incarnate on Earth we're
[0:47] out of here we're gone we if we see that
[0:50] we missed it okay so the literal opening
[0:54] of that seal showing the mystery of the
[0:56] man of
[0:57] iniquity uh we won't be here but we got
[1:00] to realize in a spiritual form we get
[1:02] these seals first in our Natural Body we
[1:06] must see that white horse rider riding
[1:09] away from our life all these little
[1:11] things like brother Tim was talking
[1:13] about this morning when he got
[1:16] hurt there's a few more things you have
[1:18] to deal with you don't just say out you
[1:20] might say something you don't need to
[1:21] say but guess
[1:23] what God's there one day one day just
[1:28] keep walking one one day all that'll
[1:31] just go away right okay some of them he
[1:34] took it away from us quicker some of us
[1:35] he takes it away longer that doesn't
[1:37] make you no better than me or me no
[1:39] better than you it's just like brother
[1:42] Tim said he's a work in progress and
[1:44] that's exactly what we all are we're all
[1:46] a work in progress all right but now
[1:48] there's got to come a time we can't just
[1:50] keep saying 10 years from now well I'm a
[1:52] work in progress I still got no they
[1:54] somewhere we're going to come we're
[1:55] going to see that mystery of iniquity is
[1:57] not in us
[1:58] anymore
[2:00] not that we're not going to have bad
[2:01] thoughts not that we're going to be
[2:03] totally uh what they call sinless
[2:06] Perfection but we are going to be a
[2:10] people that we
[2:13] realize we have no sin that's right we
[2:16] got to realize that okay remember what
[2:18] we talk about what God sees what God
[2:20] sees you never did Sin but now what we
[2:24] see here we sin every day but what God
[2:28] sees we never sin to start with that
[2:30] real you and when that real you comes to
[2:32] the outside and makes itself manifest
[2:34] that person didn't do it because if that
[2:37] person did do it and there's still a
[2:39] mark against you you're not born
[2:40] again all right you're lost and you're
[2:44] going to see this man of sin cuz he's
[2:45] going to chase you down and kill you
[2:48] just be honest during the during the
[2:50] tribulation period this man is going to
[2:51] have so much power brother BR said that
[2:54] foolish virgin group will be hunted down
[2:56] like dogs and killed for their stand for
[2:59] what they know you know um people that
[3:03] are Sanctified Justified and Sanctified
[3:05] but not filled with the Holy Ghost
[3:07] that's what that foolish virgin group is
[3:09] right because they're still virgins they
[3:12] took the word of God instead of man's
[3:14] ideas but they didn't go on to receive
[3:16] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's why
[3:17] brother R said the baptism of the Holy
[3:19] Ghost is the most important thing you
[3:20] can ever have in your life is that
[3:23] inside not not a knowledge of this
[3:26] Satan's got a knowledge of this right
[3:27] here he's standing here today looking
[3:30] through all your
[3:32] eyes looking at this right
[3:34] here and he said yeah know that's that
[3:37] that's that's that's what's going to
[3:39] happen but when we really have it
[3:41] manifested in our heart then that man
[3:43] can't reside here he's got to go here
[3:46] stands a lamb with a book in his hand
[3:48] there goes the white horse rider right
[3:50] here stands the Lamb with the book in
[3:51] his hand later on today and there goes
[3:53] the red horse rider all right and things
[3:56] like that but let's just go over this
[3:57] and make sure we got it first deal is
[4:01] the mystery of
[4:03] iniquity showing that there was a
[4:09] mystery of even our life even being born
[4:12] again there's a mystery of iniquity we
[4:14] do things we know we shouldn't do right
[4:18] amen we we do things we know we
[4:20] shouldn't do that's iniquity that's
[4:22] knowing not to do it and you do it
[4:23] anyway all
[4:25] right and then remember power was given
[4:28] to him by who
[4:30] the people the horse all see I'm going
[4:34] to leave these symbols but I'm going to
[4:35] race you know this part but always the
[4:37] horse is going to be a power so every
[4:39] horse regardless of what color he is is
[4:42] going to be a symbol of the people that
[4:45] he's riding on because without the
[4:47] people think about this in the
[4:49] Millennium in the
[4:52] Millennium Satan is going to be alive
[4:54] and
[4:55] well but brother Brown said he'll have
[4:57] no one to work through so he'll be
[5:04] bound there's no people to give him
[5:07] power cuz all the people in the
[5:09] millennium are the Born Again Believers
[5:11] and 144,000 so there's no one for him to
[5:14] work through so guess
[5:19] what what's the difference in now and
[5:21] then except for the glorified body
[5:24] there's no difference you're born again
[5:26] that theophany that's inside of you
[5:28] that's 20 years old
[5:30] that's what's going to walk over there
[5:31] in the Millennium walk out on the ashes
[5:33] of the wicked to rule and Reign Over the
[5:36] 144,000 is that correct so what's the
[5:39] difference we just got this body to deal
[5:41] with right now we'll have a sinless body
[5:44] then but we still got the same mind of
[5:46] Christ if you're born again you still
[5:47] got the same
[5:49] person we got to defeat him on this side
[5:53] right we can't wait actually we'll never
[5:55] get to the Millennium unless we defeat
[5:57] him on this side I like what brother F
[6:00] Fred Mullen said yesterday said
[6:02] everybody says we're waiting on God no
[6:03] God's waiting on
[6:05] us excuse me God's waiting on us to get
[6:08] this thing fulfilled all
[6:09] right and what happens we give this
[6:13] power to this horse and we let him ride
[6:15] through our
[6:16] life right most powerful scripture I
[6:19] told you last Sunday resist the devil
[6:22] and he'll flee from him that's right but
[6:25] no what we do is is we let him get on
[6:27] our horse that's right which gives him
[6:29] power to do what
[6:31] move we never let if we never let him
[6:33] get on the horse he can't move he's
[6:36] powerless Satan is powerless remember we
[6:39] read the scripture is this the man is
[6:42] this the person that made the Nations
[6:44] fall and crumble all right now remember
[6:47] he had a bow and no Arrow so that means
[6:48] he's a bluff he has no power unless the
[6:50] people give him that power all right
[6:52] then a crown was given him because
[6:54] remember when he first started out he
[6:56] was a saying a saying is not a person a
[6:59] saying was just a saying among the
[7:00] people well was Jesus God or was he a
[7:03] like substance of God or was he another
[7:05] person see that's what the old the
[7:09] everybody thinks we harp so much on this
[7:10] River Jordan Doctrine but they they've
[7:12] reverted right back to the Nan Council
[7:14] in
[7:15] 606 in this message that's where Satan
[7:17] wanted to mess us up is right here in
[7:19] the message he don't care about the
[7:20] people out in the denominational World
[7:22] he's got them already all right so he's
[7:25] wanting us and now he's got right back
[7:27] into the seat again and riding through
[7:28] the power of preachers that don't
[7:30] understand what the prophet was talking
[7:32] about because if Jesus was not God to
[7:35] the River Jordan he was a different
[7:36] substance right there was a substance
[7:38] came here and then God came into that
[7:40] substance that's two
[7:42] substances that's what they in nah 606
[7:45] they agreed man agreed that God that
[7:49] Jesus was not the substance of God but a
[7:51] light substance I say he was the
[7:53] substance of God Flesh Blood the whole
[7:55] thing was God all right so that does
[7:59] away with that see so that we see that
[8:01] riding off in our life every time we we
[8:03] get a a
[8:05] revelation I'm not talking about head
[8:07] knowledge I'm talking about a true
[8:08] Revelation and that word goes together
[8:11] like this that person right there that
[8:15] Wicked one's being made known cuz he's
[8:17] residing telling you other things but
[8:20] when you get a revelation and it's
[8:22] locked right down into your soul and and
[8:25] nobody can talk you out of it that guy
[8:27] has got to right away from you you
[8:29] because he is in opposition he cannot
[8:32] stand you to get a revelation all right
[8:35] so Crown was given him because what he
[8:37] went from a saying just like in the
[8:39] message bunch of preachers sat around
[8:41] and said well was Jesus God or was he
[8:44] not God to the River Jordan he was just
[8:46] a man and then some argued said no he
[8:48] was God like me no he was God and other
[8:50] said no well he wasn't well you know
[8:53] what opposing
[8:55] forces but one day they crowned him they
[8:59] crowned that Doctrine and a preacher got
[9:00] up in a pull pit and preached it you
[9:03] said well that's that's bad well I'm not
[9:06] worried about a denominational preacher
[9:08] if he can make me doubt what I got you
[9:12] ain't got what you got if you listen to
[9:15] a denominational preacher and he can
[9:17] teach you more than this message can
[9:18] teach you you're
[9:20] lost you're just plainly lost I mean you
[9:24] can listen to them I don't even listen
[9:26] to them cuz they don't have nothing for
[9:27] me they not born again I don't want to
[9:30] hear them they Hy the preachers in this
[9:32] message ain't born again and I don't
[9:33] like to hear them either just be real
[9:36] honest with
[9:38] you but give me one good one that takes
[9:42] care of all the bad
[9:43] ones because remember God is also riding
[9:47] his power is in his people
[9:49] also and he's not riding away we're
[9:53] riding with him right here he's riding
[9:55] through here all right then also we saw
[9:58] that Christ lamb and the Holy Ghost
[9:59] there's a real true revelation of one
[10:02] God because brother R said if you see
[10:04] one in opposition you know that's not
[10:06] God see so that's what they've done at
[10:08] the River Jordan they separated him
[10:10] divide and conquer they've done just
[10:12] like the pope divide and conquer Jesus
[10:14] wasn't God he was a separate identity
[10:15] from God no he wasn't he was
[10:18] God are the biggest liar that there ever
[10:21] was when he said I and my father are
[10:23] one not like one right right and the
[10:27] Bible says like I told you the Holy One
[10:29] of Israel there's only one all right the
[10:32] combat Beast that went forth and said
[10:34] come and see was a lion the lion of the
[10:37] tribe of Judah real bold uh Peter Paul
[10:40] all them come out in the first three
[10:41] ages Paul irenius Martin they were real
[10:45] staunch believers they believed in one
[10:48] true Living God they believed in water
[10:50] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[10:52] Christ but see when this age ended in
[10:54] 606 it started Into the Dark Ages well
[10:57] the Nan Council got so tied up in the
[11:00] Roman Catholic Doctrine and all the
[11:01] other doctrines of the world that
[11:03] everybody accepted Father Son and Holy
[11:05] Ghost everybody accepted the Trinity
[11:07] everybody accepted these doctrines all
[11:10] right so Satan he gets off of that horse
[11:13] he's already made the people white
[11:15] righteous people we got it we got a pope
[11:19] I tell we was talking the other day oh
[11:22] yesterday with a brother and that's
[11:24] exactly what we've done in the message
[11:26] if we don't watch it we've made our
[11:28] preachers our our pastors our
[11:30] Pope brother Dale you go study for us
[11:34] and tell us what God
[11:36] Said you go you go I can't get prayed
[11:39] for by nobody else with brother Dale now
[11:41] if you got confidence in brother Dale
[11:43] that's a difference but if you're
[11:45] expecting him to do all your
[11:48] work you've made him a PO cuz what do
[11:51] they do they go what does the Catholic
[11:53] people do they live like the devil
[11:54] during the week they go up there and
[11:56] they do that whatever they do and they
[11:58] the pre gives them the wafer literally
[12:01] changes they say that to the Flesh of
[12:03] Jesus Christ and they drink the
[12:05] wine they don't give you the Holy Ghost
[12:07] they they're the Holy Ghost they're your
[12:09] Holy Ghost that's a pope a pope there
[12:12] sister an she'll tell you the pope is
[12:14] your holy ghost in the Catholic Church
[12:16] you don't get it you don't read nothing
[12:18] the pope gets up and reads it all or
[12:20] don't say Pope but the priest the priest
[12:23] does it all for you let's don't let the
[12:26] people in the message be the same way
[12:28] the Bible says study to show yourself
[12:30] approved it doesn't say study not study
[12:32] and let your pastor study to show you
[12:33] approved no you got to show yourself
[12:35] approved all right cuz I guarantee it's
[12:37] a lot easier to preach to a group of
[12:38] people that is studying than to preach
[12:40] to a bunch of people that's not trust me
[12:43] I've been to both
[12:44] places but the first three
[12:47] ages Paul irenius and Martin they held
[12:50] to the true word of God all right the
[12:54] wicked one now is being made known it
[12:57] wasn't really made known back then then
[12:59] like it is now cuz a lot of people
[13:01] accept it because
[13:02] look the next age is the fourth age
[13:06] right
[13:08] Columba
[13:10] priest
[13:12] Luther Catholic priest see how the
[13:15] Catholic church had already instituted
[13:17] so many things but when we get into this
[13:19] fourth age we're going to
[13:22] see that that
[13:25] horse rode through he got off of the
[13:28] white horse got on a red horse brother R
[13:30] said the reason he got on that red horse
[13:31] was is because he physically killed 68
[13:35] million Protestants during that 4th age
[13:37] that's what we're going to get into all
[13:39] right and then he said Untold billions
[13:42] spiritually
[13:44] killed and that's the truth but this is
[13:46] your this is your basis for your first
[13:49] seal like I told you before I'm not here
[13:53] to to give you Revelation you got to get
[13:56] one yourself right right uh
[13:59] and study it listen dad preached this in
[14:02] 1983 I studied it wrote notes off of it
[14:04] several years ago and then I'm trying to
[14:06] go back to it a little bit now and you
[14:09] get a little more like brother collie
[14:10] said this morning he he's been listening
[14:12] to the series and he's got more out of
[14:14] it than he did in 1983 well that's not a
[14:16] that's not a dish on brother Dale and a
[14:19] and a crown to me no that just means
[14:21] brother collie m is getting a revelation
[14:24] the words was already spoke these words
[14:26] don't change right right but when you
[14:29] get a revelation that's
[14:31] yours and and and if if Paul was sitting
[14:35] here he'd say amen I don't care who
[14:36] wrote
[14:37] this cuz it's word it's the word of God
[14:40] to me right but God had to use somebody
[14:42] like Paul use somebody like Peter use
[14:45] somebody like Matthew Mark Luke and John
[14:47] to get the gospel out like brother Fred
[14:49] Mullen said it's it's God speaking he
[14:52] just chose to use them to do the
[14:54] speaking through all right so that's
[14:56] what happened here it doesn't matter to
[14:57] me that Paul wrote Romans or Hebrews or
[15:00] whatever those things you know that that
[15:02] Scholars back it's it's God speaking to
[15:04] me God spoke through Paul God spoke
[15:08] through brother brandom and then he
[15:10] spoke directly to me right cuz see
[15:13] people made brother random poke well all
[15:14] this happened to brother randam so we
[15:16] need to look to
[15:18] him it says in the days of the voice and
[15:22] there's only one voice of the seventh
[15:24] angel and that's the
[15:25] bride the bride is the final voice of
[15:28] the final AG under her messenger which
[15:29] was brother brandham started it
[15:33] all and brought this mystery of iniquity
[15:38] to us showing us that it wasn't just the
[15:41] white horse rider was the Antichrist but
[15:44] the white horse riders the Antichrist
[15:46] riding in your life in my life every
[15:51] single
[15:52] day all right the power was given so
[15:56] let's do one thing for sure
[16:01] let's confess this until it happens like
[16:04] brother Fred Mullen said yesterday
[16:06] really enjoyed that he said he said if
[16:08] you don't confess it God's not obligated
[16:11] to make it come to pass right and he's
[16:14] not CU he said by your words you will be
[16:19] justified but by your words you'll be
[16:22] condemned and confess with your mouth
[16:25] and believe in your
[16:26] heart and guess what God can move
[16:29] because that's what's written in the
[16:30] Bible but if you say no I can't do this
[16:32] I don't know anything and I can't do
[16:34] this then you can't you
[16:36] won't you can't bring your body under
[16:39] subjection if you don't listen to the
[16:41] inside
[16:42] teacher that inside man has got to have
[16:46] preeminence all right like this this man
[16:49] right here is going to get preeminence
[16:51] from this guy Satan is going to enter
[16:53] this Pope and and take over and he's
[16:56] going to be a a hard man to deal with
[17:02] because he's going to have Supernatural
[17:03] Powers that's what's going to make him
[17:05] strong he's going to have Supernatural
[17:06] powers and they're going to think he's
[17:08] God
[17:09] incarnate but he's not he's the devil
[17:12] incarnate because of what his
[17:14] Doctrine his Doctrine is what's going to
[17:16] tear him down signs and wonders folks we
[17:19] can have them all day long but listen to
[17:21] the message that goes with it the
[17:23] message that goes with it is right you
[17:24] listen to it the message does not go
[17:26] with it get away from it right so
[17:29] there's your first seal so now let's go
[17:30] let's read the second seal anybody have
[17:33] any questions I said was going to take
[17:34] maybe a little question and answer
[17:36] session does anybody have any questions
[17:37] on the first
[17:38] seal so the devil won have any power in
[17:42] theum is it because he's bound or he
[17:46] will have no power because he can't work
[17:47] in us how about the wicked people in the
[17:50] world do what how about the
[17:52] Sinners there won't be any sinners in
[17:54] the
[17:55] Millennium no only in the Millennium
[17:57] will be the bride and 144,000 now
[18:00] there's a group in there that I don't
[18:03] understand brother R said the Heathen
[18:05] will be preached to in the Millennium I
[18:07] don't know but I know one thing for sure
[18:09] Satan will not be able to work in me and
[18:11] you cuz Hey listen folks when we stand
[18:13] in the millenum this is after the battle
[18:15] of Armageddon there's nobody alive that
[18:17] we know of except the bride which is
[18:20] already sealed in we've already took our
[18:22] body changed we get our body changed
[18:23] right here right before the Millennium
[18:26] starts right now the 144,000 they get
[18:28] theirs later on because they get killed
[18:31] while we're at the marriage supper they
[18:32] get killed for the 3 and 1/2 years of
[18:35] the Daniel 70 weeks they get killed
[18:37] during that Ministry of the two prophets
[18:39] Moses and Elijah they get killed they go
[18:43] in a Rapture and then we all come back
[18:45] in the Millennium after because remember
[18:47] the Millennium is still in
[18:50] time that is not the fire of God to kill
[18:54] all Soul cuz God's the only one that can
[18:56] kill Soul they can't kill Soul right
[18:59] God's the only one cuz remember he said
[19:00] All Souls are mine Don't Fear the one
[19:03] that can kill the body he said fear the
[19:05] one that can kill the soul that's right
[19:06] all right so All Souls are mine see even
[19:09] during the Millennium during the
[19:11] Millennium people are going to be
[19:14] dead in The Fifth Dimension their bodies
[19:17] are going to be Ash because this is not
[19:19] going to be God's fire this will be
[19:22] man's fire just like man destroyed the
[19:25] Earth in Noah's age man is going to
[19:27] destroy brother Brown that atomic
[19:30] explosion will rock the will rock the
[19:32] whole
[19:34] world what it's doing is it's moving us
[19:36] back to the real condition because in
[19:38] Noah's age remember the Earth tilted off
[19:40] of its axis because of all the uh
[19:43] explosion that went on during that time
[19:45] but now what's happening now even with
[19:47] the earthquakes remember the earthquake
[19:48] the other day in Japan moved us back on
[19:51] our axis so many milliseconds a day well
[19:54] that don't mean nothing to to most of us
[19:56] we didn't feel it but if you're
[19:59] spiritually minded you'll know God's
[20:00] doing something he's putting it back he
[20:02] didn't knock it on off he's putting it
[20:06] back cuz when we get in the Millennium I
[20:08] believe it's going to rock right back up
[20:11] cuz Atomic explosions they're going to
[20:13] explode and it's going to kill
[20:15] everybody but see remember in the
[20:17] Millennium is not the future home in the
[20:20] Millennium we buil houses and inhabit
[20:22] them and plant Vineyards and plant
[20:23] Gardens and all the things like that
[20:25] last Sunday afternoon remember I read
[20:27] you the scripture
[20:29] Joshua went into that promised
[20:32] land and he said I give God said I give
[20:35] you houses you didn't build I give you
[20:37] venard that you didn't build I give you
[20:39] places you didn't build what that's the
[20:41] future
[20:42] home that's when God went prepared for
[20:44] us not us see when we come back here in
[20:47] the Millennium when we come back in the
[20:50] Millennium this is my
[20:52] thoughts we're just going to walk back
[20:54] on a wasteland if you ever seen these
[20:57] movies about all the
[20:59] uh after the apocalypse I believe that's
[21:01] what it's going to look like you're
[21:03] going to see still still see buildings
[21:04] standing
[21:06] up why not because remember this is
[21:10] man's fire this is the atomic
[21:13] explosion killing all the people it says
[21:17] we'll walk out on the ashes of the
[21:19] wicked now if you believe the Bible then
[21:21] you're going to walk out on the ashes of
[21:22] something there's ashes going to be on
[21:24] the ground but remember you and I are
[21:26] glorified we're already in etern we
[21:28] don't there's nothing going to harm us
[21:30] if they even if they even shot us with
[21:32] 10 nuclear bombs they would not hurt us
[21:35] because we're going to be changed right
[21:37] here same way with 144,000 soes
[21:39] everybody understand that when we get
[21:41] back here from on the mill in the
[21:42] Millennium I believe this just me I
[21:44] believe it says we'll build houses
[21:47] what's going to happen is it's going to
[21:48] be just like when Noah came off of that
[21:52] Ark everything started Greening up he
[21:54] said go and multiply and replace the
[21:56] Earth everything started Greening back
[21:57] up again
[21:59] right cuz it was still in time the
[22:02] Millennium is still in time it you got a
[22:04] man has to live a thousand years to show
[22:07] the Bible is
[22:08] correct so brother Brandon said you're
[22:11] still in time we're going to be still in
[22:12] time until the future home so we're
[22:14] still going to have day and night and
[22:15] all these things it's not going to harm
[22:17] us you think it's going to bother us to
[22:19] be there and and and um you said well
[22:22] that's a nuclear Wasteland what's it
[22:24] going to bother us we're already
[22:26] glorified bodies but I believe the
[22:29] Millennium is going to teach us a that
[22:32] this thing is coming back together
[22:35] correctly you know I'm just a human if
[22:39] God just dropped the future home down on
[22:41] us like a bombshell and we walked out in
[22:43] this beautiful place that we never had
[22:45] anything to do with it blow our
[22:48] mind but I believe that God's going to
[22:51] we're going to have a marriage supper
[22:52] God's going to bring us right back down
[22:53] into this Dimension after they blow
[22:54] everything up and you're going to see
[22:57] there's going to be cars and streets and
[22:59] but I mean it's not going to be runable
[23:00] I'm talking about it's going to be a
[23:01] wasteland it says the ashes you walk out
[23:03] on the ashes of the wicked so it's not
[23:05] going to
[23:06] be don't get me wrong but it's not going
[23:08] to be a beautiful place I just don't
[23:10] think so cuz a millennium is for a
[23:13] thousand years that somebody's going to
[23:15] live a thousand years to show that the
[23:18] sin curse is
[23:19] gone right
[23:22] because this is not the future home read
[23:25] your Bible in Isaiah it says we'll build
[23:27] houses
[23:29] and inhabit
[23:30] them how I none of my
[23:34] business I know I won't have to I'll
[23:36] just speak the thing into existence but
[23:38] you got 144,000 there maybe some other
[23:41] people that make it I don't I don't
[23:42] understand all that but the Millennium
[23:45] remember this one thing Millennium is
[23:47] still in time you it's not Eternity for
[23:49] the Earth not yet but it's going toward
[23:53] that because after we lived a thousand
[23:56] years after the thousand years is
[24:00] over the Bible tells us that Satan is
[24:03] loose for a season season I don't know
[24:05] what a season is it doesn't really
[24:06] matter remember we're in eternity he's
[24:08] not going to bother us but what it's
[24:11] doing people it's getting this Earth in
[24:13] order for us to come back on it with God
[24:17] and that future home sitting on this
[24:19] Earth everybody understand that
[24:22] Millennium is in time there is things
[24:25] that you cannot put in the scripture
[24:28] over in the future
[24:30] home there's things you put in the
[24:32] scripture for the Millennium but you can
[24:34] talk about both but now there's one
[24:36] thing for sure we're not going to build
[24:38] that future home no one has touched that
[24:40] future home except God
[24:42] himself and when that City comes down
[24:45] everything's going to be in order you've
[24:48] in between all this you've got a white
[24:51] Throne
[24:52] judgment right
[24:56] millennium
[24:58] Satan is loose for a
[25:01] season everybody understand
[25:04] this you've got a battle of Gog and
[25:06] Magog which there in right in there
[25:09] you're going to have your white Throne
[25:11] judgment cuz you're going to be judged
[25:13] the people are going to be raised up all
[25:17] the people of the world that's died
[25:18] without Christ is going to be raised up
[25:20] and have to go before God in the white
[25:24] Throne judgment and be judged that's
[25:26] where your Bible says divided between
[25:28] the sheep and the goats all right that's
[25:32] where the guy that that change your tire
[25:34] or the guy that give you a cup of water
[25:36] for no other purpose than just to be
[25:38] kind to you that's where you're going to
[25:40] see that man walk up and him walk away
[25:43] to go into judgment and um we're going
[25:47] to be able to say excuse me Lord you
[25:49] said in your word that it if they would
[25:52] do this that it wouldn't be forgotten
[25:55] here Jesus said it won't be forgotten
[25:57] here are there right here are there so
[26:02] there is where we'll be so if we're
[26:04] standing there you just remind God he
[26:07] don't mind you reminding him just remind
[26:09] God said hey that man changed my so
[26:11] would that be the Heathen that he was
[26:13] talking about no no the Heathen is
[26:16] something
[26:18] something no the the one Throne judgment
[26:21] is every other individual that's ever
[26:23] lived on the face of the Earth is going
[26:25] to have to give an account
[26:28] and that's going to be the man that like
[26:29] I said changes your tire uh or the man
[26:33] that gives you you know a ride somewhere
[26:35] or helps you out you just say excuse me
[26:38] Lord I remember when this person did
[26:41] this for me he said oh yeah enter into
[26:43] the joy of the Lord that's where that
[26:44] says enter into the joy of the Lord cuz
[26:46] he tells us that here when we get a body
[26:48] change we don't need to be told to enter
[26:50] into the joy of the Lord when you're
[26:51] born again you've entered into the joy
[26:53] of the Lord you got to remember one
[26:54] thing that guy may be a rank sinner he
[26:56] may be a wher have 15 wives but you're
[27:00] the one that's going to impart eternal
[27:01] life to him and then you're going to get
[27:03] to tell him about Jesus Christ you're
[27:05] going to get to tell him why he got
[27:07] eternal life not because of great me no
[27:12] but because of what was living inside of
[27:14] me he was good to me and Jesus said I'll
[27:18] not ever forget it here or there so
[27:22] there's where the white thr judgment in
[27:23] and then the Battle of Gog and Magog now
[27:25] the Battle of Gog and Magog is not man's
[27:28] fire that's God's fire that's right
[27:30] that's the fire of God that's when the
[27:33] souls will be burnt up put into the put
[27:36] into the Smoking Pit all right everybody
[27:39] understand that that's when you got your
[27:41] real separation that's when everything's
[27:43] done we're fixing to go into eternity
[27:46] then the whole earth remember the the
[27:49] the brother R said the mountain pushes
[27:51] up over there in Palestine and the city
[27:53] comes down now that City we've never
[27:55] seen that City we've never had to build
[27:58] that city was built by God you if you
[28:00] read the future home I wouldn't have to
[28:02] sit here and do this for 20 minutes I'm
[28:03] sorry I'm just being plain if you read
[28:06] the future home it exactly tells you
[28:08] exactly what I just said okay so go back
[28:11] and read the future home again if you
[28:12] haven't read it then you should have
[28:14] read it already or listen to the tape
[28:18] but does everybody understand now always
[28:20] remember one thing to keep them separate
[28:22] the Millennium is in time there are
[28:24] still there are still things that can
[28:27] happen
[28:28] Happ future home is done everything is
[28:31] eternal from
[28:33] the solar system all the way down to the
[28:36] middle of Earth it's Eternal you never
[28:39] have to build another house worry about
[28:42] Satan anymore of course we don't but I'm
[28:44] talking about the whole world the Earth
[28:46] cuz remember we're part of the earth the
[28:48] earth comes after we do whatever happens
[28:51] to us see because we get a fiery baptism
[28:54] at the Holy Ghost right right we get a
[28:57] fire baptism that burns out all the old
[28:59] you all right that's the first
[29:02] fire right then we're going to get a
[29:05] fiery baptism like Gog and Magog and
[29:07] it's not going to kill our soul it's
[29:09] going to change our body right God's
[29:11] fire is going to come down and burn Mama
[29:13] and Daddy's part of this away you
[29:16] understand we're not going it's not
[29:17] going to brother R said your your Rob
[29:19] will drop off it's not you're not going
[29:21] to be like a uh what's those things that
[29:23] change that apens and whatever that come
[29:25] out of the shell and you see the shell
[29:27] cicada a cicada everybody seen those
[29:29] little bugs on the side of the trees
[29:31] that that inside it made a new bug and
[29:33] it popped out that that piece is going
[29:35] to Ste no we're not going to have bodies
[29:37] laying around somewhere God's going to
[29:38] just change these atoms right
[29:41] here see that's the great mystery that
[29:43] this thing's going to be changed right
[29:45] here this thing the one that you live in
[29:48] right now is going to be changed to a
[29:50] 20-year old
[29:51] person and then what's going to happen
[29:53] to the earth the earth is going to
[29:55] follow because see remember this is
[29:56] Earth
[29:58] this is where the curse started right
[30:00] right the the curse started with man
[30:03] getting cursed then God said I'm cursing
[30:06] the Earth right so he's got to take that
[30:09] sin curse off the Earth so he's taking a
[30:12] sin curse off of this Earth he's not
[30:14] getting a new one not a new Earth but
[30:16] brother random said what going to burn
[30:18] off cuz remember the Holy Ghost burns
[30:20] your soul it doesn't burn your body but
[30:22] now remember your body's going to come
[30:23] into subjection but he's going to take
[30:26] that new heaven before the new Heaven
[30:28] and new earth before the new Heaven and
[30:30] new earth
[30:31] comes right was she asleep no before the
[30:38] you before the new Heaven and new earth
[30:41] comes you're going to get a new Heaven
[30:43] and a new Earth not new like in this one
[30:47] done away and you getting no you
[30:49] understand what I'm saying yes you'll be
[30:50] made new right this will be burnt Mama
[30:53] and Daddy's genetics will be burnt out
[30:55] of this man right here right and I'll
[30:57] not be the son of Samuel and Peggy Dale
[31:00] anymore but that's going to happen here
[31:03] that's why I see don't worry about what
[31:05] the Millennium goes on in the Millennium
[31:06] I have never worried about people sit
[31:08] down and and and worry about what we're
[31:10] going to eat what we're how just get
[31:12] there that's right just get there it's
[31:16] too much information going through our
[31:17] head sometime you know are we going to
[31:19] have cows there they going to you know
[31:21] I've heard them say well are they going
[31:22] to all cows are they going to I mean
[31:24] animals are they going to repr I don't
[31:26] care
[31:30] OWC for those of you on the internet OWC
[31:33] means oh who
[31:34] cares and really don't get caught up in
[31:37] stuff like this just remember two basic
[31:40] things in the Millennium there's still
[31:43] time and things can happen that's not
[31:45] going to happen in a future
[31:47] home Millennium is going to be the fire
[31:50] of man kill off and burn this
[31:53] Earth because we're going to come right
[31:55] back down here and live for a th000
[31:56] years years well in th000 years look hey
[32:00] look at America um well look at 2,000
[32:03] years ago 2,000 years ago Jesus was here
[32:06] and there was nobody on the Earth but
[32:08] look how it's grown in 2,000 years look
[32:10] how it's grown in 100 years look how the
[32:12] United States went from Indians 250
[32:14] years ago to look at what we populate in
[32:17] just 250 years now there's one thing for
[32:19] sure we're not going to have babies and
[32:21] have relations with our wife and all
[32:23] this stuff that's going to be gone that
[32:25] curse is going to be took care of right
[32:27] here everybody understand that so in the
[32:29] but in the Millennium we build houses
[32:32] you say well we're going to get
[32:34] tight don't worry about it don't worry
[32:39] who's going to build and who's going to
[32:41] inhabit just give me a rock to sit on
[32:44] for a th years what what's that going to
[32:45] make what's that going to bother me and
[32:47] you but there's things that's got to
[32:49] happen to other people right let's just
[32:52] remember one thing the Bride of Jesus
[32:54] Christ is sealed in with the baptism of
[32:56] the Holy Ghost and when that fire comes
[32:58] down and burns out this old man and I
[33:00] become a 20-y old
[33:03] again once my body's changed here
[33:06] there's nothing in the
[33:08] world of the world or this world is
[33:11] going to bother this man right
[33:13] here but we still have to go through the
[33:16] steps of going into the Millennium with
[33:18] the 144,000 and with the Heathen
[33:20] wherever how that is you got just one
[33:22] quote by Brother brown but ever how that
[33:25] transpires remember when one thing you
[33:27] and I are glorified there's no way we're
[33:30] going to change we're going to be no
[33:32] different we're still going to be the
[33:34] same people that we were when we were
[33:36] changed on this side the dead saints
[33:38] that come up once they're changed
[33:40] there's no there's no more movement for
[33:43] me and you we have become God incarnate
[33:46] on the earth because remember when we go
[33:48] up that's what helps this guy become an
[33:52] incarnate poet he sees how God
[33:55] incarnates me and you and we go out of
[33:57] here and he comes down here he can't
[33:58] stand being up there he's got he wants
[34:00] to be down here and incarnate in a pole
[34:03] but let's not worry about those
[34:06] things if you're born again free ticket
[34:10] but I want to be born again and changed
[34:12] here and not have to go down into this
[34:14] Earth and be
[34:17] buried right I don't want that to
[34:20] happen I'm saying I'm not going to
[34:23] die but if I do I'm going to come up and
[34:27] I'm going to be changed before you guys
[34:28] are if you're still
[34:30] here and I'm going to be over there in
[34:32] the sixth Dimension going come on come
[34:36] on I'm like brother Fred mull you know I
[34:40] I want to be in the front of the
[34:42] line just being competitive you know I
[34:45] want to be in the front I want be the
[34:47] first one changed right but he said I
[34:49] really don't care if I'm a last one
[34:50] changed either long as I'm changed so
[34:53] okay I know you said that you don't
[34:55] understand the part about the he
[34:57] but like in in the Millennium sense
[35:00] we're still going to be in time and the
[35:01] Heen going to be there could that be
[35:04] like our fam some of our
[35:07] families that we could we'll be able to
[35:10] talk to them no we'll be able to talk
[35:12] who what I'm saying are they going to
[35:15] have do you think since you don't know
[35:17] for sure that they will have the
[35:18] opportunity to
[35:22] no there's just there's just there's one
[35:24] quote one quote brother Brown says about
[35:27] Heathen being raised up in the
[35:29] Millennium and being told of Jesus
[35:31] Christ now I don't know if that's
[35:33] somebody off in the hot tops of Africa
[35:35] but listen let me make one thing plain
[35:39] family or not if you're not born again
[35:42] when the Rapture takes
[35:45] place you're not going to be here during
[35:47] the Millennium that's right period
[35:49] That's Right
[35:52] period period you're dead and you going
[35:55] to come up in that white Throne judgment
[35:56] and you you going to be judged for what
[35:57] you've done period there's no God's not
[36:01] going to be now he may give you your
[36:03] family at the white Throne judgment but
[36:05] they're not going to to receive any
[36:07] blessing they're going to be in that
[36:09] Fifth Dimension that falling hideous
[36:12] horrible place until they come up in the
[36:14] white Throne judgment and then they can
[36:16] be given eternal life but not during
[36:18] that
[36:18] Millennium that Millennium is you and I
[36:22] let me let me just make this real plain
[36:23] the Millennium is our vacation
[36:29] you know you go and you go on a
[36:30] honeymoon you consummate the marriage
[36:33] and you don't turn around and go back
[36:34] home some of you may have but usually
[36:37] you take about a week off you know kind
[36:38] of enjoy yourself and go somewhere and
[36:41] take a cruise well you know what we're
[36:42] going to take a Thousand-Year
[36:44] Cruise we're going to be able to travel
[36:46] like a thought we're going to be
[36:48] unlimited now the earth I know I'm
[36:50] getting long but the Earth and
[36:53] everything else is going to be limited
[36:55] to days and times and Seasons cuz it's
[36:57] still going to be in time we're still
[36:59] going to have a 24-hour day but you and
[37:02] I are not you and I could go set on the
[37:05] moon and talk if we wanted to during
[37:07] that time we're unlimited but everybody
[37:09] else is limited because look we go first
