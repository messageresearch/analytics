[29:00] father we thank you for the grace and
[29:03] the love and understanding that you have
[29:05] given into our hearts and our lives Lord
[29:08] we thank you for these children that
[29:10] Lord
[29:11] have put forth their effort to try to
[29:15] worship you and to serve you and to sing
[29:18] about you and to do all the things

[29:36] you and we thank you guide us now and
[29:38] keep us in Jesus name
[29:41] amen Galatians 3 we'll start verse 13
[29:46] through 16 and then we'll go to 28 and
[29:49] 29 all
[29:51] right Christ has redeemed us from the
[29:54] curse of the
[29:55] law being made a curse now remember what
[29:58] curse is everyone that hangs on the tree
[29:59] right where it is written cursed is
[30:01] everyone that hangeth on a tree that the
[30:03] blessings of Abraham might come on the
[30:05] Gentiles through Jesus Christ and that
[30:08] we might receive the promise of the
[30:11] spirit through faith Brethren I speak
[30:14] after the manner of men though it be but
[30:16] a man's Covenant but yet if it be
[30:19] confirmed no man disol or adth there
[30:22] unto now to Abraham and his seed were
[30:25] the promises made now what promises made
[30:28] not just one we'll get to it in a little
[30:31] bit it's not just eternal
[30:33] life it's
[30:36] promises all right made he saith not
[30:39] unto seeds as of many but as of one and
[30:43] to thy seed which is Christ all right
[30:46] drop over now to verse
[30:49] 28 he says there is neither Jew nor
[30:53] Gentile there's neither Bond or free
[30:56] there is neither male male nor female
[30:58] for you are all one in Christ Jesus and
[31:02] if you be
[31:03] Christ plural now watch then are you
[31:07] Abraham's seed and HS according to the
[31:12] promise you may be seated the Lord had
[31:14] his Blessing to the reading of the
[31:17] word
[31:21] now I want you
[31:23] to think about something this afternoon
[31:26] because that's what we're going to talk
[31:27] about we're going to talk about the
[31:29] promises made to the bride
[31:35] am we need some more beds for people to
[31:38] sleep in Saturday night okay we need
[31:42] some people who have beds that nobody is
[31:46] in that
[31:48] bed uh you know because we don't need
[31:50] just beds with people in them we need
[31:52] somebody to be able to supply a bed to
[31:56] be a able to take up the slack on the
[32:00] you know people that are here and we got
[32:02] to know about it now because you know
[32:04] people will be coming and not even H not
[32:07] having to go back home we need to be
[32:12] able to put them up here and doing that
[32:14] okay so if you will make sure you let us
[32:17] know all
[32:18] right
[32:22] now to
[32:24] me let me see if I can remember the
[32:26] statement first close I had rather have
[32:29] a promise from
[32:31] God than all in the world that you could
[32:34] do to try to you know give me something
[32:38] or whatever this is or whatever that is
[32:40] I would still cherish a promise from God
[32:43] more than anything
[32:45] real that could be given unto me because
[32:50] I know that he will keep his
[32:53] promises and to me now the entire book
[32:57] that's why I read it like I did and
[32:59] emphasized on it it says
[33:01] promises not just eternal
[33:03] life there's a lot of promises in God's
[33:06] word amen and that way if if we can
[33:09] believe they for us now here's the point
[33:12] that first we've got to believe they're
[33:15] for us right you know I mean there's
[33:19] there's a a lot of uh promises out there
[33:23] in the world you can hear them all the
[33:25] time you know on the on the things that
[33:27] call in this number and we've got a
[33:29] whole bunch of this that's and the
[33:30] others and we've lost contact with
[33:32] people Etc and we're trying to find them
[33:35] you know well you know well that's
[33:38] promises but the thing of it is we got
[33:40] to believe that promise is for
[33:42] us now to believe it's for somebody else
[33:46] that's wonderful that's all right but we
[33:49] must believe it's for
[33:52] us okay and see then that will if we
[33:55] believe it's for us then will have the
[33:58] uh more Assurance of seeking after that
[34:03] to where that it can be ours all right
[34:06] what were we talking about this morning
[34:09] that awake thou that sleepest you
[34:13] know see there's a lot of people out
[34:15] there that's still asleep because they
[34:16] don't know the promises they don't know
[34:18] it's for them and and I'm sorry to say
[34:21] that in the time and and parts that I've
[34:24] been around the message and watching the
[34:26] people
[34:27] the people of this message are the very
[34:29] lowest about remembering the promises
[34:31] right you know they talk about something
[34:35] that will
[34:37] be hopefully
[34:40] someday you know yeah we we believe that
[34:44] yeah yeah we believe that uh you know we
[34:47] believe one of these days there's going
[34:49] to be a bride you know well why can't we
[34:54] believe that it's
[34:55] now
[34:58] I mean we we say well we believe it's
[35:00] going to be it's going to do that's
[35:01] we're going to have this or that now
[35:04] here is my whole point what have we been
[35:06] on positive
[35:08] attitude if you won't
[35:10] confess the promises that God has made
[35:13] for you how can he fulfill them right
[35:17] amen that's right now remember he can't
[35:20] save you remember the other week unless
[35:24] you want to be saved he can't heal you
[35:28] unless you want to be healed all right
[35:30] see then we got to remember the promises
[35:32] and he said what his promises were yay
[35:34] and amen all right now so what I'm
[35:39] wanting us to think about a positive
[35:44] attitude and think about the promises
[35:46] are for us
[35:49] amen now I I think that God would not be
[35:53] uh what would you call it offended with
[35:55] us
[35:57] if we put it on the basis of believing
[36:00] it for
[36:03] ourselves you know that's
[36:05] mine right you
[36:08] know all right because remember what has
[36:10] been our point of of of positive
[36:13] attitude those who
[36:16] believe that they are called for that
[36:20] job they are that that's for them see
[36:24] Martin Luther had to believe that God
[36:26] called him and then God could come on
[36:29] the scene amen well right now that's the
[36:31] point I want us to think
[36:33] about the promises of God throughout the
[36:36] word and you know who therefore
[36:39] far how much would be greater now uh
[36:42] anyone who believes God can receive
[36:45] benefits right right just anybody if
[36:49] they really
[36:50] believe but what about the children of
[36:54] God and that's where Paul emphatic is
[36:57] stating it see and brother BR said he he
[37:00] was putting it to where that he was
[37:02] putting himself in there into that one
[37:07] seed which is
[37:09] Christ and he wanted us to know that he
[37:11] believed that he was a part of that
[37:14] right all right and see that's what we
[37:16] were to
[37:17] do it's not Jew it's not Gentile we read
[37:21] that all right but it's the Christ the
[37:26] promise
[37:27] all right see he
[37:30] promised this
[37:32] rde in the end
[37:35] time many marvelous
[37:38] things right amen you know well why
[37:40] can't we believe that we're them right
[37:44] amen but remember the point if we won't
[37:46] say it's for
[37:49] us or if we won't say what God says we
[37:53] are how can he make it manifest that's
[37:56] right you you remember what we've been
[37:57] on now death is what death is
[38:02] unbelief he that believeth not is
[38:04] condemned already all right see if we
[38:08] won't confess it we're dead we have no
[38:11] hopes well why can't we start confessing
[38:14] it well I brother know like people say
[38:17] you know I was listening last night to a
[38:19] tape where brother Bram was talking
[38:21] about
[38:21] that lady saying that she was healed and
[38:25] you remember her own husband and said
[38:27] and both of them Christians he said he
[38:29] said her husband said but honey you know
[38:33] I mean it's all right but said you know
[38:36] you're out here saying you're healed
[38:38] when you're
[38:41] not well you see that's oh that's really
[38:45] honesty isn't
[38:46] it now I I I don't want to say something
[38:50] that's not
[38:52] true and the you know I know the Bible
[38:55] says I'm Healed but my name is not
[38:57] written there so that might not be me
[39:01] you
[39:03] know well why
[39:06] not it's my
[39:08] Bible why can't I believe he's talking
[39:10] about me all right that's the only thing
[39:13] that I'm talking about not trying to
[39:16] work up something because I learned a
[39:19] long time ago you can't work up anything
[39:21] in this message you know it might Li for
[39:25] a little while you might get some
[39:27] emotionals going for a little while but
[39:29] it won't be long little
[39:31] die right but you know what if a
[39:35] spontaneous combustion comes Among Us
[39:38] why can't we all believe that it's for
[39:40] us and all of
[39:42] us think about
[39:45] that I I thought we were to be as the
[39:48] prophet said that it says he was wounded
[39:52] for Samuel
[39:54] Dale I thought we believe believe we
[39:56] were supposed to put our name right in
[39:59] that place and confess it that way oh
[40:03] yeah we can say oh yeah he would he he
[40:05] he was he was that for so and so yeah we
[40:07] believe
[40:08] that but I don't want to lie now and I
[40:12] just don't feel no better well don't
[40:14] worry about it you're going to die with
[40:16] what you
[40:18] got well you just just you just ain't
[40:20] much of a nice guy no but is it
[40:23] true I mean you know you're going to die
[40:26] what you got if you w confess to get rid
[40:28] of it all right but then the positive
[40:32] attitude is not to just say okay I'm
[40:34] going to I'm going to confess I'm I'm
[40:37] Healed okay wonderful your part
[40:42] word you remember what I was saying this
[40:46] morning where the Prophet
[40:48] said it's not what you
[40:53] pray come on that really sunk in to me
[40:56] he said it's not what you pray it's not
[40:59] the words you use see we think we're
[41:02] using great words to uh you know bring
[41:06] God on the scene or to do
[41:09] something and that's not it he said it's
[41:11] your
[41:13] faith your Revelation your faith in what
[41:16] you're doing all right now your faith
[41:19] can only be related to you
[41:23] amen your faith is not my faith
[41:26] just because you got saved didn't make
[41:28] me
[41:29] saved right this is not something to
[41:32] where they just lumped on all of us and
[41:35] what starts a
[41:37] Revival always the record of a Revival
[41:40] started was started from one person or
[41:43] something maybe one or two get together
[41:46] or something would start a Revival that
[41:48] would turn the world upside
[41:50] down but you know what they believed it
[41:53] and when are we going to start believing
[41:56] that we're the people of God Amen well
[41:58] brother D I believe
[42:00] that but I just have
[42:03] problems because look at look at how
[42:06] sickly we
[42:08] are I'll get to that Wednesday I don't
[42:10] want to spend so much time on it because
[42:13] I want you to think there's no
[42:15] negativism in Hebrews
[42:17] 13:8 that's right so our little pity
[42:20] patter things that we bring in are no
[42:23] good our little it's not for me right is
[42:27] exactly right it's not for you you're
[42:31] confessing it I wish we would confess
[42:35] the word as much as we confess the
[42:38] realities of
[42:39] life you know how you feel well I'm down
[42:43] and out I'm having problem I've got this
[42:46] and I got
[42:47] that well you know what you just keep
[42:50] this and
[42:54] that cuz it lead least if you said I am
[42:57] healed you are saying what God Said and
[43:01] he can come on the scene but he can't
[43:03] come on the scene when it's just a bunch
[43:05] of negativism and you know I got to get
[43:08] off that all right but think about
[43:13] it a positive
[43:16] attitude and think about the promises
[43:19] that God has made for you and
[43:24] I there's really you
[43:28] know there's nothing in the book that's
[43:30] not a promise for you and I all we had
[43:33] heard all things right all right but
[43:37] when are we going to start saying it and
[43:39] doing
[43:41] it but you know I mean I'm honest and we
[43:44] do it we're human beings we hurt we're
[43:46] sick there's no such thing as as uh
[43:49] positive thinking to a point of saying
[43:51] well I'll just say I'm not sick and I
[43:53] won't be sick no that's lying it there's
[43:56] where you're lying at it's not lying to
[43:59] say that you're healed because God says
[44:02] you're healed right all
[44:05] right but he I want that point in in our
[44:10] minds he cannot heal us if we won't
[44:14] confess we're
[44:17] healed right he can't save us if we
[44:20] won't confess where're he saved amen but
[44:25] see our point is we confess it as long
[44:27] as everything's working
[44:30] good
[44:32] right it's real easy to say you're a
[44:35] millionaire if you got it in the
[44:37] hand right but when you got a dime in
[44:40] your
[44:42] pocket it's hard to say You're A
[44:45] Millionaire right right but you know
[44:47] what you got a million dollars you
[44:50] started with the
[44:51] dime right you started somewhere with
[44:55] that some point well why not start with
[44:58] a positive attitude about life and doing
[45:00] you know that I've always preached that
[45:02] now this is not something new it's just
[45:04] the form of trying to get it lined up in
[45:06] the
[45:08] word I've always told you you call me up
[45:11] how you doing
[45:15] wonderful it's hard to go to the doctor
[45:18] how you doing I'm doing wonderful well
[45:20] what are you doing here well okay doc my
[45:22] leg's hurting how about helping out you
[45:24] know
[45:26] because that way you know but they just
[45:29] don't understand
[45:31] you and then turned around the doctor
[45:33] said well look you got this and look got
[45:34] that and you say well thank you
[45:37] doctor but by Stripes I'm
[45:42] Healed right back in his
[45:45] face you might find out a lot of them
[45:48] believe they might want to believe with
[45:50] you you know I mean I said that to one
[45:53] when had that GL taken off you know and
[45:55] he came in there he said Sam he said can
[45:58] I pray for you before I operate on you I
[46:00] said I sure wish you
[46:03] would am you know I I sure wish you
[46:07] would well you know what I mean he
[46:10] prayed for
[46:11] me right there amen well all right I I
[46:16] don't want nobody don't believe the way
[46:18] I
[46:21] believe if I had that attitude I
[46:23] wouldn't want nobody to believe the way
[46:24] I believed either
[46:28] amen did that didn't get
[46:31] across you know I wouldn't want nobody
[46:34] to believe the way I believe if I don't
[46:37] believe but see I'm trying to believe
[46:39] all
[46:41] things the prophet speaks of believing
[46:44] for the
[46:46] impossible well here's faith when I see
[46:50] it I'll believe it and I'll say it well
[46:53] you'll never say it right
[46:56] it'll never come to pass that way right
[46:59] why because God wants somebody to say it
[47:02] am why does it say speak to this
[47:06] mountain come on why does it say that
[47:11] cuz somebody's got to speak to the
[47:16] mountain well see why can't we start
[47:18] saying
[47:20] it and no matter how sick or we get is
[47:25] that the way way the prophet describes
[47:27] sickness a lot of times that when you're
[47:28] prayed for and you get sicker it's the
[47:32] greatest
[47:36] sign but you know that's hard to
[47:40] do I agree with you it's hard to
[47:43] do you know all right but think about it
[47:48] now the promises made to this seed that
[47:53] we believe that we're part of
[47:56] and that means the entire Bible now I'll
[48:00] just scan through and won't have to pull
[48:02] these up but just to give you a thought
[48:04] listen to what he
[48:06] says he's talking about the promises he
[48:09] made in the
[48:11] Bible he said now if what if the
[48:15] promises he made in the Bible is not
[48:20] true then it's not the
[48:22] Bible or there is no God you can read it
[48:26] right
[48:29] there now if we think the
[48:32] promises are not
[48:36] true see then there is no Bible and
[48:38] there is no God but if the bible
[48:41] promises are true and God confirms them
[48:45] promises then he's the god of the Bible
[48:47] which is the
[48:51] word all
[48:54] right but but yet if we say it's for
[48:58] somebody
[49:00] else but not for
[49:02] me now you've taken yourself out of the
[49:06] word true you re you withdrew
[49:11] yourself from being part of the word all
[49:15] right now God doesn't need another boat
[49:19] so don't get all tied up in your
[49:22] theology God don't need another Ark
[49:25] right that's done been done
[49:28] right but he needs something else you
[49:31] know what he needs in the end time he
[49:33] needs a group of
[49:35] people that every day they're getting
[49:37] sicker and dying and going towards the
[49:40] grave but yet they can stand up and face
[49:43] death and
[49:44] say death where your sting grave where
[49:47] your
[49:48] Victory
[49:50] sir and I don't mean just say that CA
[49:53] somebody else said it
[49:56] amen say it because it's for you and
[49:59] I all right every promise in the book is
[50:03] mine every chapter every verse every
[50:06] line that's right I'm trusting in his
[50:08] love divine for every promise in the
[50:10] book is mine look what he says I'm an
[50:13] air to all things through
[50:17] Christ come on I'm an air to my healing
[50:21] yes I'm an heir to my joy
[50:27] I'm an heir of Salvation purchased of
[50:31] God born of his Spirit worst in the
[50:35] blood everything that God promised is
[50:37] mine joint
[50:40] HS with the Lord
[50:44] Jesus now if anybody had a good case of
[50:49] circumstances but R always uses job but
[50:53] let me use the Lord Jesus
[50:57] where would it be that you could look at
[50:59] him and see and think about him as being
[51:06] God let me take the negative side of it
[51:09] if nothing else with it if you were back
[51:12] there if we were there and he was
[51:14] walking
[51:15] around what would you base the point of
[51:18] being that he was
[51:24] God h you say well the sick could be
[51:27] healed the anointing could
[51:31] work
[51:33] right but you understand what I
[51:36] mean whose side would we be
[51:39] on if we were back
[51:41] there just remember then whatever side
[51:44] you would have been on back there is the
[51:46] side you're on
[51:48] now all right but what about being joint
[51:53] hours well I just don't see how that
[51:55] could be see now you're in
[51:58] unbelief somebody planted that seed of
[52:01] death with inside of us that would deny
[52:05] God's
[52:08] word and yet maybe a lot of them was
[52:11] done with good intentions and good
[52:13] thoughts and might have been even
[52:14] telling the
[52:18] truth but that's what's killing us is
[52:21] what we've been
[52:22] taught right right
[52:26] well the doctor says that so and so well
[52:30] amen for the doctor we thank God for
[52:32] good doctors good doctors we thank God
[52:36] for good preachers good preachers we
[52:39] thank God for good people good people
[52:42] right
[52:43] right but there's a lot out there that's
[52:45] not
[52:48] good and that goes into the
[52:52] negativism that is destroying us
[52:55] but
[52:57] look he goes on to say in the
[53:00] unchangeable god working in unchangeable
[53:05] unexpectable ways no matter what the
[53:08] promise is it's yours
[53:13] anyhow you see you and I are going to
[53:16] have to and and we'll say this is right
[53:21] somebody somewhere someday will have to
[53:25] look death in the
[53:27] face and call it defeated right now
[53:31] that's in our mind somebody someday will
[53:36] do you go talk to people and they're
[53:38] telling you you know how I illustrate it
[53:40] you talk to people yes we believe we're
[53:42] in the end time yes we do Welly look at
[53:45] all these things taking
[53:47] place we if you kind of get along with
[53:49] that you're okay but you just start
[53:51] telling them yeah that's right it could
[53:54] be any day now
[53:55] now because it's all of these things
[53:58] piling up could be and you watch them
[54:00] well now I don't know about that I
[54:02] believe maybe 50 years from
[54:05] now all right I'm 74 I don't need 50 25
[54:10] is enough for
[54:12] me you know my point
[54:16] right I'm trying to put it off on the
[54:19] somebody
[54:21] else instead of taking it and standing
[54:23] right there and it admitting that I'm an
[54:27] unbeliever right oh no I I'm a Believer
[54:32] but what do we
[54:35] believe what is our
[54:38] believing what about it what about the
[54:41] promises God has made you and
[54:45] I you'll realize in the whole Bible is
[54:50] tied together y
[54:52] That's in a beautiful picture speaking
[54:55] of climaxing finishing ending
[55:00] whatever in a group of
[55:04] people that can take God's
[55:09] word right
[55:14] am
[55:16] now you remember we've Illustrated this
[55:19] a lot David wasn't afraid of Goliath
[55:23] that's right right why
[55:27] you remember how we bring it out why was
[55:29] it David wasn't afraid of
[55:32] goli why because he's been anointed to
[55:34] be king
[55:37] right he wasn't afraid of him and all of
[55:39] his brothers and his cousins and uncles
[55:42] or whatever he' took the whole Army
[55:47] himself cuz he'd been anointed to be
[55:50] king all
[55:54] right
[55:55] we are the bride of
[55:58] Christ we have been given a new
[56:02] birth which totally redeems the
[56:05] soul all
[56:07] right but we've been made a
[56:10] promise of a bodily
[56:16] change that is the day that we're to
[56:19] live why should we worry about death
[56:23] then
[56:26] amen why would we be concerned about
[56:30] dying you mean it bothers you about
[56:33] dying now come on we're human beings
[56:35] we're honest we're straight we're not
[56:37] going to get in front of the train and
[56:38] hurry it up
[56:41] no but are you afraid of
[56:46] dying fear had
[56:48] torment that's why you're
[56:50] dying cuz you're
[56:53] afraid right at least let me just stand
[56:56] there and say come on
[56:59] Satan you can take this body but maybe I
[57:02] said enough to where somebody can
[57:06] understand a little
[57:09] bit about what they're supposed to
[57:12] be that would be my desire my thoughts
[57:16] would to be able to plan in you if I
[57:18] pass on as to
[57:21] know brother Quinn wrote in the notes I
[57:25] noticed it a little email to us that the
[57:28] things that happened so many people
[57:29] saved and and all and he said brother
[57:32] Dale and the money y'all gave
[57:34] us that a part of that went to that trip
[57:37] and
[57:38] things and he said you know what that'll
[57:40] be counted to Y all yes well that was
[57:42] good right amen you know that was good
[57:47] all right so we have a part to do with
[57:49] it
[57:51] am now God don't need us
[57:56] but he honors that of what we do for him
[58:00] right
[58:02] amen but see he promised us we go
[58:05] through a lot we talk about the
[58:06] cankerworm pal worm Locust caterpillar
[58:09] that's a promise in God's word
[58:11] amen that somebody's going to come to
[58:13] that place we talk about the faith of
[58:16] the fathers it means somebody's going to
[58:19] come to that
[58:20] place we talk about the people in the
[58:23] end time being the
[58:27] fullness of the godhead
[58:30] bodily what about a group of
[58:33] people now when we first came into
[58:35] message did you think very much about
[58:37] that 20 years 30 years 40 years ago no
[58:41] because we didn't know it even
[58:44] existed take brother Brandon's message
[58:47] and listen to the
[58:50] promises that he talks about amen
[58:57] the whole message
[58:59] right everything and it's all pointing
[59:03] to you and I that's
[59:07] right promising a power that will come
[59:11] in his
[59:14] church that he can say all God was he
[59:17] poured into Christ or into Jesus and all
[59:20] Jesus he pours into the church God
[59:22] wanting his work done he sent his son
[59:25] the son wanting his work
[59:27] done sending him the
[59:30] church at that day you'll know that I am
[59:34] in the
[59:36] father you and me and I and you at that
[59:40] day but why should we be
[59:45] so what's the word down and
[59:49] out as until we have no joy
[59:56] you
[59:59] know I mean I watch some of you and I
[1:00:01] see you just and I don't mean just
[1:00:03] sitting but you
[1:00:05] just you're like death is waiting on you
[1:00:10] and you're slowly getting
[1:00:12] there forgive me for the illustration
[1:00:14] but that's about as good as I can come
[1:00:16] up
[1:00:21] with truth is truth we're getting older
[1:00:27] but you know what I thought we believed
[1:00:29] every day we live we was closer to being
[1:00:35] young that was what I thought you know
[1:00:37] have I missed
[1:00:40] it oh I'd love to be changed back about
[1:00:43] 30 years what good would it do you 40
[1:00:46] years give you 50 what good would it do
[1:00:49] you Abraham and Sarah was turned back to
[1:00:52] young man and young woman right right
[1:00:54] right but you know what that didn't even
[1:00:56] give him a
[1:00:59] baby come on am just because it made
[1:01:03] young didn't even give him a baby
[1:01:07] righten it took a change to come on
[1:01:10] him cuz he couldn't have a baby to start
[1:01:15] with why can't you and I look at things
[1:01:17] and be happy about it in the bases of
[1:01:21] thank you
[1:01:22] Lord of what has been made known
[1:01:27] you
[1:01:29] know of what has been made known to you
[1:01:31] and
[1:01:33] I want to be the happiest people there

[1:02:14] sicknesses my wife fusses at me all the
[1:02:17] time because I won't tell her that I'm
[1:02:18] hurt and I said what good does it do

[1:02:42] do a foot
[1:02:45] washing is a major piece of Masterpiece
[1:02:49] I guess he's developed over how to do
[1:02:53] it
[1:02:55] well but you know what he don't stop and
[1:02:59] not do it am he'd be justified in not
[1:03:03] doing it wouldn't
[1:03:07] he but he'll go do it amen
[1:03:11] well why can't that be an example amen
[1:03:15] absolutely amen as I've always told you
[1:03:17] about sister Trudy mcmillon there for 20
[1:03:21] something years drove four hours of a
[1:03:24] morning
[1:03:24] coming here in 4 hours evening going
[1:03:30] home but yet we're within holling
[1:03:32] distance almost and can't make
[1:03:36] it why don't you look around sometime at
[1:03:38] the people sitting around
[1:03:40] you that's right and quit pity pattern
[1:03:43] or parties in your
[1:03:45] own doings of how bad you feel and look
[1:03:49] at somebody
[1:03:50] else and see how bad they
[1:03:53] feel
[1:03:56] yeah but brother Dale you just don't
[1:03:58] understand I know it I agree with you no
[1:04:02] problems I don't
[1:04:06] understand what could God do any greater
[1:04:10] than what he's done right right yes sir
[1:04:12] come on somebody raise your hand tell me
[1:04:14] something God could
[1:04:18] do oh he could fill my pocket yeah
[1:04:20] that's about the way you
[1:04:23] think
[1:04:25] he's given us eternal life amen in our
[1:04:28] soul amen giving us the message of the
[1:04:32] hour and how many of you read the books
[1:04:36] and listen to the
[1:04:44] text but yet we're ready for
[1:04:47] Rapture oh yeah we're not inter
[1:04:50] Rapture
[1:04:52] no we're confessing with our mouth
[1:04:55] something that our being is not making
[1:05:00] manifest you know well there's a revival
[1:05:04] going on but I just don't see it so I
[1:05:08] guess it's not really going on but you
[1:05:10] know maybe they're having
[1:05:12] it what did the prophet say about even
[1:05:14] healings and that he said one person
[1:05:16] healed in a
[1:05:17] building it ought to throw everybody in
[1:05:23] desperation in that
[1:05:25] building but you know we also ought to
[1:05:28] remember that he said one wrong
[1:05:32] attitude in the building can cause
[1:05:36] others to not be
[1:05:38] healed and you don't quote the rest of
[1:05:42] that he said and that will be dealt with
[1:05:46] one day right that's something
[1:05:48] paraphrasing it but you know in other
[1:05:51] words you're going to give an
[1:05:52] account well Heaven helped me not to
[1:05:55] stand in somebody's
[1:05:58] way right but wouldn't it be something
[1:06:01] you come up here to me to be pray
[1:06:02] brother want you pray I'll pray for you
[1:06:04] but I just don't believe God healed like
[1:06:06] he used
[1:06:13] to right yeah right like I heard a man
[1:06:16] say one time talking to another two
[1:06:18] preachers one of them said to the other
[1:06:20] one he said you ain't got nothing and I
[1:06:22] ain't got nothing
[1:06:24] well they already sh up sat down resign
[1:06:26] for
[1:06:28] preaching because that negative attitude
[1:06:30] don't fit in God's word
[1:06:35] nowhere but of course he went right on
[1:06:37] preaching so did the other
[1:06:40] brother
[1:06:42] you but you see if we don't confess
[1:06:45] we're healed we can't be healed if we
[1:06:47] don't confess we're saved we can't be
[1:06:51] saved if we don't confess we can be
[1:06:55] changed it's not going to happen that's
[1:06:57] right amen that's right so at least let
[1:07:00] me say
[1:07:03] it it may be a hundred years from
[1:07:07] now but at least let me confess it here
[1:07:12] right because if I can stand here and
[1:07:15] say it someday it can take
[1:07:20] place right right amen
[1:07:25] at least let me give hope to the people
[1:07:28] yes I listen to and I've been around
[1:07:30] this message quite a while and you know
[1:07:32] that would you hear some of them
[1:07:34] preachers preaching well I think well my
[1:07:37] Lord I had a better understanding that
[1:07:40] in the Baptist Church
[1:07:45] yeah and I did
[1:07:48] right that's
[1:07:50] right that's the problem I
[1:07:52] did
[1:07:55] but
[1:07:57] yet we're just down and
[1:07:59] out you know I was discussing with some
[1:08:03] brothers one time like this and they
[1:08:05] were saying
[1:08:08] that well we need more signs and wonders
[1:08:11] I always agree with
[1:08:14] that you know we need more healing in
[1:08:17] Lula Amen Let Me amen
[1:08:19] it but now for me to say we don't have
[1:08:22] any in Lula I'm a liar right I'm an
[1:08:29] unbeliever now we're in a different
[1:08:32] category
[1:08:35] right at least let me give you a hope
[1:08:40] Amen in the way that I preach to word
[1:08:43] that you can attain unto it whether I
[1:08:46] make it or
[1:08:51] not let me try to help youen amen
[1:08:54] instead of hinder you you realize where
[1:08:56] the
[1:08:57] negativism you said hard to get off I
[1:09:00] want to preach on
[1:09:02] that I I I'll still preach it Wednesday
[1:09:05] it don't
[1:09:06] matter but see if you say that he's not
[1:09:08] the he same today in
[1:09:12] healing as he was in Jesus's ministry as
[1:09:17] he was in brother uh Paul's Ministry as
[1:09:20] he was in brother Brown's Ministry and
[1:09:22] you say he's not the same I want to tell
[1:09:25] you publicly and flatly and bluntly
[1:09:28] you're a liar amen and let me defend it
[1:09:32] with the
[1:09:32] gospel Hebrews
[1:09:37] 13:8 right amen Hebrews
[1:09:42] 138 says he's the same yesterday today
[1:09:46] but not
[1:09:50] tomorrow or yesterday he was ding
[1:09:53] brother around his ministry and the
[1:09:55] people but he's not here today now you
[1:09:57] know how I preach that and I make it
[1:09:59] straight and blunt there's none of us
[1:10:01] with that Ministry that he had no no way
[1:10:05] that's right I humanly personally and
[1:10:07] flatly bluntly tell you I don't I
[1:10:09] wouldn't want
[1:10:10] it cuz you don't know what went with
[1:10:12] that I know what goes with the little
[1:10:15] bit I
[1:10:17] got but you
[1:10:19] realize that same Ministry is still got
[1:10:23] to be here or Hebrews 138 as a
[1:10:27] liar well where's it at let's go look
[1:10:30] for it that's what they done when
[1:10:32] brother Brandon ped
[1:10:35] on when brother Brandon ped on I used to
[1:10:38] know the name of the man that they went
[1:10:41] out to there was this man had some signs
[1:10:43] and wonders and some gifts and you know
[1:10:45] what the big name people run out there
[1:10:49] to listen to
[1:10:51] him and brother Brown said there's not
[1:10:53] another one to
[1:10:55] come right
[1:10:58] amen if I told you who that they said
[1:11:01] went you would drop your lips and say oh
[1:11:03] no brother Dale
[1:11:08] well but you know what they were human
[1:11:11] they were looking for something that's
[1:11:13] right
[1:11:14] amen but that won't
[1:11:17] work but I believe the ministry of
[1:11:19] brother brandom is the ministry of Jesus
[1:11:21] Christ and I believe that Ministry of
[1:11:23] around the world in a many membered body
[1:11:27] how would you say it divided up as parts
[1:11:30] to you and I that we have just a little
[1:11:32] bit the other people have a little bit
[1:11:34] the other but it's all still here or
[1:11:36] either you're a liar right and Hebrews
[1:11:39] 13:8 is calling you
[1:11:44] one you realize how easy that un
[1:11:47] unbelief has slipped
[1:11:49] in oh if we were just back
[1:11:52] there
[1:11:54] had two brothers since I've been in this
[1:11:58] message that told me he said I was in
[1:12:01] brother Brown's
[1:12:02] Ministry and said I saw the signs and
[1:12:06] wonders I said brother Dale I believe
[1:12:08] the same God is in
[1:12:10] you you pray for me you know what God
[1:12:14] healed
[1:12:16] him
[1:12:18] sir was it me no it was their
[1:12:22] confidence their faith in what it was it
[1:12:24] didn't matter what I was what I was
[1:12:27] didn't have anything to do with it it's
[1:12:29] what they
[1:12:30] thought one day you'll see
[1:12:35] that he says there will come a power
[1:12:37] into the church and now is coming this
[1:12:40] is 1960 hear your himym that the Holy
[1:12:44] Spirit Will so anoint the people that
[1:12:47] they'll speak the word and it'll create
[1:12:49] itself right there we haven't seen
[1:12:52] Powers
[1:12:53] lights coming into the church now I know
[1:12:56] it for a fact say unto this mountain and
[1:13:00] it'll be removed amen that's your
[1:13:05] profit well I know it was in him yep it
[1:13:08] was in him
[1:13:09] now I don't believe it's nowh else we
[1:13:12] see you're trying to find it as I've
[1:13:15] said you're trying to find one other
[1:13:17] person that things are happening in
[1:13:20] instead of looking around the world and
[1:13:23] say
[1:13:24] in he is Hebrews
[1:13:26] 13:8 if he ever done one thing he can't
[1:13:29] take it
[1:13:33] back it's here amen but when are we
[1:13:37] going to believe
[1:13:43] it God has revealed God was revealed in

[1:23:19] glory for the promises he made that he's
[1:23:22] keeping for you and
[1:23:25] I you know that he promised in the end
[1:23:28] time that the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:23:30] would be the fullness of the godhead
[1:23:32] bodily how many times I need to read all
[1:23:35] of
[1:23:37] that he said and no leav among you
[1:23:40] brings that
[1:23:42] fullness amen he promised a seed to come
[1:23:46] down and finish in the excuse me in the
[1:23:49] form of the Grain in the end time
[1:23:53] the original grain that went into the
[1:23:57] ground he promised the dead to be raised
[1:24:00] the sick to be healed at a
[1:24:05] word I listening we were the other day
[1:24:08] to a tape and you know what brother
[1:24:10] Brown
[1:24:12] said he said you want to see angels in
[1:24:15] your
[1:24:18] home you know what he
[1:24:21] said he said make them
[1:24:24] welcome I'm paraphrasing it but that's
[1:24:26] his
[1:24:27] words make them
[1:24:29] welcome he said the reason you don't see
[1:24:31] angels in your home that there's too
[1:24:33] much
[1:24:34] there that the Angels don't
[1:24:40] like well you know what see I tell it in
[1:24:43] people that get all offended to do I've
[1:24:45] seen an angel three times but you know
[1:24:48] what I didn't come out of that saying
[1:24:49] bless God I've seen an angel three times
[1:24:51] I guess I I had it in good shape you
[1:24:54] know what the thought was I used to have
[1:24:56] it in good
[1:24:57] shape maybe the reason I ain't seeing
[1:25:00] them
[1:25:01] now is because of the shape I'm
[1:25:04] in I never come out of it as a great
[1:25:08] thing of looking what I've done or what
[1:25:11] I've
[1:25:12] been I said Lord I'm
[1:25:15] sorry I'm sorry that you couldn't come
[1:25:17] in my
[1:25:20] home like you've come in my home
[1:25:27] before you see I'm not trying to live no
[1:25:29] goody two shoes in front of you to let
[1:25:30] you think I'm this Dad or the other I
[1:25:33] try to tell it like it is maybe the
[1:25:36] reason we're not in the presence of God
[1:25:37] a lot of times it's because we've run
[1:25:39] the presence of God off that's right
[1:25:43] amen did the prophet say thr out them
[1:25:46] vulgar magazines throw out this and
[1:25:49] throw out that we turned around and put
[1:25:52] them in computers don't call them
[1:25:58] TVs we don't even call them what is that
[1:26:00] other words in the middle monitors we
[1:26:02] don't even call them monitors we call
[1:26:04] them
[1:26:06] computers same old
[1:26:11] thing I'm honest what about
[1:26:15] you but the promises and you know
[1:26:21] what and let me end it with this
[1:26:24] thought you know he made the
[1:26:28] promises and you know what we can't be
[1:26:30] dirty enough to keep him from keeping
[1:26:33] his
[1:26:34] word I know you don't want to think like
[1:26:38] that he still comes in our homes he
[1:26:42] still comes in and heals us he still
[1:26:44] comes and delivers
[1:26:47] us
[1:26:51] right
[1:26:53] because he promised it that's
[1:26:57] right I like brother Mo he had a way of
[1:27:01] saying it said you can't not paraphrase
[1:27:04] he said you can't be good enough to be
[1:27:07] saved but you can't be bad enough that
[1:27:10] God can't save
[1:27:11] you that's a paraphrase from what he
[1:27:14] used to say at somewh like
[1:27:15] that you know God's going to keep his
[1:27:18] word but you know what we may get a lot
[1:27:20] of weapons to line us up to what he
[1:27:23] wants us to
[1:27:26] do but you don't want anytime sickness
[1:27:28] to come what did I do
[1:27:37] Lord Brother R said
[1:27:39] pray ask God to forgive you cleanse you
[1:27:42] up get started right he said the
[1:27:45] sickness don't go away he said God's got
[1:27:48] it there for a
[1:27:49] reason right right it don't mean you
[1:27:53] don't pray for it no more to be gone
[1:27:55] he's got it there for a reason let him
[1:27:58] work out his
[1:28:00] doings
[1:28:01] right I told a car fractor the other day
[1:28:04] I went Friday and I said maybe the Lord
[1:28:07] trying to tell me I need to sit down I
[1:28:09] said cuz I can sit down I don't
[1:28:11] hurt he just laughed at me cuz he knew I
[1:28:14] wasn't going to sit
[1:28:15] down I said you just straighten up my
[1:28:17] back cuz I'm heading out hunting I don't
[1:28:20] want my back hurting you can help me
[1:28:22] help
[1:28:25] me but you see
[1:28:27] church God made a lot of
[1:28:30] promises you know what he's going to
[1:28:32] keep them
[1:28:33] am you know the difference is is whether
[1:28:36] or not we can believe it's for us we'll
[1:28:39] determine whether or not it is for
[1:28:46] us
[1:28:48] right
[1:28:50] promises all the promise promises in the
[1:28:52] book of
[1:28:53] mine with the last promise you remember
[1:28:57] how we were bring it in the ages and
[1:28:58] obious see all this ties together bring
[1:29:01] it in the ages
[1:29:03] of the last is to inert all things
[1:29:06] because it keeps coming down but then
[1:29:08] when we get it then it'll go all the way
[1:29:10] back to the original in the beginning
[1:29:13] and it'll all tie together
[1:29:15] right did I hope you followed that amen
[1:29:19] we're going to receive greater things
[1:29:21] than is been made manifest upon Earth
[1:29:23] yes cuz we're going to go through a
[1:29:25] change of the body but you know what
[1:29:27] we're not the only ones going to go
[1:29:29] through that's why I love it the Bible
[1:29:32] doesn't say that the last day group is
[1:29:34] the only one to be changed it says the
[1:29:36] dead in Christ shall rise first and we
[1:29:38] which are alive and remain because we
[1:29:40] shall all be
[1:29:46] changed
[1:29:49] right and you're not going to look down
[1:29:51] Luther and you you just you go sit down
[1:29:53] over there in the corner we are the
[1:29:55] great people no just don't worry about
[1:29:57] it you're not going to be
[1:29:59] there forget
[1:30:04] that went to a meeting one time in a
[1:30:06] church and this brother he said man come
[1:30:09] over he wasn't a pastor he was another I
[1:30:11] guess a deacon or something he said
[1:30:13] brother Dale we want you to sit right
[1:30:14] here I said no
[1:30:18] way I'm going back here
[1:30:23] the pastor come in he said brother Dale
[1:30:26] we want you to come up
[1:30:27] here I said no way I'm satisfied where
[1:30:31] I'm at cuz the Bible says to take the
[1:30:33] back
[1:30:35] seat
[1:30:36] right he said yeah but the Bible says
[1:30:39] the one that's giving you the orders
[1:30:40] that tells you to come to the front row
[1:30:42] I said okay I'll be there in a
[1:30:44] second see that's
[1:30:46] scripture when they ask you go don't go
[1:30:49] in well look at me I'm going I going set
[1:30:51] on front row cuz I'm topnotch now go to
[1:30:54] the back sit down then when the people
[1:30:56] that are there call you to the front
[1:30:59] they're the one that's honoring your
[1:31:03] ministry see that way you're not
[1:31:06] exalted you're happy about it
[1:31:10] promises made to the
[1:31:12] bride promise her to be the fullness of
[1:31:14] the godhead bodily promis her to raise
[1:31:16] the dead promis that she would do it
[1:31:20] that he would come among her and raise
[1:31:21] the dead and we go into
[1:31:23] Rapture promise the change of these
[1:31:27] bodies now let's take the
[1:31:34] last he promised that we'd be there with
[1:31:36] our
[1:31:42] offspring that stops most
[1:31:45] people you know what it stops them cuz
[1:31:49] they've never seen it made manifest
[1:31:57] right but I
[1:32:00] have well why can't I say I
[1:32:08] have are you saying that you're so you
[1:32:10] know and that's what one brother one
[1:32:12] time told he said you mean your kids are
[1:32:14] going to be saved they because they're
[1:32:15] your
[1:32:16] kids I said no
[1:32:19] way go be my kid that means they're
[1:32:24] lost but I said if I can
[1:32:27] believe all things are possible to them
[1:32:30] that
[1:32:34] believe the Bible says you'll be there
[1:32:36] with your
[1:32:37] Offspring has he ever spoke to you about
[1:32:40] that
[1:32:42] scripture he spoke to me about it and
[1:32:44] our way was he was out in the world I
[1:32:47] just I was it to me I never worried No
[1:32:50] More
[1:32:52] we have some grandkids great grandkids
[1:32:55] coming
[1:32:56] along you
[1:32:58] know I spoken for them well it doesn't
[1:33:01] look like they're coming that's your
[1:33:06] eyeballs you're not looking through mine
[1:33:08] so forget
[1:33:09] it well they going to be saved at the
[1:33:12] white thr
[1:33:13] judgment I don't accept that that's a
[1:33:18] secondary right that's an excuse for me
[1:33:21] not believing they can be there that's a
[1:33:23] secondary point that could
[1:33:27] happen I want them
[1:33:29] here with the eternal life that I
[1:33:32] have amen
[1:33:36] yes can you believe it
[1:33:39] amen sir did brother brandham talk to
[1:33:42] brother Dalton is that the one that
[1:33:44] stood right here and told it even the
[1:33:46] Jim Ed the ever which way you pronounce
[1:33:48] it the the old gentleman that brother
[1:33:50] ROM told all the his kids would be saved
[1:33:52] stood right here in his P pit and told
[1:33:54] us about
[1:33:58] it you know what they were
[1:34:02] abely but see here's where we want to
[1:34:06] go brother Brandon spoke to sister had R
[1:34:09] about her two
[1:34:11] kids and said I give you those two
[1:34:15] kids he said they fell down right there
[1:34:18] and received Jesus
[1:34:20] Christ
[1:34:22] you know what they told later that
[1:34:23] they'd went back in the world and back
[1:34:27] flipped well it just wasn't all together
[1:34:30] right start
[1:34:32] with now where did you get that
[1:34:36] idea well they back FID how many times
[1:34:39] have
[1:34:41] you solve the
[1:34:43] problem right how many times have you
[1:34:46] backslid w you lost every time you
[1:34:50] backslid we don't believe in being born
[1:34:52] again and then
[1:34:53] backsliding that's the Pentecostal idea
[1:34:56] cuz if you was born again and backslide
[1:34:58] it mean you go back to somewhere
[1:34:59] else and you can't lose the baptism of
[1:35:02] the Holy Ghost sister had his rights two
[1:35:05] kids and brother run spoke that that was
[1:35:08] it that's right they'll be there oh what
[1:35:11] a road they got to
[1:35:15] go because it was said but can we
[1:35:19] believe
[1:35:20] that
[1:35:24] I tell June I said every time I look at
[1:35:25] weight of
[1:35:26] life but you know what they come a day I
[1:35:29] had to look at her in
[1:35:34] life cuz you see maybe you don't let
[1:35:37] let's see if you can follow
[1:35:39] this see you say well that's just your
[1:35:41] children that's Wade Terren and
[1:35:45] Anna well now Wade and June are the
[1:35:48] same Terren and Lisa is the same
[1:35:52] man and Richards A
[1:35:54] Sign so whatever goes with one goes with
[1:35:57] the other one
