[0:00] that we're not worthy of anything

[0:06] you promised us and you've kept your
[0:09] word we love you and we thank you you
[0:11] brought your word unto us and now let
[0:14] your word do as it said said it would
[0:16] heal those that are sick among us and
[0:18] deliver the downhearted we love you and
[0:21] we thank you have your way forgive our
[0:23] sins bless wait in June and all the
[0:26] others era that are traveling back today
[0:28] coming back in home and just believe
[0:31] would be with each one we love you and
[0:32] we thank in Jesus name Amen
[0:38] John 1 in the beginning was the word and
[0:43] the Word was with God and the Word was
[0:46] God the same was in the beginning with
[0:48] God all things were made by him and
[0:52] without him was not anything made that
[0:53] was made
[0:55] in him was life and the life was the
[0:57] light of men and light shyness in
[1:00] darkness and the darkness comprehended
[1:02] it not
[1:04] there's no way for light and darkness to
[1:06] dwell it's the same place but now let's
[1:09] come back we'll be we're dealing with
[1:11] the Garden of Eden and coming down and
[1:13] then we're coming to our day in time of
[1:16] where we're living so let's go to 1st
[1:18] Corinthians 11 that would to God you
[1:23] would bear with me a little wild in my
[1:25] folly and indeed by with me Framm
[1:28] jealous over you with godly jealousy for
[1:30] I have a spouse you to one husband that
[1:33] I may present you as a chaste virgin to
[1:36] Christ but I fear now listen to what
[1:39] Paul way back garden when the church was
[1:43] on fire things were moving great things
[1:45] were taking place since but I fear lest
[1:48] by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve
[1:52] through his subtlety so your minds
[1:55] should be corrupted from the simplicity
[1:57] that is in Christ man and you may be
[2:01] seated the Lord at his blessing to the
[2:04] reading of the word and as I said back
[2:08] dark Paul was concerned
[2:13] about the point of satan being able to
[2:19] do the same thing that he done in the
[2:22] garden remember we've we've been talking
[2:26] about the Garden of Eden and what took
[2:27] place and situations in the garden and I
[2:30] and trying to talk about what was the
[2:34] original sin and we know that the
[2:38] original sin is unbelief all right now
[2:42] they act are the things that take place
[2:46] after that brings into manifestation
[2:50] what those things that you've done see
[2:54] in other words Eve had to receive with
[2:57] in her mind the thought or concept that
[3:02] the devil was speaking to her about and
[3:06] then that was the worst part of it
[3:08] that's what's at death she received that
[3:12] in her mind she begin to reason on the
[3:18] Word of God all right
[3:20] and that set death into the spiritual
[3:23] part thereof Eve and then it brought in
[3:29] later to Adam and him receiving also and
[3:34] knowing what he's doing he had he still
[3:36] done what he done and and all like that
[3:38] and it brought it on into his part and
[3:42] where was it dealing at in the reasoning
[3:46] factors and that's what Paul was
[3:48] concerned about that the church could be
[3:53] you know tempted and things like that as
[3:58] well as Eve was so you referred back to
[4:01] that you know the show that that Satan
[4:04] would still do it
[4:05] so whatever the original sin is it's
[4:07] still now all right it's still here okay
[4:13] so the original sin was to disbelieve
[4:16] God's work well so is it today now the
[4:20] things that took place
[4:24] as I say whether you want to call it
[4:25] eaten an apple or whatever you want to
[4:27] call it we've been through that and know
[4:29] for sure D what the word covers of what
[4:33] took place but yet still the point is
[4:36] what took place was a display of the
[4:41] unbelief that she had okay so being the
[4:45] unbelief first then sees then she just
[4:48] went on and done what she done to
[4:51] manifest the in the reality as we call
[4:55] it as we say well not drinking gambling
[4:58] smoking running around with women etc is
[5:00] not sin you said well we've been taught
[5:04] all of our life that that's in now sin
[5:06] it's unbelief you do those things
[5:09] because you're an unbeliever right I
[5:12] mean that's the reason you do is because
[5:16] you're an unbeliever it's not because of
[5:18] you being some way or point it's the
[5:21] fact that you're not a believer because
[5:23] believers don't do those times see then
[5:27] there's were we covered then that
[5:29] attributes we deal with attributes a lot
[5:35] what took place that's our major
[5:38] thoughts instead of considering what
[5:41] took place before whatever you want to
[5:46] think happen think all right that was
[5:51] the unbelief that was in to Eve and we
[5:55] know for a certainty that she was a
[5:58] special person back there in their
[6:00] beginning and creation and and she
[6:03] didn't have a life that she lived and
[6:05] was daily bombarded by Satan in a room
[6:10] like you and I from childhood and coming
[6:13] up you know and the point she didn't
[6:15] have a bunch of time to you know come to
[6:19] a point all right so Satan he got to Eve
[6:25] and he began to get her to doubt God's
[6:28] Word Satan through the Beast speaking to
[6:33] Eve he said you know can we eat of every
[6:37] tree in the car
[6:37] she become a good woman preacher and as
[6:39] we say she begin to explain to him the
[6:43] word he said well is that wrong one
[6:46] ain't nothing wrong with trying to
[6:48] explain the word if you know the whole
[6:50] story but if you try to explain how if
[6:53] the story you know I mean it is supposed
[6:58] to be of course everything now not
[7:00] running like it's supposed to be but it
[7:03] used to be you know that you couldn't be
[7:05] a witness in court unless you was an
[7:08] eyewitness of something you know hearsay
[7:11] wasn't supposed to be used
[7:13] now you just use anything they won't use
[7:15] you know do what they won't do with it
[7:18] and the person could have not even been
[7:21] standing there you you you see it on the
[7:23] TV
[7:23] I get so tickled at it and you know or
[7:26] something like that watching and seeing
[7:27] news thing and and they'll have a lady
[7:31] or something like that especially a good
[7:33] size hefty one that's got a loud voice
[7:36] and why they pick them kind out I'm not
[7:38] I'm just telling you what the truth is
[7:42] you get upset with me for speaking it
[7:45] but you know yourself it's what they do
[7:47] they get a good loud mouth woman to
[7:50] explain what happened and she wasn't
[7:53] even there she didn't get burned until
[7:58] the police came she didn't get there
[8:00] until her the the news media arrived and
[8:03] then they pick her out to explain it
[8:05] that's life I don't I don't get them
[8:08] okay forgive me you think I'd do this I
[8:11] don't know I just tell it like it is and
[8:15] then you know we life and say forget it
[8:18] all right but listen then Eve as I said
[8:26] she told Satan was speaking through the
[8:30] Beast
[8:31] you understand the Beast was not a snake
[8:35] I mean we read the Bible for that it was
[8:40] a beast
[8:40] all right then he was made a snake by
[8:44] the curse I mean that's Bible not upon
[8:48] that on the ground shalt thou go and
[8:50] dust
[8:50] be thy meat so he was first to beast he
[8:53] who had have been talking to a snake she
[8:56] were talking to a beast that's what
[8:58] Darwin couldn't find the missing link if
[9:01] he could just read the Bible he would
[9:02] have known what to oblige he would have
[9:05] found that beast that could talk reason
[9:08] speak to Eve something happened that
[9:11] Satan was using that to try to contact
[9:14] her and look how smart he was he you
[9:17] know he didn't jump right in
[9:19] he let her explain it we see that got to
[9:24] catching into her and got into her heart
[9:28] and beings of life of herself but he was
[9:32] explaining it I've been over and over
[9:34] with you you know he was explaining the
[9:37] truth she had been told to multiply and
[9:43] replenish the earth the beast wouldn't
[9:46] tell in her a lie
[9:48] the lie was how it would take place or
[9:51] when it would take place and what was
[9:53] gonna do she was made to be a mother she
[9:57] was made for that reason and the point
[10:00] all right and then she did Satan knew
[10:03] that he could not contact her in her
[10:05] physical body because you're not going
[10:09] to do that with a woman over the world
[10:11] on it it has to be first into the mind
[10:13] then end of the body okay all right make
[10:16] it short and sweet but he couldn't
[10:19] conduct her in that and he couldn't
[10:21] contact her in her soul because that was
[10:24] pure and she was part of the Genesis
[10:27] 1:26 our place within her just like Adam
[10:32] all right so then there was only one
[10:35] place left and that was her spirit part
[10:38] of her that would cover the memory
[10:42] reason conscience affections and stuff
[10:44] like that because see that's what the
[10:47] world that we live in really this body
[10:50] has worked nothing the Bible says it's
[10:52] dead without the spirit to motivate it
[10:54] it can't do anything it doesn't you
[10:58] don't even remember anything the brain
[11:00] working but yet it's got to be a spirit
[11:02] control
[11:03] doing that to make it to where you can
[11:05] think on those things all right not a
[11:08] doctor or a scientist just plain common
[11:10] sense or talking about life and where we
[11:13] live okay so in her reasonings and
[11:16] things she began to accept that well
[11:20] that was what I was made for I was made
[11:25] to be a mother and this beast is
[11:29] explaining what Adam wouldn't explain
[11:33] but see it wasn't time for Adam to
[11:36] explain it and that was the problem she
[11:38] got ahead and that's what everybody
[11:40] wants to do now they want to have they
[11:42] won't have the great knowledge or
[11:44] something this is the age in time of
[11:46] knowledge in the natural and the
[11:49] spiritual all right why do you think
[11:52] you've got about four or five thousand
[11:54] different denominations is because of
[11:59] knowledge while you got two or three
[12:01] thousand different denominations in this
[12:03] message because of knowledge everybody's
[12:08] wanting knowledge instead of this being
[12:11] simple and plain and look at what we are
[12:17] that's the point I'm trying to get in
[12:19] whatever took place in the garden is
[12:23] still taking place now what Satan is
[12:27] still right now talking to you right
[12:33] okay
[12:35] I'm not a mind-reader and neither of I'm
[12:37] a prophet but how many of you in your
[12:39] mind right now I was thinking what in
[12:41] the world is he saying
[12:43] how many are you thinking well he could
[12:45] have said it a better way he could have
[12:47] done it this way he could do that away I
[12:49] mean none of your brain is cut off while
[12:52] I talk right
[12:53] I mean well now you go to sleep but
[12:56] still remember you can learn languages
[12:59] while you sleep so they must be part of
[13:01] that still working right you're getting
[13:04] my point
[13:05] the point is plain language Satan's
[13:08] doing the same thing right now
[13:11] that he was in the garden he's saying to
[13:15] you well there's a better way of doing
[13:17] this there's a different way of
[13:20] explaining it I'll explain it this way I
[13:22] don't know that's alright but you're not
[13:24] in here aren't you supposed to go to cut
[13:26] your computer off you know huh
[13:30] you ain't supposed to be calculating
[13:32] what should have been done or oh it'll
[13:33] be done or it could be done you're
[13:36] supposed to be listening to what is done
[13:37] because that's what causes people to do
[13:40] it that causes people to go off in their
[13:43] own ideas and thoughts we're gonna get
[13:46] on with this afternoon we're going to
[13:48] start a little simple thoughts about
[13:50] salvation salvation I want to make it as
[13:57] simple as we can ever even think about
[14:00] go through the Old Testament with it and
[14:03] show that they had a salvation to prove
[14:08] they had a salvation they had a place to
[14:11] go to when they died no Cole paradise
[14:16] bosom of Abraham now but getting to what
[14:21] we're talking about now the reasoning
[14:28] factor is the situation that exists in
[14:32] all of us and that is were Satan through
[14:36] his subtility as Paul said and it's over
[14:40] in Genesis that the beast was the most
[14:45] subtly like I said he wouldn't a
[14:48] wouldn't an add a snake he was a beast
[14:52] then he was made of snake read your
[14:54] Bible plain language crawled on the
[14:58] belly all right now that reasoning
[15:02] factor though said into the mind of Eve
[15:04] and what did it start doing you know the
[15:10] message you need to read it study it
[15:12] listen to it or the greatest battle ever
[15:14] fought in that message the Prophet is
[15:18] explaining the things that took place in
[15:21] the garden you know all right
[15:24] now in doing that he's explaining
[15:29] what happens as we try to reason and see
[15:35] what happened to Eve Satan through his
[15:38] subtility stopped up the flues of her
[15:43] thinking put her to a point of thinking
[15:49] of what she should be doing instead of
[15:53] just relaxing and enjoying and have a
[15:55] good time in the garden there's nowt to
[15:58] get up cook breakfast they didn't out to
[16:00] do the washing the thing you know them
[16:02] dirty words that people don't like you
[16:03] know work wash ooh you know they're not
[16:07] to do any of those things right in
[16:12] Jordan but instead of that really I
[16:15] guess the truth was she had too much
[16:17] time there's a brother in the message he
[16:21] was telling me one time you know how
[16:23] much how many times he had preached that
[16:25] week and and many times he had had
[16:28] traveled and and everything like that
[16:30] and I said you need a job and he said a
[16:34] job yeah you had too much time he said I
[16:37] preached so many times and I've traveled
[16:39] so many miles and they he didn't work
[16:43] you know and I said well I preached more
[16:46] services in you this week and I traveled
[16:48] more miles than you travel this week and
[16:50] I worked at General Motors which costed
[16:53] me at that time 12 hours a day traveling
[16:55] back and forth I said what you need
[16:57] isn't a job you got too much time I
[17:02] don't mind is what do we call it Devil's
[17:06] waa workshop right that's where we think
[17:10] well you know to the mind and the mind
[17:13] is not the soul of mankind it's the
[17:16] spirit of mankind because that's worth
[17:19] it the animal doesn't have that the
[17:21] animal has a spirit and he can reason to
[17:24] a certain degree in memory to a certain
[17:28] degree but he's not like a human being
[17:30] he can't think things out if he could
[17:35] he'd save him a lot of trouble but he
[17:37] builds his nest the same way he does
[17:39] everything the same has he done 6,000
[17:42] years
[17:43] ago he just he has to adapt to time yeah
[17:47] you know but he doesn't learn to reason
[17:51] that's not the point
[17:52] yeah all right but the point I'm trying
[17:54] to get you see is when God had told Eve
[17:58] and Adam in Genesis 1:28 before they
[18:03] were put into human flesh in 2:7 read
[18:07] your Bible go read it he told him to
[18:10] multiply and replenish the earth
[18:13] what's the eve knew that she knew that
[18:18] she was to do that but she didn't know
[18:22] when she probably had some concepts by
[18:26] looking around at life and the animals
[18:29] and things she had some concepts of
[18:31] things she wasn't just a dummy you know
[18:36] yet cause he had a concept but yet she
[18:39] had no way to understand how that would
[18:41] take blood because Adam had not
[18:48] explained it to her but if she did she
[18:53] begin to think about you know God
[18:57] promised that God promised that that's a
[19:02] promise in God's Word to multiply and
[19:04] replenish there wasn't anything wrong
[19:09] with the way of doing it it was the way
[19:12] it was done because God told her to do
[19:18] that it was an oncoming promise the
[19:21] Prophet said spoken words reading on
[19:23] city also said Eve would have have
[19:26] brought forth that child you know what
[19:30] he says in the spoken words original
[19:31] seed that he Isaiah sure to come through
[19:34] the wound of Eve
[19:37] now that's getting pretty strong and he
[19:41] said well no this no no no no no you're
[19:43] doing it in your underwear you just do
[19:45] what you want to I'm just preaching but
[19:52] when God told them
[19:55] to do that get the point she remembered
[20:00] that and when the beasts begin to tell
[20:04] her what was she was made for and
[20:07] they're trying to keep this from you boy
[20:10] that's the worst thing in the world to
[20:12] tell I'm not I'm gonna say it right
[20:14] that's the worst case in the world to
[20:17] tell anybody not just women I don't beat
[20:22] on women to say the women they are a
[20:24] thousand times easier to see and saw
[20:28] them on order know better because he had
[20:29] a thousand oh but the point I'm getting
[20:33] that you tell people I got something
[20:39] right here oh I'm taking a little bit
[20:41] well they ain't heard anything what
[20:43] you're doing do you get to what you got
[20:44] right here right and the worst thing in
[20:49] the world a lot of times you walk up to
[20:52] somebody and say I won't do it me I'll
[20:55] do her brother Kali cuz I trust him with
[20:57] I walk up to him I say brother Kali are
[20:59] you sick no I said well you're looking a
[21:04] little pale well they're not I forget it
[21:09] forget it
[21:10] go on forget it about 30 minutes later
[21:15] he's going to quit care right he made
[21:20] himself sick over what you say it so
[21:25] then the worst thing in the world I
[21:27] don't mean it wrong to garden he knows
[21:30] was for God to withhold from Eve what
[21:36] she was going to be now God forgive me
[21:39] for that statement appointed I believe
[21:41] he understands God he knew that if he
[21:44] withheld that that was was gonna be the
[21:46] problem
[21:46] it was gonna be that way okay by not
[21:49] telling her the whole story
[21:52] he's what made her do the things she
[21:55] done I'm trying to just keep it down
[21:58] right now the world we're at and see
[22:03] that the same devil is right here now
[22:08] reasoning with us about everything that
[22:11] he was back to her so don't look at it
[22:15] as a different scale of situation look
[22:18] at it of the fact let's see if Eve knew
[22:24] and we know the Bible said to her that
[22:27] she was to one day fulfill the promise
[22:30] of God and myself was the devil that's
[22:33] what I've tried to get you to see I've
[22:35] tried to be simple with you
[22:36] you know the preachers wants to make it
[22:39] a great thing a great mystery that you
[22:41] can't understand
[22:42] I thought the Christ was hidden and
[22:49] revealed in simplicity you know what
[22:52] I'll make it as simple as I can you know
[22:54] what pizza is - deep deep of what he's
[22:59] he nothing deep about what we've just
[23:00] been talking about is it not this sense
[23:05] about what we've been talking about this
[23:06] morning
[23:07] now what something deep about that I'm
[23:10] not trying to hide nothing I'm just
[23:13] trying to tell you the same devil was
[23:16] back dark is the same devil right now
[23:18] talking to you and to me cuz you know
[23:23] what he's telling me in people don't
[23:24] only hear that why don't you shut up go
[23:25] on cut it off gonna quit got company
[23:29] don't bring this right directly yeah
[23:31] he's in my mind is rolling it real good
[23:35] but I tried my best to get him out of
[23:37] there and sometime you know it helps a
[23:39] little but still okay we're just human
[23:42] okay Eve couldn't wait for God to
[23:48] fulfill his word why are they so many
[23:51] different churches in the world off of
[23:54] one Bible well I'm not talking about
[24:01] there I'm preaching here why is there so
[24:04] many different versions of this message
[24:06] of one message
[24:15] has to be the reasoning factors of
[24:17] mankind and that reasoning factor C is
[24:23] the most powerful element there is the
[24:27] Bible says the imagination of man's mind
[24:29] is continually evil do you realize where
[24:32] we have been you realize that when I was
[24:36] seven years old I was plowing a mule out
[24:38] in the field I swear you people overseas
[24:42] I hope they catch this and listening
[24:44] some of this hearing
[24:47] I've been two or three places you go
[24:50] there and you just listen to them and
[24:52] they're thinking oh we went to Jamaica
[24:54] one time and and they believe money
[24:56] grows on trees you know one of them says
[25:02] don't you have a green card I'm excuse
[25:06] me a gold card so don't you have a gold
[25:08] card I mean I was out in the in a market
[25:12] there in talking with people and and he
[25:16] said come here said don't you have a
[25:17] gold card I've got one it's got the name
[25:23] gold on it and then it's gold colored I
[25:27] said what do you mean he said I told you
[25:32] he's telling it up I told you they had
[25:33] gold cards he thought I had a 24 karat
[25:37] gold card and I carried around in my
[25:39] pocket I guess go see they just can't
[25:42] comprehend what it's like to show you
[25:48] one thing brother Brady you remember him
[25:50] he'd come over here and he'd been over
[25:52] here and in in the summertime sometime
[25:54] anything that's normal here got in
[25:57] Jamaica you know they don't have a lot
[25:58] of seasons and in it I mean it just
[26:00] stays warm out huh and stuff grows out
[26:03] here and he came back in the wintertime
[26:06] when all the leaves was gone and he was
[26:08] kind of out of it till he seemed not
[26:10] coming into to Ruth and when he did he
[26:13] looks and there's no ladies on the trees
[26:17] he's into brother hey what happened
[26:20] I've come to fire burnt the leaves off
[26:23] the trees and didn't burn the houses
[26:27] because they don't have shed and leaves
[26:29] they stay green all year round you say
[26:33] well that seal it no it's not silly when
[26:36] you brought up under an atmosphere and
[26:38] the things and and motivated by that see
[26:45] that's the way we are religiously you
[26:49] tell me so it didn't bother me back
[26:52] there when when I was in denomination I
[26:54] come out of it I got rid of that and it
[26:57] didn't bother me first statement I made
[27:00] in church in Gainesville Georgia I said
[27:04] God got me out of the denomination now I
[27:07] want him to get this denomination out of
[27:09] me because see we're born and raised at
[27:14] away alright
[27:17] we're born and raised with them things
[27:20] in us you could say we don't believe in
[27:23] the Trinity and that old demon II still
[27:25] right there they're trying to deceive
[27:27] you they're just slicker than the others
[27:30] and they're trying to deceive you
[27:31] because it really is three college you
[27:33] know I mean you explain Father Son Holy
[27:35] Ghost
[27:36] you understand the devil is still here
[27:41] to doing today what he's always done
[27:43] that's got into the man in his mind and
[27:46] and perverted him even born-again
[27:51] Christians remember Paul was not riding
[27:55] to lost people Paul was writing to
[27:58] Christians in Corinthians the Bible is
[28:02] not written to the sinner
[28:04] it's written to them that are in Christ
[28:06] Jesus
[28:10] well who you ins not read the sinner can
[28:13] read it yeah but it's not to him and
[28:17] Paul was telling the Christians Satan is
[28:22] coming he told them later that they
[28:25] would be false prophets and things come
[28:28] and deceive many and look what happened
[28:33] down to the dark ages and time till they
[28:38] come out of it there is no such thing
[28:41] Trinity taught in the Bible then they
[28:44] come out of it in a dark age and started
[28:46] teaching the Trinity and got the people
[28:48] deceived today with that Trinity the
[28:55] lady said one time sin said Sam don't
[28:57] believe in the Holy Trinity no I don't
[29:01] believe in the Holy Trinity code ain't
[29:02] no trend he said father son Holy Ghost
[29:07] that's not a Trinity I'm a father I'm a
[29:09] sudden I'm a human and my three people
[29:13] know I'm three different manifestation
[29:16] yeah
[29:17] we believe in many manifestations of God
[29:19] you got seven compound names the Old
[29:22] Testament Jehovah Jireh G over a four
[29:24] job with this canoe coming through the
[29:26] Old Testament but each one of them is
[29:27] expressing something about God for the
[29:29] time but none of them is the different
[29:31] from the other as a different God the
[29:35] Bible says there's one Lord the Ten
[29:38] Commandment starts out with what what is
[29:41] the first I believe I don't know other
[29:43] gods before me but yet we've been taught
[29:47] all of our lives these things until we
[29:49] believe it but Satan has to clean that
[29:55] out he didn't have to it took him a
[29:58] while to pervert even her thinking with
[30:02] you and I were born the wrong thinking
[30:09] that's the way we was born
[30:12] the Bible says were born in sin shapen
[30:15] in iniquity spouts my mother's wound a
[30:17] liar you don't like to think about it
[30:21] because look at the baby there and it's
[30:22] just born and you'll get into the lose
[30:24] the baby lives long enough he's gonna be
[30:27] a liar he's oh no not my baby
[30:31] let me get about two years old and I'm
[30:32] cooking when I and smeared all over his
[30:34] face and you asked it said you need to
[30:36] cook it uh-huh
[30:39] but it's all over them but you see we've
[30:44] been taught all of our lives certain
[30:46] things you explained to me as the people
[30:50] down on the other side of the earth
[30:51] hanging upside down
[30:54] well you're crazy emma is that one of
[30:59] their eyeballs go get Nina you're silly
[31:04] no plain language we're hanging in space
[31:13] this world stopped and everything gopher
[31:17] those are spinning of it creates the
[31:19] gravity something huh
[31:21] listen Church you said what are you
[31:23] trying to get at I'm trying to get it
[31:24] one time in the deception of Eve she was
[31:32] anointed you remember that in the last
[31:35] part we was striking it right in the end
[31:41] of the message
[31:42] she was anointed anointed in her spirit
[31:55] the devil anointed her in her spirit not
[31:59] her body not her soul but in her spirit
[32:06] that's what he's doing right now if
[32:08] you're born again Christian Satan cannot
[32:11] get into your soul it's sealed your seal
[32:14] day and he's sealed out it doesn't
[32:17] matter if he gets in this body what good
[32:18] is the body you'll find out the older
[32:24] you get they don't remember you don't
[32:26] have to worry about memory because you
[32:27] can't remember what she did do you try
[32:32] might try to say it well the best part
[32:33] of memory be the future maybe I can
[32:35] remember something one night away you
[32:37] understand it just comes out to the
[32:41] point listen Eve was anointed with
[32:49] Satan's of 19 and you tell me the
[32:52] difference in Satan's anointing and
[32:53] God's anointing
[32:59] come on we can call the prophets messy
[33:01] dry did the Prophet say Satan can pass
[33:04] out supernatural gifts do you want that
[33:08] one what that brothers got gifts he's
[33:11] done this idea he can he can pass out
[33:17] Satan can pass out supernatural gifts

[33:23] anointing oh I know I know the anointing
[33:27] of God and I know that I know the voice
[33:30] of God

[36:46] killing his own son just as he gets
[36:51] ready to cut his throat
[36:52] the angel the Lord stops him and says
[36:55] God says now Abraham I know you love me
[36:59] because you wouldn't hold withhold your
[37:01] only son from me we think of God as
[37:04] being so soft and sweet and dodi like a
[37:09] dirty old granddaddy you know
[37:15] but listen he's trying you and me to see
[37:21] if we'll stay with the word was that the
[37:23] life statements we might what does it
[37:28] say over there Deuteronomy he said if a
[37:32] prophet comes among you and gives a sign
[37:35] and all like that and it comes to pass
[37:38] we said if he leads you to another God
[37:43] don't listen to him now how are you
[37:46] gonna tell which ones which it gives you
[37:52] a sign and it comes to Pius now how are
[37:54] you gonna tell which ones with that's
[37:57] about new to running me 23 somewhere
[37:59] right in there read it but roll out what

[38:11] among you to try you to see if you will
[38:16] love me read it
[38:18] same thing of Abraham to see if you'll
[38:21] stay with my word and see if you love me

[38:25] something through but think about it but
[38:31] God God is not like that God is good we
[38:40] sing the song God is good god is good
[38:42] yeah
[38:44] yes he's also straight he stays with his
[38:54] word do you think you would go out and
[38:59] offer your child up to God now don't
[39:02] worry about it we got the words of the
[39:04] Prophet he done it one time he ain't
[39:06] gonna do it again so you come along tell
[39:08] me that will what God told me to go
[39:10] offer up my sacrifice my son I'm gonna
[39:12] tell you forget it that ain't God oh who
[39:15] are you
[39:16] I've had a lot of people to tell me God
[39:18] told them and I just to do
[39:21] tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu you know what I mean I
[39:26] just kind of get away
[39:29] cuz I don't and say he didn't tell you
[39:31] that well you've told me that will your
[39:39] prize for me to tell you it was most of
[39:42] the time I just want go out and leave it
[39:45] and forget it cuz you're gonna believe
[39:48] what you want to believe like I was
[39:57] trying to explain the other day see
[39:58] people who say we had a prophet I
[40:00] believe what he says but when anybody
[40:03] else tells you what the prophets saying
[40:05] why don't you believe that what winded
[40:12] works change you understand I mean the
[40:21] Bible said in Deuteronomy take you to
[40:22] another God what's taking you to another
[40:24] God taking you to your own ideas your
[40:29] thoughts or anything contrary to God the
[40:34] brother Dale he's just arrogant hateful
[40:36] he just here well good at least I'll
[40:40] quote the Prophet back to you if I'm
[40:42] arrogant hateful to you you'll realize
[40:44] that I'm not trying to pull something
[40:45] over on you
[40:48] that's a quote if you want I'm trying to
[40:52] get you to realize and to believe what
[40:55] the Bible says we'll get to it this
[40:57] evening
[40:57] what is salvation based upon I spoke in
[41:01] tongues I cried I done this edit there's
[41:03] none of that can you put it on that it's
[41:12] put on one time whether you can believe
[41:15] God's Word or not not on any of those
[41:20] basis of what we've all been taught that
[41:22] it was I'm talking my Old Testament
[41:27] salvation surely won't get in the new
[41:30] listen Eve was anointed in her
[41:38] understanding
[41:41] in her spirit realm a reason memory
[41:46] conscious and things she was anointed of
[41:52] Satan to believe God's Word just had one
[42:01] little twist to write everything to be
[42:09] said to Eve was right that's what I've
[42:12] tried to get you to get away from that
[42:14] old the devil he said the devil he
[42:17] talked Eve right down the line and when
[42:20] it come down to the end of the line they
[42:22] wouldn't but one time he said you were
[42:28] made for that reason and she said okay
[42:36] we read it as there's one lie I like
[42:44] where the Bible says you know that did
[42:46] believe a lie be damned you know what
[42:47] the Prophet said that was he said it
[42:49] same lie that Satan told Eve the same
[42:55] lie is still being told today you know
[42:59] what it's being told today you are to be
[43:02] the Bride of Christ that's true he's not
[43:10] telling you you to you're the devil's
[43:12] children he's not telling anybody that
[43:15] I'm kind of weirdos has gone freaks
[43:18] that's not human beings that even
[43:20] wouldn't think that what Satan is
[43:22] Chinese best to tell us who we are by
[43:27] the word
[43:32] like I said ending up what we were
[43:34] talking about he said the bride is to
[43:37] prove to Satan that we won't fall for
[43:39] that lie what lie bring it down to the
[43:46] day what's the light of day now listen
[43:49] we say we're the children of God were
[43:53] the people of God we believe the message
[43:56] we write into everything oh you sound
[44:00] weird when you preach but is it the
[44:05] truth okay if it's the truth what have
[44:10] we got to be any problem you said yeah
[44:14] but you said that the devil is trying
[44:16] he's trying to expand to tell the people
[44:17] this message they're the bride of Jesus
[44:19] Christ and then the brain fourth Christ
[44:26] but that's the same thing Eve was told
[44:30] and the same things happening as it did
[44:34] to Eve back there because I'm still in
[44:39] what the prophets said ain't D
[44:42] Christianizing nobody and saying anybody
[44:45] this out of the others lost that's
[44:47] between you and God
[44:51] the Paul was telling the Church of
[44:54] born-again believers be careful you can
[44:57] be deceived Oh see we've got that we
[45:01] know the quote oh we can't be deceived
[45:07] we're pointing in Christians we can't be
[45:11] deceived tell me what happened to the
[45:14] church down through the dark ages
[45:20] did your prophet spoken words original
[45:22] seed set like this he said Adams Bryan
[45:27] failed before bringing forth
[45:30] he said jehovah's bride of the Old
[45:33] Testament failed before producing
[45:37] correctly he said the bride of Jesus
[45:39] Christ fell before if you don't believe
[45:45] in it being the father
[45:46] what are you dealing with restoration I
[45:52] will restore the years of the can corn
[45:54] problem bruh if you didn't follow what
[45:56] do you need to restore see the deception
[46:01] that's what I've tried to get you to see
[46:03] where you can see it correctly the
[46:05] deception is in the spirit of mankind
[46:08] through the memory reason conscious
[46:10] affections and things that's the way he
[46:15] took the church off and had juice the
[46:20] other : you were run around City even
[46:21] under the baptism of the holy ghost they
[46:24] twisted it not the baptism of the Holy
[46:28] Ghost didn't do it they twisted it they
[46:36] wasn't supposed to go to Nasia they went
[46:40] and they come out of there without it
[46:42] little back of one egg just one mean one
[46:45] of the word and when they did the first
[46:48] thing you know they brought a trinity
[46:51] and to be who brought that old him false
[46:58] vine see that's the way people when it
[47:00] when they get put against the wall you
[47:03] want to come out with a concept it was
[47:06] the false vine that failed well what do
[47:09] you tell about restoration you're trying
[47:12] to restore the false fine oh I didn't
[47:17] think of it like a
[47:24] you see church that's what some could us
[47:25] here 50 years after the prophets gone
[47:27] the people's not believing the word not
[47:33] accepting the word and staying right
[47:35] with that word and said forget it right
[47:40] in the devil's trap of anointing and if
[47:46] you know what it is the genuine
[47:48] anointing come on get the message
[47:55] anointed ones and read it genuine
[48:01] anointing and see if you don't
[48:04] understand the message correctly how you
[48:05] going to understand a19 how are you
[48:10] gonna understand Matthew 24:24 they said
[48:15] in the last days they would be false
[48:17] Christ how are you going to understand
[48:26] even the simple plan of salvation of the
[48:29] new birth where is it at does it take
[48:32] place in your body does it take place in
[48:34] your spirit or take place in your soul
[48:39] where does it take place well I just
[48:43] accept the Jesus Christ the male quote
[48:49] the Prophet as Jesus Christ accepted you
[48:56] well yeah well what happened I shouted a
[49:00] crowd of religion the quickest way the
[49:06] best way for you to understand the new
[49:08] birth to see whether you got it or not
[49:09] is to remember the 1:9 it's whether the
[49:15] Spirit of the Guardian you agrees with
[49:16] the word
[49:17] right is that the evidence of the Holy
[49:20] Ghost whether the Spirit of God in you
[49:22] agrees with the word now listen agrees
[49:24] means continual he didn't say the
[49:27] Prophet didn't say whether or not the
[49:28] Holy Spirit agreed with the word
[49:31] it's whether he agrees with the word if
[49:35] it ever stops it's not the new birth if
[49:40] it leads into a two so seven Thunder
[49:42] parousia doctrines of the message it's
[49:44] not the new birth it's the devil coming
[49:52] among you to try you and God permitting
[49:55] it to take place yes but you sound like
[50:01] that my god my god I know my God my God
[50:03] is love you just ain't been around long
[50:12] enough yet yes but it would but my god
[50:17] love and sweet and humble yeah and would
[50:26] stand back in the Old Testament and
[50:30] order the destruction of an entire
[50:33] nation and emphasize the killing them of
[50:39] the men women and the children ever
[50:44] amirite ever more by the river one yes
[50:50] but but we're the New Testament I bet
[50:57] you them first so you didn't think too
[50:58] much of Jesus when they thought you
[51:01] saying your God he turned around and
[51:05] looked at him he said you are of your
[51:07] father the devil and his works you will
[51:11] do they didn't like the head I'll bet
[51:15] you they didn't think he's too sweet on
[51:18] that okay listen
[51:26] so we know for a certainty then what
[51:31] happened in the garden was beginning to
[51:35] reason upon God's Word and if she did it
[51:42] prover lead the way that it would come
[51:46] so all it takes is one word now we're
[51:56] going to rehash a little Sunday's
[51:58] message which I've been doing this for
[52:00] 40 years so it ain't no problem you talk
[52:05] to the ministers of this message and
[52:07] they just use brother branham's message
[52:08] anywhere they want to use it anyway they
[52:11] hunt a quote off the computer and it's
[52:14] the most damaging thing that has ever
[52:16] been I'll say that I got one to two and
[52:20] a half on the study and they will tell
[52:22] him anymore I got three or four of them
[52:24] but it's the most damaging thing they
[52:26] could ever be to a new born-again a but
[52:30] again Christian that doesn't have
[52:32] training to listen to the word because
[52:35] you can make bread around say anything
[52:37] you want to right what's the thank God
[52:46] for it you know why I used to make a
[52:49] statement and people say where did
[52:50] brother on say that I spent three months
[52:53] three months trying to find that
[52:58] statement and sometimes six months I
[53:02] remember one one brother said something
[53:04] one time and I said that ain't true
[53:07] well you shorted I said okay I'll find
[53:10] it it took me almost six months but one
[53:14] day I walked up and laid it in front
[53:15] anything you see we had a lot of
[53:18] concordances and here's mine I wrote
[53:24] down a lot of things in my Bible as I
[53:26] come along to her that I could pull it
[53:29] up in a hurry and follow that and I
[53:34] reference from this scripture here back
[53:38] over to this scripture
[53:40] here were that I can have it in my
[53:42] memories and times yeah why because
[53:48] we're supposed to believe what the
[53:49] Prophet says yeah but I got a quote well
[53:54] what does it say you know the quote the
[54:02] Prophet said write what you going down
[54:11] go to hell and he said you do likewise
[54:13] you want to read it any creature you
[54:15] want to write any quotes you want to
[54:17] read in this message I've put the
[54:21] challenge out 40 years ago on that is
[54:23] anything if you want to say I'll give
[54:25] you within this the memory a quote that
[54:28] seems totally contrary I had one message
[54:32] you give me a quote from the scriptures
[54:35] I can give you scriptures that seem
[54:37] contrary I have one Bible like a sinner
[54:49] talking to man on the phone he called me
[54:50] and said something I said we'll give me
[54:52] a minute let me look it up I don't
[54:55] matter code I don't know whether you
[54:56] looked upright or not in other words
[54:57] didn't matter he didn't make no
[55:03] difference because he wouldn't gonna
[55:05] listen to what was said okay I tried to
[55:11] explain in how for like 40 years because
[55:14] I asked you a simple question how can
[55:18] you understand the new birth in work
[55:20] takes place and what it is how can you
[55:24] understand it is it in your bodies and
[55:28] your spirit is in yourself but I can
[55:31] read you a quote in the early part of
[55:33] brother runs ministry that the new birth
[55:34] is in the spirit then I can read you in
[55:39] the lighter ministry where it's in their
[55:40] soul would see them that's what gives me
[55:44] you explain Mathew 24:24 I got brother
[55:52] Brian laying right here where he said
[55:54] explain Matthew 24:24 without
[55:56] understanding or no one he'd once were
[56:03] that it would be false Christ anointed
[56:08] ones anointed with the genuine Holy
[56:12] Spirit and still be loved but if I have
[56:20] the Holy Spirit I'll say I'm going to
[56:21] heaven I got to quote lay in here where
[56:24] the Prophet said don't you say those
[56:25] times Wow because if that anointing is
[56:31] on your spirit you're not born again
[56:38] draw out three little rims you go home
[56:40] and you write body spirit and soul
[56:44] outside is see taste feel smell in here
[56:47] you just contact the world with that
[56:49] inside of that is memory reason concert
[56:52] etc in the second room because the
[56:55] center only has one sense and I see the
[56:57] faith or doubt you're either born again
[57:00] or you're lost right okay
[57:05] now you're either born again are you
[57:07] lost all right so how are you going to
[57:12] understand when the Prophet would say
[57:16] you can have the genuine baptism of the
[57:20] Holy Spirit on your spirit and still be
[57:26] lost and die and go to hell
[57:36] and for 40 years I've tried to explain
[57:38] it to prophet in his early ministry he
[57:44] would interchange the word soul and
[57:46] spirit because the Bible interchanges
[57:48] the soul and spirit read your Bible
[57:51] it'll-it'll change the word and give you
[57:53] one basic meaning for it and it'll
[57:55] interchange it you've got to find out
[57:58] what it's talking about to put it in the
[58:00] right order
[58:02] you remember Caiaphas the high priests
[58:11] prophesy that it was necessary that one
[58:15] die for the sins of the people then for
[58:18] all of them are the problems of the
[58:19] people cause to see they were trying to
[58:21] get rid of him because he don't call it
[58:22] an insurrection and he said it and he
[58:25] quoted the scripture why because it was
[58:29] the anointing on Caiaphas cause he was
[58:32] the high priest under you way of saying
[58:41] things I don't I don't even see how
[58:42] anybody can be saved
[58:43] I don't either I was honest and truthful
[58:46] as I can be I don't need it it isn't it
[58:49] has that has got to be a very act of
[58:52] Almighty God
[58:55] I've never tried to prove whether I
[58:57] saved or lost ain't got him to do it
[59:00] it's whether the word is true or not
[59:07] seeing brother Browns early ministry he
[59:09] would freak and he would bring and he
[59:11] would rat the three realms he would draw
[59:13] him out I'll pick him up this evening
[59:16] because we don't have time now and he
[59:18] would draw out and he put body then he'd
[59:21] put soul and he put spirit and he give
[59:29] the outside man five senses sea-chest
[59:31] feel familiar he give the second rim
[59:33] memory reason conscious affection here
[59:35] the center rim faith or doubt after the
[59:38] opening of the seals the word Hebrews
[59:40] for let a 4-12 become sharper to divide
[59:43] between soul and spirit joints and
[59:45] marrow
[59:46] he taught body
[59:49] spirit and soul you say well how do we
[59:55] need to know that tell me where you're
[59:58] born again Anna tell me where you're
[1:00:03] born again out are you born again in
[1:00:09] your body are you born again your spirit
[1:00:10] are you born again in your soul which
[1:00:12] one we can take the early part of the
[1:00:18] ministry to prove that you're born again
[1:00:20] in your spirit and it's your soul has
[1:00:23] memory reason conscious affections take
[1:00:26] the later part of the Ministry of the
[1:00:27] Prophet and prove under the anointing of
[1:00:31] the anointed ones remember he never
[1:00:34] preached the anointed ones until after
[1:00:38] it was revealed to him that it was body
[1:00:43] spirit and soul to be correct studies
[1:00:49] the message and see in his later
[1:00:55] ministry how would you understand
[1:00:57] Matthew 24:24 that they be false Christ
[1:01:00] a genuine Holy Spirit to anoint the
[1:01:03] people the Holy Spirit being on your
[1:01:11] spirit explain how to say this part and
[1:01:17] we explained the new birth
[1:01:27] according to Ezekiel 36 right in there
[1:01:30] he said I'll give you a new heart a new
[1:01:32] spirit but then he says and I'll put my
[1:01:38] spirit in you now where's that out do
[1:01:48] you know you're saved I sounded that
[1:01:54] crowd at spoke and telling us all these
[1:01:56] thing I pray I fast I do everything in
[1:01:59] the Bible but Ron says you say you pray
[1:02:03] he said the outshine us you
[1:02:09] know what you don't dare go up to the
[1:02:12] White House that's a bunch of Christians
[1:02:14] and get down and pray but let the
[1:02:18] Muhammadans and then I'm not against
[1:02:19] anybody whatsoever they're human beings
[1:02:22] a right to live and right to the Tree of
[1:02:25] Life
[1:02:25] would you let them go to the White House
[1:02:27] and get down and pray and nobody ain't
[1:02:30] gonna stop them they are more sincere
[1:02:33] than we are right Islamic teachings and
[1:02:39] the fasting one month out of the year
[1:02:41] that run every year you got to do this
[1:02:45] you got to do that and you're supposed
[1:02:47] to make at least one trip to Mecca in
[1:02:51] your life to ensure you a better world
[1:02:55] and they do everything they can to get
[1:02:58] to higher you want to go with sincerity
[1:03:06] sincerity you wanna go into sincerity
[1:03:10] woman take a baby throw it to an
[1:03:13] alligator to preach to try to appease a
[1:03:14] God you want try that you want to get
[1:03:19] into some things that are in the Bible
[1:03:22] what about the man that needed help from
[1:03:25] these 12 parts of the tribes
[1:03:32] you remember your Bible what did he do
[1:03:36] he took his wife and cut her in 12
[1:03:39] pieces and sent one piece to each tribe
[1:03:45] you want sincerity you better have
[1:03:51] something besides your sincerity you
[1:03:54] better have something besides just your
[1:03:56] reasoning factors to be able to
[1:03:59] comprehend the brother they'll have
[1:04:05] always believed our sage until he heard
[1:04:07] you preach okay
[1:04:09] praise God I've done my job now you do
[1:04:12] something about it
[1:04:14] right now you do something about it get
[1:04:18] something that you can anchor we'll get
[1:04:23] something you know it's you're satisfied
[1:04:24] with you know your prophet said you came
[1:04:29] how the Holy Ghost not having an
[1:04:30] experience we got one here you want to
[1:04:33] read it where he said don't you say that
[1:04:36] you've got an experience means you're
[1:04:37] saved he's writing both places right
[1:04:43] well because experience is just
[1:04:45] something you live through or not II of
[1:04:46] thought or idea concept of mankind but
[1:04:49] their true born-again Christian an
[1:04:51] experience is a change of the nature
[1:05:01] what about it I know I'm saved brother
[1:05:08] though you can't tell me I ain't say
[1:05:09] that's where the trouble is can God tell
[1:05:12] you what if he's him speaking through a
[1:05:17] dumb beast again like me I don't mind
[1:05:22] talking hard
[1:05:24] what if he's using me to try to deceive
[1:05:27] you you know what I'm gonna do the best
[1:05:29] job I can do that's that's why I want to
[1:05:37] go somewheres else they shout emotions
[1:05:39] and they don't never talk about bad
[1:05:41] things they're always up and I always
[1:05:43] glory hallelujah
[1:05:45] don't let the door hit you usually go
[1:05:47] out help yourself
[1:05:54] all I ask you is one thing what does the
[1:05:57] word say that's all I ask is what is the
[1:06:05] word you know what the word says word
[1:06:08] says they'll be false and they'll be
[1:06:11] anointed ones in the end time that would
[1:06:13] deceive the very elect if it was
[1:06:14] possible on as I said want to go we say
[1:06:17] I can't be deceived
[1:06:19] I'm he left okay will agree we forgot
[1:06:22] about this statement the Prophet said
[1:06:25] frankly it would get the elect messed up
[1:06:32] delete have to cut the work short go
[1:06:41] ahead you quote unquote with you does
[1:06:44] that mean we're saved or lost could mean
[1:06:47] all of us is lost if it is I'm doing my
[1:06:52] best to get us to the place to find out
[1:06:54] if we're lost
[1:07:00] yeah but my salvation is always being as
[1:07:03] I spoke in tongues I shouted I cried I
[1:07:07] don't praise God that's a working to the
[1:07:11] Holy Spirit but you do every bit of that
[1:07:14] and be lost what are you gonna put it on
[1:07:21] come on these issues what are you gonna
[1:07:24] put it on
[1:07:30] well I'm barely getting to the place
[1:07:34] brother day on it
[1:07:35] well you preach this I mean I really
[1:07:37] don't know what to put it on well praise
[1:07:38] God I've done my job I've confused you
[1:07:41] enough until now you can do something
[1:07:43] about it you mean I'm supposed to let
[1:07:48] you go ahead and die and go to hell and
[1:07:49] stand at you looking in hell and say
[1:07:51] well I could have helped you but I
[1:07:52] didn't remember
[1:08:00] anointed ones are anointed on their
[1:08:05] spirit with the genuine Holy Spirit but
[1:08:10] they are not anointed in their soul the
[1:08:14] soul is either lost or saved faith or
[1:08:19] doubt but we live in an anointing world
[1:08:25] esteem we live in a world of anointing
[1:08:28] this was trying to get the point
[1:08:31] we are anointed to believe this and
[1:08:34] believe that he was anointed to believe
[1:08:40] that she was to produce as he produced
[1:08:46] it what about your anointing what is it
[1:08:52] they made anything hard for to
[1:08:54] understand oh it's just a fact of one
[1:08:57] thing
[1:08:57] what are we put in our salvation
[1:09:06] what is it based on now quote if we get
[1:09:11] a little up this afternoon
[1:09:12] the Prophet said salvation is based on
[1:09:14] one time the Word of God no matter if
[1:09:20] it's Old Testament or neither
[1:09:24] you realize under the Old Testament if
[1:09:27] you kept the law to the letter you was
[1:09:29] not guilty
[1:09:34] but you realize the law was added
[1:09:36] because of transgressions you know what
[1:09:40] the law became a record keeper of your
[1:09:46] sin that's why you will read one of
[1:09:52] these days and the Prophet it'll don't
[1:09:54] only where he said the biggest mistake
[1:09:57] Israel ever made was asking for the law
[1:10:01] in Exodus 19 what did they need the law
[1:10:05] for they had to Pillar a fire they had
[1:10:08] the grace of God they had a prophet that
[1:10:11] could solve all of their problems yet
[1:10:14] they wanted to law read you Bible but -
[1:10:22] but but but the laws were to God yeah
[1:10:25] Paul said the letter killeth there was
[1:10:29] no mercy written in the law say mister
[1:10:36] some cuz you won't be back but there was
[1:10:39] no mercy written in the law but while
[1:10:42] the law was in existence there was
[1:10:44] salvation in a place for them to go to
[1:10:49] when they died no salvation go ahead
