[0:06] good
[0:09] morning today I wanted to read from
[0:12] start on Isaiah
[0:14] 59 maybe
[0:18] um get into um I just felt kind of
[0:22] inspired to talk about some of the
[0:25] negative things that are going
[0:27] around lately on the internet and
[0:30] different things and take a close look
[0:32] at what at some things so let's start
[0:35] off with Isaiah 59 we get into the
[0:40] lesson and as you turn to that I I put
[0:42] up this scripture this this picture
[0:44] because I um one reason it's it's real
[0:47] nice and and another is because I
[0:52] morning brother d i I always thought it
[0:55] was just so amazing that as the children
[0:57] of Israel went through the the
[0:58] Wilderness they they could see the
[1:00] pillar of fire leading them in the cloud
[1:02] by by day and yet when they got to cadis
[1:06] Baria and the test really came K God
[1:08] lead us over and Deliver Us from these
[1:11] Giants in the land and lead us into the
[1:13] land they failed to believe the sign
[1:16] they failed to believe the sign that
[1:18] that that the signs that Moses have been
[1:20] given and they failed to believe all the
[1:22] things that God had done when it was
[1:24] right there staring him in the face and
[1:27] um so that's kind of what I wanted to
[1:29] talk about today
[1:30] let's look at Isaiah
[1:32] 59 and start at verse
[1:37] 9 therefore is Judgment far from us
[1:41] neither do justice overtake us we wait
[1:45] for light but behold obscurity for
[1:47] brightness but we walk in darkness we
[1:50] grope for the wall like the Blind and we
[1:52] grope as if we had no eyes we stumble at
[1:56] noon day as in the night we are in
[1:58] desolate places as dead
[2:01] men we roar all like bears and mourn
[2:04] sore like doves we look for judgment but
[2:07] there is none for salvation but it is
[2:11] far from
[2:12] us now uh before I continue reading it
[2:16] just to set the context think about this
[2:19] in the in the
[2:21] uh Israel their first king jeroboam
[2:24] began to he he placed in Dan and bethl
[2:27] two golden alts and he began to leave is
[2:29] lead is
[2:30] down the path of idolatry further and
[2:32] further away from God and as they went
[2:35] through king after King they went
[2:38] further and further away from God until
[2:40] after seven Kings they were Ahab married
[2:43] Ahab the seventh King married Jezebel
[2:45] and uh set up just if you looked at this
[2:48] at the economy and the society of Israel
[2:51] at that time you'd say well there's
[2:52] there's nobody left that believes God's
[2:55] word and so think about this in that
[2:59] kind of said in a context of um uh we're
[3:02] reading in Isaiah but I'm going to start
[3:04] talking about Elijah in a second we all
[3:07] like Bears verse 11 and mourn sore like
[3:10] doves we look for judgment but there is
[3:12] none for salvation but it is far off
[3:15] from us for our transgressions are
[3:17] multiplied before thee and our sins
[3:19] testify against us for our
[3:21] transgressions are with us and as for
[3:23] our iniquities we know them and
[3:26] transgressing and lying against the Lord
[3:28] and departing away from our God God
[3:30] speaking oppression and Revolt
[3:32] conceiving and uttering from the heart
[3:33] words of falsehood and judgment is
[3:36] turned away backward and just to stand a
[3:38] far off for truth is fallen in the
[3:41] street and Equity cannot enter the think
[3:44] about this day when it looks so dark all
[3:46] around it it seems like if you just can
[3:48] profess that you know the truth then
[3:51] then people hate you yay truth fath and
[3:54] he that departeth from Evil maketh
[3:56] himself a prey you make yourself a prey
[3:58] because it it causes people to turn
[4:00] against you when you say I know what I'm
[4:02] talking about and the Lord saw it and it
[4:04] displeased him that there was no
[4:06] judgment and he saw that there was no
[4:08] man and wondered that there was no
[4:10] intercessor therefore his arm brought
[4:12] salvation unto him and his righteousness
[4:14] it sustained him for he put on
[4:17] righteousness as a bre breastplate and
[4:18] in helment of Salvation upon his head
[4:21] and he put on the garments of Vengeance
[4:22] for clothing and was clad with Zeal as a
[4:25] cloak and you we know that this is the
[4:27] scripture that Paul quote in Ephesians
[4:29] that we clothe ourselves with the
[4:31] breastplate of righteousness and and so
[4:33] on the Believers putting on these
[4:36] garments according to their deeds
[4:38] accordingly he will repay Fury Fury to
[4:40] his adversaries recompense to his
[4:42] enemies to the islands he will repay
[4:45] recompense so shall they fear the name
[4:48] of the Lord from the West and his glory
[4:50] from the rising of the sun when the
[4:52] enemy shall come in like a flood the
[4:54] spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[4:56] standard against him
[4:58] amen
[5:00] so that's kind of what I want to talk
[5:02] about is a standard what is a standard
[5:04] and in the military when you know when
[5:06] they would ride forth with horses and
[5:08] and different things in the in the olden
[5:10] times they when they'd lift a banner up
[5:13] to let them know that they were still in
[5:15] control of the of the battle the side
[5:17] they were fighting for and when that
[5:18] Banner would fall somebody would pick it
[5:21] up to to let it so that everybody could
[5:23] look at that and give them hope a banner
[5:26] is and you know brother brand said this
[5:28] standard that that we have is God's word
[5:30] and he's lifting that up in us so that
[5:33] we can you know when you walk into
[5:35] Walmart or somebody sees you coming
[5:37] around the corner uh maybe a better
[5:39] example we had somebody come out
[5:41] yesterday to give us an estimate for a
[5:42] new deck and you could just see the
[5:45] man's look changed when my wife walked
[5:47] out of the house and addressed because
[5:49] she's a standard to the world because
[5:51] the word is made manifest in her and God
[5:53] all down Through the Ages when when uh
[5:56] Darkness would encroach upon the land
[5:59] like in the uh when the uh uh during
[6:02] Noah's time every the whole world was
[6:05] just in darkness and it looked like
[6:06] nobody else nobody was left to believe
[6:09] but God raised up a standard in Noah and
[6:11] then in David when uh he went to check
[6:14] on the uh on the battle and and nobody
[6:17] would go fight Goliath but the word rose
[6:19] up in David and he said I'll go fight
[6:21] him and he rose up and and the battle
[6:24] was won so all down Through the Ages the
[6:28] uh uh standard was God when it looked
[6:31] like God was no longer with the people
[6:33] he rose a standard and so in First Kings
[6:36] chapter 17 and in a minute we'll talk
[6:39] about the significance of 17 But First
[6:42] Kings chapter 17 this man comes on the
[6:45] scene suddenly now all down through
[6:48] First Kings 1-6 it tells all these
[6:51] stories of all the different Kings and
[6:52] how they went further and further into
[6:54] apostasy and then boom out of nowhere
[6:56] comes Elijah on the scene and what does
[6:59] he do he said says as the Lord God of
[7:01] Israel liveth that I serve no due or
[7:05] rain will fall on the earth until I call
[7:08] for and uh somebody a while back sent
[7:11] sent me an email of some questions they
[7:13] had about um uh just things that you
[7:17] know all the naysayers are saying these
[7:19] days and they're like well why did
[7:20] Brother Brown speak so harshly against
[7:23] women now you could say the same thing
[7:24] about Elijah when he
[7:27] said excuse me
[7:30] I I feel full up right now he
[7:35] said
[7:37] why you could say why did Elijah call
[7:41] for rain that looks so harsh but he he
[7:44] was trying God the word was raised up in
[7:47] him to be a standard to get people to
[7:49] repent to come back to the word and the
[7:52] reason brother random spoke so harshly
[7:54] about about women was because a woman is
[7:57] a manifestation of what the man is
[8:00] we the bride represents what God is you
[8:04] can see God in the bride making manifest
[8:06] and when you see a woman that's not
[8:08] living right she's a manifestation of
[8:10] something wrong with her husband and
[8:12] that that's straight talk but it's uh
[8:15] when you see when when I see in this
[8:18] church let me just be
[8:20] straight somebody coming up the the to
[8:22] the sanctuary with their their shirt
[8:24] halfway unbuttoned down to their Naval
[8:26] it it speaks it speaks against their
[8:29] husband that their husband doesn't
[8:31] realize that something is wrong and you
[8:35] know somebody look at all these things
[8:36] that brother ran up this the straight
[8:37] way that he talked about different
[8:39] things and think well um it it's so hard
[8:43] but then uh you know Jesus said
[8:45] Generation of Vipers and John said that
[8:48] ax is laid to the root of the tree if
[8:49] you don't bear forth fruit you'll be
[8:51] heed down and cast into fire and the
[8:53] whole object of it is to get people to
[8:55] repent and to surrender to God now uh as
[8:59] we look at criticism it's it's uh
[9:03] criticism is it's really of the devil
[9:06] you look at uh I had a brother telling
[9:08] me um about just a hard trial that he
[9:11] was going through and uh he he just
[9:13] confided in me the this this I won't say
[9:16] his name but the state was trying to
[9:18] take his children away from him and um
[9:21] just going through all these hard things
[9:22] and he said the hardest part was that
[9:25] Believers would call him on the phone
[9:27] and say well there's secret sin in your
[9:28] life you're not right and things like
[9:30] that because it's hard for somebody to
[9:33] look at somebody else and believe that
[9:35] God is in that person to overlook their
[9:38] faults maybe and so as as people are
[9:41] looking at brother rand's message and
[9:43] things they've got their own mental
[9:44] conception of how it's supposed to be
[9:47] and they begin to
[9:50] criticize but brother brandham said I
[9:52] have heard but now I
[9:56] see no matter how religious you are how
[9:58] many churches you belong to how many
[10:00] books your names on if that genuine the
[10:02] Holy Ghost is in you you'll see the
[10:04] message in the hour because it's the
[10:06] holy ghost that does it there has to be
[10:09] something read on down that is it only
[10:11] the elected of God will see it and I I
[10:14] just it such a blessing in this day to
[10:17] just be able to understand and be able
[10:18] to see it just to you know even if you
[10:22] don't understand the seals completely
[10:23] and understand all Danel 7 weeks if you
[10:25] can say I believe that God sent a
[10:27] prophet and he sent him so that his word
[10:30] can be made manifest in us and that we
[10:31] can take a body change that's uh that's
[10:33] a huge
[10:35] blessing
[10:37] now talking about criticism I I wanted
[10:40] to look at this scripture because this
[10:42] is one that I I just love that brother
[10:45] Brown stumbled when he said this and
[10:48] this is one of my my FV I I've talked to
[10:51] several of of the people here in this
[10:52] church about this scripture and I I
[10:54] wanted to mention that this uh quote
[10:57] that brother R said and I wanted to
[10:59] mention it here
[11:00] because this uh if you got a copy of the
[11:03] latest catch the vision from the voice
[11:05] of God this is a question that somebody
[11:08] wrote in why did Brother brandom stumble
[11:11] and I just felt like they were so LED of
[11:13] the Lord in the answer that they gave in
[11:15] the little section with questions so
[11:18] this if you've never read this before
[11:19] this is where uh in looking at the
[11:21] Unseen God just takes over brother ROM's
[11:25] mouth and speaks through him and says
[11:28] I'm the Lord that raised up Christ from
[11:29] the grave I'm the one that sent the Holy
[11:31] Ghost I'm the one that give the promise
[11:32] brother brand has nothing to do in this
[11:34] I have he surrendered his life to me I'm
[11:37] using his Spirit I'm talking through his
[11:39] lips that's me I'm the Lord so somebody
[11:42] with a a a big more education than they
[11:44] can handle say it like that uh looked at
[11:47] this and said well this is not
[11:49] grammatically correct if God were
[11:51] speaking to this man he would use
[11:53] perfect grammar he would speak in a
[11:56] without stumbling he would speak in a
[11:58] perfect way and because he didn't speak
[12:00] like that then I I can't believe it and
[12:02] that's really the the extent of all the
[12:04] different criticisms that are coming
[12:06] around in the message is comes in a way
[12:08] that they don't
[12:10] expect so here's the answer that that
[12:13] they gave in the in the cas div Vision
[12:15] I'm the Lord that raised up Christ from
[12:16] the grave they said the grammatically
[12:18] preferred way to say this would be I'm
[12:20] the Lord who and they answered they
[12:22] didn't answer with their own opinion
[12:23] they answered from the word Ezekiel 79
[12:26] and M eyes shall not spare neither will
[12:27] I give pity I will recompense the
[12:28] according to thy ways and th
[12:29] Abominations that are in the midst of
[12:30] thee and you shall know that I am the
[12:32] Lord that
[12:33] smiteth isn't that
[12:36] beautiful that's the way it's written in
[12:38] the
[12:39] Bible I'm the Lord that raised up Christ
[12:41] from the great the word up is up is
[12:43] unnecessary and informal in form correct
[12:46] English up should be admitted but in 1
[12:49] Second Corinthians 4:14 it says knowing
[12:51] that he which raised up the Lord Jesus
[12:54] shall raise up us also by Jesus and
[12:57] shall present us with you
[13:00] the
[13:01] Lord I have he surrendered his life to
[13:04] me question are we to believe that the
[13:07] Lord actually stumbled over his words
[13:09] here the incomplete sentence I have
[13:12] suggests a lack of forethought on the
[13:14] part of the one speaking but is Isaiah
[13:16] 28 says for with stammering lips and
[13:18] another tongue will he speak to this
[13:20] people I just I just thank the Lord for
[13:23] the
[13:25] truth and then the last one that's me
[13:27] I'm the Lord should be it is I I'm the
[13:30] Lord so I now they had in the in their
[13:33] answer that that's me is actually
[13:36] correct Modern English so I wanted to
[13:38] verify so uh this is the source this is
[13:41] a website that has all this grammatical
[13:43] stuff if you if you're interested you
[13:45] can have it but that's me is actually
[13:48] the correct way it's the correct grammar
[13:51] it is I is not we don't speak like that
[13:53] anymore so he was using perfect grammar
[13:56] although it didn't meet their
[13:58] expectations it didn't match what they
[14:01] expected it to be that that was correct
[14:05] now let's talk about the cloud but
[14:07] before we get into the cloud I want to
[14:09] talk about the number 17 the number 17
[14:11] is an interesting number because it's
[14:13] the seventh prime number and when God
[14:16] vindicates his word all through
[14:18] scripture many times and you'll see as
[14:20] we go through he ties it with the number
[14:23] 17 uh so let's look at some examples in
[14:27] the Bible where he used the seven the
[14:29] number 17 Noah when he when Noah went in
[14:32] the ark he waited a whole week and y'all
[14:34] kind of ignore that I got all my answers
[14:36] up here
[14:39] on he waited in the ark a whole week and
[14:42] everybody was like where is the rain
[14:44] maybe all his children are saying where
[14:45] when is the rain going to come but then
[14:47] on the 17th day the rain came and he uh
[14:51] went around the world all the whole
[14:54] earth was covered with water and on the
[14:55] 17th day of the month uh he went in the
[14:58] AR the r rain fell on the second day of
[15:00] the 17th month and he rested on the
[15:02] seventh day sth month on the 17th day of
[15:04] the month but when the rain fell and
[15:07] when the AR rested was on the 17th day
[15:10] Jacob lived in Egypt 17 years before he
[15:14] died Joseph was 17 years when he was
[15:16] sold into slavery which is not really
[15:18] adequate description because in the
[15:19] Bible it talks about he was 17 years old
[15:21] and then it talks about how he had those
[15:23] V the dreams and the visions of the the
[15:25] stalks bowing and the and the Moon and
[15:27] the Earth and every everything so he was
[15:29] 17 years old when his dreams began to be
[15:34] fulfilled Elijah doesn't come on
[15:36] suddenly comes on the scene in First
[15:38] Kings chapter
[15:40] 17 Goliath was killed in 1 Samuel
[15:44] chapter 17 now these are all the
[15:45] standards that I was talking about
[15:47] earlier about David coming on the scene
[15:48] and killed Goliath Noah and and Joseph
[15:51] and the 17th book of the Bible was about
[15:53] a Vindicated bride what book is
[15:56] that anybody remember and
[16:01] okay Esther came forth she was the
[16:04] standard the 17th book of the Bible and
[16:06] in Genesis
[16:08] 17 is a type of Abraham receiving the
[16:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost now many
[16:12] people forget Genesis 18 where the word
[16:15] came to Abraham and he talked to the
[16:17] word face to face but in Genesis 17
[16:20] there a type of of Abraham receiving the
[16:22] baptism of Holy Ghost because God said
[16:24] uh Abraham walk before me now let's go
[16:27] through all these these scriptures of
[16:29] the of the Bride being Vindicated Luke
[16:31] 17 the sign even thus shall it be in the
[16:33] day when the son of man is revealed Luke
[16:35] 1:17 and he shall go before him in the
[16:37] spirit and power of Eliah to turn the
[16:39] hearts of the father to the children and
[16:40] the Disobedience of the wisdom of the
[16:42] just to make ready a people prepared for
[16:43] the Lord James 5:17 Elias was a man
[16:47] subject to like passions as we are and
[16:49] he prayed earnestly that it might not
[16:50] rain and it rained not on the Earth by
[16:52] the space of 3 years and 6 months Luke
[16:55] 14:17 and send his servant at supper
[16:58] time to say to them they were bit that
[17:00] were bid come for all things are now
[17:04] ready now think about these as they
[17:06] apply to the messages we'll get we'll
[17:07] get in a second look at 17 in the
[17:09] message 1 Corinthians 15:51 51 is 17 * 3
[17:14] behold I show you a mystery we shall not
[17:15] all sleep but we shall all be changed
[17:18] and when they and in 2 Kings 2 2:17 and
[17:21] when they urged him till he was ashamed
[17:23] he said sin they sent there for 50 men
[17:26] and they sought three days but found him
[17:28] not because was gone he would take a
[17:29] body
[17:31] chain the 1 Thessalonians 4:17 then we
[17:34] which are alive and remain shall be
[17:36] called up together with him in the
[17:37] clouds Matthew 17:11 and Jesus answered
[17:40] and said unto him them Elias truly shall
[17:42] first come and restore all things Luke
[17:44] 2451 and it came to pass while he
[17:46] blessed them he was departed from and
[17:48] from them and carried up into heaven and
[17:50] Ephesians 1:17 that the god of our Lord
[17:52] Jesus Christ the father of Lord may give
[17:55] unto you the spirit of wisdom and
[17:56] Revelation and the knowledge of him how
[17:58] do you know that You' got the Holy Ghost
[18:00] because he brings to you remembrance and
[18:02] shows you things to
[18:03] come the knowledge so now let's let's
[18:07] look at 17 in the message on the Ohio
[18:10] River he was baptized in the 17th person
[18:12] when the pillar of fire appeared and
[18:13] gave him his commission hear ye him was
[18:16] the sermon that he preached more than
[18:17] any other sermon and he recorded that 17
[18:19] times and his text was Matthew
[18:21] 17 17 religions opposed brother Bram in
[18:24] Bombay and remember when he went over
[18:26] and he and he said anybody that can and
[18:29] that can heal this blind man come before
[18:31] me and I'll believe what you believe but
[18:33] if if I if if my God will heal this man
[18:37] then you give your life to the God that
[18:39] I serve and he issued that challenge I
[18:42] tell me there's nobody else ever has
[18:44] issued challenges like that they said if
[18:46] you if you have any Doctrine or
[18:48] disagreement when you come and stand
[18:49] beside me and show me where I'm wrong
[18:51] and nobody dare to stand besided but now
[18:54] people are getting on the Internet well
[18:55] after he's gone and saying all manner of
[18:58] things as a young boy brother Brandon
[19:00] was shot when he was 14 years old and he
[19:02] laid dying in the hospital the doctor
[19:03] said my boy you have 3 minutes more to
[19:05] live your heart is beating 17 times a
[19:07] minute he pastored this Baptist
[19:08] Tabernacle in Jeffersonville for 17
[19:10] years at 1717 Spring Street when he was
[19:14] shot uh that's a duplicate on Hope's
[19:16] deathbed she told him where the money
[19:18] was to buy a rifle that cost $17 when he
[19:21] left Mina at that at that challenge he
[19:22] said I want to go I want to go see if
[19:24] this what I'm having is is really true
[19:27] and he left his wife to go go pray in
[19:29] the cave and he said I got $17 left
[19:31] that's all the money he had left he was
[19:33] going to go find out from God if God had
[19:35] really sent him see how much time I got
[19:38] uh 1700 came to the altar in Fort Wayne
[19:40] Indiana when the nazarine girl lifted
[19:41] her hands from the
[19:43] piano and 17,000 when the Sam Houston
[19:46] Coliseum for 17 nights of service when
[19:48] the pillar of fire appeared in 1973 his
[19:51] life story had been published to 17 L
[19:54] around the
[19:55] world now
[19:57] incredible Ministry is foretold in
[20:00] Matthew 17 Luke 17 in 17 verses of Luke
[20:03] 17:
[20:04] 21-37 in Revelation 107 which is 10 +
[20:08] 717 and Luke 1:7 the Seven Seals were
[20:11] preached on March the 17th and they were
[20:13] delivered in 10 messages over 7 days and
[20:15] the photographs of the of the cloud
[20:17] appeared in May in the May 17th edition
[20:20] of Life
[20:21] magazine so God using it through see how
[20:24] perfect it is that God is by the number
[20:27] 17 proving that this is the right this
[20:29] is the I'm vindicating it not just by
[20:32] the word but everything's matching up
[20:34] everything is just perfectly
[20:37] aligned now some OB objections about the
[20:40] cloud that that people are saying
[20:42] brother better makes it sound like he
[20:43] was on Sunset Peak when the photograph
[20:45] was taken his recollection appears
[20:48] inconsistent which removes confidence in
[20:51] his sermons on the seals his intent was
[20:53] to show that the cloud was formed when
[20:55] he received the vision so let's look at
[20:58] some quotes let's see what brother
[20:59] Brandon really
[21:00] said in the breach between the seven
[21:02] Church ages and the Seven Seals and he
[21:04] took the book opened the book and tore
[21:07] off the seals and sent it down to the
[21:09] Earth to the seventh angel to reveal it
[21:11] to his
[21:14] people God before he and here you him
[21:17] 1960 this is the one that he preached 17
[21:20] times and he always used Matthew
[21:22] 17 God before he does anything always
[21:26] declares it in heaven first and then on
[21:29] Earth he declares that in the heavens
[21:31] above like the wise men saw the star
[21:33] come to Worship the Lord Jesus and then
[21:35] God always makes a witness of what he
[21:37] does I think all the way down through
[21:39] scripture first he declared Virgo in the
[21:41] heavens and then a virgin was born first
[21:43] he uh created that spiritual man Genesis
[21:45] 12627 then he put him in Earth and all
[21:48] down through scriptures he puts first he
[21:50] the wise men saw those three stars and
[21:52] then then they were led to the Infant
[21:54] Jesus he first he does it in Heavens and
[21:56] then he declares
[21:57] it so let's look at the cloud timeline
[22:00] did did he say this is what he said
[22:02] about when he where he was come follow
[22:04] me 1963 see I looked to see when it was
[22:07] and it was time same about day or two
[22:09] before or day or two after I was up
[22:12] there so in other words around the same
[22:14] time not necessarily the exact same time
[22:17] but around the same
[22:19] time so I I I put this timeline together
[22:22] it's kind of hard uh when you're just
[22:24] listening to people to see exactly when
[22:25] events occurred now if you disagree with
[22:27] this that's fine F but I put this
[22:29] together based on brother perig Green's
[22:31] testimony based on sister Rebecca
[22:32] Smith's uh publication the sunset
[22:35] Mountain that she put in only believe
[22:37] and uh this is also based on Fred San's
[22:40] uh testimony about when they were
[22:41] actually out in uh honey so in around
[22:46] January 1963 January early February uh
[22:49] he had he reached up his hands and the
[22:51] King sword appeared in his hands and
[22:54] which was the the word of the Lord given
[22:56] to him February 28th
[22:59] was the photograph was taken of the
[23:00] cloud in the evening March 4th he
[23:02] preached the absolute in Houston and on
[23:04] March 6th they started hunting March 7th
[23:07] in the morning the Angels Came to him
[23:10] picked him up and told him to go back
[23:12] east and begin preaching the Seven Seals
[23:15] on March 14th now now this this is these
[23:18] two dates are based on Fred sofin saying
[23:20] when when they were hunting so March 7th
[23:23] the angel the angels visited him which
[23:26] was 7 days after the cloud was
[23:29] photographed and then March 14th another
[23:31] 7 days they went arrived back in
[23:33] Jeffersonville and on March 17th the
[23:36] number 17 he started preaching the seals
[23:39] or he started preaching the Christ hi
[23:41] the Simplicity and the breach on that
[23:43] Sunday and then on May 17th uh now now
[23:46] remember he preached 10 10 sermons
[23:48] across 7 days and then on May 17th it
[23:51] was again Vindicated on the 17th day in
[23:54] Life
[23:55] Magazine so uh that's that's just real
[23:58] real quick so now now then
[24:03] so he God gave him the word to bring to
[24:06] us which is how we're
[24:09] Vindicated how how a man is is
[24:12] Vindicated by by let me slow down a
[24:14] second I'm speaking too fast by their
[24:16] fruits you shall know them this is what
[24:18] brother R about said about fruits is
[24:21] that your fruit is your Doctrine your
[24:23] fruit is your what is the fruit the word
[24:24] for the fruit of the season that's what
[24:26] it is they're teaching the teaching of
[24:27] what the teaching of the Season what
[24:29] time it is man's Doctrine denominational
[24:32] Doctrine or God's word for the season so
[24:34] that's next there they'll start
[24:36] attacking what he said to try to
[24:38] discredit
[24:40] it but uh just looking at this picture
[24:45] you know you could say it's uh this and
[24:47] that and everything but because brother
[24:49] brandom was called up with the angels
[24:51] and they gave him they took him to a
[24:52] different perspective and that's how we
[24:54] know that's how uh we can look into the
[24:58] word and see what's truth is because God
[25:00] gave brother Brandon the word to give to
[25:03] us to cause us to have a to look at
[25:05] things with a different perspective so
[25:07] many people looked at this picture and
[25:08] said oh I don't see anything and he said
[25:10] well you're looking at it the wrong way
[25:12] the Angels took me up so that I could
[25:14] look at it from a different perspective
[25:15] and he said you got to turn it to the
[25:17] right and now you can see you can see
[25:21] Christ
[25:22] manifested in this in this in the cloud
[25:25] the Angels amen you can see the the
[25:28] Angels wings and um the all four beasts
[25:31] and
[25:33] everything now so let's look at what
[25:35] they're saying about him plagiarizing
[25:38] running
[25:39] out and in the first seal he said and at
[25:43] the end of the Pentecost age we're
[25:44] supposed to receive according to the
[25:46] word of God helped me tonight to show
[25:47] you through here that we are to see
[25:49] receive a messenger that would take all
[25:51] those loose ends out there and reveal
[25:53] the whole Secret Of God for the ratering
[25:56] of the
[25:56] church now I I think that's really the
[25:59] key people say well he plagiarized
[26:02] Clarence Lin because Clarence Lin said a
[26:05] lot of the same things that brother Ram
[26:06] do he well in that same token you could
[26:09] say he plagiarized Martin Luther because
[26:12] Martin Luther preached justification and
[26:14] John Wesley preached sanctification but
[26:16] when brother brandom came on the scene
[26:17] he said hold on now it's not right
[26:20] brother Martin Luther to sit in a pub
[26:22] and smoke and drink beer and and uh John
[26:25] Wesley we've got to come on to the
[26:27] whether word is made manifest in you
[26:29] that the same that Christ is is living
[26:31] inside of you not just living a clean
[26:33] life but uh and uh
[26:36] so brother brand took took all the Loose
[26:39] Ends the little things all down through
[26:40] time that people had gotten uh even
[26:43] though maybe for the most part a lot of
[26:45] men had the right the right Doctrine and
[26:48] were almost in line but then brother B
[26:50] came along and said well you misplaced
[26:51] this here let's put this over here
[26:53] because that's and and everything ties
[26:55] in continuity so then you can look at
[26:57] the church ages and tie it with Daniel
[26:59] 70 weeks and tie Daniel 70 weeks with
[27:02] the Seven Seals and everything matches
[27:04] up into just a perfect harmonious
[27:06] picture and that's that's the key
[27:08] everything has to match up if it doesn't
[27:10] match up if you can look at any quote of
[27:12] brother Brands and say well it doesn't
[27:13] match up with this one over here it's
[27:15] not brother random it's it's your
[27:18] understanding just like the cloud you
[27:19] look at the cloud and say well I don't
[27:20] see I I don't see what I'm supposed to
[27:22] be seeing here and and he said turn it
[27:24] this way now now this is one that they
[27:28] they they say well uh Clarence Lin said
[27:30] that Matthew 24 was associated with the
[27:33] Seven Seals uh well okay so did um a
[27:37] commentary critical and explanatory in
[27:39] the whole Bible published in
[27:41] 1871 but the problem is they they knew
[27:44] that Matthew 24 was associated with the
[27:46] first six seals but they got the
[27:50] association and uh I have
[27:54] uh maybe after class if if you want it I
[27:57] I have the comparison between what
[27:59] Clarence Lin said and what this said
[28:02] okay I'll print it out for you and what
[28:05] brother brand said and brother brandom
[28:07] tied the script the verses in Matthew 24
[28:10] perfectly with what the first six seals
[28:12] are but nobody else could do that so he
[28:15] came along behind the scenes and uh he
[28:17] came along after these brothers and and
[28:19] and tied together what they had gotten
[28:22] incorrect now the next they say Well
[28:24] Clarence Lin said he got the same dates
[28:28] this is off of the
[28:30] uh uh well that that brother that's
[28:32] speaking out he's got a he's got a a a
[28:35] website and this is what he has on his
[28:37] website that Clarence Lin has the exact
[28:39] same dates for the church ages that
[28:42] brother brandom has this is what he has
[28:44] on the website now is this
[28:47] true and a lot of these dates are are
[28:50] are just glaringly obvious like 312 um
[28:53] when Constantine ascended in Rome and
[28:55] came into power to 8606 when they when
[28:58] they crown the one of the Bishops
[29:02] uh uh Universal Bishop bonifus II the
[29:06] third was crowned Universal bishop and
[29:08] many of these dates well um let's see uh
[29:13] Martin Luther let's see Martin Luther
[29:18] put the 13 thesis on the on the I mean
[29:22] the how many was it 99 99 theses on the
[29:26] wiberg cathedral in 157 so his church
[29:28] really got started in 1520 and that's
[29:30] that's kind of where they arrive at
[29:32] these dates from a historical
[29:33] perspective they look at history and say
[29:35] well Claren Larin did we can we can
[29:39] group these dates together in such and
[29:40] such a way but now now now then brother
[29:44] Brandon said um this is this is the
[29:47] actual dates that Clarence Larin said he
[29:49] actually said 8070 is when the Ephesian
[29:52] Church age said started brother brand
[29:54] said the Ephesian Church age began in
[29:56] 853 when Paul started the Ephesian
[29:59] Church age and the uh the Clarence Lin
[30:03] said from 80 from 1750 to 188 1900 is
[30:06] when the uh Philadelphian Church age the
[30:10] dates for that but brother BR said the
[30:13] leosan church started
[30:15] onza Street April 9th 1909 when the Holy
[30:18] Spirit fell on isza street so uh my
[30:21] point is ROM came behind to tie up loose
[30:23] ends and if you say that uh he's getting
[30:27] this revelation we look at this in just
[30:28] a second he's getting uh these from
[30:32] somebody else well hold on just a second
[30:35] now uh as brother Brandon brought these
[30:38] dates and expounded them in the in the
[30:40] Tabernacle in the back of the Tabernacle
[30:43] it was Vindicated a light showing on the
[30:44] back
[30:46] and that's you know proving that it went
[30:50] down through all seven seven ages
[30:52] proving that what what his word said was
[30:56] true what he was saying was true so but
[30:59] now Clarence Len put dates but only
[31:01] brother brandham could put names to the
[31:03] ages and nobody else could do that and
[31:07] uh the reason that that Clarence lockin
[31:09] didn't do that is because that Clarence
[31:10] lockin preached that the Seven Stars in
[31:13] uh the redeemer's hand were not
[31:17] Messengers but they were the minist the
[31:19] five-fold ministry in each age or in
[31:21] each church so
[31:24] uh you say well well brother Ren's
[31:26] getting everything from somebody else
[31:28] but he didn't get this from somebody
[31:29] else brother so
[31:32] uh I should have put brother Brown I
[31:34] think I was copying that from the
[31:35] website Ephesian Church let's see so he
[31:38] he put all these these names to each
[31:40] Church age which we we're famili with
[31:42] and then now they say um that brother
[31:46] Brandon put names to each Church age so
[31:49] that he could put his own name at the
[31:51] last Church age that's what they're I'm
[31:54] I'm not presenting this to to um to
[31:57] fight them or
[31:58] because you know brother Brandon when he
[32:00] when he was speaking to the 17 religions
[32:02] in India he said I'm not trying to get
[32:05] you to see things my way but when they
[32:08] saw the eyes of the blind man open they
[32:11] saw the power of God then they they saw
[32:14] things that way but I'm I'm just trying
[32:16] to since uh you know when you see little
[32:19] sheep being led astray and things that's
[32:22] really my
[32:24] motivation the in the Ephesian church he
[32:26] said and the angel of the church of L I
[32:28] see is not known yet it will be someday
[32:30] but perhaps he on Earth he that has an
[32:33] ear know this is the age we're living in
[32:35] God will do the judging of that so he he
[32:38] never he never uh just came right out
[32:40] and
[32:41] said that I am the Messenger and
[32:44] questions and answers 1961 I believe
[32:46] that it's to be a man it'll be somebody
[32:48] after me but this message that I'm
[32:50] preaching is the true message of this
[32:51] day and it's the last message you see
[32:52] what I'm doing brother I'm putting you
[32:54] all the same place I am because you're
[32:56] just as much into it as I am you are
[32:58] messengers of this same message but
[33:00] anyway you can see what people are doing
[33:02] they're bending the truth a little bit
[33:04] saying that he put himself he put his
[33:06] own self as the last Church age
[33:09] messenger which um I mean I believe he
[33:12] was
[33:15] amen but he he didn't say I am Church
[33:20] M and then
[33:22] uh so I want to look at some of the
[33:24] things that we got like two minutes some
[33:27] of the things that Clarence Lin actually
[33:29] said and see what uh how it Compares and
[33:33] this is what Clarence Lin said about the
[33:35] Ephesian Church age and I just want to
[33:36] point out that this is all Clarence Lin
[33:39] said about the church age everything
[33:41] that he wrote can fit I can fit on one
[33:43] slide so you say well brother brandom
[33:45] got all of this huge expanse you think
[33:47] he's got this huge V that Clarence Len
[33:49] wrote books and books which he did but
[33:52] you can't say that brother brandom got
[33:54] all of this stuff that that he wrote
[33:56] about all the all the things tied
[33:58] everything together from one slide that
[34:00] Clarence Lin
[34:02] wrote and and so Clarence Larin wrote
[34:05] that is character seen its very first
[34:06] name for ephus means to go let go to
[34:08] relax that had become a backsliding
[34:10] church they say that's one of the things
[34:12] that brother brand plagiarize the
[34:14] character of the church is at Ephesus is
[34:16] a fair outline of the church period from
[34:17] 870 to 8170 and and that's another thing
[34:21] that they that they say he plagiarized
[34:22] those dates and and some of the other
[34:25] little details in
[34:26] here
[34:28] and and this is another thing that they
[34:29] say he PLU eyes the first seal this is
[34:32] now again this is everything Clarence
[34:34] Larin said about the first seal and I'm
[34:36] just going to be real quick when the
[34:38] lamb broke the first seal the first or
[34:39] lionlike living creature CED with a
[34:41] voice of thunder come the words and see
[34:43] are a many many manuscripts and in the
[34:45] revised version John had no need to come
[34:47] for he was already there the command
[34:49] then of come was to the riter of the
[34:51] White Horse I see what Clarence Len is
[34:53] saying he's saying that the Revelation
[34:55] was going to be to revealed to the rider
[34:57] not to John so brother R's not getting
[35:00] this Revelation from from Clarence L now
[35:03] some of these other things are are are
[35:05] correct you know moving along that the
[35:07] white horse rider was the Antichrist and
[35:09] so forth but now what about when when
[35:12] Clarence lgan saw that white horse rider
[35:14] riding away did he get a revelation of
[35:16] one God because Clarence ler remained a
[35:18] TR a
[35:19] trinitarian who went out to meet that
[35:21] Rider what Beast was it was it was it
[35:24] the word the lon that he he never says
[35:27] anything about that when did the Rider
[35:29] ride out cuz he puts him over in the
[35:31] after the Rapture that uh during that
[35:34] last seven years of of Daniel 70 weeks
[35:37] that uh then the writer begins to write
[35:39] out what about justification do you see
[35:42] that you're white white righteous church
[35:45] but what about uh all these different
[35:47] other parts of of Revelations the scene
[35:49] in heaven what kind of scene is being
[35:51] displayed here what about the what is
[35:53] the Father's throne and all these things
[35:55] that uh go beyond anything that Clarence
[35:58] Larin wrote just uh Way
[36:01] Beyond and this is all that moving
[36:04] through the real quick through the other
[36:06] seals the second seal this is all that
[36:09] he wrote about the second
[36:11] seal what about the false prophet
[36:13] sanctification any reference to the
[36:16] pope and this is everything that
[36:18] Clarence Len wrote about the seventh
[36:20] seal and he wrote some good good points
[36:22] in there about the silence and facing
[36:24] heaven but he never wrote about personal
[36:27] Revelation about uh the all the
[36:29] Mysteries being tied up in the last
[36:31] Church age the um and all the different
[36:33] things that brother R spoke about the
[36:35] three-fold purpose of his coming that
[36:37] God will be manifested in in first in
[36:38] his his son and his people and and all
[36:41] those things and then I was going to get
[36:43] into something they're saying about some
[36:46] of the prophecies that brother B had but
[36:48] I think we'll stop right there I hope
[36:50] that was edifying a little
[36:56] bit
[37:07] what was it you were
[37:08] saying I guess I just had a momentary
[37:11] laugh why number 17 is significant I
[37:17] know I mean you went over all the
