believe what we believe amen we greet you this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus by what a what an atmosphere has been created in the building this morning we know that before the believers arrived here there was no God here this God don't dwell in sheetrock and carpet but he dwells in the hearts of his children I believe this morning he's here a man if you have your Bibles today we'll go straight to the scripture to the Book of Numbers we want to look there in the 14th chapter numbers the 14th chapter and while you're returning there we want to take this opportunity to say we have sure enjoyed being here with you this weekend and sure pray that something was said yesterday to bless you and help you the young people in the meeting and I sure appreciate the vision and the burden to have the meeting for the young people as we said with all the camps and things been canceled because of the things going on in our land today amen I think it was special to be able to get together with young people again amen just to worship the Lord and sure when I say we appreciate brother Sam and he's allowing us to come and minister to you this weekend and met brother brother Sam and brother Wade several years back in the ministers meeting and I was a young feller then still young but just reeling thing I really admired about brother Sam was every time I heard him in those ministers meetings he was promoting the message and I thank God for elders that are here standing promoting this message and you see the morning you see this morning the fruit amen of a pastor that will promote the message we man we we want to say god bless you brother Sam we're doing that somebody that will just say what a prophet said and not change it or water it down but say it the way he said it and I admire that in your brother and I appreciate it so god bless you this morning and we just want to look here in the Book of Numbers the 14th chapter and the 41st verse and before we read this one acquiesced by our hearts together we pray over a natural mill and ask the Lord to bless it and we know this is a spiritual meal so let's just ask the Lord to come and speak to his heavenly Father Lord as we gather here this morning we do not come here out of ritual we do not come here out of tradition father but we come here because there is a deep calling to the deep on the inside of our hearts and Lord we know that your word has promised us that where two or three would gather in your name father you said you would come and be in the midst of them and I believe here this morning that you're here in the midst of the church I believe that you're here in power I believe you're here in authority I believe you're here in reality this morning and father we know that as believers come together Lord we all come from different walks of life different Lord trials different situations we're all in needy people here this morning but father we know that your word is still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and Lord as your prophet has taught us that the gift of the of a preacher is to be able to get himself out of the way and I pray this one in O God that you would come and you would help me this one and Lord to get myself out of the way father you see what I've looked at and prepared and studied but father I know that you know if there's a need in this building Lord you can lead me away from these nodes Lord you can lead me in the direction you would have me to go father and I just ask you this morning to help me Lord to be sensitive to your spirit father may you anoint me Lord but I ask you not just anoint me as the speaker but O God may you're not the people as the hearers father Lord may you Lord anoint them to pull and to receive this morning near God and father is we have come this morning we know their sickness in the land we know there's discouragements there's bondages there's trials but I pray this morning Lord that you would send a grace this morning from the Word of God that would cover your children today Lord father I pray you at bond the hand of every enemy that would try to torment them near God you would bind the hand of every spirit that would try to hold them this morning Lord and father may they hear that jubilee trumpet this morning sounding their God they can go free father I pray you and bless them this morning anoint us afresh today God and we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory Lord we asked you to forgive us of our failures and our shortcomings or may when we leave this service today God may we leave closer to you than we were when we come and we'll give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the believers said a man and a man in the book of numbers here the 14th chapter in the 41st verse the Bible here says and Moses said wherefore now do you transgress the commandment of the Lord but it shall not prosper go not up for the Lord is not among you that you be not smitten he says before your enemies for the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you and ye shall fall by the sword because you are turned away from the Lord therefore the Lord will not be with you now here Moses is a vindicated prophet of God speaking to them telling them this is what's going to happen this is what's going to transpire and they presumed to go up under the hilltop nevertheless the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and Moses departed not out of the camp and then the Amalekites came down and the Canaanites was dwelling that hill and smoked them and disken fitted them even on to her ma we asked the Lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you may have your seats here for just a few moments this morning by the help of the Lord I'd like to if I can to minister to you here out of these scriptures and for those of you that study the message and listen to the tapes you're very well aware of that this was brother brems text for the message presuming and I want to speak to here for just a few moments here on supreme authority by the word supreme authority by the word when you begin to speak about authority we all know that brother BAM tells us we don't have any power he says but we have authority he said they don't take power someone said you got any power no but I've got authority that's right he said you take a little policeman standing out there he wears uniform his hat is too big for him sits down over his ears he hasn't got power to stop nothing he said but let him walk out there in a car coming down the street with 300 horsepower engine let him raise up that hand and watch the brake slide he said why he hasn't got no power but he's got Authority and when a man or woman is anointed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he may not be able to read his name in bockscar sized letters with education but he has got authority from God and that he is a son of God and let him take his authority and stand and say stop he meant and Satan's wheels will slide brakes will something will take place because he's been given authority by the Holy Ghost amen then my name they shall cast out Devils that's it sure he don't have to have a DD D or a PhD he has to know Jesus and know what's been given him there he stands yes sir so amen I think this morning that we're aware amen that the hour were living in is a day in time amen where everybody is right Amen everybody is right nobody is wrong amen but I'll just say this we have come to a time Amen that we've got to take a stand they men we've come to a time they meant words it's not going to work just to be a church member it's not going to work amen just to say you believe a prophet and to believe you ain't meant to go to a certain church but there's got to come a time than you as an individual Amen take a personal stand upon this message now admit when you speak when you speak about the message of the hour amen you find that there are many opinions they meant on the message of the hour but I'll say this amen I believe that the message is Christ amen and I believe he meant that Christ is the authority Amen therefore Christ is our authority this morning now Amen I'll just say it this way the message has come with a purpose they meant Amen God didn't send this message just to send another idea amen up on the Bible or send another prophet he meant but he sent it that this message would take our churches and would make them churches of authority amen he sent this message that our homes amen would become home as if Authority our young people him it would become young people of authority Amen to think this morning that we are not here amen based upon a Creed we are not here based upon a tradition amen but we are here because the Bible says we're serving the carcasses and then there the Eagles will be gathered together and what is that carcass this morning it's the word amen and we have come here around the word this morning amen and I'll say there is a power this morning amen there is an authority this morning in the house of God that you can stand up amen and whatever devil is pushing against you you can tell that devil it's time to stop and it has that police officer couldn't stop the car amen but when he showed him his authority he said stop in the car stop amen and I say this morning there is an authority in this message Amen that you can tell the devil Satan you gotta back off a mint we are not just another Church Amen but we are a people of authority Amen to think that the message of the hour this morning it's not a message of presuming amen amen if you listen any tapes at all you'll know but the man was not a presume her he meant he was a prophet of God amen and I'll say it this way the message of the hour is not a message of presuming a meant but the message of the hour is the authority to the church by the Living God amen I'll just lay a foundation here Bible says and the unveiling of God he said think of it the same pillar of fire Amen that come upon those men that wrote the Bible is the same pillar of fire here interpreting the Bible a man he said how we think him for that same water comfort amen what an identification I am so glad amen to be identified in that I don't know what to do he said I'd rather be identified in that than all the Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Lutheran all of the rest of them identified in that word were the Shekinah glory and revelation lays they meant then where is the Sakana glory it's in the word admit where is the revelation it's in the word Amen seek the pillar of fire then appeared visible among us identifying that the message is right timid like he did at the mountain signing I remember before the true message come forth Moses preached and he led them out of Egypt but before the real Commandments was laid down and I love that he says his brother Dale he says the seals was Brawley and he said see God came down before the people and prove that Moses he meant was sent from him that's right in a pillar of fire Moses had seen in a bus had talked to him and in the last days he meant to see the same pillar of fire he meant right among us speaking the same word not only that he meant but interpreted it by making it manifest and proving its the truth they meant see when did Moses meet the pillar of fire he met the pillar of fire before the Exodus he met now come on church he met winded the pillar of fire come to brother branham it didn't come in 64 a minute didn't come in 65 it came before the opening of the seals Amen to identify him as a voice of authority in the age that we're living in my I'll take it this morning amen it does my heart good amen to know when there's so many voices in the land there is a voice of a fire that it's come from this prophet of God amen you say bilenda you get excited about it it excites me amen when I think about a world of confusion Amen when I think about a world when churches don't know what to do Amen preachers don't know what to do Amen we have heard a prophet of God say you've come past this mountain long enough it's time to turn and go northward Amen see brother Branham is showing us them they meant that the hour that we're living in the world it's presuming now amen it was not only that though we're always presuming a member he was showing you every denomination was pursue me even know what were they do and they were able they were assuming Amen that they were right and then they were presuming God was with them Amen they were assuming that they were right then they were presuming that God was with him Amen now see the only way Amen that they could become confidence in the thoughts that God was with them is when they left the word see the Prophet God said I just love to read the word he said because I know that the word is what we stay by it must always be the Word of God or we'll go on the wrong road season without the word Amen were another church they meant without the word were another gathering but when the word is revealed then it brings a meaning to the gathering of the people and then think this morning how many churches amen are gathered in this area amen it's a building they've got music they've got pulpits amen they've got thousands of people they met but they've got no meaning in the gathering because they're presuming amen but here we are this morning we may just be a handful of people ain't meant but in the house of God this morning it's some believers that didn't come here hope and God was going to be here amen but they come here knowing God was going to be here because if his where it is welcome then he is welcomed by the think this morning Amen that the word of the Lord Amen comes to the Prophet now Amos 3:7 even the Bible says surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret Amen unto his servants the prophets revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound he meant the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets amen see then a prophet comes along and says what is a prophet he said a prophet is a diviner of the word see he's not a diviner of your feelings he's not a diviner of your emotions or sensation he meant but he is a diviner of the word and he says seek then there's no higher order they meant to reveal the word than a prophet Amen I'm just laying a foundation here Amen we're just kind of getting to know each other this morning amen outset this way I'll set the way the Prophet said notice not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message see the first pull healing Amen the second pull prophesied Amen the third pull was the opening of the word he said the mysteries revealed no higher order amen to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the Prophet can be vindicated is by the word amen see the third pull I love this amen and remember the third pour was the opening of him seven seals to reveal the hidden truth that's been sealed in the word Amen I think of this this morning there's three pools he meant there's a first pool which was healing there's a second pool which was prophesy and there's a third pool he said which was the opening of the word not now watch this you are a triune beam Amen your body you are spirit and your soul amen now listen friends you know as well as I know that first pool Amen was dealing with the flesh Amen it was dealing with the flesh source of sickness there he meant that second pool was dealing with discernment which broke into the spirits amen but when you come to that third pill it is dealing with forward which has got to be not in your flesh Amen not in your spirits Amen but the word is got to be anchored in your soul and I say this morning church if the word is not in the church this is just the building and Devils can have their way amen but if the word is here we can stand up and say Satan in the name of Jesus Christ by the authority for the word of the Living God we take jurisdiction over the church my what an honor to be living in and then what a time when the word has come back to the church amen we are not here this morning amen just reading the Bible and then your pastor has not been preaching all these years just reading scriptures amen but there's an authority behind this pulpit amen what put authority behind it the message of the hour and then I feel good this morning amen you find then what happens is is when a prophet comes amen demons begin to tremble they met when a prophet comes hell gets nervous they met when a prophet comes on the scene amen now let's just preacher for a second Amen because the idea of a prophets greatly changed from Bible times till today admit when a prophet showed up in Bible times amen it wasn't a happy go lucky day and then it wasn't God's gonna bless you in the bank accounts gonna when a prophet showed up God meant business amen and I thank God that in the last days when the world had fallen under an error Amen oh what a prophet is he would send a prophet among us that would not be a Hollywood evangelist amen but he would be a pillar of higher anointed man they meant to stand and take the Bible which was a symbolic book and reveal it in I'm just going to and then I'm just going to give you a disclaimer here when I get in this area I get happy payment because under a profit symbols become revelation Amen under a profits Amen it removes the element of mystery and opens up the reality of what was behind that mystery see in the fourth seal he said the book has actually been closed all the time it's there but it's still in symbols they seen it John even saw its Amen the announcement when the first come forth he said a white horse went forth he had a rider on him see he might stumble Amen it was just in a symbol he said as far as any man upon the earth that's all he could say he could only say what he saw oh brother ain't never brother Sam I remember one time I just started preaching and I was a preacher guy and I stopped preaching us I've been studying that seventh seal the third pull Amen the only word and it was just it was bubbling in me you know y'all know how it is Amen and I was preaching away and I said praise God Amen that flirt pull is here and it's in effect in the church my brother sitting over he got all bolt blowed up you know after service she said brother you better you better leave that alone there ain't no authority in that Amen you need to leave that alone he said you can't preach sides Amen I said brother I said me ask you something do you preach holiness he said of course I preach holiness I said you know why your preaching is because you see it Amen and when you see something you can't help it when you see it amen come on when you see it it's gonna ignite a fire I pray this morning Church at the same God ain't been that opened the eyes of Paul Heyman would come in this building today and he would open your eyes and you would see more than just a church you would see more than just a preacher but you would see there is a reality to this message and then I will go a step further and say when you see it you can't unsee it ain't it when you see something you can't unsee when you hear something you can't unhear it a minute I think God him in the car preached this morning I think God there is some people in this land today that has seen this message they have heard this message it is clicking the inside of their soul amen and the that they can turn away from it now they've done been behind the veil they've done laid in the Shekinah glory they've done eat the shewbread amen it's done become real to them my he might stumble he might stagger amen but when he sees it Amen he might hit here and hit there but when he sees that we find out that in the book of Revelation at the seventh angels message he says the mysteries all the mysteries of it should already be revealed by that time amen now let's just preacher this morning and then you don't know what a blessing it is to be preached to the church that you know they believe the message a minute let's just be honest and then people get scared to death of the word mystery a minute let me just tell you the reason why they get scared it's not because what brother Branham done with it because of what men behind him done with for it like the thunders Amen you say seven thunders and everybody gets halt or Amen but let me remind you Amen before there was a false teaching of the thunders there was a vindicated prophet preached in the seven thunders he meant before there was a false teaching on the seven seals there was a vindicated prophet preaching the true teacher seat then we've come to the time a meant were the backbone of this bride is those divine revealed mystery truths see that it should be revealed according to that time now in Daniel 12:4 the Bible says but now lo Daniel Amen shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end for many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased even now if you go read like the Book of Daniel you read the book of Zechariah the book of all the Old Testament prophets you're constantly reading symbols when you read the book of Zechariah he's gonna talk about golden candlesticks and lampstand you're reading about symbols amen see tonight as long as it's in symbol form amen then there's no threat to the devil amen because there's no understanding of what the symbol is in the message of seven churches Church age is how the book of Revelation how it's made up and he says see how Daniel tiles with it he said Isaiah ties it with it all the Old Testament ties in with the book of Revelation he said it's the book of the relationship Jesus Christ he said seeing mark the beach 54 remember all the revelation is in vision and symbolic he said all of it has a meaning Amen so you have to watch closely Amen read the prophets Amen see what the symbols men then compare it over here so that you'll know what the symbols really mean Amen in the pen then you say the Bible amen the Bible actually itself is a natural symbol do you realize that the cross Amon is a symbol Amen although the Bible's full of symbols they meant but what it's going to make it real to you is when the spirit that put the symbol there amen comes up on your heart and click ins the symbol you're looking at see in the message look he said what are you looking at what do you see it we must see Jesus and the only way we see Jesus is see the word Amen see this the Bible is the natural symbol of the Spirit you know what I mean it's the letter the spirit clip-ins see the letter then the Spirit quickens the letter and makes it a reality amen so then you find that there's actual order amen of how the reality comes or the revelation comes its first a symbol in heaven amen the symbol is a symbol in heaven amen men the reality comes in that symbol up on the earth are you with me this morning and then I'll catch this and then look at those three stars that lined up that was a symbol Amen that three major eyes who looked at the whole world could see those three stars amen but to the world it was symbols amen but to those major eyes it become a reality because the spirit that put the symbol there was the spirit that come upon them and said go find him that is born King of the Jews Amen see the symbol will not move the church but when the reality of that symbol comes it'll move the church it'll put a fire oh come on church it is the rising of the Sun he said you can polish it he said you can get it the best but the best cards he said like that train out there he said but what's wrong with it he said there's no gas in the engine room and then there's no fire in the engine room and I say this morning Church we can hang the pictures up we can memorize so close we can get everything just right amen but if the spirit doesn't come it's just a symbol but if the Spirit comes it becomes a reality this morning oh this should be the name of the Lord and then the Prophet says is it strange Amen that these stars were exactly in line for three men he said nobody else saw it Amen see just exactly in line and then they you realize you can look at something and not see it no doubt other people could look up there remember sewing you that they could see it but they couldn't see it Amen see and when those stars becoming unity they United themselves together in this constellation and three men a men were also anointed at the same time they meant so when God puts a symbol in the heavens he unites the people on the earth they meant to receive the revelation of that symbol are you with me he said you can be so United with God in his word until these things become realities and you see them and you know they are truth he said see signs of the time you might look right over the top of it and say our nonsense a ment but if there is a seed if there is a pull if there is a crime your soul and then God will give you the reality now you just got to realize this morning Amen I'm the older preached me and I'm trying to lay a foundation but get something John wrote the symbols they meant Daniel wrote the symbols amen Zechariah wrote the symbols amen amen Moses wrote symbols amen but as we said symbols must be revealed and the revelation of that symbol is what makes it a reality a minutes in the seventh angel of revelation 10 now what is he going to do he is going to unseal what has been sealed round now let's just take for one here in revelation 6:1 he said I saw when the lamb opened one of these seals and I heard as it were the noise of thunder one the four beasts saying come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer now if it's okay to sit this way at one point but the man preached revelation 6 as a symbol when he preaches the mighty conquer what's he doing he's preaching it under a symbolic revelation that there is a bow there is a wild horse but then the Spirit comes in the seals and says no that is not Christ that is the Antichrist that is the deceiver and he said see it became real and then seat when the Spirit come it brought it from symbol to reality and then now the first seal he picks it up and says let's just read a little bit further he reads revelation 6:1 he said when the lamb broke that first seal he set a thunder roared he said now that's got a significance it's got a meaning and he said nothing happens without a meaning alright a thunder a thunder roared wonder what happened he said see wonder what that thunder was he said now listen here he said we won't have to wonder no more brother that makes me want to put my shouting shoes home when a prophet says we won't have to wonder no more what is John 12 the hour has come that the Son of man should be glorified see you're at the end of an age there his ministry is ending he said see the hour has come that the son of man should be glorified what about the hour has come with his bride must be taken away when the angel has come that time shall be no more he said the angel is ready to set one foot on land and the other on sea where the rainbow over his head over his over him with his feet and say time has run out and besides that he raised up his hand and swore that time would be no more when this happened how perfect is it it is a sworn affidavit to the church now my soul trouble he goes on to read here in paragraph 146 then when the lamb opened took the book and the broke the first seal God spoke from his eternal throne to say what the seal was to be revealed but when it's before John it was in symbol they met now think of this when it was before John it was in symbol when John saw it it was still a mystery amen why it wasn't even revealed right then it cannot be revealed until what he said here at the end time but it comes in a symbol now morena loud clapping noise of thunder is the voice of God alright then we won't talk about thunder let's talk about it he said it's the voice of God he said that's what the Bible said it's a clap of thunder they thought it was a thunder but it was God he said see notice the first seal when it was open in the symbol for me thunder I love this now what about when it's open in its reality form Amen see if it thundered when it opened in its symbol form he said then it'll thunder when it opens in its reality form since all right he said see it thundered as soon as that lamb struck back the seal and what did it reveal not all of itself Amen see first now notice to notice the three-fold unfolding of a symbol Amen first it's with God then next it's with symbol then it's revealed three things it's coming forth from the throne first it can be seen or nothing can't be seen or nothing it's sealed up they may not now kind of preached here for a second amen if you were coming in this building here this morning and there was no lights on in here and you just walked up the aisle there was no witness it was completely dark and you're walking along by the way and all the sudden you trip and you keep on walking and you turn around and you walk back in your trip again and then though you say brother brother what no Road am i tripping over alright there's no light they meant there's no way to identify the object amen so I say brother Sam what what was brother Wade tripping over and brother Sam says well I'll tell you what I think he tripped over I think somebody left a vacuum in the middle of floor so then I said brother real Aaron what did he trip over a menace I'll tell you what I think he tripped over I think you tripped over your big shoe brother Andrew Amen now I've got to I've got two opinions amen of one symbol are you with me then I go to brother Louise I said well at least what what did what did brother Wade try what did he what did he trip home Reese well I think what it is is a piece of wood okay now we've got three opinions a mint of one symbol and which one is and then he says it's this he says it's a shoe he says it's wood he says it's a vacuum Amen you've got all these voices talking about the same thing Amen but what's going to separate amen all the voices is when there is a man here who can turn on the lights let's see then when the light comes home when the light comes on the light is not going to change what is laying there the light is only going to reveal what is laying there Amen don't you see this morning predestination was laying there seven seals were laying there and then the oneness of the Godhead was laying there but they were tripping over it's amen but there was a voice came it was the voice of the seventh angel and said this is what it is it's not a church it's a bride I'm not gonna call your church I'm gonna call your bride to think this morning it's only revealed in the last day when this actual seal is broken broken to who not to Christ but to the church see Christ knew what it was all along when John was looking at it in symbol Christ knew what it was when Daniel looked at it in symbol Christ knew what it was Amen but when the symbol become a revelation it became real to the bride Amen you simply under what do you why did you take so much time amen to speak on symbols because I want to say something to you this morning let's go this morning Amen from symbol to reality you said with Ana is it possible he says here in my little Bethlehem oh come all ye faithful we've been singing come to Bethlehem he said Lord let them see that it's not go to a little city under that once was in a symbol but let's go to the reality Jesus Christ God's bread and water of life how many will say this morning I want to go to reality amen I just don't want to sit here looking at symbols Amen come on young people as long as this message it's nothing but charts and pictures and books and tapes it'll only be a matter of time and then before you leave it amen but when it becomes a reality to you it becomes more than a Sunday School lesson it becomes more than a doctrine it becomes a fire becomes a fire that will consume and then the zeal of your house Oh blessed be the name of the Lord what an hour to be living when the reality of the word he said now the return of the Holy Spirit is bringing the word in us and it's abiding in there then it's not you that speaks it's the word itself coming out see then what is your authority spoken word church it's not your building Amen it's not your pictures on the wall your authority is this pulpit has been dedicated to this message and it has become more than symbol it has become reality Oh to think this morning man ain't meant to presume anything it means to venture without actual Authority amen or take for granted now - Vince without actual Authority or to take for granted to do something before you are authorized to do it without the actual authority to do it and then I think of something this morning the problem of God is going to introduce to us a term and he's going to call it scriptural Authority he's going to say see they have gone off without scriptural Authority they've got an authority but it's not a vindicated Authority now you think of this morning how then it comes around December time amen air back starts presume and that Christ was born on December 25th Amen see they have no they have no actual backing to base that but what they've done is because they've not found the reality it's still in symbol form Amen to them it's just as real as it is to you that he was born in April Amen see but why is it real to you because a revelation has come now you find them that probably go on and say that they actually have New Year's parties he says see what they're doing this they're celebrating presuming that their sins of the old year is gone and then I think here what this presuming do he said presuming actually produces a blanketing of the mind now when you study that you'll find that people actually practice what's called a blanketing of the mind now what it is he says as they blink in their mind and they let it become a Dale or become idle and whatever comes in is what comes in he said see like whisky is actually a blinking of the mind he said actually makes the mind become idle when it comes into that system now see the world calls it a little clean fun Amen but you got to remember that we are not commissioned Amen to let our minds become idle amen because when your mind becomes idle then demon powers can come in but the Bible said that we should meditate upon the word both day and night see he said see you just open your soul to Satan and he'll give you something he said but if you open it to Christ if he should come in here with all the intelligence he got he said closing the mind they come to him every promise in the scripture he said keep your mind alert when you come to Christ don't let it go blank the devil will make you do anything see he'll give you a sensation but you won't an experience Amen something that the Bible teaches something that's real then you find where the churches come through this morning is the problem of God since we've come to another Kadesh Barnea he said we've come to another another showdown where we're either going to go on or we're going to stay here amen brother brother waiting for fellowship and yesterday last night about it see the polygon said there was a service 3 or 4 death messengers amen that eating that tree of life down he said there were four life messengers that restored that tree back he said see the pond worm the caterpillar the cankerworm and the locusts eat it down amen but he said Luther Wesley Pentecost for life messengers he said see now watch the fourth is the word itself justification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said see and the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the person himself amen to come into the church but let me say this morning church we are not amen a Pentecostal age we are not a Pentecostal baby this morning amen the Prophet screamed as plain as I can he said see get out of the shucks and let's go to the seed there's where the life is I say this morning's hurts your kadish Barnea it's not necessarily going to be going from justification to save the vacation it's not gonna be going maybe just from st. vacation through that didn't Holy Ghost but a lot of the kata smartears is to go from the baptism of the Holy Ghost into the person himself Christ the word now when you see that the Prophet God said see what you're gonna do is read they're gonna go on brendham Tabernacle he said you're gonna go on amen to a real revival or you're gonna stay here eating the melon the leek the garlic all those things he said seat you're gonna go on are you gonna stay here he said judgment begins at the house of God now think of this who was saying that a vindicated prophet then you find that the overpowering and the overshadowing presence of Almighty God is stronger than the power of the evil one to stop you from going on see let me sit this way we will go forth in the message of the hour amen there is a people in the earth today what will their news so and so's fallen and so-and-so squit that doesn't change the facts amen that there's going to be a bride that's going to come out of the shock she is out of it shut this morning and she is in the presence of the Sun and then to think this morning their numbers 14 the Bible says that Moses would give them all together now what was Moses he was a prophet and Moses would gather them together and he would say now look here's what's gonna happen here's what's gonna happen you're going to go up and you're going to presume it's what is exactly what's going to happen and they said oh no a minute let me just read it to you this way here israel presumed that they were all right he had been a real good god he said he had been a good god he went down in egypt brought them out of bondage sure he was a good god why even Rain Man out of heaven upon him God God God a good God see it was very well but then when it come down to the time that his word was beat to fulfill see that the battle comes when the word becomes fulfilled when it comes to Kadish Barnea and the spies come back with the evidence of the land beyond then they presumed they would be alright if they would bypass that and God was angry with him and I think of this here what they're doing is they're bypassing a vindicated voice they're taking a vindicated voice and saying no Moses Noah Moses listen here's what's gonna happen we're gonna do this so we're good and we're going to carry on and Moses says but no here's what's going to happen is you're going to go up there and the Amalekites a men are going to bring you down and paraphrase said amen and what happened brother amen exactly what Moses said is what happened amen and noticed us grief notice the heartache they could have spared the cells had they listened to a vindicated voice but they bypassed that voice and said no it'll be this way it'll be okay and I'm gonna bring that to today they meant what what a bunch of grief you could spare your home let me just let me aim it I'm just going to preach for a second let me just take liberty here remind you amen that the pastor behind this pulpit it's not just his job he's not just here studying and preaching just to entertain you amen it is a vindicated voice of authority to your life a voice of authority to your home and when that man of God tells you something you shouldn't count it that's just something another idea or just another opinion but you should take that man's advice if he's a vindicated voice which he is by the message of the hour you should take it and heed to it say it make it make it tight here but it won't be the first time it's gone tight when I was preaching amen but come on church when a pastor tells you don't do that and you say oh what's he know and then what's he know about admit but he's telling you something to spare your heartache how many troubles and trials could you avoid in your life have you listened instead of presumed oh brother Andrew I don't want to I don't want instructions Amen well then what you're going to take his emotions amen and if you take emotions let's see what the Prophet said he said follow instructions not the emotions the instructions if Moses would have followed the emotions of the people they've been all over the mountain screamin Pharaoh's army when I got him but they followed the instructions then what then what brought victory amen to Israel why was Miriam dancing we won't talk about dancing let's talk about dancing why was Miriam dancin she was not dancing amen because of who she was she was not that her dance was not produced Amen because of a feeling her dance was produced because somebody had a voice and it was a vindicated voice and they followed instructions brother sister I'll tell you what you want to shout start following instructions amen you want to dance start following instructions amen you want to see revival amen start following instructions you say then you're making this legalism no I'm not in an age where nobody wants headship if you raise up and say don't do it they'll do it in your face Amen but here's the mystery of it there is a bride on the earth that is recognized headship by the mrs. Baur oh brother sister we've come to headship this morning amen seat than what this presuming come from presuming comes from fear the Prophet said see he said borderline believers actually paraphrase that are actually presume errs they come so far and they think well I'm okay I don't need to go no further but they're presuming they are okay admit not now it amazed me when he preaches presuming he actually turns it and he says now you take a young lady in the church and then I'm not going to take time to read it here because it's right in front of me if you wanted but he says see he said you take a young lady in the church and he said maybe she leans a little bit towards the world he said then there should be elder women in the church that she can look to as an example now here in an amazing and I mean let me let me just let me share some within isn't amazing you can have a church full of young ladies you can have a church full of women you can have you can have a sister in there brother wait she prays three times a day she listens to tapes she's an old-fashioned prayer warrior she comes to church on time ooh amen amen always faithful amen always behind the word always helping the church she can be there for years amen and young girls looking at her and never one time want to be like her but you let a girl a woman come in church it gets an old lust spirit owner and she made me a deacons wife or she may be a trustees lifer or some position of life and she puts on a pair of high heels and then she trims ends of her hair puts a little makeup on and every girl in the church will start looking at that and say you know what we can do that and you know what they're doing they're presuming you know why well she's a deacons wife she can do it and if she can do it so can i but let me tell you something charts let's get away from presuming and let's get back to the word and then for the word is our example the word is our standard I don't care what you do you shouldn't care what I do it's what the word says Amen and if what we're doing is wrong then let's do what a prophet said and humble ourselves and come back to the word and say God what I was doing was wrong but your word is right they've been see what brother and ER they can do it and they're still blessed of God let me remind you that the blessings of God is no sign let me step this way the blessings of God has been reduced the sign of God's blessings has been reduced to sunny skies being the son of God's approval and cloudy skies being the sign of God's disapproval but do you realize the very day is will disbelieve it still rain man out of heaven the very day that they went against the word the manna fell just the same so because you're getting blessed does it mean that you're in the will of God amen because you're getting blessed doesn't mean that you're that you're in the approval of God you got to come back to the plumb line which is the word and then I think of what David says in Psalm 37 37 he says mark the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of that man is peace and then see young people if I could share something with you that help me man it's marked somebody amen mark somebody that you see in this message mark somebody that you see this faithful don't mark people that show up when they walk - well let's have church we got up and got ready we might as well Amen don't mark people that church can't rely upon mark somebody and say God whatever they've got that keeps them going when the world is against them whatever they've got Amen that causes them to praise you is what I want in my life in my heart in my family I don't want to be a presume and believer I want to be a vindicated scriptural authority believer he says what we need today to be spiritual as a person that will humble themselves before God if they haven't got a penny they will pray to that spirit within them is satisfied with the goodness of God and the revival takes place only inside their heart that changes their attitudes and atmosphere that they live in now think of this Sampson was born under an hour's arrival but you realize what Samson done Sampson he began to presume when he lied to Delilah each time Sampson lied he had the false blaring nothing's going to happen nothing's gonna happen I'll just keep on lying I'll just keep on going and before long when they come time for power there was no power there you know why because the Prophet said Sampson presumed that he could just do anything and just get by with it why is the church world in the condition they're in this morning is because they presume that we can do what we want to and just get by with it but that's not coming from a voice of authority then he turns and says the same thing the church had when Samson arose and shook himself he found out God wasn't there let me see this one in church God does not presume but God consumes amen they'll say for our God is a consuming fire see it's consuming and you are God's sacrifice then how the supreme authority come to believer comes by the word or or listen or two to the believer with faith to receive the things that we pray for let's look here at mark 11:24 the Bible says therefore I say unto you what things you so ever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them now look at what this word receive means I'm I'm watching time something will be much longer will it cure what the word receive means it means to take with a hand to lay hold of any person or anything in order to use it to take up a thing to be carried to take up on oneself to take in order to carry away see it without the notion of violence now I just said this way our strength Amen lays in the full assurance that the God who made the promise is able to keep the promise that now Holy Ghost reveals himself to you by keeping his promise it's not shouting it's not dancing though we believe in those things so we love those things the Holy Ghost reveals himself to you by keeping his promise the brothers said through the Holy Ghost he said when there comes a time that God through the Holy Ghost reveals Christ back in the church with the power and demonstrations of healing the sick and making signs he said what if all the believers come to pass then Satan turns over in his bed he does something about it until that time Satan don't care how much church you join he don't care how much you do when Christ reveals to you cold-cut when Christ reveals to you that he is the son of God and the works that he did you do also not some other words but the same works seaton an authority comes by the identification of the Holy Ghost you say well Andrew nobody in the church will give me any time when that went well am I am i holding too long can I kind of few moments hey little brother Andrew I'll tell you what glory to God I got before somebody was demon-possessed and I looked him in the eyes and I told him Satan kind of and nothing happened if you ain't got the Holy Ghost the devil ain't scared of you if you ain't got the Holy Ghost it down you can you can throw Bibles you can put oil you can stomp you can spit I was down ten poets can't blast you you some of y'all was there young people remember that prayer line I was preaching there Sunday morning after the prayer line Saturday night I come in the in the office that morning brother Tim was sitting there and I said he said yeah I said man we had had a prayer line last night I said yeah I said I left about halfway through it he said yeah he said notice he said last night we had five or six or more demonic manifestations now I know people said Belinda if you go to prayer lines you need getting the Holy Ghost you know that's going back to Pentecost no it's not a prophet of God still had a prayer lines at the end of his ministry he said brother he said five or six he said I don't know how many how many even after the kids left the door whether the dorms demons raised it up I said brother tell Matt something in it he said but here's what I want to say you know brother Timmy took out things he said but bear what no one of them got the victory over us he said there was no one of them got to victory he said now let me tell you this he said there was one raised up in a young man and he said there were people down there screaming and they were a holler and they were they were throwing all they were they were screaming shut up and they were screaming don't speak and brother wait he said I sit there for a few minutes and he said all of a sudden to peace come over me and he said I just stood up and I walk down there and he said I looked at that boy that was had that demon in him and I looked him in the eyes and I looked at that demon and I said go and he said when I said go the boy fell limp and can I testify to you today that same boy it's still delivered and it's not how loud you holler it's not how much you throw it's an authority and the devil recognizes if our young people you want to do something the church get the Holy Ghost you want to change the atmosphere get the Holy Ghost it'll bring in a fire it'll settle a peace in your heart my what is supreme authority amen supreme authority is an office that someone holds that is superior to all others Amen don't get mad at me but if you got the Holy Ghost this morning you are more superior than Donald Trump if you've got the Holy Ghost this morning you've got more authority come on church we saw that manifestation of authority over in Finland when the doctor said he was dead and the paramedics were there and a prophet knelt down and said I'd been here before I'd seen this intervention brother BAM didn't run around jumping screaming aiming to kick in the boy a man pulling cars over he said Satan in the name of Jesus Christ I assure you and I called for life amen to come back in this boy's body and the boy got up come on church brother wait I love to tell that story but you know what brother Dale my favorite part to tell about that story is when the problem that God said you could line to every devil in hell up you could line to everyone including the devil himself and you still could have not stopped that boy from raising back to life oh then spoken words hurts may I tell you this morning let ever demon in Hell let ever imp inhale let ever dark spirited hell surround itself around this building but if the Holy Ghost is here this morning the devil don't stand a chance oh I'm rejoicing this morning to know there is no limits on God amen all power is given unto me in heaven earth go you therefore teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father the Son the Holy Ghost and teach them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I am with You alway even at the end of the world he said see and then I'm coming to a close now then seven messengers hey men amen let me I better be careful saying I'm coming to a close she you said that at homers you come to a close because his musicians come amen amen I notice this horse had no guy close five times he said we ain't doing that again it's not me doing that you gotta love Homer amen they speak in act upon his authority he said see he stands behind them that's you this morning what brother and are the only person with authority was those seven messengers but get this there was not a Holy Ghost that Paul had and then a different Holy Ghost for the Ephesians and that the same Holy Ghost that Paul had was the same Holy Ghost the Ephesians had and I'm going to bring it to today the same Holy Ghost that William Branham had it's the same Holy Ghost young man you gots they then the same Holy Ghost is here this morning he still heals the sick for the Lord he still casts out Devils he still gives the Holy Ghost he still changes hearts he still restores marriages I say this morning that the same pillar of fire come in this building and dry that area and believe in spirit and watch God give you an authority over that spirit against you there's a voice of authority coming this day that said no need to look back look up don't look back to Alan and Cole and and schambach oh no look up aint better look up amen because the same God that was here with William random it's the god of the larger dead is the God of Elijah dead Elijah's God is not dead he's here this morning their authority headship leadership direction has come my you love him this morning a man we're not a headless body this morning we got a direction we're not going in circles this morning we know who we are we know what we believe Rylander how can you say that Amen I'm just gonna I'm just gonna go ahead go here even because I believe we're here this morning you look at revelation tenth chapter I'm gonna close with this here revelation tenth chapter in the first verse we are that body but without a head a body is going nowhere without a head the body does not function without a head there is no operation but when headship comes Authority comes look with me in Revelation 10 1 and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven a man clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire now how many knows but I was going to come in 1965 and preach a message called this day this scripture is fulfilled now it amazed me brother Dale is that real event actually preaches that in Arizona in January then he comes to Jeffersonville in February and preaches it again now if you listen to it in Arizona for the way sometimes I listen to that about cry you know why because the Prophet is preaching the word and they're not saying man it's like it's like it's just going out and falling that you don't hear no response amen but notice what he does he takes that same message back to Jeffersonville and he takes a Luke the fourth chapter he said as it was the custom of the Lord Jesus he went into the temple on the Sabbath and he found the place that was written and he read notice where Jesus when he went back remember subscription of compound meaning rights he went back to the place he come out of Jesus went back to the place that probably ridiculed him the most was the very place that he had dinner fide himself from the word as the Messiah they didn't tell me the RAM in Arizona that Tabernacle is going to be a car garage but in Jeffersonville they said in just a few days they meant that that car grab that building will be a car garage amen but a prophet comes back and he says but around the world from this pulpit has gone a message that is built revival tires up on every hill and he takes Revelation 10:1 and he says and another mighty angel comes down now how many knows that actually happened in 1963 I went back and asked the brother if he could give me that picture before but when when it first appeared in Life magazine when you see this here and then I'm gonna close with this but I feel good whew but when you see this picture here it appears there in Arizona and the font of God said they took pictures of it he said they studied it he said kids was let out of school now what is this brother it's a symbol it's a symbol there's a symbol here rub em said see he said it appeared there he said now it but but if you look at it it's a symbol what does it mean nothing mean here's ever heard of a name brother Ed hunter for that hunter is actually out of money in the end he's a pastor they're retired now the brother Ed was actually from Texas and he followed brother brems meetings he would drive from Texas I live here him and sister Billy talked about it let's say we had to go from Texas all the way to Jeffersonville and back brother had said now people won't drive the six minutes to go to church heesu we were driving about 16 hours he said but there was he said there was such a quickening power there there was such a fire coming he said well Andrew he said I remember after this picture was taken he said that it began to get among the people member amen they made copies of it now what I love about this is brother had said they had pictures on the morning of the rising of the Sun 1965 he said they had pictures out front I actually went out and sit down with him I super then I want you to tell me that's the way your memories he got happy telling it again he surrendered he said they had pictures he was all out from the tabernacle he was all looking at him he said people was running around there saying do you see that angel he said then one run over and say do you see this he said everybody was out there he said they were turn it this way and that way and look at he said they were looking every which way and they weren't seeing what they were supposed to see he said so we all came in the tabernacle and he said brother Evan gets up and says now there's a picture gotten out what was taking place there he said I went to Jack Moore and I said Jack what is this he said man that's Jesus Christ his glorified body he said that bit and ring a bell you know why because no offense but Jack Moore was a theologian but the word of the Lord comes to a prophet he meant the revelation of the word comes to a prophet and the Prophet said and I went back in my room and then he came he came and he said now take that picture and turn it to the right he said no when I turned it to the rides there it is and I love these next words he says that's our Lord up there hey that's our Lord up there and what is our Lord our Lord his headship come on church when you see that oh brother they can call it smoke they can call it a cloud they can call it a fiction of our imagination but there is one and then there is one young guy here in front of you this morning that they will never talk me out of that because it has become more than a symbol it is headship I love what he says he says and since the revelation come our home has not been without one over the Ender that's a picture it may still be a picture to you but to the bride its headship it's Christ it's our Lord its direction it's a prophet announcing the days of presuming is over presuming days are over brother we now know what he was talking about we now know the truth even listen to him say in just a few days we'll know the truth on marriage and divorce no I'm not gonna preach on this Oh relax we're knowing the truth on serpents aids what is it direction is coming let me just leave you at this this morning message churches are not just churches they're the only place left on the earth that there is still a thority when it comes to Christianity brother Andrew you're getting pretty you're getting pretty far out there with the message well I'll tell you why because if it never becomes a reality to you somehow I'll talk you out of it I've been there I've been there I get my heart Lord I was nine years old nine years old started preached when I was 13 raised in the message brother I heard tapes all my life heard the message I knew it I heard it but there's gonna come a time you got to make a stand brother now I had this idea that we preach and travel when the Lord called me Gras I never could come to concept that what I heard on those tapes if you preached it people disagree with you really I couldn't wrap my mind I thought my lord is a vindicated prophet it's coming from the scriptures man when I heard him say you're the sinless spotless bride of Jesus Christ I couldn't wait to get to a pulpit and say and it's a church do you know what a prophet said about you he said you the bride you don't have one sin against you well berliner you gotta be careful yeah but here's what I've come to and this is where you've got to come to a revelation in your heart but if the closest person to you tries to talk you out of it you'll say you're not taking my authority you're not taking my authority this message is our authority probably God close sisters Jesus Christ is in this building tonight he said perform miracles but he does it through his churches people they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover in my name they shall cast out evil spirits is that right the Commission's given to the church that's what the matter with the church today it doesn't know its position if you know positionally who you was and what you are tonight there wouldn't be a feeble person in here in the next five minutes that's right the thing of it is you're looking off into a millennium for something to happen when it's already here now we are the sons of God not we will be we are right now when this not right now this minute we were seated together and handle their places in Christ Jesus so if you'd only recognize that and the supreme authority and the supreme aside less a supreme authority that Jesus Christ has given to every believer anything you have desire of need of only thing you have to do is ask and then run around and jump and holler and try to figure out we believe in those things but a prophet said ask and receive it what several things you desire when you pray believe I say this morning Church let this message become more than a symbol let it become a reality let it let it become authority you you mamas lady become Authority to you when that baby is running the temperature the meal today let this this Holy Ghost that you've got be an authority to lay your hand on your child say Satan stop in the maintenance you ain't coming no further brothers let this message being a party to you to go home and say hey these things ain't gonna be in this home these books ain't gonna be read in this home this music come on Church this message come to give it may what good is it there to have a church building full of authority if our homes you're not churches of homes of authority let it become an authority to this mornin do you love him today as the musicians come don't presume this morning let the Spirit of God take the symbol and turn it and you see it this morning for yourself young person don't let this message just be a bunch of books and tapes to you but the Spirit of God come in your heart this morning um didn't change one thing in that picture when he turned to the right he didn't change one detail in that picture what changed the way he was looking at it the position of it I know this is simple and I know you've heard this hundreds of times remember Eber I'm talking about that sculptor he said he was all looking at it couldn't see it they were looking at and looking at and looking at it and they couldn't see it they couldn't see it they're trying to figure it out he said man come by he said my brother he says actually what you got to do is you got to get down he said then you got to look up he's problem was they were standing up looking down he said had to get down look up don't you thank God for a simple profit just get down and look up oh brother I don't understand all this I don't understand why the brother brother wait show me preach on the feast I don't understand why they're going I don't understand my brother brother Dale's preacher I don't I don't understand it I'm looking at it let me ask you how you're looking at it you take a young lady that's actually look at it holding his standards if she's looking at it from standing up looking down she's gonna argue with it when she gets down humbles herself to the word it says Lord this is your word I humbled myself to it I believe personally this morning a great victory in a lot of hearts and lives could be a good dose and baptism of humility humble myself humble thyself in this something really Dale where the paper says the cry of the ages I'm wrong when everybody's screaming I'm right I'm right I'm right that probably comes along and says but what you should be saying is I'm wrong I'm wrong her two brothers say one time it's always stuck with me it's become real to me he said sometimes I'll get down the study or sit in my office to study he said one thing I realized I do is I do a lot of repenting a little bit of studying yeah I'm wrong but Bertram's right I was looking at it wrong but that's right you want to fall in love with Jesus again this morning you want to you want that fire back about serving the Lord you want to zeal this morning real and rather preachers have

feet with us today how many believes the pillar of fire still with the church I don't believe it's in the grave this morning I believe it's right here I think of how you you may have heard the testimony before but brother Ron Spencer had a man in his church who died he was a a real real godly man loved the Lord heard the Lord he died it they had a funeral there for him in the church and they brought his casket before the church they were having the funeral and some people had sent flowers and the flowers were laying around the casket you may have heard this brother brother on tells it the testimony comes he says well the funeral was going on the pillar of fire come right in there man what kind of life did you live when the pillar of fire comes to your funeral pillar of fire come right in there but Ron said that pillar of fire I said it just come down and it kind of just swooped right across that those flowers nose to that casket and when it did there were flowers there that hadn't opened up yet they were still closed but when the pillar of fire come by over there and the flowers just busted open they just they just bloom right there about to catch a second wind are you

things Lord as I was preaching this morning they just come to my heart he said don't ever get to the point you can't get down and look up to the message don't ever come to a spot you can't humble yourself and look up at the message he said many men stand behind the pulpit and look down at it and don't see it but arrogance and pride they keep trying to promote what they don't see and cause confusion Oh God I've shaped my life by that not just in ministry but in everything help me today dear God not to presume lord help us today father Lord young man young lady sure today God Lord no
