[22:12] Church ages um starting probably next
[22:16] Sunday if you want to read the church AE
[22:18] book just go ahead and read it and uh
[22:21] and get you a uh get your head start on
[22:23] the curriculum so John 1:1 in the
[22:25] beginning was the word the word was with
[22:27] God and the word was God and that same
[22:29] was in the beginning with God all things
[22:32] were made by him and without him was not
[22:34] anything made that was made and that
[22:37] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[22:39] and we beheld his glory the glory of the
[22:40] only begotten of the father full of
[22:42] grace and truth you may be SE in the
[22:44] Lord His blessings to the reading of the
[22:46] word Colossians 1:12 as we were saying
[22:49] this
[22:49] morning Paul is the way he articulates
[22:53] this is just so important because he's
[22:55] he's talking to the Colossians he said
[22:58] give thanks giving thanks unto the
[23:00] Father which made us meet to be
[23:01] partakers as I was praying just now we
[23:04] have been made to be partakers of this
[23:06] great Gospel of this great um Revelation
[23:10] in this hour that that 99% of the
[23:13] world's not even privileged to as we
[23:15] were talking about Wednesday night
[23:17] there's many cities that that I go
[23:19] through when I go to Illinois and you
[23:20] know hunting and like Paduka and
[23:22] beautiful places that you think man they
[23:24] need not a church there at all right a
[23:28] church there at all brother Brandon
[23:30] preached in Elizabeth Town which is not
[23:32] far from where we from where we go um
[23:35] Kentucky but other than that
[23:38] nothing they got the big Bible schools
[23:41] and the big colleges and all those
[23:42] things
[23:43] and God know where to be
[23:47] seen be glad that's right you better
[23:50] thank God every day that he's even give
[23:53] you an opportunity not just that you're
[23:55] doing it but he gave you an opportunity
[23:57] to hear that's right what he said in
[23:59] this hour he give it to us now I ask you
[24:03] what are you going to do with it what
[24:04] are we going to do with it all right
[24:05] it's our responsibility now though that
[24:07] he gave it to us more is what more is
[24:10] given more is required all right so we
[24:14] can't say we don't we we don't know
[24:16] we're going to act like them out there
[24:18] because we don't understand no no no
[24:22] we've been called to a higher plane
[24:25] amen and when we read the Bible we read
[24:28] it with more as Paul wrote it in in so
[24:31] much Zeal we should read it in so much
[24:34] Zeal that it's it's the Eternal Word of
[24:36] God it'll never change it'll always be
[24:39] there so let's look at verse 13 WHO hath
[24:42] delivered us from the power of darkness
[24:44] and have translated us as we were
[24:46] talking this morning transpose or
[24:49] transfer remove from one place to
[24:51] another now he didn't remove your soul
[24:53] and put another one in and he didn't
[24:54] take your soul and put it somewhere else
[24:56] no just that that old adamic nature that
[24:59] old as we were talking this morning that
[25:00] cloud that brother Bri said come in and
[25:02] and clouded up and muddied up that that
[25:05] soul that you were born with
[25:08] perfect
[25:10] kids but you had to come to time of the
[25:13] place to where you knew right and wrong
[25:15] and then right and wrong you either keep
[25:16] the cloud there or you get rid of the
[25:18] cloud one of the two all right so
[25:20] there's a cloud of Darkness that's on
[25:22] all of us if we're not born again all
[25:24] right but thank God we've been
[25:26] translated as Paul said into the kingdom
[25:30] of his dear son so we've been translated
[25:32] into a kingdom not just a not just a
[25:34] church but a kingdom we've been
[25:37] translated into that and whom we have
[25:39] Redemption through his blood the
[25:40] Forgiveness of sins who is the image of
[25:43] the invisible God the firstborn of every
[25:45] creature not the second person of the
[25:48] Trinity come on that's right CU that's
[25:50] the world thinks that he's the second
[25:52] person of the Trinity no he's the
[25:54] firstborn of every creature the
[25:55] invisible God the Creator Jesus Christ
[25:58] amen we know him as that
[26:01] now for by him were all things created
[26:03] in heaven Earth visible invisible
[26:05] Thrones dominions principalities Powers
[26:08] all things were created by Him and for
[26:11] him now remember what does Satan do he
[26:13] perverts everything that God creates all
[26:16] right and he is before all things and by
[26:18] him all things consist and he is the
[26:21] head of the body of the church now like
[26:22] I said this morning Paul now has brought
[26:24] it down to tell the Colossians hey there
[26:26] is a great God there is a a a Creator
[26:29] there is one that did all this and made
[26:31] everything you see but he's right here
[26:33] now but he's right here he's not over
[26:36] there he's right here and he's the head
[26:38] of the body of the church who is the
[26:39] beginning the firstborn from the dead
[26:41] that in all things he might have the
[26:42] preeminence for it pleased the father
[26:44] that in him should all fullness dwell
[26:47] and like we were talking about this
[26:48] morning with Adam Adam was Adam was a
[26:52] created being he he had a a body that as
[26:55] brother R said it looked like a a tree
[26:57] sticking in the ground his toes went
[26:58] into the ground cuz see that's where
[27:00] Adam came up out of the 16 elements of
[27:02] the earth and God just pulled his body
[27:04] up and and I held it there for a little
[27:07] while and throw that uh
[27:11] breath and he became a living person
[27:14] then he breathed into his nostrils and
[27:16] he became a living Soul as we were
[27:18] talking about this
[27:21] morning
[27:23] Eternal spiritually he breathed into him
[27:27] and made him an eternal person with God
[27:29] that we read that this morning so you
[27:32] and I though are
[27:34] born as a baby then we have to come up
[27:38] and then we have a breath a natural
[27:40] breath that we breathe and then we have
[27:42] a spiritual breath that when we come to
[27:44] the baptism of the Holy Ghost he
[27:45] breathes on us as he did at Pentecost he
[27:48] breathed on them and said receive ye the
[27:50] Holy Ghost and then on the day of
[27:51] Pentecost that became a reality all
[27:55] right they breathed the Breath of God
[28:00] the Church of God is born of the Breath
[28:02] of God God breathed breath into the
[28:04] nostril spiritually of Adam and he
[28:06] became a living Soul did you know the
[28:08] Pentecostals or true Pentecostal church
[28:10] is born by the Breath of God he went all
[28:12] the way back to Pentecost to tell us
[28:14] that originally that Pentecostal group
[28:16] we'll look at it when we get into the
[28:17] church ages that's the way the church
[28:19] was supposed to been set up amen all
[28:22] right that was the way it supposed to
[28:23] been set up and what happened it got
[28:25] eroded down through the church ages
[28:27] those two spirits come back in together
[28:30] come on somebody and they actually
[28:32] resided sometimes right together and
[28:35] rode their s all the way through those
[28:37] Church ages till we come to the end time
[28:39] where a prophet of God had to say nope
[28:41] there goes one going that way here
[28:44] stands the Lamb with a book in his hand
[28:46] so therefore that can't be God can't be
[28:48] two people one's got to be God one's got
[28:50] to be the devil remember when he said if
[28:52] you see two people one's God and one's
[28:54] the devil all right so that's what he
[28:56] was telling us and and even Jesus had
[28:58] told us in Matthew
[28:59] 24 he said Beware false Christ first
[29:03] thing right off the GetGo we'll read it
[29:05] here in just a few minutes but we know
[29:07] now I hope we everybody understands that
[29:08] the logos is the speech of God and the
[29:11] theophany is the form that God took so
[29:13] that you and I can understand who he is
[29:15] and then as brother bandam says one time
[29:17] he calls him King theophany that
[29:19] theophany is where you and I emanate
[29:21] from that are born
[29:24] again amen you understand me that are
[29:26] born again cuz everybody emanates from
[29:29] God by breath and by life right I read
[29:33] the SC I read it where brother Brown
[29:34] said he gives you a soul and a spirit
[29:36] all right but it's not Eternal right but
[29:40] until he gets to the age of
[29:41] accountability it's
[29:43] covered all right and all babies go to
[29:45] heaven as we were talking about this
[29:47] morning I hope you see that and I hope
[29:49] you appreciate that I appreciate what
[29:51] God's done like that to put people in
[29:54] heaven when they really didn't have a
[29:55] place for them amen amen really but he
[29:59] said no all babies brother said no all
[30:01] babies go to heaven do we understand
[30:03] that but that theophany
[30:07] was the word body and then that word
[30:10] body when he put part of it in Adam he
[30:13] was getting ready now to put the rest of
[30:15] it through
[30:18] Adam everybody with me through Adam and
[30:21] Eve were going to
[30:23] produce God's
[30:25] children amen
[30:28] right had there not been a fall but now
[30:31] since there was a fall he Adam and Eve
[30:33] and then he had to stop cuz it was not
[30:35] they become
[30:36] unworthy that cloud came down and came
[30:39] between them and it became so Smoky to
[30:42] to God couldn't see sin anymore so he
[30:44] put the atonement there of a blood of an
[30:47] animal to to not take away but to cover
[30:50] sin until he could come and take away
[30:54] sin all right is everybody with me on
[30:56] that that's just Elementary but we got
[30:57] to get to
[30:58] that John 1:8 says no man has seen God
[31:02] at any time the only begotten son which
[31:03] is in the bosom of the father he ha
[31:05] declared him or unfolded a teach Jesus
[31:09] stood that day it just I see how brother
[31:12] Brandon was frustrated sometimes we all
[31:14] get frustrated but I know how Jesus was
[31:15] frustrated he was he was talking to the
[31:17] most religious people
[31:20] yeah chosen
[31:23] people he told his disciples don't go
[31:25] out there he said go to these people
[31:28] right here they're my people that's
[31:31] right right the Jewish people they're my
[31:33] people go to the house of Israel and try
[31:37] to save them and they're the ones that
[31:39] hung him on the
[31:40] cross he stood in their church and
[31:43] preached and they got so mad at him they
[31:44] tried to Stone
[31:48] him kicked him out of every synagogue
[31:50] there was and he was preaching the
[31:53] unadulterated word of God he was saying
[31:55] where have I missed it
[31:58] where have I missed
[32:00] it take all the Old Testament y'all know
[32:03] you know I know he looked at me said
[32:04] look y'all know the Old
[32:07] Testament he said I
[32:10] it but they hated him for saying that he
[32:14] said before before Abraham was I am well
[32:16] he would took him all the way back to
[32:17] Abraham right that's when they said oh
[32:20] you're not even 50 years old how'd you
[32:22] get back there how' Abraham see you he
[32:24] said Abraham actually wanted to see this
[32:28] day right and see all the prophets now
[32:32] as they're standing they're over into
[32:34] their Dimension they wanted to see this
[32:36] day cuz Isaiah and all the different
[32:38] ones that can look and see and could see
[32:41] way up into the future to
[32:43] hear right
[32:45] here and Jesus stood one day and he said
[32:49] have I not declared
[32:51] everything that my father told y'all in
[32:53] other words Jehovah god Jehovah God told
[32:55] y'all all this
[32:57] he said but you know what he said you
[32:59] acting just like you're supposed to
[33:01] because your fathers put my prophets in
[33:04] the tombs right so you're going to in
[33:06] other words so you're going to put me in
[33:07] there too cuz you're mad at me
[33:11] too then Paul stands one day and he said
[33:13] look are y'all mad at me because I tell
[33:16] you the
[33:17] truth he got mad at Jesus so they're
[33:19] going to get mad at you they're going to
[33:20] get mad at me anybody else just stands
[33:22] here and tells the
[33:24] truth
[33:25] right
[33:28] to recount or
[33:29] rehearse Jesus was God and he the father
[33:34] whatever the father was inside of him
[33:36] when it moved he
[33:38] moved right
[33:41] man cuz listen as some say that Jesus
[33:45] wasn't god Till The River Jordan I was
[33:46] thinking about this yesterday so now if
[33:48] brother Brandon if we
[33:49] take got an itch where's my wife she'll
[33:53] be home in a little bit she's on her way
[33:54] she's in a she's out of Augusta now so
[33:56] she's she'll be on her way in a few
[33:57] minutes but
[34:00] um forgot my
[34:03] thought we'll get back to it a
[34:06] minut John 14:16 said I'll pray the
[34:09] father and he'll give you another
[34:10] comforter that he may abide with you
[34:12] forever even the spirit of Truth this is
[34:15] what I added in because
[34:17] of so important that that Jesus had to
[34:20] go away had to go away he said it's
[34:22] expedient that I must leave you right
[34:25] cuz I can't come back and stand in your
[34:27] temple by myself and do these
[34:30] works right I'm going to have to declare
[34:32] them through you and I can't be here at
[34:34] the same time so I'm going to send a
[34:36] comforter the spirit of Truth whom the
[34:39] look whom the world cannot receive so if
[34:41] you're born again today the world can't
[34:44] receive
[34:47] you the world can't they don't they
[34:50] don't
[34:55] understand because it seeth him not
[34:59] neither knoweth him and there Jesus was
[35:01] declaring him the whole time never came
[35:03] any other way but what the scripture
[35:04] says so will you if we be become born
[35:07] again and we start living the word of
[35:09] God that's Jesus Christ walking in human
[35:12] flesh again whether you believe that or
[35:13] not prophet of God said deity now
[35:16] resides in
[35:19] us I have to believe what he says I
[35:21] can't believe what I say I have to
[35:23] believe what he says all right but you
[35:25] know him now look
[35:29] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[35:31] him but ye know him for he dwelleth with
[35:34] you and shall be in you all right I will
[35:38] not leave you comfortless I will come to
[35:42] you if you have the baptism of the Holy
[35:44] Ghost today he has come to you to not
[35:47] just anoint you but to reside in you
[35:51] amen yet a little while and the world
[35:53] seeth me no more but You See Me Now list
[35:56] listen that got locked
[36:00] up that got locked up at
[36:03] nah cuz they saw him as one God right
[36:07] here when the Holy Ghost came back on
[36:09] the day of Pentecost they were not
[36:12] trinitarians but 300 years later at Nia
[36:15] and then 600 years after that they
[36:16] adopted it will come a saying a deed and
[36:19] a Doctrine we'll get into it in just a
[36:20] little bit with the with the church ages
[36:22] that's why we really got to cover that
[36:24] to show again how that thing got got
[36:27] separated and how how Satan came right
[36:29] back
[36:30] in and run right along with the
[36:34] bride and has until this
[36:37] day that's why brother R said you got a
[36:40] church over here and I got a bride over
[36:41] here this is the characteristics of the
[36:43] two but you see me because I live you
[36:46] shall live also at that day the prophet
[36:49] of God said this day you shall
[36:51] know where I'm at and what I'm doing
[36:55] where I'm at
[36:57] that's pretty much what he says here
[36:58] okay at that day you shall know that I
[37:00] am in my father and ye in me and I in
[37:03] you do we believe that
[37:06] amen do you believe that s when you get
[37:09] up you can't hardly move your hand CU
[37:10] it's all numb I thought I was the only
[37:12] one it went through
[37:13] that man I can't I can't hold nothing I
[37:16] it just they have
[37:18] to sit there and shake it
[37:20] and anyhow good to be
[37:24] alive he that have my Commandments and
[37:27] keepeth them he it is that loveth me and
[37:31] he that loveth me shall be loved of my
[37:33] father and I will love him and will look
[37:36] and will manifest myself to him that's
[37:39] why God came to you at the new birth he
[37:41] not only gave you the new birth he gave
[37:43] you this messag yes amen he came to
[37:47] you knowing you'd be one of the only
[37:50] ones that would take it and take it to
[37:52] heart right right Judah said unto him
[37:55] now not as carrot Lord Lord how is it
[37:57] that thou will manifest thyself unto us
[38:00] and not unto the
[38:01] world Jesus answered and said if a man
[38:03] love me he will keep my
[38:07] words pretty
[38:09] simple listen I I thinking about
[38:11] yesterday we we can have all these great
[38:15] Revelations okay we we and we
[38:18] do yet we can't come to church can't
[38:22] study can't read our
[38:23] Bible can't can't pray we can't we can't
[38:27] do the simple things take communion wash
[38:29] and all those things there's no way
[38:31] you'll ever go higher than that without
[38:35] those institutions being put in your
[38:37] life right you can't listen this ain't a
[38:40] skip
[38:42] gospel this ain't a I get to go past the
[38:44] third grade because I'm
[38:47] smart no you got to go through the third
[38:50] grade fourth grade fifth grade sixth
[38:53] grade justification sanctification
[38:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost faith virtue
[38:57] knowledge Temperance patience godliness
[38:59] brotherly kindness you can't skip to
[39:01] where I'm
[39:04] perfect if you ever think you too
[39:06] perfect to go to church or take
[39:07] communion you're lost that's right the
[39:10] devil has got you he's not playing with
[39:13] you he's got you cuz he plays with me
[39:15] all the time you really don't need to go
[39:17] up there they not even paying attention
[39:18] to you and they going to fall asleep so
[39:20] I can
[39:23] service if a man loved me he will keep
[39:26] my words we're going to keep going right
[39:28] Don he
[39:31] go put a put a put your ink pin right
[39:36] there and my father will love him and we
[39:38] will look and we will come unto you and
[39:41] take our Abode with
[39:42] him right he that loveth me not keepeth
[39:46] not my sayings so sisters I think it is
[39:50] all right to just put a little makeup on
[39:52] and splash a little this and and and cut
[39:55] a little this and now that ain't his
[39:58] words so you're out of the Gospel sorry
[40:02] you're out of it so you're not doing his
[40:04] words you don't love him
[40:07] enough oh don't tell me see there the
[40:09] devil's already got you am did Jesus
[40:13] ever
[40:14] say it's just really hard to do what the
[40:17] father tells me to do no he said I
[40:18] always do it right why because the
[40:21] father was in him and he let him have
[40:24] preeminence that's our problem is we get
[40:26] ourself in the way and we think remember
[40:30] I told you many times before if somebody
[40:32] ever comes to me and says I
[40:34] thought pretty much you're going to have
[40:36] to explain again what you're talking
[40:38] about he that loveth me not you'll
[40:40] remember that he that loveth me not
[40:43] keepeth not my sayings and the word
[40:45] which you hear is not
[40:47] mine all right now listen there's two
[40:49] words there's two Powers the devils and
[40:51] gods he said if you're not listening to
[40:54] mine you're listening to the devils
[40:56] right and The Words which you hear is
[40:58] not mine but the Father which sent me
[41:02] these things have I spoken unto you
[41:03] being yet present with you now look but
[41:06] the comforter which is the Holy Ghost he
[41:08] puts it right down where it's at whom
[41:10] the father will send in my
[41:12] name he shall teach you all things and
[41:14] bring all things to your remembrance
[41:16] whatsoever I have said unto you peace I
[41:19] leave with you my peace I give unto you
[41:21] not as the world
[41:22] giveth give I unto you let not your
[41:25] heart be troubled
[41:26] neither let it be
[41:29] afraid we're going fixing to go through
[41:31] some Troublesome
[41:33] times the world's getting worse and
[41:36] worse they're saying this coming October

[41:48] deal we got to go through
[41:51] itless we get out of here before that we
[41:53] should be fine with
[41:54] me but we're prepared for for it listen
[41:58] this world when they go through
[42:00] something you watch them when they start
[42:02] going through something they they number
[42:04] one they start going to church again but
[42:06] you know some kind of disaster like 9/11
[42:09] boy 911 when 911 hit Heavenly days the
[42:13] churches was full of people National Day
[42:16] of Prayer when they took it out of the
[42:18] schools and said it was illegal they had
[42:21] a whole nation come and pray because of
[42:24] this disaster that happened then what
[42:27] about a year later it was then another
[42:30] year later and it's
[42:32] well now they're empty again
[42:35] right you and I should not be that
[42:38] way sure we're going to have troubles
[42:40] we're going to have ups and downs
[42:43] always but we know the end there's an
[42:47] end to this everybody with me just a
[42:50] minute let me get off my message just
[42:51] man there's an end to
[42:53] this we're we're looking at something
[42:55] and we're not not but Paul said I even
[42:58] look through a glass Darkly cuz he
[42:59] wasn't in an open book you and I are in
[43:01] the open book we know what age we're
[43:03] living in we know what time we know
[43:05] what's happening we know who's already
[43:07] com and who's already left and we know
[43:08] where the devil
[43:11] is what else you need to know we know
[43:13] where God is he's in us okay so we know
[43:17] the devil is out there trying to what
[43:19] trying to stop listen brother R said
[43:22] he's trying to what stop the program of
[43:24] God now you and I are the program of
[43:28] God believe it or not if you're born
[43:31] again today you have a part in the
[43:33] program of God hallelujah they realize
[43:37] that amen and there's a plan for you to
[43:40] go through this not meet your
[43:43] end Hallelujah and listen be called out
[43:46] of all that Hallelujah come on called
[43:50] out completely out of that oh we might
[43:52] have to go through who
[43:55] knows we have to go through a little
[43:59] persecution Moses stood one day and
[44:01] Moses I'm sure inside of Moses he was
[44:04] like man I spent 40
[44:07] years they trained me for 40 years to
[44:11] take over my mama told me when I was a
[44:15] baby that I was chosen for a
[44:18] job am I
[44:20] right then when he hit about 40 years
[44:24] old he got SC R by he was actually the
[44:27] next Pharaoh in line so he was
[44:29] like you know he had a church with 6 or
[44:31] 800 people oh never mind he was the head
[44:35] Bishop he was the head
[44:38] Bishop
[44:40] right but he still had a
[44:43] temper right and he killed an
[44:46] Egyptian and that wiped out all back he
[44:50] had to go running back to the desert and
[44:53] God brother R said God had to take every
[44:54] bit of that out of him because he was
[44:56] schooled as my dad's always said and I
[44:59] believe it 100% that's why Pharaoh
[45:01] didn't have him killed now listen if you
[45:03] was to come up to a pharaoh I don't care
[45:04] who you were he can have his wife killed
[45:06] and nobody say anything about
[45:09] it Kings had their wives head cut off
[45:11] all the time be
[45:14] careful but but here's Moses walks right
[45:17] up and says Let My People
[45:20] Go and Pharaoh's like didn't mean you
[45:23] grow up
[45:24] together right did didn't you weren't
[45:27] you trained didn't my daddy which is
[45:29] rames didn't my daddy said he didn't my
[45:32] daddy train you and where You' been
[45:34] you've been gone for 40 years Moses said
[45:37] I had to get all that knocked out of me
[45:39] he said but I'm ready to take over now
[45:40] he said how he
[45:42] said here I
[45:46] am God don't worry about
[45:50] numbers but still Pharaoh thought man he
[45:53] might have some friends still in that
[45:55] little cap you know his little circle of
[45:57] friends over here he said he may still
[45:59] have some generals over here or
[46:00] something he might he might cause me a
[46:01] little oh Moses going then he kept
[46:04] playing with him yeah you can let him go
[46:06] then then he changed his mind that
[46:07] morning or that night he changed his
[46:09] mind of course he could he's a pharaoh
[46:12] but there was one day when Moses god
[46:14] through Moses took that place to its
[46:17] knees right he took all that schooling
[46:19] out of
[46:22] him but the Bible tells us in Hebrews 11
[46:26] it says Moses if you read it read it
[46:29] just like you're standing there with
[46:30] Moses here's Moses he's able to take he
[46:32] probably was able to take over without
[46:34] having all these Mighty
[46:36] Miracles he could he could have mounted
[46:39] an army took most of the Israelites and
[46:41] and had an Insurrection and took half of
[46:43] the Egyptians with him because they all
[46:46] like Moses I'm sure they did at
[46:50] first but the Bible says
[46:53] Moses for all that
[46:57] he threw it away so that he could listen
[47:00] to what God Said can you and I do that
[47:04] can we throw away everything that's
[47:06] important to
[47:09] us esteem that just nothing but just
[47:13] part of
[47:14] life and the riches and all those things
[47:18] Moos they said he said Paul said Moses
[47:20] just said no I want to serve
[47:24] Christ amen
[47:26] can we do that that's Hebrews that's
[47:29] Hebrews 11 that's how Moses put his
[47:31] faith in what God said can we do that
[47:34] now Moses didn't have the new birth you
[47:35] and I have the new birth we should be
[47:36] able to do that a lot more than he
[47:40] did cuz deity lays in you it deity lays
[47:44] in me me and
[47:47] you and as sister Anna I brought I left
[47:51] this in here for sister Anna marunga
[47:53] because she was talking to me down
[47:55] downstairs she said you don't mean just
[47:57] a regular Jubilee you mean a golden
[47:58] jubilee yes I've me 50 years of the
[48:01] golden jubilee it's okay so some of you
[48:03] that didn't understand that you have a
[48:05] jubilee ever seven years and we'll cover
[48:07] that in the church ages but there comes
[48:08] a place to where at the 49th year you
[48:11] have one more you have a jubilee golden
[48:14] jubilee 50th Jubilee where everything
[48:17] goes free right and we'll we'll get
[48:19] through that but I I just want to make
[48:21] you understand that yes you're right
[48:23] sister that is the golden jubilee I'm
[48:25] talking about this right here now we're
[48:27] living under the golden jubilee as our
[48:30] brother said the other day the seven
[48:32] sevens is gone we're in an eight 77 is
[48:35] 49 that's not going to take you to a 50
[48:37] you got one more you got that eternity
[48:40] you got that eight so that we'll get to
[48:42] that but there'll come another Year of
[48:44] Jubilee that's why brother Randon was
[48:46] looking at he not a not a not one we got
[48:48] to go over we have to go we don't have
[48:50] to go to
[48:51] Israel we're having it inside of oursel
[48:54] right it's a a golden jubilee that this
[48:57] this guy can go
[48:58] free that's what we're looking at this
[49:00] guy can go
[49:02] free listen man has talked about this
[49:05] and talked about it job stood one day
[49:07] and he said in my flesh I'll see God
[49:11] Amen though the skin worms destroy this
[49:13] body in my flesh I shall see God so he
[49:18] was looking to somewhere that death had
[49:20] to be destroyed somewhere job had enough
[49:23] Revelation to be able to see that do
[49:26] we cuz we've got the formula right job
[49:30] didn't have the formula we have the
[49:32] formula that's right in our hands right
[49:34] now they coming Another Year of Jubilee
[49:37] and that we've had it just about this
[49:38] time now he's talking about a natural
[49:39] Jubilee going from
[49:41] Pentecost he says when you get begin to
[49:44] see the Year of Jubilee now not the
[49:46] seven sevens that's what we're going to
[49:47] cover in the church
[49:48] ages and you'll hear brother rown say he
[49:51] says they couldn't get all the way out
[49:52] what do you mean by
[49:54] that they left a leg in or an arm in no
[49:58] they brought some Doctrine with them
[50:00] right and he's telling the Pentecostals
[50:03] you brought some Doctrine with you that
[50:05] you shouldn't have right like you got to
[50:07] speak in tongues to get the Holy Ghost
[50:09] and you got to do this and got to do
[50:10] that right but when you begin to see the
[50:13] Year of Jubilee where we don't have to
[50:14] fuss and strain and pull like this but
[50:16] we're already secured in Christ we
[50:18] already have the name of the Lord Jesus
[50:19] in baptism now he keeps going through
[50:21] the great Mysteries that we're going to
[50:23] bring up in the Seven Seals and prove to
[50:25] you then was the seals that were sealed
[50:27] from the eyes of the
[50:29] people
[50:31] nobody
[50:33] saw what we
[50:35] see
[50:39] nobody thank God he sent us a
[50:42] prophet cuz that Prophet went into the
[50:44] mind of God and brought that open book
[50:46] that's right he stood there one day and
[50:48] he said here stands a lamb with a book
[50:50] in his hand and there goes the white
[50:52] horse rider then he starts preaching and
[50:55] his preaching for the next 2 and a half
[50:57] to three years before his death he was
[50:59] he's pulling it apart now wait he
[51:02] preached United time and sign that was
[51:03] us and Christ back together but he he
[51:05] preached anointed ones at the end time
[51:08] all the different ones Mighty God
[51:10] unveiled before
[51:11] us he was
[51:13] separating pulling it apart so that we
[51:16] can see our pathway and our way to
[51:20] go so Revelations 3:14 is the beginning
[51:23] of the creation of God I hope you see
[51:25] that that you and I are a continuation
[51:27] as he said a continuation of that
[51:30] creation but being in in that in that
[51:34] what was dispensation of the beginning
[51:36] of the creation of God he claims your
[51:40] body the word of God has not stood in a
[51:44] pull pit and claimed your body until
[51:46] this day
[51:49] right
[51:54] nobody
[51:56] that is the beginning of the creation of
[51:59] God and this is the
[52:02] continuation oh listen folks let's don't
[52:04] let brother Brown's message be be null
[52:07] and void don't let the message of the
[52:09] hour be null and
[52:13] void I'm going read just one here in a
[52:15] few minutes I read to you Wednesday
[52:16] night brother BR said when my religion
[52:18] starts getting
[52:20] dull I'll read it to
[52:24] you
[52:26] the whole Redemptive plan you and I have
[52:29] now everything the whole plan of
[52:34] God Ezekiel 18:20 says the soul that
[52:37] sinth it shall die the son shall not
[52:40] bear the iniquity of the fathers we were
[52:41] talking this morning so you're an
[52:43] individual person you absolutely have to
[52:45] get it on your own as far as the Holy
[52:48] Ghost now you need helpers and all that
[52:50] the
[52:51] comforter but I can't give you the Holy
[52:53] Ghost you got to accept it right all
[52:55] right the soul that sinth it shall die
[52:58] the son shall not bear the iniquity of
[52:59] the father NE shall the father bear the
[53:01] iniquity of the son the righteous of the
[53:03] righteous shall be upon Him
[53:05] righteousness and the wickedness of the
[53:06] wickedness shall be upon him separated
[53:09] all
[53:12] right when you stand before judgment I
[53:14] hope none of you in this building have
[53:16] to stand before the white Throne
[53:17] judgment you're going to give an account
[53:19] as an individual you're not going to
[53:20] give an account because your preacher
[53:22] held you
[53:24] back
[53:26] your mama held you
[53:27] back no you held you
[53:30] back for what is a man Prophet us if he
[53:33] shall gain the whole world and lose his
[53:36] own soul or what shall a man give in
[53:38] exchange for his soul I was thinking
[53:41] this this week about about that very
[53:44] subject and then uh Lis you know brother
[53:46] Lis he talks about 10,000 worlds brother
[53:49] Brown said one Soul was worth that you
[53:52] know I think about a couple of Great Men
[53:53] and and I'm talking about men men that
[53:55] were in the world like um well just to
[54:00] be truthful we got Daddy a bunch of
[54:01] Bonanza videos and we've been watching
[54:03] bananza
[54:07] videos so anyway you got Little Joe if
[54:09] everybody knows who that is that was
[54:11] Michael Landon well Michael Landon was
[54:13] worth you know h100 million dollar he
[54:16] got pancreatic cancer and 3 months later
[54:19] he
[54:21] died all that Fame and Fortune and all
[54:24] that money
[54:26] I'm sure he poured and then you look at
[54:28] other people that you look at Steve Jobs
[54:31] he was a multi-billionaire the the owner
[54:34] of Apple created Apple what you're using
[54:38] now he was the creator of it him and wnc
[54:40] and all the different ones what was he
[54:42] at where was he at okay
[54:45] but he gets
[54:48] cancer I'm sure he spends hundreds of
[54:51] thousands of
[54:53] dollars for his body
[54:56] body but I don't know that he ever
[54:58] stopped and said God forgive my
[55:01] soul and when he died his soul went
[55:05] somewhere his millions stayed
[55:10] here right and a lot of Great Men you
[55:13] see how their life was cut short money
[55:16] could not buy or
[55:18] purchase that's right enough to reverse
[55:21] that right but if they would have
[55:23] stopped just a minute and said God and I
[55:25] hope they did I hope that but it was
[55:27] never recorded that they did that they
[55:29] would give their heart to the Lord
[55:32] then 10,000 worlds just popped up and
[55:34] there's no way to there's no way to put
[55:36] a value on that same way with us there's
[55:39] no way to put a value there listen
[55:41] there's no way put a no way to put a
[55:43] value on your
[55:45] worship if you know who you're
[55:48] worshiping and he loves that
[55:51] worship there's no there's no value you
[55:54] can't say I got a 401K with $110 million
[55:57] in it if you don't know the Lord you got
[55:59] zero in your bank
[56:01] account in heaven
[56:04] right but our souls on his
[56:07] Altar and look what happens when you get
[56:09] the new birth you're conceived a new
[56:12] there is a
[56:13] conception right you are conceived a new
[56:17] you was first conceived in iniquity now
[56:19] you're conceived in something new what
[56:22] is it the Living Word right amen amen H
[56:27] all that changes it now doesn't it now
[56:29] we're through the struggle after seeing
[56:31] what you got to do now what happens
[56:33] you're conceived and new and the Living
[56:34] Word what is it the word becomes alive
[56:37] in you so what someone preaches are you
[56:40] here brother brandom or you hear a a
[56:42] Minister preach and it's the word of God
[56:44] and you say that ain't nothing but the
[56:46] truth that makes the word become alive
[56:48] inside of you amen it's dead as long as
[56:51] it lays on that page
[56:53] right
[56:55] how many have you ever been sitting
[56:56] somewhere and you said I see
[57:01] that that wasn't the
[57:03] devil that was not the devil cuz he's
[57:07] over there trying to put the blinders on
[57:08] you and you're over there
[57:10] going I see that well that's God and now
[57:14] listen hang on to that go to the next
[57:17] step hang on to that go to the next step
[57:19] hang on to that sir everybody with me
[57:23] where once you couldn't see that now you
[57:25] do see it there's something different
[57:27] now makes all the scriptures come
[57:29] together makes everything dovetail just
[57:31] right ain't that true if we read the
[57:34] Bible if you were a denomination or you
[57:36] in a denominational Church you read the
[57:39] Bible like a denominational told you to
[57:41] to read it right but we read the same
[57:44] Bible now we see there's no eternal
[57:47] hell we see there's no father son Holy
[57:49] Ghost baptism we see these things why we
[57:51] read the same Bible but we read it with
[57:53] what we read it with something
[57:56] different the scales of our eyes have
[57:59] been pulled
[58:00] back we're going to see that in the
[58:02] church ages that that the scales were
[58:04] pulled back but there was always a part
[58:06] there that Satan and I hate to say this
[58:08] but he had so much control over the
[58:10] church during the church
[58:12] ages we'll talk about
[58:16] it and I hate to say that but part of
[58:19] the
[58:19] plan part of the plan of God he's not
[58:22] nervous that's right he didn't now
[58:25] didn't see that no he saw
[58:27] everything and listen so he knows how to
[58:29] navigate through all that he's God he
[58:33] sees the end from the beginning Satan
[58:34] doesn't I think Satan just
[58:38] reacts to a spirit maybe then now
[58:42] something begins to happen now you die
[58:43] to your own thinking now you're
[58:45] conceived cuz you're Washed by the Water
[58:46] of the word what do you do with a baby
[58:48] as soon as it's born you give it a bath
[58:50] you wash it and as soon as a man has
[58:53] died to himself and born of God he's
[58:55] Washed by the Water of the
[58:58] word and brother Brown tells us say now
[59:00] you have your training you thought man
[59:02] I'm done I'm finished no just get you
[59:04] started what have we been talking about
[59:05] for hund and something
[59:07] services this is our training now and
[59:10] it's not it may start as child training
[59:12] but it's going to be an adult
[59:14] training adult training class a little
[59:17] bit different than child training
[59:19] class you're ready to go into training
[59:21] now child training that's where you get
[59:23] started that's the hard part when you
[59:25] think you ought to do this and the word
[59:27] Cuts you around shows you something else
[59:29] let me ask you a question how many times
[59:31] that ever
[59:33] happened amen you had your own idea you
[59:35] knew that's what scripture said you knew
[59:37] that's what brother vam said and
[59:39] somebody come in and preach something to
[59:40] you and you
[59:43] go I don't see it that way
[59:46] anymore right right well you know what
[59:48] that was God that was not the devil cuz
[59:50] he'd want you to stay in the
[59:52] error and the word Cuts you around and
[59:54] shows you something else while they
[59:56] believe that over that don't make any
[59:57] difference what they believe right
[59:59] here's what God Said and you must be
[1:00:02] about the father's business now you're
[1:00:04] getting born again now you're getting
[1:00:06] right getting straightened out you have
[1:00:08] a new parent so in order if you're born
[1:00:11] again and got a new parent then you got
[1:00:13] a new nature the old nature is dead and
[1:00:15] you got a new nature you once was going
[1:00:17] one way now you going another you once
[1:00:20] was going down now you're going up your
[1:00:22] affections are set on things above a new
[1:00:24] affection
[1:00:27] listen when you got born again you had
[1:00:29] an affection for God that you never had
[1:00:31] before right but it was in child
[1:00:32] training
[1:00:35] here now watch him he says now your
[1:00:38] affections are set on things above a new
[1:00:42] affection okay you don't love the things
[1:00:45] of the world no more your
[1:00:47] affections are of
[1:00:48] God all these statue of perfect man all
[1:00:51] the way up there to Holy Spirit now you
[1:00:53] got a new effect
[1:00:55] now we're getting into something
[1:00:56] different we're getting into some deep
[1:01:00] water hope you learn how to swim the
[1:01:02] last 10 and something
[1:01:06] sermons cuz we got to keep moving
[1:01:10] on I see some of the Tabernacle folks
[1:01:12] here I'm going to say this about the big
[1:01:14] sister Tabernacle one thing that the
[1:01:16] Tabernacle needs is more up there at our
[1:01:19] church at the Tabernacle at
[1:01:20] Jeffersonville and I'm sorry to say you
[1:01:23] can't even get in it now they don't even
[1:01:24] have church services there going to turn
[1:01:26] into a museum is what we heard
[1:01:29] so old relics I don't want old relics
[1:01:33] that's come on give me something fresh
[1:01:36] amen that's right it's a rededication
[1:01:39] and a refilling of the Holy Ghost that's
[1:01:41] right everyone to get down to the Altar
[1:01:43] and pray until they get a renewing of
[1:01:44] the Holy Ghost and I want to say
[1:01:45] something real
[1:01:46] quick we open these doors from 5 to 6
[1:01:50] o'clock some of you come some of you
[1:01:53] ain't never showed your face here
[1:01:56] you're missing something amen especially
[1:01:59] those of you that have a job here those
[1:02:01] of you that have a job here everybody
[1:02:03] looks at
[1:02:04] you as a spiritual leader because you
[1:02:08] have a job to do you should be here you
[1:02:11] should be here for Bible
[1:02:13] study I've told you that before you look
[1:02:15] at me weird if you want to but people
[1:02:18] watch you and says well why is this so
[1:02:20] why is he not
[1:02:21] here if he does this or does this I'm
[1:02:25] just
[1:02:26] saying it's not required but he'd be
[1:02:29] nice if you
[1:02:31] come cuz you know what you're probably
[1:02:33] going to do something else like Dad said
[1:02:36] you going to go to Walmart on Saturday
[1:02:40] night well it gets some quiet now where
[1:02:43] you can hear the fans doing
[1:02:45] this but you know is that not the truth
[1:02:48] brother Brown said every time that door
[1:02:49] opens he said you should want to come to
[1:02:51] get in them
[1:02:53] that's exactly so is he still your
[1:02:55] Prophet or
[1:02:57] not did he change it's just old now we
[1:03:01] don't have to believe that it don't
[1:03:06] change the whole church be filled with
[1:03:08] the power of God that's what we need not
[1:03:12] only the Tabernacle but the body of
[1:03:13] Christ Universal it needs a refilling I
[1:03:16] like David said one day restore to me
[1:03:18] the joy of my salvation now he had not
[1:03:20] lost his salvation but the joy of it and
[1:03:24] when it comes to a place that I can
[1:03:26] enjoy my
[1:03:28] religion my
[1:03:30] salvation there's something wrong
[1:03:33] somewhere because it is a joy
[1:03:36] unspeakable and full of glory
[1:03:43] amen you look at the
[1:03:46] world and we're all guilty of this you
[1:03:49] you turn on a a TV and you you watch a
[1:03:52] ball game I mean
[1:03:55] 80 to 100,000
[1:03:57] people they go to their
[1:04:00] church and they don't miss a ball game
[1:04:05] service they dress in their team
[1:04:09] colors some of them have them tattooed
[1:04:12] on their naked chest and at 12 degrees
[1:04:19] outside and they shout the whole
[1:04:23] service and you never see one of them
[1:04:25] fall
[1:04:28] asleep hello
[1:04:31] somebody now you're not going to get
[1:04:33] popcorn and a drink in here like they do
[1:04:37] but that's their church service that's
[1:04:38] their God that's what they feed off of
[1:04:41] EXA what do we do and I'm guilty too I
[1:04:45] mean that's a fervor to me what brother
[1:04:47] Brown that's why that's a fervor that's
[1:04:49] a fervor of wanting to come to church
[1:04:51] and like brother R said I want this Joy
[1:04:54] unspeakable amen amen when it comes to a
[1:04:57] place that I can't enjoy my
[1:04:59] religion my salvation there's something
[1:05:02] wrong
[1:05:04] somewhere we need a rededication a
[1:05:06] refilling this year we're not going to
[1:05:09] make it without it
[1:05:13] right let me say something too this
[1:05:15] uniting time to see the church is
[1:05:16] uniting Nations uniting it's a uniting
[1:05:19] time of God and his bride too praise the
[1:05:22] Lord and I say this with reverence and
[1:05:24] respect I believe that the bride of
[1:05:25] Christ is
[1:05:27] called I believe she is sealed in the
[1:05:29] kingdom of God now a lot of people would
[1:05:32] say that would be that he said this you
[1:05:34] know that we're ready to go he doesn't
[1:05:36] mean
[1:05:37] that he means the kingdom that she the
[1:05:40] bride is sealed into the kingdom of God
[1:05:42] now we've got things that we've got to
[1:05:44] understand to go to the body change
[1:05:47] we're not sealed in what I'm saying is a
[1:05:49] lot of people said Redemption was over
[1:05:51] in
[1:05:52] 1963 like a whole group says now that
[1:05:55] well not now but they've said forever
[1:05:56] that that Jesus came in 1963 so we don't
[1:06:00] have to take communion
[1:06:01] anymore well I want you to read that
[1:06:04] communion scripture just one more
[1:06:08] time he says I not drink this until I
[1:06:11] drink it in my kingdom now if he's come
[1:06:14] he should already be here and he'd be
[1:06:16] drinking the wine right no he's here in
[1:06:21] the word amen he's not here in physical
[1:06:23] form right so communion is part of what
[1:06:26] you're supposed to
[1:06:28] do but that's where people get their
[1:06:30] idea that in 1963 they told Dad when he
[1:06:32] come in in 1968 or 69 they said hey
[1:06:34] Redemption is over you can't be saved
[1:06:36] because of certain script certain things
[1:06:38] that brother Ram said right but we know
[1:06:41] one thing for sure in
[1:06:44] 1963 90% of y'all wasn't even
[1:06:48] born but the ones of us that were
[1:06:51] Donnie born in 1949 he's he's a 49er
[1:06:54] y'all know that
[1:06:58] 1949 if you had a 1949 car it'd
[1:07:03] be okie dokie
[1:07:06] then
[1:07:08] okay sure he has a 1949
[1:07:12] car but
[1:07:16] look we're sealed into the
[1:07:19] kingdom when you get the new
[1:07:22] birth all right so most of us weren't
[1:07:24] born some of us were I was
[1:07:26] three all right but Redemption wasn't
[1:07:29] over or we just empty this church and go
[1:07:31] to the house and go to a ball game with
[1:07:34] our shirt off and our favorite number
[1:07:36] tattoo on our
[1:07:39] chest but it's
[1:07:41] not if you got the baptism of the Holy
[1:07:44] Ghost today yes you are sealed in your
[1:07:46] king in the kingdom of God but now
[1:07:48] there's work to do
[1:07:50] amen I believe the mechanics is there
[1:07:53] they're waiting for the Dynamics that'll
[1:07:55] take her off the earth into Glory now
[1:07:57] that's what he's talking about in The
[1:07:59] Rapture I believe it with all my heart
[1:08:00] yes sir we don't know how he's going to
[1:08:02] do it but he shall do it he's the
[1:08:05] Dynamics we just become members of the
[1:08:07] machine of his body I like what he says
[1:08:09] we read this about this machine forming
[1:08:11] oursel into his image and see him
[1:08:14] uniting himself with us in his
[1:08:18] works with his love gifts look as he
[1:08:22] hands them to us just before the wedding
[1:08:25] supper now remember see we get married
[1:08:27] down here we go to a wedding supper all
[1:08:30] right and we're waiting and watching for
[1:08:33] that their big church is to be United
[1:08:36] the D dynamics of this church will be a
[1:08:39] refilling of the holy spirit that we
[1:08:41] have look worked in a small measure
[1:08:43] while The Headstone is coming down to
[1:08:45] unite with the body but when that head
[1:08:47] and body unites together the full power
[1:08:50] of the Holy Ghost would raise her up
[1:08:52] just exactly like that even the
[1:08:55] dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds
[1:08:58] of years will rise in the beauty of his
[1:09:01] Holiness and take a flight to the skies
[1:09:03] look the Dynamics is the holy
[1:09:06] spirit once more Lord
[1:09:08] 1963 brother Ram said in my travels I
[1:09:11] find two classes of people one of them
[1:09:14] are fundamentals positionally they know
[1:09:16] by the mechanics that they are to be
[1:09:18] Sons and Daughters of God all right
[1:09:20] everybody with me you got to keep your
[1:09:22] eyes open to read and I said the the
[1:09:25] next I find is the
[1:09:28] Pentecostals they with the baptism of
[1:09:30] the Holy Spirit but I said the
[1:09:32] fundamentalists positionally know where
[1:09:34] they're at but they don't have any faith
[1:09:36] in the word right and the Pentecostals
[1:09:40] has got a lot of faith but don't know
[1:09:43] who they
[1:09:44] are and I said it's like a man that had
[1:09:46] money in the bank he could not write a
[1:09:49] but could not write a check one could
[1:09:51] write a check but not on money in the
[1:09:52] bank if you could get the them two
[1:09:55] together excuse me he said well that
[1:09:57] makes them act like that I said it's
[1:09:59] letting off the steam what makes them
[1:10:01] act like that I I don't maybe that's
[1:10:05] what we ought to call it letting off
[1:10:09] steam you know how we let off steam at
[1:10:11] at home and work and all those different
[1:10:13] things what we do either go outside and
[1:10:16] scream and holler
[1:10:18] and we ought to do that here maybe let
[1:10:21] off some steam Shout praise the
[1:10:26] Lord I said it's letting off the steam I
[1:10:28] said now I don't think that would have
[1:10:30] to be
[1:10:32] necessary but they've got to vent
[1:10:37] somewhere I wish we had enough pressure
[1:10:39] in us to make his
[1:10:44] vent and I said now if they would just
[1:10:47] take all that Steam and know how to
[1:10:51] direct it fundamentally in the word the
[1:10:53] big regime of of God would start moving
[1:10:55] on there is where Satan got in to make
[1:10:59] it all mechanics and no
[1:11:01] Dynamics back all Dynamics and no
[1:11:05] mechanics see we've got to put it
[1:11:07] together we've got the power of the Holy
[1:11:09] Spirit but we've got to come back with a
[1:11:11] word to feed this
[1:11:16] machine we can't feed it on Creeds it
[1:11:18] won't burn it chokes up the flu and
[1:11:21] it'll it will not burn it it was made
[1:11:24] for the word of God you were made for
[1:11:26] the word of God Amen man shall not live
[1:11:29] by bread alone but by every word not
[1:11:31] just part of it every word that
[1:11:32] proceedeth out of the mouth of
[1:11:36] God now sees not air with a sh see not
[1:11:39] close it is now we're getting ready to
[1:11:40] head to Matthew 24 here just for a
[1:11:42] second then we'll
[1:11:44] close now Matthew 24:24 said the two
[1:11:47] spirits in the last days look the church
[1:11:50] Spirit of the church people and by the
[1:11:53] way me the church Spirit of the churchy
[1:11:57] churchy
[1:11:58] people and the bride Spirit of the Bride
[1:12:01] people amen would be so close I went
[1:12:05] like this now he's going to bring them
[1:12:06] back like this he said we'll be so close
[1:12:08] together till it would deceive the very
[1:12:10] elect if it was possible that's how
[1:12:12] close revelation of Jesus Christ it's a
[1:12:15] church age book where we're heading to
[1:12:16] now remember this Christ in the true
[1:12:18] church is a continuation of the book of
[1:12:20] Acts I could almost quote this verbatim
[1:12:23] we read it so many times but the Book of
[1:12:25] Revelations now look where did we see
[1:12:27] the church ages started in the Book of
[1:12:30] Revelations when we start in the book of
[1:12:31] Revelations we're going to start in
[1:12:32] Revelation chapter
[1:12:33] 1 but the Book of Revelation shows how
[1:12:36] that the Antichrist Spirit would come
[1:12:38] into the church and defile it making it
[1:12:42] lukewarm formal and
[1:12:45] Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his
[1:12:48] work the attempted destruction of God's
[1:12:49] people and discrediting of God's word
[1:12:52] right down to the time he has cast to
[1:12:53] the Lake of Fire he fights that he
[1:12:55] cannot stand it he knows that if the
[1:12:57] people get the true revelation of the
[1:12:59] true church and what she is what she
[1:13:02] stands for and that she can do the
[1:13:04] Greater Works she will be an invincible
[1:13:08] Army if they get a true revelation of
[1:13:11] the two Spirits within the framework of
[1:13:15] the Christian
[1:13:17] Church Christian
[1:13:20] Church this is not some Christian
[1:13:24] church and by God's spirit the only way
[1:13:27] you're going to be able to do it discern
[1:13:29] and withstand the Antichrist Spirit
[1:13:31] Satan will be powerless before her he
[1:13:34] would be as definitely thwarted today as
[1:13:35] when Christ with stod his every effort
[1:13:37] to gain power over him in the desert
[1:13:39] Satan hates Revelation but we love it
[1:13:42] with true Revelation in our lives the
[1:13:44] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us
[1:13:46] but we will prevail over them all right
[1:13:49] let's read Matthew 24 start verse 23 I
[1:13:52] like what brother Donaldo said about
[1:13:54] this you know you got your two Spirits
[1:13:55] 2424 you got your twins then if any man
[1:13:58] shall say this is
[1:14:00] Jesus everybody with me this is this is
[1:14:02] Jesus speaking all right he's preaching
[1:14:05] on the
[1:14:06] seals then if any man shall say unto you
[1:14:08] Lo here is Christ or there believe it
[1:14:11] not now that sounds good oh Christ let's
[1:14:16] go he said believe it or not try it for
[1:14:21] there shall arise false Christ and false
[1:14:23] prophets and shall show great signs and
[1:14:26] wonders in so much that if it were
[1:14:27] possible they shall deceive the very
[1:14:30] elect behold I have told you before
[1:14:34] wherefore if they shall say unto you
[1:14:35] behold he is in the desert go not forth
[1:14:39] behold he is in the secret chamber
[1:14:42] believe it not how are you going to not
[1:14:44] go for
[1:14:46] that
[1:14:52] how think about it where are wherefore
[1:14:55] if somebody comes up to you and says
[1:14:57] behold he's over there in that
[1:14:59] church he's fully over there in that
[1:15:01] church but now we drink a little bit and
[1:15:03] we just told church when we want to and
[1:15:05] we you know we cut let the women cut
[1:15:06] hair we let them preach every once in a
[1:15:07] while you know blah blah blah well you
[1:15:09] know one thing's for sure he's not over
[1:15:12] there go not forth behold he is in a
[1:15:14] secret chamber oh you can't touch him
[1:15:17] unless I tell you I know where that
[1:15:19] secret chamber is you got to come to me
[1:15:21] and listen to me I'll tell you where
[1:15:23] it's that believe it or not and I like
[1:15:25] what brother John's been doing the whole
[1:15:27] time he's going why cuz you don't have
[1:15:29] somebody doesn't have to tell you where
[1:15:30] Christ is if he's inside of
[1:15:35] you somebody don't have to come and tell
[1:15:37] you Christ is over here and over under
[1:15:39] if you got him inside of you cuz you say
[1:15:42] hey that's false he's right here
[1:15:45] right for as the lightning cometh out of
[1:15:48] the East and shineth even into the West
[1:15:50] so shall also the coming of the son of
[1:15:53] man
[1:15:54] be I want to ask you a
[1:15:57] question we talk about Thunders and
[1:15:59] everybody now is
[1:16:02] go but part of this verbiage of this
[1:16:05] message it talks about seven Thunders
[1:16:07] because it's in the Bible right but now
[1:16:09] do they just
[1:16:12] happen have you ever
[1:16:15] seen just
[1:16:18] Thunder or heard just
[1:16:21] Thunder no he's got to be
[1:16:24] lightning before the
[1:16:27] Thunder I think we're missing a lot of
[1:16:29] that cuz it says right here for as the
[1:16:31] lightning cometh out of the East and
[1:16:33] shineth even un the West listen if it's
[1:16:36] if it absolutely light if there's a
[1:16:38] lightning bolt there's going to be
[1:16:42] thunder man we had one at the house so
[1:16:44] the other day about knock me out of the
[1:16:46] bed you know you can now let's go to
[1:16:50] life lesson
[1:16:52] 473 if you see a lightning bolt count
[1:16:56] 1,1 10002 and every when that boom
[1:16:59] starts that's how many miles that is
[1:17:00] away from where it hit at Tony knew that
[1:17:03] I didn't have to tell him man Tony knew
[1:17:04] that long time
[1:17:08] ago but anyway I that thing knocked me
[1:17:10] out of bed and I went 1,1 it went boom I
[1:17:13] thought okay it was a mile
[1:17:16] away okay now let's get back to the
[1:17:18] service for as the lightning cometh out
[1:17:21] of the East and shineth but look listen
[1:17:24] to be honest with you why did why did g
[1:17:26] why did Jesus stand one day to identify
[1:17:28] the son of man and he put a lightning
[1:17:30] bolt in
[1:17:35] there got to be some Thunder
[1:17:38] afterwards we'll talk about that that's
[1:17:40] a little bit further down the road but
[1:17:42] we'll get into that a little bit later
[1:17:44] all right let's read the first seal real
[1:17:45] quick and then we'll close y'all
[1:17:47] are already went to
[1:17:50] ND and they said now here's a white
[1:17:53] horse now watch a white horse is the
[1:17:55] power now Jesus Jesus Remember keep this
[1:17:58] in the back of your mind Jesus preached
[1:18:00] the
[1:18:01] seals all right brother Brown didn't
[1:18:03] preach something new he didn't take it
[1:18:04] out of a new
[1:18:06] book he got it from the Bible all right
[1:18:09] and Jesus preached him in Matthew
[1:18:11] 24 supernaturally that nobody understood
[1:18:15] what he was talking about to put seal 1
[1:18:17] 2 3 4 5 and 6 is everybody with me until
[1:18:20] the prophet came and identified hey this
[1:18:22] is Seal one this is Seal two Jesus
[1:18:24] preached the seals all right he preached
[1:18:26] six seals and then guess guess who he is
[1:18:29] he's number seven he's the seventh seal
[1:18:31] we'll talk about that a little bit later
[1:18:33] in the sermons here's a white horse and
[1:18:36] a white horse is a power of charger now
[1:18:38] watch
[1:18:39] he's he's
[1:18:41] talking and said the man that sat on
[1:18:44] that was the White Horse was the Holy
[1:18:46] Spirit that went forth in the early age
[1:18:48] this is what he
[1:18:50] taught and conquered that age for the
[1:18:52] kingdom of of God he had a bow in his
[1:18:55] hand which meant like cupid he shot the
[1:18:57] arrows of love
[1:18:59] now brother Brown didn't even read the
[1:19:01] scripture because there's no arrow in
[1:19:03] that
[1:19:04] scripture okay it's just a bow he shot
[1:19:07] the arrow of love into the hearts of the
[1:19:09] people the love of God and he conquered
[1:19:11] now doesn't that sound
[1:19:12] good doesn't that sound good Christ
[1:19:15] comes and gets on a white horse and and
[1:19:17] he's got a bow and arrow and he
[1:19:19] shoots oh we just love
[1:19:25] we laugh but that's what was taught
[1:19:29] before the seals
[1:19:31] open that's the devil that he's talking
[1:19:35] about right now that sounds very
[1:19:38] good but it isn't the truth no sir it
[1:19:43] wasn't white does mean righteous we
[1:19:46] realize that that white means righteous
[1:19:48] the teachers taught it that it was the
[1:19:51] Holy Spirit conquering in the first age
[1:19:53] but my revelation of it by the holy
[1:19:55] spirit is not that way and the devil
[1:19:58] started getting
[1:20:00] nervous cuz he's fixing to do
[1:20:02] this amen where all them ages it was
[1:20:06] right there they were doing this right
[1:20:07] side by
[1:20:09] side my Revelation by the holy spirit is
[1:20:12] is Christ and the Holy Spirit is the
[1:20:14] self-same person only in a different
[1:20:18] form so here stands Christ the lamb we
[1:20:22] know was the lamb he's standing here
[1:20:24] with the books in his hand and there
[1:20:26] goes the white horse rider see so it
[1:20:29] wasn't the Holy Spirit what was he
[1:20:30] saying there's two people amen one here
[1:20:33] one
[1:20:34] here now that's one of the Mysteries of
[1:20:37] the last day how that Christ can be the
[1:20:39] three persons in one not three different
[1:20:41] people being three Gods as trinitarians
[1:20:44] say it's three manifestations of the
[1:20:45] same person or you might call it three
[1:20:47] offices if you're talking to ministers
[1:20:49] you wouldn't use office cuz just
[1:20:51] happened to think I'm on tape so I'll
[1:20:52] tell you of course Christ didn't say I
[1:20:54] pray my office and he'll send you
[1:20:56] another office we know that but if you
[1:20:58] want to make it it's three attributes of
[1:21:00] the same God and not three Gods three
[1:21:02] attributes of the same God and so how
[1:21:04] could Christ be out there with a white
[1:21:07] horse rider conquering and standing here
[1:21:09] with a book in his
[1:21:10] hand it isn't
[1:21:12] so here's where the devil got nervous he
[1:21:16] said it isn't
[1:21:18] Christ the air waves broke the logos
[1:21:21] began to speak amen amen the logos was
[1:21:25] beginning to tell us the truth right
[1:21:29] that's why the seals are so important it
[1:21:30] tells you so much truth it was locked up
[1:21:32] for all them
[1:21:34] years amen notice now the Holy Spirit
[1:21:37] and the Revelation in Christ the holy
[1:21:39] spirit is Christ in another form notice
[1:21:41] it is a lamb that opened the book and
[1:21:43] the lamb is Christ and Christ is not
[1:21:45] seen
[1:21:46] anymore from then Look Away to Jesus
[1:21:51] 1963
[1:21:54] we're going to move away from that we're
[1:21:55] going to come back to that scripture but
[1:21:56] we're going to move away from it right
[1:21:59] now so now I'm going to say something to
[1:22:01] you now look let me tell you something
[1:22:03] else brother randam when he preached
[1:22:04] that he never ever took it
[1:22:07] back that's
[1:22:10] right because it was the truth it was
[1:22:13] God it was the logos speaking to us it
[1:22:14] was God speaking said hey that's been
[1:22:16] wrong for all these
[1:22:18] years even my preachers have been
[1:22:20] preaching this come on somebody Luther
[1:22:25] Wesley nobody thought that that was a
[1:22:28] white horse that well you know they say
[1:22:29] Clarence Lin did well that's okay but
[1:22:31] Clarence Lin wasn't a church a messenger
[1:22:33] either he was a listen a servant of God
[1:22:36] can catch the mind of God right amen but
[1:22:39] he can't put it together like brother
[1:22:40] Brown Put it together right so that
[1:22:44] doesn't bother me that Clarence Lin
[1:22:45] wrote that you know they say brother
[1:22:46] Brown was a copycat that he copied all
[1:22:48] this stuff that all this was already
[1:22:49] revealed and he just copied I no I don't
[1:22:51] think so
[1:22:53] so now I'm going to say something to you
[1:22:54] now that I haven't said all along and
[1:22:56] that's the thing that we have looked
[1:22:57] forward to for so long for at least many
[1:23:01] years four or five years is this other
[1:23:04] word that people get all as Bob says
[1:23:06] wonky about is the third
[1:23:08] pull but that is part of our B verbiage
[1:23:11] and is part of our message of the hour
[1:23:14] everybody with me wake up for a minute I
[1:23:16] know it's hot in here but that's okay
[1:23:19] has now the third pole has now been
[1:23:21] Vindicated and I'm sure you know what it
[1:23:23] is now they
[1:23:26] didn't now remember there'll never be an
[1:23:29] impersonation of that cuz it can't
[1:23:31] be see it can't be it's
[1:23:36] inexistent I'm warned of this that soon
[1:23:38] right at this time now I'm just H it
[1:23:40] just happened so it could identify its
[1:23:43] presence among you see but it will not
[1:23:46] be used in a great way now watch until
[1:23:49] the Council of churches now under the
[1:23:51] third pole there was what five things
[1:23:54] that happened right ain't that right s
[1:23:57] we had the squirrels um sister MAA all
[1:24:00] the different things the great part of
[1:24:02] that we'll get to that a little bit
[1:24:03] later but those were some great things
[1:24:06] but he
[1:24:08] said it's not used in a great way until
[1:24:11] the council begins to tighten up now the
[1:24:12] council hadn't tightened up yet it's
[1:24:14] beginning to tighten
[1:24:15] up and when it does when that does the
[1:24:17] Pentecostals and for so forth can almost
[1:24:20] impersonate anything can be done you
[1:24:23] watch you go out there and you
[1:24:26] watch I'm not going to call their name
[1:24:28] but some of the Evangelist and the ones
[1:24:31] that you know they put their hands on
[1:24:33] them and and there's testimonies of you
[1:24:35] know they get slain in the spirit and
[1:24:37] all
[1:24:39] that women doing the same
[1:24:43] thing let me warn you Jesus stood there
[1:24:46] one
[1:24:46] day he said there's going to be two
[1:24:49] Spirits he said one's going to be anti
[1:24:53] and one's going to be of me all right
[1:24:55] I'm speaking in the first person one's
[1:24:57] going to be of me he said Beware of
[1:25:00] false Christ so he's speaking the logos
[1:25:03] is telling us so the logos is going to
[1:25:05] have to tell us where he's at and what
[1:25:06] he's doing all right but when that time
[1:25:09] comes when the squeeze comes down then
[1:25:12] you'll see look what you've seen
[1:25:16] temporarily
[1:25:18] wow that whole time of brother brandham
[1:25:20] sermons and everything all the great
[1:25:21] power of of manifestation in his
[1:25:24] Services of thousands of people being
[1:25:26] healed was
[1:25:29] temporary when the squeeze comes down
[1:25:31] then you'll see what you've seen
[1:25:33] temporarily be manifested in the
[1:25:36] fullness of its power see see
[1:25:39] see you see what we're doing we're just
[1:25:42] absolutely living below our
[1:25:45] privileges we absolutely have this part
[1:25:47] is coming and it's going to happen to
[1:25:49] somebody we can sleep our way through it
[1:25:50] if you want to that's fine with me
[1:25:52] but somebody's going to get it and move
[1:25:54] on somebody's going to make it's going
[1:25:55] to be happy that they got
[1:25:59] it maybe get some pom poms or something
[1:26:01] I don't know do you believe we're living
[1:26:03] in the last days when the son of man was
[1:26:05] to be manifested that would be all the
[1:26:08] word that's gathered up to Luther Wesley
[1:26:10] Baptist that's why we're going to have
[1:26:11] to go through the church ages and all
[1:26:13] that and the Pentecostal all gathered up
[1:26:15] to the revelation of what it's all been
[1:26:17] now watch the seventh angel was to open
[1:26:21] the six seal mystery now you say boy he
[1:26:24] missed it
[1:26:27] there I thought it was seven seal
[1:26:31] mystery I'm reading what he
[1:26:34] said what is the seventh
[1:26:37] seal
[1:26:39] Christ when he preached the six
[1:26:41] seals he introduced Christ to
[1:26:45] us the seventh angel was to open the
[1:26:47] Sixth Seal mystery it's all to be
[1:26:49] gathered up in the son of man his
[1:26:51] fullness of time has come to the
[1:26:52] fullness of his word now to manifest the
[1:26:55] fullness of his body look how many times
[1:26:58] he said fullness his fullness of time
[1:27:00] has come to the fullness of his word to
[1:27:03] manifest the fullness of his body that's
[1:27:05] the word then that's the spoken word
[1:27:07] made manifest by the word revealing the
[1:27:09] word former latter rign
[1:27:14] 1960 watch the ministry of the Holy
[1:27:16] Spirit watch it today when it comes back
[1:27:18] the church has gradually been coming
[1:27:20] down the First Reformation was Luther we
[1:27:22] had a great big wide place he's talking
[1:27:24] about the pyramid justification by faith
[1:27:27] the church was shook then come along
[1:27:29] Wesley the second Big Revival it shook
[1:27:31] it down into sanctification the church
[1:27:33] became in a minority greatly in the
[1:27:35] minority then after that come Pentecost
[1:27:38] the restoration of the gifts it shook it
[1:27:40] down now just a little thing like a
[1:27:42] pyramid coming up but right at the end
[1:27:45] time before the Capstone can come to the
[1:27:48] pyramid what about it what is it then
[1:27:51] the church is really
[1:27:52] in the minority as it was in the days of
[1:27:55] Noah so will it be in the coming of the
[1:27:57] son of man where eight Souls were saved
[1:27:59] by water now the coming of the son of
[1:28:01] man what is it the church comes from
[1:28:04] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:28:06] the Holy Ghost and now former and latter
[1:28:08] rain coming together coming in and it is
[1:28:11] close approaching as my hand is a shadow
[1:28:14] it becomes closer darker darker and it
[1:28:16] becomes a hand and a shadow is the same
[1:28:20] that's what we're looking at
[1:28:23] and listen it's a
[1:28:25] pull so you got to have it inside if you
[1:28:28] don't have it inside no
[1:28:29] pull there's no if there's no magnetism
[1:28:32] inside of you to magnetize to what's
[1:28:35] coming you're just going to be left
[1:28:41] out oh we need to get praying we need to
[1:28:43] be in prayer service
[1:28:46] y
[1:28:48] but there's two things you can do if you
[1:28:50] going to give out money or feed them
[1:28:51] they'll come I thought I'd just say that
[1:28:54] for a minute Revelations 1:8 says I am
[1:28:57] Alpha and Omega the beginning and the
[1:29:00] ending sayith the Lord which is and
[1:29:03] which was and which is to come the
[1:29:05] almighty now this is God identifying
[1:29:07] himself I am Alpha and Omega the
[1:29:11] beginning and the ending which is which
[1:29:14] was and which is to come the Almighty I
[1:29:16] John who also was am your brother and
[1:29:19] companion in Tribulation and in the
[1:29:22] kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ now
[1:29:23] remember John tyed the what
[1:29:26] bride was in the aisle of patmas for the
[1:29:28] word of God that's juli and Gary just
[1:29:30] came back from there and for the
[1:29:32] testimony of Jesus Christ I was in the
[1:29:34] spirit on the Lord's day and heard
[1:29:37] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[1:29:40] now he heard a voice as of a trumpet
[1:29:42] saying I am Alpha and Omega the first
[1:29:44] and the last and what thou seest wri in
[1:29:47] a book and sited unto the seven churches
[1:29:49] which are in Asia this is God talking to
[1:29:52] John unto Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thyra
[1:29:56] Sardis Philadelphia and
[1:29:58] Lea and I turned to see the voice that
[1:30:01] spoke to me and being turned I saw seven
[1:30:04] golden
[1:30:05] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[1:30:07] seven golden candlesticks one liken to
[1:30:09] the son of man in other words someone
[1:30:11] standing there with flesh
[1:30:15] right clothed with a garment down to the
[1:30:18] feet and G about the paps appear Pap's
[1:30:20] breast with a golden girdle feminist

[1:30:26] just want to read this and this is where
[1:30:27] we're gonna get started next week his
[1:30:29] head and his hair were like wool as
[1:30:31] white as snow and his eyes were as flame
[1:30:33] of fire and his feet like a Define brass
[1:30:36] as if they burned in a furnace and his
[1:30:38] voice as the sound of many Waters and he
[1:30:41] had in his right hand Seven Stars and
[1:30:43] out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged
[1:30:45] sword in other words there was seven
[1:30:48] stars and there was seven messages or
[1:30:52] word that went out all right when a
[1:30:55] sharp two-edged sword and his
[1:30:56] countenance was as the sun shineth in
[1:30:58] its strength and when I saw him I fell
[1:31:01] at his feet as dead and he laid his
[1:31:03] right hand upon me saying unto me fear
[1:31:04] not I am the first and the last I am he
[1:31:08] that liveth and was dead and behold I'm
[1:31:10] alive forever more amen and have the
[1:31:12] keys of hell and of death in other words
