[3:01] to each and every one of us we love you
[3:03] and we thank you in Jesus name
[3:05] amen
[3:05] that we've been reading the same
[3:08] scripture for a while but we decided to
[3:10] not to not use the board because I
[3:13] wanted to give all of these so
[3:15] close to us so we won't need it
[3:19] tonight we're going to use the quotes
[3:21] that way everybody can read never
[3:24] reading from second from First
[3:26] Corinthians 11
[3:27] Verse 18 and 19 and then we're going to
[3:30] first Peter 3.
[3:33] for first of all when you come together
[3:35] in the church I hear that there'd be
[3:36] divisions among you and I partly believe
[3:38] it for there must must be also herishes
[3:42] among you that they which are approved
[3:43] may be made manifest among you and let's
[3:48] go over to Peter now and
[3:51] read the scripture in reading the 15th
[3:53] verse and the third chapter of First
[3:55] Peter
[3:58] but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts
[4:00] and be ready always to give an answer to
[4:02] every man that asks that you a reason or
[4:04] the hope that is in you with meekness
[4:06] and fear you may be seated over David's
[4:10] blessing to the reading of the word now
[4:12] William probably have a good bit of HEPA
[4:15] here so if you will come up and
[4:19] just get you a bundle of them and take
[4:21] them and pass them all out because that
[4:22] way we'll try our best to get to it
[4:25] tonight if you don't you'll have them
[4:26] and you know be able to read some things
[4:32] um you know the topic will be on tonight
[4:34] now we've been on
[4:36] um
[4:37] taking some of the doctrines of the
[4:40] of the people of the message
[4:43] and trying to cover some things and then
[4:46] as we read during the skipper that we
[4:48] give a reason and a hope that is within
[4:50] us and you know trying to to express to
[4:54] you what we believe and uh and why we
[4:57] believe it that away and not to just say
[5:00] well I believe this don't believe that
[5:02] just you know I'm going down the line
[5:04] but you know we we have probably another
[5:07] at least another service or two uh to be
[5:11] able to cover some things
[5:13] but we've covered like two Souls Two
[5:15] Lords Jesus wouldn't God to the River
[5:18] Jordan the seventh under virtues and
[5:20] then went through into the Thunders from
[5:23] there we've covered you know some
[5:25] believe the Holy Ghost is not here like
[5:27] it was on a death Pentecost
[5:29] and some believe that brother Branham
[5:31] was the one that come to John on Patmos
[5:33] and then we covered in that part that we
[5:35] do not believe that brother random was
[5:37] deity because we don't believe it that
[5:39] way
[5:40] believe all born-again believers
[5:43] with a baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[5:46] deity living inside of them
[5:48] but that way we don't worship the god in
[5:51] each one other we worship the god of
[5:53] Glory then we covered uh how that
[5:57] uh we're not looking for another Prophet
[6:00] to come because we believe that the
[6:02] prophet of God brought the message unto
[6:04] us
[6:05] and the next major prophet to come on
[6:07] the scene in the world is supposed to be
[6:10] to the two witnesses going to Israel
[6:13] all right then we got down into the last
[6:16] message that we were covering and
[6:20] talking about how that we do not believe
[6:22] that Adam injected his seed into Eve to
[6:26] save her
[6:28] um but what we believe is that
[6:32] you know that wouldn't what inspired her
[6:33] from being killed it was the point that
[6:37] God himself had already promised and Eve
[6:40] was a part of Adam just the same as as
[6:43] several was a part of Abraham all right
[6:46] trying to get a few things in line there
[6:49] and then we went in to uh Judah and
[6:51] Tamar and covering that because that was
[6:55] one that has a lot of people's use with
[6:58] even things in believing you know if you
[7:02] will put these kind of lay them out on
[7:04] the front where we can keep them from
[7:06] being piled together
[7:07] you know if you will just lay them out
[7:10] and that way somebody can get them for
[7:12] want some like if they hear it on tape
[7:15] they will want these and we'll do it for
[7:17] them Sunday but you know we went through
[7:20] basically all of those things and
[7:22] remember on each one of them I've made
[7:24] this statement that
[7:27] I speak of these things up on the basis
[7:30] of what I've heard
[7:32] uh some of it personally so knowing some
[7:36] of these people that I have spoke about
[7:38] the doctrines and the things and her
[7:42] personally takes and things you know of
[7:45] these but speaking as far as you know
[7:48] just to say you of what I've heard and
[7:50] then I I tell you this way that uh each
[7:54] one of these doctrines there's
[7:56] um you know a lot of different views
[7:59] that goes with each one of the the
[8:02] doctrines that we brought out and
[8:04] everybody doesn't call her the same
[8:07] belief you know because that wouldn't
[8:10] that wouldn't work out see it would uh
[8:12] it would uh it would cabbage down too
[8:15] quick so you've got this person
[8:17] believing this this person believing
[8:19] that but they all hold to a basis of of
[8:23] their thoughts and their Doctrine you
[8:25] know and doing it
[8:27] and I was talking our Sunday about that
[8:31] you know that brother Randall said it
[8:33] wouldn't hard they said about Luther to
[8:36] be able to protest the Catholic Church
[8:39] the hard part was was to hold his head
[8:41] up above all of the fanaticism that
[8:44] followed around where he was at in his
[8:46] message of the people believing he was
[8:49] God believing he was this believe it
[8:50] anybody that ever had to move going it
[8:54] the people run to the wrong thing and
[8:57] try to make the person the wrong thing
[8:59] and all like that but now we're going to
[9:02] speak tonight as we've come down to to
[9:04] bring it in one of the doctrines that
[9:07] you know we want to speak on and this
[9:11] Doctrine has been around ever since we
[9:13] started in the message it was one of the
[9:16] first ones that come into view with us
[9:20] Long Bar in about 68 you know 67.
[9:25] and it was that some people believed
[9:27] that brother Brown was going to come
[9:29] back
[9:30] and put up a tent
[9:33] and go across the country
[9:36] you know
[9:38] and and preach
[9:40] to people and I preached to the to the
[9:43] bride
[9:44] all right
[9:45] and then there is another group as I
[9:48] said this group will go this way and
[9:50] this group will go this way and they'll
[9:52] all even argue with each other about
[9:55] what they believe
[9:57] and now in the past 20 years or so they
[10:01] started the thoughts on that they call
[10:03] it the return Ministry all right and
[10:06] that's that's more of what they're
[10:08] saying now you don't hear much said
[10:10] about the old tent uh Doctrine or style
[10:13] that it's more or less now called a
[10:15] return Ministry
[10:18] now I believe that what the prophet said
[10:22] unto us about
[10:24] uh the tent and the things
[10:27] and divisions that he had I believe that
[10:30] God gave those to him and you know and
[10:33] and I I believe that right but I just
[10:36] don't follow after uh you know some
[10:39] thoughts that people had
[10:42] um some believe literally that then I
[10:44] heard a man personally you know listen
[10:46] to him on a tape that he said that
[10:49] brother random was going to we'd have to
[10:51] go through this little room and brother
[10:52] Brown was going to speak or speak us a
[10:55] glorified body
[10:57] from that little room you know and doing
[11:00] uh he's going to see then that's the way
[11:02] it is and the same ones are the ones
[11:05] that uh you know they supposed to have
[11:08] an airplane
[11:09] that they're built big enough you know
[11:12] and and things to where that he could
[11:15] fly about the country and and do those
[11:18] things and some people make fun of this
[11:20] group and come find out they believe
[11:22] just a little over on the other line of
[11:24] it you know and they'll make fun of this
[11:27] group and that group will make fun of
[11:28] this group and and all like that I don't
[11:31] believe that's right I heard a man
[11:33] speaking one time and I told his other
[11:35] brother I said I'd probably agree more
[11:38] with what he says than I would with you
[11:41] but I said he was out of line because he
[11:44] was not invited to speak he just got up
[11:47] to testify and he just rolled out all of
[11:50] this about the tent that he believed you
[11:52] know he just couldn't hold it he had to
[11:55] let out what he thought and all like
[11:57] that but see I've been around here now
[12:00] for 40 something years
[12:02] and I'm I'm just to the point that I
[12:06] don't want to argue with anybody about
[12:08] it but I want to express to you you know
[12:11] kind of what I believe and and the
[12:13] thoughts of it and I've never
[12:15] really tried to explain it because I
[12:19] don't believe there's no need of trying
[12:21] to explain a vision that a prophet would
[12:24] have
[12:26] I believe it would take God to explain
[12:28] that I believe it would take the profit
[12:31] getting the revelation
[12:33] to explain that I don't think any
[12:35] individual you me or whoever would be
[12:38] would be capable of of trying to
[12:42] imperfect
[12:44] right what is said by a vision to a
[12:48] prophet even visions that you and I
[12:51] would have right see we would need the
[12:55] profit to interpret those Visions or
[12:57] dreams or things you know people say
[13:00] well I had a dream and it was this that
[13:01] and the other one where will it compare
[13:03] with the scripture you know and that way
[13:06] if it won't then uh you know we don't
[13:09] believe that it comes from God it makes
[13:11] it come from somewhere else but I'm just
[13:14] saying that part because a lot of people
[13:17] believe that there are certain things
[13:18] that that
[13:20] brother Branham didn't preach
[13:23] that he will have to come back and and
[13:27] and preach those things to us you know
[13:30] and uh
[13:31] we will try to just read what he said
[13:34] and where these people get all of these
[13:36] talks and ideas and a lot of them say
[13:39] well he told me personally
[13:41] well that's all right
[13:43] uh you know that's that's that's fine
[13:45] for for what you believe the prophet
[13:48] calls you
[13:49] but I I also believe that uh
[13:54] just show you how far people can go
[13:57] there was a certain brother in the
[13:59] message that brother Branham said he
[14:00] died
[14:02] their own if there's one of them at the
[14:04] church start the Tabernacle and his
[14:07] nurse for his wife was a nurse and she
[14:09] said he was dead his eyes were thrown
[14:11] back and everything well see that all
[14:13] went good until brother Brown
[14:15] disappeared you know from the scene and
[14:17] then you know he came for saying he
[14:19] wasn't even dead
[14:21] well I'd rather believe what the prophet
[14:23] had to say about it than for him right
[14:25] but I just think that people you know
[14:27] that they they get into a situations
[14:30] sometimes and and they'll say brother
[14:32] random call me personally what to do and
[14:36] this certain brother he used to say that
[14:38] a lot and you know it was making people
[14:41] lean toward him because in that message
[14:45] we were talking about the seven Thunders
[14:47] and things he was one of those that
[14:50] people believe was going to be one of
[14:51] those Thunders was going to be that man
[14:53] when he preached and so one day I
[14:56] decided because I'm just that way I just
[14:58] you know I like to get down to the great
[15:00] you know just to wear everything stands
[15:02] and asks questions so ask the brother I
[15:04] said well why did Brother round tell you
[15:06] to preach
[15:07] I've heard you say you know he told you
[15:09] to preach you know what did he tell you
[15:12] to preach he said he told me to praise
[15:13] hell and it hot
[15:16] vegetable Gray
[15:18] you know
[15:19] he'd tell any preacher then yeah but see
[15:22] he had everybody thinking that there was
[15:24] something that brought around told him
[15:26] to preach you know some Revelation some
[15:30] thought and I'll just you know I just
[15:33] like to get down there and ask and I
[15:35] just asking that's what he said now
[15:37] he said he's always preach hell in that
[15:39] heart hail fire in it hot that's what he
[15:41] said amen but I you know I've heard a
[15:44] lot about the tent
[15:46] I've heard a lot of people making their
[15:49] opinions and their thoughts
[15:51] and I go back to what exactly I said a
[15:54] moment ago where would it would be any
[15:57] human mortal capable of interpreting a
[16:01] vision or dream of a prophet right it
[16:04] would take his own uh God would have to
[16:08] speak to him right
[16:10] and to do it so we try to figure it out
[16:12] you know in our own cells well we
[16:15] believe this means this and this means
[16:17] that I've heard that the uh the tent
[16:20] Doctrine the thing was of
[16:23] like you're it was inside of you and and
[16:27] that that inner Intervale
[16:30] was what that little room that you know
[16:32] was to uh be there and uh you know your
[16:36] soul and your being and that little room
[16:39] was that is spoken of in the tent Vision
[16:41] that that was the heart of man
[16:44] well you know that's
[16:46] those may be true but still there's
[16:48] somebody trying to interpret yeah what a
[16:52] prophet has to say
[16:54] so I say if I'll speak where the Prophet
[16:57] spoke about it he said if God doesn't
[17:00] come behind and vindicate that what can
[17:03] we believe right right all right and see
[17:05] that away we we just stay with it and go
[17:08] on down the road you know the biggest
[17:11] problem that I have seen among a lot of
[17:14] the Believers of the message is that
[17:17] those who literally believe in return
[17:19] Ministries and and tent Visions uh they
[17:23] also don't believe too much into the
[17:26] revealing of the word
[17:28] and they're just kind of sitting waiting
[17:30] and I think we need to be prepared don't
[17:34] you right and regardless of whether or
[17:36] not brother random is going to come back
[17:37] and speak to us whatever uh we would
[17:41] have to be prepared that's what I would
[17:43] ask the question that one time
[17:45] and you know and my answer was
[17:49] if run around come right here and put up
[17:51] a tent right here you wouldn't know what
[17:52] he's talking about that's right that's
[17:54] just the reason is you don't know what
[17:56] he's already talking and said to us
[17:58] because I'd say something wrote around
[18:00] saying that people would even say well
[18:02] he didn't say that
[18:06] when I just heard that tape the other
[18:08] day and he didn't say that on that page
[18:10] so I got worried that when I was brown I
[18:12] just bring a book and just so okay read
[18:14] it if I had a book but didn't I copy it
[18:16] off the table hand it out because you
[18:19] know and I told him that was the reason
[18:21] I was saying that right I believe we
[18:23] need to get into the message of the hour
[18:25] I don't believe that we need to play
[18:28] around and I've always said that we make
[18:30] light of the
[18:33] um the uh you know Muhammad is there a
[18:36] Doctrine ever what it is you know
[18:38] where's Muhammad but that
[18:40] Muhammad is supposed to raise up you
[18:42] know
[18:43] and and ride around the of the
[18:45] world well there's one thing about it
[18:48] for about 2 000 years now and almost
[18:50] they have been changing that white horse
[18:54] they at least believe it that way they
[18:56] at least change the White Horse every so
[18:58] often and keep them saddled up ready for
[19:00] it to happen because they're believing
[19:02] that much and the brothers that were
[19:05] supposed to fly the airplane they said
[19:07] themselves
[19:08] from the tape that heard that that the
[19:12] claim that they believed right around
[19:13] was speaking of that it would take two
[19:15] years for them to be able to get it back
[19:17] in flying condition well I've always
[19:20] told you that if I believe right around
[19:22] told me to get an airplane and have it
[19:24] ready then that airplane every day would
[19:26] taxi down off there Ryan would have to
[19:28] take it out every day and he'd have to
[19:30] fly it out
[19:32] and test it and he'd come back and if it
[19:34] didn't take but one gallon of gas I'd
[19:37] want it filled right back up you know
[19:39] I'd want to be ready wouldn't you well
[19:42] that's what I'm leaving following the
[19:43] message right
[19:44] I want to study the message to word that
[19:49] if anything happens then I can relate to
[19:52] the message
[19:53] and see what is going on let me see and
[19:56] be ready against that day
[19:58] but you know now there's a lot of things
[20:01] that I said goes with it and everybody
[20:03] doesn't believe all the same thing
[20:05] I give credit to where credit is due and
[20:08] you know and and all like that and they
[20:11] were saying said that like I said if if
[20:14] we'd have been around brother random boy
[20:16] some people were and the way he's done
[20:19] and and that God would just show him
[20:21] everything you know and and and like
[20:24] that brother Banks would say that down
[20:26] or one through the woods there said well
[20:28] anybody that can show you what how many
[20:30] tell you how many fish You're Gonna
[20:31] Catch and show you where they're at you
[20:33] don't be bound to believe him well I
[20:35] guess it would get too close
[20:37] to a lot of people right and looking for
[20:40] that
[20:41] well I'm still I'm to the point that I I
[20:44] haven't wanted to change horses
[20:47] you know what I mean by that and then
[20:49] our human terminologies to somebody
[20:51] listening uh you don't change horses in
[20:54] the middle of the Stream
[20:55] you know you're going to get wet
[20:58] get the buggy or the wagon or what out
[21:01] of the water all right before you change
[21:03] horses don't change them in the middle
[21:05] of the stream it's our old
[21:08] faithful saying is in other words be
[21:11] prepared right right you know be ready
[21:13] against that day as the Bible said as we
[21:16] were reading there to give a reasonable
[21:18] hope that is within us right and it has
[21:20] become around the land today
[21:23] an embarrassing situation in a lot of
[21:26] respect because once you try to
[21:29] introduce somebody to the message
[21:32] they go and the first thing they do is
[21:35] they just go click on their computer and
[21:37] they run in William Branham well when
[21:40] they do they they don't get a good
[21:44] start right right
[21:46] because they're that all of the
[21:49] fanaticism will be brought up first all
[21:53] of the problems and the people what they
[21:55] believe comes up first
[21:57] you know people believe in he's God
[21:59] believing he's this believing he's the
[22:01] son of man believing all kind of things
[22:03] and uh it's kind of like somebody asked
[22:06] brother Carly one time there said does
[22:09] them people up there believe in you know
[22:11] living with their wife his husband and
[22:13] wife he said yesterday sure do well
[22:16] there's a lot of kids around here kind
[22:18] of proves that I guess you could call it
[22:19] that way you know but
[22:22] um my mother-in-law they got out that we
[22:25] just all believed in beating their wives
[22:27] you know and uh you know and so they
[22:31] asked my mother-in-law about it and uh
[22:33] my mother-in-law didn't say very much
[22:35] but when she spoke she was blunt she
[22:37] said I've known Sam a long time and he
[22:39] ain't gonna beat Piggy
[22:42] that was a good you know it was good for
[22:45] her to be that way
[22:46] but now like I say when we get into this
[22:50] let's just read the things and I tried
[22:52] to to remember as much as possible and
[22:56] run off as much as I could do and deal
[22:58] with the things of and I know I missed a
[23:01] lot that is used and what we're trying
[23:04] to do is we'll read about three
[23:05] different times they brought around
[23:07] them's Tales the the what is called the
[23:09] tent Vision or the vision that he had
[23:12] from the Lord
[23:13] and then we will read some things that
[23:16] if we have time tonight if we don't
[23:18] we'll take it up later on we will try to
[23:21] read some things that people think
[23:24] of what the the uh tent Vision means you
[23:27] know and and the reason they believe it
[23:30] that away so now let's just start off
[23:32] you guys you know you got a lot of notes
[23:34] so we're going to have to read a lot and
[23:36] that's reason I didn't choose to put it
[23:37] up on the the bulletin board to be that
[23:40] much reading uh you know so we'll just
[23:43] read these things now the first time
[23:46] that I know of
[23:48] and he mentions it either in this one or
[23:51] the other one that's right after it
[23:53] This was um
[23:55] January the 1st 1956.
[24:00] was the first time he mentions that I
[24:03] can find or what we would be talking
[24:05] about the tent Vision all right now
[24:08] there's a lot goes with this Vision so
[24:11] you'll have to read it and we'll read it
[24:13] in other accounts that he tells us and
[24:16] you'll see some things were added
[24:19] some things where wordings were
[24:21] different
[24:22] sometimes and you know and it goes into
[24:26] giving I believe a better understanding
[24:28] but it's on a message called why are
[24:32] people so tossed about
[24:34] all right now that originally used to be
[24:38] the message that was called inner Veil
[24:41] now not Intervale
[24:44] Intervale was a message preached like
[24:48] um January the 21st
[24:51] of 1956 but this was the old message
[24:54] that used to be titled inner Veil and
[24:58] they title they changed the title if you
[25:00] look in your little book that shows you
[25:02] the the tapes and the of the books and
[25:04] the things you look at you'll see where
[25:06] it was changed they changed it to why
[25:08] are people so tossed about but it's 1956
[25:11] January the 1st so let's just read a
[25:14] little bit
[25:18] now giving you a background to where
[25:20] he's starting from
[25:23] to save Heavens to bring all of that
[25:25] when we read here about you know I was
[25:28] going to tell them in Arizona don't tell
[25:30] them this that what he had done wrote a
[25:34] random one out and was preaching and he
[25:36] always told the Lord
[25:37] he said if you ever come to the bases
[25:40] that you do not supply the money
[25:43] you know about having to bag for it he
[25:46] fired uh campaign managers because they
[25:49] begged for money and things and he would
[25:52] they would take up only for the meetings
[25:54] and then they would take up a love
[25:56] offering well he would always say he'd
[25:58] say now this love offering
[26:00] not a penny of it will come to me he
[26:03] said I get a salary from the church and
[26:05] back then he told what it was it was a
[26:07] hundred dollars a week
[26:09] so in 56 that wasn't a lot of money
[26:11] and you'll have you there's one thing
[26:14] that you won't find
[26:15] you get any of them to you get anybody
[26:19] to tell you that run around was after
[26:20] money right you know you know we're Oral
[26:23] Roberts had to have millions and
[26:25] millions of dollars to run his his
[26:27] doings and swaggers with like right
[26:30] before his fall he had like 170 million
[26:34] dollars a year coming in
[26:36] you know and brother Brown had a little
[26:38] old trailer sitting up there and
[26:40] volunteer people to send out prayer
[26:43] cards you know clothes sometimes and uh
[26:46] but the Lord told him said now this is
[26:48] your
[26:49] this is your place to preach out to the
[26:51] world but that's what he was doing and
[26:55] he got in a meeting up there and they
[26:57] went fifteen thousand dollars in the
[26:58] hole
[26:59] on a meeting because it was a big
[27:01] campaign in other words he'd be carrying
[27:04] things too and people that went with him
[27:06] and all like that and they went fifteen
[27:09] thousand dollars in the hole and he told
[27:11] the Lord he said I'm going home
[27:14] I'm coming off the field
[27:16] and you'll hear him saying these things
[27:18] as we read along in a minute that he
[27:20] said you know I'll just go back and I'll
[27:21] help brother
[27:23] um
[27:24] soft wouldn't build houses or do houses
[27:26] or do something or try to get an old job
[27:28] back and and everything and so you'll
[27:31] know this is what he was doing because
[27:33] he was coming off the field
[27:36] because the Lord didn't Supply the money
[27:38] now people before he left to come back
[27:42] and already told him and they did the
[27:44] under of what you call it underwriting
[27:46] they underwrote the the the
[27:50] campaign and pay it off in other words
[27:53] but he says later he said I will pay
[27:56] them back for that all right and that's
[28:00] kind of a background now that's when we
[28:02] we're doing it so watch what he's doing
[28:03] he's coming home he's going to tell his
[28:05] family on the way to Jeffersonville what
[28:08] he's going to do
[28:09] and he could never get up enough nerve
[28:11] to do it so watch what he's saying so
[28:13] we'll start reading from page four
[28:16] now why are people so tossed about
[28:18] 1956-101
[28:20] . so I said I'll tell them when I get to
[28:22] Arizona
[28:23] after I left California
[28:25] I didn't have the nerve
[28:27] so after I said when in Mexico and on
[28:30] and on to them
[28:32] till till told them coming down
[28:36] coming right down here in Indiana when
[28:39] you got right on the home he told him
[28:41] what he's going to do
[28:43] but they they understood it pretty well
[28:46] Billy didn't get it too well he said
[28:48] Daddy I think you're making a mistake
[28:50] my own tired weary upset crying went to
[28:53] bed that night and after the wife not to
[28:56] sleep I went in the room and held down
[28:57] and said dear Jesus I don't know what
[28:59] I'm going to do here I am right back
[29:01] where I started from again I guess I
[29:04] made them failure about two hours for
[29:07] then from then he appeared to me and he
[29:10] showed me a vision of such a panoramic
[29:12] view of people
[29:13] I never seen I was talking to my wife in
[29:16] The Vision now watch him it's all in a
[29:19] vision now
[29:22] now you people that know me know I'm not
[29:25] a fanatic I don't say these things
[29:27] unless they're the truth that's right
[29:29] and I I've seen it
[29:32] then I seen brother Oregon bright
[29:35] standing there and I went up to him now
[29:38] this is in his mission and he said
[29:39] brother Bailey said we're giving out all
[29:42] the prayer cards and everything's ready
[29:43] now for the meeting we got a way to get
[29:46] you in and out
[29:47] I said thank you brother organ Brian
[29:50] and I walked over to some more brilliant
[29:52] and there was another brother preaching
[29:54] I said who's he
[29:56] he said they put him up I said who is
[29:59] they
[30:01] and they just turned or just turned
[30:04] around walked away
[30:05] and the man made dismissed the audience
[30:08] and let them all go and I said oh you
[30:10] shouldn't do that because there is
[30:12] there's no order call
[30:14] and they said another Feller spoke to me
[30:17] and said we done took up the offering
[30:20] I said when is the offering more
[30:22] important than Souls before Christ now
[30:24] that was the background of the vision
[30:26] part starting so at that time the angel
[30:29] of the Lord taken me out and he taken me
[30:32] to a real bright stream of water
[30:35] it was the most beautiful blue water and
[30:37] great fish were swimming around in it he
[30:40] said I'll make you a Fisher
[30:41] and he said Now cast your Allure into
[30:43] the water and when you do pull it slow
[30:46] first time and the next time just give
[30:48] it a little jerk not too hard and the
[30:51] next time set your hook for the catch
[30:53] and I started to throw my line in the
[30:55] water and I pulled and everybody began
[30:57] rejoicing and saying that's wonderful
[30:59] that's wonderful
[31:01] I got all excited and jerked it hard on
[31:03] the next one out I pulled the fish
[31:07] and all out of the water now this is his
[31:10] vision now that you can see
[31:11] and what was it it was a little bitty
[31:13] fish and it just about the size of the
[31:17] lure
[31:18] no matter who's going to interpret all
[31:20] these things
[31:21] and I got my line all tangled up and I
[31:23] was straightening out my line and the
[31:25] man which was talking behind me walked
[31:28] around in front of me dressed in
[31:29] Palestinian clothes and turban on his
[31:31] head he had a white robe he said brother
[31:33] Brown that's it
[31:35] that's it
[31:37] I know I didn't do right
[31:39] I said I jerked you without not to he
[31:42] said don't get your lime tangled up in
[31:44] these kind of times and I said well I'm
[31:46] running either straight as I can
[31:49] now be very careful he said now the
[31:51] first time
[31:52] and remember these first time second
[31:54] time third time keep all this as we read
[31:58] the next accounts and watch what he said
[32:01] now the first time I spoke spoke with
[32:03] you
[32:04] you put your hand out and we'll read in
[32:06] just a minute this Angel come here was
[32:08] the one that always come to him
[32:10] you know all right
[32:12] so the first time I spoke with you you
[32:15] put your hands on the people and told
[32:16] him what was wrong with him and the
[32:19] second cool why when you did you would
[32:21] know the secrets of their hearts and a
[32:24] major Seer before the people but you was
[32:27] always trying to explain it you ought to
[32:29] have done that he said you made a public
[32:31] show showing out of it I said I'm very
[32:35] sorry now you know in his ministry that
[32:37] that's what he done he he would go out
[32:39] and run around when he started in his
[32:40] first Ministry
[32:42] he would take people by the hand
[32:44] and his hand would to somebody that
[32:46] haven't heard these things his hand
[32:48] would change and be pimples on it and
[32:51] different things and and he'd say I see
[32:53] you have cancer
[32:54] you need to say it's on your left lung
[32:56] you couldn't even wear a watch while
[32:58] those things were taking place it would
[33:00] just quit
[33:01] you know because it was a supernatural
[33:03] thing that was transpiring and he would
[33:06] know those things and then he went on
[33:08] later in his ministry didn't know even
[33:10] the secrets of the people's hearts to
[33:12] where he would discern out and tell him
[33:14] you know what was they were even
[33:16] thinking and the things in a reason why
[33:18] just expressing that little point there
[33:20] on the point all right continue on to
[33:22] reading them
[33:24] then he taken me up taking me from there
[33:27] and I seen a great huge tent I never
[33:30] seen such a attempt and it was packed
[33:34] and lined everywhere with people and I
[33:36] walked out to the looked like I was
[33:37] standing above the people looking down
[33:40] where I just made an article and
[33:42] hundreds and hundreds of people were
[33:44] weeping and rejoicing after they had
[33:46] accepted the Lord Jesus as their savior
[33:48] and I looked and then heard a man get up
[33:51] and say call the prayer line and people
[33:54] begin to line up over on this side the
[33:57] left or where I was looking down towards
[33:59] the platforms you know he was looking
[34:01] down to the platform to be on the left
[34:03] now you'll see him once you he'll turn
[34:05] around he explains it
[34:08] they lined all the way up and down the
[34:10] street for a prayer line
[34:11] I noticed to my left which would have
[34:13] been to my right if I was on the
[34:16] platform now that's to where the little
[34:18] room is going to appear and the things
[34:21] are going to happen
[34:22] we'll be on his right side okay
[34:24] a little wooden building and I've seen
[34:26] that light that oh they have the picture
[34:29] of you know that's always in the meeting
[34:32] I've seen that light leave me and go to
[34:33] that building and go in that building
[34:35] and a voice said to me I'll meet you in
[34:37] there that'll be the third pool I said
[34:40] why he said well it won't be a public
[34:43] show like the other and I came to and
[34:47] now at the beginning of this year back
[34:49] to my Tabernacle where I started from
[34:50] see back to the beginning where I
[34:52] started I am very grateful to God for
[34:55] these things
[34:56] and many of you knows that just before
[34:59] leaving on the other Crusade about eight
[35:02] or ten years
[35:03] I think about 10 years since well nine
[35:07] years it has been it was these things
[35:10] were told exactly how they Auditorium
[35:12] Services you remember exactly how that
[35:15] brother Laughlin would live exactly
[35:17] three years and then be taken away that
[35:20] brother wood would build a tabernacle
[35:21] down and this Ward would build a
[35:23] tabernacle down in this position this
[35:25] direction here and all of it just
[35:28] exactly you know what your Old-Timers it
[35:31] happened just that way and so will this
[35:34] foreign Jesus
[35:45] all right so now he told that
[35:48] that's the vision that he saw
[35:51] the vision of him
[35:53] trying to catch some fish
[35:57] and Vine gets all tangled up
[36:01] and the Lord shows him in it this is the
[36:03] first pull you've done this away the
[36:06] second pull you would know the secrets
[36:07] of the heart and he said then it would
[36:09] go to the third pool all right now the
[36:14] Lord Jesus had three pools we know that
[36:16] right
[36:17] see because that's what he done in his
[36:19] last pool was was preaching to the
[36:21] totally lost all right but now I just
[36:25] picked up one year
[36:27] and put it in to to not to try to
[36:31] interpret but to to show you what he was
[36:33] saying because he said he was looking
[36:34] forward to some of the greatest meetings
[36:36] bring for the greatest meetings look at
[36:39] number two on your notes 1962-908
[36:43] hey paragraph 16 president stage of my
[36:45] ministry as far as I know that every
[36:48] Vision he's ever given me has been
[36:50] fulfilled except the one now this is
[36:53] 1962-908
[36:55] .
[36:58] except the one that I'm a change in my
[37:01] Ministry to where I'm to pray for people
[37:04] in a little place like a little room
[37:05] under a tent
[37:07] or a big Auditorium or something
[37:10] it looked to me like a tent you remember
[37:12] that two or three years ago
[37:14] most of it was brought to pass I was to
[37:18] go down in Mexico and how it would rain
[37:20] that night and what would take place
[37:22] down there he told me my Ministry of the
[37:25] first pool remember about catching the
[37:28] little bitty fish are missing it second
[37:30] was a small fish then he told me the
[37:33] third floor don't fail he said don't
[37:36] tell people I've always tried to explain
[37:38] what I'm trying to do
[37:40] he let me know not to tell people what
[37:44] you're doing just do what he tells me to
[37:47] do and let it alone so he tried to
[37:49] explain the the working of the hand
[37:54] the stalks and it created in the
[37:58] Pentecostal realm a lot of fanaticism
[38:01] because everybody wanted to have a gift
[38:06] and they could feel it they could see it
[38:08] they could smell it they could they had
[38:10] all kind of doctrines in the
[38:11] Pentecostals that would uh you know
[38:15] trying to copy after what brother Brown
[38:18] was doing but they couldn't cop the
[38:21] after and one time he said I'll show you
[38:23] if you need these we can get it he said
[38:26] at some of these days I'll show you that
[38:27] wasn't even right
[38:29] but it was to expose all of the
[38:31] fanaticism right all right
[38:34] in other words he shouldn't have tried
[38:36] to explain none of it he should have
[38:38] went on the way he was all right now as
[38:42] I said he in this one he just mentions
[38:44] on the room
[38:46] he just mentions things all right now
[38:50] you'll see it as he keeps saying it over
[38:52] and over that he keeps adding things to
[38:55] it not something different but more
[38:57] information
[39:00] would be brought into being so now let's
[39:02] go to another one where he tells the
[39:05] same thing I'm sorry for reading all
[39:06] this but it's necessary
[39:09] you know go to number three on your
[39:12] notes which is being litter the Holy
[39:14] Spirit preached in 1956 219 starting off
[39:18] on e22 and it goes for a long ways
[39:22] all right but I want you to get the
[39:24] difference in one and the other
[39:25] so everybody got it look at the number
[39:27] three on the left side and the big old
[39:29] line goes down means this is continual
[39:31] reading okay so that's why it's on her
[39:34] like that
[39:37] and just then I want you to watch this
[39:39] and listen how it's
[39:41] it is now
[39:42] so you watch the difference then I heard
[39:44] something whipping around where where
[39:46] you know
[39:48] like that always goes every time that we
[39:51] have a healing service that's just what
[39:54] happened that's the way that it always
[39:55] sounded sounded that way in the bush
[39:58] that time when I heard it it's always
[40:00] been that way
[40:01] and I failed it I heard it rather going
[40:04] moving and I looked and here went that
[40:07] real soft light moving away from me and
[40:09] went down and went into that little
[40:11] building
[40:12] you remember the little building that
[40:14] was in the original that he told
[40:18] and there's something different between
[40:19] the light and the angel because he was
[40:22] still there with me and the light had
[40:24] went into the building
[40:25] and this Angel which speak which still
[40:28] speaking behind me which is a big man he
[40:31] said I'll meet you in there so then I
[40:33] said I don't understand why in dark
[40:36] and he's talking about the little room
[40:37] with the part of the vision that we read
[40:39] before he said watch this woman when she
[40:43] come out of there on the outlet
[40:45] stretcher she was pushing the stretcher
[40:48] out of the other side
[40:50] that's why they think he's got to have
[40:52] this
[40:54] to come to be able to fulfilled to see
[40:56] like going through this room and being
[40:59] healed in in the different things
[41:02] she said I and she said the lady asked
[41:06] with the said what happened she said I
[41:10] don't know it just happened
[41:12] she said I've been in this stretcher
[41:14] said I've been down in bed for years and
[41:18] here come the man out packing his
[41:20] crutches
[41:21] and they asked him what what
[41:24] did he didn't know and he was coming to
[41:26] the platform to testify and I said I
[41:28] don't understand that though
[41:30] and once he's always scriptural
[41:32] he said did not our Lord say when thou
[41:35] praise be not like the Hypocrites that
[41:38] like to make a show he said enter into
[41:40] your secret closet and when you've done
[41:43] so close the door then pray to your
[41:45] father which see it in secret and he
[41:47] that seeth in secret shall reward the
[41:49] openly and he said Remember the Name
[41:51] that you were hunting that time
[41:53] that you dreamed about and I said he
[41:56] said I'll meet you in there
[41:58] this time it won't be a public Show and

[46:06] what you're speaking of Bill
[46:09] and I said well and I looked coming
[46:11] moving from the ceiling
[46:14] I want to just maybe I couldn't expect
[46:16] you to understand it
[46:18] but that's something that when we meet
[46:20] in the face to face with Jesus
[46:23] you will we shall know them
[46:25] you're done something moving I've seen
[46:27] little black-faced children come moving
[46:30] down if you'll notice in one of these he
[46:32] said now some of these things was
[46:34] fulfilled and he went to Mexico
[46:37] now that's in the park he went to Mexico
[46:40] and it was supposed to start because of
[46:43] that in a certain woman supposed to come
[46:44] to the platform certain things just
[46:46] cause all this tied together
[46:48] uh
[46:50] Here Comes something moving I've seen
[46:52] true little dark Face children come
[46:54] moving down pulling a little wagon I
[46:56] said sweetheart Luke come in here I was
[46:59] done gone then she said what you talking
[47:01] about I could hear her but I couldn't
[47:03] answer her and these little children was
[47:05] walking towards me a little kind of long
[47:08] hair and black dark eyes brown face
[47:11] coming walking to me
[47:13] and I I seen them I started moving on
[47:16] towards the children I've seen Mr
[47:17] augenbright my brother just went
[47:19] overseas with me many times seen him
[47:21] standing there looking at me I moved on
[47:23] to him now I could hear my wife walking
[47:27] around in the room I'll see it this way
[47:30] so that you'll understand it it might
[47:31] not be the right words but you'll
[47:33] understand so you'll understand that one
[47:35] dimension I was in I moved out there
[47:38] into another I could hear her walking no
[47:40] more it was gone I seen Mr auger riding
[47:43] he he was his peculiar little way the
[47:46] way he holds his head and economy smiles
[47:49] and he looks at me and he said run
[47:51] around and said we put out cards
[47:53] everywhere and we gotta wait for you to
[47:55] get in and out and everything's ready
[47:57] and I said all right brother all them
[47:59] back which way shall I go he said just
[48:02] just keep on and I walked on and I've
[48:06] had some ministers then I walked a
[48:09] little further and I came into a great
[48:11] panoramic of Fire
[48:12] and all kind of looks like seating for
[48:15] thousands of people and just then I
[48:17] heard someone say the meetings dismissed
[48:21] well I said who dismissed it now
[48:23] remember this was in the other one that
[48:24] we were reading
[48:27] I said who's dismissed it how did they
[48:29] come to be dismissed and I was disgusted
[48:32] and said why is it dismissed what
[48:34] happened it was sprinkling rain and
[48:36] something said to me by this you'll know
[48:41] then I said well I don't and I went in
[48:45] further into the vision and then when it
[48:48] did I was standing with you know a
[48:51] little baby's shoe of about a year old
[48:54] you know I said he's going to explain
[48:57] disease he's explaining the vision but
[49:00] now he's going to instead of speaking of
[49:02] fishing and different things he puts
[49:05] other things in to connect with the
[49:06] fishing
[49:08] picking up some point she'll watch what
[49:10] he gets cooking them in
[49:12] a little baby shoe about a year old you
[49:14] know a little bit of eyelids it's not a
[49:16] booty with a shoe and I had a string in
[49:19] my hand trying to lace this little
[49:21] inch eighth of an inch hole in this
[49:24] eyelet with about a half inch string so
[49:27] you know that was going pretty good just
[49:29] working perfectly trying to push that
[49:31] string through that half inch string
[49:33] through an eighth of an inch on it and I
[49:37] was breaking the threads all over the
[49:38] stream trying to push it through like
[49:40] that
[49:41] it just wouldn't do it and the string
[49:43] was being all broke up on the end so
[49:46] then I heard someone say behind me don't
[49:48] you understand you can't teach
[49:51] babies Supernatural things
[49:54] and I looked around and it was behind me
[49:57] and I recognized that boy she said
[49:59] you're using the wrong end of the string
[50:01] and I look down at the end of the string
[50:03] lying on the floor grab your powder
[50:06] spring and it was laced down to a nice
[50:07] eighth of an inch so it would go through
[50:10] the hole and I said I understand as I
[50:12] reached to pick up the string I was
[50:14] taken again
[50:15] see now he's still in division okay
[50:18] now you mark this down and watch it come
[50:20] to pass I started to reach down I was
[50:23] gone again when I come to I was standing
[50:25] by the side of a beautiful Lake
[50:26] something like your Lake out here in the
[50:28] summertime when it's real pretty and
[50:30] green and there were fishermen all
[50:33] around the lake and they were fishing
[50:35] but they were catching small fishes I
[50:38] looked out in the lake in those great
[50:40] beautiful rainbow trout out there and I
[50:43] said I know this is a vision but I can't
[50:46] understand those trout he said you know
[50:48] I believe right down in my heart I can't
[50:50] but I see it you know
[50:53] I believe right down in my heart I can
[50:55] catch those so I picked up the string
[50:58] but instead of it being a strain it was
[51:00] a fishing pole and just then the one
[51:02] behind me said I'll teach you to fish
[51:05] how to catch those
[51:08] so he took and he said town the Lord and
[51:11] I snapped a little wrong he said now
[51:12] throw away out now listen close way out
[51:15] into the deep and he said when you do
[51:17] now let the Lord sink down fast and he
[51:20] said pull it up pull it slow
[51:23] now that's really Fisherman's technique
[51:26] so he said then when you do now you're
[51:29] feeling some nibbles at it but don't
[51:31] tell nobody what you're doing keep it to
[51:34] yourself
[51:35] I said then when you when you feel it
[51:39] nibble again sit pull it just a little a
[51:42] little bit but not too hard he said then
[51:45] I'll pull it away from the then it'll
[51:47] pull it away from the little fish and
[51:49] when they scattered that'll attract the
[51:51] tension of the big fish and they'll grab
[51:53] it and say that's the way you'll catch
[51:55] it so then when they buy on the third
[51:58] time set your hook for the catch and I
[52:01] said I understand
[52:03] said
[52:04] but keep still don't tell nobody keep
[52:07] stealing I said all right
[52:09] I had to lower my hand and these
[52:11] fishermen turned out to be ministers
[52:13] they all come around saying brother
[52:15] random I know you can catch fish
[52:17] oh of course that made me feel real good
[52:20] so oh yes I'm a fisherman I can catch
[52:23] fish and he said I I said and he said I
[52:27] said now here's the way you do it he
[52:30] said you throw it way out and it went
[52:32] out into the to the deep water
[52:34] and that's it now those little fish are
[52:37] fine
[52:38] Brethren but we want the big ones too
[52:41] and I was I said see when it sinks down
[52:43] I see there is just about where it
[52:46] should be and I see there's seat Bears
[52:49] see that
[52:52] there are them little fish that's now
[52:54] when it sits again I give it a big great
[52:57] big jerk and when I did I pulled a
[52:59] holder around in the water and what it
[53:01] is I caught a fish but I wonder how he
[53:03] ever got the lure in his mouth
[53:05] those look like the skin was stretched
[53:08] over the lure about the size of the Lord
[53:10] I thought oh my
[53:14] just then the one who's been talking
[53:16] behind me stepped around in front of me
[53:18] it was him the angel of the Lord he had
[53:21] his hands folded he looked at me and
[53:22] said just what I told you not to do
[53:25] that's right
[53:26] he said you see the first pool when you
[53:28] used to put your hands on the people
[53:30] now he's interpreting his own vision
[53:35] right
[53:37] right before he was telling you what he
[53:40] saw now he's interpreting it right so
[53:43] he's the only one who can do it he said
[53:45] you see the first pool is when you put
[53:47] your hands on the people and tell them
[53:49] what was your truth said the second poll
[53:51] was when you know the secrets of the
[53:53] heart like I told you
[53:54] instead of you keeping that to yourself
[53:56] you tried to explain all about it and
[53:59] tell the people when you did said you
[54:01] didn't know nothing about it yourself
[54:02] and how could you explain it
[54:05] and you caused a big bunch of carnal in
[54:08] impersonations to rise up and you see
[54:11] what you've done and I said Lord I'm
[54:13] sorry and I said oh I'm sure I'm so
[54:15] sorry I don't know what to do
[54:17] now you know what I'm saying I want to
[54:19] go that's what he done he caused people
[54:21] to raise up and they said well we feel
[54:23] it we see it we smell it we it caused
[54:26] Pentecostal
[54:27] so that was the babies he was talking
[54:29] about on the other right right
[54:33] and I was pulling the line like that and
[54:34] I was trying to straighten my line out
[54:36] and he looked at me said don't get your
[54:38] line tangled up in these kind of times
[54:40] and I thought maybe he's going to give
[54:42] me another try
[54:44] and I would I said I'm sure
[54:46] I'll sure be careful and was winding up
[54:49] winding my line in and seeing it taken
[54:51] up all right and then when he said
[54:53] just then I felt myself go higher way up
[54:56] and when I was sat down there was the
[54:59] knee and there I was beneath and
[55:02] standing up above a great tent explain
[55:05] that one now I never seen such a team
[55:09] and I just made an article it seem like
[55:11] down at the order and when I was down
[55:13] there I looked and there was hundreds of
[55:14] people standing around in your order
[55:17] around the order weeping because they
[55:18] had accepted the Lord Jesus and they
[55:20] were just weeping out loud and I said oh
[55:23] that's more like it like that and a real
[55:26] kind gentleman walked up to the platform
[55:28] and said well brother Brown's resting
[55:30] for a few moments he said we'll call it
[55:32] a prayer line and I said everyone with
[55:34] Fair Claws and see it everyone with
[55:36] their clothes beginning with a certain
[55:38] number stand over on to the right well I
[55:42] noticed the prayer line it seemed like
[55:43] it went all around the tent and out and
[55:45] down the street
[55:47] shut your prayer line and left over
[55:49] which was then to my left and there it
[55:52] would be to my right if I was standing
[55:53] on the platform would be that way
[55:55] there's a piece of canvas stretched
[55:57] there and eating bit and in b b behind
[56:02] this canvas was a little square building
[56:04] about 12 foot across and 20 feet long
[56:08] something like that well I stood and
[56:11] looked at that
[56:15] there was a lady there taking her name
[56:17] and things on a paper and there was
[56:21] someone coming got her and pushed her
[56:22] through the next next man come true with
[56:25] his crutches remember it was on the
[56:27] other one but now he's more in detail I
[56:30] see them go through that little building
[56:31] on the outside
[56:33] the lady come out screaming to the top
[56:35] of her voice pushes voice pushing the
[56:37] stretcher
[56:38] and then there was another lady on the
[56:42] other side looked like kind of a dark
[56:43] haired woman and she said what happened
[56:45] she said I just don't know she said I
[56:49] couldn't tell you what happened
[56:50] she said I've been paralyzed for 20
[56:52] years and look I feel like it like I I
[56:55] never was sick just then out come the
[56:58] man leaping and jumping with his
[57:00] crutches in his hand
[57:02] and I looked at that
[57:08] just end or something notice close
[57:11] there's a difference between the angel
[57:13] of the Lord and that light because I
[57:14] heard something of moving
[57:16] as it does when it comes here at the
[57:18] platform at night kind of like a
[57:21] little bit around and makes the sound of
[57:22] who we you know like a fire whipping
[57:24] around licking Blaze and it left me and
[57:27] went right down over the top of that
[57:30] audience and went and stood over the top
[57:32] of that little building and then settle
[57:34] down on the top of it and then when it
[57:36] did this one that was standing by me
[57:38] behind me
[57:40] The Voice same voice the Angel's voice
[57:43] he said I'll meet you in there this is
[57:46] that it's the third pool
[57:48] but nobody will know nothing about it I
[57:51] said well I don't understand why in dark
[57:53] one there he said it'll not be a public
[57:55] show this time and I said I don't
[57:57] understand going to that closet like
[57:59] that he said it is not written by our
[58:00] Lord when I pray us be not not like the
[58:03] Hypocrites who like to be heard before
[58:05] men but enter into the secret closet and
[58:08] pray to the father who see it in secret
[58:10] and he who saith in Secrets shall reward
[58:12] thee openly it's perfectly because of
[58:15] scripture every time and I said I
[58:17] understand
[58:19] the equipment to this place and set me
[58:21] down in this room where I was at and he
[58:23] told me what to do for the third time
[58:24] Christian friends that when I leave this
[58:27] world that'll still be in my bosom when
[58:31] I but you mark my word what's going to
[58:34] take place when that all right
[58:38] and he gets on to that
[58:41] that's three times explain him
[58:43] explaining it and each time he goes a
[58:46] little more into detail a little more
[58:48] detail is involved
[58:50] now you say you can interpret that
[58:55] well how can you interpret what he was
[58:59] he had trouble with it right
[59:02] he didn't understand we've read that two
[59:03] or three times
[59:05] he didn't understand
[59:08] but he brought it they got a 10.
[59:10] and then we're going to do some things
[59:14] you know and all of that because he was
[59:17] a human being
[59:18] all right
[59:20] and then it's doing that then
[59:24] he tells you what he's expecting to do
[59:29] you know to try to fulfill these things
[59:31] right
[59:32] and enjoy what it will will do you know
[59:35] and what can take place
[59:37] all right
[59:38] now here are some of the things that
[59:40] people say the reason they believe
[59:42] brother Brown has got to do this because
[59:44] listen to what he said here on on the
[59:47] message bombing Gilead which would be
[59:49] number five on your notes 59 11 24 San
[59:54] Jose California
[59:55] but after the knowing this that the Lord
[59:58] has spoke some time ago about uh I
[1:00:01] suppose about three or four years ago my
[1:00:04] wife is the president I would be able to
[1:00:05] know
[1:00:06] yesterday we have it wrote down now I've
[1:00:09] seen a vision of a large tent or or
[1:00:12] something that we're anticipating
[1:00:15] someday having and where we could come
[1:00:18] into a place and stay a long time
[1:00:20] we can get the ministers and so forth
[1:00:22] together where the converts can all have
[1:00:25] the homes to go to and shift our
[1:00:28] meetings around where they'll not
[1:00:30] interfere with the regular Services of
[1:00:32] the churches
[1:00:33] maybe be off on Wednesday night and
[1:00:37] Sunday have a Sunday afternoon instead
[1:00:39] of Sunday night
[1:00:40] somewhere it won't interfere with the
[1:00:42] rest of the religious service and you're
[1:00:44] in a time that there's no Revival around
[1:00:45] close could stay
[1:00:48] and we could have teaching in the
[1:00:50] morning like ministerial classes and so
[1:00:54] forth in the afternoon to teach the sick
[1:00:56] how to hold or heal it hold their
[1:00:58] healing when they receive it and such as
[1:01:00] that
[1:01:01] I'm on my way home immediately after
[1:01:04] this meeting here for that very same
[1:01:06] purpose at my Tabernacle
[1:01:10] then in division I saw a little building
[1:01:12] sitting in the corner and this light was
[1:01:15] near me it went and stood over that
[1:01:17] building the voice said I'll meet you in
[1:01:18] there
[1:01:19] I don't know I've just wondered so after
[1:01:23] that happening last week or week before
[1:01:26] it now down at Duke Hall Indiana with
[1:01:31] that mirrors right if it was if it just
[1:01:34] couldn't happen again in the church out
[1:01:37] here while this meeting is going on I
[1:01:40] just I would just love to see it and I
[1:01:44] know it would inspire you and you know
[1:01:46] he's talking about explaining about a
[1:01:48] healing of a lady but see he was
[1:01:50] expecting to do those things
[1:01:52] he was expecting to give a 10. and put
[1:01:55] it up
[1:01:58] yeah you know and in his life he was
[1:02:02] looking for those things well I'm sure
[1:02:03] you and I would do that
[1:02:05] if we were in his place of trying to do
[1:02:08] you know and all but now take that and
[1:02:12] say well this is what
[1:02:14] now people are saying well there's
[1:02:16] there's
[1:02:17] tapes and there's things to explain on
[1:02:20] there I want to see them if there's
[1:02:22] something to explain all of these things
[1:02:23] man you know I've searched and I've
[1:02:27] tried I've got a decent memory uh I
[1:02:31] think
[1:02:31] and I tried to use the computer on every
[1:02:34] form to be able to pick up these things
[1:02:36] and and if you can find me something any
[1:02:39] different than what I read I was just
[1:02:41] reading to you the the vision that he
[1:02:43] had
[1:02:44] and then he would next time he would
[1:02:46] tell it he'd tell it a little more next
[1:02:48] time he'd tell a little more it would
[1:02:50] keep tying together
[1:02:52] and he would tell you about the first
[1:02:54] pool
[1:02:55] the fishing
[1:02:56] and he called that the first pull
[1:02:59] all right and he tells you the first
[1:03:01] pull was feeling the people is hand
[1:03:04] swelling up and the things was happening
[1:03:06] and all that what he could tell the
[1:03:08] diseases and what was taking place and
[1:03:11] then he was talking about the second
[1:03:12] pull as the fishing jerking the line and
[1:03:15] doing the things you know and the second
[1:03:17] pool was to come to know the very
[1:03:19] secrets of the heart of the people Well
[1:03:22] that took place in his ministry
[1:03:26] anybody would have to agree to that
[1:03:28] those things took place
[1:03:31] now then the point is the discussion is
[1:03:34] about what people are trying to say they
[1:03:36] won't discuss the first and second
[1:03:38] and they don't deal with that they want
[1:03:40] to go to the thing that he called the
[1:03:42] third pool all right and as he was
[1:03:46] calling it the third pool
[1:03:47] and then he said nobody will ever know
[1:03:50] this
[1:03:51] yep it would be a secret to him
[1:03:54] did you try to explain the first and
[1:03:56] second
[1:03:57] he said you can't explain this
[1:04:00] well then he was looking for those
[1:04:03] things now let's jump over
[1:04:05] and I hope I got these in the right
[1:04:07] order because I noticed I'm gonna have
[1:04:09] to tell you what page
[1:04:11] paragraph numbers to make sure you stay
[1:04:13] right but I think I I printed them
[1:04:15] different
[1:04:16] uh look at number six
[1:04:18] of your notes but look at it as
[1:04:21] paragraph 285 now you might have to flip
[1:04:23] your notes over or pick up another one
[1:04:25] look at paragraph 285 so they got these
[1:04:27] back there I want to go run all these
[1:04:29] off anybody want to do it I ran off
[1:04:31] about 20 something
[1:04:33] pages on to use 10 or 12.
[1:04:36] time to get it for you and I flipped
[1:04:37] them over okay so we'll find it and read
[1:04:40] it we want to start on paragraph 285.
[1:04:43] all right
[1:04:46] it's called the seventh seal 1963 324
[1:04:49] the evening service all right you'll see
[1:04:51] a big old line up and down with a six on
[1:04:52] the side of it everybody got it now
[1:04:55] don't go to the six on the other one
[1:04:57] that will have a six and a seven at the
[1:04:59] bottom
[1:05:02] don't go to that go to the one that's
[1:05:04] got the six in the big long line so
[1:05:06] we're going to stay together okay
[1:05:08] all right
[1:05:09] paragraph 285.
[1:05:13] and I had my hands out and all at once
[1:05:15] something hit my hand
[1:05:17] I don't know but I can't say
[1:05:19] did I go to sleep I don't know did it go
[1:05:22] into the tramps I don't know what's the
[1:05:24] division I can't tell you only thing I
[1:05:26] can say is that I just the same thing
[1:05:29] like them Angels was and it struck my
[1:05:32] hand and I looked and it was a sword
[1:05:35] and it had pearl handles real pretty and
[1:05:37] had a guard over it with gold and a
[1:05:39] blade looked like something like a
[1:05:41] chrome like silver on it was real shiny
[1:05:44] and show feather is sharp oh my God
[1:05:47] isn't that the prettiest thing just step
[1:05:49] my hand and I thought that's awful
[1:05:51] pretty but I said hey I've always pray
[1:05:54] for them things a sword and I thought
[1:05:56] what will I do with that
[1:05:59] just in a voice shook right down through
[1:06:02] the air that brought to rocks and said
[1:06:04] it's the sword of the king
[1:06:07] and when I come out of it the sword of
[1:06:09] the king and if I see it a sword of
[1:06:14] aching but it said
[1:06:16] it now if it said a sort of aching but
[1:06:20] it said the sort of thinking and there's
[1:06:22] only one D king that's God and he has
[1:06:26] one sword that's his word which I live
[1:06:29] by so help me God's standing over his I
[1:06:33] will eat this there with this holy word
[1:06:37] laying here it's the word so now he's
[1:06:40] he's got the sword in the hand now he's
[1:06:42] going to tell you what that is
[1:06:45] he goes on to the next paragraph 289
[1:06:48] which is a continuation of reading
[1:06:50] no oh what a day we're living in what a
[1:06:53] great thing see the mystery in secret
[1:06:55] the third standing there when this left
[1:06:58] me something just shook just come to me
[1:07:00] and said Don't Fear
[1:07:02] now I didn't hear the voice like on the
[1:07:04] inside of me I didn't hear no voice like
[1:07:07] on the inside of me smoke I have to just
[1:07:10] tell you the truth it's exactly what
[1:07:12] happened something he hadn't said no
[1:07:15] fear this is that third pool
[1:07:18] now on the third pool of the visions
[1:07:22] that I read to you it was the 10th
[1:07:26] we read three of them the short was the
[1:07:28] ten
[1:07:28] that's right now he says this is that
[1:07:31] third pool
[1:07:32] which was a sword in his hand
[1:07:36] the opening of the word
[1:07:37] right now that's what he's saying
[1:07:40] third pool you remember it he said you
[1:07:42] have so many impersonations on this what
[1:07:44] you've tried to explain
[1:07:46] I said don't even try this do you
[1:07:48] remember how many remembers that Nation
[1:07:51] well it's all over the tape and
[1:07:52] everywhere that's been about six years
[1:07:55] ago seven years ago
[1:07:57] been seven years ago see you go back
[1:08:00] from here to 63 you'll be 1956.
[1:08:05] seven years ago it would be 1956 21st
[1:08:08] totally okay
[1:08:11] so don't try to explain that this is
[1:08:14] that third pull but I'll meet you in
[1:08:15] there that's right he said don't cry I
[1:08:19] was standing with a little baby's shoe
[1:08:20] when he told me or make your first pull
[1:08:23] and when you do the fish will run after
[1:08:25] the lure he said then you watch your
[1:08:27] second pool said because there will only
[1:08:29] be small fish he said then the third
[1:08:32] pool will get it
[1:08:33] all them ministers got around and said
[1:08:35] Brother Brad we know you can do it
[1:08:37] hallelu your brother Brown that's where
[1:08:39] I always get tied up with a bunch of
[1:08:41] preachers see I love people and I want
[1:08:44] you to explain everything this that and
[1:08:47] I said well oh oh I said I don't know I
[1:08:50] said
[1:08:51] I've understood I understand fishing I
[1:08:55] said now the first thing you do when I'm
[1:08:58] reading this to where you put it back to
[1:08:59] the other Vision so the
[1:09:02] no keep it going through the divisional
[1:09:04] part here's the West End you see all the
[1:09:07] fish around
[1:09:08] you got the jerk Galore well that's
[1:09:10] exactly the tank is fishing so I said
[1:09:12] jerk Allure now you can see when I jerk
[1:09:14] The lure that first time now the fish
[1:09:16] takes out after it but they were little
[1:09:19] ones that's just like they were catching
[1:09:21] so then I said then you'll you'll see it
[1:09:24] I'm gonna Jerk it Out of the bank and I
[1:09:26] had to fix but it looked like a skin
[1:09:27] Over The Lure it was it just it was so
[1:09:30] little and then I was standing there and
[1:09:32] something said I told you not to do that
[1:09:35] and I started crying
[1:09:37] all the line
[1:09:39] was Tangled around me like this and had
[1:09:43] was standing there crying with my head
[1:09:45] down like that and I said God all for
[1:09:47] you uh forgive me I'm a stupid person
[1:09:50] Lord don't
[1:09:51] forgive me
[1:09:53] and I had this line and that what I got
[1:09:56] in my hand was a little baby shoe about
[1:09:58] that long and I had that string was
[1:10:00] about as bigger around as my finger
[1:10:03] about a half inch like that
[1:10:05] and the eyelet in the shoe was just
[1:10:07] about the size of a looter than 1 16
[1:10:09] probably
[1:10:11] of an inch of the Olive and I was trying
[1:10:13] to lace this little shoe up with this
[1:10:15] great big inch cord and a voice come and
[1:10:19] said you can't teach Pentecostal babies
[1:10:22] Supernatural things said let them alone
[1:10:25] now that may be missing off of your
[1:10:33] you can't teach Pentecostal baby
[1:10:35] Supernatural thing
[1:10:38] and just then he picked up and took me
[1:10:40] up and set me way up high to where a
[1:10:42] meeting was going on look like a 10 or a
[1:10:45] cathedralist or some sort you know and
[1:10:48] there was a little box
[1:10:49] black little place over on the in the
[1:10:52] side and I've seen that light was
[1:10:54] talking to somebody above me and that
[1:10:56] light that you see there on the picture
[1:10:57] your world away from me like that and
[1:10:59] went over to that tent I'll meet you in
[1:11:02] there said this will be the dirt Bull
[1:11:04] and you won't tell it to nobody and in
[1:11:06] Sabina Canyon he said this is the third
[1:11:08] pool and there's three three things that
[1:11:11] goes with it one unfolded today or
[1:11:13] yesterday the other one unfolded today
[1:11:15] and there's one thing that I cannot
[1:11:17] interpret because it's in an unknown
[1:11:19] language but I was standing right there
[1:11:21] and looked right straight at it this is
[1:11:24] the dirt bull coming up in the holy
[1:11:26] spirit of God oh my that's the reason
[1:11:28] all heaven was solid
[1:11:31] now I better stop here and I just feel
[1:11:33] checked not to say no more about it just
[1:11:35] remember the seventh seal the reason it
[1:11:38] was not open see the reason it did not
[1:11:40] reveal it no one should know about it
[1:11:42] and I want you to know before I ever
[1:11:44] note any word about that that Vision
[1:11:48] come years ago you remember that and
[1:11:51] here it is just as the other has slides
[1:11:53] right straight into the word exactly
[1:11:55] where it was God knows my heart I never
[1:11:57] one time thought of such a thing as that
[1:11:59] and here it was it's later than we think
[1:12:02] oh my just shows it's from God for it
[1:12:06] just exactly in the promises of God from
[1:12:08] the end of the message
[1:12:10] you notice notice now for the end time
[1:12:13] message this seal after all
[1:12:17] he's revealed all the six seals but it
[1:12:20] don't say nothing about the seven and
[1:12:22] the end time seal when it starts will be
[1:12:24] absolutely a total secret according to
[1:12:27] the Bible before knowing that and
[1:12:29] remember Revelations 10
[1:12:31] seven one to seven chapter ten one to
[1:12:34] seven at the end of the seventh Angels
[1:12:35] message all the mysteries of God should
[1:12:37] be fulfilled we're at the end the
[1:12:39] opening of the seventh seal
[1:12:43] now there is one of the things that
[1:12:45] people say
[1:12:49] that's a tent they'll agree and bring up
[1:12:51] to the ten up to the seventh seal but
[1:12:53] they'll say the seventh still is not
[1:12:55] open
[1:12:56] brother Reynolds now to come back and
[1:12:58] tell us what the seventh seal is
[1:13:00] wow
[1:13:01] that's one of the things I'm trying to
[1:13:03] give you I gave you the vision on things
[1:13:05] and now trying to give you the things
[1:13:08] that people are expecting
[1:13:10] and the things you know or what it was
[1:13:12] so let's just read a few things
[1:13:17] this day the scripture is fulfilled
[1:13:19] number seven on your note
[1:13:22] paragraph 14.
[1:13:25] and we're trusting that God will give us
[1:13:26] a blessing out of this word as we read
[1:13:28] it
[1:13:30] and you've had Billy told me to tell you
[1:13:32] that you sure had fine corporations and
[1:13:34] people here that's been in the parking
[1:13:35] system the police and everything keep it
[1:13:37] up that's very very good we hope to see
[1:13:40] the time maybe in the near future
[1:13:42] no this is 1965.
[1:13:46] and brother Brown was still looking for
[1:13:48] something
[1:13:50] all right we hope to see the time maybe
[1:13:53] in the near future when maybe we could
[1:13:55] bring the tent here to the city and put
[1:13:57] it out here in the ballpark or we could
[1:13:59] stay for some length of time maybe for
[1:14:01] three or four weeks Revival constantly
[1:14:03] and here we just barely get to know each
[1:14:05] other and then we have to say goodbye
[1:14:07] and we go again but I'd like to come and
[1:14:10] stay an extensive trip one time where
[1:14:13] you could study so we don't have to
[1:14:15] close out in a night or two
[1:14:17] and just stay and teach day and night
[1:14:19] day and night on and on maybe somebody
[1:14:22] go home feed the chickens melt the cows
[1:14:25] and come back next week and continue on
[1:14:27] with the service I like that so the Lord
[1:14:30] be with you
[1:14:33] reading that he was looking for
[1:14:35] something
[1:14:37] 1865
[1:14:43] he had told division
[1:14:45] and he comes into the seals and he said
[1:14:47] this is that third pool right the third
[1:14:49] pool's the opening of the word
[1:14:51] so irregardless of what's going to take
[1:14:53] place anywhere he comes back or whatever
[1:14:55] it is got to be the opening of the word
[1:14:56] right
[1:14:58] that's all I've been blown about say
[1:14:59] it's got to be the opening of the word
[1:15:02] all right
[1:15:03] now
[1:15:04] watch what he said here on the message
[1:15:09] this day the scripture is fulfilled
[1:15:13] all right
[1:15:14] and remember we was reading from this
[1:15:16] daily scriptures fulfilled
[1:15:18] he was wanting to bring attended right
[1:15:20] up in the time
[1:15:23] look what he says
[1:15:26] he talks about the same song that rides
[1:15:28] in the East and say it's not exists in
[1:15:29] the west side Son of God to come into
[1:15:31] East and meditate himself as God
[1:15:33] manifests in the flesh is the same Son
[1:15:34] of God in the Western Hemisphere here
[1:15:37] that's identifying himself among the
[1:15:39] church tonight the same yesterday and
[1:15:40] forever the evening light of the sun has
[1:15:43] come this day this scripture is
[1:15:45] fulfilled before us paragraph 172.
[1:15:49] were we at in this abrahamic age
[1:15:53] where are we in this great time we're
[1:15:55] standing the great hour that we're
[1:15:58] living in
[1:15:59] all the Visions that's been fulfilled
[1:16:04] did work so all right
[1:16:07] no more self-interpretation of that it's
[1:16:09] just flatter what he said he said all of
[1:16:11] these have been fulfilled
[1:16:16] now you've got these to read when you
[1:16:18] get home
[1:16:19] so I'm going to give you a few things
[1:16:20] without having to read so much just for
[1:16:23] a few minutes real quick
[1:16:25] unspoken word is Original Seed a lot of
[1:16:27] people take this message
[1:16:29] to try to prove right around them has
[1:16:31] got to come back
[1:16:32] and to do the things because of the some
[1:16:36] of the things that he said on the spoken
[1:16:37] words region proceed and on that message
[1:16:40] it's the same as it is in the church age
[1:16:43] book
[1:16:44] and you know
[1:16:46] and he's explaining something
[1:16:48] and he's explaining a twofold part of
[1:16:51] his ministry
[1:16:55] and I believe in a twofold part of his
[1:16:57] ministry I believe he had a Ministry to
[1:17:00] return the faith of the Father's Day and
[1:17:03] then he had the opening of The Seven
[1:17:04] Seals to bring that forward I believe
[1:17:06] that's electrical part so they take this
[1:17:09] part here and though and say that the
[1:17:12] Forerunner are that Moses had to go into
[1:17:16] the wilderness
[1:17:19] and stay because of the people wouldn't
[1:17:21] accept him right and then he came out
[1:17:24] and delivered it is wrong and they say
[1:17:26] that brother Branham had to go off the
[1:17:28] scene stay off the scene
[1:17:30] and then would come back and Deliver us
[1:17:32] and take us through now
[1:17:36] if that's true I praise God and hope it
[1:17:38] isn't they don't know but the only thing
[1:17:40] I've ever said is I'm not just not
[1:17:42] sitting down
[1:17:43] you know being careful you're you'll
[1:17:46] make it like catching a bush
[1:17:48] you know you're just going to catch a
[1:17:50] bus and go out of here
[1:17:52] I don't think so right because now even
[1:17:55] with brother Brown if you read it when
[1:17:56] you go home read it
[1:17:58] then you talk about Moses it wasn't on
[1:18:01] the part for Moses it was on the part
[1:18:03] for the people right
[1:18:05] and the people had to be crying out
[1:18:09] for God to send a deliverer now let's
[1:18:11] send the message spoken word to read and
[1:18:13] see before the deliverer could come
[1:18:16] I say to you and I whatever you're
[1:18:19] looking forward to
[1:18:21] are there anybody listening what you're
[1:18:23] looking forward to
[1:18:25] whether it be brother Branham coming
[1:18:26] back and putting up a tent or whatever
[1:18:28] it be whatever
[1:18:32] if we're not crying out for a deliverer
[1:18:34] all right nothing's not going to take
[1:18:36] place it's in your hands and mine right
[1:18:41] the crying out was for the people which
[1:18:43] had to be crying out for a deliverer and
[1:18:45] God sent Moses right
[1:18:48] brother Brown came within one part of
[1:18:50] his ministry to return to Faith of the
[1:18:52] fathers yes
[1:18:53] then he had the part of bringing his
[1:18:55] message to carry you and I out of here
[1:18:57] that's right
[1:19:00] you see that was that's what he's
[1:19:02] explaining spoken words Original Seed go
[1:19:04] read the whole thing I gave it to you go
[1:19:06] read the whole thing
[1:19:08] he said now this is the time this has
[1:19:10] got to be this way this is that away all
[1:19:12] right The Waiting was not for Moses but
[1:19:15] for the people to get ready to receive
[1:19:16] Moses Moses thought the children would
[1:19:19] understand that he was sent
[1:19:21] I never wrote it he did so it is now
[1:19:24] like Elijah after that Mighty Vindicated
[1:19:26] Prophet for the word of God came to
[1:19:28] after he finished his preaching had to
[1:19:31] be taken off the scene
[1:19:32] see they say well that's what the thing
[1:19:34] it is right around had to be taken off
[1:19:36] the scene and he's going to come back
[1:19:38] and he's going to bring a tent and go
[1:19:41] across the country and and you know
[1:19:43] preach to the people and bring us to
[1:19:46] rapturing Faith all right
[1:19:49] now
[1:19:51] I gave you these in here don't have time
[1:19:53] at 1509 we got to hurry to hurry a lot
[1:19:56] of it is based upon as I said that
[1:19:59] people believe
[1:20:01] silly
[1:20:03] because even brother random will go
[1:20:05] backwards and forth as to say yeah and
[1:20:08] they are arguing right now among the
[1:20:09] people of the message that the seventh
[1:20:11] seal is not broke now the Bible said it
[1:20:14] was
[1:20:15] Revelation day one when it opened the
[1:20:19] seventh seal right yeah that's the
[1:20:21] bottom all right what did run around
[1:20:23] saying when he's saying the seven still
[1:20:25] not open right he's saying just what he
[1:20:28] said back there when he tried to explain
[1:20:29] it the angel of the Lord in the tent
[1:20:32] Visa said don't try to explain this
[1:20:37] he said this will never be made known
[1:20:39] and I gave you quote after quoting
[1:20:41] around said this will never be made
[1:20:43] known to the public
[1:20:44] you cannot give this message to the
[1:20:47] public any of this message won't go to
[1:20:49] the public
[1:20:50] they won't receive it all right and how
[1:20:53] could they understand about seven seal
[1:20:55] that's why like I said they click on the
[1:20:57] internet and they read about all these
[1:20:58] fanaticisms and they make us a Jim Jones
[1:21:02] you know what I'm talking about I'm out
[1:21:04] there might not have ever heard about it
[1:21:05] but Jim Jones years ago let the people
[1:21:07] down over Guyana and Kurt them down
[1:21:09] there and and killed a bunch of them
[1:21:11] they killed ourselves and all because
[1:21:13] you know
[1:21:15] and it's all kind of things going around
[1:21:17] the world today everywhere and
[1:21:19] everybody's looking for some kind of a
[1:21:20] deal
[1:21:22] brother random will tell you the seventh
[1:21:24] seal this is coming right right man
[1:21:26] that's the reason it can't be made known
[1:21:27] to the public
[1:21:29] it's the coming of the Lord now then I
[1:21:32] want your status a little bit and then
[1:21:33] you can think what you want to I've
[1:21:35] always said this one time and you show
[1:21:37] me anything that I've ever seen anything
[1:21:38] contrary
[1:21:40] I believe in a returning Ministry right
[1:21:43] amen
[1:21:44] I believe in the Kid Vision
[1:21:47] I believe what the prophet brought
[1:21:49] I believe he brought his message
[1:21:54] and I believe he will probably be the
[1:21:56] first in the resurrection because that
[1:21:58] would be scriptural because the first
[1:22:00] shall be last unless you'll be perfect
[1:22:02] that would be fine that's the reason I
[1:22:04] say that we're having to deal with it
[1:22:06] now maybe there might be enough Faith
[1:22:07] among the people at this time to be able
[1:22:10] to draw some of the people out of the
[1:22:11] ground but we don't have enough Faith to
[1:22:13] bring the prophet out of the ground that
[1:22:14] we're done I believe the dependence is
[1:22:16] upon you and I if he's coming back to
[1:22:19] preach to us the dependence is upon you
[1:22:21] and I to be crying out because that's
[1:22:23] why read spoken words Original Seed and
[1:22:25] you'll see it that's what was happening
[1:22:28] the people had to be crying for
[1:22:30] deliverance are you crying for
[1:22:33] deliverance are you just sitting down
[1:22:34] well I don't know what to expect I'll be
[1:22:37] pushing along a little and I'm just I
[1:22:40] don't know I don't want to get caught up
[1:22:42] in them beat things and get confused you
[1:22:45] already confused honey
[1:22:47] you was born confused
[1:22:50] do we need to get unconfused
[1:22:53] well who knows about them you know the
[1:22:57] prophet of God
[1:22:59] one of the things of the seven Thunders
[1:23:02] they say he's got to come back and tell
[1:23:03] us what the Thunders are we've just been
[1:23:06] through that with the message we covered
[1:23:07] where it run around covers that the
[1:23:10] seven Thunders and the revelations 3 27
[1:23:12] Church any book Revel the hunters and
[1:23:15] Revelation detained in the Seven Seals
[1:23:17] he said that's what it was about in the
[1:23:19] seals for the Thunder the Thunder we
[1:23:21] just went through it we brought around
[1:23:22] covered that the Thunder is the voice of
[1:23:24] God these are on the internet where they
[1:23:26] can read it if they'll pull it up you
[1:23:27] have them to read
[1:23:31] he said the seven Thunders would bring
[1:23:33] us rapturing faith
[1:23:34] and rapturing Grace
[1:23:37] so we've never we don't know what you
[1:23:39] are with the prophet God said it's the
[1:23:40] voice of God when the seal from it right
[1:23:42] right
[1:23:46] let's see I believe right around we'll
[1:23:48] be back in the resurrection and we're
[1:23:50] going to have 30 40 days
[1:23:52] according to Dubai and what I understand
[1:23:54] the prophet and understand the Bible
[1:23:57] I'm comparing it back when Jesus was
[1:23:59] here right
[1:24:01] they were the dad's going to raise and
[1:24:03] then we went to the line remains will be
[1:24:05] changed a moment with 30 40 days the day
[1:24:08] is going to be among us
[1:24:10] now you think as I always tell you you
[1:24:12] think we're going to come to church and
[1:24:14] we'll walk out safe
[1:24:17] post
[1:24:19] this building's full tonight
[1:24:22] yeah
[1:24:23] you look around
[1:24:26] get your straight jacket cause any boys
[1:24:29] going crazy
[1:24:30] I said no that sets those Saints
[1:24:34] they've raised
[1:24:36] you think we're going to just walk
[1:24:38] around oh Gloria Hallelujah the
[1:24:40] resurrections come
[1:24:42] on I think it's going to be a shouting
[1:24:43] Gloria Hallelujah wonderful time with
[1:24:46] you and we'll have 30 40 days it run
[1:24:49] around we can preach to us that's right
[1:24:51] all right
[1:24:55] but why can't we get settled in what
[1:24:57] he's already preached that's right right
[1:25:00] he's already told us the tent and what
[1:25:03] it was
[1:25:05] that it would be the third pull the
[1:25:07] opening of the word now that's his words
[1:25:09] not mine
[1:25:13] but see people wanted something they can
[1:25:15] depend upon some kind of something that
[1:25:18] they can look at and put their hands on
[1:25:19] why can't we put our hands upon the word
[1:25:21] of God
[1:25:24] 40 something years we've been studying
[1:25:26] this message and don't know what the
[1:25:28] prophet is saying right
[1:25:33] what's wrong with it right
[1:25:35] oh we've been in Walmart
[1:25:38] excuse me
[1:25:39] you should go to church with a brother
[1:25:41] he said I'm staying at Walmart and got a
[1:25:43] message
[1:25:47] you did I'm not arguing with it even on
[1:25:50] my business
[1:25:52] but I
[1:25:54] I've got a few in places myself
[1:25:56] but I'd rather be sitting in my study
[1:25:58] studying the message
[1:26:00] you know been walking around in Walmart
[1:26:02] and then I go all our freaks when I come
[1:26:05] out with women's dressed in the hour oh
[1:26:07] that's what the brother doing I'm sorry
[1:26:09] but I'm just trying to tell you honestly
[1:26:12] what I've always said
[1:26:15] you can't interpret a vision of a
[1:26:17] prophet you let him interpret that right
[1:26:22] but when that Prophet said
[1:26:26] that that first pool
[1:26:29] was to take in the People by hand
[1:26:31] was a fulfillment of the fishing
[1:26:37] and we read it you're hungry
[1:26:40] second pause to know the secrets of the
[1:26:42] heart
[1:26:44] and that was the Fulfillment of the
[1:26:45] fundament of the fishing and jerking The
[1:26:48] Lure out of the water
[1:26:51] and he says the third pull was restored
[1:26:53] in his hand
[1:26:54] which is the word of God Amen right
[1:26:59] and there's no way to explain the word
[1:27:01] of God to people
[1:27:03] no wonder the third pull is a total
[1:27:05] Secret
[1:27:08] and even in compassion as I said a
[1:27:10] moment ago Jesus went and preached the
[1:27:12] souls that were in prison under his
[1:27:15] third poor ministry right
[1:27:17] brother random isn't it odd that he
[1:27:20] turns around and he said there I was
[1:27:24] in JC Penney's
[1:27:26] seeing people coming up those escalators
[1:27:30] that looked exactly like when he had
[1:27:33] went to hell and saw those people
[1:27:41] there's a doctrine that we're in hell
[1:27:42] now
[1:27:45] I don't think so
[1:27:49] no pretty nice place
[1:27:51] I don't want to stay here a long time
[1:27:53] but
[1:27:54] like somebody said we're already in the
[1:27:56] Millennium I don't think so about that
[1:27:58] because there's too many Devils involved
[1:28:01] around right yeah
[1:28:03] all kind of doctrines among the people
[1:28:05] the message
[1:28:08] thank you
[1:28:09] but what do you think about it
[1:28:15] I want to just keep going in the word
[1:28:18] and whatever God does let him do it
[1:28:21] but if I'm in the word I'll be prepared
[1:28:23] what but if I under shiftly lays no long
[1:28:27] like bombs and not doing nothing right
[1:28:30] I wouldn't have wanted wrote the book
[1:28:34] right
[1:28:35] I didn't write the thoughtful Ministry
[1:28:37] whispering to perfecting of the science
[1:28:39] right and I wasn't the prophet that said
[1:28:42] they worked to do that to take these
[1:28:44] things and sweep them on
[1:28:46] the wordish people depend upon the
[1:28:48] ministry
[1:28:51] okay they depend upon if you agree with
[1:28:53] him yeah right everybody likes you if
[1:28:57] you agree with them
[1:29:01] we just differ a little bit you find out
[1:29:02] people don't like it too well amen
[1:29:05] amen they stayed with Jesus for the fish
[1:29:08] and the loaves but when he began to Tire
[1:29:10] their doctrines up
[1:29:13] they left that's right
[1:29:17] that's where I've always been the same
[1:29:20] 40 something years I've always said run
[1:29:22] around if you come back and preach too
[1:29:24] much right now I'm not sitting down
[1:29:26] waiting
[1:29:28] on something to happen I'm trying my
[1:29:30] best to get in it and cry for
[1:29:32] deliverance what are you doing
[1:29:35] you know that years ago they started out
[1:29:37] in West
[1:29:38] with a tent
[1:29:39] and come to Indiana with it
[1:29:43] and said they believed when they got the
[1:29:45] early brother random was going to meet
[1:29:46] them
[1:29:53] but you see all these doctrines and
[1:29:55] ideas is all tied to trying to confuse
[1:29:57] the people instead of straightening out
[1:29:59] anything
[1:30:02] yep
[1:30:04] let your Prophet interpret
[1:30:07] the visions and when he says this is
[1:30:10] what it is that's what it is right
[1:30:13] but you know what I believe he was so
[1:30:15] much a mortal human being
[1:30:18] that he was still looking for something
[1:30:19] to happen
[1:30:22] and I'm going to say this and quit
[1:30:25] if you and I ever get to the place that
[1:30:27] we're not looking for something for God
[1:30:28] to do something and move on we've done
[1:30:31] cabbage down
[1:30:33] and we're in bad shape that's
[1:30:37] why I encourage you to read the message
[1:30:40] hearing the message study the message
[1:30:43] amen what do you want you got plenty of
[1:30:46] time to read career dominate
[1:30:48] or McDonald's either if it's in Jamaica
[1:30:52] you got plenty of time to read it
[1:30:58] but this message Cody a lot of things go
[1:31:00] wrong
[1:31:01] you got time enough to be able to read
[1:31:03] everything else but don't study the
[1:31:05] message
[1:31:06] I'd hate your ass right now or how many
[1:31:10] have read a book or listened to a tape
[1:31:12] this week
[1:31:15] but we're ready for the rapture
[1:31:19] right right
[1:31:22] just remember
[1:31:24] your profit spoken words Original Seed
[1:31:27] read it
[1:31:28] he said the people had to be crying out
[1:31:31] before God sent Moses back that's right
[1:31:35] so if you believe in a tent literally
[1:31:37] I've run around coming back and
[1:31:38] preaching
[1:31:41] then we need to be crying for
[1:31:43] deliverance
[1:31:47] okay
[1:31:48] but now let's get the reasons on
[1:31:51] everybody's happy
[1:31:53] we're doing good well you know the
[1:31:55] feathers are fixing to be pulled out
[1:31:57] from under us
[1:31:59] and I never have been one to kind of
[1:32:02] Glory in in you know bad things but I am
[1:32:06] one that believes one night
[1:32:08] if God needs to take the feathers out of
[1:32:11] the nest for us to get home to the
[1:32:13] Thorns remember the Eagles
[1:32:16] they let him pull the nest
[1:32:20] if we need to be hungry to get desperate
[1:32:23] that's right let it come right amen amen
[1:32:28] all right never worried about it
[1:32:31] because I can go back in there and see
[1:32:33] in the Bible that God always provided he
[1:32:37] said I've never seen a righteous
[1:32:39] forsaken never received bacon bread
[1:32:42] that's right it's already been proved a
[1:32:46] lady over in Africa years ago they could
[1:32:48] go in there and dip out that meal and go
[1:32:50] cook all they wanted to they go back and
[1:32:52] come right back
[1:32:55] documented is being true
[1:32:58] but are we crying for deliverance
[1:33:10] what do you see
[1:33:12] and I'll make a statement and I know
[1:33:14] that I'm not popular and doing it you
[1:33:16] see a lot of people that don't depend
[1:33:17] upon the powerful Ministry and they got
[1:33:20] what they call tight churches around the
[1:33:21] country they don't have no pastures and
[1:33:24] they have a tape recorders they're
[1:33:26] pastor
[1:33:27] they only listen to brother Brown
[1:33:29] because they don't want to get confused
[1:33:31] I'll challenge any of them amen you tell
[1:33:35] me you name them I'll show you the most
[1:33:37] confused people there is
[1:33:39] all right
[1:33:41] I'm talking about Dwayne language that's
[1:33:43] why you know
[1:33:44] when I told my brother one day I said
[1:33:46] you show me a tight group of people and
[1:33:48] I'll show you backslidden people he said
[1:33:51] my brother goes to a church and I said
[1:33:53] in their backslid now tell me they're
[1:33:55] not
[1:33:57] he said well now
[1:34:02] because there's no live minister in
[1:34:05] front of us
[1:34:06] they fast forward them tapes
[1:34:10] yeah
[1:34:12] right
[1:34:13] church we need to be crying out for
[1:34:16] deliverance that's right
[1:34:18] seeking God every day for fathermen of
[1:34:21] the word to be open unto us crying out
[1:34:23] for a Deliverance
[1:34:26] because the hours late
[1:34:29] what are we going to do come on brother
[1:34:31] let's stand
[1:34:33] take on these things
[1:34:36] see that I've always been the same
[1:34:38] I'm looking forward
[1:34:41] things to take place
[1:34:43] but I'm not failing to look at what's
[1:34:46] already taking place if I see God Among
[1:34:50] Us I don't mind telling you that God is
[1:34:52] Among Us
[1:34:54] we don't see I don't see it like I want
[1:34:57] to either
[1:35:02] it was it was it Martin wasn't satisfied
[1:35:05] until everybody in his church had the
[1:35:06] leading of the spirit and he said every
[1:35:08] service that was
[1:35:10] major Miracles took place
[1:35:14] mom because everybody there was in one
[1:35:17] mind in one corner
[1:35:21] that's when I'm crying out for a church
[1:35:25] is for you and I to come to a position
[1:35:28] to where we're all crying before I
[1:35:30] delivered
[1:35:34] you know a lot of us are getting old
[1:35:35] enough we ain't going to be around here
[1:35:37] too much longer
[1:35:41] yeah and a lot of you young that might
[1:35:44] not be around here as long as that's old
[1:35:46] ones are all right
