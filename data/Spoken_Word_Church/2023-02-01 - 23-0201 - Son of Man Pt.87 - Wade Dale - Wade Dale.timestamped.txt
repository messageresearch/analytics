[6:18] step at a time
[6:19] we love miracle healing but you know
[6:21] what I love the healing that goes and
[6:23] takes a little bit of time and you can
[6:25] see the working of the Lord in a man's
[6:27] body or a woman's body as we gradually
[6:30] go up
[6:32] to toward our healing and I believe
[6:34] he'll be
[6:35] from what we saw three weeks ago
[6:38] it's a miracle
[6:40] a miracle amen
[6:43] I mean they were looking at taking

[10:07] that day forgive us of our sins and
[10:09] bless us Lord in Jesus name
[10:11] amen
[10:13] part 87 in the beginning was the word
[10:15] the word was with God and the Word was
[10:17] God and that word was made flesh and
[10:21] dwell Among Us I'm gonna read you a
[10:23] quote not today but where brother Robin
[10:24] said the flesh is becoming word words
[10:26] becoming flesh so it's all got to unite
[10:28] back together it's a uniting time we've
[10:31] been separated we're going to read here
[10:32] in a few minutes how Adam and Eve got
[10:34] separated from God all right because
[10:36] they ate off of the tree of knowledge of
[10:38] Good and Evil God separated from it but
[10:40] he made a way for him to get back
[10:41] praise the Lord he made a way for him to
[10:43] get back I will I will I will be the one
[10:46] that'll do it
[10:47] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[10:49] among us and we beheld his glory the
[10:50] glory the only begotten of the father
[10:52] full of grace
[10:54] and truth you may be seeing when the
[10:56] Lord has blessing to the reading of the
[10:58] word John 8 verse 31
[11:01] then Jesus said to those disciples which
[11:03] believed on him if you continue in my
[11:06] word then are you my disciples
[11:08] indeed and you shall know the truth not
[11:12] know of the truth not suppose you might
[11:15] know the truth you shall know the truth
[11:17] and the truth shall make you free amen
[11:20] so if you'll bring the chart up we'll
[11:22] look at it just for a few minutes and I
[11:24] I appreciate the Lord giving us Grace to
[11:27] have these things that we can put up so
[11:29] that you can visually see what's going
[11:30] on and you can see
[11:33] here it is
[11:36] oh if you bring if you oh yeah thank you
[11:38] if your gas for the banquet will be at
[11:41] church on Sunday in other words we're
[11:42] like Joel and Pam's going to be coming
[11:44] with us be sure to bring enough lunch
[11:46] for yourself and your guest you sure
[11:49] don't want them sitting there not eating
[11:50] anything while we're all eating okay
[11:51] that'd be hard for a guest to do
[11:54] to Fellowship after that one service
[11:56] thank you
[11:57] sister Gene
[12:01] she's got it all up here
[12:04] amen
[12:05] so now we saw the other day where that
[12:08] middle round the soul of man is the
[12:12] center Realm
[12:13] where the actually where the sinner
[12:16] lives if you're not born again all right
[12:18] and then we looked and and it was it was
[12:21] just a real
[12:22] eye-opener to me to see that the
[12:25] affection this affection Right Here
[12:27] cannot be the affection that is in here
[12:30] this is agape love this is filial love
[12:33] this is conditional love one day you'll
[12:36] love me one day you won't love me one
[12:37] day you'll like me one day you won't
[12:39] like me up and down up and down up and
[12:41] down reasoning up and down up and down
[12:43] memory bad and good right conscious bad
[12:47] ain't good
[12:48] imagination oh boy
[12:51] but that is either Faith or doubt either
[12:54] your soul is Born Again by the baptism
[12:56] of the Holy Ghost or it is a doubter of
[13:00] the word of God it was born in doubt
[13:03] we're going to see in just a few minutes
[13:04] it was born in sin that's what separated
[13:07] when Adam knew his wife Eve that broke
[13:09] it all
[13:11] now we know it did with the serpent but
[13:12] when Adam did it that broke it off to
[13:14] where nobody could get back no one it
[13:18] was they were totally barred away from
[13:19] God
[13:20] now bye with me
[13:22] but he said I will restore now what's he
[13:24] going to restore he's going to restore
[13:26] this life right here first
[13:29] then he's going to restore these
[13:32] and I like where it says the gifts of
[13:34] the Spirit which is what love joy peace
[13:35] long suffering all the different things
[13:37] but remember it's not agape love there's
[13:40] a one of those questions it talks about
[13:42] the Holy Spirit right here the pyramid
[13:44] top of the pyramid and we'll get to that
[13:45] that's where it Seals Everything in if
[13:48] there's any cracks that's where it's
[13:49] going to seal of them if there's
[13:50] anything that's going to be shaken it
[13:52] can't be shaken once that Holy Ghost
[13:54] Seals Everything into that pyramid or
[13:56] you when I say pyramid I'm talking about
[13:58] you everybody with me it's not a
[14:00] building not a pyramid over there it's
[14:02] you all right when it's sealed into you
[14:04] you say we already got the Holy Ghost I
[14:06] got it down here yeah but you get a
[14:07] refilling you get to where God says I
[14:10] can use this guy now because I've got
[14:12] everything sealed into him and look
[14:14] can't get out
[14:15] praise God
[14:17] see that's why we say we have so many
[14:19] ups and downs and ups and downs God
[14:21] don't have ups and downs
[14:24] only me and you have ups and downs God
[14:27] don't have a bad day and a good day if
[14:29] we'd let our soul out every once in a
[14:31] while and let it live let it do the
[14:33] speaking let it do the teaching
[14:36] remember what he said he was going to do
[14:37] send us a holy ghost to do what lead us
[14:40] and guide us into all truth the leader
[14:42] is right here
[14:44] that's where the Holy Ghost is this is
[14:46] not Holy Ghost
[14:48] this is your spirit
[14:50] now the holy spirit's working on your
[14:52] spirit working its way out to get into
[14:55] this realm but so is Satan working to
[14:57] get in from the outside
[15:00] to affect
[15:02] your imagination to affect your
[15:04] reasoning to affect your Consciousness
[15:05] he's trying to affect and infect
[15:09] you and me but he can't get in that Soul
[15:12] once it's sealed in listen that's the
[15:14] throne room that's where God will meet
[15:16] you at because the devil can meet you in
[15:18] all those other in that Spirit realm the
[15:20] devil can meet you there but if you're
[15:22] born again of the spirit of God he
[15:23] cannot meet you in that holy of holies
[15:26] it will burn him so bad because that's
[15:28] what's going to burn him up at the end
[15:30] time what's going to burn him so bad is
[15:32] that Holy Ghost Fire is what's going to
[15:34] burn him up because remember he's
[15:35] getting put in the Lake of Fire he's not
[15:37] putting it like a fire that's burning
[15:38] fire
[15:40] it burned him up and consume him he'd be
[15:42] dead he'd be gone no it's a lake of fire
[15:45] that burns a holy fire that's going to
[15:46] burn him until whatever time it is that
[15:49] God says okay that's enough and he'll
[15:51] just evaporate into nothing boy we don't
[15:54] want that
[15:55] we don't want to evaporate into nothing
[15:57] I I don't want that I don't want you to
[15:59] be that way I want us to all make it I
[16:01] want us to all if we're going to
[16:03] evaporate I want to evaporate in the
[16:05] Holy Ghost
[16:06] amen that's I'm gonna evaporate give me
[16:08] the Holy Ghost and I'll evaporate away
[16:10] from here and you'll see the real me not
[16:12] me that's talking to you today all right
[16:14] so the spirit Realm
[16:16] thank God he sent us a prophet but he
[16:18] sent us the word we say he sent us a
[16:20] prophet but really he sent us the word
[16:22] through a prophet
[16:23] everybody with me he sent us the correct
[16:25] interpretation of the word through a
[16:27] prophet to give it to me and you in what
[16:30] truth you shall know the truth
[16:33] and the truth will set you free like I
[16:35] said before no one you don't see anybody
[16:38] I'm not talking about well even messaged
[16:40] people almost now talking about Statue
[16:42] of perfect man but out in the world
[16:44] they're just it's they're just all
[16:45] gummed up well it's okay if I do this
[16:47] it's okay if I do that you know I can
[16:49] drink and I can smoke and I well you
[16:51] ain't perfect neither am I so forget you
[16:52] leave me alone this this right here this
[16:54] no that didn't make you do anything
[16:57] it's the motivator inside is what made
[16:59] you do that
[17:00] all right everybody with me so these
[17:03] virtues though must emanate or come from
[17:06] here they don't come from the outside
[17:08] they're already inside of you that's why
[17:11] a lot of people feel that you just get
[17:13] the virtues when you get born again and
[17:16] you don't need all this teaching of
[17:18] Faith virtue and all those tempered
[17:19] faces Godless brother kindness there is
[17:20] a group of people that doesn't believe
[17:21] they believe you got it all brother Dale
[17:24] remember there's one group that believe
[17:26] you got it all when you believe that's
[17:27] another group believes you got to get
[17:29] the virtues before you get to right here
[17:30] they turn the pyramid upside down uh
[17:33] been in the room with both of them
[17:36] and and the wisdom of dad was like I
[17:40] ain't fighting with you and I ain't
[17:40] fighting with you but can we pull them
[17:42] together
[17:44] can we pull them together and say yeah
[17:45] you got everything when you believe
[17:47] because that's a quote but you got to
[17:49] let that work
[17:51] out to where
[17:53] these virtues can work
[17:56] in this realm right here
[17:58] not in this realm in this realm but it's
[18:00] kind of imminent you got to let it out
[18:02] and what's going to let it out knowledge
[18:03] teaching is going to let that out
[18:06] because we're going to see something in
[18:08] just a minute
[18:10] that's really shocking that was that
[18:12] happened when Adam and Eve did what they
[18:15] did in the garden
[18:16] because remember
[18:18] before Adam fell Adam and Eve fell
[18:21] everything was perfect
[18:25] Adam could walk right up to God look at
[18:27] him face to face and say Hey Dad how you
[18:29] doing God said hey I'm doing good come
[18:31] on let me let me take you over here
[18:33] remember brother Ryan visualized it says
[18:35] Adam and Eve right at the end of the day
[18:37] God just lays them down puts them to
[18:40] sleep he said you sleep there I'll come
[18:41] back and get you in the morning
[18:42] everything was perfect harmony was great
[18:45] there was no fear inside of Adam there
[18:47] was nothing that that gets what he
[18:49] called butterflies there was no
[18:51] butterflies when God walked up now you
[18:53] don't if God walked through that door
[18:54] right there
[18:56] we'd have butterfly
[18:58] but I'm gonna promise you he's already
[18:59] walked through that door
[19:00] do you have butterflies I don't think so
[19:03] because he's hidden in you and me
[19:06] I mean how are we going to be able to
[19:07] commune with God when we get on the
[19:09] other side because we're going to be rid
[19:11] of this Humanity because we're going to
[19:13] look at two things that happened to Adam
[19:16] that he already had in his body but they
[19:18] were released when what happened in the
[19:21] garden we'll talk about in just a second
[19:22] but you see that the soul is the most
[19:25] important guy brother Brown said if God
[19:27] can never get that soul to stand still
[19:28] long enough
[19:30] a couple of you have told me that during
[19:34] this when we were talking about the the
[19:36] new birth that you got the new birth
[19:38] because of listening to the teaching not
[19:40] just of me but of all of us oh how that
[19:43] soul is the one that needs to be saved
[19:46] your spirit realm can be fooled
[19:49] your spirit realm can be fooled into
[19:52] believing you're a believer
[19:56] but when that Soul ever gets the new
[19:58] birth that's not make believe
[20:01] that's true believing and you just gotta
[20:04] let it out because it's still it's still
[20:06] encased in this Humanity it's still
[20:08] encased in negativism it's still
[20:10] encasing uh brother Joel Forney why is
[20:13] he was you woo
[20:15] there's no Ozil as you will in your soul
[20:17] if you're born again
[20:20] so let that thing out release it
[20:23] let it do his job
[20:24] because we're gonna see in just a minute
[20:25] how your body releases something when
[20:28] it's fearful
[20:29] but it also releases something to calm
[20:31] you down your own body Adam had it when
[20:35] it was made he just never had to use it
[20:37] because he'd never been separated from
[20:39] God
[20:41] no fear hey Daddy how you doing good I'm
[20:44] good I'm and Adam knew he was God he
[20:47] didn't know he didn't say well is there
[20:49] another person or something no he knew
[20:51] that was God
[20:52] because God came down and spoke to Adam
[20:55] in the cool of the day
[20:57] and as brother Brown says how you doing
[20:59] Adam
[21:00] had a good day
[21:02] oh wave you just look so good y'all my
[21:05] perfect children well boy something
[21:07] changed though
[21:08] a little bit later
[21:10] and we'll look at it it's called sin but
[21:13] it was called eating off the tree of
[21:15] knowledge of Good and Evil not the Tree
[21:16] of Life
[21:17] but God promised us and I want you to
[21:19] see this I will restore to you
[21:22] the years in other words 2 000 years
[21:25] that this bug has eat all these and eat
[21:29] it down to a stomp it almost killed him
[21:31] in the Dark Ages and almost cut the
[21:34] light out but God said I will restore in
[21:38] other words I'm going to bring that
[21:39] thing back up out of a stump because the
[21:42] life's in The Roots they couldn't pull
[21:43] the roots out because God said I will
[21:45] restore what's he going to restore the
[21:48] gift to you he's going to restore
[21:50] happiness to you he's going to restore
[21:52] these virtues to you so that you know
[21:54] how to be happy
[21:55] they some people in this world do not
[21:57] know how to be happy
[21:58] if you were to present happy to him they
[22:00] just throw it away
[22:02] if you could put in a box and hand it to
[22:04] him
[22:04] they go oh really
[22:06] Jim's sister is the same way bless her
[22:08] heart if she was completely healed of
[22:10] everything she wouldn't know what to do
[22:11] she'd still be miserable
[22:13] right misery loves what
[22:16] company
[22:18] so let's don't be miserable people
[22:19] that's why I like to hang that's why I
[22:22] like to get good holy ghost-filled
[22:23] friends I know we have certain friends
[22:26] out in the world that we have to deal
[22:27] with they're not friends like you guys
[22:28] are they're not friends like we we are
[22:31] as a as a body of Believers we are not
[22:34] just friends we're family members right
[22:37] all right so he's going to restore and
[22:39] we know what he's going to restore the
[22:40] canker worm eat it caterpillar remember
[22:42] it's the same worm so it's the same
[22:43] devil
[22:45] but you shall eat in plenty and be
[22:47] satisfied and praise the name of your
[22:48] God that half dwell what wondrously with
[22:51] you
[22:53] and my people shall never be ashamed
[22:56] Are you ashamed to be a Christian
[22:59] Are you ashamed that they talk about you
[23:01] Are you ashamed are you really I mean
[23:04] you're ashamed come on
[23:07] Paul says I'm not ashamed of this gospel
[23:09] in which I've been given to preach I'm
[23:11] not I'm ashamed of it
[23:13] as I've said before I'm not ashamed of
[23:15] this man message I'm not ashamed to be a
[23:17] follower of William Branham
[23:21] people there
[23:24] don't tell me first
[23:27] no they won't get it first but you kind
[23:29] of come around somewhere and if they
[23:31] truly are interested in what you're
[23:33] saying they'll say would you get that
[23:35] from
[23:36] that's where'd you get that from
[23:40] I got a place I found a church age book
[23:42] downstairs and you know what I'm gonna
[23:43] do
[23:44] there's a place there on on
[23:47] on Joe Chandler Road going to
[23:49] Gainesville there's a little lady there
[23:51] who's got a little box you see that Mom
[23:53] that Joe y'all you see a little yellow
[23:55] box well I know the lady because she was
[23:57] on my mail route before and she's really
[23:59] a sweet lady but she puts books in there
[24:01] she says take one leave one
[24:04] so I'm gonna go out there and take one
[24:05] and I'm Gonna Leave a church age book
[24:07] and I'm gonna make sure you I'm gonna
[24:09] write up Donnie fabush's name on it
[24:12] and uh
[24:14] didn't you
[24:17] put your address and your phone number
[24:18] call me anytime day or night foreign
[24:23] but I'm gonna do that I'm gonna slip on
[24:25] him I didn't think we had any churches
[24:26] books downstairs but we do have a few so
[24:28] I'm gonna stick one if that's all right
[24:29] I mean put one in there hey if I take
[24:31] one they may they may become a Believer
[24:33] you never know
[24:36] you know how many miracles we've seen of
[24:37] people overseas that somebody throw the
[24:39] book Away in a toilet or in a bathroom
[24:41] and they use part of it for toilet paper
[24:44] but the other half was left praise God
[24:46] the bottom half was left that told him
[24:48] where to go word of God publication or
[24:50] wherever it was or or over in
[24:52] Jeffersonville at the time it's been
[24:53] many years ago and they called it now
[24:55] they're a message preacher and got a big
[24:57] message church somewhere over overseas
[24:58] so so praise God he can get people
[25:00] anyway
[25:01] right what America work and God we have
[25:06] 28 says Whom Shall he teach knowledge
[25:09] and Whom Shall he make to understand
[25:11] Doctrine them that are weaned from the
[25:13] milk and draw them from the breast we'll
[25:15] get to this just in a few minutes
[25:17] but I want to reiterate this when we
[25:18] look at that word knowledge
[25:21] do not think of worldly knowledge
[25:26] because worldly knowledge has no value
[25:30] but brother mom said holy ghost virtue
[25:32] Holy Ghost knowledge the the knowledge
[25:35] of Jesus Christ not the knowledge of
[25:37] your neighbor the knowledge of of
[25:39] Einstein not that that will that will
[25:42] actually get you killed
[25:43] God is eaten off the wrong tree but we
[25:46] got to have Holy Ghost knowledge to be
[25:48] able to what discern right from wrong
[25:51] in your little in your little world
[25:53] everybody with me all right you discern
[25:56] it from what the word of God
[25:58] and thank God for a prophet that could
[26:00] discern the thoughts and intents of the
[26:01] heart but thank God for a Bible that
[26:04] tells us you can do the same thing not
[26:06] in a way like used to be before but
[26:09] every one of us has a certain amount of
[26:11] discernment if you'll just let the Lord
[26:13] do it and you listen to him all right
[26:15] all right well we're coming to adoption
[26:17] and that's what we're we'll probably
[26:19] talk about Saturday a little bit because
[26:21] the question was
[26:22] what is that Holy Spirit up there for
[26:24] well that is what to place you into
[26:27] adoption is to put you in a place where
[26:29] God can use you all right nobody with me
[26:34] that's what we're heading towards
[26:35] because you can't take a doc you can't
[26:37] not be adopted and then The Headstone
[26:39] come and fit down where it's supposed to
[26:41] fit
[26:43] I know some of you didn't didn't get
[26:45] that but that's what we're working
[26:46] toward we're working toward getting
[26:48] because look this right here can't fall
[26:50] on this
[26:51] look at the look at the shape this is a
[26:54] perfect shape and when it sets down it's
[26:56] going to sit down right on brother I'm
[26:58] calls it a flange
[27:01] sort of fit over it so it'll shed the
[27:03] water what shed the water your life
[27:07] so this knowledge is not knowledge of
[27:10] the world it is good to have knowledge
[27:12] do not take your kids out of school
[27:14] please give them an education if you
[27:16] homeschool them that's great if you send
[27:18] them to public school that's fine
[27:20] but educate your kids all right then
[27:23] also integrate education as back here in
[27:26] the Sunday school class and downstairs
[27:27] in the Sunday school class and up here
[27:29] in the Sunday school class and
[27:31] 9 45 to
[27:33] four o'clock on Sunday you just get a
[27:35] good old you know you get a whole bunch
[27:37] of curriculum going on here and then on
[27:39] Wednesday night too with all these
[27:40] brothers preaching and to me it's a
[27:42] treasure Trove of true knowledge not
[27:45] just knowledge there's true knowledge
[27:47] Satan's got knowledge Satan's got
[27:49] knowledge of the Bible he knows the
[27:51] Bible he knows the message of the hour
[27:52] but
[27:55] this is producing God not producing
[27:59] another person it's producing the same
[28:01] person
[28:02] like I said before it's not two-ness
[28:05] we're not we're not Tunis we're
[28:06] producing Jesus Christ back again in the
[28:09] church that ought to make you happy
[28:11] that's what we're heading toward not
[28:13] toward another man we're heading toward
[28:15] Jesus Christ
[28:18] so knowledge II Peter 1 verse 5 says
[28:20] beside this giving all diligence in
[28:22] other words what am I saying besides
[28:24] this besides your new birth knowledge
[28:27] see knowledge
[28:29] at the new birth is that
[28:32] water baptism in the name of the Lord
[28:34] Jesus Christ is right
[28:38] and then what Peter said Peter said
[28:40] repent and be baptized in the name of
[28:43] Jesus Christ for your mission of sins
[28:44] and you shall receive the gift of the
[28:46] Holy Ghost for that promise that's a
[28:49] promise not right here
[28:51] that's a promise down here
[28:54] I promise to give you the teacher
[28:58] now I know as well as y'all do
[29:01] some of y'all didn't listen to your
[29:03] teachers in school it's obvious
[29:07] I did Brother George I was a straight A
[29:09] student now my family can't even fathom
[29:12] that but
[29:13] but I made it straight A didn't make a
[29:15] beetle I got in college
[29:17] but I studied
[29:19] knowledge
[29:21] but holy ghost and all that see that
[29:22] knowledge didn't do nothing but take me
[29:24] away from God
[29:25] that knowledge I learned in school if
[29:27] I'd have just stayed with that it took
[29:29] me away from God and it did take me away
[29:30] from God
[29:31] but the knowledge that we're talking
[29:33] about here it takes you not just to God
[29:35] it takes you up into God
[29:37] it takes you up into his mind that's why
[29:39] brother Adam said let's go back in the
[29:41] back part of God's mind
[29:43] he said let's go by he didn't say I'm
[29:45] gonna go biting and shut it when I get
[29:47] done
[29:48] he said let's go back in the back part
[29:51] of God's mind he brought us into the
[29:53] mind of God
[29:56] that's why we're feeding off the
[29:58] unfailing body word of the son of man
[30:03] the person
[30:04] of Jesus Christ
[30:06] besides this what besides the New Birth
[30:09] the knowledge you need to be baptized
[30:10] the knowledge you need to cut that
[30:12] knowledge is not knowledge to tell you
[30:13] to come to church
[30:15] right right
[30:17] that's right that knowledge is above
[30:20] that you should buy the new birth know
[30:23] to come to church
[30:25] sorry so this knowledge is separated
[30:28] from that knowledge because this
[30:30] knowledge everywhere we look we see that
[30:33] it's a furtherment look such as belongs
[30:36] to the more advanced
[30:38] you can put that yeah you got it over
[30:40] there
[30:41] you can take that down if you want to
[30:43] miss Abby Grace
[30:45] but it belongs to the more advanced
[30:47] knowledge that we're talking about in
[30:51] the Statue of perfect man especially if
[30:52] things lawful and unlawful for
[30:54] Christians you know what the world's
[30:56] lost that though the World by their
[30:58] knowledge has told them they could wear
[31:00] pants if you're a woman
[31:02] and you can cut your hair if you're a
[31:04] woman and you're fine now that's the
[31:06] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[31:07] that's not the Tree of Life
[31:11] moral wisdom such as this scene and what
[31:15] right living
[31:18] Genesis 2 9.
[31:20] and now the ground made the Lord God
[31:21] grow every tree Pleasant to the site
[31:23] good for food now that's the trees
[31:25] that's got roots
[31:27] then now he's talking about the tree of
[31:29] knowledge the Tree of Life
[31:30] which is Jesus Christ also in the midst
[31:33] of the garden of the tree of knowledge
[31:34] of Good and Evil they were right there
[31:37] they were intertwined
[31:40] it took it took someone to tell you
[31:43] which one was right and wrong because
[31:44] you know what folks I'm telling you
[31:46] something
[31:46] when I say the tree of life and I say
[31:48] the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[31:50] I'll bet you in your mind in your brain
[31:52] you got one beautiful tree and one ugly
[31:55] one
[31:56] come on somebody
[31:58] dream of knowledge of Good and Evil
[32:00] Tree of Life
[32:02] no no no they were the same as you
[32:05] looked at it
[32:09] twins
[32:11] twins
[32:14] I believe even brother Brown and I'll
[32:16] try to look it up I think he said one
[32:17] time that their their limbs were
[32:19] intertwined
[32:22] because it was so close
[32:25] that tree of life was not over here and
[32:26] it was shining and big old apples and
[32:29] fruit and this one over here with some
[32:30] Dead stick no that one was probably more
[32:33] beautiful than that because that's what
[32:35] got even trouble
[32:36] that didn't that didn't make her do what
[32:40] she did that did
[32:41] because of beauty we'll read it in just
[32:43] a minute
[32:45] Genesis 2 6 and the Lord commanded the
[32:47] man saying of every tree of the garden
[32:48] thou May freely eat
[32:49] any tree you want to but in the tree of
[32:52] knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt
[32:53] not eat for the day you eat that day you
[32:56] shall die that tree is a death tree not
[32:59] a life tree
[33:01] all right so we know knowledge means the
[33:03] fact or condition of knowing something
[33:04] with familiarity look gain to experience
[33:06] not just not just acts 2 38.
[33:13] that's down at the bottom
[33:14] that's it faith
[33:16] that's knowing you need to be born again
[33:19] that's the knowledge that you're lost
[33:21] that's not that knowledge that knowledge
[33:24] at that point is not telling you you're
[33:26] lost
[33:28] it's telling you how to be a better
[33:29] Christian
[33:31] everybody with me without
[33:33] the circumstance or condition of
[33:35] apprehending Truth
[33:37] or fact through reasoning John 8 verse
[33:40] 31 say Jesus said to the Jews that
[33:41] believe in him if you continue in my
[33:43] word then you are my disciple disciples
[33:46] indeed and you shall know the truth
[33:49] now this is where we're going to get to
[33:50] and you shall know the truth and the
[33:52] truth will make you free I want you to
[33:54] pay attention here just a few minutes I
[33:55] may have to say some words that I don't
[33:57] want to but this is going to be you know
[33:59] what that word know is
[34:01] and the Greek Lexicon is perceive or
[34:03] understand or get knowledge of but I'm
[34:05] going to make a point here in just a
[34:07] second to understand perceive have
[34:08] knowledge of to understand it's a Jewish
[34:10] idiom for sexual intercourse between a
[34:12] man and a woman Bible says what Adam
[34:14] knew his wife Eve now it wasn't that he
[34:16] knew her shook her hand said hey how you
[34:18] doing no ain't known her for ages
[34:20] but he knew her in a different way
[34:23] there had never been before
[34:26] Genesis 3 6 is when the woman saw that
[34:28] the tree was good for food which tree
[34:30] pretty tree
[34:32] not Tree of Life pretty tree
[34:36] and that it was pleasant to the eyes
[34:39] never seen a tree that made me do that
[34:42] so this must have been a person with a
[34:45] Doctrine I'm going to tell you something
[34:46] that Beast was probably extremely
[34:50] beautiful
[34:52] he was right between an eight or an ape
[34:55] and a man
[34:56] so he was just he was just Pleasant to
[34:58] the eye because that's where it came
[35:00] from
[35:01] a tree to be desired to make one wise oh
[35:05] Eve be careful you're fixing to know
[35:07] something you don't want to know
[35:09] she took of the fruit thereof and did
[35:12] eat and gave also unto her husband in
[35:15] other words he in other words he knew
[35:17] her right in Genesis 3 he says Adam knew
[35:19] his wife Eve and they had children and
[35:22] the eyes of them both watched the eyes
[35:24] of them both were open and they knew
[35:26] that they were naked now they had walked
[35:28] thousands maybe millions of years
[35:30] completely naked
[35:35] I can't fathom that
[35:38] without something going on
[35:40] think about it
[35:43] and I don't believe he said now don't
[35:44] touch me you stay over there no that was
[35:47] his buddy that was his wife that was his
[35:49] partner they just had no carnal name to
[35:52] what release something into their
[35:54] bloodstream we'll talk about just a
[35:56] minute to make them do what they did
[35:58] everybody with me
[35:59] but I want to make sure that you know
[36:01] this it's not just this is not just this
[36:03] is knowledge up here this is not
[36:04] knowledge down at the bottom of the
[36:05] pyramid
[36:06] and the eyes of them both were open and
[36:08] they knew that they were naked do you
[36:10] want in other words I had a new
[36:12] understanding a new knowledge that
[36:14] they'd never had before
[36:15] and they sold figures in other words
[36:17] they had a feeling
[36:19] that's why feelings will get you in
[36:21] trouble
[36:23] kids do not kiss
[36:26] before marriage
[36:30] prophet of God knew exactly what he was
[36:32] talking about
[36:37] and they heard the voice of the Lord
[36:39] walking in the garden now they had done
[36:41] this many times years hundreds and
[36:43] thousands of years they had heard that
[36:45] voice Walking In the Garden of Eden
[36:49] and Adam and his wife hid themselves
[36:52] from the presence of the Lord God
[36:54] amongst the Trees of the garden
[36:57] and the Lord God called into Adam and
[36:58] said unto him where art thou
[37:00] and he said I heard thy voice in the
[37:02] garden and I was afraid
[37:05] never had he felt that before
[37:08] and I got to looking around a little bit
[37:10] when you're afraid your body releases a
[37:15] chemical
[37:19] it's called cortisol
[37:22] everybody with me
[37:24] it comes from a gland
[37:26] in your body that's already there
[37:29] it's what was already an atom's body
[37:32] because God knew they had to be perfect
[37:33] human being so he got all held the parts
[37:35] and he had everything inside of it but
[37:37] it usually comes from
[37:39] your
[37:40] adrenal gland
[37:43] and what happens is when you get excited
[37:45] it releases cortisol it's a traumatic
[37:49] stress or fear
[37:51] drug or
[37:54] whatever you want to call it but it's
[37:56] released into your body Adam had never
[37:58] had that released in his body before he
[38:00] had it in him why was it released
[38:02] because of the knowledge that he eat off
[38:04] of that tree Peter stayed with that tree
[38:06] he did not had that
[38:08] right anybody with me same way with me
[38:10] and you which one are you going to eat
[38:11] off of that one or that one I don't want
[38:13] something foreign relief in my body
[38:15] but cortisol
[38:17] but what happens too though it comes
[38:19] from your pituitary gland
[38:22] and it releases also though cortisol is
[38:26] released that's where the fear comes
[38:28] from but your body automatically
[38:29] releases another one and it's about this
[38:31] long
[38:32] but it releases one to calm you down
[38:35] already inside your body
[38:39] that's why fear comes from inside you
[38:44] I fear
[38:47] I'm sorry Lord I'm afraid I've got this
[38:50] feeling I've never had before
[38:53] when are we gonna get rid of that
[38:55] because if your body this is my point if
[38:57] your body can create inside of you a
[39:01] chemical to react to that
[39:03] guess what
[39:06] can't you take the Holy Ghost and do the
[39:08] same thing
[39:10] why should you fear why does it
[39:16] ain't fear not
[39:18] in other words do not release don't let
[39:21] your body release that cortisol you're
[39:23] going to get you're going to get afraid
[39:25] but fear not
[39:28] then also there's a drug called
[39:30] serotonin I know it's named for Sarah
[39:32] Roberts
[39:36] but serotonin Works about the same way
[39:38] in other words what happens when
[39:40] somebody gets high
[39:42] that dopamine that's why they call it
[39:45] dope
[39:46] it's putting your body in such high
[39:48] levels it makes you have a state of
[39:49] euphoria
[39:51] and your body can't produce enough drugs
[39:54] inside of you not out there inside of
[39:56] you to calm it down So Adam come to a
[40:00] place he was he had a feeling he'd never
[40:01] had before
[40:03] he was afraid he had the knowledge of
[40:06] Good and Evil not the knowledge of the
[40:08] Tree of Life
[40:09] so you and I were born with that inside
[40:12] of our body that cortisol and and
[40:15] serotonin
[40:17] there's a lot of different things that
[40:18] does but that's just two things that
[40:20] that react in your body that's already
[40:22] there
[40:23] it's already there in the gland just
[40:24] waiting on you to either get fit get
[40:26] afraid
[40:27] or calm you down
[40:29] of course they make drugs to do that too
[40:31] but what does it do it affects those
[40:33] cortisol you can actually take serotonin
[40:35] as a supplement
[40:38] but you see what happened here's my
[40:40] point we've all got everything inside of
[40:42] us to either be fearful
[40:45] or release that other drug the Holy
[40:48] Ghost
[40:49] to calm it down
[40:51] that's why that's why fear not Jesus
[40:54] walked up to him said fear not look
[40:55] don't release that because you're going
[40:56] to think differently how many times
[40:58] you've been just going along
[40:59] everything's cool everything's good and
[41:01] then all of a sudden boom
[41:04] a car hits you
[41:06] or or you ain't paying attention like
[41:08] boy and hit your head on something
[41:13] what does it do it releases that drug
[41:16] inside of you the court is all the
[41:18] different things to make you fearful and
[41:20] then your body has to counter react that
[41:23] when you're sitting here today
[41:26] what's being released in your body today
[41:29] natural versus spiritual
[41:31] are you letting fear overtake what God's
[41:35] already given you
[41:37] are you letting fear do that
[41:40] because Adam did
[41:42] Adam knew he'd done wrong and his body
[41:44] released a drug
[41:47] that said I was afraid
[41:51] you and I are going to have to remember
[41:52] one thing
[41:53] when God said fear not
[41:55] that's what's going to take us to a body
[41:57] change
[41:59] because we death is going to go up our
[42:01] sleeve and that cortisol is not going to
[42:04] come out
[42:06] brother Brown said we'd wipe it off
[42:08] wipe it off wipe it off wipe off death
[42:11] you say death and you got this little
[42:13] quiver inside of you right every time
[42:15] you say well he's gonna die oh my Lord
[42:18] all right I got this I got to go to the
[42:20] doctor and I don't know if that thing's
[42:21] a cancer or not
[42:24] fear brings what
[42:26] torment
[42:28] let's quit letting Satan torment us
[42:30] that's what I was getting rather um
[42:33] brother Daryl was and that's what was
[42:34] released to me from that is just just
[42:36] fear not Don't Fear The Thing
[42:39] right my brother but I'm saying why fear
[42:42] cancer because cancer is that thing when
[42:44] you say cancer it's like you're dead
[42:47] you're dead
[42:48] no it's not dead it's just a word it's a
[42:52] word for a devil
[42:54] and it releases cortisol and then that
[42:56] cortisol if you keep letting it get
[42:57] fearful what's going to happen is you're
[42:59] going to have a nervous breakdown
[43:01] stop that business I'm talking natural
[43:03] and Spirits you're gonna have a
[43:05] spiritual break now if you don't get in
[43:06] the word of God and let that release
[43:08] into your life yeah press play
[43:11] when you want to
[43:13] but listen to a good Holy Ghost Field
[43:15] preacher it'll do the same thing it'll
[43:18] release something inside of you that you
[43:19] don't know that you've got
[43:21] because if Adam was the first if he was
[43:24] the first Adam and that happened to him
[43:26] what happened to the second Adam
[43:29] he reversed that process
[43:31] and then where did he reverse to that in
[43:33] me and you
[43:34] take her back to the Garden of Eden
[43:38] take her back to no fear
[43:42] can you believe that
[43:44] hey now what brother Brown said all God
[43:47] was you pouring into Christ oh Christ
[43:48] was he poured into the church the bride
[43:50] to take her back to the Garden of Eden
[43:53] with no fear
[43:56] but we got to have what death destroyed
[43:58] here not there
[44:02] everybody with me
[44:04] just remember that
[44:06] even even as we look at I've read that
[44:09] many many that quote many many times
[44:12] where brother Brown says the right
[44:14] mental attitude
[44:16] toward any promise of God will bring it
[44:18] to pass when you have a negative
[44:20] attitude it releases in your body a real
[44:25] enzyme or a real
[44:28] substance that your body's got to react
[44:30] to
[44:31] that's my brother Brown what he's look
[44:33] he'd look at the women he say
[44:35] you've got a nervous condition
[44:37] and it's caused by menopause or it's
[44:40] caused by a member he told that one lady
[44:42] he said look I know your problem he said
[44:43] you're scared of dogs
[44:45] he said because when you were a little
[44:46] kid a dog either bitched you or run you
[44:49] know run at you and scared you it put
[44:51] fear it put that that cortisol or the
[44:54] serotonin put everything inside of her
[44:56] and every time she saw a dog
[44:58] that's why sometimes you talk about
[45:00] things
[45:01] I had a dream one time
[45:04] when I was a kid
[45:06] I had a dream that somebody's chasing me
[45:08] through the woods
[45:10] with an ax
[45:12] wasn't my brother
[45:15] wasn't my daddy
[45:17] what my mama could have been Anna but
[45:20] he was a little bit taller he was taller
[45:22] than that
[45:24] but I caught him
[45:28] I flipped him over
[45:30] and I hit him right here with that ax
[45:33] and when he bust open
[45:35] it was just like a piece of wood
[45:37] there was nothing like guts or it was
[45:40] just like when I split him he split like
[45:42] a like a uh a log and every time I go
[45:45] through the woods even hunting and man
[45:47] through the even in dark and even with a
[45:50] good flashlight and even with pop
[45:51] standing beside me
[45:56] I'm like
[46:01] why because I had that dream so many
[46:03] years ago and I can remember it I
[46:04] probably went in Jonas's age we were
[46:06] still living in uh in Gillsville on top
[46:08] of the hill so we moved there from there
[46:10] in 72. so I was just a kid but that
[46:14] impacted me so much till I hear you hear
[46:16] leaves crunching behind you
[46:19] it releases a lot of cortisol
[46:23] and you go why because of this an
[46:25] experience that you had before we've got
[46:27] to overcome that fear that the devil's
[46:30] the one that was behind us and he's the
[46:31] one that's chasing us but praise God I
[46:33] jerked that sucker around throwing him
[46:35] on the ground hit him in the head and
[46:36] busted him wide open and you know what
[46:39] there was nothing in him
[46:41] he's a bluff
[46:47] the word knowledge is one did not know
[46:49] something until that fact had a
[46:51] practical outworking in his life that's
[46:53] what knowledge this knowledge is it will
[46:56] have a practical outworking in your life
[46:59] it will not make you come to church more
[47:01] when you get the Holy Ghost that's when
[47:02] you start need to come to church more
[47:03] not here this is knowledge to tell you
[47:06] why
[47:07] you need to
[47:09] keep going more and more happy as a man
[47:11] that findeth wisdom and the man that
[47:14] geteth understanding for the merchandise
[47:16] of it is better than the merchandise of
[47:18] silver and fine gold
[47:21] she now turns into a she
[47:23] is more precious who's she she's the
[47:26] bride
[47:27] she is more precious than rubies and all
[47:30] things thou cast desire not to be
[47:32] compared unto her Length of days is in
[47:35] her right hand and then her left hand
[47:37] Rich is an honor her ways are ways of
[47:40] pleasantness and all her pastor peace
[47:42] doesn't that sound pretty good
[47:44] she is a tree of life
[47:47] to them that lay hold upon her
[47:50] and happy as everyone that retaineth her
[47:59] brother Brown said you're a Creator
[48:00] right
[48:02] you can change an atmosphere of a room
[48:03] just by walking in it if you've got the
[48:06] right attitude before you go in it
[48:08] that's why brother Brown said you need
[48:10] to pray you need to do whatever you need
[48:11] to do before you come through them doors
[48:14] because you're either gonna go leave
[48:15] worse or you're going to leave better
[48:16] you're either going to lay that thing
[48:18] down throw it away get something from
[48:19] God and go out the door are you going to
[48:21] bring it in here and you're going to let
[48:22] it absolutely you're going to have
[48:24] gallons and gallons of cortisol running
[48:26] through your body
[48:27] okay
[48:33] much less the devil
[48:36] and this I pray that your love may
[48:38] abound yet more and more what in
[48:39] knowledge and all judgment as I said
[48:42] before dare any one of you take a matter
[48:44] to another to court in other words don't
[48:46] go to law before the unjust
[48:48] and not before the Saints do you not
[48:50] know that the Saints will judge the
[48:51] world
[48:53] that's why we judge matters here we
[48:54] don't let the law judge matters Between
[48:56] Brothers now for them out there it says
[48:59] go to law before the unjust in other
[49:01] words don't you can't take something
[49:02] that we can deal with here and take it
[49:04] to a judge and have him decide in a
[49:06] Christian manner how to do something
[49:08] because most times that judge is not
[49:09] going to be a Christian he's going to
[49:10] look at the law and say that's it all
[49:12] right we believe in grace I I well I do
[49:15] I believe in grace amen
[49:19] do you not know that the Saints shall
[49:20] judge the world and if the world shall
[49:22] be judged by you are you unworthy to
[49:24] judge the smallest matters know you not
[49:27] that you shall judge angels
[49:29] how much more things that pertain to
[49:31] this life if then you have judgments of
[49:34] things pertaining to this life set them
[49:36] to judge who are least esteemed in the
[49:38] church
[49:39] in other words let the new guy do it
[49:43] pay it before the new guy if he's got
[49:45] the Holy Ghost that's what it says we'll
[49:46] read it the least esteemed in the church
[49:52] that's your perfect man brother Brown
[49:53] says and thirdly add knowledge knowledge
[49:55] now that don't mean worldly knowledge
[49:57] because that's foolishness to God but
[49:58] knowledge to what judge judge right from
[50:00] wrong how do you judge it then if you've
[50:02] got Christian knowledge with your virtue
[50:06] and Faith you judge whether the word is
[50:09] right
[50:10] or wrong
[50:11] but when you can see that the scripture
[50:13] is not contradictory that you can say
[50:15] that and can see that by the revelation
[50:17] of God the whole word is wrote in
[50:18] Mysteries and only the knowledge of God
[50:21] can reveal it now what we said before
[50:22] there's no prevailing power but a
[50:25] revelation that's that's what you need
[50:27] to pray for you don't need to pray for
[50:28] anything else but revelation God I'm
[50:30] already born if I'm already Born Again
[50:31] God give me a revelation
[50:33] I want to know more and how do you know
[50:35] more about him you get it revealed to
[50:37] you
[50:38] right
[50:40] it's that aha moment that you should say
[50:42] man I haven't seen that I might see it
[50:44] now
[50:46] we ought to be so happy when that
[50:48] happens
[50:50] that God the Creator the one that wrote
[50:52] it in mystery form
[50:54] he wrote it
[50:56] took from the wise and prudent but
[50:58] revealed It To Me and You by Holy Ghost
[51:00] knowledge not by the knowledge of the
[51:02] world
[51:03] thank you Lord have you ever just
[51:04] thanked God for that
[51:07] I mean there's some walking idiots
[51:09] around here I'm not talking about here
[51:10] I'm coming out in the world
[51:12] their whole mentality it's just totally
[51:16] messed up right
[51:18] and you know what they say we're crazy
[51:22] we'll find out
[51:25] only the knowledge of God can reveal it
[51:27] that when you get and say punctuate
[51:30] every word of God with an amen
[51:31] some of y'all ought to try that
[51:34] then add that to your faith
[51:36] 70 weeks today and your brother Brian
[51:37] says look the spirit of wisdom comes
[51:40] into the church
[51:41] to make known to the church by the
[51:43] revelation of the what of the Holy Ghost
[51:45] revelation of the Holy Ghost not
[51:47] Revelation that you need the Holy Ghost
[51:50] okay the Revelation that you need to
[51:52] Holy Ghost is right here
[51:54] the Revelation that you got the Holy
[51:56] Ghost and it can help you is right here
[51:58] that's going up that's moving up in God
[52:01] the spirit of wisdom comes into the
[52:03] church to make known to church by the
[52:04] revelation of the Holy Ghost bringing
[52:06] the church in and revealing what day
[52:08] we're living in we ought to know what
[52:10] day we're living in we're living in the
[52:12] last hours of the last day 30 Seconds To
[52:15] Midnight like brother
[52:16] brother Daryl was talking about
[52:18] it was three minutes when brother
[52:20] Branham was here now it's 30 seconds do
[52:22] you all know what that is it's an atomic
[52:24] clock like it's it's closer to be if it
[52:27] turns to midnight there's going to be an
[52:29] atomic war
[52:31] so we're only 30 seconds away from that
[52:33] and praise God brother Brown said not
[52:36] one bomb will fall
[52:42] get out of this thing
[52:43] take the fear everybody's afraid of it
[52:45] you say Atomic it's like cancer you go
[52:49] he ain't happened to the bride
[52:52] until we're out of here
[52:54] so don't even listen to that garbage all
[52:56] that talk about nuclear this and nuclear
[52:58] that oh the world's going to get a
[53:00] nuclear this and that but you and me are
[53:01] not going to be here if you are here you
[53:04] missed it
[53:05] [Music]
[53:08] the Holy Spirit comes to the church in
[53:10] the last days to reveal these great deep
[53:12] secret things
[53:14] do you understand now
[53:17] I believe in this church we've had that
[53:20] for years and years and years and I pray
[53:22] that we'll continue to hold that all
[53:24] together that we can have some good deep
[53:26] teaching
[53:28] listen you ought to know how to worship
[53:30] some of y'all been in the message 50
[53:31] years you ought to know how to worship
[53:33] some of you has been in the message two
[53:35] years you ought to know how to worship
[53:37] because you got to worship her inside of
[53:38] you
[53:40] amen
[53:41] so let's get past that part
[53:45] there shall come forth
[53:47] a rod out of the stem of Jesse a branch
[53:49] shall grow out of his roots and the
[53:51] spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him
[53:53] Spirit of wisdom and understanding now
[53:54] this is the person that's going to die
[53:56] for you and release his life back into
[53:59] you
[54:00] not a second person not part of him all
[54:03] of him
[54:04] because remember collectively we are
[54:07] what we are the fullness of the godhead
[54:10] bodily collectively not one person he
[54:13] divided himself under that Pentecost and
[54:15] he just keeps dividing and keeps
[54:16] dividing and keep dividing the spirit of
[54:18] counsel and might the spirit of
[54:21] knowledge and what of the fear of the
[54:22] Lord it's okay to fear of the Lord that
[54:24] doesn't release the cortisol that brings
[54:27] you up in God and it helps you not
[54:29] release cortisol
[54:32] because if Adam would have had to fear
[54:34] the lord he'd have been okay but he had
[54:36] the fear of Adam
[54:37] he had the fear of Adam in him when he
[54:39] said I fear ah not you me I I fear you
[54:43] Lord because I've done something wrong
[54:45] Ephesians 1 verse 17 the god of our Lord
[54:48] Jesus Christ the father of Glory may
[54:51] give unto you the spirit of wisdom and
[54:54] Revelation and the knowledge of him
[54:56] Sister Barbara was quoting a quote today
[54:59] on WhatsApp if some of you saw that and
[55:01] and she's listening in or watching in
[55:03] then uh
[55:05] Oh Sister Gail said tell everybody hey I
[55:07] think she's she's talked call Jim talked
[55:09] to her yesterday or so but I miss sister
[55:11] Gail we always forget to to say sister
[55:14] Gail when we say sister
[55:16] um when we say sister Freda and we say
[55:17] sister Johnny but also sister Gail she's
[55:21] watching in so she's keeping up with us
[55:23] she's still there she's real faithful
[55:27] just just pray for her
[55:29] that may give you the spirit of wisdom
[55:30] and revelation
[55:32] and the knowledge of him the eyes of
[55:34] your understanding being enlightened
[55:36] that you may know
[55:39] that you may know
[55:41] what is the hope of his calling and what
[55:44] the riches of the glory of his
[55:46] inheritance in the Saints
[55:50] God's inheritance is living inside of
[55:52] you if you're born again
[55:54] you are the inheritance of God
[55:57] and we keep going talk about the Book of
[55:59] Revelations there's nothing of such
[56:00] prevailing power as the revelation of
[56:03] the word we can't live without
[56:05] revelation
[56:07] right we can't
[56:09] we dry up and backslide
[56:12] well I'll preach anyway
[56:14] we all do
[56:17] it's not gonna pop like popcorn and
[56:19] we're gonna get a revelation
[56:20] but like little sister Barbara was going
[56:22] putting she actually put two quotes
[56:23] together so she's not gonna find one
[56:25] quote just like that but brother Brown
[56:27] says when the bride realizes who she is
[56:29] and what she's doing here she'll become
[56:32] an invincible Army but he also said in
[56:35] um 1953 I believe it was in questions
[56:37] and answers he said he said that that
[56:40] when the door of the Gentile church is
[56:42] closed God or what anoint a church then
[56:43] so there's two different quotes there
[56:45] but there are nice to put them together
[56:46] it's okay I don't mind that that's good
[56:48] but but he'll what do in one year
[56:53] what theologists has tried to do in 2000
[56:55] years he's doing it now though
[56:58] he's not going to wait he's had to start
[57:01] somewhere he started with the prophet's
[57:03] message
[57:04] and you and I are recipients of that if
[57:06] you believe that
[57:08] so there's no prevailing power as the
[57:10] revelation of the word and I say through
[57:12] the message of the hour
[57:15] through the message of the hour that's
[57:17] what I'm reading I'm reading the message
[57:18] of the hour
[57:21] keep going just to save time
[57:24] but the prevailing overcoming church is
[57:28] built on Revelation so we can expect God
[57:31] look we can expect God to reveal his
[57:33] truth to us
[57:34] expectation that God's going to give you
[57:37] a revelation
[57:38] God help me I've got questions put
[57:41] somebody in the Pulpit they'll answer
[57:43] these questions put somebody
[57:46] you can tell me somebody
[57:47] over breakfast put somebody in front of
[57:50] me that'll help me help me have you ever
[57:52] done that no you got to get desperate
[57:54] enough to want it yeah
[57:57] I can't live without knowing about God
[58:01] oh yeah we know about all these other
[58:02] things sure sure I like to read about
[58:04] this for like the cortisol and the
[58:07] serotonin and different things and I
[58:09] like to read about stuff like that but
[58:10] there's no prevailing power in that it
[58:12] just helps for you to understand certain
[58:15] things that goes on in your body all
[58:17] right however you actually don't need a
[58:19] revelation of water baptism it's right
[58:21] there staring you in the face
[58:25] Revelation to Jesus Christ churches book
[58:29] brother I'm saying we need to call on
[58:30] God for Revelation more than anything in
[58:32] the world he said how you want to get
[58:33] closer to God brother Brown said pray
[58:34] and read your Bible if you pray and read
[58:37] your Bible I promise you God will give
[58:39] you a revelation
[58:40] he'll answer your question
[58:45] we have accepted the Bible we have
[58:47] accepted the great truths of it but it
[58:50] still is not real to most people because
[58:52] the Revelation by the spirit is not
[58:54] there
[58:55] I'm just quoting quotes I'm quoting what
[58:57] brother Brown said
[58:59] because most people the revelation of
[59:01] the spirit is not there the word has not
[59:04] been quickened listen pile it in though
[59:08] pile it in
[59:10] store it up in your Storehouse not some
[59:12] Storehouse over here somewhere not
[59:14] Jeffersonville sorry about that
[59:16] start up inside of you
[59:18] jeffersonville's not taking a Rapture
[59:20] you are
[59:22] ampersand
[59:29] the Bible says in Corinthians 5 21 that
[59:32] we have become the righteousness of God
[59:34] by our Union with Jesus Christ did you
[59:36] get it
[59:37] it says that we are the very
[59:39] righteousness of God himself by being in
[59:42] Christ that's a revelation
[59:45] because listen every other quote is from
[59:47] the Bible born in sin shaping iniquity
[59:50] on your way to hell
[59:51] contrary to God Peter Paul said born
[59:54] contrary to God
[59:57] born
[59:58] what's that all Paul says whoremongers
[1:00:00] uh he lists a whole bunch of really nice
[1:00:04] people
[1:00:06] not really but you know what he said
[1:00:08] such for some of you
[1:00:10] but you're washed
[1:00:13] if you'll believe it
[1:00:15] you're sanctified
[1:00:17] you're born again
[1:00:19] that unclean spirits out of your soul
[1:00:21] now let's work on the next guy
[1:00:24] it says that we are the very
[1:00:26] righteousness of God himself by being in
[1:00:28] Christ it says that he Jesus became sin
[1:00:30] for us it does not say he became sinful
[1:00:33] but he became sin for us that by our
[1:00:36] Union with him what's the union knowing
[1:00:39] him
[1:00:41] intimate relationship Jesus said hey you
[1:00:44] shout my name you can cast out Devils
[1:00:46] you can have prayer lines you can have
[1:00:48] all these different things you want
[1:00:49] that's okay
[1:00:51] needful
[1:00:52] until you don't need it
[1:00:54] needful until you don't need it
[1:00:57] because you can't take laying on hands
[1:00:58] out of the Bible or you take it's about
[1:01:00] peace of the Bible out
[1:01:02] all right but we got to come to a place
[1:01:04] though we're like Gentile though just
[1:01:05] say the word
[1:01:06] just say the word
[1:01:09] just say the word
[1:01:11] I know I'll get something you just say
[1:01:13] the word
[1:01:14] all right
[1:01:16] he became sin
[1:01:18] for us that we by our Union with him so
[1:01:21] what are we doing he's taking on our sin
[1:01:22] we're taking on his righteousness
[1:01:26] do you really believe that
[1:01:28] you better believe it
[1:01:30] if we accept the fact and we must say it
[1:01:34] with me and we must that was poor and we
[1:01:39] must that he literally became sin for us
[1:01:42] by his substitution for us then we must
[1:01:46] also accept the fact that we buy our
[1:01:48] Union with him have become the very
[1:01:50] righteousness of God to reject one is to
[1:01:53] reject the other to accept one is to
[1:01:55] accept the other now we know the Bible
[1:01:58] says that
[1:01:59] it can't be denied
[1:02:01] but the revelation of it is missing
[1:02:07] let's get born again
[1:02:09] let's get that Revelation down
[1:02:11] then let's go to the Revelation that's
[1:02:13] missing of knowledge
[1:02:15] stay away from the Tree of knowledge get
[1:02:18] to the Tree of Life
[1:02:20] know which ones which
[1:02:22] you know what brother Brown you know
[1:02:24] continuation of the quote is that
[1:02:26] brother Brown says when the church
[1:02:28] realizes who she is and what she's doing
[1:02:29] she'll be an invincible Army when she
[1:02:31] gets a true revelation of the two
[1:02:33] spirits in the framework of this church
[1:02:37] discharge
[1:02:38] this church
[1:02:41] will be what an invincible Army because
[1:02:44] you know what Satan will be totally
[1:02:45] thwarted he said
[1:02:47] because he won't have anything to work
[1:02:48] in
[1:02:49] because he's still working on that
[1:02:51] Spirit Realm
[1:02:52] but there's going to be a day folks I
[1:02:53] promise you somebody's going to make it
[1:02:55] you just got to believe it's you
[1:02:57] but you got to go by the required
[1:02:59] curriculum you can't make it like
[1:03:00] brother Brown said and I'll read it to
[1:03:02] you later on not now where brother Brown
[1:03:03] says you can't jump up if you get way up
[1:03:06] here and it breaks he said down here he
[1:03:08] said you're gonna fall
[1:03:10] you got to be solidified all the way up
[1:03:12] that's why when you get up there to that
[1:03:14] part of the Holy Spirit
[1:03:15] you're a rock
[1:03:17] he sealed you in
[1:03:19] and he's going to be able to use you
[1:03:23] till the day of your Redemption
[1:03:26] but the revelation of it is missing and
[1:03:28] it's not real look to the majority of
[1:03:31] Satan's kids
[1:03:33] I didn't say that
[1:03:35] it is not real to the majority of God's
[1:03:38] children
[1:03:39] why they're still children
[1:03:43] it is just a good verse in the Bible
[1:03:45] Acts 2 38.
[1:03:48] but we need to have it made alive to us
[1:03:52] that will take
[1:03:54] a revelation
[1:03:55] Hebrews 5 13 is for everyone that uses
[1:03:58] milk is unskillful in the word of
[1:04:00] righteousness for he is a babe
[1:04:03] that doesn't say you're it doesn't say
[1:04:04] you're lost it said you're just
[1:04:05] unskillful
[1:04:08] God sends a preacher by now see that's
[1:04:10] another thing I want to make this point
[1:04:11] Thank you Lord for bringing that back
[1:04:13] you know when you're sitting here in a
[1:04:15] service
[1:04:16] not so much this church but other places
[1:04:18] thank God
[1:04:20] and then you have a preacher that comes
[1:04:21] out and he preaches about be have an
[1:04:23] eternal seat you know something that
[1:04:25] you've not been taught
[1:04:26] something that you know is a little bit
[1:04:28] wrong
[1:04:29] what goes off
[1:04:33] cortisol
[1:04:35] your body releases
[1:04:38] something to say
[1:04:40] something ain't right amen where's that
[1:04:43] release from it's released from your
[1:04:45] body but it's by the Holy Ghost
[1:04:47] by the Holy Ghost inside of you because
[1:04:49] you know what there's hundreds of people
[1:04:51] sitting around you that believe that
[1:04:54] same thing they had a different feeling
[1:04:56] than you did
[1:04:58] there was something released different
[1:05:00] than was what was released in you ever
[1:05:03] had that little they call it butterflies
[1:05:04] but you ever had a little thing like man
[1:05:06] that ain't something about that's not
[1:05:07] right
[1:05:08] hey man
[1:05:09] [Music]
[1:05:10] 600 people shouting scream and 10 of us
[1:05:13] just sat there
[1:05:15] why did we just sit there we were taught
[1:05:17] right
[1:05:19] we weren't fearful we had no fear
[1:05:25] I promise you you start talking about
[1:05:27] Daniel 70 weeks a lot of stuff goes off
[1:05:32] some of you ministers you've been in the
[1:05:34] ministers a lot of stuff goes off
[1:05:37] and it ain't good don't smell good don't
[1:05:38] look good
[1:05:40] they start blowing up all over the place
[1:05:42] why there's something released in their
[1:05:44] body that they're not used to they're
[1:05:46] fearful
[1:05:47] that they don't have the answer
[1:05:50] or they have this defense mechanism is
[1:05:52] well you don't know anything and I don't
[1:05:54] know anything and that's not your
[1:05:55] Revelation that's whatever but strong
[1:05:57] meat belongs why is that why does that
[1:05:59] trigger go off because not knowledge
[1:06:02] down here it's not saying that those
[1:06:04] people are not born again it's saying
[1:06:06] they don't have the knowledge complete
[1:06:08] knowledge of the truth
[1:06:10] not de-christianizing people we are not
[1:06:13] listen you can be wrong in your Doctrine
[1:06:16] and be baptized with the Holy Ghost and
[1:06:18] have the new birth but you can't have
[1:06:21] the word presented to you and stay that
[1:06:23] way and have the new birth
[1:06:26] but strong meat belongs to them that are
[1:06:28] of what full age
[1:06:31] even those who by reason of use
[1:06:35] have their senses exercised
[1:06:38] get your faith muscles have them
[1:06:41] exercise by what to discern both Good
[1:06:43] and Evil
[1:06:46] if everything was good we'd be happy
[1:06:49] but when that evil pops up we're able to
[1:06:51] discern there's something goes off in
[1:06:53] your soul in your holy ghost that says
[1:06:55] what that's not right
[1:06:57] or listen or less reason together let's
[1:07:00] study this thing out let's see where the
[1:07:03] difference is
[1:07:04] I like what brother Brown said brother
[1:07:06] Brown said look you both can't be right
[1:07:09] you can both be wrong
[1:07:11] but one of you can't be wrong another
[1:07:13] one right one right another wrong
[1:07:17] if you're wrong it's wrong
[1:07:21] but both of you can't have two opinions
[1:07:23] on the word of God and they both be
[1:07:25] right
[1:07:26] can't happen
[1:07:27] sorry about that
[1:07:29] discern is what to separate make a
[1:07:32] distinction discriminate prefer that's
[1:07:34] why we had a teacher that taught us how
[1:07:37] to rightly divide the word of truth I'm
[1:07:39] talking about brother Ryan I'm going to
[1:07:40] talk about brother Dale talking about
[1:07:41] the rest of y'all sitting here
[1:07:43] a progression of teachers that taught us
[1:07:46] every little Dot and every little
[1:07:49] comma and everything even the A's and
[1:07:52] these we understand that
[1:07:56] because we can separate rally dividing
[1:07:58] the Bible says the word of Truth
[1:08:02] for the word of God is quick
[1:08:04] and Powerful
[1:08:06] and sharper than any two-edged sword
[1:08:09] piercing even through the dividing
[1:08:10] asunder of Soul and Spirit that's why we
[1:08:12] can look at that chart and by the
[1:08:14] prophet's message we'll be able to
[1:08:15] understand that we can separate those
[1:08:17] two
[1:08:19] because I promise you folks most people
[1:08:21] you can't separate them you cannot
[1:08:23] okay you can't separate them as far as
[1:08:26] pull them apart and say all right we're
[1:08:28] going to put the soul over here we're
[1:08:30] going to put the spirit over here and
[1:08:32] the body here and we're going to analyze
[1:08:33] it
[1:08:34] no you're a unit
[1:08:37] without the soul you're dead without the
[1:08:40] spirit it has nothing to move with this
[1:08:42] has something to move but it's moved by
[1:08:44] my spirit
[1:08:45] if that spirit's not in here guess what
[1:08:49] you'll be saying boy he looks good
[1:08:55] piercing even
[1:08:57] look dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit
[1:08:59] and of the joints in Maryland listen the
[1:09:02] whole body can be discerned by the word
[1:09:04] of God
[1:09:05] joints marrow everything the whole body
[1:09:09] and is a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:09:12] intents of the heart
[1:09:16] we got to use that discernment though to
[1:09:18] figure out what what's false and what's
[1:09:20] true
[1:09:21] now look that's why that is unskillful
[1:09:24] the knowledge down here that we get at
[1:09:26] the new birth it is unskillful
[1:09:29] because it can be fooled
[1:09:32] the soul can't be fooled but the spirit
[1:09:35] can be fooled as a baby babies make
[1:09:39] mistakes all the time
[1:09:40] right
[1:09:42] you know what somebody said one time and
[1:09:44] I agree if you were to take my pretty
[1:09:46] little cat I'm gonna get tomorrow
[1:09:50] and you put that cat right here as a
[1:09:52] little bitty baby
[1:09:54] and it will not fall off of that
[1:09:58] it'll stay right there or it'll walk
[1:10:00] around this way you lay a baby right
[1:10:01] there
[1:10:04] it moves it's gonna fall
[1:10:07] what does that mean
[1:10:09] cats are more intelligent than humans
[1:10:14] but you see what happens though we
[1:10:18] that's what I'm trying to say God
[1:10:19] protects nature it does it he protects
[1:10:22] nature because they don't have a soul
[1:10:24] but with a soul there's a decision made
[1:10:27] and we are the consequence of that
[1:10:29] decision
[1:10:30] all right even there shall be false
[1:10:32] teachers among you
[1:10:34] who privately shall bring in damnable
[1:10:37] heresies we see that in the message
[1:10:39] already even denying the Lord that
[1:10:41] bought them and bringing them upon
[1:10:44] themselves Swift
[1:10:46] destruction
[1:10:48] and many shall follow their pernicious
[1:10:51] prediction
[1:10:53] that's what that word is pernicious
[1:10:56] ways or wrong ways by reason of whom the
[1:10:59] way of Truth look even the way of truth
[1:11:02] will be evil spoken of
[1:11:04] they're bashing this message like crazy
[1:11:07] truth the very true their passion
[1:11:10] they're saying this
[1:11:13] listen there's no need to fighting them
[1:11:15] they're going to get their due
[1:11:18] right let's move on
[1:11:20] keep going quit looking back if a
[1:11:23] soldier Falls he falls right
[1:11:25] if he dies you got to leave him there
[1:11:28] if he's wounded pick him up and help him
[1:11:30] but if not you got to go forward we got
[1:11:33] to move forward we can't turn around and
[1:11:34] go back we don't been too far to turn
[1:11:37] back now I love that song gone too far
[1:11:40] turn back now Hebrews 5 11 says of whom
[1:11:42] we have many things to say and hard to
[1:11:44] be uttered seeing that you're a dull of
[1:11:46] hearing
[1:11:47] now listen
[1:11:49] that's slothful
[1:11:52] slow
[1:11:53] sluggish
[1:11:55] into let and languid
[1:12:01] in other words
[1:12:03] behind
[1:12:06] but now that don't mean dull of hearing
[1:12:08] because I'm getting hard of hearing I
[1:12:09] can't hardly hear the alarm clock go off
[1:12:11] in this ear oh I mean it goes off all
[1:12:14] the time it's not the real alarm clock
[1:12:17] well no they only had that problem
[1:12:18] before
[1:12:20] you never had a ringing in your ear and
[1:12:22] go somebody said answer that
[1:12:24] oh wait well okay never mind then we all
[1:12:27] pray for me
[1:12:28] I got to go to the doctor about it but
[1:12:30] that's not Dull of hearing that way it's
[1:12:32] dull of hearing because you sit here and
[1:12:34] you die the word of God's preached to
[1:12:36] you and you let it go right through you
[1:12:38] and out the back door
[1:12:39] you don't listen to what the preacher's
[1:12:41] saying you have your own preconceived
[1:12:44] idea and it just goes right on through
[1:12:48] but when for the time you ought to be
[1:12:51] teachers
[1:12:53] you have need that one teach you again
[1:12:57] which be the first principles of the
[1:12:59] Oracles of God what the Ten Commandments
[1:13:02] that was the first principle of the
[1:13:03] Oracle of God think the Ten Commandments
[1:13:07] and I become such as what have need of
[1:13:09] milk and not of strong me
[1:13:11] that's where we get to Holy Ghost
[1:13:12] knowledge that's why that knowledge is
[1:13:14] not down here that knowledge is on up
[1:13:16] above that
[1:13:17] where we don't have to listen
[1:13:21] excuse me the the church at Ephesus 12
[1:13:25] people they all had the Holy Ghost and
[1:13:28] they all were taught by Paul
[1:13:29] so I would say they all had the virtues
[1:13:31] working in their life because that's the
[1:13:34] faith of the fathers and Paul was part
[1:13:36] of the father is everybody with me so he
[1:13:38] taught them and they were a powerful
[1:13:40] Church 12 people they didn't just have
[1:13:42] the Holy Ghost
[1:13:45] they had the Holy Ghost Plus
[1:13:47] they had the Holy Ghost plus they were
[1:13:49] Top by profit
[1:13:52] me and you
[1:13:54] we're supposed to go back to that that's
[1:13:56] the only time we go back I believe it
[1:13:58] comes and gets us
[1:14:00] hey man everybody all right sorry
[1:14:04] but having a form of godliness but
[1:14:06] denying the power of thereof that's
[1:14:07] what's happened to people in the message
[1:14:08] now you see people being a message 30
[1:14:10] and 40 years they're denying the message
[1:14:12] what they had a form of godliness
[1:14:14] but they're denying the power that's
[1:14:16] behind the message
[1:14:18] ask the Bible
[1:14:20] but denying the power that look from
[1:14:23] such turn away
[1:14:28] for this sort are they which creep into
[1:14:31] houses yours
[1:14:33] leading captive silly churches Laden
[1:14:37] with sins LED away with many lust ever
[1:14:40] learning
[1:14:42] and never able to come to the knowledge
[1:14:45] of the truth
[1:14:47] Hebrews 10 verse 23 he said let us hold
[1:14:49] fast the profession of what our faith
[1:14:51] without wavering
[1:14:54] for he is faithful that promised and let
[1:14:57] us consider one another to provoke unto
[1:14:59] love and good works
[1:15:01] not forsaken them who put that in there
[1:15:04] again not forsaken they're sending of
[1:15:06] ourselves together as a matter of some
[1:15:08] is but exhorting one another and so much
[1:15:11] the more as you see the day approaching
[1:15:12] you know you see people and and I you
[1:15:15] know I I harp on this a lot
[1:15:18] but you see people that struggle
[1:15:21] if they would just put one more piece of
[1:15:24] that puzzle together
[1:15:27] come to church
[1:15:30] I mean who would not where would you
[1:15:32] like to have been last Sunday morning
[1:15:38] where would you have liked to have been
[1:15:39] last Sunday morning
[1:15:42] you think about it ball game Walmart
[1:15:45] Heavenly days
[1:15:49] I wouldn't even want to be at your house
[1:15:52] because I'd be alone I hope you were
[1:15:54] here
[1:15:57] but the assembling ourselves together
[1:15:58] listen there is no way that we can make
[1:16:02] it without each other
[1:16:04] not a one-man show
[1:16:06] we had one man Jesus Christ but you know
[1:16:08] what he did first you know what the
[1:16:10] first thing Jesus did he divided himself
[1:16:13] he divided himself I'm coming back in
[1:16:15] you and you and you and you and you
[1:16:19] I'm going to divide myself then we're
[1:16:21] going to fight the devil with everything
[1:16:23] we got
[1:16:25] for if we sin willfully
[1:16:27] after receiving the knowledge of the
[1:16:30] truth
[1:16:31] there remains no more there is not a
[1:16:33] sacrifice for that
[1:16:35] there's a sacrifice for ignorance
[1:16:38] there's a sacrifice for sin
[1:16:40] there's a sacrifice for adultery
[1:16:43] come on somebody there's a sacrifice for
[1:16:45] all that but not that
[1:16:47] if you sin willfully after you've
[1:16:50] received the knowledge of the truth
[1:16:52] there is no sacrifice that can cover
[1:16:54] your sin man I'm just reading the Bible
[1:16:58] I'm not condemning anybody but if you
[1:17:00] don't listen to the word of God if you
[1:17:01] don't do what the word of God says
[1:17:02] you're condemning yourself already
[1:17:03] that's what the Bible says right
[1:17:06] now remember this
[1:17:08] here's the quote here we'll read this
[1:17:10] and then we'll stop musicians get ready
[1:17:12] to come up now remember this
[1:17:14] true church now look truth
[1:17:17] truth there's been bribes
[1:17:19] bride kind of all kind of Rights all
[1:17:21] kind of churches that's a quote from
[1:17:22] Brother brown right
[1:17:24] well he said they'll come one
[1:17:26] so Christ in the true church is a
[1:17:28] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[1:17:31] Book of Revelation shows how let that
[1:17:33] Antichrist Spirit would come into that
[1:17:35] church and defile it make it lukewarm
[1:17:39] formal and Powerless
[1:17:43] it exposes Satan
[1:17:46] revealing his words the attempted
[1:17:48] destruction of God's people and the
[1:17:50] discrediting of God's word right down to
[1:17:53] the time he is cast into the Lake of
[1:17:55] Fire
[1:17:56] he fights that he cannot stand it he
[1:17:59] knows that if the people get the true
[1:18:01] revelation of the true church
[1:18:04] not bad it's not Pentecostal not
[1:18:05] methodists not brandonism
[1:18:08] we're the True Church of God
[1:18:11] the bride look and and what she stands
[1:18:14] for who she is
[1:18:17] I'm sorry true revelation of the true
[1:18:19] church and what she is
[1:18:22] she's the bride
[1:18:24] and what she stands for
[1:18:26] we stand for the word nothing else
[1:18:28] and that she can do the Greater Works
[1:18:30] she will be an invincible Army if they
[1:18:34] get a true Revelation how many times
[1:18:35] they gonna have to say true if they get
[1:18:37] a true revelation of the two Spirits
[1:18:39] within the framework of the message
[1:18:41] Church
[1:18:43] man and by God's spirit
[1:18:47] discern
[1:18:49] what is discernment dividing separating
[1:18:53] amen
[1:18:54] that's why the Bible says that in the
[1:18:56] congregation at the end time that a
[1:18:58] sinner won't be able to sit in the
[1:18:59] congregation the righteous why because
[1:19:01] there's a dividing time there's a time
[1:19:03] that you don't come in here
[1:19:04] because you won't there's there won't be
[1:19:06] anything in you to want to come here
[1:19:10] well praise God
[1:19:12] I mean that's what it is you don't have
[1:19:14] a want to inside of you you've sealed
[1:19:16] yourself away you've sealed your doom
[1:19:20] please don't do that keep yourself open
[1:19:23] for revelation
[1:19:26] and by God's spirit Discerning withstand
[1:19:28] the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[1:19:30] powerless before her he will then be as
[1:19:33] definitely thwarted today as when Christ
[1:19:34] withstood his every effort to gain power
[1:19:37] over him in the desert what did he use
[1:19:39] Divine Healing discernment no he quoted
[1:19:43] the word
[1:19:45] Satan hates Revelation he hates for you
[1:19:48] to know more about God
[1:19:49] you know why because you'll know more
[1:19:51] about God than he does praise God
[1:19:53] but we love it and with true Revelation
[1:19:55] in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot
[1:19:58] Prevail against us but we will prevail
[1:20:01] over them
[1:20:05] that's where your standard will be
[1:20:07] raised up where's that standard it's
[1:20:09] inside your body
[1:20:10] that when that cortisol of sin is
[1:20:12] released there's something to suppress
[1:20:14] it
[1:20:15] it's the word of God
[1:20:20] then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be like
[1:20:22] ten virgins
[1:20:23] which took their lamps and went forth to
[1:20:25] meet the bridegroom
[1:20:27] five were wise
[1:20:29] five were foolish
[1:20:31] now that word wise means prudent mindful
[1:20:35] of one's interest they were mindful that
[1:20:38] they needed to hang on to that lamp
[1:20:42] and to make sure they got the Holy Ghost
[1:20:46] and that they
[1:20:50] trimmed
[1:20:52] their lamp
[1:20:55] because you get to all down here
[1:20:58] but you trim
[1:21:00] your lamp
[1:21:02] have you ever used one of those I know
[1:21:03] some of the kids will just look at you
[1:21:05] crop side but they call them hurricane
[1:21:06] lamps we still have them in case the
[1:21:08] power goes out if you live in
[1:21:09] guildsville Georgia you need something
[1:21:10] you know the power's gonna go out two or
[1:21:12] three times
[1:21:13] used to be a month now it's a year
[1:21:15] but hurricane lamps they're they're just
[1:21:17] they're so nice they'll like to place up
[1:21:19] Dad had to live under those kerosene
[1:21:21] lamps because they didn't have a power
[1:21:23] but when the power goes out guess what
[1:21:25] we don't have any either
[1:21:26] so you take that thing and right at the
[1:21:28] very end of that Wick if it's all black
[1:21:31] and gummed up yeah you'll get a fire
[1:21:34] but it'll be like
[1:21:37] and it'll get black all inside of your
[1:21:39] all inside of your little lamp thing
[1:21:41] your little glass thing but if you'll
[1:21:43] take that thing and run it up real quick
[1:21:45] trim that off
[1:21:49] roll it back down like that baby it'll
[1:21:52] give you the prettiest light it won't
[1:21:54] flicker
[1:21:55] it won't make that all Gummy up inside
[1:21:58] somebody getting what I'm saying thank
[1:22:00] you
[1:22:01] father of them were wise and five were
[1:22:03] foolish they wise was prudent mindful of
[1:22:06] one interest I want you to look at this
[1:22:08] word foolish
[1:22:10] that's where we get the word from
[1:22:15] Morris
[1:22:20] look what it means
[1:22:22] impious
[1:22:24] not showing respect or reverence
[1:22:29] you better reference every gift
[1:22:31] you better reverence have a gift that
[1:22:33] God give a person
[1:22:34] whether he'd be a little preacher or a
[1:22:36] big preacher a little Deacon or a big
[1:22:39] deacon if God's put you in that place
[1:22:42] you better show respect and reverence
[1:22:45] because touch's not mine anointed
[1:22:47] and do my prophets no harm
[1:22:51] not showing respect or reverence
[1:22:54] Godless
[1:22:58] they were virgins they were foolish
[1:23:01] they had lamps
[1:23:05] but they didn't get any oil
[1:23:08] they were Godless
[1:23:09] they were without the Holy Ghost
[1:23:11] because that's what all means the Holy
[1:23:13] Ghost right
[1:23:14] let's read this real quick musicians
[1:23:16] come on everybody's stand we'll get out
[1:23:17] of here it's 8 35. they
[1:23:25] were sitting here well praise God but
[1:23:27] don't tell me what to do
[1:23:30] don't tell me I got a River's headship
[1:23:32] no no I ain't doing it well guess what
[1:23:35] you're a foolish virgin
[1:23:37] took their lamps and took no oil with
[1:23:39] them but the wise took oil in their
[1:23:43] vessels with their lamps
[1:23:49] they took oil in their vessels
[1:23:53] and their lamps
[1:23:55] with their lamps while the bridegroom
[1:23:58] carried they all slumbered and slept so
[1:24:00] they all did
[1:24:03] and at midnight there was a cry made
[1:24:05] behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out
[1:24:08] to meet him
[1:24:09] then all those virgins listen all 10 got
[1:24:12] up
[1:24:14] hello all 10 woke up
[1:24:17] and all those versions are rose and
[1:24:20] trimmed their lamps
[1:24:22] but if you try to get these virtues
[1:24:24] without the Holy Ghost what brother
[1:24:26] Brown said a stumbling block
[1:24:29] power without character
[1:24:33] and the foolish said unto the wise at
[1:24:35] least they knew where to go to get it
[1:24:37] that's why they're going to come to you
[1:24:39] one day and say let me in that Ark and
[1:24:42] you're going to say man you've goofed
[1:24:44] around for 30 40 years you've had the
[1:24:47] same opportunity I've had you go get
[1:24:49] your own
[1:24:50] that sounds harsh but that's what the
[1:24:51] Bible says
[1:24:53] and the foolish said unto the wise give
[1:24:55] us of your oil for our lamps are gone
[1:24:57] out in other words they had a little bit
[1:24:59] of the Holy Ghost on their spirit
[1:25:02] because if it had holy ghost in their
[1:25:04] soul they'd be born again
[1:25:06] but to add a little holy ghost on their
[1:25:07] spirit
[1:25:09] for our laps are gone out
[1:25:11] but the wise answer said not so
[1:25:15] you've been taught
[1:25:16] you've heard the message
[1:25:19] lest there be not enough for us and you
[1:25:22] in other words there's not enough time
[1:25:23] for us to go over all this again to get
[1:25:26] your lamps full but you go rather to
[1:25:29] them that sell and buy for yourself and
[1:25:32] while they went to buy the bridegroom
[1:25:34] came and they that were ready went in
[1:25:36] with him to the marriage and the what
[1:25:38] the door was shut
[1:25:40] afterwards came also the other virgin
[1:25:42] said Lord Lord open to us in other words
[1:25:44] they knew even where the Lord was
[1:25:49] and we were in there with him
[1:25:51] but the door was closed
[1:25:56] but he answered and said verily I say
[1:25:58] unto you
[1:26:00] I know there's that word again
[1:26:03] I have not had an intimate relationship
[1:26:05] with you
[1:26:06] even though you're a foolish virgin even
[1:26:08] though you're going to have a place in
[1:26:10] heaven you're not my bride
[1:26:12] you didn't do what I said you didn't get
[1:26:14] ready when I told you to get ready
[1:26:17] but I know you not watched therefore for
[1:26:19] you know neither the day nor the hour or
[1:26:22] in the son of man
[1:26:24] cometh
[1:26:30] talk about wisdom let me get right down
[1:26:32] here to the bottom and we'll close
[1:26:34] we'll read it later on but
[1:26:38] brother Brown says fourthly the next
[1:26:40] thing we're coming to which will be
[1:26:41] Sunday morning will be temperance
[1:26:45] okay
[1:26:46] Temperance at Temperance oh my we've
[1:26:49] come to Temperance now you've got faith
[1:26:51] first you have to have that to begin
[1:26:52] with then you add virtue of what
[1:26:54] strength to your faith
[1:26:56] hey fished a rock kind of virtue then
[1:26:58] you add knowledge if it's the right kind
[1:27:00] of knowledge which is what Holy Ghost
[1:27:02] knowledge now you're going to add
[1:27:04] Temperance Temperance doesn't mean stop
[1:27:05] drinking alcohol
[1:27:07] no no Temperance doesn't mean alcoholic
[1:27:09] cure not in this case this is Bible
[1:27:11] Temperance Holy Spirit temperance
[1:27:17] drinking and he said that's just one of
[1:27:19] the lusts of the flesh but we're talking
[1:27:20] about Holy Spirit Temperance that means
[1:27:22] how to control your tongue
[1:27:27] not be a toddler
[1:27:30] how to control your temper not fly off
[1:27:32] every time anybody speaks across to you
[1:27:34] oh my boy a lot of us going to fall off
[1:27:37] before we get started aren't we
[1:27:42] then we wonder why God is not in his
[1:27:45] church doing miracles
[1:27:47] that they used to do
[1:27:51] boy a lot of us is going to fall off
[1:27:54] before we get started now this is a
[1:27:56] prophet we like to quote them good
[1:27:57] quotes but what about these quotes
[1:27:59] aren't we then we wonder why God is not
[1:28:02] in his church doing Miracles and things

[1:31:37] sons
[1:31:38] that's going to be able to stand one day
[1:31:41] and thwart this
[1:31:43] toward Satan just like what brother man
[1:31:45] said when we what no know we know and
