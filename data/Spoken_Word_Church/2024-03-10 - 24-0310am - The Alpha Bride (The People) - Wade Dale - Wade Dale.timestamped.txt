[17:11] to cut it a little short we're going to
[17:12] have communion and foot washing uh this
[17:16] morning service because this afternoon
[17:19] we're going to come back at 2:00 and

[17:30] prophet said and what the Bible says
[17:31] about worship and then brother Joe
[17:33] Canada will take over and um we'll see
[17:37] how this goes I I'm just uh really
[17:40] impressed on on um us coming together
[17:43] and and worship uh it's not required
[17:46] that you be here but um you may miss a
[17:50] blessing if you're not so you just
[17:53] decide that all right this coming
[17:54] Saturday at 3:00 we know brother Andrew
[17:56] Glover going to be here remember
[17:58] remember that it's uh hot dog C June or
[18:01] Esther um I'm sorry sister June or
[18:05] sister
[18:06] Esther um about money if you and if
[18:09] you've given
[18:10] money uh you don't have to bring
[18:12] anything if you donated money you don't
[18:14] my wife wrote this you see this I can't
[18:17] read
[18:18] it I had to get somebody to help me if
[18:21] you want to contribute by bringing a
[18:23] dessert that would be
[18:26] fine that would be a appreciated by the
[18:29] kids which we all are kids and that'll
[18:31] be next Saturday 3:00 then we only have
[18:33] one service next Sunday brother Andrew
[18:36] Glover will be with us there I don't
[18:38] know if you've heard or not but you know
[18:39] we announced brother Ron Spencer had
[18:41] told that he uh if the cancer that he
[18:44] had in his eye was what it was he only
[18:45] had two months to live
[18:48] well there's a
[18:51] God if you had heard the testimony go to
[18:53] the go to the Believers testimony
[18:56] website it was
[19:02] misdiagnosed it's not even cancer at
[19:05] all it was misdiagnosed and one of the
[19:09] doctors is like I don't know why this
[19:11] was diagnosed this way it's just like
[19:13] you know a cataract or some little
[19:15] something in his eye and has nothing to
[19:17] do with cancer at all so uh
[19:20] listen we're fighting a defeated
[19:23] foe amen but the problem is what we do
[19:26] is when the Bible says resistance the
[19:28] devil and he'll flee from you we don't
[19:30] resist we
[19:33] assist sometimes we assist the devil
[19:36] well let's don't assist him let's resist
[19:39] him whatever he throws in our way he's
[19:41] already
[19:42] defeated he he's done for listen he's so
[19:46] he's such a deceiver he's deceived
[19:48] himself brother John in believing that
[19:50] he's going to make it through this so no
[19:53] listen to what Winston Churchill said he
[19:55] said Success is Not final
[19:59] failure is not
[20:01] fatal it's the courage to continue that
[20:05] counts it's the courage to continue that
[20:08] counts and we're going to move on we
[20:10] going to continue on as I say again I
[20:12] appreciate the the vot of confidence I
[20:14] know probably in my heart I know that it
[20:17] wasn't 100% last Sunday but that's all
[20:19] right those of you that don't like me
[20:22] then please try I'll try to help
[20:27] you
[20:29] I'm just pling this just me this is what
[20:30] you
[20:40] got but we love you with a love of the
[20:42] Lord don't thing I want to do I've
[20:44] always said before I walk out of that
[20:46] room right there I said God though I be
[20:48] a Castaway though you destroy this body
[20:51] though you take me out of the
[20:53] way bless your
[20:55] people I think that was my dad's vision
[20:58] was to see the people make it and then
[21:01] I'm going to carry that Vision on by
[21:02] God's grace and by your help we're going
[21:05] to carry that Vision on to the coming of
[21:07] the Lord um I believe that um that this
[21:11] was uh if we believe God Don't Make
[21:13] Mistakes then then then he's in all this
[21:16] all right so God don't make mistakes and
[21:18] and we
[21:20] do right Success is Not final failure is
[21:23] not fatal but it's the courage to
[21:25] continue so we're going to continue on
[21:27] with our head up not our head down we're
[21:29] going to continue that way uh there will
[21:31] be some um I want to meet with some of
[21:34] the um I call them the heads of state
[21:36] which is the department leaders and and
[21:38] and start working on some things but uh
[21:40] like I said before and like brother
[21:43] Aaron said Wednesday night I'm not my
[21:44] dad I'm not brother Dale I am brother
[21:47] Dale but I'm not that brother
[21:49] Dale and and there's some things that I
[21:52] don't want to change anything but there
[21:54] are some things that we like this
[21:55] afternoon work on a worship service so
[21:58] let's just remember these things coming
[21:59] up in prayer all the special meetings
[22:01] let's pray for them and that the Lord
[22:04] will lead us and guide us and that there
[22:06] will be not one person left in this
[22:10] congregation everybody make it like
[22:11] brother Bob said we we try not to we we
[22:14] try not to judge and we try not to be
[22:17] judgmental but sometimes the Bible comes
[22:19] in and and acts judgmental but the Bible
[22:22] says judge no one cuz listen God's the
[22:24] judge that's right but remember though
[22:26] you got to remember though that what the
[22:29] Saints will judge the Earth so he has
[22:32] committed that to us to and and and have
[22:36] parameters for us to have deacons and
[22:39] elders and pastors and song leaders so
[22:41] that we can the structure of the church
[22:43] can stay the same because listen we're
[22:45] all sheep like I said before we're hurt
[22:47] animals we need a Shepherd we need
[22:49] somebody to pull us together and when it
[22:51] gets pulled apart the wolf comes
[22:54] in Paul told us Grievous wolves would
[22:57] come in if we pull it apart brother Bri
[22:59] said stick together don't let that root
[23:01] of bitterness get in don't don't let
[23:03] some little idea or something maybe that
[23:06] if I say something to hurt your feelings
[23:07] I'm going to apologize already from now
[23:09] till we go out of the Rapture go in the
[23:10] Rapture okay so I don't have to ever
[23:12] apologize again because I'll be
[23:14] apologizing every service but I love you
[23:16] all you know that I hope you know that I
[23:18] love every one of you and I want I want
[23:20] us all to make it I don't disclude I
[23:23] include amen so let's let's get started
[23:26] real quick because I'm going to try to
[23:27] get finished by 7:30 we'll have
[23:28] communion and foot
[23:30] washing we love you like I said with the
[23:32] love of the Lord you just pray that God
[23:33] will have his
[23:35] will and not my will but thy will be
[23:38] done but we're going to talk a minute we
[23:41] may have to skip through this real fast
[23:43] on the people of Ephesus because the
[23:46] people of Ephesus is like the people
[23:49] standing in front of me today because
[23:51] there the alpha bride and the Omega
[23:54] bride Jesus says right here he says look
[23:56] I was in the spirit on the Lord's day
[23:58] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[23:59] a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega
[24:02] which Alpha is the first letter in the
[24:03] Greek alphabet Omega is the last the
[24:06] first and last and what thou seest write
[24:07] in a book and send it into the seven
[24:09] churches so we know that we're part of
[24:11] those seven churches because we're in
[24:13] Lea we're the last one there is not
[24:15] another one the Lord Jesus is coming you
[24:18] may have heard that sometime in your
[24:19] childhood but he will come one day and I
[24:23] believe that all the signs point toward
[24:25] real soon all right and I turned to see
[24:28] the voice that spake with me of being
[24:29] turned I saw seven golden candlesticks
[24:31] and in the midst of the seven
[24:32] candlesticks one likened to the son of
[24:34] man listen he never left us he went away
[24:37] to take his body into another dimension
[24:39] but he sent the Holy Spirit back the
[24:41] same person back to be inside of me and
[24:44] you and he's going to see this through
[24:49] he's got his hand in every bit of it
[24:51] he's not going to take his hand off he
[24:52] got his hand in every bit of it he loves
[24:54] his bride he loves his children right
[24:57] clothed with the Garment down to the
[24:59] foot and gir about the PS with a gold
[25:01] and girdle Revelations 1:16 he had in
[25:04] his right hand Seven Stars and out of
[25:06] his mouth when a sharp to wedge sword
[25:08] let's P our head just for a minute Lord
[25:10] thank you so much as we were watching
[25:12] that testimony Lord back in the office
[25:15] Lord of brother Ron and sister Connie
[25:18] what a trooper what a warrior of the
[25:21] faith somebody that we can look to as as
[25:24] you even gave us a man named job in the
[25:27] B
[25:28] I know job probably didn't want to go
[25:30] through all the things he went through
[25:31] but God put him through it for a purpose
[25:33] so that we can look at that man job and
[25:36] know Lord that you are the Redeemer he
[25:39] stood and said I know my redeemer liveth
[25:42] even all that that he went through
[25:44] losing everything he had but yet he
[25:47] stood true to his faith and father I
[25:50] pray that we do that we stand true to
[25:53] the word of God that we not differ from
[25:55] it that we not compromise with it it
[25:58] that we'll preach it and receive it Lord
[26:01] as you give it father be with the ones
[26:03] that are sick forgive us of our sins
[26:05] bless the ones that are in Foreign
[26:06] Fields Lord I heard from many of them
[26:08] this coming this past week and I pray
[26:10] that you'd bless each one Lord it brings
[26:12] back memories of being over there Lord I
[26:14] pray that you anoint them Father for the
[26:16] service that they do Lord just bless us
[26:18] in Jesus name amen God bless you you can
[26:21] be
[26:22] seated so the mystery of the Seven Stars
[26:25] is what God's got this thing in his hand
[26:27] he takes seven people now listen God's
[26:30] not the author of
[26:31] confusion God's not he everything is in
[26:36] order that's right so he's got seven men
[26:39] he brought seven Church ages he had
[26:41] Seven Cities and they all were a pattern
[26:46] of the Bride of Jesus Christ he said
[26:49] what thou sawest are the seven churches
[26:51] and what the stars in his hand is that
[26:53] God he rolled out number one he rolled
[26:55] out Paul irenius Martin Columba they
[26:58] just came straight from the logos which
[27:00] is God himself which is the speech of
[27:02] God he stood there and said I'm going to
[27:05] have seven Messengers and those seven
[27:07] Messengers are going to be the seven
[27:09] churches or church ages that have
[27:12] different characteristics but yet all
[27:14] one common goal and that's to go to
[27:17] heaven right and that was God's goal you
[27:20] know God listen the Bible
[27:23] says that hell was created for the devil
[27:25] and his angels
[27:29] hell wasn't created for
[27:32] humans but you'll decide to go there if
[27:35] you don't trust the word of the
[27:37] Lord cuz hell's real listen the devil's
[27:40] real hell's real don't let nobody tell
[27:42] you that not everybody that dies is
[27:44] going to heaven I'm sorry I that just
[27:47] the way it is but if you'll accept the
[27:49] Loving Grace of Jesus Christ you'll be
[27:52] there so the seven churches is a
[27:54] complete and final revelation of Jesus
[27:56] Christ to the Gentile Nations now we
[27:58] know that God's going to remove himself
[28:00] from the Gentiles go to the Jews and
[28:03] take 144,000 which I believe like you
[28:06] believe they're over there now some of
[28:08] them may be fighting over there now but
[28:09] they're going to be 144,000 and those
[28:12] two prophets are going to preach this
[28:14] message to that group of people and tell
[28:16] them they missed
[28:18] it you missed the Messiah and then God's
[28:22] going to what he's going to as he did
[28:24] Paul he's going to take the scales away
[28:25] from their eyes and they're going to see
[28:27] that and think man we've had it now oh
[28:31] we've had it we we killed him 2,000
[28:33] years ago and we've been looking for him
[28:35] and we already killed him and he's gone
[28:36] and come back and you know what go
[28:38] they're going to the two prophets are
[28:39] going to say hey that's okay it was done
[28:42] for a purpose it was done to get me and
[28:45] you to get a gentile bride out of the
[28:49] loins of God into manifestation so that
[28:53] you and I can be God manifested on Earth
[28:56] as a bride all right everybody with me
[28:58] on that so now this is the way it's
[29:00] going to happen and we'll run through
[29:01] this real quick there's an announcement
[29:04] in heaven all right out of the mind of
[29:06] God comes to logos in word in other
[29:08] words if it comes from God it's
[29:12] perfect never will fail never will fall
[29:15] on deaf ears if you'll listen he that
[29:18] have the ear let him hear you got two
[29:21] ears in one mouth it'd be nice for us to
[29:22] listen twice as much as we talk praise
[29:25] the Lord I'll raise my hand too brother
[29:27] Donnie
[29:28] but somebody's got to do
[29:29] it a sealed a sealed message is open so
[29:33] something that was in the mind of God
[29:35] that he had before the foundation of the
[29:37] world it opens up and he says okay I'm
[29:39] going to take this star I'm going to
[29:41] give him this certain message and I'm
[29:43] going to unfold that message to the star
[29:46] of that age which would be Apostle Paul
[29:49] for the first age that messenger picks
[29:52] up the logos of God listen the logos
[29:55] spoke to Paul on the road to Damascus
[29:57] cuz he said Saul Saul why are you
[30:00] persecuting
[30:01] me who's me me is Jesus Christ Paul knew
[30:05] he hadn't met Jesus Christ he just did
[30:10] yes but in a form called a bride is who
[30:13] was persecuting the Believers and that
[30:15] struck Paul I believe because he was a
[30:17] learning man he knew that the Messiah
[30:20] was coming but he just didn't think that
[30:22] was who that was well he had a
[30:24] conversion and maybe that's what me and
[30:26] you need we need a conversion
[30:28] we need a Damascus Road to get us
[30:29] knocked off of our high horse everybody
[30:32] with me today all right so a trumpet
[30:35] sounds in other words he gives it to
[30:38] Paul Paul just didn't
[30:43] say 30
[30:46] years no he began to speak and he spoke
[30:50] so
[30:52] positive he said you'll be judged by my
[30:55] gospel you'll be judged by by what I say
[30:58] because what it come from the mind of
[31:01] God same way in the end time we have a
[31:04] we have a an alpha which would be Paul
[31:06] and remember a lot of those sermons that
[31:09] people preached were never written down
[31:11] it was just given from ear to ear or or
[31:14] mouth to ear
[31:15] right but
[31:17] Paul 80% of
[31:20] his was the New Testament he wrote it
[31:23] down so that we could read it guess what
[31:27] we got a messenger over
[31:29] here that we got 1,00 sermons that were
[31:32] written down so that we can see what the
[31:36] Amplified version of what Paul was
[31:38] preaching not a different version come
[31:40] on somebody it's not different but the
[31:42] same thing Paul preached is what brother
[31:44] random preached and if Paul made it he's
[31:46] going to make it if Paul's people make
[31:48] it we're going to make
[31:53] it but listen to turn that messenger
[31:56] down though is death
[31:59] I'll read it to you in a minute so a
[32:00] trumpet sounds a message it's not a toot
[32:02] toot toot it's a message Paul goes down
[32:05] and starts preaching we'll see in a
[32:06] minute where he just he goes to the
[32:08] upper coast of Ephesus and he starts
[32:10] talking to the people and they catch a
[32:12] revelation and Buddy the Holy Ghost
[32:14] falls on 12 men and those 12 men tear
[32:18] that whole city
[32:19] apart give me 12 men and women
[32:22] today full of the Holy Ghost that's
[32:25] taught by Apostle Paul
[32:29] amen we'll tear this world
[32:31] apart so the church age begins it's a
[32:34] distinct in declared message is
[32:36] something that is for that age because
[32:38] each age listen God is so he's so
[32:42] mindful that we as humans can only take
[32:44] so
[32:47] much all right you can only take so much
[32:49] I was talking to somebody the other day
[32:50] you know you if you took somebody like
[32:53] say even Albert Einstein as great as he
[32:56] was he passed away like in the 50s or
[32:58] 60s early what if he was here now to see
[33:03] all this technology all what he done
[33:06] listen everything Albert Einstein done
[33:07] he done with a
[33:10] pencil or or uh chalkboard with chalk
[33:15] right now we got a
[33:17] computer that can store everything he
[33:19] said in your watch right bring him here
[33:23] and he would be so astounded till he
[33:25] probably would say oh that's not real or
[33:28] that's not no he was born in this age to
[33:31] where that had to be you and I were born
[33:33] in this age to where we're supposed to
[33:35] be we're supposed to be in this age CU
[33:37] you're sitting here today amen all right
[33:39] and we're a chosen group of people God
[33:41] before the foundation of the world saw
[33:43] you'd be sitting here
[33:44] today so you're going to hear a distinct
[33:47] and declared message today that not the
[33:49] world gets not even the denomination not
[33:52] even the the world Cosmos the world the
[33:54] seven billion now it's 8 billion people
[33:58] will never hear this
[34:00] gospel millions billions of them will
[34:02] never hear what you
[34:04] hear but what are you going to do about
[34:06] it so remember though when when that
[34:09] opposition comes or when Paul comes and
[34:12] brings his message immediately Satan
[34:14] comes and brings
[34:16] opposition it's always that way when
[34:19] when God put Adam and Eve in the garden
[34:21] of Ed and said here hey you you got this
[34:23] whole thing Adam you're the controller
[34:25] I'm going to leave you alone I'm going
[34:26] over here
[34:27] I I'm going to rule the universe you you
[34:29] just take care of this ball called Earth
[34:32] all right well we know what happened
[34:33] Satan dropped right straight down into
[34:35] Eden and did what he did with Eve give
[34:38] her a false Doctrine and that's what
[34:40] started this whole junk that we're
[34:41] dealing with right now
[34:43] amen born in sin shapen in iniquity
[34:46] spouse of my mother's womb of liar we
[34:48] needed a transformation we needed a
[34:51] knocking off of our horse we needed a
[34:53] scale off of our eyes and somebody lay
[34:56] our hands their hands on us to receive
[34:58] the Holy Ghost like just like Paul did
[35:01] so it starts a spiritual war the true
[35:02] word of God versus false Doctrine Paul
[35:05] even tells he said Grievous wolves I'll
[35:07] read it in a minute Grievous wolves will
[35:08] come in all these things are going to
[35:10] happen and and like brother R says he
[35:12] said the seeds of of error started in
[35:15] the first church age right the seeds of
[35:18] deception started in the first church
[35:19] age that vine started growing in that
[35:22] church age and it intertwined through
[35:25] all the other Church ages to where you
[35:27] and I are over here where where Jesus
[35:29] said hey let it alone he's talking about
[35:32] me and you he said let it alone let it
[35:35] grow amen cuz you may cut something down
[35:39] that's good Let It mature praise the
[35:42] Lord let it mature and when it grows up
[35:45] you'll see the two Vines you'll see the
[35:47] True Vine and the false Vine but they're
[35:49] going to be so close till they deceive
[35:52] the very elect if it possible but if
[35:54] you're an elect you can't be deceived
[36:00] I said if you're the
[36:01] elect so then Paul brought his message
[36:04] they cut his poor head off they laid him
[36:07] away he was taken off the Earth but the
[36:09] message continued through the preachers
[36:12] and fivefold Ministry of the of the
[36:14] beginning because that's where it all
[36:15] started he gave some apostles who was
[36:18] saying that Paul right that's Ephesus or
[36:22] Ephesians so The Messengers laid away
[36:24] then what does God do he brings another
[36:25] one but he br BRS that you accept it or
[36:28] reject it it brings a judgment on the
[36:30] people or a plague as we were talking
[36:31] about last week where now that we see
[36:34] that you you know you go to some of
[36:36] these places and and they're just
[36:38] spiritually
[36:40] dead right but let's wonder about
[36:43] ourself now let's be spiritually alive
[36:46] right here don't worry about being
[36:47] spiritually dead out there let's worry
[36:50] about it being here because remember the
[36:52] seed of Satan we're going to look at in
[36:54] the church the seed of Satan came in so
[36:57] close he wants you to worship him in
[37:00] this building right here that's right he
[37:04] don't want you to Worship in the
[37:05] barrooms or in the prostitute no he
[37:07] wants you to worship you right here
[37:09] worship him right here as God CU that's
[37:11] a great deception but you and I will not
[37:14] be deceived if you are elect if you are
[37:17] bride if you'll listen get the baptism
[37:19] of the Holy Ghost know that you got
[37:23] it so it's spiritual death to the ones
[37:25] who reject their message
[37:27] then the next stage it's the same
[37:28] identical pattern there's an
[37:30] announcement in heaven here come irenius
[37:32] he didn't have a different message in
[37:34] Paul but he did have a little more to it
[37:36] than Paul did but you didn't see irenius
[37:39] didn't write his down and then Martin
[37:41] and Columba Luther we have Luther's
[37:44] writings see they started writing again
[37:46] we have Wesley's in the age of man and
[37:48] then now you've got uh Pentecost and
[37:50] then you've got the age that we living
[37:52] in now and Lord of Mercy we've got more
[37:54] information now than
[37:57] anybody ever
[37:59] had I mean y'all know as well as I do I
[38:02] was looking the other day with talking
[38:03] about plants and what does the plant do
[38:05] and what there's an app on your phone
[38:09] now don't look at me and
[38:12] smile like I'm a
[38:15] dummy cuz I am you said
[38:18] right okay yeah I'm just kidding but you
[38:23] take your phone and you put it up
[38:24] against the the plant it don't only just
[38:27] tell you what it is it tells you how to
[38:30] put fertilizer and what it
[38:32] needs from an app and Bob can create any
[38:36] kind of picture he wants to create with
[38:38] artificial
[38:45] intelligence I think some of us may have
[38:47] that every once in a while a little bit
[38:49] of artificial
[38:51] intelligence but I've always said I
[38:53] don't care how smart they get with the
[38:56] computer somebody's got to press the
[38:58] button and put the information in all
[39:01] right so it's all begins with man and
[39:03] ends with man man's got so smart till
[39:06] they're trying to listen you know what
[39:08] they're doing with AI they're creating a
[39:09] perfect
[39:10] world they're taking all the
[39:12] imperfections out that's why they
[39:14] photoshop things you look at some of
[39:16] these girls on the Photoshop and you say
[39:18] man this lady's beautiful and you see in
[39:20] real life you go
[39:22] whoa well that's what it's artificial
[39:26] you sisters are
[39:27] beautiful you don't have to hide behind
[39:30] AI you don't have to hide behind Pain
[39:32] you don't have to hide behind
[39:35] anything and we'll look at that maybe in
[39:37] a
[39:37] minute cuz listen we can't understand
[39:39] the love of
[39:41] God you go through persecution every
[39:44] Church age goes through persecution but
[39:46] in this age you know back when Paul was
[39:49] alive and back in the first church age
[39:51] all the sisters wore
[39:55] dresses they cut their hair they didn't
[39:58] wear makeup they didn't have a and
[40:01] listen I work for the post office if any
[40:03] of y'all buy from
[40:05] Ulta you know what that is it's a demon
[40:08] that's what it's called Ulta it's Ultra
[40:11] demon cuz we deliver them things all
[40:13] over the place but I'm just joking but
[40:15] you got all that stuff and brother Brown
[40:17] called it Max Factor but Paul didn't
[40:19] have to deal with that he dealt with
[40:22] other things sure there was other demons
[40:23] but look at us now over here where we're
[40:25] going to be listen they were persecuted
[40:27] unto
[40:29] death it meant death for them to come
[40:32] into a church and sit down physical
[40:38] death and some of them were
[40:41] killed taken into the into the Arenas
[40:44] and just like just like us watching a
[40:45] football game they put humans in there
[40:48] with lines and they said whoever wins
[40:50] gets the
[40:52] prize just because they were Christians
[40:55] not because they were murderers
[40:57] and hor mongers no they were Christians
[40:59] and just to be called a Christian just
[41:01] sitting in a just sitting in a
[41:03] room you could be you could be killed
[41:06] but now see look Satan's got smarter and
[41:08] so has man I hope where there's laws now
[41:12] I was kind of mulling over that this
[41:13] morning there's laws now that they call
[41:16] what that's human rights so we have
[41:19] human rights over here now they' give
[41:21] now they' give dogs and cats more rights
[41:23] than we do but human rights yeah
[41:26] well hey you can kill a baby but you
[41:28] can't kill a
[41:29] cat come on
[41:33] somebody I'm going to but you come over
[41:37] here and you see now that they don't
[41:39] kill you spirit I mean U human humanly
[41:43] they kill you
[41:44] spiritually spiritual death is hit the
[41:47] church not the bride listen spiritual
[41:50] death never will hit the bride she's
[41:52] alive she's a million wire alive she's
[41:56] never going to be defeated never going
[41:58] to fall away from this thing listen the
[42:00] great falling away is not the bride
[42:03] that's
[42:05] right praise the
[42:07] Lord that we have
[42:10] Revelation so there was an age of
[42:12] Pentecost and we'll run through this
[42:13] real quick cuz I want to get to u to the
[42:16] people of the age so there was an age of
[42:18] Pentecost the messenger was the Holy
[42:20] Ghost on the day of Pentecost there was
[42:22] 120 in the upper room and they got the
[42:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost and they went
[42:25] out and they spread the gospel they
[42:27] listen they were
[42:29] not scared anymore amen you know what
[42:34] they were not they were
[42:37] believers they became believers they
[42:39] believed what happened on that day of
[42:40] Pentecost do you believe what happened
[42:42] cuz every one of you sitting in here
[42:43] today is going to have a day of
[42:45] Pentecost or
[42:47] not you got a day of Pentecost where the
[42:49] Holy Ghost is going to come not on you
[42:51] but in you and it's going to cause you
[42:53] to act funny on amen amen
[42:57] the world thinks we're crazy praise
[43:01] God listen the world's being run by
[43:03] crazy
[43:04] people like brother Ernie Bill W said he
[43:07] said the insane asylum is being rued by
[43:09] the
[43:11] insane
[43:12] man so anyway so the age of Pentecost we
[43:15] had a messenger the Holy Ghost you'll
[43:17] see on the day of Pentecost then we had
[43:19] in 1906 zza Street we had the same cuz
[43:21] it's the pattern we had the same pattern
[43:23] all right holy ghost fell on the day of
[43:25] Pentecost Peter was a spokesperson Paul
[43:27] had not come on the scene yet Paul was
[43:30] born but Paul wasn't he was the church
[43:32] agent messenger not Peter so Paul comes
[43:34] on the scene ad50 somewhere in there
[43:36] when they set the church up in Ephesus
[43:39] we'll read that in just a
[43:40] minute so in
[43:43] 1906 that the Pentecostals came in over
[43:46] here with the restoration of the gifts
[43:50] that's why brother rown said there was
[43:51] no Messenger to that age either because
[43:53] the Holy Ghost fell on a group of
[43:56] Believers the oneeyed black men param
[43:58] and um never can remember that Seymour
[44:01] daddy Seymour daddy Seymour and param
[44:04] they the Holy Ghost fell on them they
[44:05] started a Revival in the zoos of
[44:07] California and it spread all over the
[44:09] world the gifts were being restored the
[44:11] Holy Ghost was back into the
[44:13] people so the Holy Ghost come himself
[44:16] but then at the end of that age somebody
[44:19] came on a scene in 1947 called Elijah
[44:21] the Malachi 4 that we believe that
[44:23] brother William brandham is the Elijah 4
[44:26] it's not a spirit it's a person listen
[44:29] if the first Elijah was a
[44:31] person the second Elijah was a person
[44:34] the third Elijah was a
[44:36] person that's what John said come Spirit
[44:39] and the power of
[44:41] Elias brother brandham was not a spirit
[44:43] he was a person and there's two prophets
[44:46] going to Israel to be the fifth coming
[44:48] of Elijah and it's going to be a person
[44:51] so it's not a spirit it's a
[44:53] person and we believe that he fits all
[44:55] the characteristics I was talking to
[44:57] brother Claud wer you know everybody's
[44:58] saying brother R's this and this and
[45:00] this I'm like him find me a messenger
[45:04] cuz we got to have one before the great
[45:06] and dead Dreadful day of the Lord
[45:08] there's somebody come on the scene and
[45:09] got to turn us back but
[45:13] remember you and I
[45:15] realize we've had
[45:17] it and we're still under it now this is
[45:21] the message of the
[45:22] hour but at the end time as it always
[45:25] come up we find the messenger is sent
[45:28] and all the Scruples and things are
[45:29] placed in their place then the Rapture
[45:31] comes for the church there is no other
[45:33] Church age this is it leosa is the end
[45:36] there's not another church age coming
[45:38] there's not another people to rise up
[45:40] there's not another there might be
[45:41] another million denominations rise up
[45:43] but there will be another not be another
[45:45] bride rise up this bride's going to go
[45:49] up anybody with me so we see all that
[45:52] that went on and then he even God tells
[45:55] him said look you've lost your first
[45:56] love I mean right at the beginning at
[45:58] Pentecost they lost their first love by
[46:00] the time Paul comes on the scene he
[46:02] looks and he says Grievious wolves have
[46:04] crept into the
[46:06] church brother Bri comes over here and
[46:08] he looks at Pentecostal he said you had
[46:11] it you had it but you tooted it out the
[46:14] whistle you said the gifts is it and
[46:17] stopped God said the gifts is it and
[46:19] moved
[46:20] on cu the gift speaking in tongues is
[46:22] not the Holy
[46:24] Ghost right
[46:26] it's a gift right and gifts and callings
[46:29] are without repentance but all those
[46:31] other ones of wisdom and all the
[46:32] different things that comes into the
[46:34] church to keep it clean but there's one
[46:37] thing they did they hated the Deeds of
[46:39] the
[46:40] nicians which I also hating yes I want
[46:43] to give you something today if you don't
[46:45] know it God
[46:47] hates right y he hates he hates sin he
[46:52] hates this right here so you know what
[46:54] yeah God's a good loving God yes he is
[46:55] is but he's also a just
[46:58] God he said right here he's the one that
[47:00] wrote this this is not listen this is
[47:02] Jesus talking to to John everybody with
[47:05] me this is not a filter in between this
[47:07] is Jesus talking to John that's red
[47:09] letter in your Bible because the writers
[47:11] of the Bible know that Jesus came to
[47:14] John and said write this John and send
[47:16] it to the churches right so if he said
[47:19] this I hate God hates he hates the deed
[47:22] of the nicians which we know that is
[47:24] Conquering the Ley taking everything out
[47:26] of the Le's hands and putting it all on
[47:28] one person which would be a pope or a
[47:30] viker orever how you want to say that
[47:33] and down through the church ages it got
[47:34] worse and worse and worse right brother
[47:36] R said right here the Holy Ghost was
[47:37] against a certain thing that got started
[47:39] in that church age and it was the deed
[47:40] of the nians remember niik means to
[47:43] conquer that's where you get the word
[47:45] Nike from your shoes leoty means the
[47:48] church so nickan is to conquer the Ley
[47:51] took the Holy Spirit out of the church
[47:52] and give it to one man let them be the
[47:55] boss of all I was talking to a lady
[47:57] yesterday at work and she's a Catholic
[47:59] she's born Catholic she said she was 30
[48:02] something years old I guess K's about 30
[48:04] 31 32 she said we went to church but we
[48:08] didn't understand
[48:09] nothing it was all in
[48:11] Latin All in Latin she said we
[48:13] understood we just knew we needed to go
[48:15] take the Eucharist and and you know the
[48:18] uh give you the thing and we drink the
[48:20] the priest drink the wine and you go on
[48:21] out and just live like the devil all you
[48:22] want to right and the priest will be
[48:26] your
[48:28] intercessor there's only one
[48:31] intercessor there's only one man to take
[48:34] away your sins and it ain't called a
[48:35] priest it's called a high priest of our
[48:39] confession which is Jesus Christ the
[48:42] same yesterday today and forever not
[48:45] some Pope that's the Antichrist all
[48:49] right so look Acts 2 verse1 says on the
[48:51] day of Pentecost when it was fully come
[48:53] they were in one Accord as brother
[48:54] Bible's talking about today let's make
[48:56] sure we stay in one Accord if we get in
[48:58] one Accord the power will be back in the
[48:59] church the signs and the wonders if you
[49:01] want to see all that let's all get
[49:03] one let's all get together and have one
[49:06] common goal and that's to get out of
[49:08] here so we know there came a sound from
[49:10] heaven and there was many people there
[49:12] and they received the Holy Ghost and
[49:14] look what they did they they I want to
[49:16] see this right here when they prayed the
[49:18] place was shook where they were
[49:21] assembled the power of God shook it was
[49:23] a rumble went across they knew that God
[49:25] was on the
[49:27] scene and they were all filled with the
[49:29] Holy Ghost and spake the word of God
[49:30] with
[49:31] boldness not
[49:33] scared listen if you become a Believer
[49:38] half your Journey's
[49:40] over if you become a Believer half of it
[49:43] is over if you're not a Believer you'll
[49:45] never get there that's right but if you
[49:47] become a Believer that's half the
[49:49] journey everybody with
[49:52] me multitude with one heart one soul
[49:57] neither said any of them that ought of
[49:59] the things which he possessed was his
[50:01] own they had all things common and with
[50:04] great power gave the apostles witness of
[50:06] the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and
[50:08] great grace was upon them
[50:10] all that's your first church age all
[50:13] right that's your that's your people of
[50:15] the first church age so we're going to
[50:16] read a little bit more now we'll we'll
[50:18] study this a little bit later so Paul
[50:21] comes at the end of the age remember he
[50:22] comes at the end of what a Pentecostal
[50:25] age the outpouring of the Holy Ghost so
[50:27] where does brother Bram come he comes at
[50:28] the end of a Pentecostal age 1906 toza
[50:32] Street and starts his message all right
[50:35] in
[50:36] 1947 all right so let's watch and see
[50:38] what how Paul identifies that now we
[50:41] know the church let's go through this
[50:42] right
[50:43] here we'll get to where I was I added
[50:46] this in the other
[50:48] day Saul blessed his
[50:51] heart he was
[50:53] uh he raised a lot of have it but you
[50:56] know what he became a church age
[50:58] messenger and he became the one that we
[51:01] had to listen
[51:02] to if we were in that church age if we
[51:05] were sitting in Corinth if we were
[51:06] sitting in Ephesus we had to listen to
[51:08] Paul and get what he said so now
[51:11] watching Corinthians Paul says moreover
[51:14] Brethren I declare unto you the gospel
[51:15] which I preached unto you which also you
[51:17] have received and wherein you stand by
[51:19] which also you are saved
[51:24] look
[51:28] I declare unto you the gospel which I
[51:30] preached unto you look at the boldness
[51:31] of Paul but he knew he was where he was
[51:33] standing which also you have received
[51:36] and wherein you stand by which also you
[51:39] are saved if you keep in memory what I
[51:42] preached unto you unless you have
[51:45] believed in vain for I delivered unto
[51:46] you first of all that which I also
[51:48] received now what was it the lust came
[51:50] to Paul Paul takes it gives it to the
[51:52] church all
[51:54] right how that Christ died for our sins
[51:56] according to the scripture and that he
[51:57] was buried and that rose again the third
[51:58] day according to the scripture he was
[52:00] seen of sephus then of the 12 and just
[52:02] talking about the resurrection after
[52:04] that he was seen of 500 Brethren of whom
[52:07] the greater part remain un this present
[52:08] but some are fallen asleep we know by
[52:11] the time Paul writes this I want you to
[52:14] understand something probably over half
[52:16] of the of the Apostles are dead because
[52:19] they all died of martyr's death except
[52:21] John every one of them were killed all
[52:24] right
[52:25] excuse me and after that he was seen of
[52:27] James and all the apostles and last of
[52:29] all he was seen of me look Paul is
[52:31] standing there and if somebody in the
[52:33] congregation is looking at Paul and
[52:35] they're kind of old but they saw Jesus
[52:37] but they never saw Paul and Paul comes
[52:40] on the scene in ad50 something and
[52:42] they're like where'd you see him at he
[52:45] saw him on the road to Damascus he knew
[52:47] who he saw on that road he saw Jesus but
[52:52] he saw it through the people that he was
[52:56] persecuted he says last of all he was
[52:58] seen of me also as of one born out of
[53:01] due time for I am the least of the
[53:03] Apostles and I'm not meat to be called
[53:05] an apostle because I persecuted the
[53:08] Church of God so last of last of all he
[53:10] was supposed to been the 12th guy Maas
[53:12] was the 12th guy Paul is telling them I
[53:15] should have been there on the upper in
[53:16] the upper room instead of persecuting
[53:17] you I should have been a part of you so
[53:19] watch brother brandham now in the Deep
[53:20] call to the Deep this is the movie that
[53:22] they had a brother brandham or the the
[53:24] video
[53:26] the people right here it's not me
[53:27] Christians I'm just a man chief of
[53:29] Sinners but one born out of season to
[53:31] you Full Gospel people now what is he
[53:33] telling them he said I should have been
[53:35] in that 1906 isusa Street
[53:37] meeting when the Holy Ghost
[53:39] fell that's what he's saying it Paul
[53:42] said the same thing he born out of Due
[53:44] Time born out of due season to you Full
[53:47] Gospel people which was the 1906 Isa
[53:50] Street that's right but look by Grace by
[53:52] God's grace he lets me call you brethren
[53:55] and sister I love you he's trying to
[53:58] pull them out of that age Paul trying to
[54:01] pull them out of that
[54:03] age that's
[54:06] declining brother Brown's trying to pull
[54:07] him out of that age that's
[54:09] declining cuz he's bringing them a
[54:11] message and some heard it some didn't
[54:13] some came out some did
[54:16] not the gospel I preach which is not
[54:18] preached to me is not a man Paul said
[54:20] for I neither received it a man neither
[54:22] I taught it but by the revelation of
[54:24] Jesus Christ so now he's telling us he
[54:26] got it from the logos
[54:30] himself and he comes up here in a few
[54:32] minutes and we'll we'll skip through it
[54:33] but he stands and he tells him he says
[54:36] you I've listened to you and you've not
[54:37] added one thing to
[54:39] me you've not added anything to the
[54:43] gospel that I
[54:52] preach right here for they who seem to
[54:54] be some what in conference added nothing
[54:57] to me he was a church age messenger you
[54:59] didn't add nothing to him all right but
[55:02] contrarywise when they saw that the
[55:05] gospel of the uncircumcised was
[55:06] committed unto me in other words to the
[55:08] Gentiles as the gospel of the
[55:10] circumcision was into Peter for he that
[55:12] wrought effectually in Peter to the
[55:14] apostleship of the circumcision in other
[55:15] words Peter was a Jew so was Paul but
[55:18] Paul was bringing them out of that Peter
[55:20] was staying keeping some in that was a
[55:23] little bit of contention they had the
[55:24] same was mighty and me toward the
[55:26] Gentiles and when James cus John who
[55:28] seemed to be pillars perceived the grace
[55:30] that was given unto me look they gave to
[55:31] me and barn the right hand of Fellowship
[55:33] in other words the group of people that
[55:35] God came to the Pentecostals hello
[55:38] somebody the Pentecostals the
[55:43] pillars James cepas and John had enough
[55:46] sense to know that the grace was given
[55:49] to Paul and that they would come out
[55:51] with
[55:52] him cuz even Peter says hey Paul says
[55:55] some things really hard to be
[55:57] understood for you Paul said look I'm an
[56:01] apostle of the Gentiles I magnify my
[56:05] office then Paul tells them one day he
[56:07] says look you're not going to see me
[56:09] anymore I'm going away wherefore I take
[56:13] to you record this day that I am pure
[56:14] from the blood of any man for I have not
[56:17] shown to declare unto you all the
[56:19] counsel of God take heed therefore unto
[56:22] yourselves and to all the flock over
[56:23] which the Holy Ghost has but look he's
[56:25] transferring the
[56:27] power he's transferring the power of the
[56:29] message not Paul the message in Paul
[56:32] he's transferring that over to who
[56:35] overseers to feed the Church of God
[56:37] which he hath purchased with his own
[56:38] blood for I know this that after my
[56:40] departing shall Grievous wolves enter in
[56:42] among you now look they were so alive
[56:44] then because watch what he says not Spar
[56:46] the flock and uh I'm sure people in the
[56:48] congregation like yeah that's them
[56:49] people I under listen also of yourselves
[56:55] right shall men arise of
[56:58] yourselves shall men arise speaking
[57:00] perverse things to draw away
[57:03] disciples after them therefore watch and
[57:05] remember by the space of three years I
[57:07] cease not to warn every everyone night
[57:09] and day he preached three years this is
[57:12] going to happen and guess what it
[57:15] happened amen so now let's look real
[57:18] quick the city of Ephesus the ruins of
[57:19] Ephesus now look that City's are in
[57:21] Ruins today cuz it turned God down I'll
[57:24] tell you in just a minute and what
[57:26] happened was they had two earthquakes
[57:27] this sound
[57:29] familiar what's it called today it's
[57:30] still Ephesus it was famous for what for
[57:33] his Library
[57:36] Google their search engine was a library
[57:40] and if you older ones know one thing for
[57:42] sure we didn't have Google when I was
[57:43] growing up you had to go to a library
[57:46] remember the library bus we love that
[57:49] Library bus I'm sorry I was a country
[57:51] boy born in the 60s but the the library
[57:55] bus would come up to the school cuz the
[57:57] school wasn't big enough to have a
[57:58] library of its own so the library bus
[58:00] would come up and you'd go in there and
[58:01] you'd you'd get your a little card you
[58:03] put your name on it you they'd hold it
[58:05] and you'd take the book and sometimes
[58:07] you brought it back sometimes you didn't
[58:09] and um they send your mom and daddy a
[58:12] bill for $1.50 or something and they're
[58:13] like where's that book and you're
[58:15] like I give it a ter EP is most famous
[58:20] for his Library it was well he couldn't
[58:24] read he give it an it was also famous
[58:26] during its Heyday for being an important
[58:28] look it's an important seat of
[58:30] Christianity this sound familiar now
[58:33] remember the alpha bride and Omega
[58:35] Brides got to be the same they got to
[58:37] have the same characteristics to a
[58:39] degree theyby with me all right so it's
[58:42] an important seat of Christianity in the
[58:44] Roman Empire and for being a thriving
[58:46] Port what does Ephesus mean brother R
[58:48] said it means aimed at or
[58:51] relaxed what is Ephesus in the Bible
[58:53] it's mentioned in the bible several
[58:54] times it's the city where the Apostle
[58:56] Paul preached and the subject of the
[58:57] book of Ephesians it is also said to
[58:59] have been the place where Mary the
[59:00] mother of Jesus lived her final years he
[59:03] she was there John was there Paul went
[59:05] there James went there Timothy went
[59:07] there it was a seat where everybody come
[59:09] into the United oh coming to
[59:12] Ephesus and missionar from the United
[59:15] States are from Ephesus cuz it was a
[59:17] center it was the center the Ephesians
[59:19] were surprisingly modern in their social
[59:21] relations in their social
[59:23] media they allowed strangers to
[59:26] integrate and education was
[59:29] valued the city was famous for its in it
[59:32] in its day for the Temple of Artemis
[59:35] which was that's where the Lady Diana
[59:40] was at they had a library called celsus
[59:43] and they had a theater they had couple
[59:45] of couple of
[59:49] ballparks it received an epistle it was
[59:51] one of the church ages the Gospel of
[59:54] John when go John came back from the AIS
[59:56] of patmas the Little John's there they
[59:58] say it was written in Ephesus because
[1:00:00] John came back in his old age and he
[1:00:01] pastored the church at Ephesus until he
[1:00:03] passed away and he's buried there all
[1:00:06] right so it was a it was a seat of a
[1:00:08] fifth century Christian Council we'll
[1:00:10] talk about that maybe later on but they
[1:00:12] they there was some seeds of deception
[1:00:14] in that too the City was destroyed it
[1:00:17] was rebuilt as a commercial center
[1:00:20] declined as the harbor was slowly silted
[1:00:22] in by the river and in 16 14 it was
[1:00:25] partially destroyed by an earthquake the
[1:00:28] city felt Roman influence at once taxes
[1:00:30] Rose considerably am I saying something
[1:00:32] good or here or is it bad this is what
[1:00:34] we're living through right
[1:00:36] now and I'm going to tell you one thing
[1:00:38] I'm going to stand here and give you
[1:00:39] about two minutes of what I don't like I
[1:00:41] just started drawing my Social Security
[1:00:44] and they're taxing
[1:00:50] it
[1:00:53] devil they're taxing what's already been
[1:00:55] taxed 100
[1:00:57] times my poor old social security
[1:01:00] check June two she dra her for
[1:01:04] me the Treasures of the city were
[1:01:07] systematically plundered hence in 88 BC
[1:01:11] Ephesus welcomed this General and when
[1:01:13] he conquered Asia he conquered all that
[1:01:15] he named his thing for Rome from Ephesus
[1:01:18] he ordered every Roman citizen to be
[1:01:19] killed 880,000 Roman citizens were
[1:01:22] killed because they were were Jews uh
[1:01:30] Romans they had a a 25,000 seeding
[1:01:34] capacity theater the largest in the
[1:01:36] ancient world these people love their
[1:01:38] entertainment hello
[1:01:41] somebody this open air theater was used
[1:01:43] initially for drama but during later
[1:01:45] Roman times gladiatorial combats were
[1:01:47] also held on its stage the first
[1:01:49] archaeological evidence of a gladiator
[1:01:51] graveyard was found in 2007 this is
[1:01:53] actually where Paul this right here Paul
[1:01:56] stood in this Arena and that's when they
[1:01:58] started screaming for 2 hours they stood
[1:02:01] up and Proclaim their God was Diana we
[1:02:05] can't set 30 minutes in a
[1:02:07] church and they can scream for two
[1:02:11] hours that their God Diana was the
[1:02:14] perfect one and the one that we rever
[1:02:17] they stood right here for two
[1:02:20] hours and cheered their best team
[1:02:23] on yeah Paul got run out of
[1:02:26] that if you're reading your Bible Paul
[1:02:28] gets run out of there because of that
[1:02:30] overwhelming deception in that Arena
[1:02:33] right there what do you think about it
[1:02:35] now it had an aqueduct system in other
[1:02:38] words it was Advanced like we are
[1:02:41] today bed watermills listen they had a
[1:02:43] sawmill that could cut marble you know
[1:02:46] how hard marble is to cut they had a
[1:02:49] sawmill and listen let me give you a duh
[1:02:52] moment there was no electricity there
[1:02:54] right Amen to turn that Sawmill had to
[1:02:56] be run by either people or water one of
[1:03:00] the two and it had to be running real
[1:03:01] fast so Diana was the goddess and she
[1:03:04] was the one that they they revered and
[1:03:06] loved and people were making money off
[1:03:07] of her Paul meets said what the SM
[1:03:09] silver smith they one of them and
[1:03:11] they're they're making little Idol and
[1:03:12] saying oh Diana's going to do this for
[1:03:14] you
[1:03:16] and today's the same
[1:03:19] thing we don't have a silver smith we
[1:03:22] have
[1:03:23] Walmart
[1:03:26] Amazon
[1:03:30] eBay well get quiet all you want
[1:03:33] to when you start talking about that
[1:03:35] that people Amazon you go everybody goes
[1:03:37] man I ordered something yesterday I know
[1:03:39] that cuz I'm the postman I'll deliver it
[1:03:41] for
[1:03:43] you but Diana was considered a triple
[1:03:46] deity does everybody understand what I'm
[1:03:47] saying there was a trinity
[1:03:49] here and she had two sisters Moon a a
[1:03:53] bride
[1:03:55] uh goddess of the Moon Luna Seline and
[1:03:58] the
[1:03:59] underworld
[1:04:02] HEC once Greek influence it caused Diana
[1:04:04] to be considered identical to the Greek
[1:04:06] goddess Artemis in other words
[1:04:09] Twins then remember I told you first
[1:04:11] century Roman coin depicts her with a
[1:04:14] unique short
[1:04:20] hairstyle and in triple form with one
[1:04:23] form holding a bow with no arrows as
[1:04:26] Brother Gary Atkins always says there's
[1:04:29] a Satan has a bow with no arrows he
[1:04:31] can't kill you we just hand him a bunch
[1:04:33] of arrows and say here shoot me with
[1:04:34] this right that's why we talk about
[1:04:36] resist and assist we assist him with the
[1:04:38] Arrows with one form holding a bow and
[1:04:41] another holding a poppy in other words
[1:04:43] drugs so now let's look at the people
[1:04:45] real quick it's 11:30 if we'll go ahead
[1:04:47] and get ready for the for the uh
[1:04:49] communion the people now look at Acts 19
[1:04:51] it came to pass that while Apollos was
[1:04:54] at at Corinth Paul having passed through
[1:04:55] the upper Coast came to Ephesus now he's
[1:04:57] come to Ephesus for the first time he's
[1:04:59] meeting these people and finding certain
[1:05:01] disciples now remember Christianity has
[1:05:03] already come to
[1:05:06] Ephesus in other words the Holy Ghost
[1:05:08] has already fell on some because they
[1:05:09] were Believers there but this group had
[1:05:11] not heard that they were over in another
[1:05:15] area cuz they were disciples he said
[1:05:18] unto them have you received the Holy
[1:05:19] Ghost since you believed and they said
[1:05:21] unto him we have not so much as heard
[1:05:23] whether the any Holy Ghost and he said
[1:05:25] unto them unto what then were you
[1:05:27] baptize and they said to John's baptism
[1:05:29] then Paul then said Paul John be
[1:05:31] baptised with the baptism of repentance
[1:05:33] now look he didn't do away with John he
[1:05:35] said oh bless God John was wrong no John
[1:05:36] was right in the era that John was in or
[1:05:40] the
[1:05:42] dispensation baptism of repentance
[1:05:44] saying to the people that they should
[1:05:45] believe on him which should come after
[1:05:46] him that is Christ Jesus when they heard
[1:05:49] this there was no
[1:05:52] disputation they were baptized in the
[1:05:54] name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul
[1:05:57] laid his hands on him the Holy Ghost
[1:05:58] came on him and his fake was hung and
[1:06:00] prophesied and all the men were about 12
[1:06:03] and then Paul goes into the synagogue
[1:06:05] and he speaks boldly for the space of
[1:06:07] three months disputing and persuading
[1:06:08] the things concerning the kingdom of God
[1:06:11] but when divers or many people were
[1:06:13] hardened and believed not but spake
[1:06:15] evil Hello somebody speaks evil of you
[1:06:20] separated the disciples disputing daily
[1:06:22] in the school of one tyrannus and this
[1:06:25] continued by the space of two years so
[1:06:27] that all they which dwelt in Asia heard
[1:06:29] the word of the Lord Jesus both Jews and
[1:06:32] GRE Greek so it was a center of
[1:06:34] Christianity now look at second Timothy
[1:06:37] but thou Hast fully known my Doctrine
[1:06:39] manner of life purpose Faith
[1:06:40] longsuffering charity patience
[1:06:43] persecutions afflictions which came unto
[1:06:45] me in Antioch Iconium lra what
[1:06:49] persecutions I endured but out of them
[1:06:51] all the Lord delivered me me the Bible
[1:06:55] says according to Paul says yeah and all
[1:06:57] that live Godly in Christ shall suffer
[1:07:01] persecution that's right but evil men
[1:07:03] and seducers shall wax worse and worse
[1:07:05] deceiving and being deceived but
[1:07:07] continue thou in the things which thou
[1:07:09] has learned and has been assured of
[1:07:11] knowing of whom thou Hast
[1:07:13] learned them from in other words Paul's
[1:07:17] gospel Revelations 2:9 says I Know Thy
[1:07:20] works and tribulation listen God knows
[1:07:23] we having tribul God knows we have
[1:07:25] persecution all that live Godly in
[1:07:27] Christ Shall Serve for persecution you
[1:07:28] look at
[1:07:30] Job look at your look at your part your
[1:07:33] life that that that we suffer
[1:07:36] persecution
[1:07:38] right you go to work and you live the
[1:07:41] best you can you don't cuss drink smoke
[1:07:43] or or lie and and one of your co-workers
[1:07:46] they do that and they get promoted and
[1:07:49] you
[1:07:50] don't right but you're living a standard
[1:07:53] right amen listen we don't get away from
[1:07:55] the standard we live in the standard
[1:07:57] we're not going to do a dirty rotten
[1:07:59] deal we're not going to do that we're
[1:08:00] not going to um as sisters we're not
[1:08:03] going to act like the
[1:08:05] world separate from the world and listen
[1:08:09] that's your
[1:08:11] persecution now watch let me see it real
[1:08:13] quick and then we'll take
[1:08:15] communion I read several commentators on
[1:08:18] this and and I pulled all gleaned all
[1:08:20] this from all of them so in the first
[1:08:22] century the city of Ephesus had an
[1:08:23] environment very similar to our own
[1:08:25] modern day America it was the crossroads
[1:08:28] of civilization politically known as the
[1:08:30] Supreme Metropolis of Asia were known as
[1:08:34] what most powerful country in in the
[1:08:37] world the Roman governor of the region
[1:08:40] lived there and it was the religious
[1:08:41] center for the worship of fertility
[1:08:43] goddess known by the Greeks as Artemis
[1:08:46] and by the Romans as Diana her temple on
[1:08:48] the outskirts of the city was one of the
[1:08:50] Seven Wonders of the World economically
[1:08:53] effort was a
[1:08:55] giant you can't make this up right so
[1:08:59] are we with his strategic location it
[1:09:02] was the chief Commercial Center of
[1:09:04] Western Asia Minor its harbor brought
[1:09:07] ships from around the Mediterranean and
[1:09:08] its two major roads gave ready access to
[1:09:11] other cities along the coast and Inland
[1:09:13] Diana's Temple considered sacran
[1:09:16] throughout the Roman world became the
[1:09:17] primary banking
[1:09:20] institution in Asia Minor morally
[1:09:24] however the city was
[1:09:26] bankrupt just as our nation is in in
[1:09:29] inundated with perversion and prnography
[1:09:32] Ephesus was controlled by the educated
[1:09:35] prostitutes affiliated with Diana
[1:09:37] worship does this all sound familiar
[1:09:40] part of the cult of Diana was the use of
[1:09:42] ritual prostitution whereby the devote
[1:09:44] became joined with the goddess through
[1:09:45] her Priestess ensuring her favor
[1:09:48] throughout the year one philosopher
[1:09:49] committing on the moral climate in
[1:09:51] Ephesus wrote that the inhabitants of
[1:09:53] the city were fit only to be
[1:09:56] drowned he said that the reason he could
[1:09:58] never smile or laugh was because he
[1:09:59] lived among such terrible
[1:10:03] uncleanness it was the members of his
[1:10:06] church who lived among such prosperity
[1:10:08] and depravity that Christ addressed his
[1:10:10] first letter among seven in Revelations
[1:10:12] 2 in other words he addresses Ephesians
[1:10:14] first to the church in Ephesus
[1:10:17] Revelations 2 by the time the Apostle
[1:10:18] John recorded Jesus Christ's letter to
[1:10:20] the church in Ephesus more than 60 years
[1:10:22] had passed since the Inception of the
[1:10:24] Church of God the sprawling city of
[1:10:26] Ephesus prospered as a commercial center
[1:10:28] for the ancient world and a focal point
[1:10:30] for Pagan worship does that sound
[1:10:32] familiar the physically imposing Temple
[1:10:34] of Diana towered over the city's
[1:10:36] landscape influencing and encouraging
[1:10:39] the evil practice of magine now look
[1:10:41] this is the seed of
[1:10:43] Christianity right we're it's supposed
[1:10:45] to be
[1:10:46] clean and without all that perversion
[1:10:50] but it's the seed of both cuzz both seed
[1:10:53] were planted in the in Ephesus and
[1:10:56] they're going to what they're going to
[1:10:57] culminate whatever this is is going to
[1:10:59] culminate in this age all right amid
[1:11:04] this vital bustling and sinful
[1:11:08] Metropolis you know the world you know
[1:11:10] they they um um Prosperity is what
[1:11:14] everybody you know even now in the
[1:11:16] religious realm they're preaching
[1:11:17] Prosperity Gospel everything you know if
[1:11:19] you if you come to church and pay your
[1:11:21] tith and and God's going to just pour
[1:11:23] out a blessing he will pour out a
[1:11:24] blessing but it's not going to be
[1:11:25] probably with dead presidents on it I'll
[1:11:27] promise you that and I don't want it I'd
[1:11:29] rather have a blessing of God that's
[1:11:30] connected to me and to you that's right
[1:11:35] not money the Ephesian church was born
[1:11:37] despite its carnal surroundings the
[1:11:39] church endeavored to be doctrinally
[1:11:41] faithful now listen to its Divine
[1:11:43] founder striving to resist the influence
[1:11:45] of Satan and his false teachers Jesus
[1:11:48] letter to the Church of Ephesus contains
[1:11:49] Jesus's famous rebuke you have left your
[1:11:51] first love the Believers that Ephesus
[1:11:54] now listen this commentator was really
[1:11:56] very Frank cuz he was talking about the
[1:11:58] Believers at Ephesus now he was talking
[1:12:00] about the world before he talking about
[1:12:01] the Believers at Ephesus struggling
[1:12:04] beneath the weight of a Godless and
[1:12:06] immoral culture which we live in right
[1:12:08] now had maintained the letter of the law
[1:12:12] but had lost the spirit of the law go to
[1:12:16] Romans 2:
[1:12:17] 29 Jesus commended them for their hard
[1:12:20] work perseverance rejection of false
[1:12:22] teaching and hatred of sin but he was
[1:12:25] grieved that they had become routine in
[1:12:27] their service for him rather than serve
[1:12:30] him with the passion they once had I'm
[1:12:33] talking to lul church
[1:12:35] today their actions were there but their
[1:12:37] hearts were not Jesus's word to the
[1:12:40] Believers in Ephesus should challenge
[1:12:42] all Servants of the Lord it is easy to
[1:12:44] get caught up into busyness of Ministry
[1:12:46] Church work volunteering and not realize
[1:12:49] our passion for the Lord has cooled we
[1:12:52] are no longer prepared held into service
[1:12:54] by love but by some other selfish or
[1:12:56] worldly motivation we may think God
[1:12:59] doesn't mind as long as we are outwardly
[1:13:01] obeying but he does mind it hurts him
[1:13:05] and it violates the greatest commandment
[1:13:07] you shall love the Lord your God with
[1:13:08] all your heart soul
[1:13:11] mind and
[1:13:13] strength Jesus gave the church at
[1:13:15] Ephesus time to repent and he gives us
[1:13:17] time as well every moment we resist his
[1:13:20] call to humble oursel and return to our
[1:13:22] first love is one more moment that we
[1:13:24] forfeit the love joy and peace that he
[1:13:29] offers he's so concerned about the
[1:13:31] Church of the day they he made certain
[1:13:33] that this letter was preserved and given
[1:13:35] to me and
[1:13:36] you that was the people of
[1:13:39] Ephesus if we're the book in then that
[1:13:42] same spirit's down here but you what
[1:13:43] it's
[1:13:45] magnified it's
[1:13:47] magnified cuz look they only the the
[1:13:49] city of Ephesus had like 250,000 people
[1:13:52] well that's really not much more more
[1:13:53] than a small City in the in in in the
[1:13:55] United States 250,000 people but in that
[1:13:58] 250,000 people is all this what happened
[1:14:01] cuz it was the center and the seat of
[1:14:02] everything but look how it's spread now
[1:14:04] it's all over the world deception lying
[1:14:07] thieving all this other stuff and have
[1:14:09] we become cold have we lost our first
[1:14:12] love we're in the message what do you
[1:14:15] what do you
[1:14:16] want I want you to be in love with the
[1:14:18] Lord not in love with this

[1:14:24] Lord I want the Lord when you come in
[1:14:26] hear that the Lord's the one that you

[1:14:31] voice speaking to us and yes we are the
[1:14:34] Bride of Jesus Christ let's stand to our
[1:14:36] feet let's take communion if you'll pull
[1:14:38] that scripture up please
[1:14:40] we Sorry to run over a little bit but I
[1:14:42] wanted to it just really was astounding
[1:14:44] to look at the people of Ephesus and
[1:14:46] what they went through and what you and
[1:14:48] I go through now as today as being
[1:14:52] Christians in this last Church
[1:14:56] age
[1:14:58] knowing listen listen folks knowing the
[1:15:02] full measure of the word in this
[1:15:05] hour they didn't know the full measure
[1:15:08] that's right you and I know the full
[1:15:10] measure we can look back through history
[1:15:12] and we've got history that tells us this
[1:15:15] is what happened this is what happened
[1:15:16] this is the way Satan act this is the
[1:15:18] way God acts this the way Satan act and
[1:15:20] it walks you right on up to today
[1:15:24] if that was a seat of
[1:15:26] Satan Satan Satan wanted to get in the
[1:15:29] temple here he's in the temple over here
[1:15:32] remember he wants to be worshiped as
[1:15:37] God but listen the bride will not be
[1:15:42] deceived something is going to click
[1:15:44] inside of you and say that ain't right
[1:15:48] and you're going to flee from that
[1:15:51] resist it not assist it
[1:15:54] so let's take communion let's read the
[1:15:55] let's read the
[1:15:56] scripture we got up on the screen yeah 1
[1:15:59] Corinthians for I received of the Lord
[1:16:02] that which also I delivered unto you
[1:16:03] that the Lord Jesus same night in which
[1:16:05] he was betrayed he took bread when he
[1:16:08] give thanks he break it and said take
[1:16:09] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:16:11] you this do in remembrance of me after
[1:16:16] the same manner he took the cup and when
[1:16:17] he sucked he said this cup is the New
[1:16:19] Testament in my blood this do you as
[1:16:22] often as you drink it and remembrance of
[1:16:23] me for as often as you eat this bread
[1:16:26] and drink this cup you do sure the
[1:16:27] Lord's death till he comes wherefore
[1:16:30] whosoever shall eat of this bread and
[1:16:32] drink of this cup of the Lord unworthily
[1:16:34] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:16:36] the Lord but let a man examine himself
[1:16:38] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:16:40] drink of that cup and remember we don't
[1:16:42] do like the world we don't buy our bread
[1:16:43] from somebody we have holy hands make
[1:16:46] that bread right there amen and we have
[1:16:49] that is wine that's not grape juice
[1:16:51] Jesus didn't turn to water into grape
[1:16:55] juice it
[1:16:57] Welches he turned the water into wine
[1:16:59] and wine gets better with AIDS grape
[1:17:02] juice will rot but this word of God will
[1:17:05] not rot it gets better with AIDS just
[1:17:07] like that wine right there for this
[1:17:10] caused many are weak and sickly among
[1:17:11] you and many sleep for if we would judge
[1:17:15] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:17:16] when we are judged we are chasing the
[1:17:19] lord judge yourself today I'm not going
[1:17:20] to judge you you judge yourself whether
[1:17:22] you worthy or not to take this communion
[1:17:25] we are chasen to the Lord that we should
[1:17:27] not be condemned with the world
[1:17:30] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:17:31] together to eat tarry one for another
[1:17:33] and if any man hunger let him meat at
[1:17:34] home that you come not together into
[1:17:36] condemnation and arrest I set an order
[1:17:39] when I come Paul writing to the
[1:17:40] Corinthians and he said look guys
[1:17:43] communion is
[1:17:45] not um what you call it um rind or or um
[1:17:50] Golden Corral that's what they were
[1:17:52] doing they were getting drunk at the L
[1:17:54] at the table saying it was the Lord's
[1:17:55] table and they was making all kind of
[1:17:57] food and everything he said no Paul said
[1:18:00] that look that's not it this is reverent
[1:18:03] this is something Jesus was fixing to
[1:18:06] die he was fixing to give his life for
[1:18:09] me and you it should be a solemn event
[1:18:12] it should be an event that the bread
[1:18:14] made with holy hands and listen that
[1:18:16] bread is not going to be something you
[1:18:17] going to say man I'll make that at home
[1:18:19] no listen Jesus told him one time he
[1:18:22] said can you bear this that I'm
[1:18:24] bearing he said can you bear this are
[1:18:26] you going to be able to Bear what I'm
[1:18:27] bearing he said yes some of you will he
[1:18:29] knew Peter was going to be crucified
[1:18:31] like him but can you bear the cross he
[1:18:34] told you to Bear one right you have a
[1:18:36] cross to bear your
[1:18:38] own must Jesus bear the cross alone and
[1:18:40] all the world go
[1:18:42] free there's a cross for everyone and
[1:18:44] there's a cross for me amen when he
[1:18:47] before he went to the Cross he said this
[1:18:48] is the New Testament in my blood this is
[1:18:50] going to be something new you're going
[1:18:51] to be able to live this
[1:18:53] it's not going to be a Ten Commandment
[1:18:55] ritual it's going to be something as
[1:18:56] brother Bob talking about something you
[1:18:57] live it's just as common as you moving
[1:19:00] your hands if you got the Holy Ghost
[1:19:02] inside of you to take this communion so
[1:19:04] let's bow our heads just for a minute
[1:19:06] let's clear our hearts out let's clear
[1:19:08] our mind out let's we we come together
[1:19:13] today to worship to do this Commandment
[1:19:17] that the lord gave us and now pray
[1:19:20] inside
[1:19:21] yourself just for a
[1:19:32] moment Lord give us strength to take
[1:19:34] this communion Lord and and may it show
[1:19:37] forth Lord that we are committing oursel

[1:22:42] talking
[1:22:46] persecuted question oh

[1:22:55] then I take one more
[1:22:58] look at Mount
[1:23:02] Calvary and it gives me the strength to
[1:23:08] go on you know we're only
[1:23:11] given the Bible says 70 years maybe 72
[1:23:15] years and
[1:23:17] uh of of
[1:23:20] life and some have lived more some will
[1:23:23] live
[1:23:23] less but it's only just a blip in the
[1:23:26] screen of History just just a very
[1:23:29] microcosm I mean just you don't can't
[1:23:31] even see it if you take the timeline
[1:23:33] from from uh Adam and Eve till today you
[1:23:37] know you and I were not even like a
[1:23:39] molecule in that time so why are we
[1:23:42] living why are we living here we're
[1:23:44] living here to live
[1:23:46] there we're living here for a temporary
[1:23:48] to live there Eternal so whatever trials
[1:23:51] and tribulations you know we don't don't
[1:23:52] listen we don't say bring it on but if
[1:23:55] that's what's going to get us out of
[1:23:57] here you know what happened when Israel
[1:23:59] they were just fat and happy they loved
[1:24:02] in in Egypt man they was getting all
[1:24:05] kind of straw and they was getting their
[1:24:07] mud and and and the Roman government or
[1:24:10] Pharaoh was giving him all their giving
[1:24:12] them all this stuff and they had so much
[1:24:14] time they started having a bunch of
[1:24:18] babies they a lot of leisure
[1:24:21] time so they started having a bunch of
[1:24:23] young
[1:24:23] ons Pharaoh got together with his men he
[1:24:26] said uh if this keeps up they's going to
[1:24:30] be more of them than the more of us and
[1:24:32] they going to raise up and we going
[1:24:33] they're going to be our we going to be
[1:24:35] their slave so what' he do he said on
[1:24:38] now um um you going to have to go get
[1:24:40] your own
[1:24:41] straw wow okay we'll do that rocked on a
[1:24:45] few more years and same thing kept
[1:24:47] happening Pharaoh's like got to do
[1:24:50] something else got to do something
[1:24:52] different different so he says all right
[1:24:54] you got to build your bricks without
[1:24:56] straw so you got to make those things
[1:24:58] really Compact and it's going to take
[1:25:00] you a lot longer your day is going to be
[1:25:02] longer you're going to be tired and
[1:25:04] we're going to stop this baby making
[1:25:05] stuff right but what happened is when
[1:25:09] Pharaoh was putting the pressure on the
[1:25:11] children of Israel the children of
[1:25:13] Israel were going God where your
[1:25:18] people you told us listen Our Father
[1:25:21] Joseph
[1:25:24] J brought us here remember there was
[1:25:27] famine in the land Joseph said bring all
[1:25:29] the brothers and all the brothers and
[1:25:31] there were some sisters but bring them
[1:25:32] all in here put them in Egypt and they
[1:25:34] live just oh hunky dory they had a brand
[1:25:37] new car couple of them in their parking
[1:25:39] lot they had uh full internet service
[1:25:43] and uh they had U States and potatoes
[1:25:46] and and they had um uh door Dash and
[1:25:50] people bringing them food and they were
[1:25:51] just having a happy time and if you
[1:25:53] needed something painted you called the
[1:25:56] painter if you need your car worked on
[1:25:58] you called you called a guy to work on
[1:26:00] your car it was just
[1:26:03] wonderful and every cell phone worked
[1:26:06] everywhere they went they had Self
[1:26:09] Service all of a sudden Pharaoh said
[1:26:12] well let's let's let's make the economy
[1:26:14] go up here and we're going to take care
[1:26:16] of some of this
[1:26:18] Prosperity what happened to the children
[1:26:20] of Israel brother r said the reason the
[1:26:23] deliverer came on the scene listen to
[1:26:27] me was that they got tired of where they
[1:26:30] living children of Israel got tired and
[1:26:33] said God we need a
[1:26:36] deliverer we need somebody to deliver us
[1:26:39] out of this right here you said we were
[1:26:41] your children now it's been kind of
[1:26:43] turned around to where it's like you've
[1:26:46] you've went away from us Lord no he was
[1:26:47] right there but like me and you when
[1:26:51] there's ease and Zion we're okay we're
[1:26:54] good but when persecution comes we pray
[1:26:57] more remember when 9911 hit y'all
[1:27:00] remember that when 911 hit the next day
[1:27:03] they had a National Day of Prayer no not
[1:27:06] the next day but the next week well they
[1:27:08] violated their own law they took the
[1:27:11] prayer out of the school now they want
[1:27:12] everybody to pray why cuz something
[1:27:15] happened and then churches filled up and
[1:27:18] then everybody started getting religious
[1:27:20] well guess what it's been what now 20
[1:27:23] years right back to the same old
[1:27:25] thing exact same thing don't even stand
[1:27:28] up for the pre of Allegiance anymore

[1:27:32] they don't they you know they turn their
[1:27:33] backs and all this
[1:27:36] stuff that man right there is fighting

[1:27:41] free but listen God fought first to keep
[1:27:45] us free we're the one that went into
[1:27:48] captivity so I
[1:27:50] God if it gives this persecution to get
[1:27:53] us out of here we need
