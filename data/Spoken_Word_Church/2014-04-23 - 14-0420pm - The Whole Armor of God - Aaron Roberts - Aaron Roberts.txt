they see hey man I'm so glad that we have eyes to see ears to hear Hearts to receive amen amen Lord bless you could be in the house of the Lord this evening so y'all just pray for me tonight I heard there was a little a little mix up on who was going to preach tonight brother Dale said everybody was asking who's going to preach I guess everybody yes I was going to say it was like David everybody was everybody was Samuel came to anoint the king they started looking for everybody and it's like ain't there one more we've missed everybody I said yeah the least in the bunch is around littlest I said the least I didn't say that I didn't say the littlest I said the least in the bunch I believe that's what Apostle Paul said that he was the least among all the saints so it's good to be the the least you just raise yourself up to where God puts you amen amen appreciate the Lord tonight we're going to be looking in Ephesians chapter 6. and uh you know sometimes you don't know you feel like you don't know what to say and other times you because you're like well I don't have anything you don't feel like there's anything and then other times you feel like you're trying to narrow it down to something to say and uh I don't know if you ever heard the little story about the the old blind black preacher and you know the the black people used to have they used to have readers well he had he had somebody to read the scripture for him all the time and had this young man that was going to get up to read the scripture for him and he asked the preacher said where do you want me to read from and he said just read anywhere he said it's all got to be preached so you know sometimes you wonder where you where you want where do we need to be it's like well it's always got to be preached but you know we want to narrow it down to something but uh it's just something kind of been looking at and uh we're just going to Bow our heads and uh before we read the scripture not and get started and just uh just give the Lord the preeminence in the service dear heavenly father we thank you for this today and Lord the time that we live and Lord for all your blessings on us Lord for bringing us again tonight to service and father we just pray that you just come tonight and Lord just get us out of the way and you just come and speak and have the preeminence in the service and Lord just minister in a special way and Lord I know many times we're tired and and body and mind and but Lord we just look to you this evening they just come and refresh us Lord and just bless us and Lord that we can just be renewed in the Holy Ghost this evening Lord bless the word bless each heart Lord each need is represented Lord you've seen the unspoken request the lifting of the hands and Lord you know what's on each heart tonight and father we we realize that we are so so lacking in ability Lord or we don't have any we don't have the ability to to touch the people Lord but Lord we can just stand here tonight and just be a open vessel for you to come and Lord because you know what's on each heart what the needs are you can speak through us to them and Lord was just as they were in the day of Pentecost Lord just have us be in one mind and one Accord Lord Jesus that you can come and administer in a special way Lord we just commit all things to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10. says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might says put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith he shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints amen the Lord bless the reading of the word you may be seated so you know just pray for me this evening but a lot of things though try to cover but uh one of the things that that stood out to me about this was inner brother Branham speaking of the Ephesian Church he said the Ephesian Church was a was a solid Church right you know he said that uh they were well taught he said that Paul could tell teach them things taught them things that he couldn't teach the other churches he didn't have the problems with the Ephesians that he had with the Corinthian Church you know brother Adam said that the um Ephesians had had tongues and everything but he said they had it all in order and it didn't have any of those uh problems in uh somebody get me some water fuel don't mind sorry sorry but uh anyway um you know you look at these things and you look at the book of Ephesians and what stands out to me is you look at the things that Paul wrote has wrote to the church in in the book of Ephesians and you go back to chapter one and and there he he speaks about how we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world and you know you go through and he talks about the mystery of the will of God and and all the things that he lays out through the the whole book of Ephesians and you know brother around type divisions as the uh parallels Joshua showing the position placing of the believer and their uh placing and their promise and their possession and you know it's so amazing that he goes through and explains all these great Mysteries all the way through the the scripture and you know many things that we look at and it's just amazing the uh the wealth of of information and knowledge not just as to know something but it's what God was showing the people in the book of Ephesians and I want to say all that because you look at all these things and we say well you know they were great and taught and had all these great things but at the end of all that that Paul said to the Ephesians he gets to the end and he says finally my brother Brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might well you would think that after he spent all that time telling about how predestinated they were and all the things that he went through you think they were they were at a place you think they were fortified but then he stands there and says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord thank you buddy but uh anyway he goes you know he's he's speaking he says then he tells them to put on the whole armor of God well you would think that would be something you you would cover in the beginning and not in the end so you know it's a amazing little thing that you know because after you go through and you can talk about how predestinated you are and all these great Mysteries and everything but that's when the devil is going to attack you you know brother Branham said in Christ the mystery he said all hell is against this teaching he said all hails against this truth well the more truth you have the more the devil's going to attack you because that's where the truth is and so that's the reason I think that Paul this at the end he says now finally my brethren be strong in the Lord why because you know these things you've been taught these things that's where the battle is going to take place because then now you now you see where you're going to have to fight but says but he says put on this whole armor so there's a whole armor for us to put on because you know what that now we understand he said that you can wavestand The Wiles of the devil right right so we know that's where the tricks of the devil are going to come in because the devil's not trying to do away with the word but he's trying to pervert the word that's that's his whole plan from the beginning as he's tried to pervert the word and so we understand that's where he's his attack is but it that's what while Paul was expounding to the and trying to push to the Ephesians be strong and take on the armor of God and and so you withstand so he says for wrestle not against flesh and blood against principalities against powers you know against the rulers of the darkness get spiritual wickedness in high places you know and one of the scripture that stands at you and Paul said he said but for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal he said But Mighty through God to the pulling down the strongholds so there's a understanding that you know we have to be equipped to fight and your brother Benham goes through and and there's many many uh stories and and things and uh one of them is uh restoration of the broad tree here uh brother Joe it's uh our brother Anderson it's uh number one here and then you know brothers and I'm sure many of you have read this before but you know this is the one one of the uh quotes that always stands out to me you know brother Brown was talking about the about the man that was going through training he said he was standing there with pockets full of stand and everything where he had to hold his head down so low the live machine gun fire was going right over his head where he crawled through Barbed wires and things taking a rigid training and he said well you know that's what we're doing here but now he said it's a lot different on the battle front he said that machine gun is timed train right at a certain level but on the Battlefront he said it would come down up it could come up or down so that's a little different there you see but we have to well this is training here but out there you're on the Battlefront so we understand that this is a training and you you know this is where the the training and you know brother random goes on and he was speaking of uh young man he said it he said he didn't understand what you know going through training having to carry a 90 pound pack and and all the things that he had to go through but he said you know when he got on the battlefield then he realized all the training that he had to go through had a purpose and all the things that he went through had to have a uh a a uh a need when he got on the battlefield and he said he was thankful for it when he got on the battlefield because that's when it was really needful and it come into into uh into use and so we understand there's many many things that we have to go through and we understand this is the this is the fight and this is where our training takes place and you know there's many things that you go through and we have uh training and uh I was when I was speaking up brother gadson's I was I was speaking on this and talking about the armor of God and how we how we become equipped and all the things that God has given us and one of the little story it comes to mind and how do you get I get to share with him but it was on it was on my mind and I'm going to share it tonight his brother Donnie and brother Donnie was talking about going through the Marine Corps boot camp and you know he's talking about all these guys you know who said oh I can't handle this I can't handle this and he said well he said y'all didn't live with TJ fallbush he said when he got to boot camp he said it wasn't it wasn't too hard he said there was a lot because see he had been trained and and you know he had been through had an experience with something that when he got to boot camp and I'm not saying boot Camp's easy and I I certainly wouldn't want to go through it myself and I appreciate everybody that's been through it and all the ones that have stood and and fought and and done and done their part for our nation but I tell you what you know Donnie said you know those guys are you know they just freaking out and having a hard time he said you'd have never live with TJ fallbush so yeah I mean there's a but you know because but you know when you go through something that's difficult you know well you can't make it I can't make it but you know when you get through it then when you look at that then people sometimes they'll say well I've been through hard times and they said well God's brought me through well then you know what there should be an anchor sat down inside of you that when you come to something that's difficult because one of the things that uh I want to get to a little bit later on is speaking on on the life of David but when you get to a place there ought to be an anchor sat down and says you know what I've I've made it through this and if God has met this need then guess what the next need I have he'll he's there to meet it again so because you know what because we see we say well God has because we don't understand we don't realize it you know he was talking about just like that little mouse in in the grain Gardeners of of Egypt and he was standing there saying I better eat sparingly because I may run out or he's talking about that little fish in the ocean said I better just sip on the water because I might run out because see but he said he said ask that your joy might be full so if if we have a need then he said Paul said my God shall supply all your needs according to his riches in glory and he said he said that's a as the story that I've told many times in one of my favorite quotes in the message and if uh is brother brother man speaking on a message why 1963 and he talks about that lady that had uh had a son that had went to India and you know he'd become an electrical engineer and he made all this money and he kept sending her postcards back and you know she was sticking to the little postcard in her Bible and she kept putting them in there and you know she got to the place where she was so poor she had to turn was trying to find hell because she was starving to death and had nothing and then you know people come and was checking on her was asking her don't you have any you know family any help yeah I have a son who sends me postcards all the time and he said but you know um but you know don't he send you you know to help you out and he said well they probably don't know but if he did you know he probably would but I'm just so just so afraid to ask him for it and you know and I said well you get all these postcards with pretty pictures said oh yeah they're in my Bible and she said well can we see them and they said yeah so she opens up her Bible and pulls them out and started looking and they started looking at them and she thought they were postcards with pretty pictures but you know what they were they were Bank drafts why because he had converted that money from Indian money into American money and sent her the the bank drafts and you know brother man said what was it he said in the lids of her Bible she just thought they were pretty pictures but he said that was real value to her and he said brother and sister that's what I love so much he said brother and sister he said if anybody ever tries to tell you of a painted fire of Pentecost he said don't you believe him he said why because he's the same yesterday today and forever he said Paul said that it's unto you and to your children and to them that's a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call he said that's a bank draft on heaven and I tell you what he said he's the same yesterday today and forever and you know that's what I believe and that's why I see it because you know what we have and you know it's just a testimony to me because you know many uh maybe a lot of you don't know and you know we have just we've had to struggle financially for a while and you know sometimes we didn't know where we're going to where we're going to make it but you know what I had a promise to hold on to you know God didn't open up just poor poor money out but you know what he gave me the opportunity to make money he gave me he gave me a job that I I thank God you know it may not it may not be and and I understand work is a four-letter word you know what it's it's not it's not the you know if if we didn't have to work a lot of people wouldn't do it but you know what I thank God that I've got the job that I have because God gave it to me why because you know what I have a job that uses the skills because the scripture says that a man's gift will make a way for him so you know what God trains us and makes us go through situations in our life and to to bring us to a place that he can bless us you know sometimes we look at it and we you know the the story of the widow woman you know Elisha sat beside a brook and drank water and had the Ravens come and feed him until until the brook dried up well you know what that didn't prepare Elijah it prepared the widow woman to got to the place that she didn't have anything so that Elijah could come and bless her all right and then when they came then there was a time because she thought she was going to die she thought it was all over with but you know what he said come and make me a little cake first he said just give me a little bit of what you've got and he said he said if you just give me this little bit he said he said the mail will never run out he said the crew's oil will never run dry you know what it didn't fail you know what the old didn't fill up her house the building fill up her house but you know what she had everything she had need of it and so you know I understand and I thank God that he's allowed me to get to the you know and maybe maybe it was for my maybe it was for my training maybe it was for my good that I had to struggle that I had to go through these things but you know what I thank God that I can I can go to a job that people appreciate you that it's the people that you work for you know you see the things that you've had to go through in in the past and you come in there and you know maybe everything don't go your way or whatever but I tell you what it's a whole lot better than other places that I've worked and you know maybe other people would want to work there but I tell you what it just suits me fine okay so you know I thank God and you know because you see how God if you had to struggle and you've had to go through these things and God brings us to you then guess what the next time you have a struggle you have a problem guess what my God will meet your needs but you know what he's wanting somebody to take him out his word he wants somebody to believe him come on he said he said try me prove me and see if I don't open up the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that you can't contain but you know what you've got to trust him you've got to prove him and you know when you do that you get a blessing so we understand we're in a battle brother Brandon speaking an uncertain sound you know he said that that Soldier if he's a trained soldier he said he knows every sound of that trumpet just exactly what to do he's trained to that trumpet he said if a trump if a trumpet gives an uncertain sound he said the soldier won't know what to do only because he's trained to the trumpet of sound and he said and the Christian Soldiers trained to a trumpet a sound of a trumpet and that's the gospel trumpet the gospel the sound of the word of God the gospel trumpet he said and if one never knew the sound of the Gospel trumpet he'd be a bit confused if he didn't know what the word said and what the word taught just what the church said he'd be a bit confused when he heard the sound of the trumpet he wouldn't know how to prepare himself so we need to prepare ourselves and I'm so glad I have ears to hear you know I was telling them in brother gadson's at South Carolina you know there's been times in my life where I've had to hear things and you I didn't understand what they were saying and I told him I said Lord I said if this is the truth I said you need to show me this because I heard things and there were times that I heard things and you know what he just welled up inside of me and I was just like amen this something just clicks right off the bat I mean you're just I mean you see things and it just makes you just jump up and other times it's just like hitting the wall stop and you're like Lord what in the world and you know what I've had to carry that for years I carried questions in my mind about things that I heard that I couldn't place in the scripture and you know what it only takes the Holy Ghost but you know what it takes being sitting under a Ministry that can tell you these things that can break these things down that knows the word and if and through that then the Holy Ghost can come because you know he can't he doesn't Quicken non-seed he doesn't Quicken confusion but you know what if you have a desire he'll bring you to the place that somebody can show you the word and then you could you'll clear up all the confusion but you know what if you want to hide behind it then you stay right there and you know because I can you know I can still remember the day that the first day that I ever heard them the doctrine of the river of Jordan yeah and I tell you I still remember that day I still remember his on a Wednesday night and I still remember the brother that preached it and when I heard it it just stopped something inside of me and it just it stuck in my crawl as as the saying he is but you know what I couldn't I didn't understand it I couldn't prove it wrong but you know there was something to set inside of me and I couldn't understand it and I told the Lord I said if this is truth I said you show it to me but you know what I held on to that and you know what he showed me that it wasn't true and you know what it only takes sometimes it only takes a word or two and all of a sudden you know the whole Bible will just open up and you see it and I thank God because you know what it's through everything in the scripture the whole the whole scripture opened up that way you know I remember the first I used to read Romans 8. and you know and all of a sudden one day that scripture came open to me and then all of a sudden you know when I read Romans 8 I don't read it as I used to why because I see myself in Romans 8. when I read certain scriptures I see myself I don't see anybody else I see me when the scripture says when he said behold I send you Elijah the prophet I'm not looking for somebody else why because he came to me Glory I see that as a personal right a possession of mine a promise to me it didn't come to nobody else and I'm just as sure as I'm standing here as sure as sure as I'm standing here and in my right mind there's what mind I have I believe if there was nobody else that Elijah to come to he would have come to me I I would I believe he just if if God had to send him just for one he would have sent him for me and we all have to say it that same way that it's a personal possession it's a personal promise a personal revelation to you Lord that we can see what he's done for us and this is from trump it gives an uncertain sound he says a gospel trumpet he said the word of the Living God is the trumpet he said it don't mix with anything you know he said Paul speaking training a man to the sound you know whether to advance or with or withdraw or whichever way he said he had to know that sound right he had to learn the sound and I believe that's what God brings us to that we can hear the sound of the word the word come because I believe that's what happened something don't sound right something stops you yeah you know there's a brother said one time he said there's two two kinds of preachers that really really make me want to study this word he said really good ones and really bad ones because because if you've got somebody that's that's really knows this message you know because there's certain things that you see in the word and it's just like you you go back going back for seconds you know something's good and guess what you want to go back for some more and you want to go back for some more Richard always Richard always said the reason I was so much bigger than him said well by the time I got to the second saren was on the 23rds I can't help but he's slow it's what is what your desire is and that's reason I think there's a lot of people if if the sound of the of the word doesn't draw you or he doesn't cause you to to act then guess what there's something wrong with the sound of the of the trumpet to you because some people you know they say oh this is that's the greatest thing I've ever heard and you never see them again and they hear something and they say well I can't prove it wrong but I can't prove it right and they won't touch it yeah but you know the thing is is people don't know what what a prayer closet is anymore right right people people say well well you know we're just going to find it whatever brother Branham said we're just going to dig in the message and find it you know what the scripture tells us that it takes the Holy Ghost he said when the spirit of Truth has come he'll be the one to lead you and guide you because you know that's what happened a lot of people a lot of people have taken the prophet's message and they and they've read the message but the problem is without the Holy Ghost you'll get it confused you'll be confused why because you were born confused amen and that's all you God's confusion just like just like that man said he said I was born with with nothing I still got most of it left see we got we were born with confusion and it takes the Holy Ghost to clear that up are you going to stay in confusion you can have all the quotes that you want but it takes the Holy Ghost to make it line up because that's that's been the whole problem is people have not taken the Holy Ghost to line the word up and they say that's reason somebody says you know I appreciate brother Dale for one thing you ask him a question and if he don't know he'll tell you he don't know you don't have to hear it you don't have to listen to him try to talk for 20 30 minutes to tell you nothing you know you know I always heard brother Dale boy he was he was intellectual he knew he knew this message it was nothing brother Dale didn't know he would he knew everything well he was he was the he was the message Superman I called him on the phone was asking him one time and asked him a question he said brother I don't know I was like hey I got to write that on my calendar brother Dale I could not answer a question for me but see that's the way people are they're trying to find an answer but you know what the answer is a person the answer is not on on in Pages because if you've got if you've got him who is the word he'll show you what the truth is he'll make it known to you no he says the army war he said it's always been War he said we never joined the church or come into the church to come into a picnic he said we must realize we're coming to a Battleground he said I never come for people to Pat me on the back and say brother about him you're a wonderful person no sir I come there with a shield on I don't need that Shield I don't need a shield for that I come with a helmet and the armor I come to fight fight for every inch of the ground God told Joshua every place The Souls of your foot Treads upon that I give you so foot footsteps means possession right and when the church gets to a place that compromises with Creeds compromises with the word and compromises with the world I mean then it's losing ground it's taking back he said what we need tonight is soldiers to possess every Divine promise of this Bible that God promised to the church the whole armor of God and to stand he said what we need soldiers not get a uniform for a dress parade it's always different so you can always always find ones that are all dressed up and look and look nice but you know what that's not where the work is right you know because they have they have their certain job to do but you know what they never get nasty they never get dirty you know people think and I and I appreciate them but you know sometimes you look at these guys that guard the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier you know the honor guard and I appreciate and I understand they they do a lot I mean that's a difficult job because you know what they're there rain snow sleet tornado whatever is going on they're out there and you know they go through extensive background training and you know they have to make sure everything is just perfect for them to do that and you know if they do anything out of line in their personal life they don't they don't they won't be on the honor guard anymore but you know what that's not that's not the real real difficult job you know because the ones are the ones that are on the battlefield when you go into when you go into combat and you know you you read some of these these stories and and these books of of men that have have fought in and battle and and you see the the great uh the the great odds that they go up against and all the all the things that they and you know what they go right into that right and a lot of people you know a lot of them know you know we're not coming back but you know you know they go in into that and they have this one mentality and many of them and you either go in and under certain situations but you know they say we'll never leave a man behind because you know whatever our objective is he said well I'll die together he said well I'll either come home or we'll all die there and you know that's that's the way they why because they have sold out to that mentality and it's all for all of us or none and you know that's that's the way it is if you're if you're in this battle if you're in this war you know we're all we're all into this together it's not it's not just mine and it's yours no we're if we're all the body of Christ how much more should we be drawn together if these if these men can go in there and they're going to die the death and they're going to give up everything to be together and you know sometimes they say well this is my brother and I don't even know him you know sometimes that's the way when you when you hear about people especially if somebody has a need you know sometimes you hear about somebody that that that's going through something and you know I think why would I would how would I pray if that was me how would I pray if if I knew somebody if that was somebody that was close to me you know because you you think about that because you know what that's that's the kind of person that I want praying for me I want somebody to really think if I've got a problem if I have a need I want somebody to really approach God not just in a passing manner but I want somebody to actually really try to touch the Throne of God damn it and so you know that's the way it is because you know brother Brandon said if we see one that's backslidden you know we supposed to go after them the scripture tells us to go after them you know to to have a heart of compassion for them scripture tells us that that love will cover a multitude of sins you know the scripture tells us he had we that are weak ought to Bear them or we are that are strong ought to Bear the infirmities of those that are weak see we're supposed to be the ones working together to help those that that have a need and not just try to write them off because that's the kind of battle we have we have to fight y'all just pray for me but here so we're speaking of this battle putting on this armor brother Brown said in Divine love and Sovereign Grace he said he said we're just contending Against The Wiles of the devil he said against Buddhism against and the hundreds of idols and gods of the world and I told him I said I said there's hundreds and thousands of gods in the world and America has their own and they appropriate appropriately entitled it American Idol yeah I mean they come up with something that you know you see people that you you think that are you know kind of decent and smart or whatever but you know they can't miss that and then you have other things like Dancing with the Stars you know I mean that just sucks some in you know I would much rather be shouting with the Stars because that's why job God told job you know where were you when the sons of God sang together in this all the stars shouted for joy you know that's where I'd want to be with with that instead of dancing with something no I am a star we are one of the Stars you know instead of just doing all this we say it's something that the the world has to occupy its time again the god of America money and and women and all these type things but you know we have something to contend he said we're contending that there's one true Living God and he's just as live tonight as he ever was he said that we're that we're not here just with a fictitious belief we're not here all emotionally wrapped up in some emotion or psychology or enthusiasm he said we're here in the presence of the living resurrected Jesus Christ who stands with us each night and proves himself to be alive raised from the dead and is here with us now so that's what we have is we have one that's raised from the dead because you know what everybody has their own has their own God that has their own Idol but you know what whatever your idol is is what takes up your time what means the most to you and you know the world is full of them you know it's it's so amazing at the hour that we live in and we how we see how the the world is falling apart and how all these things are taking place but you know what it just tells us that we're in the end time it tells us that we're getting close to the end why because it should be bringing Joy To Us but you know we see how all these things so you know never never in a million years would you take common decent thinking people would be in the in the kind of condition the world's in you know I mean wait because the Constitution that was written that the way you have our have our basis on the Declaration of Independence don't mean anything anymore why because it you know because the laws have become just whatever everybody wants it to be we can just change the law and make it whatever and just wait just wipe everything off and just sweep it under the rug because it doesn't mean any more anything anymore because you know it's come to the point where immoral immoral and acts and Decay and all this type of stuff you know that's what's that's what's being protected by the law but anything anything that you have a moral stand for anything you know what you don't have a right to do that anymore it'll be all of that's being taken away from you that's the way it's got ta either gonna stay in what God's law we're going to stand with man's law why because you're going to have to stand with that here's one of the things that uh one of the things I was looking at was you know Jesus was standing there you know the the disciples you know the the Pharisees and the sages and they all came the scribes and all came to Jesus you know and and they wanted to know they want to say why do your disciples he said why do they uh you know offend our traditions whether they turn down our traditions you know he said they they eat they eat bread with dirty hands you know they're not following our laws all these Traditions all these great things that that we've built up that we've been that means so much to us and Jesus told them said he said why is it that y'all that do away with the with the word of God why have you done away with these things he said why have you why did are you preaching the Commandments of men as as the law as the word of God and see people people have done away with all these things even people that supposedly claim to believe believe the word of God believe this message and they can just wipe it under I'll wipe it under the rug or just put it in the closet and just leave all kinds of stuff but you know what that's the way it's supposed to be why because that's the time that we're living in that we're going to have to stand up and give an account for these things brother Brown said this is trumpet gives an uncertain sound he said the great church is armored by the word he said now when Jesus come did he use that same armor he certainly did when Jesus come to him and all of his strength he said if thou be the Son of God do certain certain things he said it is written right back to the word he said Satan tried him a little higher right back to the word there he remained upon that word showing us an example said first first Saint John 14 13 said I give you an example and that is an example that we should live emphatically we should perfectly put our trust in the word of God and let everything else be a lie there's one thing that's certain God made the promise God's going to keep the promise they say how can this thing happen how can he get a bunch of people together with rapturing grace to go up he said I don't know how he'll do it it's not my business as to how he'll do it it's my business just to be ready for it he promised it's going to happen so how's he going to do it I don't know but but like you said it's our job to be ready it's our it's our job to have faith in it you know he said to put on this armor he said the word is a armor he said he said you've got to put on it he said but you've got to put your trust in the word of God you've got to have trust in your armor because you can be armored with it but you know what if you don't know how it works and if you don't have faith in it it won't work for you he says put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand The Wiles of the devil which is the tricks of the devil and he says you know how can I overcome he says overcome it's a recognize the devil that every one of his tricks he said you must know that he's a devil then at the same time you must recognize him and know that he's the devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that God in you is greater and mightier than he is that the one that's in you has already overcome him and by his grace you're more than a match for him amen that's real overcoming see if you if you understand the the armor then you can trust in that armor sure put your faith in it know that he's more than a man you're more than a match for him and he's speaking of taking on he says put on the whole armor of God you may be able to stand in the evil day having all the having all to do to stand you know that's our day Elijah Malachi 4 said a great and terrible day so we know that we're in this great terrible day it's a great day for some it's a terrible day for others it's how you look at it it's a great day you know everybody asks me all the time how are you doing how you feeling I'm doing great wonderful fantastic super why because you know what I don't care how bad the day goes you know what if you keep telling everybody you're having a great day guess what you'll have a great day because you know what you you make and everybody says well you know what it's just gonna get worse no it's not you got a crystal ball do you know what's going to happen in the future well I just know no you don't you're just saying that that's it but if you don't you say it's gonna be a great day but you know what whatever is going to take place you know what you can even no matter what happens you can see the great in it you see is how wonderful it is you can see the God's grace in it God's blessing in it so no matter how bad it how bad it looks it's a good day like like one fell at work says he said I'm on the right side of the dirt it's a good day Christ the mystery so you know what hey speaking of he said the blood he said church is the blood of Christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood he said that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that baptizes us into the body they reckon they recognizes only his body his flesh his word denomination won't ever touch that it's a revelation she knows it's he said so did even know it but she failed but this one knows it and won't fall she's ordained to it Hallelujah she's ordained not to fall she won't fail she's predestinated to it you know what you're you're have this if you're an armor and you're equipped then you know what you can't fail because you said you're predestinated to it you know an invisible union he says you know you're The Virtuous bride washed in the blood precious virtuous sin sinless Son of God standing with a pure unadulterated word bride word that he Washed by the Water of his own blood that become flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father from the beginning so yeah I don't know about you but I enjoy reading these things you say well you know things these are just these are just leftovers they just get second helpings of them but see it's it's something that's a you see these things it's a blessing to you and so he says he says he said have your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness have your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace you know he says that when he talks about he said having your loins gird about with truth brother Graham says in Israel in the Red Sea he said you know that's the belt that holds it all together your loins gird about with truth he said in the day brother he said there's all kind of ism and fanaticism it's time to gird yourself with truth hallelujah Jesus said I am the truth the way in the life he said knowing where you're standing there it is holding it all together you know brother Branham I was thinking about where brother man and uh it was it Christ the mystery there what he talks about the word to the church and you know he talks about drawing up closer together hey you know he said that brother had to dream about the buckler you know he talked about drawing up closer together being being drawn together being gerd about with truth and you know where in your loins you know in the loins area that's where that's where your strength is you know that in your in the legs and everything and you know that's where you that's where the strength is that's where truth is that's where because if you've got truth you've got strength you know you because truth truth always wins out because you stand you stand for him he'll stand for you he says and then we go run he said having on the breastplate of righteousness he said he said that's the word the word of God in you doing what's right covering the heart the the chest being being protected so we know that you know when you have the word he said you know you want to do right and so being protected in your and and the because you know you know God chose the heart but Satan chose the head to have for the battlefield but you know what this is where you where if you know what as as the scripture says as a man thinketh then his heart so is he so if you have that breastplate of righteousness and it's not your righteousness but it's his righteousness if you're protected by him then Satan can come against you but you know what he can't take that out of you he can't get he can't get through that and the scripture goes on he says in the and he says having on the breastplate of righteousness and he says your feet shall with the preparation of the gospel of peace and he says what is it he says go anywhere go anyplace anytime feet shot with the gospel see and the scripture tells us Luke 10 19 says behold I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you so if you're if you have peace if you've been saved you have protection there then you can walk over all the power of the enemy he said and nothing shall any means hurt you and brother Randall goes on to talk about in Great War and the great warrior Joshua you know he talks about Footprints he said that's possession he said that's what church needs tonight is more footsteps over here on this land he said don't hang around Jordan too long let's get over here and see what we got so that's what it is he said you've got a footstep every time he footprinted on it it was a possession and you know you have to be shod and you know in the Old Testament you know when they got ready to leave Egypt you know they had to eat the Lamb with their feet shot they had to have their shoes and they were ready to go had their staff in their hand why because when they ate that lamb they were out the door why because they were on the move because that was the last thing to do was to after they applied the door to the blood to the door was to eat the word and then they were leaving and that was the last thing that had to be done and that's the same way with us is to be ready to go and you'd not just go anywhere but to make a body change to be able to ready to be able to go out of here and be always ready to leave and do whatever God has us to do but that's the the one thing is to be ready to go to be prepared and brother bam says he says he says and above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked brother Branham says he said this great big chilled the size of a Door of Faith that's what I have I said Thank God it was the size of a door that's that's for me somebody I can get behind the door and so he goes on and that Shield of Faith said be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked so if he comes at you whatever however he comes with out comes against you you have that Shield of Faith to protect you and he says take on the helmet of salvation to protect you see that's where the devil fights you in the mind so you've got a helmet to protect you and he said and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God you know all these other ones he goes through and he always talks about you have defense defense defense but now you get to the one where you actually fight you know because he said you're protected you're protected you're protected you know if you realize how if you're if you're protected then you know what you don't mind going at it you're advancing you know if you if you played if you ever played football and you know and you realize that the guys on the line can hold their own then you know what you don't mind throwing the ball you don't mind running the ball but you know what if the guy's on the line can't hold nobody back you know you're all the time running for your life you ain't got no confidence to do anything but you know the thing is if you if you understand that you're protected then you know what you've got your weapon to fight you're protected so you know you can go forth and take care of the things that the devil brings against you brother Brian says and and taking on the whole armor of God he said you know you've got to know your enemy he said you've got to know your armor he said your armor is the word your enemy is something that'll reason against it he said he said the church and the intellectual Giants he said you'll listen to him for a few minutes and he said he'll have you so far away from the truth you won't even know where you're at so deceiving so he was talking about all these things but you know you've got to know your enemy and how he's going to attack you he said but you've got to know your armor he said you've got to know where you stand and you know that was one of the things that we're talking about David you know when David went up there and you know David knew who he was and David knew what his protection was and you know when he when he went to Saul you know Saul tried to give him armor but you know he told Saul he said I can't do I can't use this he said because I've never proved it he said but he said but I know what works why because he had his own armor which was the word of God which because he stood there and told told him said listen he said there was a lion that tried to come you know the bear tried to come and take and take one of mine but he said I slew him and he said how much more were this uncircumcised Philistine he said because you know I have my own protection because you know he trusted in God he didn't have to trust in armor and you know here's one that you you would have thought that one that was standing there the way he did you would think that all the rest of them especially Saul who were well trained and well armored and all these things they would have stood there in fought but you know what they didn't have their trust in the right place you know I believe and I always said that you know it didn't matter where David threw the rock all he had to do was have faith in God he could have threw it any direction and you know what because it didn't matter because it wasn't David throwing the rock it was God it was God and David was standing all David had to do we said Lord it's not my battle it's your battle they stood there and said how can how can y'all stand there and let this uncircumcised philistine stand there and defy the armies of God and defy the god of Heaven he said he said you know somebody just had to be there and be a uh representative of God to stand there and do the work and God took over and so he was able to slay the Giant Goliath didn't have us didn't stand a chance but you know a lot of people they they look at these are these Giants in the land and they think oh it's it's too big or it's too hard no God just wants you to stand there and and take him at his word and you know what you can overcome so you all the way through the scripture you know the different ones and hey speaking of and uh taking on the whole armor of God you he was talking about people being just fundamental he said you know if fundamental fundamentalism was right he said you know Moab and all the rest of them would have been right he said you know they would have had it all but he said he said but they fail to see that what the children of Israel had and you know we have to see the same thing we had to understand what we have he said you know Moab and Balaam you know they forgot to they failed to see what God had done for them you know he said he said they had the pillar of fire they had a smitten Rock and you know they had the the Brazen Serpent and all these things that God was in their midst and you know he came against them and you know as long as as long as they stood right where they were supposed to be and stayed with the word you know Balaam couldn't touch them but you know what they walked away from their by their own accord to call and Balaam was able to to have them for God to curse them brother said in in the Smyrna Church age he said no True Believer is any stronger and spiritually healthy and Alive than his knowledge of an adherence to the pure word of God he said it's seen by multitudes of examples in the Old Testament so we see all the way through the Old Testament see it's holding on to this word of God that if you hold on to it that he'll bring you to right brother Brown says this is from Lamb's Book of Life he says he said he makes no mistakes he said he wouldn't bring you in if he wasn't worthy he said he knows your heart that's right he knows what you are he knows your emotives he knows what you are he said there's traps all along the road sure the devil will cause you to stumble when you say God I didn't mean to do that God you know it he said you're still perfect because there's a perfect blood offered for you every day in a bleeding sacrifice handing hanging Before the Throne of almighty God I'm so glad that we have that I may not I may not be perfect in anybody's eyes but you know what I have a perfect sacrifice so you know you can stand there and say well I may not may not be what I ought to be but I'm not what I used to be I have something that protects me brother Branham says he said you know he talks about he said you don't have to pet Christians he said Christians are rugged he said he said we need he said there are men and women of God who stand for God regardless of what everybody else has to say he said you don't have to beg them and persuade them and perfume them and baby them around that's a hotbed hybrid plant it's no good he said it'll never produce anything but that's not what God wants God wants us to be rugged individuals he said brother man says and forsaking all he said you can expect the world to make fun of you they're going to make fun of you but you know what he made they made fun of him if they made fun of him they're going to make fun of you but you know what we have an armor we have something that'll Hold Us through all things to make us who we are make us what we ought to be brother Branham says I don't like I don't like to have this one but this is this is from identification 1963 said we've got to take the entire Full Gospel he said we must now being that we have been identified ourselves as Full Gospel people he said let's mold our character he said I love this he said we're invited to be molded into his image that we might reflect his presence and the works that I do shall you do also the life that I live so shall you he said we're invited by God to take him as an example and let our character be molded like he is he said then we let then when we let his character be in us then we have become Sons but having the mind of Christ mind which is his character your mind takes takes your character oh they find it praise the Lord your mind takes you let the Mind Paul said of Christ this mind being you let's let that mind of Christ be in you and it molds the character of a son of God so we're invited to be molded into his image I mean we can as the scripture tells us you know you can you can take this because it's been given to you but you know what if you don't take it it's not his fault he's offered it to you but I love that he's been he's he's invited us you have an invitation to be molded Into His Image we haven't we have this invitation and you know it's so it's so amazing that when you see what you have it gives you courage it gives you boldness he gives you it makes you makes you be appreciative of what you have and you know then you want to share it with somebody because I want the world to know and the world don't want to know the world don't care but I want to be a be a witness so let's stay in this musicians coming I want to be a witness to the world of what he's done for me I want to put on this whole armor and stand in this wicked and adulterous generation I want to be a witness of what God has done and I want to be there the world may may fall apart in the world goes whichever way but you know what I'm so thankful that I have something that'll hold me that I can that I can hold on to right you know brother Brown said you know he said when when your wife died and your child died he said he said did you hold on to your religion he said no it held on to me that's what I want I want something that'll hold on to me and that's what I believe that I have that I have this so we can put this home that we that we can be fully equipped and armored because you know brother random said what what is this the armor of God Amen he said you know it's supernatural he said what is the armor he said it's love it's Joy it's peace long suffering gentleness meekness say all these things and you know what you say well I don't have that you know what you can because you know you say well I have if you have the Holy Ghost you do right right you may not make it may not be made manifest all the time but you know what he'll give you the opportunity to make that make that manifest just like just like man was talking about you know he said he said you know wanting wanting patience and and love and understanding and he said you know I just want I just want to be more understanding and more thoughtful and and more loving and more caring and more patient and all these things like that and he said he said you don't understand how the world how the Lord Works he said that he gave me an ADH child so we don't we don't and then you I know I know it's supposed to be a little joke but they'll get it maybe tomorrow but you know I don't think either one of mine are that way but you know I think that's why I am you you think say Lord was I ever that bad I'm sure my parents are going they might be saying you were worse like they say you have to pay for your raisin but you know when you become a when you become a parent you can see the love of God right right because you know you see what God what God has done for you and you see the the goodness of God in your life what God has done for you and you and you see that you don't you don't understand a lot of those things until you become a parent and you don't understand what your parents have been through right sometimes you think they've lost their mind and then all of a sudden you realize well you caused that it's all your fault right but I thank God that we have a heavenly father that understands and he knows all our needs all the things that we've had to go through I don't know if we I don't even know if we know this song I don't know my Jesus knows just what I need oh yes he knows just what I need he satisfied far and every knee supplies yes
