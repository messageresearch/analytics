[1:59] these things be in you and abound they
[2:01] make you that ye shall neither be barren
[2:03] nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our
[2:07] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[2:10] let's go over to Zechariah 4 says and
[2:19] the angel that talked with me came again
[2:21] and waked me as a man that is working
[2:23] out of his sleep and said unto me what
[2:27] see us down and I said I have looked and
[2:29] behold a candlestick Hall of gold with a
[2:32] bowl upon the top of it and it's seven
[2:34] lamps their own and seven pipes to the
[2:37] seven lamps which are upon the top their
[2:40] own and the two olive trees by one by
[2:42] the right side of the bowl and the other
[2:44] upon the left side thereof so I answered
[2:47] and spake to the angel that's talked
[2:50] with me saying what are these my lord
[2:53] then the angel that talked with me
[2:56] answered and said unto me knowest thou
[2:59] not what these what these be and I said
[3:04] no my lord
[3:05] and the answered and spake unto me
[3:08] saying this is the word of the Lord unto
[3:11] Zerubbabel saying not by might nor by
[3:15] power but by my spirit saith the Lord of
[3:18] hosts who art down a great mountain
[3:22] before his rule I shall become a plane
[3:25] and he shall bring forth the headstone
[3:27] thereof with shoutings crying grace
[3:30] grace unto it and unnoticed
[3:32] is to bring forth the headstone we'll
[3:36] get to it in a minute he's not to bring
[3:37] forth the corner stone the disciples
[3:39] laid the cornerstone we built on the
[3:42] foundations apostles and prophets all
[3:44] right but now he's to bring forth the
[3:47] headstone thereof with shoutings crying
[3:49] grace grace unto it moreover the word of
[3:53] the Lord came unto me saying the hens of
[3:57] Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of
[3:59] this house in his hand shall also finish
[4:04] yet and I don't know that the Lord of
[4:08] Hosts has sent me unto thee you may be
[4:11] seated the Lord that is blessing to the
[4:14] reading of the word as I've said I've
[4:16] tried to bring to you over the past
[4:22] couple of months a story or a part to
[4:26] try to get it connected together and we
[4:28] want to wind up tonight showing that you
[4:32] know a dream interpreted the Prophet
[4:34] said is a vision alright if it's
[4:37] interpreted okay then my point when we
[4:41] get to it we'll be talking about sister
[4:43] Sheppard's dream that was interpreted by
[4:47] the Prophet to show what it would be and
[4:51] he declares that the the dream are you
[4:59] know we call it a vision because it
[5:01] comes to Paes came after that he had
[5:07] preached on the stature of a perfect man
[5:11] you know the sister had the dream before
[5:15] then and then wouldn't brother Branham
[5:17] come forth and preached the statue of a
[5:19] perfect man
[5:19] then she saw her dream and sent it to
[5:21] him and he interpreted the dream to her
[5:25] and it compared exactly that's what a
[5:28] you don't get nothing else remember this
[5:30] that her vision her dream
[5:34] compared exactly to the basis of what
[5:38] the Prophet had been bringing what Peter
[5:40] had taught you know add to your faith
[5:43] virtue knowledge temperance patience you
[5:45] know and bringing it down to that and it
[5:48] comes out to be the same place as the
[5:51] adoption because in the adoption 'el
[5:54] series you would be covering you know
[5:56] how that son is born into the family and
[5:59] then is adopted into the family and
[6:02] that's what we've been trying to lay out
[6:06] here in in doing this and try to find it
[6:09] and seeing that the word of the Lord
[6:12] came to the Prophet in the end time
[6:15] all right now sister Sheppard was
[6:18] worried about herself whether she had
[6:21] the Holy Ghost or not all right she was
[6:24] concerned about that she had a dream and
[6:26] in that dream the dream was what was
[6:29] showing you know that's what I'm saying
[6:31] that she had a dream but interpret it
[6:34] made a vision out of it
[6:35] because she saw her own life by the
[6:39] interpretation the prophet brought until
[6:42] even brother Branham said God accepted
[6:44] her foundation showing she had the
[6:49] baptism with all the ghosts all right he
[6:52] then have as God accepted our foundation
[6:57] as he accepted us or or whatever because
[7:00] if it is it would be in the biblical
[7:03] term and that's what I've tried to drive
[7:07] over and over you know board I guess to
[7:10] a lot of you to think about trying to
[7:13] express about the new birth the seed the
[7:16] Prophet said the new birth is the
[7:17] foundation
[7:18] faith is a foundation of all time that
[7:22] new birth all right if we don't have
[7:24] that new verses he was concerned
[7:28] but God spoke to her and told her that
[7:31] she had it he had except because the
[7:33] water came down to her feet in the the
[7:37] dream that she was bringing alright and
[7:39] in doing that see then it shows that the
[7:43] word is correct he got her answer now if
[7:46] you and I don't get our answer then
[7:48] where we at we were we're we're our own
[7:52] problems trying to figure out our
[7:54] problems and and making it but now what
[7:57] have we been over and over and over what
[7:59] is the foundation of all Christian
[8:02] thinking faith in the Word of God
[8:05] because that is the new birth the faith
[8:09] that brings that all right and we
[8:11] covered how that the in the new birth
[8:13] that is the Prophet owned the flash on
[8:18] the blasphemous names when he gets into
[8:20] it interpreting her dream he tells
[8:23] something there that you should have
[8:25] read over and over that he said the
[8:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost had been
[8:30] incorrectly taught you remember that he
[8:35] said it was then correctly taught now
[8:38] she was worried whether she had her
[8:40] tonight because she was concerned about
[8:42] that she had spoken tongues he had done
[8:45] this he had done that but yet in
[8:48] finishing it up the it wound up to be
[8:53] the answer was in the message the
[8:55] Prophet was to bring because that was
[8:58] what it was remember the poor and the
[9:00] water in and goofed up the other day and
[9:03] said that cutting the top off of the
[9:05] pyramid you just you know bring it to
[9:07] the right one that was another one
[9:09] showing the what I was trying to bring
[9:11] of the seals and things but that's
[9:13] that's what I've tried to get you to see
[9:17] the new birth is the birth of the word
[9:20] right all right see then it's required
[9:24] that you and I have this new birth then
[9:26] it's required now for someone to to come
[9:29] to an end time and finish it all up it's
[9:32] required that we have these virtues is
[9:36] this not a choice or a thought or an
[9:38] idea it's a point that it's required of
[9:42] us to have these all right now whose
[9:45] responsibility is it about having it
[9:48] first off it must be brought unto us to
[9:51] offer them to us all right the Prophet
[9:53] brought it
[9:55] he brought the message remember he was
[9:59] pouring the water in you know in all and
[10:01] it was bawling out you know all of the
[10:03] trash and the things and he said no it
[10:06] no denominational to hold that Holy
[10:08] Ghost they can't do it but when they put
[10:11] the honey in for the brotherly kindness
[10:14] then the rock did hold you know or the
[10:17] you know and and as it did it begin to
[10:20] swell up I guess a lot but it still it
[10:22] held on all right but the water running
[10:25] down run down to her feet so she got her
[10:28] answer do we have the answer have you
[10:35] received the Holy Ghost since you
[10:36] believe well brother Dan I got the Holy
[10:39] Ghost three years ago all right that's
[10:40] good that's well in a good point but
[10:44] just remember if it won't tie together
[10:48] with the word what did we get well then
[10:53] that's why I tried to end up the series
[10:55] on talking about Zachariah and the
[11:00] coming of the headstone
[11:02] because I've told you what I believe it
[11:05] is you know if you don't believe it
[11:07] that's up to you I believe the the those
[11:12] seals is that headstone to the church
[11:14] I've always believed that because that
[11:17] was what the prophet his emphasis to me
[11:19] was made he said well it's this or that
[11:21] okay you go what you want to I'm
[11:24] sticking with what I see in the word and
[11:26] believe in that in the word that if the
[11:31] cornerstone and the headstone is the
[11:33] same stone and come on Church we talked
[11:36] that in the Baptist now don't don't
[11:38] frown up on me about it we talked the
[11:40] cornerstone and the headstone in the
[11:42] Baptist Church because we knew that the
[11:44] cornerstone was there and it was the
[11:46] foundation of the apostles and prophets
[11:48] Jesus Christ being the chief Cornerstone
[11:50] all right and then he was the headstone
[11:54] who what is the headstone the revealed
[11:57] word the revealed Word of God is the
[12:01] head to the church all right because
[12:03] it's the corner of the church it's the
[12:05] cornerstone it's the stone that the
[12:08] stumbling that they stumble that what
[12:11] about being as always try to illustrate
[12:13] what about being out in a football field
[12:15] and you know hundred yards out through
[12:18] there and you got one little Bill Rock
[12:20] right out in the middle of it and you
[12:21] stumble over that rock trying to find a
[12:24] stone because that's what we've done
[12:26] that's why the Prophet said it's been so
[12:29] incorrectly talk it's been talk to us
[12:33] that we shouted we cried we spoke in
[12:35] tongues we've done this we've done that
[12:37] we believed the message you know those
[12:42] things has been talked to the people
[12:44] until they have no foundation to bring
[12:47] it on where could you put that into the
[12:49] headstone you know working at B let's
[12:54] see if the cornerstone is the revealed
[12:56] word
[12:58] then the headstone would be the revealed
[13:00] word what was to be revealed in the last
[13:02] days why I said we're using Zachariah
[13:06] because it'll bring forth the
[13:07] cornerstone he I mean he didn't break
[13:09] the Prophet said this one here didn't
[13:12] bring forth the cornerstone that
[13:14] cornerstone was laid in those disciples
[13:16] he said he brought forth the headstone
[13:18] will you just think about it now that's
[13:21] what I've tried to to illustrate
[13:24] you think how simple it is because that
[13:29] to me is what's the most marvelous thing
[13:31] is to think of how simple God makes it
[13:36] we have no excuse for any doubts or
[13:41] thoughts or ideas of what we think this
[13:45] ought to be or that ought to be because
[13:48] it's what he said that cornerstone was
[13:53] the Lord Jesus Christ walking up on the
[13:56] shores of Galilee trying to bring his
[13:58] word to the people he was the
[14:00] cornerstone right but he was also the
[14:03] headstone and the headstone was what was
[14:08] rejected Lee
[14:11] sure they rejected the cornerstone
[14:13] cousin didn't know what it would or not
[14:15] that's the easier for us to understand
[14:17] but remember the headstone was rejected
[14:19] because there stood the headstone
[14:23] the Lord Jesus Christ the Word of God
[14:28] was that headstone well what would we be
[14:32] looking for in the last day now yours my
[14:35] point that's reason I say it what how
[14:38] many of you've read the seal book
[14:47] I ain't said nobody ain't got it cuz
[14:49] they ain't raising their hand if you're
[14:51] done it I'm just asking you a simple
[14:53] question that's what it's simple about
[14:55] it you say I believe the headstone is
[15:01] the revealed word but do we read the
[15:04] word we study the word or we'd rather
[15:09] read all kind of other things we try to
[15:16] illustrate our emphasize that we need to
[15:19] study the word but is that word become a
[15:24] part of us to work that it's revealed
[15:27] Jesus Christ to us see then asking a
[15:33] simple question how many times if you
[15:35] ever read to see a book but yet I
[15:40] believe in those I declare it for me I
[15:43] don't mind if learning I departed there
[15:46] the other day and the message I believe
[15:48] that's what I've always believed the
[15:51] headstone to the church is the revealed
[15:54] Word what else are you going to make it
[15:59] and if it's the revealed Word then why
[16:04] are we scared to read the word or study
[16:07] the word or listen to the word oh yeah
[16:12] we know everything else yet how many
[16:16] times have we read the steelbook see but
[16:22] somebody comes along try to preach on it
[16:24] and it just people start laying out or
[16:27] start doing everything in the book that
[16:28] is and yet claiming to be the test our
[16:35] head
[16:36] I thought our head was the word we don't
[16:41] get anything tonight get one thing I
[16:43] believe the head of all church the
[16:45] Church of right across is the Word of
[16:47] God
[16:48] now that's the Word of God that's
[16:49] revealed not hid nothing letters on the
[16:52] page many times you've read the book
[16:55] would give you a gold star
[16:57] but how many times have you really sat
[16:59] down and seriously studied and thought
[17:02] about the TAT prophet brought the
[17:07] headstone I'm not looking for a
[17:11] headstone that's resting what that
[17:16] Prophet was said I'm not looking for a
[17:18] headstone the headstone is a reveal word
[17:25] if that's what it is then why would we
[17:27] look for something else
[17:34] but yeah we'd like all other things we
[17:36] like to this that the other and I'm not
[17:38] against anything I'm trying my best to
[17:40] be straight with you they tell you right
[17:46] where I stand because I know that I'll
[17:48] have to stand again one day and I have
[17:52] to answer for the things that I've said
[17:55] that's why I've tried my best to be
[17:57] sincere with you it gets you to follow
[18:01] the word that's always been my goal from
[18:05] day one was to get you to to be
[18:08] interested enough to read to study or
[18:13] listening to tapes but do you
[18:21] do you
[18:24] when what el hELCO okay what's gonna
[18:29] happen when the rook is required that we
[18:31] stand there well I don't have time you
[18:36] understand what I'm saying
[18:38] I believe Church we have night talking
[18:42] about your Lula ain't talking about that
[18:43] I'm talking about the Word of God don't
[18:46] get on all that junk the Word of God is
[18:51] the head of the church why would we not
[18:54] want to study that and read it and find
[18:57] out what it says that is our head it's
[19:04] like telling your husband but you don't
[19:06] care nothing about it because you don't
[19:12] want no fellowship with him but yet the
[19:17] people of this message are so afraid
[19:21] afraid of getting deceived you can't get
[19:25] deceived if you already are and there's
[19:30] no more deception than the basis of the
[19:34] fact that we will not study God's Word
[19:36] and know what it is do you understand
[19:39] what I'm getting here we know what the
[19:42] word is we have the prophets message
[19:48] that prophets message is the head to the
[19:51] church
[19:58] but yet do we honor our head do we we
[20:00] glory in to the fact of our head that
[20:03] he's the head of all time but we'd
[20:06] rather have something else we'd rather
[20:08] we'd rather hear somebody do this or do
[20:10] that we'd rather house something
[20:11] something build up emotional situations
[20:14] or not and you say I'm against it you're
[20:16] lying I've always been a emotional
[20:20] person I just don't put it out well
[20:24] because I keep it sealed up but when I
[20:27] feel on that inside and know what's
[20:29] going home and knowing that people are
[20:31] turning the Word of God down they're
[20:37] rejecting the very head that was
[20:40] declared
[20:45] it's the revealed word why would you not
[20:49] want to study the word well I still have
[20:54] time
[20:58] yeah
[21:00] but what about a church the sister was
[21:05] worried whether or not she had the
[21:09] baptism of the holy God and he said
[21:14] that's why it's been so incorrectly
[21:17] called I don't think she was talking
[21:22] about you know worried about DAR I think
[21:25] she believed what the Prophet was saying
[21:27] right I mean I think you know maybe
[21:32] but yet she was concerned because one
[21:38] said it was this one said it was that
[21:39] one said it was that I don't need it I
[21:42] shouted I cried I spoke him doing all
[21:44] kind of things was made out of it
[21:46] instead of the true interpretation of
[21:51] the word of God
[21:52] what about having you know that's that's
[21:56] what gets me is having God's word that
[22:01] is to be our head and yet we spend our
[22:09] time with other things talk about me you
[22:14] all of us
[22:24] if it was taught wrong back there
[22:29] what does it be and now when looking to
[22:33] people of the message the way they're
[22:34] going
[22:42] a vision came forth he's selling what's
[22:48] a dream you're not listening to what I'm
[22:49] saying a vision interpreted its a dream
[22:54] or a dream interpreted as a vision she
[23:00] wanted an answer do we want an answer
[23:01] are we serious enough to go before God
[23:05] and ask for an answer and be concerned
[23:11] with the fact of whether or not we're
[23:13] born again he gave the interpretation of
[23:21] her dream right the interpretation of
[23:28] the dream was that this man was poured
[23:32] water in and that was the message being
[23:36] poured into the church and it was
[23:39] boiling out all the Trice in the things
[23:43] but didn't the honey would hold because
[23:45] that would be the age of brotherly
[23:47] kindness because that will hold he
[23:57] proved God proved what about it to her
[24:00] that she had the new birth are we
[24:04] serious enough to ask that question of
[24:05] God
[24:09] Lord show me that's what she said she
[24:16] said in other words in the day in the
[24:17] manner of all the things that's going on
[24:19] Lord show me because I've got to have
[24:22] this we've got to have the new birth but
[24:31] there's more to it than this a new birth
[24:33] that's what I've tried to get you to see
[24:34] there's were the misconceptions in the
[24:37] in the days that we're living in the
[24:39] things like I said it's still the
[24:41] prevalent overseas it's saying you don't
[24:43] have the baptism with the Holy Ghost you
[24:45] get all these virtues well cuz they say
[24:50] that's what the Prophet taught well he
[24:52] said you're born again to faith and
[24:54] these virtues are the things that he's
[24:56] required for us to have yes but how do
[24:59] we get them that's what I said I asked
[25:04] the question how do we get these virtues
[25:08] the opening of God's Word the revealing
[25:14] of God's Word will bring the virtues
[25:16] into being
[25:19] you may take a long time but what's that
[25:22] got to do with it we've been 50 years
[25:28] studying the prophets message
[25:37] let's see he was pouring in the
[25:43] messenger was pouring in the message you
[25:46] remember that or did you read blessed
[25:51] famous night
[25:57] he was pouring in the message cleaning
[26:02] up the church
[26:07] and bringing that to the point that God
[26:10] could accept what we have remember when
[26:17] we was in the series they're bringing it
[26:19] over and over you said I accepted Jesus
[26:22] Christ but run said that's all right he
[26:24] said but that ain't it
[26:26] he said if he don't accept you
[26:30] yeah but I tell you what I'll die now
[26:32] you can't tell me coach I accepted Jesus
[26:34] Christ I'll wrap that yeah
[26:37] but did he accept us
[26:46] because that capstone to the church is
[26:49] the revealed word and the profit in the
[26:52] blasphemous night and stature prevent
[26:54] both deals with the headstone coming and
[26:57] sealing the individual into the body of
[27:00] Christ and that was the sisters dream
[27:05] sealed in those things as we studied the
[27:11] Word of God then he can come and seal in
[27:13] those things within us
[27:18] but what if we don't study his work
[27:23] whose fault is it
[27:28] well I didn't know we had to do you
[27:32] didn't know we had to eat the word
[27:41] we'll see how many of he's even Reggie
[27:43] bobble
[27:49] and the Bible be in the Word of God we
[27:54] had we can read everything out I'm not
[27:59] throwing off on nobody I'm talking about
[28:00] all of us because if the headstone is
[28:07] the head of the church and what are we
[28:09] doing we're rejecting our very head
[28:14] how do you think he feels
[28:21] if he feels that I do he feels
[28:23] brokenhearted cuz we got everything else
[28:32] yet we don't study God's Word
[28:41] then we expect our children to some way
[28:48] just automatically become Christians I
[28:50] guess
[28:56] maybe that's why they don't want it
[29:00] maybe that's why our children don't want
[29:03] the message you know what happens I mean
[29:09] some of you now sitting are thinking but
[29:10] when I get it
[29:11] 16 18 years old I'll be out of this you
[29:18] see is it us that's making it that I
[29:22] don't want it
[29:22] have we made it something that is not
[29:25] correct
[29:26] has it been miss you know uncorrect we
[29:30] are incorrectly tall are we telling our
[29:35] children just because if they come to
[29:37] church it's because it's a they
[29:41] participate a little bit of that but
[29:43] they're born again well that's not the
[29:45] born-again experience that's what we
[29:49] should be doing
[29:58] see what's wrong brother branham say it
[30:00] here's what's wrong with the Branham
[30:03] Tabernacle how many of you know what he
[30:06] said it was he said this is what's wrong
[30:13] with the Branham Tabernacle now do you
[30:18] know what he said
[30:27] he said there's two different kinds of
[30:30] faith he said this is what's wrong with
[30:33] Branham Tyburn uncle there's two
[30:38] different kinds of virtue okay okay
[30:42] thirteen if they want to try to get it
[30:45] in
[30:52] they won't you won't try to remain up 13
[30:59] here's what's wrong with the Branham
[31:03] tabernacle
[31:09] then your profits gonna tell you what's
[31:11] wrong with the Brenham top of that I'm
[31:13] gonna tell you that same thing wrong
[31:14] with Loula Georgia all right what did he
[31:21] say it was you see there's two different
[31:24] kinds of faith there's two different
[31:30] kind of virtue they're two different
[31:31] kind of there's natural nature given
[31:35] virtues and you know goodnesses and
[31:37] parts about us right see we're dependent
[31:43] upon the things of it what he said was
[31:47] wrong well I've got that faith huh I
[31:51] believe I believe the Prophet huh
[31:53] I believe everything two different kind
[31:56] look one thinks it's prohibition you
[32:01] remember that on virtue and temperance
[32:04] temperance saying it's not drinking
[32:06] alcohol but did you listen I know I'm
[32:15] gonna say this and it's gonna go flat
[32:16] okay
[32:18] you realize that right I've tried to
[32:20] explain on that is that God don't expect
[32:28] us to be zombies
[32:36] I don't want a bunch of zombies you know
[32:40] Google Cooper
[32:42] no need a woman zombies he want sons and
[32:46] daughters and you know what sons and
[32:51] daughters have mistakes and problems not
[32:57] you remember what we've tried to bring
[32:59] out where he was talking about virtue
[33:00] and he said that's not a virgin life
[33:03] he said not in this case so he was
[33:08] explaining the case the case was one
[33:10] strength then when he got over to
[33:16] temperance he said it's not drinking
[33:18] alcohol not in this case
[33:23] what was it he said that uncontrollable
[33:28] temper
[33:31] we don't think of Christians as a temper
[33:42] I'm brother Dale you sure and yeah I'm
[33:44] just human enough to tell you God has to
[33:50] look over a lot of problems with you and
[33:52] me a lot of things that should have
[33:57] never been in the world you remember how
[33:59] I was trying to explain it about it he
[34:02] doesn't have to use the word virtue as
[34:04] as virginity because that should never
[34:10] have to be talked about among Christians
[34:13] you shouldn't have to be about alcohol
[34:18] that shouldn't be talked about among
[34:21] Christians but you know what Christians
[34:25] are problem
[34:31] we have troubles we have just as much as
[34:34] anybody else no I don't have no problem
[34:38] I don't temper like I said why is he
[34:40] face get all red why is he all puffed up
[34:42] and you know you get all you know soused
[34:45] out and mad and everything else I've
[34:50] tried to be one thing tried to preach
[34:55] from my bottom of my heart to you to get
[35:00] you to see Jesus Christ go to brendham
[35:06] said Christians are the only ones that
[35:09] have sins is it true sinners condemned
[35:18] on a higher level he's just a sinner
[35:22] well I thought we spoke be safe from
[35:24] that that's what's happening you're
[35:26] being born again it's a process that's
[35:33] taking place within our lives a being
[35:39] born again add to your faith virtue how
[35:43] do you add verse you you study the word
[35:48] and God adds the virtue come on
[35:56] but you cease that that's what's wrong
[35:58] with the Brenham Tabernacle there's a
[36:03] nature given virtue there's a nature
[36:05] given temperance
[36:07] all these things are nature given the
[36:12] biggest part of our faith is mental
[36:15] faith now I didn't say that I'm reading
[36:21] all right they can pull it up on the
[36:24] screen cuz that's number 14 the biggest
[36:29] portion of our faith is mental faith
[36:32] Bible by hearing the word it brings us
[36:36] to a mental recognition of God okay the
[36:45] biggest part of our faith is mental
[36:47] faith well look what he says by hearing
[36:52] the word no how would all nobody
[36:53] emphasize that how do we get the virtues
[36:58] right how many times have we said how do
[37:01] we get the virtues by studying the Word
[37:06] of God is that a big secret we don't
[37:10] know how to get them
[37:14] yeah no wonder we're reading here's
[37:16] almanacs to do something else but listen
[37:20] by hearing the word it brings us to a
[37:23] mental recognition of God by hearing the
[37:31] word brings us to a mental recognition
[37:37] and he said that's what's wrong with the
[37:40] tabernacle a mental recognition but now
[37:46] watch what he's saying oh brother
[37:49] if it ever strikes this now watch it
[37:56] there is a godly spiritual faith then
[38:01] what does that faith do that faith
[38:04] recognizes only the word oh no matter
[38:09] what everything else says it only
[38:12] recognizes the word because in the
[38:14] beginning was the word word with garden
[38:16] word was clay I keep on reading and the
[38:18] word was made flesh and dwelt amongst
[38:20] and when the word itself is poured into
[38:22] our faith now where's your faith top of
[38:26] the headstone there I got up here oh no
[38:29] no no get back down where he that read
[38:33] what he's talking about and what's he
[38:36] and when the word itself is poured into
[38:39] our faith our mental faith becomes a
[38:44] spiritual revelation well what if we
[38:47] don't pour it in
[38:55] upon this foundation I listen it's not
[38:58] poured in at the head that's my point
[39:02] you look at it to head things out pour
[39:05] it in from there he said the foundation
[39:10] foundation of your faith and pulling
[39:13] this foundation I'll build my church not
[39:15] a fundamental concept of church joint in
[39:17] a mental conception of that but upon the
[39:19] revelation when them streams of grace
[39:22] has poured into that mental faith that
[39:25] you've got then upon this a spiritual
[39:29] revelation where did the mental faith
[39:34] see faith cometh by hearing and we don't
[39:39] hear how can God quicken it but the
[39:42] Prophet said what he said the holy ghost
[39:44] is sitting in your soul if you're born
[39:46] again waiting on you to bring in the
[39:49] word and he said it when it comes in
[39:52] immediately he makes it alive
[39:58] well see that's what we need
[40:02] but the biggest portion of our faith is
[40:05] mental faith and watch it brings us to a
[40:11] mental recognition but if this coming
[40:14] from above now we're up here you ain't
[40:19] listening come on back up where we was
[40:21] you dig it in you foundation you getting
[40:24] started because just were you working
[40:26] that now he's come up to the top
[40:30] because what was the statement of the
[40:32] making the Chrysler mister I mean in
[40:34] statue of a perfect man
[40:35] he said God coming down through the
[40:39] cross holy spirit now we're dealing with
[40:42] sealing in what if he foundation ain't
[40:47] right you can't jump up get what I'm
[40:49] saying you think well I just gotta I
[40:52] need the headstone I've got it
[40:55] you're gonna have to start from the
[40:57] bottom and grow up then what happens
[41:02] that starts sealing in back down
[41:05] that's your statue of a perfect man
[41:09] there's the man brother Brennan said
[41:11] that would go in the rapture that's the
[41:14] church he said that would go in the
[41:15] rapture but when it's sealed in well I
[41:21] got filled in when I got the Holy Ghost
[41:23] that's sealed in it faith that's sealed
[41:29] in it faith that's the new birth you're
[41:31] sealed in
[41:32] when verse ER comes and then it's molded
[41:35] together with it it seals in that you're
[41:40] going upward one time now when you get
[41:43] to the top if you're listening when you
[41:48] get to the top then that headstone is
[41:50] the same as the cornerstone and the head
[41:53] is what seals it in yes each individual
[41:55] each thing is sealed in come on listen
[41:59] to what I'm saying
[42:00] they're trying to figure it out
[42:02] the cornerstone is at the bottom you
[42:06] take and you each one of those has
[42:08] started to seal it in as you're coming
[42:10] in that's fine but that comes a place
[42:13] when you reach the top that it's going
[42:14] to come back down
[42:17] and seal the whole thing together as a
[42:20] unit
[42:22] hell you got the baptism with a whole
[42:25] ago that's why it's so incorrectly tout
[42:30] but yet we're still toying with with
[42:33] where brother Branham says you're born
[42:36] again then baptized into the body with
[42:37] that man I can't figure that out how can
[42:39] you be born again and then baptized into
[42:41] the body
[42:44] you're born again by the baptism of the
[42:46] Holy Ghost right the new part you're
[42:50] baptized into the body for gifts you're
[42:55] baptized into the body and that's your
[42:56] word for your prophecy for gifts gifts
[43:00] come with the body you're sealed in
[43:04] cause Satan's sealed out what about it
[43:14] pouring into our faith word itself is
[43:18] pouring into our faith our mental faith
[43:21] becomes a spiritual revelation upon this
[43:25] foundation now you're still down at the
[43:27] bottom what I'm saying you said well I
[43:30] don't understand the Prophet you're
[43:31] saying this about the bottle it's to
[43:33] talk listen
[43:37] you're being sealed in as the word is
[43:39] being revealed to you which they'll come
[43:41] a final sealing one day it will fill
[43:45] every fiber of our being the Prophet
[43:47] said for us to go in the rapture we've
[43:51] got something to look forward to but yet
[43:55] it's so simple
[43:56] until we stumble all over it try to find
[43:58] it
[44:06] faith
[44:09] is the foundation of all time
[44:15] that headstone is the revealed Word of
[44:19] God that's why I said it over and over
[44:22] and I'll keep saying it but I've always
[44:24] believed it when I read that seal book
[44:26] the first time a nice I do most of you
[44:28] some of you know my story buddy huh
[44:32] I started studying the message in
[44:34] Brenham oak told me about the seals I
[44:35] said I won't that book cause see we we
[44:37] were good Baptist we note about the
[44:39] seals we'd read the book in Revelations
[44:41] at least we knew a lot about it we
[44:44] wouldn't exactly like my brother-in-law
[44:45] thought that Kong King Kong was walking
[44:48] across our you know being the Beast but
[44:50] we still had our problems
[44:52] but listen I wanted that seal book
[44:58] you're talking about reading any other
[45:03] you ever think about reading the church
[45:04] age book in two days and work for a
[45:07] living come on I ain't kidding you when
[45:12] I said I've listened that I've read six
[45:15] books from the hips two types in one day
[45:24] no the note finally gave it to me after
[45:29] I'd read and I remember try some history
[45:33] in the church ages and who was it
[45:37] smelled chastity of two or three young I
[45:40] read that seal book I read a lot of
[45:44] things that was very interesting but we
[45:48] had talked with some of those things in
[45:49] the Baptists this was to me at the time
[45:52] of reading it was another man with
[45:54] another idea of saying what these things
[45:56] look like
[45:58] and I wasn't making fun of my
[46:00] brother-in-law because that's what
[46:01] people think see some big King Kong is
[46:03] that beast rise up out of the ocean you
[46:05] know and it does all of these things you
[46:07] know I wasn't making a lot of him cuz we
[46:10] had our own concepts and thoughts about
[46:14] what the seals and things were I really
[46:17] enjoyed reading it but there was no
[46:19] nothing to anchor within my soul because
[46:24] I didn't understand I liked it
[46:30] to see a book aside I wouldn't read it
[46:37] I went back to the church age book I can
[46:40] understand in you know brother Larry you
[46:42] stalking church age book a lot years ago
[46:44] cuz he loves that church April I've
[46:49] always said you give me one book the
[46:51] message ain't King getting them more
[46:54] than that one book I'll take Church a
[46:56] book no somewhere others are shaking
[47:00] their head you said no I won't test that
[47:01] yep you don't understand to see you get
[47:03] through the church they flew so where'd
[47:05] I go back to I went back to the church
[47:07] edge book
[47:10] and I started reading and studying and
[47:12] getting down the thoughts of what he was
[47:15] trying to bring the one God the one you
[47:18] know the the no eternal hail is a
[47:19] doctrinal issues it was covered
[47:23] and it was probably I don't know six or
[47:25] eight months I picked up the seal book
[47:29] and I began to read it had become a
[47:33] brand-new book cause now I had a
[47:35] foundation the church age book was a
[47:41] foundation because it was the teaching
[47:43] of the doctrines of the Bible that's why
[47:46] I loved it so much they said always got
[47:50] this one I put it on internet send me a
[47:52] place and show me in the church age book
[47:54] worst concert I put that out on the
[47:57] internet all over the world so just come
[47:59] on I think be an arrogant I'm just
[48:02] telling the truth you sit down and
[48:04] listen and read that it'll have its own
[48:06] answer in there
[48:09] but a random even talks about in there
[48:11] that the raptures don't come on the
[48:12] force severe that's in the church age
[48:15] book supposed to be written before the
[48:20] seals come on but he said no he said
[48:25] it'll come that see there was a lot of
[48:28] things added to and taken apart no what
[48:31] happened we get what I'm talking about I
[48:34] went back to something that I could take
[48:37] it's a foundation that I could follow
[48:40] and understand and read but then when
[48:47] people started preaching the seal that
[48:48] became very important to me and God
[48:53] began to deal with me back there in
[48:54] about 79 and I began to study on those
[49:03] things began to speak on them you know I
[49:09] know that word is the head of the church
[49:15] what that prophet told him no seals
[49:17] covers ever doctor and okay come on show
[49:20] me you want to talk about it let's get
[49:22] on it marriage and divorce revealed in
[49:24] the sealed if you'll ever read the field
[49:25] seal correctly and you ever see that's
[49:29] that fish seal correctly of that Jews
[49:34] that are don't even deserve nothing yet
[49:36] they're given eternal life you see the
[49:38] greatest revelation of justification
[49:40] sanctification the baptism with Allah go
[49:42] and you'll see the opening of the
[49:44] marriage and divorce right out of the
[49:47] seals the DES rapture was revealed in
[49:50] the seals each one of those priests way
[49:53] after
[49:56] yet it would reveal
[50:02] I remember the first time that I struck
[50:03] a cross because I'd read it studied it
[50:05] but I was trying to figure out where is
[50:08] he getting this from and got onto the
[50:10] first seal learn it as they begin to
[50:12] read it the Prophet said it made a
[50:14] statement and I was working on a job
[50:17] that required over 40 seconds out of
[50:21] every minute for me to complete my job
[50:25] ain't kidding you took over Tony's been
[50:28] there some of these know it's a brother
[50:31] college some of them been here that know
[50:32] about it it spice wouldn't it Tony you
[50:35] didn't play around 40 seconds and I had
[50:38] to get ready for the next job coming and
[50:41] I was reading the seal book I'd turn
[50:43] around I'd read and I read all at once
[50:49] it come off that pages he said here
[50:53] stanza ham with a book in his hand he
[50:56] said it out dire about 155 somewhere run
[50:59] in the seal he said out Dyer goes the
[51:01] white horse rider sorry bud that's the
[51:03] Antichrist
[51:05] I shouted glory
[51:08] for 20 seconds so I got ready to the
[51:10] next job you see that stuck with me that
[51:18] first seal open right there to show you
[51:22] have you ever seen the Antichrist ride
[51:24] away from you if you hadn't you've got
[51:28] troubles you still tied it with him but
[51:33] see they eat seal as it begins to open
[51:35] it just opens more of God's Word more of
[51:39] God's Word more of God's Word you think
[51:41] something when I've struck that fifth
[51:42] seal and seeing that God would give
[51:44] eternal life to a group of people that
[51:47] hated he didn't want it that was a
[51:55] glorious time six seals see in
[51:59] tribulation but knowing it wasn't
[52:03] talking about tribulation for me and you
[52:04] because the tribulation we need is the
[52:07] one that might work of patience I see
[52:12] then I come up to it and I'm telling the
[52:13] truth this is much as I can tell it I
[52:15] come up to the seventh seal and I read
[52:20] that seventh seal and I stood against
[52:23] the block blank wall and couldn't
[52:26] understand
[52:32] I backed up laid the steelbook down
[52:36] again because when it when the Prophet
[52:42] said the Seventh Seal is the end of all
[52:44] thing my end was running up against the
[52:46] wall you remember yours
[52:50] when you say end it means the end that
[52:53] means all of it doesn't know and I knew
[52:57] there was something wrong with my
[52:58] understanding God laid to seal book down
[53:03] again picked it back up started reading
[53:10] and I took the dictionary and I looked
[53:16] up the word e ND you ever done that
[53:22] if you ever just opened up the
[53:24] dictionary and look up e ND I'd invite
[53:28] you to go home and try but don't try it
[53:31] with the end like that means nothing
[53:33] else and just means that something
[53:34] that's coming to a position that it can
[53:37] start and unfold itself
[53:41] when that prophet saw them filled that
[53:43] come up to there and it dis unfolded in
[53:48] this couple going on see when I studied
[53:50] about it and iron 82 and priests film
[53:52] two seals it didn't stop I kept on
[53:56] preaching why because it had to unveiled
[54:01] the word end doesn't mean falling off a
[54:05] cliff or running up against a wall the
[54:08] Bible says Christ is what the end of all
[54:13] things to them that believe
[54:16] well you know what if it ends like
[54:18] you're thinking you got a problem
[54:20] but if it ends in the basis that it
[54:23] unfolds to another step and that's what
[54:27] happened in their sealed it unfolded to
[54:29] another step and then when the Prophet
[54:32] said I'm not saying he's coming cuz I'm
[54:37] saying he's here well he might have been
[54:40] the only one in the world could said it
[54:41] but he meant it and it was true now go
[54:48] home and look up the word come
[54:53] you know we looked up the word come just
[54:58] look up the word come when you get home
[55:03] the word come doesn't mean that I'm
[55:05] saying oh they're ready there won't you
[55:11] come to my house
[55:12] that's not the word come listen to what
[55:17] your prophet said he said it's the end
[55:20] of all time that's the coming of the
[55:21] Lord
[55:26] what was it the word come look it up and
[55:30] study it and see what you're talking
[55:32] about
[55:32] it literally means an embracing of a
[55:36] point to where two things have become
[55:39] one it literally means a husband and
[55:42] wife as in embracing to each other but
[55:46] they have become one that's what the
[55:48] word come means
[55:51] we get we're looking for it is the word
[55:53] covenant the Lord's coming probably said
[55:55] he ain't coming he says here but when he
[56:01] said that and I saw that I ain't never
[56:02] taught it since then that he's coming
[56:04] ain't looking for the coming of the Lord
[56:08] I'm looking at the coming of the Lord I
[56:13] see him in his word I see my violin sale
[56:19] he's here
[56:21] he ain't somewheres else what do you
[56:23] need a guard up in heaven hold water can
[56:29] help me you see that's why I said when I
[56:36] saw that then I had no more concern of
[56:38] what the headstone was but you know what
[56:41] back in could study it from Zechariah
[56:43] and Zechariah says
[56:47] the DISA ruble will bring forth the
[56:52] headstone
[56:55] to me that's Malachi for right
[57:02] but you see we're looking for the coming
[57:04] of the Lord looking here the other day
[57:06] was talking about him looking for the
[57:07] rats right I quit looking for the rats
[57:09] for a long time ago
[57:10] cuz I read my Bible the Bible said the
[57:13] dead in Christ shall rise first
[57:16] well I'm looking for the resurrection
[57:18] then the live and remains then the
[57:24] change what is the resurrection the
[57:28] Prophet said your resurrection is inside
[57:30] of you in your spirit see that's where
[57:35] we go with it no oh we got smart wait on
[57:37] the sphere come on you better study on
[57:39] that a little bit that resurrection is
[57:42] not in your spirit of five senses that
[57:46] won't work that'll kill you it's in your
[57:51] spirit realm of the soul of mankind its
[57:56] dwelling within you no divine healing no
[58:09] resurrection that's what's your prophecy
[58:15] no divine healing no resurrection yeah
[58:21] we're ready for the rapture oh I can
[58:25] just hear it there's people that say oh
[58:26] we were there we got caught up into so
[58:28] we acceptance is just ecstasy till I
[58:30] thought the Lord we're just gonna drop
[58:32] out of the sky
[58:34] I hope it happens that way
[58:42] without any what I'm looking for you
[58:45] know what I'm looking for in the coming
[58:47] of the Lord now we don't finish it up
[58:50] I'm looking for the Holy Spirit to come
[58:54] and seal in each one of us into the body
[58:59] of Christ with those virtues dwelling
[59:02] within us listen I thinking today about
[59:06] it see we talked about faith virtue and
[59:08] honor when I talk about love joy peace
[59:10] goodness meekness right that's the
[59:15] virtues but it's love joy peace goodness
[59:21] meeting since the Bible launchers
[59:31] what did he say that was number one
[59:34] coming to you you're a mental faith
[59:38] right there cut right here comes the
[59:42] Holy Spirit coming down into your mental
[59:45] faith and worse a mental faith down
[59:48] tomorrow making it a spiritual faith
[59:51] then the spiritual faith can only
[59:54] recognize the word of God and number two
[59:59] three then you'll have spiritual faith
[1:00:02] you'll have the holy spirit and we'll
[1:00:05] seal all these things into you the Holy
[1:00:12] Spirit covers this from your faith up to
[1:00:18] the Holy Spirit seals you in with Christ
[1:00:21] he's just sealing down at the bottom
[1:00:23] he's sealing the top he's sealing up and
[1:00:25] down cuz that's what it is
[1:00:27] Church it's the Holy Ghost just it's
[1:00:34] been so miss correct we talk to people
[1:00:36] don't understand what it's about what is
[1:00:38] the whole ego the life of Jesus Christ
[1:00:43] that is the Holy Spirit that's the head
[1:00:47] of all times
[1:00:53] I'm just trying to bring it to a close
[1:00:59] think on these lines
[1:01:03] my faith all the way up to the headstone
[1:01:06] I want to be sealed in
[1:01:12] and that's requiring that I study the
[1:01:14] Word of God
[1:01:19] but just remember it's not reading the
[1:01:21] word
[1:01:27] see when God speaks to you personally
[1:01:29] there's where you got something this
[1:01:32] anchored he speaks to you personally
[1:01:35] about something shows you something
[1:01:40] personal at you that's Christ
[1:01:46] all said allotted I now live in the
[1:01:48] flesh I live with the faith of the Son
[1:01:50] of God
[1:01:55] about it do you not
[1:01:59] what about our faith where's our faith
[1:02:01] what is it anchored in that's why though
[1:02:04] they can say what they want to that's
[1:02:07] what I've told you they can say what
[1:02:08] they won't do about brother Branham I
[1:02:09] don't care I do care for their part I'm
[1:02:13] sorry for them I don't care what to say
[1:02:18] the man led me to Jesus Christ thank God
[1:02:24] for that
[1:02:27] then I'm not putting all of my hopes
[1:02:29] just on what brother Branham was a
[1:02:31] prophet no you got your hopes in your
[1:02:35] own resurrection that's inside of you
[1:02:44] something personal
[1:02:51] don't even talk to and you can talk back
[1:02:59] my brother Dale you mean God talks to
[1:03:01] you yeah through the opening of the word
[1:03:07] you talk to
[1:03:12] audible voices that's alright
[1:03:15] I've heard abortion sir like I told you
[1:03:21] when I left that Baptist Church and then
[1:03:24] when I went back by there years later I
[1:03:26] said lord I left that church and you got
[1:03:31] well well it was audible where at what
[1:03:34] it was or my own thinking something said
[1:03:36] when you left I left we
[1:03:42] I believe it I believe it
[1:03:49] the cult has always been that growth
[1:03:50] development right straight toward that
[1:03:52] one that I saw when I was 11 years old
[1:04:00] what about it come on musician think on
[1:04:03] these things I hope you'll take it on
[1:04:07] into adoption and it's auction and get
[1:04:10] it to the basis of understanding you
[1:04:11] know what this message is really called
[1:04:15] it's so wonderful to come forth and
[1:04:19] declare unto you and I that God is real
[1:04:24] he's alive he's waiting on me and you
[1:04:33] adoption times what you probably see is
[1:04:37] if when he can pour in his fullness in
[1:04:41] the baptism
[1:04:44] well I got the Holy Ghost I want more of
[1:04:47] the Holy Ghost the book of Acts read it
[1:04:53] they had many feelings
[1:04:55] they had one new birth but they had many
[1:04:57] feelings every time they gather the Holy
[1:05:00] Spirit would be there and just flirt
