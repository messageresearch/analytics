[21:15] house this
[21:17] morning and um to have that privilege to
[21:20] be able to worship Our God in a day like
[21:24] this amen with having known who we
[21:29] right and The God Who has called us Amen
[21:33] to this great
[21:35] faith that the Saints once hold on
[21:38] to you know we look at these young men
[21:42] who were down there and know you look at
[21:45] them up there you know you're getting
[21:50] holder it start to revealed to me that
[21:53] um I I've always felt the way I felt
[21:56] when I was 18 years old when I first
[21:59] come to the message but now I I realize
[22:02] they treat me like an
[22:03] Helder but um when I I I don't feel that
[22:07] way but when I look in the mirror I see
[22:09] gray you know so I know amen I'm not as
[22:14] young as I used to be amen we certainly
[22:17] thank God for the experiences that we
[22:19] have had over the years and um the way
[22:22] that God has dealt with us amen that I
[22:26] can be of help to the body of Christ
[22:28] Christ I certainly want to do my portion
[22:33] and um you know I certainly thank God
[22:35] for my precious brother Wade said pastor
[22:38] Wade D amen praise God you know I
[22:42] remember one time he was going to go to
[22:44] Oklahoma um to be in that vote and I I
[22:47] went and tell Brother Sam I said Brother
[22:49] Sam never let what happen to brother
[22:51] Spencer happened to you because brother
[22:53] Spencer is always complaining that
[22:56] brother Fraser steal his son so
[22:58] [Laughter]
[23:01] amen so we we certainly appreciate you
[23:04] Pastor and um I say to you you love your
[23:08] pastor give him all the support they
[23:11] they need it we see the things that are
[23:13] happening today the passing of the men
[23:16] of God and um you know when brother
[23:20] Chandler passed I I was actually in
[23:23] Uganda and there's some sisters from our
[23:26] church that is there in London and you
[23:28] know she was saying that you know the
[23:30] pressure that the pastor have to go
[23:32] through you know it seems he had an hard
[23:35] failure so you know you you got to take
[23:38] care of the men of God you know the
[23:40] Bible says God will take away the
[23:42] Candlestick from out of your midst
[23:44] really um you know if anybody ever
[23:48] understand what a pastor go through
[23:50] you'd be running from it you know but
[23:54] but it seems like I've been pastoring
[23:55] now it's going on to 30 years you know
[23:58] so it's a long time you know I've seen
[24:01] many things those who you love you know
[24:04] turn you down and um you know they give
[24:06] you a heartache and all of that is like
[24:08] a parent to your children but we we
[24:12] certainly thank God for the men of God
[24:14] you know I um at Ash
[24:18] Wednesday you know I actually did what
[24:21] brother Brady asked me to do for many
[24:23] many years you know brother Brady is at
[24:26] a state now where he can hear you
[24:28] listens to you but he can't respond and
[24:31] you know before now he he would have
[24:33] responded but you you say something
[24:35] about now and he start way back there
[24:38] because he shortterm memory is just gone
[24:41] until everything is just gone and so and
[24:44] um you you know I I was looking at that
[24:46] experience really you know I I promised
[24:49] brother Brady brother Brady always
[24:51] wanted me to take over the church and
[24:54] that's the church that I come from
[24:56] that's my pastor but you know now I'm a
[24:59] Shepherd myself and I I can't do it so I
[25:02] said brother Brady if anything happened
[25:04] to you I I'll see to the
[25:06] transition and um I I was like the
[25:09] butler that was in the dungeon with
[25:12] Joseph I forget all about it and then
[25:16] you know it dared me that um I I made a
[25:19] promise to brother Brady I'm going to
[25:20] keep my promise but you know um God is
[25:23] so good that before brother Brady got to
[25:26] that stage when I tell him that he he he
[25:29] stopped calling me for everything and
[25:31] and called brother vman and so brother
[25:33] vman is a wonderful man of God wonderful
[25:36] young Minister and um you know so I
[25:39] decided and I went over and I told the
[25:41] church I said um you know I'm I'm going
[25:43] to come and I'm going to preach cuz we
[25:47] need to ordain brother vman Clark as the
[25:50] pastor of the church and you know there
[25:52] were some people who weren't too you
[25:55] know good with it really because you
[25:57] know you know the experience when
[25:58] there's a boy that grew up from you know
[26:01] him when he was in diapers and now he's
[26:04] going to become your pastor it's kind of
[26:06] hard you know for the older ones really
[26:09] but I thank God you know when we made a
[26:12] vote he got 95% of the vote you know um
[26:15] the people were real satisfied and so
[26:18] brother Brady they thought we were going
[26:20] to park him no we're going to take care
[26:23] of our Elder you know and so and give
[26:27] him all the support and you know just
[26:29] take care of his every needs but you
[26:31] know a church needs a man that is strong
[26:33] you know and and that was the experience
[26:35] really so I certainly thank God if you
[26:38] are in Ruth uh this coming week then
[26:41] you'll meet brother vman a wonderful man
[26:43] of God he's a vice principal of the high
[26:46] school in OAS and his wife is a nurse
[26:51] and they've got two children son and a
[26:53] daughter and um I guess he's the closest
[26:57] Pastor to me back home in Jamaica
[26:59] because he passed the church that I'm
[27:01] from you know so I mean we we see
[27:04] transitions really and it's hard to be
[27:06] here and Brother Sam is not here really
[27:09] Brother Sam has been my teacher you know
[27:13] over the years I was telling brother
[27:15] Wade that you know I've got notes that I
[27:18] have 20 years ago you you remember this
[27:22] this was in Manchester you know and I
[27:24] still use them and um I certainly thank
[27:27] God for my ass association with this
[27:29] body of Christ it has certainly helped
[27:32] me and um I I can say from here um the
[27:36] brothers in um uh Western Uganda who are
[27:40] listening to us today I salute you I
[27:42] said God bless you because we had the
[27:45] same teacher and um you know like I tell
[27:48] brother W you you you might not
[27:50] understand but while you are here having
[27:52] church and you're dealing with your
[27:53] local Affairs really there's people
[27:56] different parts of the world that are
[27:57] listening to you
[27:59] that you're you're not just a little
[28:00] church in Lula you know but they're 8
[28:03] hours ahead of us really so they dismiss
[28:05] and they gather again and they're
[28:07] listening to you because they're having
[28:09] church with you really so always
[28:12] remember whatever you do it's like
[28:14] you're a big brother always what you do
[28:17] there are young ones that are watching
[28:18] you and so you got to conduct yourself
[28:21] right amen so we we certainly thank God
[28:25] for the foundation that we have and the
[28:28] experience you know um they we we use
[28:31] the term the Lord give and the Lord take
[28:34] but you know sometimes we understand
[28:36] that not the right way it's not like you
[28:39] give a a child a toy and then tomorrow
[28:41] you take the child the toy from the
[28:43] child no God changes your experience as
[28:47] you grow and and God who know the end
[28:50] from the beginning he understand all the
[28:53] experiences that you will go through to
[28:56] to bring you to that day of the
[28:59] translation and and this is just one of
[29:01] that experience that God has given to
[29:04] you know that which you have received
[29:06] now give it you know and so and so we we
[29:10] we thank God for the experience that we
[29:13] have had and we also thank God because
[29:16] it's God's program that he has changed
[29:18] our experience and now that which we
[29:20] have received you know let us see what
[29:23] we do with it because it's bringing us
[29:25] onto a translation
[29:28] amen praise God and um you know by by my
[29:32] association with this assemble you know
[29:34] I today go to Africa and I'm bringing
[29:37] this word to them the brother Dale
[29:39] always say to me I'm concerned about the
[29:42] change of the body the opening of the
[29:45] word and and that's what we want to
[29:47] preach to the people because there's a
[29:49] message that prepares a bride for a
[29:51] Rapture amen you you know we can we we
[29:54] can take the word of God and we can
[29:57] preach all the
[29:58] uh the the the the fundamental doctrines
[30:01] and all of that really but there's a
[30:03] revelation of the word and and you know
[30:06] we could have been in Pentecost if
[30:07] that's all that we needed but God sent
[30:10] us a voice in the last day and he break
[30:12] open the seal and he bring it down to us
[30:14] really that we can be you know the
[30:17] people that receive Hallelujah the word
[30:20] to bring a body change amen praise God
[30:23] so we we we ought to be careful that we
[30:25] don't bring the word of God to
[30:27] psychology
[30:29] to tell you how you are to do this and
[30:31] do that and so no it's a revelation of
[30:33] Jesus Christ personally to you amen that
[30:36] will change you amen and I say many
[30:40] times if if the word you're hearing not
[30:42] changing you not maturing you it's not
[30:44] doing you no good amen but it must bring
[30:46] you from glory to glory to glory amen
[30:49] cuz we're walking into a change amen so
[30:52] God bless you God bless you I thank God
[30:55] that you are together and that God has
[30:59] changed your experience and let us now
[31:02] live in the glory of that which God is
[31:04] doing really it was hard for the
[31:07] children of Israel to accept Joshua who
[31:11] was with them there in in Egypt and so
[31:14] but it was God's doing you know and uh
[31:17] Moses really you know I mean Rock them
[31:20] in the cradle and take care of of them
[31:22] and cry with them but Joshua had a
[31:25] sword and so and God knows exactly what
[31:28] they had need of let us say God knows
[31:31] exactly what we have need of so you know
[31:34] take care of brother weed amen I've got

[32:17] of the word let's bow our
[32:19] heads our gracious God and our
[32:23] father Lord what tremendous
[32:25] responsibility that you have given to us
[32:27] in this
[32:28] hour that Lord God we must look in the
[32:31] pages of this blessed word and to depart
[32:35] oh God to our people that does not
[32:38] conform to our voices but the revelation
[32:42] of Jesus Christ that oh God you have
[32:44] placed for the people to bring about a
[32:47] change Heavenly Father we pray that as
[32:50] we come together Lord God May that word
[32:54] become preeminence in our lives and Lord
[32:56] God may you fashion us oh God into the
[32:59] image of Jesus Christ it is easy for us
[33:02] oh God to emulate one another but Lord
[33:04] that's not what we seek we we need to
[33:07] become oh God the fashion of Christ oh
[33:10] God that he might be revealed Lord as
[33:13] the Bible declared to us that the woman
[33:16] is the glory of the man that the bride
[33:18] is the glory of Christ bring us to that
[33:21] image Lord God we pray and father we
[33:24] thank you God and we'll give you the
[33:25] preeminence that is due unto your name
[33:28] remember the sick and The Afflicted and
[33:31] those that are without oh God we pray
[33:33] that you would bless them and be with
[33:35] them oh God and Father may we come to
[33:37] that position where more and more we see
[33:40] who we are according to the word bless
[33:43] us now as we look to you and believe you
[33:45] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and
[33:48] amen do you love him amen amen praise
[33:51] God thank you in 2 Corinthians 4 and
[33:53] verse4 the Bible says but if our gospel
[33:57] be here
[33:58] it is hid to them that are lost in whom
[34:02] the God of this world has blinded the
[34:05] minds of them which believe not lest the
[34:09] light of the Glorious gospel of Christ
[34:11] who is the image of God should shine
[34:15] unto them may the Lord add his Blessing
[34:17] to the reading of the word you may be
[34:20] seated if our gospel be
[34:23] ID if this end Time Gospel is not
[34:26] revealed to you
[34:28] it might be because you are lost in
[34:31] other words when we say you're lost
[34:34] you're not forn of God Amen somebody
[34:38] Hallelujah am in whom the Bible says the
[34:40] God of this world has blinded the minds
[34:44] of them that believe not because Christ
[34:47] is the image of God hallelujah but I'd
[34:51] like to bring down that image this
[34:53] morning because not only is Christ the
[34:57] image of God but you know the bride is
[35:00] the image of Jesus Christ amen praise
[35:05] God you know brother B said a Baptist
[35:07] Minister once uh you know said to him he
[35:09] said you know I I can't accept
[35:12] Revelation he said then you cannot
[35:14] accept the Bible because you cannot
[35:18] accept Christ because he's a revelation
[35:21] of God Amen is God revealed in flesh
[35:26] Hallelujah amen therefore the whole
[35:29] church is built upon divine
[35:34] revelation Peter knew him by the flesh
[35:38] Paul knew him by
[35:41] Revelation but Peter had to come to that
[35:44] position when Jesus said who do men say
[35:48] that I the son of man am oh they say
[35:51] you're the Jeremiah you're Isaiah you
[35:54] are one of the prophets because yes he
[35:56] is the son of man
[35:58] but he said who do you say that I am he
[36:01] said you are the Christ the son of the
[36:04] Living God and he said blessed art thou
[36:07] Simon by Jonah you are just a a little
[36:11] Stone but upon the rock of
[36:14] Revelation I will build my church and
[36:17] the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[36:19] against it God's church is not built
[36:22] upon
[36:24] denominationalism it's not built upon
[36:26] theology is built upon the
[36:29] revelation of who Jesus
[36:32] is amen
[36:34] hallelujah amen not who I am not who you
[36:38] are upon who Jesus is he ought to be the
[36:43] central theme of everything that we do
[36:46] Hallelujah in the first se he said
[36:49] Christ is a revelation of God in other
[36:53] words God revealing himself you see
[36:56] Jesus Christ he comes to reveal God
[36:59] because he and God were the
[37:02] same God was in Christ reconciling the
[37:07] world unto himself he said in in
[37:11] otherwise uh you never know just what
[37:14] God was until Hallelujah he revealed
[37:18] himself through
[37:20] Christ amen amen so so show me God I
[37:24] give you Jesus Hallelujah show let me
[37:28] know my God I give you Jesus Christ is a
[37:31] revelation of God in other words it's
[37:34] God step forth and in flesh oh I like to
[37:38] say like this he become God become kin
[37:40] folk to You and I by The Plan of
[37:44] Redemption that Christ can die in your
[37:47] stead because God made an holy law and
[37:51] in that law the wages of sin is De
[37:55] Hallelujah so God said Ain folk to you
[37:59] not an animal not a lamb oh he was
[38:03] called the Lamb of God figuratively amen
[38:06] but he was God in flesh so he was all
[38:09] God yet he was all you and I King F to
[38:14] you so when he died he took your sin
[38:17] upon his body and he nailed it to the
[38:20] Cross oh can I tell you this morning
[38:22] your sin is paid for it's paid for in
[38:26] full you got nothing to worry about he
[38:30] paid it all God took care of it
[38:35] Hallelujah so we exalt him then
[38:39] hallelujah yes sir he's the high priest
[38:41] of our profession amen you know
[38:45] sometimes the preacher is trying to
[38:48] project the seventh angel but the
[38:51] seventh angel come to project Jesus

[39:24] we want to take him out of History we
[39:27] want to bring him as Jesus Christ but
[39:30] there's a greater Revelation when it
[39:32] comes to you yes sir he said in verse 12
[39:36] giving thanks unto the Father which has
[39:38] made us meat to be partakers of the
[39:41] inheritance of the Saints in light who
[39:44] has delivered us from the power of
[39:46] darkness and has translated us into the
[39:49] kingdom of his dear son in whom we have
[39:53] Redemption through his blood even the
[39:56] forgiveness of sin who is the image
[39:59] Hallelujah of the invisible God
[40:03] hallelujah amen amen God is invisible
[40:07] you want to see God you're going to see
[40:10] Christ oh Jesus Oh but we're coming down
[40:14] with it the firstborn of every creature
[40:18] for by him were all things created and
[40:21] that are in heaven that are in Earth
[40:24] visible and invisible whether they be
[40:26] Thrones or Dominion our principalities
[40:28] our powers all things were created by
[40:31] Him and for him and he is before all
[40:35] things and by him all things consist who
[40:39] are we talking about Jesus Christ and he
[40:41] is the head of the body the church who
[40:44] is a beginning the firstborn from the
[40:46] dead that in all things he might have
[40:51] preeminence if we don't give Christ
[40:55] preeminence we're not Christians
[40:58] yes if we put any other image picture in
[41:01] it we're taking from the
[41:04] glory of Christ Hallelujah so when oh I
[41:10] like to say it like this uh on the
[41:12] seventh month of
[41:14] 1963 and on the 28th day the day of life
[41:19] cuz 28 mean life I'm glad I was born the
[41:23] 28th of this month amen the first thing
[41:27] was
[41:27] he said that God wanted to reveal
[41:30] himself to his people he couldn't do it
[41:34] as a great Jehovah God who cover all
[41:37] space Time and Eternity no Hallelujah he
[41:41] could not he's too great to even be
[41:45] revealed to people because it would be
[41:48] too
[41:49] mysterious amen he could that hallah how
[41:53] could that great being ever did begin
[41:58] that after when beyond the cycle of
[42:00] hundreds of billions and trillions and
[42:02] trillions of years of light space and on
[42:06] out into the infinite into eternity that
[42:10] great creature that was all that and
[42:13] still is amen but that he wanted to do
[42:17] he loved father wood amen he for he was
[42:23] a father and the only way that he could
[42:26] express was to become son of man
[42:30] hallelujah what a mystery amen that's
[42:33] the reason Jesus kept saying the son of
[42:37] man the son of man Jesus is the son of
[42:41] man brother Brandon was a son of man
[42:45] Elijah Hallelujah Elijah was a son of
[42:47] man Jeremiah was a son of man named in
[42:51] the world a son of man but Jesus Christ
[42:53] is the son of man Hallelujah
[42:57] glory to God Amen they didn't know what
[43:01] he was talking about many of them but
[43:04] now you get it Hallelujah he wanted to
[43:07] express himself he was is one of the
[43:11] great trold purpose was to express
[43:13] himself identify himself with human
[43:16] being H to reveal himself in
[43:20] Christ Oh Glory secondly he have to have
[43:26] the preeminence in in the body of
[43:28] Believers and Brethren many times we
[43:31] don't break that down and look at that
[43:34] Christ want to have the
[43:36] preeminence sometime pastors want to
[43:39] have the preeminence leaders want to
[43:41] have the preeminence the government want
[43:44] the preeminence uh but among the body of
[43:46] Believers uh Christ must be first
[43:50] person is greater to you than your wife
[43:54] than your children sisters is greater to
[43:57] you than your husband Christ must be the
[44:00] first person in your life Hallelujah
[44:06] Glory that's what he wants to be nothing
[44:09] more nothing less hallelujah amen he
[44:13] wants to have preeminence in your life
[44:16] amen amen his bride that he might live
[44:21] in
[44:25] people every walk you walk every talk
[44:28] you talk every decision you make Christ
[44:32] want to be the center theme of what you
[44:36] do
[44:37] hallelujah
[44:39] amen he could do it that he want to do
[44:42] it in Adam and Eve but sin separated
[44:46] them so now they had to come way to get
[44:50] back again it fell in the Garden of Eden
[44:53] and God waited all 6,000 years uh that
[44:57] he come to Hallelujah the last thousand
[45:00] and in seven Church ages he's trying to
[45:03] do itth and God waited he waited he
[45:06] waited until the most deceiving age that
[45:10] there would be he waited until the
[45:13] greatest Fallen away he waited until it
[45:18] seemed like nothing could happen if
[45:21] there was an age that anything could
[45:23] come out of uh you would think not this
[45:26] one
[45:27] but God
[45:29] waited
[45:31] Hallelujah God know that there's going
[45:34] to be something in you you might not see
[45:37] but God see it Hallelujah hallu Gideon
[45:41] did not see what God say about him he
[45:43] thought he was defeated but when the
[45:46] angel of the Lord speak to Gideon he
[45:48] said oh mighty man of Valor stand up on
[45:51] your
[45:52] feet Hallelujah don't believe the
[45:55] devil's life for your life
[45:57] take what God said about you amen

[46:04] express that Hallelujah and how could he
[46:07] do it only through Christ amen

[46:16] only through Christ all things are wound
[46:19] up in one person Jesus
[46:23] Christ amen hallelujah
[46:27] I just see denominations pass off the
[46:30] scene and everything else just going
[46:34] Hallelujah when I see God's Great
[46:36] purpose amen revealing himself and
[46:39] having first to reveal himself in
[46:41] Christen the fullness of the godhead
[46:45] bodily amen and then to bring that
[46:48] fullness of the godhead bodily into a
[46:52] people hallelujah that he could have
[46:55] preeminence the oversight the leading
[46:58] you know we take 2 Corinthians
[47:01] 5:21 the Bible said he becomes
[47:05] sin you believe that he becom sin for me
[47:09] in other words all my sin is upon him
[47:14] then can you believe the other portion
[47:16] that I might be the
[47:18] righteousness if he took my sin and he
[47:22] gave me his righteousness it's not what
[47:24] I think no sir
[47:27] it's not what the devil tell me about
[47:29] myself it is what God state in his
[47:33] word hallelujah as to believe what he
[47:36] said about
[47:37] me
[47:39] Glory you lose your self-esteem by
[47:43] believing what people say about you but

[47:47] about you and start to walk in the light
[47:51] of what God says amen they say you're
[47:55] nothing they say you're a failure they
[47:58] say you wouldn't amount to anything but

[1:22:58] brother hongoro was sharing with us one
[1:23:00] time and he said they were going to
[1:23:02] Florida to preach and he said I I don't
[1:23:04] know where he got that but he said he
[1:23:06] said to St he said I know a new way I
[1:23:09] found a new way to go and brother Homer
[1:23:11] said he was driving and um he said they
[1:23:15] it was to take them as far as he's
[1:23:16] concerned might be two hours he said

[1:23:21] do you know where you're
[1:23:23] going yep said I know this new way said
[1:23:26] Homer give me the
[1:23:30] map and she looked at the path that he
[1:23:32] was taking and where they should be
[1:23:35] there was no way they're going to make
[1:23:37] make the service they were way on the
[1:23:40] other side of Florida the master said oh
[1:23:44] my you are
[1:23:46] [Laughter]
[1:23:48] lost Hallelujah but you know but all
[1:23:52] things work together for for your good
[1:23:56] to them that love God to them who are
[1:23:58] called according to his purpose
[1:24:02] amen David had some
[1:24:05] pitfalls that when we look at them we
[1:24:07] said how could this man ever be anything
[1:24:11] and God said about David is a man after
[1:24:14] my own
[1:24:17] heart when David took your's wife I'm
[1:24:23] closing the David think that everything
[1:24:25] was all right he put you right at the
[1:24:26] front of the batt and he was
[1:24:29] dead but there's a prophet there's a
[1:24:31] voice that's
[1:24:32] right and gave him a riddle and David
[1:24:35] said bring me that man let me I'm the
[1:24:37] judge here he said David you are that
[1:24:40] man you see the heart of David is David
[1:24:43] get down to God Psalm 51 have mercy upon
[1:24:48] me oh God according we've got to realize
[1:24:52] that we are weak but he's strong
[1:24:55] amen that you've got to take side with
[1:24:58] God against yourself
[1:25:02] amen that I don't want my way I want his
[1:25:08] way but you know that wasn't the hardest
[1:25:12] thing in the eyes of God that David
[1:25:14] did when go David number
[1:25:19] Israel when he number the people you see
[1:25:23] there was a way that that God have that
[1:25:26] he should take the census of the people
[1:25:28] and in that census every man was to pay
[1:25:32] after shakle the Bible says that you die
[1:25:35] not goded a way it was a type of
[1:25:40] redemption that God was showing that the
[1:25:42] price that was paid for your life is the
[1:25:44] same price paid for
[1:25:46] mine and I want to tell you this morning
[1:25:49] don't think that your salvation is
[1:25:50] better than mine the price that was paid
[1:25:53] for mine is the same price that is paid
[1:25:55] for
[1:25:57] yours that was what
[1:25:59] God but when David
[1:26:01] thought that if he knew the number of
[1:26:05] Israel then he might be Mighty in battle
[1:26:09] God did not accept that God wants you to
[1:26:12] know every day of your life that it's
[1:26:14] not because of you it's because of
[1:26:19] him so we know that all things work
[1:26:23] together for our good to them that love
[1:26:27] God to them who are called according to
[1:26:30] his purpose for whom he did forn or

[1:27:47] contained within the Seven Seals amen
[1:27:50] and in that mystery Hallelujah you see
[1:27:54] Revelation 101 was the announcement but
[1:27:58] Revelation 81 was the
[1:28:00] scene and in that scene when the mighty

[1:32:00] sit around the beach and no it's a
[1:32:03] battle it's a fight and listen we've
[1:32:06] been given the greatest thing to fight

[1:32:11] I told y'all many times before the devil
[1:32:13] cannot get eternal life but you can
[1:32:16] right be privileged to know that God has
[1:32:18] opened up enough a door for uterus Eve
[1:32:21] eternal life and the devil can't get it

[1:32:26] Satan can't he can oh he bother
[1:32:28] you but he can't take
[1:32:31] hold CU you got God in you and he hates
[1:32:36] that God's in us and he can't do
[1:32:38] anything about it but that's all right
[1:32:40] he made his choice long long time ago he
[1:32:44] made his choice to become Satan God
[1:32:47] created
[1:32:48] imperfect I was thinking the other day I
[1:32:50] thought man you know when we come to
[1:32:54] Earth we're born and a soul comes into
[1:32:57] us and we really don't know anything
[1:32:59] about it you know what's going on till
[1:33:00] we're five or 6 years old we don't
[1:33:02] remember a whole lot of things and then
[1:33:03] we start developing and we realized that
[1:33:05] my name's Bob or my name's this or my
[1:33:07] name's that right but the devil was
[1:33:10] created just like he wasn't and then he
[1:33:13] came from
[1:33:15] God am I preaching to a different place
[1:33:18] group of people he just was there and he
[1:33:22] developed right there and God developed
[1:33:24] him full grown give him something to
[1:33:27] do made him the anointed cherub I made
[1:33:30] you perfect he kept telling him I made
[1:33:32] you all these things but you know what
[1:33:34] the difference in him and us we believed
[1:33:36] what God Said and we stayed in our
[1:33:39] position he didn't believe what the very
[1:33:41] man that created
[1:33:43] him he didn't believe what he said but
[1:33:46] we do as the Bride of Jesus Christ we
[1:33:47] had to come across this Chasm we had to
[1:33:49] come here lost we had to come here in
[1:33:51] these bodies but guess what that's way
[1:33:53] God wanted it he didn't want it no other
[1:33:55] way no other way than to express himself
[1:33:58] through us and I believe that's why
[1:34:00] brother Bram came and gave us a message
[1:34:02] to see who we are and what we're doing
[1:34:06] here and why we're here don't ever sit
[1:34:09] around and say why am I here
[1:34:12] realize realize who you are Hallelujah
[1:34:16] realize why you're here realize why

[1:34:21] tests and
