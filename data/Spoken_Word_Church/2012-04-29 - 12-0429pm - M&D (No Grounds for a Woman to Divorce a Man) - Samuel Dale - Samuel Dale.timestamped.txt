[16:45] to an almighty God who can take care of
[16:47] all things we love you and we thank you
[16:49] and we commit everything to you now in
[16:52] Jesus name
[16:55] Matthew 19.
[16:59] the Pharisees also came unto him
[17:01] tempting him and saying unto him is it
[17:04] lawful for a man to put away his life
[17:05] forever cause now when we get down to
[17:07] that see or nowhere just for anything
[17:09] all right
[17:11] and he answered and said them to them
[17:13] have you not read that he which made
[17:16] them at the beginning made them male and
[17:18] female
[17:19] see he didn't even put up with what they
[17:22] had asked him
[17:24] you didn't even comment on what they'd
[17:27] asked him for any cause you know
[17:30] he just went straight to the point all
[17:32] right
[17:33] I said for this call shall a man leave
[17:35] his father and mother and shall cleave
[17:37] to his wife and they twain shall be one
[17:39] flesh wherefore there are no more
[17:41] claimed but one flesh but therefore God
[17:43] hath joined together let no man put
[17:45] asunder
[17:47] they say unto him why did Moses then
[17:49] command the command to give a writing a
[17:52] divorcement and to put her away
[17:54] he accept unto them
[17:56] Moses because of the hardness of your
[17:58] heart suffered you to put away your
[18:00] wives but from the beginning it was not
[18:02] so and I say unto you whosoever shall
[18:05] put away his wife accepted me for
[18:06] fornication
[18:08] and she'll marry another committeth
[18:09] adultery and whoso married her which is
[18:13] put away from both just commit adultery
[18:15] the disciples say unto them
[18:19] if the case of the man be so with his
[18:22] wife is it it is not good to marry
[18:27] but he said unto them all men cannot
[18:30] receive this saying say they to whom it
[18:33] is given you may be seeing the door that
[18:36] is blessing to the reading of the word
[18:39] no
[18:42] I went ahead and ran off
[18:45] the uh
[18:47] the definitions that we gave this
[18:49] morning and we won't go back through
[18:51] them but we will try to cover and just
[18:53] quote some of it as we go along but we
[18:56] gave the I just gave you the definitions
[18:58] of the the wordings and the things that
[19:01] we were talking about how the word
[19:02] divorce the worst divorcement and the
[19:06] word divorce is used
[19:09] but I hope you understand because I try
[19:11] to make a statement up front basically
[19:14] and come back and try to explain that
[19:16] point prove that point show the point
[19:19] and you know understand
[19:21] about it
[19:24] now we covered you know what is a
[19:26] marriage
[19:28] or what constitutes a marriage
[19:31] and we saw that it was when that you
[19:33] would become engaged or spoused or
[19:35] betrayal whatever the word that you
[19:37] would use there to make your commitment
[19:40] one to the other or in other words the
[19:43] boy asked the girl to marry him and she
[19:46] accepts again in God that is a wedding
[19:50] we are not to go then and just start
[19:53] living together because that would be
[19:55] fornication and getting into the wrong
[19:59] thing all right you said well they're
[20:01] married you know well that's true but we
[20:03] gave where the Prophet said the the law
[20:06] gives you the right to live together so
[20:08] that puts the answer to that you know
[20:10] don't get into the silliness of life you
[20:13] know in things all right
[20:15] now
[20:17] and as we covered that then this morning
[20:19] we tried to cover
[20:21] what is a divorce
[20:25] and you know
[20:27] I want to read you just a little bit and
[20:30] just pick up a few things and then we'll
[20:31] continue on into the point this
[20:33] afternoon
[20:34] so if a marriage is the value made you
[20:38] know
[20:39] you ask the girl and she accepts and
[20:42] that's a constitutional wedding
[20:44] then what would be the divorce
[20:47] it would be to dismiss or we gave the
[20:50] definitions we'll give them back again
[20:52] in a minute of where the word
[20:54] divorcement dismissal and and to be put
[20:57] away and all of the things all right
[20:59] then uh it would be to take that vow
[21:03] back
[21:04] because that's really what you would do
[21:06] if you went down to the law you would go
[21:08] to the law and say I want a divorce
[21:10] all right and they'd say well okay you
[21:13] know they want the grounds they want
[21:14] this out of the other but then they
[21:17] would say okay what is it so well I I
[21:20] married this woman or married this man
[21:23] and now I want to be divorced in other
[21:26] words the the the lawyer or whatever who
[21:29] you talk to or a judge or something he
[21:31] wouldn't say you mean you want to take
[21:33] your vows back because that wouldn't be
[21:34] his wording he would just say you mean
[21:37] you're wanting a divorce
[21:39] but in his definition of the word
[21:41] divorce if you ask him then he would be
[21:44] giving the words that we gave this
[21:46] morning to cover of what a divorce is
[21:49] and and then you would be saying you
[21:52] know uh I want to take back my vow
[21:56] I want to erase from the records
[22:00] of courts or whatever you know Etc if
[22:03] he's in another country they'd be doing
[22:04] it with this or that or the other or
[22:06] whatever you know dealing with would you
[22:09] say I'm wanting to reverse my vows
[22:12] I'm wanting to take them back
[22:15] I'm wanting to be separated from this
[22:17] person
[22:19] you know by the legality of the law
[22:23] and we've already went so long and
[22:25] there's so many things in the in all of
[22:27] that until it's amazing how they cover I
[22:30] think it's in the law of Georgia that
[22:33] um you've got to be separated for so
[22:35] long before you can apply for a divorce
[22:37] because they want to uh make sure
[22:41] there's no way of making restitution you
[22:44] know
[22:45] Etc all right but
[22:47] then it would be to reject your vows
[22:50] or to deny your vows
[22:53] but take a while back
[22:56] see that be what you would be doing
[22:58] doing with your legality of paperwork
[23:01] three you would be taking back your vows
[23:04] that you made all right is that simple
[23:07] enough
[23:08] even that would be constituted when they
[23:10] would write it up and call it a divorce
[23:12] or a divorcement or whatever you know
[23:14] would would be uh the point of doing it
[23:17] all right now we went through as I said
[23:20] I don't want to repeat all of this but I
[23:22] gave you these and you don't have to
[23:24] read them to nothing but I just will
[23:25] scan through and give a couple to to
[23:27] make sure and and that way brother Joe's
[23:30] putting them on the Internet so it would
[23:32] be on there from like this morning so we
[23:35] found the word divorce is only used one
[23:37] time in the Bible using Jeremiah 3 and
[23:40] 8. and it is used there and the number
[23:44] is 37.48
[23:46] and it would be divorce dismissal or
[23:48] divorcement right so it would be a
[23:51] dismissal
[23:52] of your vow
[23:53] you would be taking back your value be
[23:56] dismissing it all right the New
[23:58] Testament for uh the old that's the only
[24:00] one on divorce all right now when it
[24:03] comes to the word divorcement it is used
[24:05] three times the Old Testament and I
[24:07] think three times in the new and it's
[24:10] the same number 37 48
[24:13] as the word divorce all right so then
[24:16] what that divorcement
[24:18] the you would be writing her a bill of
[24:21] divorcement Deuteronomy 24 1-3
[24:24] you know or Isaiah you would be talking
[24:26] about a a mother's divorcement
[24:30] which would mean the same word as
[24:32] divorce dismissal or divorcement of the
[24:35] 37 48 all right so then you would be
[24:38] coming down with the same meaning of the
[24:41] word
[24:42] all right now at the end of the word
[24:44] divorcement in the New Testament
[24:47] um like in Matthew where it says let him
[24:49] give her writing a divorcement or what
[24:50] we just read in Matthew 19 they didn't
[24:54] give her writing a divorcement to put
[24:55] her away you'll find that that word then
[24:58] would mean to divorcement writing a
[25:00] divorcement uh
[25:02] the word repudiation and we gave the
[25:05] definition of that I'm doing this where
[25:07] did somebody pick a tape and come back
[25:09] our people here I want it in your mind
[25:13] you think you know all about it
[25:15] maybe you don't
[25:18] maybe you need to listen maybe all of us
[25:20] needs to listen I was asked kind of a
[25:22] question at lunchtime about the uh
[25:27] brother Brown and the man's
[25:30] daughter that you know that where Billy
[25:32] Paul was married and and they had it
[25:34] annulled
[25:36] well
[25:37] why didn't the fathers
[25:40] why didn't the father or the girl come
[25:42] up with the fact of saying well I
[25:44] disallow The Vow so if you've had
[25:46] scripture
[25:47] I don't know
[25:49] I know they didn't
[25:51] and a little brother around said she was
[25:52] married I mean he was married
[25:55] so then the word of nulled and divorce
[25:58] is the same word
[26:00] so that it wouldn't be that a normal
[26:02] could be running this way it's just a
[26:04] terminology a wordy but it's the same
[26:08] word a null and divorce is the same word
[26:10] so then I don't have the answer to
[26:12] knowing why that they didn't come up
[26:14] with that unless maybe they didn't uh
[26:16] understand it I don't know
[26:19] I don't know why they didn't say well
[26:20] let's just have it let the fathers break
[26:23] the vow of the daughter I don't know
[26:26] I don't know but I just know that it
[26:28] didn't happen that away and they wound
[26:30] up with having to get an annulment and
[26:33] and through the word divorce all right
[26:35] now because the repudiation is to take
[26:38] back your vows which is the word
[26:40] divorcement take back your vows by
[26:43] legality of the law or authority and
[26:46] taking it back and not doing all right
[26:48] then we went on to the word divorced
[26:51] and the word divorce in the Old
[26:53] Testament is the word to drive out to
[26:56] expel cast out drive away divorce put
[26:58] away thrust away uh trouble Castaway all
[27:02] right and it's I gave you those
[27:04] definitions 16. 40
[27:08] 16 40 something and I I can't even see
[27:10] my own I got so many marks around it but
[27:13] that is in 1644. that is in the Old
[27:15] Testament that we used in in the
[27:18] scripture and her divorcement all right
[27:21] then we went on to bringing that word
[27:23] divorcement into the New Testament from
[27:26] Matthew 5 32 and we found out that that
[27:29] word there was the number 63 630 and it
[27:33] would mean to release to put away to
[27:35] send away to let go and set it to
[27:37] Liberty let depart and dismiss and
[27:39] nothing so it would be putting away
[27:43] so the word divorce is putting away
[27:46] and it's used you know in a lot of ways
[27:49] a lot of times are in the scriptures
[27:51] to put away see to put away your wife
[27:53] put her away because it was used where
[27:56] that it was
[27:57] um you know Joseph
[27:59] uh if you're not taking them to the
[28:00] American Wife but he was willing to put
[28:02] her away see the word is there put her
[28:05] away all right meaning that it's showing
[28:09] that how that you would be separating
[28:11] the two
[28:12] the man would be putting away all right
[28:15] and it would be making uh to the basis
[28:18] of showing the truth of it all right now
[28:22] so I hope everybody understands and
[28:24] follows that point
[28:25] a marriage is when you ask in The Boy
[28:28] The Boy asked the girl and she accept
[28:31] a divorce is when you go and try to
[28:33] reverse that
[28:34] because you're going to go do it with
[28:36] somebody else
[28:38] enjoyed that scene really caught I
[28:40] didn't know you could do that
[28:42] but you know reverse the thing and take
[28:45] it back all right
[28:47] all right
[28:48] because like I said you're going to go
[28:50] back down you're going to get married
[28:51] you're going to make some more vows
[28:52] again and do this so it would be to take
[28:55] it away that's the Simplicity I'm trying
[28:58] to make these wordings as simple you
[29:00] think that I'm just running it in an
[29:02] intellectual form this way I'm trying to
[29:04] make it as simple
[29:06] but showing that that's what the meaning
[29:08] of it is
[29:09] all right see then you can't argue the
[29:11] meaning about what it's doing you can
[29:13] only think about the thing now we're
[29:16] going to get into one this afternoon
[29:19] that is very touchy
[29:21] okay so then as we would use these
[29:24] definitions to decide the things and to
[29:28] do we're going to get into one this
[29:30] afternoon that is I say a very touchy
[29:33] one
[29:34] because there is no this is Brother
[29:36] Dale's statement and we'll go through
[29:38] the prophet and we'll go through the
[29:39] Bible
[29:40] there is no grounds whatsoever
[29:43] that a woman can divorce a man that's
[29:45] right there's no scriptural ground now
[29:48] the law out here tells you this and
[29:49] everybody tells you this and I asked the
[29:51] preacher's problem this message to tell
[29:53] you anything where you want to tell you
[29:54] but
[29:55] you know I'm just going to tell it like
[29:57] I believe it and believe it I can prove
[29:59] it by the prophet and if it is it'll be
[30:01] what he said and it won't be what I've
[30:03] got to say about it there's no grounds
[30:05] so now the reason is is because you were
[30:09] the ones that brought the cup The Pride
[30:10] right see now that you say well you're
[30:14] just an old chauvinist Pig you know
[30:16] you're against women now anybody that's
[30:19] been around here long enough for
[30:20] brothers they don't know is better than
[30:21] that all right you you sister is no
[30:24] better than that you know I have
[30:25] defended you to the letter of all things
[30:28] to try to bring the truth about a true
[30:31] wife a true wife the prophet said
[30:33] there's nothing God could give you
[30:34] greater outside of Salvation than a real
[30:37] true wife that's right A woman has a
[30:39] great position that's right
[30:41] and that she is not only that but she
[30:43] was chosen to bring forth Jesus Christ
[30:46] into the world that's right all right
[30:49] but still that doesn't do away with the
[30:51] problem right the problem of marriage
[30:54] and divorce there would be no such thing
[30:55] as divorce had it not been for the fall
[30:58] in the garden right that's why I ask you
[31:01] to read marriage and divorce and read
[31:03] invisible Union and think on it on that
[31:06] line
[31:07] now sisters we're not against you
[31:09] beating you down hammering you with this
[31:12] that or the other we're just trying to
[31:14] tell what the Bible has to say right
[31:16] there is no grounds whatsoever
[31:19] for a woman to divorce her husband right
[31:21] now I can show you and we will as we go
[31:24] along that
[31:25] and Paul even covers that if she does
[31:28] depart
[31:30] me let her remain single but he covers
[31:33] and she does depart
[31:34] now if a man is beating you if a man is
[31:37] to retreating you wrongly
[31:40] and harming you you do not have to live
[31:43] with that person that's right
[31:44] all right
[31:47] is that plain enough or anybody there on
[31:49] the internet you don't have to put up
[31:50] with garbage that's what people have
[31:52] tried to prove this yes you've got to do
[31:53] that you got you no no
[31:56] well I got scriptures well you got
[31:58] scripture but you ain't got sense
[32:00] but a little sense when you scripture
[32:02] and find out what God's talking about
[32:04] amen
[32:05] a man is treating a woman wrong right
[32:08] around says you are to be under
[32:10] subjection to him in all things except
[32:12] what right if he tries to hinder you in
[32:16] your spirituality do you need those
[32:18] quotes
[32:19] if you do contact me I'll be glad to
[32:22] give them to you
[32:23] that if he treats he tells her she can't
[32:26] go to church
[32:28] he tells her she can't do this or can't
[32:30] serve God
[32:31] all right now sisters you don't that's
[32:33] that's he's not your head at that point
[32:36] but it's like I've told you with her if
[32:39] your husband is not a believer
[32:42] it don't give you a right to be a a an
[32:46] arrogant when I can say well bless God I
[32:49] he you just don't we don't believe a lot
[32:51] and I ain't gonna cook for you and worse
[32:53] for you now you're out of your place and
[32:55] you ain't a Christian that's right close
[32:57] enough anybody needed enough definition
[32:59] to what Rotterdam means on that
[33:02] if you don't act like a Christian you're
[33:04] not a Christian right amen the woman
[33:06] that won't work and and do and clean the
[33:08] house and and and cook and and things
[33:11] like that to help in the family that
[33:13] don't tell me you're a Christian now
[33:15] we're not talking about if you're
[33:16] disabled
[33:18] right we're talking about what ought to
[33:20] be done
[33:23] you heard me tell that sister that time
[33:25] that two of them at that time was here
[33:27] and they drove five hours getting home
[33:29] and I said that there's still one thing
[33:31] when you get home and your husband said
[33:33] I'd like to have something to eat
[33:36] you go get him something to eat
[33:38] because he's your husband right
[33:41] don't say well bless God I've been in
[33:43] the chair
[33:45] he'd probably saying I would if I was
[33:47] the man I'd say well you need to go back
[33:49] because it didn't do you any good
[33:53] now we're going
[33:57] women get in your place and do what
[34:00] you're supposed to do as a wife
[34:04] you know okay no
[34:06] because we will get down to where
[34:07] brother random does build some rides
[34:10] that's right sure all right yep
[34:13] how many quotes do you want on where
[34:15] there's a woman cuts are higher a man
[34:18] has a right to divorce her yep
[34:22] now we know where all the quotes go and
[34:25] we know there's another one that goes in
[34:27] there and says she there's two of them
[34:29] now I found two but it says he can't
[34:31] remarry that's right because of cutting
[34:33] the heart but he can divorce you for
[34:35] cutting her that's right
[34:37] now we'll get down to those things so
[34:40] he's quoting scriptures so you don't
[34:42] have to argue with brother random on
[34:43] those things you know when we get to it
[34:45] I'm just trying to make a point to you
[34:47] that there's no grounds whatsoever for a
[34:50] woman to be able to divorce her husband
[34:51] right so what would you happen to them
[34:54] what would happen in her situation to
[34:56] where that the husband he doesn't Supply
[34:58] the family
[35:00] I told you we would try to cover
[35:02] everything we could in the natural
[35:04] and if there's anything you want me to
[35:05] cover look just write it down and I'll
[35:07] try my best to
[35:09] but say he won't go out and work for a
[35:11] living
[35:12] now that everybody thinks wrong about it
[35:14] but Ku Klux Klan wasn't developed to
[35:16] beat up the black people right it was
[35:19] used beating up the black people but it
[35:21] wasn't made for that it was made to beat
[35:22] up the source rock that wouldn't work
[35:24] for a living
[35:27] amen that was worse I don't want to be
[35:30] black white green yellow or brown
[35:31] whatever you want to call it all right
[35:36] but you see this
[35:38] maybe we need to do that sometimes we
[35:40] could do away with some of the welfare's
[35:42] and the social securities if we did a
[35:44] little bit of that today but that's all
[35:46] right we can't still do it right but
[35:48] suppose he won't take care of the family
[35:50] I mean he won't he won't work
[35:54] you don't have to go get a divorce you
[35:56] can go down and get a legal separation
[36:00] and you can demand that he make child
[36:02] payment sure
[36:05] amen right and you can have him arrested
[36:08] if he doesn't yep
[36:10] so then brother Dale's not a garbage can
[36:12] of talking you know that the mail shovel
[36:14] old brother
[36:17] no
[36:21] it doesn't matter whether he's a
[36:22] Christian or not if he don't make a
[36:24] living heart then somebody ought to
[36:26] straighten him up and make him do what's
[36:27] right whether it takes the law or
[36:30] whatever you want to do with it
[36:32] all right you make it I know dear
[36:34] actually used to maybe I shouldn't say
[36:36] it and I won't use the name about the
[36:37] formal people but he used to work he
[36:40] used to own the place and and people
[36:42] worked there and they were from a
[36:43] foreign country and where they were from
[36:45] they just beat their wives up
[36:47] when they don't want to you know
[36:49] I told him I said if you want a little
[36:51] help I'm happy
[36:52] I said the next one comes in and beat
[36:54] his wife up we'll take him out behind
[36:56] the building
[36:59] you're a preacher
[37:01] yeah funny one too
[37:06] I just believe in living right doing
[37:08] right
[37:09] I believe in men beating over women in
[37:12] garbage can is not you know that he's
[37:14] the porterhouse of course that's
[37:16] achievement now with porterhouse steak
[37:17] you know or something he's a porterhouse
[37:20] steak and she's a piece of baloney or
[37:22] something
[37:23] we don't believe in nothing like that
[37:25] amen all right we believe in being right
[37:27] okay but still that doesn't change
[37:30] anything
[37:32] that's right she has no right to divorce
[37:35] it
[37:36] because there's no way to be done how
[37:38] could you do it
[37:39] by what Authority would you use to
[37:42] declare a divorce for a woman
[37:47] now the course of the land
[37:48] is different okay we're not talking
[37:50] about that we're talking about Bible
[37:51] terminologies right
[37:54] all right so that wouldn't turn out to
[37:56] be the right thing would it
[37:58] all right
[37:59] so let's just go down through some of it
[38:02] and just see
[38:04] go ahead brother Joe or this is who's
[38:06] making her name brother Bob yeah
[38:08] don't you get them running go ahead and
[38:09] pull up number one on the mulch and
[38:11] let's get right around then we'll get to
[38:12] the scriptures and we'll get started on
[38:14] it and we'll we'll just Define a few
[38:17] things to see whether or not
[38:19] Wilmington divorce her husband
[38:22] because they have to all tie together if
[38:24] it doesn't then we miss the whole thing
[38:25] all right now taken from marriage and
[38:28] divorce from 1965 to 21 in the morning
[38:31] service paragraph uh to 27 through 229
[38:35] again
[38:37] see she has got a living husband
[38:40] so no man can marry her
[38:43] care what she does and who she is she's
[38:47] got a living husband there is no grounds
[38:49] for her at all now what's he talking
[38:52] about
[38:53] no ground for her divorce right
[38:56] but it's not for him causes her not him
[39:00] that's what the Bible says calling her
[39:02] see
[39:03] not him get it you have to make a word
[39:06] running continuity he said nothing
[39:07] saying he couldn't
[39:09] but she can't he calls it her not him
[39:12] that's exactly what the Bible says
[39:14] causes her it's not stated against him
[39:16] to remarry but her see but her why
[39:20] Christ in the top
[39:22] just give you stated that he cannot
[39:25] remarry only a virgin now he gets into
[39:27] an expression so he can remarry he can
[39:30] he can remarry again if it's a virgin
[39:32] but he can't marry somebody else's wife
[39:35] no indeed now that's exactly right where
[39:38] you want to believe it or not you read
[39:39] it right you read it and keep it as
[39:41] plain sense
[39:43] you know that we're all commanded to
[39:45] marry a virgin you can say well that's
[39:47] applying to the preacher that's fine
[39:49] it's used for the preacher
[39:52] all right
[39:54] but there's no way now watch there's no
[39:57] way any of us men can marry somebody
[40:00] else's wife
[40:05] come on
[40:08] he said well what about David Marion
[40:12] the wife of the that her husband called
[40:15] was called a fool
[40:17] you remember
[40:19] he wasn't a preacher so he could marry a
[40:21] woman that had been married before but
[40:24] she her husband was dead right so read
[40:27] what wrote around him is saying he can
[40:29] remember he can remarry again if it's a
[40:31] virgin
[40:35] but he can't marry somebody else's why
[40:38] that's right
[40:41] you can't marry oh
[40:43] a woman that her husband still living
[40:45] are divorced right
[40:48] right
[40:51] so you read it right all right now what
[40:55] did you say and if he does marry a
[40:56] divorced woman he's living in adultery I
[40:59] don't care who he is the Bible said
[41:00] don't you ever married her they just put
[41:02] away living in adultery therefore you
[41:04] are
[41:05] not no divorcees
[41:08] see that original backyard from the
[41:12] beginning now remarry now notice he can
[41:15] but she can't like David like Solomon
[41:18] like the continuity the whole Bible now
[41:20] same as David and the rest of them all
[41:23] right
[41:24] now you notice in First Corinthians 7 10
[41:28] notice Paul commands that the wife that
[41:31] is that divorces her husband I want you
[41:34] right
[41:37] hmm
[41:39] to remain single or be reconciled not to
[41:43] remarry huh
[41:46] she must remain single or be reconciled
[41:48] back to her husband she cannot remarry
[41:50] she must remain single but notice he
[41:52] never said about the man okay now
[41:57] all right so there's no grounds for her
[42:00] right
[42:02] now brother Brown is technically using
[42:04] the word divorce
[42:07] didn't she divorcing
[42:12] She's Gotta remain single
[42:15] so you can say well brother round was
[42:17] justifying divorce for a woman
[42:19] excuse me
[42:22] when you just got to say it in the same
[42:24] message that there's no grounds for her
[42:28] is she just talking sensible
[42:32] which one is it
[42:34] is he just simply saying
[42:37] that is she divorces you cannot remember
[42:39] me
[42:43] well there's no grounds for her to be
[42:45] separated from her first husband that's
[42:47] right
[42:49] so you know what's it doing see this is
[42:52] it which way is it running look at the
[42:53] next one
[42:54] 243
[42:57] the marriage and divorce
[42:59] huh
[43:02] when you get this marriage and divorce
[43:03] straightened out so that you would know
[43:06] which it was right which was wrong
[43:09] now he finally shows here in these
[43:11] verses there's one Christ and many
[43:13] members of that wife noticed he could
[43:16] put us away for Spiritual fornication
[43:18] and false Doctrine anytime he wants to
[43:20] but how dare you try to put him away and
[43:23] make it the man can put away his wife
[43:25] and marry another but not the woman put
[43:28] away her husband and marry another one
[43:30] see and the Shadows see all the shadows
[43:33] and types that are perfectly balanced
[43:35] see the original creation not the
[43:38] byproduct no word not the church the
[43:41] bride through the word but the woman the
[43:44] man each time that's why it never says
[43:47] anything against a man doing it it's
[43:50] always the woman that's right all right
[43:52] now to the next one
[43:56] invisible Union paragraph 56 1965-11-25
[44:02] the prophet Paul here is saying that a
[44:04] woman cannot remarry until her first
[44:06] husband is dead she cannot remarry as
[44:09] long as her first husband is living
[44:12] she by no circumstances at all she must
[44:15] remain single as long as her first
[44:17] husband is living and she should do such
[44:19] a sin she shall be called an adulteress
[44:21] I am speaking of the natural now to type
[44:24] it with the spiritual if this woman
[44:26] would commit such a sin then she is
[44:28] marked an adulteress
[44:30] if she has two living husbands at the
[44:33] same time therefore she has forfeited by
[44:36] doing this watch her rights to God and
[44:38] Heaven
[44:40] Listen by doing so
[44:43] she sure has she has hit an outcast from
[44:47] the economy of God according to the
[44:50] scriptures that I just read right
[44:52] yeah
[44:55] not a strong minute
[44:59] a woman divorce her husband and remarry
[45:04] now you tell me you don't need the grace
[45:06] of marriage and divorce now where we're
[45:07] going to go right that's what I'm
[45:09] reading and showing you where are you
[45:11] going to go
[45:17] get it you took that and literally just
[45:19] put it down as a law and set it down
[45:20] without a Grace to go in where are you
[45:22] going
[45:22] right
[45:23] you're going to the bases that none of
[45:26] you sisters who never divorced your
[45:27] husband and remarried are going to make
[45:29] it to heaven
[45:33] I didn't say that
[45:36] well that's your interpretation is that
[45:38] my interpretation my brother dick says
[45:40] you talk about the women's heart of
[45:42] somebody and you just lay the Bible down
[45:43] and let them read what it said
[45:45] but I don't believe that
[45:47] in other words you're not believing God
[45:51] but
[45:52] he asked her oh my boy really fixed him
[45:55] I told him I didn't believe that well I
[45:57] didn't change nothing
[45:58] right
[46:00] you understand how serious it is amen
[46:02] that's right without the grace of
[46:04] marriage and divorce where would the
[46:06] women be
[46:08] all right prayer
[46:10] all right now we're going to get into it
[46:12] in a minute and realize what we are the
[46:14] female with the body of Christ amen
[46:17] where would we be all of us men and
[46:20] women both in the body of Christ where
[46:22] would we be come on
[46:26] you see we try to use something to
[46:28] justify or trip up something or try to
[46:30] make it different
[46:32] says she's an outcast from the economy
[46:35] of God Amen right
[46:38] now he's not saying a woman that would
[46:40] separate from her husband because of the
[46:43] things that we were covering and all
[46:44] like that right Hall's gonna cover it in
[46:47] a minute
[46:49] all right
[46:51] but what's he saying
[46:53] because of the adulterous act in the
[46:56] garden that has come down
[47:00] then where is there any hope for hardly
[47:02] any other women
[47:04] right
[47:06] and then you say well now wait a minute
[47:08] brother Dale I've never been married was
[47:09] you ever engaged
[47:15] was you a virgin
[47:17] when you married your husband
[47:22] right we've had a long ways to go
[47:27] Mike Wade said the other day then they
[47:29] come up now and the kids are saying not
[47:31] to have sex so they
[47:36] immorally with each other
[47:39] without an intercourse
[47:45] I frown
[47:48] on that sorry yeah I frowned on that and
[47:51] somebody to contact me one time
[47:55] and they said their wife had admitted to
[47:58] him that she had
[48:01] orally
[48:03] right sex with a man and he orally sex
[48:06] with her
[48:08] but they never had no intercourse
[48:11] now I'm too plain I know it I'm sorry
[48:15] I just don't believe them right all
[48:17] right amen you go that far
[48:20] come on
[48:24] that's why we'll get down to that
[48:26] scripture about the Deuteronomy 24. amen
[48:29] I'm just trying today to establish the
[48:31] fact that you do not have any grounds
[48:34] whatsoever the woman does to divorce her
[48:37] husband
[48:40] but there is grounds for him but now not
[48:42] for just burning debris
[48:45] that's what we'll get
[48:47] we'll get
[48:48] yep
[48:50] that's what I said when when they asked
[48:53] Jesus that question did you notice it
[48:55] he never even he just turned it totally
[48:58] away from their question when they said
[49:00] for any cause
[49:02] he just went right back to the beginning
[49:04] said what's on the beginning in other
[49:06] words what are you playing games with
[49:07] the word of God right you know Moses
[49:09] never done that
[49:11] right
[49:13] I do not believe and I'll get back to it
[49:15] later I do not believe Moses just for
[49:18] any cause gave them a ride of
[49:19] divorcement
[49:21] right
[49:23] he would be breaking the word of God
[49:25] Amen
[49:27] they took it and twisted it
[49:32] and made it to apply for what they want
[49:33] to do that's what we do with the word
[49:35] amen all right
[49:38] go to the next one paragraph 151
[49:41] invisible Universe I noticed the bible
[49:44] plan that says here that her first
[49:45] husband must be dated
[49:49] not just put away he's got to be dead
[49:53] all right now
[49:56] I urge to profit on it no grounds
[50:01] for her divorce him right but it doesn't
[50:05] say about him right now we'll cover the
[50:08] grounds that he has when we get back to
[50:10] it but it's not this or anything
[50:13] get that out of your mind
[50:15] This Plane all right
[50:18] now go ahead and pull up Romans 7 and
[50:20] let's get into this
[50:21] but notice the point now her Proctor
[50:23] Prophet finally states are saying her
[50:26] husband must be dead
[50:31] I don't never talk about marriage and
[50:33] divorces to anybody in the world
[50:35] somebody bluntly asked me a question and
[50:37] was kind of making a little thought in
[50:39] it and he he finally said you know
[50:42] something and I said look her husband's
[50:44] got to be dead
[50:47] you know
[50:50] for her to remarry and he just
[50:53] he stood there a minute like boy he got
[50:55] a light bug turned on he screamed he
[50:57] looked at me and said
[50:59] I guess I
[51:00] then she could kill the old boy
[51:07] that's what I got accepted I guess she
[51:10] could just kill the old boy
[51:11] we get a lot of husbands be dead
[51:15] right
[51:16] keep it take him back again because of
[51:18] me down there I said Yahoo
[51:20] but she'd be a murderer
[51:22] now what are you gonna do gosh see
[51:26] you're trying to prop up something all
[51:28] right but now listen look what Paul said
[51:31] for the war in which half the husband is
[51:33] bound by the law Romans 7
[51:36] . and you know where that is invisible
[51:38] Union they brought around said this is a
[51:40] mostly used for marriage and divorce but
[51:43] said it's a higher order
[51:45] so we'll get to that but he's saying it
[51:47] is what it's used for for the woman
[51:49] which happened husband is bound by the
[51:51] law of her husband as long as he live it
[51:52] but if the husband be dead she is loose
[51:55] from the law of her husband okay simple
[51:57] husband dies she can marry again right
[52:01] come on
[52:03] you said well it's got to be this got to
[52:05] be that you know that road around says
[52:07] that if a person you know if a woman is
[52:10] a virgin to start with
[52:13] and she lives with a husband
[52:15] and he dies
[52:17] I think she was a virgin to start with
[52:19] she's still a virgin right
[52:23] no trouble saying that because it's true
[52:25] all right
[52:26] you say yes you don't have three kids
[52:32] come on you're not thinking spiritual or
[52:34] in any form rightly
[52:37] because she was a virgin to start with
[52:38] now she and the Virgin start with she's
[52:40] not a virgin the second third fourth
[52:42] fifth or eighth time right no who is it
[52:46] who's the latest in Marion that she died
[52:49] but then you know
[52:50] listen
[52:52] so then if while her husband liveth
[52:56] she be married to another man
[53:00] she shall be called an adulteress
[53:03] all right now you want the scripture
[53:04] word the Bible says there are no
[53:06] adulteress can enter Heaven right
[53:09] now that's right
[53:12] but if her husband would be dead she's
[53:14] free to marry
[53:15] she free from the law so that she has no
[53:18] adulterers though she'd be married to
[53:19] another man right now that's true that's
[53:21] right all right woman's husband dies
[53:24] yep if you can remarry
[53:27] but remember now
[53:29] whether it be the man or the woman in
[53:31] remarriage remember one thing
[53:35] now I don't remember the scripture if
[53:37] somebody come up with it we'll put it on
[53:38] here but
[53:40] only in the Lord
[53:46] well I'll just go marry anybody I want
[53:50] I want a Christian
[53:54] right he says only in the Lord
[53:58] see it for the man
[54:01] we just covered that for the man
[54:05] all right you say well he's married this
[54:07] woman has been married before all right
[54:09] he's wrong if she's got an adulterous
[54:11] problem
[54:12] he's not one
[54:16] but she was a virgin for her first
[54:18] husband and he died
[54:19] and then you can marry her
[54:21] now the the winner of the priest has to
[54:23] qualify at a different time for the
[54:25] preacher but not for just everybody okay
[54:27] my brother around him I said playing
[54:29] David wouldn't a preacher priest he was
[54:31] a
[54:32] he was a prophet but he wasn't a priest
[54:34] right all right so he could marry that
[54:37] lady that was the her husband had died
[54:39] but he couldn't take somebody else's
[54:41] wife that's where he got in trouble with
[54:43] Bathsheba right
[54:45] yep that's right the trouble with
[54:48] Bathsheba was he got hurt
[54:52] now if you ride went out and got killed
[54:54] it would have been all right
[54:57] you know he had to be Rock healed it
[54:59] wasn't a starting his hand the problem
[55:01] he had in divorces in situations she
[55:03] brought on just like the garden
[55:05] it not only brought death you know the
[55:09] garden brought death because of our
[55:10] adulterous parent Eve
[55:14] the first woman brought death
[55:18] now Sheba brought death
[55:21] like the brother said there and I never
[55:22] noticed that scripture because he
[55:24] mentions it brought it to me
[55:26] he named the four deaths it was in the
[55:28] family of David because David said
[55:29] remember he said I'll restore it
[55:32] fourfold
[55:34] when Nathan had told him about the
[55:36] little eulam you know and the things and
[55:39] all them going in and taking the other
[55:40] name again he said I'll kill him right
[55:43] near already stored fourfold
[55:45] lost four kids
[55:49] because of his own worthy and his own
[55:51] doing right
[55:53] see David couldn't take Bathsheba
[55:57] because she was married
[55:59] she had a living husband
[56:01] well he ain't killed Oh Glory then he
[56:05] got a husband no more
[56:07] did that Straighten It Up
[56:10] no that brought more death
[56:13] so don't play with the word
[56:16] right you know and try to justify
[56:18] something right right
[56:21] now
[56:22] is no longer adulterers is she married
[56:25] to another man it's the man's name
[56:26] that's no problem
[56:30] no trouble
[56:32] come on folks even in the Baptist Church
[56:34] that I came from at the time I was there
[56:36] they would not have a double married
[56:38] preacher I said well today I'm sure but
[56:42] they didn't know nothing about it but
[56:43] they held on to that
[56:46] the old timers held on
[56:49] you know they have a little Common Sense
[56:50] go to the next one
[56:53] Corinthians 7 39 is that the one we're
[56:57] looking for
[56:58] just look at that
[57:00] First Corinthians
[57:10] I get out of second Corinth I found
[57:12] Barbershop
[57:18] 739 yep
[57:20] right the wife is Bound for the law as
[57:22] long as your husband live it but if her
[57:24] husband be dead she is at Liberty to be
[57:26] married to whom she will only in the
[57:31] Lord
[57:32] only in the Lord we are not supposed to
[57:35] just say I just marry anybody
[57:37] you're supposed to be Christian to be
[57:39] married in the Lord I believe we'd have
[57:41] done it that away and I'm not saying
[57:43] wrong because we all wound up in good
[57:45] shape
[57:47] maybe but if we took the scriptures we
[57:50] might have made some different decisions
[57:51] all right
[57:53] all right right those are supposed to be
[57:55] in the Lord you know all right look at
[57:58] First Corinthians now seven
[58:00] in through 11. enter the marriage
[58:03] command I command yet not I now he's got
[58:06] his Commandments Essence Grace that goes
[58:08] with it but look but the Lord
[58:11] the Lord commands
[58:12] let the wife listen let not the wife
[58:16] depart from her husband
[58:19] all right now but if she depart
[58:23] let her remain unmarried or be
[58:26] reconciled to her husband and let not to
[58:29] husband put away his wife now you know
[58:31] Paul and what he's explained
[58:34] he's explaining that if an unbelief you
[58:37] know if you marry an unbeliever
[58:39] to marry an unbeliever and then come to
[58:41] the you know you you come along one day
[58:43] and you become a Christian you see my
[58:45] wife's not a Christian I just put her
[58:47] away you don't have no ground right amen
[58:49] amen
[58:50] amen might get her on the cutting hair
[58:52] but you can't get her own name right
[58:55] told her they die why because Paul goes
[58:58] on to say what my husband sanctify you
[59:01] know the wife or the husbands be
[59:02] Sanctified by what you're doing right
[59:04] until you remain together
[59:07] the people in this message they're
[59:09] coming along going and say well well my
[59:10] wife's not a Believer I just put away
[59:12] Mary again
[59:14] you got double problems
[59:17] first you're putting her away just
[59:18] because she believes what something
[59:20] differ
[59:22] and then you're trying to marry again
[59:25] because you're trying to find something
[59:27] in your own lustful form
[59:29] and I don't mind talking playing why
[59:32] would you want to put away your wife
[59:35] if you came along I know one man in this
[59:38] message that they have 10 kids
[59:41] and he come up and divorced her
[59:45] and he said she told him that she was
[59:47] not true to him before the marriage okay
[59:49] roll around you got a scripture he's a
[59:51] profit thing right but according to what
[59:53] everybody found out she told him when
[59:55] they first got married
[59:58] and then after 10 kids you got to look
[1:00:00] into somebody else
[1:00:04] at least he did he tried to use that
[1:00:06] scripture I don't play games with
[1:00:08] scripture
[1:00:11] so that's not the way to do it
[1:00:14] all right but if she depart
[1:00:20] see
[1:00:23] all right it's a woman departure what
[1:00:25] caused it for you right but let her
[1:00:28] remain unmarried well it doesn't say if
[1:00:30] she depart her husband won't give him
[1:00:31] another
[1:00:35] you said well that sure puts a lot of
[1:00:37] problems on all of us
[1:00:41] we put our own problems on ourselves
[1:00:45] by not praying and waiting
[1:00:51] you remember the man that come to
[1:00:52] brother random and said well I could
[1:00:53] straighten you out on that marriage and
[1:00:54] divorce because you're talking about
[1:00:56] that woman been married three or four
[1:00:57] times
[1:00:59] I said I had this Vision you know he
[1:01:02] started doing it right around and said
[1:01:03] immediately I knew it was a dream
[1:01:06] remember
[1:01:08] and he said you're dreaming all might
[1:01:10] sound beautiful but you ain't scripture
[1:01:13] and he just thought he could just put
[1:01:15] her away marry another one and she could
[1:01:16] put this away and marry another one oh
[1:01:18] that may be well and good you know
[1:01:21] and a lot of people depend upon that
[1:01:22] they depend upon their feelings their uh
[1:01:26] spirituality and I'm not joking or
[1:01:29] making light up but they depend upon
[1:01:31] their spirituality of feelings or their
[1:01:33] spirituality of Visions or dreams or
[1:01:36] something what if you had a dream
[1:01:37] brother dick that that you could just
[1:01:39] shoot sister Gayle marry again
[1:01:43] laughs
[1:01:45] now would that be so
[1:01:50] well if it's real dream you gotta go do
[1:01:52] it you're calling from the Lord
[1:01:55] but see you come tell me I'd say brother
[1:01:57] you take too much beans
[1:02:01] you went to bed on a Bailey full of
[1:02:03] something that messed you up
[1:02:05] because your dream ain't scriptural all
[1:02:07] right
[1:02:10] you see we try to get all of the things
[1:02:12] and do what we want to
[1:02:14] yeah
[1:02:16] but let her remain unmarried or
[1:02:21] your husband
[1:02:25] he said well do they have to do this
[1:02:27] than the others Paul goes on down to say
[1:02:30] there's a brother and sister is not
[1:02:32] under bondage in this case not meaning
[1:02:35] that they can just divorce do whatever
[1:02:36] you want to it means that you know if
[1:02:40] the woman divorces her husband or goes
[1:02:42] away from him losing
[1:02:45] and she comes back wants to come back
[1:02:46] with him she doesn't been out and done
[1:02:48] something wrong because she left or
[1:02:50] something you didn't want to take her
[1:02:51] back
[1:02:53] and we're going to get into it we don't
[1:02:55] have time today but we're going to get
[1:02:57] into it you know that people in this
[1:02:58] message
[1:03:00] believe that you can put away your wife
[1:03:01] for fornication
[1:03:04] but if she commits adultery after you're
[1:03:06] married you don't have to I mean you
[1:03:09] can't put her away that's been taught in
[1:03:11] this message
[1:03:18] where is it biggest garbage can of
[1:03:20] people that's in the world is in this
[1:03:22] message bringing up these ideas
[1:03:25] sorry but it's true right right man
[1:03:29] me
[1:03:30] all right now in the natural
[1:03:34] in the natural
[1:03:36] see go ahead and use Matthew 5 32
[1:03:38] because we'll use that part
[1:03:40] because look at your situation it puts
[1:03:42] the woman into but I say unto you that
[1:03:44] whosoever shall put away his wife saving
[1:03:47] for the cause and I'm going to get into
[1:03:48] the definition of these words later okay
[1:03:50] tell him for the cause of fornication
[1:03:52] cause it hurt to commit adultery
[1:03:57] if he puts her away
[1:03:59] without a just reason yep
[1:04:02] you know what running around says right
[1:04:03] after that because she will marry
[1:04:09] he's going to cause it
[1:04:11] yeah yes now if you got justifiable
[1:04:14] reasons to do it you don't cause her she
[1:04:17] calls herself
[1:04:21] but if it's just for your little not
[1:04:23] burning the bread or what I mean burning
[1:04:24] the bread or not cooking good or
[1:04:26] whatever
[1:04:27] because she ain't a Believer like you
[1:04:30] you're gonna call her
[1:04:34] to commit adultery right
[1:04:37] no she will marry and whosoever that
[1:04:39] marriage hurt in his divorce committeth
[1:04:42] adultery now that's about it that's the
[1:04:45] prophet there's no grounds for her
[1:04:49] right
[1:04:51] no situation worse you can divorce her
[1:04:53] husband and remarry
[1:04:55] he's got to be dead
[1:04:57] man all right
[1:04:59] now
[1:05:00] the prophet said on invisible Union
[1:05:03] this message he said is more or less
[1:05:06] related to where it is Romans 7 2
[1:05:09] marriage and divorce
[1:05:11] but he says I want to take it higher
[1:05:15] amen you understand Christ and the
[1:05:18] church so now look what would be the
[1:05:20] rest of it see let's see our situation
[1:05:25] all right go ahead and pick up number
[1:05:26] five on the notes brother and let's read
[1:05:28] these
[1:05:30] I'll get this out of the way because I
[1:05:32] said it this morning
[1:05:34] and um
[1:05:35] then we'll get down to what we're trying
[1:05:37] to really bring all right
[1:05:41] number five
[1:05:42] this is paragraph 207
[1:05:45] questions and answers in neural 2 64 823
[1:05:50] that's the reason I want to answer it
[1:05:51] just is with much sense is
[1:05:54] chance to it is I can give you
[1:05:57] do they ask the question run around if a
[1:06:00] man has been married and divorced isn't
[1:06:02] that awful to me I'm not saying nothing
[1:06:04] against the people that's just on the
[1:06:06] people's mind
[1:06:07] they're trouble the Rapture people use
[1:06:10] not to think so much about that
[1:06:14] now that's what we're going to get into
[1:06:15] it
[1:06:18] that's why I've always told you there'll
[1:06:20] be a lot of people like to die and go by
[1:06:21] the grave
[1:06:24] they'll come up in the rapture
[1:06:27] predicamental Resurrection right
[1:06:29] go watch what he's saying it's because
[1:06:31] the look of them didn't know how to
[1:06:33] straighten anything out
[1:06:38] but they didn't have the the prophet to
[1:06:42] bring the correct understanding
[1:06:44] so one would argue with the other
[1:06:47] if they're argued over a little Mark
[1:06:50] over a word right after nicaea
[1:06:52] because that's what they're arguing with
[1:06:54] write it nicely in Council 325 had done
[1:06:57] got to that point they were arguing
[1:06:59] about that
[1:07:00] because man's ideas are done developed
[1:07:02] where is it but look what he's saying
[1:07:04] all right
[1:07:06] Rapture people used not to think so much
[1:07:08] about that why they couldn't go being a
[1:07:10] rapture
[1:07:12] petition they used to come for the
[1:07:13] Rapture right it wasn't so much of it
[1:07:16] but now he's just plastered the world
[1:07:18] and the people read no play you know
[1:07:21] plain language plaster of the world
[1:07:23] after the prophet started preaching it
[1:07:24] right right you agree with that and run
[1:07:27] around started coming along and
[1:07:29] preaching Rapture people got interested
[1:07:31] in Rapture when they come along start
[1:07:32] preaching the son of man people started
[1:07:34] preaching son of man huh but look
[1:07:38] but it's just less than the people read
[1:07:39] these things in the scriptures and
[1:07:41] people elected out there is coming in to
[1:07:44] look at it
[1:07:46] and they see it and they're sincere they
[1:07:48] want to know that's the reason I want to
[1:07:50] answer it justice with with much sense
[1:07:53] to it as I can give it you has been
[1:07:57] married and divorced and been remarried
[1:08:00] of a woman who have also been married
[1:08:02] and divorced now so we're just not
[1:08:04] picking on the women right
[1:08:06] both men and women he's talking about
[1:08:09] what's she married to woman who had also
[1:08:12] been married and divorced and married to
[1:08:14] him and these two can can marry in God's
[1:08:18] side the in other words are coming down
[1:08:21] are they married and got shot
[1:08:23] how can both are one of them be in the
[1:08:27] rapture
[1:08:28] I want you
[1:08:30] how
[1:08:32] I don't know right
[1:08:34] and look at the sincere to the man
[1:08:37] I couldn't tell you the question is can
[1:08:39] they be in the rapture
[1:08:41] divorce each one of them divorce each
[1:08:44] one of them has a living companion then
[1:08:46] they're married again both of them
[1:08:48] married again and now one that this
[1:08:52] woman has a living husband and this man
[1:08:54] has a living wife and narrative got
[1:08:56] children and so forth and want to come
[1:08:59] to God can they go into Rapture that'll
[1:09:02] be up to the heavenly father I couldn't
[1:09:05] answer that see
[1:09:08] because that was 1964 before the grace
[1:09:11] of marriage and divorce was preached
[1:09:14] huh
[1:09:16] could it be
[1:09:20] you know as I said this morning now come
[1:09:22] on folks I'm just saying honest
[1:09:26] if you don't see you need something it
[1:09:28] won't cry out for it how are you going
[1:09:31] to get it right all right right amen
[1:09:33] amen did you cry for the new birth right
[1:09:37] that's the way you get it then
[1:09:41] craft for the grace of marriage and
[1:09:42] divorce that's the way you get it right
[1:09:46] that's what tears me up in my heart
[1:09:49] the thing that the Ministers of this
[1:09:50] message won't preach it to their people
[1:09:54] the four old people sitting out there
[1:09:56] and that's where I go and that's why I
[1:09:58] went with the internet because I go out
[1:09:59] there and people would ask me questions
[1:10:01] I said we'll get you pastored okay and
[1:10:03] I'll give you the tape my pastor won't
[1:10:06] let me listen to the times
[1:10:11] yep well that's where we come through it
[1:10:13] not years ago they had what they called
[1:10:16] as a spiritual husband Doctrine
[1:10:19] people
[1:10:21] in other words if you go to another
[1:10:23] church instead of going to this church
[1:10:24] here you're committing adultery against
[1:10:26] me because I'm your husband
[1:10:29] well the only answer I ever had that was
[1:10:31] well how come my husband is going to
[1:10:33] some other female
[1:10:35] he was going out and preaching to other
[1:10:37] churches all across the country but if I
[1:10:40] went anywhere else it was adultery
[1:10:43] that's all I wanted the answer for
[1:10:48] it's okay for him to run around but it
[1:10:50] wasn't for me
[1:10:54] okay sorry
[1:10:57] I'm sorry for
[1:10:58] it does you think that you think I think
[1:11:00] I'm something for no if you knew I was
[1:11:03] in my heart and how I felt
[1:11:06] I cry out and long to get to see the
[1:11:08] truth and not only that but they're
[1:11:10] trying to find some way to get it to
[1:11:12] people yeah
[1:11:15] yeah you realize these people hearing
[1:11:17] from these tapes on marriage and
[1:11:18] divorces never heard a sermon of
[1:11:19] marriage and divorce it's been in this
[1:11:21] message 30 40 years
[1:11:32] maybe they can hear the truth
[1:11:35] are you trying to be exalted in what I
[1:11:37] know
[1:11:39] I don't have to preach this
[1:11:44] but somebody needs to tell the truth
[1:11:49] look at the next one
[1:11:55] this is a question and answers book
[1:11:58] three
[1:11:59] paragraph 12
[1:12:01] yes
[1:12:04] just remember this to you people who are
[1:12:06] married and divorced
[1:12:08] I remember what he said he said I'm just
[1:12:10] I'm sitting out there he said God what
[1:12:12] am I going to do
[1:12:14] he said I got me and that's married two
[1:12:16] or three times he said I got women
[1:12:17] that's married two or three times he
[1:12:19] said I've got people saying should I
[1:12:21] divorce my wife should I put her away
[1:12:23] should I leave my wife or whatever
[1:12:27] you think it wouldn't have burdened in
[1:12:28] that man's heart
[1:12:30] but look what he said
[1:12:32] now this was almost not quite a year
[1:12:35] before marriage divorce was preached
[1:12:39] just remember this to you people who are
[1:12:41] married and divorced and remarried
[1:12:42] promise me one thing
[1:12:46] you put your confidence in me I guess
[1:12:49] this is not tape I don't know
[1:12:51] you you you you believe me as your
[1:12:53] Prophet sent from God your servant then
[1:12:56] you take my word for this will you go on
[1:12:59] Living Just Like You Are
[1:13:03] don't you try anything else like it
[1:13:08] but Liz just go ahead just live happy
[1:13:10] you got you're saved and you're
[1:13:12] Christians you go ahead and live in for
[1:13:15] Christ he had a reason to save you
[1:13:18] nice
[1:13:22] now when I come back the Lord willing
[1:13:24] I'll explain that to you in the Bible
[1:13:26] see and don't get upset many men told me
[1:13:29] said well I love my wife but I'll just
[1:13:31] have to leave her I don't want to miss
[1:13:33] the rapture don't you do that they just
[1:13:37] as you are
[1:13:39] do you hear from me again see on this
[1:13:41] subject then when I I can't explain it
[1:13:45] in 10 or 15 minutes it's going to take
[1:13:47] some time to explain it because it's got
[1:13:49] to be the scripture it's got to be thus
[1:13:51] saith the Lord if it isn't it isn't
[1:13:54] right yeah all right now look what he
[1:13:56] said just stay where you are
[1:14:02] with the next one we'll get down to the
[1:14:05] point
[1:14:06] especially natural real for me this
[1:14:07] paragraph 181.
[1:14:09] we're now in the case of marriage and
[1:14:11] divorce I've asked you like a brother
[1:14:13] hold your peace until you hear from me
[1:14:16] here just go right on as you have lived
[1:14:20] I'm taking up too much time it should be
[1:14:22] the storm as you live
[1:14:24] boom
[1:14:26] what
[1:14:27] he didn't tell us to go out and do this
[1:14:29] and go out and do that
[1:14:33] you didn't tell nobody to do this or
[1:14:34] that the other on conduct order I mean
[1:14:37] on questions and answers one time that
[1:14:38] pinpointed me down he said the best
[1:14:40] thing I continued to do is live single
[1:14:44] it was just wordy
[1:14:47] all right
[1:14:48] because what he's going to do
[1:14:50] there was no Grace to be given
[1:14:54] and as I said if the new birth took care
[1:14:56] of it why would a prophet be send such
[1:14:58] turmoil to express the grace of marriage
[1:15:01] you know
[1:15:04] why would he be in that position
[1:15:08] if it was just going to be a
[1:15:11] new murder
[1:15:14] all right
[1:15:16] now
[1:15:20] I've tried to explain this scripture so
[1:15:23] if you want to turn
[1:15:25] they've got it
[1:15:31] First Corinthians
[1:15:33] 6 18. I've tried to explain the
[1:15:35] scripture people openly told me they
[1:15:37] didn't agree
[1:15:38] it's okay
[1:15:40] I still believe it
[1:15:43] but you're just stubborn I guess I'm
[1:15:44] sure
[1:15:45] I'm sorry
[1:15:47] I'm sorry for being stubborn
[1:15:49] but one of these days you look at me
[1:15:51] you'll say I'm glad you're stubborn
[1:15:54] and she told me the truth
[1:15:58] look what Paul says First Corinthians 6
[1:16:00] 18.
[1:16:01] free fornication
[1:16:05] ever sin that a man does
[1:16:08] is without the body
[1:16:14] but he that committeth fornication
[1:16:16] senteth against his own body
[1:16:21] no
[1:16:23] what is he saying
[1:16:26] the body without the spirit the Bible
[1:16:29] says it's dead right
[1:16:31] your body can't do anything without
[1:16:34] something motivating it causing it to
[1:16:36] happen amen all right
[1:16:39] see then see what he simply saying
[1:16:44] the definition of that did I give it to
[1:16:46] you brother
[1:16:47] yeah okay
[1:16:49] 4203 is the definition from it and look
[1:16:53] what the word fornication means to
[1:16:55] prostitute one's body to the lust of
[1:16:57] another
[1:17:00] to give oneself to unlawful sexual
[1:17:02] intercourse to commit fornication
[1:17:05] I don't understand that word
[1:17:08] metaphor right to be given to idolatry
[1:17:14] now it's not adultery now don't right
[1:17:17] okay all right amen you know it run
[1:17:20] around I said that one time there's some
[1:17:21] brothers and they kind of laughed at me
[1:17:23] until they take a while for it to Don
[1:17:24] them I said brother Brown said all you
[1:17:25] got to do is just let God be idling
[1:17:27] you're an idolatry I didn't say adultery
[1:17:29] I said I talked to me
[1:17:32] so they caught on to what I was saying
[1:17:34] you just let God be idle in your life
[1:17:36] and you're not you're an idol doctor
[1:17:38] you're you've got another God you've got
[1:17:40] something going wrong right you know
[1:17:42] you see to be given to idolatry to
[1:17:46] worship Bibles to prevent oneself to be
[1:17:48] drawn away by another into idolatry
[1:17:52] right not an adultery that can be
[1:17:54] natural part but listen look what Paul
[1:17:57] is simply saying
[1:17:59] ever sin that a man doeth is without the
[1:18:01] body your body can't sin unless
[1:18:04] something inside of it makes it work
[1:18:08] right right it's called the body of sin
[1:18:11] because it is the basis of what you
[1:18:14] display it with
[1:18:16] right right
[1:18:18] but the body without the spirit is dead
[1:18:20] all right now
[1:18:22] so then ever sin that a man do it
[1:18:26] is without the body
[1:18:30] you're standing in your in your soul if
[1:18:32] you're a sinner and you're lost
[1:18:35] right
[1:18:36] all right you don't have to display in
[1:18:40] your body
[1:18:42] what you do in your soul
[1:18:45] because your soul is born
[1:18:49] lost
[1:18:51] right
[1:18:53] a sinner
[1:18:58] your body Spirit Soul belong into the
[1:19:01] devil as we talked about this morning
[1:19:03] married to Adam
[1:19:05] IC nature
[1:19:08] so now watch you you before you're born
[1:19:11] again
[1:19:13] your soul is lost it's a sinner
[1:19:16] your spirit is a sinner your body is a
[1:19:19] sinner what is just displayed as a unit
[1:19:22] because what is within your soul goes
[1:19:24] out through your spirit into the body
[1:19:26] and you go do the act right right but
[1:19:28] you can stand right there
[1:19:30] in the Soul and Spirit part of you
[1:19:34] and sin without it going into the body
[1:19:37] on scripture either it looks on the
[1:19:39] woman to lust After Earth commits an
[1:19:41] adultery already were
[1:19:44] I didn't see anybody said in his heart
[1:19:48] all right so we're in the scripture
[1:19:51] me
[1:19:53] so then what's Paul talking about
[1:19:57] I believe he's talking about shipping
[1:19:59] what I just said
[1:20:03] your body can't display anything
[1:20:07] it's your soul and your spirit and it
[1:20:09] makes it motivate to do those things so
[1:20:12] then we're lost and we need to be born
[1:20:14] again
[1:20:15] and when we're born again we're not born
[1:20:17] again in body and spirit
[1:20:21] we're born and again in our soul right
[1:20:23] right and that brings eternal life to
[1:20:25] the soul amen you agree
[1:20:29] but the body and spirit is still in the
[1:20:32] world yes
[1:20:35] right
[1:20:38] all right
[1:20:41] it's still often in the world if you
[1:20:43] want to call it
[1:20:46] well because it only has the earnest
[1:20:48] then you burn
[1:20:51] the earnest Paul says or Peter and
[1:20:54] description you earnesty wearing hers
[1:20:57] until until the Redemption of the
[1:20:58] person's possession right or I want to
[1:21:00] say this morning our bodies as far as
[1:21:02] God is concerned or already redeemed you
[1:21:04] agree right right but we're physically
[1:21:07] in the making of it and it's not
[1:21:09] finished yet
[1:21:10] no it's not done
[1:21:12] we're in the process of redemption of
[1:21:14] the body and that's what I believe
[1:21:18] the seals had to be brought
[1:21:20] amen to show us the full Plan of
[1:21:23] Redemption Spirit soul and body right
[1:21:27] the seals didn't come to just reveal the
[1:21:29] Redemption of the body it kind of reveal
[1:21:32] the Redemption of Soul spirit and body
[1:21:34] as a unit that's right but see the Peter
[1:21:37] and them had and Paul and them had done
[1:21:39] preached the Redemption of the soul for
[1:21:40] the new birth
[1:21:43] right and a daily sanctification and
[1:21:47] into the spiritual Realm
[1:21:49] but they do not have to handle the body
[1:21:52] right all even said who can free me from
[1:21:55] this body of death
[1:22:02] but see then
[1:22:04] the new birth makes your soul complete
[1:22:06] you know I mean makes it the earnest if
[1:22:08] you're inheritance
[1:22:10] the rest of it's paid for
[1:22:12] but he ain't claimed it yet that's what
[1:22:14] wrote around said in the silver read the
[1:22:16] the breach
[1:22:18] right the world is already redeemed as
[1:22:21] far as God is concerned but it ain't
[1:22:24] your possession of it yet right
[1:22:27] join our bodies
[1:22:29] you see the shield had to break for the
[1:22:31] bride to bring her the quote the prophet
[1:22:33] said because of a supernatural
[1:22:34] Revelation because of the opening of The
[1:22:36] Seven Seals I say unto you go on as you
[1:22:40] are amen
[1:22:45] it had never been a way for a body to
[1:22:47] been able to walk into a change right
[1:22:49] had to Prophet not preach the grace of
[1:22:51] marriage and divorce
[1:22:55] so I had to become
[1:22:58] right
[1:22:59] but he brought it
[1:23:01] those that can receive it can walk
[1:23:03] therein
[1:23:06] brother Dale you've condemned me to to
[1:23:08] Hell by the last messages you've
[1:23:10] preached to me and I don't know what to
[1:23:12] do but then just go to God and start
[1:23:14] crying out
[1:23:15] and ask him because God has given us a
[1:23:19] Grace amen
[1:23:21] to set our bodies free
[1:23:29] he has given us that opportunity
[1:23:32] to receive Grace that was beyond the
[1:23:35] grace of the new birth
[1:23:37] the disgrace would cover the spirit and
[1:23:40] the body of mankind
[1:23:42] and bring mankind to a change
[1:23:45] without this message there is no change
[1:23:47] in the body
[1:23:49] right and this message came after the
[1:23:51] opening of the seals right
[1:23:53] Prophet said that's when these messages
[1:23:55] be gone Rapture message with after the
[1:23:58] opening of the seals
[1:24:00] and look where you come up to marriage
[1:24:02] and divorce
[1:24:07] and we'll get to it and cover it there's
[1:24:09] a lot of men that are condemned in their
[1:24:11] heart that they don't know what they're
[1:24:12] doing and don't understand but if they
[1:24:14] only stood understood the scriptures
[1:24:17] they could see that they were free
[1:24:20] right A lot of people didn't need the
[1:24:22] grace of marriage and divorce for a
[1:24:24] physical thing
[1:24:27] because
[1:24:29] if that woman comes in confessions
[1:24:32] you have a right to put her away
[1:24:35] and marry again
[1:24:37] a lot of men could stand free if they
[1:24:39] would just listen to the truth but there
[1:24:41] listen
[1:24:43] ing
[1:24:44] why
[1:24:46] too much pride in the preachers
[1:24:52] too much I'm gonna tell you what to do
[1:24:54] I'm your pastor
[1:25:00] where's that purpose you know
[1:25:04] not tall said all sin is without the
[1:25:06] body
[1:25:07] except
[1:25:10] fornication which is of the body we gave
[1:25:13] the definitions put them back up
[1:25:15] we gave the definition
[1:25:18] it's dealing with
[1:25:21] sexual intercourse or in some form
[1:25:24] prostitution of one's body and lust to
[1:25:27] another
[1:25:29] is dealing with the body you realize
[1:25:32] where my trouble would be if I went and
[1:25:34] out and done something wrong this
[1:25:36] afternoon with some girl
[1:25:39] woman you know if I don't tell my wife
[1:25:42] that's my body
[1:25:44] right
[1:25:47] well of course the way most people think
[1:25:49] it is they're going to get them a new
[1:25:50] one and the others they think well
[1:25:53] it don't matter what I do in this one
[1:25:55] but everything will be straightened up
[1:25:57] maybe I'll get me a right partner when I
[1:26:00] get over there
[1:26:03] I don't know
[1:26:08] all sin
[1:26:11] the body doesn't sin
[1:26:13] right
[1:26:15] the soul is where the sin lies
[1:26:19] but when that soul is made pure by the
[1:26:21] new birth it cannot sin right you see it
[1:26:24] remain at the end cannot sin so then
[1:26:26] where's the prophet when he said we sin
[1:26:28] every day what is he talking about
[1:26:32] definitely not in the soul
[1:26:35] but it's in our spirit in our body
[1:26:39] and it leads us into the wrong things
[1:26:41] and that's why people were mad three or
[1:26:42] four times and things like that why
[1:26:44] because of the lust
[1:26:47] brought forward
[1:26:48] and your Prophet didn't and I won't he
[1:26:51] called them Christians if you'll read
[1:26:52] back over what I gave you
[1:26:54] were talking about true he called it
[1:26:57] right over here in this corner elect
[1:27:00] those quotes
[1:27:03] true elect people sitting there
[1:27:05] because of misinterpreted Theology and
[1:27:08] marriage two or three times
[1:27:11] two Christians
[1:27:15] completely what can we do
[1:27:20] I see all fornication that fornication
[1:27:23] thing
[1:27:24] but he that committeth fornication
[1:27:26] sinneth against his own body
[1:27:30] first off as I see in my life
[1:27:33] and hurt with one body
[1:27:35] now we are the body of Christ
[1:27:41] right
[1:27:42] Paul said me go out to a harlot
[1:27:46] I'm the body of Christ he said
[1:27:52] we were the body of Christ
[1:27:54] if we sin against this body we must
[1:27:56] confess it to this body is that correct
[1:27:59] that's right amen
[1:28:02] well I confessed it to the Lord that's
[1:28:05] where we're going all in the prophet
[1:28:06] said right but lady said you didn't sin
[1:28:09] against God you sinned against your
[1:28:11] husband
[1:28:13] he said you got to go to your husband
[1:28:15] before you go to God yep right
[1:28:20] Church you just thinking about Grace
[1:28:23] think about the grace of marriage and
[1:28:25] divorce
[1:28:26] I wish you really invisible
[1:28:29] but around said in that now he's talking
[1:28:31] spiritual he said invisible union he
[1:28:34] sits a higher order of marriage in
[1:28:35] divorce read that in the book higher
[1:28:38] order of reading this morning
[1:28:41] I've read those books over and over
[1:28:42] because I'm keeping it all in my mind
[1:28:50] our old husband you looking at it
[1:28:55] you couldn't see my soul
[1:28:58] but that was married to an old husband
[1:28:59] right endemic nature
[1:29:02] but once that's born again that doesn't
[1:29:04] make my body and my spirit born again
[1:29:09] it does not make that to be able to be
[1:29:12] married to Christ right
[1:29:19] right the old husband's got to be dead
[1:29:20] amen amen
[1:29:23] now as I said while ago then the old
[1:29:25] husband got to be dead the woman she
[1:29:27] just shoots the husband you know
[1:29:31] I don't work does it
[1:29:33] right but you know what brother Brown
[1:29:35] says an invisibly in
[1:29:37] foreign
[1:29:44] he said your old husband's got to be
[1:29:46] dead to be married to Christ now here's
[1:29:48] a quote we'll get back to it he said God
[1:29:51] let it die
[1:29:55] reading verse beginning
[1:29:57] God let it die
[1:30:01] you mean that it's possible that
[1:30:04] everybody in this building knows all
[1:30:06] about me in all the years I've been
[1:30:07] around
[1:30:09] but yet somewhere someday it's going to
[1:30:12] be a place
[1:30:13] that God's going to let that old man be
[1:30:16] so dead
[1:30:18] until he can't even see it in my body
[1:30:22] come on
[1:30:26] you can't even see if my body
[1:30:30] that'll be so dead
[1:30:32] right see that away then your marriage
[1:30:34] and divorce will be right right when you
[1:30:36] can come to the place to see all of
[1:30:38] those husbands and wives
[1:30:42] thank you God let him die
[1:30:49] if God let him die
[1:30:52] you say yeah but they're still out there
[1:30:53] living
[1:30:55] I don't remember
[1:30:58] I've always said one of these days if I
[1:31:00] ever get enough nerve I'm going to
[1:31:01] preach on the God but I don't need you
[1:31:06] because you tell me what happens
[1:31:11] how does God forget
[1:31:18] I'm glad he does
[1:31:21] so to be married to Christ the word of
[1:31:24] the hour
[1:31:25] old husband has got to be David
[1:31:27] not just hung up in a closet we'll get
[1:31:29] back to these as we're going through
[1:31:31] some of the points
[1:31:33] and we'll see the truth that maybe some
[1:31:35] people didn't need that
[1:31:37] but I'm going to say it to you up front
[1:31:39] believe it
[1:31:40] there's not a person in the world
[1:31:42] outside of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:31:45] are you playing with me
[1:31:48] the Lord Jesus Christ was the only one
[1:31:50] that does did not have a problem with
[1:31:55] some form of problems in life
[1:31:59] are
[1:32:00] if nothing else spiritual adultery
[1:32:05] run around should I carry the Baptist
[1:32:07] Bible converted them to a Baptist faith
[1:32:14] did he walk out there and say blessed
[1:32:16] God God told me come out here and tell
[1:32:18] y'all y'all are all messed up but I've
[1:32:19] been right all the whole time
[1:32:22] when brother Brown says we and hush
[1:32:26] why won't people let him be one part of
[1:32:28] that
[1:32:33] yeah but he didn't need it
[1:32:36] well he said he did that's right
[1:32:43] where are we at
[1:32:46] well
[1:32:49] so there's no grounds for the woman
[1:32:52] her husband's got to be dead
[1:32:56] amen
[1:32:57] but if God Can Let It Die by the grace
[1:33:00] of American divorce that person could be
[1:33:03] president of the United States and you
[1:33:05] can still stand and look there and say
[1:33:07] the old man is dead
[1:33:10] it was gone let him die
[1:33:13] that I could be married to the right one
[1:33:17] come out and be married to Christ
[1:33:21] come on British
[1:33:22] and I could be mad to Christ
[1:33:25] without any impurities
[1:33:30] you say well I don't see how that can be
[1:33:32] done would you mind explaining me one
[1:33:35] thing
[1:33:38] because your soul be made
[1:33:41] so Peter that God could come and live in
[1:33:44] it that's right if you'll ever explain
[1:33:47] that to me
[1:33:49] then you won't have to have it explained
[1:33:51] to you that God can take care of our
[1:33:53] marital problems right yeah but it's
[1:33:57] because of the opening of the word
[1:34:03] and why would we want to turn to work
[1:34:07] why is it people don't want to hear the
[1:34:11] hear I know it's me and my idea but in
[1:34:14] my presentation my
[1:34:17] arrogance and hatefulness and all I have
[1:34:19] but
[1:34:20] that won't stand the Judgment folks
[1:34:25] I don't have to be taken care of in me
[1:34:29] but if a dumb donkey tells you the truth
[1:34:34] thank God for the truth amen all right
[1:34:37] and you know sometimes it might help to
[1:34:40] pet the donkey
[1:34:42] okay

[1:34:47] donkey all right
