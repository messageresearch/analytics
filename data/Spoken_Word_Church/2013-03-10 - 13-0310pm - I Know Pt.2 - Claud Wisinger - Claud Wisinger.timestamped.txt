[15:22] standing there you go yeah I want to ask
[15:26] brother Terrence one thing does this
[15:27] count against my 30
[15:30] minutes okay he says no he let me know
[15:34] before I come out here I had he gave me
[15:36] 30 minutes but really what he's saying
[15:38] is he's going to uh stay awake for 30
[15:40] minutes so if you're not here the last
[15:43] 30 minutes that's okay brother Dar okay
[15:46] so we I turn
[15:49] myself I hate it when that
[15:55] happens I already brought my notes in
[15:57] the floor too so
[16:00] we're going to continue on with what I
[16:02] ministered this morning about I
[16:05] know I know part two how that yeah U but
[16:10] I want to like I've been saying I've
[16:12] been preaching on the seals for the go
[16:14] since the middle of November so I want
[16:17] to just kind of continue on there but
[16:19] I'd like to start with the scripture
[16:21] reading if we would I'd like to start in
[16:23] Genesis 1 1-3 I know that's a strange
[16:26] one
[16:27] but thought you weren't going to do this
[16:30] well I wasn't then I told him what I was
[16:32] going to do so Joseph just like Johnny
[16:36] on the spot you know so let's go ahead
[16:38] and read the scripture in the beginning
[16:41] God created the Heaven and the Earth
[16:43] that word God there is Elohim self
[16:46] existing I'm going to say something
[16:48] that's going to kind of maybe sound a
[16:50] little different brother brandom said
[16:52] God's filled all space and time right
[16:55] now that's the best way with the English
[16:57] language we can describe it but God was
[16:59] not in space nor was he in time so you
[17:03] understand that brother Brandon when he
[17:04] preached he tried to explain it in a
[17:07] language that's not good English
[17:09] language is the worst language on the
[17:10] face of the Earth right so brother R
[17:12] said Elohim filled all space and time
[17:15] actually the full essence of Elohim was
[17:17] it was just God yeah it was the Eternal
[17:21] God right so you know but to bring it to
[17:24] our finite Little P Canary brain he said
[17:27] it filled all space and time
[17:29] right well see God you can't put God in
[17:31] a
[17:31] sandbox you can't God is eternal you
[17:35] don't put him in a sandbox right God is
[17:38] Not time he's Eternal right so we just
[17:41] got to take what brother Ram said it's
[17:43] just the best English words that we can
[17:46] use to explain it so here it was God
[17:49] created the Heaven and the Earth and the
[17:51] Earth was without form and void now that
[17:54] was you you came from the earth you were
[17:57] without form and void is that right and
[18:00] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[18:02] that was us yeah
[18:04] okay and the spirit of God moved upon
[18:08] the face of the Earth right so the first
[18:10] thing God did was the spirit of God
[18:13] moved upon the Earth right right now
[18:16] step two and God
[18:18] said y said is the spoken word right
[18:21] right does everybody agree with that and
[18:24] God said let there be light and there
[18:27] was light right okay let's bow our heads
[18:30] dear heavenly father we just pray that
[18:32] you give us understanding oh God and we
[18:34] just thank you for the prophet for the
[18:36] fful ministry and for the revelations
[18:39] that you give oh God like I said this
[18:41] morning I can't even express in English
[18:43] words how thankful we are so we're just
[18:46] going to use our little English language
[18:48] and say thank you Lord be with us in
[18:50] this service in Jesus Christ's name we
[18:52] ask it amen amen what God has you may be
[18:56] seated what God has established in
[18:59] everybody understand Genesis is the sea
[19:00] chapter the beginning so God started
[19:03] something here in the beginning and the
[19:05] first thing he would do the spirit of
[19:06] God would move upon the Earth and then
[19:08] he would speak right and through the
[19:10] spoken word it would be light right what
[19:13] is light it's a revelation what did he
[19:15] do he revealed the Earth before that it
[19:17] was without form and void right so now
[19:20] I'm going to move in to the first seal
[19:23] on the day of Pentecost what came the
[19:25] spirit right is that what came to the
[19:27] church the spirit
[19:29] right you agree with that so the way God
[19:31] deals with the Earth is the way he deals
[19:34] with you what brought you to the church
[19:36] one day you maybe were out in the world
[19:38] you didn't even think about God and all
[19:40] of a sudden the spirit of God moved on
[19:42] you in the spirit realm he said you know
[19:44] you need to go to church or you know
[19:46] there's something wrong with you you're
[19:47] not right and then all of a sudden that
[19:50] what was it it was the spirit of God
[19:51] that mov then you were able to come into
[19:54] a church somewhere and hear the word and
[19:57] then what did the word do it brought you
[19:59] a revelation that's why brother brandom
[20:02] and I'm going to say it again like I
[20:03] said that's why it's so important to
[20:05] have a revelation right sure is right
[20:07] cuz it takes the void it takes the
[20:09] without form away and it brings
[20:11] something to you that is very powerful
[20:13] right is that right you know what it was
[20:15] able the Earth was able to do the seed
[20:17] was in the earth sure is that what he
[20:19] taught but when the light came it was
[20:21] able to bring forth the fruit from it
[20:24] right by their fruit you will know them
[20:27] right and that's why I told you this
[20:28] morning and I've really been big on the
[20:30] last year conduct order and Doctrine so
[20:33] it's not enough just to have the
[20:35] Mysteries you know Paul said you can
[20:36] know all the
[20:37] Mysteries you can know all of it is that
[20:40] right and be like a tinkling symbol just
[20:43] a just making a bunch of noise right we
[20:45] understand by the prophet your life
[20:47] speaks louder it's a it's a voice did
[20:50] you understand brother man said I would
[20:53] that there were a thousand live voices
[20:55] thunders in gesture is that right right
[20:58] your life is a thunder your life shakes
[21:01] people around you at word is that right
[21:04] so it's very important as message
[21:06] Believers when you say you're a message
[21:08] believer you have to have the conduct
[21:11] sir you have to have the order and you
[21:13] have to have the doctrine amen and I
[21:16] really and like I say this morning and
[21:18] I've been really strong at our church on
[21:20] the Mysteries I believe in the message
[21:22] ranks right we get to conduct I've heard
[21:26] preachers get up and preach all they'll
[21:27] preach ons they hair the teeth toenails
[21:29] the hair you know what I mean but no
[21:31] Revelation no mystery so what it's going
[21:34] to take it's going to take all three of
[21:36] those things to bring to the status of a
[21:39] bride right amen so what we need in a in
[21:43] a message ranks is a balance right does
[21:47] everybody agree with that right y so
[21:49] here in Revelations when I read this I
[21:52] thought that's exactly what happened in
[21:53] the first seal yeah look when when the
[21:56] what happened on Pentecost was the
[21:58] spirit to the church is that right what
[22:01] happened on the day of Pentecost was the
[22:02] Antichrist came now I'm going to tell
[22:05] you in the Garden of Eden where did
[22:08] Satan work on E in the spirit realm
[22:10] right yeah does everybody brother R said
[22:13] in the spirit realm you have five senses
[22:15] that contact your spirit reasoning y
[22:18] right imaginations conscience affections
[22:21] what's the other one memory thank you
[22:23] memory now let me let me say something
[22:26] to you the devil Works in
[22:29] what what did I say because you can't
[22:31] remember it oh yeah thank
[22:33] you sometimes I don't know how you
[22:35] brother bradam said a word is a thought
[22:38] expressed sometimes I'll say stuff my
[22:40] wife said did you know you said it I
[22:41] said no I didn't she said yeah you did I
[22:44] said well I didn't think
[22:46] it so it's kind of contrary to what
[22:48] brother brother said a word is a thought
[22:50] you know a thought is a it's like wow
[22:53] how do I how do you you know you'll be
[22:54] thinking Moses and you'll say Noah so
[22:56] you're going to have to just kind of
[22:58] keep up with me and follow along I say
[23:00] something wrong you're going to go huh
[23:02] everybody in church go I I'll stop and I
[23:05] go okay what' I say you know I know them
[23:07] well enough I know when I'm goofed up
[23:09] but anyway so God sends the spirit our
[23:12] way right that's how God works he moves
[23:14] on your spirit realm first and God will
[23:17] set you somewhere and he'll speak the
[23:18] word on you and then that word that
[23:21] light that Revelation is going to bring
[23:23] forth fruit does everybody agree with
[23:25] that well guess what the devil works the
[23:27] same way see the Devil is a perverter of
[23:30] the original is that right in the first
[23:32] seal what the devil went as the
[23:34] Antichrist writer does everybody agree
[23:36] what did he do in the Garden of Eden he
[23:38] started working on Eve's reasoning he
[23:40] started working in her spirit realm and
[23:44] once the devil got Eve to reasoning with
[23:47] the word right brother Ram said eve did
[23:50] not disbelieve is that what he said if
[23:53] you put all the quot now he says
[23:54] something but if you put all them
[23:56] together brother said eve did not
[23:57] disbelieve
[23:59] Eve reason is that right Eve did not
[24:02] come to unbelief right if she did she
[24:05] sined she's lost right that's why you
[24:07] can't come to unbelief right now you may
[24:10] reason with the word is that right but
[24:13] that's what caused the fall so in the
[24:15] first seal what started the Antichrist
[24:18] writer that went out what did he start
[24:20] doing he started working on those those
[24:23] saints that had the original word just
[24:27] like Eve had the or original word didn't
[24:29] she said don't it's simple just don't
[24:32] eat of that tree eat of the Tree of Life
[24:35] don't eat of that tree all is well so
[24:38] what did she start doing she start got
[24:40] the devil started working in her
[24:42] reasoning right and what happened once
[24:44] she reasoned it she reasoned it away
[24:47] that's what's going on in the message
[24:50] that's what's going on with a lot of
[24:52] message preachers they're reasoning away
[24:55] the original word that was given in this
[24:58] house
[24:59] because the thing that brother BR was to
[25:01] do was to turn our faith back to the
[25:03] apostolic fathers what was the faith of
[25:06] the the original word brother Ram said
[25:09] in the church age show the church age
[25:11] slide if you would I'm going to be
[25:13] dealing with it for a while but what the
[25:16] church fell from was the original Worden
[25:19] does everybody agree with that so the
[25:21] white horse rider that started coming
[25:23] out and I said on the day of Pentecost
[25:25] which was right so he started right what
[25:28] was he doing what what did the people
[25:30] start doing they start reasoning with
[25:32] the original word that was given to the
[25:34] church amen and upon their reasoning is
[25:37] how they fa right that was because
[25:39] everything here is reasoning is that
[25:42] right what God wants you to have is
[25:44] faith right just believe brother R said
[25:47] you you don't have to explain it just
[25:49] believe it just have faith just believe
[25:52] the simple word right the original word
[25:55] amen but what we have among the the
[25:57] message
[25:59] people pull people to to give more
[26:01] Revelation like something they got that
[26:02] the other guy don't have so you know
[26:05] it's it's kind of like what we have in
[26:06] America you know you got to have what
[26:08] the Smiths has you got to have more you
[26:10] got to have a bigger car a better house
[26:11] so what they got among the message is
[26:13] preachers are preaching a bigger
[26:15] Revelation than what you got I can't
[26:17] preach a different Revelation at
[26:18] different Christ what we have to get
[26:21] back to as as the bride is the original
[26:24] World if Eve would have stayed with the
[26:27] simple IC original word everything would
[26:31] have been well do everybody agree with
[26:33] that right so that's what happened in
[26:35] the garden of e they had the original
[26:38] word so what the devil started doing is
[26:40] working in the spirit realm so now is
[26:43] did the brother say that white horse
[26:45] rode all the way to the end right right
[26:47] what is the devil doing now he's work
[26:49] trying to work on you in the
[26:50] spirit is that he can't get me down in
[26:53] my soul I'm just like Eve he ain't going
[26:55] to get me to doubt this message but if I
[26:57] reason with it I'm going to get myself
[26:58] in hot water all right that's right the
[27:00] simple thing of it is you just simply
[27:03] have to believe it amen and God will
[27:05] bring it to pass is that right but what
[27:08] we do is we have a bunch of people
[27:10] that's starting to hybrid it mix their
[27:13] own ideas with it that's what I told you
[27:16] brother R after seal he said you ain't
[27:17] got a thought coming right you know your
[27:19] thoughts as good as my thought but I
[27:21] ain't got a thought my thought has to be
[27:23] thus sayth the Lord right I have to be
[27:26] founded on the original word I don't
[27:28] have faith right anybody agree with that
[27:31] so there's the problem we and look every
[27:33] one of you in this church don't tell me
[27:35] and you'll say you know nobody in the
[27:38] church loves me you know what the
[27:40] devil's doing he's working on your
[27:41] affection right he's saying nobody loves
[27:44] me there we've had people leave our
[27:46] church say there's no love there you
[27:49] know what they've done the Antichrist
[27:50] Spirit has worked on them worked on
[27:52] their Spirit realm to a point they don't
[27:54] think anybody in church loves them yeah
[27:57] that you read that for oh yeah that's
[27:59] what it is and so the devil will make
[28:01] you reason with things that's what we
[28:03] got among the ministry a lot of
[28:05] reasoning going on rather than just
[28:06] believe it that's right so you know it's
[28:08] just like I said when that preacher said
[28:10] this and I said this I didn't argue with
[28:12] him or if brother bam said it then I got
[28:14] an amen it right so what I need to do is
[28:17] go back to it and say what is he saying
[28:20] right I simply I said I would going to
[28:22] argue a quote with a quote Yeah I I
[28:25] don't get I don't get how preachers can
[28:27] argue a quote with a
[28:29] quote does that make does that seem
[28:31] stupid to all you it seems Mighty stupid
[28:34] to me I mean if that's the kind of
[28:36] message we got we're going to argue a
[28:38] quote with a quote yeah you can't do it
[28:40] right it's just like I told him in in
[28:42] the in the you know in the scripture
[28:44] says you know you no man's tempted of
[28:47] God and then it said he tempt you the
[28:50] scripture says you better not tempt God
[28:52] right but God cont tempt you brother R
[28:55] said confidence what I was talking about
[28:57] this morning God put a disease on you or
[29:00] God don't let put it God don't do
[29:03] disease that he'll allow something to
[29:05] come in your life right all he's trying
[29:07] to do is to prove your love to him
[29:10] exactly he he knows you he has
[29:12] confidence in you so God allows these
[29:14] things to happen just so you'll have
[29:15] confidence in yourself right that's
[29:17] where we lack is confidence in ourselves
[29:20] so what the devil's going to work on is
[29:22] the five senses in your spirit realm
[29:24] that's the Antichrist does everybody
[29:26] agree with that amen so if he can reason
[29:29] with it in memory you said it where does
[29:32] the devil work on you you know you
[29:34] you've come to the altar you repented
[29:36] but you can't forget what you did right
[29:38] you might have been married four or five
[29:40] times I don't know how many times and
[29:42] the devil will work on that like you
[29:43] can't be saved like that's the cardinal
[29:45] sin it sounds like Catholics now huh
[29:48] yeah but that's what he gets to do with
[29:50] you right so what's he doing he's
[29:51] working in your memory right so what you
[29:53] got to put your guard up as a people
[29:55] here as a bride Church in that Spirit
[29:58] realm when that Devil comes to you with
[30:00] that Antichrist spirit and tries to say
[30:02] nobody loves me or your you know it says
[30:05] if your conscience don't condemn you ask
[30:07] what you will right and you know so the
[30:09] devil always try to put you H I'm not
[30:12] you
[30:13] know remember brother Jewel wowy wowy me
[30:17] I like the way he puts it what's the
[30:18] devil doing he's working in your spirit
[30:20] realm and if he can ever get your spirit
[30:24] realm everything else is going to follow
[30:26] with that you understand what I'm saying
[30:28] so what we as a as a bride have to do we
[30:31] got to put our guard up in that Spirit
[30:33] realm don't you let that Antichrist that
[30:35] white horse rider right in your life
[30:37] right we can see it back here in symbol
[30:39] look right and I was talking about
[30:41] there's the symbol form the mystery form
[30:44] and reality form do you understand the
[30:46] first seal it's all three of them are
[30:48] open you agree with that what he started
[30:52] writing back here in reality form he
[30:55] rode right and in simple form it there
[30:58] right and we understand that was the
[31:00] Antichrist spirit is that right but look
[31:03] he didn't quit writing there no all that
[31:05] writer did was get off on a different
[31:07] horse Antichrist still
[31:08] rides does everybody agree with that now
[31:11] look this is way brother Brandon brought
[31:13] it in the fourth seal and I'm kind of
[31:14] I'm going to scatter this bad today this
[31:17] afternoon okay but this guy's already
[31:19] preached the almost the entire Book of
[31:21] Revelation you can pick up the pieces
[31:23] right so I have confidence in here I
[31:25] wouldn't scatter it this bad so the
[31:27] devil Works in these three ways remember
[31:29] brother brand said he took off as the
[31:30] Antichrist Rider here then he comes up
[31:33] here and he's a false prophet right is
[31:37] that right then's the Beast down here
[31:39] right everybody do you understand that's
[31:41] how the devil rides on you right he'll
[31:43] try to get the Antichrist Spirit to work
[31:45] on your spirit realm and then guess what
[31:48] if you start reasoning with it okay the
[31:52] look all of you been this hasn't been
[31:54] redeemed yet right does everybody
[31:57] understand that so the devil's going to
[31:59] try to get in your spirit realm and get
[32:00] you to reason with the word you're in
[32:02] trouble when you start doing that right
[32:04] away a red flag ought to come up the
[32:06] next thing he does is a demon you know
[32:08] what a demon is it afflicts this body
[32:11] that's what a demon does that's what's
[32:12] happened to me there's a demon that's
[32:14] been afflicting my body since December
[32:17] and I've been calling out to God I don't
[32:19] want it you understand what I'm saying
[32:21] now God has allowed it to happen to
[32:24] whatever he's doing for me he's doing
[32:26] something for me when when he put job on
[32:29] the as sheep it wasn't to beat job down
[32:31] no right God was trying brother R said
[32:34] the reason he put him on the as sheep
[32:36] was to bring him a revelation so God
[32:38] don't do these things and allow these
[32:40] things to happen to you just because
[32:42] right so don't you get the thinking if I
[32:44] got this or I got that God's mad at me
[32:46] or here you go you start in your spirit
[32:48] realm start reasoning with it you
[32:50] understand you got a demon that afflicts
[32:52] your body you understand so that's the
[32:54] way he'll attack you and the other one
[32:56] is the third one brother says the devil
[32:58] which is the personified person of the
[33:00] devil right do you understand in the
[33:02] fourth course writer that's what's going
[33:04] to come down is the person of the devil
[33:07] does everybody understand that brother
[33:10] said the Beast will become incarnate we
[33:13] understand in the pope we understand all
[33:14] the quotes right and you go to
[33:16] Revelations 12 and I always thought and
[33:19] I think I've said that here you know we
[33:21] talk about the third part of the Angels
[33:22] fell from heaven do you agree we're cast
[33:24] down to earth we understand that right
[33:27] but gu what faith took him out sin let
[33:30] him back in as soon as Eve sinned guess
[33:33] what those third part of the Devils can
[33:35] go accuse you now don't you don't don't
[33:37] think so that Lon Spirit come before the
[33:40] Throne of God in the days of Micaiah and
[33:42] said let me get down lie to them guys he
[33:44] said go do it did he so see those Devils
[33:48] have a right to go to God and accuse you
[33:50] right but God looks at the blood and
[33:52] says what are you talking about amen I
[33:55] don't see what you're talking about amen
[33:57] because why we have received atonement
[34:00] in this hour does everybody agree with
[34:01] that so see what happens is you go look
[34:04] at it in Revelation 12 it says the devil
[34:07] and his angels are cast down out of
[34:09] heaven right you know what there's
[34:10] another casting outcome brother said
[34:13] when we go up the devil gets cast down
[34:15] and his
[34:16] demons look it's over once we go up
[34:19] there ain't no accuser of the Brethren
[34:20] man forget it when we go up the devil
[34:23] had forget it there will be no there
[34:25] will be no working on your spirit realm
[34:27] no
[34:28] your body it is over once we go up is
[34:31] that right and that's what brother said
[34:33] we go up the Devil comes down Revelation
[34:36] 12 don't he say he's thrown down to
[34:38] Earth again and he says he knows his
[34:41] time short and he's mad y that is the
[34:45] personified that is the devil right does
[34:48] everybody understand that that's who
[34:50] gets cast down out of heaven so we ain't
[34:52] got no accuser that amen but as long as
[34:54] we're here in this body he'll come every
[34:56] time we make a stupid mistake he goes
[34:58] right up Throne says look what he did
[35:01] amen does everybody agree with that but
[35:04] the blood still
[35:05] applied I have atonement for that right
[35:08] brother R said it's the blood that keeps
[35:10] you saved is that what he said it's the
[35:13] blood that keeps you saved so thank God
[35:17] for the blood you say that right but I'm
[35:19] going to tell you something you know
[35:20] what brother R said the blood is for you
[35:22] the original word sure sure that's the
[35:25] only covering you have is the original
[35:27] word
[35:28] if you ever come out from under the
[35:30] original Cur word you're in deep trouble
[35:34] you HB it you've come out from the Blood
[35:37] Cuz brother said this word is the
[35:38] bleeding word is that right this message
[35:42] I'm going to say it where you this
[35:43] message is your atonement right right do
[35:45] you realize that in every hour the
[35:48] message that gave that was the covering
[35:50] for that church that was that was Paul's
[35:53] religion in that hour is that right when
[35:55] the when the message of Paul come and it
[35:58] wasn't the fullness of it had the
[36:00] revealed part of it hadn't come right it
[36:02] was revealed in part you agree with that
[36:05] said the messenger catches the
[36:06] Revelation and drops it down the people
[36:08] well those people guess what they had
[36:10] rapturing Faith they took they they're
[36:13] bride in that hour but they without us
[36:16] cannot be made perfect because why Paul
[36:19] said he looked through a glass Darkly
[36:22] there's there's more than what Paul had
[36:24] right amen okay everybody got that so
[36:27] there what we have in this hour is a
[36:29] complete Revelation a perfect Revelation
[36:33] there's no shadow in it at all right
[36:35] what we have is the perfect light has
[36:38] come amen amen is that right that's what
[36:41] this coming in this hour and it's a
[36:43] secret coming it's a mysterious coming
[36:46] it's the coming of Revelation 10 1-6
[36:49] does everybody agree with that that's
[36:51] where the preachers are messing it up B
[36:53] and they I was reading it even in the
[36:55] breach do you understand it said he come
[36:58] he come to claim right is that right you
[37:01] know what claim means Tru right so when
[37:04] brother R puts it down here he come to
[37:05] claim what is it he's opened up the
[37:07] truth of this he's revealed It All To Us
[37:10] is that right like I told you he came
[37:12] down here at the day of pente he came to
[37:14] Paul he came to irus he came to Mark
[37:17] these were the voice of God in that hour
[37:19] weren't they each messenger he came to
[37:22] them they were the seven spirits of God
[37:25] right is that right somebody was talking
[37:27] there I said you know what your new
[37:28] birth is revelation 10:7 right brother
[37:30] said the 10:7 is the seven seal right
[37:33] exactly is that what he said so if
[37:35] you're going to get a birth in this hour
[37:37] you got to come to Revelation 107 before
[37:39] you're going to get to Seven you're
[37:40] going to have to go through 10 1-6 what
[37:43] is that it's the Thunders it that were
[37:45] uttered right is that right he couldn't
[37:47] write them the Mysteries were never
[37:48] written right right you agree right sure
[37:51] they weren't they were not made known
[37:53] until this hour amen okay so that's why
[37:56] when I talk about Mysteries I put a lot
[37:58] of emphasis on it cuz that's the new
[38:00] birth for this hour right but again you
[38:03] got to have your conduct you got to have
[38:05] your order you got to have your Doctrine
[38:08] and Mysteries is the doctrine that we
[38:10] have in this house so there's a balance
[38:12] to this thing I see a lot of people
[38:15] where they'll preach the Mysteries and
[38:16] their life's are wreck yeah yeah see you
[38:18] got it brother Brandon remember in the
[38:21] vision he had of of the the second time
[38:23] they C there were three on the back row
[38:25] out of step and brother Brown's voice
[38:27] hardoll said get in step right and what
[38:30] did he say they would sto looking at him
[38:32] well the prophet the messenger and the
[38:35] message or one amen what has people done
[38:38] in this hour they've taken their eyes
[38:39] off the message and if you don't get
[38:42] your eyes on this message you understand
[38:45] get your eyes off the world and the
[38:47] thing get your eyes in this message is
[38:49] what you need to do and what this
[38:51] message do is get you in step when they
[38:53] got in step brother BR see them go up
[38:55] right they took a Rapture everybody
[38:57] understand and brother said what is the
[39:00] hold up it's the Readiness of the bride
[39:03] God ain't waiting we ain't waiting on
[39:04] God God's waiting on us we're the ones
[39:07] that need to start getting in step with
[39:09] this message right so that's why I'm
[39:11] telling you and why I emphasize it's not
[39:14] and the Mysteries are a big big part of
[39:16] today right that's where your birth lies
[39:18] you understand but you need to get it
[39:21] all together right this bride is going
[39:23] to get it all together right does
[39:26] everybody agree what I'm saying so I'm
[39:29] I'm not I'm not trying to go over here
[39:31] and put it all I'm trying to give you a
[39:33] balance on what I'm saying it's kind of
[39:35] my disclaimer okay that we we ought we
[39:37] need to watch these things you
[39:39] understand so we understand so the white
[39:41] horse rider come out and he started
[39:43] working on her spirit realm right what
[39:45] did they do it took them into here where
[39:48] what did they do they took dogmas and
[39:49] Creeds right the first thing they
[39:52] started doing was and you talked about
[39:53] the it's true they started talking what
[39:55] was the first thing they got off from
[39:57] deity of Jesus Christ right you realize
[39:59] that's one of the first messages our
[40:01] Prophet taught in 49 he got us back on
[40:03] where they got off over here right he's
[40:06] going to turn us back to the faith of
[40:07] the original the faith of the fathers
[40:10] which was the original because look if
[40:12] you don't have the original you don't
[40:14] have the atonement right does everybody
[40:17] understand you don't have the atonement
[40:19] so what they did they got off with their
[40:21] dogmas and Creeds here what did they do
[40:23] they left the original word they bound
[40:25] the Holy Ghost because of that right so
[40:28] we understand here once that happened
[40:30] here what did he do brother said he rose
[40:33] and then he received a crown well you
[40:35] can't Crown a spirit brother B said he
[40:37] had to be a person if you're going to
[40:39] crown him you got to put him on a per
[40:40] they got a pope right what did they do
[40:42] they put a man over him what was it what
[40:44] was the white horse rider he went forth
[40:46] to conquering and to conquer right it
[40:48] was a nickan spirit that went forth
[40:51] where a man tried to come up with a
[40:53] Doctrine two Lords perusia and you know
[40:57] what you got to come to me brother
[40:58] Samuel if you're going to get peria you
[40:59] got to come to me what happens with the
[41:02] with the Antichrist writer a preacher
[41:04] old right rise up in the ranks of the
[41:07] message sure well well in the early
[41:10] church that Antichrist Spirit it didn't
[41:12] come out way out there it came right up
[41:15] among the Believers is that right he
[41:17] said there's Grievous wolves working
[41:19] Among Us now right there in sheep
[41:21] clothing but there W what were they
[41:24] doing they were bringing up reasonings
[41:25] the same went for right just a little
[41:28] bitty say there was somebody in our
[41:30] church I'm going to say it's a sister
[41:32] but she said yeah when my daughter
[41:34] turned 16 she can M pant she do what she
[41:36] wants I said where is that in the
[41:38] message yeah yeah you know that's a say
[41:43] and you know what as a pastor when a say
[41:44] Goes Forth into the church I got to kill
[41:46] that thing yes I said look you show
[41:49] somebody showed me a quote where brother
[41:50] B said when your daughter's 16 she
[41:53] started painting her face cutting her
[41:54] hair wearing where does it say that
[41:57] right does it say 18 does it say 21 if
[42:00] that Maiden lives in your house she's
[42:01] got to come under the token in your
[42:03] house the token is this
[42:05] message right that's the blood of this
[42:08] hour it's this message so I told her I
[42:11] didn't tell her I just preached it you
[42:12] know of course I got a little church
[42:14] like 40 people everybody knows who I'm
[42:16] talking
[42:17] about you know I mean you preach
[42:19] something in our church and it's like
[42:20] everybody go oh yeah yeah yeah you they
[42:23] know who you're talking it's like I told
[42:26] them I'm preaching against Spirits not
[42:27] people right and I'm not but what it is
[42:29] it's a say it's a spirit that Creeps in
[42:32] it could be a little bitty say that went
[42:34] forth right but it's contrary to the
[42:37] message and when that thing goes that's
[42:39] an antichrist right and you'll start and
[42:41] what she she reasoned with it right
[42:43] somehow I don't know how she got in her
[42:44] head that 16 was the golden number where
[42:47] the girls could do what they wanted I
[42:49] don't see it and I so I had to go out
[42:51] there and just just kill it you know
[42:54] what I mean that's what we have to do
[42:55] when we see a say or Spirit coming in
[42:58] among the church as a pastor you got to
[43:00] go out and kill that thing right cuz
[43:02] look if if a spirit gets off on this man
[43:04] young man not let it stay there get off
[43:05] on this young man it'll get off on that
[43:08] young man and you know what I'll on a
[43:10] day of judgment he'll be responsible for
[43:12] this church if he let a spirit go in
[43:15] this church knowing it was the wrong
[43:16] Spirit it wasn't according then he'll
[43:18] answer for it and that's why I take it's
[43:21] a grave responsibility when you're a
[43:22] pastor to go out there and take care of
[43:24] things that's right so I was telling
[43:26] them today do you realize when you go
[43:28] and look at the the the seventh Church
[43:31] age it says rebuke has anybody ever seen
[43:34] a message like William Braham that
[43:36] rebuked show me can anybody think of any
[43:39] messenger ever that rebuked the people
[43:42] like brother Braham did that's right so
[43:44] if you believe there's a seven Church
[43:45] age messenger then I I believe he was
[43:48] brother Brown amen you know what they in
[43:50] man on the earth that ever rebuked the
[43:52] church like he did right amen that was

[44:33] sword a bloody sword right right do you
[44:35] know the church had the original word so
[44:37] they had the bloody word sure so what
[44:40] did they combat that red horse rider
[44:42] with the original word the bloody word
[44:46] is that right so and the white horse

[46:05] amongst the message right now come on
[46:08] that's what it is right remember it's
[46:10] the bride in the church right in the
[46:13] church ages it says unto the angel of
[46:15] the church then down at the end of it it

[46:18] churches right there's the bride and
[46:21] there's the church exactly in this hour

[48:21] and sell the church and keep the
[48:24] money that's that's a Fe buddy you talk
[48:28] about a black horse rider in our M but
[48:32] I'm serious so we look at these things
[48:34] we put them back there and they're
[48:36] happening today they're happening right
[48:38] in our midst do you understand so these
[48:40] preachers will come up with the say

[48:49] influence right that's just the red
[48:51] horse riders all of this the black horse
[48:54] rider what he's a money hungry outfit
[48:56] right he wants to control everything you
[48:59] know is that right amen that's what he
[49:01] is and then you get the black horse
[49:03] rider he's all of them mixed up he's a
[49:05] real high breeded fell he's the
[49:07] personification of the devil oh yeah he
[49:10] is that's what he is does everybody
[49:12] agree with that amen that's what he is
[49:15] so let me go back and show you something
[49:18] brother said when Eve she reasoned with
[49:21] the word does everybody agree with that
[49:23] right she failed God gave her a
[49:25] substitute right you know what said D
[49:28] what did he give him he gave him a lamb
[49:30] a bloody lamb that was a substitute till
[49:32] the the full type of it the Lamb of God
[49:35] come now I'm going to say something to
[49:37] you and I know this going to be a little
[49:38] startling maybe but God when they fell
[49:40] here this eve fell God gave him a
[49:43] substitute oh
[49:46] yeah something a little pacifier to hold
[49:49] on to till the whole thing come at the
[49:51] end does everybody that's what I was
[49:53] telling you about when I say the just
[49:55] shall live by faith that was just a
[49:56] substitute now that's a hard one a it
[49:59] right that was something for that church
[50:01] to hang on to till we get down here to
[50:03] the end where he says it it's not as if
[50:06] you done it you never did it so you
[50:09] understand I don't have a substitute for
[50:11] this hour I have the fullness of the
[50:13] word and what I've been talking about to
[50:15] the church this church is a bride you
[50:18] have the fullness of the word does
[50:20] everybody understand that I don't have
[50:22] part word right I do not I have the
[50:25] fullness of the word in this
[50:27] so God through the church wouldn't he do
[50:28] it the same way he did to Eve if he
[50:31] dealt with the world he move the spirit
[50:33] on him then he sends the word ain't he
[50:35] going to do you the same way he ain't
[50:37] going to do you any different than he
[50:38] does if it's a work of bringing things
[50:40] forth right if he's going to bring some
[50:42] something fruit forth than you he's
[50:43] going to do you the same way God don't
[50:46] change his mind does everybody
[50:47] understand that that's why everybody it
[50:49] just kills me when you talk about
[50:51] Daniel's City Works they're so afraid of
[50:52] it it's Redemption to the
[50:54] Jews but yet they don't want they don't
[50:57] want that they want the Redemption to
[50:58] the G it's no different right it's not a
[51:01] bit different the way God does the je or
[51:03] if he is that he's partial right or if
[51:05] he did he changed his mind what kind of
[51:07] God do we have if he changes his mind
[51:09] about Redemption amen we're in trouble
[51:11] right so it just it just preachers
[51:15] that's all I can tell you preachers
[51:17] preachers preachers that's the problem
[51:19] so so we you you see what I'm saying you
[51:22] got the White Horse Rider red horse
[51:24] rider and then what happened when fell
[51:27] here God gave him a
[51:28] substitute he did he gave him a
[51:30] substitute part word here just a
[51:33] substitute he gave Wesley a substitute
[51:36] he gave the Pentecost a substitute they
[51:39] fell in love with the substitution right
[51:41] instead of taking the person that's
[51:43] coming this hour they fell in love with
[51:45] the substitute isn't that exactly what
[51:47] happened in the Old Testament right they
[51:49] didn't want you know John preached out
[51:52] there there's com today we won't have
[51:53] that sacrifice anymore right mad right
[51:56] they didn't want to give up the old
[51:58] substitute they held the substitute more
[52:01] important than the real so what we have
[52:04] in this message they'd rather have the
[52:05] substitute than the real then the
[52:08] Mysteries that's came contained under
[52:09] the seals they'd rather have the
[52:11] substitute I don't want the substitute I
[52:14] don't want the part I want the fullness
[52:16] of the words what I want that's what's
[52:19] been given in this hour is the fullness
[52:22] of the word amen every promise every
[52:25] verse in the book is mine and I want it
[52:28] it's mine has anybody ever seen a kid
[52:31] you hand a kid a toy and mine mine mine
[52:33] mine that's the way I am I'm just like
[52:36] it it don't bother me at all they're
[52:37] that way right you give me the Bible and
[52:39] I'm going to say it's mine mine mine
[52:42] mine and you're going to have to take it
[52:43] away from me right I seriously don't you
[52:46] hold on to this message that way you
[52:48] better hold on to the message that way
[52:50] cuz I'm going to tell you the devil's
[52:51] here to take everything away from you
[52:53] amen that's his job if he can take any
[52:56] first any promise away from you he's
[52:58] going to take it and I'm not going to
[53:00] let him take it does everybody
[53:02] understand so he gave him a substitute
[53:04] through the church ages until the real
[53:06] thing come right they couldn't take the
[53:08] real right they did it just like the Old
[53:10] Testament folks did pretty sad is it
[53:12] yeah so we got a lot of preachers that
[53:14] are holding on to the substitute and
[53:16] they won't take the real right remember
[53:18] he said the reality of it right there's
[53:20] a reason he said that so they won't take
[53:23] the reality of what we've got they want
[53:25] to substitute right that's what they
[53:27] want they say God sent a prophet you
[53:29] know brother Jess he cracked me up when
[53:31] he used to minister he said he went down
[53:33] to Mexico one time there was a preacher
[53:34] preaching there it's preached for years
[53:36] he said I'm I'm saying I'm preaching
[53:38] just what I was 25 years ago brother
[53:41] Jess was sitting on the front row stood
[53:42] straight up started hard and screaming
[53:44] Said Amen brother when he got home he
[53:46] said he is he's preaching the same thing
[53:47] I already preached 25 years he had moved
[53:50] up one bit that brother thought he was
[53:52] backing him up sister Peggy he was just
[53:54] saying absolutely you're still still
[53:56] saying the same thing you haven't moved
[53:59] up on Iota but is that what they say and
[54:02] they don't move up into Revelation the
[54:04] word see that's what we've got to do as
[54:07] a church move up Church come on up come
[54:10] up hither go up where the Revelation is
[54:12] right right so that's that's the problem
[54:15] we got they say we let's say what's said
[54:16] on tap and and what I use is this when
[54:21] Jesus was talking to Nicodemus you
[54:22] remember the story Nicodemus come to him
[54:25] said now we know
[54:27] that's pretty bad we know you're a man
[54:29] sent from God in private they can say
[54:31] that yeah he told him me said you must
[54:33] be born again he said can I call up in
[54:36] my mother's womb right he went carnal on
[54:38] him right he said you being a rabbi a
[54:42] teacher and you don't know these things
[54:45] and you know Jesus said you must be born
[54:46] again right and then you go back and you
[54:49] say and he said and you don't know these
[54:51] things so I thought well then there has
[54:53] to be the Old Testament talk about the
[54:55] new birth right well what does it talk
[54:58] about in new T Ezekiel 36 he'll give you
[55:01] a new spirit see that's where God works
[55:04] first is in your spirit realm and
[55:06] brother said he'll give you a new spirit
[55:08] de agree with the Holy Spirit right is
[55:09] that what he said right right so then he
[55:11] what he gives you a new heart right
[55:13] right that's the new birth it's telling
[55:15] you about the new and then it says and
[55:16] you do it right Does anybody read that
[55:18] little last part past the commment
[55:21] remember Ezekiel 30 says and do it right
[55:24] ain't no very many remember people in
[55:26] the Wilderness they said oh yeah Moses
[55:28] we'll do the T we'll do it they never
[55:30] did it no you know they never did they
[55:33] do it they never did it see that's the
[55:35] trouble we have in the message right
[55:37] when I'm talking about conduct things
[55:39] they don't do that part of it they want
[55:41] a new spirit they want a new heart but
[55:43] they don't want to go do it right right
[55:45] so see what the new birth is it's going
[55:46] to be all those things come together
[55:49] right right so Nic Jesus paraphrased it
[55:52] now people in the message would say say
[55:54] only what say on tap so if I said that
[55:57] today they say you're not saying what we
[55:58] hear Brown said is that what they would
[56:00] say right that's the point I was making
[56:02] they don't mix it with faith right and
[56:04] and I'll be honest I paraphrase a lot
[56:07] but I keep the continuity of what the
[56:08] message says right I tell the church
[56:10] back home I use okon you've heard me say
[56:13] that this guy talks in whatever Georgia
[56:15] whatever it is right but he keeps the
[56:17] continuity of the scripture right but
[56:19] boy if you come up with something it's
[56:20] just not verbatim What brother Bram said
[56:23] some of these preachers will look at say
[56:24] you're not saying what brother Bram said
[56:26] they don't have enough Faith to
[56:27] understand brother said if you got the
[56:29] Holy Ghost you'll amen the word right
[56:31] Jesus paraphrased the word if anything
[56:34] Nicodemus the smart thing would have
[56:36] said to be say Amen right right even
[56:39] though he didn't understand it if he'd
[56:41] have been smart he'd have just said amen
[56:43] right is that right then God would have
[56:45] revealed it to him instead of doing that
[56:48] he he starts saying he starts reasoning
[56:50] with it right right that's what he did
[56:52] but so that's the complaint I have about
[56:55] message they ain't got enough hold Holy
[56:56] Ghost to where if you pray paraphrase a
[56:58] quote or something they can't get it
[57:01] right right well like you said they're
[57:03] readers see it's proof what I agree
[57:05] totally with what you say I see that so
[57:07] it just irritates me now I wish you had
[57:10] never told me that cuz it really
[57:12] irritates but it's the truth if you
[57:15] don't say it verbatim like brother Ram
[57:17] said you're not saying what brother Ram
[57:19] said they don't have enough Holy Ghost
[57:20] to read between the lines it's not a
[57:23] love letter to them do you understand
[57:24] what I'm saying there's the problem we
[57:27] have in the message right they don't
[57:29] understand the love level okay okay so
[57:33] we understand how we understand the
[57:35] first seal second seal third fourth now
[57:37] look this one's reality this is all
[57:39] three forms are done you agree with that
[57:42] the mystery of it been made known to us
[57:44] the reality form of it he started his
[57:46] dve back here on the day of Pentecost
[57:48] right and we understand that the uh the
[57:51] so of reality the mystery and the symbol
[57:54] form it's done the first first seal done
[57:57] we understand it second seal same way
[58:00] right it's over third seal same way
[58:03] right now the force SE we know the
[58:05] mystery of it but that Beast hasn't
[58:07] taken his right yet because look I have
[58:10] to go up before that Ral comes down so
[58:14] the reality form is not here yet it's
[58:16] not physically here on the earth yet but
[58:19] the spirit of it here do you agree that
[58:23] that what is it death what is it
[58:25] organization
[58:27] denm and brother the four seal this is
[58:29] what he hits in the four seal a lot he
[58:31] talks about ISM he said communism
[58:35] fascism and what's the other one
[58:37] communism fascism Nazism ism is a
[58:42] spirit if there's an ism that comes in
[58:44] the church it's a spirit amen is that
[58:48] does everybody got that and
[58:50] denominationalism is a spirit right the
[58:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost is a spirit
[58:56] ISM baptism so anytime you see ISM on it
[58:59] it's a spirit so you have to see what
[59:02] the spirit of it is what drives that
[59:04] thing right right so see that's what
[59:06] we've had in the message we've had
[59:07] brother Braham to come and we don't have
[59:10] to be deceived we know every ISM out
[59:13] there we understand Nazism socialism
[59:16] communism right right we understand all
[59:19] that romanism right come on so anytime
[59:23] you put ISM on the end of it what is it
[59:25] it's a spirit drives that so brother man
[59:28] the fourth course writer told us all
[59:30] these things we understand what's coming
[59:33] up don't we understand don't we
[59:35] understand that Devil's going to take
[59:36] them to the battle of Armageddon like I
[59:39] said the first W the second W the third
[59:41] W first world W was World War I second W
[59:44] was World War II does everybody agree
[59:46] with that so we we understand that isms
[59:49] is nothing more than a spirit right so
[59:52] if there's an ism that rises up in this
[59:54] church it's simply a spirit
[59:56] right and this man has to take care of
[59:59] anything that's not the Holy Spirit
[1:00:03] right okay so we and it's death what
[1:00:06] follows those isms what follows
[1:00:08] denominational ISM death it's received a
[1:00:11] name is that right so we've got a name
[1:00:14] for the fourth horse riter he's
[1:00:16] dead I know what it's going to be it's
[1:00:19] just not a reality yet right until I go
[1:00:22] up he comes down now brother B when he
[1:00:25] starts to look at the the fifth seal
[1:00:27] brother Bram does something in the fifth
[1:00:29] seal I was looking at it brother Bram
[1:00:31] starts talking about himself quite a bit
[1:00:33] oh yeah I going to tell you something
[1:00:34] about the fifth seal you won't
[1:00:35] understand it if you don't accept that
[1:00:37] prophit he can he can prove the first FL
[1:00:40] he can prove the first FL by history
[1:00:42] right can he oh brother said this the
[1:00:46] seals blend perfectly in with the church
[1:00:48] agents and it doesen is that right
[1:00:51] brother brand could take the first seal
[1:00:52] the second F third he said the the black
[1:00:54] horse rider was the Dark Ages how much
[1:00:57] simpler can you get than that exactly he
[1:00:59] can prove that by history is that right
[1:01:02] fif seal is a little different yeah a
[1:01:04] fifth seal you're going to start I'm
[1:01:06] going to tell you if you don't take
[1:01:07] brother random as your Prophet you ain't
[1:01:08] going to make it you ain't going to get
[1:01:10] it that's right I know that sounds odd
[1:01:13] no it doesn't you know that the truth
[1:01:16] you got to have a prophet to guide you
[1:01:17] through that F seal I'm going to tell
[1:01:19] you brother R went strong on it
[1:01:21] everybody agree with that am now I'm
[1:01:23] going to tell you something I don't know
[1:01:24] if you thought of it let's go read it uh
[1:01:26] you got that scripture don't you re uh
[1:01:28] St Matthew uh 24 9-13 I told Brother
[1:01:32] Joseph to get it I hope you got it you
[1:01:35] got it brother
[1:01:40] Joseph there you go now brother brand
[1:01:43] said that from 249 to 13 was the the
[1:01:47] seal do you agree with that what he said
[1:01:49] now let me show you something then shall
[1:01:51] they deliver you up to be afflicted and
[1:01:53] shall kill you and you shall be hat of
[1:01:55] All Nation for my name's sake do the
[1:01:58] Jews believe in his
[1:02:00] name this is a fifth seal right see what
[1:02:03] people always what you this is what I
[1:02:05] thought of when I looked at you look at
[1:02:07] the fifth seal and brother R and what we
[1:02:09] always do is we say the fifth seal is is
[1:02:12] those is those 6 million Jews that died
[1:02:15] under Hitler and he did say that so let
[1:02:17] me ask you something if the fifth seals
[1:02:19] the Jews what's it have to do with me
[1:02:23] right you ever think of it you think of
[1:02:26] come on open up think about it if it's
[1:02:28] got to do with just those Marty Jews
[1:02:31] then what does it have to do with me
[1:02:33] right does everybody agree with that
[1:02:35] does you understand brother said that
[1:02:37] fifth seal is the martyrdom seal right
[1:02:39] the Seal of the martyrs there were 68
[1:02:41] million that died for his name sake
[1:02:44] those 68 million died under the fifth
[1:02:47] seal
[1:02:49] righten yeah you see what I'm saying
[1:02:52] right the 68 million died under the
[1:02:55] Martyr sea
[1:02:57] the 12 apostles were Marty sure they
[1:02:59] were that's who he's talking to here
[1:03:01] right right they died under a martyr
[1:03:03] seal they died under the fifth
[1:03:06] seal I know I see you guys you haven't
[1:03:08] heard this before I know well but you
[1:03:10] have I'm bringing it a little different
[1:03:12] approach maybe the fifth seal is a
[1:03:14] martyr seal didn't he say it's a mar Dum
[1:03:16] seal and I got that when I got thing I
[1:03:18] thought well you know if if the seals
[1:03:21] are to the Gentiles is that what he
[1:03:23] said and the trumpets are to the Jews
[1:03:26] yeah so if the seals are to the Gentiles
[1:03:28] the fifth seal is totally to the Jew
[1:03:31] then there's something wrong with the
[1:03:32] picture it has to apply to us also does
[1:03:36] everybody understand the fifth seal has
[1:03:40] to apply to us so then you got to ask
[1:03:43] yourself how does it apply to the
[1:03:45] Gentiles is everybody okay with what I'm
[1:03:47] saying amen so brother Rand the fifth
[1:03:49] seal is now going to start breaking it
[1:03:51] down and explaining how the fifth seal
[1:03:55] applies to us right now we think of the
[1:03:57] Jews that were killed the 6 million I've
[1:04:00] got in my paper here I read to the
[1:04:02] church in in
[1:04:04] 1290 ad the King Edward of England was
[1:04:07] killing Jews he dismissed them from
[1:04:09] England put them on boats and they
[1:04:10] drowned out in the
[1:04:11] sea is that right you're saying okay so
[1:04:14] you know so those Jews died under the
[1:04:16] Martyr sealen they they found in Wells
[1:04:20] in England where the a whole Jewish Clan
[1:04:22] was killed and thrown head first into
[1:04:23] the well so see what did they die for
[1:04:26] strictly being a Jew is what brother R
[1:04:29] said that just didn't happen under
[1:04:31] Hitler and Hyman right does everybody
[1:04:33] understand the Jews started being look
[1:04:35] the father brother BR said the father
[1:04:37] blinded them does everybody agree with
[1:04:39] that right now what brother brand what I
[1:04:41] think is so perfect about the fifth seal
[1:04:43] he's showing how not all of Israel will
[1:04:45] be saved does everybody agree with that
[1:04:47] not one of Israel true Israel will be
[1:04:50] lost I think that's a marvelous
[1:04:53] Revelation because look all the bride
[1:04:56] will be saved do you agree but all
[1:04:58] that's bride is not bride you can sit
[1:05:01] right here in our midst and say you're
[1:05:02] bride and you're not
[1:05:04] bride I hope that's not true what I just
[1:05:07] said but does everybody got what I'm
[1:05:08] saying he said all of Israel is not
[1:05:11] Israel does everybody agree with that
[1:05:13] statement but all of Israel shall be
[1:05:16] saved and the father blinded them you
[1:05:19] agree with that the father blind but he
[1:05:22] didn't lose one of them he blinded that
[1:05:24] was Israel true Israel they had their
[1:05:27] name on the book before the foundational
[1:05:28] World cuz remember this plan that we got
[1:05:31] is the he was talking we talking about
[1:05:33] it's the Plan of Redemption as part of
[1:05:35] the plan of it was all done before the
[1:05:37] foundation the book was in before the
[1:05:40] foundation of the world your name was
[1:05:41] put on a book before all that the father
[1:05:44] hath given me will come to me if the
[1:05:46] fifth seal should give you one thing it
[1:05:48] ought to give you aurity if your name is
[1:05:51] on the book and if you got the Mysteries
[1:05:54] the Mysteries are calling your name
[1:05:56] that's on the book right does everybody
[1:05:58] understand the Mysteries are calling
[1:05:59] your name right God ain't giving you a
[1:06:02] revelation just to fluff something right
[1:06:05] no God don't do something just to be
[1:06:07] doing just beating his gums like we do
[1:06:10] most of the time God's not like that no
[1:06:13] so the fifth seal has to be of the
[1:06:15] Gentiles do you agree right it has to be
[1:06:19] but it's the Martyr seal right so we
[1:06:21] need to go in here we need to understand
[1:06:23] what is he talking about exactly brother
[1:06:25] R takes us right here to this and what
[1:06:28] really caught my K says and I thought I
[1:06:30] why why why what is it about the fifth
[1:06:32] seal that applies to us J it's a seal
[1:06:34] it's to us right the trumpets are to
[1:06:37] Israel you agree he says the same thing
[1:06:40] he preached them supernaturally
[1:06:41] underneath the seal right so what does
[1:06:43] he do he says for my name's sake the
[1:06:45] Jews don't have his name they have the
[1:06:47] testimony of the word right and they
[1:06:49] what it says under the fifth seal he
[1:06:51] said they died for the testimony that
[1:06:54] they held it was the testimony of the
[1:06:56] word but it was not what they held the
[1:06:58] law the Jews stayed true to the law and
[1:07:03] they died because of it made them A
[1:07:05] peculiar people and nobody likes
[1:07:06] somebody different right that's why they
[1:07:08] want to kill you cuz you're different
[1:07:11] right you're a peculiar you're a one-of
[1:07:13] a kind people they don't like you they
[1:07:14] didn't like the Jews they're not going
[1:07:15] to like you they really don't want us
[1:07:17] here and one day we're not going to be
[1:07:19] here thank God for that that's right so
[1:07:23] ye shall be hated of all Nations for my
[1:07:25] name sake right that's not talking about
[1:07:27] the Jew do you agree with that that's
[1:07:30] the Gentile but brother use this passage
[1:07:33] of scripture to bring it to us right now
[1:07:36] look 68 million Protestants died a
[1:07:40] martyr's death go read it under Fox's
[1:07:43] book of Martyrs right brother so look
[1:07:46] what is if it's a martyr seal now look
[1:07:48] at the way brother B when he starts to
[1:07:50] really break it down he said Uriah Smith
[1:07:53] Barry l or Barry L that's a Bic
[1:07:55] player I used to follow B I love
[1:07:58] baseball play for
[1:08:02] the was
[1:08:04] L I told myself there didn't I that came
[1:08:08] back that's my that's my
[1:08:12] memory there's that thing you got to
[1:08:14] watch out for Mr memory
[1:08:16] okay so under under the mar seal there
[1:08:19] were 68 million Protestants killed right
[1:08:23] right now those 6 now brandom starts
[1:08:26] explaining something under the fifth
[1:08:27] seal which I thought was real we were
[1:08:28] talking about and you hit on I told him
[1:08:30] I said you're hitting on what I'm going
[1:08:32] to talk about and what I really said it
[1:08:33] was timeout quit you're taking my fire
[1:08:37] you know you know you can take a
[1:08:38] preacher's fire if you ain't care of
[1:08:40] well you can that's why you don't want a
[1:08:42] song leader get up here and carry on in
[1:08:44] the Pulpit right he's supposed to be a
[1:08:46] song
[1:08:47] leader okay thank you right Jess used to
[1:08:51] tell me that you got mad let me tell you
[1:08:53] what happened our church one time I used
[1:08:56] to go up and start C and I got to and I
[1:08:58] sang that uh you know uh about the dove
[1:09:01] on the wings of a snow white dove and I
[1:09:03] said well did you know and when I just
[1:09:05] come out said well brother Claud stole
[1:09:06] my fire that's what I'm preaching on
[1:09:07] tonight so you step behind the pulpit
[1:09:10] there's an anointing there right as a
[1:09:12] song leader you'll get an anointing and
[1:09:13] take his fire it's why you need to be
[1:09:16] careful that's why brother Ram said you
[1:09:18] don't want a song leader carries on
[1:09:20] right is that what he said okay I
[1:09:22] believe everything he said the little
[1:09:24] things the big things Amen in between
[1:09:26] things I really believe it I don't
[1:09:28] believe brother R was just throwing
[1:09:29] fluff out your hor I don't think he was
[1:09:31] filling space on pages I do not believe
[1:09:34] that I believe it we'll come under the
[1:09:36] conduct of every quote of this message
[1:09:39] right it'll it'll bring value you
[1:09:42] understand right so these were killed
[1:09:44] for his name's sake we understand under
[1:09:46] the fifth seal everybody everybody's
[1:09:49] read to they died for the testimony or
[1:09:51] not the testimony of Jesus Christ for
[1:09:53] the word of God right they didn't know
[1:09:56] Jesus Christ they rep the Aton exactly
[1:09:58] they didn't know the Christ at all did
[1:10:00] they so this right here under the fifth
[1:10:02] seal is talking about us
[1:10:04] Gentiles we're the ones that died for
[1:10:06] his name's sake this 68 million you
[1:10:09] either believe you claim to be a
[1:10:12] Christian and they killed you right
[1:10:14] right you claim to be Catholic life was
[1:10:17] good you know of course they had brother
[1:10:19] said they had it easy right they claimed
[1:10:22] to be they took him out and killed him
[1:10:23] we claim to be a Christian and the
[1:10:24] devil's every devil and hell was aim at
[1:10:26] us right everybody understand that it
[1:10:29] talks about the trumpets you know it
[1:10:31] says the river your fredes right brother
[1:10:33] said they're already loosed so I don't
[1:10:35] try to go explain the trumpet I believe
[1:10:37] a lot of it's already been done right
[1:10:39] right now can I explain every minute
[1:10:41] detail of it I don't can you can you put
[1:10:43] a quote with every one of them I can but
[1:10:46] a large portion of those trumpets are
[1:10:48] already fulfill brother said all seven
[1:10:52] trumpets sound under the six seal man
[1:10:54] exactly is that what he said yeah okay a
[1:10:58] little more to that than what you think
[1:10:59] too I might bring in a minute so it
[1:11:01] talks about his namesake so they were
[1:11:03] martyred right brother BR what he then
[1:11:05] what he started to do and he said okay
[1:11:07] remember Uriah Smith he said he believed
[1:11:09] that the only altar there was in heaven
[1:11:10] was the incense altar right that's in
[1:11:13] chapter 5 of Revelation where the oders
[1:11:15] were poured out on the altar right the
[1:11:17] prayer of the Saints so he could see
[1:11:19] that so brother Rand in the fifth seal
[1:11:22] of course he does soul sleeping that we
[1:11:23] talked about too don't believe in Soul
[1:11:26] sleeping here that's right they're not
[1:11:27] sleeping right amen they're not they're
[1:11:30] in the sixth Dimension they're not
[1:11:33] sleeping everybody understand that
[1:11:35] brother cleared that doctr out so in the
[1:11:37] fifth seal what he's talking about it's
[1:11:39] a martyr seal 68 million of were Marty
[1:11:43] so brother Brown then what he starts
[1:11:44] doing watch real careful how he he
[1:11:47] starts explaining about the ones in the
[1:11:48] sixth Dimension they're under the altar
[1:11:51] of Jesus Christ they died for the
[1:11:53] testimony of Jesus Christ exactly now
[1:11:55] they died under the Martyr seal but they
[1:11:58] didn't stay under the Martyr altar they
[1:12:01] went to the altar of Jesus Christ so
[1:12:03] Brother renam Talks of three altars
[1:12:06] in the fifth seal it's the incense altar
[1:12:10] the altar sacrifice Jesus Christ and he
[1:12:13] talks about the martys AL do everybody
[1:12:15] understand that so this is the way God
[1:12:17] does it through the church if it's a Jew
[1:12:19] that died now he's not going to lose a
[1:12:20] one I think that's beautiful guys they
[1:12:23] were blinded in part the fullness of the
[1:12:26] Gentiles come in so if they were a Jew
[1:12:28] and they stayed true to the law they
[1:12:31] stayed true to what they
[1:12:32] knew right then God put them under a
[1:12:35] martyr altar the Jew the Gentile the 68
[1:12:38] million that were killed under the fifth
[1:12:40] seal right he put them under the altar
[1:12:43] of Jesus Christ now we don't have to
[1:12:45] wonder brother am the fit seal told us
[1:12:48] that what did he do in the fifth seal he
[1:12:49] said remember that 92y old lady that was
[1:12:52] saved in one of his men he went up there
[1:12:54] she had a white Rob
[1:12:55] right see they're not going to go to the
[1:12:57] white Throne judgment they got a white
[1:12:59] Ro what would be the purpose in sending
[1:13:01] people in the sixth Dimension that's
[1:13:03] under the altar of sacrifice to the
[1:13:06] white Throne what are you going to get
[1:13:09] there right is he going to condemn them
[1:13:11] is he going to give them eternal life
[1:13:13] there they already got it they already
[1:13:17] have a white Ro is everybody got it so
[1:13:20] what they did
[1:13:21] brother and that's what I said this
[1:13:23] morning there a reason I said it brother
[1:13:25] Ram said when they cut Jesus off at the
[1:13:27] crucifixion right he quit dealing with
[1:13:29] him as a nation right right he's not
[1:13:31] going to deal with him again as the
[1:13:32] nation until he sends him two prophets
[1:13:33] to then it's over for us right yet there
[1:13:37] will not be another Gentile saved once
[1:13:39] he goes is that what he said that's
[1:13:40] right what I said it's what he said so
[1:13:43] what did he do brother said he'll save
[1:13:46] individual Jews that'll come what under
[1:13:48] the testimony of Jesus christly what did
[1:13:51] he do on the day of his individual Jews
[1:13:54] does everybody it was indvidual Jews on
[1:13:56] the day of PC were saved the Jews were
[1:13:58] already the nation was cut off When They
[1:14:00] Crucified it that's the point I was
[1:14:02] making it goes right back to the fifth
[1:14:03] seal is where it'll take you back to
[1:14:06] look when we chopped him up on our
[1:14:08] conference room he quit dealing with uh
[1:14:10] with the church ages now he brought us
[1:14:12] into a bright age now he deals with us
[1:14:15] as an individual does everybody got what
[1:14:17] I'm saying he's not going to deal with
[1:14:19] Lula church as a church right Luther he
[1:14:22] could deal with them as a church right
[1:14:24] right you see what I'm saying but he
[1:14:26] don't deal with us as a church we're in
[1:14:28] the bright age he deals with you
[1:14:31] individually that's why the point I was
[1:14:32] trying to expl if you're going to
[1:14:34] understand a fifth seal you have to
[1:14:36] understand he deals with you as an
[1:14:38] individual right forget the church deal
[1:14:41] okay remember Luther was a reformer
[1:14:45] right you go look up the word what did
[1:14:46] he do he reformed a church all he did
[1:14:49] was create another organization he
[1:14:51] didn't but the ones that followed him
[1:14:52] did exctly Brother Bram did not create
[1:14:54] an organiz
[1:14:56] brother random was a restorer he was
[1:14:58] like you said He restored the altar your
[1:15:00] heart it's not going to take me to a
[1:15:02] church it's going to take me to a rde
[1:15:04] right exactly that's what this message
[1:15:06] does I'm not trying to create a church
[1:15:09] Glory brother R wasn't trying he didn't
[1:15:11] even want them to call it brandom
[1:15:12] Tabernacle he wanted to his name so
[1:15:15] disassociated with the church right he
[1:15:18] said don't call it to brandom Tabernacle
[1:15:21] but they did it so he went along with
[1:15:23] what they did see it's not the church
[1:15:25] it's the bride we're in the bride age
[1:15:27] does everybody got that right forget the
[1:15:30] church those are lodges over there if
[1:15:32] you come here and it's a you say I
[1:15:35] belong to the Lula Church yeah I belong
[1:15:38] to the Spoken Word Church you're belong
[1:15:40] to a
[1:15:41] lodge exactly all you're here for is the
[1:15:44] Breads and the
[1:15:45] fishes you better come for one purpose
[1:15:47] and that's that the reveal words being
[1:15:49] preached in this church is that's your
[1:15:52] mate that's the bright Ang
[1:15:55] EXA amen so we understand under that
[1:15:59] fifth seal is the Martyr seal anybody
[1:16:01] that gets marted goes under that seal
[1:16:02] yeah anybody if the mar seal that's what
[1:16:05] he said that's not what I said what he
[1:16:06] said but if you have the testimony of
[1:16:08] Jesus Christ you're go to the altar of
[1:16:09] Jesus Christ the Jews went under the
[1:16:11] altar of the martyrs does everybody
[1:16:13] agree with that explain that yeah I did
[1:16:16] I just want to go over it one more time
[1:16:17] you did good you did good I know I got
[1:16:20] 30 minutes ter but hang on bu that was
[1:16:23] 30 minutes that was 30 minutes ago I
[1:16:25] know so what does when the fifth seal
[1:16:28] opens does everybody agree with that
[1:16:30] that's right when the F fifth seal opens
[1:16:33] what does he do he leaves and he comes
[1:16:36] down to the Martyr altar yeah and
[1:16:39] brother and I he didn't say this and it
[1:16:41] seals he says it later on he pulls those
[1:16:43] Jews out from under the Martyr Altar and
[1:16:45] puts them under the altar of Jesus and
[1:16:47] he gives them white robes you agree with
[1:16:50] that they're under the Martyr altar but
[1:16:52] they don't have the Holy Ghost how could
[1:16:55] they have the Holy Ghost when all they
[1:16:56] had was the law right exactly amen does
[1:16:59] everybody agree with that so what
[1:17:01] brother Ram said they were under all
[1:17:03] those Jews that were killed through the
[1:17:05] church ages they were blinded so God
[1:17:07] didn't lose the one don't you think
[1:17:08] that's wonderful I think it's wonderful
[1:17:11] right not one of Israel was lost all of
[1:17:13] Israel shall be saved and the fifth seal
[1:17:17] it's proven his word to us right so
[1:17:20] every one of those Jews that were killed
[1:17:21] under martyrdom through the church Ages
[1:17:24] were under the Martyr seal he comes down
[1:17:27] when we go up then he goes down deals
[1:17:29] with the Jews in the fifth seal the
[1:17:32] first thing he does he talks to those
[1:17:33] Souls that are under the altar right
[1:17:35] under the martyr's Altar and what does
[1:17:38] he do he moves them up here he tells
[1:17:39] them who he is they recognize Jesus now
[1:17:42] they don't just have the testimony of
[1:17:44] the father they have the testimony of
[1:17:46] Jesus Christ they're given white robes
[1:17:49] now I'm going to tell you something they
[1:17:50] don't go to the Judgment either right
[1:17:52] why would they go to the white Throne
[1:17:54] judgment if they got white robes insane
[1:17:56] to do that what would they be judged for
[1:17:59] he already said they're good I'll give
[1:18:02] them the White Road they were given
[1:18:04] White Road is that right then he goes
[1:18:07] down and he deals with the
[1:18:09] 144,000 what does he do he gives them
[1:18:11] the white Ro what is it it's a baptism
[1:18:13] of the Holy Ghost he gives them eternal
[1:18:16] life is what he gives does everybody
[1:18:17] understand that so the 144,000 will not
[1:18:20] be at the white Throne the martyrs that
[1:18:22] were martyred through the church ages
[1:18:24] the true Jew to stay true to the law
[1:18:27] will not go to the white Throne that's
[1:18:29] right exactly amen oh those are going
[1:18:32] end up Millennial yeah exactly every one
[1:18:34] of them right every one of them end up
[1:18:37] in the millennial amen when I read this
[1:18:40] this time I said oh man I was excited
[1:18:43] about cuz now what brother R does he
[1:18:46] explains the different altars to us
[1:18:48] nobody knew that before the fifth seal
[1:18:51] if you're going to understand the fifth
[1:18:53] seal if you're going to understand he
[1:18:55] grants eternal life you're going to have
[1:18:57] to take your profit to do it right
[1:18:59] you're this is what's going to split
[1:19:01] people that's what's happening out in
[1:19:03] the message that's why people are
[1:19:04] falling away they never really believed
[1:19:06] brother R was a prophet right they never
[1:19:09] did if they believed he was it's just
[1:19:11] like me I am so committed to believing
[1:19:13] even though he said this over here and
[1:19:14] this over there I was going to drop out
[1:19:16] of the message are you going to drop out
[1:19:18] a message to Mark how many quotes do you

[1:19:24] go along the more Revelation I get I
[1:19:26] read this one and that one it
[1:19:28] goes I mean I literally my eyes bug

[1:21:43] kind of do that does everybody
[1:21:46] understand this is the Feast of
[1:21:48] Pentecost yeah right it was what 49 7 7
[1:21:53] what happened here every seven there was
[1:21:55] a trumpet blown on the S the these
[1:21:58] people entered into their rest and there
[1:21:59] was a trumpet Bor BL Paul was the
[1:22:02] trumpet if a trumpet give an UNC Paul
[1:22:04] was the trumpet to this age the people
[1:22:06] that accepted that
[1:22:08] sound went with him and they entered
[1:22:10] into their arrest does everybody agree
[1:22:12] with everywhere here that's the seven
[1:22:14] trumpets right right
[1:22:17] sure right brother Brandon preaches the
[1:22:20] Feast of the trumpets and he mentions
[1:22:22] the seven trumpets it has nothing to do
[1:22:23] with the Feast of the Trump trumpets
[1:22:25] right now that's going to sound a little
[1:22:26] hard is now let me tell you why okay let
[1:22:31] me tell you why this is the Feast of
[1:22:33] Pentecost at the end of it when that
[1:22:35] Mighty Angel come that was the Jubilee
[1:22:37] or the shout does everybody agree with
[1:22:38] that we have entered into 50s right yeah
[1:22:42] which is the Jubilee remember the quote
[1:22:44] brother Ram said when the Jubilee come
[1:22:46] you can throw down your hoe right but
[1:22:47] until that happen keep hoing exactly I'm
[1:22:49] not hoing right right I've entered into
[1:22:52] my Jubilee I've thrown mine down ceased
[1:22:54] from my Works does everybody understand
[1:22:57] we're looking for something to happen
[1:22:58] when it's already
[1:23:00] happened I ain't
[1:23:02] holding I'm like Ruth I'm resting it's a
[1:23:06] relaxing time is that what seven seal he
[1:23:09] said relaxing time what was it the
[1:23:11] coming of the Lord what was it when he
[1:23:13] indicted him here he end the church
[1:23:15] agents were dying I'm going to be honest
[1:23:17] God don't Church forget it he's on the
[1:23:19] outside look at that amen but out here
[1:23:21] in the bright age when the Jubilee come
[1:23:24] here's you owed no man nothing right
[1:23:27] right you didn't have fornication you
[1:23:28] you went back to the original right
[1:23:30] right does everybody understand that
[1:23:32] right at the Jubilee you went back to
[1:23:34] the original at the time of this we go
[1:23:36] back to the original Faith that's what
[1:23:37] literally turned our heart back right
[1:23:40] everybody got what I'm saying that's
[1:23:41] where at now look when this trumpet blew
[1:23:44] this trumpet here the Jubilee blew in
[1:23:46] the Tabernacle first yeah that priest
[1:23:49] got on an old donkey and rode him for a
[1:23:52] year through the land I believe that's
[1:23:55] why he's riding this Trail again if I'm
[1:23:58] going to take that quote and put it in
[1:23:59] the Bible I'm going to put it there you
[1:24:01] saying I'm taking a lot on myself I
[1:24:03] believe it did he on when that Jubilee
[1:24:07] sounded he blew in the Tabernacle around
[1:24:09] preach the seals in the Tabernacle first
[1:24:12] right is that what he said right the
[1:24:14] Lord promised him he'd go to the
[1:24:15] Tabernacle first that goes right along
[1:24:17] with the scripture that ain't a mistake
[1:24:20] exactly so what did he blew the trumpet
[1:24:22] there then that that priest gets on that
[1:24:25] donkey and he rides it through all of
[1:24:27] Israel right and he blows the trumpet
[1:24:30] through Israel and everybody that's
[1:24:33] hoing ters when they hear the sound of
[1:24:36] the trumpet they throw it down look I've
[1:24:39] heard the sound I'm not going to hold
[1:24:41] Tas in right forget the t hold is over
[1:24:45] for me right it is come on let's just be
[1:24:49] real about
[1:24:51] it I understand what preachers are
[1:24:53] saying when they say
[1:24:54] but if I've entered into my rest I've
[1:24:57] gone back to the original I get my
[1:24:58] original possession my and what what did
[1:25:01] he do down here to do brother said he
[1:25:04] come here to to Proclaim right what was
[1:25:07] rightfully his exactly has anybody ever
[1:25:09] looked up the word claim look if I know
[1:25:12] that brother you do woodworking I think
[1:25:14] don't you if I if you were doing it for
[1:25:16] a house and they didn't pay you you'd go
[1:25:18] down and put a lean on their house right
[1:25:20] right now that lean is the truth that
[1:25:23] they owe you money right right so you
[1:25:26] got a claim on the property right look
[1:25:28] when Jesus come down here at the end
[1:25:30] time to what claim his property exactly
[1:25:33] it's what did he do he opened the seals
[1:25:35] which was what the Thunder's truth right
[1:25:38] and he proclaimed it in all the land he
[1:25:41] proclaimed it what did he proclaim the
[1:25:43] truth has come and I could go free
[1:25:45] there's no lean against me there's no
[1:25:48] sin there's nothing against me that can
[1:25:50] stop me now so forget the potato ho
[1:25:55] I'm through holding containers right
[1:25:57] really I am right right amen so this was
[1:26:01] brother get the quote up I gave in uh
[1:26:04] questions answers in 64 on 08 30 I think
[1:26:08] so brother Bram when he's preaching on
[1:26:10] the seven or see this is what we think
[1:26:13] in our mind we think when brother br's
[1:26:15] preaching on the last trumpets he's
[1:26:17] preaching on the seven trumpets yeah no
[1:26:20] he's not when he's talking about the
[1:26:23] last trumpets it's two trumpets to
[1:26:26] Israel the Feast of the trumpets was two
[1:26:29] silver trumpets that were blown in
[1:26:32] Israel right does everybody understand
[1:26:34] what I'm saying that's what he's talking
[1:26:36] who are those two trumpets Moses and
[1:26:39] Elijah to Israel so brother Ma look what
[1:26:43] he says here I want you to read this
[1:26:45] like the other day now brother M is
[1:26:47] preaching this requ 08:23 he preached
[1:26:50] the seven Trump or the Feast of the
[1:26:52] trumpets 07 707 you agree right now
[1:26:56] 7even is the equal July is equal to
[1:26:58] October mhm so he was preaching the
[1:27:01] Feast of the trumpets when the October
[1:27:04] the 1st of October is when those two
[1:27:06] silver trumpets sounded which
[1:27:08] corresponds back to our calendar in in
[1:27:10] July does everybody got that right if
[1:27:12] you don't he'll explain it he say right
[1:27:15] like the other day I got something mixed
[1:27:17] up now he's saying that's why I told you
[1:27:20] if brother BR mxed up messed up Daniel
[1:27:22] 70 weeks he would have told you right
[1:27:24] brother telling you here I messed
[1:27:25] something up in the east of the trumpets
[1:27:28] that's what he's saying is that what
[1:27:29] he's saying listen as I read it like the
[1:27:32] other day I got something mixed up I
[1:27:33] happened to hear it and I caught it
[1:27:36] right there and it's on the tape right
[1:27:38] and I'll probably hear from it right
[1:27:40] when I was talking about the seven
[1:27:42] trumpets I said it was seven trumpets I
[1:27:45] was referring to the Pentecostal Feast
[1:27:48] the Pentecostal Feast is the long Feast
[1:27:50] of seven Church ages right so when
[1:27:53] you're talking about the seven trumpets
[1:27:55] it's talking about the church Angel the
[1:27:57] seven trumpets you agree sure I said it
[1:28:01] was a I was referring to the Pentecost
[1:28:03] from the Pentecostal Feast until the
[1:28:05] seven until the trumpets there was seven
[1:28:08] sabbaths seven Sabbath was between the
[1:28:11] Feast of Passover to Pentecost Pentecost
[1:28:14] penty means 50 right right right right
[1:28:17] you see which made the 50 days see but
[1:28:21] what I was referring to being that I
[1:28:23] said that means needs of seven Church
[1:28:25] ages when you're referring to seven
[1:28:27] trumpets is referring to seven Church
[1:28:29] ages right when brother man's talking
[1:28:31] about the feast to the trumpets he's
[1:28:33] talking about Two Trumpets right what is
[1:28:35] those two trumpets going to bring Israel
[1:28:37] the atonement right what did they leave
[1:28:40] off they took the law that's why I told
[1:28:43] you that Elijah that comes is not going
[1:28:44] to turn their hearts back to the
[1:28:46] apostolic father they never left the law
[1:28:48] right they have kept the law so he's not
[1:28:51] going to have to do that work that's why
[1:28:53] they doing three and years took us 2000
[1:28:55] right right that's right
[1:28:57] am we messed up the law so bad it's
[1:29:00] pathetic right that's what I hate people
[1:29:02] you go to any denominational church tell
[1:29:05] me if I'm right they'll say oh that was
[1:29:07] under the law I got a guy that comes to
[1:29:09] our church he was married to but before
[1:29:11] he came to our church now he's coming
[1:29:13] real good saintly brother I love him to
[1:29:15] death but his wife wasn't happy with him
[1:29:19] so he went to the preacher there in his
[1:29:21] nominal church and said well I don't
[1:29:23] believe God God wants you to live
[1:29:25] unhappy so you put him away you divorce
[1:29:28] him yeah not a bit of scripture for that
[1:29:31] the law don't mean anything to these
[1:29:33] nominal churches the law convert look
[1:29:36] the the law of the Lord is going to
[1:29:38] convert soul is that what it says the
[1:29:41] law right so you say you say you've had
[1:29:44] a change your Nature's we say that right
[1:29:48] well if you don't believe the law how
[1:29:50] you going to get a change right that's
[1:29:53] why brother R had to send us back to the
[1:29:54] original the law why we left the law the
[1:29:57] law meant nothing to us Gentile right
[1:29:59] everything was Grace right right now
[1:30:02] what they preach out there yeah sloppy
[1:30:04] Grace yeah that's what they doing
[1:30:06] message churches yeah oh you believe the
[1:30:10] message that's okay brother SEL you can
[1:30:12] wear high heels this long you can wear
[1:30:15] the splits up here that show your
[1:30:16] underneath clothes you believe the
[1:30:18] message that's okay see they won't
[1:30:20] preach the law anymore the law is
[1:30:23] nothing to people
[1:30:24] it's ridiculous the law is that's what's
[1:30:27] going to keep order in the church that's
[1:30:30] what's going to keep you bride
[1:30:33] materialy you know we got cut and pter
[1:30:36] in the message they cut out what they
[1:30:38] want they paste in what they
[1:30:42] want okay on that tape if you happen to
[1:30:46] get it or anything on that tape it
[1:30:48] should be that the seventh month after
[1:30:50] that brought in the Feast of trumpets
[1:30:53] exactly
[1:30:54] and look on the Feast of trumpets it was
[1:30:56] two trumpets that m not seven you agree
[1:31:00] it was two two silver trumpets what is
[1:31:03] silver type Redemption right what is
[1:31:06] those two people going to bring Israel
[1:31:08] to Redemption it's going to bring them
[1:31:10] to atonement does everybody understand
[1:31:12] that so when that Moses and that Elijah
[1:31:15] starts blowing their trumpet Israel is
[1:31:18] going to be gathered together all of
[1:31:20] Israel right it's going to be 144,000
[1:31:23] that other Bunch over there I think
[1:31:25] there's about 2 million in Israel now if
[1:31:27] you go look at their every once in a
[1:31:29] while go out there and look at their
[1:31:30] that's not much is it no not much at all
[1:31:33] you know Under The Trumpet of the angel
[1:31:35] now those angels there were Heavenly
[1:31:37] Angels yeah right you said it in the
[1:31:40] room to me and you're right I caught
[1:31:41] that in the last day there's a Heavenly
[1:31:43] Angel and there's a messenger Angel
[1:31:45] right when you're talking about those
[1:31:47] seven angels and the Seven that those
[1:31:49] are Heavenly Messengers do you agree
[1:31:51] right the only two Messengers that they
[1:31:53] get those two prophets exactly and
[1:31:55] they're going to blow those two trumpets
[1:31:57] so to Israel
[1:31:58] look Israel's going to be in the Feast
[1:32:02] of the trumpets it's going to be two so
[1:32:05] if you're worried about seven
[1:32:10] trumpets we what it is we just don't
[1:32:13] understand what he said right that's
[1:32:14] right right you agree with that we just
[1:32:16] don't get it that's right we don't
[1:32:19] Hebrews 4:2 what I says we don't mix it
[1:32:21] with Revelation right right we don't
[1:32:23] have faith in it thing we need to go
[1:32:25] back brother says listen to what he says
[1:32:28] same thought over there went the seventh
[1:32:29] month after the Feast of Passover feast
[1:32:31] of Pentecost then come the feast after
[1:32:33] the sheath was brought in way you see
[1:32:35] then remember the sheath turns into a
[1:32:37] loaf for bread after that time when the
[1:32:40] Sheep of one sheep then all goes into
[1:32:42] one Lo right oh it's a great teaching
[1:32:44] there you agree with that I didn't touch
[1:32:46] the edge of it and have to catch that on
[1:32:49] your tape right and remember he said it
[1:32:51] I said it a little while ago right what
[1:32:53] did he preaching on 07 this is ' 08 now
[1:32:56] he's gting something right this a 7
[1:32:59] months after that count off 7 months
[1:33:01] January February March April May June
[1:33:03] July this is where he preached right the
[1:33:05] Feast of the trumpets it'd be July 7
[1:33:08] months which represents the full seven
[1:33:10] Church agent exactly some Minister might
[1:33:13] pick that up and then You' have it you
[1:33:16] see there all right right what brother
[1:33:18] Ram's saying is he said seven trumpets
[1:33:20] in the Feast of trumpets it's not seven
[1:33:22] trumpets right Two Trumpets two do
[1:33:25] everybody got what I'm saying you'll
[1:33:27] clean it up after I'm gone there's the
[1:33:30] mistake people make they don't
[1:33:32] understand when brother brand was
[1:33:33] preaching the Feast of the trumpets he
[1:33:34] was preaching on two and he told them
[1:33:37] it's the atonement that they bring him
[1:33:39] does everybody agree with that so see
[1:33:41] what what's it trumpet it's exactly
[1:33:45] right it it is it's under the seven
[1:33:46] trumpet those two right that's exactly
[1:33:49] what it is but it's the two right that's
[1:33:52] what's going to bring about and I'm
[1:33:53] going to show you
[1:33:55] something I'm a typologist brother
[1:33:57] random said in
[1:34:02] uh adoption last book he said if you're
[1:34:04] not a typologist you won't understand
[1:34:06] your B exctly I didn't say it now some
[1:34:08] people go overboard we had people come
[1:34:10] to our church and said the USS Oklahoma
[1:34:12] sank at Pearl Harbor cuz they were in
[1:34:14] shallow water so our church was in
[1:34:15] shallow water that's taking your Ty a
[1:34:17] little
[1:34:18] far that's not a typologist that's just
[1:34:21] plain ignorance
[1:34:24] now that's what he said now you got to
[1:34:27] laugh at that don't you that's that was
[1:34:30] funny but anyway wow so any shut up see
[1:34:36] way so anyway where was I at now where
[1:34:39] was I going huh NOP typologist oh yeah
[1:34:45] okay so so I don't even know where I was
[1:34:47] going
[1:34:49] that oh I am a typologist I really so we
[1:34:53] understanding the fifth seal so these
[1:34:56] 144,000 are going to die under the
[1:34:58] Martyr seal right is that right but they
[1:35:02] got the Holy Ghost they got their white
[1:35:03] robes right so what what the fifth seal
[1:35:06] really starts breaking down for it shows
[1:35:08] us the different
[1:35:09] enemies right it it it shows you the
[1:35:12] bride it shows you the foolish origin it
[1:35:14] shows you the
[1:35:15] 144,000 it shows those are good to the
[1:35:17] bride right it what the fifth seal does
[1:35:20] is start breaking it down who's going to
[1:35:22] be over there right and like I always
[1:35:24] say five is the number of Grace right
[1:35:26] absolutely that's what it it's talking
[1:35:28] it's Grace Through the Ages is what it
[1:35:30] is right so brother Randon breaks down
[1:35:33] and puts us under the altar we
[1:35:35] understand when he went be and he talks
[1:35:36] about it when he went beyond the curtain
[1:35:37] of time they had white robes on right
[1:35:40] you agree right and when he said I want
[1:35:42] to see J he's a little higher so that
[1:35:44] shows you that they were under the altar
[1:35:46] of sacrifice of Jesus Christ under his
[1:35:48] altar brother BR then the F talks
[1:35:51] talking about Joseph he said he brought
[1:35:53] his brothers to his altar right he
[1:35:56] didn't take him to Pharaoh Pharaoh had
[1:35:58] his own altar exactly right now in the
[1:36:01] type we understand Pharaoh had many gods
[1:36:03] oh yeah you agree right Joseph didn't
[1:36:06] right Joseph never left here o Israel
[1:36:09] the Lord thy God is one right that's
[1:36:10] right right so they took those those
[1:36:13] brothers and they put them under the
[1:36:15] altar right Joseph's alter what brother
[1:36:18] random said look at how he says it and
[1:36:21] like I told you and he put him in order
[1:36:23] then he revealed himself under that
[1:36:25] altar right exactly that's what he's
[1:36:27] going to do in the fifth seal he's going
[1:36:28] to reveal himself Joseph to his Brethren
[1:36:32] y under the fifth seal EXA is everybody
[1:36:36] agree with that right so that's what all
[1:36:38] the brother BR starting to break it down
[1:36:40] for the The Sixth Seal I I'm not I'm
[1:36:43] just showing you a little bit of it to
[1:36:44] me the Sixth Seal there's where the
[1:36:46] gross eror is in it they try to they try
[1:36:49] to I you know they try to explain the
[1:36:52] seven trumpets right they're Heavenly
[1:36:54] Angels at Trumpet is that right right
[1:36:57] and these things that have come a lot of
[1:36:59] them have already happened on the earth
[1:37:00] yeah right they're looking for something
[1:37:02] to happen when it's already yeah exactly
[1:37:06] I agree six of look it says a third part
[1:37:08] of the men will be killed does everybody
[1:37:11] understand that 6 million Jews were
[1:37:12] killed there were 18 on the earth at
[1:37:13] that time is that a third part of them
[1:37:17] if that's the trumpets to them it makes
[1:37:19] sense right so a lot of what we're
[1:37:22] looking for to happen is already
[1:37:23] happened exactly and we just don't you
[1:37:26] know it talks about the moon would be
[1:37:27] this and that and the other right
[1:37:29] brother Brandon showed that on the seven
[1:37:31] Church ages with the lunar deal right
[1:37:33] right there's all sorts of these things
[1:37:35] that have already happened we're looking
[1:37:36] for them to happen right and people
[1:37:39] brother R said the only thing you ought
[1:37:40] to be looking up for is the rapture
[1:37:43] right right so we got people looking for
[1:37:44] brother brand to come back yeah
[1:37:48] really what in the world are you
[1:37:50] thinking brother I'm not looking for
[1:37:53] brother to come back if he comes back
[1:37:56] I'm going to say yay I'm going to get a
[1:37:58] body change if I see him walking around
[1:38:01] I see I'm going to say
[1:38:03] whoo right he ain't going to preach me a
[1:38:05] message to get it he's already preached
[1:38:07] the message right when he comes back
[1:38:10] I'll say all right let's go buddy that's
[1:38:13] right that's right right said that'll be
[1:38:16] we'll see him Y and look I told the
[1:38:18] church in in the first Rapture there
[1:38:21] what CF has seen them they at the off I
[1:38:23] don't believe they will this time no I
[1:38:25] don't believe an unbeliever will see
[1:38:26] them no no if it's a mystery coming
[1:38:29] right if they seen them is it it's a
[1:38:32] secret coming and there's one place
[1:38:34] brother B actually says what I'm telling
[1:38:36] you if it was a secret why would he make
[1:38:38] some unbeliever out there see
[1:38:40] him what you think God's just frivolous
[1:38:43] or what I got to go yeah so man if you
[1:38:47] see some of the ones that have went on
[1:38:49] walking in our M you you know what you
[1:38:51] better do you better say hea we going
[1:38:55] right right we're going right we are out
[1:38:58] of here is that right that's what it's
[1:39:00] about right and I really believe and if
[1:39:03] I don't see them it doesn't mean you'll
[1:39:04] necessarily see them you may not see one
[1:39:07] of them but if somebody in church go hey
[1:39:09] I've seen brother on over here you go y
[1:39:12] but you know your preaching is about

[1:40:05] somebody can come in if he's afraid of
[1:40:08] some preacher coming in and preaching
[1:40:09] something to fool all you he didn't do

[1:40:57] truth right so we thank God for the
[1:40:59] teachers for the pastors for the five
[1:41:02] Ministry in the church right
[1:41:04] right so I'm going quick how's that but
[1:41:08] I'm just kind of giving you I mean I'm
[1:41:09] just hitting the edge of what I gave in
[1:41:11] the church there is so much in those
[1:41:13] seals honestly I told him and he was
[1:41:16] telling I can stay on the fifth chapter
[1:41:18] of Revelation forever well sure it's the
[1:41:20] Plan of Redemption right amen it's
[1:41:23] Eternal does everybody understand I the
[1:41:25] same way I preach eight sermons I said I
[1:41:27] got to quit I said I have to quit I'm
[1:41:30] never going to get on the rest and I I
[1:41:33] asked her I said I got to get out of the
[1:41:35] fifth chapter I can stay here for months
[1:41:37] and months fifth seal he said I could
[1:41:40] preach months and months on you know
[1:41:42] what he said that's what he said so what
[1:41:47] I want you we know there's no doubt I
[1:41:50] know what the first seal is I know what
[1:41:52] the second seal is I know what the third
[1:41:54] I know the fourth I know the fifth I
[1:41:56] know the I know the seventh right
[1:41:58] seventh let me say this in close the
[1:41:59] seventh seals three parts right right he
[1:42:03] said the first part was the coming of
[1:42:04] the lord well that's Revelation 10 1-6
[1:42:08] right the second part I preached to you
[1:42:10] yesterday what did he preach yesterday
[1:42:11] the six seal which was what Redemption
[1:42:14] right right wasn't The Sixth Seal isn't
[1:42:16] that Redemption underneath that seal
[1:42:17] what did he preach to him Redemption he
[1:42:19] gave them the Plan of Redemption right
[1:42:22] and he said now the third one's unknown
[1:42:25] tongue right if I said Thunders would
[1:42:28] that mess you
[1:42:29] up if I said that would it am I changing
[1:42:31] what he said it's an unknown tongue he
[1:42:34] wasn't allowed to write it right that's
[1:42:37] the third part of that seven season it's
[1:42:40] the
[1:42:41] Mysteries the coming of the Lord what
[1:42:43] did it do it brought it to where our
[1:42:45] Prophet could preach the mystery of God
[1:42:47] right I say it this way at our church to
[1:42:49] bring better it's the mystery of the
[1:42:51] word right right right if I say that but
[1:42:53] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:42:57] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:43:00] mystery of God exactly the mystery of
[1:43:02] the word should be finished right that's
[1:43:05] why I can sit here and tell you today
[1:43:07] and preach a message I
[1:43:10] know and you can take amen that's
[1:43:13] right like I told the brother and I
[1:43:15] believe your birth is that seventh seal
[1:43:19] right your birth is revelation 10:7
[1:43:22] right
[1:43:23] it's those Mysteries that's called your
[1:43:26] name and that's getting you ready for a
[1:43:28] Rapture amen and the Very Mysteries that
[1:43:30] you have is going to call them all the
[1:43:32] way up Through the Ages amen yes sir
[1:43:34] they don't have a glorified body I tell
[1:43:36] the church this if you're going to meet
[1:43:37] him in the air and he's got a glorified
[1:43:39] body you're going to have to have the
[1:43:40] same body you agree with that amen right
[1:43:44] abely you're going to have to have a
[1:43:45] glorified body to go if you're going to
[1:43:48] go where he is right then you're going
[1:43:51] to have to have the same body he right
[1:43:54] cuz those in the sixth Dimension are in
[1:43:55] a theophany they don't eat there if I'm
[1:43:58] going to go to a marriage supper I got a
[1:44:00] different body right if I'm going to be
[1:44:01] eating and drinking there just like he
[1:44:03] did with right then I've got a different
[1:44:05] body I believe I'm getting a glorified
[1:44:07] body at the Rapture and I believe I
[1:44:10] could forever be with the Lord in that
[1:44:11] glorified body right is that right
[1:44:14] that's right CU he he's not a little
[1:44:16] higher in I got the same body he is
[1:44:19] there's not a dimension in the world can
[1:44:20] hold me in amen and I'm going for that
