[0:02] god bless you all once again
[0:05] praise the lord we thank god for this
[0:07] this opportunity again to have this um
[0:10] sunday school
[0:12] lesson
[0:13] and um see some of y'all came back for
[0:15] for part two
[0:18] so we we thank the lord thank the lord
[0:20] for that and um
[0:22] definitely hearing from some of you all
[0:23] that it's been a blessing so i thank god
[0:25] for that i know it's inspired some like
[0:28] brother taran said he's going to start
[0:29] charging for prayer requests now
[0:32] so um
[0:33] i can see he's been inspired that's
[0:36] exactly right
[0:37] so i could say i can't help
[0:40] the response that it produces in you
[0:43] or your other half or your better half
[0:45] or your worst half
[0:48] but uh by god's grace i'm trusting to be
[0:50] a blessing
[0:52] so this is financial jubilee part two
[0:54] and um as i said before you know that
[0:56] jubilee is just that trumpet it's a
[0:57] trumpet that's sounding saying you can
[0:59] go free
[1:00] and as our prophet said when the trumpet
[1:02] sounded every man could go free if he
[1:04] wanted to go free so it just becomes a
[1:07] choice
[1:08] and there's certain reasons why that
[1:10] it's difficult to go free just as if i
[1:12] was coming and we were in slavery and we
[1:14] had to get free it's going to require
[1:16] something something that we got to do on
[1:18] our part
[1:20] so we'll get right into it and
[1:22] i want to just play this quote i heard
[1:24] it yesterday and it just really touched
[1:26] my heart brothers you could move to the
[1:28] next slide and i'm just going to play it
[1:30] just so you can hear it
[1:32] go ahead brother you can move to the
[1:33] next one
[1:36] go down to slide 15.
[1:47] and go to the next yeah i'm gonna play
[1:48] this right here
[1:50] [Music]
[1:54] if our hearts condemn us
[1:56] we want complete deliverance
[1:59] we don't want to be halfway church we
[2:01] want to be a real church
[2:04] or no church at all
[2:07] we want to be real christians aren't no
[2:09] christians at all
[2:12] we want total deliverance
[2:16] from our habits of our sins
[2:19] from our people thanking from our evil
[2:21] doing
[2:22] from our negligence whatever we've done
[2:25] we want total deliverance
[2:27] [Music]
[2:29] so that when people come into this
[2:31] church to be prayed for there will be
[2:33] just this little group maybe not over a
[2:36] hundred or two sitting here but they
[2:37] have been completely in the hands of god
[2:40] [Music]
[2:42] when we pray then god will hear from
[2:44] heaven
[2:47] god wants somebody that he can hold in
[2:50] his hands
[2:52] somebody that he can say i got
[2:54] confidence in
[2:59] amen praise the lord so that's there we
[3:03] want to be real christians
[3:05] you know or no christians at all we want
[3:07] total deliverance from our habits from
[3:10] our evil our sins our evil thinkings our
[3:12] evil doing our negligence and so when i
[3:14] think of that you know it's it's really
[3:16] about being real christians in all areas
[3:18] of our life
[3:20] you know my dad always told me a story
[3:21] of a sister
[3:23] uh that backslid she was in the message
[3:25] and she blacks backslid and she had a
[3:27] nominal christian friend
[3:29] and uh the nominal christian friend was
[3:31] trying to argue that her being a nominal
[3:33] christian was a real christian
[3:36] and this backslidden message believer
[3:38] said let's look in the mirror we both
[3:39] have on pants we both got on makeup and
[3:43] i'm telling you i'm not a christian so
[3:46] if we look exactly the same
[3:48] that should give you some idea
[3:50] so it's the same thing within our
[3:52] financial lives you know if we look at
[3:54] our financial life it's exactly the same
[3:56] as someone else in the world we got debt
[3:58] we got problems can't figure it out
[4:01] then it's something going on
[4:03] and that's not saying you're not a
[4:04] christian but we shouldn't look like the
[4:06] world it shouldn't be the exact same
[4:08] you know we talked about the government
[4:10] last time and how bad that is and but if
[4:12] we're no different then we're we're
[4:15] caught up we're tied and that's what
[4:16] financial jubilee is all about it's like
[4:18] we can be free by the grace of almighty
[4:20] god
[4:22] through the next slide we know as i
[4:23] brought up this quote last time a
[4:24] prophet said clean up your lives pay
[4:26] your debts oh no man
[4:28] get all things off your hands get
[4:30] everything right make ready get ready
[4:32] remember in the name of the lord
[4:34] something is fixing to happen
[4:36] so we we certainly have no excuse we
[4:38] look in the word it's saying hey oh
[4:39] nobody we have our prophet that's saying
[4:42] that now we need god's grace to be able
[4:44] to walk in this
[4:46] you know it's certainly not um you know
[4:49] a sunday school lesson certainly i know
[4:50] it can be inspiring especially when
[4:52] talking about money or it can move you
[4:53] in some way
[4:55] but it's really about doing it's about
[4:57] actually going in and doing something
[4:59] different
[5:01] we go to the next
[5:03] we talked about some symptoms
[5:06] and we'll briefly just run through some
[5:07] of these again this is just if you went
[5:09] to the doctor and they was trying to
[5:10] give you an idea of something wrong
[5:12] these are some things if you're facing
[5:14] some of the things in your life then
[5:15] it's a good indication that there'll be
[5:17] some bit some type of financial bondage
[5:19] so if you're always worried about money
[5:21] it's just it's not enough you confused
[5:23] things are not ironed out
[5:26] you know that's an issue
[5:28] bail out you know you're always looking
[5:29] for the next one trying to find the next
[5:31] thing that's going to help clean up your
[5:33] situation immediately you know you're
[5:35] going to get that next deal or if you
[5:37] sell this many products and you get 10
[5:39] other people to sell these products
[5:40] you're going to be out of all your
[5:41] problems
[5:43] cover up you know this is when you're
[5:44] broke but you're still looking like
[5:46] everything's okay
[5:48] greed you think you deserve it it should
[5:50] be me resentment
[5:52] because you see others getting things
[5:54] and you're like man you know how do they
[5:55] do that indulgence trying to find things
[5:58] to make you happy as i mentioned i had a
[6:00] good one good one with that when i
[6:01] started losing all kind of money i was
[6:03] just getting ready to go buy me a
[6:04] vehicle on loan i was going to make my
[6:06] own self happy
[6:08] no plan you don't know what happened you
[6:10] know you don't know what happened at the
[6:11] end of the month others might know but
[6:13] you'd seem not to know
[6:16] also you're the middle man everything
[6:18] that comes in goes out
[6:20] help wanted you want to help but you
[6:22] just don't got it to help i always said
[6:24] this is like the broke good samaritan
[6:26] and then we got the debt trap this is
[6:28] when you just don't have it you can't
[6:29] pay your bills you got debt collectors
[6:31] calling you something is going on
[6:35] all right we're going to go talk about
[6:36] principles the only way out of this is
[6:38] god's principles and standards so we're
[6:40] going to go a little bit deeper on some
[6:42] of these principles principle number one
[6:45] god owns it all i talked about is the 10
[6:48] we pay our tithes but it's also the 90
[6:51] he just gave you that piece to manage so
[6:53] we don't waste our money we're actually
[6:55] wasting his money
[6:57] if you go on brother to the next he owns
[7:00] it so the earth is the lord's and the
[7:02] fullness thereof the world and they that
[7:05] dwell therein
[7:06] the silver is mine and the gold is mine
[7:10] saith the lord of hosts he's telling us
[7:12] he owns it all
[7:14] so you can rest he's giving you what he
[7:16] knows you can handle and what you can
[7:18] handle he's not giving to you he owns it
[7:21] all in haggai just looking at that
[7:23] scripture and going back over it they
[7:25] were building that temple
[7:27] and the prophet haggai was telling them
[7:29] zerobowl he was like be strong
[7:32] he was telling all the people
[7:34] he says god said i'm with you
[7:36] saith the lord
[7:38] and work
[7:40] and work
[7:41] he said he want them to work for i am
[7:43] with you saith the lord of hosts
[7:46] so he said i own all the silver i got it
[7:48] all but you got to work
[7:51] and that's the same thing he's telling
[7:52] us he have he has unlimited resources
[7:56] but he wants us to put in the work
[7:58] because it's something in the work that
[8:00] you get when you do that work but he
[8:03] owns it all the next
[8:08] he controls it
[8:09] look at these scriptures both riches and
[8:12] honor come of thee and thou reigneth
[8:14] over all and in thy hand is power and
[8:17] might and in thy hand it is to make
[8:20] great and to give strength unto all
[8:24] first samuel 2 7 it says the lord maketh
[8:27] poor and maketh rich he bringeth low and
[8:31] lifteth up
[8:33] he controls it he owns it he controls it
[8:37] the
[8:38] next he provides it
[8:41] but my god shall supply all your need
[8:44] according to his riches in glory by
[8:46] christ jesus philippians 4 19
[8:50] deuteronomy says but thou shalt remember
[8:52] the lord thy god for it is he that
[8:54] giveth the power to get wealth
[8:58] he owns it he controls it he provides it
[9:02] that should give you some peace
[9:04] that you can't
[9:06] and i like to tell this to my son you
[9:08] can't out
[9:09] earn god i hope you understand what that
[9:12] means you can't manipulate enough or i'm
[9:15] going to work on sundays i'm going to do
[9:17] whatever it takes to get ahead
[9:19] he's telling you he owns it he controls
[9:22] it he provides it
[9:23] and that's what the world has set us up
[9:25] to think that there is a shortcut there
[9:26] is some method that you're gonna get
[9:28] ahead
[9:30] but there is none because he owns it he
[9:32] controls it he provides it now he's
[9:34] giving trump the money for a reason
[9:36] he's doing that
[9:38] he's given the allah mosque who
[9:42] owns the car the tesla my son knows all
[9:45] about that
[9:46] god has given that to him for a reason
[9:49] and he knows that man is going to follow
[9:52] exactly what god allows to happen with
[9:55] that money
[9:57] but us as christians god knows how much
[9:59] we can handle how much we can't
[10:02] he's telling us through his word so
[10:04] that's principle number one he owns it
[10:06] all go to the next
[10:11] our prophet says anything that you have
[10:13] need of
[10:14] on this life's journey god will supply
[10:17] it if you have need of it he promised to
[10:20] supply
[10:21] your needs not your wants your needs and
[10:24] he's god and he can give he can only get
[10:29] it to you as you believe him
[10:31] so as we believe him he's already made
[10:33] the promise that he's going to supply
[10:34] all that we need all that we need and
[10:37] not all that we want but all that we
[10:39] need he knows so if you don't have it
[10:43] yet it's a reason
[10:45] but he's promised to give you all that
[10:47] you need and i have seen this in my
[10:49] life's journey i have seen this god
[10:51] provide i remember getting laid off on
[10:53] my job and
[10:55] i would just go back to philippians and
[10:56] read that scripture over and over god is
[10:59] going to supply all my need and
[11:00] certainly the lord would open up another
[11:02] job opportunity by his grace
[11:05] so he provides
[11:07] go to the next
[11:10] so if he
[11:12] controls he owns he provides then what's
[11:15] our part
[11:16] we are the managers that 90 that we have
[11:20] we are the managers of that and we need
[11:22] to manage his resources diligently
[11:26] get
[11:26] organized the scripture says he becometh
[11:29] poor that dealeth with a slack hand but
[11:31] the hand of the diligent maketh rich
[11:35] ma he owns it controls it and provides
[11:38] it but we need to manage it now diligent
[11:40] what does that mean that means careful
[11:43] persistent work
[11:44] attention
[11:46] it's like you're legally
[11:48] expected to act so you think about a
[11:51] contract that's what the word diligent
[11:52] if you look that up that's what it's
[11:54] dealing with like you are legally
[11:56] expected to act as a party of a contract
[12:00] that's what he's looking at
[12:03] slack
[12:04] that we know what that means that means
[12:06] careless sloppy and yes sometimes a
[12:09] little bit deceitful
[12:11] can be
[12:12] it's like if i loaned you my car and you
[12:14] just left the doors open the rain coming
[12:16] through it's you know you let animals
[12:18] walk in insects it's like you don't care
[12:21] you left it somewhere it's like i don't
[12:23] know where it is i'll deal with it later
[12:26] my and you came back and said can i
[12:28] borrow it a second time
[12:30] we would have some conversations put it
[12:32] that way
[12:34] well it's the same thing this thing that
[12:35] money that we have for our entire life
[12:38] from the youngest you can probably
[12:39] remember to the oldest
[12:41] you have to deal with this thing money
[12:44] but look how we treat it we don't think
[12:46] it's god's
[12:47] we just kind of slack i'm doing this
[12:49] i'll figure it out one day
[12:51] you know all these things i've met
[12:54] couples and their families and myself
[12:56] going through it you know coming out of
[12:58] college i thought i had again figured
[12:59] all out and i was just everything that
[13:01] came in was going out everything that's
[13:04] how i like okay i got the money i can do
[13:06] it that's what i thought you know if i
[13:08] can make this payment then i can borrow
[13:11] 16 years old i was getting my first loan
[13:13] i think it was as jc penney's for a vcr
[13:16] i went in there and i was like they said
[13:18] well you can sign up and you get
[13:19] yourself a vcr
[13:21] like
[13:23] can i
[13:24] okay i signed it walked out with a vcr i
[13:27] think it was 275
[13:29] for a vcr
[13:31] but it had a remote control and i was
[13:32] like yes
[13:34] my goodness then i had a girlfriend on
[13:36] top of that who is now my wife so that
[13:39] credit card that christmas man i was
[13:41] like she's gonna be blessed
[13:43] so i blessed her with some christmas
[13:46] gifts
[13:46] and i got myself some debt
[13:48] so we would start out on the right track
[13:50] as you can see
[13:51] [Laughter]
[13:53] so it says the hands of the diligent as
[13:56] the scripture says shall bear rule but
[13:58] the slothful shall be under tribute
[14:00] scripture says it's required for a
[14:02] steward that a man be found faithful so
[14:04] that's faithful with the hundred percent
[14:06] that god has blessed you with faithful
[14:08] regardless of how much it is if it's a
[14:10] little if it's a lot you're faithful
[14:12] with that
[14:14] also faithful in the little things money
[14:16] is a little thing but the faithfulness
[14:18] of it is the big part that's what god is
[14:20] looking at
[14:22] faithful because it's someone else's
[14:24] it's god that he's given to you he's
[14:26] loaning that to for you to manage so
[14:28] you're being faithful with what he's
[14:29] given to you
[14:31] and the greatest thing about
[14:32] faithfulness that i've seen
[14:34] faithfulness it unlocks something
[14:36] and that it unlocks contentment which
[14:39] we'll talk a little bit about that
[14:42] so again you are the manager god owns it
[14:44] he controls it he provides it but you
[14:46] need to manage what god has given to you
[14:49] let's go to the next
[14:52] a prophet said and therefore i know as a
[14:55] steward of his money i'm going to have
[14:57] to answer for it at the day of judgment
[14:59] and that's not just to the prophet
[15:00] that's a christian we're stewards of his
[15:04] money of his money notice how he says
[15:07] that it's of his money
[15:10] wow
[15:11] that's nothing but the truth help us
[15:14] let's go to the next
[15:17] principle three and four this is dealing
[15:19] with spending
[15:21] so you spend his money so money is time
[15:24] you're purchasing stuff with your time
[15:26] you're working an hour you know your pay
[15:28] if you waste that money you've just
[15:30] wasted that time that god has given you
[15:31] so don't trade any of your time on earth
[15:35] for useless stuff
[15:37] act as we tell our children act your age
[15:40] well throughout your life journey at
[15:42] your wage act how much you have simply
[15:46] don't spend more than you earn wait save
[15:49] and stay creative and pray
[15:52] now you notice i'm bringing out that
[15:53] word stay creative because acting your
[15:56] wage it does something when you hold you
[15:59] wait you pray
[16:01] oh you've given god an opportunity
[16:03] that's what he's looking for you've
[16:04] given him an opportunity you're not
[16:06] taking the world's way and this is where
[16:08] it gets hard because we live in a world
[16:10] where it's like you don't need to wait
[16:12] on anything you don't need to wait why
[16:15] are you waiting when i can sign you up
[16:17] and you can get this
[16:18] interest loan and you're good on your
[16:20] way that's what it's all about buy now
[16:22] pay later
[16:24] anyway and they're coming up with every
[16:25] method in the book to make sure you can
[16:28] get it right now
[16:29] don't wait
[16:31] don't wait don't wait on that other tool
[16:33] don't wait on this get it now you need
[16:35] it now
[16:36] and we think we're gonna get ahead if we
[16:38] take this route when he already says he
[16:41] owns it he provides it he controls it
[16:47] so what that comes down to
[16:49] we have to stop spending money that we
[16:51] don't have it's that simple you have to
[16:53] stop
[16:55] god has given you to manage what you can
[16:56] manage in this season
[16:58] you know i remember just starting out in
[17:00] our marriage and man we were buying all
[17:02] this new furniture and stuff like that
[17:03] before we had kids and all that quickly
[17:05] when they came along you realize why i
[17:07] needed to wait because everything that
[17:09] we had started getting messed up real
[17:11] quick
[17:12] it was a perfect time for some
[17:13] second-hand furniture if we would have
[17:15] known
[17:16] so you see how god is just lining it up
[17:18] we didn't need a new vehicle with all
[17:20] the food crumbs and everything being
[17:21] stuck into everything no we didn't need
[17:23] that but we didn't know it at the time
[17:25] because the world was saying get it now
[17:27] you need this new brand new minivan
[17:29] that's what you need
[17:31] but my thank god for his lessons we
[17:33] start learning
[17:35] god has given you what you can manage in
[17:37] the season he's trying to tell you what
[17:39] you can handle
[17:40] it's less stress is less decisions if
[17:43] you stick with what god has given you
[17:44] when he's ready for you to have more you
[17:46] will have more because he knows you can
[17:47] manage it he will know it's the right
[17:49] season for you at that time
[17:52] by his grace a lot of the farmers you
[17:54] know what caused a lot of their problems
[17:56] they start coming out with all this new
[17:57] equipment
[17:59] get this new equipment that's going to
[18:00] help you take it to the next level
[18:02] that's going to do this and before you
[18:04] know it these farmers were upside down
[18:07] with these fancy huge equipment trying
[18:10] to take it to the next level and never
[18:12] ever really got ahead but that's how the
[18:14] enemy does
[18:15] now there's nothing wrong with that new
[18:17] equipment out of that tool or whatever
[18:19] it is that you desire but you gotta wait
[18:22] until god provides it to you
[18:24] he's trying to get it to you but he's
[18:26] trying to show you how he's able to
[18:28] provide
[18:30] again the world is very complicated he's
[18:33] got credit you got debit cards things
[18:35] are out of control
[18:36] your husband your wife all each one
[18:40] that's why i said i'm not responsible
[18:41] for their reaction
[18:43] to what they're learning this this
[18:44] morning
[18:45] but each one we all have different
[18:47] personalities the way we handle money
[18:49] some are spenders some are savers you
[18:51] got these different personalities but
[18:53] i'll tell you no matter what if you're
[18:54] out of control with it then you have to
[18:56] do something differently
[18:58] you have to change how you're doing it
[19:01] one thing we started doing when god
[19:03] started opening up and we started
[19:04] realizing oh my god i can't keep up with
[19:06] all this stuff we went down to cash
[19:08] on certain things like hey we give it to
[19:11] the bank yeah it was slow we had to slow
[19:13] down we couldn't just run to the store
[19:14] we went to the bank we started getting
[19:16] cash all right okay this is how much
[19:18] we're gonna have for groceries we put
[19:20] that in an envelope yes we could use
[19:21] credit and debit cards and all that but
[19:23] no let's use the cash and my wife would
[19:26] have to go into that store and look in
[19:27] that envelope and oh my god that's the
[19:29] last thing you want to do is start
[19:30] telling them we're going to take that
[19:32] off especially when you got somebody
[19:33] behind you like
[19:36] but hey when you're looking at freedom
[19:38] you have to do what you have to do
[19:41] but guess what it start helping us back
[19:43] up start slowing things down do i really
[19:46] need this
[19:47] and man we start getting our focus oh my
[19:51] after we lost all that money and we
[19:52] start executing in this way it changed
[19:54] our life man i tell my wife today we
[19:57] have never been closer than when we were
[19:59] going through this journey after we lost
[20:02] all that money and we got focused we
[20:03] didn't go for a bailout we could have
[20:05] went for a bailout i could say hey it's
[20:07] in the equity loan forget it it'll be
[20:09] another 20 years before it paid off no
[20:10] big deal but god said no
[20:13] get it done
[20:14] there is a way because i start
[20:16] questioning why i'm paying my debts i'm
[20:18] paying my tithes i am doing everything i
[20:21] know to do i wasn't a big spender but
[20:23] i'm doing everything i know to do so
[20:25] lord how did this happen to me and god
[20:27] was simply saying i have a way i have
[20:30] freedom for you if you want it and i
[20:33] have seen that i have proved it out by
[20:35] his grace
[20:37] the scripture says the wise man saves
[20:38] for the future but the foolish man
[20:40] spends whatever he got
[20:42] that's where i was everything came in
[20:44] man we started making a little bit more
[20:46] money i told you about the 40-year loan
[20:48] it was like yes 40 years that's fine our
[20:51] payment is going to be a little bit
[20:52] lower so we can get some more stuff
[20:55] in that house for 40 40 years my god
[20:58] 40 years
[21:00] but that's i thought that was the way i
[21:02] thought that's what you do
[21:04] setting myself up for this world that's
[21:06] what all my education all my knowledge
[21:08] all that got me
[21:09] more loans leverage this leverage that
[21:12] don't use your own money do this do that
[21:15] that's all
[21:16] the world's lies to trap you
[21:19] god has such a wonderful way for his
[21:21] children praise god
[21:23] amen let's go to the next
[21:28] our prophet says someday i'm going to
[21:29] have to answer for every penny of money
[21:31] that's been given to me every penny oh
[21:35] god is a master accountant believe me he
[21:38] knows every dime he's passed your way
[21:40] and he's going to hold us accountable to
[21:42] what we've done with that now he wants
[21:44] to bless his children there's no doubt
[21:46] because he owns it all
[21:48] but he wants us to be a steward of that
[21:50] and he wants to prove us not just these
[21:52] natural blessings and i hope you can see
[21:54] between the lines it's spiritual
[21:58] it applies to everything he's trying to
[22:00] get to us it's character that's what
[22:02] he's trying to get to us but he gives us
[22:05] this little thing he allowed this
[22:06] economy to be set up on money for a
[22:08] reason it didn't have to be
[22:11] we could be on the border system or
[22:12] something like that you got to trade
[22:14] something you know you got some cows you
[22:15] could trade that but he allowed it to be
[22:17] money for us
[22:19] because it can apply to anybody the kids
[22:21] want money the older one the younger
[22:23] everybody wants money what my parents
[22:24] don't leave to me when they leave what
[22:26] they're not gonna leave to me when i
[22:27] leave etc etc
[22:29] so it's something we deal with god
[22:31] allowed that but every penny that goes
[22:33] out he knows
[22:35] and he's giving it to us for a reason
[22:37] and we're gonna have to answer for it
[22:39] there is a reason why it's so difficult
[22:42] especially in our time and it's one word
[22:44] that's leaving our society it's leaving
[22:46] this world it's going out and that word
[22:47] is no
[22:48] that's a very hard word i guarantee you
[22:51] if you ask me for something i said no
[22:53] you're gonna have a little problem
[22:54] you're gonna pause for a minute like
[22:56] what no
[22:57] don't tell your kids that they're gonna
[22:59] do the same thing like no that that
[23:01] no that's it's not no
[23:03] it's what do i need to do
[23:05] you know if you want to go buy a car and
[23:07] i said well no then we're just not going
[23:08] you don't know what you mean no i can
[23:10] get a co-sign i can get somebody i can
[23:12] get this let me tell you how i can do it
[23:15] but that simple word no and our prophet
[23:17] said the world is full of it
[23:18] advertisements and television and radio
[23:21] and newspapers and the american people
[23:24] fall for such as that
[23:26] that's the american people we shouldn't
[23:28] be there we should be christians
[23:30] christians by his grace and be able to
[23:33] wait on our lord that's why he says so
[23:35] much wait on the lord wait on the lord
[23:38] go to the next
[23:40] we can say no to debt say no to that the
[23:44] world tells you
[23:46] what we deserve we should have it but as
[23:48] a christians we don't deserve debt
[23:50] oh my we used to go to when we were
[23:52] young and we didn't have that much you
[23:53] know coming in we would go on these um
[23:55] what do they call it it's time share and
[23:58] you could go on a free trip and get a
[24:00] time share presentation oh my lord in
[24:02] like we got a free trip we got a meal
[24:04] i'm pretty sure we can
[24:06] keep them away but they get in they
[24:08] start telling you deserve it you look at
[24:10] your wife like don't you want to give
[24:12] her the best vacation in the world oh
[24:15] don't you want to do that and we thought
[24:16] we were smart we were like no we don't
[24:18] want it and they take us to the next
[24:19] level and the next level we got to a
[24:21] third level of a presentation and the
[24:23] man was like you're so smart john you
[24:27] all that other stuff is just for those
[24:28] that are quick but you are a thinker
[24:30] you're wise and let me show you what we
[24:33] got for these special people we got this
[24:36] kind of deal and guess what you can try
[24:38] it out and do all this and by the time
[24:41] we walked out i had myself a signed up
[24:43] contract
[24:44] my god
[24:46] my lord
[24:48] but praise the lord for his grace we had
[24:49] a three-day turn around so i didn't have
[24:51] to be in his face so i called him i said
[24:52] no we don't want it at least i'm on the
[24:54] phone
[24:55] but i've realized how quick you could be
[24:57] convinced
[24:59] your wife's sitting there and she's like
[25:00] yeah do i do you think i deserve it
[25:04] well
[25:05] see you get yourself trapped
[25:07] but the bible says oh no man anything
[25:09] but to love one another for he that
[25:10] loveth another has fulfilled the law
[25:13] the rich ruleth over the poor and the
[25:15] borrower is servant slave to the lender
[25:18] oh the blessings of the lord is make it
[25:19] rich and he added no sorrow with it
[25:22] oh my borrowing is slavery my friends
[25:24] believe me you loaned someone some money
[25:26] you see them walk in with a new outfit
[25:28] and they haven't paid you back you feel
[25:30] differently you're like yeah i like that
[25:31] outfit mm-hmm
[25:33] what about that money i gave you that's
[25:35] what you're thinking in your heart like
[25:36] yeah that's real nice but it'd be real
[25:38] nice if you didn't owe me some money
[25:40] i've been there been been many times and
[25:42] if you haven't been there maybe you the
[25:44] one that they looking at your outfit
[25:48] so
[25:49] stop taking on more debt you're really
[25:51] robbing yourself again when i had that
[25:54] 40-year loan once i started sitting down
[25:56] and taking time and not listening to the
[25:58] world i realized that i would be paying
[25:59] out twice as much for that house if i
[26:01] took 40 years to pay that off you borrow
[26:04] a car you get a car let's say you get a
[26:05] six-year car no 20 000 you're going to
[26:08] be paying back about 31 000
[26:11] so forget the nonsense and say how much
[26:13] i'm really going to be paying on this
[26:14] car do you want to pay 31 000 for that
[26:17] car do you
[26:18] forget what they're telling 20 000 just
[26:20] interest rate well how much am i gonna
[26:22] really be paying because that's what
[26:23] you're about to put in 31 000 for a 20
[26:26] 000 car
[26:28] that's how much you're going to pay
[26:29] and no room for god to act on that
[26:32] because god specializes in these things
[26:34] if we follow his way
[26:37] 31 000 so you can see how the prophet
[26:39] said clean up your lives pay your debts
[26:41] how do you handle this i'm a little
[26:43] practical write down the smallest to the
[26:46] largest debt that you owe if you're
[26:48] responsible for the money in your home
[26:51] write it down it doesn't be anything
[26:52] fancy take a napkin a plate anything a
[26:54] piece of paper write it down what's the
[26:57] debts that i owe
[26:58] what do i owe anyone if you got family
[27:01] members you borrowed from anybody write
[27:02] those things down
[27:04] and then make it a family event like
[27:05] honey let me just show you a little bit
[27:07] of something so just in case you didn't
[27:09] know
[27:10] this is what we owe everybody
[27:14] and use that to help you slow down and
[27:16] then focus on that smallest one and say
[27:17] what can we do to hit this thing can we
[27:20] sell something do we really need this
[27:22] hey let's sell it let's put the money
[27:23] towards that
[27:26] that's what you do that's what we
[27:27] started doing christmas gifts anything
[27:28] we got it was like we gonna sell
[27:30] whatever we got
[27:32] sell it new furniture we had sell it
[27:33] sell it we got to pay back this debt
[27:36] that we're in and that's what we started
[27:37] doing so write it down don't run from
[27:40] creditors if you owe somebody money you
[27:41] don't have to run away from your mom
[27:43] your aunt and whoever you borrowed money
[27:44] from say you know what
[27:46] i know it's been a lot going on i know i
[27:49] owe you some money i'm gonna start
[27:51] i'm gonna start paying this off
[27:55] real quick we're running out of time
[27:57] next we'll run through some principles
[27:59] really quick
[28:00] saving and investing of course this is
[28:03] coming up
[28:05] click the next
[28:06] it says go to the ant thou sluggard
[28:08] consider her ways and be wise which have
[28:10] no guide overseer or ruler provided her
[28:13] meat in the summer and gathereth her
[28:14] gathereth her food in the harvest you
[28:17] can just see those pictures that's
[28:18] that's really the cycle of life you
[28:20] start off young and before you know it
[28:22] before you know it
[28:24] you're you're you're older my dad i said
[28:27] was an extremely hard worker at brother
[28:29] ray's funeral he was just talking my he
[28:31] said i wish i had the strength that i
[28:32] used to have as a young man i never
[28:34] heard my dad talk like that but
[28:35] something moved him in that
[28:37] and certainly he's not the same young
[28:39] man that he was
[28:40] i'm not the same person i was when i was
[28:42] 20 in 30. and i'm in my 40s i'm just not
[28:45] the same i want to do the same but it's
[28:48] not the same
[28:50] and i'm still working i'm in the season
[28:51] of life where i'm working this is a
[28:53] season of my work years it's not in the
[28:56] season of us just having kids i got all
[28:58] teenagers in that range this is the
[28:59] season of me working as a father like
[29:02] solid you look up dad you'll see me
[29:04] that's me it's like there it is you're
[29:06] working you're trying to manage kids
[29:08] you're trying to manage family you're
[29:09] trying to manage the natural the
[29:10] spiritual all those things you're trying
[29:12] to do that's the season of life i am but
[29:14] i know this is not the remaining season
[29:15] of my life it's going to change next i'm
[29:17] going to be empty nesters next we're
[29:19] going to keep going up
[29:20] that's what it's going to be and we can
[29:22] see the whole range within this church
[29:24] you can see it
[29:25] so we have to do certain things when
[29:26] we're younger like setting aside a
[29:28] little something so when i'm older
[29:32] that's what we have to do so
[29:34] wherever you are make sure you have an
[29:36] emergency fund if you're young a
[29:38] teenager make sure you have like as you
[29:39] work and start sending a little money
[29:40] 500 for an emergency fund have that set
[29:43] aside if you're a little bit older have
[29:44] a thousand
[29:45] if you're a little bit older have
[29:47] several months of your full expenses set
[29:49] aside you should know and can take a
[29:52] little time to write down all of the
[29:54] expenses i usually have to pay in a
[29:55] month you may have about three thousand
[29:58] four thousand whatever it is maybe for
[29:59] you but you should know something you
[30:01] can go to to say yep it just take me
[30:02] probably about three thousand dollars a
[30:04] month and then start setting that aside
[30:06] have three to six months of that set
[30:08] aside just in case something happens
[30:10] then you're prepared
[30:14] next
[30:17] we won't read this whole thing but it
[30:19] says if jesus is coming in the morning
[30:20] preached today like like it was going to
[30:22] be 10 years from today but live like
[30:24] it's going to be this hour don't get all
[30:27] scrupled up he says that's what i'm
[30:28] trying to warn you of just don't be odd
[30:30] for cue you don't change nothing but if
[30:32] you're doing something wrong or doing
[30:33] evil repent
[30:34] basically he's saying hey go keep
[30:36] planting your potatoes keep planting
[30:38] your prepaid even if you know god is
[30:39] coming this can trip us up many times
[30:41] like oh i'm going to spend everything
[30:42] because god's going to come well make
[30:44] sure you're not in debt
[30:46] because you're going to leave that to
[30:47] somebody but don't spend everything you
[30:49] have because emergencies they do come up
[30:51] and we need to be prepared for whatever
[30:53] seasons are coming let's go to the next
[30:58] giving is the best investment keep going
[31:00] brother
[31:02] what's enough of course as you keep
[31:03] managing god you're gonna get something
[31:06] god is gonna put a lot in your hands to
[31:07] manage and then you're gonna move to the
[31:09] questions of lord what's enough
[31:11] enough is enough
[31:13] more than enough i don't need all of
[31:15] this i don't need all of that okay i can
[31:17] start giving out some of this stuff
[31:20] because we know the scripture says is
[31:21] more blessed to give than to receive
[31:23] keep going
[31:27] the last be content keep going
[31:30] are you contend that's the question and
[31:32] how do you get contentment how do you
[31:33] get it keep going
[31:36] well to get contentment you must learn
[31:38] it that's the bottom line that's why i
[31:40] said i love presenting this but it's
[31:42] something i can't give you i can't give
[31:43] you contentment contentment is learned
[31:46] and you must learn it
[31:47] paul says not that i speak in respect of
[31:49] one for i've learned in whatever state i
[31:51] am therewith to be content
[31:53] keep going
[31:58] and the last talking about a faithful
[32:00] steward this is what god is trying to
[32:01] get to us keep clicking brother
[32:05] a faithful steward owes blessings
[32:08] a faithful man should abound with
[32:09] blessings but he that maketh haste to be
[32:11] rich shall not be innocent he wants to
[32:14] give us those real blessings great gain
[32:17] godliness with contentment is great gain
[32:19] some of those great gains are character
[32:21] self-control hard work self-denial
[32:24] patience diligent frugality gratefulness
[32:26] all those things that we need in our
[32:28] spiritual life as well but something
[32:30] that you can apply naturally and just
[32:33] take it on to your spiritual my and it
[32:36] will produce it that's what it does and
[32:39] certainly more responsibilities i have
[32:41] seen that god will give you more but
[32:43] he's not just going to give it to you
[32:44] he's going to give it to you to where
[32:46] when you see more it just becomes oh
[32:48] lord you're giving me more
[32:49] responsibilities that's what you're
[32:50] doing lord i see it it's not something
[32:52] that's frivolous or just you giving me
[32:54] this new car just have a new car a new
[32:56] house just that lord you're giving me
[32:58] more responsibilities thank you lord but
[33:00] i know it's a part i have to play i have
[33:02] to manage what you've given me
[33:04] so
[33:05] stop spending
[33:06] out of control stop adding more debt
[33:09] write down your debts do save for an
[33:12] emergency fund
[33:13] promise you god is not in the
[33:14] subtracting business he just wants to
[33:16] add to our lives and bless us that we
[33:19] can be a faithful steward and have
[33:21] something that we can relate to all
[33:23] these spiritual things that we're being
[33:24] taught
[33:26] in his word through our prophet at this
[33:28] church we've been taught these natural
[33:30] and spiritual things so we can have that
[33:33] character that god will be pleased with
[33:36] so god bless you
[33:37] appreciate all of you and i pray god
[33:39] bless you as you start
[33:41] continue
[33:42] doing on this journey god bless you
[33:46] [Applause]
[33:56] you
