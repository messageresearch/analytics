Wednesday so remember each one of these announcements brother Tony's sister Esther going on a vacation tongue to Alaska so remember them and there are tours and ice they do so you can go ahead and be seated for a minute and let brother Bob cover a little something to it that you're planning on doing okay thanks yeah I don't think this would take too long but I just wanted to kind of now say so on a lot of our hearts lately to kind of do something for the young people and kind of get a little something started and maybe have a little bit more targeted Bible study for them to kind of you know focusing directly on some of their needs and different things so what we're planning to do is is the Bible study Sunday or Saturday is to kind of get the young people together and and have a little little Bible study with them and and have maybe have some little activities and different kind of things that we're still trying to work out everything is going to come together but we want to we want to have the young people get together on the Bible study Saturday at 3:30 in the afternoon to be there and we'll have you know food and drinks and different kind of things like that and we're just planning to have a good time in the Lord and talk directly to the young people and and just have a good little time of fellowship and fun like that so thank brother waiting brother Dale for you no backing us up with this and and making it available for us to be able to do something like this and just lower will and this will be just something that will really benefit and bless all the young people and and even the adults so and you know we're we're plan to to send out even more details through emails so you kind of have that in your email inbox and and also it'll be on the you know the screens downstairs so we'll make sure we do everything we can to make sure everybody has all the information that they need to be where they need to be at what time and that kind of thing so just go ahead Stan be what we're just kind of getting into something and then we'll have to work it out as we go but trying to get something for the children young people in things and if you call what he's doing it'll be like we started six o'clock you know on our Bible study on that Saturday but it will start like 3:30 and we're gonna this is going to be a movable time because we're going to see how it works starting at 3:30 and then start and let the kids have their time and all like that then the adults can come in and be ready by 6:00 o'clock and that way the kids can just do go through their doings and the times and and Bible studies and things on up to that five six o'clock and then we'll just flow right on into the Bible study you know and get all of that together as one as we finish it up in that way it'll be you know it'd be beneficial to everybody somebody will be handling the each thing and taking care of it they got to get all that set so they can make it all - but it'll start this coming Saturday not not let's see I'll be the next Saturday right cause we got got one extra one in there this time all right so it'll be like the 8th 7th or 8th it'll just kind of start and that's what I said we're gonna try to get it set up and then get it to working and then we will invite other churches to allow their youth to come if they want to you know and and participate but it'll be just left up to time and what we're doing and how much to get done but the brothers is they'll do that I just talking a little bit while the rest of us coming in and getting everybody up okay on my own now okay everybody it would be cleared now so we'll get that you know and we'll start that and the children it'll be like age groups set aside to work that you know they can work within their age group go with how something for the little ones and then something for the next and something for the next or something ever happen and it'll work out for the glory of the Lord okay and we'll get these things underway okay if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turning to Romans five and then we'll go to Ephesians four Romans five Ephesians four remember all of these that are sick among us right the Lord would bless each one because that's something that we can all do together is get a burden on our heart for the sick among us now as I've always said it's not trying to call down fire now we don't believe in doing that but there's one thing about it tomorrow may be your day in the barrel okay you know what is meant by that it may be you'll be sick next who else will be sick next so we all bind together to pray one for the other you know and and I like what brother John Martin said one time he said why do we have to wait until we get sick he said why can't we pray for not to get sick well that's a good point you know why can't we do that just pray to not get sick and all and take care of it okay father we thank you for this day and your grace and your love we thank you for the opportunity to be able to stand and talk about you but what a day what a time we have the Lord that you would reveal yourself unto a an unworthy group of people that has no thoughts of being worthy of any form or any part to do in it but to know that you have chosen us and Lord that you're leading us into the love got each one remember the sick among us touch each one of them either remember those that are away wait brother the Beast ministering today you just be with them as they minister and may we all be together in loving you we love you and we think you got us now in Jesus name Amen brother Matthew brave will be here with us the Lord willing I guess what it'll be the eight in other words not just coming Saturday ears on but if the time with us it'll be the eighth or the night there always works out you know not just from come and weekend with the next okay my brother Matthew brave will be with us the Lord with it so let's go on into our scriptures right since therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ with whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God and I remember this what we're bringing that by whom also we have access by faith alright by faith okay now let's go over to Ephesians we'll go to for is there is one body and one spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one Lord one faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all you may be seated to the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now our thought for today will be basically based upon faith because without faith it's impossible to please God and no and we we will be going into getting more into the stature of a perfect man from this as to given us understanding of what to do but now I want you to think about one thing I've got a bunch turn off some here and I had a bunch more where the Prophet talks about that there's just one faith all right he says it's not many face he says there's one faith he said now you can have a faith and they can be many you know you can have a faith even how churches you can out denominations you can have all kind of things and it can be many things but he says there's just one the faith see thee is singular so when we get into the scriptures irony when Hebrews it says now faith is the substance it's not a substance it is the substance all right now I remember this in the Baptist because I remember saying something two of them one time only and this man was talking to me about how that you know that we was Baptist because of John we're Baptist because we followed John the Baptist said we'll I said we just messed up he said what I said you just finalized it to say in one thing John the Baptist so there's never been but one and there never will be but one right you get what I'm talking about there's just John the Baptist there's not a whole bunch of John the Baptist is running around and I said so then you're trying to make a church out of something that there's just one of it is john the baptist's i had that much understanding see back then to be able to at least read and see what words meant you can have a a Baptist you can have a faith and all I kept but there's only one faith because there's one Lord right they remember one faith one Lord one baptism all right so now we have just one baptism right in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right all right see then we'll we have only one Lord so there's not many Lords or it's not a Lord it's the Lord Jesus Christ all right so we have only one Lord one faith one baptism within we would only have one Revelation right called faith is a revelation of the word of God and faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things that you don't see me know but father my point then will drop into the message of getting to what I want you to see follows what I'm saying John the Baptist that means it's just one alright so then the faith would fit with what Paul is saying in Hebrews that faith is the substance he didn't say faith is a substance faith is the substance all right now the prophets you know you've been through it you studied the message you you've been in it long enough to know most of you that then he said it's it's not a faith it's the faith that was once delivered to the Saints he said now that's what we're contending for not a faith not a church not a doctrine deal the it's the singular because that's what the substance is now substance according to Webster is what anything consists of right faith is what anything consist of you say no this isn't no well let's see we could go on and keep reading in the Bible where they talk about by faith we know that the worlds were framed by the Word of God that it was made from things that do not appear all right so then the word would be the singular point of dealing with it and getting it to stay now on faith being de substance no no that's why brother Brennan says you can't be saved without having faith right you can't be saved without having a revelation because that's what faith is faith is a revelation of the Word of God and a revelation now a revelation can you can walk on a revelation right but you can't walk just on mental concepts then see the faith is singular and that's the substance of what anything consists of wrote a moment had a good web Vick statement because this was his way he said faith is what anything consists of would it be natural or spiritual are you following that now everything natural is a substance correct trees cars fish live food whatever people whatever it's a substance all right it's the substance it's what anything consists of all right then that's it in the going on and reading there in Hebrews you'll find the worlds were framed by the Word of God we're from what from from things that do not appear it was the Word of God the Word of God created the world alright so the substance of this world is the Word of God the substance of your faith is that sure there's the point for today remember it if we can believe that wood whatever metal thing that God created that from something that was not there he didn't take this and put it together with this and bring it down to this and make metal and then he took this and put it with that and come down made a tree no he just spoken he spoke it when he spoke it he come into being because it was the substance now is your faith that real is your faith your revelation is your new birth that real now we've been on the new birthright trying to bring it and get into it and it's laying down and getting ready to go into more into the faith virtue knowledge temperance alright but is your faith a substance or is it a mental concept now remember if it's a mental concept somebody brother would be had a good point of saying he said you can get him in with hot dogs and you can get them out with a hamburger now you understand what that means if you get somebody in by this some little doctor a little idea somebody come along with a little bit bigger idea or doctor or something and take you out right yeah but if it's a substance no I'm just trying to get a point to you it's one faith one Lord one baptism I mean there's any way to convince you that water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is incorrect if there is then you don't have a faith on that you don't have that as a substance if he can be taken away you don't have it it's a mental concept it's not a substance remember substance what do you think consists of all right now could you take away the point of being one Lord how many guards are there how many think that's why I've always just been against these people with the way they bring they've always gotta have this and - this is an antenna and I've always just been I'm sorry I've just been that away that I'm just it's the way I think if you've got two Lords you've got two gods that's as sensible as I can make it right if you've got two Lords you got two gods you've got two souls you've got two gods so God's because that's what you're depending on you don't have the substance to walk on it you have a mental concept but not of confession right but not a possession okay so now faith Hebrews 11:1 says faith is the substance of things hoped for whatever you hoping for now we can go into what the Prophet says what now he says if I'm hungry and needing some bread he said what in other words is the difference in me having the quarter which I wouldn't work today you know a couple of dollars now but alright but what would be the difference in having the quarter he says then having the bread well I don't know how the bread has seen that's you your faith is not anchored your faith is not sure you have a faith you don't have the faith he said if it isn't he said I've got the quarter he said I've got two purchasing power he said then I have the substance and he goes on to explain that the substance of anything there is an evidence because that's what the scripture says just as things hope for things not seen it's the evidence all right now if your substance is your new birth and evidence is it a substance is it something real not something that somebody can talk you out of it brother al he used to say and he'd say why don't you go front let brother Dale talk you out of the fact that you're healed we'll see I wouldn't talk you out of it but I just talk with you a little bit and find out you ain't got it because if you have the substance you have the healing it don't matter when it comes oh yeah they want to operate on my shoulder and if not know how my first year I'll probably let them because that's your hurts me but the thing of it is I'm already healed I don't care about the the point of what I got to do that's where you get all tied up within little claims that you get your idea of thing what's it matter whether you let the doctor take something out or you let God take it out that's what we don't see faith yeah but if you had faith you would have operation well if you had faith you would need Oh brother brother day huh okay is it right you gonna argue that point but the saying by stripes I'm healed and most of you know you know I got something I got tested out that's long that I've got to this word we're okay most of you know my wife and him especially the family knows that back last year and throughout last year and a few got a while I've had trouble with both knees and Weiss tried to get me that operated on and everything else well they still bother me a little bit but see the big pain is going away so I thank God but I just keep confessing it I can get up now I can walk you just keep confessing it till it comes to pies well my shoulder well I just I'm gonna confess is healed okay but still the walk right in there that day hey doc like it do whatever you got to do it fix the thing right because I believe in the doctor as well as I believe that God has give us the doctors for our thing why would brother branham tell a man when he walked up and he remember the story and and this man said he said something about his stomach he said now brother he says now there's an old doctor down here said you need to go down there to him know if you ever heard this story told this is actually I can find it in the message he said you need to go down there to that doctor and said he specializes in that kind of operation well there was a prophet sending a man to the have you ever heard this quote you don't have a right to go before God wait a minute let me make sure I get the statement right he's you don't have a right to go before God for your healing until you've been to the doctor first now it's something close to that I ain't never preached that you got to go to the doctor don't get that idea now cuz that ain't what he's talking about that ain't what brother Branham was talking about he's meaning plain to me - meaning plain sensible why are you afraid to go to what I'd prove I didn't I don't say well what do you hurting or that proves you don't have it yeah okay good office I need to preach on faith like it has but now listen if it's true that there's just one faith one Lord one baptism one God and Father of us all and in the goal yeah all right then when we get to the stature of the perfect man the Prophet said if you've read the book you're supposed to be reading on it he says now that's the basis of what I want to talk about today is faith faith then you're gonna find out in a minute that your faith is gonna flop feeling careful because see I'm gonna go ahead and put it this way there's a lot of people teach the stature of a perfect man and it's been a doctrine down through time that a lot of you sit and listen to but must not have paid no attention to it but it was taught to you that you're not born again do you get to the top of the pyramid you never heard that doctrine talk that you're not born again - you didn't the top of the pyramid you said yeah but the Prophet said we have the new birth well we don't have you have it show it to me tell me signs miracles and wonders well that's not a proof of anything that's a proof of stupidity y'all but not a proof of anything to anchor with we'll see I'm telling you the doctrine has been taught that you don't get the new birth until you come up here to the headstone now when the Prophet says you're born again at faith see that that's price at all and they tried it to to maybe kids make some doctrinal issues out of it and things you know okay but that's the point I wanted to make now before we get into the statue of perfect man I thought we're supposed to believe what the Prophet said not what we were what we think all right and see ya but brother dude I believe brother so-and-so said I don't care what brother someone's from saying huh I don't have nothing to do with it it's what God has to do with it it's what he said and like I told you know I was sitting talking to her two brothers and one of them went this way off the scale and he says you're not born again until you get to the headstone pyramid and all it up to talk and all like that the other brother said well you ain't got nothing yet these two ministers I said what y'all brother's mind if I just kind of stake somewhere in the middle I said cuz I certainly can't go with with that that we don't have nothing till we get here and I can't go with the fact and deny what I do have I'll see you mind if I just kind of stay here in the middle and then let me quote the Prophet he said I met people that had the baptism with the Holy Ghost just exactly like the day of Pentecost both of them admitted right openly that they couldn't explain that that they wondered why he said that I thought it simple once you just go back to the book of Acts now you've heard me explain this a lot of them but some of you and you would have it on the day of Pentecost you got a split condition you got 120 in the upper room that has been tutored for three and a half years and then the Holy Ghost failed well the Prophet said it gave them these virtues now watching these virtues but he stopped here he said but the headstone ain't come yet so now he's stipulating a point okay let's see that put them positionally at a good point all right but the just a few hours later a little bit here's three thousand outside that here is one sermon and receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth eternal life they get it at faith then everybody that's born again since that day is born again at faith are the earnest of our inheritance we'll get to that more as we talking to more the statue of a perfect man but now think of it if substance is what anything consists of then your new birth consists of the word that has been revealed to you you follow that I never asked anybody to agree with me I don't ask my wife I'm their kids what a degree with me I ask you to listen because I'll explain what I believe and why I believe it and this left up to you cuz I can't reveal it to you there's no way I can reveal it to you I can only speak about it and then God has to reveal it okay now if it's true then that faith is the substance and faith is the birth of the word that you've heard so usually what happened to the disciples look how they had been taught all of these things look through here all through the Ministry of Jesus Christ for three and a half years and the Holy Ghost failed it made them sons and daughters of God well but now the next time it happened on which was an hour so later you had three thousand at one time to receive the Holy Ghost are you going to say well this one got the Holy Ghost but this didn't get the whole ego no it's simple like I tried to tell those brothers you're born again at faith the new birth is the earnest of our inheritance the Bible said until the presented earnest very nervous until the possession comes forth into full manifestation all right and see then would you birth stand true can you walk on your revel now we're not talking about you gotta walk physically you know we'll get up brother then walk down through here beneath n beat us all come on a lot of you don't even know that being here and walk right off the platform right out in midair but you see it's not that a way to try to make something it's whether or not what's within you controls you makes you to what you need to be all right now what about this faith I'm trying to get a point now to you so listen so faith is what I'm seeking after you know I can make a confession but I needed substance then if I have a substance I don't worry about somebody trying to take it away from me so you think that Here I am and I've done it for all these here we're on internet going out I've always said if you see me wrong come on show me where I'm wrong we never had anybody yet to come I thought when we put it on the internet and opened it up that it be that my mail would be so full till they'd have to send a special UPS truck to send me my mail you know but yet I just try to preach it so straight till I know where they're at at least I appreciate the brothers they're not gonna try to beat they're not gonna show how dumb they are you know I don't mean that to be wrong cuz they're not gonna come out and just say well I think you're wrong oh yeah they do whatever works out you know around you know you know different things that but I'm just saying if you really have a substance if you really have the new birth you're not afraid of anybody in any doctrine huh come on if you really have the new birth you have that substance faith okay no all right now we'll start into the message I'm asking you this question do you believe that the disciples had the new birth morning getting experience baptism of the holy ghost whatever you want to lay with in there to talk about it do you believe that your disciples had the new birth then if he knew that if you believe they had the new birth do you believe you have it as they had it there's the second question see we can talk about and that's what people do they say well you know we don't have it like them well I don't see why not yeah I wouldn't the one that said the things a prophet said it so it's less up to God to produce it all right do you really have the confidence in the fact that you're born again that you're a child of God that you have within you right now eternal life in your soul not in your body your spirit but in your soul the being that you are do you have eternal life if not then we need to all recall right we need to get that straight so that's why that I'm preaching so hard and so straight about it to make sure that if you're not dead since you're on what you're believe then you can be wavered by any doctrine or idea you fall after anything because he's Satan it's not that we're facing we're facing the the Christian faces the worst doctrinal issues and pride things that could ever be thought of to consider the fact of a new birth [Music] but do you believe that you have the new birth I'm not talking about now listen why explain things that are going on I believe every born-again believer will prove by the Prophet is born again at faith because he said how faith and be born again okay if you lift some statue of a perfect man you've heard him let's see the disciples were right here 120 in the upper room because they'd been tutored for three annive here right three and 1/2 years they had been tutored by the Lord Jesus taught the word and when they were born they were born at that place but the people outside the later that heard the word they couldn't be born again up here because they don't have the word they were born again here where it says faith well honest don't believe God brother so until he really made it sound good I really enjoyed I just don't understand what you're talking about well you might want to pray and ask God to reveal it because the new birth is a revelation you know and you can't be born again without a revelation what I still have a revelation to that well then you're not born again okay problem solved I'm saying it why don't you say it if you don't have an anchor within your soul to word that there's something within you that cannot be taken away then you need to be in the altar well I just really don't know whether I'm born again well then what are you doing about it you remember what I've always told you I would to God I could preach to where everybody in this building would wind up figuring out they wasn't saved that way you could do something about it you could go before God and cry out to him to give you an answer to what you need I'm not trying to tell you your loss I never try to tell nobody they lost and that Pentecostal God enter at work at the time told me that then he wasn't fooling with with the devil no more come and he said I'm commanding the Lord I didn't holler and scream tell him how wrong he was I just disappeared because I was talking to the big guy myself you know what I mean that man didn't have enough sense to say that it was what was inside of him don't by the fact of being the devil talking I said sorry buddy I can't go that away I said when it says commands you me it doesn't mean that you're commanded it means you believe God and thank God for giving it to you and you believe it and he'll make it manifest right but think about it now what kind of a faith did those Apostles house what kind of a faith did a high up every one of them gave their life for the gospel I think John's the only one who died a natural death right I believe that's correct everybody else was crucified one way or the other gave their life with our faith they able to stand that test well you sure do preach negative don't if you didn't understood what I was talking about and you'd see how positive what I'm talking about is I'm talking about the most positive point that could ever be made if you're truly born again you have eternal life dwelling within your soul and there's no way you can ever lose it it can't be taken away it's given unto you now listen all right let's start now with our our point of thinking because this is the lay in the background to start on the statue of a perfect man so go ahead and pull up number number two let's start right there because I want you to think about these scriptures and what they're actually saying now this is 2nd Peter this goes on down to get to the virtue or knowledge temperance places and all that but let's start off where it starts this is 2nd Peter 1 and 1 Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ so now we're talking about like precious faith life is like anything you know it means it's it's the same thing or you know like precious so whatever faith they had we need well you think you have what they had if we don't have what Peters talking about we're lost you want to argue that if we don't have what Peters talking about we're lost that's as blunt as I can be I don't like your way of expressing though well good maybe you'll do something about it but look silent Peter a servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God all right Peter is saying I will read his we will in 2nd Peter is saying I have this faith and I'm dressing this to the people to have this faith the same faith I'll now watch him listen to brother branham Peter's not talking about that you got to be up here before you got anything all right now let's just read it's a greater number number three is degree killer number four let's starting to read some from the stature of a perfect man paragraph 33 now that second Peter the first chapter Simon Peter served an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ I like the way that stated right there because my whole subject this morning is based on faith let me read that again listen close Simon Peter a servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that obtained obtained like precious faith through the righteousness of God and our Savior and our and Jesus Christ notice rolling up where you can make sure that cos retreated notice he is saying that I have obtained this faith that's brother Branham said you supposed to been reading it so you read it now he is saying that I have obtained this faith I have the faith all right and I'm addressing this to them that has obtained the like precious faith he said I've got the faith and I'm addressing this to people that have the same faith I have it's not to the outside world this is to the church see those that are in Christ now Peter you were chosen to open the doors to the Gentiles you were chosen for many things you wrote a lot in your own hand and thing to us and you're saying that you have a certain kind of faith he said now I'm addressing this to people that's got that same kind of faith now is that what he said I'm addressing this to them that has obtained the like precious faith who see rotten - - born-again Christians right now look what he said it's not to the outside world now here's been the hardest thing for me to try to get people to see maybe for me to see it so ok by women til I get through where I can see it and then you'll be all right the Bible is not written to a sinner the only thing the Bible can do to a sinner is condemn that person for sinning bring to them a knowledge that they need to be saved it is not written to them because they can't understand it right now I've got a lot going over here later but I'll put go ahead and drop it in here the Bible says no man can call Jesus the Christ except by the Holy Ghost the brother said brother Brennan said except by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can't call Jesus the Christ you can said all day long by your mouth but until you can say it from your heart by the new birth you don't have it so look at what Peter told him I have obtained this faith I've got this faith I have this revelation of Jesus Christ and I'm addressing this to them that has obtained the same like precious faith so now he's evidently talking to somebody that's got it so now that blows the doctrine out that nobody's got it until you come down here to get in the end one of the really what they're saying there's nobody ain't got it till I tell them how what it is you don't listen to doctrines like that you ought to listen sometimes what they're saying instead of the mouth words they use him come on the brother probably was telling you ain't gonna have it til I tell you where you got it or not okay now listen church it's not to the outside world the Bible is not written to the outside world it can only bring a sinner to a natural knowledge that he needs to be saved yeah but I know a man that can quote the other scripture in the Bible and he he's got a good memory thank God wish I had it but it ain't gonna be knowing that won't save him well all I gotta do is believe what do you believe if you're gonna put it on the basis all you gotta do is believe what do you believe what are you to believe I never thought about it like that happen let's see the Bible the Statue of perfect man is not written in 2nd Peter to the world but neither is Matthew 29-28 that what it is about the water baptism the Bible is not written get that point if I have to stay on it to finish this whole day get the point the Bible is not written to a person that is lost you cannot understand it without the new birth without the Holy Ghost now I've got them laying here how many of me you want that no man can call Jesus the Christ it's about 30 something times that brother Branham says that maybe more you can't call Jesus the Christ without the new birth so you can say all day long the words you can quote them you can do everything your honor you can call it all you can do all that but that doesn't tell me what he's talking about the probably says you can't call him call Jesus the Christ except it be by the new birth because it's the new birth inside of unit speaking out it's him that's doing the talking it ain't you right and see you say you ever brunella I know I'm born again because I've done this side of the other heaven help us if that's where we're still left well you can't tell me I saved I ain't trying to tell you you saved I'm trying my best to get you to think about it see because you cannot be saved unquote listen here somewhere or any other you cannot be saved without it being a revelation that's what the prophets said now so it's not shouting crying speaking in tongues feelings ideas and things that we had happen I know I'm saved because I felt yes I done that it's none of those things you can't put it on that you can only put it on whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word and that agrees means keeps all agreeing what I told that Baptist preacher I said the Bible says he that believeth in his baptized believe that keeps on believing I said why'd y'all teach it to us that all you had to do was to believe it well we did not so wait a minute come on get off I taught plain to him just like I do hard but I said you know yourself what I'm talking about you taught it to us and telling us all we had to do was believe I said the Bible says the devil believed and trembled about he said well I guess we did teach it wrong but listen do you have the same born-again experience now I remember what I've explained it over and over 120 in the upper room got the baptism of the Holy Spirit the 3,000 outside got the baptism of the Holy Spirit it's the same Holy Spirit it maybe degreed in the basis of how much knowledge or understanding or whatever goes with it but it's the same new birth anybody that's born again we've got the same new birth only you women that had babies unless there was something went wrong and it had to be done some other things all of you women had a baby the same water blood and baby then they just didn't go through what I did see that's what I'm saying you do that and then you go into the gospel letter wait you said well well they didn't have the problem right ahead cuz I've talked to them and they didn't hurt like I heard what are you trying to prove what they got to do with it birth is the birth the new birth is a birth everybody that's born again is born again the same that's why I've taught that over for for the fifty years I've been in the message and it takes justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost to have the new birth and ever new birth is a birth of the word like precious life is equally precious especially honored to be you know of the same so Peter said I'm writing this to those that have obtained like precious faith so now I've received this faith and I'm writing it to those who have this faith what now he's gonna tell you about statue of perfect man right we're having to get this out of the way code now you know he's gonna tell you about the statue of a perfect man add to your faith virtue and all these temperance bases on but he said I want you to know you first got to be born again you've got to have the inside teacher before you could be taught anything outside of that is head knowledge if you do not have the new birth then see you don't have that inside teacher then you can have a faith ain't Lord ain't baptism which you can't howdy faith the Lord and the baptism he is singular it has nothing to go with it like precious faith just exactly like what Peter had well now Peter was way up here with see now you're trying to get Peter them got the new birth same way of anybody else the new birth started him right down here justification of sanctification this was their baptism of the Holy Spirit because they were tutored for three and I of your but the three thousand outside only heard one message and they were justified sanctified and filled with the Holy Spirit and wound up being babes in Christ desiring in the sincere milk of the word that we may grow thereby what is the faith that was once delivered to the Saints I mean I was looking at him this morning the run said that's the one we're honestly contending for her we're not contended for what was delivered to the Baptist imagine that's the presbytery or whatever we're not you know we're honestly contending for the faith that was delivered to the Saints and Peter called it like precious faith he said I have this like precious faith and I'm talking to people that have the like precious faith this is not written to the world it's not far the world it's to get you born again it can tell people they're lost don't misunderstand me when I make a bold statement a sinner cannot comprehend the Word of God he can only get his intellectual concept of that and I've told you over and over my experience I came up through straight strict doctrine come into this message wound up hearing a prophet telling what a new birth was and when I did I realize I didn't have it you know I was a deacon at 23 years of age teaching the adult Sunday School classes in time when I walked out of the Baptist Church well honored among the people of the Baptist faith but when I heard brother Branham telling about a new birth being the birth of the word I knew that if I had a birth of the word that was a Baptist word I wouldn't born again for two years after coming in this message I would not take the doctrine and ideas of people even though they told me said well you've done this you've done that you believe the message you must be born again it ain't to me two years until God came down and sealed that for me and during that time brother Colley sitting right there he can tell you I have been known to read six books in one day and listen to two tapes in that same day not bragging just telling the truth I've done it because I believe it if you're gonna believe the words you need to know what it says I had a decent knowledge of the Bible point but when that prophet brought it alive I seen God that I met when I was 11 years old and I knew where he was at but nobody couldn't get me to him but I talked to people about it and they just whether you need to go to some Pentecostal church or do something they didn't understand me you see after I come in this message I didn't say well I come into the message so it proves I'm saved for two years I saw God I probably read more than one day and a lot of yous read in a year and many of you ever read six books in one day how long it took me all day because I wanted to know what the Prophet said because this man talked about a birth that I knew I didn't have he talked of the birth of the word of a like precious faith are you listening like precious faith okay but uh Brennan was quoting Peter and he said Peter said I have this faith and I'm addressing this to people that have this faith are you one of them do you have the faith there's one faith one Lord one baptism do you have the faith not trying to decrease denies anybody or say anything about it I'm trying to tell the truth do you have the new birth if you do then that new birth is this a new birth that Peter received and now he's gonna teach us how to come up the statue of a perfect man like precious faith what is like precious faith what is it go ahead with number four a usually I put a lot of numbers in on this one because I kept adding from the message calls earnestly contending for the faith little brother said I just love that address he's talking about Jude the brother and all of that he sanctified O God and preserved in Jesus Christ and called I just love that address I like the way he places that out there now look this letter not written to the unbelievers notice he states specifically to them that are sanctified goes on down takes you totally into the new birth this is not talking to unbelievers unbelievers cannot understand what Peter's talking about where do they be in this message or outside the message unbelievers cannot follow what the Prophet is saying that's where the trouble is that you say yeah but nobody don't have that light precious faith nobody just don't have it like they had it well go ahead to number five what house will you build me and now that brother green you know who that is brother / green God has sent him in here and opened us up a church of like precious faith that we believe it he said for the pretty green come in to pick up a church of like precious faith go ahead number six so happy today to have received the baptism of the holy ghost and to be a fellow worshiper of like precious faith as you all stand far today number seven all the ways of our life my brothers and sisters who are like precious faith who's been born of the Holy Ghost that's had the blood of Jesus Christ to sanctify me thing like precious faith but it wasn't so from the beginning so about the baptism of the Holy Spirit I truly believe that with all my heart I believe in the gifts of the Spirit prophesied speaking in tongues etc and all the great things that goes in the body of Christ and believed by one spirit we're all baptized into that body and our members and fellow citizens of the kingdom of God and brethren and sisters of like precious faith seemed like he knowed a little bit about like precious faith well we just we just don't see God moving like this you know why that statement alone is one when you say we don't see God moving that means you are doubting God moving and when you're doubting God moving God can't move in your life now you blaming everybody else well I remember when the church used to be so much on fire who died are you part of the church well what went wrong but I remember when we used to have this we witnessed what went wrong who doesn't know how no revival what went wrong I preached to you'll know things right the Prophet said there'd be a revival come that would fill every fiber of our being and take us in the rapture well my life don't see it well what did that got to do with it you think you're something you think you can control it let's don't see that we have the faith the Apostles had what do we have well we just don't see it mean we don't see it cause we don't believe it now you want to testimony meeting yeah but we don't see the book of Acts alive anymore [Music] you don't test them on the meeting he's been healed by the Lord of different things many times as we've seen storms spoke into existence because we needed rain but spoke out of existence because we got too much rain how many things do we need what do we need to be proof we've seen the dead raised I'll take you right today to a man's house and he'll tell you in a hurry that that man right there him and his son was standing there and said if he hadn't have been there I'd be dead he's because I died he told the world I mean the people around us while we're hunting together he told him seen his eyes robot wait said daddy he's dead I just called his name real loud I said Rando and he just was I am just raised on a hook we've seen the sick healed what do we need why don't we believe that we have like precious faith without talking about like precious faith that Peter is talking about like precious faith is this place right here not only up here it's right here like precious faith is the faith that we can attain them to if we have the new birth we have that faith we have the faith in disciples head so we have the same faith that everybody has if you're born again you have the same eternal life right when I just don't see that's what I'm saying that's what it goes to well I just don't resist own you don't see it cuz you never will see it well if we just had the Prophet back I'll tell you this Elijah that's the best I can say it for your sake in men and we don't need the Prophet back today I said that the way I minute and you take it what you want to I said for our part we don't need him back why because he condemned every one of us well you don't want see that's what he said you'd already done you don't run that to your mind you doesn't figured out all I'm talking about I'm talking about one time if we if he was here right now he'd call out every one of our unbelief around the Wimbley my god what's wrong they like precious faith we can have like precious faith if you have the new birth you have like precious faith you don't have the statue of a perfect man into manifestation we'll pick that up this evening where it comes into the divine nature of God see by the new birth you have the same faith the Apostles had you have eternal life in your soul don't let the devil beat you down stand up and say that's it I believe it why can't you stand for it I've stood over 50 years declaring this message to be right and I believe it more today than I did when I started and I'm glad he's let it go the way he let it go because it's gonna drop everything that ain't work nothing somebody's going to believe it and stand on it are we that people we start with like precious faith then we grow in grace and knowledge see that's what you're gonna have to accept to see that the new birth gives you that faith they don't give you virtue or knowledge temperance patience those are the things we are birthed into after we receive the new birth to come into the body after we're born again these are the things then God expects us to add if you read the Statue of per man you heard that but let me say it this away ain't asking for raise a hand but how many of these read the Statue of perfect men since I announced that you needed to read it buys you I wouldn't raise no hand if I hadn't done it cuz you build a locker you see what I'm talking about many have studied that message you listen to a tape or we get you want to know yes you don't know whether it's right or not won't you read the book and say you know I'm like this I'm gonna end it come on musician I'm this way you realize that if God doesn't move on the scene we're gonna be too deceived and taken into the wrong way and gonna wind up like the rest well I ain't deceived well why can't we say we believe it and say thank you Lord for what you've revealed to us do you realize what God has revealed to you things that the prophets desired to look into is at the Bible they desired to look into the things you and I see I couldn't see it I couldn't believe it correctly sure what's fine for their time what you see the world's weight no me and you adoption time is that what the prophets said they're all waiting on you and the adoption time when he can pour into us his fullness and the Baptism and raise the dead and we'll go in the rapture told you the other day about this had a lady over school over there and they called her flunking Duncan because she always would kick everybody out but anybody did ever stayed under her long enough to get anchored with her and her teachings they wound up to be great math people she knew what to do to teach it but she couldn't get nobody listen so she had to go ahead and flunk them you don't turn them down and kick them out and give them zeros what would happen if they just listened they wouldn't even have took a book home that's what I've always said it about this message how many times do you read and study and pray your Bible or the message how many times well yet to say this is my way this is this is and I'm holding this up coming in here is the notes this is my way to get out of here but I don't never read it well now whose fault is it father we thank you we just asked you to help us now to understand how that we need to walk into you that our hearts and lives go to be resting and you got us now on your grace in Jesus name let's stand together god is so good ah [Music] he's so - easy [Music] god oh good he's no good if I'd have a name me he answers prayer he answers cried he [Music] answers
