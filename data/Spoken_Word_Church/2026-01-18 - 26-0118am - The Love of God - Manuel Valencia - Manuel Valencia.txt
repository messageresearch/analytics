TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Good morning, saints. God bless you. Praise the Lord. I have one opening scriptures if you can go to. It's Romans 5:5. While I get set up here. Need some help here with brothers? Cuz I think set need some help, brother. I think it has a different kind of connection here. Let's bow our heads as we're uh getting situated here. If you can help me out. I think it has a different extension this time. Heavenly Father, we're so grateful this morning, Lord, that you've given us such a precious truth, such a precious life, such a precious revelation, such a precious faith and in the love of God that shed about our hearts. Lord God, we ask that this morning you would set this time the time aside, Father, that you would um come speak to us, encourage us in in your Father, in your word. Encourage us in u as we pray for one another and encourage us, Lord God, as we um as we read these pages of Life Eternal. And I want to ask, Father, for a special song this morning, for a special continuation, Father, of the meetings that we've been having. And I pray that you will enign us eternally with your word as we turn these uh precious words of life in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. So in Romans 5:5 we have &gt;&gt; use this one. &gt;&gt; Can I use that one? Oh, it was just un unhook. There you go. Thank you, brother. We'll get to Appreciate it. Got number two there. And then I'm I'm at number two now. So we should be going. &gt;&gt; Okay. Very good. &gt;&gt; I think it's cuz the uh &gt;&gt; your display settings just keep &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, just hang tight so we can uh go over the notes better. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. Went on. So in Romans 5:5 it says, "And hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us." And the title of this Sunday school lesson was going to be the the love of God. Amen. And particularly looking at uh in here it says that it was the love of God that's shed about on our hearts, but it is something that's given to us, right? And it is by the Holy Ghost. And that that's what gives us that hope that we that make it not ashamed. Amen. And we will look at topics such as the love of God towards us. And then we'll look at topics such as how we're commanded to love one another. And then we'll look also at um the wrong kind of love or erroneous love, a warning actually against the warning uh of the erroneous love. And then um and then uh a special subtopic about how faith that workketh by love. This one. &gt;&gt; It's this one, sir. Yeah. Got me set up. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you very much. All righty. Thank you very much. So, we read that scripture. And here's what I said we were going to talk about is God loves towards us. God loves us. We love God. A warning against erroneous love. And how we are commanded to love one another. And then how faith that workketh by love. So that's what we'll be talking about when it comes to God's love towards us. Um I have a question. There's a question here. Behold, what manner of love? You know, just think about it. God is God, right? Like if you're an owner of something, if you're an owner of a store or landlord, you can be the owner of something, but it doesn't mean you have to love, right? You you could be the owner of something. So he could have been the owner of this universe or creator, right? In theory. But let's say that he didn't have love. So just think about it that way, right? Just think about, you know, how deep love goes and and how foundational it is that it starts with him and then he's given it to us first before he commens it. Right? So think about that question. What manner of love the father has bestowed upon us. It says here that we should be called the sons of God. So don't take it for granted that you're called the son of God because this is actually actually asking it in a connotation of do you know how much love you are when you are taken in as a son when you're taken in as a daughter. It's typifying there something. Therefore the world knoweth us not the believer because it knew him not. You see it takes it back to the first time the word love was mentioned in the Bible and that is in Genesis 22 verse two. And he said, "Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest." The first time the word love was mentioned. But you know what? That's typifying, right? And get thee into the land of Mariah, the mountain. Remember, and offer him therefore a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. A very selective mountain, right? But look here, right? For God so loved, right? So he he's the one we know that we took. So that that was a type, right? So Isaac loved I mean um Abraham Li loved Isaac, right? And that was a type. But we said about what manner of love is this? Well, that's the manner of love. It was for God. So he loved it so much is what that means that if he would have done an an act of love that would have been more worthy of saying I love you, he would have done it. &gt;&gt; So think about how much love that is. You know be called son. But another thing is to give your only begotten son. And I'll summarize some of the scriptures because I got plenty of them. In 1 John 3:16, pretty much a parallel there. See John 3:16, but here's 1 John 3:16 as well. It says, "Here I perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us." &gt;&gt; Same thing. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. So, it's gonna get deep here shortly. So, buckle your seat belt on that. See 1 John 4:9 it says, "In this was manifested the love of God towards us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him again." So just manifestation of that love. Brother Brandham preached a few um messages on love. I think it was upward of nine if you search the word love and message titles and one of them was literally called love. Another one was called the projection of love and another one when divine love is projected &gt;&gt; right and we'll see them here in a little bit and there's another portion of that title but you see that is how God showed us that he loved us right and it's through the Bible in Proverbs 3:12 says for whom the Lord loveth he correcteth even as a father the son you see the type here father son I Abraham loved Isaac in whom he delightth again as the father hath loved me so I love you continue ye in my love. That's 1 John 15. Jesus speaking. Now speaking a little bit about wisdom in Proverbs particularly and we'll see later in Proverbs 8. Um that chapter is full of I call it the chapter of wisdom where wisdom itself is speaking like in the eye in the first person. And here's what it says. Get wisdom in in chapter 4 Proverbs. Get understanding. Forget it not. Neither decline from the words of my mouth. Forsake her not. And she shall perserve thee. love her wisdom and she shall keep thee. And here it says now wisdom is speaking by me princes rule and nobles even all judges of the earth I love them that love me and those that seek me early shall find me riches and honor are with me. Yeah, durable riches and righteousness. And then on this one, John 14, Jesus spoke it. It this reminds me so much. My um my wife would tell his brother, "Do you love me, brother?" And he says, "Yeah." And he was like, "Keep my commandments." Kind of stuck to me. But, you know, it it makes you think, you know, it's a very strange thing. You know, you love me. Okay. Well, keep my commandments, right? But then, think about it though. He commanded his love towards us. And think about it. He commanded us to love, but he loved us first. So, he he he's he's being fair, right? He's not saying I'm going to challenge you to do something that you cannot do. Truly, we cannot do it without him. Right? But of course, it is the love of God. Right? That's the title of the message. In Proverbs 19, it says, "He that getth wisdom loveth his own soul. He that keepeth understanding shall find good." And we have here, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" It's a portion of u the whole paragraph, right? It's only one verse. shall tribulation or distress, persecution or famine or naked or peril or sword. And it goes on to say life, death, angels, things be and things that were right. So, it's a pretty destined love. It's a pretty elected love. It's a love that, you know, has a purpose behind it. It it it accomplishes much as we'll see here through the scriptures here. And it is a fruit of the spirit, by the way. And you know what's something about it? You cannot put love in jail. Actually, it says here against these fruits, there's no law. So, it's not illegal to be to have joy, to have peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, and faith. We'll see how faith and love work together here. Meekness, temperance, the fruits of the spirit. Against such there's no law. And that's a sermon in of itself there. It's just you can't you can't come against it. You may want to, but it's it's not going to it's not going to, you know, win in a court of law, right? Ephesians 1:4, according as he hath chosen us. So, see, love does this too. In him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love. He chose us in love before the foundation of the world. In other words, in first second Timothy, we have for God hath not given us the spirit of fear. And we'll see right now a little bit about love and faith working and how, you know, fear has no space, but of power and of love. So, think about it. It's actually a spirit, right? You know, God is love. We know God's a spirit. So, you know, it's the fruit of the spirit. So, it's the spirit of love. It's God's spirit of love in you. And of a sound mind. Don't take that for granted in this day and age, right? I mean, in your human life, you may have things going many directions like that depiction that brother Luis showed, right, with a straight line, how people perceive their year is going to go and what the reality is and then how most people perceive what it is and then what it really is. One thing I like about this little diagram is that he had all kinds of arrows going every which way. But towards the end, he did have one over in the middle that did sneak out at the end. So, and they called it success, and that's reality. So you know with God's help right uh but having a sound mind having a you know a mind that can be settled on the things of God right and in Hebrews 126 it says for whom the Lord loveth he chasenneth and scores scorgeorgeth every son whom he receiveth right you know I heard it said many times you know when people say oh you know god doesn't correct you know bride or whatever you know but you're still a son of god we're a portion collectively of the bride of god So let's not use that as an excuse, right? I mean, we get corrected, right? And and it's out of love and you know it, right? And you know, and and we all know the statement, love is correct, right? But I think sometimes it can get overused in the with the hatred way, right? But of course, it's corrective, right? I mean, we correct our children. We correct each others, you know, as brothers, humans, and husbands, wives. But the idea here is that it it it has the right motive, especially when it's founded on the word of God. In Romans 5:6, I found these two verses are in parallel. And typically, the one at Romans 5'8 is very well well known, but I hadn't seen the parallel with two verses before that where it says, I'll read the 58 first. But God commandeth his love. Remember, he commanded it towards us. So, it's it's a commandment that he loves us too, not just you love too. I love you. He made his own commandment. He loves us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us, right? Very familiar scripture. But look at the one above verse 6 same chapter. For when we were yet without strength. See how it correlates that being a sinner is you have no strength to live this walk. Right? In due time Christ died for the ungodly. Right? So see it's a very parallel scripture there. And I just thought it was very interesting how in other words he's shown us a love even we had no strength. Even when we were sinners Christ died for the ungodly. Christ died for the sinner. Right? predestined to before the foundation of the world. In Ephesians 2:4 to5, it says, "But God who is rich in mercy," and by the way, the word mercy, loving kindness, you know, we know there in charity, that's parallel to love in many cases. And you know, there's deeper words of agapea love, we'll go here in a little bit, but for his great love wherewith he loved. So that love with which he loved us even when we were dead again another parallel scriptures in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace you are saved. So three parallel scriptures right but all related to love as you see there in the word speaking on the love of God brother says revelations 3:19 as many as I love I rebuke and I and chasten be sellers therefore and repent but you see the purpose here it's not just meaningless correction or it's not meaningless rebuke you know if it's it's like the difference between a butcher right and the difference between a a surgeon you know they both cut they both cut flesh you know but one one cuts it just to cut and kill And but one caus it to to remove something a hindering and to heal, right? To allow God's healing process. And as we know in one places it says that it's a good thing to a righteous man will receive a rebuke. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasen two things. Besell therefore, and repent. That's the purpose is get right. 1 John 4:16. And we have known and believed. So that's the word, the word believe. That's faith, right? The love of God. that God hath to us. So we we believe that God that loved us, he loved us with God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him. Amen. So now let's talk about us loving God. Scriptures that talk about us loving God. In Deuteronomy 6 five is where the commandment starts, right? Where it says, "And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy might." Right? So it's a commandment that he gave us remember but he showed his love towards us first and and in here I'll skip a few scriptures here it says that because so he hath set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him I will set him on high because he hath known my name and other places it says to those that love my name you know God loves a lot of things he says I love a cheerful giver he says uh Esau I hated but Jacob I loved amen so there's there's a lot things that we can see. He loves righteousness. He loves justice. I was reading scriptures as such. And um God loves um a lot of well he loves those that love him. He loves a believer. You know, in some places he said he loved the world, right? And in some places he says he loved us and Christ died for us even while we were sinners. Of course, because he knew what was going to come out of it, right? Before the foundation of the world. And it says Psalm 119. There's actually a lot of uh parallels here in the word love. And and I there's a lot of places of course in the Song of Songs, there's like love being mentioned 30 times there. Of course, the top love between the the the groom and the the bride there. It says, "Great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall offend them." That's a good test right there, right? I mean, there's a lot of things that could offend sometimes, right? So um may but that says that love thy law you know may the Lord help us in the in Psalm 119 it talks a lot about thy precepts thy testimony thy word a standard you know all referring to God's word so love one another right let love be without dissimilation think about that don't love in secret in other words your brothers it says here let love be without assimilation abore that which is evil cleave to that which is good so don't Love one another, right, with dissimilation, right? In other words, love freely because as we'll see right now, there's a proverb that kind of hits it on the nail. Proverbs say a lot with just saying very little and it talks about that better is something else than love in secret. So, it's like really, I mean, love is good, right? But it's like there's something to that. It says here, love in Romans workketh no ill. Help us, Lord, right? to his neighbor. I think we all need help here. It says, "Therefore, love is the fulfilling of the law." This is a high standard, very high standard here. And it says in 2 Timothy 4:8, "Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me, and at the day, and not to me only, but unto all them that also love his appearing." Think about love his appearing. &gt;&gt; We've been we have a message, brothers, about his appearing. I think it and and God has given us the faith and the love, right? We love his appearing. We love what he's doing in this last age. We love what he's doing through all ages. But here we are now. And we love him because he first loved us. you know, when I first read this scripture, you know, fresh cold turkey coming out of u not, you know, living 20ome years without, you know, reading scriptures, it um it's one of those where like your flesh takes a little offense of that, right? Sometimes you want to be like, "No, I'm the one that see God. No, I'm the one that love God first." You know, it's like I'm the center of the universe. You know, things revolve around me. But that's how it is. We love him because he first loved us. And that that that says a lot right there, right? In other words, we're not even capable of loving him the way he loved us because it's it's a different kind of love as we know. &gt;&gt; 1 John 5:3, for this is the love of God. Pretty descriptive, right? Pretty definitive that we keep his commandments. And you know what? After all, his commandments are they're not grievious &gt;&gt; when you receive this Holy Spiven unto us. Yeah. So otherwise you don't get that love and and they're not grievious then the commandments, right? I mean if anything it's it's it's healing for you to surrender and to know that something wasn't right and the word, you know, the commandment of God um brought you to repentance. You know, there's a scripture that says that the love of God leads you to repentance. And in the King James, it it uses another word for the word love there. But uh many other translations, it says the love of God that leads us to repentance, right? And it says Jude 21, keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy and for the Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. So keep yourselves in the love of God. And you think about it is just it's you got to remember too, there's growth in the love of God. There's keep yourself. And there's some of the scriptures that you feel like, well, does that mean I don't love God? Well, I mean, it does say, you know, that it does say certain things about you have to see what it's saying, right? It's not saying you're going to hell, right? It's just saying that if you're not abiding, for example, right, in his love, then you may not get this. It don't mean you never love God or God never loved you and gave you, you know, the Holy Spirit. But it it just it's a remember those that I chasen and rebuke, you know, you know, I correct, those are the that are son of God, those that I love. Amen. So, warnings about erroneous love. Just take a little quick detour here about uh the erroneous love and then we'll start wrapping it up. So, Psalm 42, oh ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? How long will ye love vanity? So, it's obviously not the love of God, right? &gt;&gt; And seek after leasing, deceitful falsehood. Salah. First Timothy, it says, "For the love of money is the root of of all evil." And you know one one time a preacher stopping me because he says you know money is not the rule of all evil. And I'm like let me point you to the scripture brother you know as we know it says the love of money right and it's the love that's supposed to take God's place right as we'll see in another scripture which you can't serve two masters and it compares God and mammon. So which while some coveted after see it was not the right kind of love I think it got exposed there is covet they have ered from the faith. So see it's erroneous love and pierce themselves &gt;&gt; with many sorrows and help us. You know, there's things that happen to us in life, but there's things that we inflict upon ourselves. &gt;&gt; Right? And and again, it that's not saying you can't have, you know, we all need to have our means, but what that means is just don't love them above God. Right? &gt;&gt; And it says, "And he asked, see, there's three scriptures I bring about that little subtopic here 510, he that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver." See, because silver cannot satisfy what God's supposed to satisfy, nor he that loveth abundance with increase. So that that's one big term there. This is also vanity. &gt;&gt; So that's where he says that no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. See what happens. Ye cannot serve God and mammon and the flesh does not like that. I mean every time I read that scripture I just feel like right because I think you know it's &gt;&gt; it cuts. I mean &gt;&gt; it cuts. So it's the word of God is still true. &gt;&gt; In Psalm 52 3-4, thou love is evil. So the wrong kind of love we talk about more than good. So you know it says more than good. So there's a little bit of fo whatever what you want to call it love right of good and lying rather than speak righteousness. Sellah thou lovest all devouring words and thou deceitful tongue. It's talking about the tongue the evil tongue on this one. And concerning the wicked men it says as he loved cursing. Pretty strong words. So let it come unto him. So he delighted not on blessing. So let let it be far from him. The blessing. See, now of course that word love, you know, cursing, that's not agile love, right? A gopple of uh cursing, right? It's it's a heav. And there's many other words that are used for the word love. So in Proverbs 1, it says, "How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity, and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge and wisdom." Here talking about wisdom. But he that sinnth against me, wisdom speaking in the first person, wrongeth his own soul. Remember it says, he that loveth love me loveth his own soul. But here's the opposite. All they that hate me love death. This can't serve to masters. &gt;&gt; And here it's talking about that it's better to have a dinner with herbs. He imagines like, "Hey, I trade you a little bit of my spare money. Can I get some ro Romero here?" Yeah, &gt;&gt; have a dinner like that where love is then stalled ox where hatred they're with, right? And we all know that. I think we experienced that. Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more again than lovers of God. So, this is the the proverb I was talking about. Sometimes just like little hits it on the nail. Open rebuke is better than secret love. Can you imagine that? It's better to get rebuked openly than to be loved in secret. Meditate on that. Think about it. I have not wrapped my mind around that one. My goodness. I I just read it like cold turkey like you know it some they stand for themselves some of these proper verses a little some of them have a little bit of content like what it was talking about but some of them are just by themselves because it's just saying this and that it's giving you a contrast. So can you imagine like love talking about love so I'm just saying you know there's there's some warnings about certain loves you love in secret. Why why in secret? Maybe he's exposing something there, &gt;&gt; right? And it's saying that it's actually just put that aside. It's actually better for you to rebuke openly. &gt;&gt; That that's something, brothers. All right, Jeremiah. I want to put it up here. The Lord hated the that um the Lord, excuse me, hath appeared of old unto me, saying, "Yep, I'll love thee with an everlasting love." Pretty sure. Therefore, with loving kindness have I drawn thee. Love not the world, neither the things that. So that scripture there was just giving you a contrast of you know there's a wrong kind of love and then there's the elective love but love not the world. So you know of course not the right world neither the things of the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him. Another cutter here right and this is the condemnation right that man love the darkness but the light because they didn't want their evils to their their their works to be exposed the evil works. And um in here it says, "For all that is in the world, right, the lust of the flesh, the pride of life, the is not of the father, it's of the world and passes away. The lust thereof, but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So just love one another. Here it says um a new commandment, love one another. Love one another. Of course, it's all throughout the scripture. Let brotherly love continue. Right? &gt;&gt; We have that here. And it says, "Love one another because love is of God. loveth you he that loveth is born of God and knoweth God and he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love right he's the source of it I mean God himself is love for this is the message that we have heard from the beginning that we should love one another right so it's clear but look at this for the for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue I need help from evil and his lips that they speak no I mean, I love life. I want to see good days. So, let's take the recipe there. We know that we have passed from death onto life because we love the brethren. &gt;&gt; We He that loveth not his brethren abideth in dead. Here, just wrapping up here. Husbands, love your wives. Very familiar scripture. But look at this. And be not bitter against them. I think we need help with this, brothers. Now, it also says, you know, love one another as Christ loved the church. In another place, as Christ loved us in another place, too. I'm gonna read this one quote. The children of Israel, brother Brandham speaking. He says in 47, very early on, friends, when you miss the love of God in your hearts, you miss everything. No matter what you're done, where there's tongues, they shall cease. Where there's prophecies, it shall vanish. But where there is charity, love, it lasts forever. I'd rather my wife would love me than be afraid of me. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you? Sure. You love God, the love of God in your heart. You know what, brothers? It takes more to lead life a family by love than to lead him by fear. &gt;&gt; It's the default thing of of the flesh, right? But I'm saying it takes more. I know sometimes we default to like, you know, because I said so on and everything, but it really takes more. Great love hath had no man. So there's no greater love than this than this that a man lay down his life for his friends. So this is my commandment that you love one another as I love you. See does the husband and wife also commending the husbands love your wives even as Christ loved the church and he gave himself for it. So it's sacrificial love agapa love right. No man has seen God at any time. If we love one another God dwelt within us and his love is perfected in us. So there's growth, maturity, and the last scriptures here, faith that workketh with love. For in Jesus Christ, neither circumcision availth anything for in circum nor in circumcision, but this scripture is tremendous foundational because but faith which workketh by love, that's what availth. &gt;&gt; So can you imagine? So faith is accompanied with love because everything we've been talking about, it has that that purpose. It has that elective love. It has that well intention behind it. So faith comes out of that. you faith you know motivates I mean love motivates faith it helps operate that faith because there's love may love be in this building here as we get ministered on later on here and wherefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus I love and the love unto all the saints so there's four salutations where it says faith and love what I heard after faith and love here in Colossians Paul faith and love faith and love see love and faith see look at this faith and charity Paul's speaking to them after I heard about all this So just just just that's how love and faith work together. &gt;&gt; Hold fast the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me in faith and love. You see? So now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and faith unfaint. See love faith. Love faith. &gt;&gt; And the question is does love cast out fear? Nope. It's but close. Perfect love cast out all fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. And here we have you. No there's no fear in love. Perfect love cast off fear. Fear has torment and fear is not he that fear is not made perfected. And last I'll leave you with this. I was u hearing brother uh Tim Puit preach and as I was studying about a month ago and then he just said this statement. It just is one of those that wake you up and it says fear is faith turned inside out. It's the opposite of faith. It believes more in Satan's power to harm than God's power to deliver. So let your faith triumph over your fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you brothers. Uh we had all the scriptures here that says above all these things put on charity which is the perfect which is the bond of perfection and let all your things be done in charity. Amen. God bless you brothers. Have a wonderful service. Praise the Lord.
