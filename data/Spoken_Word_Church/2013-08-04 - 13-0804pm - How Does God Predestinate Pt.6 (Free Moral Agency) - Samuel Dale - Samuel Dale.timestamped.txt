[2:31] and listen uh
[2:33] children uh please stay out of the tape
[2:38] room now some of you children have been
[2:41] going into the tape room and causing a
[2:43] lot of problems in the tape room all
[2:46] right don't don't that's not a
[2:49] playroom it's it's a very small room but
[2:53] it's not a play room to go in there and
[2:54] play cuz you you can do a lot of damage
[2:56] so parents instruct your children don't
[2:59] play in the playroom we got plenty of
[3:01] other places to go play and do like that
[3:04] okay all right so just remember that you
[3:07] like turning your scriptures to Romans 8
[3:10] where we've been reading and then Joshua
[3:14] 24 Romans 8 Joshua
[3:18] 24 Heavenly Father we thank you for this
[3:21] day in your grace thank you for your
[3:23] love unto us and your guidance and
[3:25] understanding thank you for you we ask
[3:28] you now that you would just come Lord
[3:30] and speak to
[3:32] us give us your understanding that we
[3:35] may walk in your love because that's our
[3:37] desire forgive our sins cleanse us Lord
[3:41] and keep us just bless each one remember
[3:44] those that are not here and one's out
[3:47] way Lord Brother Dean there at his
[3:48] brother ministering just be with them
[3:51] weighing them down with there at the
[3:54] funeral lord of the viewing and things
[3:57] and just bless them Lord take care care
[3:59] them on the way home have your way we
[4:01] love you we thank you in Jesus name
[4:05] amen Romans
[4:09] 8 and then we go to
[4:14] Deuteronomy I excuse me
[4:17] Joshua Romans 8 verse
[4:20] 28 and we know that all things work
[4:23] together for good to them that love God
[4:25] to them who are the called according to
[4:27] his purpose for whom he did Forno he
[4:31] also did
[4:32] predestinate to be conformed to the
[4:35] image of his son now remember as I told
[4:37] you when you're reading scripture read
[4:40] it as to whether it's speaking past
[4:44] tense present tense or future tense you
[4:48] know read it as you're looking at it see
[4:51] and it says for whom he did for
[4:56] no all right for
[4:58] knowledge he also did predestinate to
[5:02] what to be conformed to the image of his
[5:05] son all right so that's in time coming
[5:08] down that he might be the firstborn
[5:10] among many
[5:12] Brethren more of whom he did
[5:15] predestinate he done it back there
[5:17] because of looking forward then he also
[5:20] called and whom he called them he also
[5:23] Justified and then we Justified then he
[5:26] also
[5:27] glorified what shall we then say to
[5:29] these things if God be for us who can be
[5:33] against us now we'll go back to this one
[5:36] scripture there in in
[5:40] Joshua the
[5:50] 24:15 and if it seem evil unto you to
[5:53] serve the Lord choose you this day whom
[5:56] you will
[5:57] serve whether the god gods of your
[6:00] fathers that's your father in other
[6:02] words watch now whether the gods which
[6:04] your fathers served they were on the
[6:06] other side of the flood are of the Gods
[6:09] of the amorites in whom Land We dwell
[6:12] but as for me in my house we will serve
[6:15] the Lord you may be seated the Lord at
[6:17] his Blessing so think about
[6:21] it choose you this day whom you'll serve
[6:27] right he said if you're not if you're
[6:29] going to serve God serve
[6:31] God if you're not going back to where
[6:35] you come
[6:37] from follow after these gods or go over
[6:40] here and follow after these Gods over
[6:43] here see so if you're not going on with
[6:46] the word just going on
[6:47] back you know where you come
[6:51] from right but he said for me in my
[6:55] house will serve the Lord all right now
[6:58] let's get in into the
[7:01] thought because we covered this
[7:04] morning the scripture of our word it
[7:12] says for us in talking about it that to
[7:15] make
[7:17] sure all right make
[7:21] sure you're calling an
[7:23] election
[7:25] amen other words make sure it's right
[7:30] you know check it
[7:32] out see if what you got is
[7:35] real see if that was God that called
[7:39] you or somebody
[7:43] else make sure you're calling
[7:47] right then make sure your election is
[7:51] right and then how did we cover from the
[7:54] prophet how does God
[7:56] elect well he just chooses this when
[7:58] chooses
[8:00] J now we read this morning over and over
[8:03] and
[8:04] over that he elects by for
[8:09] knowledge cuz he wouldn't everybody be
[8:12] saved that's
[8:14] right well you just don't understand
[8:16] brother Dale it's such a
[8:19] mystery it it it would be a mystery to
[8:23] learn how that God could do things
[8:25] according to what us mankind think he
[8:29] ought to do it it would take two or
[8:32] three Gods to figure out our ways of
[8:34] thinking about what we think it should
[8:37] be but just remember he doesn't do it
[8:41] according to our
[8:44] thinking but he does work according to
[8:47] our desires
[8:50] amen so we desired to be saved he
[8:54] provided away right all right so then
[8:59] then we did we capable as we're going to
[9:01] get in this evening we were capable then
[9:04] of making a
[9:06] choice I know the scriptures says
[9:10] salvation is of the Lord agreed amen
[9:14] that's
[9:15] 1,000% true
[9:17] right but God will not as we'll cover
[9:21] today override your freeo agency that's
[9:25] right amen he will not make you be saved
[9:28] that's right
[9:29] if you don't want to be
[9:31] righten so
[9:33] then in his
[9:37] electing it would have to be according
[9:39] to what you desire right
[9:43] right see it wouldn't be upon just any
[9:45] other some goodness or something but it
[9:49] would be your
[9:51] desires cuz our goodness is not worth
[9:56] anything you wrote around him I gave you
[9:58] a couple this morning where he said
[10:00] Abraham was no different he wasn't a
[10:02] special guy David wasn't no
[10:05] different as a matter of fact you find
[10:07] flaws with all of them
[10:10] amen even flaws of David say that we
[10:13] wouldn't even think about murder
[10:15] adulterous all kind of things that David
[10:20] was but see he had an honest and a
[10:23] contrite
[10:25] heart he desired to serve God
[10:30] but he just didn't have anything
[10:31] inwardly to be able to lead him right
[10:35] that's right so he followed it from the
[10:37] best he could outwardly right and in
[10:40] doing that he tried to do what God told
[10:42] him to
[10:45] do and God never told him to build him a
[10:48] house but he desired to build him
[10:52] one then God had to come down and say
[10:54] now David you there been too much
[10:58] bloodshed and you can't build a
[11:02] house but said solom going to build
[11:05] it David never got all mad and
[11:07] flustrated and boy tell you what I'll
[11:09] just I'll just quit you
[11:13] know I I can't see this I can't follow
[11:17] what brother Dale says or whatever I
[11:19] can't you know go in this I just
[11:22] quit oh go
[11:24] ahead you prove your own
[11:27] predestination that's right but then
[11:29] you'll blame me see because you'll say I
[11:31] can't
[11:33] understand do you pray for
[11:39] understanding and when you don't
[11:41] understand a message I
[11:43] preach you go talk to everybody about it
[11:47] instead of going home sitting down put
[11:49] on the tape listen to it again you don't
[11:51] get it listen to it again if you don't
[11:53] get it listen to it again I ain't got
[11:56] time to listen all this you got time to
[11:59] get on the phone and run your
[12:04] mouth oh
[12:07] okay you got time to talk to somebody
[12:10] else about what you don't agree with
[12:12] that's
[12:14] right whether it be out in the parking
[12:16] lot or whether it be on the telephone
[12:18] and you get home you got time to do all
[12:19] kind of things like that but you don't
[12:21] have time to search out and why don't
[12:23] you come and ask me a
[12:25] question it don't bother me for you to
[12:27] come and say brother Dell I don't I know
[12:29] what in the world you're talking about I
[12:31] said well I'll try my best to explain it
[12:33] again you
[12:35] know well because I want you to see what
[12:37] I'm talking about right amen and I know
[12:40] for ass I can't reveal it to you that's
[12:43] right so don't worry about
[12:44] that I just try to worry about making
[12:47] sure my wording is right and I know
[12:49] humanly
[12:51] speaking it's a problem you know to get
[12:54] your wording
[12:56] right but I also know too when one once
[12:59] we close our
[13:03] mind if we close our mind God cannot
[13:07] open it up right because that would be
[13:10] overriding your free moral
[13:13] agency you must open your
[13:18] mind you remember the prophet saying
[13:20] that one time he's talking about it he
[13:21] said now people will tell you he said
[13:23] we're in a group now he said they'll say
[13:26] blank out your
[13:27] mind
[13:29] you
[13:30] know blank out your mind
[13:34] now he said you do he said you open the
[13:37] channel forever devil there
[13:39] is to come into your
[13:42] mind I never asked you to blank out your
[13:45] mind I ask you to stop just a minute and
[13:48] think about it that's right you
[13:51] know consider what he
[13:55] said so we we've got I had brother Joda
[13:59] make a little
[14:00] drawing and uh if you will give these
[14:03] out we'll give them to you to keep what
[14:06] it is but he's going to put it up on the
[14:08] board for us and I'll just make a couple
[14:10] of comments about
[14:12] it go ahead brother Joe and just put up
[14:14] the a little drawing that we got
[14:17] together and this may not be all
[14:18] together in the way we needed it but
[14:22] it's just something I was thinking about
[14:23] because I want you to to try to remember
[14:27] as I said this morning a l
[14:30] you know now all I've been covering has
[14:33] been on this side of this line and I put
[14:36] this perfectly here as to the split of
[14:39] the
[14:41] mind that God in his mind will know what
[14:43] these are taking about but there's a
[14:46] part about God's mind that's back
[14:48] brother brand will call it Christ
[14:49] mystery God reveal back in the back part
[14:54] of God's
[14:55] mind all right so I split the line where
[14:58] I want to but remember what all we're
[15:01] covering and all of it has been in
[15:05] remember the point
[15:08] what predestination looks back to for
[15:11] knowledge for knowledge looks to
[15:16] Destiny all
[15:19] right election will look
[15:22] back right this morning to for
[15:27] knowledge and this Destiny can be set
[15:31] because of that so I just put a few
[15:33] things on it cuz this is the for
[15:35] knowledge of God in the for knowledge of
[15:37] God you got the lamb
[15:40] slain before the foundation of the
[15:44] world and you got election to deal with
[15:47] calling mind predestination choosing for
[15:51] knowledge for Sol for no Plan of
[15:53] Redemption see the
[15:56] word back there then when we cross over
[15:59] into
[16:01] time of it being lived out then we're
[16:04] going to have to deal with free
[16:08] will we're going to deal with free moral
[16:11] agencies which was covering today you're
[16:14] going to deal with choice or
[16:19] choosing and we put free will twice but
[16:22] I guess what what it needed to
[16:24] be
[16:25] Destiny in time
[16:29] because that's where his Destiny is set
[16:31] for in
[16:33] time receiving eternal life is what we
[16:36] must do in
[16:40] time but see we say oh but we always was
[16:45] eternal well then Jesus didn't have to
[16:47] die to get it to us in time
[16:50] then so
[16:52] you really annihilated your whole Bible
[16:54] all
[16:56] right we deal with justification
[16:58] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[17:00] being glorified uh becoming the word
[17:03] adoption Redemption completed Cedar word
[17:06] and then we'll get on to it Lord willing
[17:08] Wednesday whosoever
[17:12] will see those are just a few things to
[17:15] think
[17:15] about and to just place them to where
[17:18] we're talking because everything I've
[17:20] covered in the five messages up till now
[17:23] is over in this
[17:25] area it is not back in here
[17:30] amen because that is your mind with a
[17:34] forn
[17:36] knowledge and that's just a drawing cuz
[17:38] sometimes people like those things it
[17:41] helps them to hold a
[17:42] point at least I can say this is on this
[17:45] side of the
[17:46] line and then you keep that with you and
[17:49] you look down there and say we know what
[17:51] side of the line is on CU When We Get
[17:53] Over far enough to finish up what we're
[17:56] doing we're going to drop back over into
[18:01] here and cover some
[18:03] things and then we will be dealing
[18:06] with the
[18:08] seed cuz I believe in a predestinated
[18:12] seed I
[18:14] do we're talking a little bit about it
[18:16] last night see I believe that God I
[18:20] believe as I said that Luther he could
[18:24] have taught justification in many uh
[18:27] courses or many you know
[18:31] things and maybe even taught some real
[18:33] good things about
[18:35] it but it wasn't
[18:40] alive it was sowing a seed yeah but one
[18:45] day that seed Was Made
[18:48] Alive and when he did he said the just
[18:51] shall live by faith that was
[18:57] predestinated
[18:59] eternally from
[19:03] God not
[19:07] Luther go brother around says a
[19:10] person doesn't come predestinated
[19:12] eternally from God the person comes into
[19:15] the for knowledge situation that's
[19:19] right he said but the word are seed come
[19:22] predestinated eternally
[19:25] amen so we got a lot to go when we get
[19:28] on the other side don't worry about
[19:30] it but now
[19:34] look we tried to bring out this morning
[19:36] make
[19:37] sure of your calling an
[19:42] election in other words know how you was
[19:48] called what it consist
[19:51] of God calling you to
[19:57] Salvation we
[19:59] see we tried to cover the point
[20:05] that now see you're going to say well no
[20:08] that's not true but listen then
[20:10] everybody in the world is
[20:13] called not because they heard a voice or
[20:16] heard the
[20:19] gospel you what understand
[20:22] me everybody has a desire to serve God
[20:26] that is the calling
[20:29] no no it's a hearing of voice well see
[20:33] then when you make it that way then I'll
[20:35] ask for a raise your hands any me ever
[20:37] heard the voice of God did you hear the
[20:40] voice of God calling you or was it
[20:43] something inwardly that's
[20:46] right that he begin to deal with not an
[20:49] audibly
[20:50] thing so then the hot and tot who knows
[20:53] nothing about God but will be given
[20:56] eternal
[20:57] life
[20:58] because he's a
[21:00] creation he knows as a
[21:03] Creator so he has a call in his
[21:06] life we gave it where Moses had it and
[21:09] brother around said every man has ever
[21:12] bornn in the
[21:14] world had that same
[21:18] doing see God is a great
[21:22] God he can do things the way he wants
[21:26] to but there's one thing he can't
[21:29] do you said brother Dale what do you
[21:32] there's one thing God can't
[21:35] do well there's two or three or maybe
[21:37] more but just one good
[21:40] one he can't go any other way except
[21:43] what his word
[21:45] says so we find it in the word we depend
[21:48] upon the word amen so he can't lie to us
[21:53] right he can't change his mind about his
[21:57] word so we find it in the word we just
[21:59] believe it that's right
[22:02] amen just believe it that's what I said
[22:06] last night trying to
[22:08] explain I saw it in the word God spoke
[22:11] in his word to me and said you'll be
[22:12] there with your Offspring that's
[22:14] scripture you know I believe
[22:16] that right so my children are serving
[22:20] the
[22:22] lord H some of the grandchildren are
[22:25] trying to some of them are
[22:30] not some of the kids didn't want to
[22:32] serve God too much either but they come
[22:35] to
[22:36] it not because they are my
[22:43] children right but because I believe
[22:48] what he said
[22:52] am I can't BL it on anything else but
[22:56] that
[22:59] but other people see their kids are not
[23:01] serving the lord and different things
[23:03] they get upset at you when you say God
[23:05] spoke to me about my family well I can't
[23:08] help
[23:11] it maybe if they have spent some of
[23:13] their time praying about the kids
[23:15] instead of beating them over the head so
[23:17] much it might have changed a lot of
[23:20] things that's
[23:26] right but see God is
[23:30] election he elects by for
[23:37] knowledge we read or looked this morning
[23:40] at e19 of God's covenant these are not
[23:43] on the internet I mean on the screen but
[23:46] e19 of God's covenant with Abraham God
[23:49] by for knowledge could set
[23:54] election paragraph 106 of the adoption
[23:58] election
[24:00] looks back to forn knowledge and
[24:03] predestination on to
[24:06] Destiny E9 of the power of God preach
[24:10] 55
[24:11] predestination looks back to for
[24:13] knowledge and for knowledge to Destiny I
[24:16] don't see why it could be any simpler
[24:19] brought than those
[24:23] thoughts yeah but you just don't you
[24:25] just don't have a revelation of the
[24:27] great thing we have
[24:31] okay just pray for
[24:36] me see God can only then
[24:40] predestinate by what he for
[24:46] knows for
[24:50] saw cuz you look down through time and
[24:52] seen it that's right see then he could
[24:55] write the Bible yes
[24:59] and tell the things what's always been
[25:02] amazing to
[25:03] me is you got a man named
[25:07] Moses and Moses gave the Ten
[25:10] Commandments we talk about
[25:14] that but you know that Moses wrote five
[25:18] books some
[25:20] way he tapped into the mind of
[25:24] God and went back and
[25:26] told of the Garden of Eden
[25:32] yes I mean that that amazes
[25:35] me you say well that was just hand me
[25:38] down thoughts you
[25:41] know you know they do those things in
[25:43] tribes and people and everything just
[25:46] hand down knowledge you know and a lot
[25:49] of them have no typed out records of who
[25:53] was born from who they just set aside
[25:56] certain people to remember
[25:59] and they remember all of the things and
[26:01] the they can tell you who skin folks to
[26:04] who and
[26:06] whatever but see God don't have to do
[26:09] that he just sits there and looks down
[26:11] through it and sees what it
[26:13] is but see what I love about
[26:16] it his forn knowledge would let him see
[26:18] the whole
[26:21] world would you agree with
[26:24] that but see why didn't he just go on
[26:27] vacation
[26:30] in I mean he knows
[26:34] it what did he just pull back and say
[26:37] y'all fight it out I'll meet you at the
[26:38] end of the
[26:41] road and that Prophet said that day he
[26:44] said God came
[26:47] down and busied himself with the
[26:50] children of Israel in all of their
[26:53] troubles and that I just
[26:56] rejoiced but I thought if he done that
[26:58] to
[26:59] them what will he do for you and
[27:03] I he said I'll never leave you nor
[27:07] forsake
[27:09] you I'll be with you always he didn't
[27:12] say always
[27:15] because sometimes we ramble around and
[27:18] fall over into stump holes that he
[27:20] wouldn't be in that's right so he said
[27:23] I'll be with you always I'll never leave
[27:26] you yes right not always but I'll never
[27:29] leave you cuz sometimes he has to pull
[27:31] back his presence amen Prophet said but
[27:34] don't worry about it he ain't too far
[27:36] and said he's waiting on you to call him
[27:38] back
[27:40] yes we call it sitting out on a limb you
[27:43] know we're doing
[27:44] whatever all right but now
[27:48] listen God then predestinate
[27:52] by his looking down through
[27:56] time
[27:59] and then we
[28:00] can look at it and seeing that we have a
[28:05] choice we have a
[28:09] choice choose you this day whom you'll
[28:12] serve we have a
[28:15] choice all right then by having a or
[28:19] being able to make a
[28:24] choice he would
[28:26] predestinate
[28:28] by what he
[28:29] foresaw
[28:32] right not even just what he
[28:38] fornew that would seem to put a point of
[28:40] just looking out but for Saul would mean
[28:44] that he's right here
[28:47] right if you think God doesn't deal that
[28:52] way I'll remind
[28:54] you like I was saying this morning about
[28:57] let me get this I forget it okay
[28:59] somebody raise your hand off come back
[29:00] to the
[29:03] point he
[29:07] foresaw
[29:09] everything he told brother Brandon one
[29:11] day brother brand said I think I'll just
[29:14] go out here and become a Hermit I'll go
[29:16] up in the mountains I'll become a uh a
[29:19] prophet and just stomp out with the
[29:21] message you remember what he told
[29:24] him he said turn around and look
[29:28] he said you see that garbage pile
[29:33] burning
[29:34] right remember he saw was who was it bro
[29:37] or who the different ones you
[29:40] know and he
[29:42] said you go ahead and take your choice
[29:45] and that's where you'll
[29:48] be and you realize that God was laying
[29:51] before him what he would
[29:53] do if he went either
[29:56] way
[29:58] then don't life at me so much about
[30:00] thinking that he would know who I would
[30:02] marry and how many kids we'd have but he
[30:05] knew who I would marry if I didn't marry
[30:07] that one that's
[30:11] right he could look down through there
[30:14] and see as we read in the
[30:17] scriptures we could go this way but said
[30:21] if we go that way you're going to fall
[30:23] for that so we're going to go this way
[30:26] he knows which way we're going amen
[30:30] right but we have a choice in life yes
[30:37] now it's what he
[30:41] fora and he forsaw us as Desiring to be
[30:49] saved all right then he would have it
[30:51] ready for
[30:53] us amen all
[30:55] right see then we start dealing
[30:59] with a little point of freem moral
[31:05] agency and some of the preachers in the
[31:08] message especially back in the
[31:11] 70s they used to preach that freem moral
[31:13] agency was based upon our only far the
[31:17] foolish virgins and
[31:19] things but the bride was
[31:24] predetermined
[31:26] yeah all right but I can't see it that
[31:29] way because of the way the prophet says
[31:32] things what is free moral
[31:39] agency it means
[31:43] that things are laid out in front of
[31:47] you and you need you can make a choice
[31:51] amen that's right of which way you want
[31:54] to
[31:56] go
[31:59] that's how simple free moral agency is
[32:01] it's not a stamping of something right
[32:05] making this is the only way it can
[32:07] be it means you have a choice right
[32:11] right you can
[32:15] decide make your calling an election
[32:20] sure well because you have something to
[32:23] do with it that's right amen God's not
[32:26] going to make you saved that's right or
[32:28] he's not going to make you be
[32:30] lost he's going to leave the choice to
[32:33] you but if he's God then he knew the
[32:36] choice that's
[32:38] right that shouldn't be any problem amen
[32:42] and when we finish all of this
[32:45] up and we get dire then we'll be happy
[32:48] about what we see yes I'm happy about
[32:50] what I see now but all right so let's
[32:54] deal a little bit about free moral
[32:56] agency
[32:59] let's watch and start with the
[33:02] things something the prophet had to say
[33:04] about three more agency go ahead to
[33:05] number one this is taken from paragraph
[33:09] 154 through
[33:12] 157 of marriage and divorce preached in
[33:16] uh
[33:17] 65221 the morning
[33:20] service he could not be just and make a
[33:23] man to
[33:25] fall he had to put him
[33:28] on
[33:30] equal
[33:37] basis
[33:39] right he had to put him on equal basis
[33:43] of free moral agency to make his own
[33:47] choice yes but knowing he could fault
[33:49] and he could be a savior he could do
[33:51] that but look equal
[33:55] basis
[34:00] equal basis means it's you
[34:05] know God put it into your lap for you to
[34:08] decide amen that's right that's right I
[34:11] like the way the prophet said it he said
[34:12] I don't vote he said I voted for God or
[34:16] something like this and he said the
[34:18] devil voted against me no Jesus voted
[34:21] for me the devil voted against me he
[34:23] said I cast my lot with Jesus he said I
[34:26] don't vot more am amen you see it puts
[34:31] us on an equal basis
[34:35] right you ever thought about an equal
[34:38] basis what would you be talking
[34:43] about God gave
[34:48] us he made the way he paid the price yes
[34:52] but he doesn't make us take it that's
[34:54] right amen so he left it to be whatever
[34:57] we choose okay that's
[35:00] equal not equal with God not making us
[35:05] equal that way yes but making us as we
[35:08] could choose that's right amen an equal
[35:12] basis
[35:14] right think about
[35:19] it he explains coming down he said but
[35:23] if he takes and loses it just in order
[35:26] to say that then he isn't just to his
[35:32] judgment isn't Justice to his
[35:35] judgment he couldn't send a man to hell
[35:38] and be just he is kind gentle true
[35:42] honest he's a great judge
[35:45] see all
[35:47] right see would be working against
[35:51] himself so we had to put man put a man
[35:55] out here and make him on free moral
[35:58] agency so he would knowing would fall
[36:03] and the man in his own image how could
[36:06] he fall now you see the Daylights that
[36:08] he comes up and shows you the what that
[36:10] the woman wasn't in the original
[36:12] creation and not being that then it
[36:14] started to
[36:16] fall but a free moral
[36:21] agency see if you look at God get to the
[36:25] point of the basis
[36:28] that he puts you
[36:31] on if he overrides in any
[36:34] way your
[36:37] thoughts to make you be saved what has
[36:39] he
[36:43] done all right we've read that one right
[36:46] brother Dick's quoting it he put you in
[36:48] a pipe pushed you through the other end
[36:50] said I predestinated him that's
[36:53] right but if he puts you on an equal
[36:56] basis
[37:00] mhm that means Satan doesn't have the
[37:05] majority right right even though we did
[37:08] belong to him that's right
[37:12] amen so he's not ruling it he put us on
[37:15] an equal basis with him into what the
[37:19] ability to choose that's right amen now
[37:22] that's the greatest thing if you don't
[37:24] get nothing this afternoon
[37:27] you get one
[37:28] point your ability to
[37:32] choose is a wonderful thing
[37:37] amen and you can't blame nobody else
[37:40] that's right
[37:42] amen because you
[37:45] chose you chose the way you wanted to go
[37:50] amen God didn't make you choose a
[37:54] wife he gave you an opportunity unity
[37:57] and you could
[37:59] choose right and make you choose a job
[38:04] that's right it gives you an opportunity
[38:05] you choose
[38:07] right choice is a wonderful thing that's
[38:11] right amen and brother forny said
[38:13] Wednesday night I get tick at him
[38:15] because he's always cutting us pretty
[38:16] heavy he know most of us work General
[38:19] Motors you on on on chevret basis and
[38:22] you remember what he said he said
[38:23] driving a
[38:25] Ford
[38:27] but see if it wasn't the basis of that
[38:31] why wouldn't gentle Motors Ford and all
[38:32] of them come up with
[38:33] a she before the
[38:37] Cadillac and everybody have the same
[38:41] car hey some of them out there is so
[38:44] ugly I can't even stand look at them and
[38:47] I see some of them little bitt ones I
[38:49] think of myself going down the
[38:52] road if I raise up my head hits the top
[38:55] if I move my foot it's going out into
[38:57] the to the motor you
[39:00] know like Bob's got one and then even
[39:03] got one it's got an electric deals
[39:09] and but you see we're based on Choice
[39:12] that's the kind of home you live the
[39:15] kind of car you drive the kind of
[39:17] clothes you
[39:19] wire wouldn't it be something sisters if
[39:21] everybody wore the
[39:25] same
[39:27] a lot of you ain't old enough to
[39:28] remember this but brother how
[39:31] is all the women in our community wore
[39:34] the same color
[39:38] dress that was made different
[39:42] maybe same material same color you know
[39:46] why because they sent chicken feed out
[39:49] to the chicken
[39:51] houses in
[39:53] sacks my wife used to take them and make
[39:55] clothes out of them that was even after
[39:59] we
[40:00] married you were you could but
[40:03] everybody Ain it something you sisters
[40:06] you you just get so mad you go and you
[40:08] shop and you buy a
[40:10] dress nobody ain't got one
[40:16] these you put the thing on you go to
[40:18] town there goes one there goes another
[40:21] one there goes another they all shopped
[40:23] at
[40:24] hamricks you know
[40:26] see
[40:28] Choice that's a wonderful
[40:33] thing because we can choose what we want
[40:36] that's
[40:38] right free moral agency lays within our
[40:42] hands the right to choose right amen
[40:46] right all right is that a good
[40:48] definition of it yes look what he says
[40:51] in pray of
[40:53] transformation 1965 10:31
[40:57] the morning
[40:59] service he just let them out there on
[41:02] free moral
[41:04] agency let them act he couldn't
[41:08] make them do it and still then still be
[41:13] just but he could put them equal with
[41:20] him he didn't mind saying
[41:23] it and free moral agency then let them
[41:27] do
[41:28] itel but he knew what they would
[41:34] do by man having a
[41:38] choice doesn't make him a robot that's
[41:44] right it makes him a human
[41:49] being and he has a
[41:52] choice that choice is called free moral
[41:56] a agency that's
[41:59] right that you can choose what you
[42:01] desire yes got a lot of them so let's
[42:04] read
[42:05] fast paragraph 4950
[42:08] of as God change his
[42:12] mind 65
[42:15] 427 now to be a savior there has to be
[42:18] something lost and God cannot purposely
[42:22] lose some lose anything and then redeem
[42:25] it
[42:26] it wouldn't be becoming of his Holiness
[42:29] and his great
[42:30] judgment but he put man on freem moral
[42:33] agency knowing that man would
[42:37] fall and in that
[42:39] then he
[42:41] became man himself in order to redeem
[42:45] back man that fell that's right amen he
[42:49] gave you Choice yes we have that choice
[42:52] to make all right leadership
[42:57] Matthew
[42:58] 65207 paragraph
[43:03] 153 number five
[43:05] brother sometime in
[43:08] life we have to confront the thing just
[43:11] like this young man did because you're a
[43:15] mortal being and you are given the the
[43:18] are given the opportunity to
[43:21] choose you have a choice God made it so
[43:25] you can choose
[43:26] M if he put Adam and Eve on freeor
[43:29] agency so they could
[43:32] choose and then they made the wrong
[43:35] choice and see he can do more he can do
[43:39] no more to you than he did to
[43:44] them so it looks like free moral agen is
[43:46] dealing with us he's got to put you the
[43:49] same thing so you can choose or reject
[43:53] you have a
[43:54] choice right next
[43:58] one Revelation 4 part 3
[44:02] 6118 paragraph 23 or yeah paragraph
[44:06] 231 how did he St
[44:12] will and see we can take a topic off of
[44:14] self-will or free more agency but it's
[44:16] the same
[44:18] thing why will you call that self-will
[44:22] brother
[44:23] randam because it puts a man and a woman
[44:26] back again just like Adam and Eve at the
[44:29] Garden of
[44:30] Eden on what the two trees self-will
[44:34] this one is death this one is life self-
[44:36] will and more free more agency God
[44:40] placed the first man Adam and Eve right
[44:42] here on Freemore agency he places you
[44:46] the same place and the only way that you
[44:48] can get this
[44:49] thing uh fixed is in here is your own
[44:55] self-will
[44:57] Hallelujah your self- will you have to
[45:01] will to do God's will you have to get
[45:04] rid of your own will to let God's will
[45:07] come in for this is the only channel
[45:09] that leads to the heart all right
[45:15] next the Messiah
[45:18] 1961
[45:20] e13
[45:23] 117 then on the inside he has only one
[45:27] gate one entrance to go into the sh sh
[45:30] Glory where God can enter into him and
[45:32] take over in the control tower don't now
[45:35] he's talking about Redemption right
[45:37] saving and that way is through
[45:42] self-will
[45:44] okay whether you will to or not that's
[45:48] up to you but that's the only Avenue
[45:51] that's open to the man that God can come
[45:54] into his heart is by self will puts him
[45:57] right back like Adam and Eve on free
[45:59] moral agency again you can choose right
[46:02] or wrong either one you want to self
[46:08] will it doesn't seem that we've read
[46:12] anything that God is just making you do
[46:16] what you're
[46:19] doing everything's on self-will that's
[46:22] right fre moral agency all
[46:28] right next is
[46:30] adoption 196
[46:37] 518 he saw that Luther would do
[46:41] that oh how many knows he's
[46:47] infinite come on I'm getting myself not
[46:50] them they're okay he saw that Luther
[46:52] would do that if he created this he put
[46:56] them Luc Lucifer he saw that Lucifer
[46:59] would do that if he created this he put
[47:02] them on a free moral agency words he saw
[47:05] Luther what he would do if the mankind
[47:08] is put on free more agency all right
[47:10] that
[47:11] basis and you're still there that's
[47:14] right the tree of right and wrong says
[47:16] before every one of us you make your
[47:18] choice and Lucifer was the first one to
[47:21] take the wrong road and he began to draw
[47:24] after him
[47:26] H
[47:28] hoggish trying take all for himself
[47:32] trying to override somebody else and
[47:34] that's where it started and listen to
[47:36] this that's where sin began God In His
[47:40] Infinite mind saw that and saw the only
[47:43] way so he's explaining the point of that
[47:45] is what the way Lucifer gets to you and
[47:50] I is true self will that's right
[47:54] amen that's right he can't bother you if
[47:58] you don't open the door that's
[48:01] right even when your property of
[48:05] his you know what I mean before he was
[48:07] born again yes your property of the
[48:10] devil yes and you can
[48:13] still decide what you want to do and not
[48:15] want to do that's right amen I did I
[48:19] said I wouldn't going to drink I
[48:23] didn't I didn't not to I'm a Christian
[48:26] to stop
[48:28] drinking I didn't want to
[48:33] drink see Satan couldn't get that on
[48:36] me I didn't care nothing about
[48:39] smoking he just didn't have much far me
[48:42] sure didn't like chewing
[48:44] tobacco thought I was doing pretty good
[48:46] one time I got
[48:47] sick I decided right then I didn't need
[48:50] that
[48:53] anymore so then s we will is a lot to do
[48:56] with you free moral agency is a lot to
[48:59] do with a human being that's
[49:02] true because you and I are sitting just
[49:04] like Adam and Eve
[49:08] Amen on a free moral
[49:10] agency you can go to church yes or you
[49:14] can stay at
[49:17] home you can serve God or not serve
[49:22] him you make your own choice amen
[49:27] right cuz he'll give you plenty of
[49:29] excuses yes to not go to church
[49:33] yes right
[49:36] right but I've always tried to explain
[49:39] something about us
[49:40] humans that shows how dumb we are true
[49:46] that's you're feeling down and out yes
[49:49] and nobody loves
[49:52] you and you say I just won't go to
[49:54] church today
[49:57] nobody wants me there
[49:59] anyway and the devil just cries on your
[50:02] shoulders back you're right honey you're
[50:05] right you you you know nobody don't want
[50:08] you
[50:12] there set your
[50:15] clock service starts at
[50:18] 10: and up until 10 the devil is really
[50:22] on your side right right
[50:26] he gave you every excuse in the world
[50:28] you don't feel good you don't this you
[50:31] don't
[50:34] that but 5 minutes after 10 that's
[50:38] right he changes his
[50:41] tactics and he says see
[50:44] there you proved you ain't
[50:48] nothing
[50:50] right am I
[50:53] right he gets off of giving you excuses
[50:56] for not going and starts condemning you
[50:59] because you didn't go right
[51:03] amen then you might as well just get up
[51:05] and go and forget it whether anybody
[51:08] likes you or
[51:10] not way tells that story about the fell
[51:13] saying to his mama you know or said I'm
[51:17] not going to church today then people
[51:18] don't want
[51:19] me you know they just don't love me she
[51:23] said but you got to go so well tell me
[51:24] why I got to go
[51:25] because you the
[51:31] pastor I'm human

[53:24] for the word
[53:26] I thought we ate to
[53:28] live right physically don't you eat to
[53:31] live a lot of people live to eat but and
[53:35] it shows

[53:49] amen
[53:52] okay go on to the next one what are we
[53:54] on
[53:58] we're about number
[54:00] nine which is what would you out to see
[54:04] 59 10:01 God doesn't send you to hell
[54:08] for being a
[54:10] sinner God sends you to hell because you
[54:13] won't repent and take Christ as your
[54:15] savior you refuse to take the right Road
[54:18] you send yourself to torment you send
[54:21] your own soul to Eternal destination
[54:24] upon the free moral agency of your own
[54:30] convictions God does not send anyone to
[54:33] hell he never did he never will men send
[54:37] themselves to hell because they refuse
[54:39] to accept the way of Salvation God isn't
[54:42] he's
[54:43] longsuffering he doesn't want any to
[54:45] perish never wanted it but men rather
[54:48] walk in
[54:50] darkness and to walk in
[54:53] light what about it
[54:56] free moral
[55:01] agency look at the next one number 10
[55:04] taken from the faith of
[55:06] Abraham 56 or
[55:09] 55 11:18 paragraph are
[55:13] 18 and in the book of Ephesians the
[55:16] first chapter and about the fifth verse
[55:18] Paul stresses the word predestination us
[55:20] to the adoption of sons now that doesn't
[55:24] mean that God just puts you in a little
[55:26] Channel and runs you
[55:29] through and you can't help if you how
[55:33] you go when you you would be no reward
[55:38] but God gives you the free moral agency
[55:41] to make your own
[55:43] choice God will keep his believer
[55:47] though he gives you that to make your
[55:49] choice go ahead next
[55:54] one
[55:56] 5 blind
[55:57] bmus
[56:00] 57301 these people who are standing here
[56:03] at the altar
[56:04] tonight are those who that you have
[56:08] brought up Out of the Dust of the earth
[56:11] you put a spirit in
[56:14] them a spirit of free moral
[56:21] agency to make a choice to receive life
[56:25] life or refuse life you ever heard him
[56:28] say you can't raise your hand without a
[56:31] spirit making you do it that's right
[56:33] have you ever noticed he said if you
[56:35] step out of that aisle and head this
[56:39] way the biggest portion of your healing
[56:42] is already taken place the minute you
[56:44] step out
[56:46] that's why because you made a choice if
[56:50] not why come up here and be prayed for
[56:52] if you're not going to believe it I mean
[56:53] if you're not going to believe it stay
[56:54] back back
[56:55] there you're wasting our time
[56:59] amen but if you believe it come here and
[57:02] I believe it then we all believe it all
[57:05] right so what does he
[57:07] say look at the next
[57:11] one why is is that so many Christians
[57:13] find it so in the title of that is
[57:16] really why it says so many find it hard
[57:19] to live the Christian Life H 5733
[57:25] how do he do it Out of the Dust of the
[57:27] earth and look and if it taken the Holy
[57:30] Spirit to brood me from the Earth to
[57:32] Call Me Out of the Dust of the earth now
[57:34] I'm based on the basis of free moral
[57:36] agency to receive it or to turn it down
[57:39] if you want life if want life I can have
[57:43] it if I want to refuse it I'm a free
[57:46] moral
[57:47] agent I can take the devil
[57:50] then but if I want God I can take God
[57:54] and and that's before every person that
[57:56] ever come on the earth for every
[58:00] person that ever come on the
[58:02] earth is based on free moral agency yes
[58:06] right to choose or reject
[58:10] yes why some people can't keep the
[58:12] victory
[58:14] 57
[58:17] 324 now man's on the basis of freem
[58:20] Moral freem Moral
[58:22] agency and he cannot God God could not
[58:25] take a man and say now I'm going to make
[58:28] you do this I'm going to make you be to
[58:31] be a lost
[58:32] man I'm going to make you be a saved
[58:36] man that wouldn't be the nature of God
[58:39] no he's not willing that any should
[58:42] perish but he wants all to
[58:45] repent but if he was being infinite as
[58:48] he is he knows from the beginning who
[58:50] would perish and who would not perish
[58:53] because he knew what would be now he's
[58:56] not willing that it would be that that
[58:58] way see he's not willing that it would
[59:01] be that way he wants all to come back to
[59:05] him but he knows who will and who won't
[59:08] right so therefore he could by four
[59:12] knowledge he can make everything work
[59:16] right according to his plan by for
[59:20] knowledge that's right make it according
[59:22] to his plan all right go within
[59:26] that number
[59:28] 14 it's adoption
[59:31] 196
[59:33] 522 and inside of him was an attribute
[59:37] of
[59:38] Savior how could one of those creatures
[59:40] when there was no sin or no thoughts of
[59:42] sin how could one of them be lost it
[59:45] couldn't be so there had to be something
[59:47] made that could be
[59:49] lost so he could be a savior inside of
[59:52] him was a Healer do you believe that
[59:54] he's a savior
[59:55] here you believe it he's a Healer well
[59:58] what if there wasn't nothing to save or
[1:00:00] healed see there had to be something
[1:00:02] made that way and never made it that
[1:00:06] way but he put man on free moral
[1:00:09] agency if you take this and live if you
[1:00:12] take that you'll die and every man that
[1:00:15] comes into the world is still set with
[1:00:17] the same same thing God by his for
[1:00:20] knowledge knew who would and who would
[1:00:23] not
[1:00:25] there was no problem right
[1:00:29] right see he couldn't make us be
[1:00:33] lost he puts us on a basis of freeo
[1:00:37] agency amen that's
[1:00:40] right to make a choice if you go home
[1:00:44] just run it in your
[1:00:47] computer free moral agency just run it
[1:00:50] in see how many there are I just chose a
[1:00:53] few you stand of the greatest battle
[1:00:55] ever fought he's talking about there's
[1:00:56] only one
[1:00:57] Avenue that God can come down and that's
[1:01:01] by the way of free moral
[1:01:05] agency God can't come in your soul
[1:01:08] except by free moral
[1:01:13] ageny CU if he did he'd be making you be
[1:01:16] saved right right that's right amen he's
[1:01:20] not going to make you be saved that's
[1:01:23] right the choice is ours so if it's
[1:01:27] going to come into us it's going to have
[1:01:28] to be on free moral
[1:01:35] agency God's children are on free moral
[1:01:39] agency this stature of a perfect
[1:01:43] man is a base of free moral
[1:01:47] agency because we
[1:01:49] can seek after
[1:01:52] God and try to see these things or we
[1:01:56] can just Skip Along halfhazard and not
[1:01:59] worry about
[1:02:01] it it's free moral
[1:02:05] agency we decide what we're going to
[1:02:10] do for imortal
[1:02:14] agency gives us a choice don't override
[1:02:18] the choice makes us just like Adam and
[1:02:22] Eve three more l
[1:02:27] agency gives a self
[1:02:31] will and a message called a prisoner
[1:02:35] number 19 637
[1:02:38] 717 and we're all born a free moral
[1:02:41] agent to make any cision
[1:02:44] decision that we wish
[1:02:49] to God justly does that because he must
[1:02:53] put every man on the same basis or he
[1:02:56] put the wrong man he put the first man
[1:03:00] on the wrong
[1:03:01] basis so if Adam and Eve was free moreal
[1:03:04] agency you and I got to be free moreal
[1:03:07] agency right or he put them on the wrong
[1:03:10] choice or us on the wrong
[1:03:13] choice so why can't
[1:03:17] we choose what we
[1:03:23] desire
[1:03:28] if God is working according to our
[1:03:32] desires and if we desire to learn of him
[1:03:36] we can learn of him that's true
[1:03:41] amen if we desire not to study pray and
[1:03:46] seek
[1:03:49] God I'm not saying you're
[1:03:52] lost I'm not I'm saying you're in
[1:03:55] dangerous territory but not going to say
[1:03:57] you're
[1:04:01] lost I think what we need to do is
[1:04:04] consider all the things that God has
[1:04:08] done for us
[1:04:13] right I like the statement the prophet
[1:04:15] said I don't live for God to try to keep
[1:04:19] from going to
[1:04:22] hell right
[1:04:27] I don't live for God just to keep from
[1:04:28] going to
[1:04:34] hell because if he cast me into hell
[1:04:36] thinking the way I am I'd live for him
[1:04:38] die Satan is your have
[1:04:42] problems we know it ain't going to
[1:04:44] happen but it's a good point right
[1:04:47] right so choose this day who you'll
[1:04:50] serve
[1:04:52] Amen brother de chose a long time ago
[1:04:55] all right then let's make our calling
[1:04:57] and election
[1:05:01] sure and let's see and let's get away
[1:05:05] from those doctrines and ideas of the
[1:05:07] people of the message that well I always
[1:05:10] was eternal
[1:05:12] so yeah are you saying it don't matter
[1:05:14] what you do or don't
[1:05:19] do Heaven Help a peanut brain person
[1:05:23] that would think that
[1:05:26] way the closer I get to
[1:05:29] God the more conscious I become of
[1:05:32] myself that's
[1:05:33] right that's the way it should be that's
[1:05:39] right the more conscious I become of my
[1:05:44] walk sure I know I'm a human being never
[1:05:49] claim to be nothing
[1:05:51] else you see what you get in me because
[1:05:56] I don't
[1:05:57] change I just walk right on but my
[1:06:01] desire is to serve God am
[1:06:06] amen and if I even miss the Rapture the
[1:06:09] change part of got to go by the grave
[1:06:10] that's no problem with
[1:06:13] me I'd sure love to be there cuz I
[1:06:15] fought it out down through 40 something
[1:06:17] years with it I I want to be there don't
[1:06:20] you amen amen sir but I know if he don't
[1:06:22] hurry it up I'm not going
[1:06:25] I got that much
[1:06:27] sense but I know he can fulfill it
[1:06:30] listening to tape the other day where he
[1:06:32] said the biggest portion of the Old
[1:06:35] Testament was fulfilled in the last I
[1:06:38] believe he said 6 hours of
[1:06:42] Calvary fulfilled all those scriptures
[1:06:45] of David singing in the
[1:06:47] spirit fulfilled all of those
[1:06:50] prophecies what it was saying amen
[1:06:55] so he could fulfill it in six hours and
[1:06:57] me and you could he that's right
[1:06:59] amen but what's our choice
[1:07:06] today yeah but Brother D I have to give
[1:07:08] up so much to become a Christian as to
[1:07:11] the young
[1:07:17] people would you be giving up anything

[1:08:52] chair
[1:08:56] and they walk in well doc I got this and

[1:09:01] wonder if I got
[1:09:02] out doctors nowadays I I can make a good
[1:09:06] doctor you know what doctors do now they
[1:09:08] let you treat your own
[1:09:10] self right come on right ask you what do
[1:09:14] you think about well I think it's is I
[1:09:16] think that he okay I'll WR your pill for
[1:09:18] that
[1:09:20] right you thought hey we got nurses
[1:09:23] right all kind of nurses in
[1:09:28] here everybody just chooses their own
[1:09:31] medicine their own
[1:09:35] doings
[1:09:38] right but why can't we be
[1:09:41] happy and
[1:09:43] joyous and enjoy
[1:09:47] life you
[1:09:50] know I enjoyed working when I was at
[1:09:53] General the
[1:09:56] motors I enjoyed
[1:09:59] it of course we had a different set up
[1:10:01] the most of you had we had about seven
[1:10:04] guys that believe the same
[1:10:06] message working within just a little bit
[1:10:09] of each other sometimes shoulder to-
[1:10:10] shoulder all
[1:10:12] day so it wasn't a hum drum but they can
[1:10:16] tell
[1:10:19] you that I'm no different here than I
[1:10:21] was down there that's right you
[1:10:27] know why can't we be happy and joyous
[1:10:30] about what we
[1:10:34] see because if it's all in God is
[1:10:36] pre-stamped then I'd be very
[1:10:42] sad CU I wouldn't have anything to do
[1:10:44] with
[1:10:46] it you know I just asking what do you
[1:10:50] want me to do
[1:10:52] next
[1:10:55] but instead of that I just go through
[1:10:57] life and you know every once in a while
[1:10:59] he contacts me and comes by just enough
[1:11:02] to let you know he's
[1:11:07] there but he's never away from you
[1:11:10] that's
[1:11:14] right but yet you got a
[1:11:22] choice choose you this day whom you
[1:11:25] serve had to put us on equal
[1:11:31] bases and how was we explain an equal
[1:11:34] basis put me to word now listen to the
[1:11:39] wording but I don't have anything else
[1:11:42] he made you a
[1:11:47] God why because he made you with a
[1:11:49] choice that's right
[1:11:52] right right
[1:11:54] right come on did the prophet say little
[1:11:57] Gods little amateur
[1:11:59] Gods it gave you a CH a choice to
[1:12:05] make me you equaling with him on that
[1:12:08] choice cuz he can't override
[1:12:12] it I hope you understand that
[1:12:15] point he can't make you be saved if you
[1:12:17] don't want to be but he can't make you
[1:12:19] be lost if you don't want to be
[1:12:22] amen
[1:12:24] well no God no God can't make you be
[1:12:26] lost that's right he'd be breaking his
[1:12:28] word
[1:12:32] amen but he can't make you be saved
[1:12:36] either but he looks down and sees you
[1:12:38] make a choice to be saved
[1:12:41] yes and according to my Bible all Heaven
[1:12:46] starts rejoicing over one repentant
[1:12:50] sinner is that according to the
[1:12:51] scripture yes that's
[1:12:55] right free moral
[1:12:57] agency free will self
[1:13:01] will to choose
[1:13:09] yes don't blame the devil so much
[1:13:15] either
[1:13:16] right the devil made me do it now the
[1:13:19] prophet
[1:13:21] said the Devil Couldn't get into
[1:13:24] you he said you go out to him that's
[1:13:30] true I don't blame the devil for
[1:13:33] everything I've done wrong in my life
[1:13:35] that's
[1:13:38] right I blame myself
[1:13:43] amen I don't blame you or my mama my
[1:13:47] daddy or
[1:13:49] whatever well you act like your daddy I
[1:13:52] don't know I never was around my daddy
[1:13:55] so I can't say
[1:13:57] that I was about four when he
[1:14:01] died do you see what I'm talking about
[1:14:03] free moral agency yes gives you the
[1:14:07] right to choose yes what you want to be
[1:14:11] and God acts according to your
[1:14:16] choice well
[1:14:18] then I like to put these little thoughts
[1:14:21] in you know then is my destiny
[1:14:32] stamped is my destiny stamped and it's
[1:14:34] got to be right there that wall that's
[1:14:37] as far as I can go that's my
[1:14:44] destiny see now we want to try to make
[1:14:46] God kind of
[1:14:51] guilty but does he set the
[1:14:54] stamp or is this his for knowledge that
[1:14:58] we are
[1:15:03] living which one is
[1:15:08] it run in there sometimes you thought I
[1:15:10] was saying too much the other day about
[1:15:12] it but run in the prophet's message
[1:15:15] sometime and just run
[1:15:19] in does God change his mind
[1:15:24] are changing his
[1:15:27] mind just run it in your computer and
[1:15:29] read
[1:15:32] it you're sick you have a disease you
[1:15:36] have this that or the
[1:15:41] other as far as natural life is
[1:15:43] concerned you're doomed and
[1:15:45] dead right right cuz ain't nothing they
[1:15:48] can do that's
[1:15:50] right and if they do give you something
[1:15:52] for this one is going to kill you on the
[1:15:53] other side okay right that's right amen
[1:15:57] this may prong you a little
[1:16:02] while but is this is it stamped as a got
[1:16:05] to be
[1:16:10] thing why can't you believe this is what
[1:16:12] he saw and if this is what he
[1:16:15] saw the choices I make that's
[1:16:21] right could deter
[1:16:23] a
[1:16:27] lot we go by accident sometimes and we
[1:16:30] think well that was just meant to
[1:16:37] be but is
[1:16:40] it well I can't help being sick so I'm
[1:16:43] sick God knew I'd be
[1:16:48] sick right is that the way we
[1:16:52] think
[1:16:54] why not think
[1:16:56] about I'm dying but he changed it to
[1:17:01] where I could live that's right
[1:17:03] amen and that doesn't do away with his
[1:17:05] for knowledge that's
[1:17:07] right that's
[1:17:11] right but it sets us in a place if you
[1:17:13] caught what I'm talking about this
[1:17:15] morning this afternoon the main two
[1:17:17] things is
[1:17:19] what make your calling an election sure
[1:17:22] make your choice
[1:17:23] sure that's right amen
[1:17:26] MH choose you this day who you'll serve
[1:17:29] don't wait till tomorrow well I'll serve
[1:17:32] him but I'm going to run into the wall
[1:17:33] and that's it you know that's a
[1:17:40] robot you're sick you say well I'm
[1:17:46] sick well I guess I'll die with this you
[1:17:52] will
[1:17:57] I like brother Gary's
[1:18:00] daddy granddaddy Atkins I liked his
[1:18:03] way he might not have been a
[1:18:06] great uh religious Supernatural
[1:18:09] something maybe didn't follow this
[1:18:16] message but he had a point about him I
[1:18:21] liked he said they told him when he
[1:18:24] entered Medical School the first
[1:18:28] thing they said If You w't Hinder your
[1:18:32] patience was it
[1:18:34] 80% 50 or 80 85 85 or something it was
[1:18:40] he said if you don't hinder your
[1:18:42] patience 85% of them is going to going
[1:18:46] to live get well on or get
[1:18:49] well
[1:18:50] right that's a good point he said I
[1:18:53] never operate until I
[1:18:58] pray see he believed in
[1:19:02] prayer but he believed in having a
[1:19:04] positive
[1:19:07] attitude that's what I loved about him a
[1:19:09] positive
[1:19:13] attitude I don't mean wrong about it cuz
[1:19:15] Gary was making a living about it but he
[1:19:18] had a choice to go in a line to follow
[1:19:19] his daddy and make big money but he
[1:19:22] didn't choose to do
[1:19:24] that and his daddy would
[1:19:26] say Gary just
[1:19:30] be whatever you're going to be just be
[1:19:34] good at
[1:19:37] it that's
[1:19:39] wonderful choosing what we are that's
[1:19:42] just natural life
[1:19:45] amen go home this evening sit down in
[1:19:48] the
[1:19:48] chair I don't want to get
[1:19:51] up
[1:19:55] what's going to
[1:19:57] happen you ain't going to get
[1:20:00] up if you sat that long you ain't going
[1:20:02] to get up somebody's going to help you
[1:20:06] get
[1:20:08] up my wife gets on to me all time why
[1:20:11] don't you sit down I
[1:20:16] can't I'm up doing
[1:20:19] something because if I sit down I just
[1:20:21] don't want to get to do I don't want to
[1:20:22] do
[1:20:24] nothing so give me a hammer and a rock
[1:20:27] I'll beat on
[1:20:31] it I'll drive a nail and pull it back
[1:20:35] out why because I want to be doing
[1:20:39] something if I can be that in the
[1:20:41] natural what about in the
[1:20:45] spiritual I want you and I to get home
[1:20:47] with being what God wants us to
[1:20:50] be we're talking about it like not when
[1:20:53] brother Brandon said will the bride have
[1:20:56] a Ministry he said sure she consists of
[1:20:59] Apostles prophets of angelist pastors
[1:21:01] and teacher now they ask him would she
[1:21:02] have a Ministry he said she
[1:21:05] consist is what I told him last night
[1:21:08] you already get tap listen to
[1:21:10] it you make me what I
[1:21:17] am you pull out of me what you want to
[1:21:20] hear that's right
[1:21:23] and you can pull false Doctrine out of
[1:21:26] people
[1:21:31] too that's whatever false Doctrine does
[1:21:34] false Doctrine does start with a
[1:21:35] preacher preaching false Doctrine starts
[1:21:37] with the
[1:21:38] people Desiring the wrong Doctrine and
[1:21:41] they pull the preacher into
[1:21:43] being you want to St all afternoon talk
[1:21:46] about it the people had to be crying
[1:21:49] before Moses went down into Egypt right
[1:21:54] right but when he got down there or rose
[1:21:57] up the first
[1:21:59] time they didn't want
[1:22:03] him right you going to kill us like he
[1:22:06] killed the
[1:22:08] Egyptians right that's right so God sent
[1:22:12] him 40 more years let them beat it out
[1:22:14] and die
[1:22:16] and let them whip them to death and one
[1:22:19] day they was crying out you know they
[1:22:20] was willing for Moses to come back back
[1:22:23] and they'd listen to
[1:22:25] him maybe that's why we're here 40 or 50
[1:22:29] years after the prophet went off the
[1:22:31] scene is because God is having to whip
[1:22:33] you and I into line
[1:22:36] Amen to hear the word let's Stand
[1:22:39] Together anybody has a need the altar
[1:22:41] open if not we're going into the
[1:22:45] communion thank on these
[1:22:51] things
[1:22:53] think on these things you have a
[1:22:57] need come and let's

[1:23:11] of the ministers and the
[1:23:14] deacons I guess we back down to me
[1:23:16] serving
[1:23:20] communion well because I want them to
[1:23:24] know what's going on and to be a
[1:23:26] part I want them to choose to be a
[1:23:31] part cuz they're on for moral
[1:23:35] agency but think about these
[1:23:40] things God is leaving it up to you and I
[1:23:42] to make a
[1:23:43] choice
[1:23:45] right cuz come on I tried to tell you
[1:23:48] the other day don't cabbage down on for
[1:23:49] knowledge cuz if you cabbage down on it
[1:23:51] you're going to sat down and say he saw
[1:23:53] me hit that wall I got to hit that
[1:24:00] wall so you're predetermining
[1:24:07] it you remember what the old colored
[1:24:09] brother
[1:24:10] said I believe this Bible from ker to
[1:24:13] ker even believe the ker because it's
[1:24:15] got go got Holy Bible written on now M
[1:24:20] do you believe that word yeah
[1:24:23] said what if God told you to jump
[1:24:24] through that wall he said i'
[1:24:28] jump well there's no hold he said ain't
[1:24:31] up to me up to him to get the hole there
[1:24:34] time I get
[1:24:36] there did he believe in the stamp seal
[1:24:39] there's a
[1:24:42] wall see this right here is what's
[1:24:46] destroying you and
[1:24:51] I they have proved it talk to these
[1:24:54] people who are in
[1:24:57] karate they teach you to look through
[1:25:00] the wall or through the block or
[1:25:02] whatever you're doing you look at it
[1:25:04] you'll break your
[1:25:06] hand if you look through
[1:25:10] it you can go through
[1:25:14] it you said well no I don't believe that
[1:25:17] see you're an unbeliever there's people
[1:25:19] that can run right through that wall and
[1:25:22] not let it stop
[1:25:26] them because they set their
[1:25:31] mind jump
[1:25:33] kick do things that it's
[1:25:39] impossible because theyve set their
[1:25:42] mind they've made a
[1:25:44] choice if that can be as I talking last
[1:25:47] night what do you think isn't it odd
[1:25:51] that hit
[1:25:53] Hitler wanted a
[1:25:56] what when was Hitler in a being 30s
[1:26:01] 40s
[1:26:03] right isn't it odd he wanted a super
[1:26:07] race of
[1:26:12] people you know he wanted a blonde race
[1:26:14] super race I never understand the blonde
[1:26:15] part you know pale I
[1:26:19] reckon but that's what he wanted
[1:26:24] you had never thought
[1:26:25] about that during the time he was trying
[1:26:28] to bring forth his super race God was
[1:26:31] getting a prophet ready to talk about a
[1:26:33] super
[1:26:37] race anointing was on that man he took a
[1:26:40] world to
[1:26:41] war anointing was on brother randam and
[1:26:44] he took a people to will take us to
[1:26:49] Glory what if Hitler picked that up of
[1:26:53] the super
[1:26:55] race but yet he tried to make it in the
[1:26:57] natural that's right and it won't
[1:27:03] work is there Supernatural it will
[1:27:08] work I've always told you they tried to
[1:27:10] tell the man you know that was supposed
[1:27:13] to never walk or anything and they had
[1:27:15] the four minute mile and nobody ever
[1:27:16] broke
[1:27:18] it and the guy that was supposed to not
[1:27:20] even walk
[1:27:23] got able to walk got able to
[1:27:26] run and you know they just didn't tell
[1:27:29] him that he couldn't do that he goes out
[1:27:33] and breaks a 4minute
[1:27:36] mile the little old
[1:27:40] bumblebee
[1:27:42] scientifically Impossible by the
[1:27:44] wingspan for it to fly they just forgot
[1:27:49] to tell the
[1:27:51] Bumblebee
[1:27:57] well let's get away from what people are
[1:27:59] trying to tell
[1:28:01] us and get into what God says about
[1:28:05] us
[1:28:06] right think on these
[1:28:11] things Paul said for I have received of
[1:28:14] the Lord that which also I delivered
[1:28:15] unto you that the Lord Jesus the same
[1:28:18] night in which he was betrayed took
[1:28:19] bread and when he had given thanks he
[1:28:22] break it and said take eat this is my
[1:28:24] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:28:26] remembrance of me now after the same
[1:28:28] manner also he took the cup when he had
[1:28:30] s
[1:28:31] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[1:28:34] my blood this do ye as often as you
[1:28:36] drink it in remembrance of me for as
[1:28:39] often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:28:41] this cup you do sh the Lord's death till
[1:28:43] he come wherefore whosoever shall eat
[1:28:46] this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:28:48] Lord unworthily she'll be guilty of the
[1:28:50] body and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:28:53] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:28:55] that bread and drink of that
[1:28:57] cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:28:59] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:29:02] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:29:05] body for this caused many are weak and
[1:29:07] sickly among you and many sleep or we
[1:29:10] would judge ourselves we should not be
[1:29:12] judged I love this but when we are
[1:29:16] judged we're chasen to the Lord
[1:29:20] why that we should not be condemned with
[1:29:23] the world where my brethren when you
[1:29:25] come together to eat t one for another
[1:29:28] and if any man any hunger let him eat at
[1:29:31] home that you come not together in the
[1:29:33] condemnation the rest will I set in
[1:29:35] order when I come let's just have a few
[1:29:38] moments of Prior praying one for the
[1:29:43] other and just pray for
[1:29:48] people pray that we all make the right
[1:29:50] choice
[1:29:53] that we make our calling and election
[1:29:56] sure and we believe it in the correct
[1:30:01] way because it determines whether or not
[1:30:03] we're going to walk off the
[1:30:06] earth let's
[1:30:20] pray father we thank you for your loving
[1:30:23] grace unto us we thank you for the day
[1:30:25] that we have and we pray that you'd
[1:30:27] bless us now as we've come together for
[1:30:29] this purpose today and that is to take
[1:30:32] the
[1:30:33] communion and the foot washing and to
[1:30:36] walk in you
[1:30:37] Lord we know that we have a choice of
[1:30:40] these
[1:30:43] things but Lord what a wonderful thing
[1:30:47] to realize we do have an opportunity to
[1:30:50] choose
[1:30:53] that's better than having it
[1:30:55] stamped because there would be no
[1:30:57] overcoming in it if you stamped our
[1:30:59] Destiny without going by the forn
[1:31:02] knowledge of to see our
[1:31:05] destiny thank us to help us to think
[1:31:08] about Lord realizing that we're living
[1:31:11] our
[1:31:15] predestination and that way then I'm not
[1:31:17] worried about
[1:31:20] tomorrow I'm just living
[1:31:23] today we love you and we thank you in
[1:31:26] Jesus
[1:31:28] name the Bible said he took bread and
[1:31:31] blessed it father we thank you for this
[1:31:33] bread it's been made for this purpose
[1:31:35] today Lord that we could take this part
[1:31:39] as we call it the
[1:31:40] communion that we could break the bread
[1:31:42] and we could all be together as one
[1:31:45] because it is showing of
[1:31:48] your body that is the word
[1:31:52] we ask you to sanctify this bread and
[1:31:54] the partakers that we may all be
[1:31:56] together as one in you in Jesus
[1:32:14] name always think about when we get over
[1:32:17] on the other
[1:32:20] side Heaven whatever you want to call
[1:32:25] it and we'll take the
[1:32:29] communion it'll be from the hand of the
[1:32:31] Lord
[1:32:33] Jesus it'll have a whole lot more
[1:32:35] serious meaning than it does now to
[1:32:39] us because of all of our carnality will
[1:32:42] be gone and our wrong
[1:32:45] thinking and will be set on one
[1:32:50] thing
[1:32:52] and you know wouldn't bother me a
[1:32:55] bit I don't think it will
[1:32:57] you for that not to be a quick
[1:33:00] thing but for him to take about a
[1:33:03] thousand
[1:33:04] years as he's breaking the
[1:33:09] bread and explain to
[1:33:12] us what all this has been
[1:33:16] about I like to look
[1:33:20] back and see where where I come from
[1:33:22] don't
[1:33:24] you not look back to Rejoice over what I
[1:33:27] done but to look back and see what I
[1:33:29] come from father we thank you for this
[1:33:32] wine that's gone through this process
[1:33:33] and now it gets better every day we pray
[1:33:36] now that you would just sanctify the
[1:33:39] wine the bread and all of us together is
[1:33:42] one in you that we may be what you want
[1:33:45] us to be upon the Earth thank you for
[1:33:47] giving us a
[1:33:49] choice and then predetermining by our
[1:33:52] choices Lord then we can
[1:33:56] rejoice and
[1:33:58] say you are our
[1:34:01] father and we love
[1:34:04] you thank you father in Jesus
[1:34:08] name
[1:34:10] hallelu come

[1:34:39] morning there's
[1:34:41] glory for
[1:34:45] me sometimes I'm
[1:34:49] despised and rejected

[1:34:55] question oh
[1:34:57] Father how
[1:35:01] long then I take one more look at Mount
[1:35:10] Calvary and it gives me the strength to
[1:35:16] go

[1:35:43] midnight come
[1:35:45] morning there's
[1:35:50] Glory
[1:35:54] amen if we don't believe in being able
[1:35:57] to make a choice by free moral agent
[1:36:00] see why would we be concerned
[1:36:04] with to him that
[1:36:11] overcometh if it's a stamp sealed thing
[1:36:14] that's finished and we're only living
[1:36:16] out in
[1:36:17] life why would the Bible say to him that
[1:36:20] overcometh
[1:36:24] the prophet said it's not what you
[1:36:26] overcome he said it's how you
[1:36:30] overcome why wouldn't we want to take
[1:36:34] and believe that we are here for one
[1:36:39] purpose this bride in the end time is
[1:36:41] here for one
[1:36:44] purpose that's to become the word for
[1:36:47] the hour that we're
[1:36:49] living and to pull the dead out of the
[1:36:54] grave and then we'll be changed in the
[1:36:56] moment of twinkl of an
[1:36:58] eye what we're talking about last night
[1:37:00] in the order of the Rapture everybody
[1:37:03] wants to talk about the Rapture but
[1:37:05] according to the Bible there's got to be
[1:37:06] a resurrection before there can be a
[1:37:08] Rapture you
[1:37:10] know then we got to be changed before
[1:37:13] there can be a going
[1:37:15] away and all of that's going to happen
[1:37:18] right
[1:37:20] here while we're
[1:37:23] living and we are that people thank you
[1:37:27] Lord the Bible says we are the people
[1:37:29] that what that the ends of the Earth has
[1:37:33] come
[1:37:38] upon we have a job to do
[1:37:42] folks somebody's got to get that dead
[1:37:45] out of the
[1:37:49] Grave Why Can't We Believe we're the
[1:37:51] people that'll do
[1:37:53] it if not we got to wait for somebody
[1:37:56] else appreciate you you
[1:38:02] know what about
[1:38:20] it
[1:38:24] let's all protect
[1:38:42] together you can be seated for a moment
[1:38:44] while
[1:38:45] we get ready for the foot
[1:38:50] washing
[1:38:53] you know if we could just have a
[1:38:54] baptismal
[1:38:55] service we would have it all fulfilled

[1:39:16] having now put into the heart of Judas
[1:39:18] his carot Simon's son to betray him
[1:39:20] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:39:22] all things into his hands that he was
[1:39:23] come from God and went to God he rided
[1:39:26] from supper and laid aside his garments
[1:39:28] and took a towel and GED himself after
[1:39:30] that he poured water into a basin and
[1:39:32] began to wash the disciples feet he
[1:39:34] wiped them with a towel wherewith he was
[1:39:36] GED then cometh he to Simon Peter and
[1:39:39] Peter Sith unto him Lord Dost thou wash
