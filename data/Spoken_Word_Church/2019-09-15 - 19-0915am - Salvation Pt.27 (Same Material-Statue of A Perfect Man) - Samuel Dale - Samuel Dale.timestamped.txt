[30:17] he said but whom say ye that I am and

[30:35] my father which is in heaven and I say
[30:38] also unto thee that thou art Peter and
[30:41] upon this rock I will build my church
[30:44] and the gates of Hell shall not prevail
[30:47] against it and let's go over to 2nd
[30:54] Peter 1
[31:04] Peter servant and apostle of Jesus
[31:05] Christ to them that have obtained like
[31:07] precious faith with us through the
[31:09] righteousness of God and our Savior
[31:11] Jesus Christ grace and peace be
[31:14] multiplied unto you through the
[31:15] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord
[31:18] according as his divine power hath given
[31:20] unto us all things that pertain unto
[31:23] life and godliness through the knowledge
[31:26] of him that have called us to glory in
[31:29] virtually now how does it come through
[31:31] the knowledge of him that has called us
[31:34] to glory and virtue whereby are given
[31:37] unto us exceeding great and precious
[31:39] promises that by the ease you might be
[31:42] partakers of the divine nature having
[31:44] escaped the corruption that is in the
[31:46] world through lust and beside this
[31:48] giving all diligence add to your faith
[31:51] virtue and to virtue knowledge and to
[31:54] knowledge temperance and to temperance
[31:55] patience and to patience godliness and
[31:57] to godliness brotherly kindness and to
[32:00] brotherly kindness charity for if these
[32:03] things be in you and abound they make
[32:05] you that make you that ye shall neither
[32:08] be barren nor unfruitful in the
[32:11] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ you
[32:15] may be seated the Lord that is blessing
[32:17] to the reading of the word now we've
[32:27] spent some time and trying to get
[32:29] everything right in order to say what we
[32:33] want to about the stature of a perfect
[32:38] man but I hope that you'll understand
[32:41] one thing I want to drive this into your
[32:43] thinking to remember that the stature of
[32:47] a perfect man is what it is it's the
[32:49] stature it's the growth of a Christian
[32:52] it's it's what you know you you are born
[32:56] again by faith in God and then it keeps
[33:02] unfolding it keeps unfolding and
[33:04] unfolding until it comes forth to bring
[33:07] forth these virtues into the life of a
[33:10] Christian to make us what God wants us
[33:13] to be all right now then we'll get back
[33:16] to these things only
[33:18] but I want you two to think on one thing
[33:20] right here to start with to me now I
[33:26] have to look at things and follow it the
[33:29] way the Prophet is brought it and he
[33:32] said in the statue of a perfect man he
[33:33] says now you're adding these things will
[33:37] get back and review it but I won't this
[33:40] thought in your mind now if you're
[33:43] adding these things one to the other as
[33:46] we will go forth and you know speak on
[33:50] the things all right just remember the
[33:54] Prophet said now it's not that you know
[33:58] a woman receives the seed and and she
[34:02] has a baby and cities it's formed in her
[34:04] wound but said it's not the cell of a
[34:07] dog in the cell of a cat and the cell of
[34:09] a you know an animal it's the one cell
[34:13] multiplied you know and made forth all
[34:17] right the stature of a perfect man then
[34:19] you look this into your mind so think it
[34:24] deep and think on it that these virtues
[34:28] are all the same material all right it's
[34:35] not this material no more than it would
[34:39] be the material of a dog on a cat or you
[34:42] know to bring forth into a body it's all
[34:46] the same material because it will not
[34:50] vulcanize unless it is the same material
[34:53] now you remember that for the Statue of
[34:55] a perfect man I've asked you to read it
[34:57] and if you will go on and read
[35:00] blasphemous names which was about three
[35:04] or four months later and you'll see a
[35:06] lot of things in there that will go
[35:08] together
[35:08] and help us to understand but follow
[35:13] that point now in Wilden then you'll see
[35:15] what we're driving so hard at it's not
[35:18] the material of a horse and a cow makes
[35:22] a dog
[35:24] we've got enough sense to know that's
[35:26] not true
[35:26] all right now so in the body of Christ
[35:31] it's word upon word is what builds the
[35:37] body of Christ and if we're talking
[35:40] about the statue of a perfect man then
[35:42] it'll be word added to word it's the
[35:47] same material see that's why when we get
[35:51] to the point of seeing how that we get
[35:53] these virtues that will be a very
[35:55] valuable point to remember that each one
[36:01] of these virtues is the same material
[36:04] it's the Holy Ghost working in us to
[36:10] bring forth His divine nature and bring
[36:15] it to a position so don't lose that now
[36:18] as we go along and we talk about
[36:21] something we try to nail it down about
[36:23] faith we've been on that for quite a
[36:24] while
[36:25] just remember faith is a revelation all
[36:30] right so the statute of perfect man is
[36:32] gonna have to be built on Revelation
[36:36] that's why we read in Matthew where it
[36:39] says the gates of Hell shall not prevail
[36:40] against this what the body of Christ is
[36:44] built by the opening of the word or not
[36:51] now in being the opening of the word see
[36:54] as it opens its word upon word word upon
[36:59] word until we come to the full stature
[37:03] of Jesus Christ full growth all right so
[37:07] now whatever we talk about whatever you
[37:10] see faith to be you know if you can get
[37:14] that point to understand what faith
[37:16] really is then it'll be easy to be able
[37:20] to say add virtue because it's the same
[37:25] material all right it's not a different
[37:31] material it's the same material added to
[37:35] it virtue then knowledge will be the son
[37:38] material temperance patience godliness
[37:42] it'll all be the same material
[37:45] okay so you're not having to try to
[37:48] figure out it so if you just never find
[37:50] out what faith really is and get that in
[37:54] your in your understanding then you'll
[37:56] see what these virtues really are this
[38:00] is adding faith - faith - faith - faith
[38:03] are revelation - revelation right
[38:08] opening of God's Word to each one of us
[38:12] now all right you got that point hold
[38:14] that in mind that remember we're talking
[38:16] about these virtues whether it's faith
[38:19] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[38:21] godliness it's all the same material
[38:26] because it has to be vulcanized together
[38:29] and it has to be the same material to do
[38:33] that you can't as it probably said you
[38:35] can't vulcanize iron or metal - rubber
[38:38] he said that won't work well then let's
[38:42] don't try to say well well we got the
[38:45] new bird here but we get up here like
[38:47] they've told you it was taught many
[38:49] years ago and still being talked
[38:50] specially in the foreign fields about
[38:53] that you don't have the baptism of the
[38:56] Holy Ghost until you get up to where it
[38:58] says headstone well what is your base
[39:04] material then I'm asking you that
[39:06] question if you're saying that's where
[39:09] it's got to be you've got to have this
[39:10] then what is your base material
[39:13] what is your foundation right what is
[39:21] your foundation and the foundation of
[39:23] all Christianity is faith in the Word of
[39:25] God see then it's very simple if we
[39:30] follow it correctly if not then we'll
[39:33] try to make this to be one thing and
[39:35] this is something else over here we need
[39:37] virtue so we'll have virtue all you need
[39:41] is just to do what the Prophet said What
[39:46] did he say about the thing that we need
[39:49] to do more than anything pray
[39:54] read your Bible right wanna pray read
[40:00] you Bible okay in the Statue of a
[40:04] perfect man will mention as we're going
[40:05] along he says you get this lined up and
[40:09] correct he said it'll be automatically
[40:11] added now I've tried to explain this
[40:16] years ago and listen to the point
[40:18] there's a difference between
[40:20] automatically adding and adding
[40:22] automatically you know alright thank
[40:28] women now there's a difference between
[40:30] something if it's something that's
[40:33] within us and working and then it will
[40:37] be that district the more of that one
[40:40] over the other and you'll see what I'm
[40:41] talking about that it will be
[40:43] automatically added one because it's the
[40:48] same material but don't say it's going
[40:51] to be added automatically well I don't
[40:53] have to worry about nothing cuz it's
[40:54] gonna it's gonna be added automatically
[40:58] yeah it's gonna be added automatically
[41:00] all I need to do is get born again well
[41:02] that's a good start but now what are you
[41:05] gonna do from their own no is not that
[41:12] where the Prophet said to Pentecostals
[41:15] cabbage down upon the point that they
[41:18] believe they got it at faith and stood
[41:21] on that is not basically all of your
[41:26] religious believing based upon just one
[41:29] point or thought you know where you say
[41:33] bad this one I said we believe message
[41:36] this what we shout it a little bit and
[41:41] you try to make it different things when
[41:44] it's the same point that's that's the
[41:46] point now I want you two to stay with me
[41:48] on and keep that in your mind okay
[41:53] alright so now the Prophet says that my
[41:59] vision I can go ahead and pull up number
[42:00] one if you want to that you cannot be
[42:05] saved
[42:07] without a revelation now are we going to
[42:15] believe him or what we think or what
[42:19] somebody else things we could at least
[42:25] depend upon that point all right well
[42:29] brother Dale I didn't get no revelations
[42:31] when I got born again sorry maybe you
[42:38] didn't get born again
[42:44] well you hurting my feelings you're
[42:49] saying I'm not saved if you're not saved
[42:56] then you need your feelings hurt where
[43:00] you'll do something about it right well
[43:05] I've always depended on that one let's
[43:07] water see each Church you go as the
[43:10] Prophet says you go to each church and
[43:12] ask them and that's from what does it
[43:14] mean to be saved
[43:15] he said they'll each one give you a
[43:18] different form or thoughts but remember
[43:23] there's a difference between a
[43:25] revelation a revelation is a substance
[43:34] there's a difference between that then
[43:37] what you're you go through the the
[43:40] shouting the crime everybody thinks he
[43:42] will brother dealt against these things
[43:44] I believe in more emotional situations
[43:48] than any of you in this building I've
[43:49] always told you that I may not act like
[43:53] it but I don't have to put nothing on I
[43:56] am the saint you know all right cuz I
[44:01] believe it but are we gonna believe what
[44:04] he says now are we gonna tell you what
[44:06] we say you have a brother Dale I didn't
[44:08] get no revelation all I done was shouted
[44:14] well
[44:16] I didn't get no revelation all I doing
[44:19] was cried see you're talking about the
[44:22] manifestation of something not the very
[44:26] product itself
[44:28] there's nobody against any emotional
[44:31] situation I've gotten a couple in here
[44:34] this is a brought for that purpose
[44:35] we've brought around said a a dead baby
[44:38] a dead still baby this is no life so
[44:45] what did he say you do you take the baby
[44:47] in you spank it and it comes alive right
[44:54] what because it needs that shock all
[44:58] right but he said a dead baby is just a
[45:01] dead baby he said that's what we've done
[45:04] we've belittled he said the new birth
[45:12] we've made it to be something that it's
[45:15] not
[45:15] you said I spoke in tongue all right
[45:19] praise God but that's not to birth the
[45:28] the birth is a revelation of Jesus
[45:30] Christ
[45:31] personally to you wait till in just a
[45:38] minute when we read one where the
[45:40] Prophet says the new birth is a mystery
[45:43] oh all right so let's read while we're
[45:51] talking on revelation this is from the
[45:53] patmans vision we've read this over and
[45:55] over and over and over but we'll keep
[45:56] reading it over and over and over okay
[45:58] ask him to give you a revelation of this
[46:01] all right
[46:02] for it can only be known by revelation
[46:05] and you can only be saved by revelation
[46:10] but I didn't get the revelation brother
[46:12] there that's why I believe the new birth
[46:17] the way I do it can be a instantaneous
[46:25] point
[46:28] as we've tried to explain to you the
[46:31] house of Canisius when they heard the
[46:34] word the Holy Ghost fell on them the
[46:38] three thousand there at Pentecost when
[46:40] they heard the word the Holy Ghost fell
[46:42] on them right but the disciples was
[46:46] three and a half years before they
[46:51] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[46:53] that don't mean anything to you
[46:58] it's only to me is trying to explain to
[47:02] one person that maybe a quick
[47:04] instantaneous point I believe in no son
[47:08] but to another one sitting beside of you
[47:11] it may be a long process I've told you
[47:16] my experience I was 2 years in this
[47:20] message before I'd confess the baptism
[47:22] of the Holy Ghost will you come into the
[47:25] message then that's what I've been told
[47:27] that by preachers well you've come in
[47:29] the message did you believe the message
[47:30] I feel yeah I believe it a whole lot
[47:32] more than you think I said I've read and
[47:35] studied this message more than you ever
[47:36] even thought about reading but I said
[47:39] that's not the new birth that's an
[47:44] aftereffect the baby cries after its
[47:50] birth right the shock the well the way
[47:58] you teach the new birth brother they're
[47:59] my kids can't understand that well
[48:05] what's the problem
[48:07] have you ever tried to explain it to
[48:15] come on
[48:17] have you ever tried to explain to your
[48:19] children how they need what salvation
[48:21] really is now I'm gonna make you that
[48:26] much matter the reason you don't try to
[48:29] explain to your children what the new
[48:31] birth is it because you don't know what
[48:33] it is you're making it something that
[48:36] it's not
[48:37] you're making it speaking in tongues out
[48:39] and crying doing this that or the other
[48:43] instead of making it what's your profit
[48:45] just say it you can only be saved by
[48:48] revelation upon this rock Matthew I'll
[48:58] build my church and the gates of Hell
[49:01] cannot prevail against you
[49:03] the church is built on a revelation a
[49:05] revelation of what now come on let's
[49:08] build on the revelation of Jesus Christ
[49:11] is that the way the Prophet explains it
[49:14] he says now the the one group says it's
[49:17] it's built on on Jesus the other group
[49:19] said it's built on Peter he said but now
[49:21] let me stand there with and say neither
[49:24] one that's right he said it's built on
[49:26] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[49:28] right don't look what he's saying you
[49:33] can only be saved by revelation he said
[49:36] well well I don't like what well he's
[49:40] the one you claim to be the prophet are
[49:44] you gonna believe what he says well
[49:48] you're misinterpret this interpreted
[49:50] somebody get up and read this I'll be
[49:52] glad to sit down is there any plainer
[49:56] than one thing you can only be known you
[49:59] can only be known by revelation and you
[50:01] can only be saved by revelation now
[50:04] watch him you have a knowledge of it
[50:07] intellectually but you can't be saved
[50:14] until it's revealed to you now that's
[50:18] what he said
[50:19] I'm not trying to interpret that I'm
[50:23] trying to read what he said
[50:29] look no man can call Jesus the Christ
[50:31] only by the Holy Ghost now you know
[50:34] where we use the other week 10 or so
[50:36] quotes from it you can only it can only
[50:38] be by the baptism of the Holy Ghost can
[50:41] you know that Jesus is the Christ
[50:47] now remember anointed ones can be
[50:49] anointed but what do they like the
[50:56] anointing is the same come on
[50:58] but what if they're known and ones what
[51:01] are they missing the revelation they've
[51:06] got the spirit
[51:07] they've got the anointing and we'll read
[51:12] one in a minute where the Prophet said
[51:14] said you come in this in stature of a
[51:16] perfect man you folks have been reading
[51:17] the book where he says you come to a
[51:19] great experience of sanctification he
[51:23] said but that's not in it well I I just
[51:31] don't understand coda I've never had a
[51:33] revelation
[51:36] well are you admitting that you're not
[51:39] saying no well praise God what are you
[51:50] going to deny what he said come on
[51:55] no man can Cochise the cross the only by
[51:58] the old ago that's what the Bible says
[51:59] no man can say Jesus is the Christ until
[52:02] he has received the Holy Ghost
[52:07] he might say the pastor says so the
[52:10] Bible says so then we're truth the
[52:14] church says so that is true but you
[52:16] don't know it yourself
[52:18] until the Holy Ghost has revealed it to
[52:20] you and he's become in new
[52:32] if you come to me today and you say
[52:34] brother Dale I want to be saved
[52:37] would you pray for me to be safe let's
[52:42] say well let's sit down and talk about
[52:45] this thing for a little bit are you
[52:49] wanting to be saved or you want to shout
[52:51] speak in tongues or what do you want to
[52:52] do well I want an experience all right
[53:00] I believe in experience I believe in the
[53:04] experience of the baptism of the Holy
[53:06] Ghost
[53:06] I believe ever born-again believer that
[53:09] has ever been born again had the same
[53:14] experience now there's what goes hard on
[53:18] the grain in it yeah but I remember
[53:21] losing don't if the baby's gonna that's
[53:23] after-effects the new birth is the same
[53:28] no matter what age or what time it's the
[53:33] revelation of Jesus Christ personally -
[53:35] you will see all you can remember is to
[53:42] the experience you've had of of the
[53:45] emotional situation you don't think
[53:48] about what you really ought to think
[53:51] about you realize being brought into
[53:54] this message I try to think about that
[53:56] being my new birth then anything else I
[54:02] could experience then I'm back on their
[54:10] side of it
[54:11] saying well well I I believe the message
[54:15] you know it's right means I got the Holy
[54:16] Ghost well that's a good example because
[54:22] you can only believe it by the baptism
[54:24] with old ago other that's your
[54:25] make-believe
[54:34] go ahead to number two and watch what he
[54:36] says that was from the Patmos vision
[54:39] this is from a paradox 1963 801 they
[54:45] look that virgin birth was a mystery to
[54:50] the people right they couldn't
[54:54] understand it just like the new birth is
[55:00] today the new birth is a mystery to the
[55:07] people I thought a mystery was a
[55:17] previously hidden truth I'm trying to
[55:19] paraphrase the wording of it the Prophet
[55:22] used with the previously hidden truth
[55:24] that once it's made known to you it's
[55:29] part of you their mystery the new birth
[55:36] is a mystery that's what he's just
[55:38] saying well I don't get no mystery see
[55:44] that's what it goes back to ah I didn't
[55:47] get no revelation brother branham what
[55:55] is the new birth will you read it just a
[56:02] second this revelation Jesus Christ
[56:03] personally to you yeah but you're doing
[56:08] away with ever experience that I've ever
[56:14] thought about
[56:20] I'm not doing away with no experience
[56:22] I'm putting experience in a great
[56:25] wonderful place a dead baby doesn't have
[56:30] an experience you've got to spank it to
[56:32] get the experience to take place right a
[56:35] stillborn baby I know the prophets using
[56:39] that and it's hard to understand because
[56:40] he uses the word stillborn or it's dead
[56:47] and see then he says it needs to
[56:50] spanking to bring it forward to shock it
[56:52] into life so then it's not dead like we
[56:55] thought well if you're scared you don't
[56:57] need to do anything with it if dead it
[57:02] just means in that situation the breath
[57:04] of life has not introduced the body and
[57:08] it needs help right well look what he
[57:11] says the new birth is a mystery to the
[57:15] people they can't understand it they
[57:18] don't know what you mean they have
[57:23] belittled it bringing it down saying
[57:29] well just because you believe something
[57:38] don't believe in something is not a new
[57:40] birth that's an aftereffect right
[57:50] that something has happened because of
[57:52] your believing the devil believe the
[58:00] same thing in tremble it isn't what you
[58:04] believe is what God has actually done
[58:12] now the new birth is something that God
[58:15] has done some history I don't understand
[58:23] now they leave that back up here with it
[58:25] I don't understand how they can be a
[58:27] virgin birth I like the way the Prophet
[58:32] explains things don't you
[58:33] he says a whole lot easier to understand
[58:36] the virgin birth than it is the natural
[58:39] birth right because the virgin birth
[58:45] God created egg germ whatever placed it
[58:50] in the womb nars the virgin birth
[58:54] nothing with mankind uh-huh it's the
[58:59] virgin birth all right then it's so much
[59:04] easier to understand that than it is the
[59:08] natural birth cause in the natural birth
[59:09] it's many eggs and many churn and
[59:15] everything's got to be perfectly right
[59:16] to go and do this or where to come out
[59:18] right right this is the new birth it's
[59:23] an easy thing to understand it's a lot
[59:28] more easier to understand in the natural
[59:30] birth right God comes in and cleans out
[59:38] the vessel cleans it sanctified and puts
[59:44] his own life in it now how much more
[59:46] simple can the new birth be than that
[59:55] very simple isn't it we'll see we don't
[59:58] want to take that we want to lay on
[1:00:00] something that we've done or haven't
[1:00:02] done hey where do you say it God is
[1:00:08] actually done the new birth is what God
[1:00:11] has done right the new birth is what God
[1:00:18] has done he cleaned out the vessel he
[1:00:24] coming within the vessel is what he's
[1:00:26] done I see
[1:00:34] go ahead to number three crisis the
[1:00:37] mystery of God reveal you can bring it
[1:00:44] down Luc's Christ in you makes him the
[1:00:45] center of the life of the revelation see
[1:00:49] Christ's life in you makes him the
[1:00:51] center of the revelation Christ in the
[1:00:53] Bible makes the Bible the complete
[1:00:55] revelation of Christ Christ in you makes
[1:00:58] you the complete revelation of the whole
[1:01:01] thing see what God is trying to do well
[1:01:09] we've been over this and we've been over
[1:01:11] this but do you have the new birth well
[1:01:19] I know I had to work another I didn't
[1:01:22] ask you what you've done because in the
[1:01:26] prophets message we can find the points
[1:01:29] where he says none of that is the new
[1:01:32] birth that's the aftereffects just like
[1:01:36] a baby being born then it cries the
[1:01:42] crying is not the birth the birth is
[1:01:46] took place the crying is an aftereffect
[1:01:50] so what is the new birth well president
[1:01:54] my children they just let us know
[1:01:56] because you've never explained to them
[1:01:58] what it is
[1:02:07] like I said maybe you can't explain the
[1:02:09] new birth because maybe you've never had
[1:02:10] it what is it for something to me that
[1:02:13] that I'm trying over and over if I have
[1:02:16] to say the same thing a thousand times
[1:02:18] for you to finally catch on that the new
[1:02:22] birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:02:25] and that what happened to you
[1:02:31] what's the birth of the word now then
[1:02:37] back to where we started that same
[1:02:40] material
[1:02:42] what's virtue the birth of the word
[1:02:49] what's knowledge the birth of the word
[1:02:58] what is the new birth then you'd say
[1:03:02] well brother branham what is the new
[1:03:04] birth
[1:03:06] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:03:08] personally to you amen not you join the
[1:03:14] church you shook a hand you've done
[1:03:16] something different now that takes out
[1:03:19] everything you could do when he says
[1:03:22] done something different that takes out
[1:03:24] everything you can do shouting crying
[1:03:26] speaking in tongues seeing visions
[1:03:28] having dreams and see I've told you
[1:03:36] don't like my experience I know but I
[1:03:39] told you I saw garden I was 11 years old
[1:03:41] but I never counted at the new birth you
[1:03:49] said brother Dale what is your new birth
[1:03:50] it's the birth of the word because
[1:03:52] that's what the Prophet said it is
[1:03:55] that's what Jesus said it was unless
[1:03:59] you'd be born to him unless you be born
[1:04:02] from above unless you be born from where
[1:04:06] I was born from what is it
[1:04:17] you've done something different you said
[1:04:20] a Creed you promised to live by a code
[1:04:23] of rules listen
[1:04:28] but Christ the Bible he is the word that
[1:04:32] was revealed to you and no matter what
[1:04:35] anybody else says what takes place
[1:04:39] it's Christ pastor priest whatever it
[1:04:42] might be is Christ in you that is the
[1:04:46] revelation that the church was built
[1:04:48] upon now we're back to the beginning
[1:04:52] what was the church built upon come on
[1:05:02] upon this rock I'll build my church and
[1:05:05] the gates of hell walks a built not on
[1:05:07] Peter and not on Jesus right on the
[1:05:13] revelation of who Jesus Christ is
[1:05:18] it's the revelation the church has been
[1:05:20] built on the gates of hell can't prevail
[1:05:25] against that it'll try because that's
[1:05:29] what the brother said see that's gonna
[1:05:30] try but it it can't prevail what is the
[1:05:38] new verb then much more simpler could
[1:05:40] you ask brother Branham what is the new
[1:05:42] birth he says revelations Jesus Christ
[1:05:47] personally to you
[1:05:48] and then what else well now here is
[1:05:53] where rap okay well brother Dale what
[1:05:58] book do I need to read to get the
[1:06:01] revelation of Jesus Christ I mean is any
[1:06:04] certain book he's certain time that I
[1:06:08] could read to get the revelation of
[1:06:10] Jesus Christ
[1:06:11] yeah there's a book called the Bible and
[1:06:17] the Bible happens to be what the Word of
[1:06:20] God well
[1:06:27] read the Bible and pray is that what the
[1:06:30] Prophet said you want to get closer to
[1:06:32] God read your Bible and pray well I
[1:06:38] still have time to read it understand
[1:06:41] you reading everything else don't start
[1:06:44] that stuff with me you know where I
[1:06:47] stand and just forget that you've got
[1:06:53] it's not time for everything else look
[1:07:02] what is the new birth go to Brenda it's
[1:07:07] a revelation of Jesus Christ personally
[1:07:09] to you know then what would be the thing
[1:07:19] that we need to consider more than
[1:07:21] anything it's to read and study your
[1:07:26] Bible you know one time I read study the
[1:07:30] message listened to tapes but see we're
[1:07:35] soul the human mind is so malfunctioned
[1:07:43] I guess the best working for something
[1:07:46] my brother got offended at me one time
[1:07:48] really got a highly offended because all
[1:07:51] I said was you I I wish you'd read
[1:07:55] showing so it's like I said I wish you'd
[1:07:58] read statue a perfect man
[1:07:59] you know I said read or listened to a
[1:08:02] tape he got offended at me you know why
[1:08:05] because he couldn't read he told it he
[1:08:10] got offended it I said he ought to read
[1:08:12] when he couldn't read then what kind of
[1:08:17] carnality is that I've got a little
[1:08:20] sense if you can't read you can't read
[1:08:23] but what do you do in place of reading
[1:08:26] you listen to tape I have said that what
[1:08:32] the brother got highly offended that I
[1:08:33] had apologized to it for what for saying
[1:08:36] I
[1:08:39] all he wanted was an excuse to be able
[1:08:42] to jump on to me I gave him that excuse
[1:08:46] I apologized that took away his excuse
[1:08:53] you apologize for telling the truth I'm
[1:08:56] apologizing many times for trying my
[1:08:58] best to help people like one brother
[1:09:04] said one time he said to thank brother
[1:09:06] Dale he said come and apologize to me
[1:09:10] for something he said to me he said when
[1:09:11] he was the one that dug me out of a hole
[1:09:17] in other words what I said to him dug
[1:09:19] him out of a hole that he a pit he was
[1:09:21] going into he said thank the man would
[1:09:25] come and apologize I didn't apologize
[1:09:27] for trying to hit him no that's that's
[1:09:30] that's wrong don't get on those or do
[1:09:32] not apologize I ain't gonna pologize
[1:09:34] you're not even knowing what I'm talking
[1:09:37] about the Bible says there with me the
[1:09:47] Bible says if we think our brother had
[1:09:51] fought against us the Prophet said it
[1:09:56] don't mean he has a fault he said if you
[1:10:01] think he's gotta fall you need to go
[1:10:02] straighten it out right I ain't
[1:10:08] apologizing don't worry about it cuz
[1:10:17] you're not you you're not thinking about
[1:10:19] what I'm saying at all I thought we're
[1:10:22] supposed to be living for others but I
[1:10:29] hope the whole thing thought the whole
[1:10:30] part of Christianity but listen what a
[1:10:39] number four now listen to what your
[1:10:54] prophet says you can't that can't
[1:10:59] understand you talking about they can't
[1:11:01] understand how you can speak in tongues
[1:11:03] and this can be done at it they can't
[1:11:05] understand it until that man is born
[1:11:08] again then when he's born again then
[1:11:15] he's in line of fellowship because he's
[1:11:18] a new creation the old suspicious
[1:11:21] doubting character he was is dead
[1:11:23] and he's a new creation so you see you
[1:11:27] don't have to add anything to his now
[1:11:32] because it automatically be added it'll
[1:11:38] automatically be added not at it
[1:11:40] automatically not to the point where
[1:11:44] like they don't matter what I do or
[1:11:45] whatever it's gonna be given to me I'm
[1:11:48] gonna get that anyway call this out
[1:11:49] tonight now then you know what he's
[1:11:50] saying
[1:11:54] he's gonna be automatically added if you
[1:11:56] get started right and keep taking in
[1:11:59] what you're doing if the new birth is
[1:12:03] the birth of the word then what would be
[1:12:05] the rest of the statue of a perfect man
[1:12:08] word add it to word under word until you
[1:12:12] come to the full stature that's over
[1:12:14] here in the message in just a little
[1:12:15] while for the Prophet says that in
[1:12:18] visible union of right across but look
[1:12:27] notice you must be born again and when
[1:12:30] you're born again you can't be born
[1:12:33] again without having faith that's right
[1:12:36] so you see on my chart here I've got the
[1:12:40] very foundation faith is the foundation
[1:12:42] of all of it or without faith it's
[1:12:46] impossible to please God
[1:12:49] they started off the statue of a perfect
[1:12:52] man at faith now watch when we pick that
[1:12:59] up this afternoon okay we're gonna pick
[1:13:04] that point up this afternoon okay but
[1:13:08] think with me now
[1:13:11] the foundation is faith how faith let's
[1:13:20] see this well - oh no no you're either
[1:13:29] controlled by faith or doubt you're
[1:13:32] possessed of one that dominates your
[1:13:35] life look but first he's got to be faith
[1:13:37] let me say stay on that foundation for a
[1:13:40] while now faith is what you must believe
[1:13:43] faith is what faith is the substance of
[1:13:46] things hoped for its you already have it
[1:13:50] when you have faith cause it's revealed
[1:13:52] in faith faith is the substance of
[1:13:54] things hoped for Hebrews 11 faith what
[1:14:02] is the first thing in the statute of
[1:14:05] perfect man we're going down through
[1:14:09] here cuz it in here or the Prophet says
[1:14:11] how faith and be born again you can't be
[1:14:16] born again without faith I don't care
[1:14:22] how much you read go see that's not
[1:14:24] that's one of those things that we see
[1:14:26] or like the Prophet would say you know
[1:14:29] you come to knowledge in the statue of
[1:14:31] perfume and well I just I just read I
[1:14:34] need knowledge I'll just get knowledge
[1:14:37] they said that's not the way it is
[1:14:42] least the death's-head knowledge then go
[1:14:53] ahead waiting number five these are
[1:14:57] still off the stature of a perfect man
[1:15:00] first you must be born again and then
[1:15:06] when you're born again you have faith
[1:15:09] you believe the word until you're born
[1:15:13] again you'll argue against it
[1:15:15] well I don't hide under he's trying his
[1:15:18] best to make me say something but to
[1:15:20] ride my birth that I had I know I'd born
[1:15:22] again I know right words that I know
[1:15:30] come on first you must be born again and
[1:15:38] then when you're born again you have
[1:15:39] faith you believe the word until you're
[1:15:42] born again you'll argue against it
[1:15:43] you're you're just religiously inclined
[1:15:47] and you got a little human knowledge
[1:15:49] that you should do right you'll never be
[1:15:52] able to agree upon the Word of God
[1:15:54] you'll never do it you've got to be born
[1:15:57] again and born again it produces faith
[1:16:03] all right then after you get faith
[1:16:06] that's right here faith if they ought to
[1:16:09] yes then you're just in position of
[1:16:12] growing you're just in position of
[1:16:18] growing when you have a revelation of
[1:16:21] Jesus Christ to you as a new birth is
[1:16:25] that what he's saying you can't be born
[1:16:33] again without faith well if you got
[1:16:37] faith then now that's not human
[1:16:40] intellectual understanding that's real
[1:16:43] true revelation there's a difference in
[1:16:46] in brother Merton let's see how can I do
[1:16:48] it is in blasphemous name it might be in
[1:16:50] stature program I know some black penis
[1:16:52] night well Verteron talks about a lot of
[1:16:54] people having a portion of these virtues
[1:16:55] and not even born again right there's
[1:17:01] good neighbors that live around you
[1:17:03] right we'll do anything in the world for
[1:17:05] you right and not even talk about being
[1:17:11] born again the boy boy it produces faith
[1:17:20] come on now a lot of people go up Luna
[1:17:29] now a lot of people go up to the altar
[1:17:33] and pray and this is from statue of
[1:17:36] perfect man and say Lord forgive me and
[1:17:40] a great experience of sanctification
[1:17:42] comes upon them and things then you have
[1:17:47] a great time get up to the older
[1:17:49] shouting you go back bless God I got it
[1:17:54] now what did he say no you just started
[1:18:02] to the place where you can grow a great
[1:18:06] experience of sanctification and you
[1:18:08] come up shouting you remember that Waits
[1:18:10] priest owner than enough your turn Orton
[1:18:11] that but I preached on it enough to know
[1:18:13] one thing over and over what
[1:18:16] sanctification is the most dangerous
[1:18:18] stage there is ending it in the new
[1:18:21] birth process or anything why because
[1:18:24] it's so deceiving you come forth with
[1:18:27] its sanctification you get new desires
[1:18:29] you get new thoughts who get new things
[1:18:31] you do you stay away from the world you
[1:18:34] get rid of your drinking your smoking
[1:18:36] your you get rid of all of those things
[1:18:38] you stop doing them time you want to go
[1:18:40] to church you do things you want to
[1:18:42] become a help to everybody and you're
[1:18:44] just at sanctification ain't even born
[1:18:52] again but yet do you think you are well
[1:18:58] you know I haven't you ever heard people
[1:19:00] say how many times you said it you say
[1:19:01] well I would not like I did it if it
[1:19:03] wasn't something something happened to
[1:19:04] me now I'm telling you something
[1:19:06] happened to me well praise God
[1:19:11] something happen to me and I didn't know
[1:19:14] anything about this message that's what
[1:19:18] I used to tell the people you know that
[1:19:19] they say well will you uh you quit this
[1:19:22] and you quit that and you don't do this
[1:19:23] and don't do that and in things and said
[1:19:26] that means you're born again I said well
[1:19:28] then I must have been born again forever
[1:19:30] even heard of the message cuz I didn't
[1:19:33] drink smoke to run around didn't do
[1:19:36] nothing doctor was bragging on my wife
[1:19:41] and all because even when we were when
[1:19:44] we had a TV when we were in the Baptist
[1:19:46] Church we monitored our TV and got rid
[1:19:52] of it real quick
[1:19:55] not when we heard the message we begin
[1:20:01] to see the things was wrong she was
[1:20:04] telling the doctor about it and a lady
[1:20:06] was just elated to think that people
[1:20:08] would be that way
[1:20:10] well why not we were claiming to be
[1:20:14] Christians you just started to a place
[1:20:23] where you can grow you just got on the
[1:20:26] foundation you just laying that
[1:20:28] sanctification is a good part in that
[1:20:30] foundation is a faith you're gonna read
[1:20:31] it there's some sex so don't
[1:20:33] misunderstand
[1:20:34] there's worth a little where the things
[1:20:36] come in this morning we're going to talk
[1:20:40] about now all right a house this
[1:20:43] foundation is for what is the foundation
[1:20:45] of Christianity faith in the Word of God
[1:20:48] that's your foundation then you begin to
[1:20:51] grow then you start you begin to add to
[1:20:53] this foundation that's why the people
[1:20:57] couldn't understand brother Branham a
[1:21:00] lot of you know what I'm talking about
[1:21:02] is are true that back there into the 70s
[1:21:06] and the late sixties in the seventies a
[1:21:09] man was going around preaching that you
[1:21:12] didn't have the Holy Ghost until you got
[1:21:15] up to top of the pyramid and got the
[1:21:17] headstone
[1:21:20] let's see but around says your
[1:21:23] foundations fight what would it be if
[1:21:28] you were having to wait until you get
[1:21:29] all the way up here that's what a lot of
[1:21:31] people thinks the reason we're around
[1:21:32] here now is cause we gotta wait until we
[1:21:35] get right out here for we didn't get
[1:21:36] bored again brother so it's Oh tile tile
[1:21:38] I don't care what someone's hotel and
[1:21:42] arguing nobody then it in argument I
[1:21:44] just told it like it is I just sat down
[1:21:47] with one brother and laid it out said
[1:21:48] ours were the Prophet said that he met
[1:21:51] people with the baptism of the Holy
[1:21:53] Ghost
[1:21:53] just like on the day of Pentecost 50
[1:21:57] years before him and I said now there
[1:22:02] you are brother that's the reason and I
[1:22:05] don't believe what you're saying because
[1:22:08] the Prophet told it different he thought
[1:22:12] you're born again at faith if you're not
[1:22:17] born again at faith how are you gonna
[1:22:18] get a foundation you realize where you
[1:22:21] would be if you wait until you could get
[1:22:22] to the headstone and then you finally
[1:22:25] find out that's ours my foundation is
[1:22:28] right up there brother Brennan said the
[1:22:31] disciples didn't have that headstone
[1:22:33] yeah oh come on I can quote with you he
[1:22:37] said the disciples had these virtues
[1:22:40] right
[1:22:42] he made the statement of that with any
[1:22:45] major statement of what he said they
[1:22:47] didn't have the headstone cuz the
[1:22:49] headstone hadn't come
[1:22:55] but you see faith is a revelation a
[1:22:59] revelation of God's Word to you and I
[1:23:05] let's see where'd we get to we're on
[1:23:09] paragraph 134 great experience 132 our
[1:23:18] sanctification comes upon you and things
[1:23:20] and you have a great time get up from
[1:23:22] the altar shouting you go back say bless
[1:23:26] God I got it no you just started to a
[1:23:29] place where you can grow you ain't done
[1:23:31] nothing yet
[1:23:32] the only thing you
[1:23:34] done is laid the foundation you just
[1:23:36] started working on it then come on what
[1:23:39] is the foundation of Christianity faith
[1:23:41] in the Word of God that's your
[1:23:44] foundation then you begin to grow then
[1:23:49] you start you begin to add to this
[1:23:52] foundation now we're gonna pull this
[1:23:56] point right here and remember what I my
[1:24:00] point I told you to remember every one
[1:24:03] of those virtues is the same material
[1:24:10] cause every one of them is the Word of
[1:24:12] God that's revealed to you you'll find
[1:24:14] one of these days we'll get around to it
[1:24:16] you'll see what I'm talking about
[1:24:17] you'll see why did it's been so long
[1:24:19] trying to bring it how do you get those
[1:24:22] virtues by the word being revealed to
[1:24:24] you well brother Dale I don't like
[1:24:29] revelation you know y'all preach on
[1:24:31] revelation revelation out like that goes
[1:24:33] to show you don't know what you're
[1:24:34] talking about
[1:24:38] did I offend you that goes oh you don't
[1:24:41] know what I'm talking about
[1:24:42] I want a revelation don't you I want a
[1:24:47] revelation more than anything yeah but
[1:24:51] you just into most CEOs and enema
[1:24:53] Daniels was it the Prophet preacher is
[1:25:01] it in the Daniel 70 week's book one of
[1:25:04] the three books is it in there where
[1:25:06] brother Brian said if you don't
[1:25:07] understand this Daniel 70 weeks you
[1:25:09] ain't gonna understand the sales and
[1:25:10] thought he said that but how can you get
[1:25:16] two people to try to get him to study
[1:25:17] Daniel 70 ways I don't want it because
[1:25:23] they he says this and he said something
[1:25:25] looks like different here I've proved
[1:25:26] that over and over be glad to sit down
[1:25:28] we take my book and you can have it and
[1:25:30] over sat down and read it he was so
[1:25:34] perfect til he mathematically knew
[1:25:37] exactly what 1977 was and still is
[1:25:50] what about a man that could come out
[1:25:52] with a third grade education and he come
[1:25:56] out and he said making exactly thirty
[1:25:58] four hundred thirty years and you try to
[1:26:00] figure that thing out what did you
[1:26:02] believe in something you go haywire all
[1:26:05] you got to do do what he said according
[1:26:06] to Leviticus 25 days Leviticus 25 8 says
[1:26:09] 77249 49 times seven is thirty four
[1:26:12] hundred and thirty you know one multiply
[1:26:16] and see exactly what he's talking about
[1:26:22] when he said don't you say that I said
[1:26:24] to write for coming 70 cell no way come
[1:26:28] on let's get to this point and look
[1:26:34] we're home going 2-5 a it'd be the next
[1:26:39] one so you can see I added these things
[1:26:44] in later but okay 227 put it back down a
[1:26:50] little okay right there now if you got
[1:26:52] it like add to your faith if you still
[1:26:55] blow up incise and fuss and stew and
[1:26:58] curry on you ain't got no you can't add
[1:27:03] their clothes it won't add now listen to
[1:27:05] it how come it won't have how come our
[1:27:10] ideas our thoughts or opinions won't add
[1:27:12] to the Word of God
[1:27:14] cuz it's different material it's
[1:27:20] different material what I think God
[1:27:23] means and says is a different material
[1:27:25] from what he says and means you liked it
[1:27:28] that way
[1:27:29] I do what he says and means is right
[1:27:34] what I say in mean can be my own
[1:27:36] thoughts and ideas and concept
[1:27:47] Goforth like that they put a rag around
[1:27:49] his head eyes and put on to prophesy on
[1:27:52] will believe that he had temperance now
[1:27:54] if you got it like that add it to your
[1:27:57] faith if you still blow up incise and
[1:28:01] fuss and spew and carry on
[1:28:03] you ain't got no you can't add that
[1:28:06] cause it won't add C it won't vulcanize
[1:28:09] you couldn't take a piece of rubber you
[1:28:11] know and vulcanize it to a piece of iron
[1:28:14] see it won't it just won't work no it's
[1:28:19] got to be flexible just like the rubber
[1:28:21] is he and when your faith and your
[1:28:25] temperance becomes the same kind of Holy
[1:28:28] Ghost temperance that he had then it
[1:28:32] will vulcanize with him your added to it
[1:28:36] when your virtue is like his virtue then
[1:28:40] it'll add to it when your knowledge is
[1:28:41] like he is so what is it if the
[1:28:47] foundation of all Christianity is based
[1:28:52] upon faith if the new birth is the word
[1:28:57] revealed to you if it's a revelation of
[1:29:05] Jesus Christ personally to you then what
[1:29:08] would we hunt somewheres else to try to
[1:29:10] find virtue
[1:29:19] he said now it's not that kind of virtue
[1:29:21] to talk about these these things are not
[1:29:27] what we think they are they're the
[1:29:32] nature of Almighty God instilled up and
[1:29:36] into each one of us as he gets on over
[1:29:40] if you want him I'll be glad to give
[1:29:42] them to you
[1:29:42] the invisible union of the Bride of
[1:29:45] Christ that's my message to you Church
[1:29:49] you that's a union spiritual union by
[1:29:54] the word that you that you're dead -
[1:29:58] these old husbands you're born to new
[1:30:01] don't try to dig him up he's dead if
[1:30:03] you're a born-again Christian then that
[1:30:06] little germ that was predestinated in
[1:30:08] you it's word coming onward onward
[1:30:12] onward onward and come into full stature
[1:30:17] of Christ so what are these virtues the
[1:30:24] life of Jesus Christ
[1:30:28] starting at the faith of Jesus Christ
[1:30:31] then it becomes the virtue of Jesus
[1:30:33] Christ the knowledge the temperance the
[1:30:36] patience it's all in Jesus Christ
[1:30:42] kotas all the same material do you
[1:30:44] understand there's no difference in the
[1:30:51] faith of a born-again believer and the
[1:30:54] love of the headstone as far as what
[1:30:58] they are one could be greater than
[1:31:02] others yes more marvelous and
[1:31:06] understanding yes but it's the same
[1:31:08] material
[1:31:14] so now you see one that I emphatically
[1:31:16] state and try to drive so hard and been
[1:31:19] at it and will keep at it and whatever
[1:31:21] it's just a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:31:25] so the headstone is a revelation of
[1:31:28] Jesus Christ the new birth is a
[1:31:30] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:31:32] marriage and divorce is a revelation of
[1:31:34] Jesus Christ Daniel seventy weeks is a
[1:31:36] revelation of Jesus Christ the seals is
[1:31:37] a revelation of Jesus Christ the entire
[1:31:39] Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:31:43] right so we don't have to hunt for
[1:31:48] something different just take what God
[1:31:53] has given us and let that be a growth
[1:31:58] development come on brothers let that be
[1:32:03] a growth development and then when you
[1:32:08] see the when we get to it this afternoon
[1:32:10] when you talk about add to your faith
[1:32:14] then how is that your faith told us what
[1:32:23] scripture said add to your faith that'll
[1:32:33] be the same material that's what I was
[1:32:34] getting out of the way this morning
[1:32:35] that's the thought to get this point out
[1:32:37] of the way it's got to be the same
[1:32:39] material it is the easy to follow it
[1:32:42] it's just a growth development it's
[1:32:46] being born again more of the same
[1:32:51] material just being added in your birth
[1:32:55] or growing in grace and knowledge is
[1:32:59] that Scripture is that things add to
[1:33:05] your faith virtue when what if you don't
[1:33:08] have faith you can't add virtue right
[1:33:15] not sensible till you get faith first
[1:33:18] you get the new bird that's why it's so
[1:33:22] simple but it says it's a mystery how
[1:33:26] that God can come down into a human
[1:33:29] being and live in you and I and give us
[1:33:33] of his own life his own nature his own
[1:33:39] ways is on doing to give it to us to
[1:33:42] live in us to make us his children it's
[1:33:47] not a hard thing to do well then we're
[1:33:51] gonna find out it's a very simple thing
[1:33:52] to add virtue the very simple thing to
[1:33:58] add knowledge you just got to know what
[1:34:01] it is but if you realize and keep this
[1:34:04] thing in mind whatever it is that you're
[1:34:06] going to add it's going to be the same
[1:34:08] nature way person being word add it to
[1:34:16] word this reunion we just read to where
[1:34:20] it comes out to the stature of Jesus
[1:34:23] Christ you see why it's been so long the
[1:34:29] profit off the same now for 50 years
[1:34:31] you see it's why it's been so long it's
[1:34:36] because people don't want to listen
[1:34:40] there's a new birth oh I already got it
[1:34:44] what I need to listen brother Dale about
[1:34:46] a new bird I already got it he can't
[1:34:47] tell me I got it he's never try and tell
[1:34:50] nobody they didn't have it but I will
[1:34:53] tell you one thing for certain for you
[1:34:55] and me if it's not what God says then
[1:34:59] what we think we've got ain't right
[1:35:01] that's right if what we think we ain't
[1:35:05] got we ain't got it so why not do
[1:35:09] something about it I'd rather spend all
[1:35:12] of my life searching after God and come
[1:35:14] find out one day he tell me I've had it
[1:35:16] all along that did not search after him
[1:35:18] at all
[1:35:25] you realized in parents what I'm talking
[1:35:28] about if we spent our time teaching our
[1:35:33] children they would know what the new
[1:35:36] birth is but if we read Greer's Almanac
[1:35:43] all of these things you know try to get
[1:35:45] some time well I thought I'll tell you
