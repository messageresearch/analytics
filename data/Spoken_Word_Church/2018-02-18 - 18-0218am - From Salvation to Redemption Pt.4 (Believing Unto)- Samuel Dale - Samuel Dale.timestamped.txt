[5:37] weight kept life and until then brother
[5:38] John and his wife you know that they
[5:41] figure out one of these days we rent
[5:42] here that we're crazy people you know we
[5:45] have a good time
[5:46] fellowshiping together and doing all of
[5:50] the things especially when they get on
[5:52] asking the questions and you know and
[5:54] the things and trying to figure out who
[5:58] could remember what and we had won one
[6:01] night and and I
[6:02] couldn't get no answers correct out of
[6:04] the whole thing so my wife said we're
[6:06] not playing anymore and that's okay
[6:10] because I couldn't remember they just
[6:12] asked the wrong questions there's a lot
[6:15] of other things but yes you know one of
[6:17] them they had their life's night I
[6:18] wanted to get up an answer it but that's
[6:20] one if you had like $5,000 and you could
[6:23] spend what was in a living room dining
[6:26] room with the kitchen said which one
[6:28] would you do and I wanted to tell them
[6:30] say well my wife would say let's put it
[6:32] in the bank wait till everything goes on
[6:34] sale and we could get all three of them
[6:36] you know that would that would take care
[6:38] of it that would be the way of doing but

[7:38] through it you promised it you said you

[7:42] delivered us from destruction
[7:44] so got each one as we read your words
[7:46] you come and speak to our hearts in
[7:48] Jesus name Jonah - we still honor
[7:54] thought what from salvation to
[7:57] Redemption we spent I don't know how
[8:00] many services on a title called
[8:02] salvation bringing us true from the Old
[8:04] Testament and then now getting into the
[8:07] New Testament in stalking of redemption
[8:12] Jonah - at 9 but I will sacrifice on
[8:16] to deal with the voice of Thanksgiving I
[8:18] will pay that that that that I have
[8:21] vowed salvation is of the Lord all right
[8:25] let's go over to John 6 I don't think
[8:31] we'll get over to this point today but
[8:33] we'll we'll try to 6 we'll begin at 40
[8:39] end up foot down 42 yep 42 and they said
[8:46] is not this Jesus the Son of Joseph
[8:49] whose father and mother we know how is
[8:52] it then that he says I came down from
[8:55] heaven Jesus therefore answered and said
[8:59] unto them murmur not among yourselves
[9:03] now they're saying this guy's is he's
[9:06] better now watch him
[9:07] no man can come to me except the Father
[9:12] which has sent me draw him and I will
[9:16] raise him up at the last day you may be
[9:19] seated the Lord that is blessing to the
[9:21] reading of the word now to try to
[9:24] continue our our thoughts on but there's
[9:30] one thing I want you to think about now
[9:35] that we're dealing with the foundation
[9:38] and starting in the New Testament you
[9:42] know we spent all the time during the
[9:43] Old Testament we started into the New
[9:45] Testament hitting a few things and
[9:50] following over to the baptism of the
[9:53] holy ghost now remember that we're
[9:56] talking about the baptism of the holy
[9:58] ghost that came onto their Pentecost all
[10:01] right now you'll see the quotes will be
[10:04] saying this happened at Pentecost etc
[10:07] because that's as far as we're dealing
[10:09] with right now see it will we will start
[10:13] then once we get into the message a
[10:15] little we're still right here at faith
[10:17] then we'll start going up through this
[10:19] and out into the headstone the Lord
[10:22] willing and and covering it all right
[10:25] and but what I want you to thank with me
[10:29] today
[10:35] that there's a great gap between oh how
[10:42] would you say it between the people and
[10:45] God in the basis that you know it would
[10:51] it will take us a long time to cover the
[10:55] thoughts of trying to bring mankind to
[10:59] God all right because that's that's what
[11:04] it's being it's been that trying to do
[11:06] all right
[11:06] and and we we tried to bring it up to
[11:10] showing you the positive apex top line
[11:15] of what we were talking about okay so we
[11:21] talked about and we've covered it in the
[11:23] previous message that the new birth the
[11:28] baptism of the holy ghost and being born
[11:32] again is one in the same you don't break
[11:36] it down as the new birth being this part
[11:38] and the born-again being this part and
[11:40] the baptism being this part but yet when
[11:43] you start talking and studying the
[11:45] message that the prophet brought you're
[11:47] going to run into a lot of things that
[11:49] looks like that you know but yet you've
[11:53] got to remember that as I tried to
[11:57] express now the Bible is not written
[12:01] there's nowhere in the Bible that it
[12:04] would say and they gave an altar call to
[12:06] come and be repent of their sins they
[12:11] are to be justified or to be this it
[12:15] would always come and be born again
[12:19] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost it
[12:22] would be related into that area because
[12:24] that's the positive of it all right now
[12:27] we're still going to use something in
[12:29] the Lord willing we get to it in a
[12:30] minute because we're going to pick up
[12:33] the thought again that we use in the Old
[12:36] Testament of a potential all right but
[12:40] now remember
[12:43] remember this the new birth the baptism
[12:47] of the holy ghost the morning in
[12:50] experience which came on the day of
[12:51] Pentecost is not a partial realization
[12:59] it's perfect realization all right now
[13:04] you win this or if you won't deal with
[13:07] that it's perfect all right but then
[13:10] once you've reached that position to see
[13:13] what the Holy Ghost really is you'll
[13:15] find out that it's true that the Bible
[13:17] says that we read there are good many
[13:20] times that the Holy Ghost is an earnest
[13:24] to you all right
[13:27] see we've got to get to the new birth
[13:30] and then when that new birds we get it
[13:34] it's positive it's perfect but then
[13:37] comparing with what we need
[13:40] it is just an earnest all right you said
[13:46] well I got everything I need well that's
[13:48] true the worse the statue of a perfect
[13:51] man where's the adoption where's your
[13:53] your teachings of the Prophet that is
[13:57] involved and then you'll see you
[14:00] eventually when we get down to it
[14:02] we keep a little quote a little as we go
[14:04] along just every once in a while I'll
[14:06] quote something but brother Branham said
[14:08] I ain't conclusively prove that you're
[14:09] born again and then baptize the end of
[14:12] the body well you're gonna find that to
[14:19] be the seemingly contrary when he'll say
[14:23] that you can't believe until you're born
[14:27] again by the baptism with the holy God
[14:30] see there's a lot that goes with saying
[14:34] the baptism there's a lot goes with the
[14:38] new birth that's why to me now I didn't
[14:40] make the statement and I'm sorry
[14:43] sometimes I wish brother Branham had not
[14:45] made statements because that way you
[14:47] wouldn't be as positive to lean upon
[14:49] those things but he said during the
[14:52] church age book pirate a page 148
[14:54] remember over and over
[14:56] he said very few people will believe all
[15:00] the way to receiving the baptism of the
[15:04] spirit or the Spirit of God everyone it
[15:08] says them now we're going to get to it
[15:12] one of these days and seen I don't mean
[15:14] this wrong I'm not a optimistic of which
[15:18] one pessimist I guess I'm both of them a
[15:20] little on the outside but you know this
[15:22] message is beginning to grow greater and
[15:24] bigger and bigger and bigger till
[15:26] there's millions probably now there's
[15:29] probably a million believers in Africa
[15:31] alone by now and I'm not saying don't
[15:34] buy that's the point we're gonna get to
[15:37] is to try to talk about some of those
[15:41] things to where we can get an
[15:44] understanding what the Bible still is
[15:47] right and the Prophet said it was still
[15:49] right to say fear not little flock well
[15:53] now 1 million compared to 7 billion is a
[15:57] little small flock ok so don't run off
[16:01] with the wrong idea with me of what
[16:04] we're getting at but now when he said
[16:05] very few will believe all the way to
[16:10] receiving the Spirit of God right now
[16:14] you've got to believe that to be true
[16:16] and just remember now that in the days
[16:21] of Noah it was eight people compared to
[16:26] how many people was in the world in that
[16:28] day it's a modern civilization like now
[16:32] if it was 1 billion it would still be a
[16:35] great if it was 1 million that it was
[16:38] always in the days of Noah and eight
[16:41] people went over an ark that's very
[16:44] small he said well you're trying to tell
[16:48] us we ain't going we ain't going if we
[16:54] don't follow the line up in the way and
[16:57] follow the way God leads for us to go
[17:00] we're not going
[17:02] I didn't write the book to say in Jesus
[17:07] and when brother branham verifying it
[17:08] what when he said to Nicodemus be born
[17:11] again remember what he done he
[17:12] emphasized the word must
[17:16] he said not just the fact that you could
[17:18] or you order we hopefully you must be
[17:20] born again
[17:21] alright so then trying to hold that
[17:24] point that the only way I can approach
[17:28] it without crossing the things up of the
[17:32] way the Prophet says it and then we'll
[17:34] just let the Holy Spirit's gradually let
[17:36] things in order is I have to look at the
[17:39] Bible as a very big as it's laid out and
[17:42] it's written up here I tried to express
[17:44] that to you Wednesday night it's written
[17:46] to it if it's positive point you know
[17:51] all right
[17:52] the highest the positive then we as
[17:56] human beings we drop down into the
[17:59] elements of life and living and doing
[18:03] and somebody asked you a question
[18:07] they said to brother Branham let's see
[18:09] I've got it in here where the people you
[18:11] know at the college when they call for
[18:14] brother Branham to come and talk to him
[18:16] and the people that said we'll well
[18:18] brother Branham said we believe on the
[18:22] Lord Jesus Christ he said and you have
[18:25] Christ said but we want the Holy Ghost
[18:34] they had caught on enough to what was
[18:38] being said wasn't getting them where
[18:39] they was going I mean needed to go and
[18:42] they were wanting him to express it to
[18:44] him you know to tell him and he prayed
[18:48] for it or they received the baptism of
[18:49] the holy God
[18:50] all right see that's what I've tried to
[18:53] say to you and I to be serious about it
[18:56] if this is not no polite thing to play
[18:59] along to move let's go I'm not gonna say
[19:01] I'm not saved I say I'm not saying I'm
[19:03] not saved
[19:05] well what good does it do to say you're
[19:07] saved when you're not saved
[19:10] other than a positive confession that
[19:13] God can come on the scene to that
[19:14] confession yes but does it make it
[19:17] positive me just because it you believe
[19:22] it to be positive no it's the only
[19:24] positive when God answers now in case I
[19:28] miss it here's where we're going to go
[19:30] from here we're going to go from the
[19:32] very beginning the very smallest point
[19:35] we can drop to in life and Christianity
[19:39] and salvation and things like that and
[19:42] then we're going to be climbing upward
[19:46] to look at the baptism of the holy ghost
[19:50] that come under there Pentecost as a
[19:52] positive statement or thought alright
[19:57] now we'd have to admit we're somewhere
[20:00] in between right
[20:01] I mean I don't think we're wearing up
[20:05] over your honor I don't think we've made
[20:06] in the rapture yet or whatever but you
[20:08] know we could be up in the pyramid and
[20:11] be going that's great but we're still
[20:13] not in the place we need to be it
[20:14] doesn't matter where we're at all right
[20:16] so let's be serious about it and just
[20:20] try to to remember that looking at the
[20:27] Bible looking at the message then the
[20:30] new birth the born-again experience the
[20:32] baptism of the holy spirit is the one in
[20:34] the same the site they came on the day
[20:36] of Pentecost and that is the goal for
[20:39] the entire Church of Christ you know the
[20:43] body of believers for us to come all
[20:45] right now we're going to be I'm gonna
[20:47] have to lay this down this way
[20:50] that we won't get to it but I have the
[20:52] statements written out before me so
[20:55] don't just run off with it when we start
[20:58] talking about believing over here is a
[21:03] positive statement you can't believe
[21:07] without the baptism of the holy God
[21:09] no man can call Jesus the Christ so I
[21:16] know there's a vast gap between your
[21:19] mentor believing
[21:22] and a spiritual believing of the baptism
[21:25] of the holy ghost because what was our
[21:29] life statements in Wednesday night's
[21:31] message what is the new birth but around
[21:35] said the new birth and the baptisms are
[21:37] same and we talk about the baptism as
[21:41] being the Spirit of God eternal life you
[21:45] know Christ so the new birth
[21:48] what is it the Prophet then said what is
[21:50] the new birth he said it's a spirit
[21:53] across from mr. God revealed it's the
[21:54] Spirit of God baptizing this end of the
[21:56] body the person of Jesus Christ being
[22:00] revealed to me and you so the new birth
[22:03] is a person the baptism is a person and
[22:06] remember I've emphasized over and over
[22:08] we we talked about baptism see that's
[22:13] where I mind lost our mind as human
[22:16] beings are locked up on the word baptism
[22:21] and we relate that as being something
[22:24] coming from up above or something
[22:28] falling on us or our quoting the book of
[22:32] Acts where it said the room was filled
[22:37] right with that wouldn't the birth the
[22:42] birth was the lick of fire that said on
[22:45] each one of them that went inside now do
[22:48] you agree with that I don't want to say
[22:52] I know most of you ain't agreeing with
[22:53] because you won't even shake it yes or
[22:56] no but I don't see how you can argue the
[22:59] point see the experience of the coming
[23:03] of the Holy Ghost was the person of
[23:06] Jesus Christ coming in living into the
[23:08] people which was the pillar of fire the
[23:11] lick of fire guard dividing brother
[23:13] Branham said himself among the people
[23:15] the wind and all like that was like it
[23:18] was with the Prophet you remember Elijah
[23:20] he was all left under sunlight of things
[23:22] but the little still small voice is what
[23:27] God is attention alright so then the top
[23:30] didn't what we're talking about of the
[23:33] baptism on the day of Pentecost was what
[23:36] tongues of fire set up on each one of
[23:39] them signifying that the Holy Ghost was
[23:42] there in each one of them making the
[23:45] pillar of fire and what is the new birth
[23:48] to mean you would it not be that when
[23:56] you receive the new birth a tongue a
[23:59] lick of fire would come up on each one
[24:04] of us well I never saw it right that
[24:07] ain't gonna do it
[24:09] see you putting it on something that
[24:11] you're trying to require something I'm
[24:13] putting it on a simplicity of the way
[24:15] the prophet described it and what they
[24:17] say the new birth would he said it's the
[24:19] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[24:23] you you know what happened to end up a
[24:26] room am i right that jesus promised them
[24:33] the Holy Ghost will come upon you and
[24:37] what did he say it would do now what did
[24:41] he say what happened when the Holy Ghost
[24:42] would come we're over in the Matthew
[24:44] Mark Luke John he said it'll bring to
[24:48] your remembrance right so then they
[24:53] wrote the new birth is a revelation he
[24:55] said it'll bring to your remembrance
[24:56] whatsoever I've taught and watch it he
[25:01] said even teach you things to come
[25:06] brother Brandon said he not only taught
[25:09] him you know or revealed what dinner he
[25:11] said even reveal greater things to him
[25:13] now that's the Bible let's see we say
[25:17] baptism now listen I know the human mind
[25:21] we can handle the word new birth we can
[25:25] handle the word born-again but when you
[25:28] say baptism it's automatically our mind
[25:32] locks up to something coming from
[25:34] somewhere like raindrops not and it may
[25:38] happen that way I'm not saying it's not
[25:40] I'm trying to say the truth about it the
[25:45] room was filled
[25:52] but to win and only the things that
[25:55] happened it didn't go outside and teach
[25:58] them people when they said what must we
[26:00] do to be safe you got to go up in the
[26:01] upper room and wait let's great cloud
[26:03] come down you got to wait until all this
[26:05] great pillar you know of the clouds and
[26:08] all the rushing wind comes and you get
[26:11] it there was three thousands in little
[26:17] licks a fire lit on those people outside
[26:22] right we see we don't want to we still
[26:27] are locked and mine locks I know my
[26:29] dealers I'm trying to tell you I don't
[26:32] want no problem
[26:33] we're telling you what happened your
[26:35] mind locks with something like a pillar
[26:38] you know like a cloud coming like a
[26:40] mighty rushing wind and brother branham
[26:46] was standing there one day and a great
[26:49] rushing wind came by until his coattail
[26:51] brotherly veil we would listen him the
[26:53] other day talking about it he was darn
[26:54] solid so that those things happening but
[26:57] you know that didn't burn the body see
[27:09] if the prophets right he said what is
[27:13] the new birth brother branham chrysler
[27:15] mister god revealed then he answered it
[27:22] he says the revelation of Jesus Christ
[27:25] personally to you not that you shout it
[27:29] not you've done these things it's a
[27:33] revelation
[27:40] okay I can understand the bird being a
[27:42] revelation I can understand the board
[27:45] again but it's hard for me to understand
[27:47] brother Dale the baptism because we want
[27:50] a baptism we want something falling out
[27:54] of heaven and see that is where we're
[27:59] missing it come on I'm a hateful old
[28:06] dude but I'm try to get her truth across
[28:08] to you and I'm not saying for you to
[28:10] answer it but I'm asking you how many of
[28:13] you when you receive the new birth had
[28:15] this mighty rushing wind or this great
[28:17] thing happen all right now you solve
[28:30] your own problems I'm just trying to
[28:31] make a statement but see to every one of
[28:35] us we can it relate to the experience of
[28:39] the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a
[28:41] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[28:44] each and every one of us right that way
[28:47] one can shout one can cry one can do
[28:49] that why cuz that's the after-effects
[28:52] that's not the birth
[28:55] that's the after-effects of the birth
[28:58] all right
[29:00] see then looking at it and breaking it
[29:03] all across the top that's - that's your
[29:06] your straight line all right
[29:09] and then drop down to where we don't uh
[29:12] I remember a man preached a message
[29:15] years ago oh I won't call his name of
[29:19] this month somebody who may have
[29:21] listened to it but he called it the ones
[29:23] between and you know his thought was
[29:29] good I don't know what he meant but a
[29:32] lot of it because I remember I was young
[29:34] then but he was making it like they was
[29:38] a place for everybody well you know what
[29:42] there is in a respect if we believe it
[29:49] and we're going to approach this today
[29:52] from one point of just a point of
[29:57] believing believing
[30:09] and we're going to try to relate to that
[30:11] point of believing because that's what
[30:13] we've got the title you know we're from
[30:16] salvation to Redemption but the title is
[30:19] like cool being are believing unto all
[30:25] right because that's what we're going to
[30:27] be dealing with believing unto in other
[30:32] words believe it on two means one dying
[30:34] for sure it means one we started but two
[30:40] it means we're not where we're going
[30:43] right if you're believing unto that
[30:47] means you've started but it don't it
[30:49] means you're not dying
[30:51] now we can come back to that little word
[30:53] we used a lot in the study in studying
[30:56] in the Old Testament of potential
[31:01] because the potential is not a real
[31:04] thing but it's all the makings of that
[31:07] it just ain't into manifestation yet
[31:11] right so it's potential so then they the
[31:17] F brother branham that man did said you
[31:20] know at that college what do we hire he
[31:26] said you have the potential the man said
[31:32] what do you mean he said like you asked
[31:34] me for an oak tree and I'll give you an
[31:36] acorn or he said now in that when he
[31:38] described their corner corn they planted
[31:41] in it growing up and you know and being
[31:44] two shoots in the time all right now so
[31:48] think about it are you going to say I'm
[31:56] putting it back into your lap and you
[31:57] know because that's what everybody
[31:58] always does with me about it anyway are
[32:01] you going to say this church right over
[32:03] here those people are lost
[32:06] let's garden don't believe this message
[32:08] that was 70 doctors okay you know what I
[32:16] mean by they had just about what
[32:18] everybody bleeding 70 I mean you use
[32:21] get out of it so I don't have to explain
[32:27] that to some of you cause you're a star
[32:29] alright but now listen are you going to
[32:33] tell that those people are not believers
[32:48] are you going to say that away then so
[32:57] we're going to talk about believing unto
[33:04] which means that I said we've started
[33:07] but we haven't reached where we're going
[33:13] and we're going to talk about putting it
[33:18] cause I don't want to use the word too
[33:21] much but you know you can tell you use
[33:23] it you can use being warned again but
[33:26] remember being born again basically
[33:27] Peter you run your ex lot up to top and
[33:30] it's on my statue of a perfect man but
[33:31] now humanly speaking being born again is
[33:34] fine to be used you know it means you're
[33:38] in a process of something it simply
[33:40] means you've got started but you haven't
[33:42] reached your goal yet
[33:44] all right and see that's why brother
[33:47] Branham is so misunderstood because
[33:52] he'll make a statement and he'll be
[33:56] he'll go on preaching and he'll come
[34:00] around later maybe two or three messages
[34:02] and he'll say you know those people that
[34:04] believe so and so you know what he was
[34:14] one that said it
[34:21] but you know what he needed what he's
[34:23] talking about a lot of difference in
[34:27] knowing what you're talking about then
[34:30] running your mouth about what you think
[34:31] you know lot of difference in right
[34:35] he knew what he's talking about and he
[34:39] didn't mind saying if I've talked the
[34:42] truth now Lord you come and you honor
[34:45] the word I've talked right after he's
[34:51] done made quotes it sounds like wow you
[34:59] don't know what he's talking about cuz I
[35:02] remember where he said this is over here
[35:03] the other day
[35:04] see that's why that sister will get to
[35:07] it on blasphemous night she said brother
[35:09] branham the way you've taught it has
[35:15] made me to wonder whether I have though
[35:18] the baptism of the Holy Ghost or not she
[35:22] put it back to him because he'd the way
[35:25] he had told it and to take it I'll own
[35:29] it for you
[35:30] anybody wants to come over me I'd love
[35:32] for you dude to set out with me about
[35:33] two or three hours don't want to got
[35:35] laid on my desk and let me just pull the
[35:37] quote up say read that and read this
[35:40] read that read this I mean what brought
[35:43] around said not lay now cuz he say
[35:48] plenty of time
[35:49] you he said I can conclusively prove
[35:52] that you're born again and then baptized
[35:56] into the body and we already read
[36:02] Wednesday night we read it four or five
[36:07] pages from the church age book where
[36:10] brother Brandon says there's no two
[36:12] comings of the Spirit he said it's
[36:15] Father Son and Holy Ghost coming into
[36:17] you at one time he said there's no such
[36:23] thing he's saying I'm born again by the
[36:26] Spirit of God and then baptized the end
[36:28] of the body so now that run across the
[36:31] top
[36:33] there's you top now what about all these
[36:38] things down below that looked like he
[36:43] said okay what about it
[36:49] and we're gonna put these on here where
[36:51] the people understand what it I'm saying
[36:54] and running across the top line and then
[36:56] we'll go to the back of the message and
[36:58] then if we don't finish it to Wednesday
[37:00] I don't worry about it that's all right
[37:01] they don't have to pull these up he's
[37:03] just quotes we were using Wednesday
[37:05] night brother branham from the message
[37:07] expectations 1954 there's no to Holy
[37:10] Spirit's there's only one in the same
[37:14] Holy Spirit that gave Simeon that
[37:16] promise is the same Holy Spirit to
[37:18] drawed you out here tonight he goes into
[37:24] we read it for 150 for church age book
[37:27] that's the Father Son and Holy Ghost all
[37:29] coming in at the same time for it is one
[37:32] person comprising the Godhead that event
[37:35] took place at Pentecost there aren't two
[37:37] comings of the Spirit just one he said
[37:42] all of this row matter what you put out
[37:44] for Omega beginning the end and etc and
[37:46] all of them he said is just a
[37:48] description of the self one person you
[37:52] remember what we read Wednesday night
[37:53] said it would be better if everybody
[37:55] understood the oneness of the Godhead
[38:01] because what did he say it is a Father
[38:07] Son and Holy Ghost all coming in at one
[38:10] time for it is one person comprising the
[38:14] Godhead that Advent took place I done
[38:16] read them look reviewing back what we
[38:22] were talking about Windus t it was mass
[38:26] confusion when brother Branham wouldn't
[38:28] make an older call remember that one
[38:31] he'd make an all to call and people
[38:34] would come up and try to get to people
[38:36] that was dire to speak in tongues to do
[38:37] that that in the other and he said that
[38:40] wouldn't what he's trying to do
[38:41] he said what I mean is firm to come up
[38:44] and receive Christ the baptism of the
[38:47] Holy Ghost which is what happened
[38:49] under their Pentecost huh look he said I
[38:55] mean for the sinner to come forward and
[38:57] be born again which is to be baptized
[39:02] into the body of Christ by the Holy
[39:04] Ghost which is what took place at
[39:07] Pentecost when the church was launched
[39:09] in other words to be born to the Spirit
[39:12] it to be truly baptized with the Holy
[39:14] Ghost it is one of the sign tells you
[39:23] what constitutes the new birth
[39:28] justification bad sanctification baptism
[39:30] when old ago constitutes the new birth
[39:32] okay
[39:33] now the end to get on the life part of
[39:37] the basis written I said they wouldn't
[39:38] be able to pull it how many of them do
[39:42] you want like this
[39:44] the scripture says no man can say Jesus
[39:47] is the Christ only by the Holy Ghost so
[39:50] you cannot believe that Jesus is the
[39:52] Christ until you have received the
[39:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost how many of
[40:00] you need that see that's the end of the
[40:01] message what I'm showing you is the
[40:04] beginning of the message Jordan the top
[40:09] the end of the message shows the top now
[40:12] we back up in the middle and deal with
[40:14] potentially or whatever and god help me
[40:19] because this has been the worst thing to
[40:21] try to find a way to express what I want
[40:25] to express without it crossing in your
[40:28] mind and thoughts the word we can follow
[40:31] on all right what did we cover in the
[40:34] Old Testament we covered there was the
[40:38] salvation right there was a salvation in
[40:43] the Old Testament we didn't use the word
[40:44] Redemption because they would did not
[40:47] have the new birth all right so what
[40:50] they had was their points and thoughts
[40:53] were
[40:54] potentially they were potentially saved
[40:59] because they were under the blood of
[41:02] bulls and goats all right so they were
[41:09] saved they had a place to go to if they
[41:11] died all that and what did it start by
[41:14] number one it started by what this
[41:16] Hebrews says that no man can unless you
[41:20] wait a minute oh no you can't say that
[41:24] God is see you'll say was the Bible
[41:29] don't say God was vile says God is all
[41:32] right you got to believe that God is
[41:34] which means you got to believe he's real
[41:36] all right
[41:37] not he was so the Old Testament
[41:42] believers believed in a true God all
[41:48] right they believed he delivered he took
[41:50] her over he found her battles he done
[41:53] the things and they believed in a
[41:55] salvation so what they had started by
[41:58] believing well first that God is a
[42:03] rewarder of them that diligently even I
[42:06] know I see bruise but they've got they
[42:08] bad guy believed all right and they
[42:12] confessed and they say it and they they
[42:14] walked with God and God come on the
[42:16] scene and honored him and saved him and
[42:19] delivered him and made a place for them
[42:22] to go when they died you know a paradise
[42:25] although that was their salvation
[42:28] we're on so it started by man believing
[42:33] not great supernatural things to Abraham
[42:36] God just simply spoke to him and said
[42:39] Abraham get your wife your family and
[42:43] get up and leave
[42:47] well that be something with it going
[42:49] home tell your wife you know okay mom
[42:51] pack up where we're going I don't know
[42:55] what we gonna do I don't know
[42:59] rydym a true
[43:01] he was told to go to a place and he
[43:04] didn't know nothing about why he
[43:07] believed that God was speaking to him
[43:11] and it delivered him and the many things
[43:13] that was dark all right because he was a
[43:16] believer not a supernatural signs and
[43:22] wonders telling him study the book study
[43:24] the the Genesis account of Abraham sure
[43:30] he met God sure he done this that in the
[43:31] other with your Moses and some of them
[43:33] had greater experiences then Abraham did
[43:36] but abraham believed and that's why he's
[43:40] called the father of faith Moses is not
[43:42] called a father of faith abraham was
[43:45] because abraham believed well you know I
[43:47] ever have a plain old man bleak right it
[43:55] doesn't say now I'm saying that baby God
[43:58] dealt with him I'm just saying but it
[44:02] doesn't say anything about God dealt
[44:03] with him that God called him and he was
[44:06] a prophet or anything you know or
[44:08] ordained him or anything it just simply
[44:10] says all at once it just tells a little
[44:12] bit about this man Abram and it says
[44:15] that God said get up and go what are you
[44:20] a believer so that would put all of the
[44:23] New Testament I know you don't like me
[44:25] to make these statements but you know we
[44:26] preached Abraham was the father of faith
[44:28] in the Baptist Church where was y'all at
[44:33] no where was y'all that we preached to
[44:37] Abraham was the father of faith right
[44:42] you don't like that cuz he said well
[44:45] you're trying to make something off I'm
[44:46] telling you what brother Owen said it he
[44:49] said you've been Livie and Baptist alone
[44:51] with that word now I didn't say that
[44:53] statement he's what it did because
[44:57] that's what we've done
[44:57] see I didn't have Greer's almanac and
[45:00] all these other things to read I read
[45:02] the Bible and I'll tell you what I done
[45:06] they'd send out these things you know
[45:08] for us to teach Sunday School from you
[45:11] know little line up some scriptures
[45:13] inside I'd take their line of
[45:15] because I knew if I didn't they get on
[45:17] to me about it and say where are you
[45:20] getting that from
[45:21] so I'd read their scriptures and preach
[45:23] my story I just done it secretly I just
[45:28] I just used their cotton you know on
[45:30] their thoughts and that way they
[45:32] couldn't come along you ain't teaching
[45:33] what listen you know I am I read the
[45:35] scripture didn't it
[45:36] okay listen folks but when you come to
[45:42] the New Testament now the New Testament
[45:46] is totally based upon number one as the
[45:49] Old Testament was believing in a god
[45:51] that's real all right
[45:54] and that's believing now tried to
[46:03] express something to you because when I
[46:05] look at things and see it I look at a
[46:08] blank spot on in their thoughts and I
[46:10] say well the people are not gonna be
[46:12] able to cross over this over to here
[46:14] unless I put a little something in here
[46:16] you know in the thoughts and I tried to
[46:19] put a little thought in there about how
[46:22] that you know you and I we're believers
[46:29] all right and you start everything just
[46:33] simply in a believin manner just believe
[46:37] it it's not some great big supernatural
[46:41] time God doesn't come down and give you
[46:43] a revelation of Jesus Christ
[46:45] well that's you hearing it first right
[46:47] come on I mean you say I dip now do you
[46:51] all you want to the Bible said nobody
[46:54] can call Jesus the Christ because you're
[46:56] saying watch somebody else say it right
[46:59] so you know what 120 took them three and
[47:06] a half years you remember that you so
[47:13] what's that got to do with it
[47:14] that's got to do a lot with us cuz it
[47:16] took them three and a half years to get
[47:18] the baptism of the holy God but now
[47:21] there's pretty good believers wouldn't
[47:23] it they'd left everything and he done
[47:26] all kind of time
[47:28] and they finally came to the baptism of
[47:30] the Holy Ghost but then the second time
[47:35] coming of the Holy Ghost was the three
[47:38] thousand outside they heard words one
[47:43] sermon maybe they knew about Jesus maybe
[47:47] they knew about the different things
[47:48] well you know what go along ok what they
[47:53] heard worm sermon and went through
[47:55] justification sanctification the baptism
[47:57] in the Holy Ghost and got the new birth
[48:00] you agree with that the 3000 got the new
[48:05] birth the house it kunia it was just a
[48:11] little short time they got the new birth
[48:14] you counts in the Bible that they would
[48:17] just come forth and speak Allah and the
[48:19] new birth the Holy Ghost would fall on
[48:21] them but then you begin to see it
[48:26] gradually falling away then you would
[48:35] see people that Satan had penetrated the
[48:40] mind of mankind and started bringing
[48:42] these doctrines and ideas and you see
[48:44] the people as they that's penetrating
[48:50] them and they lose that I don't know how
[48:53] to express it I really don't know them
[48:55] but I know one thing they lost that
[48:57] ability to go through justification st.
[48:59] casing the baptism we'll all go at one
[49:01] time is it true now so it wound up being
[49:08] that that's why you had to have your
[49:10] Apostles than the things to write
[49:16] come on get one saying 3/5 at one
[49:23] hundred and twenty three and a half
[49:25] years the others one sermon canoeists
[49:29] one sermon now Peter and John and Paul
[49:35] O'Neill is going to how to start telling
[49:37] us about how to get born again
[49:42] and Peter tells it in in the scriptures
[49:47] about second Peter I believe it is one
[49:49] about the stature of a perfect man but
[49:52] remember that's a growth development in
[49:56] going upward that's not just a new birth
[49:59] the new birth has to come at the bottom
[50:02] of the pyramid where it says faith
[50:04] that's what your prophet said but you
[50:06] understand they not only could tell or
[50:09] Peter could tell about what would happen
[50:12] once you come but Paul and m's writings
[50:14] look at Paul go to the Corinthians and
[50:18] read the book of Corinthians Apollo
[50:22] dealing with them as babies when you
[50:26] need that somebody teach you the deep
[50:28] thing said we have to teach you the
[50:30] little what was he telling him he
[50:38] started telling them listen the devil
[50:42] had now entered into mankind he was
[50:47] loosed and now he's entered into mankind
[50:49] and he's teaching you wrong he said you
[50:57] already got it he said and he need this
[51:04] away do you understand her you might I
[51:10] think that's a valuable thing to
[51:12] anything but remember it takes you an
[51:20] eye I spent five years in the Baptist
[51:24] Church believing I was born again come
[51:27] in and hurt one or two messages in this
[51:29] message and I knew automatically I
[51:31] wasn't born again yet I was a deacon for
[51:35] three or four years in a Baptist Church
[51:36] I was teaching their adult Sunday School
[51:38] classes but there I was thinking it was
[51:45] all settled and I found out I didn't
[51:47] have it I'm not like most people most
[51:52] people in this message you know it
[51:53] through their
[51:54] only evidences they come into this
[51:57] message and they believe it well how
[52:00] come someone believes it 30 years and
[52:02] loses it come on how come they come in
[52:11] this message in your own fire for God
[52:13] for a little while in that while you see
[52:14] some doctrinal idea our situation takes
[52:18] them away and they take away great
[52:20] followers you know that's true some of
[52:28] you had never been out and listened to
[52:29] anything but talked to some of these
[52:31] it's been around a little bit but it'll
[52:33] work just why don't you have plain sins
[52:35] and just listen it shouldn't be anything
[52:41] to have to read a quote from brother
[52:43] Branham well you know you shouldn't have
[52:46] to read a quote from brother Branham to
[52:47] tell you the church begin to fall away
[52:51] until the church the bride wound up at
[52:55] Nicaea now I know you don't like that
[52:57] because there's a lot of people talk
[52:58] that's incorrect but you tell me brother
[53:00] Branham didn't say I'll show it to you
[53:05] they wound up at Nicaea and they came
[53:08] out of there sure they left because they
[53:11] left because they'd seen the wrong which
[53:14] you know what they brought out was
[53:16] little ideas and sayings it blinded the
[53:19] minds of the people do you understand
[53:22] what I'm talking about trying to give an
[53:23] illustration the 3,000 house the
[53:26] Keneally's Holy Ghost falling in the
[53:28] book of Acts on people just heard one or
[53:30] two messages and you see a few years
[53:32] later hauling them struggling trying to
[53:36] get people to come to Christ and trying
[53:38] to explain in the Corinthians especially
[53:41] called it's called the book of
[53:42] Corrections right
[53:51] to get them to a new birth why because
[54:00] Satan had entered man so much until
[54:02] these no longer live then you'd have to
[54:05] teach justification sanctification and
[54:09] the baptism of the holy ghost to get
[54:11] mankind safe well we don't need to know
[54:13] about that
[54:14] all we need to know just get saved well
[54:18] how you gonna get saved well I didn't
[54:27] believe justice ain't a better lawyer I
[54:29] got it you didn't believe in if you're
[54:32] saying it that way I'm gonna doubt you
[54:34] got it because how can you doubt
[54:36] anything in God's Word and say you've
[54:39] got it now you tell me that and I'm
[54:41] sorry the most plain this can be but I'm
[54:45] blowing on that because I experienced it
[54:50] and I experienced justification and
[54:53] sanctification in a Baptist Church
[54:57] brother Branham didn't have to tell me
[54:59] to quit smoking drinking and chewing
[55:07] well when I got saved I quit that chew
[55:10] in the back I could I supposed to go out
[55:13] at repentance especially a
[55:15] sanctification but you see what I'm
[55:20] talking about the great Apostle Paul
[55:22] winds up having to try to tell people
[55:24] how to get born again and it starts
[55:31] taking time a lot now how much one more
[55:34] was that when it was lost the things
[55:36] Paul and him talk faith of the fathers
[55:40] now in quoting brother Branham so go
[55:42] ahead faith of the fathers why stood as
[55:44] far as you talking about in the church
[55:46] and working to about the fourth age when
[55:49] you come up through there with Martin
[55:50] and Columba in the at least had to line
[55:55] up correctly and was teaching the statue
[55:59] of a perfect man but what about when you
[56:03] dropped over to Lutheran West
[56:05] just barely a repentance right until
[56:11] brother branham would say they just had
[56:14] justification if he said potentially you
[56:16] need that one you need the ones where
[56:19] brother Ron will called out Lutheran
[56:20] Westland in potential they lent him a
[56:24] death but listen what are you trying to
[56:29] say brother Dale I'm trying to say one
[56:31] time it went from a basics of nobility
[56:38] to bring a person to Christ as just you
[56:43] know a message and now when it comes to
[56:52] Christ in one message well I did I come
[56:59] across
[57:00] yeah and how long is it took you to get
[57:01] rid of the devil out of your life after
[57:03] there I like people to write little
[57:07] things like a brother wrote and he said
[57:09] I got teary eyed and then found out it
[57:14] in that comes a lot I like them things
[57:22] see I'll keep on preaching this until we
[57:24] either get it or get out of one but you
[57:29] understand do you understand what I'm
[57:31] meaning are you gonna tell the religious
[57:35] world if they're lost brother brought
[57:36] him didn't he would bring it to a final
[57:42] analysis right that if you have the new
[57:46] birth you will come into this message or
[57:50] hear the message what Rocko's God will
[57:52] lead you well we've been through the
[57:55] seventies and the things like that to
[57:57] work that there's preaching well more
[57:58] bless God field believe everything you
[58:00] love
[58:07] then it was love so much until you can't
[58:10] even get the people of this message not
[58:12] a priest justification sanctification
[58:14] the baptismal old ago oh we're up so
[58:16] much resonated above there until we're
[58:18] out into the great headstone in the in
[58:21] the things well I'll just stay where the
[58:26] Lord leads me because this is what I've
[58:30] always told I've always taught the new
[58:33] birth I always thought we got to have it
[58:35] always talked it's got to be
[58:37] justification st. casing the baptism of
[58:39] the Holy Ghost to come to that place
[58:41] I've always talked and believing it's
[58:44] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in every
[58:45] church age go that's where your prophet
[58:47] told one of this brother so-and-so said
[58:51] it wasn't that will go a brother
[58:53] so-and-so Duong but listen just give me
[59:03] a minute this to talk with that little
[59:04] foundation what about when your prophet
[59:10] would say they see if I can pick up the
[59:15] message go ahead brother let's pick up
[59:20] we go to number 11 we're gonna be
[59:23] dropping back on to some other things
[59:25] we'll go over to number 11 which is the
[59:28] message why are people so talked about
[59:31] and let's think about it this is one
[59:33] message you need to listen to I've asked
[59:35] you to listen you must be born again
[59:37] this is one that goes with it already
[59:39] Intervale all of it goes with it but
[59:41] listen to what he says okay
[59:48] listen to your prophet see I believe
[59:53] that you believe into everlasting life I
[59:57] believe that your acceptance of the Lord
[1:00:06] Jesus Christ gives you everlasting life
[1:00:08] eternal life when you believe it then I
[1:00:17] believe by one spirit you're baptized
[1:00:24] into the body of believers come on are
[1:00:33] you reading
[1:00:34] I believe you can eternal life by you
[1:00:38] believing I believe that you then are
[1:00:44] baptized into the body of believers
[1:00:45] we're gonna get to it in a few minutes
[1:00:47] he said you believe unto life see your
[1:00:53] faith anchors you in Christ
[1:00:56] that's intellectual you believe it you
[1:01:01] accept it you say to this right you
[1:01:04] recognize it to be the truth and you're
[1:01:07] a Christian and you got everlasting life
[1:01:10] by believing it you've entered to God
[1:01:13] you're on the count ground man that's
[1:01:16] falling and you're eating it to remember
[1:01:18] way to the day camp ground out of
[1:01:21] cortisone count ground is just
[1:01:22] justification yeah no all right
[1:01:36] that seems to be contrary to where he
[1:01:42] was bringing out in the church age book
[1:01:44] it is all in one thing not just the king
[1:01:49] saying things bad here the whole dose
[1:01:51] but receiving the new birth and the
[1:01:55] baptism the whole ghost all shine now
[1:02:01] what are you going to say
[1:02:07] that's what makes me sick about these
[1:02:09] ministers you could take the truth of
[1:02:13] the message to try to express something
[1:02:15] and if the people would listen it would
[1:02:18] bring out truth but they won't listen to
[1:02:19] that because they've done been so Talde
[1:02:22] until they just they're not gonna do
[1:02:24] that what about it
[1:02:28] what about this drop back to number nine
[1:02:34] the message called hidden life 1956 it
[1:02:42] depends on where your faith stands your
[1:02:47] salvation is good as long as your
[1:02:50] confession is good but when your
[1:02:55] confession drops then your salvation is
[1:02:59] gone for he is the high priest sitting
[1:03:08] at the right hand of God to make
[1:03:09] intercession on your confession that's
[1:03:12] what happens that's exactly right
[1:03:19] shake your head at me whatever you want
[1:03:22] to that's exactly right
[1:03:27] right the way I believe it okay so I
[1:03:31] wonder why it is then when salvation and
[1:03:34] healing also that people will come at
[1:03:37] this low ebb now I want to say that the
[1:03:40] reason of it is I believe I can explain
[1:03:43] it to you if you'll be reverent and
[1:03:45] listen
[1:03:45] Sokol listen the rest of it he's trying
[1:03:48] to explain how we misunderstand the
[1:03:50] Christian life are you gonna say that
[1:03:56] statements not true because it's made it
[1:03:59] depends on where your faith stains your
[1:04:01] salvation is as good as your confession
[1:04:04] is good but when your confessions draw
[1:04:07] confession drops then your salvation is
[1:04:10] gone
[1:04:17] now if you'd listened to months ago or
[1:04:23] so when I started on salvation I told
[1:04:26] you I chose the specific reason for
[1:04:30] using the word salvation
[1:04:32] instead of Redemption I said one day
[1:04:38] I'll explain why I used the point of
[1:04:43] salvation instead of calling it
[1:04:46] Redemption you can be in salvation and
[1:04:52] working and going and lose it but you
[1:04:57] can't be regained and losing right you
[1:05:03] can't be redeemed and lose it
[1:05:06] which isn't how salvation and loses it's
[1:05:10] what your prophet said now there's more
[1:05:12] than that but that's enough I thought I
[1:05:18] understood when you've confused me good
[1:05:19] maybe I confuse you enough to you start
[1:05:21] worrying about God whether whether or
[1:05:23] not you're born again just remember I'm
[1:05:30] going quote brother Branham over and
[1:05:32] over he said if you are born again you
[1:05:34] will always agree with the word yeah but
[1:05:41] that's the way you read oh I didn't I
[1:05:42] didn't say it I just copied this out of
[1:05:44] her off the computer of what he said I
[1:05:48] didn't say this well you just pick that
[1:05:52] out well I'll pick out the whole page
[1:05:54] and read if you want me to I'm just
[1:05:59] trying to tell you we think we know what
[1:06:01] we're talking about but do we do we even
[1:06:05] know simply what the new birth is now
[1:06:13] I've done laid out two things lately on
[1:06:14] it do you understand it brother Brown
[1:06:16] said two new birth is a revelation of
[1:06:21] Jesus Christ personally to you
[1:06:25] not you shouted cried done each time he
[1:06:28] said it's in Revelation so now do you
[1:06:30] believe the new March is a revelation no
[1:06:39] no no I thanks the baptism see and what
[1:06:48] a wonderful thought that the revelation
[1:06:53] of God can so baptize us the revelation
[1:07:04] of God can fill our very being with the
[1:07:08] person of Jesus Christ you're shouting
[1:07:12] you're crying and things like edit all
[1:07:13] after-effects you still hung you're
[1:07:17] still not following it in other words if
[1:07:23] I made a statement I said okay now let's
[1:07:25] see how many of you would state behind
[1:07:27] me the new birth is the born-again
[1:07:32] experience it's the it's the baptizing
[1:07:35] you into the body and it is a revelation
[1:07:44] done you just done it you just dozed off
[1:07:51] right into I done shouted Christ poking
[1:07:55] down you're still on that you're not
[1:07:59] listening to the Prophet he said the new
[1:08:03] birth was a revelation now you want this
[1:08:07] one
[1:08:08] you cannot be saved
[1:08:11] I saw Revelation chapter 5 I believe it
[1:08:15] and got it
[1:08:16] he said you cannot be saved without a
[1:08:19] revelation maybe you didn't get the new
[1:08:32] birth Oh
[1:08:37] he said you can't be saved without a
[1:08:40] revelation but do we believe that - ha I
[1:08:50] used to understand everything nothing
[1:08:52] you just confused me why what did I say
[1:08:58] it was confusing I told you what the
[1:09:00] prophets say what did you think when you
[1:09:02] read that in the book oh well let me
[1:09:04] tell you like it is let me tell you what
[1:09:07] she done we needs reading the book you
[1:09:10] turned real feist over that page brother
[1:09:15] tight him he he life and tell he said
[1:09:18] when he got to beginning to see the
[1:09:20] water baptism name of the Lord Jesus
[1:09:21] Christ he said I'd be reading my Bible
[1:09:24] now this is what he said he's not being
[1:09:26] reading my BA he said I come to acts
[1:09:27] 2:30 he's I just turned over real fast
[1:09:30] well the man was honest he saw a
[1:09:34] confusion but then when God revealed it
[1:09:44] that's why people can't follow this
[1:09:49] message this message is the revelation
[1:09:53] of Jesus Christ are you willing enough
[1:10:00] to admit that this message that's why
[1:10:05] they ain't a headstone to come out of
[1:10:07] glory this message is the headstone am I
[1:10:16] getting a church a book where he said
[1:10:17] about - the headstone coming with the
[1:10:20] baptism when the Holy Ghost the hitch
[1:10:22] don't be in the revealed Word I
[1:10:30] but I just don't I can't I can't follow
[1:10:33] yes can I get all confused well why
[1:10:36] don't you go ask God to open up your
[1:10:37] confusion and come tell me I don't want
[1:10:43] your brother dead I believe it don't
[1:10:46] right you think I'm was that yeah you're
[1:10:49] right brother you Creighton me out the
[1:10:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost is raindrops
[1:10:53] falling out of heaven or some experience
[1:10:56] or some happening ain't no need him
[1:10:59] coming to my office when you're talking
[1:11:00] like that we're gonna talk about what
[1:11:04] brother branham say we're gonna say
[1:11:08] brother Branham said it was a revelation
[1:11:09] now what do you got to say see that's
[1:11:14] where people you're not gonna follow it
[1:11:16] brother mocap telling me he said brother
[1:11:20] Dale they something said I know you he
[1:11:26] said you are not seeking signs wonders
[1:11:29] etc as a proof of the old ago you're
[1:11:33] exactly right but I'm not content with
[1:11:37] what I've got
[1:11:40] this was his statement he said you stop
[1:11:44] trying to figure out these things and
[1:11:48] accept God's Word which his word is God
[1:11:57] in letter form and said you believe
[1:12:04] God's Word and that was their words what
[1:12:13] you gonna say brother Dale I'm gonna say
[1:12:14] like the old brother did that picked up
[1:12:16] the track I'm gonna say you know I went
[1:12:19] here and I went there I did I went all
[1:12:21] over this for two years in this man see
[1:12:23] I had everybody in the mess he's praying
[1:12:24] for me any word they give over to call
[1:12:27] I'd be a novel to call for the baptism
[1:12:29] with Oh God like the old brother said do
[1:12:35] you mean to tell me brother branham I
[1:12:36] had it all the time now we can back up
[1:12:39] to trying to get an evidence of your
[1:12:41] whether or not which then you believe in
[1:12:42] the word what
[1:12:44] brought you where you are why don't you
[1:12:49] go back in your experience and watch
[1:12:50] your life and see I was here and I was
[1:12:54] here and brother crossed my path and
[1:12:55] this happened that way that happened
[1:12:57] that way and I heard this message and I
[1:12:59] heard the word I heard heard greater
[1:13:00] depth I heard from the Baptist I heard
[1:13:02] the Pentecostals and I heard I believe
[1:13:04] in that because you see I believe and
[1:13:09] still believe it's getting very rare but
[1:13:11] I still believe them denominations can
[1:13:14] produce a new birth
[1:13:18] but I also believe the rest of the
[1:13:20] message what the Prophet said they ain't
[1:13:23] gonna you ain't gonna stay there with
[1:13:25] the new birth and they didn't run me out
[1:13:28] I walked out of my own accord because I
[1:13:34] knew that it wouldn't hide most of you
[1:13:39] ain't got over the statement I read from
[1:13:41] brother Branham yet letter owner said
[1:13:44] there was nine hundred different ways of
[1:13:47] talking about salvation and he said
[1:13:51] they're wrong now I told you that that
[1:13:55] statements gonna hit you in the face
[1:13:58] that nine hundred different ways of
[1:14:01] seeing a new birth and he said but
[1:14:03] they're wrong he said well you just said
[1:14:08] to him not yes sir I believe you can
[1:14:11] preach justification sanctification to
[1:14:12] baptism on the whole go and a Baptist
[1:14:14] Church today and people can receive
[1:14:16] Jesus Christ they're not gonna stay
[1:14:21] there how do you know that goes that
[1:14:23] goes I didn't not so problem I didn't
[1:14:26] and you can't how can you stay there
[1:14:30] when it's contrary to the word what
[1:14:36] about a church you start your eternal
[1:14:41] life now I won't give you up just a
[1:14:43] minute and then quit we'll pick it up
[1:14:44] Wednesday you start your eternal life by
[1:14:47] believing now you ain't listening your
[1:14:54] eternal life starts when you believe it
[1:14:56] I didn't say you had it I didn't say you
[1:15:00] had to end of it I said it started when
[1:15:05] you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ now
[1:15:11] listen I'm quoting brother Branham truly
[1:15:13] believe not make believe he said when
[1:15:20] you truly believe not make believe he
[1:15:24] said your eternal life begins right dark
[1:15:31] he said well what do I got
[1:15:33] you got it potentially keep on believing
[1:15:39] because I told the Baptist preacher this
[1:15:42] when I was leaving out right prior to
[1:15:46] that I said how come you told us that
[1:15:49] all we had to do was believe and we had
[1:15:50] the new birth see they they knew better
[1:15:54] there try to so I we didn't he started
[1:15:57] off in we didn't I said hold it just a
[1:15:58] minute now you talking about this doctor
[1:16:01] in his teaching that you get the Holy
[1:16:03] Ghost when you believe is that right he
[1:16:05] said yeah I said well okay why don't you
[1:16:08] teach it that way they said well we try
[1:16:11] to do the word I said we didn't how come
[1:16:12] you left this scripture out the
[1:16:14] scripture says he that believeth and is
[1:16:18] baptized shall be saved I said you
[1:16:20] always read it he that believes in his
[1:16:23] baptized I said doesn't say it and said
[1:16:27] he that believeth which is continuation
[1:16:33] that's why Paul could pick them up over
[1:16:35] there nopales and say have you received
[1:16:39] the Holy Ghost since you believed you
[1:16:44] don't get the Holy Ghost without
[1:16:46] believing can't you see then your
[1:16:53] experience can't you follow your
[1:16:55] experience instead of the signs and the
[1:16:58] wonders and the sensations and the thing
[1:17:00] look at where God had led you and what
[1:17:02] he's led you to I don't have my
[1:17:06] experience than anybody in this message
[1:17:09] in my experience I just explained it was
[1:17:15] when I realized God and His Word is one
[1:17:19] and if he has revealed himself to me
[1:17:22] then he's living in me darzee new birth
[1:17:30] it starts when you believe now can can
[1:17:38] we read this message again now when you
[1:17:42] first heard or believed mama taught you
[1:17:45] you don't have to believe this message
[1:17:46] not all that you know he went to church
[1:17:48] or whatever you heard and something
[1:17:51] struck you remember we read the
[1:17:56] scripture Jesus said you can't come to
[1:17:59] me unless the father draws me right so
[1:18:04] can you remember when God draws you to
[1:18:10] be real careful right here because the
[1:18:13] Bible says many are called but a few
[1:18:18] were chosen
[1:18:19] what's the problem why is it many are
[1:18:23] called fewer children how come he's just
[1:18:25] a few chosen because there's only a few
[1:18:27] that believed now Judas come on can I
[1:18:31] quote brother Randall Judas believed the
[1:18:35] rest said he went through judge thanks
[1:18:36] Jason
[1:18:37] he said he cast out devil you know heal
[1:18:39] the sick I don't remember where you were
[1:18:41] cast out Devils for Judas but it's awful
[1:18:43] da Levin did but he said he healed the
[1:18:45] sick and the things like that but then
[1:18:48] one day his believing stopped he stopped
[1:18:53] believing that that man was who he was
[1:18:56] and when he did he lost his salvation
[1:19:00] why because he didn't have an upward he
[1:19:03] didn't have an upper room experience
[1:19:05] that's what brother Ron said he showed
[1:19:06] his colors he didn't go to the upper
[1:19:09] room and receive had he went to the
[1:19:11] upper room and received the baptism in
[1:19:12] the Holy Ghost he'd been in the body of
[1:19:13] Christ so if you hold this to Wednesday
[1:19:20] night okay
[1:19:22] you start believing just don't stop
[1:19:27] believing
[1:19:28] don't let anything hinder that believing
[1:19:31] I remember when I first heard this
[1:19:42] message and the Prophet you know brother
[1:19:46] mode had brought me the message of the
[1:19:48] Prophet and I I would sit down and come
[1:19:53] in home at 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning
[1:19:55] and I'd sit down at the table and I'd
[1:19:57] read a while I remember sitting I read
[1:20:00] one morning and I said Lord all this
[1:20:05] seems to be totally contrary to
[1:20:07] everything that we've ever been taught
[1:20:11] all I want to do is just ask you to be
[1:20:14] kind enough to me just understand
[1:20:17] just understand me and understand my
[1:20:20] ways and where I'm at Lord I want to be
[1:20:24] right and I want to follow you I said I
[1:20:29] want to know if this man was the prophet
[1:20:32] of God and that I can study his message
[1:20:35] from the basis of knowing he was a
[1:20:37] prophet I got one answer and every time
[1:20:44] I to ask him again I got the same answer
[1:20:47] no matter how many more times I asked
[1:20:52] him I got the same answer do you know
[1:20:55] what it was said
[1:21:04] what does the word say if I ask him
[1:21:09] today for an answer that's what he'd say
[1:21:12] what does the word say you know that
[1:21:15] settled with me tell me you'd call that
[1:21:18] see new birth I settled it with me he
[1:21:25] said what does the word say it's just
[1:21:27] like an inward thought come to him
[1:21:29] you're not an audible voice up in heaven
[1:21:31] or whatever it was just a thought see
[1:21:34] what does the word say what could I say
[1:21:38] see I had read the word I knew it like I
[1:21:41] told you when I read it and when I saw
[1:21:46] Malachi 3 in Malachi 4 I told my office
[1:21:49] and there'll be two prophets coming
[1:21:50] before the end of time because the Bible
[1:21:53] said it then I could handle John in his
[1:21:57] you know John the bad news I could
[1:21:59] handle that and Luke 1:17 up through
[1:22:02] that away in Luke to where it was
[1:22:04] speaking of him coming I could handle
[1:22:05] that and knew that brother boat said
[1:22:10] well what about a prophet I said where's
[1:22:12] it at he said Malikov for I said before
[1:22:16] you start much on that let's talk about
[1:22:18] this and who's Malachi 3 he says John
[1:22:23] the Baptist thank God I run into
[1:22:26] somebody that knew the word prophet you
[1:22:30] don't believe it the Prophet you gonna
[1:22:32] be left no he just told me what the word
[1:22:35] say when he finished explaining Malachi
[1:22:41] 3 understand I knew the Scriptures are
[1:22:43] they the Bible plainly tells you mother
[1:22:45] got three it Luke's 117 right through
[1:22:48] that area he said now there's Malachi 4
[1:22:57] okay we deal that you see Church I was a
[1:23:03] believer my believing didn't stop my
[1:23:07] believing they listened let's be honest
[1:23:09] my believing wavered a lot you won't be
[1:23:13] honest
[1:23:14] oh no I believe when I'm 30
[1:23:17] be aware of it I'm just gonna tell your
[1:23:20] lawyer that selves a problem with an
[1:23:22] argue point now the human mind wouldn't
[1:23:26] allow you to do that you know what I'm
[1:23:28] talking about when we read the word we
[1:23:30] wavered is this riders just wrong or
[1:23:33] what is there for what is that but I did
[1:23:36] it hold on they just kept on going and
[1:23:44] see I didn't have the baptism of the
[1:23:46] Holy Ghost yet I had seen God standing
[1:23:50] in the church at 11 years old and I've
[1:23:52] seen great things happen in a Baptist
[1:23:54] Church we bleed and praying for the sick
[1:23:56] I remember Wade he used to have talks
[1:24:03] was real bad just right after we come
[1:24:04] into message and tonsils were real bad
[1:24:07] he was just and they wouldn't take him
[1:24:08] out and you know there's so many cases
[1:24:09] with et cetera et cetera
[1:24:10] no brother tied him they were there and
[1:24:13] we came home from church and then had to
[1:24:16] stay home with Wade and we came home and
[1:24:19] then he'd have to take a bottle of you
[1:24:23] know like gallon jugs or something put
[1:24:25] ice and lay it aside his temperature was
[1:24:27] so high and we said you know we talked
[1:24:32] about it and we prayed and he'd go up
[1:24:35] and down I'm talking about real high to
[1:24:37] the burning up we went to the doctor's
[1:24:41] office on the way up I said Lord all I
[1:24:46] want to ask is one thing will you take
[1:24:49] away this temperature before the doctor
[1:24:53] gives me anything or does anything to it
[1:24:55] we walk in the doctor's office the
[1:24:59] doctor had come and medicines office
[1:25:01] were these fancy doctors but he was our
[1:25:04] children doctor so he came to the office
[1:25:06] room it was a Sunday
[1:25:09] he came out and medicine we walked in
[1:25:13] the door got just inside the door and
[1:25:15] Wade cut loose and vomited all over that
[1:25:18] place I was apologizing to doctor I'm
[1:25:23] sorry I know you don't have it just
[1:25:25] cleaned up you know we'll do what we can
[1:25:27] do he said don't worry about it said
[1:25:29] they'll clean it up he with this what he
[1:25:30] said he
[1:25:31] take him on back home he's alright but
[1:25:36] we just went on back home
[1:25:39] we believed Church this is it depends on
[1:25:50] where your faith stands when you're in
[1:25:55] that believing stage or just starting
[1:25:57] believing and coming up to the new bar
[1:25:58] where that he can come in you and
[1:26:00] believe you cuz now listen it's not you
[1:26:03] believing when he comes in you
[1:26:04] it's him believing it right there's a
[1:26:10] long journey in between that believe in
[1:26:13] Park you have to be careful because you
[1:26:18] can quit believing now that you get born
[1:26:22] again after you get the seal of God and
[1:26:24] I've even got it where brother Brown
[1:26:25] says you can believe until you're sealed
[1:26:27] in I mean you're believing until you're
[1:26:29] sealed in he said once you're sealed in
[1:26:32] it ain't you believing so now we've got
[1:26:35] a long ways to go but a whole lot of
[1:26:37] doing but listen your salvation is good
[1:26:42] as long as your confession is good but
[1:26:50] when your confession drops then your
[1:26:54] salvation is gone did he's the high
[1:26:59] priest that make us intercession upon
[1:27:03] our confession well I never thought
[1:27:06] about it like that
[1:27:08] alright think about it come on musician
[1:27:12] think about it you believe unto what is
[1:27:22] that is it's a scripture or which one is
[1:27:24] I believe this know where somebody said
[1:27:26] I believe to see your that maybe he's
[1:27:29] good you know how to see to believe I
[1:27:32] believe to see scripture yeah don't stop
[1:27:39] you believing
[1:27:43] there's two ways of anchoring into a
[1:27:45] problem and messing it up and the basics
[1:27:50] of us went back to where we believed and
[1:27:52] said that's it when I got it and forget
[1:27:57] over here where do you need to receive
[1:28:00] it
[1:28:02] see everybody oh it's anchored on I
[1:28:05] believe I got it
[1:28:06] I pray that that's true but I may have
[1:28:16] to quote the Prophet where he said very
[1:28:20] few will if you're believing down
[1:28:27] through there you know yourself is gonna
[1:28:29] waver don't lie to me ain't lying to you

[1:28:43] waves preaching another day or the outer
[1:28:45] court from a message on the inner veil

[1:28:53] outer court you got the sunlight when
[1:28:58] it's cloudy you don't have no ups and
