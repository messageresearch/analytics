[23:14] one of you here. And what what we're
[23:16] going to do is now we're going to call
[23:17] brother Scott out and let him just pour
[23:20] his heart out.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; Preach what the Lord's put on. I don't
[23:24] want him to preach.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:26] &gt;&gt; I want the Lord to preach. And I believe
[23:28] he's got a gift that he'll use.
[23:30] &gt;&gt; And I believe our brother's going to
[23:32] give us the words of eternal life
[23:33] tonight
[23:34] &gt;&gt; as we come up to the end of this year.
[23:37] 54 years we've had these watch night
[23:41] services. When this church started in
[23:43] 1971, July the 4th,
[23:46] that year we had a watch night service.
[23:49] And from that year till now, 54 years,
[23:52] the church will be here 55 years if the
[23:54] Lord carries this coming July. And uh
[23:57] brother Ernest Moat was a p our first
[23:59] pastor which is uh Joyce's Charlotte's
[24:02] dad. And u then my dad was a pastor here
[24:06] for about 45 years until the Lord took
[24:08] him home. And uh and God give me grace
[24:10] with the people to uh to continue on uh
[24:13] preaching for the for the people here.
[24:15] So we love you with the love of the Lord
[24:17] and we thank you for all that you give
[24:18] us. Thanks for the food downstairs. Now,
[24:20] what we're going to do is we're going to
[24:21] have Brother Scott come out, preach as
[24:23] long as he wants to, and then we'll take
[24:25] like a 10-minute break. Run downstairs,
[24:27] don't sit and eat, but go downstairs, go
[24:28] to the bathroom, get you a little drink
[24:30] or something, and come back up here. And
[24:31] then we'll start and we'll have all
[24:33] specials. And if you have a testimony on
[24:35] your heart, we'll have plenty of time
[24:37] for testimonies. Right about midnight or
[24:39] somewhere there close to it, we will
[24:41] take communion. No footwashing, but
[24:43] we'll take communion right at midnight.
[24:45] While the world's doing their thing,
[24:47] we're going to do our thing. And we've
[24:49] been doing this thing for 54 years. And
[24:51] the Lord has really blessed us. And uh
[24:53] he's given us another year. And uh as
[24:56] brother Boyd was saying, you know, look,
[24:57] reflect back on what this past year's
[25:00] over.
[25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:01] &gt;&gt; All right. The new year's coming up.
[25:03] Let's live closer to God than we've ever
[25:04] lived before.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; Make that your New Year's resolutions is
[25:08] to live closer to the Lord than you've
[25:09] ever lived before. Because you know
[25:10] what? It's closer to his coming than
[25:12] ever before.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:14] &gt;&gt; No doubt. Look at what's going on in the
[25:15] in in the land. Look at what's going on
[25:17] in the world.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; We're going to see some things in 2026,
[25:20] I believe, that we've never seen before.
[25:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[25:23] &gt;&gt; But it'll be prophecy and it'll be
[25:25] fulfilled. And we listen, we've already
[25:27] read the newspaper.
[25:29] &gt;&gt; We don't need to go on the internet,
[25:30] find out what's going to happen next.
[25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:32] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[25:33] &gt;&gt; We've already been told what's going to
[25:34] happen. We know what's going to happen.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God told us what was
[25:38] going to happen years and years ago. So,
[25:39] we're just living in it now. living the
[25:42] prophecy, becoming the word of God, and
[25:45] then we're gonna get out of here, and
[25:47] then we won't have to do this anymore.
[25:48] We'll have a we'll have a uh a watch
[25:51] night service every day
[25:53] &gt;&gt; cuz it won't be no end. Everything will
[25:55] be just perfect.

[26:50] with God's own heart.

[28:48] for, God. Just to speak to our hearts.
[28:51] And it's just an honor to be here. Amen.
[28:54] Just good to be here. and uh Brother
[28:57] Wade, we've known him for some time and
[29:00] uh we finally we've been coming for
[29:02] years honestly and and uh we've we're
[29:04] finally here and uh we uh saw a Dollar
[29:09] General back down the road and we felt
[29:11] right at home. We've got them about
[29:14] every 10 ft where we're at. Uh, we felt
[29:18] right at home till then we passed a
[29:19] Dollar General market
[29:22] and then I said, "They're a little more
[29:24] upscale here than we are." We we hadn't
[29:27] we hadn't got that far yet, but uh uh
[29:31] maybe it's coming.
[29:33] Uh praise the Lord. So, just an honor to
[29:36] be here. Good to see you. There's some
[29:38] familiar faces. Brother Aaron Roberts
[29:41] there has blessed our church several
[29:44] times and just was there not long ago.
[29:47] So, it's always good to see him. He he
[29:50] you already know this, I believe, but
[29:52] he's he's a tarill at heart
[29:55] &gt;&gt; and or a tarill at birth and uh uh so uh
[30:00] we've got claims on him in North
[30:02] Carolina and uh but we we love him and
[30:05] his family and just uh praise the Lord.
[30:08] It's just going to be wonderful to to uh
[30:11] to go into the new year with you.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh we can say we were here in
[30:17] 25 and 26. Brother Way, praise the Lord.
[30:21] Let's take our Bibles out and uh he told
[30:25] me not to look at any clocks tonight.
[30:28] So, um, we'll try to to honor pastor's
[30:32] wishes,
[30:34] um, this evening, but let's go to a real
[30:37] familiar portion of scripture. Luke the
[30:39] 17th chapter. Luke the 17th chapter.
[30:58] Maybe we'll just start about verse 30
[31:01] this evening. Luke 17 and
[31:06] 30. Luke 17 is
[31:10] certainly a identifying
[31:13] um chapter
[31:15] &gt;&gt; uh for our day and and uh we're no
[31:18] strangers to it. So Luke chap 17 and
[31:23] verse 30.
[31:27] Maybe we just bow our heads as we begin
[31:30] here this evening. Father, we thank you
[31:33] Lord for just uh God allowing us to be
[31:36] here this evening, Lord. And Father,
[31:39] just bringing each one, oh God, to come
[31:43] to the house of God. No greater place
[31:45] tonight that we could be. and Lord, a
[31:48] place that we could come and Lord bring
[31:50] in the the new year, Lord, as Lord, as
[31:54] believers tonight. And Father, we just
[31:56] ask now that you'd Lord, come move me
[31:59] aside. And Father, that you would speak
[32:01] to our hearts tonight, Lord. God, I pray
[32:04] that you'd minister to the needs. Lord,
[32:06] you you know each one of us. You know
[32:09] what we have need of, Lord, maybe some
[32:11] that's not present, but Lord, that are
[32:14] streaming or Lord will hear it. I pray
[32:16] God that it'll extend Lord to them Lord
[32:19] and just reach Lord uh wherever one
[32:23] might be tonight God have your way. We
[32:25] look to you Lord in Jesus Christ's name.
[32:28] Amen.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; And amen. Amen. Luke 17
[32:34] and verse 30. Even thus shall it be in
[32:38] the day when the Son of Man is revealed.
[32:42] In that day, he which shall be upon the
[32:44] housetop, and his stuff in the house,
[32:47] let him not come down to take it away.
[32:50] And he that is in the field, let him
[32:52] likewise not return back. Remember Lot's
[32:56] wife. Whosoever shall seek to save his
[33:00] life shall lose it, and whosoever shall
[33:02] lose his life shall preserve it. I tell
[33:06] you, in that night there shall be two
[33:09] men in one bed. The one shall be taken
[33:11] and the other shall be left. Two women
[33:14] shall be grinding together.
[33:17] The one shall be taken, the other left.
[33:19] Brother Bram tells us this is the
[33:21] rapture, right?
[33:23] Verse 36, two men shall be in the field,
[33:26] the one shall be taken and the other
[33:29] left.
[33:31] And they answered and said unto him,
[33:36] Where, Lord?
[33:38] Not when
[33:42] &gt;&gt; that already been established.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; When you see the days of Lot,
[33:47] &gt;&gt; when you see the days of Noah,
[33:49] &gt;&gt; the when had already been established,
[33:52] they didn't ask when.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Where
[33:56] where is this going to take place?
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Profound question.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he gives them a profound
[34:04] answer. And they answered and said unto
[34:07] him, "Where, Lord?"
[34:10] And he said unto them, "Wheroever the
[34:12] body is, thither will the eagles be
[34:16] gathered together."
[34:18] &gt;&gt; I want to take for a thought tonight if
[34:20] I could. Rapture landscape.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; Rapture landscape. You may take your
[34:27] seat tonight.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to have my wife with us
[34:30] and my daughter TR and also couple of
[34:34] the saints from the church, Sister Dawn.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Sister Elizabeth, take take it down.
[34:41] Thank you. Amen.
[34:43] I I want to look at this this evening if
[34:46] we can just uh by the help of the Lord.
[34:48] And and uh you know quite a quite a
[34:53] passage of scripture. And you know here
[34:57] the the disciples would ask the question
[35:00] and it again it had already been uh
[35:03] established uh God had uh the Lord had
[35:06] told them that uh uh the the win. Amen.
[35:10] that you look for these certain things
[35:13] when you know as it was in the days of
[35:15] Lot and and and as it was in the days of
[35:18] Noah and there would be it would be a
[35:21] time that it would be very
[35:22] characteristics of those times and and
[35:26] how Amen. We realize that and we realize
[35:28] though that that the the time is is just
[35:31] part of it because there's a lot of
[35:33] people a lot of good Baptists can can
[35:36] identify with uh with that and they
[35:38] could tell you that hey we're in the
[35:40] days of Lot. Amen. They could tell you
[35:42] we're in the days of of Noah and and and
[35:45] they could tell you what time it is.
[35:47] Amen. But that's only a portion of it.
[35:50] That's only a piece of it. Amen. Uh the
[35:53] other part is where is it going to be?
[35:55] Can you say amen? Amen. And I want to I
[35:58] want to be where it's at. Amen. Because
[36:00] listen, you can know what time something
[36:02] is but not know where it is and you can
[36:06] miss it. Amen. But if you know where it
[36:08] is, it really don't matter when what the
[36:11] time is because you'll be where it
[36:13] happens. Can somebody say amen? Can I
[36:16] say that again? Amen. You You can know
[36:18] Amen. the time of something but not
[36:21] where it's at and you can miss it.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you know where it's at,
[36:26] whenever it happens, amen, you're there.
[36:29] How many can say, "I want to be there."
[36:31] Amen. I'm going to be in that. Amen. And
[36:34] and and regardless, and we thank God
[36:36] that Amen. that we are aware of the time
[36:38] and and and that that God has has made
[36:41] it very clear in in this age, amen, the
[36:45] uh the the time and Amen. But the but
[36:48] where it's going to happen. Amen. And
[36:50] Jesus would tell us that it would be
[36:52] where the uh uh where the the body is.
[36:54] The eagles would be gathered there.
[36:57] Amen. In other words, amen. It's in the
[37:00] revealed word. Uh the the the the
[37:03] meeting place, the the rapture, Amen, is
[37:05] in the revealed word. Amen. That's where
[37:08] it's going to be. Amen. And and brother
[37:10] Brandon was asked a question, you know,
[37:12] do we have to be at a certain place? And
[37:14] he would say, "No, you know, it's it's
[37:16] not so much a geographical location as
[37:19] it is a spiritual location." Amen.
[37:22] Wherever we are tonight, wherever we're
[37:24] from, Amen. The meeting place, Amen. The
[37:27] place to be is the revealed word.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to look at this if we can,
[37:35] the rapture landscape, and just look at
[37:38] just for just
[37:40] &gt;&gt; He said, "Not a few minutes." He wants
[37:42] me
[37:44] for a little while. Uh I I want to look
[37:47] at at what it what it looks like. Amen.
[37:50] Because how many is familiar with what a
[37:51] landscape is? And and you know certain
[37:54] places have uh here in Georgia there's a
[37:56] certain landscape and and you know I was
[37:59] thinking years ago we we went to Florida
[38:01] for the first time and and we took the
[38:03] kids. They were uh some of them were
[38:05] small and and uh we were on our way to
[38:08] Florida and we made it a few hours. I
[38:10] don't even know if we'd got out of South
[38:11] Carolina. And we stopped and and uh one
[38:14] of the kids said, "Uh, are we here?" Uh,
[38:17] you see, they'd never been there. And
[38:20] they they really didn't know what to be
[38:21] looking for. And and so they said, "Are
[38:24] we there?" For for a minute there, I
[38:25] thought, "Boy, if I told them, yeah, I
[38:28] could save a whole lot of money."
[38:30] If I wouldn't do that, but I thought if
[38:34] I if I just for a minute, I thought,
[38:36] Lord, if I just Yeah. If I said, "We're
[38:38] we've made it. This this could be a we
[38:41] save us half of what we'd be spending."
[38:43] But uh you know, they had never been
[38:45] there. Amen. But now they've been there.
[38:48] Uh they've been to Florida and they can
[38:50] tell you what the landscape is. They can
[38:53] tell you what to look for. They can tell
[38:55] you when we're getting near it. And and
[38:56] if I could say it this way, amen, as
[38:58] believers, amen, that has that have
[39:01] truly amen have tasted amen and
[39:05] experienced, Amen. the word of God in
[39:08] this hour. Amen. And and understand,
[39:10] Amen, that God has done something
[39:13] special in this day. Amen. They can't
[39:16] accept nothing else. A I said they can't
[39:18] accept anything else. You'd never fool
[39:21] them. Amen. That we're there. Amen. With
[39:23] something less.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; You would never trick them
[39:29] &gt;&gt; into believing that that that we're in
[39:31] the rapture with a message from
[39:33] yesterday. You would you would never
[39:36] convince a real message believer, Amen,
[39:38] with a Pentecostal message that we're in
[39:41] the rapture. Amen. Because they've
[39:43] experienced those things.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[39:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so they I want to look just
[39:51] just at a few things this evening and
[39:54] and just at at what that looks like and
[39:58] and what it don't look like. Uh are you
[40:01] with me?
[40:02] Uh we we'll see where he's not rapturing
[40:05] from. We we know he's not rapturing from
[40:08] a denomination.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Right? He's not rapturing from an
[40:13] organization
[40:15] spoken or unspoken.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[40:19] &gt;&gt; He's not rapturing from a little circle.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Come on. Or some trendy movement. Amen.
[40:25] Around the message even. Amen. He's he's
[40:27] he's rapturing from the revealed word.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's that's where it's
[40:32] coming from. Amen. To tonight. And so,
[40:35] amen. When you look at this and you you
[40:38] realize that that God, Amen, has brought
[40:40] us up to a certain place in this day
[40:43] that he would never Amen. He would never
[40:45] rapture the church just under
[40:47] justification.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; Right.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; He would never rapture the church just
[40:53] under sanctification.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. We got a lot of people
[40:57] that, you know, they they they'll
[40:59] they'll get to a certain place, maybe
[41:01] sanctification and and and they just
[41:03] get, you know, hunker down and and and
[41:06] and everything is just, you know, in
[41:08] sanctification. But and we thank God for
[41:11] that. But listen, if that was it, they
[41:13] would have been raptured back in
[41:14] Wesley's day.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. If just justification was it, we
[41:18] would have been raptured, Amen. back in
[41:20] Luther's day. Amen. But he wouldn't
[41:23] rapture. That would not be, Amen. the
[41:25] final place. Amen. Justification would
[41:28] not be that place. Sanctification would
[41:30] not be that place. And we found out that
[41:32] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, Amen,
[41:35] would not be that place.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That that God will
[41:39] would continue to bring us further. If
[41:42] if just the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[41:44] would have been that place, we' had a
[41:46] rapture a long time ago.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; They would have raptured under
[41:49] Pentecost.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; They would have raptured under another
[41:52] age. Amen. And if I if if that would
[41:55] have been it,
[41:57] &gt;&gt; they they would they would have gone
[41:58] then.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he would bring us on up.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham said he would
[42:03] bring us on to a bride age.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; Come on. What's he doing? He's getting
[42:07] the the the the bride ready for a
[42:09] rapture. Amen. That he's bringing us to
[42:12] the place where it actually takes place.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he he would he would bring
[42:22] us beyond just the just the baptism or a
[42:25] restoration of gifts. We thank God for
[42:27] that.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Uh but but there would be another turn.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; There would be another turn. There had
[42:33] to be a turning of the hearts.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Think about that. You had justification.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; You had sanctification.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; You had the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[42:43] But then we had to have Malachi 4
[42:46] &gt;&gt; and Elijah because there was another
[42:48] turn. Amen.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; It was a turning of the heart. So you
[42:51] could you could have all of those
[42:54] &gt;&gt; and there was still a portion of the
[42:56] heart
[42:57] &gt;&gt; that had to be turned.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; No, not notice the order. It was not
[43:01] justification,
[43:02] sanctification, the turn of the heart,
[43:05] then the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; But it was justification,
[43:09] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[43:12] Ghost, and then there still had to be a
[43:14] turning of the heart.
[43:16] So after all of that, the heart could
[43:19] still be
[43:21] &gt;&gt; the heart could STILL BE, AMEN. NOT
[43:23] turned the right way.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; And and and as far as this goes, it
[43:27] wasn't turned the right way. Amen. It
[43:30] would take a it would take a ministry to
[43:32] Amen. a a prophet and a a message in
[43:35] this day to uh to to turn that heart.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[43:43] to to take us. Amen. Father, Amen. to to
[43:48] the to the real place that this would
[43:50] that this was going to happen.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many say it'd be all right if
[43:54] it happened in 20 I was going to say
[43:56] 2026, but 2025.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, I I don't know a more
[44:01] imminent uh uh uh message than than than
[44:04] the rapture of the bride. Amen. I don't
[44:06] know anything that's more more pressing

[44:11] of right now than our leaving here.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:18] Amen. Brother Brandham said he
[44:19] interprets modern events. He said he
[44:23] interprets his own word
[44:25] &gt;&gt; by vindicated and in the age that it's
[44:28] purposed for. He said the age that it's
[44:31] given for. He said we're not living in a
[44:34] Pentecostal age. We're living in another
[44:37] age. We're not living in the Methodist
[44:39] age. We're living in another age. We're

[45:22] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm reminded of Isaiah the prophet
[45:25] in in in the first five or six chapters,
[45:28] five chapters, I believe it is. He's
[45:30] he's a prophet
[45:32] &gt;&gt; and he's prophesying
[45:35] &gt;&gt; and he's he's declaring the word of the
[45:38] Lord and he's he's delivering all the
[45:41] woes to Israel. But in about come along
[45:44] about that sixth chapter. Amen. He has a
[45:48] a a transforming vision and he sees the
[45:52] Lord like he's never seen him before.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. already a prophet,
[45:58] &gt;&gt; already declaring the word of the Lord,
[46:01] already uh uh uh uh ordered of God in
[46:04] what he was doing. Amen. But in that
[46:07] sixth chapter, amen, he saw God high and
[46:10] lifted up. Amen. God, Amen, allowed him
[46:13] to see him like he had never. In other
[46:15] words, there was room, Amen, for him to
[46:17] come up a little higher. Amen. And when
[46:19] he did that, it was no longer the woes
[46:21] of Israel, but it was woe is me. Oh, woe
[46:24] is me, Lord. Amen. It caused him to see
[46:27] himself.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; And he realized that,
[46:35] oh, we can we can come up. So, can I say
[46:39] this? From the from the front door to
[46:41] the back door, wherever we are. Amen.
[46:44] There's room to come on up a little
[46:45] higher tonight. Amen. Until you get a
[46:48] body change. Amen. There's room. And
[46:51] this is an ascending rapture. This is an
[46:53] ascending life. Amen. And the call is on
[46:57] us. Amen. The prophecy is over us to
[46:59] come up hither. Amen. To come up a

[47:44] us.

[48:00] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[48:01] &gt;&gt; I said it's something we get accustomed
[48:03] to. Amen. When when we're seated there,
[48:06] he's saying this is the place, Amen,
[48:08] that we're to dwell.

[48:28] &gt;&gt; See, can I tell you where he's not? He's
[48:30] not rapturing tonight from the barroom.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; He might deliver you from the barroom,
[48:35] &gt;&gt; but he's not rapturing you from the
[48:37] barroom.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; He He He may bring you from the barroom.
[48:41] He He may bring you from the uh uh uh
[48:44] the worldly whatever, but he doesn't
[48:46] rapture from there. Amen. He'll deliver
[48:48] you from there. Amen. If you're here
[48:50] tonight and Amen. and you're there,
[48:52] he'll deliver you from there. Amen. But

[49:17] John, brother Brandham said, was
[49:18] summoned
[49:20] to come up higher.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; See, you've got, you say, well, how did

[49:44] he's brought you not just called you,
[49:45] but he summons you to come up higher.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; He summons you to come up.
[49:53] Amen. Where he can so Amen. acclimate
[49:58] you
[49:59] to to to the spiritual things. Are you
[50:03] with me? So he's raised us up.
[50:07] raise us up together.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Matthew 18,
[50:14] I was looking at this the other day.
[50:16] Matthew 18 and 20. For where two or
[50:17] three are gathered
[50:19] together.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Notice that where two or three are
[50:24] gathered
[50:26] together
[50:28] &gt;&gt; in my name, there am I in the midst to
[50:31] them. Right
[50:32] &gt;&gt; now, two or three are gathered.
[50:37] Not just gathered,
[50:40] &gt;&gt; but gathered together,
[50:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[50:43] &gt;&gt; See, you can have a gathering and not be
[50:45] together. You ever been to a family
[50:47] reunion?
[50:48] &gt;&gt; You're you're all gathered, but you're
[50:51] not together. You got a lot of ideas.
[50:54] You you got a you got a lot of
[50:57] dysfunctional things and people and and
[51:00] ideas and and you almost dread going to
[51:02] those things, but but you go this time
[51:05] of year. You go and and and you see Aunt
[51:08] Martha and and sister so and so and
[51:10] cousin so and so and and and and you're
[51:14] gathered and they can be a hundred of
[51:15] you, but you're not gathered together.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; So, it's more than just a gathering.
[51:22] It's more see you can be you can be
[51:25] gathered at many places and not be
[51:28] together.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Many pl you you can come to church and
[51:33] be gathered but not be together.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; You you can come and one have one idea
[51:38] and another have another idea and I just
[51:41] tell people keep your ideas to yourself.
[51:45] Just keep them ideas to you. It'll make
[51:47] it a whole lot easier. AMEN. WE WE GOT
[51:50] ENOUGH of them already. just just just
[51:52] keep them just keep them ideas to to uh
[51:54] to yourself. But you can be gathered.
[51:57] AMEN. BUT BUT LISTEN, that's not where
[51:59] it's at. It's when we're gathered
[52:01] together
[52:03] &gt;&gt; and we're together truly in one mind
[52:07] &gt;&gt; and one purpose under one message.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; So where where where we're gathered
[52:16] together
[52:21] in my name
[52:23] &gt;&gt; cuz you can be gathered together
[52:27] &gt;&gt; under something else.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; You can be gathered together like you
[52:32] can be gathered together in a ball game.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; All be gathered and be together on who
[52:38] we're pulling for.
[52:40] You can come on.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Uh you can be gathered together and but
[52:46] but it goes on further than that. But
[52:48] it's it's when we're gathered together
[52:51] under that name
[52:53] &gt;&gt; in his name,
[52:55] &gt;&gt; not in some name of a meeting or a name
[52:58] of a personality or but when we're
[53:00] gathered together, amen, in that name,
[53:04] he promises I'll be in that meeting.
[53:07] Amen. So if we're gathered tonight, two
[53:09] or three of us and a whole lot more than
[53:11] that here, and we're gathered and we
[53:13] really come, Amen. really come to hear
[53:16] and to meet from him, we've got a
[53:18] promise.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I didn't
[53:22] come for any other reason.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; So he says when we gather that way,
[53:33] he says, I'm in the midst
[53:36] of them. Now you see why it only takes
[53:38] two or three
[53:42] &gt;&gt; cuz there's a lot of people gathering
[53:43] for a whole lot of other reasons. But I
[53:45] I just want to go ahead and put it out
[53:47] there. Amen. For them that's gathered
[53:49] for any other reason, it only takes two
[53:50] or three of us.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful?
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so Amen. He would bring us. He
[54:02] would He would He would He would raise
[54:04] us up.

[54:08] &gt;&gt; sir.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; It's heavenly places.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; We're talking about where the rapture.
[54:13] We're talking where we're raptured from.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; We're not raptured from the lowly
[54:17] places. We're raptured from the heavenly
[54:19] places. We're raptur It's a high
[54:21] calling. It's a high calling of God.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?

[54:29] He would positionally place us there.
[54:32] Amen. And we would we would get not uh
[54:35] not satisfied from a uh just a you know
[54:39] almost a a carnal uh point of view but
[54:42] but we would get very accustom
[54:46] &gt;&gt; very acclimated.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Can you can you say amen?
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. There there's a there's a term
[54:52] called alclimatization
[54:55] &gt;&gt; and and and you you maybe you've you
[54:57] know seen seen maybe like Denver,
[54:59] Colorado. Uh it's a mile high
[55:02] &gt;&gt; uh you know above sea level and and you
[55:05] can go to you can go to that Denver and
[55:08] it's a mile high. It's a higher it's a

[55:15] there, you get there, you know what? You
[55:17] do a lot of walking or a lot of running,
[55:19] you're going to have a problem
[55:20] breathing.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because you're in a higher
[55:23] atmosphere. You're in a higher higher
[55:25] climate.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. But there's a process called
[55:29] aclimatization.
[55:31] that if you stay there long enough,
[55:34] &gt;&gt; if you stay there long enough that your
[55:36] body physically,
[55:38] your body physically will begin to adapt
[55:41] to that environment.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and if you stay there long
[55:45] enough, Amen. Runners go there, athletes
[55:47] go there and train and and so forth. If
[55:50] you stay there long enough, your body
[55:52] actually acclimates to that. Amen. And
[55:56] then when maybe you were wore out a week
[55:57] before, but now you're there and your
[56:00] body is starting to adapt to that higher
[56:02] elevation.

[59:03] this is an identifying age. Amen.
[59:06] Everything's being identified
[59:09] &gt;&gt; in this agemen.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Uh there's there's nothing amen that
[59:14] that that that has not been identified
[59:16] in this age.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; It's it's the age now of real
[59:21] identification.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; How many's heard real ID?
[59:26] &gt;&gt; It's it's it's you know I always thought
[59:28] my ID was my ID.
[59:31] I was somewhere and they said, "Well, we
[59:32] need your real ID." I said, "Well, this
[59:34] ain't a fake one.
[59:36] This is really me.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; This isn't the guy behind me,
[59:39] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:39] &gt;&gt; This is me. But they don't see they want
[59:41] they want to really validate this thing.
[59:44] Uh uh uh before before going abroad. Uh
[59:47] they they want to they want to know it's
[59:49] the it's the day of real ID. Amen. I'm

[1:00:04] that rapture. Amen. And we've been
[1:00:06] identified by a word in this hour. Amen.
[1:00:09] That we are part of that.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; It's that hour. It's the hour. Amen. Of
[1:00:15] identification.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; So much focus on on real ID. The the
[1:00:20] reason being is because there's so much
[1:00:22] false ID.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; There there's so much false identity.
[1:00:30] Amen. that my son, he was a state
[1:00:33] trooper for a little while and he p
[1:00:34] pulled a pulled a man one night way in
[1:00:36] the wee hours of the morning. It's about
[1:00:38] 2:00 in the morning up in the mountains
[1:00:39] and he said it was all the whole thing
[1:00:42] was suspicious. He said, "But daddy said
[1:00:44] this guy had uh eight different IDs,
[1:00:50] not eight forms of identification, eight
[1:00:53] different identifications."
[1:00:56] And he said, he said, "And the one he
[1:00:59] the one he gave me wasn't him."
[1:01:04] So, so, so he said, he said he, you
[1:01:07] know, he he found out this after the
[1:01:09] fact. He said, you know, obviously the
[1:01:10] guy was running from something.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Uh, he he he didn't want to be
[1:01:15] identified with who he really is.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. for for whatever reason something
[1:01:19] had happened and and and you know what
[1:01:22] whatever he had done he didn't want to
[1:01:24] be associated with who he really really
[1:01:26] is.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; A can you say amen? Amen. And some of us
[1:01:31] listen maybe maybe this age has has put
[1:01:34] a a label on us and put another ID but
[1:01:37] this is the hour. This is the age amen
[1:01:40] where God is bringing our real identity.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Bringing a real identity. prophet come
[1:01:47] an identifying prophet. Amen. In this
[1:01:50] hour and he's identified, Amen. He's
[1:01:52] identified everything. He He identified
[1:01:55] the false church.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; It was he he identified who that mother
[1:02:02] harlot was.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; He identified the the the the seven
[1:02:06] church ages.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; God bless Clarence Larkin's heart.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Sure. Absolutely. We we appreciate he
[1:02:14] was he was ahead of his time.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; He had a lot of revelation, but he
[1:02:18] wasn't a prophet. Amen. A prophet didn't
[1:02:20] stop with just identifying seven gentile
[1:02:23] ages, but he identified seven angel
[1:02:26] messengers
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; to those seven. You say, "Why?" It's an
[1:02:31] identifying age. He was an identifying
[1:02:34] angel. Are you with me? It's an
[1:02:36] identifying time. Amen. Brother Brandham
[1:02:38] said, "And greater than Solomon is
[1:02:40] here." He said, "The scripture never
[1:02:42] leaves any age without a clear-cut
[1:02:45] identification that we might know what
[1:02:48] hour we're living in." Amen. It's made
[1:02:51] it very clear. Can somebody say amen?
[1:02:54] Amen. What hour we're in, it's been
[1:02:57] identified. Amen. He goes on in another
[1:02:59] place trying to do God a service. He
[1:03:02] said, "How did he bring Christ here?"
[1:03:05] He said, "By the word of the prophets."
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Is that right? He said, "How will he
[1:03:11] bring his bride here?"
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; "By the word of the prophets."
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; How? Watch this. How did he identify him
[1:03:20] when he come?
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "By a man with the spirit of
[1:03:25] Elijah upon him, come out of the
[1:03:28] wilderness." So he's saying when Jesus
[1:03:30] come, how did how did he how did God
[1:03:32] identify him?
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; By a man with the spirit of Elijah.
[1:03:37] Exactly.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; He says, "How will he identify his
[1:03:41] bride,
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; the same way
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; he promised in Malachi 4 the same
[1:03:49] thing?" Amen. In other words, amen. When
[1:03:51] Jesus was here, amen, he identified him
[1:03:55] by Elijah the prophet. Amen. And then
[1:03:58] when the bride of Christ come, Amen. In
[1:04:01] this day, how was she identified? Amen.
[1:04:04] by an Elijah the prophet in this day.
[1:04:07] Amen. As he is, so is she.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; He would identify us by Elijah the
[1:04:14] prophet just like he was identified.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's a that's an identifying time.
[1:04:25] This is an identifying age.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:04:31] He He has identified
[1:04:35] not a church
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; but a bride.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Come on. It's no longer the church,
[1:04:44] right? The the church is no longer
[1:04:47] descriptive of just the pure elect. It
[1:04:50] It takes everything in. Amen. So he
[1:04:52] would take us, Amen. From the church,
[1:04:55] Amen. to the bride, to the elect, to the
[1:04:57] wife. Can somebody say amen? Not the
[1:04:59] spirit and the church say come. The
[1:05:01] spirit and the bride say come. Amen. Not
[1:05:04] the church hath made HERSELF READY. THE
[1:05:06] WIFE HATH MADE HERSELF READY. CAN YOU
[1:05:08] say amen? He's pulled us on a little
[1:05:11] further.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; It's because you've got
[1:05:20] rapture.
[1:05:23] You're part of the rapture.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; It's an identifying age.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Israel got her identity back in this
[1:05:31] age.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; It was lost for years.
[1:05:39] Israel's Israel's identity was lost for
[1:05:42] years.
[1:05:44] Thousands of years. They would go into
[1:05:46] captivity. You know the history of it.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. They would go into captivity and
[1:05:52] Babylonian and Roman and Amen. uh you
[1:05:55] know just just a uh uh was awful. They
[1:05:59] would sin and and and raise up false
[1:06:03] gods and idolatry and and and it would
[1:06:06] bring them into captivity.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and but thank God
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; thank God in the in the age of of true
[1:06:14] identity. Amen. God Amen. would bring
[1:06:17] her back. Amen. And and that star of
[1:06:20] David flies tonight. Amen. Amen. For for
[1:06:23] almost 2,000 years, Israel's identity
[1:06:26] was lost. In 1948, they become a nation
[1:06:28] again.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; In this age, are you with me?
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; In this age, they got their identity
[1:06:37] back. It was covered over.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Different different names. Most uh
[1:06:43] most recent Palestine.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; It was under different name. It didn't
[1:06:46] even carry the name Israel.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; It had so many layers. if you will.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Uh false identities over it.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, matter of fact, never before
[1:07:00] in the in the history of the world has a
[1:07:03] people lost their their their statethood
[1:07:06] and become a nation after such an
[1:07:08] extended period of time
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; as Israel
[1:07:11] after all of those years.
[1:07:14] And God would bring them back
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; and and and and begin to uh to to
[1:07:20] uncover. Amen. and and to pull back
[1:07:22] those false identities. Can you say
[1:07:25] amen?
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and bring them back to
[1:07:29] Amen. to to who they really are.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; You see this even in the you know when
[1:07:36] I've been to Israel, maybe some of you
[1:07:38] have and and I didn't realize I didn't
[1:07:42] realize a lot till I got brother Bam
[1:07:44] said the Bible become a new book. Uh
[1:07:48] don't worry if you've never been. He
[1:07:49] said when the seals were opened it
[1:07:50] become a new book too. So uh you got a
[1:07:53] new book either way
[1:07:56] and I would take that one over a trip to
[1:07:59] Israel. Amen. But uh but you know he he
[1:08:03] talks about it and you know how or when
[1:08:05] we were over there and
[1:08:08] we we we learned something and that was
[1:08:10] how that uh Israel for years when you
[1:08:14] know when when they would build
[1:08:15] something they maybe tear down something
[1:08:17] or something was destroyed due to the
[1:08:20] due to the space and everything they
[1:08:22] would just build on top of it. That's
[1:08:23] right.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Right. That's why you see all these
[1:08:26] archaeologists, these digs from time,
[1:08:28] they'll dig down, they'll find something
[1:08:30] biblical. And you'll think, well, how
[1:08:32] didn't they have it before? Because
[1:08:33] they've built over top of that and
[1:08:35] they've built over top of that and and
[1:08:37] and and just just I layer after layer
[1:08:40] after layer. And so so as as as God in
[1:08:44] this age has allowed through technology
[1:08:47] and the archaeology, Amen. they would
[1:08:49] begin to unearth
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; her true identity
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; layer after layer. Are you with me?
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Bringing it, Amen. back to Amen.
[1:09:03] to to what's really there. And then we
[1:09:04] hear well this was this was King David's
[1:09:07] or this was Solomon's or what's h that
[1:09:10] identity has been brought back.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; And they pull back those layers. Are you
[1:09:19] with me?
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; How many listen what he does what he
[1:09:21] does to them. Listen he how many can
[1:09:23] thank God that he's pulled some layers
[1:09:25] back off of your life?
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. You had some false identities.
[1:09:29] Amen. You had some false labels on your
[1:09:31] life. Amen. But one, I'm thinking of the
[1:09:33] woman at the well. Amen. She was covered
[1:09:36] over with a with a with a handful of
[1:09:38] them. Amen. Until she met the one, Amen.
[1:09:41] that could bring her her true identity.
[1:09:45] And Jesus stood there and layer after
[1:09:48] layer.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Them husbands were identities.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; He began to unear, come on. Amen. pull
[1:09:56] back layer after layer, identity after
[1:10:00] identity, till he found who she really
[1:10:03] was.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; He said, "You've had five identities,
[1:10:10] and the one you're walking with now is
[1:10:12] not your real one."
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; You've had five. And the one, what was
[1:10:21] he do? He pulled all of those back.
[1:10:26] Oh, thank God.
[1:10:29] And he revealed to her who she really
[1:10:33] was.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And listen, when that identity was
[1:10:37] restored, she got her voice back.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; I said she got her voice back.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Listen, for years, for she had to go to
[1:10:48] that well alone.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; She had no influence. Right.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said nobody would
[1:10:54] listen to her.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; He said those men would have never
[1:10:58] listened to her.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Come on. You can hear him talk about
[1:11:01] this.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. That she would go alone. Amen. Had
[1:11:05] no influence. Had no voice. Amen. But
[1:11:09] when she got her identity back,
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; she got her voice back. Amen. Because
[1:11:15] she left there. Amen. Under her new
[1:11:18] identity. Amen. And went back down into
[1:11:20] the town. Amen. And what? Because of her
[1:11:23] word. Amen. A word that they wouldn't
[1:11:26] EVEN HEAR. AMEN. AN hour before this.
[1:11:29] Amen. But when she got OH MY. AMEN. I'M
[1:11:32] thinking of a bride getting her true
[1:11:34] identity. Amen. And with HER TRUE
[1:11:36] IDENTITY. AMEN. WE GOT A VOICE TONIGHT.
[1:11:39] AMEN. AND WE ARE THAT FINAL VOICE TO THE
[1:11:42] FINAL AGE. AMEN. UNDER OUR RIGHT
[1:11:44] IDENTITY.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Under our true identity.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE HAVE NO VOICE OUTSIDE OF THIS
[1:11:51] MESSAGE.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; HELLO.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Oh no.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Got nothing to say.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Just hush. Come on. Nothing. A. Amen.

[1:12:09] Amen. Under this word. Amen. Under our
[1:12:12] true identity. Amen. Right.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; We got a lot to say.
[1:12:21] Brother Brham said, "You try to shut her
[1:12:22] up now."
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; He said before, he said they wouldn't
[1:12:27] have heard a word she had to say.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; But now,
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; now she's got her identity back.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; She's got her identity back. She's got
[1:12:38] her voice back. Are you with me?
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. People, listen. When you make your
[1:12:43] calling in election,
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; sure,
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; that's it. God will cause people to hear
[1:12:47] you.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; I said when you make your calling
[1:12:51] election sure,
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; when you when you make your election
[1:12:55] sure and who you really are, God will
[1:12:57] cause people to hear you.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; It may be somebody that wouldn't listen
[1:13:02] to you for 10 seconds before. But when
[1:13:04] you come to who you really are, God will
[1:13:07] cause people.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.

[1:13:34] like Florida?
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Look like Leota Sea or does it look like
[1:13:41] rapture?
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; See, because the question was where
[1:13:48] where is this going to be? Where do I
[1:13:50] need to go?
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; The revealed word.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; The revealed word.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Nothing else will hold us, will it?
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Nothing else will hold us. Amen.
[1:14:06] All right.
[1:14:07] How many's thankful for a true identity?
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. That that God would would so
[1:14:15] identify you. Amen. I see I come I come
[1:14:18] out of Pentecost.
[1:14:20] I was I was raised in the assembly of
[1:14:23] God for about 16 years. And
[1:14:31] I had a mom, a praying mom, a mom that
[1:14:33] believed. My dad was an unbeliever. My
[1:14:36] mom my mom believed as far as she could
[1:14:38] believe the time and and so we were we
[1:14:42] were raised that way and and uh for
[1:14:46] about 16 years when I got 16 I wasn't I
[1:14:48] had never given my heart to the Lord and
[1:14:50] I knew God. I knew about you know knew
[1:14:52] about God and had that upbringing but
[1:14:55] you know my heart wasn't in the right
[1:14:56] place. So when I got 16 I told I was
[1:14:58] working at McDonald's. Uh that's why I
[1:15:00] don't cook anymore now. I did all my
[1:15:02] cooking between the wife says, "You
[1:15:04] don't ever cook anything." I said, "I
[1:15:06] cooked enough cheeseburgers from time I
[1:15:08] was 16 to 18 if I never cook another and
[1:15:11] I'm okay." I said, "I've cooked
[1:15:13] thousands upon thousands upon thousands
[1:15:15] of cheeseburgers.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; I still like to eat them.
[1:15:22] But I ain't much of a cook. I make a
[1:15:24] mean peanut butter and jelly sandwich
[1:15:29] and cheese toast.
[1:15:34] But but I told the boss, I said, "I want
[1:15:36] you to work me." I said, "I I want to I
[1:15:40] want to work uh Sundays.
[1:15:43] Work me Wednesdays."
[1:15:45] And uh and so he obliged. He he he I
[1:15:49] worked me every Sunday. And so, of
[1:15:51] course, I drifted further away. And it
[1:15:53] was about it was about four or five
[1:15:55] years before uh God dealt with me. Amen.
[1:15:59] And so anyway, the the Lord had dealt
[1:16:02] with me and all I knew was the
[1:16:04] Pentecostal background. And and so after
[1:16:07] I surrendered my life to the Lord, I
[1:16:09] took a I belineed to the Pentecostal
[1:16:12] church. And you know, I got in there and
[1:16:15] it was okay for the first six or eight
[1:16:18] months. and and then I just kept reading
[1:16:21] and kept, you know, kept just praying
[1:16:23] and looking at things and then then I
[1:16:25] was approached by by a brother and uh he
[1:16:28] shared a couple things with me and I
[1:16:30] just couldn't get away. I come to come
[1:16:32] to work one day and I told him he said,
[1:16:34] "What'd you do this weekend?" I said, "I
[1:16:35] was baptized."
[1:16:37] And uh I said, "I was baptized on
[1:16:39] Sunday." And he said, "You was
[1:16:40] baptized?" He said, "Well, how was you
[1:16:41] baptized?" I said, "What do you mean how
[1:16:43] was I baptized?" baptized in water in a
[1:16:46] river if you want to get specific.
[1:16:51] And he said, "No, how was you baptized?"
[1:16:53] I said, "I don't know what you're
[1:16:54] talking about. You know, water, river,
[1:16:57] uh, I'm feeling great." He said, "No,
[1:17:00] what did you how did you get baptized in
[1:17:02] the name of the Lord Jesus?" And he
[1:17:06] said, "What did he say?" I said, he
[1:17:07] said, he said I said, "Well," he said,
[1:17:08] "He baptized you in the name of the
[1:17:10] Father, Son, and Holy Ghost." He said,
[1:17:11] "Oh, you got baptized into the Catholic
[1:17:13] Church."
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; And I said, "What?"
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "You got baptized into the
[1:17:20] Catholic Church." I I took offense cuz
[1:17:24] man, I I was God knows my heart, right?
[1:17:27] And and and I was doing all I knew how
[1:17:29] to do, but I he said it and and I I boy,
[1:17:33] it burnt me up on the inside, you know?
[1:17:35] I walked away from that car. I couldn't
[1:17:36] get it off my mind. I baptized the
[1:17:38] Catholic church. So a little bit later,
[1:17:40] he came over and he said, ' Yeah. He
[1:17:41] said, 'You wasn't baptized.' He said,
[1:17:42] 'You wasted your time.
[1:17:47] He said, 'You just wasted your time.' I
[1:17:49] said, what or what are you talking
[1:17:51] about? And he began to tell me, oh, you
[1:17:54] know, Christian baptism. And And so I
[1:17:57] just I act like I paid no attention to
[1:17:59] him, but it it it was the word.
[1:18:03] A and you can try to ignore it if you
[1:18:05] want to, but uh there's something about
[1:18:08] a real believer
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; and the word
[1:18:12] uh you just can't get away from it. You
[1:18:14] can you can run and you can hide and
[1:18:17] uh but listen, it's it's here to
[1:18:19] identify you. Amen. It'll it's going to
[1:18:21] identify you tonight. Amen. It it's it's
[1:18:24] it's it's just that powerful. Amen.
[1:18:26] It'll find you. And and so that just
[1:18:29] kept just going over and over and over
[1:18:31] in my heart. and and and uh this was
[1:18:33] Josh and Caleb's daddy by the sister uh
[1:18:36] Dawn uh that that I was working with
[1:18:37] that told me this young man that go to
[1:18:40] the church and and uh he told me this
[1:18:42] and long story short it just ate at me
[1:18:45] and ate at me and ate at me and finally
[1:18:47] one night I I I'd got home I was I got
[1:18:49] off of work and I got in the shower and
[1:18:51] it was on me so strong I prayed and I
[1:18:53] said God if you'll let this if you'll
[1:18:55] let this water from this shower if
[1:18:57] you'll let it hold me in the name of the

[1:20:11] that night, I can stand here and tell
[1:20:13] you by the great This may not be your
[1:20:15] testimony. Amen. But I had it so bad God
[1:20:17] took that. I have never in 30 years I've
[1:20:21] never said another curse word. By God's
[1:20:25] grace and by GOD'S POWER, THAT'S HOW
[1:20:27] MUCH GOD will do.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.

[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:20:57] bride here? By the word of the
[1:20:58] prophets." How did he how did he

[1:21:09] identify his bride?
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; He promised Malachi 4
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; the same thing.

[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; That you found out who you really are.
[1:21:44] Amen.

[1:21:49] his word which he is
[1:21:53] has has been begin to to to risen. He

[1:22:00] through the age of Luther
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Wesley see has be to raise up to its
[1:22:06] power.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; There it be to move. Then it moved a
[1:22:09] little more. Now it's coming up to

[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; is a vindication of the rapture is at
[1:22:24] hand.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; See that life is now in a body.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; And he says that's a vindication
[1:22:32] that we're at the rapture.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; That it's time. Are you with me? When
[1:22:37] you see the headship and the body
[1:22:40] becoming one
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; and the fullness of the measure of his
[1:22:44] manifestation,
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; it shows that the body is about to about
[1:22:50] ready to be received to the headship.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; He's identifying a body.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; He's identifying a people. Amen. Don't
[1:23:02] get discouraged. Amen. That you see
[1:23:05] people fall. Listen. uh uh go different
[1:23:08] ways and and fall out and fall. Listen,
[1:23:11] we pray for them.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; We pray for them.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Always pray for them.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't ever listen. Don't Don't
[1:23:19] ever cut the grace off.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Let God do that.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you pray for them. You believe
[1:23:25] for them. Can somebody say amen? Amen.
[1:23:27] You say that they got it, you know,

[1:23:30] YEAH. JUST PRAY FOR THEM.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:36] I don't ever like to see it no more than
[1:23:38] anybody else does.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; But if I've learned one thing is
[1:23:44] his grace is a powerful thing.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; His grace is a powerful thing.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; God's word calls for total separation.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Can you stay with me just a few more
[1:23:57] minutes?
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; It's a total separation. We're not We're
[1:24:02] not to go back into the world no more.
[1:24:05] or have anything to do with the world,
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; but cleave only unto God. Jesus is
[1:24:11] coming after a bride, a woman. See, a
[1:24:14] church that's separated from the things
[1:24:16] of the world or cares of the world.
[1:24:19] She's separated from the fashions of
[1:24:22] this modern age that we live in. She's
[1:24:24] separated from the the cares and the
[1:24:27] traditions of churches. She's separated
[1:24:30] only to God. And God is the word. And as
[1:24:35] husband and wife is one, so does the
[1:24:37] bride and the word become one. For the
[1:24:40] word is living through the bride.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; That's how that's her credentials.
[1:24:46] That's her identification.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; What an age. Amen.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; What an hour that we're living in.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a time that we're living in.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. A time of redemption.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Bringing us back
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; to who we really are.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Bringing us back to
[1:25:20] our true identity.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; That we might that we might travel out
[1:25:28] of here.
[1:25:30] Can you say amen?
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; And a false identity won't get us there.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. We got to be brought back.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. We got to be brought back.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; I I was talking to brother Aaron back
[1:25:41] there. He said he shared it before, but
[1:25:43] I'll I'll share a little story in
[1:25:47] closing. I I'm a I'm by vocational. I'm
[1:25:51] a pastor and I I work I'm an insurance
[1:25:54] agent
[1:25:55] and uh been doing it for years. years.
[1:25:57] I've kind of pulled back some now, but
[1:26:00] still doing it some. But a number of
[1:26:02] years ago, I don't know about 10 years
[1:26:05] ago, I guess. Way time gets by, I had a
[1:26:08] client
[1:26:10] that uh real good, real just a great
[1:26:14] client, and uh a husband and wife. And
[1:26:19] they uh they were just real fine people,
[1:26:23] wealthy people. And the husband, his
[1:26:27] name was Jim. Jim was actually
[1:26:29] terminally ill and he was he was going
[1:26:31] to be they told him he only had a short
[1:26:33] period of time to live. And he had taken
[1:26:37] she had had a lot of jewelry. We had
[1:26:39] insured from time to time, but he had
[1:26:41] taken several pieces of of of jewelry,
[1:26:45] and he had had a went to a a jewelry
[1:26:49] store, a jeweler, and he had a ring
[1:26:50] made, a ring, and I can't remember if it
[1:26:53] was a a birthday or an anniversary. I'd
[1:26:56] have to go back and check, but anyway,
[1:26:58] he he had given her this this ring. And
[1:27:02] uh it meant a lot to her. She called and
[1:27:04] said, "I need to I need to insure this."
[1:27:06] and and we went through the you know
[1:27:09] what everything we had to do. It was a
[1:27:10] very high-end piece of jewelry uh
[1:27:13] high-end ring and so we had to have an
[1:27:14] appraiser uh an appraisal and we had to
[1:27:17] have pictures and so forth and then we
[1:27:19] put a stated amount on it and uh we
[1:27:22] added it to her insurance. It was a high
[1:27:24] real high dollar item. highest highest
[1:27:27] piece of jewelry I'd ever insured. And
[1:27:30] and uh anyway, so we insured and
[1:27:32] everything's fine. And and it wasn't
[1:27:35] long at all after that. I can't remember
[1:27:37] how how what the time frame was, but I
[1:27:39] got a call one day. Um her husband had
[1:27:42] actually passed on at this time, but she
[1:27:44] called and you could hear a voice
[1:27:46] breaking up and she said, "I've Scott,
[1:27:47] I've got a problem." She said, "My
[1:27:49] ring's gone."
[1:27:51] And uh and I said, "Oh no." You know,
[1:27:54] she said, "I have no idea where it's
[1:27:55] at." She said, "We've looked everywhere.
[1:27:57] We've we've searched the house. We've
[1:27:59] She said, "I've I've called my daughter
[1:28:01] up and uh my best friend and said,
[1:28:03] "We've swept the house. We've looked
[1:28:05] everywhere." She said, "It's gone. I've
[1:28:07] been looking for several days. I don't
[1:28:09] know what else to do but uh file a
[1:28:11] claim." Um and she said, "I'm I'm
[1:28:14] heartbroken because obviously the
[1:28:17] sentimental value was a whole lot more
[1:28:19] than to die." She didn't need money. Um
[1:28:21] but uh this just the sentimental value
[1:28:23] was worth a whole lot more. And so um I
[1:28:29] said, "Well, I understand. We'll file
[1:28:31] it." So we we proceeded to file a claim
[1:28:33] and a few days later
[1:28:36] an adjuster and an investigative
[1:28:37] adjuster because the dollar amount was
[1:28:39] so high called and said, "We're just
[1:28:41] kind of, you know, vetting things and we
[1:28:43] want to know what you know what you know
[1:28:46] about this client." And uh I said,
[1:28:48] "Well, she's telling you the truth." I
[1:28:50] said, "If it's m, she's saying it's
[1:28:52] missing, it's missing." I said, "They're
[1:28:54] very I" I said, "If you run any kind of
[1:28:56] background on them, you'll you'll know."
[1:28:58] They're just great great people. And I
[1:29:01] said, um, I said, "If she's saying it's
[1:29:04] missing, it's missing." I said, "As far
[1:29:06] as I'm concerned, you're just going to
[1:29:07] have to pay the claim." And and uh I
[1:29:10] said, "We've had them for x amount of
[1:29:11] years." We told them how long they had
[1:29:13] been insured with us and and and so
[1:29:15] forth. And and so he said, "Okay." And
[1:29:18] so they had ended up cutting a check,
[1:29:20] right? Writing a check and sending it
[1:29:22] for the for this this ring. Well, a
[1:29:26] little just a little time went by and I
[1:29:29] get another phone call and it's her.
[1:29:32] It's it's it's u
[1:29:35] uh the price. It's uh her her last name
[1:29:38] is Price and Gail. And uh so I said,
[1:29:42] "Gail." And she this time you could hear
[1:29:44] the the joy in her voice. And she said,
[1:29:47] 'Oh, she said, 'You you're you're just
[1:29:49] you're not going to believe it.' And I
[1:29:52] said, uh, try me. I actually told her
[1:29:55] that when she called the first time,
[1:29:56] said, 'You're not going to believe it. I
[1:29:57] said, 'Try me. Uh, I've I've seen about
[1:29:59] everything and heard it. So, she calls
[1:30:02] again. She said, "You're not going to
[1:30:03] believe this." I said, "Well, try me."
[1:30:05] And, uh, she said, "You are just not
[1:30:08] going to believe it." And I said, "Okay,
[1:30:10] tell me." She said, "Uh, oh, you're just
[1:30:12] not going to believe it." And and she
[1:30:14] said, "But I'm going to tell you." And I
[1:30:16] said, "Okay, tell me."
[1:30:19] And so she said, she said, "I got my
[1:30:21] ring." And I said, "You got your ring?"
[1:30:25] She said, "I've got my ring."
[1:30:27] And uh so I she said, "Let me tell you
[1:30:29] how this goes." So when when it was when
[1:30:32] the ring was was stolen, when when she
[1:30:35] when it was taken from her house, that's
[1:30:36] where it was at. The last place she had
[1:30:38] it was her house. and she had part of
[1:30:41] the uh part of the underwriting to be
[1:30:43] able to ride it. She had to have a um a
[1:30:46] safe in her in her house and she did.
[1:30:49] She had a safe and uh that was part of
[1:30:51] it to qualify for this this amount. But
[1:30:54] this this particular day she had worn
[1:30:57] the ring and she had come home and she
[1:31:00] had gone in her bedroom and she slipped
[1:31:02] it off and the last thing she remembered
[1:31:04] she laid it on top of a little small
[1:31:06] jewelry box and said I'm going to put it
[1:31:08] in the safe later tonight but when she
[1:31:10] was busy doing something she said that's
[1:31:12] the last thing I remember I put it on
[1:31:14] top of that jewelry box
[1:31:17] and then of course the claim was filed
[1:31:19] and now she's calling me back
[1:31:23] and she said, "You're not going to
[1:31:25] believe it." And and I'd ask her at that
[1:31:27] time, "Was anybody in your house? Did
[1:31:29] Did you have did you have visitors? Did
[1:31:31] you have No, no, no, no, no. You know,
[1:31:33] the only thing she said, I had some
[1:31:34] contractors outside." She said, "They
[1:31:37] were working on the uh the outside doing
[1:31:41] some landscaping."
[1:31:43] And she said, you know, she said, uh
[1:31:48] there was some electrical that needed to
[1:31:50] be done. and they subbed out the
[1:31:52] electrical and said, "Uh, an electrician
[1:31:55] came and I had to let him in the house
[1:31:57] and take him to LA to the panel and he
[1:31:59] turned it off, went out and did
[1:32:01] something and he come right back in and
[1:32:02] turned it on." He wasn't in the house
[1:32:04] just a few seconds and he and she said,
[1:32:06] "My bedroom 4,000 square foot onelevel
[1:32:09] house." She said, "My bedroom is all the
[1:32:11] way on the other end of the house from
[1:32:12] where the panel box was." So said there
[1:32:14] was nothing to that, but here's how you
[1:32:16] don't have to give the devil but a
[1:32:17] second.
[1:32:21] Right.
[1:32:23] So,
[1:32:25] so what happened was that electrician
[1:32:30] actually come in and saw just a quick
[1:32:33] opportunity and he shot had no hit the
[1:32:36] gold mine. had no idea what would been
[1:32:38] in her bedroom, but went to the bedroom
[1:32:42] and Brother Wade walked in and found
[1:32:44] that big huge rock
[1:32:47] on top of that jewelry box and grabbed
[1:32:49] it and out he went
[1:32:52] and he kept it for several days and he
[1:32:55] knew he had something
[1:32:58] and he so he was going to go try to he
[1:33:00] was going to try to sell it and pawn it
[1:33:03] and so he took it
[1:33:06] and out of all the places
[1:33:09] out of all the places that he could have
[1:33:12] taken that ring,
[1:33:14] the pawn shops, the jewelry stores. Come
[1:33:18] on,
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; of all the places, he goes to this one
[1:33:22] particular jewelry store and he goes in
[1:33:25] and he tells the the the jeweler, he
[1:33:28] says, "I've got a ring." He said, "I
[1:33:30] bought for my wife some time ago." Said,
[1:33:32] "We fallen on hard times." and said,
[1:33:35] "You know, I'd like to get uh just $4 or
[1:33:39] $5,000 out of this ring if I could." And
[1:33:42] he said, "Would you look at it?" So, the
[1:33:43] man took it and he looked at it. He
[1:33:46] said, "Well, let me go in the back here
[1:33:47] and and and and do some uh, you know,
[1:33:51] just some uh in-depth looking at it." So
[1:33:55] he took the ring back to the back room
[1:34:00] and he immediately when he when when the
[1:34:02] man gave him the ring and he looked it
[1:34:04] he said that ring looks familiar.
[1:34:07] And so he goes back and he looks at it
[1:34:10] and he said I know who this ring belongs
[1:34:13] to.
[1:34:14] I'm the one that made it.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:18] Now think about it because so so he so
[1:34:21] he gets on the phone and he calls Gail
[1:34:24] and he says Gail. She said, "Hey, what
[1:34:27] what's going on?" He said, "Uh, what's
[1:34:31] uh where's your ring?" And she said, "Oh
[1:34:35] Lord, you're not going to believe it."
[1:34:36] And and and it's gone. And and he and he
[1:34:40] told her a little bit of the story. He
[1:34:41] said, "I'll call you back." He said,
[1:34:42] "I've got your ring. Give me a few
[1:34:44] minutes." And he hung up and he called
[1:34:45] the police department.
[1:34:48] So he stepped back out and the man was
[1:34:50] there and the man was all anxious said,
[1:34:52] "Hey, you know, am I going to uh uh am I
[1:34:54] going to get what I was wanting?" He
[1:34:56] said, "You're going to get a lot more
[1:34:57] than what you was wanting."
[1:35:00] About that time, the city police was
[1:35:02] walking in. Now you think about it
