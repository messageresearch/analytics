[4:23] but keep in the back of your mind really
[4:25] honestly truly being a Christian there's
[4:27] no such thing as a divorce right amen no
[4:30] such thing as divorce I mean we're we
[4:31] were always we were chosen in him before

[4:39] that that happened a long time ago right
[4:42] we were always his bride amen that's
[4:44] right we weren't not his bride and then
[4:46] we become his bride yeah down here in
[4:48] the Gentile age we did but now as far as
[4:50] in his mind he always had a s he that's
[4:53] one he was looking for the whole time
[4:55] all right so just keep that in your mind
[4:57] and as as Brother D brings the U the
[5:00] series on marriage and divorce let's
[5:02] turn to Ephesians 5
[5:06] and read the scripture here and we'll

[5:52] sign up sheet for the Financial Peace
[5:55] University class that we're going to
[5:56] start in July if you're going to attend
[5:59] you need to put that down because we

[6:19] and and all the adult men in the church
[6:22] so just keep that in your prayers we'll
[6:24] start planning it and getting it ready I
[6:26] think we kind of know that one kind of
[6:27] comes together pretty good so we we've
[6:29] got that one down path so let's go to
[6:32] the Lord in prayer and ask him to
[6:34] bless Heavenly Father we pray that you'd
[6:36] be with us Lord just one more time Lord
[6:39] you've put us on this Earth Lord to be
[6:42] an example for you father and I know
[6:44] that we fail you every day but Lord
[6:47] there has to be a time that we come
[6:49] together under this present day truth
[6:51] that we have that you told us what to do
[6:55] you've you've instructed us on the
[6:56] things that we need to do you've
[6:58] instructed us us on things to help our
[7:00] life you've instructed us on things to
[7:02] help our finances you you've given like
[7:05] you did the children of Israel Lord
[7:06] you've given us a lot of things but
[7:08] sometimes we turn them away sometimes we
[7:10] commit iniquity because we were born in
[7:13] sin shaped in iniquity spouse from our
[7:16] mother's womb a liar but Heavenly Father
[7:19] you saw Grace and sent a sent your son
[7:23] Lord to take care of that to put us
[7:25] under that bleach blood that made us
[7:27] Lord Justified us Sanctified and filled
[7:30] us with the Holy Ghost and made us
[7:31] children of God lord we have to look to
[7:34] that Lord the author and finisher of our
[7:36] faith the one that did it all for us
[7:38] Lord so now as we live under your blood
[7:40] father you still give us things that
[7:42] we're supposed to do Lord you gave us
[7:44] Commandments and you gave us promises
[7:46] and things to to go by and walk thereby
[7:49] you gave us rulers and governors Lord to
[7:51] to teach us and and give us Lord
[7:53] admonition and father we pray today Lord
[7:56] that you would just come and just give
[7:58] us Lord the words the say to the people
[8:00] and may it be said in in the honest of
[8:02] our heart let it be taken in the honest
[8:06] of Heart Lord take it and study it and
[8:09] and live it Lord and and Lord we know we
[8:11] have to be in this body Lord until we're
[8:14] changed or till death will set us free
[8:17] so we have to learn to live in this body
[8:19] we know that it was that it commits sin
[8:22] every day you said through the prophet
[8:23] we'll read it in just a little while
[8:25] Lord that we sin every day but father
[8:27] you gave us an advocate you covered our
[8:30] sins Lord and not just covered them this
[8:31] time you've totally eradicated them Lord
[8:34] but it's got to come through the word of
[8:36] God not just being Lord lip service it's
[8:39] got to come from a knowledge a holy
[8:42] ghost knowledge that you truly have
[8:44] forgive us of our sins Lord today we
[8:46] pray that you'd be with the young people
[8:48] that you'd bless them Lord the ones that
[8:49] are looking for a spouse the ones that's
[8:51] looking for a companion in life Lord may
[8:54] they may they find one that's pleasing
[8:56] to you first and then pleasing to them
[8:59] father we pray that you'd be with us now
[9:00] take care of us heal the sick the ones
[9:02] that are not with us Lord bless them
[9:04] take care of them Lord be with the
[9:05] missionaries on the foreign field give
[9:07] them fruit for their labor father we
[9:09] pray today Lord if anybody's sick among
[9:11] us you said you sent your word and
[9:12] healed them and deliver them from their
[9:14] destruction so father we pray that as
[9:17] the word Goes Forth that we'll be healed
[9:19] and that we'll be Sanctified and filled
[9:21] with the Holy Ghost Lord just give us a
[9:22] refilling this morning we ask these
[9:25] things in Jesus name
[9:27] amen amen
[9:29] all right let's go to Ephesians 5 and
[9:31] that's what we've been reading on so
[9:32] we're still on choosing a spouse we went
[9:35] through two of the three things we went
[9:36] through the planning stage and the
[9:38] looking stage now today we're going to
[9:40] go into the praying stage and then I'm
[9:43] going to give you some things to do not
[9:45] do as you're choosing your spouse all
[9:49] right and if you're not if you've
[9:50] already chosen your spouse maybe it'll
[9:53] help you teach somebody that hadn't
[9:54] chose their spouse you know to be able
[9:56] to uh as parents be able to sit down and
[9:59] be able to talk to the kids and and may
[10:01] it be a Bible talk may it be something
[10:04] that you can go back into the word of
[10:05] God and tell the people tell your sons
[10:08] and daughters that hey this is the way
[10:09] if you'll do this this is the way God
[10:11] said we're going to have troubles and
[10:12] trials and tribulations but if you'll do
[10:14] this it'll surely make your life a lot
[10:16] easier all right so verse 28 of
[10:19] Ephesians 5 so ought men to love their
[10:21] wives as their own bodies he that loveth
[10:24] his wife loveth himself amen for no man
[10:27] ever hated his own flesh but isth it and
[10:29] cherisheth it even as the Lord the
[10:32] church for we are members of his body of
[10:35] his flesh and of his bone for this cause
[10:38] shall a man leave his father and mother
[10:40] and shall be joined unto his wife and
[10:42] they too shall be one flesh you may be
[10:47] seated and the Lord add his Blessing to
[10:48] the reading of the
[10:51] word we pray truly today now I'm going
[10:54] to give you a little bit of a warning
[10:56] for this
[10:57] afternoon when we get into the this is
[11:00] the choosing or the courtship part but
[11:02] when we get into the dating part this
[11:04] afternoon uh there's going to be some
[11:06] things said that you may you know you
[11:08] may need to have to explain it to the 10
[11:10] and 11 year olds but I'm going to have
[11:11] to say things to help you not to go down
[11:15] a certain Road there certain things that
[11:17] we need to talk about so I I hope we're
[11:19] all adults and like brother R said I
[11:21] hope we're all godm minded all right and
[11:24] we know that we still live in this body
[11:25] and there's lust of the flesh things
[11:28] that we have to keep under control all
[11:30] right Paul you know Paul said I keep
[11:31] under my body under control all right
[11:33] for the glory of the Lord but he was a
[11:36] born again Christian right that's the
[11:38] problem we get people that maybe are not
[11:40] born again they can't control this man
[11:42] cuz there's no man to take to take over
[11:44] to keep control that's why you shouldn't
[11:46] marry an unbeliever all right so now
[11:49] let's look at the kind of a background
[11:51] of what we were talking about we were
[11:52] talking about the three stages of
[11:54] choosing a spouse now this is pretty
[11:55] much the courtship part you say the
[11:58] courtship part
[11:59] dating is when you find somebody I
[12:02] you've honed it down to one person right
[12:05] all right this praying and looking and
[12:08] planning stage is the stage where you're
[12:11] looking and you're you're plan you're
[12:13] making the plan and you're looking for
[12:14] that person and you're praying about it
[12:17] that's the courtship part we think the
[12:19] courtship part is the dating no the
[12:21] courtship part is trying to find one
[12:25] yeah what's a court out here courtship
[12:29] you're looking around trying to find you
[12:31] a spouse you're looking remember we
[12:34] talked about planning I hope you didn't
[12:37] uh felt a little resistance from some
[12:39] people that sometimes were too
[12:43] carnal but I triy to bring you some
[12:45] scriptures where Paul and would saying
[12:47] look I I I got a Mark that I'm looking
[12:49] toward I've got a place I'm going right
[12:53] he had a plan yeah he didn't just say
[12:56] God don't want us to look God wants us
[12:58] to be led by the the Holy Ghost but he
[12:59] don't want us to sit down in our seat at
[13:02] home today and say God I know I got the
[13:05] Holy Ghost you said you'd be my teacher
[13:07] now I'm going to close my eyes and you
[13:09] just teach me and I'm just going to sit
[13:10] right here and you're going to bring me
[13:12] my food and you're going to bring me my
[13:14] cash and you're going to bring me this
[13:16] that's not it exactly we are living
[13:19] breathing human beings amen we have a
[13:22] brain we were made in the image of God
[13:24] even in a fallen condition we were made
[13:28] to be little creators look at all
[13:31] this this come from
[13:35] trees this once was a tree right 90% of
[13:39] this building was once a tree right and
[13:41] then this here was chemicals that come
[13:45] out of the ground right right car and
[13:48] all the things like that what you have
[13:50] on today come from a plant no if it's
[13:54] cotton there polyester then man put two
[13:56] or three things together and made
[13:57] polyester but cotton
[13:59] come from what the Earth all right now
[14:03] God give man
[14:05] cotton but then he give man the ability
[14:08] to take that cotton and make it into
[14:09] clothes right amen so what am I what am
[14:12] I saying uh you can say what you want to
[14:14] about planning if you don't plan like I
[14:17] said last Sunday if you fail to plan
[14:19] your plan will always
[14:21] fail in anything you do in life right
[14:24] anything you do in life I I see that
[14:26] that Paul had a plan he had a goal oh he
[14:29] had a mark he said and I press toward
[14:30] that Mark well he found the Mark didn't
[14:33] he amen well God didn't just pick him up
[14:35] and St him in the
[14:36] mark he said I
[14:39] run that I may run to the end right not
[14:43] run to fail all right plan remember we
[14:45] talking about this background for last
[14:47] week set a goal know what you want write
[14:51] it down young man write down on a piece
[14:53] of paper what you want your spouse to be
[14:57] right now look
[15:00] it doesn't start with whether they're
[15:02] skinny or
[15:03] fat
[15:06] amen Little Tim said I want a skinny
[15:12] one well I me you I said desire that's
[15:15] okay but look for character amen look
[15:18] for character right amen we might have
[15:20] all started out skinny at one time
[15:23] but things happen amen gravity takes
[15:27] over
[15:29] and pushes whatever here down
[15:31] there so at once you know like sister
[15:34] Gail said she had this lifeguard that
[15:36] she married right well it looks more
[15:38] like a beach ball
[15:41] now my but he's your that's right but
[15:45] listen we must look me too I mean he's
[15:49] not much bigger than I
[15:51] am but look what's the first thing we do
[15:54] we start going with looks and is she
[15:56] this and is he that that's not what
[15:59] we're talking about right character is
[16:02] what we're talking about right somebody
[16:04] that has Christian values and character
[16:07] amen how many of us now you know you can
[16:10] hold your hand if you want to but how
[16:11] many of us married somebody that wasn't
[16:13] in the message I did right Terence did
[16:16] we got a lot of people did right well
[16:20] you know that's okay but like I was
[16:21] telling
[16:22] you that was a long time
[16:26] ago 30 years ago for me 32 coming up
[16:30] folks we're closer to the end now than
[16:32] ever yes at least we're 32 years closer
[16:35] than when I was so you better if you're
[16:37] coming up of age you young men you got
[16:40] to not make as many mistakes as we do
[16:43] and I think God has give us people to
[16:45] teach you that right that you don't make
[16:48] those mistake those mistakes that we
[16:49] made all right right exactly so that's
[16:52] why this afternoon we're going to talk
[16:53] about the dating stage but right now
[16:55] we're still in the choosing a spouse
[16:58] we're choosing we're looking we're we're
[17:00] planning we're writing down what we want
[17:04] we want our spouse to stay at home or is
[17:06] it okay for her to work are we going to
[17:08] have children in the first year are we
[17:09] going to have children in the fourth
[17:10] year we going to have this write those
[17:12] things
[17:14] down write it down and look at it right
[17:18] study it take the Bible take the
[17:20] prophet's message we give you all the
[17:22] quotes you'll have all these all these
[17:25] um messages have got all this attached
[17:28] to so if you ever want to go back to it
[17:30] make your little book of it I don't care
[17:32] what you do with
[17:33] it brother Joe's going to make a um an
[17:36] MP3 just of that so that if you want to
[17:38] listen back to it you can and refer back
[17:40] to it right uh be good for the young
[17:42] people to do it again but look we were
[17:45] talking about setting a goal but now the
[17:46] goals you set has it reveals your choice
[17:49] reveals your goal so what you choose
[17:51] right should reveal what your plan or
[17:53] your goal was right right okay and we're
[17:56] going to talk about some of those things
[17:57] not to to look for today now let's go to
[18:01] Philippians 3:13-14 that's what we
[18:03] talking
[18:04] about Paul was planning Brethren I count
[18:07] not myself to have apprehended but
[18:09] there's one thing I do forgetting those
[18:12] things which are behind and reaching
[18:14] forth unto those things which are before
[18:17] I press toward the mark right he had a
[18:20] goal he had a plan he had something to
[18:22] do Paul did I press toward the mark for
[18:25] the prize of the High Calling of God God
[18:28] in Christ amen so his goal was to what
[18:32] put Christians in the in heaven or
[18:35] whatever you want to say put put
[18:36] Christianity to where that you can have
[18:39] what he has all right same thing with
[18:41] choosing of a spouse you don't want to
[18:43] choose a spouse that's wrong right when
[18:46] you're
[18:48] looking the word look means to turn one
[18:51] eyes toward something when you say look
[18:54] what do you do you're looking you turn
[18:56] your head but remember when you turn
[18:58] your head now you need to turn it toward
[19:00] a real believer not somebody that's sat
[19:02] in the message to you for 15 20 years 5
[19:05] years 2 years character loyalty love and
[19:10] where they come from that's what we
[19:11] talked about before amen was very
[19:13] important all right know what you're
[19:15] looking for know what you're looking
[19:18] at right look is to turn one eyes toward
[19:22] something
[19:23] now let's start with the praying
[19:27] part praying means to make an Earnest
[19:30] petition and it's not God I want this
[19:33] woman can you give her to me no don't
[19:36] start your prayer that way right God I'm
[19:39] looking for a Godly woman don't put a
[19:42] name on it I'm looking for this kind of
[19:45] person Amen in my goals and my plan I'm
[19:47] looking for this kind of person and
[19:50] after you planned and look for that one
[19:51] person and found her now you have to
[19:53] pray so you're heading toward the dating
[19:56] processor all right you're heading
[19:58] toward it there's some things I want to
[20:00] show you when we get into the dating
[20:01] that brother brand says do not
[20:04] do when you take the dating sequence is
[20:07] the very very serious part all right
[20:11] this courtship part is not so very
[20:13] serious because you're
[20:15] looking you know you we always call it
[20:18] testing the water yeah but remember
[20:20] there's sharks in that water yeah so be
[20:23] careful of the Sharks and the water so
[20:25] we'll talk about that in just a few
[20:26] seconds we we'll do that and actually
[20:29] the next one coming up but after you've
[20:31] planned and looked for that one person
[20:32] and found him or her now you have to
[20:33] pray not just a short prayer thank you
[20:35] Lord you gave her to me yeah thank you
[20:37] Lord no you pray pray through on the
[20:39] matter the prophet said trust the Lord
[20:41] but be willing to accept and no or not
[20:44] now because remember what I always say
[20:47] God's knows are the best yeses you can
[20:48] have amen God tells you know that's the
[20:51] best yes you'll ever get cuz if he tells
[20:53] you know he knows what's going to happen
[20:55] in your in your future you don't if he
[20:58] says no he knows if he says yes he's not
[21:01] like us as as Earthly parents we might
[21:05] say yes and then wish we' have said no
[21:07] about two weeks later or a month later
[21:09] or two months later but God is a perfect
[21:11] parent if he says no he knows if he says
[21:14] yes brother Eddie somewhere down the
[21:16] line you're going to mess up but if he
[21:18] says no he's keeping you from that all
[21:21] right everybody understand that God's
[21:23] knows are the best yeses you'll ever
[21:25] have all right let's go to First quote
[21:29] and listen what brother Brown said about
[21:31] this marriage is Honorable but it should
[21:34] be entered

[22:49] together amen so that we can be in
[22:51] eternity together all right and is if

[23:02] that you'll spring back again to young
[23:03] men and women to live together forever
[23:04] that's God's Eternal promise he said he
[23:06] would do it he not only that would get
[23:09] to an Ament he swore he would do it amen
[23:12] so God swore that if you whatever you
[23:14] bind on Earth I'll bind in
[23:16] heaven remember he said that when we are
[23:20] joined together that it's done it's
[23:23] finished right
[23:25] remember the Lord said whatever you bind
[23:28] on Earth I'll bind in heaven let's go to
[23:31] number
[23:34] two H certain sound a man nowadays
[23:36] getting married you young fellas you
[23:38] better pray a long time ask God to give
[23:42] you a companion you young women the same
[23:44] way cuz it's so uncertain number
[23:50] three why it's alarming no wonder the
[23:53] home life is gone see any home life
[23:55] that's not
[23:56] stable what I said told you about
[23:59] marriage about divorces and all this
[24:00] stuff you just don't it's not stable I
[24:02] don't care how good you think it is oh
[24:04] yeah right I don't care how good you
[24:06] think it is well me and my ex-wife we
[24:07] get along just fine no you don't if you
[24:10] did you'd still be married to her yeah
[24:13] and vice Vera I mean her problem I mean
[24:15] ain't just her problem to you you got a
[24:17] problem to her too there always two
[24:19] sides of this thing any woman that's
[24:21] going to marry a
[24:23] man any woman is going to marry a man
[24:26] and she's not certain of that man she
[24:28] better leave him alone right and any man
[24:30] that's going to marry a woman that's why
[24:32] we go through these stages we go through
[24:34] the courtship and the dating process you
[24:37] better leave her alone you better pray
[24:38] through on it until God gives you the
[24:41] answer right and then what God joins
[24:45] together let no man put us under but we
[24:48] first we must pray through on that yes I
[24:52] think we'll have one
[24:53] more choosing of a bride you need to
[24:56] read that book
[24:59] I think today what's got so many divorce
[25:02] cases now that we leave the world in
[25:03] America in divorce cases yeah we lead
[25:06] the rest of the world I mean we got
[25:08] drive-thru divorces now yeah 299 you go
[25:11] up to the window and tell them you want
[25:12] a divorce and you get a divorce but we
[25:15] made it so easy why because it's just so
[25:17] easy hey me and my spouse don't get
[25:18] along with let get a divorce yeah
[25:20] there's more divorces here than anywhere
[25:22] else this nation and supposed to be and
[25:25] thought of a Christian Nation what a
[25:27] reproach our horp I think the reason of
[25:30] it is because that men got away from God
[25:33] and women got away from God and we find
[25:36] that if a man prayed now look how many
[25:38] times he said pray you ought to look
[25:39] this up how many times brother R talks
[25:41] about a man praying and a woman praying
[25:42] for a spouse if a man prayed and a woman
[25:45] prayed over the matter not just look at
[25:47] a pretty set of eyes or how big strong
[25:50] shoulders or such as that or some other
[25:53] worldly affection but would look first
[25:55] to God and say God is this your plan
[25:58] amen oh so God's got a plan right I read
[26:01] you that last Sunday Christ mystery God
[26:03] reveal brother said God had a plan and a
[26:06] purpose so God's got a plan right amen
[26:09] and if we would
[26:11] study we study about everything
[26:16] else but sometimes it's hard for us to
[26:18] study about getting married yeah and if
[26:20] we would study what we're doing when
[26:23] we're going to get married when we
[26:25] choose our wife our husband if we'd
[26:27] study over it a man should pray
[26:31] earnestly for he could ruin his entire
[26:34] life Remember The Vow is until death do
[26:37] we part that's what I said if a
[26:38] Christian man marries a Christian woman
[26:40] it's till death do you part there's no
[26:41] separation there's I mean you can
[26:43] separate for a time but we brother Dale
[26:45] get into that you know about well you
[26:47] can actually cause cause your wife to
[26:49] commit adulterine right and you're held
[26:51] accountable for it all right right right
[26:53] Remember The Vow is until death do we
[26:55] part and he could ruin his Life by
[26:58] making the wrong
[26:59] choice but now look when we get to the
[27:01] end of this this afternoon there's a
[27:04] thing called Grace yeah and we'll cover
[27:06] that also all right cuz a lot of us
[27:08] needed it cuz we're not sitting here in
[27:09] with a perfect marriage condition right
[27:12] right well you can admit it or not you
[27:14] say Amen but I know your life so but if
[27:16] he knows what he making the wrong choice
[27:20] and is marrying a woman that isn't fit
[27:21] to be his wife and he does it
[27:24] anyway then it's his fault right yeah
[27:27] you can't blame nobody else right it's
[27:29] your fault but if a woman takes a
[27:32] husband and knows that he's not fit to
[27:34] be a husband to you then that's your own
[27:37] fault after you know what's right and
[27:39] wrong right so you shouldn't do it until
[27:41] you thoroughly pray through amen all
[27:44] right everybody understand thatly that's
[27:47] pretty that's pretty pretty blunt from a
[27:49] prophet praying all right let's go to
[27:52] the next one the object of praying is to
[27:55] find the will of the Lord not to find
[27:57] your your will
[27:59] right find the will of the Lord right
[28:02] then say yes Lord that's right see this
[28:05] will help get the fleshly motives and
[28:07] objectives out of the way cuz God's not
[28:08] dealing In the Flesh right when you pray
[28:11] he's not dealing In the Flesh amen
[28:13] you're you're praying spiritually to a
[28:15] spiritual God but he knows your fleshly
[28:18] condition so therefore he is he's a
[28:20] perfect father if we'll listen to him
[28:22] all right listen to number five Prophet
[28:26] Elisha now that's that's what we do
[28:29] sometimes look at this sometimes we go
[28:31] off on a tantrum somewhere and not think
[28:34] about God not pray over it ask the Lord
[28:37] whether we should do it or not and we
[28:39] find out that our supply of
[28:42] blessings is cut off you ever read that
[28:46] quote our supply of
[28:48] blessing is cut
[28:50] off then we wonder sometimes well wonder
[28:54] why I can't have no more
[28:56] blessings you don't watch you let down
[28:59] in your prayer life you say well I'm a
[29:01] Christian well that's the more sign you
[29:03] should pray more than ever amen read the
[29:06] Bible every day pray every day don't
[29:10] make any
[29:13] decisions too harshly or too quickly
[29:18] without first considering God about it
[29:21] remember what daddy always says you come
[29:22] up and you say brother Dale I'm going to
[29:23] buy this brand new car what do you think
[29:25] Lord bless you you already made your de
[29:28] you're not asking me my opinion you're
[29:31] telling me what you're going to do
[29:33] you're just asking for a stamp of
[29:34] approval right of what you're fixing to
[29:41] do buy something like that or anything
[29:43] you need to just you need to say hey if
[29:45] a situation comes up it's like brother
[29:47] Brown said one time he said people
[29:48] believe me while I'm in the pull pit
[29:50] yeah he said but out here in in Family
[29:52] Matters he said they don't listen to me
[29:54] right like that brother that I told you
[29:56] about that brother AR that that uh Lord
[29:59] Brother Brown the Lord through brother
[30:01] Brown told him said you should never
[30:02] handle your finances well why go see
[30:04] somebody if you're not going to do what
[30:06] he says right exactly he wasting time
[30:11] but I'm sure you know what brother Brown
[30:12] probably knew that I mean he discerned
[30:14] that that man was so stubborn and that's
[30:15] a lot of our problem we're so stubborn
[30:17] we don't we don't consider that if
[30:19] brother Dale is our pastor and he's the
[30:20] one that's supposed to be our leader and
[30:22] we go off and do something off the wall
[30:24] because we feel good about it or or we
[30:27] we get all upset about it and then you
[30:29] say well yeah he's my pastor but yeah we
[30:32] we'll handle this one no I don't know
[30:34] about that that's right ask him shall I
[30:36] do this father ask him is it your will
[30:39] for me to do this then see what the holy
[30:41] spirit will speak to you right he might
[30:44] not give you a vision but he will speak
[30:46] in some way to
[30:48] you could be another human
[30:52] being
[30:54] wow he might not give you a vision but
[30:57] he will speaking some way to you to let
[30:59] you
[31:00] know and look where I underline that if
[31:03] you'll be sincere asking right there's
[31:06] the part be sincere and ask him I need
[31:09] an answer to this question and be
[31:11] sincere all right number
[31:13] six questions an
[31:16] answer see brother talking about waiting
[31:18] on a vision God doesn't deal with in
[31:21] Visions with many people right so
[31:23] therefore I wouldn't advise you to do
[31:24] that see don't sit and wait for a vision
[31:26] if you can never had one okay you may
[31:29] still be sitting there for a while God
[31:31] may give you a vision that's okay but
[31:33] look at what he says God deals with us
[31:36] different read that so I would if I was
[31:39] in your place and didn't have visions
[31:40] from before the Lord I would just wait
[31:42] upon the Lord and say Lord now you show
[31:45] me what's the decision to make right and
[31:48] then way you feel led to do it then wait
[31:51] B see that Lord now you tell me and then
[31:56] way you feel to do it then wait just a
[31:59] little bit right then wait a little
[32:02] longer that's right and see which way
[32:05] which side you lean towards which way
[32:08] the spirit say now father in my heart
[32:10] you know it doesn't matter now that's
[32:12] where we should start that right amen it
[32:14] doesn't matter Lord but I want to know
[32:17] what you want me to do about it and then
[32:19] he says that's the way he does in
[32:20] meetings he'll wait and he'll get the
[32:22] feeling of the Lord and then he'll
[32:23] follow that way that's a way to do it
[32:25] cuz it's in prayer then you do the the
[32:27] best you can even the best we can we
[32:29] make mistakes we know that but if we'll
[32:32] follow this plan of prayer wait wait a
[32:35] little longer so we're praying waiting
[32:38] wait a little longer all right now let's
[32:42] go to here before we enter the dating
[32:46] phase let's look at some clear dos and
[32:48] don'ts now these are going to be wrote
[32:49] down on the paper here so you can see
[32:51] them you don't have to write them down
[32:52] cuz little they're a little lengthy but
[32:54] I brought in some scripture and I also
[32:57] brought in some quotes to back it up of
[33:00] some dos and
[33:02] don'ts and not heeding to These Warnings
[33:04] could lead to disaster in your life so
[33:06] this is very important these should be
[33:08] discussed before a serious relationship
[33:10] begins amen all right let's go number
[33:13] one do not date an
[33:16] unbeliever now brother bandam said he
[33:19] never told you to date an unbeliever he
[33:20] said do not date an unbeliever right all
[33:23] right second Corinthians says be you not
[33:26] unequally y together with unbelievers
[33:28] right for what Fellowship has
[33:30] righteousness with unrighteousness and
[33:32] what communion has light with Darkness
[33:35] amen oh but she comes to
[33:41] church her actions will prove what she
[33:43] is right or he is all right let's look
[33:46] at number seven quote here be certain of
[33:47] God and then in this wedding instead of
[33:50] marrying among his own people he went
[33:52] over and Mar a siner he's talking about
[33:53] Ahab and Jezebel I tell him Brother
[33:55] Anderson I met a girl yesterday came to
[33:57] the car lot her name was Jezebel yeah I
[34:01] told she was from Puerto Rico I said you
[34:03] know what they did to Jezebel in the
[34:04] Bible don't you she said yeah I know
[34:05] everybody told
[34:07] me but my mother named me this I said
[34:10] well okay all right I think I change it
[34:12] but he married Jezebel and she was not a
[34:16] Believer and no believer should ever
[34:18] marry an unbeliever now look under no
[34:21] circumstance cuz we're going to see in
[34:23] just a few minutes or later on this
[34:24] evening that that here's the famous
[34:27] quote well I'll date them or I'll start
[34:31] seeing them so I'll get them to come to
[34:33] church or get them to become a Christian
[34:35] you watch what brother rown says about
[34:37] that he says the Hound of Hell's out for
[34:39] you if you do that no believer should
[34:42] ever marry an unbeliever under no
[34:43] circumstance should always marry
[34:47] Believers but Ahab had done this evil
[34:49] thing and no doubt but what Jezebel was
[34:51] a beautiful woman and he'd fall for what
[34:54] she looked like instead of what she was
[34:57] so many people make that same mistake to
[35:01] this day she brought idolatry in the
[35:04] nation on the people she actually look
[35:07] at that the people the priest their
[35:09] ministers everything fell victim to
[35:11] Jezebel cuz he married an unbeliever all
[35:14] right number
[35:18] eight just like today when a Christian
[35:20] boy marries a sinner girl or a sinner
[35:22] girl a Christian boy that starts
[35:25] something right then
[35:27] see don't you get married unless you're
[35:30] equally yolked together with Believers
[35:32] you know to keep
[35:35] trouble
[35:37] down now look read this next one when
[35:39] God made man men and women in the
[35:41] beginning he made their Spirits then
[35:43] there's someone for you just wait see
[35:47] all right now let's go to the next one
[35:49] number
[35:52] nine AIA was the son of Ahab and that's
[35:55] what he's talking about his father had
[35:56] made married out of Fellowship married a
[35:58] woman that was not a Believer and that's
[36:00] all that always makes a bad home for any
[36:03] kid to be raised in that when unbelief
[36:06] and Faith tries to mix
[36:10] together now I don't know if some of you
[36:12] have unbeliev and husbands and
[36:13] unbelieving wives but they somewhere you
[36:14] going to have to deal with this with
[36:16] your
[36:17] children because if you're
[36:22] iniquity cuz if your iniquity of knowing
[36:24] to do better not doing it or not praying
[36:26] about it passed down to your kids yeah
[36:28] uh brother Brown said that I think I got
[36:30] a quote this afternoon it shows that
[36:32] brother Brown says visited iniquity is
[36:34] from the parents to the children talks
[36:36] about being a a a flapper and then a
[36:39] course girl course girl flapper
[36:41] prostitute right on down so it keeps
[36:43] falling all right because of the because
[36:45] of the generations I'm sorry that's just
[36:47] what it is but remember we're no good no
[36:49] not one we're not throwing stones in
[36:51] anybody but there's somewhere you going
[36:52] to have to deal with this cuz any bad
[36:54] home or any kids raised in this home
[36:56] brother say is a bad home yeah when
[36:58] unbelief and Faith tries to mix together
[37:00] now if the father had been a real strong
[37:02] man in his faith the child might have
[37:04] had a better opportunity but he didn't
[37:06] he didn't have he knew that there was
[37:08] God he knew there was Jehovah then his
[37:10] mother's God and so forth he was all
[37:12] confused and after the death of his
[37:14] father this boy in this condition kind
[37:16] of mixed up one way or the other and if
[37:18] that ain't a picture of the lands today
[37:21] one in the family is this way and one
[37:22] another and one going this way and one
[37:24] going that way now you could be married
[37:27] and that happen oh yeah you better be
[37:29] careful don't be looking at people
[37:31] sitting here with s that are single no
[37:33] you better be looking at your own life
[37:34] right one going this way and one that
[37:36] way no wonder we are
[37:39] producing we are producing so much
[37:43] juvenile delinquency right and all other
[37:46] kinds of stuff under the name of
[37:48] Christianity right it's because there's
[37:50] no Unity there's no real call out and
[37:53] stand for God Amen that's your prophet
[37:57] argue with him all right so
[38:01] never
[38:03] never never start a dating relationship
[38:06] with somebody you know you can't have
[38:07] right amen so if you start dating an
[38:10] unbeliever you not supposed to have that
[38:12] person so don't don't get yourself mixed
[38:15] up in it don't let emotions begin to
[38:17] take hold God cannot and will not bless
[38:20] this situation because of that quote
[38:21] that I showed you look in first
[38:25] Corinthians
[38:27] this says be not deceived evil
[38:29] communication corrupts good maners now
[38:31] look in the in the U NIV version then I
[38:34] pull this out the NIV version this is
[38:36] what it says about that scripture bad
[38:38] company corrupts good morals yeah
[38:41] right you hang around Bad Company long
[38:44] enough it's going to destroy your
[38:46] morals been
[38:49] there been there thank you be not
[38:53] deceived evil Communications corrupt
[38:56] good
[38:57] manners that's why you don't hang around
[38:59] you not you don't hang around people
[39:00] that tell dirty jokes you don't hang
[39:01] around people that do all the talks
[39:03] about all these things of the world and
[39:05] and these movie stars and all that stuff

[39:08] shouldn't be a part of anything you
[39:10] listen to you should walk away from that
[39:12] junk sh your very parents of evil we'll
[39:15] we'll get into that a little bit later
[39:16] on all right let's look at a quote on
[39:18] that and see so it is I watched many
[39:21] times the wolf after the deer now here
[39:23] it is right here yeah if he can catch a
[39:25] little deer out of it that's the one
[39:27] they work on there's a
[39:29] lesson if he can catch a deer that's why
[39:31] the that's why animals her together yeah
[39:34] there's power in numbers right amen but
[39:37] now what happens is there's one will get
[39:39] out over here and think he's doing a
[39:40] little better than the rest of them and
[39:41] he can outrun the cheetah or the leopard
[39:45] well watch this there's a lesson if he
[39:47] can catch a deer away from the
[39:49] herd what let an unbeliever go out with
[39:52] an I mean let a Believer go out with an
[39:54] unbeliever right same scenario that's
[39:58] what the devil wants to do so you young
[40:01] ladies he wants you to go out with a boy
[40:03] that's not a Christian you too young man
[40:05] he wants you to go out with some little
[40:07] pain in Jezebel that's not a Christian
[40:10] right that's where he wants to break you
[40:12] up that's where he wants to he wants to
[40:14] Sock his teeth into you and this little
[40:16] deer will get out to itself away from
[40:18] the herd that's the one the wolf works
[40:21] on and to you old man or woman when you
[40:24] separate yourself from believers yeah
[40:27] hello somebody people say I can stay at
[40:30] home hello that's right that ought to
[40:34] hit a bunch of y'all sitting here today
[40:36] CU they're not going to see you tonight
[40:37] this afternoon I can stay at home be
[40:40] just as good Christian as I can what the
[40:42] prophet say right here I want you to
[40:44] read this
[40:46] yeah say it
[40:48] again so you're fooling
[40:50] yourself if you think you can the Bible
[40:52] said not forsake our assemble together
[40:55] and that much more we see the time
[40:57] coming if you're a Christian you long to
[40:59] go where other Christians are amen and
[41:02] fellowship with other Christians right
[41:04] so you cannot stay away from church and
[41:06] live the same life that's right you read
[41:09] that can't do it you can smirk and smile
[41:12] all you want to you can't do it you
[41:14] cannot do
[41:16] it I I'm I'm Brother Richard Marlo is he
[41:18] here he see it BL his hard he's been
[41:21] sick this weekend but his son I got a
[41:24] burden on my heart for that boy amen he
[41:26] he just needs to get around some
[41:28] Believers yes so you cannot stay away
[41:31] from church and live the same life you
[41:33] can't do it because it's like I'm hungry
[41:36] but I'll never go to the table I just
[41:38] I'll never eat I just I ain't going to
[41:41] do it see you got to go and feed on the
[41:43] word of God and fellowship one with
[41:45] another we need one a mother another we
[41:49] do need a mother we need one another
[41:53] more now than we ever
[41:54] did amen when you get yourself singled
[41:57] out from the rest of them that's making
[41:59] yourself just a little
[42:01] different when you single yourself out
[42:03] from the rest of them making yourself a
[42:05] little different you don't want to
[42:07] associate with them because they believe
[42:09] this and don't want to associate with
[42:10] that you're going on Dangerous
[42:13] Ground right then keeping away from
[42:16] church that's the success of my meetings
[42:19] is because real godly people pray for me
[42:22] right I wanted to put that in there but
[42:24] pretty clear Bad Company
[42:26] corrupts good morals all right let's go
[42:29] to the next one number
[42:31] 11 but now when he comes down and make
[42:34] fellowship with Ahab and he get in
[42:36] trouble now Ahab and when you take the
[42:37] world is trying to find fellowship with
[42:39] you just remember there's a rabbit in
[42:41] the W wood pile somewhere right when you
[42:44] take that little cigarette smoking boy
[42:46] that wants to take you out at night time
[42:48] young lady you chis Pentecostal girls
[42:50] that little Drinker and his hair comb
[42:52] down slick enough to hold his mouth
[42:55] open you reckon he saw that somewhere I
[42:59] think he did let me tell you something
[43:02] now there's something in the making
[43:04] right he says I'll marry you dear and
[43:07] then I'll join your church
[43:09] right he's a lying to you right if you
[43:13] if you love if you loves you and loves
[43:16] the Lord should be a PE I guess he will
[43:19] do it then he don't have to take you
[43:23] that's right and you men you young boys
[43:25] with some of these little p up Jezebels
[43:27] the same way you shouldn't do that shame
[43:29] on the pastor that fails to say that in
[43:30] the church so we said it we are called
[43:33] out separated different people
[43:35] Sanctified to the Lord in Israel all
[43:39] right sure the Bible said the devil
[43:40] would do it that in the last days and
[43:42] that's exactly what he's doing what he's
[43:47] separating he's taking unbelievers and
[43:49] Believers and putting them together all
[43:51] right let's go to the last one number 12
[43:53] any time evangelism God wants his people
[43:56] be separated from unbelief and
[43:57] unbelievers so many of you people make a
[43:59] mistake in this sometimes letting your
[44:01] children play out here a little
[44:04] Oswald or you can put whatever name you
[44:06] want to in I guess oswal was popular
[44:08] back them see I don't mean to be
[44:10] different now and start you and so forth
[44:12] and be some kind of fanatic I don't mean
[44:14] that but you let a you be sure your
[44:16] daughter goes out be sure who your
[44:18] daughter goes out with at night time
[44:20] right see maybe you raised her a goded
[44:23] little old girl around the church and
[44:25] the first thing you know she gets out
[44:26] with Oswald or some of them and he's an
[44:29] atheist
[44:30] unbeliever and her life will come up
[44:34] ruined and you don't know what he is
[44:36] right you see then he'll marry her and
[44:40] look for your kids or your grandkids
[44:41] then you see be careful God wants his
[44:45] people to be separated all right number
[44:48] two you cannot marry a divorced person
[44:51] with a living husband now that ought to
[44:53] be self-explanatory Brother D was going
[44:54] to cover this but I thought I'd br bring
[44:56] it out in here in the dos and don'ts so
[44:58] don't even don't even yoke yourself up
[45:01] with somebody that's been divorced so
[45:02] cuz you can't marry them amen and he
[45:05] saith unto them in Mark 10 whosoever
[45:07] shall put away his wife and marry
[45:09] another right committeth adultery
[45:11] against her and if a woman shall put
[45:12] away her husband and be buried to
[45:14] another she committeth adultery all
[45:17] right let's go to Matthew this is Jesus
[45:19] speaking it has said whosoever shall put
[45:22] away his wife let him give her a writing
[45:24] of divorcement but I said un you that
[45:26] whosoever shall put away his wife saving
[45:28] for the cause of fornication we're going
[45:30] to talk about that this afternoon not
[45:31] this morning but this afternoon causing
[45:34] her to commit adultery causeth her to
[45:37] commit adultery and whosoever shall
[45:39] marry her that is divorced commit
[45:41] adultery amen all right so that's pretty
[45:43] cut and dry we know we got we have Grace
[45:45] but listen to this we wouldn't need
[45:49] Grace if we' quit marrying unbelievers
[45:51] right well I mean we know we always
[45:53] going to need Grace but I'm talking
[45:54] about for married and divorce
[45:56] cuz remember two Christians don't
[45:58] divorce right now brother Brown is there
[46:01] any Scripture permitting marriage after
[46:03] divorce this is very important it says
[46:04] important well that's the reason it
[46:06] wasn't pertaining to this cuz that's the
[46:08] question aners on the seal as far as I
[46:10] can see my brother or sister whoever it
[46:12] may be there isn't unless your
[46:13] companions dead because the Bible said
[46:16] we're bound to them as long as they live
[46:19] so as far as scripture he don't have
[46:20] scripture that's it you've done took an
[46:23] oath over that you see so I don't think
[46:25] there is
[46:26] but as far as myself I don't find any in
[46:29] other words there's no scripture to say
[46:31] that so there's no reason for you to be
[46:33] dating or even looking at somebody
[46:35] that's been divorced sorry you can't do
[46:36] that right okay it's just one of them
[46:40] definite definite knows
[46:42] right now if he takes you in deception
[46:44] or she takes you in deception there was
[46:46] a a pointing case brother forny was
[46:48] telling me and this this brother was
[46:51] dating this sister and she was like from
[46:53] New York and she had moved down to
[46:55] whatever South Carolina North Carolina I
[46:56] can't remember it wasn't in Brother
[46:57] Jules church but it was something he was
[46:59] dealing with and the brother was dating
[47:02] her she said there's nothing in my life
[47:04] everything's okay so they made the vow
[47:07] to get married got married and on the
[47:08] wedding night if you understand what I'm
[47:10] saying he found out she wasn't a Virg
[47:12] she confessed that night that she had
[47:15] been with several men and that she even
[47:17] had a
[47:18] child that night the man immediately got
[47:21] up left wherever they were drove back
[47:25] home and had somebody come and pick that
[47:27] girl up now see what you see what you
[47:30] get into right now he's got a legal
[47:32] right mhm right and a Godly right and a
[47:35] scriptural right to put that woman away
[47:37] and marry somebody else and God never
[47:39] never worry about him being he's not
[47:41] double married though he went through
[47:43] all that cuz it was under a vow and she
[47:45] had committed fornication but he did it
[47:48] immediately he didn't wait till 3 days
[47:49] later after the honeymoon you understand
[47:51] what I'm saying right at that moment
[47:53] immediately he gets up and goes home
[47:55] tells that woman go get your daddy come
[47:57] pick you up and the of course it was all
[48:00] done separated and the the woman left
[48:03] but see you really don't hold things
[48:05] back you need to talk exactly talk about
[48:08] these things she said well I was afraid
[48:10] you wouldn't date me he said well you've
[48:12] already messed yourself up
[48:14] anyway you were messed up before I found
[48:17] you right and now you put me in a bad
[48:19] situation even though he's clean to do
[48:22] what he wants to do he still got that
[48:23] stuck in his brain right
[48:26] okay so and you can't even man someone
[48:28] that's been engaged right remember the
[48:31] sacredness of The Vow let's go to number
[48:35] 14 brother Brandon what is the meaning
[48:37] of an nor daddy read this one but let's
[48:39] read it again are people free to marry
[48:41] or is it just another word for divorce
[48:42] I'd like some information on this sure
[48:45] they're married long as they take that
[48:47] vow they're married just like a boy if a
[48:49] boy promises a girl to marry her under
[48:51] good
[48:52] faith so you should be going through the
[48:54] planning looking praying dating before
[48:58] any of this is discussed as far as hey
[49:01] let's get married yeah okay and the
[49:03] asking part should be right at the very
[49:05] end right amen she's just as good as
[49:08] married her the only thing the law does
[49:10] it gives you a bill and rights to live
[49:11] together to keep from being common law
[49:13] husband and wife but when a man tells a
[49:15] woman I'll marry you honey I'll take you
[49:17] for my wife will you take he's married
[49:20] your vow is sacred that's what marries
[49:22] you anyhow amen there's not no preacher
[49:24] can marry you Mistry nothing else it's
[49:26] your own vow to God and to this man when
[49:29] you promise you're married and a little
[49:31] lady if you promise to marry that boy
[49:34] you're obligated to do it if you marry
[49:36] another after that obligation you will
[49:39] from now on anyhow you'll be living in
[49:41] adultery right and notice now see she's
[49:44] she's pure as a lily as far as her
[49:46] virginity far as her natural virginity
[49:49] right she's just committed to say I'll
[49:52] marry you and then breaks it off brother
[49:54] BR said that's is just the same name has
[49:55] commit an adultery right amen from now
[49:57] on you'll be living in adultery she goes
[50:00] and marri somebody else she'll be living
[50:01] in adultery right it's very serious
[50:03] young kids it's very serious I I wish
[50:06] we'd all had somebody sit down and
[50:07] explain this to us before we started
[50:10] doing what we did and notice the same
[50:13] thing to a boy promising to marry a
[50:15] woman don't you make your vow to anyone
[50:17] unless you mean to stick with it
[50:18] remember there's the Bible for it Joseph
[50:20] promised to marry Mary you have to keep
[50:23] your vows when you promise a woman that
[50:25] she's a sacred little vessel and that's
[50:26] to bring child life into the world again
[50:28] so when you promise her you must marry
[50:31] her amen so you can't marry somebody
[50:33] that's been engaged right everybody got
[50:36] that amen okay number four here's the
[50:39] one I can change him or her after we're
[50:43] married this is Satan's life dating or
[50:47] marriage is not a witnessing opportunity
[50:49] right amen it's not a witness
[50:52] tool do not play with this idea IDE
[50:56] right you will get burned right pray for
[50:59] people witness to them invite them to
[51:02] church but do not use yourself as bait
[51:05] amen right oh if I could just get him to
[51:07] go to church with him
[51:09] yeah I'm just telling you what the
[51:11] prophet said let let's go through number
[51:14] 15 vasion of the United States let's
[51:17] read the the quote part just save time
[51:21] you take a man that's a good moral man
[51:23] and let him marry a little woman that
[51:24] ain't worth a dime it isn't long till he
[51:26] ain't worth a dime either right that's
[51:29] what happened to Ahab take the same vice
[51:31] versa let a nice little woman marry an
[51:33] old man that ain't worth a dime first
[51:35] thing you know she's doing the same
[51:36] thing he is how could I go this morning
[51:39] and point my hands on little broken up
[51:41] homes and things like that where lovely
[51:42] little mothers come into a drinking dad
[51:45] and things like that and thought they
[51:46] could do something with them right and
[51:50] now the whole mother and all of them is
[51:52] drinking and going on it's environment
[51:55] right all right next
[51:58] one now but when he come down and made
[52:00] fellowship with Ahab then he got in
[52:02] trouble now Ahab and when you take the
[52:04] world is trying to find fellowship with
[52:06] you just remember there's a rabbit in
[52:08] the wood pile I read this one before but
[52:09] I'm going to read it again cuz there's
[52:10] another emphasis to this when you take a
[52:12] little cigarette smoking boy you want to
[52:14] take you out at night time young lady
[52:16] you Pentecostal girl that little Drinker
[52:17] his hair combed down slicking up the
[52:19] hold his mouth open let me tell you
[52:21] something now there's something in a
[52:22] making see there's something in a making
[52:24] I'll make you dear then I'll join your
[52:27] church he's lying to you
[52:30] folks if you loves you and loves the
[52:32] Lord he'll do it then yeah he don't have
[52:36] that's why I said don't use yourself as
[52:37] bait you're not bait brothers are sister
[52:41] invite them to church invite them
[52:43] witness to them but don't yoke yourself
[52:46] up with them everybody got that amen you
[52:50] sure okay now please don't do that
[52:54] number five you don't really like this
[52:56] one watch out for spoiled or selfish
[53:05] people I'm going to read you what the
[53:07] prophet said about it
[53:09] okay if you don't
[53:11] mind then we're going to get to the last
[53:13] one and this one is very serious I see
[53:15] too much of this flirting going on all
[53:18] right this one though is is watch out
[53:20] for spoiled or selfish people sometimes
[53:22] I wonder if we intellectual Americans
[53:25] has enough discernment to discern right
[53:26] from wrong yeah especially Juvenile
[53:29] Courts prove that we haven't got it to
[53:31] discern right and wrong for our
[53:34] children they seem to have a good psych
[53:37] psychologist answer for instance like
[53:39] this if jior comes up to popping Stomps
[53:42] his little feet and screams out and
[53:43] shakes his head and says Dad I don't
[53:45] care what you say I want a hot ride
[53:47] that's typical America and the father
[53:49] says all right Junior I'll buy it for
[53:51] you you could say to that Dad why did
[53:54] you do it oh I love him yeah you
[53:56] remember dad junior is going to grow up
[53:58] to be a man someday and he'll marry and
[54:00] have a family listen to what the Propet
[54:03] said God help that
[54:05] wife that lives with a boy that's been
[54:08] brought up like that to have his way
[54:11] about everything he wants right can't
[54:14] discern right from wrong y'all didn't
[54:16] know the prophet talked about all this
[54:17] did
[54:18] you can't discern right from wrong
[54:21] that's not love that's pure ignorance
[54:24] right amen it's Prophet saying this not
[54:27] me okay the Bible's right spare the rod
[54:31] and you spoil your son all right is that
[54:35] all of that
[54:38] one yeah I think that's all of that one
[54:40] no yeah you spoil your
[54:43] son same way with the girls
[54:46] flip-flopping same way with the girls
[54:48] all right same way with the girls we
[54:49] don't want no we don't want no people
[54:51] that are spoiled yeah if you'll pray
[54:56] you'll get all these things away from
[54:58] you but I listen to the last one this is
[55:00] the last one on the on the page here
[55:03] flirting brother Brown talks a lot about
[55:06] flirting the Bible talks about flirting
[55:08] yeah people flirting is
[55:12] wrong flirting is wrong amen you know
[55:15] what you're doing flirting means you're
[55:16] coming as close and you as you can to
[55:18] something without crossing the line
[55:20] right that's dangerous right cuz the
[55:23] closer you get to that's what I telling
[55:25] y'all if we know something's wrong and
[55:28] we try to live right on the edge of that
[55:31] yeah you know the man walked up to the
[55:33] devil one time and he was sitting on the
[55:35] fence God was on the other side he walks
[55:38] up the man walks up and start talking to
[55:40] the devil and and he tells the devil
[55:42] said or God was over here with with a
[55:44] man well the man walks over close to the
[55:46] devil and says hey why you sitting on
[55:48] the
[55:49] fence he'd been wishy-washy in a lot of
[55:51] things you know you talking about
[55:52] sitting on the fence cuz you don't know
[55:53] which way to go or the other Satan just
[55:55] looks at him and say well I own the
[55:59] fence I own the fence so stay away from
[56:03] the fence right stay away from
[56:06] the line you see where the line is don't
[56:09] get right up close to it that's right if
[56:11] you are flirting with the world you
[56:13] don't intend on crossing the line but
[56:14] you're trying to get as close as you can
[56:17] yeah and wanting to experience as much
[56:19] of it as you can without getting caught
[56:21] by it right flirting hurts both parties
[56:25] involved by giving fault hope think of a
[56:28] young man that you got a flirty little
[56:30] girl and and she flirts with this boy
[56:32] and she don't care no more about him and
[56:34] nothing but she wants to get something
[56:36] out of it that's what you do you get
[56:37] something it's your own emotion when you
[56:39] flirt you're getting something out of it
[56:41] yourself right right it's selfish go
[56:45] back to that selfish person you get
[56:46] false hope all right
[56:49] listen what brother R

[1:00:08] parable about the woman with the tablets
[1:00:10] yeah the the headdress with the tablets
[1:00:12] hanging on it all right very very pretty
[1:00:16] um analogy all right and he found her
[1:00:19] one of those coins out it showed she had
[1:00:21] been marked to harlot and if she had to
[1:00:24] if she had defied or defiled herself in
[1:00:25] any way and it was seen by the people
[1:00:28] they brought her before the priest and
[1:00:29] brought witness that she had found she
[1:00:32] had been found such and the priest
[1:00:34] saying that she was a married woman took
[1:00:35] the coin there was coins hanging on the
[1:00:37] head right here right coins H and one
[1:00:40] was for a different item right amen they
[1:00:42] would take that coin look right here
[1:00:46] because look there's one there's there's
[1:00:48] a couple there there's not just one
[1:00:50] there's several coins hanging on a on a
[1:00:52] string off of her headdress
[1:00:55] the priest saying she was a married
[1:00:56] woman took the coin out of her tablet
[1:00:58] that she had been doing wrong by and if
[1:01:01] she had marred her virtue they took that
[1:01:03] out in other words she would committed
[1:01:05] adultery they pull that one out so
[1:01:08] everybody could see and her husband
[1:01:09] could see when he come home but now look
[1:01:10] here if she had been
[1:01:13] flirting showing that she wasn't to to
[1:01:15] her husband they took that one out so
[1:01:18] there was one for flirting yeah they
[1:01:20] took that one out
[1:01:23] huh and whatever it was they took it out
[1:01:26] and when her husband returned he found
[1:01:28] that she had been marked and he would
[1:01:30] divorce her immediately and have nothing
[1:01:33] to do with such a woman he didn't want
[1:01:35] he did not want such a woman
[1:01:38] yeah Lord get La toward dark in other
[1:01:40] words she found you know her situation
[1:01:43] was different from this he just making
[1:01:44] an example the church better be
[1:01:47] examining themselves by the word of God
[1:01:49] our Purity our loyalty our devotion we
[1:01:53] become tlers
[1:01:55] tail bearers cigarette smokers
[1:01:57] backbiters painted up Jazz Bells
[1:01:59] everything in the calendar that the rest
[1:02:01] of the world does the Christian church
[1:02:03] is associating in those things today CU
[1:02:05] you can't hardly tell the one from the
[1:02:06] other it's time we took inventory it's
[1:02:10] getting late amen all right so
[1:02:13] flirting flirting is a lack of
[1:02:15] commitment or to trifle have you ever
[1:02:17] looked up the word Tri trifle means to
[1:02:19] make Trivial or insignificant in other
[1:02:22] words it doesn't matter trivial or

[1:02:42] that Samson had a power and she didn't
[1:02:45] know where that power laid she couldn't

[1:02:48] some great power that Samson possessed
[1:02:51] and she wanted to find it she didn't
[1:02:52] want to get close to Samson cuz she
[1:02:54] loved
[1:02:55] and as theila she kept wooing Samson
[1:02:58] after her beauty wooing means to flirt

[1:03:12] woo Samson to her number 21 Samson a to
[1:03:18] have made his first stop when deila

[1:03:23] turned his head and walked on right
[1:03:27] Samson stopped and got in trouble Eve

[1:03:53] love with another man and has has an
[1:03:54] affairs with him and comes back to her
[1:03:55] husband he should kick her out is that
[1:03:57] right she must be true to him cuz she is
[1:04:00] vowed to him and the bride of Christ is
[1:04:01] vowed to Christ and he is the word not
[1:04:04] even wink at the other side amen a woman
[1:04:07] should not even wink at another man
[1:04:09] right amen she shouldn't make no signs

[1:04:35] that way you listen only to One Voice
[1:04:37] amen my sheep know my voice a stranger
[1:04:40] they not what is his voice any man's
[1:04:42] voice is his word and this is it the
[1:04:45] Bible not one word added to it or taken
[1:04:47] from it you stay with that voice all
[1:04:48] right next one number 23 that's the
[1:04:51] reason many times today that a sinner is
[1:04:53] still want wondering about a beautiful
[1:04:56] young girl will cut off the locks of her
[1:04:57] hair to be popular paint up her face to
[1:05:00] make her look pretty put on clothes to
[1:05:03] show the form of her being
[1:05:05] right watch that
[1:05:08] now watch that here in this church yeah
[1:05:11] you put on Godly clothes looking but if
[1:05:13] it cleansed everything you got right
[1:05:16] what's brother Brown trying to say what
[1:05:18] am I trying to
[1:05:19] say if if it's if it's too close to the
[1:05:22] line it's wrong right you're safe it's
[1:05:25] too close to the line it's wrong that's
[1:05:26] all you got to say but don't close your
[1:05:28] form of being cuz it's the only thing
[1:05:30] that she can find finding somewhere to
[1:05:32] try to find something to come back to
[1:05:34] her when she can cause men to whistle at
[1:05:37] her wave at her flirt with her young men
[1:05:39] will do the same thing to a woman try to
[1:05:41] make your attractive to her neighbors
[1:05:43] will build a house and fix a certain way
[1:05:44] cuz it look a little better than the
[1:05:46] neighbor's placees all the time we are
[1:05:48] seeking for something and something
[1:05:49] keeps going just a little above it all
[1:05:53] right number 24 now it's not wrong
[1:05:56] listen it's not wrong to dress up and be
[1:05:58] nice right you need to dress up if you
[1:06:01] go on a date you need to dress up like
[1:06:02] brother Bown said you don't need to stop
[1:06:03] your car in the driveway and blow the
[1:06:05] horn he said you go get that girl if
[1:06:08] you're going to date her you go get her
[1:06:10] all right right amen you you cannot have
[1:06:14] an eternal Foundation upon popularity
[1:06:17] right that's the great sin of America is
[1:06:20] trying to be popular women trying to
[1:06:23] dress popular men trying to act popular
[1:06:26] all these little things going on the way
[1:06:28] it's taking place I don't have to start
[1:06:30] on that the first night but I didn't say
[1:06:32] the third night of the second we'll
[1:06:34] Coast on that tonight but being popular
[1:06:38] popularity usually leads to sin and
[1:06:42] disgrace certainly it does three or four
[1:06:46] marriages and all kinds of stuff and it
[1:06:49] has no
[1:06:50] Eternal Foundation right FL flirting
[1:06:55] flirting is wrong amen
[1:07:01] Proverbs we stopped at the eyelids but
[1:07:04] listen we're going to go on down to the
[1:07:06] to the end of it remember what we
[1:07:08] talking about getting close but not but
[1:07:10] not getting over the line but getting
[1:07:11] close but watch this all right listen
[1:07:13] for the Commandment is a lamp and the
[1:07:15] law is light and reproofs of instruction
[1:07:17] are the way of life to keep thee from
[1:07:19] the evil woman from the flattery of the
[1:07:21] tongue of a strange woman lust not after
[1:07:23] her Beauty in thine heart neither let
[1:07:25] her take thee with her eyelids now we
[1:07:27] stopped there but listen to 26
[1:07:30] 2728 for by means of a horse woman a man
[1:07:33] is brought to a piece of bread yeah and
[1:07:36] the adulteress will hunt for the
[1:07:38] precious life yeah can a man take fire
[1:07:41] in his bosom what get close to the fire
