[8:40] very familiar
[8:43] this directly has been read 40 it's
[8:45] makes 50 times because
[8:47] 50 messages
[8:49] but how many more times we need to read
[8:51] it where we can really get it
[8:53] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[8:55] gave unto him to show into his servants
[8:57] things which must shortly
[8:59] come to pass and then sinned and
[9:00] signified by his angel
[9:02] unto his servant john and by record of
[9:05] the word of god and of the testimony of
[9:06] jesus christ and of all things that he
[9:08] saw
[9:09] blessed is he that readeth and say that
[9:11] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[9:14] those things which are written therein
[9:16] for the time is at hand
[9:19] time to what
[9:21] time to understand
[9:24] time to understand now revelation 6
[9:28] verse 12 through 17
[9:32] now beheld when he had opened the sixth
[9:34] seal and lo there was a great earthquake
[9:36] and the sun became black as sackcloth of
[9:39] hair and the moon became his blood
[9:41] and the stars of heaven fell into the
[9:43] earth even as a fig tree casted her
[9:45] untimely figs when she was shaken to the
[9:47] mighty wind
[9:48] and the heaven departed as a scroll when
[9:50] his role together and every mountain and
[9:53] island were moved out of their places
[9:56] and the kings of the earth and the great
[9:58] men and the rich men and the chief
[10:00] captains and the mighty men and everett
[10:02] bondman and every freeman hid themselves
[10:04] in the dens and in the rocks of the
[10:06] mountain
[10:07] and said to the mountains
[10:10] and rocks fall upon us and hide us from
[10:12] the face of him that sit up upon the
[10:13] drone
[10:14] and from the wrath of the lamb for the
[10:17] great day of his wrath has come and who
[10:20] shall be able to stand you may be seated
[10:23] before that is
[10:24] blessing to the
[10:26] reading of the word
[10:28] and we were trying to cover their
[10:31] um
[10:32] sunday
[10:34] the
[10:35] point of and also uh
[10:37] brother jackson what's his name jason
[10:40] jason jackson
[10:42] will be here for preaching for us the
[10:44] weekend of the
[10:46] new year's time which will be
[10:48] on sunday and then monday will be
[10:51] our what's not service
[10:53] and he will be speaking for us looking
[10:55] forward to hearing him never met him
[10:57] never hurt him but looking forward to
[10:59] that this guy
[11:01] is jackson
[11:02] so remember that
[11:04] all right now
[11:07] as i said we we
[11:12] most everybody even brother brown am i
[11:13] looking today
[11:15] what he said about the uh
[11:17] sixth seal the tribulation
[11:19] see he knew that this scripture is used
[11:22] here
[11:24] as the tribulation
[11:26] and is using it as the tribulation then
[11:29] uh you know back in his early ministry
[11:31] he believed in a tribulation coming and
[11:33] the basics of religion
[11:36] um you know understanding they they
[11:38] believe that there will be a tribulation
[11:39] period
[11:40] but there was a lot of um
[11:42] misunderstandings as to
[11:45] uh you know
[11:47] what it's all about and what it's doing
[11:50] and you know we're not trying to
[11:51] straighten out none of that but just
[11:53] trying to
[11:54] uh understand
[11:56] the doings of the bible and followed it
[11:59] through
[12:00] but the main thing that we
[12:02] were trying to get across this past
[12:04] weekend was what
[12:07] this sixth seal is the tribulation
[12:09] period right
[12:11] and we don't have to go through that
[12:13] tribulation
[12:15] as the bride of jesus christ we're taken
[12:18] out of here
[12:19] in a rapture
[12:21] before that time comes and that's a
[12:24] great thing you say well you know why we
[12:26] have to understand this out of the other
[12:29] this is a good way to understand
[12:32] is to know and realize that we don't
[12:33] have to go through these times
[12:35] we don't have to face the times that's
[12:37] coming up on the earth it's getting bad
[12:40] enough like it is
[12:42] but this is just a pre-tribulation an
[12:45] amateur tribulation
[12:47] because
[12:49] really
[12:50] now when you're thinking about the
[12:53] tribulation period
[12:55] it is the wrath of god poured out now
[12:58] that's the point i want you to see
[12:59] tonight and we'll get down to it in a
[13:01] minute that it then it is the judgment
[13:03] seal
[13:05] you know
[13:07] but then he'll say that it's a judgment
[13:09] seal of the word
[13:11] well
[13:12] see in the tribulation what will make it
[13:15] so horrible
[13:18] is it will be the wrath of god poured
[13:20] out
[13:22] now look at the minor or amateur
[13:24] tribulation or pre-tribulation
[13:28] of all of the jews that have been killed
[13:30] down through there that we talked about
[13:32] all of the things of life that's going
[13:34] on were 200 000 people just
[13:38] washed off and killed
[13:41] and those are just amateur
[13:44] tribulation
[13:46] and it's that is caused by and brought
[13:49] on by satan and his doings
[13:54] but the tribulation period
[13:56] is when the wrath of god is poured out
[13:59] right
[14:01] that means there's no mercy no grace
[14:05] see once he
[14:07] once it ends up with you and i
[14:11] then his wrath can be poured out
[14:14] upon the earth
[14:17] and as we'll get to it in a minute 144
[14:19] thousand is put in there the foolish
[14:20] virgin the world is purged
[14:23] a lot of things is to happen under this
[14:25] seal but the main thing i want you to
[14:27] see
[14:29] is that
[14:31] the tribulation period will be the wrath
[14:33] of god
[14:35] poured out there won't be any mercy
[14:38] that's right
[14:40] you could think about those 200 000 over
[14:42] there that uh greater uh
[14:44] tidal wave and things but you know there
[14:46] was still mercy that a lot of people
[14:48] didn't die
[14:50] right you know
[14:53] you can always find something like that
[14:54] but what about a time when you actually
[14:57] cry for the
[14:58] rocks and the mountains to fall on you
[15:03] no wonder
[15:04] the world will be so upset as we're
[15:06] covering sunday
[15:08] that
[15:11] when those two witnesses are finally
[15:13] killed
[15:15] that they send presents to each other
[15:18] to celebrate
[15:20] right
[15:22] because
[15:24] see every time they turn around they're
[15:26] just calling down the plagues of god
[15:29] what about it not raining for three and
[15:31] a half years
[15:35] i mean we had a three months drought
[15:36] with no water we
[15:38] we consider it to be a very horrible
[15:40] time
[15:42] but what about three and a half years
[15:43] with no rain
[15:48] that's a that's a horrible situation to
[15:50] even think about
[15:54] see that's the wrath of god
[15:57] now we're going to talk about it in a
[15:58] minute being a judgment seal
[16:02] then
[16:03] remember
[16:05] we are the ones who cause
[16:08] this to take place
[16:12] the people of the world is what's going
[16:14] to bring down the wrath of god you agree
[16:16] amen
[16:19] see because of the way
[16:22] we've lived we've done
[16:24] what we've done with the earth the bible
[16:26] says he'll destroy those who destroy the
[16:28] earth amen
[16:31] and yet we just run along doing it
[16:35] you know
[16:37] you know
[16:38] i've always
[16:40] thought about it i hate to roll down a
[16:42] window to see anybody throw anything out
[16:47] when i was out there fishing in the
[16:49] ocean after you pass a 12-mile limit i
[16:51] think it is you can just throw
[16:53] everything overboard
[16:56] all christ goes overboard man we just
[16:58] throwing stuff out i took my part and
[17:00] set it oversight i'll start taking it
[17:01] back
[17:03] right
[17:04] i'll take it back
[17:06] it may be bad to bring back put it in
[17:07] the trash but
[17:09] at least i'm not just throwing the
[17:11] garbage out
[17:13] but you just think about all those ships
[17:15] and all those things out there that just
[17:17] pumping all their waste
[17:19] out into the ocean
[17:21] no wonder everything dies and
[17:23] this is a
[17:24] pre-tribulation
[17:26] yeah
[17:28] this is not the wrath of god amen
[17:32] that's what everybody thinks so they're
[17:33] saying oh look that town was so sinful
[17:38] that's a wrap of god being poured out
[17:42] well
[17:44] it couldn't be
[17:47] but it don't have to be either
[17:50] you know
[17:51] let's turn around look at the rest of us
[17:53] and see what it is that's right all
[17:54] right but think about it now
[17:57] the tribulation period will be the wrath
[18:00] of god poured out upon man
[18:03] because of the rejection and the things
[18:05] and what we do
[18:08] and there'll be no mercy
[18:12] sure there will be salvation for the 144
[18:15] 000
[18:17] to receive salvation during the
[18:19] tribulation period and we'll get to that
[18:21] in a minute and that's jacob's trouble
[18:26] but see then after that they're still
[18:28] there
[18:29] even though they receive salvation
[18:33] even though they you know they are the
[18:35] people of god amen
[18:37] but even with that they're going to be
[18:39] left there right
[18:41] for the wrath to be poured out upon
[18:45] their own things that have been called
[18:47] down by the the two witnesses
[18:51] to set it up
[18:52] is going to fall on them also
[18:56] because of the rejecting
[19:01] well now as i was trying to bring out
[19:02] the other day about if the root be
[19:04] holding the things and we
[19:06] we must you know depend upon the roots
[19:08] which is jewish
[19:10] and if
[19:12] if all of that has to go through that
[19:13] look what god does to you and i
[19:18] he doesn't put his bride through a
[19:20] tribulation
[19:26] his wrath can't be poured out
[19:28] upon the bride
[19:30] that's right
[19:31] because she's so much of him until
[19:34] it would not be correct
[19:36] would you think about it
[19:38] even though that 144 000 will receive
[19:41] god
[19:42] receive eternal life into their soul
[19:47] they won't be the bride of jesus christ
[19:51] because they rejected that right
[19:54] but they will be the people of god you
[19:56] know but they'll be put right in the
[19:58] tribulation
[20:01] to purge
[20:04] them for the rejecting
[20:07] you say well if they get eternal i want
[20:09] to be purged for
[20:10] because
[20:13] that's the thing i want you to see
[20:19] see church you and i accepted jesus
[20:22] christ as our savior right amen
[20:24] by accepting him as our savior he comes
[20:27] and lives in us
[20:32] see we have
[20:33] accepted
[20:34] this way
[20:36] we've said it's mary being unto me
[20:39] according to thy word
[20:41] you realize what she was saying
[20:43] right
[20:44] she was going to repair before the world
[20:46] as a pregnant young girl that had no
[20:49] husband
[20:52] right
[20:54] that's right
[20:55] but the world wasn't gonna be happy
[20:57] because she was gonna have a baby
[21:00] they wanted to kill her
[21:03] joseph had to cover her
[21:06] with a protective form of a husband to
[21:08] keep her from being killed
[21:14] but she was willing
[21:17] to take all of that ridicule in that
[21:19] part
[21:21] for her savior
[21:24] what little bit of problems we go
[21:26] through
[21:27] what little ridiculing we have
[21:31] ah baby stuff
[21:34] you know childish to even think about it
[21:39] oh everybody's against me
[21:42] no
[21:45] you got the problem with your in your
[21:47] own self if that's what you think
[21:50] amen that's right
[21:51] yes
[21:52] i'm being persecuted for being a
[21:54] christian
[21:56] maybe you're not acting like a christian
[21:59] as a reason you're being persecuted
[22:02] that's right you know what
[22:04] maybe they're not looking at you as a
[22:06] christian
[22:07] man
[22:09] they might be trying to show you you're
[22:11] not one
[22:14] brother there we need to preach on the
[22:16] seals
[22:18] okay
[22:21] you're supposed to be on those signs
[22:23] okay
[22:24] well i i thought that's part of it
[22:26] but now listen
[22:28] do you see what i'm talking about the
[22:29] tribulation period when it comes
[22:32] not the amateur tribulation not the
[22:34] things that are taking place now
[22:37] not even the days is getting worse and
[22:39] worse and worse upon the earth
[22:42] but when this bride leaves out of here
[22:48] even though that 144 thousand i want you
[22:50] to get the point even though they will
[22:52] get eternal life
[22:55] but they will not be the bride of jesus
[22:57] christ right right
[23:00] they rejected that right
[23:03] the foolish virgin that will go to the
[23:05] white throne
[23:07] have to stand a judgment
[23:12] and they'll receive eternal life
[23:16] if they're true you know
[23:20] not all of them but some will
[23:23] but they'll never be the bride
[23:26] what an opportunity it is
[23:28] for you and i
[23:30] to think about
[23:33] what god has done for us
[23:37] and then how silly we are
[23:41] you know
[23:43] to be griping and complaining
[23:46] no
[23:50] we ought to be put in the tribulation
[23:53] dishonest
[23:55] we deserve it
[23:58] you think you don't
[24:01] no we deserve it
[24:04] what you don't want
[24:06] he went to hell and i don't have to go
[24:11] he took my judgment
[24:16] upon himself that's right that i don't
[24:19] have to be judged
[24:25] he paid the price that's right
[24:29] who can argue with him about it
[24:33] you ever think about that really
[24:36] the bible says how can a thing form say
[24:38] that then it formed it once you form in
[24:40] this way
[24:44] i mean if even if he did make you
[24:46] literally a lost sinner we know he
[24:48] doesn't
[24:49] but if he did what right would you have
[24:51] or what court of appeal could you apply
[24:53] to
[24:57] because you don't mind
[25:01] you see the wrath of god then will be
[25:03] poured out
[25:05] and even that 144 000 those two prophets
[25:10] they will be under the wrath
[25:14] that they even call down themselves
[25:18] amen
[25:22] oh no no no brother tale they're they're
[25:24] going to be set aside then you're not
[25:26] getting what brother adam and you won't
[25:27] get what he's saying about what i'll try
[25:29] to bring tonight
[25:33] he's saying even though they are the
[25:35] children of god
[25:38] for that period of time they're going to
[25:40] be put in there for the rejecting of
[25:41] jesus christ
[25:44] amen
[25:49] that's what you would call
[25:52] what
[25:54] no you there'd be no name for it you
[25:56] couldn't call it
[25:57] grace
[25:59] with pardoning to it
[26:01] uh
[26:02] what would you call it that he would
[26:04] actually he's going to put them that
[26:05] we're going to re he's going to put them
[26:07] right in there
[26:12] and purge them
[26:15] when he's already given eternal life
[26:19] right
[26:20] you see the only one that bypasses all
[26:23] tribulation
[26:25] is the bride of christ
[26:29] what a wonderful god
[26:31] what a wonderful savior
[26:33] amen
[26:34] now
[26:37] we know this tribulation
[26:40] there's questionable arguments among the
[26:42] people of the message even now
[26:45] and we have never
[26:46] here even tried to
[26:48] in any way teach a seven-year
[26:50] tribulation period
[26:53] the prophet didn't teach it
[26:56] we don't teach it
[26:57] the denominational system of the world
[27:00] uh their doctrine is that there's going
[27:02] to be seven years tribulation there'll
[27:04] be three and a half years they call it
[27:06] minor tribulation
[27:07] and they say the bride church group you
[27:10] know the true christians will be here
[27:12] during that three and a half years of
[27:15] minor tribulation
[27:18] but then there'll be a vast major
[27:20] tribulation for three and a half years
[27:21] that the church will be gone you know
[27:24] and all of that
[27:26] but yet
[27:28] we know that those things are not right
[27:30] that's right
[27:31] even the drawings of the prophet
[27:34] that we have in the daniel 70 weeks
[27:38] don't confuse that to think that he's
[27:40] teaching seven years tribulation
[27:44] because it's not what he's doing
[27:48] he's teaching three and a half years of
[27:50] tribulation
[27:51] according to jacob's trouble
[27:58] but then they'll go into a purging
[28:01] of even the world right
[28:04] under that last part
[28:06] of the daniel 70 weeks
[28:09] that's what people can't understand they
[28:11] say well well you y'all have been so
[28:14] um adam and i guess is the word to try
[28:17] to prove with this to get a seven years
[28:21] and then here you turn around and say
[28:24] it's not like you think i'm saying you
[28:26] know
[28:27] and it's not
[28:28] that's there's only three and a half
[28:30] years of tribulation
[28:33] because that's the wrath of god poured
[28:35] out with israel existing here
[28:42] then it goes into a chaos
[28:49] because now what's the point of getting
[28:51] that
[28:51] that even though they are placed under
[28:55] i was thinking about this today trying
[28:58] to explain it
[28:59] even that 144 000 they're placed under
[29:02] the wrath of god
[29:07] but they're not crying for rocks and
[29:09] things to fall on them
[29:13] right
[29:14] they're crying for god to unveil himself
[29:20] believing in that even though it's
[29:22] called jacob's trouble
[29:25] and even though it's called the
[29:26] tribulation
[29:28] or the wrath of god poured out there
[29:30] will be a group of people there that
[29:31] will be under
[29:33] some form of mercy
[29:35] to keep them being destroyed amen
[29:38] all right
[29:41] they're just put there because of the
[29:43] rejecting because there's no no where to
[29:45] put them
[29:47] you can't put them in the bride the
[29:49] bride's done gone
[29:51] that's the point that i'm trying to
[29:52] emphasize to you
[29:54] if people would just study the bible
[29:56] from that
[29:58] but the bride goes up revelation 4
[30:02] and it's not seen until revelation 19
[30:05] on earth
[30:08] she's seen in heaven in chapter 5 and
[30:10] the thing
[30:12] but not on earth
[30:15] why because
[30:19] see really when all of those seals begin
[30:21] to break
[30:23] they're going to break to israel
[30:25] not like that we maybe try to understand
[30:28] it one two three four five see
[30:32] it's just going to open as a tribulation
[30:34] period
[30:37] they'll sing the white horse rider the
[30:39] red horse rider the black horse rider
[30:41] they'll see all of those signs yep
[30:43] but it'll really be the tribulation
[30:45] period
[30:47] jacob's trouble
[30:53] jacob's trouble is
[30:58] many things let me let me hold that on
[31:01] but we'll try to discover
[31:03] all right go ahead let's start on this
[31:05] because
[31:06] that's what we want to talk about this
[31:07] tribulation period
[31:09] now i'm talking about the three and a
[31:11] half years after the rapture
[31:14] not talking about the seven years
[31:16] of the purging because it just goes on
[31:18] over into a raining out of
[31:22] the wrath of god until the world and
[31:24] everything is purged
[31:28] but it's the three and a half years
[31:30] after the rapture of the ministry of
[31:32] jesus christ to come back to israel
[31:37] but it will come back to them in a
[31:38] tribulation period
[31:42] but it's called jacob's troubles let's
[31:44] read them
[31:47] brother number one
[31:49] jeremiah 30 and 7.
[31:54] so the last for that great that day is
[31:57] great
[31:58] so that none is like it it's even the
[32:00] time of jacob's trouble
[32:04] but he shall be saved
[32:07] out of it
[32:09] all right
[32:11] it's jacob's trouble
[32:14] but he said he shall be saved out of it
[32:19] see out of the tribulation period of the
[32:21] three and a half years after the rapture
[32:23] there i keep emphasizing that where
[32:24] nobody won't misunderstand me
[32:28] it will be called jacob's trouble
[32:30] it's the three or five years for the two
[32:33] witnesses
[32:35] but jacob's gonna be saying nothing
[32:38] you know what's gonna happen to jacob in
[32:40] that three and a half years
[32:43] his name is going to be changed to
[32:44] israel
[32:47] right
[32:48] because he's got a redemptive plan
[32:53] that he can
[32:55] receive eternal life
[32:57] but because of his
[32:59] rejecting back dire
[33:03] he's going to have to be brought in in a
[33:05] horrible type of situation
[33:09] but it's jacob's troubles
[33:15] but he'll be saved out of it
[33:18] that 144 000 is going to be saved out of
[33:20] it
[33:21] they're going to be brought out of that
[33:22] in jacob's trouble
[33:24] all right
[33:26] and look what it'll turn out to be
[33:29] let's just read it a little bit about
[33:31] this
[33:33] and let you just think about what he's
[33:35] saying go ahead to number two
[33:38] which is the revelation of jesus christ
[33:41] 1960 1204 des moines service
[33:45] prairie 399.
[33:47] he's talking about this tribulation that
[33:49] doing
[33:52] his family was out and gone
[33:54] so the rapture will come before the
[33:56] tribulation sets in
[33:59] the tribulation many people get them
[34:00] mixed up we'll get it straightened this
[34:03] week the lord willing by the help of the
[34:05] lord
[34:06] remember you're looking for a great
[34:08] tribulation period
[34:10] that was
[34:11] if you'll type that in the bible
[34:14] that was jacob's troubled age
[34:18] you see when he was troubled
[34:21] that had nothing to do with the gentiles
[34:24] the gentile has nothing to do with it
[34:26] no time in the bible to that the gentile
[34:28] church is raptured all right
[34:32] jacob's trouble
[34:38] now let's talk about it a minute and
[34:40] then read it
[34:43] see jacob's trouble is
[34:49] when jacob left
[34:52] i want you to think
[34:55] i try to preach and just take things and
[34:57] get you to think a little bit
[34:58] spiritually
[35:00] remember israel is in the tribulation
[35:03] because of their rejecting of the
[35:04] messiah right
[35:07] jacob's trouble begins
[35:09] when he leaves egypt i mean these are
[35:14] israel
[35:15] as we call it today
[35:19] and he goes down where he is
[35:23] meets up with his wife and
[35:25] you know he gets married and all that
[35:27] whole story
[35:30] see it's not just over there when he was
[35:31] wrestling with the lord that's in there
[35:35] we're going to read all of it
[35:38] but jacob's trouble starts when he left
[35:40] the promised land
[35:44] right that's what i call jacob's trouble
[35:51] now
[35:52] when he left that land
[35:53] to go he went down and
[35:56] jury found her wife and all the things
[35:58] went through it those things happened
[36:02] he's out there fighting it out what's
[36:03] his name layman or what his name was
[36:06] his dad-in-law
[36:08] tricks him
[36:09] deceives him and
[36:11] makes him work all those times and
[36:13] everything
[36:14] you know
[36:16] gives him the wrong life and
[36:18] then he has to work and everything else
[36:20] see all of that is jacob's trouble
[36:24] because that's where his trouble become
[36:28] that's right
[36:29] when he left the promised land
[36:35] to take a journey and that's where mine
[36:37] and your troubles at right
[36:39] we leave the promised land of this
[36:41] message
[36:42] that's right
[36:43] we're promised the truth
[36:46] but if we go out of the land we're not
[36:48] promised anything
[36:50] would run around say about a jew outside
[36:52] of jerusalem
[36:54] you see his backslid
[37:00] where judah just leaves jerusalem
[37:04] he's backslidden
[37:07] he's out of the will of god
[37:13] you see he gets all of the troubles and
[37:15] all those things happen
[37:16] ensure on this journey back
[37:20] he's trying to appease oh
[37:23] esau
[37:27] he's trying to give him all of his
[37:28] families and puts them all ahead of him
[37:31] my brother claude was talking about him
[37:35] he put leah and them out you know he put
[37:38] the bond people first
[37:40] you know his concubine women wives
[37:44] and then he sent leah to him and then
[37:47] i asked he said rachel
[37:50] you know
[37:52] then he was left alone
[37:55] and then he met the angel of the lord
[37:59] and he wrestled it out with him
[38:03] i never have to believe that to be a
[38:05] physical contact i don't know what you
[38:06] believe
[38:08] i mean i don't think he held on to him
[38:10] and wrestled with him that's right
[38:12] i think when he'd start to get up cause
[38:14] he wasn't gonna get up and leave anyway
[38:17] come on get the whole story get it
[38:18] truthfully
[38:19] the angel of the lord wasn't gonna leave
[38:21] until he blessed him
[38:23] right we didn't get up start to leave
[38:25] you know jacob just come on now just let
[38:27] that down let's talk a little while you
[38:29] know let's let's drink some more coffee
[38:31] and you know
[38:32] and we got some sweets here and we'll
[38:34] eat them
[38:36] they talk a while and
[38:38] that angel makes out like he's gonna
[38:39] leave again because
[38:41] he wasn't gonna leave
[38:45] he didn't come there to leave without
[38:47] blessing me
[38:51] that was his job
[38:54] because it wasn't a wrassling like a
[38:56] that kind it was more of a stay here you
[39:01] know don't believe
[39:05] trying to hold on to it that way not not
[39:07] getting cold you ain't leaving you ain't
[39:10] leaving
[39:11] so that's what we get all that in our
[39:12] mind we like to make pictures
[39:20] you haven't ever
[39:24] been in a bad shape
[39:28] i had to wrestle it out with the lord
[39:33] for a day or two
[39:36] sometime for a week or two
[39:39] there's some time for a month
[39:42] that you're trying to get the lord to
[39:46] heal you
[39:48] deliver you save you
[39:54] then what the physical battle was it
[39:57] i mean was you wrestling with the lord
[40:00] we're reading a little bit brother
[40:01] around and said those two witnesses
[40:04] wrestle it out
[40:05] until they get 144 000.
[40:09] out of the children of israel
[40:12] well you know what they're doing they're
[40:14] preaching the gospel right
[40:16] you've never been that way
[40:19] you've never been to the point that it
[40:21] just seemed like that god was totally
[40:23] away from you
[40:29] and you were crying out
[40:31] searching after him and repenting and
[40:35] trying to straighten up and do what was
[40:37] right
[40:40] but see he wasn't going to leave you
[40:41] anyway
[40:44] but we didn't know that
[40:46] right
[40:49] you certainly don't want to get right
[40:50] about the middle of it so okay lord i
[40:53] know you got me in this so just take
[40:55] care of it i'll see you later i'm going
[40:57] on vacation
[41:00] you call that stupidity brother they'll
[41:02] i call it human entity
[41:05] that is fun stupidity
[41:07] because you don't ever dare get to the
[41:09] place you think you can
[41:13] let god do what you want him to do
[41:18] you better always be willing
[41:21] to take whatever he gives you
[41:26] you remember brother brown said
[41:28] you never asked god for anything
[41:32] you didn't get
[41:35] now i used to think man when i first
[41:36] heard that
[41:38] i thought lord i shall ask you for a lot
[41:40] of things i didn't get
[41:42] i kept on listening you know what he
[41:44] said one day
[41:47] he said i've never asked god for
[41:48] anything
[41:50] that he didn't get me
[41:53] or tell me
[41:56] he wasn't going to give it to me
[41:59] then he says no from god
[42:05] it's a perfect answer right
[42:09] what if obama would have took it when
[42:11] god said don't go
[42:18] but you see he begged and pleaded and
[42:20] everything in the world goes no
[42:25] but his first was his perfect will
[42:27] second was his permission
[42:31] i'm honest folks i don't know where
[42:33] you're going to take this to be correct
[42:35] or not but i do
[42:38] we live most of our life in a permissive
[42:40] form
[42:42] trying to work out something with god in
[42:44] our lives
[42:47] when we should be repenting and just
[42:49] settle down and quit
[42:55] but you see church
[42:59] jacob's trouble
[43:06] was a whole lot of things
[43:09] all the way through that he was dealing
[43:11] with him
[43:14] he was in trouble
[43:16] because he was out of the promised land
[43:21] even though god was down there with him
[43:23] with
[43:24] blaming them and blessing and yes
[43:29] but he wanted to go home
[43:34] and he knew what it would cost him
[43:38] to go home
[43:42] he knew that at first it would cost him
[43:44] everything he had
[43:48] that's why he was willing finally to
[43:49] give it all
[43:52] families children money cattle
[43:54] everything he had
[43:57] centered ahead of him
[44:00] but then he had one thing in his mind
[44:04] he saw he's gonna kill me
[44:15] he said he saw he'll kill me
[44:18] well then he had to go back home he had
[44:20] to get with him wasn't that something
[44:22] right
[44:24] yeah
[44:25] if you and i could ever get this thing
[44:27] down right we ain't going to be worried
[44:28] about
[44:29] what people think about us and troubles
[44:33] we're going to count them as glory
[44:34] stones or something to stand on and
[44:36] shout hallelujah
[44:38] of all the problems that we so believe
[44:41] about
[44:43] you know
[44:47] okay
[44:51] but listen
[44:55] it's symbolized go ahead to number three
[44:59] six seal paragraph 244 i would invite
[45:02] you to go to the sixth seal and listen
[45:03] to the whole seal
[45:05] uh yesterday was down in the woods
[45:07] hunting and
[45:09] yesterday tuesday i guess today's
[45:11] wednesday
[45:12] but i had an opportunity to listen to
[45:14] the sixth seal and
[45:16] it was really a great time to just sit
[45:17] down there and listen
[45:21] but look what brought around says on the
[45:23] sixth seal
[45:24] vergara 244
[45:26] now notice again now also
[45:29] when these jews
[45:31] i'll give you
[45:32] another little symbol so you can realize
[45:34] that it's used over here
[45:37] now on this side of the rapture and he's
[45:40] proving who this is right
[45:43] watch what takes place is absolutely
[45:45] symbolized
[45:46] we won't take time to do it now but it's
[45:48] symbolizing what was called
[45:50] jacob's
[45:51] trouble
[45:53] all right
[45:55] he goes on down to explain
[45:58] what i was just talking about
[46:01] sure he was a little rascal
[46:06] he had his eyes on the birthright but he
[46:08] stole it
[46:11] he was a deceiver
[46:18] when he goes down
[46:20] to his father-in-law he puts those
[46:22] speckled sticks between them
[46:25] keeps still
[46:26] jacob
[46:28] that's right
[46:30] tripper upper
[46:32] deceiver
[46:35] all right
[46:38] he's got to go see the reason there's
[46:40] got to be israel turned down jesus
[46:43] christ
[46:45] so there's got to be a purging of that
[46:47] sin
[46:51] you say well he just goes to him
[46:53] they've got to be a purging and they're
[46:55] right there in it
[46:58] jurors i've tried to explain
[47:00] they're going to
[47:03] have the grace of god
[47:07] but i don't believe that they're going
[47:09] to be totally free
[47:10] from all the plagues and things
[47:13] because if they are
[47:15] what's the reason of putting them there
[47:17] right i thought the reason of putting
[47:19] them there was to purge them
[47:26] well i thought purging
[47:31] what meant trouble
[47:35] oh but brother dale can't you just see
[47:37] people preaching oh man and everybody
[47:39] just shout glory ain't that wonderful
[47:41] they just preached with them 144th house
[47:44] they're going to be in goshen and ain't
[47:46] going to be nothing happening
[47:49] they're just going to be there
[47:51] and all the whole world around us
[47:52] falling apart
[47:54] i'm sorry i can't preach that way
[47:57] but it don't fit the word
[48:02] they're there for a purging
[48:07] and they're going to be purged
[48:09] right that's right
[48:11] they're going to be in the time of when
[48:13] there's no water
[48:16] they're going to be in a time when
[48:17] things are happening and even the two
[48:19] prophets are calling down
[48:25] they ain't going to be set aside
[48:30] if you believe that i'm sorry i don't
[48:34] what would you put them in the
[48:34] tribulation form
[48:38] sure they have eternal life in their
[48:40] soul
[48:41] surely accept jesus christ
[48:43] but they won't be right that's right
[48:47] now why not to be eunuchs the prophet
[48:49] said
[48:50] servants to the bride in the millennial
[48:52] right right
[48:55] but to go to that millennial reign
[48:57] means they're going to be purged
[49:08] but remember now as i said jacob
[49:11] he's a shyster
[49:14] he's a deceiver
[49:18] it took jacob
[49:19] a long time
[49:23] to be brought to a place
[49:25] that god could call his name israel
[49:30] a lot of trouble
[49:34] sure we love to just go to light to the
[49:36] next one and wanna do but
[49:41] let's read it
[49:42] go to number four
[49:44] i got 264 with the sixth seal
[49:49] now notice
[49:51] the esau didn't need his money
[49:54] right where he had everything
[49:57] he didn't want it when he got over there
[50:02] neither does rome need money they got
[50:04] the wealth of the world we find out that
[50:06] israel in that time of trouble
[50:10] when he was jacob he wrestled with the
[50:12] got a hold of something that was real
[50:15] and they're going to do that the
[50:16] tribulation
[50:18] there was a man come down jacob got his
[50:21] arms around him
[50:23] and he stayed there
[50:24] and the father said i'm going to go now
[50:27] i must be going now
[50:29] it's coming daylight oh that breaking of
[50:31] the night so it's fixing to come but
[50:33] jacob said i'm not going to leave you
[50:38] you stayed right with him
[50:43] those two witnesses moses and elijah
[50:47] they'll wrestle with god until 144 000
[50:51] of the tribes of israel are called now
[50:53] that's just before the tribulation
[50:55] period
[50:57] now i see you getting into it
[50:59] well you say women just before
[51:03] remember tribulation sits in over here
[51:08] and works its way to israel
[51:10] while they're getting the message
[51:14] then it begins to strike there don't you
[51:16] think it's going to be affecting them
[51:21] so don't get tired of it and try to move
[51:23] it over and just leave it like it is and
[51:25] just take that
[51:27] 144 000 call them out with the two
[51:29] witnesses in the three and a half years
[51:31] after the rapture of it
[51:33] right across
[51:35] overlaps come in we know that
[51:38] but then there'll be a great tribulation
[51:42] of a purging of all things
[51:46] but remember the 144 000 and the two
[51:49] witnesses are killed
[51:52] the purging then will be going into
[51:54] other things all right
[51:57] jacob's trouble
[52:02] he's going to take them two witnesses
[52:04] three and a half years
[52:06] hey
[52:07] my brother they'll always talk the bible
[52:09] saying
[52:11] israel will be saved in a day
[52:14] it looks like today we go out of here
[52:16] they're saved
[52:18] next three and a half years preach it to
[52:20] them
[52:25] you know a lot of christians three nine
[52:26] years
[52:29] but it takes that long to call them all
[52:31] out
[52:33] so then israel is truly still born in a
[52:35] day
[52:38] but not just a 24-hour period
[52:46] not what it's talking about that's just
[52:47] a that's just a symbol
[52:50] or a thought
[52:52] because every one of us was born again
[52:54] on different days right
[52:57] but you know what we're all born again
[52:58] on the same day
[53:01] that's right
[53:02] the day of the lord for our hearts and
[53:04] lives
[53:05] all right
[53:06] but he followed me
[53:08] jacob
[53:10] he goes through a lot of things
[53:17] and it brings him into the tribulation
[53:19] period
[53:22] if it brings him to that
[53:27] he's being purged
[53:34] cleansing for the rejecting read the
[53:36] six-fold purpose
[53:42] make an end of sin bringing everlasting
[53:43] righteousness
[53:45] let's get on over to number six
[53:49] well number five brother branham is
[53:50] using what is the attraction on the
[53:52] mountain he said so judgment is fixing
[53:55] to strike the gentile world
[53:57] and the jews have got three and a half
[53:59] more years through the period
[54:02] of tribulation jacob's trouble all right
[54:05] now go on to number six because i want
[54:07] to get a thought in
[54:10] 144
[54:11] the sixth seal
[54:13] for we know that this sixth seal is what
[54:17] the judgment seal
[54:22] yep it's the judgment seal
[54:28] exactly what it is
[54:32] the break-in here it is the breaking
[54:33] forth of the judgment upon the people
[54:37] we're out of this tribulation judgment
[54:39] will come forth
[54:43] out of this the judgment will come
[54:44] forward what out of the judgment's name
[54:46] 144 000 redeemed jews
[54:54] seal
[54:57] what does the word judgment mean
[55:05] it means
[55:06] damnation
[55:10] strong's recorded 29 17.
[55:13] it means condemnation
[55:17] are to be condemned
[55:21] it means to go to law in other words
[55:23] her offense
[55:26] is a decree
[55:29] judgment in other words condemnation of
[55:31] wrong
[55:36] condemnation wrong
[55:39] a judgment
[55:41] israel is put in there
[55:44] under judgment
[55:47] because they rejected jesus christ
[55:55] and you see why they're put there
[56:00] do you understand why they're put there
[56:04] they're put there for a judgment
[56:07] but i just don't understand because
[56:09] they're giving eternal life
[56:11] and then they're
[56:12] are you gonna judge them
[56:20] you see church
[56:22] for the bride
[56:26] we receive eternal life
[56:29] we don't have to be judged because
[56:32] god judged us right there
[56:38] you realize why it would take so long
[56:39] and brother said one seal italians our
[56:41] bible together
[56:45] you realize what happened to you in the
[56:47] new birth
[56:53] you had to come to a position
[56:56] to realize you were lost
[56:58] that's right
[57:00] and to know that you were to being lost
[57:02] you were under the judgment of god
[57:06] who's had a right
[57:08] to destroy every one of us
[57:14] the bible says we judge ourselves we
[57:15] won't be judged
[57:18] is that true right
[57:20] judgment's sealed and we're going to get
[57:22] the next one's going to be judgment seal
[57:24] of the word
[57:27] a judgment seal
[57:31] will you realize to get the new birth
[57:33] you judged yourself as being wrong
[57:39] and you realize there was no hopes
[57:43] whatsoever
[57:46] true
[57:46] yeah
[57:48] there was only one time
[57:52] plead the blood right right
[57:56] lead the blood of jesus christ
[58:03] he took my
[58:06] judgment i don't want it to be judged
[58:11] amen
[58:12] but you realize that i judged myself
[58:16] to be lost
[58:20] and i accepted him as my savior
[58:25] and by doing that then i placed
[58:27] everything on him
[58:36] because i realized he was already judged
[58:42] we get down into a minute where the
[58:43] prophet said when he came to calvary
[58:48] that was a six seal judgment
[58:53] right jesus christ came to calvary
[58:57] as a sick seal judgment that's right
[59:01] for you and i am
[59:05] judgment means a price
[59:08] has to be paid
[59:14] it means there's a place there that
[59:21] so he took my place
[59:25] their own calvary
[59:28] he took my place in hell
[59:36] he said all you got to do is just judge
[59:37] yourself as being wrong
[59:40] you know that's hard for people to do
[59:44] it's hard to get people to realize
[59:46] they're wrong
[59:47] right
[59:48] you want the prophet i think it's worth
[59:50] faints
[59:51] but around said it was hard to get those
[59:53] pharisees
[59:54] to realize
[59:56] that they were lost
[59:59] right to where he could die for i
[1:00:01] believe that's murder pain
[1:00:05] what about someone paid the price
[1:00:11] but yet am i willing to accept it
[1:00:15] he died
[1:00:17] under judgment
[1:00:21] come on church
[1:00:23] jesus christ died under judgment
[1:00:28] that price had to be paid
[1:00:34] but he knew if he didn't die under
[1:00:36] judgment we'd have to have judgment
[1:00:38] that's right
[1:00:41] you see what it means when the jews
[1:00:43] turned down calvary
[1:00:47] when they rejected jesus christ
[1:00:52] they judged
[1:00:54] that he wouldn't work the one he said he
[1:00:57] was
[1:00:59] right
[1:01:01] come on
[1:01:05] they brought judgment upon themselves
[1:01:08] they said let his blood be on us on our
[1:01:10] children
[1:01:12] amen
[1:01:19] see there's a judgment
[1:01:28] can we judge ourselves as sinners
[1:01:34] and know that we're lost
[1:01:38] there's no hope
[1:01:42] if we can't we can't be saved that's
[1:01:44] right
[1:01:47] oh brother dale you just make it so hard
[1:01:50] hard for what
[1:01:54] if we don't realize we're lost we can't
[1:01:56] be saved right that's right
[1:02:02] god ain't gonna override your free moral
[1:02:04] agency and save you we need you don't
[1:02:06] want to be saved
[1:02:11] let's don't get into catholicism
[1:02:20] but see that's really what happens to
[1:02:22] you when you receive the new birth
[1:02:24] you judged yourself as being lost
[1:02:28] you judged yourself and deserving hell
[1:02:31] and all that would pertain to them
[1:02:35] when i was talking about jacob he wasn't
[1:02:36] just when he was wrestling with the lord
[1:02:39] he was wrestling it out back over there
[1:02:41] with layman and all of that
[1:02:45] and he realized that he's going home
[1:02:49] and if he was going home he was going to
[1:02:51] die
[1:02:55] can we judge ourselves to the point to
[1:02:57] realize it if it takes death
[1:03:02] on right
[1:03:03] that's right
[1:03:06] didn't paul say i die daily
[1:03:11] what about the church
[1:03:14] the judgment seal
[1:03:21] have been on the others and kind of stay
[1:03:23] away from this type of preaching and
[1:03:24] trying to bring down the others and
[1:03:27] i sat down yesterday listening to
[1:03:28] brother branham
[1:03:31] you remember how he done he said we've
[1:03:32] been on this and we've been covering a
[1:03:34] lot of things
[1:03:35] he said i thought today maybe we'd just
[1:03:38] be a little different
[1:03:41] and he said then you remember what he
[1:03:42] done he took matthew
[1:03:45] 24 from revelation 6 you know
[1:03:48] you take one and the other take one in
[1:03:50] the other he said just give the class
[1:03:52] something else
[1:03:56] i was hoping tonight there'd be a whole
[1:03:57] bunch of visitors here
[1:04:00] because you wouldn't accuse me of being
[1:04:02] rich and deep
[1:04:04] you'd be thinking i was trying to help
[1:04:06] them
[1:04:08] but come find out we're just all home
[1:04:10] folks
[1:04:11] but the message is the same
[1:04:14] right
[1:04:17] have we judged ourselves yet
[1:04:22] do you realize what i'm talking about
[1:04:27] what goody goody thing do you think you
[1:04:29] ever done or didn't do
[1:04:35] to save you
[1:04:40] no i had to face one thing one day
[1:04:45] and that was the word
[1:04:49] i looked in the word and i realized that
[1:04:50] i deserved everything it had in there
[1:04:53] on the back
[1:04:58] and there was no hopes whatsoever for me
[1:05:02] because there was no man as job said
[1:05:06] that's what he desired he said if some
[1:05:09] man could just be found
[1:05:12] to be able to take my hand
[1:05:14] and touch the hand of god
[1:05:17] and bring us together
[1:05:21] sure he believed in a general
[1:05:22] resurrection in the end of the world
[1:05:25] read the book of job
[1:05:29] see that wasn't the end of the world in
[1:05:31] the resurrection was not what was
[1:05:33] revealed to him when he said i know our
[1:05:35] redeemer liveth he's tall
[1:05:40] a coming redeemer
[1:05:46] he saw the ability
[1:05:51] to bypass tribulation
[1:05:56] we're going to have to go through the
[1:05:57] tribulation
[1:06:01] even if that we taught in organized
[1:06:02] religion see they teach that the terms
[1:06:05] of what they call a gentile people saved
[1:06:07] in the tribulation period
[1:06:11] well the prophet said there's no
[1:06:12] gentiles to be saved in tribulation he
[1:06:14] says only 144 000 jews
[1:06:17] he said no that's not correct to say
[1:06:19] that there's a bunch of gentiles going
[1:06:20] to be saved no as the tree leans it
[1:06:23] falls
[1:06:25] the day the rapture takes place there
[1:06:27] won't be no salvation anymore for the
[1:06:30] gentiles
[1:06:32] as the tree leans it'll fall if you are
[1:06:34] a good person
[1:06:36] and done whatever it's already at that
[1:06:38] time settled
[1:06:41] it's not that you can try to plan to do
[1:06:43] something good
[1:06:44] you try to plan to do something good
[1:06:46] that's not a foolish virgin who is
[1:06:47] merging not somebody that says well hey
[1:06:49] i need to give water to everybody in the
[1:06:51] world because i might find somebody
[1:06:55] that's trying to figure out some way to
[1:06:56] get to heaven amen
[1:06:59] but it's when you just do something just
[1:07:01] out of love or thoughts or just whatever
[1:07:04] right
[1:07:05] and god looks down and sees that right
[1:07:09] you've heard rebecca talk about the
[1:07:11] neighbors that brought around said would
[1:07:13] be given eternal life
[1:07:16] because
[1:07:17] they didn't make fun of them you know
[1:07:19] and you know they could have called the
[1:07:20] police every other day on them for too
[1:07:22] many cars parked in the yard and
[1:07:25] probably parked all over their yard
[1:07:31] they didn't do it
[1:07:33] another one says they'll be given
[1:07:35] eternal life right
[1:07:37] it's not something you plan or try to
[1:07:39] figure out
[1:07:41] he's just being what you are
[1:07:44] but who wants to be a foolish virgin
[1:07:52] because i'd still have to stand the
[1:07:53] white throne
[1:07:56] and be judged
[1:08:01] but you see if i
[1:08:03] stand here and i look and i see
[1:08:06] that i deserve hell and everything to be
[1:08:09] thought of
[1:08:12] that's right
[1:08:14] the united see one took my place
[1:08:19] and was judged in calvary
[1:08:23] i'll give you the quotes after a while
[1:08:24] if i don't have time to read them
[1:08:27] but you ought to know it
[1:08:29] that sixth seal was right there on
[1:08:31] calvary
[1:08:35] god judging jesus christ
[1:08:39] to pay my price
[1:08:43] and he walked away from that cross
[1:08:45] everything would have been lost
[1:08:47] that's right
[1:08:50] he took my judgment
[1:08:52] didn't finish there
[1:08:54] i deserved to go to hell
[1:08:56] he went there for me
[1:08:58] amen
[1:09:00] i like that scripture
[1:09:03] and not leave my soul in hell
[1:09:09] neither suffereth thy
[1:09:11] holy one
[1:09:13] i got to see corruption that's right
[1:09:18] that flesh wasn't going to corrupt we
[1:09:20] know that
[1:09:22] see my soul don't have to go to hell
[1:09:25] why
[1:09:26] you went there for me
[1:09:29] judgment seal
[1:09:32] i hope you understand
[1:09:37] see even that faith sealed you that we
[1:09:39] talked about it's gonna plain grace to
[1:09:41] them
[1:09:43] because they didn't judge yourself
[1:09:44] wrongly still crying out for avenge
[1:09:50] they didn't judge ourselves to be wrong
[1:09:53] it's mad because what is that
[1:09:58] they wanted to be revenged
[1:10:06] because you see they never judged
[1:10:07] yourself dead
[1:10:09] you realized to be born again you have
[1:10:11] to judge yourself lost
[1:10:14] judge yourself dead
[1:10:17] judge yourself
[1:10:18] and have no
[1:10:20] hope
[1:10:22] whatsoever
[1:10:23] amen
[1:10:28] and to see
[1:10:32] that somebody paid my price
[1:10:35] somebody was judged for me
[1:10:39] i had a message a long time ago and he
[1:10:40] never got to it
[1:10:45] you see that most people are actually
[1:10:47] serving they totem pole god
[1:10:54] and what i mean by that is there is no
[1:10:56] living god for them it's just a form
[1:11:00] it's no more than an idol
[1:11:03] but they believe that they can touch
[1:11:05] that idol
[1:11:06] and run around and say they'll even hear
[1:11:08] imagine her voices
[1:11:13] and they believe everything's all right
[1:11:19] you know back in the old testament you
[1:11:21] had to believe
[1:11:24] that that animal
[1:11:28] the lamb
[1:11:30] the goat
[1:11:31] the doves
[1:11:33] the animal that was called you know the
[1:11:35] red heifer the things it was ordained
[1:11:40] you had to believe
[1:11:42] that that animal was in your place
[1:11:49] you know if you're going to worship a
[1:11:50] god whether it be a totem cold or
[1:11:52] whatever it is
[1:11:54] you swear allegiance to that
[1:11:58] god
[1:12:01] right
[1:12:03] i mean you're willing to give your kids
[1:12:05] to an alligator
[1:12:11] you swear allegiance to that god
[1:12:17] and we foreign allegiance to that god
[1:12:22] and no matter what he does i love him
[1:12:28] i was talking to someone yesterday i
[1:12:30] said
[1:12:31] if god sends me the hell i love him
[1:12:37] no matter what
[1:12:39] i love him
[1:12:42] because look what he's blessed you and i
[1:12:44] know
[1:12:45] there's nothing else to intellectually
[1:12:47] in our minds
[1:12:49] know
[1:12:49] about the things of the bible
[1:12:52] you don't everything like that
[1:12:56] to just intellectually know it without
[1:12:58] it being revealed
[1:13:02] whatever you just know god's word
[1:13:06] no there is a god that's right amen
[1:13:10] but he's not a total vote
[1:13:14] when i heard that prophet the first time
[1:13:16] i heard him say he said that great
[1:13:18] jehovah that covered all time in
[1:13:20] eternity
[1:13:24] he said he didn't stay up there when we
[1:13:26] sinned
[1:13:30] he said he'd come right down here to
[1:13:32] live with us right
[1:13:34] he said they're all what israel done
[1:13:38] he was right there
[1:13:40] i told him what a god
[1:13:44] truly is saying what almighty god we
[1:13:46] serve
[1:13:50] to take our judgment
[1:13:54] judge ourselves to be dead
[1:13:58] accept him as our savior
[1:14:03] and let him take our place
[1:14:08] let him sanctify us
[1:14:12] because what is sanctification
[1:14:17] is it not cleansing and setting aside
[1:14:22] am i right
[1:14:24] so you can put the new birth anywhere
[1:14:25] you want to in the word and just preach
[1:14:27] all you want too long
[1:14:28] it fits
[1:14:33] see those jews are going to be
[1:14:34] sanctified
[1:14:36] that's right
[1:14:39] in that tribulation period
[1:14:42] they're going to be cleansed of sin
[1:14:47] that's what happened to you
[1:14:52] we accepted him as our savior
[1:14:55] and we become sanctified
[1:14:58] by the washing of the water of the word
[1:15:04] and then his own life could come into us
[1:15:06] to make sure we don't have to pay no
[1:15:07] price don't worry
[1:15:10] you could believe in justification and
[1:15:12] sanctification as a form of old
[1:15:14] testament doings of trying to commit
[1:15:16] yourself to god and believing
[1:15:19] but there was no new birth back
[1:15:22] there there was no way that animal life
[1:15:25] could come back upon the soul of the
[1:15:27] individual
[1:15:31] but you know before that soul could come
[1:15:32] back into you and i to live that soul
[1:15:34] had to go to hell
[1:15:36] that's
[1:15:45] you had to go
[1:15:47] if you hadn't went in your place
[1:15:51] judgment
[1:15:52] seal
[1:15:54] of the word
[1:15:58] sure we're not over there when these
[1:15:59] things start falling
[1:16:02] the reason we're not
[1:16:05] is that we've done went through the
[1:16:06] purging here
[1:16:09] we accept him as our savior and we let
[1:16:11] him purge us
[1:16:15] from sin
[1:16:19] cleanse us sanctify us
[1:16:25] you can accept the very life of the one
[1:16:27] that
[1:16:29] that's it
[1:16:31] jacob could only wrestle with him every
[1:16:33] what you want to think that he is
[1:16:36] he could just ration it out and give it
[1:16:38] an anointing of
[1:16:40] a changing of a name
[1:16:44] a preserver
[1:16:45] because that's what he done
[1:16:52] no we saw he was he wanted to kill him
[1:16:56] right
[1:16:58] you know god had to go down into that
[1:16:59] old man's heart
[1:17:03] and plow that thing up real good
[1:17:09] he was going out there to kill him
[1:17:13] because he stole the bird
[1:17:16] that's right he didn't want his money he
[1:17:18] didn't want his cattle didn't want his
[1:17:20] stuff
[1:17:23] he wanted his hands on jacob
[1:17:31] so you know what god done and he just
[1:17:33] got to mellowing the heart down just a
[1:17:34] little bit right
[1:17:37] and he's riding out there in that desert
[1:17:39] and he says i'm going to meet him i'm
[1:17:40] going to kill it
[1:17:41] i'm going to hang him up for the birds
[1:17:43] to eat
[1:17:48] and one day he looks out
[1:17:51] and he sees all that people hitting his
[1:17:53] way
[1:17:55] cattle
[1:17:56] goods he said
[1:18:00] i don't want none of that junk i got all
[1:18:02] i need
[1:18:03] no no kids don't know wives i got all of
[1:18:06] these
[1:18:10] something began to deal in the man's
[1:18:12] heart
[1:18:16] he's the moon
[1:18:20] at least jacob was trying to be repented
[1:18:23] i'm still going to kill him
[1:18:28] next he looks up and he sees
[1:18:30] here comes some more of his goods and
[1:18:32] things
[1:18:34] he said he's really trying to appease me
[1:18:35] you know
[1:18:40] and finally rachel walks out
[1:18:43] and all of the things
[1:18:48] no esau says he's willing to give me his
[1:18:50] wives
[1:18:54] i heard the story of how he got him
[1:18:58] and how he worked for him
[1:19:00] he loved
[1:19:04] she already cared for liam
[1:19:08] they love rachel
[1:19:12] he begins to mellow down just a little
[1:19:20] he said i'll still get him
[1:19:24] he's a thief
[1:19:26] he's a checkup
[1:19:32] all at once
[1:19:35] he looks out of here doesn't come a
[1:19:36] mighty war you're riding on a charging
[1:19:38] horse
[1:19:41] neither does here come a man on the
[1:19:42] ground begging
[1:19:47] you know pleading with
[1:19:50] he sees a man that realized
[1:19:54] he deserved it
[1:19:58] and he sees a
[1:19:59] living preach
[1:20:01] you know
[1:20:03] just barely able to walk
[1:20:07] his heart got changed
[1:20:10] instead of killing him he runs up and
[1:20:12] throws his arms around him
[1:20:18] he said you got your birth right
[1:20:22] because you see i didn't cherish it
[1:20:24] enough all right
[1:20:26] i sold it out can you remember he did
[1:20:29] yeah for a party a little bit of meat
[1:20:34] someday
[1:20:37] but listen church are you and i
[1:20:40] willing to lay on the altar of god
[1:20:46] and plead the blood of jesus christ
[1:20:51] to save us
[1:20:59] why because he judged
[1:21:04] me jump over
[1:21:06] we'll come back pick up a couple of
[1:21:08] these times
[1:21:09] do it
[1:21:20] i'm going to find where he was talking
[1:21:22] about calvary
[1:21:26] go over to number 14 brother
[1:21:28] we gonna get through him i'll use some
[1:21:29] of these again sunday
[1:21:32] run it over to number 14
[1:21:35] and look what he's talking about
[1:21:38] matthew 27 let's see what he did there
[1:21:41] matthew the 27th chapter now remember
[1:21:44] his son had been beaten
[1:21:47] and had been troubled
[1:21:49] they made fun of him and he was now
[1:21:50] hanging on the cross at three o'clock
[1:21:53] on good friday afternoon
[1:21:55] just about to take place matthew 27
[1:21:58] chapter matthew
[1:21:59] 45th first i believe it is from the
[1:22:01] sixth hour of the seventh there was
[1:22:03] darkness and all and he goes through the
[1:22:05] great earthquake and all the things
[1:22:06] blackness darkness
[1:22:08] egypt blackness darkness god delivering
[1:22:11] jesus at the cross
[1:22:14] just before he brought him up from the
[1:22:17] resurrection
[1:22:18] first darkness sun went down in the
[1:22:20] middle of the day
[1:22:21] and the stars wouldn't shine two days
[1:22:24] from then
[1:22:26] he was going to raise him up with a
[1:22:27] mighty triumph
[1:22:29] after the sun and the moon and the stars
[1:22:31] and everything in egypt all these things
[1:22:33] taken place
[1:22:34] he delivered israel to the promised land
[1:22:38] look what he's doing
[1:22:40] all right
[1:22:44] moses in egypt
[1:22:49] delivered israel
[1:22:51] riverand was taken into jesus christ of
[1:22:53] calvary down to moses
[1:22:56] why because he said ezekiel sees this
[1:22:58] sixth seal
[1:23:01] he said isaiah
[1:23:02] saw this sixth seal
[1:23:06] i've asked all the purging of the world
[1:23:12] let's read that we do number 15
[1:23:16] just to make sure you follow what i'm
[1:23:17] saying
[1:23:18] paragraph 321 in isaiah let's take this
[1:23:21] isaiah the prophet seeing this sick seal
[1:23:23] open and spoke of it that's whether it's
[1:23:25] important or not
[1:23:27] in order to be driving into our head
[1:23:29] right there that's where it says what's
[1:23:31] this important this happens after we get
[1:23:32] out of here what are we worried about
[1:23:34] here
[1:23:39] look what he said
[1:23:42] that's whether it's important or not
[1:23:43] maybe he picked up that thought
[1:23:45] that people say you know some of you may
[1:23:47] be saying well what do we need to know
[1:23:48] about this
[1:23:51] we're going to miss it until your
[1:23:52] prophet thought you thought
[1:23:54] well the whole thing whole plan of
[1:23:55] redemption lays under these sails
[1:24:00] and we'll get to it when i get time
[1:24:01] there's only six seals of redemption the
[1:24:03] seventh seal don't reveal anything about
[1:24:05] redemption
[1:24:06] there's only six seals that's right
[1:24:11] every name that's ever revealed in the
[1:24:13] world has got to come under the sixth
[1:24:14] seal
[1:24:18] because that's all they are to
[1:24:19] redemption
[1:24:22] well seven seal ain't a ridiculous form
[1:24:26] well the whole time whole planet
[1:24:27] redemption lays under these seals the
[1:24:29] whole book now remember we see jesus
[1:24:32] we've seen jesus saw it is that right
[1:24:34] jesus saw it now we find others that saw
[1:24:37] it we find it typed out in jacob we find
[1:24:39] it typed out in egypt we see it topped
[1:24:41] out at the cross now let's go back to
[1:24:43] isaiah i got a whole lot of prophets
[1:24:45] tonight and he said isaiah
[1:24:48] goes through all of it
[1:24:51] all those prophets
[1:24:53] typing and showing
[1:24:56] what the sixth seal would do
[1:24:59] we'll get back to it sunday and cover a
[1:25:01] little more it's even the purging of the
[1:25:03] world
[1:25:06] the world's going to be purged
[1:25:09] under the sixth seal
[1:25:12] but the main thing i want you and i to
[1:25:13] see that at calvary jesus christ was so
[1:25:16] purged
[1:25:20] until god accepted
[1:25:25] that's him the price is paid
[1:25:28] right
[1:25:28] all right body went to the grave so went
[1:25:30] to hell
[1:25:33] paid my price
[1:25:34] right
[1:25:37] all i got to do
[1:25:40] seal of the word the prophet said
[1:25:44] all i got to do is just accept jesus
[1:25:46] christ
[1:25:51] and let him take care of all my troubles
[1:25:57] you selling a sick seal don't mean
[1:25:58] nothing to me
[1:26:04] well then calvary don't mean anything to
[1:26:06] you right
[1:26:19] because the judgment seal of the word
[1:26:22] right
[1:26:23] anywhere in the word you see it
[1:26:25] you see condemnation all those
[1:26:27] definitions
[1:26:29] and then you see somebody pay the prize
[1:26:34] how much more church
[1:26:37] should we cry out in agony
[1:26:41] and realize our savior paid our price
[1:26:47] and god judged him
[1:26:49] dead
[1:26:53] dead
[1:26:57] that i don't have to die
[1:27:00] sit in the hell and i don't have to go
[1:27:06] paid the price of all of the
[1:27:07] tribulations could ever be thought of
[1:27:09] and i don't have to go to the
[1:27:10] tribulation
[1:27:16] what almighty god we serve
[1:27:21] what about it
[1:27:23] just take what i'm saying
[1:27:26] take justification sanctification the
[1:27:28] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:27:30] take it is seal
[1:27:34] poor
[1:27:35] because that's death
[1:27:38] huh
[1:27:41] five is grace to people that don't even
[1:27:44] want it
[1:27:45] right and sixth is sanctification
[1:27:51] a cleansing
[1:27:53] sanctified to cleanse and set aside
[1:27:56] what the prophets say the greatest
[1:27:57] cleansing is is fire to burn it out
[1:28:01] so the bible says what do you hate yet
[1:28:03] holy ghost and fire
[1:28:07] go to future home and you'll run around
[1:28:09] and explain that that looks like you get
[1:28:11] a holy ghost and a fire
[1:28:13] go to future home and see what he's
[1:28:14] explaining it
[1:28:16] that's exactly right holy ghost and fire
[1:28:18] because he's still burning burning
[1:28:20] burning burning within me
[1:28:23] but the main thing of it was that he
[1:28:24] came down to burn out everything that
[1:28:26] was left
[1:28:30] you get sanctified sure the unclean
[1:28:32] spirit goes out but sure what are you
[1:28:34] you're the same person you was only in a
[1:28:36] clean state
[1:28:39] and what motivates you is still the same
[1:28:42] except for the point that you're
[1:28:44] cleansed and set aside
[1:28:48] the devil still has access to ever
[1:28:52] feelings and memories and reasons and
[1:28:54] it's all that we have before we were
[1:28:57] come to salvation
[1:29:01] see the world one day we'll get a fiery
[1:29:02] baptism
[1:29:04] right that's right
[1:29:06] it'll burn ever germ
[1:29:09] you see that's what happened
[1:29:11] in the new birth
[1:29:15] everything that sanctification left
[1:29:19] the fire comes and burns it out
[1:29:22] because really it's the same thing
[1:29:24] because the holy ghost is fire
[1:29:29] it's not a holy ghost and fire like two
[1:29:31] different things
[1:29:33] the holy ghost is a fire god's word is a
[1:29:36] fire you remember the two prophets that
[1:29:39] says fire comes out of their lips
[1:29:43] you remember the prophet back there in
[1:29:45] the old testament said it's like fire
[1:29:46] shut up in my bones
[1:29:50] the greatest cleanser there is is fire
[1:29:55] sure it's not going to be like it is
[1:29:57] coming into the future home no but it'll
[1:29:59] be so much of a fire to under under the
[1:30:02] sixth seal of the nuclears and the
[1:30:04] things that are taking place until
[1:30:05] there'll be a cold cleansing right
[1:30:11] but there can't be a millennial right
[1:30:13] now prophet said i was reading it today
[1:30:15] i think i've got to know he said it
[1:30:17] can't be a millennium
[1:30:20] until
[1:30:21] the world is sanctified
[1:30:24] purged
[1:30:32] see the reason we miss it see we step
[1:30:34] ahead of everything
[1:30:36] we're head of the world right the
[1:30:38] world's waiting is baptism we gotta have
[1:30:40] our baptism in our soul
[1:30:44] we already have eternal life
[1:30:47] we're already spiritually in the 8th day
[1:30:49] by the new birth
[1:30:54] eternal life
[1:30:58] and that eternal life is going to change
[1:31:00] my body yes that's right
[1:31:03] i don't have to wait to the future home
[1:31:06] to get some kind of a
[1:31:08] change
[1:31:11] that's what a brother up north there
[1:31:12] says one of these days you'll catch up
[1:31:14] with your body in the future home
[1:31:18] my lord what is the new birth
[1:31:22] god is not capable of taking this man
[1:31:24] that i am and changing me and making me
[1:31:27] a brand new creature
[1:31:29] all over
[1:31:31] then there is no god
[1:31:36] judgment seal of the word
[1:31:40] so let's judge ourselves
[1:31:43] you see there was a day i looked back at
[1:31:45] what i was in and what i was teaching
[1:31:47] and i had to judge myself
[1:31:50] that if i stay here
[1:31:53] i can't go home with god's word
[1:31:58] oh sure we all done what we all doing
[1:32:00] right what we all do we want to hang
[1:32:02] around try to help them
[1:32:04] well we did that's fine
[1:32:12] but you see we're just like old
[1:32:17] prophet there was
[1:32:18] abram
[1:32:21] and god says get up and get out of here
[1:32:27] he said where i'm am i going he said
[1:32:29] ain't none of your business
[1:32:31] just get up and go
[1:32:37] he made it
[1:32:42] let's judge ourselves unworthy
[1:32:47] and accept jesus christ
[1:32:49] of his word
[1:32:53] come on lord
[1:32:55] hang on this
[1:32:58] the judgment seal to the word
[1:33:03] jesus hanging our own calvary was judged
[1:33:08] until the moon the stars the things went
[1:33:11] into total darkness the same as it was
[1:33:13] down in egypt
[1:33:17] well he was down there paying my price
[1:33:21] let me judge myself and be wrong
[1:33:25] let me condemn myself
[1:33:27] i don't like being condemned brother
[1:33:29] dale
[1:33:31] when you've got a problem with god
[1:33:36] i love the scripture where we read it in
[1:33:38] the communion
[1:33:40] right you notice i always stop and
[1:33:41] emphasize
[1:33:43] i said if we'll judge ourselves we'll be
[1:33:45] judged
[1:33:47] but if we are judged
[1:33:49] we are chastened to the lord
[1:33:51] that we be not condemned
[1:33:59] we should have a repentant heart every
[1:34:00] day of our life and
[1:34:02] no matter what
[1:34:08] i tried my best to save a man's soul one
[1:34:10] time
[1:34:12] to try to straighten him out on a
[1:34:13] doctrine
[1:34:17] and later i told him i said i'm sorry
[1:34:21] not for trying to save your soul but i
[1:34:23] said i'm sorry for crossing you
[1:34:27] he at least went away and told people he
[1:34:29] said what about a man that would try to
[1:34:31] straighten you out
[1:34:36] and say i'm sorry
[1:34:40] i'm not sorry for trying to help
[1:34:42] somebody no
[1:34:43] i'm sorry
[1:34:47] maybe my actions and reactions and my
[1:34:49] ways of doing is not good enough
[1:34:55] i'm sorry
[1:34:59] i'm sorry as a human like i am as a
[1:35:01] pastor
[1:35:02] or whatever
[1:35:08] i love the lord
[1:35:10] i want to see you there
[1:35:18] if you ain't come to the place like i
[1:35:20] was trying to bring out about paul
[1:35:22] paul said i would be a castaway
[1:35:25] for my people
[1:35:27] if you've never come to that you're not
[1:35:28] worthy to live
[1:35:30] that may hurt your feelings i'm sorry
[1:35:33] but it's true
[1:35:36] if you're not willing to be a castaway
[1:35:39] then you can't help nobody else that's
[1:35:41] right
[1:35:45] that's what the world want
[1:35:48] is people that are willing to give their
[1:35:49] lives
[1:35:53] the word christ can live
[1:35:57] judgment seal of the word listen where
[1:35:59] we got it
[1:36:01] in the
[1:36:02] spiral book
[1:36:19] me
[1:36:36] be willing to die
[1:37:02] god
[1:37:32] every
[1:37:34] get rid of all the demons
[1:37:54] is
[1:38:22] oh
[1:38:36] is
[1:38:53] hello
[1:39:10] right now fighting
[1:39:15] they're getting tired of being bombed
[1:39:18] but they still have that old
[1:39:20] attitude
[1:39:21] you know
[1:39:23] well we want more than blowing all over
[1:39:26] the place over here with us right
[1:39:28] we'll be ready to fight too
[1:39:32] but see the world keeps putting pressure
[1:39:35] one of these days they're gonna mess up
[1:39:38] try to put pressure on israel and that's
[1:39:40] going to be all
[1:39:43] cause she knows who she is
[1:39:46] she knows she's the chosen of god
[1:39:54] do we know
[1:39:56] we are his pride
[1:39:59] we're just not the chosen
[1:40:04] we are his bride
[1:40:17] uh what a beautiful message
[1:40:19] i hope that people sees it you can see
[1:40:22] that from start to finish there a
[1:40:24] scripture came in my mind just as you
[1:40:26] were speaking if you don't get the
[1:40:28] beginning you ain't got to worry about
[1:40:30] the end right but you go there with the
[1:40:33] thief on the cross there was a picture
[1:40:34] there there was a whole picture right
[1:40:37] there because those two thieves on that
[1:40:39] cross with with the lord jesus christ
[1:40:42] was there for a purpose
[1:40:44] one of them seemed that he was wrong
[1:40:46] he admitted he said
[1:40:49] this man has done nothing
[1:40:51] but we deserve what we fix right now
[1:40:54] committing they're wrong he judged
[1:40:56] himself he said he judged himself right
[1:40:58] and he turned to the lord admitting who
[1:41:01] he was when you come into your kingdom
[1:41:03] lord
[1:41:04] remember me and watch him he says this
[1:41:07] day and told him he was told his
[1:41:10] position right there
[1:41:11] he said this day thou be with me
[1:41:15] and see that's a picture for every one
[1:41:17] of us here
[1:41:18] this is where we start and that brings
[1:41:20] us to what brother said i've been
[1:41:22] preaching all night it brings it it
[1:41:24] brings you right through that sick seal
[1:41:25] purging it bringing in the whole thing
[1:41:27] right there
[1:41:28] you can talk about this all night bro i
[1:41:31] hope you know how much i appreciate it
[1:41:34] how beautiful the picture it was to me
[1:41:36] that i could stand here watching a
[1:41:38] vision before me like in my part in that
[1:41:41] vision
[1:41:43] what a great thing
[1:41:45] the priesthood seals and this scripture
[1:41:47] here comes into my mind to start you've
[1:41:50] got to see that you was wrong
[1:41:52] and the same repentance brings us
[1:41:54] day by day
[1:41:56] through the purging to the position
[1:41:59] god before the foundation of the world
[1:42:01] put our name on his book of life
[1:42:04] and he didn't just put our name but he
[1:42:06] put our whole journey amen and he said
[1:42:09] i'll be with you like he told moses
[1:42:11] now you go moses i'm to see him exactly
[1:42:13] but i'm going to be with you guys
[1:42:15] so i just won't keep on going brother

[1:42:20] happened has been happening what's
[1:42:22] happening here tonight amen
[1:42:25] all right
[1:42:30] you know this thing going on with israel
[1:42:34] and you know there's people out there
[1:42:37] if they don't believe israel can take
[1:42:38] care of themselves
[1:42:41] they think the united states got help
[1:42:45] i'm looking for the day
[1:42:47] if they take care of themselves over
[1:42:49] there by themselves
[1:42:52] to prove that almighty god
[1:42:55] can handle this situation they don't
[1:42:57] need us
[1:42:59] but there's people scared to death
[1:43:02] because something's going to happen to
[1:43:03] israel
[1:43:05] if they did if something did happen to
[1:43:07] them they needed
[1:43:08] that's what we got today
[1:43:10] what we're putting up with in this
[1:43:12] country today
[1:43:13] we brought all this stuff on ourselves
[1:43:16] exactly we claim to be a christian
[1:43:17] nation and living is ungodly
[1:43:20] uh where i heard on the news coming up
[1:43:23] over in in san francisco that there's
[1:43:26] people just walk out there just as buck
[1:43:28] naked as the day they was born
[1:43:31] and the city
[1:43:32] is demanded they start wearing clothes
[1:43:35] now what does that take
[1:43:37] you know
[1:43:39] hallelujah amen amen anybody else

[1:43:47] weekend there to have it really

[1:43:58] give up his life for you to be able to
[1:44:00] eat some tomorrow and some of you may
[1:44:02] just eat ham but remember the pig too
[1:44:05] but that way we're all
[1:44:07] just have a good time and god made these
[1:44:09] plans for us to be here
[1:44:12] we got nothing to be afraid of because
[1:44:14] he said before the first bomb failed

[1:44:18] we got
[1:44:25] there's a people here and i'm praying
[1:44:27] that whatever each one of us is one that
[1:44:29] got predestinated before the foundation
[1:44:31] of the world to be here and fulfill this
[1:44:35] and let's do it
[1:44:37] exactly
[1:44:39] it's all winding up
[1:44:42] but let's just go home to not thinking
[1:44:44] about judge ourselves
[1:44:46] that would be not judged
[1:44:50] i do i love that scripture in the
[1:44:52] communion
[1:44:54] it just stands out to me every time i
[1:44:56] read it
[1:44:57] when we judge ourselves we won't be
[1:44:58] judged but if we
[1:45:00] are he takes our judgment
[1:45:04] right what a wonderful god we serve
[1:45:06] amen
[1:45:08] father we thank you we love you

[1:45:18] take us to calvary and let us die at the
[1:45:20] foot of the cross

[1:45:24] would not be set upon you will be rained
[1:45:26] down upon us
[1:45:28] because we deserve it we deserve a lamb
[1:45:31] to be as it is today
