[11:27] here you counted one of us so
[11:30] you know we've got brother ray's brother
[11:31] there with us he's been here before so
[11:33] you know he's just one of us because we
[11:34] don't have anything around here to join
[11:36] up with
[11:37] we're just part of the body of christ
[11:39] but we're glad to have brother

[11:45] be with us and looking forward to a good
[11:47] time fellowship and for a little fishing

[11:51] and gathering together and that way
[11:53] we'll be giving all of the mother's time
[11:56] off on father's day
[11:58] so that's that's a good gift i guess and
[12:00] give y'all time off from
[12:02] us all the way through but we really
[12:04] appreciate it appreciate brother tom
[12:06] and his wife coming to be with us
[12:08] and the lord willing brother
[12:11] tom will be preaching for sunday morning
[12:14] and brother chad sunday afternoon
[12:22] he didn't go over
[12:25] well i mean brother chad can preach
[12:27] sunday morning brother tom sunday
[12:28] afternoon what's your problem
[12:31] that might be best
[12:34] if he don't pass away before
[12:37] it's then just a little joke little good
[12:39] time but it's good to have everybody
[12:41] with us glad for them to be able to come
[12:42] with us you know come and be with us and
[12:44] all for the weekend but brother tom will
[12:46] be preaching for us sunday morning so
[12:48] remember him
[12:50] you like turn in your scripture turn
[12:51] where we've been reading in romans 7
[12:55] and we'll read romans 7 and then we'll
[12:57] go to first corinthians 7
[13:00] and try to get in on to the
[13:02] thought that we've been on
[13:04] uh wade told brother tom on
[13:07] the
[13:08] text thing the other day you know that
[13:11] you all needed a rest for the weekend
[13:13] because i'd been on marriage and divorce
[13:14] for quite a while so you know but we are
[13:17] upgrading up into
[13:19] speaking from the invisible union
[13:22] and that way you can cover a lot of
[13:24] things from the message invisible union
[13:27] of the bride of jesus christ and that's
[13:29] really our thought now we went through
[13:31] the marriage and divorce parts and and
[13:33] now we're just coming back through
[13:35] gleaning from uh the invisible union to
[13:38] tie it all together and then that you
[13:40] can see a lot of things that the prophet
[13:42] was having to say
[13:45] um like
[13:46] there to end because time was running
[13:49] out on him
[13:50] but he was running you know he was doing
[13:51] the best he could to bring the message
[13:53] to get it to you and i and we would
[13:55] certainly appreciate it you know we
[13:57] won't be on marriage and divorce tonight
[13:59] but we're still on the new birth because
[14:02] there's not much needed talking about
[14:04] marriage and divorce if you're not born
[14:05] again
[14:07] and that sense simple because it's not
[14:09] for you
[14:10] it's not for the world it's for the
[14:11] believers of the message only the
[14:13] prophet said
[14:14] you know the ones who follow the message
[14:16] and only for the born-again believer so
[14:18] you know it's not for everybody it's not
[14:20] a point you know but we're trying to
[14:22] settle this point of a few things about
[14:24] the new birth and i think it's a very
[14:27] vital situation
[14:29] that we need to know right around said
[14:30] we need the baptism of the holy ghost
[14:32] more than anything else in the world
[14:36] and that's like i told the people there
[14:37] over and over
[14:39] brother tom i've said it many times like
[14:41] this i would to god i wish i could
[14:43] preach
[14:46] so hard a sermon until everybody in this
[14:48] building would realize they were lost
[14:52] you know why
[14:54] because you could do something about it
[14:55] then
[14:57] you know you could seek god to get saved
[15:00] amen but if you go through life
[15:03] believing you're already saved
[15:06] and then get down to the end of it
[15:08] and find out you're not all
[15:10] right a horrible thing
[15:14] so i wish i could preach it to where
[15:15] everybody would get a settlement in
[15:17] their life and that's what i've done for
[15:18] 40 something years is to try to get the
[15:21] people all of us settled in our mind
[15:24] of what the new birth really is and what
[15:26] it means to each and every one of us
[15:28] amen romans 7 1st corinthians
[15:31] 7.
[15:32] father we thank you we just ask you now
[15:34] to be with us and guide us tonight as we
[15:36] try to speak about you
[15:39] we've gathered for no other purpose
[15:41] we've had beautiful singing worship
[15:43] about you and father we thank you for
[15:46] being the god of worship so we can enjoy
[15:49] fellowshipping together
[15:50] with one another to worship you
[15:53] and we just ask you now that you'd come
[15:54] on the scene as we talk to to the people
[15:57] about the word
[15:58] that your word is true
[16:00] and forever settled in heaven and then
[16:02] that way we don't have to worry about
[16:03] anything we can walk in the light of the
[16:05] word and as we walk in the light we have
[16:07] fellowship one with another and the
[16:09] blood of jesus christ will cleanse all
[16:11] of our sins so just lead us now as we
[16:13] speak tonight about you bless each one
[16:15] remember the sick among us remember
[16:17] these that were requested earlier lord
[16:20] especially the one there
[16:22] the man that
[16:23] just
[16:24] all the problems and all lord and
[16:26] sicknesses remember brother claude lord
[16:28] reach down and touch him
[16:30] and just bring him out of that because
[16:32] we appreciate you you are the healer and
[16:34] we thank you have your way now forgive
[16:36] our sins cleanse us from all
[16:38] unrighteousness and keep us in your love
[16:39] in jesus name
[16:41] amen amen romans 7
[16:45] we get on to something and we just keep
[16:48] reading it and reading it uh
[16:51] this makes 21 times we've read this but
[16:55] the series just before this i read one
[16:56] scripture 97 times so you can't wear it
[16:59] out
[17:00] it's not
[17:02] doing it but
[17:03] and we're certainly glad to have
[17:05] the chad's daughters back there with us
[17:07] and i've got their telephone numbers and
[17:09] address
[17:13] okay
[17:15] we like that kind of boyfriend
[17:17] girlfriend
[17:18] thousands of miles away
[17:22] you don't have to worry about nothing
[17:25] they talk all they want to
[17:27] okay
[17:28] no glad to have you girl
[17:32] paul is talking here and watch what he
[17:34] says know ye not brethren for i speak to
[17:37] them that know the law
[17:40] now he's not just talking about the ten
[17:42] commandments
[17:44] right that is included but he's talking
[17:47] about the word of god
[17:50] which is the law there's many laws it's
[17:52] not just ten commandments to say the
[17:55] laws the whole entire old testament
[17:57] right is recorded as being the law
[18:01] because it was maybe expressing what the
[18:04] law meant right telling us what the law
[18:06] was
[18:06] explaining it like brought around said
[18:09] god spoke to moses moses had to
[18:11] interpret it to the people so that's the
[18:13] way we get it all right but know you're
[18:14] not breathing before i speak to them
[18:16] that know the law
[18:18] how that the law had dominion over a man
[18:20] as long as he lived
[18:23] now he's not talking about marriage and
[18:25] divorce
[18:26] it is right it has been used as that and
[18:28] is one of the scriptures we'll read in a
[18:30] minute for that
[18:31] but he's talking about
[18:33] mankind
[18:35] that word man means mankind
[18:38] see that means women and men and men if
[18:40] he didn't then you'd read that that the
[18:41] men were the only ones under the law the
[18:43] women were not under the law you know
[18:45] but it means mankind
[18:47] all of us
[18:49] are under the law
[18:51] and i've expressed this for 40 something
[18:53] years trying to get the people to see it
[18:55] see everybody thinks the law was done
[18:56] away at calvary my bible says christ is
[18:59] the end of the law for righteousness to
[19:01] them that believeth
[19:03] if you're not born again you're still
[19:04] under law
[19:06] you see why we need the new birth
[19:09] we're under the law the old testament
[19:11] law is still here
[19:13] it was not done away at calvary as a
[19:14] matter of fact it was magnified
[19:18] see the law said thou shalt not kill i
[19:20] shall not commit adultery i shall not
[19:21] steal jesus said i'll magnify if you
[19:23] even look on the one to lost that tree
[19:24] that's right see he didn't do away with
[19:26] it it's only done away with the born the
[19:28] born-again believer is the only one that
[19:29] the law was done away for
[19:31] so then that's what paul's explaining
[19:33] now watch what he's saying now he's made
[19:35] his point
[19:37] that the law has dominion over us as
[19:39] long as we live
[19:42] all right
[19:43] you see later when he gets into the
[19:45] things i would not i do and the things i
[19:46] do i would not backwards and forth are
[19:48] in the scripture
[19:49] and you can see he's toiling in a human
[19:52] element
[19:54] born again in soul
[19:56] but yet our bodies are not born again
[19:58] our spirits are not born again we're
[20:00] only born again in our soul all right
[20:02] now watch what he does and we'll read in
[20:03] a minute where the prophet said he's
[20:04] going to illustrate it
[20:06] paul what do you mean
[20:09] about what you're saying
[20:11] for the one which hath been husband is
[20:13] bound by the law to her husband so long
[20:16] as he liveth
[20:17] but if the husband be dead she is loose
[20:19] from the law of her husband so then
[20:21] while it then if while her husband
[20:24] excuse me while her husband liveth
[20:26] she'll be married to another man she
[20:28] shall be called an adulteress but if her
[20:30] husband be dead she is free from that
[20:32] law so that she is no adulteress though
[20:34] she be married to another man now once
[20:36] he's not talking about just the natural
[20:40] brother emphasizes that in
[20:42] invisible union he's talking about what
[20:45] this verse said wherefore my brethren ye
[20:47] are become dead to the law
[20:50] now how
[20:51] by the body of christ
[20:54] that ye should be married to another
[20:57] even to him who is raised from the dead
[20:59] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[21:01] god
[21:03] for when we were in the flesh the
[21:04] motions of sin which were by the law
[21:07] did work in our members to bring forth
[21:10] fruit unto death
[21:11] but now we are delivered from the law
[21:15] what that being dead we're in we were
[21:17] held
[21:19] see where we're dead
[21:21] that's what i said there today you know
[21:22] people don't want to die we're born dead
[21:26] right
[21:27] when you holler all your life you live
[21:29] 70 80 90 years old but you're dead until
[21:31] you're born again
[21:35] see until you get born again you're not
[21:37] alive
[21:38] you say well are you saying that people
[21:39] are not living no i'm not that dumb i
[21:42] may be stupid but not done okay
[21:44] but the point is
[21:46] if we don't get born again
[21:50] we're dead
[21:52] because that's what paul's explaining
[21:54] here
[21:54] but we are delivered from the law of
[21:56] that being dead wherein we were held
[21:58] that we should serve in unison spirit
[22:00] and not in the oldness of the letter
[22:03] see
[22:04] all right now look at
[22:06] first corinthians
[22:08] 7 and
[22:10] 39. the wife is bound by the law as long
[22:13] as her husband liveth
[22:16] but if her husband be dead
[22:18] she is at liberty to be married to whom
[22:21] she will
[22:22] only
[22:23] in the lord you may be seated the lord
[22:25] added his blessing to the reading of the
[22:27] word see only in the lord we don't just
[22:29] go out and marry do this out of the
[22:31] other it's only in the lord
[22:33] now
[22:37] brother branham says that this
[22:40] romans 7
[22:44] is a prophecy
[22:48] all right go ahead and pull that up
[22:49] brothers and we let just let the people
[22:51] read it
[22:53] he said this is a prophecy for the
[22:55] church
[22:58] now
[23:00] a prophecy
[23:02] that's that's not prophesy
[23:05] there's a difference in p-r-o-p-h-e-s-y
[23:07] and p-o-r-o-p-h-e-c-y
[23:10] p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y is all of the word of
[23:13] god coming down forth by mankind but
[23:16] then when man stood forth and spoke that
[23:18] word like moses it was a prophecy
[23:21] the system
[23:23] prophecy is actually a setting in order
[23:25] of scriptures
[23:28] right and i think that's what we need
[23:31] so you can say well prophecy is speaking
[23:33] of the future it's doing this or doing
[23:35] that that's true because that's what the
[23:36] whole bible's been
[23:38] the whole bible has been pointing to the
[23:40] future
[23:42] it's pointing to this end time
[23:46] see
[23:47] that the bride of christ must become the
[23:49] word
[23:51] and be changed in a moment of twinkling
[23:53] high and walk off of this earth then it
[23:55] can be a future home right
[23:57] there's no need of a future home right
[23:58] now
[24:00] there's no reason for it
[24:03] i'm not saying it ain't there i'm just
[24:04] saying no reason for it
[24:06] because we've got to be able to move out
[24:09] of this domain into another domain
[24:13] and then that way we can you know we can
[24:15] enjoy what we're doing you know but i'm
[24:17] enjoying what i'm doing here as long as
[24:18] the word is being revealed to me
[24:20] you know
[24:21] i have a good time doing that it's never
[24:23] become dull to me after i came into this
[24:24] message
[24:25] the word has always been important to me
[24:27] and it just keeps unfolding
[24:30] gradually unfolding a lot of times too
[24:33] but paul said this is a prophecy for the
[24:36] church
[24:38] he said it seems like it's on marriage
[24:39] and divorce the message here said but it
[24:42] really isn't
[24:44] see paul is
[24:46] illustrating
[24:49] what he's trying to say about law and
[24:51] grace
[24:53] and illustrating it with marriage and
[24:54] divorce
[24:56] right he illustrates it with the woman
[24:58] because she's a type of the what
[25:01] the christ you know the church
[25:04] so it's christ in the church that you're
[25:05] talking about
[25:07] all right
[25:08] so then doing that then paul is
[25:09] illustrating it
[25:12] to illustrate something you give an
[25:14] example
[25:15] right you know
[25:17] you take this rhetoric was the greatest
[25:19] of all to take that old testament and
[25:21] give an example from it to bring it into
[25:23] the new testament
[25:25] and speak to us about jesus christ and
[25:28] then you could just follow it through
[25:29] the
[25:30] bible right you know
[25:31] and i remember you know we used to talk
[25:33] about the wheel in the middle of the
[25:34] wheel the bill big wheel runs the faith
[25:36] that little wheel runs by faith and one
[25:38] runs by the word of god oh we had all
[25:39] that we're really enjoying it and we
[25:41] just had wheels running every which way
[25:44] and that was good
[25:46] you know but i found out one day that
[25:48] the prophet told me that that's right
[25:50] that was israel in their journey
[25:55] now you just think about it
[25:58] israel journeying
[26:00] through the land
[26:03] and god looks at it and said there's a
[26:05] wheel in the middle of the wheel
[26:08] because it was christ leading them
[26:12] through the land
[26:14] and it's a wonderful thing see then once
[26:16] you begin to to understand it so what is
[26:18] he saying this is a
[26:20] prophecy
[26:21] romans 7 is a prophecy
[26:26] it's just not to use or to be used to
[26:28] beat women over the head
[26:30] because you better remember when it says
[26:32] i said well ago it says man that means
[26:35] mankind but when it says woman
[26:38] that means church
[26:40] so those men don't crow too much
[26:43] you know we're in this thing too
[26:45] i remember a man laughing at me saying
[26:47] brother branham had actually made the
[26:49] statement on it is your life worthy the
[26:51] gospel and you listen to it if you hear
[26:53] him real close i had a while he said is
[26:54] your wife worthy of the gospel well
[26:56] that's what most people want to do they
[26:58] want to try to get the women lined up
[26:59] and if they can get the women lined up
[27:00] we're ready to go into rapture
[27:02] well
[27:03] i didn't looked at it like that i think
[27:05] we all got to have our own experience
[27:08] you know they might go in the rapture
[27:10] and leave us being here
[27:11] that may be the point but now what
[27:14] he's illustrating
[27:17] by talking about marriage and divorce
[27:21] see
[27:21] we just want to use it for our own
[27:23] benefit look like the bible says it
[27:27] but what is the bible doing
[27:31] is it just something that we can
[27:33] beat each other over the head with
[27:36] i got a quote you got a quote you know
[27:38] you can quote yourself to death
[27:42] you give me any scripture and probably
[27:45] out of memory i can almost think of one
[27:47] that will stream almost contrary
[27:49] give me any quote from the prophet and
[27:51] out of memory i could probably remember
[27:53] some point where he said something that
[27:55] sounds different
[27:57] but yet we're not supposed to be that
[27:59] way if the bible is a prophecy
[28:02] p r o p h c c watch okay if it's if the
[28:05] bible is a prophecy
[28:07] then it's got to be connected from
[28:09] genesis to revelation and reveal the
[28:11] same thing right right
[28:14] you can't start out with a white dog in
[28:15] genesis wind up with a black dog in
[28:17] revelation and say you got it
[28:19] no you goofed up somewhere you can't
[28:21] even get there with a speckled one
[28:23] you got to start with a white end with a
[28:24] white then you're lining it up amen
[28:27] every prophet what did brother say about
[28:29] the prophet he said every prophet
[28:32] compared his revelation with the prophet
[28:34] prior
[28:36] now i'd like for you to go through that
[28:38] sometimes women explain it
[28:41] because a lot of them prophets never
[28:43] know what that other prophet said
[28:45] probably never read what the other
[28:46] prophets had to say
[28:49] but he lined it up by the holy spirit
[28:51] that's right
[28:53] right amen
[28:54] that holy spirit was lined up look at
[28:55] the next quote where he's talking about
[28:57] illustrating it
[28:58] and you'll see that brother branham is
[29:00] not just when he gets there he's not
[29:02] just preaching uh marriage and divorce
[29:04] to them
[29:05] he's preaching the new birth
[29:08] then he's preaching it in a higher order
[29:10] and in higher order and just keeps
[29:11] climbing and climbing so wonderful how
[29:14] the man could preach but look what he
[29:15] says is paragraph 35
[29:17] paul here is illustrating in our
[29:18] scripture about the law and grace
[29:21] and what's he talking about law and
[29:22] grace
[29:24] all right
[29:25] and illustrating it like marriage and
[29:27] divorce
[29:29] then what's this passage you're very
[29:30] seldom preached on because it more or
[29:32] less retains it like marriage anymore
[29:34] but it also pertains to a greater
[29:35] portion of marriage and divorce
[29:38] now what about a greater portion
[29:43] think about something that is greater
[29:46] than marriage and divorce
[29:52] something that is greater want law and
[29:54] grace
[29:56] to see it in perfect order all right
[30:00] see trying to set in order here that we
[30:02] as a church can no more be married to
[30:04] the world
[30:05] and to christ at the same time and to be
[30:07] legal and lawfully about it than it can
[30:09] be for a woman to be living with a
[30:10] husband while she's got a living husband
[30:15] he's illustrating it
[30:19] he's not preaching marriage in divorce
[30:21] to those people
[30:22] he's illustrating law and grace
[30:28] and before we can comprehend law and
[30:29] grace we must deal with a new birth
[30:32] because as i said a moment ago about the
[30:34] law and all those things we're still
[30:36] bound by that
[30:39] right
[30:40] we're still bound by that
[30:43] now
[30:45] but look what he says on paragraph 212
[30:49] going to number three brother
[30:58] well still got the wrong one
[31:01] went on 56.
[31:03] gotta get a 212.
[31:06] okay we'll use that one
[31:08] the prophet paul is hearing saying that
[31:09] a woman cannot remarry until her first
[31:11] husband is dead
[31:13] now see we we want to lay on what look
[31:15] at our prophets talking about well then
[31:16] women and grenades almost everything one
[31:18] other people
[31:19] remember he's talking about law and
[31:20] grace
[31:23] he's actually talking about the new
[31:25] birth
[31:28] listen to him
[31:29] the prophet here is saying that a woman
[31:31] cannot remarry until her first husband
[31:32] is dead she cannot marry as long as her
[31:35] first husband is living she by no
[31:37] circumstances at all she must remain
[31:38] single as long as her first husband is
[31:40] living and she should do such a thing
[31:42] she shall be called an adulteress
[31:44] i'm speaking of the natural now
[31:49] there's his illustration
[31:51] the natural
[31:53] to type it
[31:55] with the
[31:58] spiritual see we think he's talking
[32:00] about marriage and divorce he's talking
[32:02] about
[32:04] that is an illustration
[32:08] to where that we can see what the truth
[32:11] of it is what
[32:13] to top it with the spiritual
[32:16] okay
[32:17] if this woman would commit such a sin
[32:19] then she is marked as an adulteress if
[32:22] she has two living husbands at the same
[32:24] time
[32:24] therefore she has forfeited her rights
[32:27] to god in heaven
[32:30] now
[32:31] two husbands
[32:40] it's not how many wives a lot of prophet
[32:42] peoples have how many husbands
[32:45] right i ain't never had but one husband
[32:49] all right we're not talking about that
[32:53] we're talking about christ in the church
[32:59] paul is talking about christ in the
[33:01] church
[33:03] he's just illustrating it with
[33:05] the marriage in divorce
[33:10] he's talking about whether you're born
[33:12] again or not
[33:18] see that seems to have gotten away from
[33:20] the people of the message
[33:21] you know they don't preach on the new
[33:23] birth anymore
[33:24] you just don't hear them they don't want
[33:25] to talk about it they got so many
[33:26] glorified revelations until and that's
[33:29] no problem of mine i preach here
[33:32] but
[33:37] see our old husband
[33:43] i asked for a raise of hands and said
[33:44] how many how many of y'all got an old
[33:45] husband a man would say but i ain't
[33:47] raising my hand because that'd make me
[33:52] and the women said i can't raise mine
[33:53] because that really messed me up
[33:56] now get the point
[33:58] the illustration
[34:01] he said i'm speaking of the natural
[34:04] to illustrate it with the spiritual
[34:11] see every one of us
[34:15] and i quote brother branham
[34:18] he said all of us are illegitimate born
[34:21] bastard born children
[34:27] he didn't leave yourself out
[34:29] that's right
[34:32] only jesus christ was virgin born
[34:36] all right
[34:38] and so that left the rest of us in a
[34:40] mess
[34:45] and see our problem is is
[34:49] we say we have the new birth
[34:53] do you realize by saying you have the
[34:54] new birth means that you
[34:57] or your old husband is dead
[35:05] because that's what paul is saying
[35:08] you can't be married to christ
[35:11] instill of the world
[35:15] come on paul spent a lot of time about
[35:16] christ in the church didn't he try it
[35:19] but see it must be dead
[35:25] watch what he says on this quote go
[35:26] ahead with number four
[35:28] paragraph 2 12.
[35:31] just make a little thought in your mind
[35:35] because see when we finish this up we
[35:37] got to talk about how that old husband
[35:39] can be killed
[35:44] doesn't do much good to think about
[35:45] shooting in between the eyes because
[35:46] you're a murderer and i'd just mess you
[35:48] up
[35:50] all right
[35:51] see
[35:54] now what is our old husband
[35:58] it was nature associated with death
[36:03] oh we're good people
[36:05] oh look how holy i am if i hadn't been
[36:07] what i was god wouldn't save me he still
[36:10] ain't saved
[36:11] so you've done good stuff
[36:13] you ain't saved anyway if you think
[36:14] there's something good that you've done
[36:15] to make god save you
[36:17] where did he pay the price
[36:20] just get all that out of your mind
[36:21] that's that's just i'm sorry i'm just
[36:23] the way i think
[36:24] but he said now it was nature associated
[36:26] with death your first husband that had
[36:28] rule over you
[36:30] was your nature by natural birth
[36:35] well i didn't know i had an old husband
[36:38] you do now
[36:40] you read the prophet you do now
[36:44] see natural you love the world
[36:48] because you are the world and part of
[36:50] the world
[36:51] your desires would by nature to love the
[36:53] world which you are part of you're a
[36:55] part of it by nature
[36:57] you believe that
[36:59] and that's your natural thing
[37:02] that's the reason you have to be born
[37:03] again
[37:05] now
[37:07] you have to be separated
[37:09] you have to die
[37:11] to that first husband
[37:15] you can't live with it
[37:17] you can't just say well i'll divorce him
[37:19] and hang him up here
[37:21] till occasions no sir no writing or
[37:23] divorcement the nature of the world has
[37:26] to die
[37:27] every speck of him has to die you have
[37:30] to be reunited again with another nature
[37:32] amen now do you realize then as i was
[37:36] trying to express the other day to the
[37:37] church
[37:39] that when jesus said in his first
[37:41] doctrine to nicodemus what was it you
[37:42] must be born again
[37:46] you realize that was what he was telling
[37:47] nicodemus
[37:50] he was telling nicodemus you need to die
[37:52] to your old husband
[37:57] and he probably looked like maybe a lot
[37:59] of people look at me about it what do
[38:00] you mean old husband i didn't know i had
[38:02] an old husband
[38:08] nicodemus couldn't understand the
[38:10] greatest teacher of all israel the bible
[38:12] called him the teacher
[38:14] the greatest of them all and jesus said
[38:16] you must be born again the best he could
[38:18] do said you mean i got to go back to my
[38:20] mother and be born again
[38:24] jesus said if i can't explain this
[38:26] simple things to you there's no need of
[38:27] talking on heavenly language is with you
[38:29] about it
[38:30] but he says you must be born again go
[38:32] back and check that original translation
[38:34] it says you must be born from above
[38:39] in other words jesus was telling
[38:41] nicodemus you must be born from where i
[38:43] was born from
[38:46] but i remember your mama
[38:48] and they said it was your daddy
[38:57] but see
[38:58] brother branham said
[38:59] birth praying he said it was hard to get
[39:01] them pharisees
[39:03] to realize they were sinners
[39:05] where jesus christ could die for him
[39:09] what about coming to somebody that's not
[39:10] nothing look at the apostle paul
[39:14] paul said a pharisee of the pharisees a
[39:16] hebrew of the hebrews concerning the law
[39:18] blameless
[39:21] that's scripture
[39:24] but yet he said when i found out what i
[39:26] thought was life which was keeping the
[39:28] law to the letter
[39:30] he said i found out that was what was
[39:32] killing me
[39:34] because the law can't save you
[39:36] it can only condemn you
[39:39] only put you in jail it can't even get
[39:41] you out of jail that's right amen
[39:45] grace has to get you out of jail you
[39:47] can't
[39:49] see nicodemus he said you must be born
[39:51] again he said
[39:53] i just don't understand you a strange
[39:55] doctrine
[39:57] i'm sure that's what they thought of the
[39:59] prophet when he preached invisible union
[40:01] and he said you've got to be dead to
[40:02] your old husband
[40:04] can't you just see those pharisees
[40:06] sitting there listening to him that day
[40:10] never was in an organization
[40:13] i've always been free from those things
[40:18] what he was simply telling those people
[40:19] there which is the same thing he's
[40:21] telling you and i
[40:22] he was telling those people there in
[40:23] 1965
[40:26] when it's free for
[40:27] he's telling they need to be born again
[40:31] now how can you tell people they need to
[40:32] be born again when they all think
[40:34] they're born again
[40:37] right
[40:38] that's hard to do isn't it
[40:40] because see we've been taught in their
[40:41] mind
[40:43] don't deny
[40:46] that's a problem
[40:47] we think if i if i say in any way
[40:50] brother dale that i'm lost
[40:53] i'm not supposed to say that
[40:56] show me the bible
[41:00] show me the scriptures on that show me
[41:01] the prophet on that
[41:03] that's organized religion that's taught
[41:05] you that
[41:06] well i got where brother ryan said we
[41:08] make a positive confession
[41:10] yeah
[41:12] he said because if it's positive you
[41:13] stay with it it'll do something
[41:15] i believe in a positive confession
[41:19] but i don't believe a confession saves
[41:21] you
[41:24] come on that's right
[41:27] come on am i still in the message
[41:31] brother brandon said you say i have
[41:33] accepted jesus christ as my savior
[41:36] that's your positive confession right
[41:39] he said but
[41:41] has he
[41:42] accepted
[41:44] you
[41:49] you see why most people are not saved
[41:50] that claim confessions you see why you
[41:52] got millions of confessions but no
[41:54] possessions
[41:57] because it's like i was telling the
[41:58] church the other day over there in the
[41:59] book of acts you know they were actually
[42:01] born again believers they were actually
[42:03] people that had received the holy ghost
[42:05] on the day of pentecost was trying to
[42:07] pray for them people to get the holy
[42:08] ghost and couldn't get it to come on
[42:09] them you remember that in the book of
[42:10] acts
[42:11] they sent for john or who was there's a
[42:13] couple more we never did get to the
[42:14] scripture on it i just tried to preach
[42:16] but
[42:17] sit for a couple of more to come down
[42:18] you know and they came down and laid
[42:19] hands on there and see the holy ghost
[42:22] was it their hand is waiting on
[42:25] i don't believe that
[42:28] i believe john the reverend was walked
[42:30] up and said listen
[42:33] forget all you shout and you're speaking
[42:34] in tongues and glory hallelujah we'll do
[42:36] that later
[42:38] he said let's get bored again
[42:41] you need the new birth that's what jesus
[42:42] christ died for you know what and our
[42:44] came the new birth
[42:46] you ain't never in the bible had nobody
[42:48] received the holy ghost it didn't hear
[42:49] the word first show it to him in the
[42:51] bible
[42:52] you got to hear the word first faith
[42:53] cometh by hearing hearing by the word
[42:55] all right so then it's got to be that
[42:57] way but that first husband
[43:03] that we all had
[43:07] that we were born kin folks we'll get to
[43:09] that in a second
[43:10] we're born kin folks to the devil that's
[43:12] what people don't like
[43:13] they're so holy and pious
[43:16] you know they don't like you to talk
[43:18] like that
[43:20] but is it bible
[43:23] why can't we talk about the bible go
[43:25] ahead with number five and let's read
[43:26] this
[43:27] see i'd like to read what the prophet
[43:28] has to say and i'd like for you to read
[43:30] what he has to say
[43:31] i mean it's not something i say it i
[43:33] come out here and say what we need to do
[43:34] is just die to old husbands
[43:36] boy that's a strange doctrine i didn't
[43:38] know i had a husband
[43:42] but look
[43:43] she was born or married
[43:46] connected with her first husband
[43:48] the first adam
[43:52] by the adulterous wife of eve adam's
[43:55] first wife
[43:57] you say adulterer she sure was but oh
[44:00] she claims now listen this is what
[44:02] somebody else is saying this is not
[44:03] brother brown read it
[44:06] sure sure was
[44:09] i'm not a english major
[44:12] they correct keep correcting these
[44:13] things and putting them up good i i
[44:15] would have blocked that out right there
[44:17] and started another sentence
[44:19] but that's all right ain't english
[44:22] see she sure was but oh she claims that
[44:25] this adam
[44:28] this first adam is dead
[44:31] what oh sure he died a long time ago
[44:35] i'm born again
[44:37] she said
[44:38] and i'm certainly married to the second
[44:40] adam
[44:41] christ the word
[44:48] see that's what she says
[44:51] that's not easy what he says
[44:56] she says i'm married to christ the word
[45:03] but he says later on he said you can't
[45:04] be married to a denominational church
[45:07] and claim to be the bride of jesus
[45:09] christ
[45:10] but he later down in invisible union
[45:14] i asked the church i wonder how many
[45:15] people got up and walked out and said i
[45:17] won't never go back in no denominational
[45:19] churches no
[45:20] but he later owned in that one
[45:22] but you think about what he's saying
[45:26] see our first husband
[45:29] was our old adamic nature
[45:32] are you with me now
[45:35] men women or whoever our first husband
[45:39] is the old adamic nature that we were
[45:41] born with
[45:43] what does the scripture say born in sin
[45:45] shapen in iniquity spouse from our
[45:48] mother's womb and going forth a liar
[45:49] according to three scriptures right
[45:54] and see everybody must be born again
[45:57] amen
[45:59] or we're not in the body of christ
[46:04] right
[46:07] and see that old husband must be dead
[46:10] he goes on to paragraph 151 and says
[46:13] not just put away
[46:17] got to be dead
[46:19] all right
[46:22] why
[46:24] the old nature that we were born with is
[46:30] the adamic nature
[46:33] a little baby born in a hospital room
[46:35] poor little thing
[46:36] first thing it hears i always like to
[46:38] illustrate i like to illustrate because
[46:40] that means i'm trying to give you an
[46:41] example right
[46:44] and that poor little baby is born in a
[46:45] hospital room
[46:48] and it don't know nothing for the
[46:50] longest ride it's laying around and
[46:52] can't see
[46:53] but the first thing it hears is a nurse
[46:54] saying here we are on the full moon and
[46:56] look at all these blankety-blank babies
[47:00] right
[47:01] the first thing the kid hears is raising
[47:03] cane and cussing and fussing and
[47:04] snorting
[47:06] right
[47:10] so truly we ought to know where we're
[47:11] born at
[47:13] and why jesus said you must be born from
[47:15] above
[47:18] there was no natural birth you know
[47:20] those israelites
[47:22] cherish the fact of circumcision
[47:26] because they thought they'd done away
[47:28] with the sin in the garden
[47:30] i've always believed that after i heard
[47:31] when i heard the prophet say a few
[47:33] things
[47:34] it clicked
[47:36] them pharisees said i wasn't born like
[47:38] you
[47:42] i was born with a perfect lineage
[47:47] he said you must be born again
[47:51] what about being born kin folks to the
[47:53] devil
[47:55] now i'll tell you what so i've been in
[47:57] church all my life i wasn't born ken
[47:59] folks to the devil well who's your born
[48:01] ken folks to
[48:02] you certainly wasn't born ken folks to
[48:04] god
[48:06] my mama my mama and my daddy they took
[48:08] me to the truck service inside the baby
[48:11] yeah
[48:13] and how did that baby wind up at about
[48:14] two years old with cooking his hand and
[48:16] cookie on his face
[48:18] and standing there and you say did you
[48:19] get that cookie ain't got no cookie
[48:23] mama don't lie daddy don't lie where did
[48:25] the lies come from
[48:27] because of the domain that we're born in
[48:30] we're born in satan's domain right
[48:33] that's why jesus was misunderstood so
[48:35] much when he spoke of a kingdom
[48:38] he was speaking that they must come
[48:40] first the baptism of the holy ghost a
[48:42] kingdom
[48:43] before they could be a physical kingdom
[48:45] to come to
[48:47] all they wanted was physical
[48:52] see what about being born kin folks
[48:55] to the devil
[48:58] my brother dale i don't like you well
[49:00] good pray for me
[49:03] you need the prayer and i assert i mean
[49:05] you need to practice and i need the
[49:06] prayer
[49:07] so we'll do both of you
[49:10] but look what brother branham says on
[49:12] number seven which is e37 power of the
[49:14] devil 1955-1005
[49:19] just little points for you to think
[49:20] about
[49:23] i want you to study in a minute every
[49:25] one of us
[49:27] under the domain of satan
[49:29] here in this world
[49:31] which is his
[49:34] now that's the way we was born
[49:38] we were born
[49:39] in satan's domain
[49:42] going down through our reading a little
[49:43] bit and you'll see him talking of a
[49:45] statement that we wonder a lot of times
[49:49] you know that the devil tried to give
[49:51] jesus
[49:53] all of these kingdoms
[49:56] and jesus didn't say you don't own them
[50:02] he just knew he'd follower to him later
[50:04] so he didn't argue with him
[50:07] he just said get on behind me but he
[50:09] didn't argue satan could have given him
[50:10] every kingdom of the world
[50:13] because it belonged to the devil that's
[50:15] why there's so much trouble out here in
[50:16] the world well there'll never be peace
[50:18] on this world here that we live
[50:25] you can't do that you got the
[50:27] the
[50:28] jacobs and esau's you got all of the
[50:29] troubles and now we're not even dealing
[50:31] with jacobs and esau's we're dealing
[50:33] with all these other kind of names
[50:34] that's come in
[50:36] everybody wants their little piece of
[50:37] the pie
[50:40] and they don't care who they kill to get
[50:41] it
[50:42] it's a justifiable means you know
[50:45] the end is justifies what we've done to
[50:47] do it so we just kill people
[50:51] we want to know that's the devil's
[50:53] domain
[50:55] show me one government that's not the
[50:57] devil's domain don't mention the united
[50:58] states because
[51:00] you know better than that you live here
[51:03] all right
[51:05] if you got any sins you know
[51:07] but listen see our old adamic nature
[51:10] from the fall in the garden
[51:14] put us into satan's domain
[51:21] and need to be born again to get out of
[51:22] it
[51:23] look at the next one kinsman redeemer
[51:25] paragraph 176
[51:28] and see whether you think you belong to
[51:30] him or not
[51:32] now quickly let's get down to the end of
[51:34] it and we'll find out the next morning
[51:35] when she woke up this is talking about
[51:37] ruth she was happy waiting and the man
[51:39] came and he went down
[51:42] he had another kinsman
[51:44] that really had option on the woman
[51:46] first
[51:47] that's ruth
[51:49] the third chapter verse 12 and 13.
[51:54] see boaz had to go
[51:57] pay the price
[52:00] ruth had won ken folks
[52:03] closer ken
[52:06] than boaz was
[52:08] boyz had to get him out of the way
[52:12] right
[52:15] boaz happened to be smart enough
[52:17] because if you remember the story go
[52:18] read your bible
[52:20] when it came down to the point that
[52:22] there was boaz standing there to gates
[52:25] you know to announce in front of the
[52:26] people because that was publicly the way
[52:28] they done
[52:30] he said redeem the right of naomi
[52:35] read your bible
[52:37] the kinsmen said i redeem the right
[52:43] now what's boya's going to do
[52:47] boaz is really goofed up
[52:51] you know that when boaz and ruth and all
[52:53] of this happen
[52:54] and he tells her you know you got a near
[52:56] ken and i got to deal with him don't
[52:58] worry about i'll take care of it
[53:00] he really goofed up
[53:03] you know what he'd done he gave her six
[53:04] measures of meal to take home with her
[53:07] right
[53:11] that represents the prophet said to six
[53:12] thousand years of mankind upon the earth
[53:15] in the dealings of mankind in what would
[53:17] be in the redemptive form
[53:20] but he gave us six seals right
[53:23] the plan of redemption
[53:26] because that covers us six thousand
[53:27] years
[53:28] see boaz
[53:30] gave that to ruth before he paid the
[53:32] price
[53:36] study your bible
[53:40] you need to read that we'll put it up on
[53:41] the screen and be glad to read it
[53:45] boyz gave her that before he went down
[53:48] to the kinsman redeemer
[53:52] because boaz was christ right
[53:55] and christ knew exactly what to do
[53:58] now there's a natural story goes with
[54:00] the book of ruth right
[54:01] those were natural kinsmen there were
[54:03] natural things and see it wasn't a as we
[54:06] would try to do it had uh naomi and her
[54:10] husband and and all of that they sold
[54:12] their property when they were leaving go
[54:14] study a bible
[54:16] had they not sold it they would have
[54:17] just come back and naomi would have
[54:18] walked back in and said i'd take my
[54:20] husband's property
[54:22] right there would have been no kinsmen
[54:25] it would have been no story involved but
[54:27] that wasn't the way it wound up they
[54:28] sold their property
[54:30] but yet still you had a name tag hooked
[54:32] to that property
[54:34] of who did it belong to
[54:37] well
[54:39] naomi's husband had a kinsmen
[54:43] a man a literal person
[54:45] boy as this is not a fictional story to
[54:48] just bring christ in the church this is
[54:49] dealing with a natural thing
[54:52] and boaz goes down and he says
[54:55] okay
[54:57] you just you told ruth he said you just
[55:00] go on
[55:01] i'll take care of it
[55:04] well he goes down and he says okay
[55:06] kinsman
[55:09] redeem the right of paying what naomi
[55:12] owes
[55:14] and you have naomi and her property
[55:18] the man says i will redeem
[55:20] read your bible
[55:23] and put old boys in bad shape
[55:27] now he already had figured out what he's
[55:29] going to do that's why he gave her the
[55:30] six measures of meal
[55:32] he knew what he's going to do
[55:35] i like to tell natural stories to
[55:37] illustrate you know what he was doing
[55:40] so boy i said okay
[55:45] you redeem naomi
[55:47] you're the more kin i'm dexter you're
[55:49] first so you got the right
[55:50] you paid the price he said okay i'll pay
[55:52] the price he said but there's just one
[55:54] problem
[55:58] he said
[56:00] if you get naomi
[56:02] you got to take ruth
[56:06] read your bible
[56:09] ruth was a gentile
[56:13] i'm just giving you the natural story
[56:14] where you look at it read the book of
[56:16] ruth because it's a wonderful book i
[56:18] remember the first time i read it after
[56:19] coming in this message seeing what it
[56:20] was sitting on the bed talking to my
[56:22] wife
[56:23] about it
[56:26] and he says
[56:29] you got to take ruth
[56:32] and said now what you got to do
[56:34] you know the law
[56:37] you got to have children at least one
[56:41] by
[56:42] ruth and says
[56:46] and by the way you know the law that
[56:48] won't be your child
[56:51] it'll have to go to
[56:53] naomi
[56:58] because it won't be yours and ruth
[57:00] you've got to go to naomi
[57:02] because that's the purchase price
[57:06] and that old you sitting there can't you
[57:07] just see
[57:09] well
[57:11] i'll tell you what now buddy
[57:14] i'll take naomi he said you can't do it
[57:17] you've got to take ruth and you've got
[57:18] to have children by ruth that'll go to
[57:20] the name of that man that died
[57:24] he turns around immediately and he says
[57:26] you just do what you want to
[57:27] i ain't buying no
[57:31] dog
[57:33] right
[57:34] then what he said
[57:36] he said redeemed to write he first said
[57:38] i will then when he was told what the
[57:39] story was he said i don't want it
[57:42] because that old natural jew that won't
[57:43] know gentile in his lineage
[57:45] boaz knew exactly how to get ruth
[57:49] he'd already give her the six measures
[57:50] of meal and told her said don't you
[57:52] worry about it naomi said don't you
[57:53] worry read your bible naomi don't sit
[57:55] don't you worry he will do what has to
[57:58] be done
[58:01] because he was christ amen
[58:04] right amen
[58:07] but we had a near ken
[58:13] we had a near ken look at number eight
[58:14] paragraph 176 the kinsmen redeemed did
[58:17] we read that one
[58:19] just to make sure you understand i think
[58:20] we headed up
[58:22] see
[58:23] when she woke up she was happy waiting
[58:24] the man came he said
[58:26] he had another kinsmen but really that
[58:28] really had option on the woman first
[58:30] never got the time and he said
[58:32] the next one in the parable that had
[58:34] optioned on you
[58:40] okay this ain't talking about ruth and
[58:42] boaz and
[58:44] on you was the devil
[58:48] because you sinned
[58:50] and first you belonged to him because
[58:53] you was you're his property for you were
[58:56] born in sin shaping iniquity there is
[58:59] your old husband amen
[59:03] your old husband is your adamic nature
[59:06] that we are all born with and brother
[59:08] branham was born with that nature just
[59:10] like anybody else
[59:16] there's a lot of things people don't
[59:17] want to quote where he says he was born
[59:18] a hybrid
[59:21] they don't like them
[59:22] they want to pass over those books you
[59:24] know but
[59:26] listen
[59:28] old nature old husband
[59:31] you see why we got to be born again
[59:34] nicodemus your old husband needs to die
[59:37] nicodemus says i can take you over here
[59:39] and show you i have all the signs i have
[59:41] everything
[59:43] that's what he was talking to him about
[59:45] i can show to you
[59:46] i got my lineages i got my paperwork i
[59:49] got everything
[59:50] and you telling me
[59:52] that i've got to die
[59:55] he said to be in the kingdom i'm in
[59:58] it requires your death
[1:00:00] you realize what it took to make this to
[1:00:02] where we could actually change and that
[1:00:04] old husband could even die
[1:00:07] how could that old husband dies anything
[1:00:08] we could do to merit salvation
[1:00:14] but yet the old husband's got to be dead
[1:00:16] now what are we going to do with him
[1:00:21] you may not like this but you know you
[1:00:23] look in the brothers you look at him in
[1:00:24] the mirror every morning you shave that
[1:00:26] old boy
[1:00:31] and you sisters get there and pretty
[1:00:32] yourself up you know
[1:00:34] just remember the old booger man was the
[1:00:36] one that
[1:00:37] caused the problem
[1:00:42] and after a while you'll get little zits
[1:00:45] first
[1:00:47] right girls
[1:00:49] then you get little pimples little
[1:00:51] things come on your face
[1:00:54] and then you get the chicken tracks it
[1:00:56] starts and you get
[1:00:58] you know what that is you're dying
[1:01:02] right
[1:01:03] oh you can get the face lifts you can do
[1:01:05] all of that ain't gonna change a thing
[1:01:09] you're dying
[1:01:12] that ought to let us know we need to be
[1:01:13] born again
[1:01:16] die
[1:01:18] but around say every speck of him has
[1:01:19] got to be dead
[1:01:20] not just hang him up in a closet
[1:01:23] like the sister the lady he said was
[1:01:24] saying it well you know
[1:01:27] he died a long time ago
[1:01:31] you go reading on down through there
[1:01:32] you'll find him talking about
[1:01:34] the kind of life that
[1:01:36] you live as proofs whether your
[1:01:38] husband's dead or not
[1:01:41] right
[1:01:44] well they don't make no difference
[1:01:45] whether i cut my hair paint my face or
[1:01:47] wear ungodly clothes or men just do you
[1:01:49] know what all of this stuff
[1:01:51] don't
[1:01:53] well no it don't if you're lost
[1:01:56] but if you claim to be a christian
[1:02:01] it means the whole world
[1:02:06] born in satan's domain
[1:02:10] kin folks to him
[1:02:14] you know if we're not born again we're
[1:02:16] going to go where he's
[1:02:19] and at to my bible it says death and
[1:02:21] hell the devil is going to be cast into
[1:02:22] the lake of fire which is the second
[1:02:24] death
[1:02:25] so then that's where we're going to go
[1:02:27] and the prophet said that's the death of
[1:02:28] the soul so that's where we're going if
[1:02:30] we're not born again
[1:02:33] see if we're not born again that old
[1:02:34] husband is still alive that's why you
[1:02:36] sisters now come on come on let's just
[1:02:38] be sensible
[1:02:39] you know i like to talk to people
[1:02:41] and like i told them here years ago i
[1:02:43] used to at 16 years old i'd been talking
[1:02:45] like this to you because i'm so
[1:02:47] embarrassed
[1:02:48] you know one day i found out ain't
[1:02:49] nobody in this world no better than i am
[1:02:51] and i ain't no better than nobody else
[1:02:53] i figured that out
[1:02:55] and i started looking people in the eye
[1:02:56] and i love to preach looking you an eye
[1:03:01] you know i get some surprising
[1:03:03] expressions sometimes of course you get
[1:03:04] some too from me but that's all right
[1:03:07] but you see church
[1:03:09] this is not dealing with the fact of
[1:03:11] whether or not we think we ought to be
[1:03:12] born again
[1:03:14] this is not dealing with a point well
[1:03:15] maybe he's right
[1:03:16] maybe i need to be saved
[1:03:21] why is the preacher's not preaching to
[1:03:23] the kids that they need to be saved
[1:03:27] you know what they're getting
[1:03:29] must be saved
[1:03:31] i'm in the message
[1:03:34] i believe the prophet
[1:03:40] so does the devil
[1:03:42] now he doesn't beat you there
[1:03:47] he said yeah but but
[1:03:48] you know i love to be told how good i am
[1:03:51] no you can't be told how good you are
[1:03:52] until you find out how bad you are
[1:03:54] then you find out what somebody done for
[1:03:56] you makes you good you realize why jesus
[1:03:59] would say to nicodemus you must be born
[1:04:01] again and the original would say you
[1:04:03] must be born from
[1:04:04] you realize it took somebody to come
[1:04:06] from above
[1:04:09] there was nothing we could do the law
[1:04:11] paul said blameless
[1:04:15] according to the law
[1:04:16] the pharisee if he had one mark against
[1:04:18] him
[1:04:19] the high priest and on up in the
[1:04:20] lineages they killed him right
[1:04:28] but here we are thinking it was some
[1:04:30] good thing that we've done or we believe
[1:04:31] the message
[1:04:35] that's wonderful to believe the message
[1:04:39] how many were to believe the message
[1:04:40] here regardless of whether we're born
[1:04:41] again or not
[1:04:44] we wouldn't want to read and hear the
[1:04:46] tapes of the prophet either whether we
[1:04:47] even claim salvation or not
[1:04:50] why we caught it so wonderful him to
[1:04:52] talk about god the way he is the way he
[1:04:54] does
[1:04:56] and see for you and i to ever be saved
[1:04:58] that means god had to come from a glory
[1:05:02] not send a son a second person that's
[1:05:04] trinitarianism
[1:05:06] he never sent a son he came himself
[1:05:09] would you send your
[1:05:11] one of your kids
[1:05:13] to die in your place you ain't no good
[1:05:15] daddy
[1:05:18] plain language that ain't much i finally
[1:05:20] got it in the dictionary i quoted enough
[1:05:25] would you say
[1:05:28] would you send one of your kids to die
[1:05:31] in your place
[1:05:33] okay
[1:05:34] got three we'll stop a coin see which
[1:05:36] one gets it
[1:05:40] that's not a daddy
[1:05:44] god came himself
[1:05:48] because he was the only one that could
[1:05:49] pay the price
[1:05:53] right
[1:05:56] he was born lord to christ according to
[1:05:58] the bible
[1:06:01] eight days later he received the name of
[1:06:02] jesus which had already been told before
[1:06:05] then to make sure they named him that
[1:06:07] but when they were told in the bible to
[1:06:09] name it they were told him to name
[1:06:10] emmanuel
[1:06:12] why didn't they do that because they did
[1:06:13] when they called him jesus
[1:06:15] all right jesus is the only name that
[1:06:17] god ever had
[1:06:19] that's why jvhv is won't work because
[1:06:21] jehovah's not correct
[1:06:24] jesus is the only name that god ever had
[1:06:27] that's why we baptize in the name of the
[1:06:28] lord jesus christ not father son holy
[1:06:30] ghost because that's what he told us to
[1:06:31] do
[1:06:33] but you see
[1:06:35] that meant god had to come down here
[1:06:39] to get here to be in this domain
[1:06:44] to make a way that you and i
[1:06:47] could be born from above
[1:06:51] give us a new birth
[1:06:55] to give us a chance to be saved
[1:07:00] see now just for a minute what is the
[1:07:02] new birth
[1:07:03] i believe the message
[1:07:08] now come on
[1:07:11] i don't play games you don't play games
[1:07:13] that's the way i preach
[1:07:15] nicodemus
[1:07:16] the teacher
[1:07:18] nicodemus put his job on the line
[1:07:22] and they found out the old boy was over
[1:07:24] there talking to jesus he wouldn't have
[1:07:25] been the teacher
[1:07:27] he was a pretty good believer
[1:07:30] and i think it was him or nicodem
[1:07:32] nicodemus or grammar one i'm pretty sure
[1:07:34] it might be kamehameha but he said or
[1:07:36] maybe nicodemus said it said we know
[1:07:38] that the art of man come from god
[1:07:40] because nobody can do the things that
[1:07:42] you've done unless god be with you now
[1:07:44] that's a pretty good believer
[1:07:48] would you oh we've got to do believe
[1:07:50] believe what
[1:07:54] how can you believe the bible said in
[1:07:55] him that you have not heard
[1:07:59] amen
[1:08:00] he said how can you hear without a
[1:08:01] preacher
[1:08:03] and how can he preach unless he be sent
[1:08:06] so all of these that went wouldn't send
[1:08:09] that's why there's not too many new
[1:08:10] births the prophet said one day
[1:08:15] come on is that a quote he said not too
[1:08:17] many new births this is where he said it
[1:08:19] he said false prophets
[1:08:21] bring false verse that's a quote come on
[1:08:24] he said true prophets bring true verse
[1:08:30] well i guess brother brown's the only
[1:08:31] one that can get a birth on us
[1:08:36] see that's where we got all of that
[1:08:37] figured out in their mind
[1:08:40] and not realizing that that's setting
[1:08:41] the stage to cut off the truth
[1:08:47] he that cometh to god must believe that
[1:08:49] he is
[1:08:51] not even to believe that he was
[1:08:54] that's not the bible must believe that
[1:08:56] he is and a rewarder of them that
[1:08:57] diligently seek him what good is a god
[1:08:59] of history
[1:09:04] what good is a god that's somewhere
[1:09:06] behind
[1:09:08] come on i don't mind being this blunt
[1:09:09] about it what good is the god of william
[1:09:11] branham
[1:09:13] come on
[1:09:14] come on brother i believe god was with
[1:09:17] the man don't you because nobody could
[1:09:19] do what he done unless god be with him
[1:09:23] right
[1:09:25] right hallelujah
[1:09:27] but you have to talk about a god of
[1:09:28] william brown and won't save you
[1:09:31] you've got to have a personal experience
[1:09:32] within your heart
[1:09:39] peter had a pretty good experience there
[1:09:40] when he was talking about he said i was
[1:09:41] up on the mountain
[1:09:43] he was there right when the
[1:09:45] glorification of jesus and peter and him
[1:09:48] come on peter over on his writing he
[1:09:49] said out on the mountain
[1:09:52] but he said i've got a more sure word
[1:09:57] a what
[1:10:00] what'd he say yeah i have a more sure
[1:10:03] word of
[1:10:04] prophecy
[1:10:05] p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y
[1:10:08] i've seen it all put together
[1:10:12] by the new birth
[1:10:14] that i received at pentecost
[1:10:16] because until then i was mad in a hornet
[1:10:19] and fighting and cutting people's ears
[1:10:20] off and everything else
[1:10:22] didn't save me
[1:10:27] what is the new birth
[1:10:33] i spoke in tongues i shouted i cried
[1:10:37] come on a baby don't cry until it's born
[1:10:40] what do we want to do with all of that
[1:10:42] why don't we want to put evidences in
[1:10:43] all this got to have something a baby
[1:10:45] don't cry till it's born
[1:10:47] you say well it's in the womb crying
[1:10:48] yeah but you ain't never been in there
[1:10:50] to find out either
[1:10:53] i just make it blunt
[1:10:59] your prophet said that baby in that
[1:11:01] wound was no more now you do what you
[1:11:04] want to with it no more than an animal
[1:11:06] condition
[1:11:11] a baby animal in the wound of a mother
[1:11:13] dog
[1:11:14] it wiggles and whines and does things
[1:11:20] but he said that baby when it's born
[1:11:22] that soul comes into it makes it a
[1:11:23] living soul
[1:11:25] where that animal can't do it
[1:11:31] right when that baby's born it becomes a
[1:11:33] living soul it's not a living soul i'm
[1:11:35] glad the prophet explained those things
[1:11:37] because all of this to abortions and
[1:11:39] this that or the other and i don't agree
[1:11:41] with it
[1:11:46] but that baby's not a baby until it
[1:11:48] comes into embrace receives a breath of
[1:11:50] life
[1:11:52] then it becomes a living soul
[1:11:55] right
[1:11:58] so what is the new birth
[1:12:00] you know the word birth means is very
[1:12:02] odd when i used to remember that from
[1:12:03] the old baptist days because i used to
[1:12:05] talk with them about it
[1:12:08] the word birth means a coming forth into
[1:12:14] go home and look it up and then just get
[1:12:15] down and just think about what this is
[1:12:16] saying it means a coming forth into
[1:12:19] that's why brother brown says you burst
[1:12:21] into this burst into this burst into
[1:12:22] this coming up statue of a perfect man
[1:12:25] because there's a coming forth into it's
[1:12:26] coming forth into each one coming higher
[1:12:28] and higher and higher
[1:12:31] all right
[1:12:33] what is the new birth
[1:12:37] let's just read what your prophet had to
[1:12:39] say about it go ahead with number nine
[1:12:41] brother
[1:12:44] let's just see what your prophet had to
[1:12:45] say after christ the mystery god
[1:12:46] revealed preached in
[1:12:48] 1963-728 paragraph 2 33 234
[1:12:53] look christ in you
[1:12:56] makes him
[1:12:58] the center
[1:12:59] of the life of the revelation
[1:13:01] that's christ in you
[1:13:06] christ in you makes him the center
[1:13:11] of life of the revelation
[1:13:13] see christ's life in you makes him the
[1:13:16] center of the revelation
[1:13:17] christ in the bible makes the bible a
[1:13:19] complete revelation of christ
[1:13:22] christ in you
[1:13:24] makes you
[1:13:25] the complete revelation of the whole
[1:13:27] thing
[1:13:29] now you're to believe in
[1:13:30] prophecy a setting forth in scriptures
[1:13:33] and pointing down to this day
[1:13:36] to you and i the whole bible is pointed
[1:13:38] to you and i
[1:13:39] am
[1:13:41] come on
[1:13:43] see what god is trying to do
[1:13:47] trying to get us to realize who we are
[1:13:49] what is the new birth then you'd say
[1:13:51] well brother branham what is the new
[1:13:52] birth
[1:13:54] it is the revelation of jesus christ
[1:13:56] personally
[1:13:58] to you
[1:14:03] no
[1:14:05] he said amen can we say
[1:14:08] not you joined a church you shook a hand
[1:14:10] you done something different you said a
[1:14:11] creed you promised to live by a coat of
[1:14:13] rules
[1:14:14] but christ the bible he is the word that
[1:14:16] was revealed to you
[1:14:18] and no matter what anybody says what
[1:14:21] takes place it's christ pastor priest
[1:14:23] whatever it might be it's christ in you
[1:14:26] that is the revelation that the church
[1:14:28] was built upon
[1:14:31] what is the new birth brother branham
[1:14:33] it's the revelation of jesus christ
[1:14:35] personally to you
[1:14:38] well i thought it was when i shouted and
[1:14:39] i cried and
[1:14:43] as attributes
[1:14:45] a baby come into the world cries that's
[1:14:48] an attribute of the baby right
[1:14:51] we've got to get here for christ
[1:14:56] the holy ghost fell in the book of acts
[1:14:58] and then they went outside speaking and
[1:15:01] doing things see we're turning it around
[1:15:03] putting it backwards
[1:15:04] we want some sign or some feeling or
[1:15:06] some emotion
[1:15:09] and i believe in every one of them
[1:15:14] i do i believe in shouting i've never
[1:15:15] spoken to but i'm a firm believer in it
[1:15:21] i can quote the prophet on that and he
[1:15:23] said you'll lay on a spout long enough
[1:15:24] he'll come forward one day you'll be
[1:15:26] speaking well okay one of these days
[1:15:27] i'll speak and i'll be happy
[1:15:29] now i don't have to have it
[1:15:34] why because i've got a revelation of
[1:15:36] jesus christ that god come down to take
[1:15:39] my place
[1:15:44] he come down to make a way that i could
[1:15:46] be saved
[1:15:49] he had to die to do that
[1:15:52] and all he wants us to do is die
[1:15:55] die to ourselves right
[1:15:57] and be born again
[1:16:00] what about this one look at number 10
[1:16:03] progress 71 patmos vision
[1:16:06] 1960 1204 in the evening
[1:16:10] now ask god to while you're talking on
[1:16:12] revelation
[1:16:14] ask him to give you a revelation of this
[1:16:21] for it can only be known by revelation
[1:16:26] and you can only be saved by revelation
[1:16:34] come on
[1:16:36] you have a knowledge of it
[1:16:37] intellectually but you can't be saved
[1:16:39] until it's revealed to you
[1:16:43] no man can call jesus to christ only by
[1:16:45] the holy ghost that's what the bible
[1:16:47] says no man can say jesus is a christ
[1:16:49] until the holy ghost has until the
[1:16:53] he has received the holy ghost
[1:16:59] he might say the pastor says so the
[1:17:01] bible says so then we're truth the
[1:17:03] church says so
[1:17:04] that is true
[1:17:06] but you don't know yourself until the
[1:17:08] holy ghost
[1:17:09] has revealed it to you
[1:17:12] and he's become in you
[1:17:14] no man can call jesus to christ only by
[1:17:17] the holy ghost not by knowledge not by
[1:17:20] intellectuals
[1:17:22] what do you believe the new birth is
[1:17:24] it's the birth of the word
[1:17:30] a birth of the word i made the statement
[1:17:32] a while ago and let's see you somebody
[1:17:34] show me the any other way there's never
[1:17:36] been nobody in the bible ever say that
[1:17:38] didn't hear the word first
[1:17:44] if you did you'd have to do away with
[1:17:46] faith comes by hearing
[1:17:50] which you see our problem is
[1:17:53] and we'll get back into it later when we
[1:17:55] get on over into the law and grace
[1:17:57] see what we have been taught
[1:18:00] has blinded our minds
[1:18:03] to the simplicity of the gospel
[1:18:05] is that what paul said
[1:18:07] he said lest satan deceive you through
[1:18:09] his septility as he did eve through the
[1:18:12] simplicity that is in christ he said
[1:18:16] how much more simple could you get
[1:18:18] than almighty god
[1:18:21] we were lost and doomed and the only way
[1:18:23] he could save us was to come down
[1:18:27] and die
[1:18:31] we see everybody wants to say but my god
[1:18:33] can't die
[1:18:37] your prophet said that when a man in the
[1:18:38] world could die like that
[1:18:42] well he said
[1:18:44] he said no man could die as he died
[1:18:51] he said what happened
[1:18:52] there the body died
[1:18:58] right
[1:19:00] with the soul and spirit left out of
[1:19:02] that body on calvary
[1:19:04] no god can't die like that as god
[1:19:10] that's why they couldn't touch him
[1:19:13] the anointing the prophet said came on
[1:19:15] him on the river jordan
[1:19:18] made him the anointed messiah
[1:19:23] you know they couldn't touch him as long
[1:19:24] as that anointing was on him
[1:19:27] that's right
[1:19:28] but your same prophet turned around and
[1:19:30] said the other anointing left him in the
[1:19:31] garden of
[1:19:34] gethsemane that didn't take away all he
[1:19:37] was of god
[1:19:38] he walked up there being almighty god
[1:19:40] because he hangs on the cross and he
[1:19:42] said before he gets there he says
[1:19:44] my
[1:19:45] soul is troubled
[1:19:48] he was still god the anointing came on
[1:19:50] him and left where they could kill him
[1:19:52] because with that on him he couldn't
[1:19:53] kill him
[1:19:55] you see church why preach for 40
[1:19:56] something years when that anointing
[1:19:58] strikes his church she won't die
[1:20:03] and the anointing that struck him for
[1:20:04] his ministry on the river jordan when it
[1:20:06] strikes a bride and who she really is
[1:20:08] she won't die that's right
[1:20:10] you can't kill her then because you
[1:20:12] can't kill her until god gets through
[1:20:14] with it you know that quote
[1:20:16] brother around said god took a picture
[1:20:17] of you at 18 20 years of age
[1:20:20] he said he turned around to the devil
[1:20:22] and said go at it
[1:20:24] do all you want to to them
[1:20:26] make them get their little zits and
[1:20:27] their hair falling out in the
[1:20:29] gray hairs make all of those things with
[1:20:30] chicken tracks in their face
[1:20:32] do all of them things that make them
[1:20:33] opposite you can't touch their life
[1:20:40] he said you can't take your life he said
[1:20:41] i could the only one can do that i'm the
[1:20:43] only one that can take their life you
[1:20:45] can't do it
[1:20:46] amen
[1:20:48] you see satan cannot destroy you and i
[1:20:51] he would love to
[1:20:53] he can't do it
[1:20:54] but when god gets through with us then
[1:20:56] he can come get these old bodies
[1:21:01] i ain't worried about that at all
[1:21:06] you see church what i'm worried about is
[1:21:08] whether or not we believe what i just
[1:21:10] said what is the new birth he says it's
[1:21:12] a revelation of jesus christ
[1:21:14] personally to you
[1:21:16] has god revealed itself to you
[1:21:21] not you believe the message
[1:21:23] not your shouting spoken tongues and all
[1:21:24] these things but has he revealed itself
[1:21:27] to you
[1:21:29] do you have something that you can walk
[1:21:31] on
[1:21:34] do you have something that will stand
[1:21:39] all these doctrines and things flying
[1:21:40] about the land
[1:21:43] it's not going to deceive the bride
[1:21:46] the bible says there must needs to be
[1:21:47] heresies among you that they that are
[1:21:48] approved may be made manifest
[1:21:52] right
[1:21:53] makes you dig
[1:21:55] makes you get out and pray
[1:21:58] he said lord don't let me be deceived
[1:22:00] with the rest of them
[1:22:03] that is the new birth
[1:22:05] the birth of the word
[1:22:07] but you know to get a birth of the word
[1:22:09] let me get one more real quick
[1:22:12] now what are we going to do
[1:22:15] how is it possibly we could go through
[1:22:17] the future home and explaining the
[1:22:19] things of the prophet
[1:22:23] but how are you and i gonna ever come to
[1:22:25] a new birth
[1:22:33] he said well you're brother you're
[1:22:34] talking to people that's got the new
[1:22:35] birth
[1:22:36] amen
[1:22:37] if i am i'm not worried about it
[1:22:40] because i ain't worried about you
[1:22:41] thinking i'm trying to deceive you or
[1:22:42] trying to take away your sugar tit
[1:22:47] i'm trying to get you to anchor in what
[1:22:48] you got
[1:22:50] to where nobody can shake you
[1:22:53] and no matter what comes or goes you say
[1:22:56] the word says it i believe it i'm
[1:22:58] staying with that
[1:23:01] amen
[1:23:05] the prophet said every speck of him we
[1:23:06] read while ago
[1:23:08] paragraph 2 12 2 13 of the
[1:23:11] invisible union every speck of him must
[1:23:13] be dead
[1:23:14] right
[1:23:16] go into the book to call the future home
[1:23:18] in about 15 16
[1:23:20] there and read it
[1:23:22] he explains redemption
[1:23:25] in a beautiful situation
[1:23:29] and he says first is
[1:23:31] justification just chopping off your
[1:23:33] past sins
[1:23:35] this nut does nothing to you nature you
[1:23:37] remember a while ago
[1:23:39] our whole nature was the nature of the
[1:23:40] world
[1:23:42] he said it does nothing to that it just
[1:23:43] chops off your past sins read it
[1:23:46] except within the unclean spirit goeth
[1:23:48] out of a man jesus said walketh in dry
[1:23:50] places
[1:23:51] he said that's sanctification
[1:23:54] an unclean spirit goes out
[1:23:57] but the bible says we got to have
[1:24:01] you know the bible says we need the holy
[1:24:02] ghost and fire
[1:24:05] you believe that scripture
[1:24:07] if you don't the brothers can pull it up
[1:24:08] in a hurry and we'll read it but if you
[1:24:10] don't need it you ought to realize
[1:24:11] that's true
[1:24:13] holy ghost and fire
[1:24:16] amen
[1:24:18] well what it is the holy ghost is doing
[1:24:20] this and the fires are doing that go to
[1:24:21] the future home and read it brother says
[1:24:23] when that holy ghost comes in
[1:24:26] to you to give you a new birth he says
[1:24:28] it burns out everything that's left of
[1:24:30] you
[1:24:34] it's not two different things
[1:24:38] it's the holy ghost coming in and
[1:24:39] burning out all of those devil nature
[1:24:42] things that's left of us
[1:24:52] and we die
[1:24:56] we die
[1:24:59] but i don't know brother dale how can it
[1:25:01] be done go ahead with number 11 brother
[1:25:03] and we'll get this and quit
[1:25:09] they're trying to find that other one
[1:25:10] but it's all right just leave that
[1:25:13] we'll find the other one later
[1:25:16] look what he says on paragraph 281 282
[1:25:20] invisible union
[1:25:24] and now and so do every one of us know
[1:25:27] that the whole rank of denominationals
[1:25:30] pentecostal and all are dead
[1:25:33] that is to
[1:25:34] the born-again christian
[1:25:36] of the message
[1:25:38] all right listen uh-huh your first
[1:25:40] husband is dead
[1:25:46] you know he's dead
[1:25:49] how'd he die
[1:25:52] god let it die
[1:25:58] right
[1:25:59] god let it die
[1:26:01] uh-huh your first husband you know he's
[1:26:03] dead god let it die
[1:26:05] it's finished all this scientific
[1:26:07] intellectual education scientific ways
[1:26:09] of so-called bible schools and things is
[1:26:11] perished what's it done separated
[1:26:14] one that's here trinity's here tune is
[1:26:16] here
[1:26:17] over here and down here and such a mess
[1:26:20] up here and call themselves blue lights
[1:26:25] he said that says pentecostals well i
[1:26:27] just say lulates
[1:26:30] because if that's what we think
[1:26:35] that her old husband is dead if god
[1:26:37] didn't let it die how did it die
[1:26:41] because i said well ago and i was just
[1:26:42] blunt playing
[1:26:44] i had a man to tell me one time he's
[1:26:46] talking to me
[1:26:47] he kept on pressuring me to talk on
[1:26:49] marriage and divorce and i finally said
[1:26:50] a few words to him
[1:26:52] and i said her old husband's got to be
[1:26:54] dead
[1:26:55] oh he was almost upset because
[1:26:58] then he got agreeing
[1:27:00] all she's got to do is go shoot that
[1:27:02] first husband
[1:27:05] good you got a point
[1:27:08] now you're a murderer
[1:27:12] the bible says a murderer don't go to
[1:27:14] heaven
[1:27:16] so now what good is it to go out and
[1:27:17] shoot the old husband
[1:27:22] now let's quote a few scriptures of the
[1:27:23] prophet and quit
[1:27:26] oh brother to hell
[1:27:28] i'll tell you in my life i just i saw
[1:27:30] god and i sought god i prayed i fasted i
[1:27:34] did everything i sought god
[1:27:39] come on
[1:27:42] and we did
[1:27:46] and that was good
[1:27:49] well one day i heard the prophet make a
[1:27:51] statement it was really
[1:27:53] kind of shocked my little ego
[1:27:55] because i thought i was doing pretty
[1:27:57] good fasting and praying and crying and
[1:28:00] you know my story i was in this message
[1:28:02] two years
[1:28:04] i was a baptist deacon at 23 years of
[1:28:06] age
[1:28:07] i come in this message
[1:28:09] i was reading i have read six books a
[1:28:11] day and listened to two tapes after
[1:28:14] travel the door wheel and back
[1:28:17] two years i sought the baptism of the
[1:28:18] holy ghost
[1:28:19] i didn't come in this message saying i
[1:28:21] come into the message proof i got the
[1:28:22] holy ghost
[1:28:24] when that prophet started talking about
[1:28:25] the holy ghost in the bible i knew that
[1:28:28] was a god he's talking about not just a
[1:28:30] baptism not a point
[1:28:32] it was a real god
[1:28:35] he was real
[1:28:39] but you see my problem was
[1:28:42] i didn't know how to let him die
[1:28:45] i didn't know how to kill that old devil
[1:28:47] so it took two years
[1:28:49] of the prophet's message
[1:28:54] and a statement from a brother
[1:28:57] that said brother dale
[1:28:59] i know you're not seeking any kind of
[1:29:00] signs and wonders i said i wouldn't even
[1:29:02] know what to seek for if i did
[1:29:04] i said you know i don't believe in that
[1:29:08] he said but there's something stopping
[1:29:09] you from getting the holy ghost i said i
[1:29:11] agree with you because i haven't got it
[1:29:15] he said we'll only make one statement to
[1:29:17] you
[1:29:19] he said you're seeking the holy ghost at
[1:29:21] a baptism or a point
[1:29:25] you know
[1:29:26] some kind of anointing
[1:29:28] well whatever it is i don't know
[1:29:33] he said let me tell you something
[1:29:35] the holy ghost is a person
[1:29:42] okay
[1:29:45] now we got something to talk on
[1:29:48] and he said he's a person of the word
[1:29:52] he said all these years you've been
[1:29:53] hearing the word
[1:29:57] he said now just ask him to come in
[1:30:03] and that's all it is
[1:30:06] you mean that simple was what it was yes
[1:30:11] do you have any experience yes
[1:30:15] my wife was in the altar at the same
[1:30:16] time
[1:30:19] she fell one way and i failed the other
[1:30:26] why because
[1:30:28] i realized
[1:30:30] the new birth was the birth of the word
[1:30:35] i knew i had the word laying in there
[1:30:39] as a disciple to remember
[1:30:41] jesus says there said they took the word
[1:30:43] and held it
[1:30:46] but they didn't say they were born again
[1:30:50] but they went to the upper room
[1:30:52] and an experience came
[1:30:55] that began to open the word to him
[1:30:58] and that's what peter said i have a more
[1:31:00] sure word of prophecy
[1:31:06] brother dale you mean you never had
[1:31:07] great experiences
[1:31:10] i've had wonderful ones
[1:31:15] i saw god when i was 11 years old
[1:31:20] standing in a church
[1:31:24] he said well you just exalted not just
[1:31:25] telling truth
[1:31:28] i've seen an angel three times in my
[1:31:30] home
[1:31:33] no problems
[1:31:35] but none of them saved me
[1:31:41] none of them saved me
[1:31:49] but when the word become alive
[1:31:53] in my heart
[1:31:55] i knew there was a person living in me
[1:31:58] that hadn't been present before
[1:32:03] see i know what the new birth is
[1:32:06] what are you telling me i don't have it
[1:32:08] no you don't have to come the way i come
[1:32:11] but you got to have your own experience
[1:32:14] my wife cannot go on mine my kids cannot
[1:32:16] go on mine my my daughter-in-laws my
[1:32:20] son-in-law grandkids and great-grandkids
[1:32:23] they can't go on my
[1:32:24] experience they got to have their own
[1:32:28] something then that satan can't take
[1:32:30] away from you
[1:32:35] and it may be something so simple
[1:32:40] there's god just dropping down in the
[1:32:41] middle of the night and says
[1:32:44] i am the god of abraham
[1:32:52] may be that simple
[1:32:54] but see once that happens you'll never
[1:32:56] worry about anything else
[1:32:58] right
[1:33:01] then you don't worry about what you
[1:33:02] preach because you
[1:33:04] you know
[1:33:07] in whom i have believed
[1:33:10] what is the new birth the revelation of
[1:33:12] jesus christ personally to you
[1:33:18] he's speaking to your heart don't turn
[1:33:20] him away
[1:33:23] see we've made it to be some great big
[1:33:25] thing that we all have to do or do that
[1:33:27] or do this or do that why
[1:33:35] no just accept jesus christ as your
[1:33:37] savior keep right on walking
[1:33:42] one day he'll meet you
[1:33:45] it'll all be
[1:33:48] settled be a finished product because
[1:33:51] it's a new birth
[1:33:54] he said well nicodemus believed that's
[1:33:56] good
[1:34:00] he had a confession
[1:34:03] a lot of times we go through life with a
[1:34:04] confession but we need a possession
[1:34:08] god let it die
[1:34:13] god is the only one that can kill that
[1:34:15] whole nature
[1:34:18] we can't do it
[1:34:19] you can't control yourself you say you
[1:34:21] can alcoholic's anonymous
[1:34:25] but they'll never take out of the person
[1:34:27] the desire to want to go back and drink
[1:34:29] you say yeah they will because they
[1:34:30] scare them to death you know but every
[1:34:32] time they see that they'll have a
[1:34:33] problem
[1:34:37] but the new birth comes down and
[1:34:38] cleanses it all out
[1:34:42] makes you a new creature come on
[1:34:44] brothers makes you a new creature the
[1:34:46] bible says
[1:34:47] in christ jesus
[1:34:50] now let's get one more quote
[1:34:53] paraphrasing
[1:35:00] jesus christ
[1:35:02] coming and living in you
[1:35:09] that's
[1:35:12] the whole thing that would be the new
[1:35:13] birth
[1:35:17] and by doing that
[1:35:20] then paul said it's not i that liveth
[1:35:24] the christ that liveth in me
[1:35:28] but i've never had a great rat shining
[1:35:30] light
[1:35:33] here's the quote
[1:35:36] the prophet said the mystery of the end
[1:35:37] time
[1:35:39] something to that degree
[1:35:40] it was a secret that you could receive
[1:35:42] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:35:45] without a sensation
[1:35:49] now
[1:35:50] i want you to find me where he said you
[1:35:52] can have the holy ghost without an
[1:35:54] experience
[1:35:55] no
[1:35:56] no
[1:35:57] but without a sensation a sensation is a
[1:36:00] stimulation upon these outward beings
[1:36:03] coming from the inward part of us called
[1:36:05] a spirit
[1:36:13] but he always believed in having the
[1:36:14] experience
[1:36:19] i believe in it too
[1:36:21] i believe in a definite work of
[1:36:22] justification
[1:36:24] sanctification in the baptism of the
[1:36:26] holy ghost to make us the new birth
[1:36:32] see that's why when he's talking
[1:36:35] he's explaining
[1:36:37] christ in the church
[1:36:39] illustrating it as a marriage and
[1:36:40] divorce situation
[1:36:42] telling your story
[1:36:44] jesus was good at telling
[1:36:46] a parable about something that was over
[1:36:48] here and over there
[1:36:52] you know i wonder when are we gonna
[1:36:54] catch on
[1:36:55] because you know after a while those
[1:36:57] pharisees
[1:36:58] in the beginnings they went along with
[1:37:00] his stories and they heard him
[1:37:02] and while they said
[1:37:04] i think he's talking about us
[1:37:10] well that's true
[1:37:12] he's talking about them let's stand
[1:37:15] but god let it die
[1:37:20] he let that old husband die that you
[1:37:22] could be born again right
[1:37:25] he made a way to kill him
[1:37:29] and it's through the revealed word
[1:37:34] taking in that word and letting it drive
[1:37:36] that unclean spirit out
[1:37:38] and then let the possession come in
[1:37:42] there's a newborn go ahead what do we
[1:37:43] got 369. the red one 369. oh god heaven
[1:37:47] amen
[1:38:10] is
[1:38:22] is
[1:38:40] then the best thing to do is say lord i
[1:38:42] love you
[1:38:44] and you said if i follow you and do what
[1:38:46] you say
[1:38:48] you give me the holy ghost
[1:38:52] go wash away
[1:38:54] first repentance of your sins ask you to
[1:38:57] forgive you
[1:39:01] go get baptized in the name of the lord
[1:39:03] jesus christ
[1:39:06] he said well i'm not god father son holy
[1:39:08] ghost that ain't even in the bible
[1:39:12] that's what man taught us
[1:39:13] it says in the name of the father
[1:39:16] and of the son of the holy ghost
[1:39:19] that is the lord jesus
[1:39:25] see then you're christ a bird by the
[1:39:26] words
[1:39:31] you're following the word jesus
[1:39:34] then they start reading it foreign
[1:40:01] amen come on we'll pray
[1:40:05] i believe in that too
[1:40:09] but i believe it took three and a half
[1:40:11] years
[1:40:12] to drive that demon out of them
[1:40:13] disciples
[1:40:20] it may take
[1:40:30] then you'll see a change
[1:40:36] then your sister and i'm saying you
[1:40:38] remember it when
[1:40:39] you struggle with your hair and your
[1:40:41] clothes and your doings and
[1:40:44] your top of the church right
[1:40:46] you remember what that happened you know
[1:40:48] you had troubles
[1:40:50] but then one day it become a settled
[1:40:52] peace
[1:40:54] and you just said
[1:40:56] a bride don't act like that
[1:41:00] so let me do what my master
[1:41:02] my husband
[1:41:04] don't you see the bible speaks of a
[1:41:06] first adam and a second adam
[1:41:10] the first animal just made a living soul
[1:41:14] second adam was made a living spirit
[1:41:18] first husband with her on adamic nature
[1:41:21] our second husband is jesus christ
[1:41:26] and he is the word
[1:41:29] why would you want to read anything else
[1:41:40] and to take the prophet's message and
[1:41:42] just believe it
[1:41:47] because he's my husband
[1:41:51] you know what the bible calls it
[1:41:53] he calls it my husband my savior my
[1:41:55] brother my redeemer my advocate he's got
[1:41:58] many titles
[1:42:00] but his name is jesus
[1:42:04] his name is jesus
[1:42:09] paul gets over there a bunch of people
[1:42:11] that were pretty good believers the book
[1:42:12] of acts
[1:42:14] he said have you received the holy ghost
[1:42:16] since you believe
[1:42:20] and we receive the holy ghost since we
[1:42:22] believe
[1:42:26] well i didn't know i needed to seek god
[1:42:29] well i believe the new birth is a
[1:42:31] born-again experience
[1:42:34] you know
[1:42:35] and if we don't seek god for a growth
[1:42:37] development
[1:42:39] it won't
[1:42:41] so it's a birth to coming for them too
[1:42:43] it's just gradually unfolding of his
[1:42:46] word
[1:42:50] then he's coming back after we're born
[1:42:52] bride
[1:42:56] by the water of the word
[1:43:05] you notice that prophet even goes on and
[1:43:07] some people have wondered rolico saying
[1:43:09] that the world was waiting you know
[1:43:10] everything's waiting on you and i
[1:43:14] what it says in hebrews 11 40.
[1:43:16] they without us cannot be made perfect
[1:43:18] so they're waiting on us
[1:43:23] you know that brother reynolds said
[1:43:26] the bride would vindicate
[1:43:29] malachi 4.
[1:43:34] right
[1:43:36] he said the bride will vindicate luke 17
[1:43:38] 30.
[1:43:40] do you need that quote
[1:43:45] all the things that brother brother
[1:43:47] spoke of
[1:43:49] all the prophecy the setting in order
[1:43:52] is waiting on somebody to come from
[1:43:54] about being a prophecy
[1:43:57] and not just prophesying
[1:44:00] of how good we are
[1:44:02] but to becomes
[1:44:05] what god said we are
[1:44:10] the bride of jesus christ
[1:44:15] what greater opportunity could be
[1:44:32] holy spirit
[1:44:46] holy spirit
[1:44:48] you're a comfort
[1:44:51] to
[1:44:51] me
[1:44:56] you lead me
[1:45:19] our brother is going to be doing a lot
[1:45:21] of traveling with family and things

[1:45:28] to be with him take care of him give him
[1:45:30] a safe journey give him honor and glory
[1:45:32] among his family and
[1:45:33] let your love be made manifesting
[1:45:37] in jesus name

[1:45:44] voice would come back so let's finish
[1:45:46] this with this
