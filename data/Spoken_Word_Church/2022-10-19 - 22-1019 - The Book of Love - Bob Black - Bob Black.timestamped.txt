[18:17] so Ruth chapter 2 verse 1 to 9 says if
[18:21] if you've got your Bible or if you can
[18:23] read on the screen it says and Naomi had
[18:25] a Kinsman of her husband's a mighty man
[18:27] of wealth of the family of elimelech and
[18:29] his name was Boaz and Ruth the moabata
[18:32] said unto Naomi Let Me Now go to the
[18:34] field and glean ears of corn after him
[18:36] and whose side I shall find Grace and
[18:38] she said unto her go my daughter and she
[18:41] went and came and gleaned in the field
[18:43] after the Reapers and her hat was to
[18:45] light on a part of the field belonging
[18:46] unto Boaz who was of the Kindred of the
[18:48] limelick and behold Boaz came from
[18:51] Bethlehem and said unto the Reapers the
[18:53] Lord be with you and they answered him
[18:54] the Lord blessed thee then said Boaz
[18:57] unto his servant that will set over the
[18:58] Reapers whose damsel is this
[19:01] and the servant that was said over the
[19:03] Reaper's answered and said it is the
[19:04] moabitish damsel that came back when
[19:07] Naomi out of the country of Moab and she
[19:09] said I pray you let me glean and gather
[19:11] after the Reapers among the sheaves so
[19:13] she came and continued even from the
[19:15] morning until now that she teared a
[19:17] little in the house
[19:19] then said Boaz unto Ruth heareth thou
[19:22] not my daughter go not to clean in
[19:24] another field click glean in another
[19:26] field neither go from hints but abide
[19:29] here fast by my maidens let thine eyes
[19:32] be on the field that they do reap and go
[19:34] Thou after them have I not charged the
[19:36] young men that they shall not touch thee
[19:38] and when thou art a thirst go unto the
[19:41] vessels and drink of that which the
[19:43] young men have drawn and may be seated
[19:45] the Lord has a blessing to the reading
[19:46] of the word
[19:48] and I think I think this is uh uh this
[19:51] is a an example of one of the greatest
[19:53] love sings the greatest love stories
[19:55] that's ever been told and you know
[19:58] you're looking at the Bible and you you
[19:59] see the whole Bible that speaks of a
[20:02] love story between between Christ and
[20:04] his bride and it's echoed all throughout
[20:06] the scriptures with stories like this
[20:08] one and brother I'm sitting in a while
[20:09] little Bethlehem and he said when Ruth
[20:11] and Boaz was married one of the greatest
[20:13] love scenes of all ages when Ruth and
[20:16] Boaz were married and you think about
[20:18] that scene unfolding when when Ruth when
[20:20] when Ruth was out there gleaning in the
[20:22] Harvest and she was out there with a
[20:24] purpose he wouldn't just so some some
[20:26] floozy some some Jezebel looking woman
[20:28] but she was out there she was wanting
[20:30] the things of God she was wanting she
[20:32] was fulfilling the plan of God in her
[20:34] life and she Boaz looked out I looked
[20:37] out over the field and and something
[20:39] began to stir with it within him he
[20:40] wanted to know who that was who is this
[20:43] is out here in the field gleaning and
[20:45] going through all this this this act of
[20:48] the love story you know Humanity I think
[20:51] Humanity loves a great love story you
[20:53] know I've got a lot of daughters and
[20:55] they they love all these Cinderellas and
[20:57] Snow Whites and all that kind of stuff
[20:59] and anybody you know people love people
[21:01] love love stories you know you you hear
[21:04] you read the stories of Pride and
[21:06] Prejudice and all that stuff you know
[21:07] that all those things but here's the
[21:09] here's really the greatest love story
[21:11] that's ever been told laid out before
[21:13] you you think about what love is love
[21:15] real I'm talking about real agape love
[21:18] agape love is when somebody like Boaz
[21:21] could come along and look out in the
[21:22] field and see somebody that ain't got no
[21:24] claim to nothing I know about us that
[21:26] don't get came from nothing and it
[21:28] doesn't have nothing to her name and can
[21:30] love somebody like that and that's the
[21:32] kind of love that was expressed by God
[21:34] to us is when God looked down at your
[21:36] life and maybe you were in the admirer
[21:38] of sin and the muck on the side of the
[21:39] road and God pulled you out and said I
[21:41] love you and God did something and began
[21:44] to work something in your life and you
[21:45] see what real agape love is is when when
[21:48] you look at something look at look at
[21:50] something that doesn't have any
[21:51] consequence and yet you can love it
[21:53] that's how much God loved the world that
[21:55] he come and died for that whosoever will
[21:57] believe on him would be saved Despite
[21:59] All the Troubles despite all the
[22:01] heartache despite all the sin and the
[22:03] mess that Humanity got themselves into
[22:04] but yet God looked at us and said I love
[22:07] him and he came down and died for us
[22:09] oh you think about all the stories that
[22:11] brother bam told about how that God so
[22:14] loved that he cared about a little
[22:15] opossum and if you've ever seen an
[22:17] apostle we've got him come up in the
[22:19] driveway before and come in the backyard
[22:21] and they're all covered in ticks and
[22:23] looking off and they say possums are
[22:25] clean but every possum I've seen smells
[22:27] terrible smells like a homeless person
[22:28] from Atlanta they said it smells
[22:30] horrible and
[22:32] and and you you get you you think about
[22:35] that God loves so much that that possum
[22:39] come up that even brother Branham didn't
[22:40] think nothing about that God turned his
[22:42] attention to that possum and said go and
[22:44] pray for that little stinking opossum
[22:46] why cause I love you think about Jesus
[22:50] it would tell a story about a lily if
[22:52] God can clothe the Lily that's out there
[22:54] in the field that nobody even knows is
[22:56] growing out there and can take care of
[22:57] that Lily or take care of that Spirit of
[23:00] how much more is God going to take care
[23:01] of you because God loves the unlovable
[23:04] he loves those that are Wayward he loves
[23:06] those that have gone astray cause that's
[23:09] what Agape Love Is God loves those that
[23:12] nobody else cares about
[23:14] you know you think that God would love
[23:16] you enough to die for you and that's why
[23:18] we love him back because he loved us so
[23:21] much he loved us when we were unlovable
[23:23] and now we love him back we love a God
[23:26] that can come down and die for us you
[23:28] love him tonight you love him because
[23:30] you love him enough to die to yourself
[23:33] or him he loved you enough to die for
[23:36] you and you love you you love him enough
[23:37] to die to yourself
[23:39] you see what that's what the gospel is
[23:41] the gospel is not the gospel was never
[23:43] intended to just be a head knowledge
[23:45] kind of thing when you just know a lot
[23:47] of information but the gospel is to
[23:49] bring you into a personal relationship
[23:51] with God because you love God you love
[23:54] the one that loved you I want to ask you
[23:57] tonight what did you come here tonight
[23:58] to see did you come here tonight to see
[24:01] the preacher to come here tonight to see
[24:02] one another did you come here expect him
[24:05] to fill your place in the Pew or to do
[24:07] about to fulfill it action like Paul
[24:10] called a dead work or did you come
[24:12] because you have a personal relationship
[24:14] with a God that shaved you and you love
[24:17] him and you come you come expecting to
[24:19] receive something from that God that
[24:21] loves you you expect to receive some
[24:23] strength tonight something from the god
[24:26] that come down and send a message from
[24:28] Glory down to help you tonight what do
[24:30] you love about church are you in love
[24:32] with the ministry are you in love with
[24:34] Fellowship are you in love with study
[24:36] with a lot of information so you can
[24:38] tell everybody how much you know oh are
[24:40] you in love with a good feeling or with
[24:42] the anointing after you love the person
[24:44] of Jesus Christ that's what I'm talking
[24:46] about tonight Christ is the main thing
[24:49] Christ is the one that you you're to
[24:51] have a relationship with if you think
[24:53] about so many times people want to have
[24:55] a relate they want to get a good remark
[24:57] from the minister they want to get a
[24:59] good remark from their fella but Christ
[25:01] is the one that I want to please I want
[25:03] to pray please God that you know if God
[25:05] is pleased with our service with our
[25:07] worship tonight he'll come in and abide
[25:09] with us you come in and make his
[25:10] presence known if we'll make him happy
[25:13] tonight God's the one I want to make
[25:15] happy God's the one I want to please
[25:18] now you think about that story that
[25:20] brother I'm told her that the armor the
[25:22] son of the armor Meat Packing Company
[25:24] how he come and he went down to the to
[25:27] the to the little ranch there and he
[25:29] looked out and he saw a girl that nobody
[25:30] else paid any mind to she she had uh you
[25:35] know she's working there in the kitchen
[25:36] washing dishes or whatever and and he
[25:39] that that was the one that he began to
[25:41] fall in love with why did he fall in
[25:43] love with it because he's he was looking
[25:45] at God see God don't look at the outside
[25:48] God don't look at the outside but this
[25:50] man began to look on the inside what's
[25:52] on the inside your character he began to
[25:55] look down on the inside of what kind of
[25:57] a character that little girl had and he
[25:59] said this this girl has got some virtue
[26:01] this girl is a virtuous little woman and
[26:03] he began to talk to her and began to
[26:05] recognize this this is the one that I
[26:07] want to marry y'all you think you think
[26:09] young people tonight when you look at
[26:11] when you're going to search for a mate
[26:13] you but the outside might look all kinds
[26:15] of pretty and nice and handsome and
[26:17] different kind of things their feet I
[26:19] smell good and their hair might be cut
[26:20] right but look down on the inside what
[26:22] do they look do they love God do they
[26:25] are they capable of Love do they love
[26:28] love is the thing look down on the
[26:31] inside like God God said about David he
[26:33] said he's a man after my own heart my
[26:36] the heart the heart is what God is after
[26:38] and that story that
[26:41] that little almond meat packing company
[26:43] that little that son of the armor armor
[26:45] meat packing uh owner he was interested
[26:48] in that girl because of her of her
[26:50] character and he he said I'm coming
[26:52] after you and when he came back a year
[26:54] later she was there waiting on him and
[26:56] she wasn't she wasn't just waiting she
[26:58] was she was waiting prepared she was she
[27:00] had got herself ready she had got
[27:02] herself clothes and she was ready for
[27:03] him to come riding around and she said I
[27:05] I had caught she knew she had confidence
[27:08] in him because she loved him she knew
[27:10] that he loved her and she she loved him
[27:12] because of it Philippians 1 says and
[27:16] this I pray that your love may abound it
[27:18] more and more and knowledge and in all
[27:20] judgment that ye may approve things that
[27:22] are excellent that you may be sincere
[27:24] and wow without offense to the day of
[27:26] Christ Colossians chapter 3 verse 19
[27:29] says husbands love your wives and be not
[27:31] bitter against him because love love is
[27:34] the thing that conquers everything I'm
[27:36] talking about the love I'm talking about
[27:37] the kind of love tonight that would make
[27:39] Adam want to go out in the garden with
[27:41] Eve I'm talking about a love where he
[27:43] could see that Eve had done wrong but he
[27:45] had something I got to go out I I want
[27:47] to I gotta save her now God could have
[27:50] struck her down and killed her and
[27:51] started everything over again but he I
[27:53] believe that Adam was like I want that
[27:55] one that's the one that come out of my
[27:57] side that's the one that's part of me
[27:59] that's the one that's bone in my bone
[28:01] the Flesh in my flesh I don't want to
[28:03] start the thing over again that's the
[28:05] one I want because the love of God was
[28:07] in him now we know that the attribute of
[28:09] God wasn't in him to to the attribute
[28:12] couldn't be manifesting Adam actually do
[28:14] the saving like it could be in Jesus
[28:16] Christ
[28:18] but yet he tried
[28:20] he tried I wondered tonight could we say
[28:23] that we love like that when you're when
[28:25] your spouse does something wrong Real
[28:27] Love is when you when you're getting an
[28:29] argument with your spouse and you get
[28:31] upset with them but yet you love them
[28:33] you love the thing that cannot be he
[28:36] loves it doesn't matter what somebody
[28:38] does to you it doesn't matter how they
[28:40] how they reproach you or what they say
[28:42] to you but you love them anyway
[28:45] you love your spouse because they're
[28:47] part of you you love one another you
[28:49] know you love them you love the church
[28:51] because you're part of the same body you
[28:53] love your fellow Believers because we're
[28:55] part of that same mysterious mystical
[28:57] body you love one another because you
[28:59] love God
[29:02] Let Your Love More abound yet more and
[29:04] more Paul says see God don't want your
[29:07] head this is not an extra intellectual
[29:10] gospel where we come to church knowing
[29:11] all kinds of knowing how we should
[29:13] behave knowing what we're supposed to do
[29:14] but God wants your heart and let me ask
[29:16] you this question tonight are you
[29:18] willing to give it are you willing to
[29:19] open up every door of your heart are you
[29:21] able to open up completely that he can
[29:23] have preeminists because he wants to be
[29:25] the your lord he wants to be your savior
[29:27] he wants to be everything brother said
[29:30] God don't care how much education you
[29:31] got he wants your heart he don't care
[29:34] how much you know he wants your heart he
[29:36] don't care what's up in here he wants
[29:37] your heart the only thing that Christ
[29:39] will be wrapped in and that's your heart
[29:41] not your Creed he wants your heart he's
[29:44] not going to be wrapped up in your Creed
[29:45] but he's going to be wrapped up in the
[29:47] manger of your heart if your whole heart
[29:49] is in love with him brother Brown said
[29:51] and you love him and are gentle and live
[29:54] with him daily you know you've passed
[29:56] from Death unto life if it isn't and
[29:58] you're otherwise you're just
[30:00] impersonating a Christian
[30:01] oh you see unless God has your heart if
[30:06] God doesn't have your heart you'll never
[30:08] be able to understand this book because
[30:10] God requires your heart to be able to
[30:12] look into this book of love it's a book
[30:14] of love and you got to have God you've
[30:17] got to love God to be able to understand
[30:18] it brother said the Bible is a
[30:21] supernatural book it's written so that
[30:23] it's hid from the school's Theologian
[30:25] it's a book of love when the Bible when
[30:28] the love of God comes into the heart
[30:29] then you fall in love with God then he
[30:31] reveals himself the Bible meaning
[30:34] the interpretation of the Bible is God
[30:37] himself interpreting his promises
[30:39] but the Bible is written between the
[30:42] lines
[30:43] amen oh come on now how many of you have
[30:46] received an email from your spouse from
[30:48] your wife or received a little letter we
[30:50] don't we don't write letters by hand
[30:51] anymore do we we saw it's all text or
[30:54] whatever but you can still read between
[30:55] the lines
[30:57] you can still read those read read the
[31:00] things that are written there on the
[31:01] page and say I I'm seeing something
[31:03] Beyond what's there in black and white
[31:05] I'm seeing something Beyond it you know
[31:07] the the word of God is just like that
[31:10] you open up the pages of the Bible and
[31:12] it begins to come to life when you read
[31:16] the book of Ruth and and you see the
[31:18] Love Story unfolding you read the book
[31:19] of The Song of Solomon you see the story
[31:22] of God expressing his love to that
[31:24] shulamite woman you see the story of God
[31:26] expressing his love and it's you begin
[31:28] to read the read between the lines
[31:30] because God is God revealing himself to
[31:32] you
[31:34] foreign
[31:35] it's the word of God the word of God is
[31:37] what moves a Believer so you think about
[31:39] Elijah when he was back in that cave and
[31:41] he heard he heard the wind moving
[31:43] outside and he heard the earthquake
[31:45] moving and then he heard that heard that
[31:47] fire rolling by but then he heard the
[31:49] steel Small Voice God's voice drawing
[31:51] that's what moves a Believer but God can
[31:54] see God when a Believer can see God that
[31:56] love of God expressed that's what that's
[31:59] what caused Elijah to come forth out of
[32:00] that cave when he heard that's what
[32:02] caused a a sinner to come forth to come
[32:05] forth and be drawn to God is when they
[32:07] say the love of God Express when they
[32:09] see something begin to move and they see
[32:11] something genuine and real be expressed
[32:15] we've all heard the story of the chicken
[32:16] in the barnyard but y'all remember the
[32:18] story of the duck in the barnyard
[32:20] the duck down with the chickens well I
[32:22] know we heard the story of the the eagle
[32:24] in the barnyard I mean the eagle the
[32:26] eagle in the barnyard with all the
[32:27] chickens but what about the duck in the
[32:29] barnyard with all the chickens
[32:31] now brother said that duck that duck
[32:33] that was a duck that was born in the
[32:35] barnyard and he didn't know that he was
[32:36] a duck he thought he was a chicken
[32:38] because he was surrounded by all the
[32:40] chickens and and all the roosters and
[32:42] everything would be you know leading him
[32:44] over there to peck on the ground and he
[32:46] thought he was just a chicken but one
[32:48] day one day that duck got a smell of
[32:50] water and he began to realize that he
[32:53] needed to he wanted to go toward that
[32:54] water if you've ever seen a duck ducks
[32:56] are so messy aren't they because they
[32:58] love water you give them a little spot
[32:59] in the backyard and I go thrashing
[33:01] around and turning a whole backyard into
[33:03] a mud pit but that's because Ducks love
[33:05] water and why why they love water
[33:07] because it's being built within them
[33:08] they got to go to that water and you see
[33:10] you you you let you let somebody hear
[33:13] the gospel something will give them to
[33:15] Quicken within them and they begin to
[33:16] realize that's the thing that I wanted
[33:18] all my life what is it what is it
[33:20] something love begins to spring up that
[33:22] if God could love you so much they're
[33:25] unlovable and God could die for you and
[33:27] pay the price for you and be willing to
[33:29] change your heart and change your life
[33:31] and change change your makeup and change
[33:33] your life trajectory
[33:34] it'll it'll change you
[33:36] brother brother said you've see you put
[33:38] Christ the word in front of a real
[33:40] believer and they'll make a beeline for
[33:41] it just like that duck went straight to
[33:43] the water you put Christ the word in
[33:45] front of a real believer and they're not
[33:46] they're not going to let nothing stand
[33:48] between them and that water the water of
[33:50] the word they won't let nothing nothing
[33:53] somebody can say nothing nobody's
[33:55] hypocritical life no harsh words you're
[33:58] not going to be able to keep nothing
[34:00] you'll never be able to keep a real True
[34:03] Believer a rate away from the word of
[34:04] God from the promises of God
[34:07] because you love God oh you see what
[34:10] love will do love will make you
[34:12] persevere love will make you stand true
[34:14] love will make you go to the end love
[34:15] will make you run this race but with the
[34:18] goal in sight because you love God if
[34:20] you love God the way that the Bible's
[34:22] talking about nothing is going to keep
[34:24] you from that goal nothing is going to
[34:26] keep you from that Finish Line you put
[34:28] the you put Christ a genuine a genuine
[34:31] message of Christ out there it's going
[34:33] to call and it's going to draw oh you
[34:35] think about what Ruth was doing here
[34:37] Ruth wasn't forced she wasn't forced to
[34:39] lay at boaz's feet in the threshing
[34:41] floor but she did it because she loved
[34:43] him she wasn't forced to do it or Boaz
[34:45] wasn't made to stand in the gate and
[34:47] remove his shoe he didn't have somebody
[34:49] tell you better do that you've got to do
[34:50] it but he did it because it was love he
[34:52] loved Ruth he loved and it was love that
[34:55] was moving on the scene love was an
[34:57] action but was it Boaz wasn't forced to
[35:00] marry him more about us but he loved her
[35:02] he did it because he loved her he loved
[35:05] her and let's see you see Revelation is
[35:07] not something in your head Revelation
[35:09] this afternoon is not education
[35:11] Revelation is not just something
[35:12] intellectual Revelation is
[35:15] reading the Bible is not like taking
[35:17] appeal and popping appeal but Revelation
[35:19] is not coming under the wheel and
[35:21] opinion of another someone explaining to
[35:23] me until I cannot refute what they were
[35:25] saying someone beat me down but you're
[35:27] in love with Christ and love is what
[35:29] fuels the church love is what drives it
[35:32] love is what draws The Sinner to
[35:33] repentance love is what caused the
[35:35] unbeliever it's because you're in love
[35:37] with Christ Rebecca wasn't made to go
[35:40] out with his Eleazar it was her decision
[35:43] there in Genesis when it said and they
[35:44] said we will call the damsel and
[35:46] acquired her mouth and they called
[35:48] Rebecca and said unto her will that go
[35:50] with this man and she said I will go we
[35:52] were down there at that wedding that of
[35:54] my my niece recently
[35:55] and brother Matthew was reading this
[35:57] scripture during the wedding wil thou go
[35:59] with this man he actually he actually
[36:01] read that as as the bride was coming up
[36:03] with are you going to go because it's
[36:05] got to be the bride's decision not based
[36:08] on being forced not by being cajoled
[36:10] into it but because you love you see
[36:13] what the preaching of the Gospel is
[36:14] doing the preaching of the Gospel is to
[36:16] draw you to Christ by love to drop from
[36:19] that head drown down into your heart
[36:20] will you begin to something begins to
[36:22] stir within like brother rounds called
[36:24] it that Paul's sitting down within your
[36:25] soul that you feel God God begin to move
[36:28] it's not the preacher speaking to you
[36:30] anymore but it's God speaking to you
[36:32] it's not the preacher's voice anymore
[36:33] but it's God's voice speaking to you no
[36:36] man could come unto me except the Father
[36:37] John and no man can come except the
[36:40] father is the father is the one that's
[36:42] doing the pulling at your heart the
[36:44] father is the one that's doing the
[36:45] speaking at your heart
[36:48] you see education is somebody education
[36:51] is somebody telling you their story
[36:55] you read the book of Ruth and you read
[36:57] that you read that story and you you can
[36:59] understand it with an intellectual
[37:01] understanding but Revelation is
[37:02] something more than that Revelation is
[37:05] something you live through Revelation is
[37:07] something that you have experienced
[37:09] yourself Revelation is something that
[37:11] you know why you you go to a wedding and
[37:14] you see the bride and the groom standing
[37:16] up there at the platform and nobody else
[37:17] really understands their story except
[37:19] for that couple up there why because
[37:21] they've lived it well that man is up
[37:23] there and he watches his bride come down
[37:24] the aisle he he sees that that girl that
[37:27] he's known for all these all these
[37:29] months or however long come walking
[37:30] toward him he's got all these stories
[37:32] accumulated back behind him and he's
[37:34] looking at her with an understanding
[37:36] that goes past some kind of an
[37:37] intellectual education understanding
[37:39] something that just somebody told him
[37:41] about how he was supposed to act but
[37:42] he's looking at her with Eyes Of Love
[37:44] Love is what we're talking about this
[37:47] afternoon and brothers said the darkest
[37:49] hour then Jesus comes along in that
[37:51] message in 1955 he said he has hid it
[37:53] from the eyes of the wise and prudence
[37:55] and we'll reveal it to babes such as
[37:57] we'll learn
[37:58] is that right he will reveal it to babes
[38:00] you don't have to be smart to understand
[38:02] the Bible what do you have to have you
[38:04] have to have a humble heart it don't
[38:06] take a lot of head learning that's one
[38:08] thing I I I really want to impress this
[38:10] afternoon you begin to as you begin to
[38:13] study the seals and study these great
[38:15] deep Mysteries and it looks like
[38:17] something that's past your educational
[38:19] ability your intellectual ability and
[38:21] you study and study and press your way
[38:23] through it and then finally God begins
[38:25] to drop down and reveal to you the
[38:27] Simplicity of what it is and it's the
[38:30] Simplicity of it the Simplicity of it it
[38:32] goes past the eyes of the wise and The
[38:34] Prudent past their Minds past all the
[38:37] minds of the denominations pass their
[38:39] minds because God reveals himself in
[38:41] Simplicity you all you have to have is
[38:44] an humble heart the Bible is God's love
[38:47] story to his church let's hid from all
[38:49] the scholarships in the world it's only
[38:51] known by one scholarship and that's
[38:53] through neology if you ever had any of
[38:55] it you know what I mean down on your
[38:58] knees
[38:59] you have to read between the lines to
[39:01] make it right
[39:02] he said in Jehovah Jireh he said now
[39:05] reading the Bible it's a love story that
[39:07] God wrote to his church it's God God is
[39:10] love do you believe that
[39:11] and the Bible is written so that the
[39:13] educated and smart can never understand
[39:15] it you have to be in love with God to
[39:18] understand it you have to have God in
[39:21] you he interprets himself to you now
[39:23] it's just like I got a wife oh how I
[39:25] love her I love her with all my heart
[39:27] and I'll be overseas somewhere and
[39:29] she'll after she gets the kitties to
[39:31] sleep she'll write me a letter and say
[39:32] dear Billy I'm sitting here tonight I'm
[39:34] thinking of you I'm writing see I know
[39:36] what she's writing on the paper but I
[39:39] know her and love her so much till I
[39:40] just know her nature I know what she
[39:43] means so I can read between the lines
[39:45] when you know somebody when you the note
[39:47] know the nature of God when you know
[39:50] what he's about and what he wants done
[39:51] with the word then you can read the
[39:53] Bible in the way that it's supposed to
[39:55] be read and God wants his church to read
[39:57] between the lines not read anything out
[40:00] of it now you have to read between the
[40:02] lines to see what it's meaning
[40:04] when you read the between the lines the
[40:06] story of Ruth deciding and Ruth gleaning
[40:08] and Ruth rest it takes on something
[40:10] different because it because now you you
[40:13] have experienced it it's something that
[40:15] you've lived and you've gone through it
[40:17] when you look at David's life it's
[40:19] something that you've gone through
[40:20] laying there in your bed tossing around
[40:22] crying at night asking God to come on
[40:25] the scene for you that you need some
[40:26] help you've lived through that you've
[40:28] lived for those nights when you didn't
[40:29] know how to pray and what to say you've
[40:32] lived through it you've lived through
[40:33] Abraham on his journey you've lived
[40:35] through that and it's something Beyond
[40:37] just had knowledge something to be
[40:39] honest knowing about something I'm
[40:41] talking to you tonight about a love
[40:43] between you and God I love where whether
[40:45] it's a shallow sermon or a deep sermon
[40:47] or deep teaching or a little lightweight
[40:49] message you love it because you love God
[40:51] you're in love with God and you won't
[40:53] heal
[40:55] you read the Bible and you begin to
[40:57] understand what those three stages of
[40:59] your experience are because you can see
[41:01] it unfold you can see it unfold in the
[41:03] seals you can see it unfold in the
[41:05] six-fold purpose of Daniel 70 weeks you
[41:08] can see it unfold in every line every
[41:09] precept of the Bible because it's not
[41:12] something that you understand with your
[41:13] head anymore but it's love a
[41:16] relationship with you and God what you
[41:18] have become to enter into communion with
[41:20] him you've come from Faith to communion
[41:22] Faith to enter into the holy of holies
[41:24] and dwell with him the word is in layers
[41:27] it's in layers that you go from this to
[41:30] this to this so you got to read it like
[41:32] a love letter
[41:34] the whole Bible is a book of love
[41:36] all these love stories in the Bible of
[41:38] how Adam loved Eve so much that he'd go
[41:40] out with her how Isaac loved Rebecca and
[41:43] Rebecca loved Isaac even though she had
[41:45] never seen him before she all she had to
[41:47] go on was that elegation was telling
[41:49] about and she wrote on those camel's
[41:51] back but she when she got off that Camel
[41:53] she knew and when she saw him because
[41:54] she loved him she had fallen in love by
[41:57] what she had heard about what she would
[41:59] have read about in the Bible Jacob and
[42:01] Rachel that loved one another and Boaz
[42:03] and Ruth and Esther and The King The
[42:06] King that loved Esther so much that he
[42:08] load his scepter and said whatever you
[42:10] own I give it to you even to the half of
[42:12] the kingdom and Solomon and the shunami
[42:14] that loved that woman that loved her so
[42:16] much that Christ and his bride you know
[42:19] many times we're scared to talk about
[42:21] love we're scared we think love is a
[42:24] scary thing we don't want to really we
[42:25] want to talk about love too much we
[42:27] think well love is for sissies the world
[42:30] thinks real men love cars and guns and
[42:32] country music and a loose living and we
[42:34] think that's what love is so we don't
[42:35] want to we think we've got to be tough
[42:37] and walk with our palms back and hateful
[42:39] around we would think we got to be throw
[42:40] our shoulders back and be all hateful
[42:42] and stuff you got to be crusty but love
[42:45] brother Robin said that love is the
[42:47] greatest weapon love is the greatest
[42:50] weapon that God ever put in the hands of

[44:11] love that made a man spread his arms on
[44:14] the cross that love is still able to
[44:16] take a cold Stony heart and soften it up
[44:19] love is what draws us to Christ love is
[44:23] how a Christian lives Jesus said in John
[44:26] chapter 12 if I be lifted up from the
[44:28] earth I'll draw draw all men unto me and
[44:31] what does it do in the drawing it's just

[44:35] here to declare to you tonight that God
[44:37] loves you no matter where you are no
[44:39] matter what your condition is God so
[44:42] loved the world that he gave his only
[44:43] begotten son to draw you unto him
[44:47] he's drawing the knife he's pulling

[45:08] you love him or how little you care for
[45:10] him God cares for you he cares about you
[45:13] tonight the Bible says in James 4 8 draw
[45:16] not to God and He will draw nigh to you
[45:20] if you'll come to God he'll come to you
[45:22] Jeremiah 31 says I have loved you with
[45:25] an Everlasting Love Therefore with
[45:27] loving kindness have I drawn these it's
[45:30] Psalm 1065 it says blessed is the man

[45:37] approach to God by his love that's drawn
[45:40] you pulling you to recognize what God
[45:43] has done listen tonight love has drawing
[45:45] power love has got the kind of power
[45:48] that can draw a sinner to him and change
[45:51] their heart and change their life
[45:54] it's the kind of power
[45:56] that could make Ruth make a decision
[45:58] it's the kind of power that can make you
[46:00] make a decision tonight it's the kind of
[46:03] power that can make you arise from your
[46:05] Slumber and realize what God has done
[46:07] for you and verse 16 when Ruth said and
[46:09] treat me not to leave he's talking to
[46:11] Naomi why would she make a statement
[46:14] like that
[46:15] and treat me not to leave thee or to
[46:18] return from following after thee for
[46:21] whether thou goest I will go and where
[46:23] thou largest I will Lodge thy people
[46:26] shall be my people and thy God my God
[46:30] where thou diced will I die and there
[46:32] will I be buried the Lord do so to me
[46:35] and more also if all but death part thee
[46:37] in me when she saw that she was
[46:40] steadfastly minded to go with her then
[46:42] she left speaking unto her Ruth made up
[46:46] her mind what will she do Ruth is a type
[46:48] Ruth is a type of us looking back at
[46:52] these Old Testament scriptures that the
[46:54] Jews had written down looking back at
[46:56] that and oh you think about you think
[46:58] about Paul who had been raised up under
[47:00] gamalia and he knew all about those Old
[47:02] Testament teachings but then he began to
[47:04] understand the love of God you think
[47:07] about it when we when we read the story
[47:09] of Leviticus and read these stories that
[47:11] are written in the Old Testament that
[47:13] the Jews came to us it begins to change
[47:15] our mind and change what does it do it
[47:18] causes us to realize how much God loves
[47:21] us when you realize how much God loves
[47:23] you it'll it'll cause you to make up
[47:25] your mind
[47:27] to make up your mind
[47:29] in Ruth chapter 1 verse 16 and Ruth said
[47:31] and treat me not to leave thee or to
[47:33] return from following after thee for
[47:35] whether thou go a star will go
[47:38] she made up her mind
[47:40] she was standing firm on what she
[47:41] believed to be true why because what
[47:43] made her do that it was her love her
[47:45] love for Naomi her love for the what the
[47:48] god of Israel she was looking at what
[47:50] Naomi believed and she said I'm gonna
[47:52] I'm gonna go after that I made up my
[47:54] mind that I'm not going back to this
[47:55] moabitish way to live but I'm turning my
[47:58] I'm turning the corner I'm going that
[48:00] way I'm standing I'm standing on what
[48:02] you believe and you know the Bible says
[48:04] everything you've got to do you start
[48:05] your journey in faith you start your
[48:08] journey making up your mind not just on
[48:10] some whim but on what you know to be
[48:12] true and Ruth Ruth in her she started
[48:15] her journey in faith and that's how
[48:17] James says ask in faith asking Faith
[48:20] nothing wavering for he that wavereth is
[48:22] like a wave of the sea driven with the
[48:25] wind and tossed everything you do in
[48:27] life is because you made up your mind to
[48:29] believe God Mark chapter 11 23 says have
[48:33] faith in God for verily I say unto you
[48:35] that whosoever shall say unto this
[48:37] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[48:38] cast into the sea and Shout Out doubt in
[48:41] his heart but shall believe that those
[48:42] things which he saith shall come to pass
[48:44] he shall have whatsoever he saith why
[48:47] because it started out when you make it
[48:49] up your mind I'm believing in God I'm
[48:51] believing that this mountain needs to be
[48:53] moved out of his place I'm believing and
[48:55] I'm speaking because of of my love for
[48:58] God I know that he loves me I know that
[49:00] I believe his word
[49:03] you what could we do tonight church if
[49:06] our minds were made up that our minds
[49:09] were made up that we weren't going to
[49:10] dilly dally with this gospel anymore
[49:11] that our minds were made up that we were
[49:13] going to get our lives straightened up
[49:15] that our minds were made up that we were
[49:17] going to give to give our whole our
[49:18] whole body Soul and Spirit to God her
[49:22] mind was made up because she was
[49:24] convinced to the god of Israel every
[49:26] believer's Journey Begins with faith in
[49:28] God
[49:29] what was she doing she was deciding
[49:33] she made a decision that I want his
[49:35] Banner Over me who the god of Israel I
[49:38] want the god of Israel's Banner Over Me
[49:39] I want to be under his protection I want
[49:42] to be in fellowship with him he's the
[49:44] one that I want if you want me if you
[49:45] make up your mind tonight that I'm going
[49:47] to get the baptism the Holy Ghost
[49:49] because there's a promise laying in here
[49:50] that I can read in Exodus in Ezekiel 36
[49:54] and Jeremiah I can read all these things
[49:56] In Those Old Testament scriptures that
[49:58] they owe me speaking of I can read those
[50:00] I believe that God laid that promise out
[50:03] for me if you could become convinced
[50:05] that it's there waiting for you she was
[50:07] deciding that I'll never have rest until
[50:10] I have him who the god of Israel she
[50:13] wanted she wanted the god of Israel
[50:15] that's why she made up her mind that she
[50:17] was going after God are you convinced
[50:19] are you convinced this afternoon that
[50:21] Christ loves you are you convinced that
[50:23] God is calling you he's still making the
[50:26] wedding call
[50:29] the story that Jesus told about how he
[50:31] sent them out into the hedges and the
[50:33] byways and the going out to to make that
[50:36] wedding call that to come all things are
[50:38] ready and I will declare you tonight
[50:40] that there's still room at the wedding
[50:41] Feast God is still drawing the sinner's
[50:44] heart there's still some seats available
[50:46] there's still room at the wedding supper
[50:49] and Jesus said in Matthew chapter 11
[50:51] come unto me all you that labor and are
[50:53] heavy laden and I will give you rest in
[50:55] Revelation 19 it says blessed are they
[50:57] which are called unto the marriage
[50:59] sipper of the Lamb a wedding a marriage
[51:02] is based on love and you can't go to
[51:05] this wedding without love when brother
[51:07] Brown went across the curtain of time
[51:09] they said you can't come here without
[51:10] perfect love you got to have love to go
[51:13] there you got to have agape love the
[51:16] kind of love that can love the unlovable
[51:18] the kind of love that can love somebody
[51:20] that looks like the whole church is
[51:22] abandoned it looks like the whole
[51:24] religious realm has given up on you
[51:26] gotta have that kind of a love you got
[51:28] to have a love that when your spouse
[51:30] yells at you and screams at you you love
[51:32] them back you got to have love that when
[51:34] people in church say things that you
[51:35] don't you don't think need to be said
[51:37] you still love them because there's
[51:39] agape love and we're all part of one
[51:41] body and you love love is what I'm
[51:43] talking about and gleaning is what I'm
[51:46] gleaning to Ruth became a labor of love
[51:48] and Ruth chapter 2
[51:50] and Naomi had a Kinsman of her husband's
[51:53] a mighty man of wealth of the family of
[51:55] elimelech and his name was Boaz and Ruth
[51:57] the more about it said unto Naomi Let Me
[51:59] Now go to the field and glean ears of
[52:01] corn after him and whose side I shall
[52:03] find Grace and she said unto her go my
[52:05] daughter and she went and came and
[52:07] gleaned in the field after the Reapers
[52:09] and her hat was to light on a part of
[52:11] the field belonging on the Boaz who was
[52:13] of the Kindred of elimelech and behold
[52:15] Boaz came from Bethlehem Bethlehem and
[52:18] said unto the Reapers the Lord be with
[52:19] you and they answered in the Lord
[52:21] blessed thee then said Boaz unto his
[52:23] servant that will set over the Reapers
[52:24] whose damsel is this and we know the
[52:26] rest of the story he told he told her
[52:27] you don't you stay put you just keep
[52:30] reaping in this field don't go anywhere
[52:33] else you ain't got to go to no
[52:34] denomination to find out what their true
[52:36] message of the hour is you don't need to
[52:38] go to any other Oddball message churches
[52:41] that are that are teaching that you got
[52:42] to follow a man or all these different
[52:44] kind of things follow their their
[52:47] all you just stay right here in this
[52:49] field stay put in this field and that
[52:52] became a labor of Ruth was happy to
[52:55] labor she didn't mind she didn't mind to
[52:57] be seen in boaz's field she didn't mind
[53:00] for somebody to see the way that she
[53:01] dressed and the way that she acted and
[53:03] the church that she went to she didn't
[53:04] mind because it was love she was doing
[53:06] it because of love she was steadfast she
[53:10] had a goal in mind she was there with a
[53:13] purpose
[53:14] oh once you get once you get started on
[53:16] your journey it's time to get to
[53:17] climbing time to get to glean and time
[53:20] to get to work and you don't mind
[53:21] working in the field you don't mind
[53:23] gleaning a little bit you don't mind it
[53:25] coming piece by piece here a little
[53:27] there little you don't mind going home
[53:30] and crying like I know some of y'all
[53:32] have done when Daniel 70 weeks is
[53:33] preaching hard hard messages are
[53:35] preached because you don't understand it
[53:37] it comes a little bit over here a little
[53:39] bit over there and piece by piece you
[53:42] don't mind because it's a labor love you
[53:45] won't just throw in the towel and quit
[53:47] and go somewhere else because you don't
[53:48] understand it all at once but it's a
[53:50] labor of love brother I said in the
[53:53] message job he said Boaz was
[53:54] representative of Christ for he was the
[53:56] lord of the Harvest he was over all the
[53:59] Harvest and notice as soon as he looked
[54:01] out in the field and saw that Gentile
[54:03] girl he fell in love with her why she
[54:05] was gleaning behind the Reapers that's
[54:08] what the church has to do pick up a
[54:10] little bit here and a little bit there
[54:11] Glenn that's what that'll make Christ
[54:13] fall in love with you two when he sees
[54:15] you oh God I need I want to understand
[54:17] this that'll make God realize there's
[54:20] something special about you
[54:22] reading over there and seeing what job
[54:25] had done and what the rest of them done
[54:26] and how the way of redemption was laid
[54:28] picking up these little gleanings behind
[54:30] the Jewish Church see what I mean that
[54:33] grain that they were reaping represented
[54:35] in life Immortal life eternal life to us
[54:38] out of the word the word of God man
[54:41] shall not live by bread alone but by
[54:43] every word that proceedeth out of the
[54:45] mouth of God oh you realize what that
[54:47] means is that if you don't mind gleaning
[54:50] you don't you don't mind you don't mind
[54:52] maybe sometimes a little starchy service
[54:54] you don't mind some heavy teaching
[54:56] because you love God you're there to get
[54:59] something you're there to get something
[55:00] from God and you love the word you love
[55:02] it as much as Ruth did when she was out
[55:04] there laboring in that field all hunched
[55:06] over maybe her back was hurting it
[55:08] hunched over in that field working
[55:10] because she every little bit of handful
[55:12] that she could grab meant something to
[55:14] her this is something that's going to
[55:16] help me this is something that's going
[55:17] to feed me this means something to me
[55:20] how old does it mean something to you
[55:22] tonight so you love the sheaves big or
[55:25] small teaching her Evangelistic it don't
[55:27] matter or an evangelist comes through he
[55:29] loved that but when teaching comes
[55:31] through it we'd rather have a different
[55:32] kind of cheese but it's all the word
[55:34] Paul said I plan Apollo's Waters but
[55:37] it's all the word you got to have the
[55:38] planning and you got to have the water
[55:40] and you need it all but you love it
[55:42] because you're in love with Christ you
[55:44] love it because you're not in love with
[55:45] the minister you're not in love with one
[55:47] another but you're loved with Christ you
[55:50] love it because if you were meant for
[55:53] the lord of the Harvest you love the
[55:54] Harvest if you were meant like Ruth for
[55:57] Boaz then you love the grain you love
[55:59] the wheat you love it because you love
[56:01] what he loves oh you love to gather you
[56:05] love to work you love to labor because
[56:07] why you've got to have that wedding ring
[56:11] the wedding ring is the goal you've got
[56:14] to have that ring Above All Else you've
[56:16] got to have that token nothing else
[56:18] matters to you but that token you've got
[56:20] to have that full Redemption nothing
[56:22] else matters to you but full Redemption
[56:24] nothing else matters to you but that
[56:26] body changed nothing else matters to you
[56:28] but the Holy Ghost Nothing Else Matters
[56:31] to a real believer because you're in
[56:33] love with Christ
[56:34] oh I I pray that tonight there's
[56:37] something you'll stir up within your
[56:39] heart maybe when you go home tonight
[56:40] when you get back on that road you
[56:42] you'll think I I got to get along with
[56:44] God I got to get a loan back in that
[56:48] Holy Place why cause you love God if if
[56:51] you're if that love has grown cold if
[56:54] it's wax cold and you oh tonight is the
[56:56] night just Stir It Up again tonight is
[56:58] the night when you go home get down
[57:00] beside your bed and say God rekindle
[57:03] something in me I want the fire of God
[57:05] that that love that I once had for you I
[57:07] want it to grow I wanted to be rekindled
[57:10] In Me In Me
[57:12] oh you gotta you gotta work you gotta
[57:14] labor in that field because what we're
[57:16] climbing to that token climbing to the
[57:18] proof what is the token the proof that
[57:20] you will not go through the tribulation
[57:22] why because you got that wedding ring on
[57:24] your hand is it proof that you ain't
[57:26] going through the tribulation you got
[57:28] the ring on your finger and that's what
[57:30] Ruth was laboring for and the token
[57:33] brother Adam said the blood of Jesus
[57:34] Christ has cleansed us from all sin and
[57:37] there is no more purifying and the blood
[57:39] of Jesus Christ in that token as
[57:42] identification that has been purified
[57:44] amen that's the token of the Bride
[57:47] wearing the ring
[57:49] why are you laboring why are you labor
[57:52] tonight why did you come to church
[57:54] why are you a Christian it's because you
[57:57] love him
[57:58] because you love him
[58:01] how do I get closer to God than I how do
[58:03] I get closer you read the love letter
[58:06] how do I get closer to God throw open
[58:08] every door to your heart
[58:10] every door that's what brother all those
[58:12] sermons that he preached the door to the
[58:13] heart the door to the heart the door of
[58:16] the door doors and door the door inside
[58:18] the door all those doors that we keep
[58:20] shutting we just open them up to him and
[58:22] let him come in why how are you going to
[58:23] open it up outside of love it's because
[58:25] you love Christ not because somebody
[58:28] told you to not because you read it with
[58:30] the intellectual idea and said well I
[58:32] should do it but because you love Christ
[58:34] if you lacked love then the real
[58:37] Christianity cannot be expressed it's by
[58:40] love not by hid knowledge love is more
[58:43] than just the fundamental understanding
[58:45] love is when the door is open and Jesus
[58:49] said in Revelation chapter 3 he said it
[58:51] was Christ that said these words he said
[58:52] behold I stand at the door and knock If
[58:55] any man hear my voice and open the door
[58:57] I will come to him and will sup with him
[58:59] and he with me it's Christ that's doing
[59:01] the knocking it's Christ that's doing
[59:03] the drawing Christ you think about this
[59:05] tonight now Christ God wants to sup with
[59:08] you he wants to sit down with you and to
[59:10] have a personal relationship with you
[59:12] over what you're reading in this word he
[59:15] wants to fellowship with you oh we've
[59:17] been studying on Melchizedek and all
[59:18] these old uh all these things that we
[59:20] can read in the Old Testament but what
[59:22] was Melchizedek come he comes serving
[59:24] communion to Abraham God wants to sit
[59:27] down with you and have communion with
[59:28] you communion over over his his word and
[59:32] over his Spirit he wants to have a
[59:34] relationship with you so just love God
[59:37] just love God tonight brother Brian said
[59:40] just love him with all your heart and
[59:42] forget all you ever knowed about all
[59:43] other things but Jesus Christ just go
[59:46] ahead and love him and work for him
[59:48] serve him now you think about what love
[59:50] does
[59:51] love does not care about your feelings
[59:54] or your emotions or how you are treated
[59:57] because he said if he wants you to be
[1:00:00] the doormat you just be the doormat if
[1:00:03] God wants you to be the doormat and you
[1:00:05] really love God you're willing to be the
[1:00:08] doormat you're willing to let everybody
[1:00:10] in church line up and walk all over you
[1:00:13] if you love God the right way that's
[1:00:16] agape love it's whatever he wants you to
[1:00:20] do you do it and I always remember this
[1:00:24] friends the Way Up Is Down he that
[1:00:27] exhausts himself shall be abased but he
[1:00:29] that humbled himself shall be exalted oh
[1:00:32] here's a good one that first in First
[1:00:34] Corinthians Paul said in chapter 8 he
[1:00:36] said If any man think that he knoweth
[1:00:37] anything he knoweth and nothing yet as
[1:00:39] he ought to know if you think you know
[1:00:41] in your mind a lot of things you don't
[1:00:43] know the way that you ought to know yet
[1:00:46] but if any man love God
[1:00:48] the same is known of him
[1:00:51] if you love God from your heart
[1:00:54] then that's going to be on display on
[1:00:57] display and everybody's going to see
[1:00:59] that you love God
[1:01:01] If any man love God the same is known of
[1:01:03] him if you love him oh you think about
[1:01:06] love do not do it do you mean when you
[1:01:08] talk about love do you mean when you're
[1:01:10] talking about Ruth they're gleaning
[1:01:12] those sheaves do you mean that I got to
[1:01:13] humble myself that I got to bow down and
[1:01:16] pick up sheaves that I got to display
[1:01:19] character that I got to display a humble
[1:01:22] life love will do it in Colossians
[1:01:25] chapter 3 he said put on therefore as
[1:01:27] the elect of God holy and beloved bowels
[1:01:30] of mercies there's love right there
[1:01:32] kindness humbleness of mine meekness
[1:01:37] long-suffering forbearing one another
[1:01:40] and forgiving one another you can't
[1:01:42] forgive if you don't have love you can't
[1:01:46] forbear if you don't have love If any
[1:01:48] man have a quarrel against any even as
[1:01:51] Christ forgave you so also do ye now I
[1:01:56] don't have this in my notes but if you
[1:01:57] want to study out what forgiveness is
[1:01:59] you cannot have faith without
[1:02:00] forgiveness because Christ said you
[1:02:02] forgive and then you will be forgiven so
[1:02:05] you can't come you can't even come to
[1:02:06] Christ unless you first forgive that's
[1:02:08] in the Lord's Prayer he said oh you run
[1:02:10] down through the Lord's Prayer and he
[1:02:12] says forgive those who do who do things
[1:02:13] wrong to you so that you the the things
[1:02:15] that you've done wrong against God will
[1:02:17] be forgiven you see what's what's that
[1:02:19] doing is expressing love because love
[1:02:22] love is the greatest Force there is the
[1:02:24] greatest weapon and without love you
[1:02:27] cannot forgive you cannot forbear you
[1:02:29] cannot have patience with one another
[1:02:31] you can't do those things without love
[1:02:33] love is through that's why it's up there
[1:02:35] at the top I'm talking you're going to
[1:02:37] have perfect love when you're born are
[1:02:38] you going to have that perfect love in
[1:02:40] your soul when you're born again but
[1:02:41] love at the top is when it's expressed
[1:02:44] in completeness and perfectness where
[1:02:46] you begin to deal with with one another
[1:02:49] in a way that's different than you could
[1:02:51] when you were just born again why
[1:02:53] because you're you're able to put
[1:02:55] yourself in their shoes you're able to
[1:02:57] empathize with that other person you're
[1:03:00] able to feel for that lost soul in a way
[1:03:02] that's different than when you were just
[1:03:04] born again love is what wins today love
[1:03:07] is what will speak squirrels into
[1:03:08] existence love is what a move a mountain
[1:03:11] love is what will change everything so
[1:03:14] stay put
[1:03:15] is what Boaz told Ruth
[1:03:17] here she was gleaning behind picking up
[1:03:19] these little gleans and the lord of the
[1:03:22] Harvest fell in love with her being an
[1:03:24] alien
[1:03:25] what a picture
[1:03:27] my I just love that and then he said
[1:03:29] whose damsel is this and they began to
[1:03:31] speak and said it's the moabite that
[1:03:33] come in with Naomi and it went out to
[1:03:35] her and spoke to her and said don't you
[1:03:37] leave this field
[1:03:39] God be merciful
[1:03:41] stay put
[1:03:43] don't be tossed about with every wind of
[1:03:46] Doctrine stay
[1:03:48] in the word
[1:03:50] you're going to stay there if you love
[1:03:52] God why
[1:03:53] because the lord of the Harvest Boaz is
[1:03:56] worth all the labors
[1:03:57] Boaz fell in love with her and Ruth fell
[1:04:00] in love with him
[1:04:01] she began to realize
[1:04:04] like we but
[1:04:05] he's worth he's worth everything Christ
[1:04:08] is worth everything he's worth taking up
[1:04:11] the cross he's worth all the struggles
[1:04:14] he's worth all the gossip and stuff you
[1:04:17] have to endure he's worth all the
[1:04:20] trouble that the devil can raise up and
[1:04:21] stir up he's worth enduring everything
[1:04:24] every fiery daughter of the wicked one
[1:04:27] that the devil can throw at you Christ
[1:04:29] is worth it all Boaz was worth it all to
[1:04:32] Ruth Christ is worth it all to a
[1:04:34] Believer he's worth enduring all the
[1:04:36] hardships love is what takes you to the
[1:04:39] Finish Line love is what takes you to
[1:04:41] the Token he let her glean in the field
[1:04:43] because he loved her and she was willing
[1:04:45] to work until the matter was settled
[1:04:47] because she loved him it was love when
[1:04:51] you love God it don't matter if they
[1:04:52] laugh at you like they laughed at David
[1:04:54] right
[1:04:55] you say that's another thing that
[1:04:57] happens when you start reading between
[1:04:58] the lines
[1:04:59] you start reading these stories
[1:05:01] different
[1:05:02] it don't matter if everybody in the
[1:05:04] church puts you down it don't matter if
[1:05:06] they say
[1:05:07] you you were the last person I would
[1:05:09] have picked for that job
[1:05:12] it don't matter if they mock you like
[1:05:15] the woman that washed Jesus's feet
[1:05:17] it don't matter if they call you a
[1:05:19] secret sinner when you've done nothing
[1:05:21] wrong like job
[1:05:22] oh come on now we can read these stories
[1:05:25] differently when you've experienced
[1:05:26] something when you lived it then it
[1:05:28] becomes something more when it becomes
[1:05:30] greater love is there for the Long Haul
[1:05:33] oh you think about so many that have
[1:05:35] come come in and went out and come in
[1:05:37] but but you didn't did you you stayed
[1:05:40] there you stay why'd you do it because
[1:05:41] you love God why are you here tonight
[1:05:44] not because you love you love the
[1:05:46] building but because you love God
[1:05:49] love ever looks false
[1:05:52] all love overlooked all the they said he
[1:05:55] didn't have no beauty that anybody would
[1:05:57] desire him but love overlooks all that
[1:05:59] amen oh when he said those harsh words
[1:06:02] to Peter and and begin to say except you
[1:06:05] eat my flesh and drink my blood they
[1:06:07] look past all the things they couldn't
[1:06:08] understand because they loved him loved
[1:06:10] and the whole grudges love doesn't have
[1:06:13] a ledger book oh if we could just get
[1:06:14] rid of our Legend books tonight oh
[1:06:17] tonight I wish of you we every one of us
[1:06:18] could lay our Ledger books on the Altar
[1:06:21] and just leave them here at church if we
[1:06:23] could have that kind of a love for one
[1:06:24] another well we're not keeping a record
[1:06:26] of the Deeds we do to one another leave
[1:06:28] that ledger book and let's burn it on
[1:06:30] the altar you burn it with all your sins
[1:06:32] burn it with that throw it in that sea
[1:06:34] you're forgiveness I don't I don't want
[1:06:36] to ever look at that ledger book again
[1:06:38] that's what love will do you can look at
[1:06:41] somebody different without looking
[1:06:42] through your Ledger book first that's
[1:06:45] love love looks to the end
[1:06:48] Jesus said oh let's not forget the
[1:06:50] Forgotten beatitude blessed is he who is
[1:06:53] not offended in me blessed is he who is
[1:06:55] not offended in the bumps along the way
[1:06:59] in Matthew chapter 11 when Jesus was
[1:07:02] when tell them tell him what to tell to
[1:07:03] John he said
[1:07:05] blind received their sight and the lame
[1:07:08] walk the lepers are cleansed and the
[1:07:10] deaf ear the dead are raised up and the
[1:07:13] poor have the gospel preached to them
[1:07:14] and blessed is he whosoever shall not be
[1:07:17] offended in me oh you see if the blind
[1:07:20] are receiving their side of the lame are
[1:07:22] walking what does it matter if there's a
[1:07:24] little offense or a little bump on the
[1:07:25] road if if somebody's getting delivered
[1:07:28] of cancer I don't care about the little
[1:07:30] petty things why because we're here to
[1:07:32] love Christ
[1:07:34] oh if you see God come down in the power
[1:07:37] and glory and manifestes manifest his
[1:07:40] deity and the church it don't matter all
[1:07:42] the stuff that the devil does
[1:07:44] oh as long as the preacher Don't Preach
[1:07:46] on me you might say oh as long as I
[1:07:48] don't know the preacher's past life oh
[1:07:50] that's another thing sometimes we don't
[1:07:52] want to we don't want to hear a preacher
[1:07:54] that's got a past
[1:07:55] I I'm so sick of that
[1:07:57] I'm so sick of people it seems like
[1:08:00] everywhere I turn there's somebody
[1:08:01] saying well I I I I was with that
[1:08:04] preacher when he was smoking pot out in
[1:08:06] the world I was with that preacher when
[1:08:07] he wasn't living right so now I don't
[1:08:09] want to have nothing to do with it
[1:08:10] listen God can take somebody's life and
[1:08:13] change him if God if God can change
[1:08:15] somebody's life I'd rather be about
[1:08:17] around to change life
[1:08:22] oh we got all this list of stuff that we
[1:08:24] don't want to put up with but I I want
[1:08:27] to say tonight I'm willing to put up
[1:08:28] with all an awful lot if I can see
[1:08:30] Christ manifested in my members I'm
[1:08:33] willing to put up with an awful lot if I
[1:08:35] can get to the end of the journey
[1:08:37] oh as long as I don't have to put up
[1:08:39] with personalities you might say but
[1:08:41] you're never going to get away from
[1:08:42] personalities as long as you come to
[1:08:44] church I got a personality that I'm
[1:08:46] expressing when I'm preaching every
[1:08:48] Minister here has got a personality that
[1:08:49] they're expressing when they preach and
[1:08:51] when you go out in the parking lot
[1:08:52] you're going to have personalities
[1:08:53] you're never going to get away with from
[1:08:55] it but but that God has given a power
[1:08:58] and ability in the church to put for us
[1:09:00] to put up with one another the love of
[1:09:02] Christ manifesting Our members
[1:09:06] if the blind receive their sight in the
[1:09:08] lame walk there ain't nothing worth
[1:09:10] being offended over it's if God is here
[1:09:12] if God is here in reality and I believe
[1:09:15] in years I believe I believe it I can
[1:09:18] feel it right now I believe I know that
[1:09:20] he's here in this building right now
[1:09:22] he's still drawing and he's still
[1:09:24] calling and he's still willing to change
[1:09:26] lives and everything is worth it for him
[1:09:30] oh Peter took it you think about all the
[1:09:32] ones in the Bible that took things took
[1:09:35] things that I wondered tonight if we
[1:09:36] could take if we could take if we were
[1:09:38] living back there Peter took it when
[1:09:40] Jesus looked at him in the face and said
[1:09:42] get thee behind him Satan I wonder if we
[1:09:44] could take it if somebody was to call us
[1:09:47] the devil could you take that if
[1:09:49] somebody called you the devil Peter took
[1:09:51] it when Jesus told him what's that to
[1:09:53] thee what do you care if John lives
[1:09:56] until until I come again what do you
[1:09:58] care oh that would seem like a harsh
[1:10:01] thing for Jesus to say what is that to
[1:10:03] thee but Peter took it why because he
[1:10:05] knew he was in love with Christ he was
[1:10:09] looking past the flesh daddy that there
[1:10:11] was deity back there behind that flesh
[1:10:13] deity was tabernacled in that man and he
[1:10:16] wanted what he had oh the Greek woman
[1:10:19] had to endure something when Jesus came
[1:10:21] and told her she was a dog then the
[1:10:24] Greek woman had to endure it I wonder
[1:10:25] tonight if we're willing to endure if
[1:10:28] somebody would were set where where to
[1:10:30] say something harsh like that to us
[1:10:33] oh let me say something to you tonight
[1:10:35] Church nobody got anywhere and anything
[1:10:38] natural or spiritual without
[1:10:40] perseverance
[1:10:43] oh my problem is
[1:10:48] our problem sometimes is we don't see
[1:10:50] the value of what we're doing here we
[1:10:52] don't see the value that that we're
[1:10:54] sitting in this church because it goes
[1:10:56] beyond just the pews and the the wooden
[1:10:59] Pulpit that we're looking at here but
[1:11:00] we're we're here after eternal life
[1:11:03] eternal life is what we're after I want
[1:11:06] to make a challenge to you tonight do
[1:11:07] you love God do you love God to a point
[1:11:10] where it doesn't matter it doesn't
[1:11:12] matter what somebody says it doesn't
[1:11:14] matter if they don't shake my hand if it
[1:11:16] doesn't matter if they don't go out to
[1:11:18] eat with me it doesn't matter because I
[1:11:20] won't Crush I'm willing to lay down
[1:11:23] everything on the altar I'm willing to
[1:11:24] come up to the Altar and be made a
[1:11:26] laughing stock my like all so many
[1:11:29] examples in the Bible because God loves
[1:11:32] me and I love him
[1:11:35] if God loves you he's going to try he's
[1:11:38] going to chasing you he's going to
[1:11:39] Scourge you he's going to give you a
[1:11:41] little challenge just see see how much
[1:11:43] you love him oh how many examples do we
[1:11:46] have of people that that oh they come
[1:11:48] around for a little while and as soon as
[1:11:50] some little something something sad
[1:11:52] wrong a preacher just don't say it quite
[1:11:54] right quiet the way that they feel like
[1:11:56] it should be said and they're out the
[1:11:58] door they go
[1:12:00] could we could we tie that back to
[1:12:02] they're really not interested in what
[1:12:04] the Seven Seals are they're really not
[1:12:07] interested in the revelation of Jesus
[1:12:09] Christ what they really are interested
[1:12:11] in is a club they're really interested
[1:12:13] in a place where where they can come to
[1:12:15] get some hot coffee in the basement but
[1:12:18] what they're really interested in is not
[1:12:20] Christ I'm talking about falling in love
[1:12:23] with Christ tonight and sure we're
[1:12:25] supposed to display the love of Christ
[1:12:27] because the love is what draws you but
[1:12:29] if you're really in love with cross
[1:12:30] tonight it don't matter it doesn't
[1:12:33] matter
[1:12:33] it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if
[1:12:36] Kane takes a stone in his hand it
[1:12:38] doesn't matter if she may begins to
[1:12:40] curse you like he did David it doesn't
[1:12:42] matter if they begin to throw stones and
[1:12:44] smite you in the face like they did
[1:12:46] Jesus and so many others in the Bible it
[1:12:48] don't matter because you're in love with
[1:12:50] Christ
[1:12:52] Hebrews chapter 12 says for whom the
[1:12:54] Lord loveth
[1:12:56] whom the Lord loves he's chasing us and
[1:12:59] Scourge us every son whom he receiveth
[1:13:02] if you endure chasing and God dealeth
[1:13:04] with you as Sons for what son is he whom
[1:13:07] the father chasteneth not but if you be
[1:13:09] without chastisement
[1:13:11] we're of all our partakers every one of
[1:13:14] us are partakers well you see sometimes
[1:13:17] we think well that Minister up there
[1:13:18] behind the pulpit hadn't endured it like
[1:13:20] I have but you don't know the life I
[1:13:22] live you don't know the life these other
[1:13:24] brothers live you don't know where we've
[1:13:26] come from we've all we all have to
[1:13:30] endure chastisement all upper takers and
[1:13:33] if you can't endure it then are you
[1:13:35] bastards and not Sons
[1:13:38] because a bastard don't know where he
[1:13:40] come from and he doesn't love his father
[1:13:43] because he don't he where's who's his
[1:13:45] father
[1:13:46] a bastard doesn't know his father herein
[1:13:50] has now set forth the love of God
[1:13:51] brother Brown said in the Leon I see in
[1:13:53] church shade he desired in love a family
[1:13:55] of his own a family of Sons Sons like
[1:13:58] himself there before him lies all
[1:14:01] mankind is one lump of clay out of that
[1:14:04] same lump he will now make vessels unto
[1:14:07] honor and unto dishonor the choosing
[1:14:09] will be his own choosing
[1:14:11] then those chosen ones born of his
[1:14:13] spirit will be trained to conform to His
[1:14:15] Image in their walk he reproves with all
[1:14:18] long-suffering and gentleness and mercy
[1:14:21] he chastens with nail scarred hands
[1:14:24] sometimes this Potter must take the
[1:14:26] vessel he is working on and thoroughly
[1:14:29] break it down in order that he may
[1:14:31] rebuild it exactly as he desires it but
[1:14:33] it is love
[1:14:35] that is his love
[1:14:37] another way of his love there is not
[1:14:40] there cannot be
[1:14:43] are you able to endure the chastening
[1:14:45] knife
[1:14:47] you know if you can look past the chase
[1:14:49] thing sometimes and realize that it's
[1:14:51] coming from Love
[1:14:52] if you can look past the hard preaching
[1:14:54] sometimes and realize it's coming from
[1:14:56] love the reason sometimes we fail to see
[1:14:59] the loves because we don't know what
[1:15:00] love is
[1:15:02] Love sometimes has to chasten Love
[1:15:05] sometimes has to speak harshly love will
[1:15:07] speak harshly to get that kid out of the
[1:15:09] road or get them to the altar
[1:15:12] sometimes love has to strike hard
[1:15:15] but remember the end
[1:15:17] remember the end that Ruth was looking
[1:15:19] to she wanted that wedding ring Christ
[1:15:21] is all that matters that's why in
[1:15:24] Hebrews chapter 13 it says remember them
[1:15:26] once you have the rule over you who have
[1:15:27] spoken unto you the word of God whose
[1:15:29] Faith follow considering the end of
[1:15:32] their conversation well I don't like
[1:15:34] that brother that much but what's the
[1:15:35] end of their conversation the end of
[1:15:38] their conversation is Jesus Christ is
[1:15:40] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:15:43] Jesus Christ is still the same that's
[1:15:45] the end the end of the conversation is
[1:15:47] Christ and that's what we're trying to
[1:15:49] get you tonight to tonight
[1:15:51] and First Corinthians Paul said know ye
[1:15:53] not that they which run in a race run
[1:15:55] all but one receiveth the prize
[1:15:58] so run that you may obtain
[1:16:01] run it to win the race
[1:16:06] I was watching my brother the other the
[1:16:09] other day he was in an ultra marathon
[1:16:11] I think a marathon is 26 miles and he
[1:16:13] ran 48 miles up to the top of Mount
[1:16:16] Mitchell in North Carolina and I went up
[1:16:18] to several mountains I don't know how he
[1:16:20] did it but you could see on the uh on
[1:16:22] the on the on the roster there you can
[1:16:24] watch it online of who was dropping out
[1:16:27] and where everybody was and where they
[1:16:29] were lagging behind and and and you
[1:16:31] watch him come through the finish line
[1:16:33] and I said you don't get a prize if you
[1:16:35] don't end the race you don't get a prize
[1:16:38] if you glean a little while in the field
[1:16:40] and then you give up you don't get the
[1:16:41] prize you you it's crossing the Finish
[1:16:44] Line when you get the prize see we're
[1:16:46] not we're not in a race to see how how
[1:16:48] how how much we can boast about our
[1:16:50] feelings being hurt but we're here to
[1:16:52] get to cross that Finish Line oh you see
[1:16:58] foreign
[1:17:01] you know how many of us could run 48
[1:17:04] miles but my brother was was dead last
[1:17:06] he was the last one and it took him from
[1:17:09] 3 A.M in the morning until I think about
[1:17:11] uh 10 o'clock at night to finish that
[1:17:14] race but he finished
[1:17:17] he finished now
[1:17:21] now I'm not saying I I'm bragging on him
[1:17:24] a little bit but that's not my point I'm
[1:17:25] not saying this to brag on my brother
[1:17:27] I'm saying it to make a point you might
[1:17:29] feel like you're dead last in the race
[1:17:31] but just cross the line don't give up
[1:17:33] don't give up because
[1:17:36] we want you to we want you to be so in
[1:17:38] love that's that's my goal to get you to
[1:17:40] fall so much in love not with me not
[1:17:43] with the church but with Christ to fall
[1:17:46] so much in love with Christ that you're
[1:17:47] willing to endure whatever if you love
[1:17:49] The gleanings the lord of the Harvest
[1:17:51] loves you and if you love the lord of
[1:17:53] the Harvest you're going to love the
[1:17:55] gleanings
[1:17:56] so Boaz said don't don't go out to any
[1:17:59] other field but stay with that word stay
[1:18:01] with Christ he's wooing you
[1:18:03] even in Hebrews chapter 4 it says let us
[1:18:06] labor there to enter into that rest let
[1:18:08] us labor stay in that field that to get
[1:18:12] to that Holy Ghost rest
[1:18:14] and Ruth chapter three as we keep
[1:18:16] reading only we're we're closing in on
[1:18:18] the finish line here tonight
[1:18:21] when Boaz had eaten and drunk and his
[1:18:23] heart was married he went to lie down at
[1:18:25] the end of the Heap of corn and she came
[1:18:27] softly and uncovered his feet and laid
[1:18:28] her down
[1:18:29] and it came to pass at midnight that the
[1:18:31] man was afraid and turned himself and
[1:18:33] behold a woman lay at his feet
[1:18:36] and he said who art thou
[1:18:38] and she answered I'm Ruth I'm handmade
[1:18:40] spread therefore thy skirt over thine
[1:18:42] handmaid
[1:18:43] for thou art and near Kinsmen
[1:18:45] and he said blessed be thou the Lord my
[1:18:48] daughter for thou has shown more
[1:18:49] kindness in the latter end than at the
[1:18:51] beginning and as much as thou follows
[1:18:53] not young men whether poor or Rich
[1:18:56] there was a lot of distractions maybe a
[1:18:58] lot of things that I caught her eye but
[1:19:00] she stated right with Christ right with
[1:19:03] Boaz
[1:19:04] now my daughter fear not I will do to
[1:19:06] thee all that thou requires for all the
[1:19:09] city of my peoples just know that thou
[1:19:11] art a virtuous woman and now it is true
[1:19:14] that I am not near Kinsmen how be it
[1:19:16] there is a Kinsman nearer then I tear
[1:19:18] this night and it shall be in the
[1:19:19] morning that if he will perform under
[1:19:21] the part of a Kinsman well let him do
[1:19:23] the kinsmen's part but if he will not do
[1:19:25] the part of a Kinsmen to thee then I
[1:19:27] will do the part of the Kinsmen to thee
[1:19:29] as the Lord liveth and he said lie down
[1:19:34] until the morning
[1:19:35] lie down why because now she'd been
[1:19:37] laboring all this time but she laid down
[1:19:39] at his feet and they put his skirt over
[1:19:41] her just like Christ covered you over
[1:19:43] took care of all your problems with the
[1:19:44] Holy Ghost he covered you with the Holy
[1:19:46] Ghost
[1:19:47] and when Christ covers you with the Holy
[1:19:49] Ghost it's time for you to stop doing
[1:19:51] your work and for him to go to work
[1:19:53] now Christ would cry when both house got
[1:19:56] up and he he stood after all that time
[1:19:58] of Ruth labor and now Boaz went to work
[1:20:00] I believe boeth now the bride is rested
[1:20:04] in Christ is at work Christ is at work
[1:20:06] when Boaz was at work Ruth didn't have
[1:20:09] to be
[1:20:10] and when Jesus is at work you don't have
[1:20:12] to be you don't have to be manufacturing
[1:20:13] you don't have to be putting on
[1:20:15] Jesus said have faith in God because
[1:20:17] he's the one that's doing it he's the
[1:20:19] one that's working he's the one that's
[1:20:21] interpreting he's the one that's proven
[1:20:23] tonight he's the one that's that's doing
[1:20:25] it he's the one that's working out his
[1:20:27] will he's the one that's interpreting
[1:20:29] his word Boaz was a type of Christ and
[1:20:32] Christ is here working in the church
[1:20:33] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:20:36] and forever so Boaz took Ruth and she
[1:20:39] was his wife and when he went unto her
[1:20:41] the lord gave her conception and she
[1:20:44] buried my son
[1:20:45] foreign
[1:20:47] all this story is about love
[1:20:50] the love of God the love of the god of
[1:20:53] Israel LED Ruth to make her decision
[1:20:55] Love Letter to lay it at his feet
[1:20:58] love for Ruth LED Boaz to Redeemer
[1:21:02] so let's lay aside whether people love
[1:21:04] me or
[1:21:05] let's lay aside whether the preacher
[1:21:07] loves me
[1:21:10] let's lay aside whether the church loves
[1:21:12] me
[1:21:13] because all that matters is whether God
[1:21:15] loves me
[1:21:18] brother Raymond and the gods provided
[1:21:21] away he said right while they were
[1:21:22] making the most fun
[1:21:26] and teasing her talking about that that
[1:21:28] that girl that married the armor me
[1:21:31] packing
[1:21:33] the son of the armor meat packing plant
[1:21:35] and making fun of her and everything
[1:21:36] there heard the wheels are coming horse
[1:21:37] Hooves of beating the old grinding of
[1:21:39] the sand under the book board
[1:21:41] my my she broke through those lines out
[1:21:44] into the yard she went who was it there
[1:21:46] he was dressed
[1:21:48] The Carriage was ready
[1:21:50] she run through the little trellis at
[1:21:52] the end of the yard like that he jumped
[1:21:53] out of the carriage and grabbed her into
[1:21:54] his arms and he said sweetheart all year
[1:21:57] long I've had people watching you
[1:21:59] hey oh I'm so glad the Holy Ghost the
[1:22:02] eyes on the spare and I know he watches
[1:22:04] me all year long I've been watching you
[1:22:07] I've seen your virtues I've seen the
[1:22:09] flirts of other men I've seen all of
[1:22:11] this but I've seen your truth oh it
[1:22:14] swelled my heart to know that the woman
[1:22:15] I was going to marry was true
[1:22:19] but what about me
[1:22:21] what about you tonight
[1:22:22] do you love God like that enough to be
[1:22:24] true to him and stay with him and stay
[1:22:26] in the field do I love him tonight
[1:22:29] do I love him enough to take up my cross
[1:22:32] enough to keep coming to church enough
[1:22:35] to finish this race enough to continue
[1:22:37] on
[1:22:38] love is what does it yeah love conquers
[1:22:42] all love is unbeatable
[1:22:46] you can't beat love tonight
[1:22:48] you cannot beat love as a musicians come
[1:22:51] forward love suffers long is kind and
[1:22:54] envious not and boneless not itself is
[1:22:56] not puffed up doesn't behave itself
[1:22:58] unseemly seeketh not her own is not
[1:23:01] easily provoked thinketh no evil Rejoice
[1:23:03] it's not an iniquity rejoiceth into the
[1:23:06] truth
[1:23:08] love
[1:23:10] is a thing that will conquer everything
[1:23:14] you love the Lord tonight
[1:23:16] let's stand to our feet
[1:23:18] you know the Bible says that there'll
[1:23:20] come a day when the love of many will
