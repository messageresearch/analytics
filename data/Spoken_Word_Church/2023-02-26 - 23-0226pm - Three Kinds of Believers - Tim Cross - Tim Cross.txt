Highway oh if you're not walking start while I'm talking Walking Up The King's Highway there's joy in knowing with him I am going walking on the King's Highway oh it's a Highway to Heaven none can't walk up there but the pure and hard it's a Highway to Heaven I'm walking out the King's Highway oh my way gets brighter and my load gets lighter I'm walking up the King's Highway Christ walks beside

Lord I couldn't stay in the bullpen any longer I had to come charging out praise the Lord so God bless you where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty amen so we just feel right at home in his presence this evening and just going to invite you to go right into your Bibles and we'll read from Colossians chapter 3 you know what I've got a reputation for being a long-winded preacher and uh as hard as I try brother Samuel I just can't seem to outlive that or move that down but uh and I blame the people for pulling they pulled it right out of me but uh and I joke with some of the uh other ministers friends of mine I said you know I hate to shortchange people they've come all that way and you know it's uh so I hope you don't feel short chains but I guess the the the mind can only contain as much as the seat can sustain so uh some Churches don't have enough patent on the pews for preachers like me but anyway when the Lord is speaking and moving and having his way at time passes very quickly and we just want the Lord to have his way I want to preach this evening on three kinds of Christians and I know brother Adam preached about the make-believer the unbeliever and the True Believer but I'm going to go a little different direction and let's uh just before we read in the scriptures let's approach the author of the word again Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your goodness and your mercy Lord is the words of that song We're sung Lord all my life Lord you've been faithful you've been merciful and Lord we just we can't help but love you and thank you Father for all that you are to us and as we approach your word this evening we ask you to get Lord to come in our midst and break the bread of life to our hearts Lord make the words come off of these pages and live in our lives and just have your way in our midst this evening be glorified in our midst we thank you for it and ask it in Jesus name we pray amen amen we'll read Colossians chapter 3 verses 12 through 17 and then jump down to verse 23. put on therefore down we don't want to be put ons but the Bible says put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness long-suffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body and be thankful let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord and whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God in the father by him verse 23 says and whatsoever you do do it hardly as unto the Lord and not unto men knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance for you serve the Lord Christ for he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done and there is no respect of persons also in Jude chapter 1 I'm going to read beginning of verse number 20. but ye beloved building up yourselves on your Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost keep yourselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life and of some have compassion making a difference and others save with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the Garment spotted by the flesh now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the the presence of his glory with exceeding Joy to the only wise God our savior be glory and Majesty dominion and power both now and ever amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word as you're seated I want to just take a simple thought tonight real basic message but three kinds of Christians and the first uh kind of Christian I'm going to describe to you is is what I would call a casual Christian or a laodicean Christian you know the the thing about the laodicean age it was it was defined as a lukewarm age neither hot nor cold and I find it seems like there's a spirit that is prevalent in the world today that says you know you just need to blend in you know you just don't don't be on the extreme you know just uh if you've got a conviction if you've got something you know just kind of keep that to yourself and don't rock the boat don't make any waves you know and so that uh that prevailing spirit in the world tends to want to creep into the Christian church as well you know I know we uh some years ago we lived on a a nice property we did not own it but it was about 60 or so acres of land and we had a little portion of that with our mobile home on it I'd get out there and mow the grass and all around that property was was Woods or little forest and pond and all these nice things but I brother Bob I noticed every time I mowed the grass I had to go over a few inches and push back the weeds and the Briars and all the other things that every day was trying to creep into that lawn and take that lawn away from me and I think that is how we have to do as Christians you know we have to always be on the offensive otherwise the devil's just going to crowd in day by day little by little and he's going to push us into a corner where we don't have anything amen and he's overtaken what is rightfully ours and so we we have to be conscious of how the devil works and then we have to be willing to stand out to be set apart amen and and I'll tell you this that's really what the world is longing for and looking for when you go to school or you're at work and you're out in the world you know you think well you know I just need to keep this to myself I don't I don't need to be so different or so stand out so much but I want to tell you your your friends at school you know they would love to have parents that love them as much as your parents love you your parents have curfews they have expectations they love you and they want to protect you and keep you from the harms of the world and your friends at school make may make fun of you because of how strict and how disciplined and all those things you are but the truth of the matter is inside they would love to have parents that thought enough of them and cared enough for them to want to shelter them from the things of the world so you know they they may make fun of you and poke fun of you and make you feel despised or belittle but really what what they're looking for is to have that same thing in their lives so if you can be unashamed and unafraid to share your testimony and let your light shine before them it's you know you're going to stand apart from their other worldly friends who are just like them and they're going to come to you one day and they're going to want to know what this reality is that makes you glit makes you glow instead of glitter they're going to know there's something about you that has a power that has a Radiance that has a warmth but you've got to be willing to let that shine through you or otherwise you know the devil he can't destroy you your Gods you're God's Property but what he can do is marginalize you he can try to make you you know just compress into his little box and silence your voice and and and and and mute you as a Christian amen but the holy spirit is here to give us a voice to give us Liberty Amen to make us comfortable in who we are as Sons and Daughters of God but the prophet of God says this in the breach he said woman just called up another woman said you know I'm Episcopalian said I spoke in tongues the other day I believe I received the Holy Ghost but shh don't tell nobody the prophet of God said I doubt that very much you might have spoke on in tongues but you said A Man on Fire how is he going to set steel amen that's right you can't do it can you imagine Peter James and John and them in the upper room saying oh we got the Holy Ghost now and maybe we better just keep still brother through windows and doors and everything they went out into the street acting like a bunch of drunks that's the real Holy Ghost amen and I tell you what you know years ago I heard a brother and he said you know the Holy Ghost doesn't come the way it used to we don't receive the Holy Ghost the way they did on the day of Pentecost in the book of Acts and I thought brother if you ever get the Holy Ghost I got you know it comes the same way and it does the same things every same way and it does the same things everybody might not speak in tongues everybody might not shout or dance in the spirit but when the power of God grips your life you and everybody around you has got to know you gotta hold us something and something got a hold of you and it's Jesus Christ Living himself amen it's not you acting it's not you replicating it's not you trying to imitate something it's the very life of God channeled through you amen as an expression of his life amen and it's a it's a life-changing power but you know the the Casual Christian doesn't want to make a scene doesn't stand out he just tries to blend in with the crowd you know and I'm not picking on anybody I I don't know most of you but you know and and I was young once too and I had young friends and Believers and you know they'd they'd be out in public somewhere and they'd pray and you know instead of just bowing their heads and really praying where everybody knew they was praying they just kind of closed their eyes and wipe their brow like their eye was itching yeah see you need some more courage you need to be bold in your faith now me on the other hand and again I'm not exalting myself but I would go I remember one time when I was about 16 or 17 I was just getting old enough to go out and and and uh fellowship or congregate with some of the young people and of all places we went to a rockola cafe y'all know what a rock Ola or some of you and and if if you don't know great and if you do know you don't have to pretend like you don't but but we were we were here to rockholder brother said and of all things I asked him to turn the music down because you know we was trying to fellowship and they a rock hole is based around rock and roll music so they're blaring and and one young sister said my amen the god to go into a rock only and ask him to turn the music down but you know I it's just who I was I was like well their music's really loud I can't hear I can't enjoy the fellowship amen but it's okay to stand up for what you believe it's okay to speak out amen it's okay to be different amen because you are different we are pilgrims and strangers sojourning here in this world even when Israel was was leaving Egypt and on their way through all of those lands and those peoples they passed through amen I I just say like this God told him you are passing through on your way too none of those places are your destination none of those peoples are yours amen you're just journeying through that on your way to somewhere where you belong so it's okay to stand out it's okay to be differentiated because you you came from a different place and you're going to a different place I've said this you can all you can go through an airport and you can tell a lot about where people come from or where they're going by the way they're dressed and there's a reason we dress different there's a reason we act different there's a reason we are different because we come from somewhere and we go in somewhere and the way we act and look amen says something about where we came from and where we're going amen amen I'm in the heating and air conditioning business just recently I moved back into the sales world but you know you you use natural types to represent spiritual things and I say this God has not called us to be thermometers thermometers only react to what's going around them and tell you what the temperature is God has not called us to be thermometers God has called us to be thermostats amen because of thermostat knows what the temperature is but it's connected to a source of energy that has the power to make a difference amen so you can put a thermometer Amen in a cold room and it just gets cold but if you put a thermostat in the cold room it's connected to a source of heat and it detects what's going on and says we need to make a change about what's going on right here and we need to channel this power Amen to warm the atmosphere and a true Christian a man can walk into a heated situation and cool it down amen you can take control because you are connected to an omnipotent Force Hallelujah and you are the connection between that atmosphere and a Heavenly atmosphere oh I feel like preaching now you can come into a cold church service and say it sounds like things need to warm up a little bit around here I'm going to clap my hands I'm going to lift my voice amen I'm going to praise my God and I'm going to warm the room up so God can have his way amen we're not here to blend in I'm thinking about three Hebrew children amen they got cast into a fiery furnace one day amen they said we're not going to bend we're not going to Bow and as the world found out they wouldn't burn either I mean why because they were connected Amen to the god of the prophet and they said we're not going to bow to an image that some man made of him amen we know the prophet and we know his God and we refuse to Bow and the prophet of God said when those boys enter that fairy furnace wormwood stepped up and said God I'll go Gabriel stepped up and said God I'll go and God said no you won't those boys didn't stand there for you they stood there on Earth for me and now I'm gonna go stand with them they were unaffected by the fire all the fire did was loose their bands and express God's glory even the king had to testify didn't we throw three in there because one has joined themselves to them and he has the form the fourth man is likened to the son of God Hallelujah I don't want to be a casual Christian tonight second kind of Christian is a costume Christian your home we all know what a costume is some people wear those at Halloween they've been hanging something up in the closet all year and they put on on Halloween and they come out looking like a skeleton or come out looking like a former president or some Hollywood star or some movie star you know and they dress up and in appearance they take on another person's identity and you know we think about that and say you know that's that's a satanic holiday really amen but people do the same thing on Sundays and Wednesdays they go into the closet and they pull out the costume of Christianity and they put it on and they drive the church amen and they show up and look and act like a Christian like a message believer oh and there's not a there's not a spot on their garment it's in pristine condition because it's rarely worn amen amen and they appear perfect and spotless and without blemish oh my amen they've never made a mistake in their life but if they make it home amen without cutting somebody off in traffic or doing some ungodly deed amen they put that Christian costume back in the closet and on Monday morning they're just as worldly as their co-workers or their classmates or their unbelieving family amen why because Christianity to them is not a reality it's something they put on to give others a false impression of who they are I don't want to be a costume Christian was a costume Christian he kept a golden wedge and a Babylonian garment stashed away in the closet and I don't know why and I'll probably never get the chance to ask him why but the only thing I can imagine was he had a backup plan just in case the god of Israel ever failed to make good on his promises Aiken could costume himself as a Babylonian and Escape The Tyranny and the death and the persecution or whatever those enemy nations were trying to afflict on Israel Aiken had a backup plan he had a costume that he could put on to be identified as a Babylonian instead of a Christian but you know what his costume religion was costing people their lives right yeah come on his costume Christianity was causing issues in the church and men were losing their lives as a result of this man's hypocrisy until Joshua one day said this ain't right this is something has gone wrong in the camp and the Holy Spirit began to discern and Aiken was exposed as the costume Christian who the god of Israel Jehovah had never become a reality to him and he died as a result of his unbelief I don't want to be a costume Christian this is the deadliest variety of a Christian there is is someone who is putting on a front of Christianity just to impress others Ahab was a costume Christian do you remember Ahab when they were going into battle and I forget to who the other King was I guess it was Jehoshaphat he told Jehoshaphat Jehoshaphat you dress up like the king of Israel and Ahab put on a costume he disguised himself you read about it in First Kings chapter 22 Ahab disguised himself because he was trying to escape the inevitable result of Prophecy that he would die and the dogs would lick his blood so he set up this scheme and he was propping up Jehoshaphat because he knew the enemy was coming against them and as kings they would be a Target so he was going to let Jehoshaphat go out there with all the kingly garments of an Israelite King while Ahab himself would disguise himself but brother and sister you can't hide from prophecy It's Gonna Get You and one of those uh enemy uh archers amen recognize there's Ahab and the arrow of Prophecy smote him between the shoulders and he died in his costume amen prophecy is going to be fulfilled no matter how well the devil tries to disguise himself amen but let me read about yet a third variety of Christians turn with me to Acts chapter 5 verse 17. acts 5 verse 17 then the high priest rose up and all that were with him which is the sect of the Sadducees and we're filled with indignation and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison but the angel of the Lord by Night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life and when they heard that they entered into the temple early in the morning and taught but the high priest came and they that were with him and called the council together and all the Senate of the children of Israel and sent to the prison to have them brought but when the officers came and found them not in the prison they returned and told saying the prison truly found we shut with all safety and the keeper standing without before the doors but when we had opened we found no man with it now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things they doubted of them where unto this would grow then came and told them then came one of them and told them saying behold behold the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people then with the captain with the officers and brought them without violence for they feared the people lest they should have been stoned and when they had brought them they sent them before the council and the high priest and asked them sing did not we straightly command you that you should not teach in this name and behold ye have filled Jerusalem with your Doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood upon us then Peter and the other Apostles answered and said we're sorry we're going to retract our statements and and issue an apology we'll even put it in the local paper or on the websites uh-uh right the third variety of Christian I'm going to talk to you about is not a casual Christian is not a costume Christian but they are a Contagious Christian they are more contagious than covet or any other virus anything that Satan has ever put on the earth to try to replicate the thing he fears the most is the Contagious Christian then Peter and the other Apostles answered and said we ought to obey God rather than men the god of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you slew and hanged on the tree him hath got exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior for to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins and we are his Witnesses of these things and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God hath given to them that obey him when they heard that they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them then stood there up one in the Council of Pharisee named gamalia a doctor of the law had in reputation among all the people and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space and said unto them ye men of Israel take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men for before these days rose up thudius uh theodist boasting himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about 400 joined themselves who were slain and all as many uh as obeyed him or scattered and brought to naught and after this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing and Drew away much people after him he also perished and all even as many obeyed as obeyed him were dispersed and now I say unto you refrain from these men these are contagious Christians refrain from these men and let them alone four if this counsel or this working be of men it will come to naught but if it be of God ye cannot overthrow it less happily ye be found even to fight against God I had a neighbor lady one time when I growing up she had a little fire just over it uh she they lived in a little brick home with a nice yard and some I think they had some black walnut or pecan trees out in front of it then there was a driveway and then there was a broom Sage field so she went right across the driveway just over the edge of that broom stage field and she was just burning some some trash some paper there and a wind came up a wind came up and the next thing you know that fire just began to spread beyond the boundaries of what she had intended for that fire to be and Little Miss Willie Nelson I believe was her name a little Miss Nelson was standing out there and uh had a little stick in her hand and you know she stood there and she tried to stomp that fire out which if any of you have ever experienced this understand trying to stomp that fire out is the single worst thing you can do because all she did every time she stomped was spread those Sparks a little farther every time she stepped and every time she stomped she just spread the fire a little further next thing you know she realized she had something on her hands that she could not contain and by the time she got the phone picked up and the fire department which was hardly a mile down the road the whole field was on fire and was threatening to set the next set of trees the next set of woods on fire I want to say that's what happened on the day of Pentecost every time the devil tried to stamp him out he just spread the fire a little farther amen Ed you would think the dumb devil would eventually learn everything he does to attack the move of God only spreads the move of God but when you become a Contagious Christian amen everything that Satan does to try to silence you only spreads The Voice a little bit farther amen so I say stand up speak up amen don't be ashamed to let God use you and to let your life life be the very expression of his in this world today amen being a Contagious Christian in the patna's vision brother Benham is talking about the vision that John saw of the seven golden lampstands with Christ in the midst and he said he turned he said what is the Candlestick it's a lap stand I'm paraphrasing some of this just to get the essence notice how beautiful when he turned he saw this one like the son of man here standing in the midst see he saw in those lap stands the same one that the Babylonian King saw in the midst of the fire furnace God was right there Amen in the midst of his church amen just like he told Saul why persecute us thou me he was in the midst of that group that Saul was trying to step out and all Saul was doing was spreading the effect of it to the extent where he became a part of it if you can't beat him join him right amen oh my one like the son of man standing here in the midst of the seven golden lampstands which means seven Church ages to come each Piper lamp stand hooked into the big main oil sensor this all came up forth through a little odd-shaped lamp that set with the wick in it and the wick hung down into the oil and they poured all into the top of the stand which filled up the big main stem and the big branch and it run off the stems like this and the lamp with the wick hanging down this pipe kept burning day and night you never had to light it it never went out and they just kept pouring oil in the main pipe these lamp stands that come out like this had the laps sitting on top of them the wick from the lamp run down got its life got its life out of here oh what difference it is from a candle it's a lamp stand so your candle's just made of wax and once it burns down that's it but a lab stand is a wick dipped in an Ever renewing supply of all so it just keeps on burning keeps on giving light because one keeps refilling the source that is creating the light now these lamp stands the fire that was on these lamps heads in the Old Testament when they lit one lamp they could not light the next lap with the same fire they had in their hand they lit one lap then picked it up and lit the other lamp and then set it down and lit this lap and took light and lit this lamp with the same fire they had at the beginning oh I hope it don't go over your head Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the same fire the Holy Ghost lit every one of those churches right down Through the Ages these lamp stands all fit into one great big bowl one great big holder and seven different lamp holders come out of it and when they did each one of those lights was drawing from the main resource of its life and its light was because it had its candle dipped into this main Barrel Oh what a beautiful picture of those Seven Stars it represented that with his life on fire with the Holy Ghost here by faith he's a burning with the Holy Ghost and his life is a candlelord not a candle but a wick that's dipped into the Holy Spirit into Christ and through that Wick he's drawing the life of God out to give light to his church oh what a picture of the True Believer see he's not just putting the emphasis on the messenger he's saying this typifies the believer what kind of a light he's giving the same kind of light that was when the first candle was lit let me just move down for a sake of time notice they are drawing from this main barrel of oil the life is dipped into Christ you are dead and your life is hid in Christ or hidden God through Christ and sealed by the Holy Spirit there's no way at all to ever get you away from here how can you do it nobody can tamper with you the end of your life is burning with the Holy Ghost burning giving light where's the other end of your life dipped into Christ you are dead and hidden in Christ the Holy Ghost is blocking it off there that the devil can't touch you the devil can't touch you he can whiz and make a noise even death itself can't touch you amen I'm I am I won't be too much longer let me read First Peter chapter three First Peter chapter 3 you know sometimes we think they're real Christians the ones really setting the fields on fire are the the pastors and the evangelists and the missionaries and you know they go out and they take the gospel and the reports come in and souls are added to the church but but but that should be contrasted with the individual the individual never underestimate God's power to use you as a witness amen when Naaman was healed of leprosy it was the result of one little girl's testimony one little girl said there's a prophet there's a prophet and you he can be healed you you can be healed one little girl's testimony transformed amen a man of great esteem in Syria at the time so here amen I just want you to say I want you to understand don't underestimate your Witness the the the the the power of God to use you Amen to turn uh turn the world upside down I mean turn your family turn your community turn your school turn your workplace if you can be a yielded vessel God can use you right here right now amen to turn Satan's kingdom on its head he says here in First Peter chapter three likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands you know it's awful to see a wife who listens to everybody else's husband but her own or see a man who's interested in everybody else's Affairs but his own but I'm sorry that was free but he says likewise you why it's being subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also May without the word be one by the conversation of the wives um this word conversation is dealing with your conduct your manner of life even when you say nothing your life is speaking things that are having a compelling effect Amen on that husband or wife that's an unbeliever amen yet the Life of Christ through you amen is is reaching out to bring that companion into Christ while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear who's adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plating the hair and wearing of gold see that's a costume Christian they look the part they made great televangelists but the world sees that veneer and says if that's Christianity I want nothing to do with it but what wins The Sinner is the reality of Christ's life lived through you and they say that's different than anything I've ever seen on television I want to know where you got that and where I can receive it whose adorning let it not be of the outward adorning of plating of the hair of wearing of gold or putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God of great price for after this matter in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands amen your brother told the story about the the sister whose husband would go out and Corrals and hang out with his buddies at the bar and the conversation came up one night said there's no real Christians anymore in the world and that man there at the bar with his buddy said Oh yes there is one my wife is a real Christian he gathered his buddies up they left the bar went to the man's home and you know crashed in through the door there making a big scene making a big Ruckus demanded that she get up and make them some bacon and eggs and threw it on the floor you know the story yeah and instead of the woman reviling in Anger putting the man in this place for his friends she just went back to the stove broke some new eggs in the pan must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free know there's a cross for everyone and theirs a cross for me she was just living that life she wasn't trying to conquer she wasn't trying to compel she was just letting her little light shine and her life her witness for Christ amen brought conviction down into that cabin amen and that man and his buddies saw a real Christian in action brother and sister that's a Contagious Christian amen that's the kind of Christianity amen it's contagious it spreads like fire from one to another it makes others want what you have found amen Paul and Silas were contagious Christians they threw him in prison one night and instead of them sitting in the corner of that cell feeling sorry for themselves they began singing praises to the Lord I'm one of them I'm one of them Jesus said count it all joy amen they weren't putting something on hoping God would react they were just doing what they always did they were praising God and brother it made God so pleased amen that he began tapping his foot and like brother Branham said Heaven is his throne and Earth Is His footstool by the body and when God began patting his foot I believe he told the Angels hey amen take it down a few notches I'm getting a higher Praise You Angels don't know how to worship me like this but those on Earth who are the redeemed Sons and Daughters of God who were bought out of Satan's pawn shop amen and redeemed and filled with my spirit when they begin to worship me it gets my attention amen it brings a reaction they compelled God hallelujah and begins tapping his foot and when it begins tapping his foot the Earth began to shake the Earth began to tremble the walls of a prison that was designed to Captivate Christians amen shook to the ground Hallelujah God came on the scene to vindicate the testimony of his sons brother they stood there they weren't looking for a release but God gave him a release and God didn't just shake the walls of the prison down he didn't just break the bars but if Philippian Jailer said what must I do to be saved I want the god that you serve amen I served a god of bondage long enough I want a God that gives Liberty I want to tell you if you want that kind of God tonight you can have that kind of God if you want the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can have it you can have your healing you can have salvation you can have your joy your Liberty restored amen God's presence breaks the prison bars apart amen the Holy Ghost is the cure for the common Christian it makes you very uncommon it makes you stand out it makes you stand apart it makes you fast it makes you pray

have you ever seen a dandelion it's it's considered to be a weed you know these people that have these Southern Homes and Gardens Lawns and they get blue ribbons for their lawn they don't want to see a dandelion because it's considered to be a weed amen but you know you go along you think oh my you're on your mower you know if you're an evangelist you you drive a conventional mower if you're a pastor you got a zero turn I'm just kidding folks I'm not pleading for an offering that's just a joke hey if you preach like me you push Mo right but you're going along you're more and you'll see that dandelion oh my I got to get that little fella out of my yard well brother running over him with the mower is the worst thing you can do because that little bulb amen has got about a thousand little dandelions attached to the core and about the moment you head over that thing with that 42 inch deck you got about a thousand dandelions waiting to sprout and that's exactly what happened on Calvary amen Satan saw a flower there and he said I'll mow him down but all he did was spread that life in 120 come out of the upper room and Satan said I'm mowing down and God said no you won't every time you step it every time you stole it they just spread farther and farther let your light so shiny for me that others may see God and glorify God the Father through his life living through you let's go
