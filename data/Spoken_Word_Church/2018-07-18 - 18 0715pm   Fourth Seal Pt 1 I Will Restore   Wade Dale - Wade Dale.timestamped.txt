[18:11] morning some guys decided to I told them
[18:16] it's Joe that's what they get for
[18:17] working on Sunday some guys was trying
[18:19] to cut a tree back here and it fell on
[18:21] the felling the lines brother Joe went
[18:23] out and did some investigating and and
[18:26] found a lady fussing them out it's on
[18:30] Sundays for the fussing fussing them out
[18:33] Saturday it would have been a different
[18:35] story but today it's fussing fussing
[18:38] them out so that was what the problem
[18:40] was that's what you get for working on
[18:43] Sunday amen Benigno a good man out to
[18:46] the Lord good to be back everything's
[18:48] good and cool and ready to go and we all
[18:50] right
[18:50] we got your Bibles let's turn to
[18:52] revelation 6 we had a real good time
[18:54] broke laws that tell everybody hello
[18:56] good to see each and every one of you we
[18:59] got everybody back I think well John and
[19:02] Myles not back I thought they'd be back
[19:04] this Sunday but maybe it'd be here
[19:06] Wednesday night next Sunday so well get
[19:10] them back from Virginia and then we're
[19:12] gonna lock the doors and keep them here
[19:13] so long man so just really enjoy
[19:18] everybody being here I enjoy the new
[19:20] ones you need you look at some places
[19:23] and you see that people are falling away
[19:26] and seems like we're gathering a few
[19:28] extras so that's all right because where
[19:34] the carcass is it didn't say the
[19:40] buzzards would be gathered no the
[19:43] buzzards eat the old stuff we're eating
[19:46] the good new stuff we're eating the
[19:48] fresh meat the fresh kill of the word of
[19:52] God really been enjoying we're brother
[19:56] Dale has been bringing on the the new
[19:58] birth because we need we need that and
[20:00] then coming up with the with the virtues
[20:03] and and you know I was thinking when he
[20:05] was preaching Wednesday night I thought
[20:07] man you know we are all sheep
[20:12] the Word of God said we're sheep so we
[20:16] have to be led that's what God said you
[20:21] know why because he knew what we would
[20:22] act like if we didn't have a shepherd a
[20:25] man we'd be all scattered and we'd be
[20:28] we'd be like herding cats brother direct
[20:30] weaving you know I've ever tried to hurt
[20:31] a cat's kinda like pushing the rope you
[20:32] know you can't get it to go anywhere and
[20:34] and that's the way it would be but now
[20:37] we have some sort of structure because
[20:39] being a human being we work better under
[20:41] structure an office and somebody you say
[20:44] oh I hate that person being my boss well
[20:47] you know what somebody probably hates
[20:49] you being the boss but somebody's got to
[20:51] be the boss but God is a loving boss God
[20:55] we we serve Him not out of out of half -
[20:58] I hope I hope is this God that we serve
[20:59] because we want to amen come to what
[21:02] he's done for us and and this this seal
[21:05] here that we're fixing to go into number
[21:06] four I've been studying of course last
[21:09] week we didn't do much but I'm just kind
[21:11] of sitting around thinking about things
[21:13] and you know when you come to the fourth
[21:15] seal and you come to the rapture that's
[21:19] it for us kind of that's the finality
[21:22] we're gonna read some things today where
[21:25] I had not read it before where it tells
[21:27] us that it's the end even in covering
[21:29] the fourth seal so in this fourth seal
[21:32] let's really try to study it because you
[21:34] know what if we miss it we missed the
[21:37] Raptor if we missed the fourth seal we
[21:41] missed the rapture that seal now we know
[21:43] it opens later because the man of sin
[21:45] has got to be incarnate and we don't see
[21:47] that but remember we're so close so
[21:50] close to where we see all these things
[21:53] getting ready to happen I was telling
[21:55] him downstairs you know this new this
[21:58] new guy that they're appointing for the
[22:01] Supreme Court he's a Catholic but he's a
[22:06] Jesuit Catholic
[22:07] he's a Jesuit priest out of Notre Dame
[22:10] well maybe not you don't say priest but
[22:12] he was a he is the order of Jesuit and
[22:14] he is the new Supreme Court nominee so
[22:19] it's coming down to the end it's coming
[22:22] down to where that you know what
[22:24] even the highest court of the land you
[22:27] know are mostly Catholics and Jews not
[22:30] want to think only one Protestant on the
[22:33] whole bench that John Roberts can but
[22:36] you see how its swinging to everything
[22:38] swinging away from us and taken of
[22:41] course we know that it's like brother
[22:43] Ernie sent me a message the other day he
[22:44] said aren't we glad and this is true
[22:47] we're glad to already have heard
[22:49] tomorrow's news we've already heard
[22:52] tomorrow's news we know what's gonna
[22:54] happen there's 300 something million
[22:56] people in this United States are going
[22:57] what are we gonna do if this one gets
[22:59] elected what we gonna do if isn't
[23:01] disliked what we're gonna do if he gets
[23:02] up so what we knows like Bodell said
[23:06] about the flag we salute the flag I
[23:08] honor the flag of United States you know
[23:09] what cuz it gives me freedom but now I
[23:11] know what it's gonna end up in but I
[23:14] have nothing to do with that and man we
[23:17] are under the flag of what they're
[23:19] Almighty and then we live under that
[23:21] flag but we do under the flag of the
[23:23] United States no doubt these idiots that
[23:25] don't like to to honor the flag they
[23:28] oughta send them somewhere where there's
[23:29] no freedom you ought to send them over
[23:31] there and stay here you know fend for
[23:33] yourself if football uniforms wouldn't
[23:35] do good in Iraq promise you that so
[23:38] anyhow revelation 6 I hope nobody's
[23:41] watching online from from the NFL I know
[23:43] they ain't nobody watching online so
[23:45] anyway it doesn't matter so I'm not
[23:47] worried about anybody know anything
[23:49] about what's going on but like I said
[23:51] truly though doesn't it make you feel
[23:53] better that you do know tomorrow's news
[23:54] we know how this thing is going to end
[23:56] up now we may not know the names of the
[23:58] people but we know the spirit we know
[24:01] what's gonna happen it's gonna all head
[24:02] up in religion amen it's gonna all head
[24:07] up in religion that and we'll read when
[24:08] I read this Sunday but Wednesday night
[24:10] brother branham said that the powers in
[24:12] this 4-cyl are political religious and
[24:17] demonic those three powers are going to
[24:21] be made known in this end time by a
[24:24] bride just us being here is what's gonna
[24:27] make all this happen so and just being
[24:29] here today is keeping all the wrath off
[24:31] of us anywhere or not off us but off of
[24:33] the world so but revelation 6 we're
[24:36] going to kind of review a little bit
[24:38] since
[24:38] it's been a few weeks Oh revelation 6
[24:40] verse 1 let's bow our heads Lord Jesus
[24:43] today Lord we pray that you would come
[24:47] among us Lord in a special way him just
[24:50] open our eyes and let us be all
[24:52] tender-hearted and and received from You
[24:55] Father we don't want to have stony
[24:56] hearts or our hearts made out of wood
[24:59] but you gave us a heart of flesh and you
[25:03] are the one that decided that you were
[25:05] going to come down and live in that
[25:06] human flesh and Lord you made a way it's
[25:09] called Redemption we know that you
[25:12] before the foundation of the world knew
[25:13] who would or who wouldn't but we had to
[25:15] come down here Lord and we had to act
[25:17] the part out we had to act this out Lord
[25:20] the way you saw it but it's Redemption
[25:23] Redemption Redemption if without you
[25:26] Lord we would not be we couldn't even be
[25:29] redeemed without you father so now come
[25:32] and be with us take care of us give us a
[25:35] word to speak to the people and give the
[25:37] here is a revelation father because only
[25:39] you can do that save the Lost heal the
[25:42] sick be with the ones on the highways
[25:45] brother Anderson and all the ones Lord
[25:46] just take care of them bless us and take
[25:48] care of us in the further of this
[25:49] service in Jesus name we pray amen
[25:52] all right let's read we're gonna read
[25:54] all first four seals and I saw when the
[25:58] lamb opened one of the seals I heard it
[25:59] was the noise of thunder one of the four
[26:01] beasts saying come and see
[26:03] and I saw him behold of white horse and
[26:05] he that sat on him had a bow and the
[26:07] crown was given unto him and he went
[26:09] forth conquering in to conquer and when
[26:11] he had opened the second seal I heard
[26:12] the second beast say come and see and
[26:14] there went out another horse that was
[26:16] red and power was given to him to set
[26:18] thereon to take peace from the earth
[26:20] that they should kill one another and
[26:22] there was given to him a great sword and
[26:24] when he had opened the third seal I
[26:26] heard the third beast say come and see
[26:28] always come and see and I beheld and lo
[26:32] a black horse and he that sat on him had
[26:33] a pair of balances in his hand I heard a
[26:36] voice in the midst of the four beasts
[26:37] say a measure of wheat for a penny and
[26:39] three measures of barley for a penny see
[26:41] thou hurt not the oil and the wine I
[26:44] want you to take that hold on to that
[26:46] because we're gonna read that again in a
[26:48] minute alright and when he had opened
[26:50] the fourth seal here's one
[26:52] we're coming to today we won't get into
[26:54] it much but we'll just kind of hit it
[26:55] and then pick it up on Wednesday and
[26:58] when he had opened the fourth seal I
[27:00] heard the voice of the fourth beast say
[27:01] come and see and I looked and behold a
[27:04] pale horse and his name that sat on him
[27:06] was death and hell followed with him and
[27:09] power was given unto them over the
[27:11] fourth part of the earth to kill with
[27:12] sword with hunger with death and with
[27:16] the beasts of the earth you may be
[27:17] seated in the Lord at his blessing to
[27:19] the reading of the word me and the
[27:23] construction crew in here is gonna get
[27:24] all this stuff together hey by all
[27:31] rights a man so this is probably the
[27:33] last time you say Amen till you wake
[27:35] back up after we're finished so anyhow
[27:39] thank you buddy you don't want to talk
[27:43] brother claw I was gonna have y'all do
[27:44] I'm gonna buy about 80 bowling balls
[27:48] okay eight pounders and I'm gonna have
[27:51] you sit and hold that bowling ball over
[27:53] your feet you'll get it in a minute
[27:59] because when you go to sleep okay anyway
[28:05] give something hold onto you don't want
[28:09] that bowling ball hits your feet
[28:11] revelations tells us though what we've
[28:15] been going through is is that down to
[28:17] the church ages and that's what I want
[28:19] you to see today down to the church ages
[28:21] there is a continuity between what God
[28:24] is doing the Devils doing now the devil
[28:27] he's changing he's changing it's like
[28:29] well I like what brother Branham says
[28:30] and we'll read it in the fourth seal
[28:32] later on but Satan starts with the white
[28:35] horse goes red goes black goes to pale
[28:37] he's trying his best to thwart God and
[28:40] try to you know try to keep his God's
[28:43] people unbalanced God just gets on a
[28:46] white horse and just keeps riding a
[28:47] white horse amen
[28:50] the white horse we see that that God
[28:52] rides and we're gonna see him in the
[28:55] Millenium we're gonna see him in white
[28:56] we're gonna see him in a future home
[28:58] he's coming back what riding in on a
[29:01] white horse
[29:01] it was the same horse he started with
[29:03] Satan's got four
[29:05] he's trying his best to do what he can
[29:07] to get rid of us huh I want you to look
[29:10] now in Joel to because we kind of
[29:12] subtitled this today I will restore but
[29:15] we're going to kind of continue on that
[29:16] line because remember now keep this in
[29:20] the back of your mind if I say if for
[29:23] your purpose if the rapture takes place
[29:25] in the fourth seal then redemption is
[29:27] truly over for the Gentiles all right
[29:32] because remember these four seals happen
[29:36] in this dimension the fifth dimension
[29:39] when that seal I'm sorry the fifth seal
[29:42] when it breaks whether Brown says we go
[29:44] into another dimension because what he
[29:47] had to do is the souls that was under
[29:49] the altar were not in the first three
[29:51] dimensions I don't know what dimensions
[29:53] then doesn't matter but he had pop I
[29:55] mean John had to go into another
[29:57] dimension to see those dead Saints but
[30:00] they were already gone and then he then
[30:02] he I mean just two outstanding
[30:04] revelation because brother Brown says we
[30:08] thought those were the the dead Saints
[30:11] the dead Saints can't be in that fifth
[30:15] seal amen because he said we take a
[30:18] rapture in the fourth seal there's
[30:20] nobody in that dimension the sixth
[30:23] dimension is emptied out there's nobody
[30:25] there so I mean what a great revelation
[30:26] it all down to but that's always been in
[30:28] the Bible it's always been in the Bible
[30:31] they hadn't changed nothing's changed in
[30:34] the Bible it's just our what that guy
[30:37] that dude in the first seal or in the
[30:40] first church age he starts eating at the
[30:42] word and he's eat it down now to wear
[30:45] false doctrine everywhere all right that
[30:50] okay but see the continent you can as I
[30:53] was telling them in Oklahoma look at the
[30:55] continuity of God he doesn't jump around
[30:59] God's words true never has to be changed
[31:02] it's not like the Mormon Bible it's
[31:04] changed like 500 and sometimes in in 500
[31:07] years how you going to trust something
[31:10] like that because it was and it's not
[31:12] and now it back is again any weapon
[31:14] God's Word doesn't change God's Word is
[31:17] true
[31:18] and we're going to read here and I'm
[31:20] going to let brother branham explain
[31:21] from the fifth seal how that all these
[31:24] are plays so that you just think it's
[31:26] not just me placing them but that you'll
[31:28] see how these things work and we read it
[31:30] because it'll be kind of a long reading
[31:31] but let's turn to Joel I want you to
[31:32] watch something excuse me Joel 2:23 its
[31:39] be glad then you children of Zion Oh
[31:41] who's that that's us
[31:42] alright that's us God's talking to me
[31:46] and you and rejoicing the Lord your God
[31:49] for he I've given you the former rain
[31:50] moderately and he will cause to come
[31:53] down for you the rain the former rain
[31:55] and the latter rain in the first month
[32:00] that's today you're getting the teaching
[32:04] rain and you're getting the revelation
[32:06] rain or the harvest rain you're getting
[32:08] it right now today so that Scripture is
[32:11] not outdated it may be in the Old
[32:14] Testament but you sitting here today
[32:16] have made it you have made it new you
[32:20] have made it all come together because
[32:26] Joel said I will restore well now when
[32:30] Joel was there there was no restoration
[32:32] oh sure there rest they restored natural
[32:35] buildings what we've been talking about
[32:37] in the Bible study in in Romans Paul
[32:39] covers circumcision and uncircumcision
[32:41] does not matter if you're circumcised in
[32:45] your flesh or not why does it matter but
[32:48] it does in the heart but God couldn't
[32:51] get in the heart in the Old Testament so
[32:53] we had to accept Abraham but the problem
[32:56] is they were standing there going we be
[32:58] Abraham's seed we we're of the
[33:01] circumcision and Paul said look how long
[33:05] was he in circumcision a long time when
[33:10] God called him even the faith of Abraham
[33:13] started in uncircumcision if you ever
[33:16] thought of that amen
[33:18] that read Romans four God told him or
[33:22] Paul told him God told him through Paul
[33:24] then hey your circumcision is fine when
[33:27] it was there for the moment but now
[33:30] since God came down
[33:32] human flesh and died on the cross now
[33:34] it's the fleshly tables of the heart
[33:35] even the Old Testament tells you that so
[33:39] so Abraham
[33:40] it wasn't the circumcision or not
[33:42] circumcision it was we're not we're not
[33:46] children of Abraham by a flash we're
[33:48] children of Abraham my wife faith you
[33:51] and I have to have so much faith to
[33:53] believe something that there's never
[33:54] happened before then a sinner you said
[33:58] all it happened with Jesus Jesus wasn't
[34:00] a sinner he got a body changed a man but
[34:03] he wasn't a sinner a man we're sinners
[34:08] born wrong get a new birth to make us
[34:12] right again and that we're gonna take a
[34:13] body change you gonna have to believe
[34:15] that amen now we know Abraham had a body
[34:19] change but it was temporary
[34:20] he died when we receive a body change we
[34:25] don't die amen so how will restore the
[34:29] floors now look the floor shall be full
[34:32] of wheat and the fat shall overflow with
[34:36] wine and all we just read that in the
[34:38] third seal we're in the third seal right
[34:42] here wine and oil together all right
[34:44] talking about what the Holy Ghost cuz
[34:46] look there is no restoration without the
[34:50] Holy Ghost you can build a temple then
[34:54] knock it down you build a house then
[34:55] knock it down but you can't get the new
[34:57] birth and get knocked down sure you and
[34:59] get knocked down but you can't lose your
[35:00] salvation you can't lose your eternal
[35:02] life and then so I will restore so what
[35:04] God is going to restore he's gonna
[35:06] restore it and it's not gonna fall again
[35:10] this restoration is not that we're not
[35:12] going back to the first church age we're
[35:15] not going back to the third church age
[35:17] we're not going back to the fifth or
[35:18] sixth term we're not even going back to
[35:20] the seven churches because we're in the
[35:23] seven churches in time but your soul
[35:25] better not being there because if your
[35:28] soul is in the seventh the seventh
[35:30] church age I'm going to read to you what
[35:32] you're going to get ain't good but I
[35:35] will restore to you the years that the
[35:37] locust has eaten the cankerworm
[35:38] caterpillar Pama were my great army
[35:40] which I sent among you all right so he's
[35:42] got a restorer because he sent the army
[35:45] among us
[35:45] okay he has to do a work of restoration
[35:49] and ye shall eat in plenty and be
[35:53] satisfied see when you restore now you
[35:56] think you look at all this what brother
[35:58] Branham preached on the the the
[35:59] restoration of the broad tree pretty
[36:01] awful what this bug does he sway the
[36:04] fellowship and you understands that you
[36:07] know that's a sermon for another time
[36:08] but it's not good what this thing does
[36:11] this bug eats but you say that you shall
[36:15] eat in plenty and be satisfied there's a
[36:17] restoration coming back up where that
[36:20] we're going to be satisfied and praise
[36:22] the name of the Lord your God that have
[36:24] dealt wondrously with you and my people
[36:26] shall never be ashamed I'm not ashamed
[36:31] to be living in his church are you shame
[36:33] to be living interchange no no no you
[36:35] wouldn't survive in another Church age
[36:37] because you're built for this church age
[36:39] you're built for this time amen and you
[36:43] shall know that I'm in the midst of
[36:44] Israel and that I'm the Lord your God
[36:46] and none else in my people shall never
[36:48] be ashamed and they shall come to pass
[36:49] afterward that I will pour out my spirit
[36:54] upon all flesh your sons and your
[36:56] daughters prophesy old men dream dreams
[36:58] young men see visions watch this and
[36:59] also upon the servants and upon the head
[37:01] and maids in those days will I pour out
[37:03] my spirit and I will show wonders in the
[37:06] heavens and the earth blood and fire and
[37:07] pillars of smoke Sun shall be turned
[37:09] darkness the moon into blood before the
[37:11] great and terrible day of the Lord come
[37:15] now read Malachi Malachi 4 what does it
[37:19] say I will restore the hearts of the
[37:21] fathers and children's children father's
[37:23] what less that's mighty earth with a
[37:24] curse the great terrible day of the Lord
[37:27] all right and it shall come to pass that
[37:28] whosoever shall call on the name of the
[37:30] Lord shall be delivered were the only
[37:32] people that know his name because we're
[37:34] going to see I'm building up to this
[37:36] fourth seal because the fourth seal
[37:37] names come up death and hell and all
[37:40] these things for a mountain Zion and in
[37:43] Jerusalem shall be deliverance as the
[37:45] Lord has said and in the remnant whom
[37:47] the Lord shall call so is everybody all
[37:50] right so this is going to not just
[37:51] restore Israel we know Israel's going to
[37:53] be restored but remember Israel is not
[37:55] restored until we leave
[37:58] hey man Israel's not gods not even
[38:01] dealing with Israel as a nation until we
[38:04] leave all right then he will restore he
[38:08] will bring back all those things but
[38:10] he's not going to bring it back like
[38:11] they thought cuz what did the disciples
[38:13] in mount and Matthew they said you're
[38:16] gonna restore this no didn't in Acts
[38:18] when Jesus was getting ready to the sin
[38:20] are you gonna restore the temple say
[38:22] they all got to build the natural
[38:23] building thing we gotta quit worrying
[38:26] about the natural building and worry
[38:29] about the spiritual building of God amen
[38:32] so now let's read I want to go back and
[38:35] this is the fifth seal but since we
[38:38] haven't done this in a while go back and
[38:40] show you the white red black and let
[38:42] brother branham tell you all these
[38:44] things now let's go with the first one
[38:46] here number one this is on the fifth
[38:48] seal if you want to read it yourself you
[38:50] can now we're gonna do a little bit of
[38:52] reading today just to kind of get
[38:54] everybody caught back up all right
[39:00] brother bottom on the fifth seal now
[39:02] what he's doing how many of you noticed
[39:04] that brother branham he really don't
[39:05] spend a lot of time on the seal that the
[39:06] day the seals preached he reviews he'll
[39:12] review for an hour and a half about the
[39:14] fourth seal and then he'll tell you what
[39:15] fifth day lives in any quits then on the
[39:18] sixth seal he'll tell you what the fifth
[39:19] seal is about an hour and a half and
[39:21] then he takes a little bit of six
[39:23] sealing any quiz all right so this is
[39:25] the fifth seal but he's talking about
[39:26] four bags so that's what we want to talk
[39:28] about is the fourth seal by now we see
[39:31] that the Devils changing a four beast
[39:33] meant that power they was revealed to
[39:35] the one power he revealed to the world
[39:38] and how they ended in this pale death
[39:41] horse now let's look at God's powers of
[39:44] these beasts to combat them that's what
[39:47] we've always told you about right we
[39:50] told you that God sends out an anointing
[39:54] and Satan has won there - all right so
[39:57] now the first beast of God he went out
[39:58] to meet the antichrist with the
[40:01] antichrist spirit when it said it was
[40:02] just his teaching now remember when the
[40:04] Antichrist first wrote he was in a
[40:06] teaching ministry the Antichrist wrote
[40:09] first in a teaching ministry remember in
[40:10] the first church days
[40:12] the church agent was a saying it was a
[40:15] saying a saying went out this and that
[40:17] and the other and all the things right
[40:19] now and watch the one that me that went
[40:23] out to meet him was the lion the lion of
[40:25] the tribe of Judah all right watch the
[40:28] Lion of the tribe of Judah which is the
[40:30] word they had the pure word the first
[40:32] three Church ages and then brother Brent
[40:36] said they should never went to Nicaea
[40:37] when was Nicaea right here
[40:39] they went to Nicaea that's when that bug
[40:42] started to eating and man that bug
[40:44] started to eating the word down all
[40:46] right and watch the one that went to
[40:48] meet him the line the line of the tribe
[40:50] of Judah which is the word when his
[40:51] false teaching went forth the true word
[40:54] went forth to me and look how garden God
[40:56] was there because he knew that thing was
[40:59] going to start he knew what it was going
[41:01] to fish but look he knew what the
[41:03] beginning of that thing was just little
[41:05] sayings so we had to have a fivefold
[41:08] ministry that was on the scene that was
[41:10] preaching hey let there was no prophets
[41:13] oh yeah Paul was a prophet a man Paul
[41:16] was a prophet but before Paul Peter what
[41:19] in a major profit Paul was a major
[41:21] profit right but before Paul between
[41:23] between Peter and Paul there was several
[41:26] years in there that the church got
[41:28] established he said how you know that
[41:31] because Paul was persecuting them there
[41:34] was a church already established for
[41:36] Paul wouldn't had anything to persecute
[41:38] Paul was persecuting the Christians let
[41:43] me be real plain he was part of that
[41:45] wild horse rider to begin with he was he
[41:51] he said all that was false and he warned
[41:53] them all dead in there right so that
[41:56] white horse had attached himself to Paul
[42:00] that's hard to say but they all attached
[42:04] to us too you know all right Jesus is
[42:07] the only one he couldn't attach yourself
[42:08] to hey man
[42:09] it's even even brother branham even all
[42:12] of us did had a little false idea you
[42:14] think that came from God a false
[42:16] doctrine we'll never has never come from
[42:20] God ever so if you've had to say I'm
[42:24] sorry for what I
[42:25] taught then that was not God right so we
[42:32] just but now what brother Brown said he
[42:33] said he said hey yeah I would have been
[42:35] very wrong if I had preached it the way
[42:37] I thought it right they said that on the
[42:39] first set watch the one meet him what's
[42:41] the line why that line was bold Paul
[42:43] look at Apollo look at leisure he lifts
[42:46] them that's the reason we had an
[42:47] arrhenius Irina's that stood up one day
[42:50] and said I don't even want to be in the
[42:51] same room with that sir in theist guy
[42:53] that faults teaching he didn't want to
[42:55] be in the same room with him all right
[42:57] Anna Polycarp and these fellows st.
[43:00] Martin when that Antichrist was riding
[43:02] with his false teaching God sent his
[43:04] teaching out the word the Lion of the
[43:07] tribe of Judah that's why you had your
[43:09] alpha bride and your meager brides got
[43:10] to be the same the words got to come
[43:12] back in power like it was back then
[43:14] plus the opening of the seals plus the
[43:18] opening of the seals amen
[43:19] what to show Iranians couldn't say well
[43:23] I'm part of sila number one Bible
[43:26] wouldn't even written at that time and
[43:28] then but what do you do he got an
[43:30] inspiration from God
[43:31] I'll read you a quote here I found
[43:33] brother Branham it was really good and
[43:34] it really I'm talking I've been talking
[43:36] about compartmentalizing will brother
[43:38] Brown compartmentalize right here and
[43:40] he'll tell you about it he just says he
[43:42] put it in the box
[43:43] well that's the same thing when you
[43:45] compartmentalize you put this in a box
[43:46] you put this in the box and you put this
[43:49] in the box all right you file this you
[43:52] file this if this is Susan's filing this
[43:54] is Donny's file you put them in a
[43:56] different box for Susan to get mad
[43:59] that's the reason we had an re-center
[44:01] Polycarp and these fellows st. Martin
[44:04] when that Antichrist was riding with his
[44:05] false teaching God sent his teaching out
[44:07] the word the line of the tribe of Judah
[44:08] which is the word made manifest in the
[44:11] Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit there to
[44:13] what manifests himself which is the word
[44:15] that's the reason the early church had
[44:18] healings and miracles and visions in
[44:20] power roll up or sorry roll down it's
[44:24] because it was the Living Word in the
[44:26] form of the Lion of the tribe of Judah
[44:28] riding out to combat that amen now you
[44:30] get it he sends his power Antichrist God
[44:33] sends his the word Antichrist false
[44:36] teaching the true teaching went with
[44:39] that to combat it now that's the first
[44:41] one that was the first church that
[44:43] pathology that went to meet him now the
[44:44] second beast that the Antichrist and
[44:48] that was a red beef which was a road
[44:50] owned was to take peace from the earth
[44:52] in war now the second one that went to
[44:54] combat him was the odds so we got
[44:56] everything right the white which is the
[45:00] lion the Ox which is the fourth church
[45:03] age goes watch him he'll tell you right
[45:04] here now the second one the one that was
[45:08] the ox beast the Ox means they labor a
[45:11] beast of burden now if you could just
[45:14] stop a minute let me let me make sure to
[45:15] see this that's the kind of might be a
[45:17] little puzzling to you but let us now he
[45:19] goes to what fight our church age one
[45:24] two three fourth our church age which is
[45:28] the dark ages so he places it right
[45:30] exactly where it's supposed to be all
[45:33] right
[45:33] fight IRA it was a laboring Church we
[45:36] read that into the angel the Church of
[45:37] thought Tyre these things saith the son
[45:39] of God you got the hives like flames of
[45:40] fire feet like fine brass I know that
[45:43] works see becoming all works now see
[45:45] because that's the one who's riding with
[45:47] them that's brother branham's quote and
[45:50] the charity and service and faith and
[45:53] patience and the last to be more than
[45:55] the first aren't goat keep going up I
[45:57] don't know why you put them gaps in
[45:59] there see that shows that the tyrant
[46:01] aged after the Antichrist got settled
[46:02] down ain't coming to the thought ironies
[46:05] the little church could do nothing but
[46:06] just simply labor to the dark ages
[46:10] the Christians just said I'm a Christian
[46:12] then they died the life expectancy of a
[46:15] Christian in that day and that 68
[46:16] million of them it wasn't very long all
[46:18] right but you know what that was the
[46:20] spirit of the age because I'm fixing to
[46:21] read through right here what brother
[46:22] Aaron said about it and another thing
[46:24] the Ox is a beast of sacrifice see they
[46:27] gave their life just as freely as they
[46:29] could give them in the Dark Ages a
[46:32] thousand years they're the Catholicism
[46:34] control the world and they just went
[46:35] right in yes or no they don't mind dying
[46:38] if it was death that's all right and
[46:40] they went and died in anyway the very
[46:41] spirit of the age all right keep going
[46:43] up and now I want to show you this right
[46:44] here keep going
[46:48] he's facing the compartmentalize
[46:51] he stops here and makes he stops all
[46:54] that and goes to paragraph 140 I'm going
[46:56] to set this box up here to represent
[46:59] that if God sends a certain spirit among
[47:01] them that's the only thing that they can
[47:04] work by that right that's the only thing
[47:08] they can work by so he gives them a box
[47:12] he sets the box in there for church
[47:14] agencies alright this is the this is the
[47:17] sermon you're going to get this is the
[47:19] person you're going to get to preach it
[47:21] this is the characteristic of that age
[47:23] and this is what if you overcome this is
[47:26] what you're going to get now we know
[47:28] there's overlapping but but remember the
[47:31] first church 3:3 Church ages didn't give
[47:33] their life as freely as they did in that
[47:35] because what the spirit if God sends a
[47:39] certain spirit among them that's the
[47:41] only thing that they can work by is the
[47:43] spirit that works among them now will
[47:46] prove to you by the history of the
[47:47] church and by the opening of the seals
[47:49] and the powers that let loose and watch
[47:52] exactly the church respond to the
[47:55] anointing and they couldn't do nothing
[47:58] else couldn't do nothing else they had
[48:02] to respond like brother Dale saying your
[48:05] your leaders that come down through the
[48:07] office of apostle prophet pastors
[48:10] teachers evangelists they were in all
[48:11] these places and they preached a sermon
[48:14] and we don't take while I'm if we took
[48:19] Luther's sermon and preached it today we
[48:21] could all go over to the Buffalo well I
[48:24] won't say that go over to the beer joint
[48:26] and have a beer and smoke pot right and
[48:29] we've been alright because that's what
[48:30] Martin Luther had but that was in this
[48:32] church age that was in this box but that
[48:36] box was sealed away Holy Ghost but that
[48:40] box was sealed away and they're waiting
[48:43] on us because they only got a dip of the
[48:45] Holy Ghost they got a part of it amen
[48:49] cuz I want to show you something now in
[48:51] just a minute when we get to our church
[48:53] age all right you ready now now the
[48:58] first was a line that roared that pure
[49:00] unadulterated word the second inside
[49:01] tyre was the Ox
[49:03] it was a burden a beast of burden pardon
[49:04] me it was also
[49:05] official beast and wasn't exactly the
[49:08] poor little Church of Rome that settled
[49:09] down there to be a thousand years of
[49:10] dark ages
[49:11] anything didn't profess to be a Roman
[49:13] Church was put to death and they had to
[49:16] labor going from place to place now
[49:17] that's under the second seal that's the
[49:20] red horse or the Ox now let's go to
[49:23] number three all right still in the
[49:28] fifth seal he continues about five pages
[49:30] of reading that he really he's reviewing
[49:34] kind of what we're doing now now the
[49:36] third beast that went out from the devil
[49:38] was this black horse
[49:39] now the third beast that went out power
[49:42] from God to combat him to combat the
[49:45] power of the black horse was a man
[49:47] cunning smart with the wisdom of God
[49:49] that's what we just got through look
[49:51] like ah man the black horse comes out
[49:54] remember we talked about
[49:56] excuse me about the blackness and about
[49:59] if you're at that light and you be
[50:00] darkness that man's a man is listening
[50:03] man's the one that came up with these
[50:04] denominations not God now God allowed
[50:09] those things to happen but he didn't
[50:11] from the beginning want to do that
[50:12] that's why I went from a saying to a
[50:15] deed to a doctrine it became a doctrine
[50:19] right here saying a deed they had to do
[50:23] these things or they got killed or and
[50:26] then what happened what's the problem
[50:28] the problem that wasn't enough power I
[50:30] don't say there was enough power in the
[50:32] word there wasn't enough power that was
[50:34] released so there's always power in the
[50:37] word but there was a power that that
[50:39] wasn't released why because he had to
[50:42] restore I had to go in the ground
[50:45] we know Jesus went in the ground over
[50:47] here amen
[50:50] Rose became the power of the church he
[50:54] stills the power of the church still was
[50:57] the power church in this stage but there
[50:58] wasn't much for the work troops went
[51:00] back in the ground and then it went back
[51:03] in the ground and what I will restore
[51:06] had to come out of that dark age by the
[51:11] intelligence of man but what did man do
[51:14] man didn't trust in God to trusted
[51:16] herself
[51:17] we'll make a Baptist in the Methodist
[51:19] and a pen hey that was the same back
[51:21] here but it was the same it didn't have
[51:25] a lot of power deed then it became what
[51:27] a doctrine listen we live by a doctrine
[51:31] brother Brown said a church without a
[51:33] doctrine on church they meant so we have
[51:35] a doctrine here but we believe it's the
[51:38] truth not false but you know what so
[51:43] does the bad so does the Methodist so
[51:46] does the Pentecost so does the
[51:47] Presbyterian they all believe they're
[51:49] right or they wouldn't be going to them
[51:50] churches of course I know some of them
[51:53] now boy you see I don't know about you
[51:55] but you hear some mumbling going out in
[51:57] the denominational world
[51:58] we're tired of this we're tired of that
[52:01] we don't want to hear any more of this
[52:02] why are we still doing this why you know
[52:06] why they feel the pull of the aged they
[52:09] feel the pull of this age that we are we
[52:12] are what we fill the pull actually I
[52:16] want to say this today we are the pull
[52:18] we are the pull that's pulling because
[52:21] we're going to pull the grunt people
[52:22] dead people out of the ground we're
[52:24] gonna pull those Saints up you know not
[52:25] me with my you know more my chest stuck
[52:28] out it's going to be God through us but
[52:30] you know what it's going to be that we
[52:31] believe that that's happening see
[52:33] because I was thinking about this the
[52:35] other day you got to do the very simple
[52:40] we got to know where we came from what
[52:44] we're doing here and where we're going
[52:46] all right to me that's what the seals
[52:49] are doing even these first force just
[52:51] the first four seals tells me that
[52:53] somebody has come to a place that's
[52:56] brought God on the scene incarnate
[53:02] because at the end of the fourth seal
[53:05] the devil becomes incarnate he's kicked
[53:11] out of heaven amen
[53:15] he's kicked out of heaven and he comes
[53:16] down here it incarnates a human but
[53:20] before that happens God by this eagle
[53:22] anointing has got to incarnate a human
[53:27] humans as telling somebody this morning
[53:30] you said every week
[53:31] talk about the son of man listen to me
[53:33] everybody wake up we talk about the son
[53:35] of man we're in the son of man age we're
[53:37] in the Son of Man age do you really know
[53:39] what you're saying do you really know
[53:44] what you're saying hello son of man hole
[53:51] son of man aren't you guarding human
[53:54] flesh yours then you're part of this on
[53:56] a man ministry amen hey man you and I
[54:00] we're not looking for a son of man to
[54:03] come now we know brother branham was not
[54:07] the Son of man we know that a man he was
[54:12] a son of man so that the son of man
[54:16] could work through him to do what to
[54:19] tell you he was a son of man to tell you
[54:25] he was a son of man no he was
[54:30] proclaiming that you and I are the son
[54:34] of man because what the definition of
[54:39] the Son of Man is God in human flesh
[54:42] that's what you and I are here today
[54:45] because we are God in human flesh we
[54:51] don't believe that one day we will I say
[54:55] we don't we're trying that's why it
[55:00] takes a fivefold ministry remember I
[55:05] told you when I set my definition of
[55:06] fivefold ministry is like a road map and
[55:09] it's folded five times brother Luis if
[55:13] you only unfold it one time oh you'll
[55:15] see a piece of the map but you got four
[55:19] other folds as if you're gonna get
[55:21] wherever you're going you need all of
[55:23] them open all the folds have to be open
[55:27] to see where you came from you know what
[55:32] when you pull your phone out was it
[55:35] what's the first thing you said can I
[55:37] use your location
[55:41] you know what it wants to know where you
[55:44] at if you don't know where you add it
[55:48] can't tell you where you going
[55:50] okay so that's way God's the always
[55:53] cellphone stuff is just what God's
[55:54] already been doing all this GPS and all
[55:57] that stuff God's been using it for for
[55:59] since the since back in eternity he
[56:02] never needed to plug in and go I need to
[56:04] talk to you know it was all Wi-Fi hey
[56:08] man but I look it took to go back down a
[56:11] little bit please
[56:13] mmm mmm the other way the other way whoa
[56:16] whoa that put the brakes on cunning
[56:22] smart with the wisdom of God now we know
[56:26] the wisdom of man got us in trouble but
[56:28] the wisdom of God was already here
[56:30] because you can't discount that Martin
[56:32] Luther you said well Martin Luther was
[56:34] wrong Martin Luther wasn't all wrong
[56:36] Martin Luther was a man of God he was
[56:40] God in human flesh for his time a man
[56:44] but he just didn't have enough word to
[56:45] work with amen brother Brent said one
[56:48] time couldn't get all the way out what
[56:49] we couldn't couldn't get all the people
[56:51] out of the age but I'm telling you on
[56:54] this for sale it's got to show somebody
[56:56] has come out of the age because you
[56:59] can't take a rapture with a
[57:01] denominational idea you cannot do that
[57:04] you because you know why then the
[57:07] rapture is just an event for everybody
[57:09] then it's not a special thing for the
[57:12] bride it's just a if the Baptist's are
[57:14] going then we'll they're just going to
[57:15] go the same time we are Methodists and
[57:17] I'm not saying they won't I'm just
[57:19] telling you the rapture is for
[57:21] born-again Christians dead analyzed
[57:24] born-again Christians the bride remember
[57:30] I told you the other day that there's a
[57:31] difference in in the new birth and
[57:34] eternal life because the foolish virgin
[57:39] are not born again believers they're
[57:43] imparted eternal life sure the new birth
[57:46] is eternal life but the new birth to me
[57:49] is eternal life while you're alive in
[57:51] human flesh walking on the earth in this
[57:53] dimension
[57:54] amen be given eternal life you got to go
[57:57] somewhere else and wait remember even
[58:00] the foolish virgin knowing God knows
[58:02] he's gonna give him eternal life but
[58:04] they've got that compartment they got to
[58:06] stand
[58:06] they got stay dead for a thousand years
[58:09] but we don't know we don't I'm working
[58:16] on a sermon I was working on just back
[58:17] here a few minutes ago
[58:18] just one word we there's two weeds in
[58:25] the Bible one way is weave which are
[58:29] alive and remain until the coming of the
[58:32] Lord the other way is we'll do this and
[58:35] we'll do that I've been looking at in
[58:36] Genesis um you know Laban and then we
[58:38] will do this and we'll do that no it
[58:40] ain't we like that but we which are
[58:42] alive and remain are the what the chosen
[58:44] of God that have accepted and come
[58:47] through all this that we're talking
[58:49] about now we've come through all this
[58:50] and we're standing over here getting
[58:51] ready to take a rapture and we don't
[58:54] know anything you got to know where you
[58:59] come from what you doing here and no but
[59:03] then where are you going now the third
[59:06] beast that went out was the black horse
[59:09] power from God to combat him to combat
[59:11] the power of the black horse was a man
[59:13] cunning smart with the wisdom of God
[59:15] Martin Luther did come under Reformation
[59:19] right because he did restore everything
[59:21] he was a part though of restoration then
[59:25] all right
[59:25] excuse me say ma'am he was a part of
[59:27] restoration Luther Wesley was a part of
[59:30] restoration but they weren't full rent
[59:32] now we got full restoration I will
[59:34] restore what under the Eagle anointing
[59:38] will read brother Bram said only under
[59:40] as an eagle anointing can be we be fully
[59:42] restored amen cuz in the line aids they
[59:47] had the bonus of the line but yet they
[59:49] had to come into the ox which was a
[59:50] beast of burden then they had to come in
[59:51] the man then to the eagle they by all
[59:53] rights a man now a man is the smarter
[59:56] than any of the beasts he's smarter cuz
[59:59] he can outwit him mostly that's why
[1:00:02] Satan attached herself to that
[1:00:06] Satan's anointing and he annoys
[1:00:09] human-beings amen he anoints human
[1:00:14] beings and you know where he anoints him
[1:00:15] up that's why I was telling him this
[1:00:19] morning an anointed one it's not
[1:00:21] anointed in his soul that's right an
[1:00:28] anointed one is black in his soul but
[1:00:32] the Holy Ghost can anoint his spirit
[1:00:34] it's what brother Brown said in northern
[1:00:37] ones and make him what signs wonders
[1:00:38] preach the word Judas Judas was not a
[1:00:44] born-again believer but yet he had part
[1:00:47] of the ministry he preached for three
[1:00:49] and a half years almost with Jesus with
[1:00:52] signs with wonders so he was anointed on
[1:00:57] his flesh I don't even mean on his
[1:00:58] spirit realm amen
[1:01:00] so he's smarter he can outwit him mostly
[1:01:03] he's cunning shrewd and the age for the
[1:01:05] Dark Age now coming out from the Dark
[1:01:07] Age now where's the Dark Age right here
[1:01:10] coming from the Dark Age down to this
[1:01:12] other side where this black horse was
[1:01:16] riding when they charged for their
[1:01:18] sacrifices and all the money was just oh
[1:01:20] you know what it was now the next thing
[1:01:23] went out to come back to that beast was
[1:01:24] the face of a man smart educated shrewd
[1:01:27] fine anointed with that spirit of the
[1:01:29] day the box brother brown said here's
[1:01:32] the box they can only do what's inside
[1:01:35] the box all right anoint it with a spear
[1:01:38] that day you notice it but I want you to
[1:01:42] watch if I don't remember and I'm going
[1:01:44] to tell you now when we get into that
[1:01:45] our church age though you got to
[1:01:49] remember when you compartmentalize that
[1:01:50] we get a throne nobody else's how to
[1:01:54] throne they've had all this you've got a
[1:01:57] name it's not knowing you got Jezebel
[1:01:59] you when you come up to this our age
[1:02:01] there's a throne there and Jesus says
[1:02:05] you'll sit with me in my throne alright
[1:02:08] so we messing with none of this other
[1:02:11] stuff we got a throne and what is a
[1:02:13] throne throne means Dominion or power
[1:02:18] he went to combat him with the
[1:02:20] cunningness of God's wisdom with him
[1:02:22] that was the age of the Reformation
[1:02:24] Martin Luther John Wesley and so forth
[1:02:25] it was the Reformation Zwingli and well
[1:02:28] who all knocks Calvin and who all went
[1:02:31] out it was a cunningness now you watch
[1:02:33] exactly from the Dark Age from the
[1:02:35] Reformation this way that way send this
[1:02:37] way
[1:02:37] it was the shrewdness of man now
[1:02:40] somebody got hot if you drop your
[1:02:41] windows just a little bit that ain't
[1:02:43] part of the sermon that's not even
[1:02:45] interpolating he's telling somebody
[1:02:48] there open the windows hot all right
[1:02:51] scroll it on up I left that in there
[1:02:53] just for you laughs but notice it was
[1:02:55] the shrewdness of man now do you
[1:02:57] understand pull it up right there but
[1:03:00] you notice it was a shrewdness of man
[1:03:01] that do you understand now the third
[1:03:04] beast that Satan sent out he became
[1:03:06] shrewd to remember we've talked the
[1:03:10] whole three months about Satan attaching
[1:03:13] himself to what God's doing and that's
[1:03:16] what he is listen he's here today
[1:03:20] combining what we're doing today I'm not
[1:03:25] worried about all them back there I'm
[1:03:27] worried about today
[1:03:28] he's combating today what we're doing
[1:03:32] amen
[1:03:33] but notice it was just rudeness of man
[1:03:35] now do you understand the third beast
[1:03:36] that Satan sent out he became through to
[1:03:38] watch a measure of wheat for a penny
[1:03:40] three measures of barley for a penny see
[1:03:41] oh my see the money-making scheme the
[1:03:45] shrewdness to get the gold of the world
[1:03:46] and the wealth brought into it now we
[1:03:48] know that's what's happening in the
[1:03:49] natural all right what about the
[1:03:52] spiritual that's exactly the full field
[1:03:55] that's what began to charge for prayers
[1:03:57] for a place called purgatory prayed
[1:03:59] their ancestors out we know all about
[1:04:00] them in the church in the state was the
[1:04:03] same member of the church taking your
[1:04:05] property over and don't you see some of
[1:04:07] these evangelists these they still have
[1:04:09] that same anointing on them making old
[1:04:13] people give up their pensions and
[1:04:15] deeding their homes over to certain
[1:04:17] things that's the same anointing you
[1:04:20] know you know that guy down Louisiana
[1:04:23] I'm gonna be like him no I'm not you
[1:04:27] know Jesse Duplantis is his he needs a
[1:04:30] new jet
[1:04:32] to get to his believers faster so he
[1:04:35] needs about 15 million dollars to buy
[1:04:36] him a new jet to get and if you're on
[1:04:39] here your false
[1:04:40] I need a jet to get into my believers
[1:04:46] and you know what he'll get it that's
[1:04:51] the sad part why because that spirit of
[1:04:53] that anointing on the man the man not
[1:04:55] the inside on the man will get him what
[1:04:58] he wants
[1:04:58] so I brother Dale said I can tell you
[1:05:01] things in my life that I know I was
[1:05:02] anointed to be a preacher cuz but I used
[1:05:04] it wrong I can manipulate people you
[1:05:09] said preacher can't do that yeah we know
[1:05:10] how to do it don't worry we know how to
[1:05:11] go with that go down some of you yeah
[1:05:14] and now I me manipulate bad now I'm
[1:05:17] talking about we're trying to get you to
[1:05:18] see what God's trying to tell you now
[1:05:20] you can use this thing you look when
[1:05:23] people that come in preach and then
[1:05:24] they're not born again and they go out
[1:05:25] what's the first thing they do have an
[1:05:28] affair
[1:05:29] first thing it's women money women in
[1:05:32] popularity those three things will
[1:05:34] destroy a person if you don't watch out
[1:05:37] and and even with the Holy Ghost you
[1:05:39] still got to watch out because you got a
[1:05:41] spirit realm that's not born again
[1:05:43] alright so the same will here same with
[1:05:45] evangelist today they still come
[1:05:47] anointing on them making old people give
[1:05:48] up their pensions indeed their homes
[1:05:50] over to certain things if y'all got good
[1:05:52] pensions you know want you we need to
[1:05:53] have that brotherly kindness brotherly
[1:06:00] kindness I'm gonna read you the Bible
[1:06:02] remember I wrote I read you that when we
[1:06:04] went through brotherly kindness well the
[1:06:05] brown said brotherly kindness was that
[1:06:07] the first days had all things common why
[1:06:09] they brought all the money and put it at
[1:06:13] the feet of the preachers but you know
[1:06:16] what that was the box for their time
[1:06:18] it's not now that was the box for their
[1:06:20] time you know why brother Brown said
[1:06:22] that though he said so God knew that he
[1:06:25] needed the funds to fund people to go
[1:06:28] out and do we don't need that now we got
[1:06:31] an Internet we got all this other stuff
[1:06:32] we don't need to fund somebody to go
[1:06:34] somewhere you know but they did then
[1:06:36] when they were beginning to go out into
[1:06:38] these areas and you know you talk about
[1:06:40] the twelve disciples if you read how
[1:06:41] they all died they really only one or
[1:06:44] two died in Giroud
[1:06:45] the rest of them were like Turkey India
[1:06:50] Iraq I they were all in different areas
[1:06:52] when they got killed why because they
[1:06:54] were sent out to apostle God told him
[1:06:57] going to law world and preach the gospel
[1:07:00] they were doing exactly what God told
[1:07:02] him today and you know what Satan got
[1:07:05] him alone he killed him same way with me
[1:07:09] and you nice thing about this other name
[1:07:12] see he's a separation one if he gets you
[1:07:15] separate somewhere he can hurt you
[1:07:17] that's why we need to stay together we
[1:07:19] need to stay we need to stay as a church
[1:07:21] and stay as a as a unit amen because
[1:07:26] Satan loves to pull people to the side
[1:07:28] and you know you know what I'm done
[1:07:29] about because he's done you to me the
[1:07:31] same way
[1:07:31] now the beasts to combat it was man and
[1:07:34] we all know that this beast of man this
[1:07:38] power of man has Intel and intellectuals
[1:07:42] recognize that that Koecher that Martin
[1:07:44] Luther see what Martha Luther do God
[1:07:47] anointed Martin Luther let's adjust
[1:07:49] y'all live by faith Martin Luther once
[1:07:51] he run it through his filter told the
[1:07:55] Catholic Church said that's not the body
[1:07:58] that's not the blood it is communion he
[1:08:02] wasn't denying communion he throwed it
[1:08:05] down and said it's bread and wine it's
[1:08:07] not the body of Christ cuz it's been
[1:08:09] exaltedness it what do you put scripture
[1:08:11] back right amen so you say well Martin
[1:08:15] Luther was false no he was involved in
[1:08:17] that his his compartment was what to
[1:08:20] combat the Catholic Church protest to
[1:08:24] start the Protestant movement because
[1:08:28] it's been exalted said his right hand
[1:08:30] making intercession see wisdom man
[1:08:32] alright scroll it now let's get to here
[1:08:37] and we'll read this and a couple more
[1:08:38] scripture I'm just kind of getting
[1:08:40] everybody up right back up so we've
[1:08:42] already been through the first three
[1:08:43] ages the first one we some about
[1:08:45] justification sanctification baptism the
[1:08:47] Holy Ghost cuz look without the Holy
[1:08:50] Ghost you're not going in the rapture
[1:08:51] that's why I said the third seal is very
[1:08:53] important without the baptism of the
[1:08:54] Holy Ghost
[1:08:55] without that oil and wine you're not
[1:08:57] going in the rapture
[1:08:58] you might be given eternal life and you
[1:09:00] gonna have to stand before the white
[1:09:02] throne judgment because you're not clean
[1:09:04] you're not clean inside Jesus told me
[1:09:08] said you're not standing the judgment if
[1:09:10] you believe in me you have passed
[1:09:15] judgment you have passed from death unto
[1:09:18] life amen now the fourth piece now this
[1:09:21] is one we're coming to and then I'll
[1:09:23] read the commentary of the in Matthew
[1:09:26] and then we'll read revelations and then
[1:09:28] we'll stop and then we'll kind of get
[1:09:30] started on wincing up now the fourth
[1:09:33] beast that was sent forth now this is
[1:09:35] where we're starting now this would come
[1:09:37] up to now the fourth beast that was sent
[1:09:40] to combat the Antichrist in this last
[1:09:42] beast are you ready
[1:09:43] the last beast that was sent forth or
[1:09:45] the last power to combat the Antichrist
[1:09:48] now this is the last beast this is the
[1:09:50] last person
[1:09:51] this is the last anointing that the
[1:09:53] gentle Gentile church is going to get
[1:09:56] miss it you miss it okay my brother Dale
[1:10:02] says wake up now that sleepeth all of us
[1:10:06] shake ourselves man we need to be on the
[1:10:09] edge of our seat when we see these
[1:10:11] things that God's already give to it and
[1:10:13] then set on the edge of our seat for a
[1:10:18] ballgame and everything else this is the
[1:10:21] eternal life are the lack of it the last
[1:10:27] beast that was sent forth or the last
[1:10:28] power to combat the Antichrist so in
[1:10:31] other words the Antichrist will be
[1:10:33] destroyed in this church age hold on a
[1:10:37] minute temporarily
[1:10:40] because he's still alive but he'll be
[1:10:44] destroyed in us he'll have to go away
[1:10:47] amen
[1:10:48] who was that who was against the
[1:10:50] teaching of God the Antichrist was an
[1:10:53] eagle the last power to combat the
[1:10:54] Antichrist was an eagle the fourth
[1:10:57] living beast was an eagle now you just
[1:11:00] study the ages study the scripture it's
[1:11:02] an eagle and in the Bible the last age
[1:11:05] was a Eagle Age and God likens the
[1:11:08] Eagles to his prophet see now watch the
[1:11:11] last days
[1:11:12] egle age a revealer of the true words so
[1:11:15] we're right here seal number four we're
[1:11:17] right here thereby all right say man why
[1:11:20] hey I'm sorry I'm getting pretty tough
[1:11:22] before God moves to action like he did
[1:11:25] in the days of Noah he sent forth an
[1:11:27] eagle when he brought Israel in
[1:11:29] Pharaoh's army was ready to go he sent
[1:11:31] an eagle every time he sends an eagle at
[1:11:34] the last end of it here he sends an
[1:11:38] eagle again that's exactly with the word
[1:11:41] so how can you make it anything else he
[1:11:44] sends an eagle why a revealer of the
[1:11:47] truth that's been falling all through
[1:11:50] the age all through the age all those
[1:11:55] loose ends that's what we're living
[1:11:58] under we're not living under doubt we
[1:12:01] shouldn't be living under doubt and fear
[1:12:02] we should be living under the age that
[1:12:05] everything is to be made true and known
[1:12:08] listen
[1:12:10] this message that we have now it's not
[1:12:12] part truth Martin Luther's message was
[1:12:15] part truth John Wesley's message was
[1:12:18] part truth swingley Calvin all those
[1:12:21] great ones it was part truth this is all
[1:12:24] the truth it's all true so how in the
[1:12:28] world could the the odds or the man or
[1:12:31] whatever beast was riding how could it
[1:12:33] ever be revealed unto the Eagles time
[1:12:36] they had their place they were godly
[1:12:40] sent because remember the beast is a
[1:12:42] Holy Ghost power of the Holy Ghost in
[1:12:46] those ages just the same as anybody else
[1:12:49] was the line that was the original
[1:12:50] that's where the Antichrist comes up in
[1:12:53] combat then he raised up another power
[1:12:55] he sent a power to meet it then he
[1:12:57] raised up another pound he sent another
[1:12:58] power to meet it then at the last power
[1:13:01] he brings down the Eagle to restore the
[1:13:03] children back to the original faith
[1:13:05] again of the fathers the Eagle Age then
[1:13:08] did you notice there's no more beast
[1:13:12] that's all of it that's the end the
[1:13:19] rapture
[1:13:20] and then now if you take now revelations
[1:13:23] 10 one through seven I've been referring
[1:13:24] to it remembering the last messengers
[1:13:26] age what was to happen all the mysteries
[1:13:28] of God would be revealed the eagle amen
[1:13:30] now you see the four that rode
[1:13:32] that was a perfectly right you believe
[1:13:34] that and now here's he chained or each
[1:13:36] power that rode behind it and there's
[1:13:38] the scripture that shows what the
[1:13:39] enemy's rider did that's been revealed
[1:13:42] in these seals and also it's been
[1:13:44] revealed now that each beast power that
[1:13:47] God sent out to combat it hits exactly
[1:13:49] on the dot up to the eagle time all
[1:13:53] right so what I've been telling you for
[1:13:55] three months it's the truth people
[1:13:56] whether I said it or it doesn't matter
[1:13:59] it's the truth how everything's been set
[1:14:01] up this chart is not a maybe it's the
[1:14:07] truth
[1:14:12] the mother who tells you it's the truth
[1:14:18] yeah by alright so now let's go to
[1:14:22] Matthew Matthew 24 verse 9 to 14 we're
[1:14:30] going to read this and then we'll read
[1:14:32] revelations because we've been doing
[1:14:33] that I'm going to read it now and then
[1:14:35] we'll start on the fourth seal mmm next
[1:14:37] Sunday I mean no Wednesday night thank
[1:14:40] you for letting me do any because I was
[1:14:41] wondering how he's gonna cram all this
[1:14:43] in here then shall they deliver you up
[1:14:46] to be afflicted now look this is the
[1:14:48] fourth seal Jesus is preaching the
[1:14:52] fourth seal so this is what we get this
[1:14:56] is specific this is for me and this is
[1:14:58] us this is the fourth seal in Matthew 24
[1:15:02] remember brother Brown said Matthew
[1:15:03] brother Branham preached two seals in
[1:15:05] Matthew 24 don't look at me with your
[1:15:07] mouth open
[1:15:09] read the cell book it's what he tells us
[1:15:12] I even wrote him in my when he was doing
[1:15:16] when he was on tape I could I sit there
[1:15:18] and underline and put it for sale one
[1:15:19] single to seal three okay anyways
[1:15:22] brother Branham said this that this is
[1:15:25] the fourth seal so watch it being the
[1:15:27] fourth seal but watch the characteristic
[1:15:29] of this age right here then shall they
[1:15:31] deliver you up to be afflicted and they
[1:15:33] shall kill you
[1:15:34] we're not done yet they may kill some of
[1:15:37] us we're not done yet and ye shall be
[1:15:41] hated of All Nations for my namesake
[1:15:44] and then shall many be offended I'll
[1:15:49] think about the people in the message
[1:15:50] and then shall many be offended and
[1:15:54] shall betray one another
[1:15:56] I've always said we're gonna our
[1:15:58] betrayal is going to be from inside
[1:16:00] Jesus's betrayal was from inside the
[1:16:04] greatest betrayal that ever was came
[1:16:06] from inside any betrayal you look at
[1:16:08] anybody in history the greatest betrayal
[1:16:10] is somebody that was a friend or
[1:16:12] something I was inside I've always said
[1:16:13] that we've got Jesuit priests in there
[1:16:15] in the message that they're just hid
[1:16:17] they'll show this I may be one you got
[1:16:22] to discern that I don't think I'm smart
[1:16:26] enough to be a Jesuit and then show by
[1:16:28] telling you that I'm not one and then
[1:16:31] shall many be offended and shall betray
[1:16:33] one another and shall hate one another
[1:16:35] look at the hatred even in this message
[1:16:38] people that hate hate each other and
[1:16:40] many false prophets shall arise hello
[1:16:43] and shall deceive many
[1:16:46] look at all the false doctrine listen
[1:16:49] I'm telling you one more time if it's a
[1:16:50] false doctrine it didn't come from God
[1:16:52] came through the devil but people sit
[1:16:56] under it we've been given the truth the
[1:17:02] pure truth and because iniquity shall
[1:17:07] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[1:17:12] now hang on a minute I got my emphatic
[1:17:16] dag lot it says the love of many will
[1:17:21] cool where's revelations tell us he said
[1:17:28] you're neither cold or hot in other
[1:17:33] words you couldn't you were hot but
[1:17:35] you're cooling down and I'd rather you
[1:17:38] just going to be cold but you VIN that's
[1:17:40] Oh lukewarm water come on people
[1:17:43] everybody drink lukewarm water yeah
[1:17:45] Rebecca me too I don't see how in the
[1:17:47] world boy
[1:17:47] helm drinks Coca Cola's 150° I just
[1:17:51] don't see that God takes a special
[1:17:58] anointing I guess but you see how these
[1:18:06] when brother Brown said the Bible became
[1:18:08] a brand new book don't you think that
[1:18:09] when that prophet of God read these
[1:18:11] scriptures for years preach sermons for
[1:18:14] years but when God opened that seal to
[1:18:16] him it wasn't just that that seal was an
[1:18:18] antichrist
[1:18:19] it was that seal had covered things that
[1:18:22] he had not brother Dale said how many
[1:18:24] times have you read something I think
[1:18:25] they've changed the Bible 100 times
[1:18:27] myself a day cuz you read something you
[1:18:30] go
[1:18:31] I didn't read I read the whole book of
[1:18:32] revelations I didn't read that all right
[1:18:35] I read class the mystery God revealed
[1:18:37] and then he brings a quote out or
[1:18:40] another brother brings a quote out and
[1:18:41] you go they just take much they just put
[1:18:44] that in the book I mean really but you
[1:18:48] know what it is it's in the box you get
[1:18:54] it when you need it that's why we go
[1:18:58] over and over and over and over stop me
[1:19:02] in a minute over and over why cuz it's
[1:19:06] always been there but you know what we
[1:19:10] we read over it and it's not our time to
[1:19:13] get that I just have to see that it's
[1:19:15] not my time to get that point right
[1:19:17] there but then somebody else will bring
[1:19:19] it in the next service or Bluest brother
[1:19:21] Louisa brother Aaron somebody brother
[1:19:22] Bob will bring it you go where do you
[1:19:26] get that from we got it from the Bible
[1:19:28] because it was written in it but many
[1:19:31] shall went in the love of many shall wax
[1:19:32] cold lukewarm but he that shall endure I
[1:19:36] like this is one of brother Claude best
[1:19:39] statements he said the only way we're
[1:19:41] gonna know if we're saved is to do that
[1:19:44] right there but he that shall endure
[1:19:47] unto the end we're in the end he that
[1:19:53] shall endure to the end the same shall
[1:19:56] be saved and this gospel the kingdom
[1:20:00] shall be preached in all
[1:20:01] the world for a witness unto all nations
[1:20:03] and then shall the end come he's telling
[1:20:10] us the Bible told her Jesus told us in
[1:20:14] so many words preaching the fourth seal
[1:20:17] that the rapture was going to take place
[1:20:18] in the fourth seal but we couldn't read
[1:20:20] that we couldn't read that until a
[1:20:24] prophet came told us about the seal told
[1:20:28] us Jesus had preached it and there he's
[1:20:29] telling us the end she'll come and then
[1:20:32] that all right then shall the income
[1:20:36] revelations 3 this is the anointing to
[1:20:40] this age now we know it but we're going
[1:20:41] to read it again and until the Angel the
[1:20:44] Church of the Laodiceans write these
[1:20:47] sayings saith the Amen
[1:20:48] what is Amen so be it but a man is
[1:20:51] finality when we finish a prayer brother
[1:20:56] Larry what do we say amen what's the
[1:21:00] last thing it says in the Bible over in
[1:21:01] the Book of Revelations what is it 22 or
[1:21:03] 23 what does it say Amen
[1:21:05] okay so we're coming to the end these
[1:21:08] things saith the Amen the faithful and
[1:21:10] true witness the beginning of the
[1:21:11] creation of God now who was that who was
[1:21:13] the beginning of the creation of God God
[1:21:17] in human flesh Son of Man amen well that
[1:21:22] baby was born he went born a man and
[1:21:25] then turned into something he was the
[1:21:28] son of man he was a God in human flesh
[1:21:31] at the beginning at the beginning of the
[1:21:34] creation of God so that's what we get I
[1:21:35] know that works that thou art neither
[1:21:37] cold nor hot just what he said here in
[1:21:38] Matthew I would that thou wert cold or
[1:21:41] hot so then because thou art lukewarm
[1:21:43] and neither cold nor hot I will spew
[1:21:45] thee out of my mouth because now since I
[1:21:47] am rich and increased with Goods and
[1:21:49] have need of nothing right don't you
[1:21:52] know don't teach me I know everything
[1:21:54] don't teach me nothing I don't have to
[1:21:57] come to church I don't have to listen to
[1:21:58] you whatever and have need of nothing
[1:22:01] and knowest not that thou art wretched
[1:22:03] he's telling us what to look for right
[1:22:10] because what is worse you know if I know
[1:22:14] I'm naked I can do something about
[1:22:16] it's like what they say if you got a guy
[1:22:19] walking down the road and you ain't got
[1:22:20] to stitch your clothes on and you tell
[1:22:21] him it stopping telling me naked and
[1:22:23] he's like I'm fully clothed see the
[1:22:27] deception that's the deception that
[1:22:29] Satan has been trying to get each one of
[1:22:31] us do what he's trying to get us to quit
[1:22:34] believing he's trying to get his quit
[1:22:40] believing well we're now fifty-four
[1:22:42] years since the Prophet come and gone
[1:22:44] 1965 to 2018 well fifty three years you
[1:22:49] know I'm hit Wheaton was once another 20
[1:22:53] or 30
[1:22:55] well Lottie all be dead unless she's 150
[1:23:00] Jeanne I'm just sorry that's just the
[1:23:03] way it is when you get in your seventies
[1:23:06] and you start talking about another 30
[1:23:07] years and that's now that's when you
[1:23:09] become an unbeliever that's right okay
[1:23:11] yeah did you say i'ma live another 30
[1:23:14] years now I'm will not believe that
[1:23:17] because of time I'm talking about the
[1:23:20] Word of God we got to believe what it
[1:23:21] already says I counsel thee to buy of me
[1:23:23] gold tried in the fire gold gold is the
[1:23:26] most precious thing to me to me what
[1:23:28] he's telling us I've give you gold I've
[1:23:32] give you the message of the hour I've
[1:23:34] give you pure gold and he says I counsel
[1:23:41] thee to buy of me so we got to go to him
[1:23:44] to get it amen
[1:23:47] try it in the fire that means you're not
[1:23:49] gonna have it easy that thou must be
[1:23:51] rich now that rich it's different than
[1:23:55] that other rich and white raiment that
[1:23:59] thou must be clothed and that the shame
[1:24:05] of thy nakedness do not appear and
[1:24:08] anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that
[1:24:11] thou may see now that see is is
[1:24:14] understand you know that it's not
[1:24:16] physically seeing as many as I love I
[1:24:19] rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore
[1:24:21] and repent behold I stand at the door
[1:24:25] and knock that didn't say if you hear my
[1:24:28] knock
[1:24:30] have you noticed that it doesn't say if
[1:24:33] you hear my knock so in other words he's
[1:24:36] not just going the knock is his voice
[1:24:42] every time we come to church we hear let
[1:24:48] me in because he says right here but
[1:24:51] hold on stands the door and knocking if
[1:24:53] any man hear my voice and open the door
[1:24:56] not to knock the voice and open the door
[1:25:00] I will come in to him now it's like I
[1:25:03] told you before if I was the Holy Ghost
[1:25:05] I have done knock the door down let me
[1:25:10] and I want to see what's behind that
[1:25:11] door but God's not that way
[1:25:13] he said if you hear my voice and open
[1:25:15] the door
[1:25:18] volunteer open the door I will come in
[1:25:21] and we'll stop not just come in what
[1:25:25] commune will sup with him and here with
[1:25:29] me to him that overcometh will I grant
[1:25:31] here we go to sit with me in my throne
[1:25:34] we see that says in we know that's in
[1:25:36] not on in my throne what is his throne
[1:25:40] the throne - son of man
[1:25:41] that's his throne right that's a
[1:25:44] Dominion that we're looking at even as I
[1:25:48] also overcame and I'm sitting down with
[1:25:50] my father in his throne now we know
[1:25:53] there's a conversion of Thrones here

[1:32:30] message but you know what that does no

[1:32:49] that is no good the prophets message
[1:32:51] there's no good unless it's live the
[1:32:57] Bible is no good unless it's lived we
[1:33:02] must live that prophet give his life to
[1:33:06] preach this message so that you and I
[1:33:10] can get the truth and not be afraid not
[1:33:14] have fear if you're afraid somebody's
[1:33:17] gonna come in from the denominational
[1:33:19] world and you know God forbid brother
[1:33:21] Dale have the lapse of memory and let
[1:33:26] somebody come in a denominational person
[1:33:29] preach which I don't it doesn't matter
[1:33:31] if you do and they're gonna deceive you
[1:33:36] come on I'm afraid now I don't want to
[1:33:40] listen that preacher on the oh no on the
[1:33:42] radio I he might he might what tell you
[1:33:47] something you hadn't already heard come
[1:33:50] on people that's why I'm saying that
[1:33:52] it's telling us the church downstairs we
[1:33:56] don't need to be boastful okay and get
[1:34:00] the big head because we know who that is
[1:34:01] that's the devil but we are let's put
[1:34:04] ourselves in the box we are the chosen
[1:34:07] people for this age we could have been
[1:34:11] in any church today now I'm not talk
[1:34:13] about Luther George I'm talking about
[1:34:14] the message of the hour we could have
[1:34:16] been in any church today we could have
[1:34:18] stayed in the denominational world or we
[1:34:20] could be out in the world but even
[1:34:22] standing in the denominational world and
[1:34:23] you don't get all the truth but we've
[1:34:26] got all the truth we've got all the
[1:34:29] truth right here
[1:34:30] and I'm not saying right here
[1:34:32] geographically right here I'm saying in
[1:34:33] this message of the hour with a fivefold
[1:34:36] ministry we have a message that'll
[1:34:38] change our body no one else had that
[1:34:41] opportunity no one they didn't even
[1:34:47] listen the chosen of God didn't even
[1:34:51] understand when he had a body change are
[1:34:54] you gonna restore the kingdom are you
[1:34:55] coming back who you stand with us you
[1:34:57] leaving
[1:34:59] really Peters went fishing is that Jesus
[1:35:04] well he's dead the two from a mass
[1:35:09] how would you like to walk with a man
[1:35:11] had been raised from the dead
[1:35:12] got a glorified body and it was Jesus
[1:35:15] that they had followed before and then
[1:35:18] he walks with him they said for the
[1:35:20] better part of a day and they didn't
[1:35:23] know him to what they even in time he
[1:35:28] did something to prove who he was in the
[1:35:31] evening time when they went in the door
[1:35:34] of the house he did something like he
[1:35:38] had done when he was here he meant in
[1:35:43] the evening time it's when it was
[1:35:46] revealed who he was
[1:35:49] amen and then you know what they went
[1:35:52] told everybody and guess what nobody
[1:35:54] probably believed them they're not gonna
[1:35:56] believe that you and I are gonna take a
[1:35:57] body change you listen
[1:36:02] I'm in God's box I'm in the box I need
[1:36:06] to be in and that box will take me to a
[1:36:10] body change if I stay in the box
[1:36:13] amen that's a problem we want to get
[1:36:15] over in someone else's box no I'm
[1:36:17] staying this box right here this box and
[1:36:19] what's the ezreal doing really doesn't
[1:36:21] matter what Israel do it
[1:36:22] sure watch them but listen anything that
[1:36:25] happens in this whole world political
[1:36:29] religious even demonic power we'll get
[1:36:33] into it the fourth seal because it's the
[1:36:34] pale horse but it all depends on what me
[1:36:38] and you do it's a reaction to an action
[1:36:42] the action is coming from us the
