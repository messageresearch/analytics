tonight amen I'm not going to you know my style they call me the helicopter preacher in the south I see I'm trying to live up to that reputation now so I got two girls up and down so when I get started I'm going to start when I get ready to stop I'm just going to land you can go on so we trust God but if you got your Bibles tonight I'm going read from two places the book of uh St Mark second chapter and I'm read one I mean four down to the 11th verse and then I'm going to read Hebrews 10 and verse 38 and 39 and it reads like this and and the Bible said the fourth verse Mark the 2 chapter verse 4 it said and when they could not come now unto him for the Press they uncovered the roof where he was and when they had broke it up they let down the bed where where in the sick of the py laid and when Jesus saw their faith said unto the sick of deposit son thy sins be forgiven thee Hallelujah but there were certain of the scribes said in their reason in their heart how does this man speak why does this man does speak blasphemy who can forgive sin but God only and immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they had reason within themselves he said unto them why ye reason these things in your heart right for it is easy to say to the sick of theity thy sins be forgiven thee or to say rise take up thy bed and walk but that ye may know that the son of man had power on Earth to forgive sin he said to the sick of the apology I say unto thee rise and take up thy bed and go thy way into thy house Hallelujah uh Hebrews 10 Hebrews the 10th chapter I'm going to read 38 and 39 verse Hebrews 10 verse 38 and 39 it says the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul has no plure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto predition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul let's pray our gracious father help me one more time to surrender my spirit my body and my soul to you father help me to get myself out of the way Lord now father God I give you all my strength Lord Jesus take full control in Jesus Christ name we pray amen God bless you may be seated one moment thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God this evening I like this we started with the scripture the Bible says here that how if we were reading the scripture here the Bible teaches of that here go Jesus this man they to the roof off this building and they brought down the sick of Theos and this man was sick Jesus say I heal you uh Jesus turned around said thy sins be forgiven and when they hear this they say it ain't no man can do that but God so we find out he and I tell from I took if you notice then I went for I went to Hebrews the Bible say hallel the just shall live by faith and the Bible says if any man draw back my soul have no pledge in him and I want to take for a title tonight leaving forgiveness and bout in the past right on leaving forgiveness and bout in the past right and I want to use this reason I took this thought here because I thank you my brother I reason I took this because I begin as you go around and you begin to preach and you meet people and you begin to realize what people a or what they in their spiritual uh their spiritual growth I find that the thing I find most as I travel with people there that when you go there they all the time coming back for the holy ghost or they all the time coming back oh they always they come in all the time trying to get something that they say that they already had yeah and I looked at this and I begin to realize here I thought what calleda people to go back to the past and I looked at I begin to think on them things and I begin to realize pressure is what CA people to turn back on God cuz I begin to realize Under Pressure normally when pressure build up people either that's not go either go all the way with God or they go back to some habit that they had before they come out or they maybe they feel like I cannot do it no more I might well go back and do it I will have a more fun doing this or they'll turn back to some evil habit that God done brought them out of H so we and we begin to really here pressure what builds us up and the thing the thing of it is the reason we have it cuz people don't go all the way with God they don't go all the way with God they come out and they want to come out under justification and they want to believe under justification H and they begin to they come out they get baptized they come out Hallelujah they they they go for the they ask God to take away their sins hallelujah or or they repent of their sin and when they do this God take away their past sins God take away your past but if you notice it don't say nothing about your future Hallelujah because you got your past sins and you get baptized how go through the water be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and you the the revelation of deal when you go to the water you got to go to the water with Revelation amen H because when you go you got to realize when I L when I go it get baptized that old man he going to die and when I come up out of the water I'm going to be a new creature I'm going to begin to walk a new life so we begin to look in now I hear that so we begin to realize that people go to justification and when they get to repentance no doubt they feel like well that's all I got to do no you got to keep going you don't care you cannot stop just at repentance how you got to go to sanctification how do you clean up your life how do clean everything out but once you clean everything out you still going to have battles right amen you know people say well I still fight that same Spirit of alcohol I see by the spirit of there how in word you sanctify how remember here you still is not right yet you're not all the way to the baptism of the Holy Ghost come and once the baptism of the Holy Ghost come he come down and burn out ever desire that the devil have no more power to hold you back I begin to go here and I look at these things here and I begin to realize here that we got to go all the way and I begin to take some example why people turn back why people fight giving up and turn back how because the devil know what you done yesterday how remember wonder why the devil fight you with your past because that's what he know about you he don't know your future he don't know you come to from God and you going back to God he don't know that but he know what you done yesterday he know what you done five minutes ago so he can take your path and bow to you over and over remember here he's the principalities of the earth he's there he he what you done he hear what you say but he he knows your past but he don't know your future amen say the devil's accused other brother y he stand there night and day accusing you of what you done done right of something you done in your past something you never let go something he bring back here and to hold you back from going on to in the word of God to keep this over your head to keep you Bound in the past H so the devil use your path to hold you back from going all the away with God how do heay he take something that some mistake you made and he take that thing and he keep that thing right there and keep driving it in you so you got to shake yourself H you got to realize when I came to Christ I ain't got no pass let look at this like this I took this thought right here and I begin to realize here when people get under pressure they normally turn back and I looked at egpt when they come out of Egypt when Moses went down and brought him out by the hand of God how the people were rejoicing because they seen the mighty power of Almighty Jehovah God how do they seen the great signs and wonders and they come out shouting and they was having a Revival till they got to the Red Sea when they got to the Red Sea the things started changing how because now there's a circumstance that before them there's something that stop stop them from going over right and with the Red Sea so the Red Sea caused a problem but they a where the problem started right the problem started behind them when they he Pharaoh men coming on them horses right they begin to realize we going to get crushed yeah we might have well stayed in Egypt we could have died back there how did they they start thinking about going backwards instead of going forward but God told Moses the K the peoples say the Egyptian that you see today you ain't going to see no more forever HJ that's what God trying to get us to do he's trying to get us to be still and watch that devil that You' been dealing with today if you speak still you won't see him no more trying to get us to go all the way with God so I begin to go look here and I begin to real here so he fighting us every day with the past he fighting us he trying to keep from going all the way with God how do we find here Paul said you did run well but what hinder you now right in in the word hind means to B back behind or hold back or frustrate lack of Revelation to go forward yeah Hallelujah in other word Paul say you did run well but what made you hold back what made you begin to turn around and say I'm not able to make this rapure how you you start to run don't give up don't look back because Faith ain't got no reverse in it Faith does not have a reverse if you say I believe God here you are saying I'm going all the way right right cuz in other words that what Jesus was trying to teach you he said my soul has no pleasure in them that draw back because going backwards is not Faith right Faith either go forward or it go up how we begin to look here and I begin to realize that we fight these things and I'm going to give we we deal you'll see where we're going in a minute so I begin to think so we find here that because the devil know our weaknesses and he know our path so if you notice when you come to get prayer for for healing you ever thought about this you come up and get prayer for healing you accept what the word said about your healing and and all of a sudden you feel a a peace a ease a free right you be say wow man I say man whatever it was it left me man I breathing it come back nor I feel I feel that God healed me I feel that God healed me I feel that God donees something for me but as soon as you get home yeah and all of a sudden that demon come back to try to put the same symptoms on you because it took Faith to take it off and it take your unbelief to bring it back so he tried to bring back Sy of your past hallu you said well I still feel I got I feel I was delivered in but now I feel like simp and when that simp come back order to keep it but don't sign for the demon H keep your confession I am healed by his scripes all the demon have the ability to come back on you tell we talking about in other words the same faith that takes it away your unbelief with Resurrection that Spirit now I begin to realize here we we want to go all the way with God and we realize here we don't only thing that find that hold people back for going all the way with God H what hold people in the pth is Fe right they fear that God cannot keep what he promised right how they fear that God in way I would hold on but I ain't for sure that God will keep his word first of fear is the evidence of things appearing to be real when it's not there right I said your p is like a ghost right and everybody know how I feel about ghost I don't do the ghost thing I mean I'm just that way I just don't mess around with things with you know everybody got their own little little little Pat PE they got to deal with mine just Happ to be ghost I ain't worri about the things I can hit this the things I hit my fist go through but this is it hey yeah you said what it you said brother that ain't nothing your imagination that well it come from something from the past H only reason I believe that it because somebody told me there and all of a sudden as a child it me they took a grip that I don't tell my children Spirit uh a grandkids uh scary stuff like that because I don't want them to be B by that spirit cuz it took me a long time it took me a long time to overcome that spirit because I just I used to get in the house by myself and all all of a sudden I can hear things walking upstairs you said brother you say oh you that that that's crazy but brother that was that that was that cover from something from the past find people that Scar the dogs right of find what caus that something happen that cause them to take on a spirit of fear and every time a a dog get around they get nervous my wife is scared the death of a dog right Hallelujah so it's something that happen that caus you to F and it only come from the past it come that way with churches not when people come from another church the thing that they fight I'm not going to let this pastor do with the next one do cuz they always go back and judge it by the past how so we begin to real here the past is what people hold hold people back for go fear is what hold people back from going on with God Amen now I begin to look here so I begin to think on them things on fear how the F hinders us something of the past something that we heard of the past that won't let us go on Hallelujah in other word something that's holding you back or bound Hallelujah bound is the it means to bind you in a change bind You by a spirit that you cannot shake loose up andone but we are not coming to be bound by the spirit we come to be loose how do the word come to loose us how what that what the word of God come to do it's not to bound you down or or tie you up it come to loose you from the thing how they begin to go look here I begin to think here so we begin to look at pharoh now we if phoh Works in many different Realms and the in the if we notice in the Book of Numbers when they got ready to go across the over the promised land all of a sudden they come back whereever they that the lamb was there but because they've been hearing about the Giants it had already built up a spirit not to go forward they've been hearing about these Giants on the other side how big they were and the preachers come back oh yeah preaching F to them or telling them that we cannot take the land because we went over there we seen the men they were that big some of them they that big some of them you know when people imagination make things bigger than it is I got a I had a picture for years in my house and this man caught a trout and he was he was looking at this TR and whoever draw the picture they draw the picture and it was asking the man how big it was and he said it was a man standing behind him said just the way people mind go H he what the man that behind him I was looking at the fish in the buget it was about that big he said that big oh H you know how it is with our deer hunters we have a problem with it how big was your deer it was a monster man it was a spike but it's the way the human mind work it always it it what San holds Us by how do it make the thing look bigger than what it is how do something to keep you from going on so I begin to realize here I begin to think on these things here I want to deal with the to hold people back the most people going deal with the spirit we need to deal with the spirit to hold people back the most hallelu so I begin to look here and I study this and I begin to study in the past and then words and Jesus said here uh and when Jesus was deal with these things here he says here in St Matthew 6:15 if they would not forgive men of their trespasses then will your heavenly father forgive you of your trespasses so did he use the word did I here I begin to say let's go on a little further and then look what hold people back and I took it here if you remember the story King Saul Hallelujah now the thing of it was with Saul and David was that Saul should have been giving David praise oh yeah right David the one that solved the problem for Israel Hallelujah David the one went out there slew Goliath how David went out there and took it on the word of the Lord to face a giant that sa should had done himself and David took the word of God and brought this un Su down to his knee and cut his head off sa should have been happy right what it is what I'm trying to say a lot of time we worri about who the preacher is to kill the giant don't matter who the preacher is to kill it as long as the J got killed if brother Wayne kill it brother Sam kill it or any other preacher bring that demon down we ought to say thank God that God got a gift in the body to get rid of this child but what it is we won't do that if I ain't the one to kill him then I got a problem but the point the problem is let's give praise to the gift that God used to kill it because that giant is the problem not the gift so so should have glorified and begin to say David thank you thank God he raised you up to do the job thank you David Hallelujah that you had enough faith in God Hallelujah to stand out that Faith Goliath I want you to set at my Royal table I want you to eat from my Royal seat I want to hey give David the best house get David I want David to know that Israel is Happy what he doneen but something happened right the caus David to withdraw I mean Calla Saul to withdraw on David and we find out here that Saul had a problem and and and we find out here that what caused the problem was the church the church because the women was the type of the church and if you notice here the women begin to say David killed his 10,000 right and so his thousands right and what happened to that it brought a spirit of a alt against David Without a Cause come on and the Bible said we can be hat it Without a Cause come on without even doing something to people sometime they hate you that's right but we cannot let that hold us back amen then we begin to look here an ALT come and it was a false alt on so it was something he was believing about David and David hadn't done nothing to him right and that all was the thing all is something that somebody done to you in the past that's how you get old somebody done something to you you and you never let go of it h you were never able to overcome that thing that happened to you in the past right well if you don't let go of it you can't go no forth right because the Bible say here when Jesus begin to teach on the past this is what he said this is how he taught it his disciples was coming down the road one day and Jesus came up on the Fig Tree and Jesus seen this fig tree and Jesus said I curse you that no man eat here after never eat from you again right his disciples was with Jesus when this happened and the disciples looked at this thing they says what's wrong with him what's wrong with the master every time I turn around he's saying something don't make sense because they were looking to see the evidence from the outside but when you cat a demon it's cat from the inside you don't kill a demon from the outside you got to go down to the root Jesus killed the tree from The Roots so the disciples the Bible say they went on you know they went on had church or whatever they did and they came back the same way I'm sure the disciples going to make sure that Jesus went back that way cuz in their mind for them to be thinking about that tree it had to be already in their mind they wanted to go back CU they wanted to see what happened right how and all of a sudden they go down the road and Peter knew the spot I made sure I Mark that spot in my head when I get back to that tree I'm going to make see what happened to that tree how all of a sudden they get back to that tree and the Bible say how Peter remember what Jesus said and Peter said the tree had went it away you other word no evidence but when Jesus said it the tree already was dead how when God tell you you're healed a lot of times you don't see no evidence but when the word tell you you heal you accept your healing so the word can go to work Hallelujah it don't might not happen right there it might not happen the next day but you accept it right there show the word can go to work so Jesus says here I want you to noce the story that Jesus gave Jesus when they said the tree withed way Jesus didn't go into a laot he didn't go into a lot of this why the tree with away I done this Jesus says have faith in God hallelujah he went right to the he went right to the source he said have faith in God he said if you believe and have faith and not doubt in your heart he said you can say to this mountain be I removed and it shall obey you he goes and start bring it in then he brings it to something that will hold you back right he said but if you come to this mountain and you got old right he said wait a minute it ain't going to work for you right because something is is in you to hold you back from going on with God it's something that if you got hold all of your heart you bring your gift he they first go back and get that thing made right so nothing can stand between you and the power of the Holy Ghost H how is what holds the back right till we begin to go look here and just take a step for so we begin to realize here it's always been things to try to hold us back to keep us from going all the way with God the past is always what hell people about people can't let go of something that they done and they feel like God ain't going to forgive me because I can't accept that I'm forgiven right and if you can't accept you forgiven God can't help you that's right first all you got to believe that he can do it and if you can believe that he done it for you then you might as well whatever your second say there lay it on the altar say Here I Am Lord take amen but people don't do that right they always trying to R it out they TR the devil come back and say boo they always remember well i' to had this I know I'm not good enough how long did it take you to figure out you wasn't good enough sometime it take a person whole life time to come to the Revelation I am not good enough if you was good enough Christ didn't need to come and take your place he knew that you were not good enough so he came himself to take your place so I begin to go here let just take this here so we begin to realiz passes what hold people back we got we must move on if we realize here we realize here when Jesus came people the people that Jesus was trying to lose they were help back in the past right right if you know when Jesus come to bring them for the light they say Abraham be our father you see what I'm saying they wouldn't want to go forward they was looking in the past H We Believe Abraham we be we be Moses children hu they always went back to the past we had Mana in the wilderness Hallelujah so a they was back in the past the reason they can stay with Mana because they never cross Jordan if they would have crossed Jordan they would have had the old corn only thing they remember was man but when they went on the other side they had eat old corner of the land and they never crossed over right right so they could not go no further than Moses right they could not see the position that Joshua C them over there and positionally plac them in their promises so they stayed on the other side of the Jordan and they can remember we at mana and Jesus said every one of you that had Mana is dead right he said your father had man in the wilderness and every one of them is dead H because it tough more than man except you eat my flesh and drink my blood and the Bible says it come to finally from that time from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him went back to what they didn't quit going to church no they didn't quit going to church they just didn't follow the word and when they went backwards how did my soul have no p in there that go back he scra name off the bookly the Bible tell us one place the remember lot wife remember lot wife what about lot wife she was too called up in the when the angel come to bring Miss lot out Miss lot was living it up even though that solom night condition down there she was willing to deal with all that perverted living just to have money to have a good time so she didn't really so the angel come down there and gave her commit to lot told lot to tell M lot to come out and not look back now I want to tell you what Miss lot brought her body out if she could have got a hard to come with us she would have made it but she come out with a body and L a ho back there I said just like people come to church a lot of time they bring the body to church and the heart still at Walmart right now if you can get your hard to leave Walmart can come to church with you we have a good time tonight but the way people do the thing that they need to do a lot of time they breaking the body and they doing something else but when you bring your body to church bring your heart the same way so God can speak to you and we begin to go here look here so they you know the story Miss lot she came out but her ho never came out and what ho was her treasure was so because she never let go of her pass right come on amen the ability to turn back on God was in her right so she had something in her that could turn back on God because she never brought a heart with her right so she could turn back cuz that's what her heart was and that's what her pull was so the Bible say she turned back and she turned it to Pilla people let us make up our mind that we going to go all the way but God we not got to make up our mind that we going to if I'm going to start out with him give me a Revelation Lord to go all the way hallelu Lord let go of my past Hallelujah I need to let go of my past you can not undo what you'd undone so it ain't no use to you putting yourself in chain on something you can't undo if you going undo it that Christ didn't need to come I I looked here when Paul came if you notice Paul said these words he said though we are angel preach any other gospel unto you and what we have preached let it be a curse amen why because Paul was preaching present truth and if an angel come and change what they preach they'll holy you back from going on and then would the do is that why we got to have the truth because the truth come to set you free H if they're not preach the truth you still in the past right so Paul said it like this if you remember when Paul went up through acts acts the 19th Chapter he found some Believers that need to be loose yeah he found Believers but they was bound and he came and you know the story he came up through the upper coast of Kip and then when he got there he found certain disciple that had the letter right but they needed the mechanic the Dynamics they had the mechanics right but they didn't have the Dynamics and without the dynamic they could not go no further they was bound thank the Paul came and what the Paul says to them had you received the Holy Ghost s you believe and watch their testimony we not even know that be of a holy ghost we not even such as her of there even be a thing of the Holy Ghost and Paul said all right then what would you baptize in see people say baptism don't mean something oh yes don't let the devil tell you that lie to hold you back that's right Hallelujah so he said then what would you baptized in and they said we was baptized under JN Paul say all right John he baptize you under repentance looking for one to come to baptize you with the Holy Ghost Fire he said they when they heard this right they were re-baptized come on in the name of Jesus Christ right and they reive the Holy Ghost amen so the devil knew it was a truth to the devil is he he he's smart the Bible said better be wiser than him it ain't that he's not smart so what do he do he know what held them back he knew it lies in the secret of uh receiving the Holy Ghost right so what do he do he goes up at 325 ad what do he tap the baptism come on because he knew if they didn't get baptized right they couldn't go forward that's right and if they don't get the Holy Ghost they still in the past right so what he did he changed the baptism right 32258 let's change it right CU one time the Catholic Church baptized say we did right so what he did he said if I change it then Paul then conation 18 say though we Angel changes gospel come on then what do it do it pull them people back in the past that why they have church today come on Amen all of the denomination that baptized in the trinity they still in the past that's right because father is not a name come on son is not a name the holy spirit is not a name it's a person Jesus Christ amen hallelujah any is a person the whole family in heaven the name Jesus the whole family in Earth Day Jah and how can you be saved without taking his name that's right man see what he did he used he reversed it and he turned around and say it really don't matter what you baptize in I'm not preach Baptist but it's show you how Satan come in and got the world what did he do today the people couldn't have got in delusion the way the world is today if they would have got the Holy Ghost on so because he scri the people from getting the Holy Ghost now look what he doing right he can got he can take over him anytime he want to because they Ain got nobody to fight for him that's right and the only reason that you got something you got a power that's within you that greatest he that's in you that he that's in the world you got something to fight with the world ain't got nothing to fight with right demons take them over anytime they want to tell them go down here and kill some so they just get up and do it they have nothing to restra them but you got a power that's on the inside of you something that you don't even understand yourself call the Holy Ghost it's able to keep you in the time of trouble Hallelujah so we talking about past now remember here and the thing of it is pths need to be removed yeah cuz sometime people's beating themselves up for things that happen ungodly things they done they never never overcome that and the reason they never overcome that they never looked at what Jesus done for them that's right they looking at well I just can't see how I can make it with that I don't need I couldn't understand how I can make it but but but Christ came by Revelation see because as long as you got a pass you got condemnation right because condemnation come from something you done in the past something that you know that you know stuff and we all have things that we done that we wouldn't be proud of that's right we all got things that we battle with that we wouldn't be proud of but the point of it is you cannot stay in that spot because the devil know as long as you stay in that spot beating yourself up you save him no trouble right exactly cuz he putting stuff on the devil he didn't do devil brother all they got to do is accept Jesus they'll be all right but they the people don't come to the point now where they they trying to do it themselves how did man to be lovers of them more than lovers of God think he can do it himself I I I I believe I can hand myself no you cannot you cannot fight this spiritual war while your own or human ability you got to give Christ to you the reason the power let loose and let him do it am I begin to realize here I here now look at here I I thought about R ra had a pass real bad P by the way she had a real bad pass and everybody in the town knew RAB pass the Bible say RAB the Harlot H that's how the Bible anounces in the book of Hebrews right have the Harlot but the only thing about it that was nobody there to condemn her there was nobody there to say was with my cousin or with my uncle all she didn't have nobody that had evidence against her because when they went through the city the city fell amen and all her accuses died oh my so R didn't have nobody that l in charge against her right amen I said real I said what we got to get today we got to get somebody we got to get somebody to drop the charges on us right because we always guilty right if you was born without the spoken word birth you got problems and I guarantee it ain't nobody here can say they was born right poof and just come on the scene you were born without the spok word birth you had a problem how about in the natural the way you come to the Earth everybody that's in here was born by sensation how it ain't nobody in here that not come that way right right outside of Christ he the only one came different from that that why he was the only one worthy to take your place Hallelujah but everybody here was born with a nature that had fallen and automatic you was a liar to begin with exactly amen now I ain't going to ask somebody to raise their hand but if I did how many here told a lie I had to be the first to raise my hand I didn't if I said tell lie I had to put the S on mine I mean you know what I'm talking about brother you might be perfect you might not have done that but I did okay okay okay did you believe Hallelujah you know some of them I told so much even now I'm scared to talk about it cuz I forgot two f oh yeah I know what you said I don't been there to I go to tell something I'm tring to think sometime but that the truth or that's one of my yes sir yes sir the Bible say you can tell it over and over you tell a lie so long you can believe it right that's true you can believe that you can tell yourself so long and lie to yourself so long I'm not forgiving you'll start believing that come on now why we got people in that mythical condition today all the Joy going because as long as you defeated Brother Sam come and preach the word to you you can never rise above that because you got something hanging over your head and if you ever get that off your head then you can start say Lord I'm free right H I am set free right but I'm going to say this I might told this before when Jesus cut that woman in the act of adultery when he C caught her in the act of adultery she was literally it's no way out of it she was guilty amen that that what the levitical law said Leviticus the 20 and I want you to notice when the devil come quoting this her when they come quoting this they were using the scripture they use the scripture they would not just come in to th I they use the scripture say we cut her in adultery and Leviticus the 20th chapter tell us the story her y but what do you say yeah now first all these Jers they they real they real good first off let me know if you ain't never looked at like this people when they read this they reading it in just well they read the story he caught this little woman Hallelujah and the Pharisees come down there and asked Jesus said Jesus what you going to do Jesus said that he right down the stone here that go and she was set free that ain't nothing you just looking at half of the picture first off Pharisees knew if they kill that woman without a man they'll get stoned those guys were trained in the word right you don't think they were coming down there quoting Leviticus hallelu and Leviticus the 20th chapter that we should stole her without a man they would have got killed for doing that that's right oh yeah they going to kill somebody oh yeah they had a man to kill yeah it says and they asked Jesus what do you say that's right you know why they asked Jesus that cuz they knew Jesus been preaching love and forgiveness they were looking for Jesus to blashe they were looking for Jesus and say forgive her and not Stone her and they were going to say you blashe right now how you know that why you think I read Mark the second chapter now you can look at why he said that when Jesus brought the py boy down he said your said thy sins be forgiven the what did they say he speak blasphemous come on Hallelujah they thought it was blaspheming for him to say now if he would have said forgive her they going to kill him for blaspheming then they had a second back up play yeah the Roman law protected her right and if she if Jesus said kill her they will use the law Caesar he not he breaking the law ceson they going to get me the way yeah so Jesus had no way out yeah but being the word he know there was a bunch of devils and Liars all he need is evidence he can disqualify the whole case Hallelujah you got evidence you can drop charges how a man that got evidence they been forgiven how when the devil come after you you got evidence you been forgiven how you can drop the charges how tell that devil I the charges been dropped this woman didn't need attorney right you know attorney is somebody to fight for you I went to court one time and I was guilty believe me I was guilty I can't tell you I hadn't done that I was guilty and I knew I was going to get it too buddy I'm sitting in court I'm thinking wow you trying to think of a good lie oh yeah I'm trying to think of a lie I'm going to tell you the truth I went no Chrismas I'm trying to think how I'm going to do trick this judge they'll give you one of these self-appointed attorneys that work for the state he going send you to prison because he not working for you he getting paid by the state so you got when them self bured Atty when them self-appointed how self-appointed Atty he get ready to see you the prison what you smiling at him for he's your enemy he going to tell you go up there and say you're guilty so you can go to jail you ain't going to get for 10 years but I did somebody cuz this case was real rough I said man look I realized I said man this going to look bad first ofense I probably I know I going to get much time but I was no I was facing between six months nine months maybe a year I said man I didn't want to do no year in no prison that's right amen I want to do no year in no prison but right I'm thinking I said man so all of a sudden the let the person that come up there to testify against me didn't show up hallelujah amen that made the Judgment that what you wanted to get the judge mad the judge got mad he said where the the what you call her V whereever she was the oh I told it was a woman but anyway a going go the but anyway he he brought her in there he said what they said she didn't show up and the judge says we didn't need an attorney we need a judge even though I was guilty but a judge has got the power to drop the charges Oh my he hit the he said case dismissed he said this Cas canot be tried no more in the state of North Carolina I jumped up wow I was guilty but I was set free that was Christ did for us all we was guilty but we didn't need Tor we needed a judge thank you Hallelujah we needed a judge we needed somebody had the authority to set us free Hallelujah set us free from all condemnation set us free from everything we done because we always messed up come on I used the thought day marri voice I'm not preaching Mar don't get scared I did use the thought of it I said you know a lot of time I said everybody got this thing draw out in the marriage and div voice I got them now everybody in here done this but me oh my I never married nobody else oh my I said if you took a woman to your tent you was married according to the Bible where teacher marri as it did not go to the judge of the Majesty said will you marry me will you take Rebecca to be your offed wife that didn't happen that way he took her to his tent he knew her that was his wife right don't go po your finger you better be looking for Grace you better be looking for the judge that dro the case he got the prise that we all was born in adultery I said man know what it is in this me with too many people they feel that I got something over on you you ain't got nothing over on me cuz I'm under the blood hallah under the blood mean there's no more remembrance that's right that I don't understand what your philosophy is no more remembrance my Bible tell me when your sins is Dropped In The Blood there no more remembrance of yourself even it cannot even come in the mind of God so you can be justified amen EX I just don't understand people today he said brother Jew you must need a lot of Grace no I believe in grace because I hear what the prophet say when Jesus the C come the bride going to be crying Grace Grace Grace she going to recognize it ain't going to be by her Mar it ain't going to be by her will it going to be by the grace of God you make it out of the hallelujah amen all these demons you fight you don't think you you going to need Grace come on we going to all need Grace we going to all need to be loose from our path I need a judge come on I need someone why you think Paul says who going lay a charge to God elect that's right when a judge dismissed the case it's over if she would have showed up an hour later after after the judge dropped the Char he wouldn't even talk to it he was already miss this Cas I say this cake cannot be tried no more in the state of North Carolina he slam this hammer down and it was over I don't care she would have come a month later I want to recharge you I to do this it was already dropped H it was nothing against me right H and it was God done for all the devil got all kind of charges he got all kind of things he want to bring against us but God got a white stone how did My bride is Justified I already to drop the charges on you how you going go on in I don't let the devil put you back don't go back and dig up your old husband right oh L but the point of it is everybody hate to get rid of it I buried him six years ago I start feeling sorry for him I went back and got it if you bur him you drive a steak down you leave it right there if you accepted Jesus for your your party you accepted Jesus for the grace you accept him for your mercy you leave the stakes down don't let the devil pull you back under something that God done done for you if God tell you you healed you have stay down right amen don't you never pull that up stand on that St say I am healed I'm not going to pull that demon back up I don't understand why people like these Spirits right you know some people love Spirits I tell I never been here since I told this Hallelujah I had a disease taed my body a while back man I brother wait I'm going to tell you I start getting real nervous I start Bleeding Through the bows I knew something was wrong but one night I said I'm going up and get prayer for I said Lord I said I ain't got no insurance I'm trusting you for healing not I got insurance like life insurance that's benefiting my wife that ain't benefiting me one person get happy on life is that sh want to Left Behind so I'm thinking I got a lot of life insurance I'm talking about medical insurance and I'm thinking that I said Lord I ain't got nothing how when normally when you ain't got nothing that's to turn to you trust God anyway H when all other options gone that you have to turn to God that why Africans see more sze and one we see because they ain't got nothing else to turn to but God so you'll see the explor miracles happen because when they come to the end all they got is God they hold on to it that's right but you know when you over heing the devil he educated everybody around and you got insurance so you say well I can go to the doctor I can get this heal why not go to Christ and believe him it's harder to believe because you got you got a bag up plan H if we didn't have a bag of plan we had to hold on to God he the parish when I was at that point I said Lord you to heal me right I said I got no other solution I said this is all I know Lord I went and God prayer for did it stopped no it didn't but I can't believe nothing Lord I'm here I don't know when it stopped it just stopped H I know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today amen H St trying to get they accept Faith they accept Revelation they accept his forgiveness power and word he said didn't you know we I guess y'all May heard about the testimony closing now brother Tim had a youth service you heard about that way right he had us Serv a few months ago and when we did a little girl 18 years old she got
