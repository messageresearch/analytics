TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good morning all right good morning all right good to have everybody here good to be back everything's in one place one Accord one mind one heart all right so let's get uh let's get finished with the second seal today I want to bring out something before we start the third seal when he had opened the second seal now we've been on the second seal for a while so this it's time to get off and go to the next I heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another horse that was Red Power was given un him that set on there to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another with a what should kill one another and then what he given though what how do they kill each other though really great sword that's what really does the killing uh that they didn't kill each other just for killing each other I was thinking this morning every war has something to do with religion every conflict has something to do with religion and we're going to read that this afternoon because you know what we call Jesus the prince of peace right you know he said I didn't come to bring peace right right that's what he said he said I did not come to bring peace he said I come to make mother against father sister against brother what he said I'll read it it's in the Bible in he said he said in other words bring a variance between two well see he didn't come purposely to do that we know he was a prince of peace yes but when he come into this world he caused such a violent reaction from the other side till it has not stopped and it will not stop until we not even in the Millennium okay no no no remember still seventh day everything's got to go to that Eighth Day where everything is peace peace will not be on earth yes there will be a time of rejoicing a time of Jubilee during the Thousand Years of millennial Reign but there's still at the end of that time there is a conflict that's coming dog and Magog yes okay dog and Magog so you you still got battle right we won't have battles but maybe somebody else is going to have one because there's going to be Heathen raised up and there's going to be a lot of things going on in the Millennium that you can't attribute to the Future home so so when Jesus came now we know for sure this is natural killing for one but he was given him one man with one sword can't kill 68 million people right yeah one man with one sword canot kill 68 million people but one man with a great word that's right could kill 68 million people all right so you see which is more powerful the sword of the word the word's more powerful because what comes from the word it's why we have all these divisions now we have you know syrians libyans we have all these different variants that are in the earth now and it's all because of religion that's right it really is basic bottom line it's all because of religion why do the Baptist not go to Methodist Church why the meth not go to Catholic I asked them at one time I said why don't y'all go to each other's church I said you believe same thing no we don't see so there's a variance there that even inside of religion there's a variance of you believe this and I believe this now let's come up to the message yeah right where that that man is riding not out there anymore he's riding here yeah here that there's now a Vance and there's been a great sword given and it's how this person handles that sword because if you take the right way of doing it like we're showing the right way of sanctification if you use that great sword then that great word then you what you're sanctifying a group of people cuz we're being washed Paul said by the word of the word so every time we come in that's why the sanctification does not end justification won't end until we take a body chain sanctification won't end until we take a body chain and the baptism of the Holy Ghost won't end till until we take a body change and you say well end see remember it's not end like end it'll become to its fullness okay cuz look when we get to Glory we won't need to be justified and if you'll believe it those who is Justified is already glorified and that's down here yes not up there that's down here that's how close these Riders when you look at these Riders you're not looking at at at far off and and what's coming and and you know um I'll be glad when we get to heaven okay what are you going to do when you get there if you don't know what it's like I mean how you know you're going to be there if you don't know you know you say you you take somebody that's never been out of their community and say Africa or somewhere and you take them to New York City well if you haven't explain New York City to them you going to say well this is New York City and they're going to go okay big buildings what what's the significance here right but if you give him a history book and let him read the history and let somebody teach him about where he's going then you'll do just like Rebecca alar described Isaac so well to when when when Rebecca comes into that town she doesn't look over to elar and say where is he right the Bible says she immediately Dismounts off of her camel and runs toward him she knows exactly elar has and that's what our elar to the day the Holy Ghost through brother brandom bringing a greater view of God than anybody's ever brought before and not that he's somewhere that we got to go out under and get that he's not thee he's here he's right here all right and how we going to know that we're going to know that by a great word or a great sword we must have a great word in the end time to take us not just to a Sanctified condition cuz if you everybody that was born again from from the day of Pentecost until right now had to go through a sanctifying condition you weren't born Sanctified right so everybody's went through a sanctifying condition but now no one has had a Sanctified body except Jesus Christ right the only the only one that has that's reached immortality and I got something else just a little few more keys on the dimensions the other night and on that so he's the only one that's reached immortality but he can come down through those dimensions and move anywhere he wants to MH that's why he came to John on patmas laid his hand on him and didn't have a problem laying his hand on a what we would say would be um the Apex of human flesh which is a body change that's the Apex of human flesh to the lowest form of human flesh which is our stinking body on in this Dimension that we're in now he didn't have a problem laying his hand on John and say fear not don't worry about it right and that's what he's doing now because remember if he's pleased to dwell in you then he's already in you that's right he's not coming from somewhere he's already in you so if he's already in you then he's doing the work we know that toward the outside and he's working through that filter of called of spirit because remember our body does nothing without what inside man tells it to do nothing it can't even move of its own self right and if you'll really sit down and think about death and you know with with Tommy Dy and and all looking at him laying there in the casket there was something that fired that man for 60 something years and then all of a sudden that he the the firing mechanism left body's still there the Bible says we plant them in corruption cuz we have to put that corruption into the ground even Jesus's body was heading toward corruption it wasn't corrupt him but it was heading toward corruption cells were already beginning to break down um just like Lazarus hey Lazarus was in the Tomb 4 days and his nose he was sing and his nose fell in Jesus was you know really just two and a half but it was in three days Friday Saturday Sunday but it wasn't that whole day Sunday he was only really 24 to to something hour not even 36 hours in the grave so but it was heading toward corruption so everything that we plan in corruption Paul says that when we raise them we raise them in incorruption right so you got to plant them into the earth that is cursed but they don't stay there they're going to be raised in incorruption if you have the same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead you'll get raised the same way he got raised right right not too farfetched is it really simple it really is it's really just real simple when you look at death and and and Resurrection but we like Daddy said we think it's some big atom bomb great when really it's not it's it's just I was thinking about that the other night we we look at these seals and and maybe you're doing the same thing you're looking for this you you sitting on the edge of your seat and I'm sure they were back then s waiting for something and something something to come out of this you know something I'm going to get that's going to just explode me into the uh you know up into past Pluto you know you understand what I'm saying and he said it wasn't even for you so really they didn't get any of this they sure they got Revelation the the onion peel they got part of the onion they got part Revelation but they didn't get the full revelation of what he was trying to get them to see but he said it's not for you so see you and I now must take this yes take it past Pluto over into eternity because this is the Eternal Word of God MH but that that eternity's come here and now it's trying to get us there and when I say there I don't mean a place there I mean there in the word right a place in the word right let's not ever look for a place to go right it's it's it's in the word it's in the word of God the word of God's where the place to go all right that's the place to meet that's the place to Fellowship that's the place we going to be when we leave out of here we're going to be in the word yes all right and brother R said I read it like last Sunday or Sunday before that it's in the word all the way to get a body change you got to be in the word all the way all right not just a piece here and the piece here some things we you know think we get by with because if it's in the word it's Eternal there's no way to change it okay and that's a strange thing we're going to look at today because we're going to this afternoon we're going to look and see that the son of man the word made flesh mhm seemed to be you hear me now seemed to be that he broke the rules a lot of times okay seem to be I said but what he was doing was trying to reveal to him to get him off the letter and put him in flashh and put him standing there in front of them cuz they called him all kind of names and he called himself a wine bber and a glutton so he must have not fasted a lot cuz he said why the Pharisees said why don't y'all fast so you you see what I'm saying that he lived so close a human life though till they thought he was a devil they thought he just was anointed by something right is that too far off from what the people in the message believe that he was anointed then he became God on the River Jordan but he was anointed and you know hey come on if he was almighty God in human flesh the fullness of the godhead B then you know we need to just go find a good bar and right get drunk step out in front of a truck or something I mean really so I mean what's life for what are we what are we basing everything on WE base it on the word of God run it through our filter take what the prophet said which Jesus told them people he said he said these prophets wanted to see this day and said you've seen it in other words and turned me down so I say today the same thing the prophet walked in this land it's good that the prophet walked in the land but who was he pointing us to not him he was pointing us to Christ so that's who we were who we were supposed to see in the first place and everybody put you know instead of Jesus inter interceding and they put brother brandom doing the interceding which that's not true um but how close is it though when a man can say go as you are and don't do it anymore right you've been forgiven in other words you know you yes it was he was there he was there the the big age not the he brother brand the big age the big the Holy Ghost was there to do that because you and I even brother R and his Humanity Humanity couldn't do that God had to say hear ye him God had to be there doing the speaking because we'll read it this afternoon the son of man has has power to forgive sins on Earth amen okay so if the son of man Ministry was there in a prophet then he could do that that's the reason he had to wait all that length of time to go up to the mount Mountain to get that what to get that word to say go on as you are because I mean find out in the Bible Moses give him a writing of divorcement he gave him a paper brother didn't give you a paper that hey don't go s no more no he gave him a word he brought the son of man just like the son of man was standing on the earth doing things that he was supposed to do just like the word said and the outside world was like who you think you are okay so we'll see that maybe but same thing with these seals we we we sometimes we think we're all sitting on our edge of our seat wanting to wanting that little key word you going to have to find it for yourself amen yes I can just you know maybe bring an angle that you haven't seen that's true that's what a preacher usually does he'll bring an angle that you've never seen before and and if and if it matches the word then you can put it both together that's right and it'll come up a wonderful Revelation right cuz sometimes we do get mule blinders we'll get the SS we'll get now them seals has got to mean this well we know one thing for sure the letter of the seals that was preached in 1963 has done us no good the letter you hear what I said the letter yes and I say that and I say that because I go back you say Well it we don't need to read it see there you go off on the other end no you got to read it to get Revelation you got to read it but you're not understanding it right in the way God wants you to understand that's same way with Jesus Jesus is saying look they said hey we got in other words we got Moses's quotebook we have Moses we have Abraham see they're going back to the prophets well people say well we have brother R he preached the seal so they must be open yeah to one man so that he can give them to us amen right but we the ones that's got to get the revelation of this so don't think that that I'm going to come here and stand here one Sunday and you're going to go red horse rider and just D It's just something nobody's ever thought of no you got to get it for yourself amen but remember what brother R said he said it's got to compare with every scripture in the Bible right Genesis to Revelation it's got to compare with every scripture in the Bible it cannot be something far off that's right okay it's got to be right in the word of God but the horses read take peace from the earth they should kill one another and they was giving him a great sword now what is the word of God doing the sword is always the word so what is it doing it's killing it's killing what it's killing the old you killing the old part of you that still we haven't killed it yet we've divorced it right like brother BR said open the closet and stuck it well I don't no it's got to be dead for you to be married to Christ your old husband has to be dead for you to be married to somebody else your old husband got to be dead Okay so that's just pretty plain right when you see the ox age was this age right here the fourth age which this is where 68 million people were killed because of what religion because of a word that went out a word sword a word went out from the Pope from Rome or from the Roman Catholic church and says anybody that doesn't say the thing we say do the thing we do kill them right MH so there's your religious War okay religious War killed have you read how the hund how the um 12 apostles were killed have you ever read it before there's a little thing somewhere around here in church it's got all 12 some of them went in different places I think Matthew or somebody went to India and this one went to different places but they were pulled apart they were buried hung upside down Peter was hung upside down one of them James got his head cut off neither one you see how they got killed why because of because people didn't like them no no because of that sword that word so Satan's got a sword God's got a sword that's right Satan has a word but you know what it is the Bible one word off that's Satan sword is the Bible one word off the whole Bible don't you think he was sitting right there when all this was going on Amen sure he was so the great sord is the is the pure word but it was what they did with that pure word that's correct okay cuz like brother R said the pure pure unadulterated word has struck the ground struck the Earth right that should have meant we took a body change right then if the pure and adulterated word had struck the Earth back in ' 63 when he was preaching the seal right we should took a body chain it struck the Earth but it didn't strike it in the fullness your word yes sir right and to some it became a word not the word right cuz like the people in the Bible says well some part of it is the word of God some part of it's not well then who knows which is and which isn't I guess you have to ask them cuz they're the ones that decided that right if they decided that that part of it isn't part was not then I guess you got to go back and ask them people well which part is and which part not it's got to be the full word of God Satan has just took it and twisted at one word so this great sword that Satan has is not some um black horrible thing but it's the most horrible thing in the world to be one word off look what happened to Eve being one word off right billions billions of people on the Earth and and then there's that many more billions that's already died just because what she did right right we going to get into that too because there was something opened up there remember cancer and and demons travel in what dimension fourth dimension death and life travels in the fourth dimension you say oh how does that well how does God come down and talk to you you listen to messages don't you God speaks to you fourth dimension is radio waves TV and demons so demons travel in fourth dimension there was no there was no time that there was a cancer until Eve did what she did there was no time there was death until she did what she did there was no sorrow until she did what she did so something transpired when God said I will put enmity or division between God and man but I'm the one that's going to bring it back together and he's bringing it back together what through these Seven Seals is where he brought truly brought man because these seals are the entire Bible made manifest okay and that's how God brought it back he's bringing it back through the word of God not some separate word so you see how close it is yes and look brother brandom um tells us he talks about uh uh brotherly kindness he talks about uh somebody talks about brotherly brother Brown said now now if you you don't have to physically kill somebody anymore you kill their influence you've killed that person right just as much if you'd have killed him with a gun you have killed his influence you have killed that person why because nobody's going to listen to him if they start telling you uh brother Dale's wrong here brother Wade's wrong here we see that they kill your influence and then the people or whoever's true I just say us because we're here right right any y'all any of y'all go preach the word of God and they say hey don't listen to that because it's not true that's not the doctrine I preach then they've killed your influence they just might as well kill you m right but there was given unto him a great sword so the sword he was given see look watch you see oh he was given a false word God can't give a false word that's right God has to give the revealed word amen and then Satan Ted just by one word right so he was given a great that's why it says a great sword he was given a great sword because he was given a sword so close because we're truly supposed to take the word and kill people with it yes brother D kills us I hope he does that's our problem he don't kill us every Sunday we just we just push him over in the closet and then when he gets done we bring him back out right but if you kill that thing it's dead it ain't going to you don't want to revive something that's that dead that's right you don't want to revive but see you got but a Sanctified body then the Sanctified body is the body of Christ there was sanctification going through every Church age every Church age there was a Sanctified group of people yes but they couldn't come all the way out because of the word they had they could what I mean what I mean by you got to listen to what brother was talking on that 49 and 50 the 49 is your church ages 77 right if you the reason let me tell you something the reason you got a 49 so 7 * 7 all right that's 49 that's seven type of seven Church ages all right everybody got that but now what is that it's time okay right now when the Jews when they were supp to celebrate that Jubilee year in this year that's why I preacher argu with Daddy and I wish I'd have been there cuz I i' helped him a little bit he said oh no they celebrated the Jubilee they celebrated jubile every seven years they've never stopped doing that I think modern times they don't do it anymore but every seven years look R Rachel um who was it worked for Rachel and Li Jacob Jacob worked seven years he wasn't a slave he was working toward something so he could get a wife and then poor old laan well not poor old Laban poor old Jacob Laban um hued him and got him to work seven more years bless his heart hey he worked seven years to get a wife we can't stand a year be dating a girl for a year some of y'all Rachel said J couldn't last a minute if she ever you know what Joseph said Joseph said there's a time of grieving Rachel held up one minute one minute the question was is if your spouse passed or your wife passed away how long would it take for you to get over it and and go on and get married either one year one uh one day one year well one day one month one year or I've got the T-shirt I don't want another one most people said I got the T-shirt I don't want another one but Rachel but Joe under one minute so he's under stress if anything ever happens so I'm not going anywhere with that a 10 no more anyway so he worked seven years to get her then he worked seven more all right but that's still type of the church agent but what he done though he was working off a debt right I think we still get in our mind that that it's slavery like the old South and no that's not it Jacob comes up to laan and says I want Rachel right he said if you'll work for me labor for me seven years you can have her all right normally if laan hadn't been a um Shyer himself you know he would have worked seven years that seventh year he would have got Rachel and they would have went off cuz he had paid his debt that's right okay same way with here you have paid your debt but you still got something here that there's not a debt paid yet it sure it is in Calvary we know that but your body stays here right right nobody's took a Rapture in seven Church ages everybody's body is in the ground right now that's right Christian born again True Believers even even all these Church a Messengers are laying in the dirt right that's why the word had to be made dust where it had to be made dirt to take away the sin right but they're laying in the ground so their soul came out the seven they got they got a seven-year release they got a release their soul went out went to what sixth Dimension yeah the body stayed in the ground that's why Leviticus 25 58 said if you go in and you get a if he gives you a wife then you go out but the wife stays or in other words in other words if you acrew debt then part of that debt goes out but there's still something that stays in like the wife or even the children what why they didn't celebrate a 50 because if you if you you're a Headmaster and I owed you $500 this one owed you $500 and this one owed you $500 that made him have $1,500 and you had and you had 00 0 0 the golden jubilee that they were supposed to have celebrated was that this right here he had to give that one back 500 that one back 500 that one back 500 and he was at zero or everybody was equal during that seven years if you if somebody said okay I'll work a few years and give you 20 acres well that don't happen on seven but that golden jubilee he had to give you that land back cuz you had worked the time you had worked that you had made it to that 50th Jubilee you had worked all that that time he had to give you that land back he had to give you that money back he had to give you that house back that's why the Jews never celebrated a 50 you a Jew ain't going to give it back that's right and God knew that remember I went through that on a u yes in a sermon about uh where God made the land rest he made that land rest why cuz he knew man wouldn't do it so what's a land the top of our bodies he made at rest so what when we put Duty in the ground Tommy I got when he put him in the ground what he's at rest he's at rest I'm going to tell you something about this I was telling Donnie the other day and me and Terence and Lisa was talking about it not too long ago we've had a lot of people in our life teren people and I'm sure you have why does somebody just suddenly die this been close to you helped you do things and then all of a sudden we had a friend of ours Dane Brown good guy real good friend of ours would do anything in the world for us help me in the beekeeping world he died of cancer L that just had it done finished no this one over here I get rich had it done finished G right okay everybody got that Tommy we know one thing's for sure that he had the mind of a 12-y old year old so the Bible says much is given much is required there wasn't much given so there's not much required right we know that there's a place for that person in heaven because he never reached the age of accountability god listen to me God and to be so gracious to allow that to happen but you're going to watch the next couple of years you're going to see people strangely pass away mark my word so but you say well what are you trying to get to this dust part why would he let somebody that he's going to give eternal life to say Dean brown or Lisa's grandma or somebody that was good to us that didn't care nothing I didn't don't say don't care nothing about God but just was not a Christian but but the Lord said a cup of water in my name will not be forgotten here or there that's right and then all of a sudden you see them pass away and you grieve why grieve they ain't got to go through any tribulation period they don't have to be persecuted God's going to hide them and let let them rest until way over there at the white throne and he's going to raise them up give them eternal life you just watch people's been good to you I've always wondered we were talking about that the other day wondering about people that was being real good to you and all of a sudden they die you say well that's horrible is it I don't think it's so horrible that God goes ahead and let some rest puts some over in the dimension where they just kind of hold them right there until everything's finished and he brings them out and says okay you get eternal life why s through the tribulation so you're going to see that happen and what a great Mighty God that we can see that that we had a prophet that told us that that somebody in that condition brother Brown said even somebody you know kid that was had an had a special Angel he had an extra angel or a special angel that watchs him through life D he definitely did wonderful did what I said Dy definitely sure he did sure we see we look back now we go man it had to be the angel of God helping him all through all through the way same with same with the people that's been good to us I just think that that's the closer we get to the end the more people are going to pass away cuz number one they can't come to a a word a the great word that we're supposed to come to and maybe you know even us me whoever but why a mighty God to let that happen and not carry this thing on out let anybody suffer and not let especially people that are uh maybe family members they're not going to go to heaven because they family members but you know you've seen some that's been real good to you and some that's not that's right that's why the ones you know what you always the old statement says the two mean to die that may have something to do with that if they real mean to you God may let them go through that tribulation period just to prove to him that you he was persecuting or she was persecuting a saint of God maybe you never thought about that but as these Dimensions open up that I'm studying on I can see a lot of things how God's moving and he got quit moving he's just he's moving all the time he's putting place his people here he's placing these here he's moving this one he's hiding people hide me in thy Pavilion Psalm says hide me you know so that's what these seals are doing to me to me though what the seals are doing the seals are absolutely what the prophet of God said we got to see the white horse rider Le leaving we got to see the red horse rider rider leaving we got to see the black horse rider leaving that's death amen then we got to see that Pale Horse we got to see all that separation and once we do see the separation you can look at the word that was truly given to us through the filter of the Holy Ghost and that's why we should be progressing in the word amen progressing in the word not not that not that I you know let me let me give you something that's going to shock the shock the fool out of you yes as I progress up the statue of perfect man I'm not going to get quieter right I'm not that's just not me Jesus the Bible said grew in Grace and knowledge and they called him a devil right right right that's right Jesus grew in Grace and knowledge and they called him they said I'm going to read it today even his sisters do you know he had sisters yes the Bible says his sisters be raided him over something he was doing oh but that was Jesus the perfect Son of God yeah he was so perfect till he was human right Renegade he acted so he wasn't Renegade he acted so human till his sisters like what's he doing that foolish stuff for cuz remember he tried to do some mighty Works in his hometown and he couldn't because what he was so common oh that's Joseph and Mary's boy and his sisters are here in other words ber raing him for what he's doing so don't think once you go up the statue perfect man that God's going to change your whole character he likes your character just the way it is I'm not going to get quieter so ior read for some of y'all I'm not going to get quieter kind of bad when a man stands up one day and and uh we go well now we need to go bury duty duty die we need to go bury Duty and the Very king of of of Life says Let the dead bury the dead right you know what he was saying why waste your time the words here you need to follow me amen now boy that hurt that hurt if brother Dale stood up and said now look we're not going to do this funeral cuz we're having church on Sunday if the funeral would have been Sunday you you understand what I mean I mean come on we got to get down to that's why I'm telling you when you get down to where that son of man Ministry is it's not some it's like I said we say he's the king of peace he is the king of Peace yes he's the king of righteousness but he said in his own word he said I didn't come to bring peace right he said the word of God since John has been fought with vengeance yes he said the Kingdom of Heaven is having to be taken by force and you going to fight your way look at all this look at all this fighting going on in these in these scriptures in these seals look at the fighting going on even the fifth seal you don't see fighting but you see the cause of the fight the fifth seal Jew were killed because of what their religion who they were that's right so the fifth seal is a variance The Sixth Seal by Heaven you know what that's going to be that's going to be the Earth right that Sixth Seal is is a total disruption of this Earth the nature they call what they want to do what about a what about two men standing on Earth and saying tornado or or somebody's it's not funny but really if you look at it and you start looking and you see this big army coming after two men Moses and Elijah you see these Army coming and you and they just go they just draw a line in the sand and walk back about 200 ft and then say open and that thing goes and that whole army goes right down in that thing and then shuts it right back up you say that's that's too farfetched it's already
