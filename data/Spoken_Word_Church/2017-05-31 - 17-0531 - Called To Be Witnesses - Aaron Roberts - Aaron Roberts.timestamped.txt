[3:22] I've always told them that if I felt

[3:28] valve in just you know I don't know I
[3:34] don't mind if you get stuck but don't
[3:36] come out of needle with me like I always

[3:46] anybody saying they were gonna stick me
[3:48] a million times with a pen for Anita I
[3:50] didn't need that so just appreciate the
[3:55] Lord let's just look into the scripture
[3:56] tonight and I know brother Dale
[3:59] mentioned we were actually brother Tim
[4:02] hymns Sunday and but just one member of
[4:07] G Martin's family and brother Martin he
[4:11] was 85 years old pastored New Testament
[4:15] church in in the Hickory area of North
[4:17] Carolina since 1963 and he was a real
[4:21] soldier of the cross
[4:22] and had the opportunity to minister to
[4:24] church and really precious people and
[4:27] you know they just without without a
[4:30] shepherd right now and we know the Lord
[4:32] is the shepherd
[4:34] they'll just remember them I know that
[4:36] he's a the Lord delivered brother Martin
[4:40] a number of times over the last little
[4:41] while he's had a lot of problems with
[4:43] his blood pressure and art and he got an
[4:47] infection and they were trying to clear
[4:50] that up and if they if he could have got
[4:52] over that they were going to put a
[4:53] pacemaker in and the other day brother
[4:58] Richie
[4:58] Douglass sent me a text message saying
[5:00] that the blood flow to his intestines
[5:02] had quit so they called the family and
[5:07] but one thing about it we know where
[5:09] he's at this evening so appreciate the
[5:12] Lord and and you know you look back over
[5:15] you know real soldiers of the cross
[5:18] been been in the way for a long time and
[5:21] been a real test testament testimony
[5:24] tool to a lot of us and just appreciate
[5:28] them and I'll just continue to remember
[5:30] them in prayer and he'll just Nelson
[5:35] brother Kim Hughes he's getting ready to
[5:37] go overseas and I was so got to talk to
[5:42] him Sunday and he's getting ready to
[5:44] leave and so certainly won't remember
[5:46] them he's going to Germany and he's
[5:49] going big he's going to be going
[5:50] different places and everything so I'll
[5:52] just remember them appreciate the ones
[5:55] that are on the on the field going in
[5:57] and doing and you know like I said if
[6:00] you can't go send somebody and it's
[6:03] certainly one thing we can do is we can
[6:04] pray for them right amen so just
[6:07] appreciate that and let's just look into
[6:10] the scripture this evening go to Acts
[6:12] chapter 1 and very familiar Scripture
[6:15] and y'all just pray for me this
[6:17] something's been on my on my heart for a
[6:19] while and you know you try to find you
[6:25] try to find what to say sometimes and
[6:28] sometimes you just can't get away from
[6:30] it you just keep coming back and it's
[6:34] the fault kept coming back
[6:36] but it's like well Lord what should you
[6:39] know because you're looking for more
[6:40] than just just the fault and the felt
[6:42] just stayed and say and so y'all just
[6:46] pray for me the night or just help us
[6:49] because I do believe God called us to be
[6:52] a witness and so you know if God called
[6:58] us God equips us right and you know if
[7:04] you don't if you see the hour which we
[7:06] live and one of the things we look at
[7:08] you know if you see the hour in which
[7:10] you live and see the condition that the
[7:13] world is in if you look at the life of
[7:17] Abraham and one of the things that that
[7:20] struck me was you know God told Abraham
[7:24] because Abraham was a friend of God that
[7:29] he said how can I do anything unless I
[7:32] tell Abraham about and Abraham went
[7:37] forth and he told God because he said he
[7:39] saw the judgment and the wickedness of
[7:41] the people he said I'm gonna destroy
[7:43] them and you know Abraham he just said
[7:48] were Lord that'sthat's the Word of God
[7:49] just go ahead he went to God and he said
[7:53] Lord he said if I can find 50 they said
[7:58] we Sparrow he said if I can find 10
[8:00] righteous and he said he said I'd spare
[8:04] my pinion he had a burden for the people
[8:10] and the question is do you and I have
[8:14] that same burden so let's just speak to
[8:18] the author before we read the scripture
[8:20] this evening our Heavenly Father Lord
[8:23] we're just so thankful Lord we just love
[8:25] you for all that you've done for us
[8:27] Lord you sent your word and you healed
[8:30] us Lord you delivered us from our
[8:33] destruction though we know that the
[8:37] devil is like a roaring lion seeking
[8:39] whom he may devour but Lord we're but
[8:42] greater is he that sent us than he
[8:44] that's in the world Lord we know that
[8:47] you equipped us to fight
[8:49] every power of satan and we know that
[8:52] it's just going to continue to to go and
[8:56] just continue to get worse but lord we
[8:59] know that we're fortified behind your
[9:03] word and all were just so thankful for
[9:06] that Lord we just pray tonight you just
[9:08] give us ears to hear and hearts to
[9:11] receive and mouth to speak Lord Father
[9:14] that we just just look unto you and Lord
[9:17] let us just get out of the way and Lord
[9:19] you come and speak tonight father just
[9:21] use my just use this vessel the Lord and
[9:24] I just want to just be yielded to the
[9:26] Holy Spirit tonight Lord for each one is
[9:31] sick and needing tonight Lord that are
[9:33] afflicted farther I know that you've
[9:36] already finished it at Calvary and all
[9:41] we just pray that you just lift the
[9:43] people's faith tonight Lord whatever
[9:44] received the receive whatever they have
[9:46] need of lord I just pray for the Martin
[9:49] family tonight Lord father you just be
[9:52] with the church there and the family as
[9:54] a comfort in it as a God Lord Jesus
[9:58] because we know that you're the
[10:01] ever-present help in a time of trouble
[10:03] you're a comforter and or just make
[10:06] yourself real to them and father we just
[10:09] pray for the ones that around the world
[10:10] the different ones we just pray for
[10:12] brother Akash should be coming in Sunday
[10:14] Lord we just pray that you just bless
[10:15] each one Lord the ones that are on the
[10:18] foreign fields lower the ones that are
[10:20] going lord I pray that you be with him
[10:22] and anoint them and bless them but we
[10:26] just commit all things to you in the
[10:27] name of Jesus Christ amen amen
[10:31] Acts chapter 1 verse 1 says the former
[10:34] treatise have I made of the lawfulness
[10:39] of all that Jesus began both to do and
[10:44] teach until the day in which he was
[10:46] taken up after that he through the Holy
[10:50] Ghost had given Commandments unto the
[10:52] disciples whom he had chosen to whom
[10:55] also he showed himself alive after his
[10:58] passion by many infallible proofs being
[11:00] seen of them forty days and speaking of
[11:03] them
[11:03] of the things pertaining to the kingdom
[11:06] of God and being assembled together with
[11:08] them commanded them that they should not
[11:11] depart from Jerusalem but wait for the
[11:14] promise of the Father which says he ye
[11:17] have heard of me for God truly baptized
[11:20] with water but ye shall be baptized with
[11:23] the Holy Ghost not many days hence when
[11:26] they therefore were come together they
[11:28] asked of him saying Lord without this
[11:31] time restore again the Kingdom of Israel
[11:33] and he said unto them it is not for you
[11:36] to know the times or the seasons which
[11:38] the father hath put in his own power but
[11:41] you shall receive power after that the
[11:43] Holy Ghost is come upon you and ye shall
[11:46] be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem
[11:48] and in all Judea and Samaria and unto
[11:51] the uttermost part of the earth Amen god
[11:55] bless you gnight you may be seated
[11:58] and so just won't speak about us being a
[12:02] better witness and you know the this if
[12:06] you look up the word witness you know
[12:11] there's there's three times three
[12:13] aspects of being a witness and you know
[12:17] many times the first the first part of
[12:21] being a witness an individual who being
[12:24] president personally sees and perceives
[12:26] the thing a beholder a spectator or
[12:28] eyewitness you know brother Branham said
[12:32] you know a witness had to be qualified
[12:34] because before they could actually get
[12:37] up and speak they actually have to be in
[12:40] the proper accordance to the law to be a
[12:43] witness for whatever they're going to be
[12:44] witnessing and so they actually have to
[12:47] have seen it or heard it or whatever it
[12:49] took to be the witness so that's the
[12:54] first thing that has to happen second
[12:55] part it says a person who gives
[12:57] testimony as in a court of law
[12:59] and that's actually speaking what you
[13:03] what you've know but the third one is
[13:07] kind of what I want to get on to a
[13:08] person or thing that affords evidence
[13:11] affords means to supply to provide
[13:16] and so when we look at that because as
[13:20] an example of this is you know the dead
[13:24] being raised we know in the Bible it
[13:27] talks about the dead being raised we
[13:30] know God raises the dead
[13:32] because you know we know in the Old
[13:34] Testament for example you know I know if
[13:40] y'all can find it y'all let me know but
[13:42] I can't find any place in the Old
[13:43] Testament where they were ever given the
[13:46] Commission to raise the dead but we know
[13:50] Elijah Elisha raised the widow woman's
[13:54] son but he didn't have a commission for
[13:59] that but you know what he had he had the
[14:02] ability because he had the power of God
[14:04] upon him to a do that and he went in and
[14:06] you know he was actually able to you
[14:09] know you know raise him from the dead
[14:15] Elisha was able to raise the shuma night
[14:18] woman's son you know and she was the one
[14:23] that didn't have a son but you know he
[14:26] was Elijah was able to speak to her
[14:28] until you're going to have a son when
[14:30] she didn't have one in the one and then
[14:32] when he died he was able to come and
[14:35] raise the boy up from the dead and we
[14:38] know that also that Elijah program said
[14:41] that Elijah had such a quickening power
[14:44] the scripture tells us about that a dead
[14:45] man was thrown on top of Elijah's bones
[14:47] and he came back to life so we know in
[14:50] the Old Testament but nobody ever said
[14:53] you're going to raise the dead but you
[14:57] know what it took place and then we know
[15:00] later on in the New Testament we know
[15:02] that you know Jesus came and the
[15:04] disciples were watching him and you know
[15:07] he raised the the widow woman's son and
[15:11] I think it's the thing that's called
[15:13] name is the city there and you know he
[15:16] was they were had the funeral procession
[15:18] coming on and everybody was weeping and
[15:20] everything but you know Jesus came by
[15:22] and raised the boy up and then we know
[15:24] that later on when when the last Jairus
[15:28] came you know his son his daughter was
[15:29] very sick and then we know later on you
[15:32] know the the servant came and told us
[15:35] that don't bother the master she's dead
[15:37] well you know that wasn't a problem for
[15:39] Jesus because you know if he hid or
[15:42] raised the dead before and he was a life
[15:44] he did it wasn't it wasn't a problem for
[15:46] him so he raised it and then the third
[15:48] one we knows was a Lazarus was raised
[15:50] Lazarus was raised up so we know that
[15:53] and so we know looking at her being a
[15:57] witness we know that it took place
[15:59] because the scripture accorded it and
[16:02] they saw it and then because they saw
[16:08] Jesus display that power but the third
[16:11] one we know was when Jesus in Matthew
[16:14] 10:5 and they have the scripture Matthew
[16:16] 10:5 he said these twelve Jesus sent
[16:20] forth commanding them saying go not in
[16:22] the way of the Gentiles or any city of
[16:25] the Samaritans enter ye not but go
[16:28] rather to the lost sheep of the house of
[16:30] Israel and as you go preach saying the
[16:32] kingdom of heaven is at hand he'll the
[16:34] sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead
[16:37] cast out devils freely you have received
[16:39] freely give so that's the first time but
[16:41] that I know of in the scripture unless
[16:44] y'all know something different that
[16:45] that's where they were given the
[16:46] Commission to raise the dead so they
[16:49] know to see that they had already seen
[16:52] it because it had been I witness to it
[16:55] they had been given the Commission to it
[16:58] because Jesus done it and then he gave
[17:00] them the Commission to raise the dead
[17:02] and we know that they did so that's what
[17:07] that's what it when he talks about a
[17:09] person that affords the evidence it's
[17:11] not just hearing about the evidence it's
[17:14] not just witnessing the evidence it's
[17:16] not just talking about the evidence but
[17:18] it's actually performing it's actually
[17:21] doing that and so that's what that's
[17:24] what they actually done they actually
[17:25] were able because Jesus gave them the
[17:27] Commission he showed them and you know
[17:30] he said don't go to the Gentiles but he
[17:32] said go to the hot lost sheep of Israel
[17:34] go to the house of Israel and preach
[17:36] this message and raise the dead and then
[17:40] so when we know in the scripture later
[17:41] where does
[17:42] give us because this was just to the
[17:44] according to the scripture this was just
[17:46] to the house of Israel but we know that
[17:50] in John 14 he says he said verily verily
[17:53] I say unto you he that believeth on me
[17:55] the works that I do shall he do also he
[17:59] said if you've seen me do these things
[18:01] then it's given to you to do the same
[18:02] thing and I was to go to the whole world
[18:05] and so we know that when they took that
[18:08] they did go to the whole world Jesus
[18:11] says he said greater works than these
[18:15] shall ye do because I go unto my father
[18:17] whatsoever you ask in my name that will
[18:20] I do that the father may be glorified in
[18:22] the son he said if you ask anything in
[18:25] my name I will do it so he gave them the
[18:28] Commission in total to ask in my name he
[18:31] said whatever you do do in my name
[18:33] because I've commissioned you to do this
[18:36] to go into all the world Matthew 28
[18:40] tells us so we're going to take this
[18:41] gospel into the whole world because and
[18:44] then do these things that I've commanded
[18:45] you to do so here's this Commission it
[18:49] was given to them that was given to them
[18:51] to go in all the world and preach this
[18:53] same gospel and in Matthew 24 he says
[18:57] and this gospel of the kingdom shall be
[18:59] preached in all the world for a witness
[19:00] unto all nations and then shall the end
[19:03] come so we know that there was a there's
[19:06] a time that this message has to be
[19:08] ministered but they you know it's
[19:11] talking about the continuation of the
[19:13] book of Acts you know there's not been
[19:16] an end of the book of Acts why because
[19:18] it's still going on why because the same
[19:20] power they laid in the book of Acts is
[19:22] here today I mean how people are looking
[19:24] for something and I was a denominational
[19:28] preacher too the other day here they
[19:29] were talking about having the Holy Ghost
[19:31] and you know and you know they want to
[19:33] have the Holy Ghost but they don't want
[19:35] to have too much of the Holy Ghost well
[19:39] we want we want to have the Holy Ghost
[19:40] because we want to be sealed but we
[19:42] don't want to do anything outrageous I
[19:46] don't know whether you're going to be
[19:47] able to do that what we just want
[19:50] because he's like I want to take part of
[19:52] the word but I don't want to take all of
[19:54] it I want to take I want
[19:56] take the prescription I want to take
[19:58] part of the medicine but I don't want to
[19:59] take all of it I don't want to be cured
[20:03] I just want to feel different you know
[20:09] many people they just want to play
[20:11] around with it and hold on to something
[20:13] but not too long after that if you don't
[20:14] go exactly by the prescription you end
[20:16] up dead so you have to follow exactly as
[20:22] brother brother Bentham said you got to
[20:24] follow dr. Peters prescription because
[20:26] he gave it to him on the day of
[20:27] Pentecost he gave them the exact
[20:29] prescription to follow the attendee game
[20:32] you're going to follow that prescription
[20:33] then you can come to life eternal just
[20:37] like he said when Jesus told them
[20:39] baptize in the name of the Father and
[20:41] the Son and the Holy Ghost
[20:43] what other thing is it do you know what
[20:45] the name of the Father Son and the Holy
[20:46] Ghost is because Peter turned around
[20:49] Gerald the day of I on the day of
[20:51] Pentecost as if you stand there and you
[20:56] think about what happened on the day of
[20:57] Pentecost see when he when he went out
[21:01] there you know Jesus told him said y'all
[21:03] must tarry till you be endued with power
[21:06] from on high and so they had to stay
[21:10] there but it was a promise to them and
[21:18] we know that later on they went in and
[21:21] they were there you know when they got
[21:24] into the description times I got him one
[21:26] Accord they got in and I got into a
[21:30] place where they were supposed to be but
[21:32] you know what they had their mind on
[21:33] that they had their mind on on receiving
[21:35] the promised
[21:36] I don't believe when they went 120 in
[21:39] the upper room they all had 121
[21:40] different ideas
[21:42] I believe they got into a place where
[21:44] they all got one mind because when they
[21:46] got in one mind then the mind of Christ
[21:48] could come to them and that's when the
[21:50] mind of Christ came and he filled every
[21:51] one of them with the sound of a rushing
[21:54] mighty wind
[21:57] many times people people wonder why they
[21:59] can't get the Holy Ghost or why they
[22:01] don't get what they want why because I
[22:03] never got to that place where they
[22:04] actually get into one Accord and it's a
[22:07] one accord yeah you get them you get in
[22:08] with crime
[22:10] but it's just you and him if you get
[22:14] into that place then he'll come and meet
[22:16] you you know when it comes to the day of
[22:20] Pentecost and there they were and they
[22:22] were he was preached and Peter was
[22:24] preaching to them and telling them about
[22:26] what God had done and you know they
[22:28] thought it was you know a bunch of drunk
[22:30] people and you know crazy people out
[22:32] there but you know Peter said this is
[22:37] that that was spoken by the Prophet Joel
[22:42] you know the people what you know when
[22:45] when the the Jews had come to Pentecost
[22:48] to the feast of Pentecost you know they
[22:51] had a feast and things that they had to
[22:54] take to do in the in the feast of
[22:56] Pentecost you know they had all the the
[22:59] men had to come and gather and you and
[23:01] one of the things that they would do is
[23:03] they read the scripture one of the
[23:05] things they celebrate was receiving the
[23:06] word but you know they came and they
[23:09] were celebrating these things and all
[23:11] the things that took place on the day of
[23:13] Pentecost you know during during that
[23:15] feast time and here they are and they're
[23:17] gathered and they're speaking on the
[23:18] word because that's what they've done
[23:21] here because they rejoiced in Jehovah
[23:24] and what Jehovah had done but you know
[23:27] the thing is is they had missed because
[23:29] here they are talking about the God of
[23:30] Abraham and the things that he had done
[23:33] and the great things that he's going to
[23:35] do but the thing is is they had actually
[23:38] missed him coming because he he had come
[23:42] and Peter was saying see I don't think
[23:44] these people are drunk you'll think
[23:46] these people are crazy they said but
[23:48] y'all stay in here and read the
[23:50] scriptures and rejoice on what jehovah
[23:52] has done but I'm telling you today this
[23:55] is that that was spoken by the Prophet
[23:57] Joel this is what your home I has
[23:59] brought and y'all missed it he's
[24:01] standing in the midst of the day and
[24:03] this is what he said this is that that
[24:06] was spoken of and he would pour out his
[24:09] spirit and these are these are the this
[24:10] is the the outpouring this is the effect
[24:15] of it and they missed it but you know in
[24:19] that time he says you know they were
[24:22] 3,000
[24:23] received it there were 3,000 that were
[24:26] pricked in their hearts that Peter could
[24:28] give them the prescription to what to
[24:30] take place and you know many times on
[24:32] the day of Pentecost when we look at we
[24:34] look at Pentecost
[24:36] we look at and see the first thing we
[24:38] look at is the pouring of the Holy Ghost
[24:41] on 120 in the upper room you know and I
[24:45] think it was early in the morning when
[24:46] that took place and then when they
[24:48] staggered out the door and the people
[24:51] heard heard the words the word being
[24:54] preached in their own language as it
[24:56] went forth and then you know they were
[24:58] pricked as Peter and the eleven stood up
[25:00] to preach when they were preaching the
[25:02] word and then the people received it but
[25:05] you know the thing is why don't you know
[25:07] what took place most of the day of
[25:08] Pentecost baptism I hated that that
[25:20] struck me another day I heard somebody
[25:21] say that you know if three thousand were
[25:24] saved and believed and were baptized
[25:25] there was a whole bunch of people
[25:27] getting baptized you know what struck me
[25:31] was we talked about having faith well
[25:34] you know the thing is a lot of things
[25:35] take place but you know somebody's got
[25:37] to get out there and do and do the
[25:39] manual labor you know if they were if
[25:42] they were twelve men if it was Peter in
[25:45] the eleven which was 12 if 12 had to go
[25:48] out there and baptize three thousand
[25:49] people you know how many that was 250 a
[25:52] person if half if half the men if half
[25:56] the people in the hundred of the 120
[25:59] which is 60 if they were 60 baptizing
[26:02] 3,000 that's still 50 people each person
[26:04] was baptizing yeah and you know that
[26:08] takes that take a while if you had
[26:09] because ain't never had to do that but I
[26:13] mean I know some of my brothers how
[26:14] about you know they baptize so many
[26:16] people in arms ready to fall off and
[26:17] they have to get somebody else to help
[26:19] baptize them you know because and you
[26:21] just on and on can you imagine trying to
[26:24] baptize 3,000 people so we talk about
[26:28] what goes on you know we just we just
[26:30] talk about the good things of Pentecost
[26:33] and the outpouring of the Holy Ghost but
[26:35] you know that was that was amazing thing
[26:37] what
[26:37] place on Pentecost was baptism but you
[26:41] know we see that as we look through here
[26:44] when he saw and they were pricked in the
[26:47] heart there was 3,000 of them that
[26:49] received this and then you know they
[26:52] continued on from there and all through
[26:55] all through the Bible that the disciples
[26:58] going from place to place preaching and
[27:02] carrying this when now they had 3,000
[27:05] people and you know I don't know how
[27:09] much they heard and let you know because
[27:10] you know I said part of that 3,000 could
[27:13] have been some of them that you know the
[27:14] ones that Jesus had appeared to they
[27:16] might have had more words you know but
[27:19] somebody had somebody had to expound the
[27:21] word to one more than just what Peter
[27:23] received but you know there was other
[27:25] ones that had continued on and there was
[27:27] 3,000 people that had to go out and
[27:29] share exactly what what had happened to
[27:32] them because if you stand out there and
[27:35] you've got 3,000 people out there in the
[27:37] water getting baptized
[27:38] everybody's want to know who these folks
[27:40] are because you know they go out there
[27:43] and they say what john babbitt was
[27:44] trying to drown people like turn the
[27:45] river years ago and now they got a whole
[27:47] bunch of these other crazy folks out
[27:49] there trying to drown people in the
[27:50] river too but you know what it was
[27:54] something that had to because if
[27:55] something really took place in in them
[27:57] it'll is like us if it took place then
[28:00] you know what it's got to be shared it's
[28:02] got to be it's got to be something
[28:04] that's got to come out you can't just
[28:05] hold it down and try to hold it back
[28:07] because it's going to come out so y'all
[28:12] just pray for me
[28:19] Jesus says and Mark has a couple other
[28:25] scriptures over the redirect quick mark
[28:28] 16:15 says and he said unto them go you
[28:32] in all the world and preach the gospel
[28:33] to every creature he that believeth in
[28:35] his baptized shall be saved he that
[28:37] believeth not shall be damned and these
[28:40] signs shall follow them that believe in
[28:41] my name they shall cast out Devils they
[28:43] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[28:45] take up serpents if they drink any
[28:47] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[28:49] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[28:51] shall recover and first John 1 says that
[28:57] which was from the beginning which we
[28:58] have heard which we have seen of our
[29:01] hands which we have looked upon in our
[29:04] hands have handled of the word of life
[29:06] for the life was manifested and we have
[29:08] seen it bear witness and show unto you
[29:11] that eternal life which was with the
[29:13] father and was manifested unto us that
[29:16] which we have seen and heard declare
[29:17] unto you that ye also have also may have
[29:23] fellowship with us and truly our
[29:24] Fellowship is with the father and with
[29:26] the son Jesus Christ and these things
[29:29] write unto you that your joy may be full
[29:34] so we know that the word because when
[29:39] they speak of the things that they've
[29:40] seen you know what they've experienced
[29:42] and then they are going to express it to
[29:45] the other ones to show them what what
[29:47] took place in their life because they
[29:48] want their to have the same joy that
[29:50] they have because if you if you're if
[29:53] you mean you can't have you can't have
[29:56] the Holy Ghost not have joy you can you
[30:00] know because egos about you know if you
[30:01] receive that the Holy Ghost you know
[30:03] there's a there's a whole group of
[30:06] fruits of the spirit the you know that
[30:09] you receive that so you know here these
[30:11] things are the wheel don't we be full
[30:12] and you know we want to have fellowship
[30:14] around this things because we want to
[30:16] tell you what we've seen and what we've
[30:18] witnessed what we've experienced because
[30:20] you know they've seen many things and
[30:22] you know about handling the handling
[30:24] these things and we've seen these things
[30:25] but you know we want to declare these
[30:26] things unto you and that's the same way
[30:29] it was all the way through the scripture
[30:30] the people have seen it
[30:33] and they've heard about it and they've
[30:36] read about it
[30:37] but they want to express it and show and
[30:40] be the living expression of these things
[30:43] be expressing exactly what it was
[30:45] we know that Jesus said in Luke 19:10 he
[30:50] said for the Son of man has come to seek
[30:52] and save that which was lost so we know
[30:56] that these things are to be declared and
[31:00] he said we come to seek and say those
[31:02] that were lost and brother Branham said
[31:06] in and the enjoy is a secret believer in
[31:10] 1955 he said being that this is more or
[31:15] less a faith message a faith message of
[31:18] divine healing secondarily he says our
[31:20] first motive of these meetings is to
[31:22] save lost souls no matter a body no
[31:25] matter how bad they're bedridden how
[31:28] sick they are some day they've got to
[31:29] die and if they're made perfectly whole
[31:32] tonight they've got to die if they're
[31:35] made perfectly holdin up but that soul
[31:37] which is immortal when it's kneeled will
[31:40] live forever divine healing as many
[31:42] times it said that healing service are
[31:44] just just all the stress but on physical
[31:48] healing he says if you'll notice about
[31:50] 80 percent of Jesus ministry was divine
[31:52] healing but divine healing is like the
[31:54] bait that's put on the hook you don't
[31:56] show the fishes of hook you show him the
[31:59] bait so he gets the bait and the hook to
[32:02] suit that's what we think about divine
[32:04] healing God sets in the church great
[32:05] signs and wonders to get sinners
[32:07] conscious of his presence like the gift
[32:10] of speaking in tongues it's not for him
[32:12] that believeth but him that believeth
[32:15] not it signs to the unbeliever in today
[32:18] we have plenty unbelievers so you know
[32:26] if God has called us to be a to be a
[32:29] witness you know he sent these things in
[32:32] order and it give a equips us well if
[32:37] you know if you can't see the world in
[32:41] the condition that it's in and you know
[32:43] many times you hear people talking is
[32:45] and they're so non
[32:47] on about things and you know because
[32:51] many people have just you know they read
[32:54] this the read the scripture and they
[32:56] read the message and it's you know we
[32:58] know that we know the world's full of
[33:00] cannon fodder and when we know we know
[33:02] well you know the bride is being called
[33:04] out and you know but we talk about these
[33:07] great things but the thing is is you
[33:09] know are you and I interested in saving
[33:11] all souls are we are we interested in
[33:14] looking for lost souls because you know
[33:16] Jesus come to do these great things and
[33:19] we talk about all the great things that
[33:20] Jesus done you know we want to do great
[33:22] things but the thing is is he said I
[33:24] came to seek and save those who were
[33:26] lost
[33:27] nor are we interested because it is the
[33:29] same today as it was then the same
[33:32] yesterday today and forever so if he was
[33:34] back then doing that then he's doing the
[33:36] same thing today and let me tell you
[33:39] something what we see the condition that
[33:40] the world is in today it's a lot worse
[33:43] than it ever has been and you know he
[33:45] said they said the world is full of
[33:47] unbelievers but you know do we have that
[33:50] same desire do we are we stirred up
[33:52] about that you know I was reading in the
[33:56] in the scripture you know there in
[34:00] Ezekiel none I mean you know the
[34:04] scripture there where it talks about the
[34:05] angel got went forth with the inkhorn
[34:07] you know he went through and he said he
[34:10] said they told the destroying angels
[34:13] that they must hold themselves he said
[34:15] until the one that had the ain't corn
[34:18] the angel to go forth and he said they
[34:19] were to mark those that siding cried for
[34:22] the abominations done in the city and he
[34:24] said they must mark them and you must
[34:26] give them time to mark those and brother
[34:28] Branham said he said how many people
[34:29] tonight in this city would be marked by
[34:32] those he said if they sighed and cried
[34:34] for the abomination done in the city he
[34:37] said back then we know that that that
[34:39] was a prophecy that was already
[34:41] fulfilled because we know that when he
[34:42] said it took place when Titus came in
[34:44] and destroyed all the people those were
[34:46] mark were able to escape but those that
[34:48] didn't the destroying angels came in and
[34:50] destroyed them and you let me tell you
[34:52] some precision we're facing a greater
[34:54] destruction and you know we know that
[34:58] you know we talk about what we're
[34:59] just--we're just like Enoch you know
[35:01] are getting out of here but you know
[35:02] what there was a message than Enoch had
[35:04] that Enoch had to preach to the people
[35:06] and he stood there and told him that he
[35:08] pleased God he had walked so close to
[35:11] God that he would pick because it was
[35:13] God made manifest on the earth that he
[35:16] was to speak to the people and maybe
[35:18] nobody else caught it but you know what
[35:19] they saw God on display and you know
[35:22] when he came to a place that he pleased
[35:23] so please God and his walk that he just
[35:26] walked right off of the earth and let me
[35:28] tell you brother scissors that's exactly
[35:30] who we are that's our type is to please
[35:32] God so much and become so much of Jesus
[35:35] Christ in place today that we're going
[35:37] to walk right off of the earth because
[35:39] you know the thing is is what we still
[35:41] gotta just like Abraham been the
[35:43] children of Abraham the children of
[35:45] Abraham we still got to go out there
[35:47] proclaim the message that there's a way
[35:49] of salvation to a group of people says
[35:51] lost and dying nothing where we have
[35:57] people that just come and sit on a Pew
[35:58] or whatever but they've got it they
[36:00] going to know that they know that they
[36:02] know they're going to be behind that red
[36:05] that veil that they know where it's just
[36:07] you and God they've got to come behind
[36:09] the bad your skin to walk into the
[36:11] Shekinah glory not just some idea of it
[36:14] but we've actually got to know it to
[36:18] actually believe that you actually tell
[36:20] people you know what there is a way
[36:21] that's the way that you living is not
[36:23] going to make it no just pray for me not
[36:34] brother Brent said this is a message
[36:36] from the inside man he said you know you
[36:42] would you like to know what I think the
[36:44] greatest need of the church today would
[36:46] you like what I think where I think the
[36:49] blacking is is no soul travail the
[36:53] people are not broke up enough there
[36:55] there's no burden seemingly you give me
[36:59] someone that's so tore up almost lost
[37:01] souls
[37:02] about lost souls that they just cry and
[37:04] are wanting a revival so bad till they
[37:07] could hardly eat just simply can't
[37:09] he said if you read the history of the
[37:11] world in the religious history you'll
[37:13] find out that it always
[37:14] I'm taking that kind of spirit to bring
[37:16] a revival that's right see when Zion
[37:19] travailed or travel takes a better word
[37:22] why then she brought forth children see
[37:24] you have to be tore up it's the
[37:26] atmosphere of anything so are we do we
[37:32] actually have that travail do we
[37:35] actually because what one of the things
[37:39] that that's you read all things and and
[37:42] you see things and you know the there
[37:45] was there was a man that I've done just
[37:52] a little bit of studying and got to see
[37:54] a documentary on it and you know was a
[37:59] man by the name of Dwight Moody and you
[38:03] know you look at Dwight's life mr.
[38:07] Moody's life and you know here's a man
[38:10] he was not he was not tough well well
[38:15] liked her people didn't think much of
[38:17] him you know he he was a very ambitious
[38:23] man I don't know if you know some of you
[38:27] may know some of you may not know that
[38:29] he was a shoe salesman they said he was
[38:32] the best shoe salesman three States so
[38:34] shoes like nobody else when to come up
[38:38] with the idea selling shoes at a train
[38:40] station he first started selling shoes
[38:43] he outsold every shoe store in the city
[38:46] and he had such an ambition why because
[38:48] he that's that was his that was his
[38:50] passion one day a man spoke to him about
[38:54] the love of Jesus Christ about salvation
[38:58] well you know this man was foot you know
[39:00] that it didn't it didn't do away with
[39:02] the man's ambition but you know what he
[39:06] got something that was real and you know
[39:08] it started started a lot moody up so
[39:10] much that you know he went to the you
[39:12] know he won't anyone to tell everybody
[39:13] what he had he had have had to go and
[39:16] find and just let everybody know well
[39:18] you know they wouldn't they wouldn't let
[39:20] him have they wouldn't let him teach in
[39:21] the church they didn't like him well
[39:24] enough he wasn't he wasn't suited and he
[39:26] wasn't educated
[39:28] he was not in the clique so he didn't
[39:30] get a place so he couldn't do anything
[39:34] so he asked him what he could do so only
[39:37] thing you do he'd go out on the street
[39:39] sell shoes and tell everybody about
[39:40] Jesus but you know they said one day he
[39:44] come in they come in the church and he
[39:45] asked them he said can I have five rows
[39:47] in the church he said I want these five
[39:49] rows he said I want five rows he said
[39:52] why because I want to bring people to
[39:53] church well you know he took up me
[39:56] filled up five five rows bringing people
[39:58] to church well they would let him preach
[40:00] but you know what he brought five rows
[40:02] of people filled him up got them into
[40:05] church the next thing you know he had
[40:06] ten rows in the church next huh he just
[40:09] kept bringing more and more and more he
[40:11] brought so many people in because he had
[40:13] something that was burning on the inside
[40:14] of him he said he filled up a whole
[40:16] church they had to give him his own
[40:17] church when they gave him his own church
[40:20] then he started preach here they talked
[40:24] about all the different people that
[40:25] booti preached to I guess Hindman him
[40:30] and Spurgeon were probably the most that
[40:32] preached to more people than anybody
[40:33] knew they didn't have to have a radio or
[40:37] TV or tapes or books or anything like
[40:39] that you know they just got out and
[40:41] preached to people I know that I know
[40:43] that Spurgeon put all of his and you
[40:45] know he was able to take all his sermons
[40:46] and actually put them in book form and
[40:47] they sold them but you you're looking at
[40:49] what Lloyd moody come through you know
[40:51] nothing nothing deterred the man well
[40:54] because he saw the need of the people
[40:56] you know there was a time where people
[40:58] didn't want to go to the slums of the
[41:00] city the poor and the beggars and all
[41:02] these people you know that's what people
[41:04] that booty went to and he went in and
[41:07] you know they were they were kids and
[41:09] you know they credit moody ibly was was
[41:11] with creating Sunday school you know he
[41:15] went in he just started you know because
[41:17] the look is you know he had candy and
[41:19] that's how he was able to get kids in
[41:20] but you know he had a desire to feed and
[41:23] you know because he was able to get
[41:25] those kids he got their attention but
[41:28] you know what he wanted them to know
[41:29] Jesus Christ why because there was
[41:31] somebody that loved them they lived in
[41:33] that they lived in slum and people they
[41:35] just like in India you see people living
[41:38] on the street and dying on the street
[41:40] they never get in
[41:41] anything better than what they were born
[41:42] with but you know what they were
[41:45] something that Dwight Moody burnt with
[41:47] and he had to go out there and tell
[41:48] those people listen God loves you and
[41:51] he's made a way for you that when you
[41:52] leave this world you don't have to die
[41:54] and just go to hell there's a way made
[41:57] for you and I believe it was made me
[42:03] wrong but I believe it was Moody was was
[42:05] the there was a maybe I may be wrong but
[42:09] I believe it was a it was the lady that
[42:11] was in his church that you know she
[42:13] would you know because he wanted
[42:15] everybody to have this and it took it
[42:17] took this little girl that that you know
[42:18] she didn't have anything but she wanted
[42:20] to do something and moody's sent her out
[42:22] there you know to talk to everybody and
[42:25] you know she found a little boy on the
[42:26] street that didn't have anything and she
[42:28] just went up there and talked to this
[42:29] one logo every single day and told him
[42:31] that Jesus loved him and Jesus you there
[42:35] was somebody that you know you don't
[42:37] have anything your poor your parents
[42:39] hates you
[42:40] you look at your life but you know what
[42:41] there's a place beyond this mortal veil
[42:44] that you can go to and God will take
[42:46] care of you and you know and and so when
[42:49] he went home he was so excited he told
[42:51] him the story about you know this girl
[42:53] telling about Jesus and if parents were
[42:56] so upset they beat him well you know the
[43:00] next day you went out there and she
[43:01] talked to him again well every time he'd
[43:02] come home he gets so excited he get a
[43:04] whipping and these parents were just
[43:06] beating and you know one day he was a
[43:08] knew that he was going to meet that girl
[43:09] they told him so why don't you go ahead
[43:10] and beat me now before I go to go see
[43:12] that girl because I want to go hear
[43:14] about Jesus but you know they were so
[43:19] stirred by their son's testimony you
[43:21] know what they got saved you know the
[43:25] thing is do we have that same desire do
[43:27] we have the same burn to have the same
[43:29] zeal well because we say we have the
[43:31] same Holy Ghost or maybe we just don't
[43:36] we just don't yield to the power of the
[43:38] Holy Ghost to allow us to do that and
[43:40] everybody says well we're just living in
[43:42] the time we're just leaning well you
[43:43] know what it doesn't matter you know
[43:44] what because Noah stood out there for
[43:47] 120 years and freaks to nobody but you
[43:50] know what he burned with that zeal and
[43:52] he went out there and every
[43:53] you know what he put his faith into
[43:55] action because you know he didn't have
[43:57] to just stand there and tell them God is
[43:59] going to send rain why because he went
[44:01] out there and built the are they set up
[44:03] for building our well you build their
[44:05] crazy contraption for why because you're
[44:07] going to see one of these days on their
[44:09] fulfillment and you're going to need
[44:10] that but you know they didn't believe
[44:16] that but do you and I have that same
[44:20] zeal because it's a does it burn in us
[44:23] the same way not just and then you know
[44:31] there's Spurgeon and John Wesley and and
[44:33] the different different ones all down
[44:35] through history enough didn't want to
[44:36] try to get in all of it you know that
[44:38] you read their lives and you see the
[44:40] zeal that they had and they had
[44:44] hardships and problems and everything
[44:46] that they had to overcome but you know
[44:47] what he didn't he didn't dampen their
[44:49] zeal it didn't dampen the fire that was
[44:52] inside a number of years ago there was a
[44:57] there was a man that and I don't don't
[45:02] he leave his name right now Anderson I
[45:07] think was his life thing but he might he
[45:10] uh he was a missionary and he kind of
[45:15] like Moody he was he was not well
[45:17] educated didn't have a lot of things but
[45:21] he had such a desire that was burning
[45:23] inside of him to reach people reach the
[45:26] lost you know he didn't have anything
[45:29] and a lot of the doors closed on him and
[45:33] he didn't figure out he was going to get
[45:34] anywhere but God opened the door and you
[45:38] know the thing is is when all the doors
[45:39] started closing he couldn't figure out
[45:41] why things were happening but you know
[45:42] the thing is is when the doors were
[45:43] closing the doors were opening and he
[45:45] didn't see that he became he became a
[45:48] missionary to India he was in and it was
[45:51] a missionary free and India for thirty
[45:53] years and in this time you know he would
[45:56] come home every so often and and they
[45:58] would raise funds and you know tell
[46:00] everybody about what was going on in
[46:02] India and you're trying to make sure
[46:05] that they had the fun
[46:06] to do the things that they were doing
[46:07] over there one day we he was in the
[46:11] United States and he had went to one
[46:14] church the Sunday morning and was
[46:16] traveling to another church for the
[46:17] evening service and he happened to be
[46:20] passing through in the Midwest and
[46:22] seeing this great big we feel just white
[46:24] for harvest you know is ready and you
[46:27] know he said that he saw this great big
[46:29] wheat building and when they were going
[46:32] through there as he as he continued to
[46:35] go he saw the he saw a cloud of dust and
[46:39] he couldn't figure out what was going on
[46:41] so he kept going on and and he saw the
[46:43] cloud of dust got bigger and he just and
[46:47] he so he kept going on in the dust and
[46:50] finally he got out there and he's seen
[46:51] on the combines everybody was trying to
[46:53] harvest the wheat and he couldn't find
[46:56] it so he stopped and asked one of the
[46:58] one of the farmers there has stopped and
[47:00] asked him and he said well he said well
[47:01] why are you all doing this he said you
[47:04] know it being on a Sunday so why are
[47:06] y'all out here he said I figured y'all
[47:07] are all church-going people he said I
[47:10] figured y'all would be in church and he
[47:12] said well we work but he said we got off
[47:14] we got a report he said of storms coming
[47:17] our way and he said you see all this
[47:20] weed out here he said it's ready for
[47:22] harvest but he said that storms coming
[47:25] and he said you know he said if we don't
[47:28] get this harvest in he said it's going
[47:31] to be lost and he said we could see for
[47:34] people from miles and miles everybody in
[47:36] there trying to get the harvest in and
[47:38] he said sir he said you seem like a nice
[47:40] man he said but I got to go he said
[47:41] because we got to get this harvest in
[47:43] and he started going down ray said well
[47:45] god bless you he started going down the
[47:47] road and he said it went along as he
[47:48] went down the road he said he started
[47:49] there started rain falling and then it
[47:52] wasn't long he said the hail started
[47:54] falling and he said it was so bad he
[47:56] said you couldn't go anywhere he
[47:57] couldn't see now there's just death you
[47:59] know just destruction everywhere with
[48:01] the hailstorm and he was down there
[48:03] praying that God would watch over the
[48:05] people and everything and he said God
[48:06] told him then he said he said mr.
[48:09] Anderson he said don't go back to India
[48:11] he said the United States is the ones
[48:13] that needs the missionary he said why
[48:15] because there's a storm coming and he
[48:17] said the church is not
[48:19] in the harvest he said we're not stirred
[48:21] to get in the harvest let me tell you
[48:27] brothers sisters there's a storm coming
[48:28] and people don't realize it and we've
[48:36] got people that stand around and they
[48:38] gathered their message books and they
[48:40] talk about the prophet and they look at
[48:42] different things but you know what
[48:43] they've not come in to enter the inner
[48:45] Vail they've not received the baptism of
[48:47] the Holy Ghost they've not come in but
[48:51] you know what they've got an idea
[48:52] they've got a thought they read books
[48:55] they've got belt buckles but they've not
[48:58] received him if we don't who's going to
[49:15] do it
[49:17] brothers and sisters where though we're
[49:19] the end we are the ones that are going
[49:22] to finish this up we can talk about
[49:26] having a faith that's going to rapture
[49:28] us out of here but one of the things
[49:31] that God called us he never took away
[49:32] our commission to preach to the law and
[49:36] I know that the third pole is to the
[49:38] totally lost but let me tell you
[49:40] something that stirs inside of you to
[49:42] make sure that they hear you can't save
[49:45] people but you got to make sure that
[49:47] they know we've got to make sure that
[49:53] they know let me tell you brother
[50:00] sisters is burning in my heart I can't I
[50:02] can't put it out I don't know I don't
[50:13] know what to do but you try to find Lord
[50:18] what's what's your will for us who do I
[50:21] need to speak to what do I need to do
[50:26] sometimes I feel like I've tried to yes
[50:31] I felt like I've tried to push my way
[50:33] into things and I just don't feel like
[50:35] I'm waiting on the on the Lord but you
[50:41] know what you know my brother branham
[50:44] said one time he was standing there and
[50:46] you know he was asking God said what are
[50:48] you going to do about it what are you
[50:50] going to say about it and God told
[50:53] brother Brown said what are you going to
[50:55] say about it he said I'm waiting on you
[51:01] sometimes we try to find the mind of the
[51:03] Lord and and what do we need to do what
[51:08] is it that God wants us to do because
[51:13] you know what God called us to this and
[51:15] he equipped us for this we're prepared
[51:21] our demands speaking and he was talking
[51:24] about the power of God and what's been
[51:26] given to the believers what's been given
[51:28] to the bride and we've been that we've
[51:30] been equipped we've been given
[51:32] everything that we have need of he said
[51:35] it's just like he said it's just like
[51:37] the electric grid he said you know
[51:41] people don't understand you don't have
[51:42] to understand what a generator does you
[51:44] don't even have to understand how the
[51:45] generator gets power you don't even have
[51:49] to understand how the wires are run you
[51:51] don't have to understand voltage you
[51:53] don't have to understand anything he
[51:55] said you don't have to understand the
[51:57] Transformers you don't have to
[51:58] understand that panel over there because
[52:01] you know what there's somebody they
[52:02] knows how to operate that generator
[52:04] they run the wires they run the
[52:07] Transformers out there and step the
[52:09] power down and they put it in that panel
[52:10] over there somebody run wires in that
[52:12] panel and put breakers in it and
[52:14] somebody put switches on the wall but he
[52:17] said the problem is he said we're
[52:18] standing there looking they said we
[52:20] don't even flip the switch he said to
[52:22] why the power is there but he said are
[52:24] you going to reach over there and grab a
[52:25] hold of that switch and flip the switch
[52:30] brothers and sisters the power has been
[52:32] given to us that's the reason in acts
[52:35] one where he read that he said but we
[52:36] shall receive power when the Holy Ghost
[52:39] is come upon you well we've got that
[52:41] power because it's the Holy Ghost and
[52:43] fire it's the power of the Holy Ghost to
[52:45] do what he came to do because what he
[52:47] said when he gave us the Commission he
[52:50] gave us the power to do that and brother
[52:52] the scissors we've got to go out and I
[52:54] don't you know it sometimes I don't feel
[52:56] like I don't want to what to do but I
[52:57] know God has called me and I just go
[52:59] stand and say Lord I know you're calling
[53:01] me because there's a fire inside of me
[53:03] that I can't call I can't put out I
[53:05] can't quit because I just feel like
[53:07] sometimes I'm on fire and there because
[53:09] but you know there's so I want to do
[53:11] something Lord I want to make sure that
[53:12] everybody knows and maybe it's just me
[53:15] but let me tell you brothers and sisters
[53:16] it's burning me why because I got two
[53:22] boys and you know what I want them to
[53:26] know Jesus Christ I want them to know
[53:31] who he is not just about him I want in
[53:34] them the knowing many people have come
[53:38] to place they know about God but they
[53:40] don't know him they don't know him in
[53:42] the fullness they don't know him that
[53:44] many times of you know we've just seen
[53:46] these things and let them just happen to
[53:48] us but is it real has he taken up his
[53:55] abode in you or we are we on fire
[54:00] to spread this gospel have we seen as
[54:05] the scripture tells us when Jesus raised
[54:09] from the dead he came to the he came to
[54:12] the disciples he came to the ones that
[54:15] followed him and he made himself known
[54:17] with infallible proofs of his
[54:19] resurrection do you and I have those in
[54:22] fallow have we seen that infallible do
[54:25] we have that infallible proof that he's
[54:26] risen from the dead so we should be
[54:31] rolling fire and burning tonight God has
[54:38] given it to us
[54:39] I tell you tonight oh I don't know what
[54:44] to do sometimes but I know he's real and
[54:49] I want you I want you to know that he's
[54:51] real I want you to know whatever you
[54:53] have need of he's here to meet it we've
[54:57] got a lot of lost got a long lost family
[55:09] but do we do what we need to for God to
[55:16] use us to get a hold of them that's what
[55:23] I want to know right because I want to
[55:29] be used of God I want to make sure that
[55:34] there's not one person you know there
[55:38] was them there was a man on the on the
[55:42] Titanic and he worked with Dwight Moody
[55:46] and he was a minister and you know he
[55:51] went out there and the Titanic was
[55:54] sinking and this man went out there and
[55:58] you know they thought they told us that
[56:02] you've got to get in the boat you've got
[56:05] to get in the boat you're too valuable
[56:09] because you've got to run that you've
[56:11] got to run the moody church and there's
[56:13] so many things that people are looking
[56:15] for you to be a leader and he told us
[56:18] said no he said he said I can't get into
[56:22] a boat he said until I witness to every
[56:25] person that I can about the great
[56:27] lifeboat that's going to take us into
[56:29] glory and he stood there and as that
[56:32] ship was sinking and everything was
[56:33] going on they said he stood on the bow
[56:35] and he was standing there with a Bible
[56:37] in one hand and a finger pointed to the
[56:38] heaven and he was just screaming out as
[56:41] much as he could as loud as he could to
[56:43] everybody to reach and save yourselves
[56:46] through Jesus Christ because he is that
[56:48] one that will save you you know after
[56:53] the boat had
[56:54] they had a they had a memorial service
[56:58] later they didn't never recover this
[56:59] gentleman's body and and they went to
[57:01] they were and the moody church they were
[57:03] having a memorial service and it wasn't
[57:04] a man who stood up in the back and he
[57:09] said I hope I'm not out of line but he
[57:12] said I have something to say he said
[57:19] this demand the chore that I can't think
[57:22] of his name but they said this Minister
[57:26] that you're having the memorial service
[57:29] to not four he said people don't know
[57:32] what happened to him but he said I do he
[57:34] said I was trying to float on a piece of
[57:37] furniture and it was a man hanging on
[57:41] for dear life in the distance and he
[57:44] kept yelling out to me said son do you
[57:46] know Jesus
[57:47] son do you know Jesus and when he and he
[57:53] said he prayed with me the sinner's
[57:55] prayer and when he done that he said he
[58:00] was so covered in ice and in the rain he
[58:02] was so frozen that he just end up
[58:04] slipping off and he slipped off into the
[58:06] water and he stood there and he said I'm
[58:09] that man's last convert and you know
[58:14] things like that just just strike you
[58:17] because you know God never called us to
[58:19] go out like that but you know sometimes
[58:30] the neighbors know does everybody know
[58:34] people that come in contact with you
[58:37] because you know sometimes it's it's not
[58:39] people people can see your life and they
[58:41] know you're Christian but do they know
[58:44] that we talk to them and let them know
[58:49] do you know Jesus not just not just a
[58:54] folder an idea but do you know Jesus and
[58:59] everybody's like we do you know who
[59:01] brother Branham is do you know do you
[59:02] know the seven seals do you know these
[59:04] different things know
[59:07] you know Jesus have you ever prayed for
[59:13] God to forgive you of your sins you know
[59:19] I've got friends that you know they have
[59:26] this mentality and I know you do too
[59:28] they have friends and maybe family that
[59:31] have this mentality that you know
[59:32] they're trying to find something and you
[59:38] see people it's like well you know I'm a
[59:39] good person you know I believe in God
[59:44] and I go to church and you know and
[59:47] they're trying to give their reasons why
[59:53] they think that you know there's there's
[59:55] a formula there's a way to get in and
[1:00:01] you keep trying to tell people listen
[1:00:03] you don't have anything that God wants
[1:00:07] they just want your soul it's not your
[1:00:11] good works it's not your good looks it's
[1:00:14] not it's not how smart you are
[1:00:15] or anything else about you but there's a
[1:00:18] soul that's on the inside of you that's
[1:00:20] what God names and yes you're not ever
[1:00:22] going to be good enough and you're not
[1:00:24] ever going to be able to do anything
[1:00:25] good enough but if you ever come to the
[1:00:28] place where you come to this place where
[1:00:31] you can say god I am nothing and you're
[1:00:35] everything there's nothing that I bring
[1:00:38] I don't have anything just like just
[1:00:44] like Cain and Abel there was there was a
[1:00:49] blood sacrifice today that Abel brought
[1:00:54] because Cain is trying to trying to
[1:00:56] bring something that he had had work to
[1:00:59] do he had done something he had had
[1:01:02] cultivated something he tried to make
[1:01:04] something but you know what it was never
[1:01:08] going to be but when Abel stood there
[1:01:11] and said there's something has to die
[1:01:13] for me there was a blood sacrifice given
[1:01:17] for me and that was the
[1:01:21] revelation that it took and that's what
[1:01:24] it takes for you and I we've got and you
[1:01:26] try to share with people listen it
[1:01:28] you're not going to ever be good enough
[1:01:30] and you're not going and it's not group
[1:01:31] your good works just going to get you in
[1:01:35] it's God and only God it's not God and
[1:01:39] anything else but my question is do you
[1:01:44] know Jesus not do I know the message do
[1:01:51] I know the Bible you know they talked
[1:01:55] with brother Branham that said you know
[1:01:57] so you don't know your Bible he said no
[1:02:00] but I know the author real well do you
[1:02:03] know Jesus we've been called to be
[1:02:06] witnesses and that's that's what I want
[1:02:10] to note for you to know yes I'm not
[1:02:14] perfect but I am in him but I want you
[1:02:19] to know that you know every day I wake
[1:02:22] up I'm still claiming the blood I have I
[1:02:27] haven't a sacrifice that covers me you
[1:02:31] know what you and I we have to do the
[1:02:33] same thing but do you know him do you
[1:02:36] know him and the power of his
[1:02:38] resurrection if you don't he's here
[1:02:45] because I want everybody to make it and
[1:02:51] so tonight I saw stand that's what
[1:02:53] that's what I want to share with you
[1:02:55] tonight it's just been burning in my
[1:02:58] heart for a while
[1:03:07] bless you
[1:03:10] I want I want to be used of God and
[1:03:24] maybe it's just one one act you know
[1:03:28] brother Brown said he'd train a man for
[1:03:30] years and years and just using for six
[1:03:34] months you know John spend just about
[1:03:38] his entire life in the woods and the
[1:03:39] wilderness come out for a short message
[1:03:43] I believe brother Brent was the one that
[1:03:52] tells a story about Dwight Moody about
[1:03:57] the about the woman that Felton had the
[1:03:59] burden on her heart to have a meeting
