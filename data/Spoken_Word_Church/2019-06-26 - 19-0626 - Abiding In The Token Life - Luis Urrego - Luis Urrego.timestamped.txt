[2:42] how many appreciate the Lord Amen oh I
[2:46] hope you were happy to be in the house
[2:47] of God this afternoon
[2:48] I certainly have so much to thankful
[2:51] thank him for we are privileged people
[2:54] in this our Saints to know the things
[2:57] that we know but not just to know them
[2:59] amen to be able to apply them to our
[3:00] lives to have that ability to apply them
[3:03] amen and certainly it's a honor and a
[3:07] privilege and I'm so thankful to the
[3:09] Lord for it
[3:09] amen so if you want to turn with me to
[3:14] Exodus chapter 12 Exodus chapter 12 I
[3:17] want to speak this evening on the little
[3:21] topic called abiding in the token life
[3:23] amen
[3:25] so the token is something that's
[3:30] probably very familiar to all of us but
[3:33] we just want to speak about it maybe
[3:35] dissect it a little bit more taking this
[3:38] scripture and let's see how the Lord
[3:40] leads a man you pray for us a man you
[3:42] pray for me because certainly you have
[3:46] we have notes and you prepare yourself
[3:48] but ultimately is what God wants to
[3:50] speak right Amen that's what we want to
[3:52] we want to yield ourselves to give you
[3:54] for the Lord to give to you through us
[3:58] what you need amen
[3:59] praise the Lord so that's what we desire
[4:01] amen so let's just read this Exodus
[4:04] chapter 12 verse 1 it says and the Lord
[4:07] spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land
[4:08] of Egypt saying this month shall be unto
[4:12] you the beginning of months it shall be
[4:15] the first month of the year to you speak
[4:18] ye unto all the congregation of Israel
[4:21] saying in the tenth day of this month
[4:24] they shall take to them every man a lamb
[4:27] according to the house of their fathers
[4:29] a lamb foreign house and if the
[4:33] household be too little for the lamb let
[4:36] him and his neighbor next next unto his
[4:40] house take it according to the number of
[4:42] the souls every man according to his
[4:45] eating shall make your your account for
[4:49] the lamb your lamb shall be without
[4:51] blemish
[4:52] a male of the first year you shall take
[4:55] it out from the sheep or from the goats
[4:59] and ye shall keep it up until the
[5:02] fourteenth day of the same month and the
[5:05] whole Assembly of the congregation of
[5:08] Israel shall kill it in the evening
[5:12] notice I said the whole Assembly and
[5:15] they shall take of the blood and strike
[5:18] it on the two side posts and on the
[5:20] upper doorpost of the houses wherein
[5:23] they shall eat it and they shall eat the
[5:26] flesh in that night roast with fire and
[5:29] unleavened bread and with bitter herbs
[5:32] they shall eat it
[5:33] eating out of it raw nor sodden at all
[5:36] with water but roast with fire his head
[5:39] with his legs and with the pertinence
[5:42] thereof amen and ye shall let nothing of
[5:46] it remain until the morning and that
[5:49] which remaineth of it until the morning
[5:52] ye shall burn with fire and thus shall
[5:55] you eat it eat it with your loins girded
[5:58] your shoes on your feet and your staff
[6:02] in your hand and ye shall eat it in
[6:05] haste it is the Lord's Passover thanks I
[6:10] believe in verse 11 amens just as just
[6:13] as revelations 10 verse 11 amen
[6:19] that's what we should be doing in this
[6:21] hour and man we should be eating this
[6:23] lamb mmm ready to go because it's
[6:26] supposed to a man we're this thing's
[6:28] about to finish up amen and so I believe
[6:31] that that's what we need to be doing as
[6:33] the Bride of Christ so let's just let's
[6:35] just bow our heads tonight
[6:36] our Heavenly Father we thank you Lord
[6:38] for once again allowing us the privilege
[6:40] Lord Jesus to speak father God to your
[6:43] people Lord God father God you helped me
[6:46] Lord Jesus to only say father god those
[6:49] things that would edify you Lord and or
[6:51] would glorify you and edify the people
[6:54] or God Lord I I commit myself into your
[6:57] hands now and Lord just bless father God
[6:59] those that have needs amongst us we
[7:01] thank you Lord God for what you're doing
[7:03] and brother Colley Lord and we approve
[7:05] Heavenly Father for your healing hand
[7:07] Lord for father God has certainly been
[7:09] on our hearts these last few days
[7:11] Lord Jesus we commit the service into
[7:14] your hands father god we honor you we
[7:16] glorify you and we put our sins under
[7:19] the blood of Jesus Christ right now
[7:20] father God and thank you father and ask
[7:23] you these things in the name of the Lord
[7:24] Jesus Christ amen
[7:26] may God bless you says you may be seated
[7:32] amen
[7:34] abiding in the token life Saints you
[7:38] know we see in in the scriptures that
[7:40] this is not just the only scripture that
[7:42] that is representative of what of what
[7:45] this is talking about Amen we see in
[7:47] other places that we don't have time to
[7:49] get into maybe there'd be another part
[7:51] to a part three or whatever we'll see
[7:53] how the Lord leads but this right here
[7:56] gives us and let us know how important
[7:59] it is
[7:59] amen - not only abide by the
[8:02] instructions of that God has given us
[8:05] amen and this our God has given us
[8:08] instructions they men God has given us a
[8:10] message for this day amen and it's not a
[8:13] message that he gave us a man for us to
[8:15] just have it on a shelf Amen or for us
[8:17] to just read it and-and-and-and and be
[8:20] like the men they're in James that he
[8:22] looks up on the mirror Amen and sees
[8:24] himself but doesn't do anything about it
[8:26] hey man it's like you looking at the
[8:28] mirror in the morning you wake up with
[8:30] your nasty breath and your hair all over
[8:32] the place and you know you got to brush
[8:34] your teeth you gotta brush your hair
[8:35] you're gonna do all these things but you
[8:37] just kind of look and then you just keep
[8:38] going and I believe that's how many of
[8:41] us are taking the Word of God in this
[8:43] house amen we're just sort of look and
[8:45] we're happy because we just glanced but
[8:49] in hand we got to see we got it look a
[8:51] man in order for us to be able to do
[8:52] something about it amen because if you
[8:55] don't do anything about it God is not
[8:56] going to force you amen
[8:58] God is a God is a God of he's a
[9:01] gentleman as brother branham said he
[9:03] doesn't force any of us to serve Him he
[9:06] wants you to do it out of your own heart
[9:08] he wants you to fix yourself in the
[9:11] mirror out of your own heart amen he's
[9:14] given you the tools he's given you the
[9:15] the way to do it amen but ultimately
[9:18] it's you that has to do with amen
[9:20] and God did not give us a message in
[9:22] this our Eman sent the prophet in this
[9:24] day for us to just sit around amen and
[9:27] not do anything about what that message
[9:29] says I believe that brother Branham was
[9:32] sitting here a man he would be he would
[9:35] he would be I would let you ask this
[9:38] question would he'd be upset
[9:41] would he be what's the word I'm looking
[9:44] for
[9:44] would he be this this disillusioned of
[9:47] what's going on around in this hour or
[9:51] would he be happy you think about it
[9:56] Saints so so this message census was
[10:03] sent to us amen for us to apply amen
[10:06] because we're Saints this is a as as
[10:09] brother Wade was talking about Sunday
[10:11] this is a word that needs to be lived
[10:15] amen it's a living word in this hour
[10:19] that needs to be that needs to be
[10:21] displayed to the people they meant that
[10:23] needs to be displayed to out to the
[10:25] outside amen
[10:26] a living word amen an eternal sign amen
[10:32] praise God you know when when when Noah
[10:37] was given that that sign amen that was
[10:39] an eternal sign that rainbow Amen I had
[10:44] to do with his covenant amen
[10:46] it was eternal and if you've got the
[10:47] Holy Ghost in this Howry menu you should
[10:49] be displaying that eternal sign amen
[10:51] because that is the token and this hour
[10:54] which we will get into here in just a
[10:56] moment amen so so here in Exodus chapter
[10:58] 12 verse 3 it says speak ye unto and if
[11:01] the brothers could just bring it up and
[11:03] we're just kind of gonna go verse by
[11:05] verse I just I love doing this because
[11:07] just kind of take our time amen
[11:10] we just I don't think we have any rush
[11:13] going anywhere but we'll try not to keep
[11:14] you long tonight
[11:15] amen in Exodus burst Exodus 12 verse 3
[11:18] says speak ye unto all the congregation
[11:20] of Israel saying in the tenth day very
[11:24] interesting that it says in the tenth
[11:27] day put that put that and apply that
[11:29] rebel
[11:29] in Chapter ten of this month they shall
[11:33] take to them every man a lamb according
[11:37] to the house of their fathers a lamb for
[11:41] in house amen praise the Lord so you see
[11:44] how it says that a lamb for an house
[11:47] each house had to have their own land
[11:50] each house had to have their own
[11:53] sacrifice that they were going to
[11:55] sacrifice it wasn't enough for for the
[11:58] further for the priests to have the lamb
[12:00] it wasn't enough for Moses to have a
[12:03] lamb it wasn't enough for the next-door
[12:04] neighbor to have the lamb they each one
[12:07] had to have their own lamb
[12:10] praise God and same thing in this our
[12:12] Saints each one of us has to have own
[12:15] lamp it ready amen in our lives amen you
[12:20] have to have your your own experience
[12:24] with Christ it's not enough that Brazil
[12:27] has this experience that's that has
[12:29] nothing to do with you it's not another
[12:32] brother Boyd has an experience or
[12:33] brother weight or anybody here has their
[12:35] own experience young people you have to
[12:37] have your own experience amen it's not
[12:39] enough that your mom and dad a man
[12:41] brought you here to church amen or that
[12:44] they have their own experience you have
[12:46] to have your own experience with Christ
[12:47] you have to have your own lamb amen
[12:50] ready praise the Lord and each household
[12:54] had to have the lamb ready amen in their
[12:56] house so the question is is do we have
[12:59] the lamb in our house ready is the token
[13:03] going to be displayed in the house is
[13:05] the token going to be displayed praise
[13:08] the Lord so says and if oh yeah first
[13:17] yeah
[13:18] verse three according to the house their
[13:20] father is a lamb for in house amen so
[13:24] there must be there there was gonna be a
[13:26] lot of lambs a lot of lands because
[13:31] there was a lot of people amen and if
[13:34] they were listening to that message they
[13:37] were gonna put it into action but if
[13:39] they really care about what was going on
[13:41] that he really cared that he take
[13:42] seriously like most people in this day
[13:45] don't don't take it seriously what was
[13:48] given to us in this hour amen
[13:51] then they were not gonna apply that in
[13:52] their life now verse 4 it says and if
[13:54] the household be too little for the lamb
[13:57] in other words if the house doesn't have
[14:01] enough members let's say it's just a
[14:03] husband and a wife and you know if you
[14:06] say if you take a lamb
[14:08] now lamb is is is the is the is the baby
[14:12] form of the of the animal you see and
[14:17] then there's the sheep there who is the
[14:18] adult right so the lamb even even a
[14:23] small little lamb is still part is too
[14:25] much for just two people right even
[14:28] three people right to eat so the the
[14:31] Bible's here here says if the household
[14:33] be too little for the lamb in other
[14:36] words there's not enough people to eat
[14:38] that lamp because remember they had to
[14:40] eat the whole thing
[14:42] mimin they had to eat the whole day and
[14:44] God made a provision for them for that
[14:46] because I mean not everybody had 15 kids
[14:50] maybe there was there was some that
[14:52] couldn't even have kids right maybe
[14:54] there was want some that just had one
[14:56] kid some had two right so if the
[15:01] household be too little for the lamb let
[15:03] him and his neighbor next unto his house
[15:06] take it take what take that lamb right
[15:09] according to the number of the souls
[15:12] they meant in other words you're gonna
[15:15] you have to get with your neighbor
[15:16] or whoever you think will be able to
[15:19] share that lamb with with you or you
[15:21] share that lamb with them according to
[15:24] the and and and and be able to divide
[15:28] that lamb according to the number of the
[15:32] souls amen every man according to his
[15:35] eating shall make your account for the
[15:37] lamb so when they were young when the
[15:40] neighbor when you and your neighbor
[15:42] would come together you would portion
[15:43] out that lamb according to what you'd
[15:46] think you can eat right and that's
[15:49] exactly a man what God was telling them
[15:51] to do a man and I believe Saints that
[15:54] God has given us a lot
[15:56] a great great revelation in this hour
[15:58] we're blessed we're blessed here as a
[16:01] church to rehab what we have amen
[16:03] and then we I thank God for the amen
[16:06] but amen I believe that Saints the world
[16:10] out there needs to also receive and
[16:13] and hear what we get in here as well
[16:16] they meant that's the reason why I fully
[16:19] don't agree with just as us for no more
[16:22] amen III I think that we need to go out
[16:25] and share amen what God has given us oh
[16:28] it's it's all it's great it's wonderful
[16:31] that we have what we have
[16:32] amen and I love that what God is given
[16:35] through brother Dale any man but it's
[16:37] not enough that brother Dale has it amen
[16:39] you got to have it for yourself
[16:40] amen praise God and you know sometimes
[16:44] things we take this attitude that if
[16:46] somebody's wrong or somebody said
[16:47] something wrong or somebody believed
[16:49] something in a certain way maybe that's
[16:51] just a phase that they're going through
[16:52] that doesn't mean that they're like that
[16:55] Amen have we sat down and talked with
[16:58] the brother have we sat down and talked
[17:00] with the sister amen
[17:02] but sometimes we get this critical
[17:04] spirit on us that we here have the truth
[17:07] we're the ones who got it all and nobody
[17:10] else has that's not the right attitude
[17:12] attire that's not the right attitude to
[17:16] take because you're not gonna win
[17:18] anybody through to Christ if you with
[17:20] that attitude you're not gonna win
[17:25] anybody to Christ with that attitude
[17:27] you're not gonna help anybody we're
[17:29] supposed to be a light and how are we
[17:32] gonna be able to share the light out
[17:33] when we would just want to keep it here
[17:35] to ourselves
[17:36] yeah amen that's not the attitude say
[17:39] you see God was telling them amen if you
[17:42] have too much of the lamb for your
[17:44] household be willing to share it's
[17:48] exactly what he was saying everyman
[17:51] brotherly kindness that's exactly right
[17:53] brotherly kindness I just sometimes it
[17:59] bothers me that sometimes we get these
[18:02] critical spirits on us I'm just gonna
[18:06] bring it down home saying
[18:07] you you you just eat the lamb alright
[18:10] you don't laugh cuz III go for me too
[18:13] I have to eat this lamb to this lamb was
[18:17] had to be eaten with bitter herbs as
[18:19] well
[18:19] so we go through hard times but with
[18:22] it's also by just going through those
[18:24] hard times I mean we can experience the
[18:25] sweetness of the lamb as well they meant
[18:27] praise God amen
[18:30] now verse five says your lamb shall be
[18:32] without blemish a male of the first year
[18:37] you shall take it out from the Sheep or
[18:40] from the goats Amen now this lamb a man
[18:43] had to be without blemish amen in other
[18:48] words you could not have a lamb you
[18:51] could not have a lamb that was lame or
[18:55] blind or had or had some sort of blemish
[19:01] on it amen
[19:02] it had to be a perfect lamb that was the
[19:05] only land that God was going to receive
[19:07] if they were to really but if they
[19:10] really believed the message of that hour
[19:13] that was the type of land that they had
[19:16] to take a men now I want us to to read a
[19:20] scripture and if the brothers could turn
[19:23] to it in in Malachi chapter 1 verses 6
[19:27] through 8 amen because Saints Israel in
[19:37] Leviticus they were given the ordinances
[19:40] of how these you know officially how
[19:43] this lamb should have been should be
[19:44] taken but then it came to a point Saints
[19:47] that Israel would offer these lambs and
[19:50] it just became such a ritual for them
[19:55] such a routine for them that they came
[19:59] to a point where they just offered up
[20:01] anything to the and they didn't even
[20:04] care now I want you to read what it says
[20:07] here in Malachi chapter 1 it says verse
[20:11] Texas has a son this is God speaking
[20:13] through Malachi a son honoureth his
[20:16] father and a servant his master if then
[20:21] I'd be a father where's mine honor right
[20:24] in other words God saying a son if you
[20:28] have a son or daughter they honor their
[20:31] father in other words in Israel there
[20:34] was sons and daughters who honored their
[20:35] parents right a servant his master
[20:40] they had servants amen they would honor
[20:43] the the Masters we get would get honored
[20:46] by their servants right but then God is
[20:48] asking if then I be a father where is
[20:51] mine honor yeah when I ask you that
[20:56] question if he's Father if he's if he's
[21:01] your father
[21:02] where is the honor that you should give
[21:04] him are you giving him honor through
[21:08] your life or is it wishy-washy
[21:11] yeah well I've got a church I do what
[21:15] I'm supposed to do amen III I'm here
[21:19] yeah but are you giving him honor
[21:22] through your life because remember
[21:23] Saints it's a life lived that God is
[21:27] looking for the life of Christ he
[21:29] doesn't care that you that you just show
[21:33] up but what's your reason for showing up
[21:36] amen young people what's the reason for
[21:39] you showing up amen what's the reason
[21:44] for you to listen to your parents what's
[21:47] the reason for you to he that that that
[21:50] that has been instructed to you for all
[21:52] these years
[21:53] do you just do it so you don't get in
[21:55] trouble I'm speaking to everybody or do
[22:01] you do it because in your heart I want
[22:02] to honor the father I have my father
[22:06] here on earth but my true father
[22:08] amen I want to honor him amen because in
[22:11] honoring your true father your heavenly
[22:14] father you're not gonna have any
[22:15] problems honoring your earthly father or
[22:17] your earthly mother amen
[22:19] you're not gonna have any issues obeying
[22:21] when they tell you to stop doing this or
[22:23] don't do that or do this and to go this
[22:26] way amen
[22:27] you're not going to have any issues at
[22:28] all if it's if it's in the word if you
[22:31] and if it's godly counsel
[22:33] you won't have any issues whatsoever why
[22:35] because you're in love with your father
[22:36] man hallelujah amen and if I'd be a
[22:41] master which God is our master right
[22:44] where is my fear in other words where is
[22:47] that fear that you should have for me if
[22:49] I'm your master if you say that I'm your
[22:52] master this is God speaking if you say
[22:54] I'm your master where is the fear that
[22:56] you should fear me amen
[22:57] in other words uh-uh not not to be
[23:01] scared of God but but but but to be uh
[23:05] that's a godly it's a godly fear Amen no
[23:10] reverence Amen of it it's exactly right
[23:13] and if I be a master where's my fear set
[23:16] the Lord of Hosts unto you o priests
[23:18] that despise my name now he's talking to
[23:24] people who He gave His Word to - to do
[23:27] these these sacrifices and to do these
[23:29] things and they came to a point where
[23:31] they despised the name of the Lord
[23:33] ah why because they've led it they let
[23:38] it to be so common so routine in their
[23:40] life that they came to a point man just
[23:43] enough it's another it's another
[23:45] communion service I know there I go
[23:48] they're gonna pass around the plate and
[23:50] in the you know we get her and we drink
[23:52] the wine and then everybody comes up
[23:54] washes their feet and not thinking about
[23:57] it what the what that all that means not
[24:01] thinking one minute what all them is not
[24:02] work cuz you've taken it as a routine
[24:07] that's what I'm talking about Saints
[24:09] right what are we doing here
[24:12] Oh priests that despise my name and ye
[24:17] say wherein have we this but and so the
[24:19] priests are asking where have we
[24:21] despised your name and you know that
[24:26] Lord knows more than you do no load
[24:28] knows better when you think you're
[24:30] getting away with things and you think
[24:32] that you got it all figured out God's
[24:34] got something else there that you would
[24:37] have no idea you offer verse seven you
[24:40] offer polluted bread upon mine altar and
[24:43] ye say we're in
[24:46] have we polluted thee in other words
[24:49] they're asking that question where and
[24:50] what have we polluted the Lord in that
[24:54] ye say the table of the Lord is
[24:56] contemptible now that we're contemptible
[24:58] means that there's no know that it can
[25:02] be it can be despised it can be hated
[25:04] yeah you know it is really not not
[25:08] taking it for what it really means the
[25:12] table you say and that ye say that's
[25:15] this is the point that they got to they
[25:17] started saying the things of the Lord
[25:20] eggs you know just go to church or not
[25:29] because that's how it's gotten to not
[25:31] nowadays it's okay to miss a service
[25:34] here but it's not okay that's your own
[25:40] that's your your own idea that's your
[25:41] own plan it's not in God's plan it's not
[25:45] even it's not in God's plans that it's
[25:46] not it's not in his word in that ye say
[25:49] the table of the Lord is contemptible
[25:51] and if you offer the blind for sacrifice
[25:54] now watch this is what he's talking
[25:56] about these lambs remember he told them
[25:58] in there an exorcist after Toby shall
[26:00] offer a lamb without blemish now they
[26:03] come to a point if you offer the blind
[26:05] for sacrifice blind lambs or blind
[26:08] animals for sacrifice is it not evil
[26:11] right and if you offer the lame and sick
[26:13] is it not evil offer it now unto thy
[26:17] governor in other words now he's saying
[26:20] you give the governor that in other
[26:24] words if let's say President Trump came
[26:27] through here right now I bet you some of
[26:31] you the one you guys are sleeping right
[26:33] now you would not be doing that right
[26:35] now but yet we're in the presence of God
[26:41] and that's what we do it that's exactly
[26:44] what Malachi was saying is it not evil
[26:47] and if you offer the lame mistake is it
[26:49] not evil offer it now unto thy governor
[26:51] will he be pleased with thee or accept
[26:55] thy person you offer what you do every
[26:58] day in your life
[26:59] the way you act in church the way you
[27:01] live your life down a daily basis oh the
[27:04] church people may not know what you do
[27:06] at home but you do and God knows what
[27:09] you do at home or don't do at home we do
[27:13] what if and if and if president Trump
[27:15] would walk in here or whoever you think
[27:17] is the greatest person on earth walks in
[27:20] here I bet you that the attitude that
[27:23] you come to church most of us come to
[27:25] church with that's not the attitude that
[27:27] you would have young people the attitude
[27:31] that you come to church with are you
[27:48] that you're about to bite your whole
[27:50] finger off if you but can you explain
[27:54] what's being taught the Saints this is
[27:58] life coming to the house of God it
[28:02] should be life it should be something
[28:04] that you love that you want I can't wait
[28:06] to go to the house of God and get free
[28:08] from the from my job amen where there's
[28:10] cursing amen
[28:11] there's there's all kinds of hypocrisy
[28:13] and all kinds of stuff and that's the
[28:15] only rest place that I have throughout
[28:17] the week it's the word amen will he be
[28:26] pleased with D or accept thy person set
[28:28] the Lord of Hosts what an analogy that
[28:32] God gave there so they got to a point
[28:35] where they were where they were told
[28:39] them and I've had believes in Leviticus
[28:41] somewhere in Leviticus where God give
[28:43] tells him again to not offer lambs or
[28:46] animals with blemishes so he put it in
[28:49] he put it into into into the law and
[28:53] these priests came still under the law
[28:56] they didn't care anymore
[28:57] oh we've come 40 50 years now since the
[29:01] message has come and we've we've we've
[29:03] got some of us have gone so far away
[29:06] from what from what the way you acted
[29:10] when you first believed
[29:12] you're so loose now I'm so loose now we
[29:17] don't take God seriously anymore until
[29:20] we're left behind and until we until
[29:22] until we're death dead spiritually
[29:25] completely then you realize my goodness
[29:28] what have I done
[29:29] don't let that don't you don't come to
[29:31] that point young people take life
[29:38] seriously now right hey man take this
[29:42] word seriously what is it that my mom
[29:45] and dad have tried to tell me for 16
[29:47] years 18 years it's time for you to
[29:51] experience God for yourself amen it's
[29:56] okay that you have like I preached last
[29:59] times okay for you to have goals it's
[30:00] okay for you to have visions that's good
[30:02] and you need to do those things ain't
[30:04] man but place the Lord always before you
[30:07] put God first and everything before
[30:10] anything else because let me tell you
[30:13] every single thing that you do in this
[30:15] life whether it's marriage or whether
[30:18] it's it's all those things those things
[30:21] are good but you whatever you think the
[30:25] rosy things that you're thinking it's
[30:28] only temporal eventually it comes down
[30:32] to a relationship between you and God I
[30:37] can go into some some some more details
[30:40] but I don't want to do that
[30:41] amen the things because I was once young
[30:46] brother Dale was young for the Wade was
[30:48] young but the boy was really young
[30:50] [Laughter]
[30:56] we've all had all evens our sisters have
[31:00] all gone through those thoughts gone
[31:03] through those motions and great when God
[31:08] gives us a partner in life and lets us
[31:11] love somebody amen but ultimately it has
[31:16] it's between you and God
[31:20] ultimately you'll come down to it when
[31:23] you've experienced what marriage is and
[31:25] the benefits of marriage and all those
[31:28] things you know
[31:29] wonderful wonderful but then it comes
[31:32] down to I still have to serve the Lord
[31:37] boil it down I still got to serve God
[31:40] and you and your partner has to have his
[31:42] own relationship with God too or her own
[31:44] relationship with God amen
[31:48] praise the Lord how did I get into that
[31:49] amen where's God now you look at Cain
[31:54] Saints Cain came to a point well he
[31:56] probably he probably heard maybe what
[31:59] was needed to be offered he probably he
[32:05] probably knew but it wasn't revealed to
[32:08] him amen it wasn't it wasn't a
[32:11] revelation when something becomes a
[32:13] revelation they meant you go and do it
[32:16] amen and so that's the reason why he
[32:19] came in here Oh God God will take fruit
[32:23] just as much as he took my brothers
[32:25] offering my brother is offering a lamb a
[32:31] sloppy look at look at look at that
[32:33] altar it's all dirty and nasty and
[32:36] bloody but look how clean mine is and
[32:38] I'm sure God will take it you'll be
[32:42] surprised you'd be surprised what you
[32:46] think God will take in your life right
[32:48] and then you wonder why you're not
[32:51] growing in Christ what why I'm not I'm
[32:54] not going I don't understand whenever I
[32:57] go to church I don't understand what
[32:58] beam's what's being preached I don't
[33:01] understand what's being talked I don't
[33:03] understand
[33:05] what are you letting in your life that's
[33:07] taking your thoughts away from Christ
[33:10] what's in your home that's keeping you
[33:14] from continuing and moving on with
[33:16] Christ because your own you don't think
[33:20] those things matter but they have
[33:23] spirits spirits to try to keep you a man
[33:26] from people and keep walking with with
[33:28] Christ it all matters
[33:32] amen it does matter you know now Exodus
[33:38] 12:6 says no I'm sorry
[33:40] yes Exodus 12:6 and ye shall keep it up
[33:43] until the fourteenth day of the same
[33:46] month in other words keep that Lamb unto
[33:49] the fourteenth day of the same month and
[33:51] the whole Assembly of the congregation
[33:53] of Israel shall kill it in the evening
[33:58] amen amen
[34:00] so this message this message that God
[34:02] gave to Moses to give to the people was
[34:05] to be lived out and acted upon here in
[34:09] the in the evening time amen and it was
[34:12] in the evening time that God gave us the
[34:14] message that God gave us right now it's
[34:17] time to put it into action we've we've
[34:20] got we've got word after word we've got
[34:24] the letter of it from from i from 1947
[34:29] or 48
[34:30] yeah 2 to 9 1965 some of us can quote
[34:34] exactly the the paragraph number and
[34:37] everything but you still don't know what
[34:40] you still not displaying the token in
[34:41] your life you're still not applying what
[34:48] the message was brought to us to do it
[34:51] because let me ask you Saints mask
[34:55] what's more important that God sent us a
[35:00] prophet and gave us a message or taking
[35:07] that having a people take that message
[35:09] and living it out what's more important
[35:12] a lot of us still live in 1960s
[35:19] 1950s with the relics of what God did
[35:23] back then I know I don't care about
[35:25] relics that relics don't save me that's
[35:28] not the token I'm looking at a man I'm
[35:31] looking for a life amen relics don't
[35:34] save me I don't care how much we're
[35:36] brother Branham was or I don't it
[35:38] doesn't matter to me I visited
[35:41] Jeffersonville I visited these places
[35:43] but that never did anything for my
[35:45] salvation I've seen in almost all the
[35:49] pictures there brother that they took a
[35:51] brother branham never gave me the Holy
[35:53] Ghost I've listened to almost all the
[35:56] messages not one time amen it has to be
[36:02] Amen that God reveals that word to you
[36:05] so that you can put it into action
[36:07] brother Branham said clearly that the
[36:10] message is Christ now like what what
[36:14] what where the Wade said just after
[36:17] brother the team Hume said a man we're
[36:20] not giving people Christ anymore we're
[36:22] not preaching Christ anymore amen we're
[36:25] just we're just preaching them quotes
[36:27] and and and and and and but not give not
[36:32] not turning the people to Christ and
[36:33] Christ is still there waiting until you
[36:37] get off your high horse I know I got
[36:39] this quote here and then and then the
[36:41] this one counteracts what counters that
[36:44] with this quote and things like that but
[36:45] they don't know it's all about those
[36:47] things he saw those things back in the
[36:49] early days where we're past that now and
[36:54] none of that saved anybody right none of
[36:58] that saved any by Saints III say we we
[37:04] need to get in step with this word
[37:08] because Saints there's young people here
[37:11] that need the Holy Spirit there's
[37:13] there's little kids I have two girls
[37:15] that need the Holy Ghost for you to be
[37:17] fighting about some quotes and and and
[37:20] and and me and telling me to look at
[37:22] relics it's gotten so bad Saints now I'm
[37:30] just gonna
[37:31] it's gotten so bad that now they've got
[37:34] little kids and I'm not gonna say the
[37:37] entity but all of you would know it if I
[37:38] knew they got little kids making crafts
[37:41] with a door right a little house with a
[37:46] door and right out there on the front it
[37:48] says the token tape boy or something
[37:51] like that
[37:51] and they got a tape the token of the
[37:54] tape right above the door
[37:59] that's what to them that's what that's
[38:01] become the token has become a physical
[38:05] relic nothing about the life and that's
[38:10] not what they're teaching their kid the
[38:11] children and I feel terrible for these
[38:14] children the all these children that are
[38:16] being taught these things and not being
[38:18] taught what the Prophet really said
[38:21] about the token just showing them relics
[38:28] I'm gonna preach against it until I
[38:31] until I die because I can't stand seeing
[38:34] parents your parents need to be careful
[38:37] because let me tell you what he comes in
[38:39] with flatteries he comes in with
[38:41] flatteries and you're not going to be
[38:43] the seeds bye-bye a Catholic Church or
[38:46] by a by a Baptist or a Pentecostal or
[38:50] anybody like you going to be the seed by
[38:52] somebody who comes with tapes who comes
[38:54] with that with the pictures who comes
[38:56] with everything and it comes with the
[38:58] Prophet that's what you'll be deceived
[38:59] by and you know what he's doing he's
[39:02] targeting your children he's taught he
[39:07] knows that if he can get that next
[39:08] generation he's not there they are not
[39:13] receiving the message and you and it's
[39:18] up to you parents to be be careful and
[39:21] be aware nothing wrong with listen to
[39:24] the tapes you've got to listen in to the
[39:26] tapes have those tapes even playing
[39:28] every single day in your house some some
[39:32] brothers they play it 24/7 that's
[39:34] awesome brings an atmosphere good
[39:36] atmosphere but if you're not giving
[39:40] those kids a man their truth behind
[39:42] those tapes
[39:43] and you're just showing them the tape
[39:46] the tape the tape the tape you're not
[39:48] you're doing them a displeasure at this
[39:51] this disservice he comes in with
[39:58] flatteries now I did it it doesn't
[40:02] matter who's who he's the son of it
[40:04] doesn't matter to me has nothing to do
[40:09] with me in Christ amen
[40:12] but you have to answer for that if he's
[40:15] if you drift away from this word amen
[40:18] you'll be the one to answer because amen
[40:22] brother Bradley brother Brennan would be
[40:24] rolling in his grave right now with
[40:27] those types of things well you may not
[40:32] like it but that's not what brother
[40:36] Branham says in the message and I'll
[40:37] prove it to you here in just a moment
[40:39] amen now what was greater amen so this
[40:46] entire body of Christ is to be this of
[40:48] the same mind they man for the same
[40:50] cause amen
[40:52] I believe that we need to have the same
[40:55] goal the same mind the same the same
[40:57] cause a man and it's Christ amen
[41:00] praise the Lord just as Jesus he had to
[41:04] completely die out to himself so what
[41:07] must we doubt to ourselves today a man
[41:09] saying that Lamb a man that they that
[41:11] they had to eat a man it was tender a
[41:14] man it was it was young and the reason
[41:16] why he said to get again you get it
[41:17] young because usually the the young the
[41:21] young animals excuse me a calf or a lamb
[41:25] or something like that those are the
[41:26] ones that taste better right better than
[41:30] an adult cow or an adult goat
[41:34] you know usually the younger ones are
[41:37] the ones that taste better and it's and
[41:40] and and why did God say get a one that's
[41:43] younger than a year or not even more not
[41:46] more than a year because it has not had
[41:50] time to pollute itself with the things
[41:51] of the world
[41:53] you see he Christ a man he he showed
[41:58] forth all those qualities he didn't have
[42:01] time to pull it himself with the world
[42:02] with Hollywood or with with all these
[42:04] things amen
[42:06] he was all about the father's business
[42:08] and that's the lamb that we need to we
[42:12] need to prepare we need to eat amen
[42:16] praise the Lord amen
[42:20] their Exodus 12 7 brothers could bring
[42:22] that up and they shall take of the blood
[42:25] and strike it on the two side posts and
[42:28] on the upper door posts of the houses
[42:31] wherein they shall eat it
[42:34] amen so they were to take there were to
[42:38] take this blood amen if and brothers if
[42:40] you could bring up that picture the with
[42:44] the doorpost you know this this is a
[42:47] little visual saints a man they were to
[42:49] take that blood of the of the Lamb that
[42:52] they held for they took on the tenth day
[42:54] of the month held it for four days a man
[42:57] killed it and took some of that blood
[42:59] why because the Death Angel was coming
[43:01] death was striking the land death is
[43:05] gone about to strike this land or death
[43:07] is already stroke struck spiritually a
[43:09] man but the whole thing is about to go
[43:12] go up amen and death was about to strike
[43:16] and this is the message that they needed
[43:18] to do they needed to put the blood on
[43:21] the on the lentil up at the top and on
[43:23] the sides amen praise the Lord so it
[43:27] says here and on the two side posts and
[43:31] on the upper doorpost of the houses
[43:32] wherein they shall eat it in other words
[43:36] there's needed to take that blood and
[43:37] and strike it and strike it on the
[43:40] doorpost of their own house on the
[43:43] doorposts of our next-door neighbor's
[43:46] house that that's not enough that's the
[43:50] reason why as the word is going forth
[43:52] you need to see say Lord that's for me
[43:57] Lord I know you're talking to me but
[43:59] this is what we like to do
[44:04] I wonder if they're listening oh I hope
[44:08] they are this is for them and not
[44:16] knowing that you could be just like
[44:17] those priests offering just whatever in
[44:21] your life and you're thinking about
[44:23] somebody else yeah you're thinking about
[44:25] somebody else's life how they are
[44:27] walking spiritually not you you don't
[44:30] look at your own self what's wrong with
[44:33] your life are you fully serving the Lord
[44:36] do you fully have the token they on
[44:38] display hey man the blood needed to be
[44:46] applied on the doorpost
[44:48] right on the top and the button on the
[44:51] sides the brothers could bring that
[44:53] picture back up just keep it up
[44:54] until I say but why did not the Lord say
[45:00] to put the blood down into at the bottom
[45:02] of the of the threshold or at the bottom
[45:05] where the floor the entrance of the of
[45:07] that of the house why just on the sides
[45:11] well for one saints you know that this
[45:14] is representative of the cross of the
[45:17] death of Jesus Christ right that lamb
[45:19] all this Hall represents Jesus right but
[45:24] two Saints you have to look also
[45:27] remember remember what the scripture
[45:29] says I believe it's in Hebrews it says
[45:30] unless unless you trample the blood of
[45:33] Christ amen
[45:35] that we don't take this thing so
[45:37] seriously and what we do is and when we
[45:41] don't take the the things of God so
[45:42] seriously it's like you just trampling
[45:44] over the blood so God didn't want the
[45:46] blood to be trampled upon amen that's
[45:48] the reason why he wanted it around
[45:50] around the sides amen not on the
[45:52] threshold now I'm not down on the floor
[45:54] amen
[45:55] not for you to trample on it and for you
[45:58] to to to to because remember saints
[46:00] adore is for you to go in and the doors
[46:03] for you to go out right and you could
[46:08] have that blood in your life you could
[46:13] you could come to church you could do
[46:15] you go through the motions you could
[46:16] have
[46:18] justification sanctification and not
[46:23] have the baptism of the holy ghost amen
[46:28] and be able to just go out we've seen it
[46:32] people have a come in anybody Hey oh
[46:35] thank god I've got the blood
[46:37] amen and then all of a sudden you seem
[46:39] to go out and in and for you to be able
[46:44] to go out you have to go under that
[46:47] blood you have to trample the blood of
[46:51] Christ you have to go through the Christ
[46:53] who is the door amen for you to walk out
[46:57] completely God's already given to
[47:01] prevent provisions for you amen the
[47:03] blood the door everything amen he is all
[47:06] those things amen
[47:07] but for you amen to completely be wordly
[47:10] and leave this gospel and leave this
[47:12] message and leave all these things you
[47:14] have to go and face all those things
[47:15] leave all of that amen
[47:20] praise God
[47:23] Hebrews 10:29 says how much sorer
[47:25] punishment suppose ye shall be thought
[47:28] worthy who had trodden underfoot the Son
[47:31] of God and hath counted the blood of the
[47:34] Covenant wherewith he was sanctified an
[47:36] unholy thing and hath done despite unto
[47:43] the spirit of grace amen
[47:47] so you you decide if you're gonna stay
[47:51] in or stay on stay out
[47:52] but it's guaranteed a man that you'll
[47:56] died with the rest of the world when
[47:58] you're out spiritually spiritually
[48:01] speaking and that day it was physical
[48:03] death and this day is spiritual death
[48:06] and that's worse that's worse than
[48:10] physical death amen praise God so young
[48:17] people it's up to you it's up to you
[48:23] decided am I in or out you some of you
[48:28] are getting to an age that now you've
[48:30] got to make major decisions in life am I
[48:34] in or am I out right am i going with the
[48:37] with the with the world the things of
[48:39] the world the fashions of the world the
[48:41] the thing or am I gonna stay with Christ
[48:45] and man under that blood covered under
[48:48] that tokin amen that's where I want to
[48:50] be Saints in this hour and men covered
[48:53] under the blood completely I can't save
[48:54] myself and neither can you amen but well
[48:57] I know somebody that's already done it
[48:59] for me I plead the blood amen we may
[49:03] fall we may fall many times flat on our
[49:05] face Saints but if you stay hidden under
[49:09] that blood
[49:10] there's cleansing for those amen amen
[49:14] because Saints God is all about
[49:15] Redemption Saint you see he's all about
[49:19] Redemption he wants to save you he wants
[49:22] he wants to forgive you he wants to give
[49:25] you the Holy Ghost he wants to do all
[49:29] they give you all these benefits but the
[49:32] question is do you want it right do you
[49:36] want - amen
[49:42] now now brother Branham he brought this
[49:45] out this blood as as a token and of
[49:52] course the scripture talks about it as a
[49:53] token
[50:00] and a token means the definition of the
[50:05] word token means a things serving as a
[50:09] visible or tangible representation of a
[50:13] fact quality feeling etc my brother
[50:18] Branham says it like this and in the
[50:21] message token now what now what is first
[50:24] a token it's a word that's commonly used
[50:27] among we english-speaking people
[50:29] especially here in America
[50:31] a token is a really the dictionary says
[50:34] that a token is a sign it's a sign of a
[50:37] fair price paid see that the Pharaoh or
[50:42] a price a required price that's been
[50:44] paid amen
[50:47] praise the Lord so for example Saints uh
[50:50] you know what let's let's just say you
[50:53] know this is this is a gift right and I
[50:59] give it to brother Dale right well that
[51:02] is a token of my appreciation to brother
[51:05] Dale right
[51:06] you see we say that phrase a token of
[51:09] our appreciation to brother Dale but
[51:12] here's the thing Saints when I gave
[51:14] brother Dale this token every time he
[51:18] sees that token it's supposed to remind
[51:20] him of me of who gave it to him
[51:25] not-not-not it doesn't remind him of
[51:27] himself doesn't remind him of a brother
[51:30] wait because brother way had nothing to
[51:31] do with that right they're supposed to
[51:34] remind him of me
[51:35] right right and Saints if the God has
[51:39] given us the Holy Spirit in our life
[51:41] amen it shouldn't point us to anything
[51:43] else they should point us to the to a
[51:46] man it should not point us to any other
[51:48] movement he should not point us to a
[51:50] relic it should point us to the life of
[51:53] Christ itself amen
[51:54] the Holy Spirit that's the token amen
[51:58] so the token a man like for example the
[52:01] blood a man wasn't necessarily the blood
[52:04] was the token amen but really that blood
[52:07] represented that there was a life that
[52:09] took the place
[52:10] of them you came you came with that
[52:13] blood you came with that lamp and you
[52:15] slaughtered it in your mind thinking
[52:17] this this animal this innocent animal is
[52:20] taking my place amen
[52:22] and here I'm using this blood and every
[52:25] time I look at this blood it tells me
[52:27] that this animal amen took my place the
[52:31] blood itself didn't have any life
[52:35] it was the life that was in the blood
[52:37] Saints that's what I'm saying saying is
[52:40] that there is no life in relics there's
[52:43] no life in none of these things external
[52:45] things amen the chemical part of the
[52:49] message if you were to say that way
[52:51] there's only life in Christ and Christ
[52:53] is only in his word amen praise the Lord
[52:58] hallelujah Christ is in his word Christ
[53:03] is not in it Christ is not in in
[53:06] anything else outside of the word praise
[53:09] God now I want to make it a little
[53:11] simple so by the way don't maybe come
[53:16] here and help me
[53:38] you probably already heard that but
[53:41] brother John come here you can you come
[53:45] stand right here
[53:45] hey man then you already standing up

[54:29] you don't call me I hope you don't come

[54:45] from Toronto when you ride the subway
[54:46] over there and you pay your fare they
[54:49] give you a token a little little token
[54:51] and it's it's for you to give to the to
[54:55] the people that is letting you into the
[54:56] subway to the train so that you can get
[54:59] through now so so you've come here and
[55:03] you purchased you purchase the you made
[55:06] the purchase and so you're uh you're
[55:11] gonna get your token right and you're
[55:16] gonna you're gonna get your token all
[55:20] right you ready to ride the train all
[55:23] right all right you're gonna get your
[55:24] token no maybe depends how good you do
[55:32] here and you're gonna get your token all
[55:35] right now the the one that for you to
[55:38] get on the train you have to go through
[55:39] brother wait so Kaley you go ahead and
[55:42] give your token
[55:46] oh you're gonna let her it through right
[55:48] your ferret if the affair has been paid
[55:51] oh no I said her fare has not been paid
[56:09] come here John
[56:14] her brother wait was in our name now now
[56:22] you see see all of them had this is the
[56:26] token that they gave i all three of
[56:29] three of them here had had this one had
[56:32] these the greens right that we use here
[56:34] in America one of them had this this is
[56:38] so pretty it's Canadian money it's
[56:42] pretty it's it's nice yeah it doesn't
[56:47] look fake but it's it's but it's not the
[56:53] token it's not what is gonna go through
[56:57] brother wait to let them in on the train
[56:59] right it's a piece of paper it's it's
[57:03] actually looked better than these but it
[57:07] wasn't enough for her to get through the
[57:08] total through the train right so you'll
[57:14] get to ride you get to ride you get to
[57:17] ride and I guess you'll get to ride too
[57:20] so thank you very much you may be seated
[57:23] you can keep that Esther as a relic
[57:29] because you can't use it here in the
[57:31] America just just let it always remind
[57:37] you of the token yeah all right but I
[57:42] wanted to do that visual for the little
[57:44] kids to let them know you've got to have
[57:47] the token on display the correct token
[57:51] right the true token amen not not no
[57:56] substitutes no and it could look almost
[58:00] just like the real thing and not be the
[58:02] real thing right praise the Lord
[58:06] amen so the blood showed that God's
[58:10] requirement for the taking of the life
[58:12] of the Lamb for the believer was met
[58:15] that's what that blood represented amen
[58:18] amen and so that token represented it
[58:22] identified the believer amen the one
[58:24] that sacrificed they meant that Lamb and
[58:27] the blood came out it identified him
[58:29] with that lamb right
[58:31] praise the Lord Jesus because saints let
[58:36] me tell you it was okay for those
[58:38] Israelites to have the lamb right
[58:41] they had the lamb but it wouldn't matter
[58:44] nothing if they would not kill the lamb
[58:46] right they could have had the lamb but
[58:53] if they didn't kill it Martin and they
[58:55] would not be able to put that blood over
[58:57] the doorpost
[58:59] amen and so that's how that's how
[59:02] sometimes we are we nitpick or what we
[59:04] want to do I like this but I don't like
[59:07] this I'll do this and this I won't do a
[59:10] menu got to have you got to do it follow
[59:12] all of the message there's a whole
[59:14] message or it's nothing
[59:16] amen praise the Lord Jesus amen amen
[59:23] look what brother Brown says here as the
[59:26] brothers could bring up to the world
[59:28] it's a bunch of foolishness in 1963 the
[59:32] token
[59:36] I just want you to read with me I'm
[59:43] nodding I didn't give these to the
[59:45] Brethren and the orders that that we
[59:47] usually give but I'll just I'll just
[59:49] read and if they pull it up then amen
[59:52] all right to the world it's a bunch of
[59:54] foolishness but to God it's the only way
[59:58] the only thing that he requires is that
[1:00:01] token it must be there and you cannot
[1:00:05] have the token until the fare is paid
[1:00:08] then you are a possessor of the token
[1:00:12] which gives you the privilege of a free
[1:00:14] pass I'll see the blood I'll pass over
[1:00:18] you amen
[1:00:19] what a time that that what a privilege
[1:00:22] to know that you pack within you the
[1:00:24] pass notice that he says within you when
[1:00:30] I see the blood I'll pass over you it's
[1:00:33] the only thing that he'll recognize it's
[1:00:37] nothing else that can take its place no
[1:00:40] substitute no denomination no nothing
[1:00:44] else it takes that God said that alone
[1:00:48] will I see so no none of your ideas none
[1:00:53] of nobody's ideas nothing nothing else
[1:00:56] it's only Christ amen the Holy Spirit in
[1:01:00] your life is the only thing that's God's
[1:01:02] gonna see because that's the only thing
[1:01:04] that's that's God himself he only sees
[1:01:07] his own word right and that the Word of
[1:01:10] God is abiding in you about the baptism
[1:01:12] of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:01:13] which is life but that's that's the
[1:01:16] whole that's that's eternal life amen if
[1:01:19] it's about a new God sees that that he
[1:01:21] knows that you have the token on display
[1:01:22] and let me tell you what says when the
[1:01:24] Holy Ghost is abouting in you and your
[1:01:26] display and that token not just
[1:01:28] displaying internally but displaying on
[1:01:30] the outside as well it will display on
[1:01:34] the outside for everyone to see nobody
[1:01:36] will nobody will will wonder if you're a
[1:01:40] Christian or not when the token is on
[1:01:45] display for real nobody will question is
[1:01:47] she a Christian
[1:01:50] see one of the ones who whose family
[1:01:54] killed the laman and put the blood over
[1:01:56] the lentils and and they're inside
[1:02:00] eating the lamb listening to the message
[1:02:03] every day going to church every time the
[1:02:07] church doors open it I think she is yeah
[1:02:12] not just because of the way you display
[1:02:15] yourself yeah but it's the life the way
[1:02:17] you live amen because many people can
[1:02:21] add like Christian sings any many women
[1:02:24] sisters can grow their hair long many
[1:02:28] brothers can stop wearing ungodly
[1:02:31] clothes and sagging their pants and
[1:02:33] wearing all kinds of chains and all
[1:02:36] kinds of stuff all over their body
[1:02:37] tattoos and you know what you don't know
[1:02:39] and you'll need to do all those things
[1:02:41] none of those things but that doesn't
[1:02:43] mean the life of Christ is event you
[1:02:46] know that's that's only a substitute
[1:02:50] you're substituting the true token for
[1:02:53] that and we feel comfortable we
[1:02:55] sometimes we feel so comfortable
[1:02:57] hi I'm obeying my parents I do
[1:03:00] everything that I'm supposed to do and I
[1:03:03] you know I listen to my mom and dad I I
[1:03:07] don't talk back I pay attention at
[1:03:09] church I do all these things and yet
[1:03:15] really in your heart something is you
[1:03:19] really desire the world and the token
[1:03:22] the token of is not really within you
[1:03:25] amen because remember the token has to
[1:03:27] be inside hey man
[1:03:30] praise God let's read the next quote
[1:03:34] brother Browns and for that yes
[1:03:38] now for the animal life could not come
[1:03:41] back upon the human being now I want you
[1:03:43] to pay attention to this when the blood
[1:03:46] was shed the life went out of course
[1:03:48] because it was a unit and when the
[1:03:51] life's blood was gone from it the life
[1:03:53] being different from the blood now the
[1:03:55] blood is the chemistry of the life but
[1:03:59] the life is something different from the
[1:04:01] blood
[1:04:02] right because Saints the when they
[1:04:06] killed that lamb that blood amen that
[1:04:11] blood was a representation of what of
[1:04:13] them having faith on the message that
[1:04:15] Moses gave to them right but there was a
[1:04:18] deeper meaning behind that as well right
[1:04:20] so you could go through the motions of
[1:04:23] the message you could go through you
[1:04:25] could do everything you're supposed to
[1:04:26] do and still not have the life right
[1:04:29] right but the life is in the blood and
[1:04:32] the animal life could not come back upon
[1:04:34] the worshipper when he said this blood
[1:04:37] of the Lamb he had to apply the
[1:04:39] chemistry because that the life was gone
[1:04:42] and could not come back all right
[1:04:45] ned's you scroll up because it could not
[1:04:51] come upon a human being because the
[1:04:53] animal life doesn't have a soul the
[1:04:56] animal doesn't know that he is naked and
[1:04:59] he just he doesn't realize sin it knows
[1:05:02] none so therefore it's a living being
[1:05:05] but not a living soul therefore that
[1:05:09] that animal life could not come back
[1:05:12] upon a human life because it didn't have
[1:05:15] a soul in that life now there is a life
[1:05:19] a blood a life and a soul in the life
[1:05:21] the soul is the nature of the life in
[1:05:23] other words Saints when the Israelites
[1:05:25] were killing that that's the reason why
[1:05:27] they could not receive the new birth in
[1:05:29] the Old Testament because they could not
[1:05:32] do that they could they could not
[1:05:34] receive the Holy Ghost there because the
[1:05:36] perfect Lamb of God had not come which
[1:05:39] was Christ so that's why that's why in
[1:05:44] shedding animals Bloods and only covered
[1:05:48] sins for them then take away sin it only
[1:05:52] made it to where God you know God it
[1:05:55] covers it amen
[1:05:56] but it didn't take away their sin amen
[1:05:59] but when Christ came on the scene he
[1:06:01] died resurrected can't come back on the
[1:06:04] day Pentecost in the form of the Holy
[1:06:05] Ghost amen
[1:06:06] that's a different story then amen and
[1:06:08] if you if you still have sin that's
[1:06:10] because that's up to you between you and
[1:06:12] God but
[1:06:13] you as a Christian you don't have to
[1:06:15] have sin in your life amen if you
[1:06:17] believe that your sins are gone
[1:06:19] amen then your sins are gone but if you
[1:06:23] still live under condemnation if you're
[1:06:25] always condemning yourself and believing
[1:06:28] the lies of Satan telling you that your
[1:06:31] your bad
[1:06:32] your your your dirty your look what you
[1:06:35] did yesterday look what you do amen
[1:06:37] then what Christ did for you if you
[1:06:39] believe that you know what Christ did
[1:06:41] for you
[1:06:41] well not it has no effect on you right
[1:06:44] because it's upon what you believe amen
[1:06:48] do you believe that what Christ did for
[1:06:50] you you know brother Darrell he's been
[1:06:52] bringing out the salvation amen
[1:06:55] we appreciate what that series the
[1:06:57] series that he's bringing out amen
[1:06:59] it goes back to good old salvation
[1:07:02] science amen to believe that God amen
[1:07:06] has forgiven me on my sin amen praise
[1:07:10] the Lord Jesus that has to be revealed
[1:07:13] to you as a Baptist when I was in the
[1:07:17] Baptist Church amen
[1:07:18] you come to a point where you say yeah I
[1:07:20] remember when I came to the altar at 12
[1:07:23] years old and I sincerely cried and
[1:07:26] asked the Lord to forgive me for my sin
[1:07:28] I understood what the preacher was
[1:07:30] preaching about and I was I was I was
[1:07:33] sincere but you know what Saints as
[1:07:36] sincere as I was I still went out into
[1:07:39] the world and did the things of the
[1:07:41] world so you can cry that's the reason
[1:07:44] young people I say I say when you come
[1:07:49] when you go to the youth camps and all
[1:07:51] these things ain't men it's wonderful
[1:07:53] but you make sure that you get the life
[1:07:56] of Christ amen you make sure that that
[1:08:00] because I believe that we all it we
[1:08:03] should be able to go which-which it's
[1:08:06] awesome to be able to go to the to the
[1:08:07] youth camps and to do all these things
[1:08:09] amen I think how do you have all these
[1:08:11] opportunities when I was younger right
[1:08:13] praise the Lord
[1:08:14] but Saints you have to keep in mind him
[1:08:18] and it's a continual walk with Christ
[1:08:20] just because you had one experience and
[1:08:23] at the youth camp or you cried or you
[1:08:25] shout or you show
[1:08:26] or something like that which is
[1:08:28] wonderful if you did but are you growing
[1:08:31] in Christ is this word still is that
[1:08:35] token still on display or when you come
[1:08:38] back from the youth camp you're holy for
[1:08:41] about three months and then all of a
[1:08:42] sudden the holiness goes out the door
[1:08:44] then what happened to what what happened
[1:08:47] at the youth camp I'm not nothing
[1:08:50] against the youth camps I believe in
[1:08:51] them now believe that we need to take
[1:08:53] our young Peter to I believe that we
[1:08:55] need to have our young people in
[1:08:56] anything that has to do with the word I
[1:09:00] totally agree with that
[1:09:02] amen anything that involves the word
[1:09:05] have them in an atmosphere like that
[1:09:07] because otherwise you know they're just
[1:09:10] going to be feeding off over there or
[1:09:11] these other things and they'll be just
[1:09:13] grow up sort of nonchalant type tight
[1:09:15] tight yeah children I don't want my
[1:09:18] children grow like that
[1:09:19] amen I want to keep in an atmosphere
[1:09:21] where the word is going forth amen
[1:09:23] praise God mm-hmm but this glorious
[1:09:27] place let's see where we had therefore
[1:09:28] it had no certain nature it was an
[1:09:30] animal therefore the blood stood for a
[1:09:32] token that the life had been given but
[1:09:34] in this glorious place under this
[1:09:36] covenant there is a difference between
[1:09:38] the blood and the life the token for the
[1:09:40] believer today is a tape doesn't say
[1:09:48] that doesn't the whole the token for the
[1:09:52] believer today is a relic doesn't say
[1:09:57] that the token for the believer today is
[1:10:01] the Holy Ghost not a relic not a blood a
[1:10:07] chemistry but it is the Holy Spirit of
[1:10:10] God that is the token that God requires
[1:10:14] of the church today amen
[1:10:18] that's the token God must see this token
[1:10:21] God must see this token he must see it
[1:10:24] in every one of us amen
[1:10:30] I love that
[1:10:32] because you know I could have said that
[1:10:34] but it's better when the Prophet says so
[1:10:38] that so that there's no question that's
[1:10:41] the message of the day that's the
[1:10:43] message that's what brother Brandon was
[1:10:45] trying to tell us you want to display
[1:10:47] your token get it inside amen
[1:10:50] next next quote amen praise the Lord I'm
[1:10:58] almost done here saying yes a blood
[1:11:03] identified identified the believer
[1:11:06] because the life had gone out could not
[1:11:09] come back so he had to have a chemistry
[1:11:11] he had to have he had to have like a
[1:11:13] paint of a blood a chemistry that showed
[1:11:16] that life went from it now the very
[1:11:19] spirit itself is the token the Holy
[1:11:22] Spirit itself is a token not the blood
[1:11:25] see Jesus shed his blood on Calvary
[1:11:28] right and though in the denominations
[1:11:31] they did you know and a lot of people
[1:11:34] they you know that they're all about the
[1:11:36] blood and thank God for the blood but
[1:11:41] brother Brennan said himself that you
[1:11:42] could have a pint of the physical blood
[1:11:45] of Jesus Christ and you could smear that
[1:11:48] all over you you could pour it on you
[1:11:53] and still die and go to hell you see
[1:12:00] what I'm saying same young people you
[1:12:02] you could you could do everything
[1:12:04] physical that you're supposed to do you
[1:12:07] could you could just you could do
[1:12:08] everything that you need to do to get by
[1:12:10] and still die and go to hell amen
[1:12:17] the blood was shed at Calvary that is
[1:12:19] true but the blood as far as it is went
[1:12:22] back into the elements from which it
[1:12:24] come you see that blood evaporated that
[1:12:28] blood where's the blood of Christ I want
[1:12:31] the life that was in the blood that life
[1:12:33] is the Holy Ghost right
[1:12:35] that's that that's what can go into me
[1:12:37] and make me live that life that Christ
[1:12:39] lived when he was here on earth
[1:12:41] praise the Lord but the blood as far as
[1:12:44] it is went back into the elements from
[1:12:45] which it come from the food that he
[1:12:47] lived on that Jesus lived on but you see
[1:12:50] inside that blood cell was a life that
[1:12:52] started the blood cell to moving if it
[1:12:55] was the chemistry had no life in itself
[1:12:57] and therefore it could not move but when
[1:13:00] the life come into the chemistry of the
[1:13:02] blood it formed the cell it formed its
[1:13:05] own cell then cell after cell then it
[1:13:07] become a man amen and that man was God
[1:13:10] he Manuel in flesh but when that life
[1:13:14] returned back the chemistry went to it
[1:13:17] but the token is the tape no but the
[1:13:24] token is the Holy Ghost upon the church
[1:13:27] that they see Christ what are we showing
[1:13:34] the world are we showing them Christ or
[1:13:38] we shown them relics I'm not worried
[1:13:41] about relics you know what Saints
[1:13:44] there's a brother one time several years
[1:13:47] ago for a brother brother brother Joe
[1:13:51] knows him and I think he's met him and
[1:13:53] he might have come here and spoken
[1:13:55] before brother from the Amazon jungle
[1:13:56] his name is brother Isaiah Boris and
[1:14:03] brother
[1:14:05] from Venezuela Hispanic brother lives in
[1:14:08] the jungle and he came to visit in the
[1:14:12] United States around 2002 2003 and
[1:14:15] that's when I met him and he was he was
[1:14:18] amazed that the people here in the
[1:14:20] message and how they he went and visited
[1:14:23] Jeffersonville and all that that's
[1:14:26] wonderful
[1:14:26] right but he he himself came back and
[1:14:30] this is what he said a man that lives it
[1:14:32] out in the jungle here's what he said he
[1:14:35] said brother Lewis he said I'm going
[1:14:38] back home now but you know what what's
[1:14:40] what's important you make sure that you
[1:14:43] just don't live by relics in your life
[1:14:45] yeah now that's a man that lived not in
[1:14:49] America a man that lives in the middle
[1:14:51] of the jungle
[1:14:53] who's a pastor has a church down there
[1:14:55] speaking to people you know supposedly
[1:14:58] don't have any civilization he himself
[1:15:01] saying don't live by relics it was
[1:15:03] wonderful it was wonderful to go and
[1:15:05] visit the tabernacle he said oh it was
[1:15:09] great to shake brother Joseph's hand and
[1:15:11] all that stuff but he said yeah that's
[1:15:14] not really what I desired though right
[1:15:16] it's what he said yeah now so you know
[1:15:19] what this this brother has got it you
[1:15:22] know he understands it Amen people you'd
[1:15:28] be surprised and I've gone out and I've
[1:15:31] been in the mission field you'd be
[1:15:33] surprised how these people that they're
[1:15:35] getting the message and they know that
[1:15:38] it's not just in books and tapes they
[1:15:41] don't even have all of the messages that
[1:15:43] you and I have it hasn't been translated
[1:15:46] and yet they're getting the essence of
[1:15:49] the message they're preaching it young
[1:15:52] man about my age young man preaching
[1:15:55] this to their congregations I know
[1:15:57] brother right now Nicaragua in Nicaragua
[1:16:00] right now preaching this revelation
[1:16:01] exactly the message that brother Brandon
[1:16:04] brought to us amen
[1:16:05] the life of the message to the people
[1:16:07] and he'll he surprises me and it's
[1:16:12] exactly the message now you see Saints
[1:16:16] we here in America we got all of the
[1:16:19] messages we've gotten all of the relics
[1:16:21] we've got we've got everything and some
[1:16:24] of these people are outdoing us now it's
[1:16:28] not about competition that's not what's
[1:16:30] all about but they've gotten what the
[1:16:32] essence of this word is about amen are
[1:16:36] we getting the essence of the word amen
[1:16:37] praise the Lord
[1:16:39] I'm just challenging you Saints I'm
[1:16:41] challenging you that is this it's a late
[1:16:43] hour amen I know most of us we
[1:16:47] understand these things but but I'm just
[1:16:49] you know I I want the young people to
[1:16:52] understand these things as well Laurie
[1:16:53] amen they are kids amen they're our
[1:16:56] future
[1:16:57] yeah if you don't have kids you know you
[1:17:01] you you don't understand I have children
[1:17:04] there's parents here they have children
[1:17:07] grandchildren and we desire for our
[1:17:12] children to live to have not the relics
[1:17:15] or the chemistry of the love of this but
[1:17:17] the life that's the only thing that's
[1:17:20] gonna continue living on right and
[1:17:22] that's gonna influence the world amen
[1:17:26] praise God
[1:17:31] amen the net and that next quote the
[1:17:36] water blood and spirit come when a
[1:17:38] mother gives birth to the - - to the
[1:17:42] baby the first thing breaks a normal
[1:17:44] birth is a water the second thing is a
[1:17:45] blood and the next thing is life there
[1:17:48] come from the body of our Lord Jesus
[1:17:49] Christ water blood in life in the whole
[1:17:52] church the bride together has been made
[1:17:54] up through justification and
[1:17:55] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:17:57] Holy Ghost which is the token the whole
[1:18:01] process amen and the church in this day
[1:18:04] that's received the token of the baptism
[1:18:07] of the Holy Spirit I don't see anywhere
[1:18:11] where he says it's a relic or a tape as
[1:18:14] they're teaching are these children that
[1:18:18] it that's what it is that the blood has
[1:18:21] been shed and that the Holy Ghost is
[1:18:23] upon the church without us then they
[1:18:26] cannot raise without the token right the
[1:18:32] ones waiting for us cannot raise but
[1:18:38] they're depending on us for God promised
[1:18:40] he would have it and somebody is going
[1:18:43] to be there I don't know who it's going
[1:18:46] to be but somebody's going to receive it
[1:18:48] the only one thing I'm responsible is to
[1:18:51] preach it and if he wasn't this the only
[1:18:57] one to preach it amen that word if it's
[1:19:00] a live word it needs to continue moving
[1:19:02] and living amen being continually
[1:19:07] preached right through a thoughtful
[1:19:09] ministry and through your lives
[1:19:13] amen are you sisters lives as well it's
[1:19:17] God's business to look out for that
[1:19:19] predestinated seed there
[1:19:20] is going to be there though because
[1:19:22] they're going to be there each one of
[1:19:24] them one with the other the water aged
[1:19:26] the blood edge and now the token age of
[1:19:28] the Holy Ghost I just keep seeing where
[1:19:32] the token is the Holy Ghost I don't see
[1:19:35] where it's anything else so I don't know
[1:19:38] where they're getting this that the
[1:19:39] token is something else
[1:19:41] scroll keep going I think I might be the
[1:19:45] it that might be it okay all right so
[1:19:50] Saints and we'll just we'll just cut it
[1:19:53] right there but let's let's read that
[1:19:54] last last few verses there in Exodus
[1:19:56] chapter 12 I Exodus chapter 12 verse 8
[1:20:07] and they shall eat the flesh in that
[1:20:10] night roast with fire and unleavened
[1:20:13] bread in other words get leaven out of
[1:20:18] your house
[1:20:20] what is leaven worldliness
[1:20:24] movies you're not supposed to watch
[1:20:27] accounts you're not supposed to have
[1:20:32] subscriptions that you shouldn't you
[1:20:34] need to stop do you know I said just say
[1:20:40] like this brother Brandon would call it
[1:20:42] different things in his day nowadays
[1:20:43] it's different stuff thanks it's
[1:20:48] subscriptions I can name all different
[1:20:51] types of accounts yeah unleavened that's
[1:20:56] leaven in your home in other words
[1:21:00] that's extra fluff that doesn't need to
[1:21:04] be there it's taking your time away from
[1:21:07] God nothing wrong with you no I don't I
[1:21:13] don't go hunting I don't go fishing I
[1:21:16] don't do these things I'll do it if you
[1:21:18] know but it's not what I what I've
[1:21:20] desired to but some of you love that I
[1:21:23] entertain myself with other things but I
[1:21:26] cannot let those things take the place
[1:21:28] of God and if those things are taking
[1:21:31] the place of God and me being in the
[1:21:32] house of God going to church
[1:21:35] abiding in Christ and and and and in
[1:21:38] corrupting my home and there's a problem
[1:21:42] you have leaven in your house and with
[1:21:45] bitter herbs they shall eat it
[1:21:47] Amen in other words they this relax
[1:21:51] their God wanted them to remember the
[1:21:53] bitterness that they had went through
[1:21:54] there in Egypt and those bitter herbs
[1:21:57] it reminded them of the bitterness of
[1:22:00] the slavery that they had gone through
[1:22:02] Amen but at the same time you can go
[1:22:05] through a rough time and life Saints you
[1:22:07] can go through hardships all of us are
[1:22:09] not exempt from having bad things happen
[1:22:12] to us well you say all bad things don't
[1:22:14] happen to Christians no right my brother
[1:22:20] brother brother uh boy easy
[1:22:22] he's gone through a bad thing here and
[1:22:25] then in the past few weeks
[1:22:26] brother Colley you know I saw him some
[1:22:29] of us you know we've gone through some
[1:22:31] terrible things in our lives lost loved
[1:22:33] ones and things like that but Saints
[1:22:37] when you're eating the word amen when
[1:22:39] you're eating the lamb
[1:22:40] amen when you're in this word it makes
[1:22:43] helps to make things better it's an it
[1:22:45] so thankful it's so peaceful that God's
[1:22:48] made a way for us say Amen now you don't
[1:22:51] have to carry all those burdens on you
[1:22:53] amen
[1:22:53] but place him on Him who is our burden
[1:22:56] carrier a man and not an eating out of
[1:23:00] it raw nor sodden at all with water but
[1:23:02] roast with fire his head with his legs
[1:23:04] and with the pertinence tear off in
[1:23:06] other words eat everything in other
[1:23:08] words don't be picky I never supposed to
[1:23:12] eat the brain they were supposed to eat
[1:23:13] the heart they were supposed to eat
[1:23:14] every single thing every part of the
[1:23:16] lamb every part of that animal they were
[1:23:18] supposed to eat don't nitpick on this
[1:23:22] don't just take what you think it's good
[1:23:25] for you don't just oh no it's everything
[1:23:29] or nothing amen and with the pertinence
[1:23:33] thereof that's the intro is the insides
[1:23:35] and ye shall let nothing of it remain
[1:23:37] until the morning and that which
[1:23:39] remaineth of it until the morning ye
[1:23:41] shall burn with fire last verse verse 11
[1:23:44] and dust shall ye eat it with your loins
[1:23:47] Girt
[1:23:48] amen in other words ready ready to go
[1:23:52] man that's how we need to be eating this
[1:23:54] word as if the coming of the Lord is
[1:23:56] happening Amen as if we're gonna see the
[1:23:58] resurrected Saints a man at any moment
[1:24:01] amen
[1:24:02] that's how we need to be living our
[1:24:04] lives your shoes on your feet they were
[1:24:09] supposed to eat it inside their home
[1:24:10] with their shoes on right on their feet
[1:24:16] which represented I'm ready to go and
[1:24:19] your staff in your hand in other words
[1:24:22] your walking stick right you're
[1:24:26] traveling stick spiritually speaking and
[1:24:28] ye shall eat it in haste amen in other
[1:24:32] words you shall eat it quickly it eat it
[1:24:36] quickly or else it'll pass away from you
[1:24:38] amen if you you because amen
[1:24:42] as the word is going forth amen receive
[1:24:45] everything quickly amen otherwise it'll
[1:24:49] go away from you amen because the word
[1:24:52] is continually moving right the word is
[1:24:55] continuing moving it is the Lord's pass
[1:24:59] over now that's what the word pass over
[1:25:02] means is that if you applied that token
[1:25:06] in your life if those Israelites applied
[1:25:08] that token over the blue over the door
[1:25:10] then the death angel was going to pass
[1:25:12] over them right right that's what the
[1:25:17] passover means and if god sees that
[1:25:20] token displaying in your life and you
[1:25:23] you fall flat on your face you commit
[1:25:26] you commit something but you know that
[1:25:28] you're supposed to go to god and you go
[1:25:30] to God and you say Lord forgive me
[1:25:32] Here I am I can't save myself I can't
[1:25:35] forgive my own sin but here I am take me
[1:25:38] and he'll pass over you he'll pass over
[1:25:42] your sin nope because why
[1:25:44] that tokens on display you're dependent
[1:25:46] on that on that not on your own merits
[1:25:48] you're dependent on him hey Mary
[1:25:51] praise the Lord Jesus so young people
[1:25:53] Saints adults kids amen it's time let's
[1:25:58] take God seriously in our lives

[1:26:37] token but abiding in that token and let
