appreciate Zach's testimony there of of the the copperhead being close so you know he is an everpresent help in a time of trouble so that's the way we want it to be amen you like turn in your scriptures turn where we've been reading from on Hebrews 81 and then we will go to Ecclesiastes 12 Hebrews 8 pleas the AES remember to pray to remember the brother will be coming brother uh Matthew will be coming this weekend I mean this Wednesday to preach for us and uh brother Watkin son so remember him and his coming back him up with your prayers and and everything dear Lord Jesus we thank you for an opportunity this afternoon to be able to come together and to sit down for a little while and just Fellowship around the word we pray that you would just come and honor your word and Lord we know you have so much of the testimonies knowing Lord that you are with us and we thank you and we pray that you would just have your way now come and speak to us about your word and let our hearts be anchored in you and let everything be right we love you as we read your words you come and speak to us and Lord just have your way with each one forgive our sins and lead us in Jesus name amen Hebrews 8 Brother Gary Atkins gave a testimony there a while ago about how that the his lag in his foot was doing a whole lot better so we thank God because the Lord he's with us to take care of everything and all if we we believe it so we thank him Hebrews 8:1 now the things which we we have spoken this is the son we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty in the heavens all right remember that's Paul summing up after what he has said for seven chapters and he said now this is the sum we have such an high priest then Ecclesiastes 12 and: 13 when he's winding up what he's having to say about the Lord and the things he says let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter what is the conclusion of the whole matter now what to do fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been using a a lot of things to speak on and you know about the seven compound names of Jehovah and I pray that you would you know keep reading on these and and do your own study on them because that would be you know that's that's our desire is to get you encouraged to where that you will will uh you know uh study yourself and and search out these things and just take the the names and the things that we've been using and and we know that the in the Old Testament it was used as Jehovah being the uh Redemptive name of God because in Genesis 2 you'll find it says and the Lord God which is Jehovah Elohim so then they use that and come on through because Jehova means like a father with his family all right and that's the way that you know like in the Bible that that God was revealing himself and as I've said about these that we've used about the seven compound names of Jehovah that what it's doing is God revealing himself to individual persons you know and showing himself manifesting himself through those people all right now because that's the way God does it the way he he does things he uses people to do it and then he'll when he's using people to do it then he speaks to them of what he's wanting them to see him to be or to to understand him for the time so that way he doesn't speak to to everybody the same cuz he's personal to you and that's where you should believe it you should believe that he's trying his best to talk to you because you know that's God's way of doing things he speaks to mankind uh and and I I thank God for that but see then the seven compound names of Jehovah we gave you the paperwork and the things to look up on like Jehovah Gyra the Lord's provided sacrifice and then Jehova RFI the Lord is our healer well see then we went through you know like this morning Jehovah tishu which is the Lord our righteousness we see each one is showing things to the man that he was speaking about you know or the people or the situation and and that order that order to put it to our understanding or with the way that we look at it that he's revealing himself to us as all of these and it is in Jesus Christ amen because the if you believe in one true and living God then you'd have to believe that that great Jehovah that come down through the Old Testament dealing with the children of Israel and then one day came into human flesh and and you know his name is Jesus and if you run that name Jesus one of these days we will uh maybe when we finish up with this but you can take the name of Jesus and you just keep running it backward and you'll see that there was times that he appeared not as the person you know Jesus down through but the things that was made known to mankind was bringing that name into being and it goes all the way back uh to Jehovah savior so that's what we're trying to to bring forth all right now what has been our point about the seven compound names it's it's just to me it's like uh now to one person looking at it one thing May mean more than others as I said down through time as he was revealing himself but for doing it overall it turned out to be now I'm a father okay now my wife doesn't look at me as father because I'm not that I am her husband my mother wouldn't look at me as a husband she looked at me as her son right all right now I've got many titles like the head of grandfather great grandfather and all like that but who am I and what am I just one person that's but I manifested in many different ways to show myself see those are my attributes now God had in him attributes that he wanted to reveal himself he wanted to be a Healer right well there was nobody back there sick but when man was allowed to be placed in the garden and the fall came then we know immediately that we needed a savior we needed a Healer we needed a deliverer we needed all of the things that would be related to his name and those were his attributes being displayed just like my attributes it's taken me 70 years see to display the attributes that I have displayed but through that I have wound up having many many many attributes to that but it's the same person all right we're talking this morning I said the the key to understanding if we would even talk about Jehovah Gyra Jehovah Raa Jehovah tiu and and all like that would be to realized that it would all be connected back to Calvary all right because Calvary is were that God became Our Savior youd say well I was saved brother Dale before the world but if you don't come to it in this world then there's something wrong because what he saw is what we are here right all right so then that's what we need to deal with you know and see if you don't receive eternal life you don't have eternal life that's just as just as much as as anything we could talk about but now looking at it and seeing Jesus Christ as almighty God seeing that person that was made manifest among us to be as the scripture called him Emmanuel God With Us but in him was all of that Redemptive product because he was the one that paid the price right he was the one that died for us he was the one that raised he was the one that has come back to live in us on a lot see then he has to be the almighty God or else we're picking up more personalities identities and persons and we're going right back to the trinitarian concept you know that we used to have of Father Son and Holy Ghost Blessed Trinity but we don't believe that we believe in God having many manifestations but be the same God now in coming forth like that then we can look at these things that has been revealed to mankind and then see what he means to you and me now as Wade talked about Abraham one day I remember uh him bringing the message part and talking about Abraham and what God done for Abraham well that's wonderful but you know that won't do you a bit of good if you don't believe it if God doesn't speak to you what he done for Abraham won't do a bit of good we can say we believe God spoke to Moses we believe God spoke to all these people that's all well and good but but if he don't speak to you and me where are we well then we come up see with the concept that well God don't speak to people anymore now you show me that in the Bible I don't you know I'm just blunt tell me that in the Bible I want to see where it says that he don't speak no more because I can go through the Bible and find out that he's still speaking and even get into the Book of Revelations and find out he'll be speaking out we get out of here amen so then we shouldn't be we shouldn't let that ENT our mind all right but now as I say about this morning and been saying it over and over there are seven compound names of of Jehovah and they all apply to Jesus Christ but if we make one of them a large portion and the other one a smaller portion and up and down what have we done he would not be the same yesterday today and forever right now irregardless of what how many manifestations I have had in my life none of those can be any greater now so you could say well now now brother Dale your wife you're her husband that's that's all right that way but still that don't change me right I'm the same person I've just got many manifestations but now those manifestations are of the same equal value if we look at it correctly we seen that he is Jehovah Gyra which is what the Lord's provided sacrifice all right being Jehovah Gyra to take our place then he made a way to come and enter into us right by the new birth see all right that brings Jehovah gy into you because he becomes your savior all right then that would bring at the same basis that would bring Jehovah rapi which means the Lord that Health all of thy diseases he comes inside of us all right are you following me see I'm I'm holding that to that one person not a one that's concept now but to one person right with many many manifestations so then we covered in this morning that he is our our righteousness Jehovah tiing you he is our righteousness we see that is not a self-righteousness and it's not something we can do because the Bible said our righteousness is his filthy rags okay but it's what he's come inside of us to do in us now I'm trying to get the point to all of us okay me you all of us that these things that we're speaking of are in You by the New Birth the new birth brings him as Jehovah Gyra the Savior Jehovah rea the Healer put's the Healer inside of you we don't have to pray healing down from heaven I I'm I'm sorry I just blunt I got a little note my brother said to that he like to kind of the harshness way I spoke on the computer today and and all but I don't I'm not harsh I'm not mean I just say what I believe and and and that way you don't have to nobody don't have to wor what I believe there's a lot of people that I don't know what to believe and some of you I don't know what you believe you know why cuz you never told me well I can't look at you and read what you are you know I mean but you've never told me and some people kind of hide what they believe you preachers do that especially you watch them they get to playing around preaching and after a while you watch them they'll start turning to one side and they'll start turn and the people over here will be amening and they'll be locked in you know and the rest of them's gone they just right our cuz this group has found out what they're doing well a lot of people planted a lot of rotten seed by being deceptive but you can't accuse me of that now I've been here 40 years preaching and you can't accuse me of trying to trying to be deceiving I just tell you like it is right whether you like it or lump it that's just what I am that's why I say I believe in one true and living God I'm not a Oneness I'm not a trinitarian I believe in this correct scriptural understanding of one God well here this make you know it all well okay no I'm not a know it all but I know one that knows all now that is being that then he send some of it to me if that makes me that you just do what you want to with it but now listen having all of these things inside of you that's my point now all of these compound names will deal from the inside of you by the new birth right all right so now you're manifesting from the New Birth what you believe God to be I believe him to be all of these seven comound names that's what I'm trying to show you amen I believe he's my savior I believe he's my healer I believe he's my righteousness cuz I don't have any but if he says I'm righteous why can't I why can I not say what he says amen and let me confess it and just walk into it cuz you can't separate it all right they must all apply to Jesus Christ and cannot be valued one above the other right making all the same value the value that God is and see that'll keep us on the right level all right now I've been through that so many times I'm hoping that you'll you'll uh you know be with me on it but I want to pick up now and maybe try to get a couple of these today if we can so if you will turn with me to uh judges 6 let's pick up and here's a key that I'm trying to get you to see okay you remember what I always say now if I say this is the key what are you supposed to do write it down write it down make a note he's fixing to say something that's going to be valuable well you see I believe that God is revealing to you and I who we are and what we're doing here and to see them then see him as our savior then see him as our healer and see him as our righteousness we can see that everything is in him but then he imparts that to you then Paul said what that it's Christ in you the hope of glory now so we want everything inside of us and each one will uh how would you call it unfold itself into a a deeper understanding is what I'm trying to do you know so if we can see that he's our savior he's our healer he's our righteousness will surely that order bring the next one that we're talking about which is Jehovah Shalom the Lord our peace and when you realize who you are you can have peace have you ever had this something going wrong you know some problem and all at once you realize that there are things taken care of you know it just brings a peace doesn't it and that peace passes all understanding I told you about the time I had that 30 off 6 to go off the barrel about that close to my head stand up against a tree and I literally couldn't Fe like had no feeling and a very very little hearing because about that time I heard an airplane go over and and I can hear him going you know and I had bark in my forehead and little pieces of lead but you know do most people that would have just went Highwire they said well what did you do I went on done what I stood I couldn't hear of course I HED around because I couldn't feel nothing I HED around and tried to see if all the parts was there you know I realized if it blowed off something my hand would go down in it and blood be everywhere I had enough common sense so when I began to rub all over and realized that everything was still in place and little bit of blood coming off my head I just climbed up tree and went home honey that day is quite a while for be here will you see well me I had jump down and run to the doctor what's he going to do I could figure out I was all still together for a minute I wondered if I was over there start with but because you know I didn't know where I done but went over what had happened because I was so numb but if you ever had something like that to happen and all at once then you just calm it's just you know just everything's at peace you'd like for it to be that way all the time would you I would I've been in situations where that when things would come out of it it would be so wonderful a piece all right that's what I'm trying to talk about because see he is our peace but now remember where this peace is at we're trying to find peace right is not that the whole world you know the government wants peace this wants peace that government wants peace that country we see through the Christian the peace is within that's where our trouble is we try to think if we can get to a certain place that we can find peace you know if we can go here we can go there we can find it but it's an inner peace right amen it's an inner piece not an outward one you know when I had the piece there when the gun went off you know it didn't stop all the world from just falling theart you know it went right own it didn't change nothing but me that's right that's right now you think about it so right let's go over here and judges now if you know the story I'll just give you the background before we read and then you'll have it the children of Israel had got into a position here where that the enemy would just come in and just even though they would raise their food and try to get everything ready the enemy would just come in and take it away from them because they were so vast and so you know strong until the children of Israel didn't have anybody to Rally up and and to try to fight against them and if it come to a to a situation and Gideon you've heard the story of him many times over and over and over he he was Thresh and wheat but what he was doing he was going to go hide it cuz what else you going to do when you know the enemy is coming I mean you know the enemy got enough sense to know weak time you know so they were trying to gather it maybe a little early you know get everything to going and they were going to he was going to go hide it well something happened amen it wasn't because of how how good Gideon was it had nothing to do with him and yet God comes on the scene and he says you know through the angel of the Lord and he says Gideon the great man of Valor you know a warrior courageous now that wouldn't have looked like it if we standing there watch in him right I mean a movie made of that what would it look like it looked like a bunch of stinking rotten scared cowards right because he's worried he was trying to save a little food for his family and he's scared to death but when God looked down he said great man of Valor because Gideon didn't have that within himself that's what I've tried to go over and over now the peace that comes is the inner peace the Healer the Savior our righteousness everything is within us revealed unto us of God to be able to let us not look what he says then when it gets down to verse 22 and when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the Lord Gideon said alas oh Lord God for because I have seen an angel of the Lord face to face and the Lord said unto him peace be unto thee fear not Thou shalt not die now would that be something are you laying on a deathbed the doctors done pronounced you that the basis that there's no hopes and yet God says peace Brother Dy back there years ago he went fishing him and I think was him and his brother was down on a lake fishing and he had worn his uh boots and things that where he had uh was doing concrete work you know rubber boots up to your knee and another and something happens he falls out of the boat into the lake well see he could probably got out all right but yet is that water was beginning to fill up in his clothes and down into his boots they just wouldn't no way and yet he fell into the water and somewh he just was sticking his hands up he got deep enough into the water it was way over him you know and things his brother I best I remember the story now the boat F nearly over or something and pushed back towards the bank he can tell you the whole story well his brother had to get to the boat and get back over to where he was we see you know 30 seconds is bad enough if you're down in water but they don't know exactly really how long that it took but his brother gets back over to where he's at and he's trying to find him in the water and he is he I think brother darted it right you had the fishing pole right had a fishing pole in his hand so he was that deep down in the water the fishing pole wasn't up above the water it was that he was that deep down and he was Raising it up well how long it took we know that it took 2 or 3 minutes 5 minutes or maybe whatever but he was holding that fishing Bowl up and his brother got to the place where he realized where about where there was and he began to do in the water with his hand or something something happened I can't remember the whole story there but he caught the into that Rod well you know what Brother D was a hold the end of the rod and he just pulled him up out of the water we get to call that brother dy's been in the you know we jump in the car and drive down get down in the hospital and he's sitting under the bed talking to everybody you I mean if he's in that water one minute that's enough right but they don't realize you know don't know exactly how long but brother Dy said to best could remember me telling him telling me that he just stuck his hands up with that Rod well he wasn't fighting and struggling that was all over cuz he knew it was done but see he just settle down and his brother just pulled him out of the water see that's the time you want peace then that's the time you want somebody on your side amen cuz you ain't got time to pray that's right you just want somebody on your side right then but you see fear not Thou shalt not die what about having a peace when everything going wrong right but God's word says you shall not die now I'd rather have God's word than everybody in the country and all the right I'd rather have God's word but look what he says then in verse 24 and God's told him about his peace now fear not that shal not die then Gideon buil an altar unto the Lord and called it Jehovah Shalom unto this day it is yet in the ofer of the abits now Jehovah shalom means what the Lord our peace it look like it would be uh as I said he came to him under the point of what each one was to reveal uh look like it would have been Je hovah some kind of a great warrior or something no now he's facing and you go on and read you know and he kills a whole bunch of people of the enemy that comes after him and you know what he he makes it a good a job until they quit trying to come down and right the stuff you know you see God took over but God wanted him to have peace in other words for reason it said there you know Thou shalt not die because he was you know if he was going to fight somebody going to get hurt and back then they didn't play games like they do now they in other words they just sliit the man's throat and as it cuz that took care of your enemy you know and he said Peace be unto thee right in the midst of all of the TR trouble he's fixing to start fighting and God says peace okay peace ever spoke to you like that ever I said if you ever had something really bad going wrong and all at once you just realize that something else was there and everything was in in control peace now a man that's going to kill a bunch of people a man has got to fight a battle run off an enemy and God says peace well now brother D what that would mean was Gideon was going to was told peace so he goes over and sets down under a shade tree now that's not according to way I read it I think he got what was Ox go like a big old progen stick and he just started frailing the daylight out of everybody come along well you know when they got through I don't how many of them was there but he turned around and said okay boys and the rest of you w't need come on and he was fighting people with swords and Spears and Shields and when something can't you just see it I mean he's got a great big old we had a great big old something to hold up stick or something and he's got a stick and he's just going peace peace wonderful peace you know coming down from the father above wouldn't it be something to been his wife sit nowh looking at him said he's gone crazy it's a bat he's got a stick after the Army and he's Hing peace peace but you know that what take that was what was taking place so he buil an altar unto the Lord and he said Lord you brought me peace you brought me peace what about Ephesians 2:4 says he is our peace so always in the Bible it was kind of be a a point because if you'll notice when an angel of the Lord would come to someone or somebody speaking something or Jesus a lot of the accounts especially after the resurrection I was looking a bunch of them and after his resurrection you know he would come into appear among the people and naturally they were afraid you know one time it even listened they thought it was a spirit you know and what did he say peace peace be unto you I think that's the way really this terminology is when they say shalom and you're in Israel and you say shalom and they say shalom shalom I believe that's the correct way one I was told that anyway God it means peace but see then when you say to someone peace Shalom see then they speak back to you shalom shalom which means God's peace be unto you peace Jesus said said in John 14:27 my peace I give you you want to be worried well be all flustrated and everything you people that the brothers and all that was in the service what do they teach you that gets you to be calm not cuz you go off the head you lost the battle I don't care what you got you lose your head you lost the battle so stay calm trust what you've been taught to do you've been trying to handle these situations so now relax go at it just like it's training what peace we look around and we see the world today and the the economy and everything Georgia now over 10% unemployment things are tightening down let see God says peace amen what do you mean everything's going wrong peace just be calm God said he'd take care of us we'll get to that in a second he said he he promised it so just be at peace well Brother D you mean you don't get scared and excited you I'm a human being and all of us do but then in times when things that you realize and then you recognize God's on the scene but you know the biggest problem we have is that the battle's over the things are done the problems finished and and then we we realize God's there you know right when it's all finished then we think about God being there well why shouldn't we think about God being there the whole time right just peace you know just be calm and don't worry about it but see Gideon thought so much of that until he didn't right out there here's the place that Gideon whoop the army no didn't knew he didn't whip nobody but he realized God come on the scene what about Samson taking a Jawbone of a mule and killing a thousand Philistines cuz he knew where he was at right you're not going to have peace unless you know where you're at right right you remember the man that brother R tells about that that the little baby was dying and the blood pressure had already dropped so low that it had never been that low before and anybody come back and and the nurse was they was in there and brother around and prayed and and the man looked over at his wife and said honey look at it said the Lord has healed a baby the nurse said sir said you don't understand nobody's ever went that low and it come back up and they lived he said honey you looking at your machines and that's good but said I just went in the other room and I prayed through said I'm here now with peace in my heart that the baby's going to live read the story and listen for 3 days it got worse worse than what it was but you know what the child Liv cu the man said I prayed through and I got peace when the world's fighting you everything the turmoil as I said about all the things that are going on around the world no you know I depend upon the scriptures that God has spoken and he said he never leave you nor forsake you said my peace I give unto you and said in a time of trouble don't worry about it because I'll be there my peace will be there never seen a righteous forsaken they re seat begging bread right you think I know how we old human mind think you think you're going to get up in the morning and you're going to go to work and you're going to make a day's work and you going to pay your way and you don't need nothing El well the way the economy is right now you could get a notice while you're sitting in your seat on your uh what you call those little things you send the messages by they says you're fired right you can go home and find on the answering machine you are unemployed true see nothing here is continual but even more you're sitting there breathing and God is giving you a breath to breathe amen and one more might be all you get EXA but what happens when things go wrong and it shows the in and I said come on folks I'm a human being but when God is on the scene I don't worry about nothing I've had lightning to strike close to me scare me to slap to death I've been out the wind blowing the trees start moving you know human but but I stood one day and looked and I stood on my front porch which is not there now we've been closed it and those trees were not quite as big as they are now but they were still oak trees of you know 24 in I stood have seen them bend over the wind blowing so strong now big old tree bending over ain't talking about a little old sapling now 24 in diameter tree and bend over and the limbs are almost touching the ground and stand there and say peace be still not be no more afid name H now but see it's when he comes on the scene but just remember he never leaves the scene if it's an inward piece then let the inward one take care of it well what happen something goes wrong everybody run it to the doctor s got a heart attack I standing up on a deer stand one day down in the woods about 15 18 ft up and about that time my left arm just be to ache and all down through in the side my chest and all begin to just pain like everything hey folks first thought heart attack devil says I got you now yeah you in the woods and ain't going to find you for days you know what I do I I've got enough sense to realize one thing if I was having a heart attack now watch where to be sensible about everything I realized at first if I having a heart attack that for me to be able to hug that tree and belly hug the old days was standing up this one piece stand that that was the worst thing in the world for me to do the best thing for me to do was tie myself to that seat and start hollering help and let somebody come and get me down off of there because I would use my energy to be able to get out I had enough sense to realize that that's when the devil he said yeah they won't find you for days I just laughed I said you know Lord if I'm going right here on this tree I'll be about 15 15 something like 15 18 ft up I said I I'll be that much closer to Heaven than it would be if I was on the ground so I'm going to just sit down here while hunt you know after a while the pain just went away well did you go have your heart check no now if it done it again I would because I realized somebody else had to be there if you ever had that kind of Peace ever just had it in mind and just realize what if it is the end of the world you know the only fear I have of dying is is realizing and hoping that some way my family would be able to survive that's the only fear I have of it CU why I mean one heartbeat I'm in the hand of the Lord amen but you see folks I'm just trying to get you to see Jehovah Shalom the Lord is our peace and it's an inward peace an outward peace then is what know it's like the military would try to explain to you how that you can fight this battle and and you got enough power to win but you're still scared but then when there's a peace comes you kind of like that story brother around told about the soldier that you know that was in a place and every time they send somebody up to put up a flag we'll get to that in a minute on the banner every time they send somebody up theyd shoot them down they wanted somebody to get a flag up you remember the story The Boy he said sir if you wait about 2 or 3:00 and what time it was this evening said I'll go put that flag up time came he went up the pole put the flag up bullets flying everywhere they come back down the officer asked him said why did you want to wait this time he said because my mother prays for me every day at this time of the day and said I know nothing couldn't happen cuz Mom was praying see that's a peace he is our peace Jesus said my peace I give him why be afraid now you're show you how everything ties together L if we say then that God is our savior he is our sacrifice and that we are just as righteous as he is by accepting him as our savior then we'll have peace in our soul no matter what's taking place no matter what's taking place what can bring peace to you anymore more than God's revealed word that doctor said I'll take your kneecap off I said he ain't going to do it he said they wore out I said I said you're not going to take my kneecaps off he just I laugh he life we left the office I still got my kneecap oh yeah that's been about 30 years ago and the devil's real good you know what I'll get to doing a whole lot in my knar Hur and said see there that doctor's right they're going to take your knck out off but see 30 years later I mean come on but you see what about the peace now we can spend a lot of time on it do you know that Joshua one time made a peace offering you everever want to make a peace offering you don't hear much about that do you you hear about the offering for sicknesses the offering for this the offering for finances the offer what about peace offering have you ever really ever thank God for what you have or do you thank that you have got it yourself have you ever made a peace offering back to him we not old test we're not supposed to make offerings well I'm glad you thought of that but we're in the New Testament when all the offerings are inside and and everything but do you ever just inside of you do you ever think God for peace you ever lay down at night and just say thank you Lord thank you for the peace that you've given me thank you for my life the money you've given me my job my home my things everything now kids you think just make sure daddy stays okay where I can get it but what about our doing okay what about the peace that passes all understanding okay let's try to get this other one while we at it cuz we can use it right in the same line so where you there let's just go on over to Exodus 17 I'm trying to get these through Exodus 17:8 I won't read it but we'll just tell the story that when it come up Ambit which had come up to fought with Israel you know all right and they were having a battle and you remember the story this is where that when the battle was going that Moses had raised his hands now am will get to it if you've looked on the things I've given you am is the type of the flesh so that's where we ought to try to conquer but old amet you know he's coming in to get them and they ready pronounce the name and Moses as long as he's holding his hands up the children of Israel was winning right but when his hands would slide down the enemy start winning so you know what happened I believe what is it Joshua and Caleb that the two that was in there they reached down and took his hands and just held him up right they just held him up held up his hands you know what the children of Israel they understood and believed in Moses real strong right cuz they had seen God and using him and the things and you look up a mountain and you see him holding his hands up you say we got it but you look up after while his hands about halfway you oh Lord Moses is losing his strength but then when you look back and you see Joshua and Caleb holding his hands up you said we're going to win go God's on our side so that's the story behind it then when you get on over look at the verse 14 and the Lord said unto Moses write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua for I will utterly put out the remembrance of AMC from under Heaven that's what God told Moses I'm going to wipe them out but look what Moses do and Moses built an altar and called the name of it Jehovah nasar for he said because the Lord has sworn that the Lord will have war with emets from generation to generation in other words the Lord said I'm going to destroy Amvets amlet is the top of the flesh there will be a destruction of the flesh one day because we're going to get these bodies are going to be changed that will be the closest part that you've got in all of it whether Aon and I talking about that will even tie to the Rapture but it still doesn't show The Rapture fully because that war of the flesh is still hear all right well look Jehovah Nasha n i SS I the Lord is our Banner now that's what that means Moses said I'm going to build an altar here and I'm going to call this place the Lord is our Banner now you know what a banner is it's a sign or a signate or something you ride into a place and you look and they got this great big streamer run across our says Thanksgiving Day parades 2:00 you know whatever that's a banner it's an advertisement it's a statement and see there Joshua and Caleb was making a banner upon that Hill that's why he called it a banner Jehovah Nessa because they were holding his hands up as a sign because a banner is a sign kind of re signant of something that's taking place and they realized as long as moses' hand stayed up they were going to win and there it was a banner being displayed and Moses was told of God write this what what took place and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua for I will utterly put out the remembrance of amalik from under heaven and he says I'm going to make a banner he said this place is a banner because we won the battle a banner it's a sign a standard like a pole or a signate all right Isaiah 59 and 19 says when the enemy comes in the Lord will raise up a standard a banner raise up a standard a banner the children of Israel Had Each Nation go back and study it in numbers there and you'll find it each Nation had a banner of their own Dan Ephraim Manas etc etc and they would have a banner of the or a signate or a sign that you could tell well that's the army or the people of Dan that's the people of Manasseh you know that's the people they had their own signant or in other words a code a sign and like I told you before about it when it was over in Israel and I get seeing all of these people you know they wear that little hat on the back of their head well that's what that is that's a banner of signat and and I got looking around and I'd see blue ones and I'd see green ones and I'd see black ones and I mean I don't really remember how many colors it was they're just you you know I'm interested I thought why all the different color I thought there all Jews you know Israelites and I said brother George Smith there you know I said brother George why did all these different color that little he called a name of that little hat you know and he said that shows you know what what part they are or what group they are other words you look at it you see that group you see that color that shows that we had just got baptized in the River Jordan there my wife and I and Brother Dean and his wife we just got baptized and I was kiding brother George I said where do we get us a hat he said what do you mean I said what color hat we going to wear he said what in the world are you talking about I said well I don't know what other he was you know iy asked me the other day he said that brother that was here the other week in service said are you a Jew I said yes sir he saw my little T you know tie T I'm a Jew at heart not an outward Jew know but you see each tribe had a standard or a banner all right amen but then when they got ready to move and and in their travel there was 12 tribes and then when they would do it four would be here I mean 3 6 9 12 well then numbers call them a banner or a signant or a standard you know what this listed at a lion ox man and an eagle when they move those three move that was a line and the line would always go first then the O then the man and the eagle that was their Banner you followed what you're supposed to be you got impatient because they were in order to move him every time they were in order to Camping then you decide well bless God I'll camp where I want to no no you're you're sitting your baners over there well I don't care I'll do what I want to do is that kind of oh a little bit of a human nature you know you know how the best way for me to get stuff done is to tell you I don't want it done you go do it so I have to learn to use reverse psychology cuz see we're all stubborn in that I'll camp where I want to camp and I get ready to leave I'll leave that wouldn't so with Israel every man stayed in his Camp every man stayed under that Banner until they were told to move see that Lon ox man and the eagle come all the way through the the Bible right on out into what Matthew Mark Luke and John Matthew is a liive mark o John is the eagle Luke The Physician man and John is the evil you got to hold it all the way through because that's where it comes up in the Book of Revelation and God sees the Banner but you see we're not trying to worry about being the banner of the of the line the ox of the man and our day is the eagle Banner but you know what in the eagle Banner you would have all the banners enged all together in one now we do have a line the ox of man and Eagle I believe that is here now as a banner a sign we've had great things to happen when God when the enemy comes in don't worry about it what are you what are you depending on brother Dale when all the the things get worse and worse I'm depending on God I've tried my best to be sensible with you cuz I try to be sensible I've tried my best as a Pastor to explain things to you don't gohe over Hills in debt today you're going to lose your home run around and said keep your homes and take the mark of the beast so don't go out and go head over heels it'd be a good wise thing today to put up a little food to put up a little things to be able to be able to live you know that most of you probably sitting right here today you couldn't live it wouldn't for the grocery store that's right you got to go to grocery store before you can have a meal next I mean few days now I don't believe in storing up and doing all kind of things like that I think everybody in America order to put a little food aside you know something where you get you to a few days did you see laying up a banner a sign or a signal holding it let me go on get rid of it God's going to raise up a standard but now like I said this morning if we take the righteousness of God I should have should preach a whole sermon on that but I didn't I just mentioned it if you take the righteousness of God and pervert that righteousness God does not have to hear your prayers I can prove that in the Bible I got to laying on at the desk at home if we turn his righteousness into unrighteousness he does not have to hear us right amen but when the people of God that are believing the word and doing the best we can call upon God he's obligated to hear your prayer right all right now which one will it be he's obligated so he's not obligated to raise up a standard for everybody right it doesn't say when the enemy comes in like a flood that he'll raise up a standard for everybody the children of Israel in Goan had light but the people outside of Goan in Egypt was in total darkness it could be felt it was so dark now why don't you think sensible you know I know I'm carnal but you know what I do if I was an Egyptian and it got dark here and I could see a light over there I'm going to be over where that light's at I'm about sense I might not be able to get in where they're at but I'm certainly going to get close enough that I can get a little bit of raise of the light and see what's going on but it's not mentioned in the Bible that all the Egyptian went to Goan no they still had too much pride that's that ECT that's the flesh we still got too much pride within ourselves in the emage you know I used to read in the Bible go back and read you'll find it I forgot which of the name of it was but maybe I'll hit it in a minute but you know God amorites God would tell the children of Israel destroy ever Amorite men women children babies kill them they go do it two chapters later they're fighting the Amor and I thought what's going on here even if that calculated 100 years or so back between the two incidents I still wouldn't have enough time to get the people back you understand and then one day it realized I realized but I read where the amorites represented he's a flesh man go am I right did it come from um the man in his daughter come into the amorites that's right is that right Mo boites Amor when I come to find out it represent the flesh then I realize what's going on have you ever got to the place you thought you doing this good you just doing so good everything's running good you're singing you're worshiping peace PE see you do not and all it run druck bottom right you know what just happened the old Amorite rose up the amachi rose up the flesh CU that's the guy we got to keep kill him we normally kill him if we realize who is doing the fight who's going to raise up a standard God said he would let me get the end of it quick you want to read it Songs of Solomon second chapter verse 4 he tells you what his Banner is this is a banner I really want songs of Solomon if you got your marker on Ecclesiastes cuz you've been read that long enough just write There song to Solomon's next chapter 2 and verse 4 said he brought me to the banquet B excuse me house and His Banner Over Me With Love and the songs of Solomon is the little woman speaking there is the is a type of the bride of Christ and Solomon is a type of Jesus Christ all right says his Banner Over Me Is Love as I said when I started out Joshua and Caleb realized that Moses couldn't hold his hand up the banner was falling the banner was falling the enemy was defeating them so they R they just got his hands and pulled him up and they held him up till the sun went down and they've had a victory over their enemy because then Moses wrote this is the banner of the Lord Jehovah nessi the Lord our Banner do you understand what the banner was there stood three men that was the banner you remember one time when a mount called Transfiguration there was three also that were seen it was Moses and Elijah and Jesus see there's our Banner and the little bride of Christ during the songs of Solomon she says I want his Banner put over me his love there's nothing greater than love amen love the Bible says covers a multitude of sin a banner a standard a signant it's over us and that's called his love you know if you love me I don't have to worry about anything that's why I Don't Preach like most preachers preach and do all kind of things and I've told you just plain language see cuz see I ain't never worried about starving to death as long as I'm preaching to a bunch of Born Again people cuz you know what we may not all of us have very much but we will have something go if you love me you ain't going to let me starve to death I know that's natural but it's true right you know why because love is there right see that's just natural what about his Banner of love you're looking behind me you're seeing the stature of a perfect man start off Faith virtue knowledge temp fa God this brotherly kindness and then what the love of God the love of God in his bride to show His Banner brother Rand said how in the world I said to him said brother random how can you put up with those people he said I'm trying to have patience knowing that they don't have and understand this word knowing that they don't know this that and the other I'm trying to have patience with him you know what he had in his heart the love of God yes so where is our peace and where is our Banner it's not an outward sign we must make that un outward show in our religious realm we do not try to prop up but we must make our L and things in an outward show right you love kids they know you whether you love them or not right they know it none of these kids right here I could have any of them get up right now and tell they'd say brother they loves us not because I've been so generous to do and help and that but that's just part of it but they know that I love them see love covers a multitude of sin see then why can't you see things that go wrong because I love you don't you know this is happening and that's happening in the church yes I got eyes I see tapes F I see things taking place inside the church but Al they don't wait outside I see things going on you think I don't know you know what I love you won't you fight me some of the T but you see I love you there's any Banner or any signant any sign I want is for it to be said of brother Dale he loves you why would you put up with this that cuz I love you the little Song of Solomon she said I want his Banner of love over me I want the love of God to be shed abroad through my heart that I can see Christ and not see you in your problems I want to see Christ live I want to see a banner raised a banner of love and understanding Jehovah n SS I there's a different spelling of a lot of those words but they're still there okay we've got one more left and we'll tie that up when we get through we have brother preaching Wednesday but we got one more left I gave it to you and I hope you'll keep it and do it and that's Jehovah Ray r a a h and that is the Lord is Our Shepherd so we'll take the 23rd psalm to preach from so you already have it I gave it to you if you don't have it let me know we'll make some more copies he is our Shepherd in the 23rd psalm there all seven compound compound names of Jehovah listed in six verses really five but have you looked at them and read them you see our B our peace and remember what I said all of these are inward but God wants them to be made outward he wants some displayed come on Brothers musicians come on let's stand together we get a couple in today maybe we can get through that the next time we preaching so we just pray one for the other the Lord would bless and keep us all in in him and let him be our peace and be our banner and just have a wonderful time in doing it amen okay what we got for 596 in the
