[0:00] for me because I've never tried this
[0:01] song outside of the shower in my patrol
[0:04] cars usually
[0:06] um but I did want to say one real quick
[0:08] thing that I've been going through a lot
[0:10] of trouble here lately both emotionally
[0:12] physically and everything like that
[0:15] and I knew that today was coming up that
[0:17] I had to sing and I had no idea I had
[0:20] bouncing other songs around in my mind
[0:21] had one and I'm saying well Paul and
[0:23] Nate but
[0:24] I was ironing my clothes this morning
[0:27] thinking I said Lord I have no idea what
[0:29] I'm going to sing
[0:30] and uh one of my favorite groups has
[0:32] always been the kingsman
[0:34] and there's one song that I've always
[0:37] loved more than anything else it's The
[0:39] Old Ship of Zion and I know that you
[0:42] should this song sounds better if you
[0:44] have a quartet singing it but I'm going
[0:47] to do my best and of course the
[0:50] musicians can just stand down because
[0:52] they're never going to be able to hang
[0:53] with me on this song because I'm going
[0:57] to go up down every which way okay I
[0:59] sing it as my heart sees it and the way
[1:02] I the way I've always seen this if any
[1:05] of y'all know the song and I hope all of
[1:06] you do I've always seen myself as that
[1:09] ship as being beaten battered and as
[1:13] Jesus my Savior as being the captain
[1:16] all right just bear with me
[1:20] I'm trying to hear the kingsman singing
[1:23] at my head behind me
[1:25] I will stand excuse me
[1:32] Lord help me
[1:34] I was standing on the banks of the river
[1:43] looking out
[1:45] over life's troubled sea
[1:53] when I saw an old shoe that was saved
[2:03] is that the old
[2:07] ship of Zion I
[2:12] I see
[2:16] it all was beat
[2:21] and bad better
[2:26] from the
[2:29] storms
[2:30] of life
[2:32] I could see
[2:37] the waves were rough
[2:40] but that old ship was steady
[2:48] is that The
[2:51] Old
[2:52] Ship of Zion
[2:56] I see
[3:01] at the stern
[3:04] of the ship was the captain

[3:17] as he called out
[3:21] my name

[11:59] express this morning
[12:02] that you will keep your word
[12:06] Lord if we could just be as honest in
[12:08] ourselves and try to keep our word
[12:11] then we don't have to worry
[12:13] because you promised it
[12:15] and then promising it then you made a
[12:18] vow unto us
[12:21] Lord may we see that this afternoon that
[12:24] you may devour we accepted deviled and
[12:27] everything will be made right
[12:31] it'll be a wonderful hour to live and to
[12:34] understand and see that he that the sun
[12:37] is set free is free indeed
[12:40] so you shall know the truth
[12:42] and the truth will set you free
[12:44] we love you father and we thank you just
[12:47] have your way now as we read your word
[12:49] in Jesus name
[12:51] Matthew
[12:53] 19.
[12:58] the Pharisees also came unto him
[13:00] tempting him and saying unto him
[13:02] is it lawful for a man to put away his
[13:04] wife forever cause
[13:06] and he answered and said unto them have
[13:08] you not read that he which made them at
[13:10] the beginning made them male and female
[13:12] and said for this call shall a man leave
[13:15] father and mother
[13:17] and shall cleave to his wife and they
[13:19] twain shall be one flesh or for there
[13:22] are no more twine but one flesh what
[13:24] therefore God hath joined together let
[13:26] not man put asunder they say unto him
[13:29] why did Moses then command a giving
[13:31] writing a divorcement and to put her
[13:33] away he saith unto thee them Moses
[13:36] because of the hardness of your heart
[13:37] suffering you to put away your wives but
[13:40] from the beginning it was not so
[13:43] and I say unto you whosoever shall put
[13:45] away his wife except it be for
[13:47] fornication and shall marry another
[13:49] commit us adultery and whoso will Merit
[13:51] her which is put away does commit
[13:54] adultery you may be seated to Lord that
[13:57] is blessing to the reading of the word
[14:00] now I want to just kind of read you a
[14:02] little bit because get a point and then
[14:05] just
[14:08] oh okay
[14:09] they said the lapel is not picking up
[14:12] I know it's on so I don't know
[14:15] and we'll try to
[14:16] hold on okay I get to walking around so
[14:20] get back get back get back
[14:21] all right
[14:23] but just think about it now
[14:27] let's review a little bit up to a place
[14:29] and then we will read the things the
[14:33] prophet had to say
[14:35] of the subject of marriage and divorce
[14:38] and you know what it is but
[14:41] to understand and make sure see if
[14:43] somebody picks up one of these tapes
[14:45] sometimes it's hard to express things
[14:48] but if they just pick up one message
[14:50] then I try to put enough on to make them
[14:53] interested enough to listen to other
[14:55] messages or announce that other messages
[14:58] were preached and that way they can go
[15:01] back and and do
[15:03] all right
[15:04] now we found that God in the beginning
[15:06] made
[15:08] man
[15:09] made the animals male and female
[15:12] you know out of the dirt
[15:14] but then he made man
[15:16] and when he made man then he didn't make
[15:19] the woman out of the dirt
[15:20] he made the woman from the man
[15:23] all right
[15:24] and in doing that it made her to be
[15:27] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone
[15:31] and made her to be him
[15:36] reproduced into another form
[15:40] because that would what else would you
[15:42] say and see then the people of the
[15:43] message will call her then a byproduct
[15:45] trying to make it a wrong thing we've
[15:48] been through those things over and over
[15:50] to try to get us an understanding see we
[15:54] are the byproduct of our mother and
[15:57] father
[15:58] and we are the byproduct of the sexual
[16:02] form that was brought into being in the
[16:05] garden
[16:06] and you know so then we need to get away
[16:09] from being too much down on something
[16:12] and get down to the truth and try to
[16:15] stay with it
[16:16] uh what if it just stayed with one male
[16:19] and one female
[16:21] well we know that God could have not had
[16:22] displayed his attributes of healer
[16:24] savior Etc all right so he didn't make
[16:28] us fall
[16:31] but he made us knowing we would
[16:34] amen he knew from the foundation of the
[16:36] world he wouldn't have stood a lamb as a
[16:37] slain before the foundation world if it
[16:39] hadn't been you know he wouldn't have
[16:41] said it that way so he knew what we
[16:43] would do but he couldn't make us do that
[16:45] I emphasized that over and over because
[16:47] he can't make us wrong and judge us for
[16:49] being wrong
[16:51] all right so he made us then with a
[16:53] choice
[16:54] in that choice then eve took the wrong
[16:56] choice
[16:57] and then when she did Adam took the
[17:00] wrong choice and went with Eve
[17:02] and that way then it brought the whole
[17:05] thing into being but it was Satan's lie
[17:09] that he got into the way he penetrated
[17:12] the mind of Eve you know and got into
[17:15] her mind her thinking
[17:18] and he got her polluted in that form
[17:21] enough to accept the Beast
[17:23] and you know that's you say well that's
[17:26] just horrible to think of that doing but
[17:29] yet he was telling her
[17:31] you know that that's what she was made
[17:32] for
[17:33] that you know he was trying to put it
[17:35] into a word in the basis of doing but
[17:39] yet just enough to make it perverted
[17:42] twist it all right now then it made
[17:46] everything be brought into a condition
[17:51] to her that everybody needed a savior
[17:55] everybody needed a a Grace
[17:59] you know and then we would see we will
[18:02] in the last days uh the the real Grace
[18:05] all right
[18:07] but being born by sex
[18:10] instead of the original creation then we
[18:13] are a byproduct of that
[18:16] and we have no rights to look down on no
[18:18] one else or what we think or what to
[18:20] doing
[18:21] we just looked right straight to God
[18:23] because it doesn't do any good I've
[18:26] never learned that it saved anybody by
[18:28] me down in somebody else right you know
[18:30] are looking to see well now I'm not as
[18:33] bad as I thought it was
[18:34] you know it's other people worse you
[18:36] know where does that help
[18:38] guilty of the leaves is that what the
[18:40] Bible said guilty of the whole all right
[18:43] no no doing see
[18:45] you know you can say well I'm not guilty
[18:47] well all right thank God
[18:51] like we were saying this morning there
[18:53] are some who who keep themselves men or
[18:55] women that kept themselves from marrying
[18:57] Kevin doing well all right that's
[18:59] honorable
[19:01] that's great there were women who kept
[19:03] themselves and men who kept themselves
[19:05] as in their virginity and that's
[19:07] wonderful we praise God we give honor to
[19:10] that
[19:12] but the biggest portion didn't
[19:15] and then that way what are you going to
[19:17] do for them
[19:19] you know can we come pull some rabbit
[19:22] hat out of it you know rabbit trick with
[19:24] something out of a hat and turn
[19:26] everything back and we do as the
[19:28] Catholics who who take a moment that's
[19:30] had you know been intercourse with a man
[19:33] and that she gets ready to get married
[19:35] and they just take her down and
[19:37] sprinkle a little salt on her turn it
[19:39] around send her back the other way and
[19:40] speak The Virginity into the woman well
[19:42] I'm just not that dumb yet I just I
[19:46] don't understand those things and
[19:48] you know
[19:49] and I don't believe it but uh
[19:52] still that's the point
[19:54] now then when Eve done what she'd done
[19:58] remember her name was not Eve
[20:02] she never got the name Eve until she
[20:04] done the wrong then she was given the
[20:06] word or the name Eve which means mother
[20:09] of all living
[20:11] the Inn that's made her then the mother
[20:14] of Cain and Abel you know and
[20:18] but to me then when they were brought
[20:20] forth into this domain both of them was
[20:22] perverted
[20:24] Cain was no more perverted than Abel
[20:28] Abel needed a savior a re he offered a
[20:31] sacrifice he done so proving what was
[20:34] there but then it brought into see that
[20:36] went pretty good A little bit maybe but
[20:39] then it brought into being the point of
[20:42] polygamy among men and you know polygamy
[20:46] among the animal race and as I said then
[20:49] it evidently had to be a spirit
[20:51] because why would the animal race fall
[20:54] into polygamy you know it had to be a
[20:57] spirit that come down to anoint just as
[21:00] satency came down to Eve and and through
[21:03] his septility he was able to deceive her
[21:06] and get her to go on into the
[21:08] furtherments of the things and and you
[21:11] know the problems all right
[21:14] but now here's one thing I want to to
[21:17] put in here then come back to it later
[21:20] all right so I'm going to basically read
[21:22] my notes down through here because it's
[21:24] the way I wanted to say it then we'll
[21:26] read what the prophet had to say
[21:29] Moses never gave a writing of
[21:31] divorcement
[21:33] to those who had many wives he didn't
[21:36] have to
[21:37] it was legal
[21:40] it became a legal way of doing it
[21:44] maybe not a right in the original but it
[21:47] became a legal way of doing it right so
[21:49] Moses when he gave the grace of marriage
[21:51] and divorce he wouldn't give him the
[21:53] grace to just because if you had more
[21:56] than one wife
[21:58] that's not even in the picture
[22:01] and see we should get it down in our
[22:04] minds to see
[22:05] the truth of what it is we're not
[22:08] practicing polygamy maybe you know today
[22:10] in the different thing but
[22:13] what was the problem was Eve having too
[22:16] many husbands
[22:17] that's not the word polygamy
[22:19] remember I gave the definitions of those
[22:22] words where it would come up to there
[22:23] you can understand but
[22:26] see Moses never gave the writer a
[22:29] divorcement to them just because they
[22:30] had many wives
[22:32] but he had to give the divorcement part
[22:34] to those who were
[22:37] caught in the wrong thing
[22:39] and remember even one we gave this
[22:42] morning where the Prophet said in the
[22:43] Old Testament that if you promised a
[22:45] girl to marry her and then you went off
[22:47] and married somebody else
[22:49] before marrying her see you were living
[22:52] in adultery and put out of the camp that
[22:54] was how serious it was back there this
[22:56] is not a play pretty thing that's just
[22:59] just for anything you know see that's
[23:01] what the Pharisees had come down to
[23:03] doing it
[23:04] and then see the people of this message
[23:06] that's the way they do you know well you
[23:08] know who are you to be telling us
[23:11] I'm not telling you don't have nothing
[23:14] to do with it
[23:15] if I say what the prophet said
[23:18] the Bible says it's not me telling you
[23:20] well that's just your opinion well if I
[23:23] tell you the Bible says it
[23:25] you know and the prophet says it then
[23:27] that's not my opinion we're gonna get
[23:29] down to something in a minute it might
[23:30] be interesting on that point
[23:33] but see they had adulterous acts back
[23:35] there
[23:36] that had to be cleansed
[23:40] you know it was not right under polygamy
[23:42] to just go out and live with just any
[23:43] woman you hadn't
[23:45] just like David with Bathsheba what
[23:47] about having 700 wives
[23:50] huh
[23:51] I think he had 700 and Solomon had a
[23:54] thousand
[23:54] well what about 700 wives and yet he
[23:57] wanted Bathsheba
[23:59] now if that don't show what adulteress
[24:01] acts are
[24:03] you know I mean that's a that's the
[24:06] point
[24:07] but around said it was that lust that
[24:09] was burning to our arm
[24:10] and he he says he was taking her bath on
[24:13] top of the house she shouldn't have been
[24:15] doing it you know because she knew
[24:17] what's going on too all right so it was
[24:20] just all the whole thing but David could
[24:22] have wished to it because he had many
[24:24] more it could went with that was taken
[24:26] by us at the same time you know you
[24:28] understand
[24:31] all right
[24:32] but Jesus said it wasn't so at the
[24:34] beginning
[24:37] and the prophet said it won't be so when
[24:39] we get over there
[24:41] all right we get over there it's not
[24:43] going to be David with a thousand
[24:46] you know Solomon with a thousand lives
[24:49] Paul said in that you're not in marriage
[24:52] or given in marriages and things because
[24:54] you see the the uh the glands will be
[24:57] gone the situations will be corrected
[24:59] that brought about all of the problems
[25:01] and things and and it won't be me
[25:03] standing there with my wife that she is
[25:06] my wife and this we will be there
[25:08] together but not in that form because
[25:12] to prove it right around him when he saw
[25:14] hope beyond the curtain of time you know
[25:16] she walked by right by him and said
[25:18] precious brother
[25:20] she didn't grab him as husband and say I
[25:22] said precious brother because when we
[25:25] get there all this is going to be gone
[25:26] there ain't going to be no situation
[25:30] now
[25:34] it was not
[25:36] male and many females that caused the
[25:39] fall
[25:41] it was not that
[25:43] see
[25:45] it was not Adam with two wives
[25:48] but it was Eve with two husbands
[25:51] his wife came up to be adultery
[25:53] now if you'll read the invisible Union
[25:55] you'll see exactly where we're going
[25:59] it's not how many wives we've had it's
[26:01] how many husbands we've had
[26:03] is the main thing yeah you say well now
[26:06] brother you're a man yeah yeah and we've
[26:09] had many husbands
[26:11] called organized religion
[26:14] the prophet what did he say he said we
[26:16] are in this situation
[26:18] of marriage and divorce because of
[26:20] misinterpreted theology
[26:24] people didn't tell us
[26:27] well we don't know it then we're not
[26:30] responsible then you are
[26:32] because you heard it yeah
[26:34] all right
[26:36] now
[26:38] and Jesus we read he didn't say that you
[26:41] could put away your wife for just any
[26:42] calls
[26:44] he made the scriptural answer there in
[26:47] Matthew 19 9 when he said it was only
[26:50] for our fornication we went through that
[26:53] to showing the fornication and adultery
[26:55] is the same word
[26:57] we found out that brother Branham said
[26:58] eve committed adultery
[27:01] all right so then that's no problem
[27:04] he we went through all of those things
[27:07] coming down to where we're at
[27:09] all right
[27:10] see then when we went through the
[27:15] thing then we see that the people made
[27:17] it because of what they wanted he said
[27:20] because of the hardness of your heart
[27:23] you know that's what Jesus said to the
[27:25] Pharisees
[27:26] all right it was in other words it was
[27:28] cause they wanted it
[27:30] they wanted a justifiable means is that
[27:32] not the human being
[27:34] that they want we want to justify
[27:37] ourselves
[27:38] and somebody say something you think
[27:40] you're perfect
[27:42] well I didn't say it was we talking
[27:44] about that but all right
[27:47] but see now we found that the man had
[27:50] grounds for marriage and divorce
[27:53] but only
[27:54] to be the scriptural grounds
[27:57] so then the man must have those grounds
[27:59] to be able to divorce his wife and
[28:01] remarry
[28:02] it's not to just he can just do any
[28:05] things he can you know he can do what no
[28:07] right but then we found that there is no
[28:09] divorce whatsoever for the woman
[28:12] because that would break your scriptures
[28:14] and things brother Ryan said he can put
[28:16] us away anytime he wants to but said how
[28:19] dire us try to put him away amen he said
[28:22] it won't work all right there's no
[28:25] grounds whatsoever for her you say well
[28:28] what is look look at the problem brother
[28:29] Dale
[28:32] I didn't
[28:35] make the problem
[28:38] they
[28:39] I'm just trying to help us with the
[28:42] problem
[28:43] all right
[28:44] now
[28:46] I hope you understand this point
[28:49] that I kept driving hard and hard
[28:52] if you read First Corinthians 7 about
[28:55] verse 30 through 40 somewhere right in
[28:57] there especially 37 you'll see what I've
[29:00] been quoting that that Paul speaks of a
[29:05] man's virginity as well as a woman's
[29:07] virginity
[29:10] all right a man has to have one as well
[29:13] as the woman it's not that we can just
[29:14] go out and be anything we want to we can
[29:16] just have intercourse we can do whatever
[29:17] it don't matter about us now that's not
[29:20] what the prophet said
[29:23] he said he can but she can't he can if
[29:27] he's got grounds
[29:30] if not you're right where the Pharisees
[29:32] was says for any cause
[29:34] see that's the way they have it the man
[29:36] for any cause
[29:38] but they surely wouldn't let the woman
[29:39] have any cause
[29:41] the husband had to be dead right
[29:44] because that was the law that was the
[29:46] point all right not a divorce but had to
[29:48] be dead
[29:50] okay so go read that and see that speaks
[29:53] of the man
[29:54] as well and he's guilty just as much as
[29:57] she's guilty
[30:01] and by doing that then
[30:06] if you go and put your wife away for any
[30:09] other reason you remember that
[30:12] a dog treat fornication
[30:15] you're going to cause her to commit
[30:17] adultery I can show you where the
[30:19] prophet in reference to that scripture
[30:20] said she will marry again she will have
[30:23] a man
[30:24] she will do wrong you know and you
[30:27] caused her I didn't cause her I put her
[30:30] away no you caused her because you're
[30:32] the one that caused her to do it so
[30:35] you're guilty of causing her
[30:40] that should be self-explanatory and if
[30:43] you caused her to do that
[30:46] how would it give you grounds for you to
[30:48] be remarried in the Lord
[30:51] because remember you can only marry in
[30:52] the Lord
[30:54] and all men are commanded to my Virgin
[30:59] and surely every woman is commanded to
[31:01] be a virgin
[31:04] but we didn't keep those rules and
[31:06] regulations because we didn't know
[31:08] right he would never talk to us in
[31:10] church like I said this morning you
[31:11] didn't even mention in the 50s you
[31:13] didn't mention the word sex oh that's a
[31:15] dirty word
[31:17] you know we don't use slanderous words
[31:19] like that
[31:22] you know they did have a good modesty
[31:24] about them and things women used to be
[31:26] women and men used to be men
[31:29] you know
[31:30] but now it's kind of changed around and
[31:33] all right
[31:36] no matter who it is
[31:37] if he
[31:39] we are to marry in the Lord
[31:43] we are not to marry unbelievers
[31:47] all right
[31:48] now
[31:51] we're commanded every man is commanded
[31:54] to marry a virgin
[31:57] he's commanded to marry in the Lord
[32:00] and why wouldn't you want to marry a
[32:02] virgin then command it to marry in the
[32:04] Lord we covered that your Prophet would
[32:07] be glad to find these for you
[32:10] my wife being a virgin if I die she
[32:12] marries again she's still a virgin if
[32:14] she was a virgin to start with she stays
[32:16] a virgin
[32:19] that's no problem with saying well well
[32:21] brother Dale how could How could a man
[32:24] marry a woman that had had babies and
[32:26] and been married if she was a virgin to
[32:28] start with and her husband's dead she's
[32:30] still a virgin
[32:32] why can't we get the scripture straight
[32:35] see if the husband's dead Paul said
[32:37] she's free to marry but in the Lord
[32:44] all right we wasn't concerned with these
[32:46] things a long time ago but it's time to
[32:47] be concerned with them
[32:50] like I said I preached it this way in 19
[32:53] and about 70 or 71 or two or somewhere
[32:56] in there or three on marriage and
[32:57] divorce
[32:59] and I still believe it
[33:02] I've added a lot to the thoughts of it
[33:04] but never changed the point of what I
[33:06] tried to say then
[33:09] tried to drive a point down into our
[33:11] minds of one thing none of us
[33:15] have a right to look at anybody else
[33:20] I didn't do that
[33:25] I praise God if you didn't do that
[33:30] but are you the only ones that's going
[33:31] to be in heaven
[33:33] all right now we'll cover this more when
[33:35] we get into invisible Union some people
[33:38] believe that
[33:40] when you're born again you know when you
[33:42] get to New Birth
[33:43] the debt does away with your marital
[33:45] situations
[33:47] well if it did wanted brought around
[33:48] preached marriage and divorce why didn't
[33:49] he just come out and say that right
[33:53] you know I mean why didn't you just come
[33:55] out and say Everybody's Free you've got
[33:57] the new birth you're free
[33:58] no
[34:00] then will you you don't have any script
[34:01] yes I do all sin is without the body
[34:04] except fornication
[34:05] fornication is of the body
[34:07] that's scripture
[34:09] all right that's not saying that all sin
[34:12] is this way no sin and all is simply
[34:14] saying
[34:16] if we are have a guilty part about us
[34:18] we're guilty brother random had no bones
[34:21] to pull with nobody about it
[34:23] and he said Billy Paul or no Billy Paul
[34:26] said he was married and he said I would
[34:29] not do his wedding
[34:33] now that was the way he said it and you
[34:35] know but that's the people don't like
[34:38] for you to talk that away I'm not
[34:39] throwing off on Billy Paul I'm thrown
[34:40] off on all of us
[34:42] all of us
[34:44] because we're going to find out when we
[34:46] get into the where right around takes
[34:48] the invisible union he said this is a
[34:50] higher order
[34:51] of marriage and divorce
[34:54] we're going to find out about organized
[34:56] religion and what caused all these
[34:58] problems for us to be the way we are
[35:01] see what causes some preachers telling
[35:03] you it's okay
[35:05] right right
[35:07] and you go out and you take the
[35:08] preacher's word well right now back this
[35:10] morning on what we were saying
[35:14] if you're going to believe your pastor
[35:16] is ahead the headship remember under the
[35:18] vows we were talking about this morning
[35:20] and look what that preacher is going to
[35:22] be into
[35:25] you know someone come to me now I'm
[35:27] supposed to be the head of the church
[35:28] right as the pastor
[35:30] I'm the headship part of the church all
[35:32] right and you come and you ask me is it
[35:34] okay for me to do this without the other
[35:36] and I tell you it's okay
[35:38] then I've become part of your iniquity
[35:43] so now where's the preacher is going to
[35:45] be that are
[35:46] standing on all of this
[35:49] you know
[35:51] all right
[35:55] see the preacher minister
[35:59] is commanded
[36:01] to marry
[36:02] only a virgin
[36:05] all right
[36:06] he can't marry a woman that's been
[36:08] touched by a man
[36:11] but he can marry according to Ezekiel 44
[36:14] 22.
[36:17] he can marry the wit of a priest
[36:21] but she'd better she if she was the
[36:23] Virgin to start with he can't marry that
[36:25] Widow the priest
[36:26] you understand
[36:29] see the stipulations there's ways of
[36:31] being
[36:34] but he must marry the wit of a priest
[36:36] because he's carrying the word and you
[36:39] say well brother Brown never used that
[36:40] scripture he gave the scripture in
[36:42] marriage and divorce Deuteronomy
[36:44] he gave that scripture in marriage and
[36:47] divorce he knew the scripture all right
[36:51] because to show you how people can work
[36:53] about it we had a certain brother that
[36:54] oh he lambasted me for even quoting that
[36:57] scripture to him and at my table you
[36:59] know he was beating me to death with boy
[37:01] you're wrong you're wrong
[37:05] and about three months later he came
[37:07] back over sitting at the same table and
[37:09] he said brother Dale have you ever read
[37:11] this scripture
[37:17] there's a scripture I was trying to get
[37:19] him to read
[37:21] see he found a woman
[37:26] did he want to marry
[37:28] and she wound up being the Widow of a
[37:30] priest
[37:31] so he used to scripture
[37:34] okay
[37:36] I had no problems with him
[37:39] see that the man can put away his wife
[37:41] only for
[37:44] being a fornicator or fornication
[37:48] which we covered then that Mary you know
[37:50] the adultery and fornication is the same
[37:52] word
[37:53] all right
[37:55] then we covered this morning our this
[37:58] past two Services talked about being an
[38:00] engagement
[38:02] if you're espoused and you're married
[38:05] you're married by your vows as we
[38:07] covered this morning when we covered it
[38:09] Wednesday last Sunday evening
[38:12] Joseph and Mary were a spouse but God
[38:14] said fear not to take unto thee Mary thy
[38:17] wife
[38:18] it was said of Adam in the garden that
[38:22] that is your wife
[38:23] because if your spouse then you're
[38:25] married
[38:27] you're engaged you're married
[38:30] then how many people were going to face
[38:33] it I don't have no wife boy go down to
[38:36] the courthouse see if I've been married
[38:37] but that many times you've been engaged
[38:40] now there is some other things that I
[38:42] could cover and I choose not to at this
[38:43] time about some things that your Prophet
[38:46] had to say
[38:49] on some things that can cause a lot of
[38:52] other situations all right
[38:54] but see when you're when you vow to one
[38:57] another
[38:58] you're married and if you break that vow
[39:00] you're in trouble with God
[39:04] is that where we were covering this
[39:05] morning
[39:07] but we saw this morning something that
[39:09] will relate to marriage and divorce the
[39:11] grace as we
[39:13] we saw that
[39:15] your father
[39:18] can I know
[39:19] your vow
[39:22] all right
[39:24] if it's a young girl the inner youth you
[39:27] know in the Bible
[39:28] we went through that in the scriptures
[39:31] you can disallow The Vow
[39:33] all right
[39:34] and everything can come to a point see
[39:37] if our father
[39:40] if our father
[39:43] which is almighty God right
[39:46] if we approach him correctly honestly
[39:49] and sincerely
[39:53] than our old weddings can be annulled
[40:00] but there's a way we've got to do it
[40:04] all right
[40:08] now I know this is not going to be fun
[40:10] to a lot of people the next few minutes
[40:12] but I must say it
[40:15] as I said our father
[40:18] must be the one that just annoys the
[40:21] vows and the things that we went wrong
[40:24] and that's how close it is to the new
[40:26] birth
[40:27] you know in the new birth
[40:32] he disannodes your vows
[40:34] that you were bound to the devil
[40:37] you were married to him the prophet said
[40:39] kin folks to the devil
[40:42] in the New Birth major Soul pure
[40:47] now here's the basis
[40:49] because we're going to go through some
[40:51] things the prophet said
[40:53] if
[40:54] I'm sorry
[40:56] let's hold on
[40:59] if we're not born again there's no even
[41:01] talking about marriage and divorce
[41:05] right because you got to get the soul
[41:06] right before you can talk about the body
[41:09] right
[41:10] is that
[41:13] if the soul is not right don't worry
[41:15] about it that's why you can't take this
[41:17] imagine divorce Grace and the things to
[41:20] the world
[41:23] and people say well if you need to come
[41:24] over we can straighten out your marital
[41:26] problems how
[41:28] we can mess them up
[41:30] and make you a twofold child of hell
[41:33] all right but if we don't have the new
[41:35] birth
[41:40] qualifications
[41:43] then there's no need of talking about
[41:44] Grace of marriage and divorce
[41:47] so the prophet said it right he said the
[41:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost is the most
[41:52] important thing in your life
[41:56] because you cannot start the thoughts
[41:59] of believing of prophet
[42:02] without first being born again
[42:06] hey come on I'm one standing here
[42:08] looking at you two years I studied this
[42:10] message
[42:12] I didn't come into this message like
[42:13] everybody else I was a Baptist Deacon I
[42:16] was everything in the book in the
[42:17] Baptist Church 23 years old ordained a
[42:20] deacon stood there with him talked to
[42:22] older people I was teaching adult
[42:24] classes when I left the deacons and
[42:27] their Elders are wising thing
[42:29] and a deacon in the Baptist Church is an
[42:31] honored position
[42:35] because they actually run the church
[42:38] and unlike what one brother said one
[42:40] time and he said I don't have no deacons
[42:42] because I don't want to but that
[42:44] responsibility on any other men well I
[42:46] didn't have them for a long time but we
[42:48] have some because we're correct
[42:51] but I'm just saying
[42:55] a point
[42:58] if we're not born again
[43:02] we are believing unto salvation you
[43:04] agree
[43:06] and for two years after coming in this
[43:08] message I sought to baptism of the Holy
[43:09] Ghost
[43:11] reading six books a day and listened to
[43:13] tapes because riding the door won't back
[43:16] and didn't have a lot to do on the job
[43:20] was a firm believer in everything the
[43:22] prophet said
[43:23] but you know what that was just words
[43:28] until I received the new birth
[43:32] he's out born and raised in this message
[43:34] are you born again
[43:35] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[43:36] you believed is that what Paul said
[43:41] see we're trying to figure out marriage
[43:43] and divorce we're not even born again
[43:46] we see everybody like I was saying
[43:47] everybody comes in the message you say
[43:49] well well I had to have the Holy Ghost
[43:50] that led me into the message or what led
[43:52] me
[43:57] when I'm standing here telling you two
[43:58] years
[43:59] and I sought God
[44:02] but then I did receive the new birth
[44:06] was any different brother Dale not in
[44:09] the letter of the word
[44:11] because I had a pretty well a good
[44:13] foundation
[44:17] but see then when that new birth came
[44:19] that word began to come alive
[44:23] a brain here remembers whatsoever I've
[44:26] said and teach you things to come is
[44:28] that the scripture
[44:32] well see I didn't claim that it's
[44:33] because I believe the message that meant
[44:35] I was born again
[44:37] I never made that claim
[44:40] I waited until God gave me something
[44:42] that I knew was the New Birth that could
[44:45] never be questioned by anything and
[44:47] that's why I preached the way I do
[44:49] I preach not a challenge to anybody but
[44:52] I preach openly of what I believe
[44:56] and I stated the way I believe it
[44:59] because I've
[45:01] known that word
[45:03] why try to get off of it now
[45:09] but you understand
[45:11] the first qualification is you must be
[45:14] born again
[45:18] until you get born again
[45:22] well brother Dale I don't know whether I
[45:23] am or not well then you need to seek God
[45:26] yeah but I believe the message I believe
[45:28] this so does the devil
[45:34] well how do you know you're born again
[45:36] God will tell you
[45:39] we see what we want we want brother
[45:41] Branham to come back and tell us
[45:43] we want somebody to tell us
[45:49] we went to the altar pray and I've told
[45:51] you about it and this brother
[45:52] it was like three of us
[45:55] his brother said every one of you
[45:57] received the Holy Ghost tonight
[45:58] well I knew I did
[46:02] and I didn't take it because he's worked
[46:04] but he was a good brother
[46:06] but the other two took it
[46:08] they're saying he said we were born
[46:10] again
[46:12] both of them strong now
[46:17] but I still stayed with the word
[46:19] right
[46:21] now let's get some serious matters of
[46:25] thinking
[46:25] and if I'm a little into this evening
[46:27] forgive me
[46:28] not I want to get it off the heart of
[46:30] this
[46:31] and then we'll do the best we can
[46:34] now
[46:35] talking about disgrace of marriage and
[46:37] divorce we'll read in a minute where
[46:39] brother Brown said that Moses gave a
[46:42] Grace
[46:43] and God counted at righteousness
[46:47] all right let's start off mcdark
[46:51] was the grace to
[46:54] when Moses was there was it to just
[46:56] anybody
[47:01] you know did Moses go out okay world
[47:05] no it was only for the children of
[47:08] Israel
[47:14] he didn't give a writing a divorcement
[47:16] for just anybody
[47:22] all right
[47:24] in the days of the Apostle Paul
[47:28] and the prophet of God said he gave a
[47:30] Grace and God counted at righteousness
[47:32] did Paul give it to everybody
[47:38] no
[47:40] it wasn't to everybody
[47:43] in the days of Moses do you think
[47:46] that Janice and jambres had any hopes on
[47:49] marriage and divorce
[47:51] you remember the two that withstood
[47:53] Moses now if I get the names wrong you
[47:55] put them in the right place and forgive
[47:56] me for being ignorant okay
[47:58] well you think Janice and jamborees that
[48:00] withstood Moses do you think they
[48:03] but you know what they walked with Moses
[48:06] day in and day out
[48:09] if you said something to him Moses said
[48:15] they look like good Believers didn't you
[48:19] but one day they said Moses you take too
[48:22] much on yourself
[48:23] they never argued with him about his
[48:25] Doctrine right
[48:28] they were trying to start a trinity
[48:32] they just said you take too much on
[48:34] yourself we're spiritual also
[48:39] right
[48:41] well do you think they really believed
[48:44] Moses
[48:47] and you think the grace of marriage and
[48:49] divorce done them any good
[48:55] now do you think and I believe they're
[48:58] correct what it filters and how many US
[48:59] that we're stood Paul
[49:02] do you think those two were covered
[49:04] under the grace of marriage and divorce
[49:06] in the days of Paul
[49:13] when they withstood Paul
[49:16] teaching that one of them there's
[49:18] someone that I was even teaching the
[49:19] resurrection had already passed that's
[49:21] right
[49:25] he said what are you getting at brother
[49:26] Dale
[49:28] we'll read in a minute where the prophet
[49:30] of God said this is to my followers
[49:34] only
[49:37] the ones who believe this message
[49:41] marriage and divorce Grace is not to the
[49:44] world
[49:45] it is not to a denominational system
[49:51] now
[49:55] you say yeah but you're just too hard
[49:57] when it comes down to some things
[49:59] what do you think about the people in
[50:00] this message now that are saying brother
[50:02] Brown was wrong here in wrong dark
[50:04] but you ask them about marriage and
[50:06] divorce and they'll tell you that was
[50:07] thus saith the Lord
[50:10] you know why because they needed it
[50:12] right
[50:15] they want to claim it because they
[50:17] needed it
[50:19] but how can you say
[50:21] how can you believe I'm talking to Lula
[50:23] now not the world
[50:26] how can you believe
[50:30] a prophet
[50:32] and believe he was a prophet
[50:35] and believe what it means to be a
[50:38] prophet
[50:39] not a false one now
[50:41] a Bible Prophet that was spoke of in the
[50:43] Bible to come Malachi 4 Luke 17 30
[50:46] Revelation 10 7 all the scriptures being
[50:48] fulfilled
[50:51] and yet you could say that Prophet was
[50:53] wrong
[50:56] we're not talking about stupidities and
[50:58] things when he would say 700 and 7
[51:00] thousands or whatever
[51:03] or some word that he said or some
[51:05] daughter deed or something
[51:14] but we want the grace of marriage and
[51:16] divorce don't we
[51:21] in other words we want to believe what
[51:23] we want to believe
[51:27] now I talked to a man one time about
[51:29] this and he was telling me about the he
[51:32] said well we even believe that
[51:34] that the Bible's right to a degree
[51:39] um this wouldn't
[51:40] believer in the message
[51:44] I said in other words what you're saying
[51:45] is
[51:46] what the Bible says that you agree with
[51:49] is a right that's right but what you
[51:51] don't agree with is you know right
[51:53] that's not God's word
[51:56] do we believe this Bible not a King
[51:59] James version about this song
[52:02] do we believe that this Bible is God's
[52:04] word
[52:08] do we believe we'll be judged by this
[52:10] word
[52:13] that we call the Bible
[52:16] do you believe we'll be
[52:18] judged by it and we'll be set free by it
[52:22] right well it's easy to believe they're
[52:24] setting free
[52:27] the judging part we don't like right
[52:33] do you understand what I'm getting at
[52:37] you know the way I appreciate
[52:40] we do not believe that brother Branham
[52:42] was God
[52:43] no
[52:46] but if we're going to believe that he
[52:48] was the one to fulfill Malachi 4 Luke 17
[52:51] 30 Revelation 10 7 the scriptures that
[52:53] we quote all the time then we're going
[52:55] to have to believe that what he said is
[52:57] the truth
[52:59] whether we like it or understand it or
[53:01] whatever
[53:03] but do we believe it
[53:08] then can't you see that what I'm saying
[53:10] the other day about Satan through his
[53:12] septility
[53:14] and Paul said
[53:16] that has he done to Eve he deceive your
[53:18] mind through the Simplicity that is in
[53:20] the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[53:24] but brother Dale those are good Brothers
[53:28] Janice and jambridge was probably
[53:30] thought of as good Brothers
[53:32] was probably thought of as good Brothers
[53:38] have you ever really just read the Bible
[53:42] you know the 250 priests that stood
[53:45] Moses and the ground opened them up and
[53:46] swallowed them because he said if you're
[53:48] on God's side come over here if you're
[53:49] not just you know that happened in the
[53:51] Bible
[53:52] well you know what happened the next day
[53:54] go read your Bible
[53:57] the next day
[53:59] the people come to Moses and said you
[54:02] kill the people of God
[54:07] I'm honest
[54:10] I just backed up and said dig another
[54:12] hole
[54:15] we'll find out who's on what side
[54:19] is it honest
[54:22] but you see what about the audacity of
[54:25] man's mind
[54:26] to see God publicly in front of all of
[54:28] them vindicate Moses to be who he was
[54:34] and yet they said you killed the people
[54:36] of God
[54:39] the holy and raise them from the dead
[54:45] Church
[54:48] you think that that won't be done the
[54:49] Bible said it could come a day did they
[54:51] kill you thinking of doing God of
[54:52] service
[54:56] I don't go to service
[54:58] he don't need no help
[55:01] he can take care of his own problems
[55:05] but do we really believe brother Branham
[55:07] was a prophet
[55:10] and what does the prophet mean
[55:15] a prophet means a mouthpiece of God
[55:18] man
[55:21] a prophet means a man on Earth
[55:25] that is used to bring God's word to you
[55:27] and I
[55:31] Janice and jambridge might have wanted
[55:33] to be a little spiritual
[55:37] but they couldn't talk about marriage
[55:38] and divorce
[55:40] right
[55:47] she didn't think about it
[55:50] a prophet
[55:54] now I know you're not going to something
[55:55] like this but go ahead
[55:57] a prophet is your only hope
[56:03] and let's see if you believe the rest of
[56:05] the scripture
[56:12] you remember God wanted to speak to man
[56:14] himself
[56:21] now just as Eve represented us and
[56:24] brought us into a sinful condition right
[56:26] you agree
[56:29] just don't agree too loud because
[56:33] you know I'm going to say something else
[56:39] so now I
[56:42] if our dependence is upon whether or not
[56:44] God sent a prophet
[56:52] a prophet even Balaam
[56:55] prophesied
[56:58] it's in the scripture amen
[57:00] he said I can't say nothing but what God
[57:04] puts in my mouth
[57:08] he didn't prophesy wrong he prophesied
[57:11] the truth
[57:15] but then he went out and deceived the
[57:16] people into going wrong
[57:18] and got him into the wrong things
[57:21] right
[57:23] but what he said is in the Bible
[57:25] because he said a prophet can't say
[57:28] his own words
[57:33] but what about the people today that
[57:35] said brother random oh yes we believe in
[57:37] marriage and divorce now oh yes
[57:38] wonderful Oh Glory I'm free because he
[57:41] said oh man
[57:42] but he was kind of little wrong over
[57:44] here
[57:45] I'm kind of little wrong over there he
[57:48] taught this wrong and he taught that
[57:49] wrong and
[57:51] he should have said not have said if it
[57:53] had been me I would have said
[57:56] all right
[58:03] do we really know what it means to be a
[58:05] for God to send a prophet
[58:10] God wanted to speak to everybody
[58:14] he told Moses bring him out here there
[58:16] was a burning bush
[58:18] for Moses to stand in front of when they
[58:21] got back the whole Mountain was on fire
[58:23] there was a bush for everybody
[58:26] to speak to God
[58:28] but you know what to say it
[58:32] they said Moses you go up and get it and
[58:34] bring it down to us and find out what
[58:35] God wants and we'll do it
[58:38] brother Ryan said that was the biggest
[58:40] mistake they ever made
[58:43] he said that's where they chose law for
[58:45] Grace
[58:47] that's his words
[58:51] and as he represented us and put us into
[58:54] sin
[58:57] the people that was back there that said
[58:59] we don't want to hear from God
[59:01] Moses you go up and get it bring it back
[59:04] down and we'll do it
[59:05] that represented you and I
[59:08] and put us to work under condemnation a
[59:12] prophet is sent
[59:16] but yet this Bible would not be here for
[59:18] us today without the prophets
[59:21] this Bible is the prophets right
[59:24] it's their words
[59:26] are we going to annihilate this one
[59:29] take him out he don't agree with me take
[59:32] this now
[59:34] first thing you know you ain't gonna
[59:35] have no pages left
[59:37] right
[59:40] you see this is the law and the prophets
[59:43] and the law of the Ten Commandments was
[59:45] God in the letter form
[59:47] right what's your Prophet had to say
[59:52] do we really realize what it means to be
[59:54] a prophet
[59:58] you know that run around and said
[1:00:00] Moses was God
[1:00:03] the Bible says it you know
[1:00:06] says you'll be guarded
[1:00:08] Aaron will be your Prophet all right
[1:00:12] what about arguing with your prophet
[1:00:21] you could go into carnalities
[1:00:26] and say whatever the prophet said I
[1:00:27] believe it
[1:00:30] if he was speaking of God there was time
[1:00:32] to brother Brown and will tell you that
[1:00:33] some of this is man and so much God
[1:00:38] when he like to forward and Billy Paul
[1:00:40] liked the Chevrolet
[1:00:44] Boy Billy Paul didn't believe his daddy
[1:00:47] he'd be driving a Ford
[1:00:52] um
[1:00:55] he liked to hunt when other people
[1:00:56] didn't like to hunt
[1:01:00] see we're not into the natural carnality
[1:01:02] we're in what the word has to say Amen
[1:01:08] amen we want to argue that one of the
[1:01:10] teaching of one God
[1:01:11] of course now they are
[1:01:14] in their say any wooden God to the River
[1:01:16] Jordan you know but you know that same
[1:01:18] people would be glad to accept the grace
[1:01:20] of marriage and divorce
[1:01:24] what about somebody we were talking
[1:01:25] about life not teaching two Lords out of
[1:01:27] the Bible that there's only one God
[1:01:35] and I quoted this scripture you know
[1:01:37] that the Bible you're talking about two
[1:01:38] Souls you know we were on last night in
[1:01:41] the discussion
[1:01:42] you know the Bible does say that a
[1:01:44] double-minded man
[1:01:46] is what
[1:01:49] he's unstable in all of his ways
[1:01:52] you go look up the original on that if
[1:01:55] you like it it's laying in an office
[1:01:58] the original says the Greek says a two
[1:02:01] Soul Man
[1:02:05] what's the original says
[1:02:07] is unstable in his ways
[1:02:10] I said that to a brother one time he
[1:02:12] said don't you scripture like that I do
[1:02:14] I wouldn't use a scripture like that
[1:02:17] I was just saying what it said
[1:02:21] you see you think I'm hard you think I'm
[1:02:23] a dirty old dude you know I always but I
[1:02:25] get pretty hard
[1:02:28] yeah
[1:02:29] but you try to be nice you don't want to
[1:02:31] beat people to death you know
[1:02:35] the brother last night he was saying
[1:02:36] this and that and the other and I said
[1:02:37] listen brother I said you're sitting
[1:02:39] there from one side that you followed
[1:02:40] down and studied this and I said we're
[1:02:42] sitting over here that we've done been
[1:02:44] through where you came from
[1:02:46] they want to beat him to death tell him
[1:02:47] he's wrong
[1:02:50] you'll never reach him that away
[1:02:53] but do you know what it means that we
[1:02:55] can say we've had a prophet
[1:03:01] is there any difference now let me ask
[1:03:03] you at this point do we believe these
[1:03:05] prophets were were wrong
[1:03:07] the mouthpiece of God
[1:03:09] bring God's word unto us well then if if
[1:03:15] wrote a random
[1:03:16] you know was the messenger of Malachi 4
[1:03:19] Luke 17 30 Revelation 10 7 the
[1:03:21] scriptures and all
[1:03:23] just because he wouldn't rotten prophet
[1:03:26] you know
[1:03:31] but you know what a lot of those
[1:03:32] prophets never wrote their message
[1:03:35] very few of them did
[1:03:40] you angry
[1:03:42] most of them were written by somebody
[1:03:43] else
[1:03:47] be the Green Man
[1:03:49] they had a scribe that went with him and
[1:03:51] wrote
[1:03:54] would you say well brother Brandon
[1:03:56] nobody's about
[1:03:58] 1400 sermons
[1:04:01] that are live voices that's a whole lot
[1:04:04] better than to read off of a page yeah
[1:04:08] and things and some sitting here that
[1:04:11] were there that seen the dead Rays the
[1:04:13] sick healed and
[1:04:16] all kind of things
[1:04:18] to show that he was a prophet
[1:04:22] do we put our total dependence upon him
[1:04:25] being a prophet
[1:04:28] we said well we'll take this Doctrine
[1:04:29] we'll take this Doctrine we'll take this
[1:04:31] but we don't know about that
[1:04:34] now
[1:04:36] you know like Feller said one time that
[1:04:39] that brother random got serpent see from
[1:04:41] no hermit up in the mountain
[1:04:46] you know
[1:04:48] well
[1:04:50] if he did why does it matter
[1:04:53] God used it to show him the truth
[1:04:58] my daddy died in 45.
[1:05:01] my daddy told my mother
[1:05:04] what happened in the garden
[1:05:09] he laughed when she said they ate an
[1:05:11] apple that was her words my wife was
[1:05:13] sitting there as a witness
[1:05:17] mama told her told me why she really
[1:05:19] tell me why we don't believe that
[1:05:21] Doctrine y'all believe in that serpent
[1:05:23] seed stuff you know and all what
[1:05:25] happened he said she told her said
[1:05:27] Mayors Dale and you remember what Mr
[1:05:29] Dale told you Mama never said another
[1:05:32] word about marriage and divorce
[1:05:35] because daddy told her what happened he
[1:05:38] said was he a prophet no no he's a plain
[1:05:41] old country boy that had some common
[1:05:43] sense
[1:05:48] you know
[1:05:50] because anybody with common sense
[1:05:53] can read the Bible and see
[1:05:55] what happened
[1:05:58] I mean you know all right but listen
[1:06:03] but we want to accept what we want
[1:06:08] of the message
[1:06:14] but what's going to happen one of these
[1:06:16] days when they ask you
[1:06:20] there was a man by the name of Martin
[1:06:21] Luther most of you seen the videos of
[1:06:24] him the different things
[1:06:27] they called him in about what he wrote
[1:06:32] and they asked him to
[1:06:35] first off
[1:06:36] recant
[1:06:38] for what he had said
[1:06:41] he said he said I can't do that
[1:06:45] so they kind of weakened down a little
[1:06:48] bit and they said well
[1:06:50] did you
[1:06:52] say this
[1:06:54] that's in these books
[1:06:58] he could sit
[1:07:00] I don't know
[1:07:03] I never read the book
[1:07:06] but that one what he said
[1:07:13] he said I can't take back what I wrote
[1:07:18] he said because that's what I believe
[1:07:21] all right
[1:07:25] now if he could be that strong about his
[1:07:27] words
[1:07:29] did not the prophet said you'll be
[1:07:31] condemned by what I say he said that's
[1:07:33] why you say what I say
[1:07:41] right
[1:07:42] you know he said that the white horse
[1:07:44] rider was the
[1:07:46] holy ghost in fact his early Ministry
[1:07:49] you know you could have went around you
[1:07:51] could have preached all over the country
[1:07:52] that the white horse riders the Holy
[1:07:53] Ghost
[1:07:54] God wouldn't help you responsible
[1:07:57] because it was the words of a prophet
[1:08:01] but when he come out and said it's the
[1:08:03] Antichrist in that end to Death now you
[1:08:05] don't go say no more
[1:08:07] right
[1:08:09] is our dependence upon whether or not
[1:08:11] God sent a prophet
[1:08:13] we all talk about that the prophet's
[1:08:17] message
[1:08:18] was sent to bring us to a change of the
[1:08:20] body right
[1:08:23] don't you believe that but this message
[1:08:25] was brought to bring us to a change
[1:08:28] well it couldn't be done with anybody
[1:08:30] else's it couldn't be done under Luther
[1:08:32] Wesley Pentecost of what Baptist
[1:08:34] anything it couldn't be done under those
[1:08:35] Doctrine even though they had truth
[1:08:39] it would have to be somebody with the
[1:08:40] truth
[1:08:44] it's kind of odd
[1:08:48] oh Dylan's brother random when he was
[1:08:49] alive right
[1:08:55] he said get your Bible and come up here
[1:08:56] and stand beside of me
[1:09:00] oh they wouldn't do that
[1:09:03] but now
[1:09:04] they're running about the country
[1:09:08] Lord showed me he was wrong
[1:09:12] then the others are saying well now no
[1:09:15] no I I'm not going to say that he's
[1:09:16] wrong
[1:09:17] I'm going to say he should have said it
[1:09:21] and this is what he taught
[1:09:24] you know we'll give you the quotes like
[1:09:27] I said tonight's not talking about the
[1:09:29] two Soul people they had a favorite
[1:09:31] quote
[1:09:32] they quoted wrote around him and saying
[1:09:34] the soul is just the nature of the
[1:09:36] spirit there's not a quote for that no
[1:09:37] more
[1:09:40] brother said to soul is the nature of
[1:09:42] his Spirit he didn't say just
[1:09:44] so they added one word
[1:09:46] and if you say it's just the nature of
[1:09:47] the spirits you make it on irrelevant or
[1:09:50] doesn't have any meaning to it
[1:09:53] if I tell you there's a bar outside but
[1:09:55] he's just a buyer there's no hindrance
[1:09:57] you ain't afraid of him
[1:09:59] why because I injected the word just
[1:10:01] into it and made it be something
[1:10:02] different
[1:10:04] do you believe that God sent a prophet
[1:10:09] and that that Prophet that words of that
[1:10:11] Prophet is what we'll stand on
[1:10:19] it well I just can't put all of my hopes
[1:10:20] in that I got to have a little bit over
[1:10:22] here
[1:10:25] I remember years ago when you know a lot
[1:10:27] of them knew what was going to happen to
[1:10:28] the American systems
[1:10:30] and a lot of preachers put money in the
[1:10:32] Swiss bank account
[1:10:38] because that's the safest place to put
[1:10:39] your money
[1:10:41] because it's just kind of you know a
[1:10:43] common thing of it being safe there
[1:10:47] well
[1:10:49] just in case this don't work
[1:10:54] people swearing screaming and hollering
[1:10:57] there's a Rapture had to come by 73 and
[1:10:59] a half
[1:11:01] or coming by 75 or 77 especially
[1:11:06] how many of sermons you ever heard on
[1:11:08] that
[1:11:11] well we're still here
[1:11:17] right
[1:11:20] was he wrong no I proved in 74.
[1:11:24] that we could pass the year 2026 and
[1:11:27] never break one of brother branham's
[1:11:29] messages are the scripture
[1:11:31] but who wants to know about that
[1:11:33] they don't want to know
[1:11:36] I'm not invited to go anywhere preach on
[1:11:38] that they won't even say how did you
[1:11:39] come up with that idea
[1:11:43] why
[1:11:46] how many people really believe brother
[1:11:47] Brown's message
[1:11:49] we've just been through series on Daniel
[1:11:52] 70 weeks
[1:11:59] and the life when it come down to there
[1:12:00] happened to be a bunch of people
[1:12:01] downstairs here at the church
[1:12:05] and this certain brother was jumping so
[1:12:07] hard up and down and screaming get off
[1:12:09] of these things get on something else
[1:12:11] do these bouncing the floor and one lady
[1:12:13] I won't say no more she said
[1:12:16] I send black folks up there jumping up
[1:12:18] and down about what's being said it
[1:12:20] wasn't them black folks it was her daddy
[1:12:27] see who wants to know the truth
[1:12:34] as I was saying while ago about Martin
[1:12:36] Luther what would happen brother dick
[1:12:37] when they come down to you and I and
[1:12:39] they hold up a quote book
[1:12:42] and they say do you believe that
[1:12:52] you mean you believe everything he said
[1:12:56] he said no no I don't believe our thing
[1:12:57] said because he did have words wrong he
[1:12:59] did say Mary and Martha they said we're
[1:13:01] not talking about that now we're talking
[1:13:03] about a Doctrine do you believe every
[1:13:05] Doctrine he brought
[1:13:08] you can't say that you believe every
[1:13:10] Doctrine brother random brought to be
[1:13:11] the truth then you're making him a false
[1:13:14] prophet
[1:13:18] now how can you accept the grace of
[1:13:20] marriage and divorce if you've got a
[1:13:21] false prophet
[1:13:24] you got a false Grace
[1:13:29] you see why I'm not popular
[1:13:36] but they won't nobody come and argue
[1:13:38] about it either
[1:13:41] he says that make you something no makes
[1:13:43] me just what I am 40 something years
[1:13:45] studying a message
[1:13:48] going into 50 years now
[1:13:52] and I challenge anybody in this message
[1:13:54] to show me where he was out of the word
[1:13:58] or to show me where the Bible is wrong
[1:14:04] because if it is
[1:14:06] we are lost
[1:14:08] enter of all men most miserable no we
[1:14:13] just like the brother was saying last
[1:14:14] night I see them I knew him immediately
[1:14:16] then he had had a lot of contact with
[1:14:17] with organized religion because his
[1:14:20] point was I think we just need to stay
[1:14:22] with Jesus in the Simplicity of
[1:14:24] salvation
[1:14:25] right right
[1:14:28] see that's the whole thing what is in
[1:14:30] this message we don't need to know these
[1:14:32] deep things
[1:14:34] we just believe
[1:14:36] that God sent a prophet
[1:14:38] well what is ending
[1:14:45] okay
[1:14:48] now do you understand what brother Dale
[1:14:50] stands
[1:14:52] I'm not into stupidity of thanking
[1:14:54] everything brother Brown said was right
[1:14:56] because there was a lot of things he
[1:14:57] said was incorrect
[1:15:00] but not incorrect in that he was telling
[1:15:02] it wrong he would tell a story of this
[1:15:04] happening and then he'd retell it over
[1:15:06] here and they'd be things he'd tell here
[1:15:08] that wasn't over here
[1:15:10] right
[1:15:12] we read in just a moment
[1:15:14] that brother by Adam said in the
[1:15:17] marriage and divorce
[1:15:19] that were the imagined divorce Grace was
[1:15:21] revealed
[1:15:23] was on a mountain
[1:15:28] he said the same Mountain marriage that
[1:15:31] the seals was revealed on
[1:15:42] you know he's one thousand percent
[1:15:43] correct
[1:15:46] but
[1:15:48] according to him
[1:15:52] sunset Mountain was where the Angels
[1:15:54] Came Down on the seals
[1:15:56] Lehman Mountain which is in another
[1:15:58] Direction only 30 40 minutes up the road
[1:16:00] from home is where marriage and divorce
[1:16:02] was revealed
[1:16:12] but there's one little quote
[1:16:16] that you don't wait long enough for God
[1:16:18] to speak to you
[1:16:21] he said marriage and divorce was
[1:16:23] revealed in the seals
[1:16:28] sunset Mountain
[1:16:31] was where it was revealed
[1:16:34] Lehman Mountain was where it was told
[1:16:36] him the grace that could come we'll get
[1:16:39] that in a minute he said I had the
[1:16:40] scriptures on marriage in divorce
[1:16:45] but he'll say it's the same Mountain
[1:16:49] like sister Barbara's husband he was
[1:16:51] telling me all the contradictions in the
[1:16:52] Bible and I said please show them to me
[1:16:54] he said well here it says in David that
[1:16:56] he had 40 000 chariots and said here he
[1:16:58] said he had four thousand in Jerusalem
[1:17:01] no problem he had 36 000 somewhere else
[1:17:07] you know I wasn't laughing at him I'm
[1:17:10] just sensible
[1:17:11] it said 40 000 in one place none of this
[1:17:13] says he had four thousand and so he had
[1:17:15] thirty six thousand somewhere else
[1:17:18] right one author will say two Blind Men
[1:17:22] well I'm gonna say one
[1:17:25] is that a contradiction
[1:17:30] me
[1:17:31] you see what it is that we got in our
[1:17:33] own mind
[1:17:34] what we want to believe
[1:17:40] and until God speaks to that mind that
[1:17:44] individual person any one of us
[1:17:47] and show the truth we don't know what
[1:17:49] truth is
[1:17:51] I don't care how much you said you
[1:17:52] believe it
[1:17:55] how many times do you think Martin
[1:17:57] Luther probably ready to just shall live
[1:17:58] by faith
[1:18:00] but one day when he read it it come off
[1:18:02] the pages he wrote just your living
[1:18:04] alone
[1:18:06] while it was revealed to him he wouldn't
[1:18:09] protest the Catholic church until God
[1:18:11] spoke to him
[1:18:17] well everyone said I wouldn't preach on
[1:18:19] the hell until it was revealed
[1:18:22] is that his words
[1:18:25] he said but once it's revealed he said
[1:18:27] then I challenge anybody
[1:18:29] come and show me where it's wrong
[1:18:33] do we really have everything based upon
[1:18:37] God sent in the prophet
[1:18:41] we all put too much emphasis up on a man
[1:18:43] yeah
[1:18:45] I got it on you
[1:18:51] he's wrong here who are you
[1:18:53] show me your credentials
[1:18:55] bring them to me from the word of God
[1:18:58] and then stand there and let God back it
[1:19:00] up
[1:19:06] but the Bible says if a man come and
[1:19:08] give you a sign
[1:19:10] and the sign come to pass
[1:19:14] and he take you to another God don't
[1:19:16] believe him
[1:19:24] what does it mean to be a prophet
[1:19:27] what does it mean to be a follower
[1:19:29] follower of this message
[1:19:34] what if they come to you one of these
[1:19:35] days and they said you really believe
[1:19:37] this man
[1:19:38] what are you going to say
[1:19:42] the coach going to jail if you do
[1:19:44] what are you going to say
[1:19:53] what about those who saved right around
[1:19:54] was wrong
[1:19:56] what about people who say the Bible was
[1:19:58] wrong
[1:19:59] then it evidently as we just get to
[1:20:02] decide which one's right and wrong by
[1:20:03] what you say
[1:20:07] right
[1:20:11] so if you tell me the Bible's wrong
[1:20:13] you're supposed to be able to tell me
[1:20:15] what's right
[1:20:26] and you're the one I'm supposed to be
[1:20:27] following
[1:20:29] right if you can correct brother Brown
[1:20:32] if you can correct the Bible I'm
[1:20:33] supposed to follow you
[1:20:36] I don't mind talking that away
[1:20:40] because it shows where I've got my heart
[1:20:42] set everything is set
[1:20:44] that this Bible is right
[1:20:46] it is the word of God
[1:20:49] a lot of it I don't understand
[1:20:51] but I believe it from cover to cover and
[1:20:54] everything's in between that I
[1:20:55] understand
[1:20:58] right
[1:21:00] I believe this prophet's message
[1:21:07] my whole dependence is upon
[1:21:10] see my salvation was not is not based I
[1:21:13] maybe I need to explain something
[1:21:15] because people the way they
[1:21:15] misunderstand you my salvation is based
[1:21:18] upon whether Jesus Christ died or not
[1:21:21] but you know what I can only read that
[1:21:22] according to what somebody said
[1:21:25] right so how do I know that the Bible is
[1:21:27] not a bunch of fake
[1:21:29] written by some man or something
[1:21:31] whatever
[1:21:37] no man can call Jesus a Christ or
[1:21:39] whatever it says except what
[1:21:42] unless it be a born-again experience by
[1:21:44] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:48] um
[1:21:50] because if God can't keep his word
[1:21:52] straight how many times have you heard
[1:21:53] the prophet say that
[1:21:56] he said if God can't keep his word
[1:21:58] straight then we got a problem
[1:22:02] well I don't believe this because the
[1:22:04] King James come down from here and this
[1:22:06] come over here and it's up to it in here
[1:22:08] and
[1:22:09] Vatican you know vulgates are different
[1:22:16] you know why I believe the King James
[1:22:18] version to be right
[1:22:22] now listen
[1:22:25] first off it was one the prophet used
[1:22:27] and he Vindicated second off it's the
[1:22:30] one God used to get me to him
[1:22:33] and that's a greater Vindication than to
[1:22:35] say that I believe brother Brown to be a
[1:22:36] prophet
[1:22:45] was on the mountain
[1:22:49] right he's up there with Jesus when
[1:22:51] they've come down you know and Matthew
[1:22:53] 17 or what it is all right
[1:22:55] but he said I have a more sure word of
[1:23:00] Prophecy well because he had a personal
[1:23:02] experience inside of him people die from
[1:23:06] personal experiences but him knowledge
[1:23:08] won't take you to death
[1:23:10] you will run every time
[1:23:16] his knowledge will take you away
[1:23:19] but the Bible's right in one place and
[1:23:21] wrong the other who decides what's right
[1:23:22] and wrong
[1:23:26] all right
[1:23:28] if the prophet's writing one message
[1:23:30] wrong the other one who's decide which
[1:23:32] one's right and which one's wrong
[1:23:41] if we can't qualify for all of the word
[1:23:44] how can we qualify for part of it
[1:23:49] we must be totally dependent upon
[1:23:52] who has spoken to us right
[1:23:57] now the life statement I'll make is
[1:23:58] brother Branham
[1:24:00] he said and the word of the Lord
[1:24:04] came to the prophets
[1:24:07] he didn't say prophet
[1:24:10] he said Prophets
[1:24:13] that's the life statement he made in
[1:24:15] marriage and divorce he's having people
[1:24:16] to stand and some with our today
[1:24:18] preached it
[1:24:22] so are we dependent upon God to keep his
[1:24:24] word straight
[1:24:27] remember if he can't keep it straight he
[1:24:29] can't judge us
[1:24:35] come on
[1:24:37] if he's wrong he can't judge me and you
[1:24:39] for being wrong
[1:24:41] have I been through all of these things
[1:24:44] so now let's just start reading a little
[1:24:45] bit so go ahead brother now if I go a
[1:24:48] little empty I'm sorry
[1:24:49] I'll try to read as fast as I can and
[1:24:51] not make much comments because the rest
[1:24:53] of this is self-explanatory
[1:24:57] so we start off on the first quote from
[1:24:59] the prophet paragraph 277. all of this
[1:25:02] will be for marriage and divorce so if I
[1:25:03] don't say it it's our 65 2 21 in the
[1:25:06] morning
[1:25:08] now on the marriage and divorce
[1:25:12] it has to be revealed
[1:25:14] oh I got a backup excuse me Josh is
[1:25:18] having to help me on the thing now I'll
[1:25:19] try to stand over here so keep sending
[1:25:21] me back now on the marriage and divorce
[1:25:23] it has to be revealed until it's
[1:25:25] revealed you don't know it
[1:25:29] that's does that need anybody do I need
[1:25:32] to interpret that you know is anything
[1:25:34] in language that got fouled up somewhere
[1:25:38] it's self-explanatory unless it's
[1:25:40] revealed you don't know it
[1:25:41] I just believe it brother
[1:25:45] well amen
[1:25:47] as the Holy Ghost revealed it to you
[1:25:50] it's in marriage and divorce I don't
[1:25:52] think I've brought it wrote around and
[1:25:53] said when you get a revelation that is
[1:25:56] your wife
[1:25:59] has it ever been to revealed to you that
[1:26:01] that is your wife or that is your
[1:26:03] husband
[1:26:05] have you ever prayed for revelation of
[1:26:08] whether it's not and we certainly don't
[1:26:10] believe in Soul mating to lay one down
[1:26:12] and go get another one
[1:26:15] like the people of the message they're
[1:26:16] interested in find out what Paul brought
[1:26:18] around would say Paul had another hive
[1:26:21] you know
[1:26:24] I ain't worried about we had two hives
[1:26:26] or three hives
[1:26:27] I'm withered about I'm worried about
[1:26:29] whether or not I'm right
[1:26:33] I'm not worried about his experience but
[1:26:35] look what he said
[1:26:37] but he promised in this last days now
[1:26:40] look where it's placed on
[1:26:41] I love this
[1:26:43] because it goes right back to where I
[1:26:45] was talking about because where does he
[1:26:46] go to
[1:26:48] that every hidden Mystery in the Bible
[1:26:49] would be revealed how many knows that
[1:26:51] Revelation is the 10th chapter
[1:26:54] Jesus Promised it that all those hidden
[1:26:57] mysteries on marriage and divorce and
[1:26:59] all these other hidden things be
[1:27:01] revealed in the end time
[1:27:03] now where were they revealed
[1:27:06] now you remember the voice said go to
[1:27:07] Tucson remember the Mystic light in the
[1:27:09] sky the seventh Angels standing there
[1:27:10] come back in the opening of The Seven
[1:27:12] Seals watch what's taking place
[1:27:16] brother Brown said marriage and divorce
[1:27:18] was revealed in the seals he said the
[1:27:20] rapture we thank God for the opening of
[1:27:24] the seals to bring out this message of
[1:27:27] the rapture
[1:27:30] come on
[1:27:36] you know that he made the Ten
[1:27:37] Commandments
[1:27:38] the seals of the Old Testament
[1:27:45] he said when these Ten Commandments came
[1:27:47] the seals were broke you know what was
[1:27:49] broke to Moses on the mountain the seals
[1:27:53] he said well how do you know that
[1:27:54] because right around the city got God in
[1:27:56] a letter form
[1:27:57] he said they didn't understand he said
[1:27:59] they wanted the Book of Rules we said
[1:28:02] they got God in letter form
[1:28:05] well see we're not supposed to be
[1:28:06] talking about God in a letter form
[1:28:10] right
[1:28:11] so what is the first thing it must be
[1:28:14] revealed
[1:28:16] who is it too go ahead with number two
[1:28:20] paragraph 280 basically from here on be
[1:28:22] almost constant reading of the same two
[1:28:26] paragraph 281
[1:28:28] and I remember I said this to this to I
[1:28:32] say this to just my group only and not
[1:28:35] in the hour I'm saying this to only my
[1:28:38] own followers
[1:28:40] this message is only to them and what
[1:28:43] I'm going to say here he said now you
[1:28:45] ministers you can do what you want to
[1:28:47] that's up to you I'm not speaking here
[1:28:50] in Jeffersonville the only place he
[1:28:52] would just say and this is to the
[1:28:53] Jeffersonville people
[1:28:57] I
[1:28:59] not the only place I would speak this at
[1:29:02] is because this is the only place I'd
[1:29:04] speak this app is because it's my own
[1:29:06] flock but he wasn't just speaking of
[1:29:09] that it's to the bride of Christ right
[1:29:13] it's the because it's not we better all
[1:29:14] go to Jeff
[1:29:16] I'm serious
[1:29:18] a lot of them believe when the brother
[1:29:20] random went out in West they went out
[1:29:22] there with him
[1:29:24] whole church has moved if we believe
[1:29:27] it's got to be the Jeffersonville we
[1:29:28] better go to Jeffersonville
[1:29:33] right no problem
[1:29:36] it's the flock that the Holy Ghost gave
[1:29:38] me to understand to be overseer all over
[1:29:40] and he will hold me responsible for it
[1:29:43] and these people of mine has been
[1:29:45] converts here from across the land that
[1:29:48] I've led to Christ and little children
[1:29:49] I'm here to help you and I am your
[1:29:51] friend you might think I speak against
[1:29:53] you I'm saying this see for your good I
[1:29:57] love you and if it isn't so God is my
[1:30:00] judge you know I love you
[1:30:03] jumped up to paragraph 299
[1:30:06] number three
[1:30:11] I got 299 he says this is to my church
[1:30:14] only
[1:30:15] not my church
[1:30:17] the little flock that believes me and
[1:30:19] fathers me this is to them
[1:30:21] the other day knowing that when I tell
[1:30:23] you anything it must come thus saith the
[1:30:26] Lord then I had the scriptures listen to
[1:30:28] that quote
[1:30:30] then I had the scriptures as he revealed
[1:30:33] it to me
[1:30:36] and show you where he goes into conduct
[1:30:38] order and Doctrine
[1:30:39] and he goes into another message there
[1:30:41] and said the Lord spoke to him going
[1:30:43] down the road and told him he said go
[1:30:44] lay it Go appreciate that and lay it
[1:30:45] aside
[1:30:47] you know on marriage and divorce
[1:30:49] look what he said
[1:30:52] he said he had the scriptures as he
[1:30:54] revealed it to him
[1:30:57] but Lord God what can I do
[1:31:00] that congregation I'll have separations
[1:31:04] now you go into conduct order and
[1:31:06] Doctrine
[1:31:07] and you'll find brother Branham saying
[1:31:09] this in 64. this is 65. see
[1:31:13] he said go on As You Are
[1:31:15] things have been made right before
[1:31:19] what's he speaking from
[1:31:21] the revelation of the word
[1:31:25] he knew of the grace of Moses and the
[1:31:27] grace of Paul
[1:31:31] he said he had the scriptures on it
[1:31:36] but you don't play when you come out
[1:31:38] with what he did
[1:31:41] it took a personal contact from God to
[1:31:44] the prophet before he would speak it
[1:31:46] right
[1:31:47] well I just do it presumption well yeah
[1:31:50] exploded for everybody let's go
[1:31:53] now you're presuming
[1:31:56] you're venturing without Authority
[1:32:00] see
[1:32:02] all right we're on number one
[1:32:04] finish number three
[1:32:07] look at number four paragraph 307
[1:32:10] through 310.
[1:32:12] friends and then I'm closing you can go
[1:32:14] from this
[1:32:16] that's when this was being revealed to
[1:32:18] me you're talking about when he was up
[1:32:19] on the mountain I turned the little boy
[1:32:21] said brother random I show you right
[1:32:23] where he is at
[1:32:26] what am I going to tell you right now so
[1:32:28] don't miss it now this is what he said
[1:32:30] being revealed for what he's going to
[1:32:31] tell him
[1:32:32] all right name remember well my point
[1:32:34] was he had the scriptures
[1:32:39] what about a man standing with the
[1:32:41] scriptures
[1:32:42] knowing that God gave the grace in the
[1:32:44] days of Moses and Paul because he had
[1:32:47] the scriptures
[1:32:50] but yet knowing that he would be
[1:32:51] presuming if he stepped out there
[1:32:53] himself and said it
[1:32:56] because there's no written word
[1:33:00] he could read Moses
[1:33:02] he could read Paul
[1:33:05] but there was no written word
[1:33:11] you better believe right around was a
[1:33:12] prophet
[1:33:15] watch it
[1:33:17] now I'm speaking to our followers only
[1:33:19] who is following me and this message
[1:33:20] only not the outside by me record of
[1:33:23] this before God dusted this Groupon we
[1:33:25] are found in this mess because of
[1:33:27] misinterpreted theology is that right
[1:33:28] that's why you women married the second
[1:33:30] time and you men because they
[1:33:32] misinterpreted theology now I want to
[1:33:34] show you something that he told me
[1:33:37] and if God our creator
[1:33:41] before I read that point dirty you know
[1:33:43] that brother random said
[1:33:46] that this marriage and divorce was a
[1:33:48] question in God's word I'll read that to
[1:33:49] you in just a minute
[1:33:52] now where can it be a question in God's
[1:33:54] word
[1:33:59] he tells you right there what the
[1:34:00] question is
[1:34:05] not read too many he says it's a
[1:34:06] question in God's word
[1:34:10] he said God's Prophet was questioned
[1:34:15] because that's what he said can a man
[1:34:16] put his wife for anything
[1:34:19] so when I read it we're found in this
[1:34:21] mess because of misinterpreted theology
[1:34:23] is that right that's why you women
[1:34:24] married the second time you've been
[1:34:26] because misinterpret technology I want
[1:34:28] to show you something that he told me
[1:34:30] and if God our creator was questioned
[1:34:32] the question when he was here on Earth
[1:34:35] he says Jesus Christ
[1:34:39] and when was Jesus questioned
[1:34:42] by the Pharisees in Matthew 19.
[1:34:47] three through nine
[1:34:49] there was not a question in God's word
[1:34:51] like something wrong with God's word it
[1:34:54] wasn't correct
[1:34:55] they questioned the word
[1:34:58] right follow me
[1:35:02] if our God our creator would question
[1:35:03] the question when he was here on Earth
[1:35:05] Jesus Christ and when he is delivering
[1:35:08] Prophet came forth Moses down in Egypt
[1:35:11] to bring the children out of out of
[1:35:12] Egypt to put them in the promised land
[1:35:14] and Jesus said here that Moses seen the
[1:35:17] people in this condition
[1:35:19] and he granted them a writing of
[1:35:20] divorcement
[1:35:22] because the situation was what it was
[1:35:24] Moses found such as let him suffer God
[1:35:28] permitted Moses that Prophet sent to the
[1:35:30] people to Grant this writing of
[1:35:33] divorcement to them
[1:35:36] now I've done been through that so I
[1:35:38] don't have to preach no more Moses never
[1:35:41] gave a writing a divorcement for any
[1:35:42] time
[1:35:44] you know everything
[1:35:46] it was stated in Deuteronomy 24 what it
[1:35:49] was
[1:35:51] okay go ahead to the next
[1:35:56] 3 11. in First Corinthians the seventh
[1:35:59] chapter and the 12th and 15th verse
[1:36:02] in the New Testament Prophet Paul who
[1:36:04] meant the same thing in the church spoke
[1:36:06] this
[1:36:07] this is I not the Lord that's in
[1:36:09] Corinthians 7th chapter
[1:36:12] that right because of the divorce
[1:36:14] situation it wasn't so from the
[1:36:16] beginning but Moses was permitted it and
[1:36:18] God counted it right recognize it
[1:36:20] righteousness Paul had a riot when he
[1:36:22] found his church in that condition
[1:36:24] you believe this to be true and believe
[1:36:26] it to come from God and by the
[1:36:28] Vindication of his father and his
[1:36:29] message that's brought me this far
[1:36:32] should not upon the mountain
[1:36:34] permit me to do
[1:36:37] the same time
[1:36:39] to suffer you to go on the Way You Are
[1:36:42] and do it no more know your wives and
[1:36:44] live in peace
[1:36:46] or the hours late the coming of the Lord
[1:36:48] is at hand we haven't got time to break
[1:36:50] these things up don't you dare try to do
[1:36:52] it again I'm speaking only to my
[1:36:54] congregation but if you are married and
[1:36:57] God bear me witness of that on the
[1:36:59] mountain that I could say this and watch
[1:37:02] you go ahead and run it up
[1:37:05] a supernatural Revelation because
[1:37:09] of the opening of The Seven Seals
[1:37:13] and this is a question in God's word
[1:37:18] not a question what are God's word is
[1:37:20] right or not
[1:37:22] they question God
[1:37:25] there's no question whether God's word
[1:37:27] is right it's God's word
[1:37:29] they question God
[1:37:33] let them go on in as they are and sin no
[1:37:36] more
[1:37:38] now let them go on
[1:37:42] in as they are
[1:37:51] so he said we can't straighten this out
[1:37:53] it's ideas and do that and work this out
[1:37:56] we don't have time
[1:37:59] let them go on as as they are
[1:38:03] God went there with three wives what'd
[1:38:05] he go home with
[1:38:06] one
[1:38:09] the world says three
[1:38:13] that doesn't mean going as they are so
[1:38:15] we had three going down he took three
[1:38:17] back home
[1:38:19] won't be dumb
[1:38:23] he went there with three come home and
[1:38:25] one woman went there with three husbands
[1:38:26] came home with one husband
[1:38:30] now we'll get into
[1:38:32] invisible Union
[1:38:34] uh if God let that do that way then why
[1:38:36] are we playing around slopping and
[1:38:38] kissing on the old boy if he's supposed
[1:38:39] to be dead
[1:38:41] now remember what we covered this
[1:38:43] morning
[1:38:45] only her father could disallow
[1:38:48] or her husband which would be head right
[1:38:51] headship can disallow
[1:38:56] right
[1:38:58] well you better see what God done
[1:39:03] he disallowed all of those vows that was
[1:39:06] made if we can really believe it
[1:39:12] we don't believe it won't do us no good
[1:39:17] now not to just keep on doing it oh now
[1:39:19] that's uh don't play games with God
[1:39:25] the
[1:39:27] just be truthful
[1:39:31] don't try to go back
[1:39:33] because you can't straighten up things
[1:39:38] you just go in his yard and forget it
[1:39:42] he said you know what brother Dale I've
[1:39:43] done this and done that after marriage
[1:39:44] now that's between you and the Lord
[1:39:46] I mean after I heard the message that's
[1:39:48] between you and the Lord I don't have no
[1:39:49] Grace to be give to nobody
[1:39:51] but I will say a lot about it through
[1:39:53] the message of Grace
[1:39:56] if we can really believe it
[1:40:01] you know the Bible says that a woman is
[1:40:03] in uh flashing red lights if it's coming
[1:40:07] the Bible says if a woman lives in
[1:40:09] pleasure
[1:40:10] she's dead
[1:40:14] we'll get into invisible Union if you'll
[1:40:16] read it correctly you'll see that God
[1:40:18] let your old husband die
[1:40:22] now if that's a higher order
[1:40:24] what happened when he went there to
[1:40:26] marriage and divorce
[1:40:28] all the records of the world he had
[1:40:30] three wives right or three husbands
[1:40:33] but in God's record they went home with
[1:40:35] one if they believed it
[1:40:39] if it's revealed
[1:40:43] so where we're going with it
[1:40:47] what can you do about it
[1:40:51] I've had people to tell me what you need
[1:40:53] to do is command them people to live
[1:40:55] single the rest of their life
[1:40:58] you know
[1:40:59] well if you'll show me where that works
[1:41:01] it out I'll preach it that way
[1:41:05] you know you can show me that's where it
[1:41:07] was I'll preach it that way
[1:41:09] but you can't do it
[1:41:13] so why don't we believe in grace not
[1:41:16] disgrace
[1:41:19] why don't we believe in grace
[1:41:22] if you can believe enough for that old
[1:41:24] denominational husband to die if you can
[1:41:26] believe enough for that old
[1:41:28] um devil to die that was in your soul
[1:41:32] Why Stop Believing
[1:41:35] because it's left up to you
[1:41:40] it's not whether or not I say it
[1:41:44] we have a lot of people come to this
[1:41:46] church that's had marital problems in
[1:41:47] their lives
[1:41:48] I'm never condemned to one of you you
[1:41:50] think I do from the pulpit talking like
[1:41:52] I do but I never have
[1:41:55] don't condemn nobody
[1:41:59] just try to get you to see God
[1:42:03] pray to God for Grace
[1:42:07] because I can't answer the questions
[1:42:09] brother you think I'm all right
[1:42:12] won't you stay you said well what do you
[1:42:14] think about it
[1:42:16] it's not up to me amen
[1:42:20] it's up to you right I mean all right
[1:42:23] let's read another another tune and
[1:42:25] we'll try to quit
[1:42:31] now I love this one because of the way
[1:42:32] he States it this is paragraph 314 of
[1:42:36] marriage and divorce it wasn't so from
[1:42:38] the beginning
[1:42:39] and it's right it wasn't so and it will
[1:42:41] not be at the end
[1:42:45] but under modern conditions as God's
[1:42:48] servant I won't call myself his Prophet
[1:42:50] but I believe maybe if I wouldn't be
[1:42:52] sent for that I'm laying a ground for
[1:42:55] him when he does come so under modern
[1:42:57] conditions look I command you to go home
[1:43:00] with your wife now
[1:43:03] you'll notice in a moment ago you could
[1:43:05] argue over what he was saying because he
[1:43:07] said you're going with your wives
[1:43:09] plural now he makes it straight lined up
[1:43:12] he's not saying it's okay
[1:43:14] said you're if you're happy with her
[1:43:16] live with her raise your children and
[1:43:18] well I'm not happy with her
[1:43:21] we'll go live by yourself
[1:43:25] maybe you're happy
[1:43:27] right
[1:43:28] I doubt it
[1:43:30] I've seen some people so sad I don't
[1:43:31] believe that they could be happy if they
[1:43:33] live by themselves on a desert island
[1:43:38] everything's wrong
[1:43:40] like I said you give somebody a million
[1:43:41] dollars
[1:43:44] now I gotta go pay the taxes on it
[1:43:48] you'll never win
[1:43:50] if you're happy with her live with her
[1:43:52] raise your children in the admonition of
[1:43:54] God
[1:43:55] but God be merciful to you if you ever
[1:43:57] do that again you teach your children to
[1:43:59] never do a thing like that bring them up
[1:44:01] in the admonition of God go ahead let's
[1:44:03] continue reading
[1:44:05] let's see that's 3 14.
[1:44:07] we got a few more
[1:44:10] we'll go up to 316.
[1:44:13] this is continual reading not the same
[1:44:16] great Jehovah now watch what he
[1:44:20] that suffered Moses that
[1:44:23] Moses that serpent servant
[1:44:26] that would
[1:44:27] he would tell his people and God you
[1:44:30] suffered him to give a writing a
[1:44:31] divorcement all the great apostles who
[1:44:33] was the writer of the New Testament as
[1:44:35] Moses was of the old Moses wrote the
[1:44:37] laws and the dispensation of the laws
[1:44:39] many of the prophets their words were
[1:44:41] rejected into it but Moses wrote the
[1:44:43] laws and you suffered him in writing to
[1:44:45] write them a writing of divorcement
[1:44:47] because of the hardness of their heart
[1:44:49] the great Saint Paul being the writer of
[1:44:51] the New Testament could also make such
[1:44:54] an assertion that I speak unto I speak
[1:44:57] under these conditions I am not the Lord
[1:45:00] going to the next
[1:45:03] number eight
[1:45:06] join us today Lord God at the end of the
[1:45:09] world as we are here under the mercy of
[1:45:11] God knowing that soon we are to answer
[1:45:13] in his presence and as you have did so
[1:45:16] much Lord I am sure in the sight of
[1:45:19] these people they'll hang on to this
[1:45:21] it like it come from you
[1:45:24] and by record here today of many people
[1:45:27] sitting here that even saw that sign up
[1:45:29] in the mountain
[1:45:30] where the angels of the Lord came in the
[1:45:33] Whirlwind where he came into seven
[1:45:35] angels
[1:45:37] for the revealing of the mystery seven
[1:45:39] Mysteries was unfolded that same angel
[1:45:42] in the same direction on the same
[1:45:45] Mountain
[1:45:46] the day that this was revealed
[1:45:50] that's two entirely mountains but he's
[1:45:51] not saying it's
[1:45:55] it was revealed on Sunset mountain in
[1:45:57] the seals right
[1:46:00] God I pray that the people will go home
[1:46:03] being thankful that God has granted this
[1:46:05] grace to them I only spoke at Lord
[1:46:07] Trooper Mission and only say it through
[1:46:09] permission Lord and let the people be so
[1:46:11] grateful that they'll never try to do
[1:46:13] this sin again and and may they never
[1:46:16] try to do any sin but love you with all
[1:46:18] their hearts Lord with their families
[1:46:20] happy and Lord make these families happy
[1:46:23] and may they grow and raise their
[1:46:25] children in the admonition of God

[1:47:10] us since the founder since the beginning

[1:47:51] him for his grace I love him for his
[1:47:53] Mercy I love him for his word and the
[1:47:55] word of the Lord came
[1:47:57] to the prophets
[1:47:59] so do we believe what the prophet is
[1:48:01] saying
[1:48:03] you said well brother I I've got
[1:48:05] problems how can I correct them
[1:48:09] there's never been but one way of
[1:48:10] correcting any problem
[1:48:13] number one
[1:48:16] this is Brother Dale okay
[1:48:19] we read what he said this is me
[1:48:21] how do you correct anything number one
[1:48:25] number one
[1:48:27] admit you got it
[1:48:31] that's the first basis
[1:48:34] all you honey Glory beverages prop
[1:48:36] everything up you know you can't tell me
[1:48:39] well ain't nobody gonna try to
[1:48:43] I know what I believe
[1:48:47] okay
[1:48:51] if it's right you're right
[1:48:54] but where's all you screaming and
[1:48:55] hollering going to impress anybody
[1:49:00] it ain't gonna do nobody any good to
[1:49:02] watch on judgment to scream and holler
[1:49:03] at God and say look what I've done
[1:49:11] and I'm going to say this because we're
[1:49:13] going to end the individual reunion
[1:49:15] see I've told you what I believe it's
[1:49:17] brother Dale
[1:49:19] I believe those that are
[1:49:21] that are the twinkle of an eye
[1:49:23] now you understand I didn't say nobody
[1:49:26] about nobody going into Rapture not even
[1:49:29] talking about none of it I'm talking
[1:49:30] about change in the moment of twinkling
[1:49:32] of an eye
[1:49:34] when this Mortal shall put on
[1:49:36] immortality
[1:49:37] the dead is already raised so we're not
[1:49:39] talking about it
[1:49:41] that Bible didn't Christ your eyes first
[1:49:43] we wish our lives and reminders be
[1:49:44] changed
[1:49:46] and I believe those that come to that
[1:49:48] change
[1:49:50] is going to be standing there
[1:49:52] free
[1:49:54] from all things
[1:49:59] because they believe God
[1:50:02] how did you get the new birth
[1:50:04] well I just happened to be so good he
[1:50:06] gave it to me
[1:50:12] he gave it to you because you believed
[1:50:14] him
[1:50:15] and you know we don't have to play with
[1:50:18] God
[1:50:18] you know why a lot of people don't get
[1:50:20] the Holy Ghost
[1:50:26] because they don't believe him sure
[1:50:30] I said this brother Dale talking okay
[1:50:35] you know you can't get the Holy Ghost if
[1:50:37] you don't believe God
[1:50:40] but you can say oh you want to about
[1:50:42] believing
[1:50:43] if it's really not down within your
[1:50:45] heart come on Amen you're only in the
[1:50:47] head knowledge right
[1:50:49] see
[1:50:51] and you know that God knows whether or
[1:50:53] not you really believe that's right
[1:50:56] so the Bible's right
[1:50:59] he said well we know that but the Bible
[1:51:01] said he gave the Holy Ghost to them what
[1:51:04] that believe
[1:51:09] well you know why don't give it to a lot
[1:51:10] of people they don't play
[1:51:12] if they're screaming hot hollering they
[1:51:14] all
[1:51:16] when somebody
[1:51:18] how much they believe you know for
[1:51:20] certain they don't believe a whole lot
[1:51:26] when I'm in this Pulpit I preach hard
[1:51:28] and straight
[1:51:30] but you've been with me I don't go out
[1:51:32] there and try to make everybody believe
[1:51:33] what I believe
[1:51:38] I don't try to make my family believe
[1:51:40] what I believe I don't want to make my
[1:51:42] wife believe what I believe I want her
[1:51:44] to have her own experience
[1:51:46] with God
[1:51:48] see that way you're not built on a man
[1:51:51] you built on God's word
[1:51:55] I want to see people saved not just stay
[1:51:58] head saved you know to where you think
[1:52:00] you're saved
[1:52:04] but those who walk off of this Earth in
[1:52:06] the change part
[1:52:08] are not going to be
[1:52:10] all messed up
[1:52:15] I don't believe when we go out here
[1:52:16] we're going to have limbs missing to you
[1:52:18] you know
[1:52:19] I mean you come up to the change you got
[1:52:21] an arm missing you got to go to heaven
[1:52:23] to get the arm
[1:52:24] I don't think so
[1:52:27] and I don't think that we're going to go
[1:52:29] out of here
[1:52:31] messed up in our doctrines
[1:52:35] and believing and I'll just be honest I
[1:52:38] don't mind saying it
[1:52:39] we're not going to believe false
[1:52:41] doctrines
[1:52:42] and be changed among the twinkle of an
[1:52:44] eye I didn't say we wouldn't go to
[1:52:46] heaven I've never said that about nobody
[1:52:47] I stood here 40 years ago
[1:52:51] it's on tape I don't have to back up
[1:52:53] maybe 30 35 might not be 40 if it's
[1:52:56] close to 40. and I said there's going to
[1:52:59] be a lot of people that believe this
[1:53:00] message is going to die and go by the
[1:53:01] grave
[1:53:03] before the change comes because it won't
[1:53:05] be able to make it to the change and I
[1:53:06] said I may be one of them
[1:53:09] and if I die today just write it down
[1:53:11] and say well it just wasn't one of us
[1:53:12] it's going to make it to the change but
[1:53:13] he sure did scream and holler enough
[1:53:14] trying to get us to it you know we will
[1:53:17] give him honor for that
[1:53:21] you see I saw it then
[1:53:26] and I said it and I believe it
[1:53:28] a lot of people will never be able to
[1:53:30] make the change because they can't put
[1:53:31] everything they got up on this message
[1:53:37] they can't put everything they got upon
[1:53:38] whether or not this was God's profit
[1:53:40] they can't put everything on whether or
[1:53:42] not this is God's word
[1:53:47] they just put just enough to be able to
[1:53:49] hold on you know
[1:53:50] and just in case now
[1:53:53] they just don't work I got a little
[1:53:56] something special over here left over
[1:54:00] I got my name in gold in a Baptist
[1:54:02] Church
[1:54:08] I asked her a while back it was still
[1:54:10] there the preacher told me yes because
[1:54:12] he's a friend of ours
[1:54:15] because they got a tree showing all the
[1:54:17] deacons that was ever in that church and
[1:54:19] they got a tree showing all of the
[1:54:20] preachers were they were in that church
[1:54:24] it's just kind of funny there's more
[1:54:25] preachers now are deacons you know but
[1:54:28] because I was there when the preacher
[1:54:29] lasted three months
[1:54:32] got run off by the deacons but still my
[1:54:35] name is darn gold
[1:54:37] we went back here a while back the last
[1:54:40] about a year or so ago and Zach wherever
[1:54:41] he's at he's buddy of his was
[1:54:45] preaching his first sermon we went back
[1:54:47] to the whole family went to the Baptist
[1:54:49] Church
[1:54:50] you're this boy preach
[1:54:53] well I don't think I'm gonna die and go
[1:54:55] to hell for the Hat
[1:55:00] but you know what
[1:55:01] I sat there and looked around and I
[1:55:03] thought Lord
[1:55:05] when I left here that women wouldn't cut
[1:55:07] in their higher they did trim it but not
[1:55:09] you know bald-headed something
[1:55:12] and there was no women who would ever
[1:55:13] come to church wearing a pair of pants
[1:55:14] or nothing
[1:55:16] we left there in 1960
[1:55:19] eight
[1:55:21] 67 excuse me
[1:55:24] the women didn't come to dress like that
[1:55:26] but when we walked in there they was
[1:55:28] just everybody was just yeah you know
[1:55:30] pants and things and all
[1:55:33] and I thought Lord look where I'd be if
[1:55:36] I'd stayed here
[1:55:41] I thank God every day what he's done for
[1:55:43] me
[1:55:45] I thank him every day for saving me
[1:55:48] I'll clap my own games today
[1:55:52] for saving me
[1:55:55] you said well brother Dale you was a
[1:55:57] good guy that's what Paul said he said
[1:55:59] I'm chiefest of sinners
[1:56:01] why
[1:56:03] he lived a perfect life
[1:56:06] he was falling after God's word and he
[1:56:08] said he's the chiefest of sinners
[1:56:10] now what do you mean
[1:56:12] he meant he was the closest around the
[1:56:14] truth but yet so far off until he was
[1:56:18] missing it
[1:56:22] you said well I have a problem brother
[1:56:23] Dale I need straightening out about this
[1:56:25] out of the other
[1:56:27] how can you straighten out a lot of
[1:56:29] things
[1:56:35] how can you straighten them out
[1:56:41] why don't we believe in grace
[1:56:44] and pray and cry the rest of our life
[1:56:48] for God
[1:56:51] to come down and
[1:56:53] make it right
[1:56:56] he's the only one that can ever make it
[1:56:58] right
[1:57:03] a lot of things in the Bible you can't
[1:57:04] explain
[1:57:08] David had 700 wives
[1:57:16] God never thought it Worthy
[1:57:19] to use any of them
[1:57:22] to bring forth the lineage
[1:57:25] that would bring Solomon into the world
[1:57:31] and he took Bathsheba
[1:57:33] and her husband killed
[1:57:36] think about it
[1:57:38] and out of there came Solomon amen
[1:57:42] the greatest of all the kings had ever
[1:57:44] been
[1:57:46] out of there came Jesse and et cetera et
[1:57:49] cetera coming down to David
[1:57:51] was aligned back there from who
[1:57:54] Rahab
[1:57:57] can you explain them things
[1:58:01] Moses married an Ethiopian
[1:58:06] a black woman
[1:58:12] did God beat him to death about it
[1:58:16] nope
[1:58:17] he got on to marry him and her and Aaron
[1:58:19] both got into trouble because of making
[1:58:21] fun of it
[1:58:26] don't tell no stones at anybody in their
[1:58:27] marital situation I just make it plain
[1:58:30] what we believe
[1:58:35] he just what we believe straight and
[1:58:37] that's plain
[1:58:42] but what about it folks
[1:58:45] have we got our whole heart and our
[1:58:47] whole life and everything based upon
[1:58:49] this message
[1:58:55] can I ask you another question
[1:59:01] why will not people come to someone who
[1:59:04] has truth
[1:59:06] seek truth
[1:59:11] and truth that can even bring Grace into
[1:59:13] being
[1:59:15] to not condemn us
[1:59:19] now you know
[1:59:21] what I'm saying
[1:59:24] you've been there you've been condemned
[1:59:26] you've been beat on for being what you
[1:59:27] are
[1:59:29] and never beat on you for being what you
[1:59:31] are
[1:59:32] I'm beating on you and me both for
[1:59:33] staying what we are
[1:59:38] because we do something about it
[1:59:42] we got a God that can make a way
[1:59:47] we got a God that can make right wrong I
[1:59:50] mean wrong's right and straighten up
[1:59:52] things
[1:59:56] but we run around screaming and
[1:59:58] hollering hunting for something then
[1:59:59] we'll never find it
[2:00:02] your brother whippy had a point
[2:00:04] he said if you want the stuff you got to
[2:00:07] go or to somebody's got the stuff to be
[2:00:10] able to get it
[2:00:11] his point was if you want the truth you
[2:00:14] got to try to find it somewhere
[2:00:16] stand with it
[2:00:20] because that's our only hopes
[2:00:22] is the truth of God
[2:00:25] are you trying to bind us to you brother
[2:00:27] Dale no go see if you want to leave
[2:00:30] that's good because I'm not against
[2:00:32] anybody don't want nobody to leave but
[2:00:33] I'm just honest because if you want to
[2:00:36] leave then that means me and you are
[2:00:38] hindering each other
[2:00:40] right right that means you're a problem
[2:00:43] to me and I'm a problem to you
[2:00:49] I want everybody straight and right
[2:00:56] but this word has to be right
[2:00:58] not true
[2:01:01] let's damn
[2:01:04] Aaron gets the opportunity today to be
[2:01:06] the one who serves a communion to us
[2:01:10] he can pick whoever he desires with him
[2:01:13] because he did the other day and
[2:01:17] Terrence he he had to pick one day to
[2:01:20] get somebody to help him and he got Zach
[2:01:24] people probably wonder you mean a little
[2:01:26] boy helping served communion with why
[2:01:28] not
[2:01:30] what's the problem why not good morning
[2:01:33] why not
[2:01:37] if you're born again Christian you gotta
[2:01:39] have a ride come on brother and I hope
[2:01:41] you enjoyed the message amen and
[2:01:43] questions and answers
[2:01:45] I love them
[2:01:47] you got a question write it down this is
[2:01:50] my problem right here what can be done
[2:01:52] about it and if I can't do know how to
[2:01:54] say I don't know
[2:01:56] that's no problem and no problem saying
[2:01:59] that
[2:02:01] which is like I said through the series
[2:02:03] a lot of ministers
[2:02:05] a lot of preachers are free but they
[2:02:09] don't know the scriptures
[2:02:12] to be able to set them free
[2:02:17] but yet they got a mental Concept in
[2:02:19] their mind of what freedom is
[2:02:22] until you want
[2:02:23] if I can I want to go with this when I
[2:02:26] go up you know the word of God I want it
[2:02:29] in front of me because it's what's been
[2:02:30] in front of me all these 50 years
[2:02:34] when the old brother came to me and I
[2:02:36] left the Baptist Church and he came and
[2:02:38] he said
[2:02:39] oh Sam's it's all right I know about
[2:02:42] this man William Branham and I don't say
[2:02:45] a word about him I said well thank you
[2:02:46] very much
[2:02:47] because he was about 80 years old or
[2:02:49] something he said but you'll be back in
[2:02:52] about six months
[2:02:55] well you know what I think about
[2:02:58] I think about her in the Bible where
[2:02:59] they said you know
[2:03:02] he's going and the old Prophet come up
[2:03:04] to our
[2:03:05] I'm not gonna say we ain't going in
[2:03:07] bondage but we'll be back in about a
[2:03:10] year
[2:03:12] they didn't make it in a year
[2:03:15] well I made it back to the church yet
[2:03:18] you know so I just believe it's true
[2:03:21] don't you thank God for the truth
[2:03:25] thank God for the prophets
[2:03:28] it's one of the prophets that's what he
[2:03:30] said and the word of the Lord came unto
[2:03:33] the prophets
[2:03:35] so we're dependent upon everything these
[2:03:37] prophets had to say
[2:03:40] to our lives
[2:03:44] amen
[2:03:49] just thank the Lord for Grace amen amen
[2:03:55] reading from First Corinthians
[2:03:57] chapter 11 starting with verse 23.
[2:04:03] as for I have received of the Lord that
[2:04:05] which also I delivered unto you
[2:04:08] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[2:04:10] which he was betrayed took bread
[2:04:12] and we had given thanks he break it and
[2:04:14] said takey this is my body which is
[2:04:16] broken for you this do in remembrance of
[2:04:19] me after the same manner also he took
[2:04:21] the cup
[2:04:22] when he had sup saying this is this cup
[2:04:25] is the New Testament in my blood
[2:04:28] this do ye as often as you drink it in
[2:04:31] remembrance of me for as often as you
[2:04:34] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[2:04:36] show the Lord's death until he come
[2:04:38] wherefore whosoever shall eat of this
[2:04:40] bread and drink of this cup of the Lord
[2:04:42] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[2:04:45] and blood of the Lord
[2:04:46] but let a man examine himself and so let
[2:04:48] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[2:04:50] cup
[2:04:51] for he that eateth and drinketh
[2:04:53] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[2:04:54] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[2:04:57] body
[2:04:58] for this calls many are sick
[2:05:01] for many are weak
[2:05:03] and sickly among you in many sleep
[2:05:12] for if we should judge ourselves
[2:05:16] we should not be judged
[2:05:18] but when we are judged we're chasing to
[2:05:20] the Lord we should not be condemned with
[2:05:22] the world
[2:05:25] wherefore my brethren when you come
[2:05:27] together to eat Terry one for another
[2:05:29] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[2:05:31] home that you come not together into
[2:05:34] condemnation and the rest well I said in
[2:05:36] order when I come
[2:05:41] I knew I was going to have a hard time
[2:05:43] with this today
[2:05:46] y'all just pray for me but
[2:05:49] I thank God for his grace
[2:05:57] you know brother Brown
[2:05:58] he says in this life you'll never be
[2:06:00] worthy
[2:06:02] he said he makes you worthy amen
[2:06:05] you can't make yourself worthy for
[2:06:07] communion
[2:06:09] yeah I've heard people say that
[2:06:11] you know they they don't want to take
[2:06:13] communion and some Churches don't even
[2:06:15] take communion
[2:06:17] they don't even believe in doing foot
[2:06:18] washing
[2:06:21] but you know the scripture says if a man
[2:06:22] examined himself
[2:06:25] and he won't be chasing you know
[2:06:28] it won't be condemned with world
[2:06:31] and be chastened of the Lord
[2:06:33] but he says if a man examined himself
[2:06:36] then let him eat meat of that bread and
[2:06:37] drink of that cup
[2:06:40] I'm so glad as we heard today there's a
[2:06:42] Grace God has given us Grace in our
[2:06:45] lives
[2:06:46] to bring us to this opportunity that we
[2:06:48] can
[2:06:49] partake
[2:06:51] representing what God has done for us
[2:06:55] the scripture says that we tarry one for
[2:06:57] another so just gonna have a moment of
[2:06:59] Silent prayer
[2:07:01] and we said you pray for each other I
[2:07:04] pray for you
[2:07:06] remember the
[2:07:07] always come to this time and
[2:07:10] I always remember that
[2:07:12] as many sick among us
[2:07:14] but you know as many been healed taking
[2:07:16] communion
[2:07:21] and you know this is a it's a
[2:07:24] a time to
[2:07:29] judge ourselves

[2:07:39] would have us to be be right with you so

[2:16:54] of Judas Iscariot Simon's son to betray
[2:16:57] him
[2:16:58] Jesus knowing that the father had given

[2:17:02] that he was come from God and went to
[2:17:04] God
