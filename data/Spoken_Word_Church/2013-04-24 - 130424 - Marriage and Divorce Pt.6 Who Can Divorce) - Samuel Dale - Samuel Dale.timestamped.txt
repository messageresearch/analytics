[6:48] lord into their hands and we have
[6:51] nothing to do with that we just

[7:11] and just bless the family and take care
[7:13] of everybody
[7:14] we love you and we thank you in jesus
[7:16] name amen
[7:21] matthew 19 the pharisees came unto him
[7:25] tempting him and saying unto him is it
[7:28] lawful for a man to put away his wife
[7:30] forever cause he answered and said unto
[7:32] them have you not read that he which
[7:34] made them at the beginning
[7:36] made them male and female and said for
[7:38] this cause shall a man leave his father
[7:40] and mother
[7:42] and shall cleave to his wife and they
[7:44] twain shall be one flesh
[7:46] wherefore there are no more twain but
[7:48] one flesh
[7:49] what therefore god hath joined together
[7:51] let no
[7:52] not man put asunder and they say unto
[7:55] him
[7:56] why did moses then command to give a
[7:59] writing a divorcement
[8:00] and to put her away he saith unto them
[8:02] moses because of the hardness of your
[8:04] hearts
[8:06] suffered you to put away your wives but
[8:07] from the beginning it was not so
[8:10] and i say unto you whosoever shall put
[8:13] away his wife except
[8:14] it be for fornication and shall marry
[8:17] another committeth adultery and whoso
[8:19] marrieth her which is put away
[8:21] doth commit adultery you may be seated
[8:24] the lord had his
[8:25] blessing to the reading of the word
[8:29] you know now
[8:33] my wife told me the other day and some
[8:35] of the others just said i
[8:36] i used the word sunday that was not a
[8:39] correct word
[8:41] and i just hope that you were listening
[8:44] to the rest of the message as well as
[8:46] you heard the one word i used
[8:48] and you know that always seems to be the
[8:51] way it is though everybody here is the
[8:53] one you
[8:54] goof up on and i used a 50
[8:57] 60 or something version of a word
[9:00] and you know everybody kind of
[9:03] thinks that it's a bad word but webster
[9:06] says it's a
[9:07] female dog or he says
[9:10] it's a a lewd woman
[9:14] so now either way you know the word is
[9:16] dire but i shouldn't have used it
[9:18] and it was just one of those slips like
[9:20] i said it's a 50 or 60 word that we talk
[9:23] about that
[9:23] doesn't mean a bad thing but to
[9:26] everybody coming up today you know there
[9:29] they want you to make sure you don't use
[9:31] some of those words
[9:33] and uh oh you know and josiah got on to
[9:35] me one time for
[9:36] for using the word years ago it wasn't
[9:38] too awfully bad but
[9:40] i was using the word stupid or something
[9:42] like that and
[9:43] but i've tried to get away from using
[9:45] that so i'll try to get away from using
[9:47] the slang for the female dog you know
[9:50] and
[9:51] do the best that i can forgive me but
[9:54] just count it to
[9:56] the fact of being old age you know
[10:00] and that way you do have an excuse
[10:03] ronald reagan said it he was your
[10:06] president
[10:07] he couldn't remember so he he could say
[10:11] things and he couldn't remember
[10:12] you know that's uh but that's all right
[10:16] lord help us all right all right now
[10:19] we're
[10:19] into the topic of what we're doing on
[10:22] marriage and divorce
[10:23] and uh i'm sorry in this that i have to
[10:26] use a lot of words that
[10:28] you know are not uh common ordinary
[10:32] words to be used in a
[10:34] in a minister you know a minister to be
[10:36] speaking of of
[10:37] adultery fornication polygamies and all
[10:40] like that but
[10:41] yet you couldn't preach the bible if you
[10:43] didn't use those words
[10:45] because it would put you into a bad
[10:47] situation
[10:49] to try to stomp around it you know and
[10:50] do it but
[10:52] you know the lord give us grace and help
[10:54] us to understand
[10:56] now brother branham
[11:00] we want to start off with the point of
[11:02] where we left off if we can
[11:04] uh on marriage and divorce
[11:07] that because of the fall
[11:11] you know jesus said from the beginning
[11:13] it was not soul
[11:14] and brother brown said it won't be so
[11:16] over there
[11:17] all right but he said under this present
[11:19] condition of where it's at
[11:22] all right now i i've i want to
[11:26] if i could use that word i used sunday
[11:29] which was a very small word
[11:31] but if i could do that and make you
[11:32] remember the things that i'm saying i'd
[11:34] be glad to say it over again
[11:37] all right but
[11:40] i want you to remember one thing
[11:44] we are not playing with this message not
[11:47] playing with the scriptures and the
[11:49] things
[11:50] and that's what we want to deal with
[11:51] tonight on a hard basis
[11:53] if we have to to try to
[11:56] make sure you understand because
[12:00] you know jesus said if a man puts away
[12:03] his wife for any other reason
[12:05] than fornication he's going to cause her
[12:08] to commit adultery why because she's
[12:09] going to get married
[12:11] anybody that marries her is going to
[12:13] commit adultery all right now
[12:15] i didn't say that jesus did and then
[12:18] we'll get on to to some points in a
[12:20] moment of it
[12:22] but brother branham said i want to use
[12:24] this first and then we'll get into our
[12:25] thought
[12:27] so go ahead and pull up the first one
[12:28] brother uh if some of you are using just
[12:31] a single quote form it'll be
[12:33] this like but it's paragraph 66
[12:36] of marriage and divorce preaching 1965
[12:40] 021 to morning service now if that be so
[12:43] we have two schools of thought on
[12:45] marriage and divorce
[12:47] and that is one of them says that now
[12:50] that's one of them a man
[12:52] can only be married once unless his wife
[12:56] is dead
[12:58] now that's number one and that's one of
[13:00] the questions
[13:01] when you go to following that you go
[13:04] overboard
[13:06] so you miss it all right so that would
[13:09] have to be wrong
[13:10] to go on that line see and then the next
[13:14] says
[13:14] number two said oh if the wife or the
[13:18] husband either one has committed
[13:20] adultery either one of them can be put
[13:22] away and married again
[13:24] and you find yourself overboard with
[13:26] that so now that's the two schools of
[13:29] thought and he says you go overboard on
[13:32] either way
[13:34] all right so then you know i want people
[13:38] to understand me one thing
[13:40] tonight maybe especially the hard way of
[13:42] stating it
[13:44] that people say well the man can do this
[13:46] and a man can do that
[13:48] now i want the grounds for the man to be
[13:50] able to
[13:54] now jesus said from the beginning it
[13:55] wasn't so
[13:59] now we're going to have to go in it and
[14:01] find out it's not
[14:02] whether she burns the bread or don't
[14:04] smell good or whatever
[14:07] you got to have a scriptural grounds if
[14:09] you're going to put your wife away
[14:12] and according to the bible it can only
[14:13] be for fornication that's right
[14:20] you know if you're going to put her away
[14:21] and try to marry again
[14:23] now we get down into it after a while
[14:25] the prophet says you put your wife away
[14:26] for cutting her heart
[14:30] he said you can't marry again for that
[14:33] reason
[14:34] so you can put your wife away for some
[14:36] reason that's right
[14:37] but what is the reason you're putting
[14:39] her away for right
[14:41] if there's anything outside of the
[14:43] scriptural
[14:45] dealings then
[14:48] look what you've created a bad situation
[14:52] but just think about that now because
[14:54] that you know that's
[14:56] that's the way we should think and be
[14:58] serious about it
[15:00] you say well and i've said it too and
[15:02] i'll say it over and over
[15:04] this is not to to be married twice or
[15:07] three times or what
[15:09] is not the bless not the point of
[15:12] blaspheming the holy ghost
[15:16] it's not going to keep you out of heaven
[15:20] it may determine the way of getting
[15:22] there
[15:23] because i've made my own self point
[15:25] blank from the very beginning
[15:27] that if we have a marital situation that
[15:30] we cannot deal with
[15:31] in this life some way
[15:35] then we will not be able to be there i
[15:38] believe at the change in the moment
[15:40] between club and i
[15:41] that's right that's that's me that's
[15:44] brother daley that's not brother branham
[15:46] there's not a quote for that that's just
[15:48] how strong i stand on it
[15:50] and i don't stand on the ground or
[15:52] somebody coming along said well me and
[15:54] my wife divorced because
[15:55] you know she just she just was you know
[15:59] she she wasn't under subjection that's
[16:01] what they do in the message
[16:03] you know she wasn't under subjection to
[16:04] me but what does that mean you know
[16:08] what are you talking about if you can't
[16:10] bring up something that will deal with
[16:12] fornication
[16:16] then the marriage is still there
[16:19] and i'm sorry that's the way it's stated
[16:21] and that's the way it has to be
[16:23] but we've got to deal with it but we do
[16:25] have the grace of marriage and divorce
[16:27] to be able to come under that to believe
[16:29] it if we can receive it and it can only
[16:32] be done by revelation
[16:34] you remember that our sunday we kept on
[16:35] dealing with that a little it was sunday
[16:38] where the prophet said it's got to be
[16:39] revealed amen
[16:42] well i was sitting there when he
[16:44] preached it well that don't make a bit
[16:46] of difference
[16:47] if it's not revealed to you
[16:51] there was a lot of people sitting there
[16:52] when he preached a future home he said i
[16:54] count on my hand
[16:57] you know or hands maybe maybe 10 or
[17:01] something
[17:02] but you see it's got to be revealed and
[17:05] if it's not revealed
[17:08] then the situation is binding
[17:12] so then we have to deal with it up on
[17:14] our own we can't
[17:15] just uh you know say well you know my
[17:18] case is different brother random in here
[17:19] says it don't make no difference
[17:23] now we got to go with the scriptural
[17:25] points see
[17:27] all right now then let's go with it the
[17:29] way he brings it and see what we can
[17:30] come up with
[17:32] well because of the fall there was
[17:35] two covenants made one for the male
[17:40] one for the female one as the prophet
[17:42] would say for the product
[17:44] and one for the byproduct but now i
[17:47] covered it over and over and i keep
[17:49] saying it
[17:50] that is not dealing as a point those two
[17:53] covenants
[17:54] is not a covenant for the woman to have
[17:56] to be under one way to get saved
[17:58] and the man under a covenant the other
[18:00] way to get saved
[18:02] now i don't believe that he said you
[18:04] don't believe what the prophet said well
[18:06] go ahead
[18:08] you know what you listening to me farth
[18:10] is that a way
[18:11] you know i just tell you like i believe
[18:14] it
[18:15] because i've got the answer for this
[18:20] it's not something that you play pretty
[18:21] around on i've got to answer for
[18:23] for my way of doing it and i have to
[18:25] answer to you amen
[18:27] all right see there's only one salvation
[18:30] covenant
[18:32] that's through the blood of jesus christ
[18:35] all right now but then because of the
[18:38] problem of the marital situation
[18:42] that took place in the garden it puts
[18:44] the man
[18:45] under one covenant the woman under the
[18:48] other
[18:49] all right we gave it sunday where the
[18:51] man's
[18:52] covenant was what it says you'll have to
[18:56] work
[18:56] you'll have to do this you'll have to do
[18:58] that
[18:59] and the prophet said that's what it was
[19:01] covering all right but to the woman it
[19:03] says
[19:04] you'll be in childbearing and things
[19:07] like that and sorrows
[19:09] two covenants all right then it brought
[19:12] it down
[19:14] to word that being that
[19:17] it brought polygamy into being
[19:20] in the man and the animals also
[19:24] that's what i kept trying to get you to
[19:26] see that that eve
[19:27] in the garden according to spoken word
[19:31] is original seed
[19:32] the prophetess was covering it that she
[19:35] had
[19:35] intercourse of the mind first before
[19:38] that anything else could take place
[19:40] so the original serpent seed was not
[19:44] cain cain was the seed of the beast
[19:49] between the beast and eve that was the
[19:51] natural thing
[19:53] but the serpent seed goes back to the
[19:55] point of what
[19:56] if paul said i was scared that satan
[19:59] threw his septility
[20:02] all right and in doing that then we see
[20:05] that
[20:07] what he's done is accepted satan's lie
[20:10] right
[20:11] according to the word and because of
[20:13] that
[20:16] she was placed under a separate covenant
[20:22] of life now i kept trying to bring that
[20:25] out sunday
[20:26] you know wouldn't allow what to talk
[20:27] about salvation it was talking about a
[20:29] covenant of life
[20:32] you know because she was co-equal with
[20:34] him before the fall do you agree
[20:36] right that's what the prophet said
[20:38] coequal
[20:40] all right coequal means that one's just
[20:42] the same as the other
[20:43] right all right but then when she
[20:47] went over and done what she done
[20:50] it brought polygamy into the human race
[20:54] it was about genesis 4 before layman's
[20:57] took two wives
[20:59] so really it was a polygamy in the
[21:01] garden
[21:02] amen polygamy started
[21:06] about genesis 4 with laments when he
[21:09] took two wives
[21:11] for adam and eve it wasn't polygamy
[21:15] we went in sunday through those big old
[21:17] words you know that
[21:19] trying to describe what the the the word
[21:22] polygamy or
[21:23] means and how did a man
[21:26] that's married to more than one wife is
[21:29] p-o-l-y-g-n-y
[21:34] for a woman to have more than one
[21:35] husband is p-o-l-y-a-n-d-r-y
[21:39] coming from the word polygamy
[21:43] all right we tried to prove a point
[21:48] because you can't talk in bible terms of
[21:51] adam
[21:55] being wrong or david being wrong
[21:58] if we come on over
[22:03] you can't use polygamy in relationship
[22:06] to to saying that it was wrong for
[22:11] man to have more than one wife back
[22:13] there
[22:17] that that's not the wording
[22:22] but when it comes down to the point that
[22:24] you you use it that the woman having
[22:26] more than one husband
[22:28] that that ain't even considered that's
[22:31] adultery
[22:34] see because that wouldn't be called
[22:35] polygamy for the woman to have a whole
[22:38] bunch of husbands
[22:40] i know you went in the webster you go
[22:42] ahead i looked it up i gave it to you
[22:44] sunday
[22:44] it's an interchangeable form of word but
[22:47] it doesn't give them
[22:48] scriptural meaning in the scriptural
[22:50] meaning
[22:51] eve committed adultery
[22:54] right he said well no no no because
[22:57] fornication is
[22:58] and her and adam wasn't married yet yes
[23:00] they were
[23:03] your prophet called it adultery that she
[23:06] committed
[23:08] all right now then when it comes into
[23:11] polygamy
[23:12] as i ask you the question if it's not a
[23:15] spiritual condition or existence
[23:18] why did the animal come into the basis
[23:21] of polygamy
[23:24] you know what caused the animal
[23:27] to turn into that i know what caused a
[23:31] man to
[23:33] layman's wanted more than one wife
[23:40] so he got more than one wife he started
[23:42] the polygamy deal
[23:44] all right but what about the animals
[23:52] see then it had to be a spiritual
[23:53] condition by the releasing of a spirit
[23:59] you remember how i tried to bring that
[24:00] out i don't know of any other way of
[24:02] expressing it if you do i'd be glad to
[24:03] talk with you about it
[24:04] i love some other terms or something but
[24:07] it was a spirit released
[24:12] when eve done what she done it brought
[24:15] into being a
[24:17] inroad of satan and to be able to even
[24:22] penetrate the
[24:23] the uh mind capacity or whatever you'd
[24:26] call it
[24:27] of the animal race
[24:30] and it caused them to go into a polygamy
[24:33] state
[24:35] all right
[24:38] but now then in doing that see
[24:43] that is i i've got something let's see
[24:45] what i'll write down
[24:50] when it you read it in the prophet we
[24:52] read in a minute it looks like polygamy
[24:54] is a covenant
[24:57] but polygamy is the downfall
[25:00] of the covenant the
[25:03] uh attribute of the covenant
[25:10] it's not the covenant
[25:14] because it it it won't hold true all the
[25:17] way through now you can say well
[25:18] well brother brown said it in the
[25:19] well sure that's fine
[25:22] just like it uses polygamy
[25:25] and it could be either way but go
[25:27] through the bible and find where the
[25:28] polygamy in the bible means
[25:30] for the woman to have more than one
[25:31] husband
[25:34] she's commanded to not have how could
[25:36] you have the word polygamy applying to
[25:38] her then
[25:41] it's applied to the man to have more
[25:42] than one other more than one wife
[25:45] so you can't apply that's what i'm
[25:47] saying see that's why i try to make
[25:49] things
[25:49] hard but make it to where you won't
[25:53] misunderstand what i'm talking about
[25:56] and somebody out there on the internet
[25:58] sometimes you hear me say it then they
[26:00] they will well listen what he said
[26:04] no boy he well all right
[26:07] i'm hoping for anybody to come and help
[26:09] me
[26:12] but just remember don't come with silly
[26:14] little
[26:16] childish play toys of some little i've
[26:20] got a statement
[26:22] come and let's sit down and talk about
[26:24] the word
[26:27] had a theologian years ago and he was a
[26:31] greek theologian
[26:33] challenged us on the word and i accepted
[26:35] his challenge and it never came to pass
[26:40] he said i only want it on the scriptures
[26:42] i said that's exactly where we're going
[26:43] to
[26:45] with the scriptures i don't know tops
[26:48] and shadows i said well we'd have
[26:49] problems there because
[26:51] brother brandon believed in them
[26:54] but you see church if it's not in the
[26:56] scriptures what do we need
[26:59] let's eat drink and be murray go ahead
[27:01] and do what you want to
[27:03] because basically people are anyway all
[27:05] right
[27:08] but just like what i said the polygamy
[27:10] fell
[27:11] on the basis that the man could have
[27:13] more than one wife
[27:16] because she was the cause
[27:23] see she caused that to take place
[27:26] right she left her holy estate caused it
[27:29] to take place
[27:30] all right just like now i kept
[27:32] emphasizing that in the animal kingdom
[27:37] once the animal was used the beast
[27:41] to bring forth what it did then god used
[27:44] the animal for an atonement
[27:49] that's simple terminology see all right
[27:54] but then we kept emphasizing that's what
[27:56] i want to do tonight i want to keep on
[27:57] laying it down on the point
[28:00] that polygamy under that polygamy man
[28:05] could have more than one wife
[28:09] all right but now he's got to marry
[28:12] correctly
[28:14] amen
[28:17] now let me put this in we'll get back to
[28:19] it later i don't mind dropping anything
[28:20] because i'd love to
[28:22] you say a man could just marry anybody
[28:24] he can't marry just anybody
[28:28] no matter whether he's a priest
[28:31] or he's a goofball or what you want to
[28:33] call him a country boy
[28:37] he's supposed to marry a virgin he's
[28:39] commanded to marry a virgin
[28:42] right he said no no no no wait a minute
[28:45] now now
[28:46] he he could he could marry a woman
[28:48] that's her husband dead that's right
[28:51] if her husband is dead the prophet
[28:53] covers it we'll get back to it
[28:55] if her husband is dead she was a virgin
[28:58] when
[28:58] it started and that husband dies
[29:02] in god she's still a virgin that's what
[29:05] god thinks of the woman
[29:07] he's not throwing off on him so bad is
[29:09] he right
[29:10] so the the man marries he marries a
[29:14] virgin
[29:14] if she was a virgin to start with
[29:18] the only stipulation you got for the the
[29:21] preacher you get down into that but
[29:23] don't just put it to the preacher only
[29:25] that he's got a married virgin
[29:27] everybody is to marry a virgin i don't
[29:30] care who you are
[29:34] all right that's why brother branham
[29:35] said and i'll give it to you man he said
[29:37] in the
[29:38] marital situation that says if anybody's
[29:40] got any reason
[29:41] he said why did they take that out of
[29:43] the marriage vows
[29:47] if any man's got any reason why this
[29:50] should not proceed
[29:55] and we know the prophet said if you you
[29:57] women
[29:58] invisible union we have time to get back
[30:00] to it tonight don't we get it sunday
[30:03] he said if you don't tell that man
[30:06] he said as much as ten years later which
[30:08] that was just a statement right
[30:10] well now what it's been is ten minutes
[30:12] and ten to ten years and three days
[30:14] i'm okay we're not dumb right
[30:19] he's just saying that she ever tells him
[30:24] she wasn't a virgin when they started he
[30:26] has a right to divorce her
[30:28] and remarry that's an invisible union
[30:36] see so you better talk it over that's
[30:38] why when people come to me to do a
[30:39] wedding
[30:39] i said first off either one of you ever
[30:42] been married
[30:44] either one of you ever been engaged
[30:48] if you are you better cover it right now
[30:49] because i won't do the wedding
[30:52] now anything else is responsibility of
[30:54] you
[30:55] to explain to your husband or your wife
[31:00] but i have no right to proceed i don't
[31:02] believe any further
[31:03] than the questions i asked
[31:07] because it's up to the girl and the boy
[31:08] to get together and decide the rest of
[31:09] it
[31:11] all right now
[31:16] we see the man because of the polygamy
[31:18] problem
[31:19] because she caused him to be that
[31:26] you know without getting hard on it but
[31:28] just
[31:30] she brought him into the lustful
[31:32] situation
[31:35] i try to keep back away from words but i
[31:38] can't own some of it
[31:41] she produced a product that brought him
[31:43] into a lustful
[31:44] situation
[31:48] you agree with that
[31:52] so it's her fault
[31:56] she caused him to fall
[32:01] she's the one that brought it to pius so
[32:04] that way then
[32:07] we kept covering it over and over there
[32:09] is no divorce for a woman whatsoever
[32:15] she can't divorce her husband and
[32:17] remarry we'll get to it in the minute
[32:19] paul said if she does she's got to be
[32:20] reconciled remain single
[32:23] the bible's right you don't have to
[32:24] worry about what it's saying
[32:26] you just need somebody to be able to
[32:28] study a little bit
[32:31] and think things over what said
[32:36] and that way don't cross the scriptures
[32:38] right
[32:39] well i believe brother branham said so
[32:41] and so says he can but she can't
[32:45] i'll agree she can't but says he can
[32:48] now he didn't say there why that who
[32:51] could do what
[32:53] that's the way people think right
[32:57] that it didn't say cause of fornication
[33:01] or something
[33:02] he just said he can
[33:05] well if that be true then
[33:08] i i'd like for you to hand me your bible
[33:10] and we'll just rip out a few pages and
[33:12] start all over again
[33:17] you don't like that kind of language do
[33:18] you what a brother told me one time
[33:20] about the bible and i said
[33:25] he said that ought to be took out of the
[33:26] bible i said give me a bible
[33:32] i'm serious i'd have been glad to bought
[33:35] him a brand new one
[33:37] but i tore that page out of his bible
[33:40] because he said it will not be in there
[33:42] well if it will not be in there tie it
[33:44] out
[33:47] but if it's in there we need to live by
[33:48] it or at least try
[33:51] you know that's why nobody can throw
[33:53] stones at nobody when it comes to
[33:55] marriage and divorce
[33:56] that's right because come on your
[33:58] prophet said even a kiss is potential
[34:00] adultery
[34:02] now i know i shouldn't be this
[34:05] way but i am
[34:09] when he said a kiss is a potential
[34:10] adultery was he talking about the girl
[34:12] being kissed or the boy being kissed or
[34:14] who and being kids
[34:16] i took it he talked about both of them
[34:18] kissing cause it takes
[34:20] two to kiss
[34:23] i mean am i wrong
[34:26] all right you see
[34:30] you try to keep people from going off on
[34:32] the deep end
[34:33] and then i become your enemy because i
[34:34] tell you the truth
[34:38] but you try to save people i tried my
[34:39] best to save a church one time
[34:41] that was even talking about polygamy
[34:46] i mean talking about who was going home
[34:48] with who all right
[34:53] and i've done everything in the world i
[34:55] could that night in the minister's
[34:57] meeting
[34:57] to try to destroy that doctrine
[35:01] even to say and why would a man walk
[35:02] with more than one mile you got to be
[35:04] a lustful sex addict if he wants more
[35:06] than one wife
[35:09] you see you shouldn't talk that away
[35:10] well that's why not it's true
[35:15] but you know that man wouldn't speak to
[35:17] me for five years or more or eight years
[35:21] and i finally had to call him before he
[35:23] even talked to him and you know what he
[35:24] said
[35:26] his boy told him said it's brother dale
[35:30] he said brother i could hear him on the
[35:31] phone he said brother who
[35:34] he got the phone i said brother dale
[35:39] you try to save people's lives and they
[35:41] turn against you
[35:44] okay if you turn against me because
[35:46] trying to tell you the truth you come
[35:47] and show me
[35:48] where it's not the truth
[35:52] no problem i can apologize for a lot of
[35:55] things but i will not apologize for the
[35:57] word
[36:01] there's no way you say you're going to
[36:02] empty the church
[36:04] it's been empty before
[36:08] we started empty
[36:12] you see i don't want to lose nobody i
[36:14] want everybody saved
[36:17] i would to the to god i could preach to
[36:19] the entire world on marriage and divorce
[36:24] to just get them to see the truth yeah
[36:28] and then they could do something about
[36:30] it
[36:32] but now listen
[36:38] let's just start reading i know we read
[36:40] this sunday but let's read it over again
[36:42] go ahead with number one noun marriage
[36:45] and divorce paragraph 10 i mean 202 and
[36:47] 203
[36:49] 2 204 we'll drop off five of this
[36:52] quote it now you see then after the
[36:56] beginning it was
[36:57] something else was introduced now this
[36:59] is going to shock you are you tired
[37:02] then when the double covenant was made
[37:03] by man and woman through sex
[37:05] another covenant all together not
[37:07] original covenant
[37:09] but another covenant now that's
[37:11] introduced polygamy
[37:13] he didn't say the covenant was polygamy
[37:14] he said it's introduced polygamy
[37:17] because of the covenant between the man
[37:19] the covenant with the woman being two
[37:20] different covenants
[37:21] then it brings polygamy it don't bring
[37:23] polygamy for the woman it brings
[37:25] polygamy for the man
[37:30] she has no right but for one husband
[37:32] period right
[37:34] other than him being dead
[37:38] but it's not said about him
[37:42] then after the beginning polygamy was
[37:43] introduced both in man
[37:45] and in beast after the beginning to fall
[37:47] now
[37:48] god now secondarily sets a new nature
[37:50] again
[37:51] a new nature is the polygamies and the
[37:53] things and the new natures is what we
[37:55] was covering
[37:56] on the message sunday you know
[38:00] that the women's supposed to not cut
[38:02] their hair
[38:04] the random cover that remember suddenly
[38:07] but the man are supposed to they're
[38:08] supposed to cut their hair off
[38:12] he said it was related to marriage and
[38:13] divorce
[38:15] i didn't make those statements your
[38:16] prophet wouldn't have done it
[38:19] what sets a new nature again what
[38:22] by sex god created the first without sex
[38:26] do you believe that congregation says
[38:27] amen
[38:29] now it's another covenant with nature
[38:31] and he sets it in another order
[38:33] by sex second covenant one male
[38:39] many females one buck deer a whole
[38:42] hiram of does is that right one bull a
[38:45] whole herd of
[38:46] cattle cows or one rooster and a yard
[38:49] full of hens
[38:50] is that right one
[38:54] david after his own heart with 500 wives
[38:59] with a hundred children born in one year
[39:01] to him and one you know more than one
[39:02] year to him
[39:04] from different women a man after god's
[39:07] own heart
[39:13] one solomon with a thousand wives but
[39:15] notice
[39:16] it wasn't so at the beginning but now
[39:19] it's
[39:19] after the beginning the woman has done
[39:23] this
[39:24] then she just becomes what she is now
[39:28] she done it she caused it she becomes
[39:31] that point
[39:32] all right now going down to
[39:36] yeah this is paragraph 204
[39:41] really that's the way it was at the
[39:44] beginning but now
[39:45] not now in this life we live in now
[39:49] that's the way it was that was back
[39:51] there the polygamy's came into being and
[39:53] everything
[39:53] but not right now because i don't
[39:55] believe in polygamy today
[39:57] right amen
[40:00] he said well you're going to do away
[40:01] with the type of christ i'm not going to
[40:03] do away with it
[40:07] it's going to magnify it right
[40:12] notice don't fail this now take it all
[40:14] down in your hearts
[40:15] but not one of those women could even
[40:18] have one more husband
[40:20] he is the original creation not her not
[40:23] one of those women
[40:24] could have one more husband but that one
[40:27] husband could have a thousand wives
[40:29] that's thus saith the lord that's the
[40:33] bible
[40:35] okay now he goes on to explain the law
[40:40] to show you how that is ties together
[40:44] the law that was even in the land
[40:48] that the king tried to take abraham's
[40:50] wife sarah say remember because
[40:52] abraham lied said that's my sister
[40:56] remember he tried to take her god told
[40:59] him said you're a dead man
[41:01] said that's my prophet's wife
[41:04] he runs back real quick and said why did
[41:06] you fool me he said
[41:07] you know he ran around and said even in
[41:10] the
[41:11] the world it's a set thing that you
[41:15] don't fool with a man's wife right
[41:22] but you get it he said it was thus saith
[41:26] the lord
[41:28] that he could have more than one wife
[41:31] but she could never have one husband
[41:33] other than that husband be dead
[41:36] now how does he get more than one wife
[41:39] today when
[41:40] i'm just telling you i'm i'm just maybe
[41:43] too old-fashioned
[41:45] and i don't believe polygamy is right in
[41:47] the new testament
[41:50] did you understand the wording the new
[41:53] testament
[41:55] see jesus at calvary
[41:58] fulfilled the type right
[42:03] of david solomon etc
[42:08] and the bride of christ fulfills the
[42:10] type
[42:12] of david's wives and all of them you
[42:14] know
[42:15] all right so then you wouldn't have
[42:18] polygamy being legal today in the new
[42:20] testament
[42:21] but you still have the fact of the time
[42:24] that goes over that jesus christ has
[42:29] a many-membered bride
[42:34] all right that's no problem with holding
[42:36] that type over that covenant over
[42:39] because it's what that spoke of back
[42:41] there what that was why
[42:42] that it was allowed to come into being
[42:46] are you listening i didn't say cause to
[42:49] come into being
[42:50] i said allowed to come into being
[42:53] because of the fall of eve as i said a
[42:55] moment ago
[42:56] she brought the human race into the
[42:59] situation
[43:01] she brought out the lust of the of adam
[43:04] to the point that
[43:06] he lived with her and
[43:09] he's never recorded having any more
[43:10] wives or nothing
[43:13] nobody wasn't recording to a layman's
[43:14] but when he did layman's had two wives
[43:17] all right but she caused it
[43:21] so then polygamy would wind up being
[43:24] as to speak of christ
[43:28] and his church but now you show me in
[43:32] the new testament
[43:35] because that's what we're going to go
[43:36] through scriptures you show me in the
[43:38] new testament that it's legal
[43:40] today to have more than one wife
[43:44] why would you want to number one
[43:48] lust devil is what it is
[43:53] and how could a lush devil be anything
[43:55] in god to be right
[43:58] god just permitted that to happen back
[44:00] there to type christ in his church
[44:03] but we're not we're not trying to type
[44:05] today
[44:06] i thought we was his bride are we typing
[44:10] his bride
[44:11] then who's the bride right right
[44:16] it probably said your tops and your
[44:17] shadows has got to fall right
[44:20] where can you have a man in the new
[44:22] testament with more than one wife
[44:27] now i said with more than one wife at a
[44:29] time
[44:31] we'll get technical
[44:34] i've been through this before so i don't
[44:36] mind doing it
[44:37] not to be sarcastic but be truthful
[44:41] the bible says if a deacon
[44:46] desires the office or a bishop
[44:49] let him be the husband of one wife
[44:53] but it don't say that about the woman
[44:57] it says having been the wife of one
[45:02] husband
[45:04] there's a difference in it
[45:08] all right but now watch then as we get
[45:12] to it
[45:14] go ahead to number two choosing of a
[45:17] bride 1965 425 paragraph 133
[45:22] through 137.
[45:28] he's trying to show you the types in the
[45:30] shadows notice now again that's the
[45:31] natural bright
[45:32] types are spiritual wait a minute
[45:35] okay
[45:39] the word says that she has made
[45:42] she was made for man and not
[45:46] man made for her okay
[45:49] now i'm going to speak and why in a few
[45:52] minutes on the bride of christ
[45:54] but i'm trying to show you the
[45:55] background of it
[45:57] a woman was made for man and not man for
[46:00] woman
[46:01] that's the reason under the old laws
[46:05] now watch it that polygamy was legal
[46:11] why because she was made for man
[46:17] what would it be if she'd have stayed in
[46:19] that estate
[46:21] and not sinned
[46:24] you wouldn't have had polygamies in the
[46:25] things right
[46:27] right so it's her fault
[46:31] amen
[46:34] but what look at david sitting down
[46:37] there with 500 wives and the bible said
[46:39] he was a man after god's own heart with
[46:41] 500 wives and solomon with a thousand
[46:43] but not one of them women could have
[46:46] another husband
[46:48] so there's no grounds for the woman
[46:51] right number three huh
[46:59] that's paragraph 137 but
[47:03] go ahead number three i'm trying to
[47:05] short
[47:06] we have to back up our number three
[47:10] would be the 70 weeks of daniel there
[47:12] you go
[47:13] recent 1961-806 paragraph 209
[47:17] the divorce courts of america produced
[47:19] more divorces by our women than all the
[47:21] rest of the nations
[47:23] the morals in our country is lower and
[47:26] divorces than it is in france or italy
[47:28] where prostitutions on the streets so
[47:32] but they're prostitutes ours is married
[47:36] women trying to live with several men
[47:39] and several married men trying to live
[47:41] with other women
[47:42] in the nation where they had polygamy
[47:46] it's a thousand times better
[47:52] look at your prophet but don't fail to
[47:56] read the rest of it
[47:59] and yet polygamy is wrong we know
[48:03] we understand what he's doing he's a
[48:05] common human being he's a straight
[48:06] talking man
[48:08] he said in the countries where they
[48:10] practice polygamy
[48:12] he said it's better off
[48:15] why because you ain't got a bunch of
[48:17] prostitution running around
[48:22] he's not saying it's okay he's saying
[48:25] it's wrong
[48:27] but he's just telling you'd be better
[48:32] that would stop all of the men running
[48:33] around the women running around if you
[48:35] had
[48:38] polygamy tonight wasn't stopping women
[48:45] you better remember what i said the
[48:46] other day you might have thought it's
[48:49] comical but i made a good point i
[48:50] thought
[48:52] the old testament polygamy was legal for
[48:54] the man to have more than one wife
[48:57] but there's never been anywhere that the
[48:59] woman could have wanted more than one
[49:00] husband
[49:01] that's death
[49:04] so song is a problem
[49:09] you would have no problems in these
[49:11] countries where
[49:13] polygamy is legal sister
[49:16] what do they do with women that's got
[49:18] you know they got
[49:20] man's got half a dozen wives but his
[49:23] wife goes and runs off some other man
[49:24] what they do with her
[49:28] they killed her
[49:32] you don't have the problem you see what
[49:34] he's telling
[49:36] he's saying in the places where they had
[49:37] polygamy you're doing well with all of
[49:39] this adultery stuff
[49:42] but he said polygamy is wrong
[49:49] look at the next one number four which
[49:52] is the supernatural preaching
[49:54] 56 129 paragraph
[49:57] e47 speaking to someone the other day
[50:00] about polygamy
[50:01] i said the nation and a whole would be
[50:03] better off if it practiced polygamy
[50:06] okay it would
[50:09] we're the highest rate nation in the
[50:11] world with divorces
[50:13] marrying and intermarrying and marrying
[50:15] intermarrying
[50:17] because we try to make the men of the
[50:20] world
[50:22] outside coincide with christian doctrine
[50:27] now what does he mean
[50:34] our constitution was brought about by
[50:37] christian people
[50:40] and they tried to make the world line up
[50:41] to it but didn't do too good in africa
[50:43] and that's the only way i say africa
[50:45] i mean the whole continent
[50:51] they weren't having no problems with
[50:52] adultery and stuff they said polygamy is
[50:55] legal
[50:57] so we try to institute ourselves okay
[50:59] you can't put the nature of a lamb in a
[51:01] pig
[51:02] polygamy would be better off for him
[51:06] right leave him alone we can't
[51:09] run him you may not believe it but god
[51:14] will look at polygamy and excuse
[51:16] it a lot quicker than what he would
[51:20] and remember don't you say i believe in
[51:23] polygamy
[51:24] i don't now he didn't believe in
[51:27] polygamy
[51:30] why because polygamy in the new
[51:34] testament is no place to be
[51:38] but yet the places in the world where
[51:40] polygamy was run
[51:41] and run there was no adulteress and
[51:43] things like that
[51:44] because the women sure didn't go out too
[51:46] much they get killed
[51:51] right but the way it is now they can
[51:54] just do anything you want to seeing
[51:56] you know that's a good little sister you
[51:58] know
[52:02] of course in america you know like
[52:04] people in the message they say
[52:05] my wife has never been married before of
[52:08] course i know she had two kids but
[52:09] separate men but
[52:10] she was never married before
[52:15] sounds like we're still in the garden
[52:20] right sorry
[52:23] i got too good of a memory
[52:27] he said don't you say that i believe in
[52:29] polygamy because i don't
[52:31] why because there's no place in the new
[52:33] testament to place polygamy
[52:36] i want to see it in the scriptures i
[52:39] covered what i said there
[52:40] we run through the old testament
[52:43] polygamy
[52:44] as a type to be christ in the church
[52:49] we're not typing anymore we're already
[52:51] dire
[52:53] it won't be greater when we get there
[52:55] we're already fulfilling
[52:58] that there's not anything else to type
[53:01] right so then when paul deals with it he
[53:05] talks about his husband and his wife
[53:07] brother around him deals with it he
[53:08] talks about a husband and wife
[53:14] now come on
[53:18] if it wasn't that away i want you to
[53:21] explain why brother branham had to bring
[53:24] the grace of marriage and divorce
[53:28] and also why that he would say
[53:34] to people have been married before no
[53:36] take
[53:37] your wife and go home
[53:45] come on we need to get in the message
[53:47] don't we
[53:49] let's read a few scriptures let's see
[53:51] what the new testament speaks of it
[53:52] ephesians
[53:53] go ahead to number five ephesians 5
[53:57] 31-32
[54:03] for this call shall a man leave his
[54:05] father and mother
[54:06] and he shall be joined unto his wives
[54:10] oh did i read that wrong
[54:14] let him be joined unto his wife and they
[54:17] 82 of them shall be one flesh
[54:20] now that's not exactly what's up there
[54:23] before you
[54:24] and anybody on the internet listen and
[54:26] you read your bible find out that's
[54:27] brother dale trying to hang you
[54:33] it says shall be joined unto his wife
[54:36] and they too
[54:36] shall be one flesh jesus said it wasn't
[54:40] so from the beginning
[54:41] you go back to the beginning you've got
[54:42] man and woman as one flesh
[54:45] even after she was taken from him and
[54:47] put in flesh
[54:49] there's still one flesh right
[54:53] did adam say that he said she's now bone
[54:56] of my bone
[54:57] and flesh of my flesh are we in the
[54:59] scripture
[55:02] paul paul says this is a great mystery
[55:06] but i speak concerning christ in the
[55:07] church
[55:13] one man one woman right
[55:17] go ahead ii corinthians 1 or 1st
[55:20] corinthians 2.
[55:21] go ahead at number 6.
[55:25] first corinthians 7.
[55:28] now concerning the things wherever you
[55:30] wrote unto me is good for a man not to
[55:31] touch a woman
[55:33] nevertheless to afford to avoid
[55:36] fornication
[55:37] let every man have his own wife
[55:41] and let every woman have her own husband
[55:45] and that's as simple as can be first
[55:48] timothy 3
[55:49] number 7.
[55:52] first timothy 3 and 1 and 2.
[55:57] this is a true saying if a man desire
[55:58] the office of a bishop
[56:00] he desires a good work a bishop then
[56:02] must be blindless
[56:04] the husband of one wife vigilance sober
[56:07] good behavior etcetera
[56:09] that's kind of been left out of it
[56:11] dwayne the husband of one wife
[56:15] as i said it's over in the scriptures
[56:17] father
[56:18] he said about the woman having been the
[56:21] wife of one husband
[56:24] doesn't work go to number eight and see
[56:27] what the prophet says on marriage and
[56:29] divorce
[56:30] paragraph 2 32
[56:34] no now you notice in first corinthians 7
[56:36] 10
[56:37] notice paul commands the wife that is
[56:40] that divorces her husband to remain
[56:42] single
[56:43] or be reconciled not to remarry she must
[56:46] remain single or be reconciled back to
[56:48] her husband
[56:49] she cannot remarry she must remain
[56:52] single
[56:53] but notice he never said about the man
[56:58] because if he has a legal right to put
[57:00] his wife away
[57:02] a scriptural right but there is nothing
[57:06] for her there's no scripture
[57:08] you can't make the word lie from the
[57:10] beginning of sex law by polygamy
[57:12] now the word of god runs true with the
[57:14] nature of god runs in
[57:15] to continuity all right let's read the
[57:17] scripture he just quoted
[57:20] the way to number nine which is first
[57:22] corinthians seven
[57:25] 10 11 and unto the married i command
[57:28] yet not i but the lord
[57:32] not him no more right let the wife
[57:36] depart
[57:37] let not the wife depart from her husband
[57:40] but and if she depart let her remain
[57:42] unmarried
[57:44] or be reconciled to her husband and let
[57:46] not the husband
[57:47] put away his wife is that scripture
[57:52] yes but brother dale you sure be tying
[57:55] up a lot of women in the bad places
[57:57] i didn't cause the fall
[58:02] well i didn't either because i wasn't
[58:03] back in the garden
[58:07] you know one thing that i remember i
[58:09] keep in mind at one time
[58:12] maybe you don't think like this i'm sure
[58:13] you probably don't but
[58:18] i wonder what i would have done in the
[58:20] garden
[58:23] instead of blaming adam and eve you
[58:24] don't ever think like that
[58:26] you don't don't ever think about what
[58:28] you would have done if you was eve
[58:32] now under the thinking you got right now
[58:34] you might change things
[58:37] but come on
[58:41] what would you doing ladies men what
[58:44] would you done if you'd have been adam
[58:47] so we accept the fact that we're under
[58:49] the curse because of that you know
[58:51] what you want to call it
[58:55] let's go to romans 7 while we're at it
[59:00] paul is pretty plain
[59:03] let me number 10
[59:06] no you're not brethren for i speak no
[59:09] you're not brethren before i speak to
[59:10] them that
[59:10] know the law how does the law have
[59:12] dominion over a man
[59:14] as long as he liveth now we're going to
[59:17] leave that out of it
[59:18] we automatically erase this and go to
[59:21] that
[59:24] now what is he saying
[59:29] to the man what is he saying
[59:32] he's under the law as long as he liveth
[59:39] what was the law
[59:42] show me where moses said you could put
[59:44] your wife away for any cause
[59:46] other than fornication
[59:51] we've got deuteronomy 24 here in the
[59:53] back
[59:56] show me where he said anything show me
[59:58] where the man has got a right to destroy
[1:00:00] his wife his wife for
[1:00:01] burning the bread because she don't look
[1:00:02] good because the neighbor woman looks
[1:00:04] better
[1:00:08] what is it
[1:00:11] no you're not brethren for i speak to
[1:00:13] them that know the law and that the law
[1:00:15] had dominion over a man as long as he
[1:00:17] liveth for the woman which hath in the
[1:00:21] hood when is bound by the law to her
[1:00:23] husband
[1:00:24] as long as he liveth well if the husband
[1:00:26] be dead she's lost from the law of her
[1:00:28] husband
[1:00:30] that's fine
[1:00:33] that way a woman can remarry if her
[1:00:35] husband dies that's right
[1:00:37] right not like a man down at work one
[1:00:40] day he said well
[1:00:42] see that would if that be true said
[1:00:44] women just take a gun and shoot him
[1:00:47] and he's dead i can go get married i
[1:00:49] said yeah but you're a murderer
[1:00:52] which one you're gonna face god has
[1:00:56] you know people are you'd be surprised
[1:00:59] what goes through people's mind when you
[1:01:00] start talking about marriage and divorce
[1:01:03] all right but if the husband be dead
[1:01:06] she's loose from the law of her husband
[1:01:08] so then if while her husband liveth
[1:01:11] she'd be married to another man she
[1:01:13] shall be called an adulteress
[1:01:14] but if her husband be dead she's free
[1:01:16] from that law so that she
[1:01:18] is no adulteress though she'll be
[1:01:20] married to another man
[1:01:23] if your husband dies you can remarry
[1:01:27] sister but that's the only reason
[1:01:31] because there's no divorce for the woman
[1:01:34] the word if she can remarry
[1:01:35] which she can remarry if he's dead
[1:01:40] all right god's correct and honest
[1:01:46] but like i say take a gun and shoot him
[1:01:48] his dad or say
[1:01:49] i'll just pray the lord get him off the
[1:01:51] scene
[1:01:53] i don't think that would be the right
[1:01:54] christian attitude
[1:01:57] right not quite all right
[1:02:02] look at the next one taken from
[1:02:03] invisible union read this book before we
[1:02:05] get time to get there on the invisible
[1:02:07] union so we will be tying it together
[1:02:09] natural and spiritual
[1:02:12] invisible union preached in 1965 1125
[1:02:17] paragraph 151 now notice the bible said
[1:02:20] it plainly says here
[1:02:21] that her first husband must be dead not
[1:02:25] just put away
[1:02:26] he's got to be dead no grounds for her
[1:02:32] whatsoever
[1:02:34] no grounds for the woman whatsoever to
[1:02:36] divorce her husband and remarry
[1:02:39] if she divorces she must remain single
[1:02:44] or be reconciled back to him
[1:02:49] is that plain enough does anybody need a
[1:02:52] light bulb turned on
[1:02:56] no we need a whole lot of them put out
[1:02:59] and you know what i mean by that
[1:03:02] put out our own ideas and our thoughts
[1:03:06] yes but brother dale none of us ain't
[1:03:07] got no hopes there is no hopes outside
[1:03:09] of jesus christ
[1:03:11] that's right there is no hope whatsoever
[1:03:14] outside of jesus christ
[1:03:18] i want a brother standing after talking
[1:03:20] with me the other day and he said
[1:03:21] brother dale
[1:03:22] he said i heard you preach this before
[1:03:24] but he said this time
[1:03:25] and it really opened he said everything
[1:03:28] in that bible is marriage and divorce
[1:03:31] said you're exactly right see the new
[1:03:34] birth is marriage and divorce
[1:03:36] amen why because you've got to be dead
[1:03:40] to be married to christ your old
[1:03:44] husband has got to be dead to be married
[1:03:46] to christ that's right
[1:03:47] so it's all marriage in the forces no
[1:03:49] problem amen
[1:03:52] now watch what he says on marriage and
[1:03:53] divorce this is number 12.
[1:03:56] now we see that there's no grounds for
[1:03:58] her whatsoever
[1:04:00] and in the new testament we don't
[1:04:02] believe in polygamy
[1:04:04] is that do you understand me well you
[1:04:07] believe that it's up to you
[1:04:10] new testament there's no polygamy we're
[1:04:12] in the
[1:04:13] the antitype that they were a type of
[1:04:16] and when you go
[1:04:17] tight you go to antitype you don't go
[1:04:19] back to type
[1:04:20] right and there's no
[1:04:22] anti-anti-anti-anti-anar to make more
[1:04:24] types out of it so get off of it
[1:04:27] now what about him
[1:04:31] can a man just put his wife away
[1:04:34] forever cause they said
[1:04:42] he said it wasn't so from the beginning
[1:04:49] well moses now gave us the writing of
[1:04:52] divorcement
[1:04:56] i'm honest not sarcastic
[1:04:59] plain and blunt i want to see that in
[1:05:02] the bible
[1:05:07] i want to see your interpretation
[1:05:11] of the new testament even to put it back
[1:05:13] in the old testament
[1:05:20] maybe that's contrary to your thinking
[1:05:22] but what i mean
[1:05:25] even if you're trying the new testament
[1:05:27] to go back in the old testament you're
[1:05:28] going to kill yourself with your word
[1:05:29] with the word
[1:05:30] because in the old testament that man
[1:05:33] could not marry
[1:05:34] no woman but a virgin
[1:05:40] i explained that a moment ago if the
[1:05:42] woman was a virgin she marries if she
[1:05:44] her husband dies the man marries her
[1:05:48] she's still a virgin i explained that
[1:05:51] that's what your prophet said
[1:05:57] when you come down to a preacher
[1:06:02] he can't marry any woman
[1:06:05] that's got a living husband or had a
[1:06:07] husband
[1:06:09] don't run it with the virginity of
[1:06:10] trying to to say this virgin within
[1:06:12] all the prophets playing in marriage and
[1:06:14] divorce
[1:06:16] he's not to do that all right there is
[1:06:19] only one scripture that you've got to go
[1:06:21] on that he can marry the wit of a priest
[1:06:25] but you better make sure your virginity
[1:06:26] is lined up correct and marrying the wit
[1:06:28] of a priest
[1:06:30] all right
[1:06:34] that's just being as blunt as i can
[1:06:35] without having to be what
[1:06:37] so now listen
[1:06:40] what can a man what is his causes
[1:06:45] we love to get that there's no grounds
[1:06:47] for her at all we love to do that
[1:06:50] but what about the grounds for a man
[1:06:53] see she's got a living husband take a
[1:06:56] marriage divorce
[1:06:57] paragraph 227. man can marry her
[1:07:01] care what she does and who she is
[1:07:06] don't leave nobody out right she's got a
[1:07:09] living husband there's no grounds for
[1:07:11] her at all
[1:07:12] but it's not said for him
[1:07:16] oh i said right there it is bro it's not
[1:07:18] sad for him
[1:07:19] so he can just go do what he wants to
[1:07:22] now i want the scripture where he can
[1:07:27] i've done stated it to start with the
[1:07:29] only one jesus said except it be for
[1:07:30] fornication
[1:07:32] ours we'll quote in a minute where he
[1:07:34] said saving which is the same word
[1:07:36] except or saving which is two different
[1:07:38] scriptures but speaking it
[1:07:42] but it's not for him causes her
[1:07:46] not him get it you have to make the word
[1:07:49] run in continuity see nothing's saying
[1:07:51] he couldn't but she can't see
[1:07:55] because it's her not him that's exactly
[1:07:57] what the bible says
[1:07:58] calls it her it's not stated against him
[1:08:00] to remarry
[1:08:01] but her why christ in the type
[1:08:06] now whether we get an invisible union
[1:08:08] with that
[1:08:10] he put away the lutheran
[1:08:15] because they were fornicators and he
[1:08:17] married the westminster
[1:08:22] he put away the westlands and married
[1:08:24] the pentecostals
[1:08:26] why because there were fornicators
[1:08:29] you got to get your type running right
[1:08:32] notice it stated that he cannot remarry
[1:08:36] only a virgin
[1:08:41] that's where people don't even go
[1:08:43] through and even list the scriptures
[1:08:44] paul speaks of a man having a virginity
[1:08:46] the same as a woman having a virginity
[1:08:54] but the boy's okay i mean he's had it
[1:08:57] he's had a bunch of girlfriends okay
[1:08:59] with him but the girl's not supposed to
[1:09:01] have no boyfriends
[1:09:02] now i want scripture
[1:09:07] he's a fornicator to do that
[1:09:14] what else would it be come on my words i
[1:09:17] don't know but
[1:09:18] what else would it be
[1:09:22] only a virgin he can remarry he can
[1:09:25] remarry again
[1:09:26] if it's a virgin but he can't marry
[1:09:29] somebody else's wife
[1:09:31] no indeed and if he does marry a
[1:09:34] divorced woman
[1:09:36] he is living in adultery i don't care
[1:09:39] who he is
[1:09:40] the bible said whosoever married her
[1:09:42] that is put away
[1:09:44] live it in adultery there you are not no
[1:09:47] divorcee
[1:09:49] all right so what he can only marry a
[1:09:52] virgin
[1:09:56] now we're getting the grounds for him
[1:10:03] and the grounds for him starts off hard
[1:10:05] and blunt
[1:10:08] not the fact that he can divorce his
[1:10:11] wife because she's done something wrong
[1:10:12] and then he goes and marries anybody
[1:10:13] else he wants to
[1:10:17] we're all commanded to marry virgins the
[1:10:20] first time
[1:10:22] or the 14th time
[1:10:30] see that's getting off of the women just
[1:10:31] a little bit ain't it
[1:10:34] gonna give you sisters a little rest the
[1:10:35] rest of the night
[1:10:40] but i thought we were christians
[1:10:43] i thought we wanted to know what was
[1:10:44] right
[1:10:48] why not right
[1:10:52] if we find out we're wrong there's hopes
[1:10:54] we've got some way of doing something
[1:10:55] about it
[1:10:56] but if we go on through life thinking
[1:10:58] we're right
[1:11:04] well how can we straighten up this or
[1:11:05] straighten up that
[1:11:13] i don't have no answers like that
[1:11:17] but i have a god that can make a lot of
[1:11:20] answers
[1:11:23] right so we'll deal with him
[1:11:27] program 243 marriage and divorce number
[1:11:30] 13.
[1:11:33] but to get this marriage and divorce
[1:11:34] straightened out
[1:11:36] so that you'd know what was right and
[1:11:38] which was wrong
[1:11:39] no which was right and which was wrong
[1:11:43] now he plainly shows here in these types
[1:11:47] there is one christ and many members of
[1:11:48] that wife notice he
[1:11:50] can put us away for spiritual
[1:11:52] fornication
[1:11:54] and false doctrine anytime he wants to
[1:11:57] but how dare you try to put him away
[1:11:59] and make it the man can put away his
[1:12:01] wife and marry another one
[1:12:04] but not the woman put away her husband
[1:12:06] and marry another one
[1:12:08] yeah but he didn't he didn't say
[1:12:10] anything about what
[1:12:12] he's already said it the bible's already
[1:12:14] said it
[1:12:15] that's right
[1:12:20] see all the shadows and the types are
[1:12:22] perfectly balanced up
[1:12:24] see the original creation not the
[1:12:25] byproduct nowhere
[1:12:27] not the church the bride through the
[1:12:29] word not the woman the man each time
[1:12:32] that's why it's never said anything
[1:12:34] against a man doing it it's always the
[1:12:37] woman
[1:12:38] that's exactly but she can be the bride
[1:12:40] of christ by being and
[1:12:42] remember she being a part of a man now
[1:12:45] listen
[1:12:47] you sisters want to know how to
[1:12:49] straighten up things
[1:12:52] now you read this real careful and
[1:12:53] you'll get the right answer
[1:12:57] the male was the only one in the old
[1:12:59] testament the only one period
[1:13:01] that can be circumcised right and the
[1:13:04] circumcision was the covenant
[1:13:07] so the woman had to be under her father
[1:13:10] until the time came
[1:13:14] his he was he was her head then when she
[1:13:17] married the man
[1:13:18] the man became her head there was no
[1:13:20] head outside of that
[1:13:22] that's right right are you with me
[1:13:26] so now look what the prophet has to say
[1:13:30] she can be the bride of christ by being
[1:13:32] remember she's being a part of a man
[1:13:36] you remember she was taken out of him
[1:13:38] all things right
[1:13:42] nevertheless i suffer
[1:13:45] not a woman to teach or to serve any
[1:13:46] authority but to be in silence for adam
[1:13:48] was first formed and then eve
[1:13:50] and adam was not deceived but the
[1:13:53] byproduct was deceived
[1:13:55] notwithstanding she shall be saved if
[1:13:57] she continues in a holiness
[1:13:59] sobriety and in childbearing in all such
[1:14:03] why because then she becomes a part of
[1:14:07] this man
[1:14:14] of course former pastor had years ago
[1:14:17] used to get up you know
[1:14:19] he preached about women and everything
[1:14:21] else preaching about baby
[1:14:23] supposed to have babies and the old days
[1:14:25] when we first got started
[1:14:27] if the girl wasn't married by the time
[1:14:28] she's 16 she's
[1:14:30] something wrong with her and by the time
[1:14:31] she's 20 she had to have four kids
[1:14:35] and that's no joke because that's the
[1:14:38] way they taught it
[1:14:44] and brought down a lot of things on a
[1:14:46] lot of people
[1:14:48] right all right but brother he'd get up
[1:14:51] and preach about it you know
[1:14:53] so one day he was standing up there and
[1:14:55] he read that scripture
[1:14:56] she shall be saved in childbearing
[1:15:00] and he just stopped and looked around
[1:15:04] i proved my point he never read the rest
[1:15:07] of scripture
[1:15:10] when i got outside i asked him a simple
[1:15:13] question
[1:15:16] i said brother would you mind reading
[1:15:18] the rest of that scripture that you
[1:15:19] quoted half of it
[1:15:20] what do you mean i quote a scripture you
[1:15:23] said a woman shall be saved in
[1:15:24] childbearing
[1:15:28] that's what it said that's to read the
[1:15:29] rest of the scripture it says
[1:15:31] if she continuing the faith do you need
[1:15:33] that scripture do we need to get that
[1:15:35] is it enough to read it off what he's
[1:15:36] saying that if she's in sobriety and
[1:15:40] holiness and goodness
[1:15:42] is that enough for him to say it you
[1:15:44] need the scripture it says
[1:15:46] if she continue in the faith
[1:15:49] not in having babies he said to having
[1:15:52] babies
[1:15:53] makes her one with the man
[1:15:58] come on did your prophet say invisible
[1:16:01] union go read it
[1:16:03] he said a woman who won't have a man a
[1:16:04] child
[1:16:11] get rough tony
[1:16:18] i got my own interpretation about a
[1:16:20] woman that won't have a child for a man
[1:16:22] and i don't believe in having 49 kids
[1:16:26] that's plain we got three
[1:16:32] but i got my own interpretation there
[1:16:35] it's brother dale for a second okay
[1:16:40] if my wife when she would never have
[1:16:41] done that
[1:16:43] she would never refuse the child to come
[1:16:47] but had she refused a child to come and
[1:16:49] there was another child to come through
[1:16:51] me by predestination what's going to
[1:16:52] happen to her
[1:16:54] okay
[1:16:58] that's brother dale we'll charge you a
[1:17:00] dime for that
[1:17:03] but listen
[1:17:08] the bible says now let's get back we've
[1:17:10] got just a minute
[1:17:12] go on to number 13.
[1:17:16] hey
[1:17:21] i add these in a lot of times even
[1:17:23] though i do cut and splice and do all
[1:17:24] kinds of things
[1:17:25] i have to put an a on there to where to
[1:17:27] keep up with
[1:17:28] matthew 19 3 says the pharisees also
[1:17:31] came unto him tempting him saying unto
[1:17:33] him
[1:17:34] is it lawful for a man to put away his
[1:17:35] wife forever cause
[1:17:39] jesus said it's not so from the
[1:17:41] beginning
[1:17:43] they said well why did moses
[1:17:46] give a writing of divorcement he said
[1:17:50] because of the hardness of your heart
[1:17:55] but i want to ask you a question there
[1:17:59] did the the divorce
[1:18:02] the correcting of the madden voice
[1:18:04] problem with moses
[1:18:06] was it for everybody right
[1:18:11] they thought it was that's right
[1:18:17] but around them says this is for my
[1:18:19] followers
[1:18:20] only this is not for the world
[1:18:24] that's right right of course i follow
[1:18:27] him
[1:18:28] i just don't believe his doctrine but i
[1:18:30] sure do believe in his marriage and
[1:18:31] divorce
[1:18:33] because i had four wives not come away
[1:18:35] just one yeah of course i still got the
[1:18:36] other three in the closet
[1:18:39] you said silly but that's what's
[1:18:40] happening
[1:18:45] moses what did you do
[1:18:51] did you tell him it was all right to
[1:18:52] marry just for any you know divorced and
[1:18:55] married for any cause
[1:18:58] now jesus said it wasn't so from the
[1:18:59] beginning
[1:19:01] they was trying to trap him by
[1:19:04] saying moses says all right for any
[1:19:06] cause he said went so from the beginning
[1:19:08] so they just kind of we better make
[1:19:11] another approach
[1:19:11] well bones just said we could do it
[1:19:15] he said because of the hardness of your
[1:19:17] heart
[1:19:21] now if anybody went there on that day
[1:19:25] 1960 what was it five or what
[1:19:29] 65 anybody went there with two or three
[1:19:33] wives
[1:19:34] or two or three husbands and if they
[1:19:37] really believe what the prophet said
[1:19:39] they could go home frequently
[1:19:40] don't you believe it but what if he went
[1:19:44] there with the hardness of the heart
[1:19:50] they went back home with just as many
[1:19:52] wives and then under worse condemnation
[1:19:55] but yet they told everybody we're free
[1:19:59] and i'd go do it again i'd go have all i
[1:20:02] want
[1:20:11] bible what is the only grounds
[1:20:15] for a man number 14.
[1:20:21] matthew 19 9 and i say unto you
[1:20:23] whosoever shall put away his wife
[1:20:25] except it be for fornication then shall
[1:20:27] marry another committed adultery
[1:20:29] do so marrieth her which is put away
[1:20:31] does commit adultery
[1:20:34] there's no other grounds
[1:20:40] it's using the word except
[1:20:43] the word except means for any other
[1:20:45] cause or for you know some specific
[1:20:47] point
[1:20:49] go on to matthew 5
[1:20:54] 31 it has been said whosoever shall put
[1:20:57] away his wife let him give her a writing
[1:20:59] of divorcement
[1:21:00] but i say unto you
[1:21:04] that whosoever shall put away his wife's
[1:21:07] saving for the cause of fornication
[1:21:09] causes her to commit adultery and
[1:21:10] whosoever whosoever shall marry her that
[1:21:13] his divorce
[1:21:14] committeth adultery is that plain enough
[1:21:18] is that bible do we need any more
[1:21:21] scripture
[1:21:23] but what if you get a scripture like
[1:21:24] this throw it up in your face
[1:21:26] look number 16.
[1:21:30] this is bible mark 11 10 11 and 12.
[1:21:34] and he said un to them whosoever shall
[1:21:36] put away his wife and marry another
[1:21:38] committed adultery against her
[1:21:44] what if you get that scripture by itself
[1:21:47] and if a woman should put away her
[1:21:48] husband and be married to another she
[1:21:50] committed adultery
[1:21:53] now you believe that scripture
[1:21:58] now you see why that we have to take
[1:22:00] like i did the other day you know
[1:22:02] one scripture over here another
[1:22:04] scripture over here
[1:22:05] to explain this scripture back here
[1:22:09] now this here is not wrong because jesus
[1:22:12] has already explained it
[1:22:15] are we old 14 chapters later
[1:22:20] if it be for any of us lesson 14
[1:22:25] should be right about any time but you
[1:22:28] see church
[1:22:30] what is fornication
[1:22:38] what is fornication
[1:22:42] all right we know automatically
[1:22:44] fornication is unclean living
[1:22:48] that's sensible direct statement
[1:22:51] got a couple in here on it if you need
[1:22:53] it
[1:22:56] but you say but brother dale's
[1:22:58] fornication a woman that's married can't
[1:23:00] commit fornication
[1:23:02] i mean he can't commit adultery she can
[1:23:04] only commit fornication
[1:23:08] you're reading but what did eve do in
[1:23:11] the garden
[1:23:14] the prophet said she committed adultery
[1:23:21] yeah but it couldn't have been bad guy
[1:23:22] because he wasn't married well he didn't
[1:23:23] have much choice of who he married
[1:23:27] god just took her out of him and set her
[1:23:29] down there and said that's your wife
[1:23:35] go back to reading genesis and see if
[1:23:36] that's not what it's saying
[1:23:39] he's to leave his father and mother amen
[1:23:43] and cleave unto his wife is that
[1:23:46] scripture
[1:23:48] all right we'll get to it sunday where
[1:23:51] an
[1:23:51] engagement is a wedding
[1:23:57] but we're trying to get with it tonight
[1:23:58] about
[1:24:00] what grounds does a man have
[1:24:04] to divorce his wife and remarry
[1:24:09] only for fornication
[1:24:14] fornication is a word called unclean
[1:24:16] living
[1:24:21] if they pull these up fast enough to
[1:24:23] keep up with me okie dokie wrote a
[1:24:24] number 20.
[1:24:25] we'll go through a couple of these if
[1:24:27] you don't get there i'll read it this is
[1:24:29] taken from the worst center in the city
[1:24:30] 1956
[1:24:32] to 18 evening let me tell you something
[1:24:34] a lot of you
[1:24:36] you women tonight would have an awful
[1:24:38] time doing that
[1:24:39] you'd have to stand on your head you
[1:24:40] know what he's talking about to her
[1:24:42] shame on you the bible
[1:24:44] hair is given to a woman for her glory
[1:24:46] and the bible
[1:24:48] writes gives any man a right to leave
[1:24:52] and divorce and leave his wife that'll
[1:24:55] cut her hair
[1:25:00] that's the bible that's what did he say
[1:25:04] thus saith the lord
[1:25:09] he said too bad we got away from a lot
[1:25:10] of this and
[1:25:12] questions and answers 53 729
[1:25:17] he said i had a hotline down on that the
[1:25:18] other day in shreveport they were
[1:25:20] talking about the women
[1:25:21] they said women were long hired and i
[1:25:24] said that woman that
[1:25:25] bobbed her higher her husband had a
[1:25:27] right and a bible right to divorce her
[1:25:34] now watch him drop on down to the bottom
[1:25:36] but read that now because we don't want
[1:25:38] to go out on a limb do we
[1:25:39] so let's stay off the limb and a woman
[1:25:41] that's a dishonorable
[1:25:45] that's dishonorable has a legal right to
[1:25:47] be put away
[1:25:48] in divorce but he can't marry again now
[1:25:52] you can't put your wife away for cutting
[1:25:54] her higher
[1:25:56] and remarry
[1:26:01] you can put her away because that's
[1:26:06] fornication
[1:26:15] what about
[1:26:19] the scripture
[1:26:22] and i know i don't have a quote from
[1:26:24] brother branham on this one but what
[1:26:25] about it
[1:26:27] he said it was thus saith the lord a man
[1:26:29] could put his way wife wife away for
[1:26:30] cutting her
[1:26:32] then he says he can't marry again just
[1:26:33] for that reason that's not a reason so
[1:26:36] all right and i can give you a
[1:26:39] 50-something i think quotes on it
[1:26:41] before that he has a right to put her
[1:26:43] away
[1:26:45] and sometimes he'll say even maybe
[1:26:46] honored of god to do so
[1:26:50] but why would you want to put your wife
[1:26:52] away for cutting her hair
[1:26:57] was she just honoring me
[1:27:03] maybe you're not acting like abraham
[1:27:08] you start acting like abraham you might
[1:27:10] have some grounds to walk on
[1:27:13] i hope everybody understands that point
[1:27:18] people are hunting excuses to get rid of
[1:27:20] their wives or husbands
[1:27:27] you say well i can put her away
[1:27:31] man but you can't marry again so now
[1:27:32] you're single
[1:27:34] so you're going to remain single the
[1:27:35] rest of your life as far as i'm
[1:27:36] concerned
[1:27:38] and you're going to get married and
[1:27:40] ain't going to do it
[1:27:42] and i'm going to tell you where you're
[1:27:44] standing
[1:27:49] he said well what i'll do is i'll just
[1:27:51] i'll divorce her and then she'll
[1:27:53] she'll see i have to have a man and so
[1:27:54] she'll get her a man then i can divorce
[1:27:56] i can really get married again because
[1:27:57] you to do
[1:28:00] uh according to about two scriptures we
[1:28:04] read that
[1:28:06] you would cause her to commit adultery
[1:28:10] now if you caused her to commit adultery
[1:28:13] by withholding your body
[1:28:15] from your wife you know things husband
[1:28:18] wife
[1:28:21] you withhold your body and you
[1:28:23] understand me right
[1:28:27] and you caused that person to go out and
[1:28:28] do wrong you're caused without doing
[1:28:30] wrong
[1:28:34] and you're guilty
[1:28:37] and you'll never go nowhere with god
[1:28:39] until you straighten that up
[1:28:43] plain enough
[1:28:46] don't play plain enough
[1:28:51] you called her to commit adultery then
[1:28:52] you're guilty of what she's doing
[1:28:58] now she runs off away from you know i
[1:29:00] told you
[1:29:04] so i believe
[1:29:10] that a man could put away his wife for
[1:29:12] committing adultery against him
[1:29:14] and remarry
[1:29:21] if it's for fornication
[1:29:29] not cutting to the hair now
[1:29:33] you might have grounds because the
[1:29:34] prophet said honored of god not to live
[1:29:36] with a woman to go out here and dress
[1:29:38] like these women do today
[1:29:40] you want them
[1:29:45] he said my wife come in with him clothes
[1:29:47] on she'd be divorced
[1:29:51] run it in the book and quote you'll see
[1:30:00] what about the bible where it says
[1:30:02] whosoever looketh on a woman to lust
[1:30:03] after his heart's committed adultery
[1:30:05] already
[1:30:05] with her
[1:30:08] and you caused him to do it you're
[1:30:10] guilty
[1:30:14] would that fall under fornication
[1:30:22] but they don't preach on women dressed
[1:30:24] in hairs and clothes and stuff like that
[1:30:25] too much but when i do i put it hard
[1:30:27] right
[1:30:27] too hard i guess you go out there and
[1:30:30] show your body to somebody and they lust
[1:30:32] after you you've got a problem
[1:30:34] you're going to have to straighten that
[1:30:35] up with god
[1:30:37] why would you want to do that in front
[1:30:38] of a center
[1:30:40] in front of anybody why
[1:30:52] why would you want to go out and undress
[1:30:53] yourself
[1:30:56] in front of men that's your husband's
[1:31:00] property
[1:31:03] you're out displaying it
[1:31:11] yeah but brother dale is not
[1:31:19] what did the prophet say about
[1:31:21] fornication and adultery
[1:31:25] he said the word could be applied either
[1:31:26] way
[1:31:28] the difference between fornication and
[1:31:30] adultery the word could be applied
[1:31:32] either way
[1:31:33] but to make it clear this is number 17
[1:31:35] if they get it back to our own
[1:31:37] advice enough when he was talking of
[1:31:40] what he was talking of there
[1:31:42] that a woman that's unmarried cannot
[1:31:44] commit adultery
[1:31:45] because she has no husband to commit
[1:31:48] adultery against that's
[1:31:49] good it's uncleanness for her
[1:31:53] now watch what's the rest of it
[1:31:58] she has to confess that to her husband
[1:32:00] before they
[1:32:01] are married if she did that
[1:32:04] if not her husband finds it out later he
[1:32:07] has a right to put away
[1:32:09] because she took a false foul
[1:32:14] fornication and adultery
[1:32:19] well now brother that my wife she or she
[1:32:22] committed
[1:32:24] a daughter or was it fornication it's
[1:32:26] just
[1:32:28] what does it make any difference
[1:32:32] you mean god's going to stand up before
[1:32:34] the lutheran and said let's see was it
[1:32:35] adultery you was committing there was it
[1:32:37] fornication just committed
[1:32:40] if i could decide which one i judge you
[1:32:43] silly
[1:32:48] as i said eve committed adultery
[1:32:52] we'll get to it sunday if a woman and a
[1:32:53] man is engaged they're married
[1:32:55] as far as god is concerned
[1:33:02] what are you going to argue to plead the
[1:33:03] case of fornication and adultery
[1:33:09] i told a man just recently was talking
[1:33:11] with him
[1:33:12] i said brother they told me it's a long
[1:33:15] time ago
[1:33:17] they told me you couldn't pastor a
[1:33:19] church
[1:33:21] because you wouldn't married
[1:33:27] brother priest right here said that
[1:33:34] he said he couldn't couldn't preach
[1:33:36] couldn't
[1:33:37] pastor because he wasn't married i said
[1:33:39] well jesus wasn't married now what are
[1:33:41] you going to do with that
[1:33:42] and i said besides that paul wouldn't
[1:33:43] marry yes paul was married
[1:33:45] i said i'll bring you the proof and i
[1:33:47] did
[1:33:49] and i give it to him do you think it
[1:33:50] changed his mind about anything nope
[1:33:52] but i gave him where the prophet said
[1:33:54] paul was not married
[1:33:58] you think it changed him no it didn't
[1:34:00] change it
[1:34:02] you ain't gonna change people it takes
[1:34:05] god to change people
[1:34:08] any of us you argue over adultery or
[1:34:12] fornication
[1:34:15] your prophet said she that wasn't
[1:34:18] married
[1:34:18] would be fornication he said but if she
[1:34:20] don't tell that man
[1:34:25] he's got a right to divorce her
[1:34:28] what about this license invisible union
[1:34:35] number 22 if they get it up there she
[1:34:38] has a sacred trust
[1:34:40] paragraph 83 84
[1:34:44] 5-6 he has a sacred trust a virtue
[1:34:47] committed to her by the lord
[1:34:49] a certain virtue nothing else holds it
[1:34:51] but a woman
[1:34:52] right that's committed to her by god she
[1:34:54] must not defile that virtue
[1:34:56] and if she even does something wrong
[1:35:00] she must confess that to her husband
[1:35:02] before he takes her
[1:35:04] and make it right the same as the church
[1:35:06] that was married to the law
[1:35:08] has to come also before christ before
[1:35:11] the second marriage
[1:35:12] she has to confess that if she doesn't
[1:35:15] and she lives with her husband for 10
[1:35:17] years
[1:35:18] and then confesses it he has a right to
[1:35:21] put her away
[1:35:22] and marry another woman that's the way
[1:35:24] the scripture
[1:35:25] fornication unclean living
[1:35:31] why would we want to play
[1:35:35] with anything
[1:35:40] why would we want to play with it
[1:35:45] he's minded to put her away privately
[1:35:47] see after he'd already engaged to her
[1:35:49] when you're engaged to her as far as god
[1:35:51] is concerned you're married to her
[1:35:56] is that the way your prophet says we'll
[1:35:58] get that sunday
[1:36:00] but the only place that you've got
[1:36:02] anywhere and i'll just do this in a
[1:36:03] second
[1:36:05] is deuteronomy 24
[1:36:09] i gave it to him but i didn't put a
[1:36:10] number on it so it'd be the last thing
[1:36:12] if they can pull it up if not we'll read
[1:36:15] it
[1:36:17] the only place that i know of that
[1:36:19] brother that moses mentions anything
[1:36:21] about marriage and divorce
[1:36:23] in deuteronomy 24.
[1:36:26] all right so let's just read deuteronomy
[1:36:29] 24
[1:36:30] and then we'll conclude our point to see
[1:36:33] about it when a man had taken a
[1:36:39] wife and married her and it come to piss
[1:36:43] verse one let you find no favor in his
[1:36:45] eyes because he had found some
[1:36:47] uncleanness
[1:36:48] in her then let him write her a bill of
[1:36:51] divorcement
[1:36:52] and give it her hand and send her out of
[1:36:53] his house
[1:36:56] now i'm serious i'm serious as a heart
[1:36:59] attack the old saying go
[1:37:00] i'd like to know more about moses and
[1:37:04] the the uh bill of divorcements and the
[1:37:07] things
[1:37:08] but this is all i can find it's all i've
[1:37:09] been able to find after all these
[1:37:11] 40 years of studying it you know i've
[1:37:13] tried to find
[1:37:15] i do have one more but we'll get to that
[1:37:16] in a second
[1:37:18] but watch now because he had found some
[1:37:21] uncleanness in her
[1:37:23] let him write her a bill or divorcement
[1:37:24] and give him to her hand and send her
[1:37:26] out of his house
[1:37:28] now can she ever marry again no
[1:37:31] watch and when she's departed out of his
[1:37:33] house she may go and be another man's
[1:37:35] wife
[1:37:36] oh she may go she may go no it's not
[1:37:39] saying
[1:37:40] that it's okay for her to do it it's
[1:37:41] saying she's going to do it
[1:37:43] right because god would be justifying it
[1:37:46] if he said it's okay
[1:37:47] he said well that's the bible you ain't
[1:37:50] got the interpretation
[1:37:52] you've got your carnal words
[1:37:55] and she may go in other words she will
[1:37:58] go
[1:37:59] right and be another man's wife you say
[1:38:02] well how can you prove the rest of it
[1:38:03] if the latter husband hate her
[1:38:08] and he writes her a bill of divorcement
[1:38:12] and giving it in her hand and centered
[1:38:14] her out of his house
[1:38:15] or if the latter husband die
[1:38:20] come on if he dies everything's free
[1:38:25] come on which took her to be his wife
[1:38:28] her former husband which sent her away
[1:38:31] may not take her again to be his wife
[1:38:35] now why not if everything was okey-dokey
[1:38:39] so everything ain't okey-dokey
[1:38:44] after she is defiled for that is
[1:38:47] abomination for the lord
[1:38:49] you call sin in the land okay i think i
[1:38:52] put it up
[1:38:54] with that unclean let's go ahead and
[1:38:55] pull this up i'm going to take just a
[1:38:56] minute and then i'm sorry
[1:38:58] go ahead and give the the hebrew lexicon
[1:39:03] this is from the word there where it
[1:39:05] says uncleanness
[1:39:07] in deuteronomy where it says uncleanness
[1:39:10] it's 6172 means nakedness nudity shame
[1:39:13] pudenda pudenda implying of shameful
[1:39:15] exposure
[1:39:16] nakedness of a thing indecency improper
[1:39:18] behavior exposed
[1:39:20] undefended figurative
[1:39:25] that uncleanness had heard not cause she
[1:39:26] didn't take a bath
[1:39:31] it was her fornication
[1:39:34] are you listening something was wrong
[1:39:37] with her
[1:39:38] sexually
[1:39:44] nakedness nudity shame that's what it's
[1:39:46] saying so there was either nakedness
[1:39:48] nudity or shame
[1:39:50] in her past you know somewhere that
[1:39:53] caused the problem
[1:39:54] if you didn't you look that word up i
[1:39:56] get into trouble all the time
[1:39:58] you look that one up go on the
[1:40:01] dictionary
[1:40:03] but if something wrong with her and the
[1:40:07] man had a right to put
[1:40:08] her away she went to another man's he
[1:40:11] married him
[1:40:12] he died but looked like he'd come back
[1:40:14] the first one no
[1:40:15] can't do it because it would pollute the
[1:40:16] land the bible says
[1:40:19] now give me the next one and then we'll
[1:40:21] be through jeremiah 3
[1:40:26] they say they say he says
[1:40:30] they say he says read it
[1:40:33] they say if a man put away his wife and
[1:40:35] she'd go from him
[1:40:37] and become another man's shall he return
[1:40:40] unto her again
[1:40:42] they say is not that the same as the
[1:40:46] pharisees
[1:40:47] moses said it was okey dokey
[1:40:52] shall not that land be greatly polluted
[1:40:57] but thou hast played the harlot with
[1:40:59] many lovers yet return again to me saith
[1:41:01] the lord
[1:41:02] because he always begged israel to
[1:41:03] return
[1:41:08] if you want marriage in divorce if you
[1:41:10] can't see where a prophet got
[1:41:13] what he said you better read that over
[1:41:16] and over
[1:41:20] because even though israel polluted
[1:41:21] that's what it's talking about
[1:41:23] but it's taught me international even
[1:41:25] though israel polluted
[1:41:26] herself god still dealt with her until
[1:41:29] the final day
[1:41:31] when he put her away never to be married
[1:41:33] again to her
[1:41:36] marriage and divorce
[1:41:40] moses brother branham said had a right
[1:41:43] god counted it righteousness did he
[1:41:45] count everybody
[1:41:46] burning the bread or because she didn't
[1:41:48] smell good or because she wasn't purdy
[1:41:50] or
[1:41:51] no no had to have a reason to be able to
[1:41:55] get rid of her
[1:41:56] you remember the story that jesus told
[1:41:59] or is told about the parable
[1:42:02] of the lady that the headband that had
[1:42:03] all of the stones in it you know
[1:42:05] you remember the story that's right and
[1:42:08] if they don't if she done something
[1:42:10] wrong
[1:42:11] and the husband was gone somewhere away
[1:42:13] you know
[1:42:14] they'd take her down to the high priest
[1:42:16] and the high priest would just take one
[1:42:17] of them stones out
[1:42:20] said she's guilty of adultery well
[1:42:23] naturally when the husband comes back
[1:42:26] home
[1:42:28] and he finds a stone missing
[1:42:33] he knows what she done
[1:42:36] of course nowadays it's all different
[1:42:38] ain't it them oh high priest of things
[1:42:40] just fake that
[1:42:42] that's what everybody says now they
[1:42:44] wasn't guilty
[1:42:47] got pictures of people blowing up
[1:42:52] blowing up and pictures of them sitting
[1:42:53] down a backpack right but they're not
[1:42:56] guilty
[1:42:58] you know well no proof of them being
[1:43:02] born too old i'm sorry
[1:43:08] it's post still happened brother would
[1:43:10] be told about it one time said his daddy
[1:43:13] his daddy was a comical guy and he said
[1:43:15] his dad he was riding with this guy and
[1:43:16] said
[1:43:17] they started to pull up in the yard at
[1:43:18] the man's house and said there's still a
[1:43:20] man on the porch just kissing that
[1:43:22] fella's wife like everything
[1:43:24] so they pulled up and they got out and
[1:43:26] he went up here and he said he was
[1:43:27] guessing that man
[1:43:29] she said you gonna believe your eyes or
[1:43:31] believe what i say
[1:43:32] i said i wasn't kissing him
[1:43:36] he said well i guess i was deceived on
[1:43:37] that i didn't you know i didn't really
[1:43:39] see it
[1:43:42] you know what she meant get out or shut
[1:43:46] up
[1:43:47] i ain't that dumb we don't play things
[1:43:50] in marriage and divorce
[1:43:55] i hope you understand my point
[1:43:58] man can't just put away his wife just
[1:44:00] for anything he's got to have a reason
[1:44:02] and he can't marry again unless it's a
[1:44:05] virgin
[1:44:13] now where do you put the people in the
[1:44:14] marriage in divorce with this message
[1:44:16] and what they're doing
[1:44:21] he said well brother dale
[1:44:25] you're beating on me
[1:44:34] i didn't do it
[1:44:39] are you blaming me cause you've done it
[1:44:43] sorry i stand you're gonna blame me for
[1:44:48] what you've done
[1:44:49] go ahead when you get there
[1:44:53] you're going to need some other court of
[1:44:54] appeal
[1:44:58] because that's one thing about lula
[1:45:02] you can't go and say that we just play
[1:45:04] all kind of garbage cans about marriage
[1:45:06] and divorce
[1:45:07] we're blunt we're straight we tell it
[1:45:10] like it is
[1:45:16] but we also know that god has grace and
[1:45:18] a wonderful amount of grace
[1:45:21] if you can't see that in jeremiah that i
[1:45:23] just read
[1:45:24] god says return unto me or backsliding
[1:45:27] israel
[1:45:28] he's standing tonight without stretched
[1:45:29] hands to the bride of jesus christ
[1:45:31] around the world
[1:45:32] trying to get her to come to him and get
[1:45:34] straight for there can be a body change
[1:45:36] because that's the problem the problem
[1:45:38] is marriage and divorce is this body
[1:45:42] the soul is eternal by the new birth
[1:45:45] the body is still polluted and tied to
[1:45:48] this world
[1:45:51] we got to get that straight
[1:45:55] what do we got 290 in the red book 290
[1:45:58] anybody have a need
[1:46:00] paul to jesus
[1:46:24] is

[1:47:20] to thee

[1:47:46] truly know that
[1:47:50] but we don't believe it and ask god to
[1:47:52] reveal it
[1:47:54] it can't be
[1:48:10] one more verse before we go
[1:48:13] to jesus i surrender
[1:48:39] i surrendered
[1:48:44] all
[1:48:53] father we thank you for tonight and we
[1:48:55] pray that what we've said would be
[1:48:56] worthy lord
[1:48:58] to be able to be said and we've tried to
[1:49:00] say it the right way
[1:49:01] because we're not trying to make no walk
[1:49:03] sided a fire out of anything but
[1:49:05] believe what you've said and just accept
[1:49:08] what you said
[1:49:10] then there's always grace every time in
[1:49:13] israel would run out and do all the
[1:49:15] wrong you would still stand with the
[1:49:16] armed outstretched
[1:49:18] waiting on them to return return unto
[1:49:20] thee oh backsliding israel to me he said
[1:49:27] but father that come a day when they
[1:49:28] wouldn't return
