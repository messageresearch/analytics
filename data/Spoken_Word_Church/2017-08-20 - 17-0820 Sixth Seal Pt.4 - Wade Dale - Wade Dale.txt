TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] alright tell let's not worry about that I want worried about the sun's on dark not worried I think even enough to look at you for nothing one I am now in Revelation chapter since last Sunday we were talking on the plague field we're still on the sixth seal let's read this and then we'll get in to read another scripture about how this unfold and to go back just a minute remember that that we as the bride of Jesus Christ his Gentile bride gone at this moment okay she's gone she's out of here she then he's being glory she's in the wedding supper she's in wherever we are and that's okay I'm not worried about that as long as we make the rafter and lonely take a body chain and make a rapture whatever goes on this earth is of no concern to us at that moment now it is now because we watch for the sign but we're not signed seekers are signed followers because remember signs follow the believers whatever we're believing that sign is going to follow us anything that goes on and I don't discount what's going on in the star guy Ryan I did that this morning I looked at that September the 23rd you heard about that September 23rd 2017 virgo is in line with something and Leo the line is on top of her head and there's 12 stars lined up well they go back to Revelation 20 the court says there's 12 stars over the end of the of the one and say that the Rapids with a play September 23rd which is okay will mean but they missed a few key points you see that's what we have a profit come and tell us the little vivvy points of things that has transpired in the Word of God before that happens so I'm not worried if it happens in that just be ready to be ready them be ready because remember I was saying about this other day you know you got five wise virgins in there five foolish burden now remember the five foolish virgins look up the five wise virgins remember the Bible says they came looking and said give us of your oil things you were to go then you were to go to get the oil again alright so remember they're lighted one out both says their light went out the lowest by a Buddhist verdict that we're virgins for against to the Word of God alright five wise bird and had oil in their lap the type of the Holy Ghost right alright so they know to come in a look where to look for that that's why you see a lot of people now I call it jockey em they're they're the Baptist's or you know they're they're tired of what's more linear denomination and the message this is tired what's going on their denomination is there now they got independent churches and now they got worship centers and now they got there they don't name it Baptists Methodists meanwhile because they're missing the piece they're missing a piece of the puzzle when witness when all the believers are taken away will there be anyone left enter the believer plus another path the foolish curve you will be left they are believers because all the believers the those that faith that all that are gone hoarding it don't what about them would be destroyed wheelchair that's right done mile road we're in another dimension we just step over the other dimension called heaven and we wait to say how's that we hung back okay now but we've got happening this is actually going on we can't discount this something to happen so something's going to happen all the way to the new city comes down to Revelation what is it 22 the new city comes down there's things going on right that we need to look at while we're here because what this does then to me that's why I see that the seven sealed book is a book of redemption so there must be something my brother they was talking about that fell and has to be redeemed back to a position and if you listen to me this afternoon we'll kind of try to help a little bit more I saw something else Wednesday night while go to the old oppression that may help us a little bit more in the connection between the Genesis 1:26 man and the two lives that we've been talking about but it should bring us into the lake or not a conclusion but a connection okay it's connect our way back because we got lost what do you mean by lost what's lost Locke means you don't know where you at a lot of it you don't know where you go until somebody comes up and says hey I know you're lost I see that you're lost and I am the way the truth and the life so Jesus is going to have to come and show you and he will never show you wrong how in the world would a what a great God takes up wrong he's not false God and he's a true God the faithful and true witness alright not to be able was false but it has a true sound when you when you tune a piano it doesn't have a wrong sound but you get to a point where it's perfect has a true sound to it and when you hit that whatever that is it rings the same and that's what we're looking at our problem is is we give a little off-key we hit a lofty and we start ringing over this lamb because now this is the way this way so okay Johanna can you find the place okay oh that's a good thing right there yeah so the sealed and I want to bring something else to in a few weeks when I get back from Oklahoma brother jokes going to Sunday school next Sunday but I'll be an Oklahoma next that weekend so we'll even wins them are in we're going to Kansas for a couple days to be friends out there and we're going to brother closet until the next Tuesday so we'll be back church next week when you eat so but we're working on something that really I believe it will help us see where all this come together because I involved in the least allowed and talk to people they realize one thing's for sure then people have been either not talk or they not listen or they just don't listen that there's no hold understand because listen brother Brown said we are a what we are a prophetic people and it requires a study it doesn't require that you brain-dead Lee don't look that were to walk into Church and set that thing you got to use your human brain to filter some of this but you don't use your holy goat right but why problem is is we just go to church so it's automatic it's not all the man not trying to teach you something I told you if you want to work out of here he put it on the door says it has a lot of do clubs all make you here right all right so that's just that's the way I see it that's the way I need it I need this you know I I think stay out of Sunday I think stay out early 90 finally gone somewhere you know with me well and I do we go to church somewhere yeah I agree cuz I need some fuel because during the week you get all that credit of the word all da yen all right all that but this is to help you get over threat all of you you start for the word you got that money you just all right now if you're not remember if you don't need for two days you're what yeah we know you're on under you pass under he was hungry today so with it you're famished your your your wander gobble food you don't care what it is either yeah right yeah but we know that when we have the true tuning fork what we're talking about the word then then we know that that's true but we've got what we're talking about most people just think that seven seals open in 1963 and that's it the whole Bible has to be revealed not just the seven seals but that seven sealed book was a book of redemption so the only thing I can put if the property God told us he said he said that the thunders will I be the revelations contained in the sealed these divinely revealed Institute's will what literally turn us back so the problem is is we have a gun into the thunders we're introduced the surface of reading the loud man read your Bible for years and thousands of years Matthew 28:19 repenting about doesn't follow simple ago okay and then here you've got like both angle your legs well that you know I don't think you need to be taken out of the book what Jesus is saying and he's telling us how to do come father's not a name sons not a name oh those my name then you come out of computers as keys to the kingdom I thought about the other day you know Peter people's give the teams to the king right right whatever you said whatever you know where what have you even let down there I'll click up there whatever you find out here I'll bind them up there all right but now where is that key to Peter when he got crucified and died do you take the key with him did Jesus specifically just give it to Peter our need to give it to the spokesman of the church wondered at Pentecost acts 2:38 to turn the key that I believe now that you and I are the same way yeah whatever you buy underwear cause remember brother Brown remember have to dream about binding the devil you bind me by the word you can't find the devil by being a human you have to find the devil by the Word of God Jesus bounded that well by the Word of God it is written it is written it is written and we're the last with the devil we need already let me start you can help us prove that but these seals then to me the seventh seal is a seventh seal book of redemption he's going to be talking about the breach later on and that's where redemption you see that the lamb comes and takes the book out of the hand of the one sitting on the throne all right and then everybody starts for Georgia then in Revelations 10:1 we see the mighty angel come down from heaven in TQ well now from heaven with the book open right and an open book means that we can go through that book it's not closed anymore we can go through that book and then actually John ate that book John being south deprived Jonah ate the book and it became a part of John you never saw that book anymore until the white throne judgment that boot comes back again tonight so it's not a literal book it's you I can read you like a book your life is an open book see so you're reading epistle known and read of all men so see we're we're we're not literally writing a Bible you can't write another Bible but we can write our part in the Bible all right then we can see our part so that's why I see the field are there a higher form of justification than we've never seen before a higher form of sanctification there was never seen before because look how special we are the reason we are so stable is this they bring church age 1 through 7 a beat that's the smarter Pergamus tire started still they'll get allowed to step all interpretation revelations to even the loudest interchange come under the what the new birth that was all it was required yes we be born you excited we got a brother that's asking the question about a word revival well it's got to be a word revival because we've already been revived when you're born again your revive your you're already Raptor sitting in heavenly places that's what Paul said all right sitting in heaven places in Christ Jesus so your soul has been lifted up out of the age right walking in God while the rest of us are still down the old are full the understanding was just to hear but when we come to them to the layout of seeing church age and then coming out of that way out of the entertain we are the only people that's going to get a revelation of these seven seals how many revelation not do - I can read this it's been written by millions of people it's being read by millions of scholars who has pulled it apart and put these pieces over here but he keeps going here this is going to take that prophetic group now you and I to see what the Thunder was it was revealed under the seal because remember it was something because John was getting ready to write it down now what would John be familiar with that he would want to write it so bad that's your connection because remember revelation 10 John don't write it he was getting ready to start writing down when he saw when the seven thunders uttered ever wanted he saw and began to write remember he was not commissioned to tell what he thought he was commissioned to write down what he saw right joy he wrote down what he saw he was getting ready to write angles it stopped hold that don't write that down so it was it is something and there's only one thing you can write down in a Bible next devote original book of redemption anything has to deal with Redemption you can tomorrow all those that you left to see them you have to see the red line of redemption from out of way we were talking the other day by Cain there's people in this message like the Brotherhood the people this message that do not believe Kane ever had a chance to be saved the Bible tells you had a chance right the Bible tells you that 10 take it back to the pile the Bible's it came if you and it got insane and you're dead you're a son of the serpent in Europe you have no hope no he said if you'll do what your brother did back in other words I'll accept you just as I step they letting out him rejecting it did cause 2 lines to come down very obvious cause the two lines but like we were probably know they you trade the sons of guarding the daughters of man you can't start putting them back together in Babylon and all these things and they just get mixed up if Raley's are marrying this one that's why I got the separator don't you marry people right you stay here and they didn't the Levi's were supposed to stay pure that's why men that we as we see that time that ministers are not supposed to be dull made and I'm going to have a living life they're not supposed to do these things right what this character said why because God will keep that line here and then all right Mayer bourbon is a winner freak so and that means something it's not just written a it means that God wants to keep he wanted a Levitical line under state pure and it did they started just mingling back in together and right now we're just let me sure we trace our lineage back to certain places but but there's only three now challenge a bat hit play I told three we come from all right so there's only three times of people that's kind of playing a three kinds of believers there's three kinds of people you know may believe what I believe are true believer in their camps and Jake that so that's what we all come from everybody you look on Eve you look at all these things no taking three him loosely people you how that all happened I hope one day that God will allow us to set a theater I'm always this is my desire it's a sitteth Pierre in the future home and watch God from creation and watch the whole process come down through and watch how all these things develop well why can't you do that it's already in his mind he came right straight from the vision he had and all he's got to do is televise it don't you make it far off television night television right it says that once once we're with God we showed you calm add God and know all man that's right yes I believe that straight that straight when we see we're so finite we're so limited to this the man we become unlimited you know you you still you know you can go sit on Mars if you want that what are the matter you know you can go do whatever you want to do it like I said it's pretty unlimited but I would still like to sit down and watch like a bad thing it's kind of all the junk you know just but but the jest of the history of how the other thing come down how them free ham Shem Japheth distributed the earth and then you got the black you got the Chinese you've got the Filipino you can ever looking differ from different places and I my theory on that - so lovely so well it's what you even where you live I need the same thing she's for the rest of my life and I will never get black and I can go to Africa South Africa it's full of white people right so white they turn black say something genetically that happened in all that coming down game up boom anybody yeah that's true but I think this is my dog will tell you anyway because if we destroyed ourselves properties also maybe a nuclear explosion men set off a nuclear bomb it tilted the earth and made those quarters of the date come up what if there was radiation and this group of people went this way there was more radiation completion I'm not saying anything different what the Prophet said but you can't when I started as a babies you can't feed me soul food and meat are black right are you see me well I didn't say this Allah people putting energy you know someone's in here so it can't be juhi I mean how can a tiny de like this and it be because of worries limit you know there's nothing genetic don't know I am I'm here oh you're going to the kids and fifty was also to put yellow wire lay that way in everybody else is not going go over there and I married a Chinese and mais no turning your kids was not all of them somehow my genes so well for finance leaders blizzard hit really what that got to do is I'll have a place but you know what though it is doesn't tell me one thing that God is opening our eyes to everything they even here that will be aware of the things that are going on around us and know that we all come from one blood take all our blood together and it's already you know I'm not raising such as I know them through five I'm not saying that I'm just standing we are separated viable a certain way and character Indy but you know what that hair three she had two children daughter shows he had Chinese bride Filipino bride blackbriar qua pride I'll bribe to him all the great colors in the flower work okay so now let's go to the six table club we are still called my danger but we saw the fifth seal showing grace and I love what year what brother Brady said no today now these guys have come right in and just slid right in under everything we've been teaching yeah have I got everything everything has been exactly so we really know the son of man person role eleven not anybody eat them right in there Rob with a new brother Brady remember what he said he said that lamb was justified yeah he said that lamb didn't do it it wasn't just a problem like we did it now God forgive occasion he wasn't a lamb did I'm not like a little baby lamb to love sacrifice and lamb didn't do anything that lamb had no sin all right so what's our role with our problem you know our justification is cuz we did all this that Lambs justification is he never did it he's ever did in the first leg that's where we're coming to this pit filled you in glazed eyes never sinned we're going to get to that this afternoon bro they'll be talking about the mind of God we're going to we're going to get up in that and take a look at this afternoon and I'll be held me and over the seats filled it was a great earthquake know what's going to happen DS all things are going to happen naturally this is a natural occurrence right our nature occurrence and the Sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood starts with having fell into the earth and even as the fig tree casts her untimely figs when shaken of a mighty wind and having part of the scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places it's just every island so this is a worldwide event that's going to happen alright and they came to the earth and the great man's rich man chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountain and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand now the problem with these people are is this is just like a little bitty pre-tribulation thing comes about Armageddon genome is 1,250 days actually probably so preaching okay so let's go now to revelation 11 different and see how there's a note because this deal six deal is going to open in its natural form while the two prophets are on the earth while Israel is getting their Redemption 144 Valerie and it was given to me a read on the garage the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God the altar and them that worship therein but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not pretty given unto the Gentiles in the Holy City shall they tread under foot forty and two months now we know to the study of the damned 70 weeks 42 months that is 40 to 30 day months not 28 30 31 prophetic calendar the prophetic calendar is always 30 days in the month alright so that's how you get closer to you today because about blood but you can take 42 months times 32 or 31 or 28 or we're all that stuff but God told her if he's always perfect that moon comes in just about right on time and it will be but the earth wobbling so it's it's welcome to have that occurrence tomorrow because remember tomorrow night everybody's gonna season five of those you're doing then earth wobbling back and forth you only comes here by two minutes in certain places you're gonna 30 seconds in certain places and we are in the travel path of it so we're going to get two minutes of Darkness so why because everything's you know everything topsy-turvy and I will give power unto my two witnesses they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore with three scores what three times 260 1260 days clothed in sackcloth these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth and if he may will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemy if the ax man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed these have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy and have power over waters to turn them to blood this my viewers all plagues as often as they will okay so but the problem is is the people the Arabs not will leave alone they're going to try to figure out a way killer don't you worry they don't figure out a way he'll okay go they're going to torment this earth for 42 months but now somewhere in there they going to call out a hundred forty-four thousand they were preached a gospel to them and I don't believe there will be the only one preaching the gospel because I believe that they can and it's a certain once and they'll give the gospel out to you I understand that same way we are now English men forever and ever but God has two conduits that he's coming down through profits to problems he's coming down through the spirit of Moses and fear of Elijah right because because of the characteristics who's just ahead with a Rehan for three and a half here United he was trying to River to blood Moses my German so not the two literal people but the spirit of Eliezer the spirit of Moses on those two people on those two prophet and they help fire them whenever they won't do they call earthquakes whatever they wanted so what do we see now we come up to the place tonight I haven't ever included this before but we are taking inclusion disposing work that's what it is they're speaking the word that is inside their heart okay because we must come to that there's the third pole there's the what man has been waiting six Adam Adam has the spoken word I would speak that dream you can talk this one he say the movement here you do this and then Jesus Christ the spoken word in himself this isn't it same thing peace be still you know water to wine all these different things that he's done which was all in natural occurrence Jesus never created anything right he always use what we call ready creates our and there's a thought behind that we'll leave it for a minute they're closing words so we see that through tooth profits there will be a nature cleansing of the world because what's his heading toward according to Daniel seventy weeks and the Bible is heading towards battle Armageddon other than let me feel them getting okay it's headed toward the Battle of Armageddon right we leave we leave there's one week left for the Jew right we're in 2070 weeks and in the midst of the week this guy's going to come the contract of the sacrifice are the because he's gonna cut that covenant off boy he's gonna kill these big profits well then you're going to start the battle Armageddon which is going to be under man killing each other atomic explosion so how do they do with this he's going to fight for his rule about sex but he's not going to store the world man to destroy the world if I got that watch this is over we're all going to come back for a thousand years and I don't see that everything is going to be totally annihilated I believe the buildings will still be here do you think we'll be here because the propagate floated under to everything right judge the stores people they got involved now it just kills people needs the building's huge drug problems neutron bomb exactly so mad man is going to kill each other then they'll leave the building there and now see that's where the difference in that in the future home is because then there's a Battle of Gog and make up we're all sold or killed that are that are evil what Windows went all sold repeal and then there's a city in revelation 22 it's coming down out of heaven then we're going to live in now they won't be that's not a city that was built by man alright that city Jesus is I go to prepare a place for you know hammer nails but I'm going to bring a city and the properties God thank God for a man liking the - dog told us he said he is going to build that city by your design your desire there's a bride of Christ he's going to build it by your desire so my desire of a home is going to be right there that's how much he thinks about us okay a man ain't created anyway wants to but he's not he's going to create about your desire he's your house and your little Avenue and your little lark is going to be which isn't the way you like it cuz you know what you better like it yes what daughter saw it symbology well that City came down he's all people in it because remember a city is just building what is Gainesville Georgia what is Lila Jordan is not the building it's the people in them if there was nobody here with me see the city has always been the people some John sees the bride I'm sure white robes don't everybody coming down and settling down on the earth and there's your pride sitting as a bride adorned for her husband after all this ordering this we going to create children like proof there's a boy child or dogs Katniss they don't be a whole thing will be a whole create procreation or creation after we get out after we get when you get a glorified body there's no more there's no more desire where I see I want it in my brain Alice afternoon hour Coraline was killed me and say our Karl the carnality of our thinking you and I listen every person on this earth whether you like it or not except one man was born to a carnal conception carnal conception but the desire we're all adults a desire of sex between a man and woman right even if you were artificially inseminated it was an act yeah why did Jesus not have a car line he did not come through a carnal daddy and a carnal one right we all came to a carnal daddy in a carnal month whether they're born in era they still had the carnality of having that relationship that should have never happened in the first one okay if I got that though one man yes why was period white had no sin in other words what he didn't have any nature to lean back oh that will solve everything following never a problem at the Polynesian we may talk about a little bit more this afternoon that pollinators what skills yeah that nature their mama and daddy because of their carnality listen that's why you know the age of accountability it's about 12 13 14 years old some more some less why is that you become more sexually mature yes Frank start thinking about things dating when he was a kid black girl about that you're like I said you put a five-year-old one - girl - bathtub and they just play house in town there's no problem don't put this in your old girl in 50 year old after the other they'll be well they'll be playing with the rubber ducky will be go what train to people trained to be Saints people under a more effective why there's some development in the Carl mind that's why the purity I love the purity of children I love the purity of innocence of children and anybody takes that away on and have their head chopped off yeah I meant but that while that is is what that's what it's supposed to have been the innocence crime the man yeah we we couldn't do that cause there wasn't you couldn't do it count to death you know you we populate dying repopulated when that city come down to revelation 22 that's all that God ever saw in his mind it was issue and that's all he needed because all he saw it was continuing so the Jesus Christ coming to fulfill prophecy and save mankind without a carnal attribute so the anti carnal cat rebuke in Babylon he threatened it as Egypt about worshipers I'll let a they worship the carnal and then we are to worship the knock card we'll see we're not this far from truth and error is only this far far back because we're supposed to make love in Jesus - right but not with our that you aren't that one gram okay what in our soul in our be we're supposed to make love to Jesus Christ just like the man longlegs left but not the way you see when I say that you went straight to two parts one part man part these as you know is what that's they out of the mouth now if your spoken word is the original seed may I love that program to priest out a hundred more times the spoken word here's the original thing the main he did not freak them out he's a great pilot but the spoken word is the original seat that's correct right it's not it's not that's what I mean though see see you can take example of our human growing up and you can type it as your newborn babe in Christ but you can't have it all the way because one thing pops up car one God never had a carnal mind Jesus never had a car model okay and it was the same but when he came down here he's never had coal mine because what we do is what our problem a car line is the intimacy the somebody else's car lies is the image of the car well okay that's the problem what we see face bills metal here does having to do with it well we memory reason conscious reflection and imagination that the playground that we have to deal with but through what but then God though takes that carnal mind until tall through the whole goat that we must have in mind Christ okay so there's your mind coming in and overlaying and killing that old nature you're out listen my blokes God loves your if you're born again he loved your nature whether you like it or not there's a part of God that he likes the God part not the human part you got heart right because I'm going to tell you something Daniel and I are not going to be in heaven sent over the corner like maybe sister Barbara sitting is that a free words in 10 years you slip I knew you're thinking no we're going to watch we're going to but you don't hear us in other words just a barber you may have to get real close to here you know but that's your nature that you know what I love that yeah that's not a flaw it's not a flaw here we have laws but when you have to look and see that what God puts together let no man see if you say well I've got to do with marriage well are we we're in Christ what do I push together between him and the bride there's none of our business he's going to use that for some purpose and we need to deal with that you know I don't I don't deal with the department all for being quiet but then I always say well I wish I was just quite a turn no I don't I bus I'll be going I'll be like this Stay Puft Marshmallow Man I'll explode all over boy yeah what those buggers you don't know what to say Louis you watch that this your mark I'm sorry okay many might see the waggly where the carnal line now but less but this book will happen the bank when they have finished their problems you would get back to them when they have finished and when they shall have finished their testimony the Beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which spiritually called Sodom and Egypt where our Lord was crucified and they are the people and Cameron incomes the nation's shall see this is the only age as you can see CNN will be there Fox News all those news people will be there with camera hey this this to go warm it into world for two and a half years three right here they're going to be so happy what they are rejoiced and made merry Wow because these two people are land dead in the in the city you see how perverse that's going to be how the whole world's going to give gift that back to the old car like you some I built a kitty you know an angle a conquerer play this thing guess all days away I'm talking that's in gifts and all these things and those little things that they wore around our head or I have that all knit something it's a carnal yep well they're only giving gifts too but look what happens they're going to get a big surprise the commentator is going to come in one day and they're going to be gone or they go stand up on their feet and great fear fell upon them which saw them they heard a great voice from heaven saying to them come a pillar their city doesn't heaven in the cloud their enemies to be held in this is the same error was a great earthquake tenth part of the city fell and here we go right back again with that cycle goes over again of what a nature cleansing so that Sunday no no next time the next Sunday we're going to talk about this right here a nature cleansing so that won't mean you need on just we were just going to carmine we need that Clinton we need to go or bless
