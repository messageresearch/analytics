[1:07] you want me to say how can I say it you
[1:10] put it all together so that's what I'm
[1:12] praying this morning the Lord will do as
[1:14] we talk about financial Jubilee part 13
[1:18] debt free heyen and I was you know
[1:21] thinking this morning you know um as I
[1:23] was praying just kind of preparing you
[1:24] know I thank God that he he made me free
[1:27] you know he paid a price for me when I
[1:29] was um 21 years old uh when I accepted
[1:33] that uh and um freed me from habits from
[1:38] send what I thought was Freedom you know
[1:39] I thought it was free I thought I was
[1:41] free especially growing up in this
[1:43] message I thought I was free to listen
[1:44] to what I wanted to listen to do what I
[1:46] wanted to do hang out with who I wanted
[1:48] to hang out and man I I remember coming
[1:51] into what I thought was that type of
[1:53] Freedom like man I'm getting older I'm
[1:54] getting I can do what I want to Dad is
[1:57] not as strong as he used to be you know
[2:00] hey we can we can handle this you know
[2:04] and um certainly that sin just started
[2:07] accumulating and um but God but God Amen
[2:12] he made the difference all all
[2:15] together all right it's my first time
[2:17] using this so let's see if we can get
[2:20] this
[2:23] going all right
[2:26] so you know we have talked about you
[2:29] know we spent a lot of time on financial
[2:31] Jubilee so I I hope and pray that you
[2:32] have been working on it you know and um
[2:36] pressing on I've enjoyed the testimonies
[2:38] that I've gotten from from some of you
[2:40] the victories that you've had and um I
[2:43] thank the Lord for that you know and I
[2:45] also heard some of the struggles that
[2:46] some of you have had but I like to say
[2:48] now I'm not the debt
[2:50] police so no tickets coming from me but
[2:54] I do hope through the word of God that
[2:56] you can see something that will give you
[2:58] the inspiration that you need on this
[3:00] journey the word says for which of you
[3:02] intending to build a tower sth not down
[3:05] first and cth the cost whether he has
[3:07] sufficient to finish it less happily
[3:10] after he has laid the foundation and is
[3:12] not able to finish it all that behold it
[3:15] begin to mock him saying this man begin
[3:17] to build and was not able to
[3:20] finish my my my so it's counting the
[3:23] cost counting the cost to everything
[3:24] that we do you know and building on that
[3:26] Foundation that God has started in your
[3:28] life you know when God got a hold of me
[3:31] you know I I didn't understand
[3:32] everything and still continuing to learn
[3:34] because we're building something in this
[3:35] day we're building something you know
[3:38] it's not just God getting a hold of us
[3:39] and that's it he's building something in
[3:41] in us all of us and we have to take our
[3:44] time we got to slow things down I like
[3:46] to think of our Prophet you know we
[3:48] talked about the uh the Indian hunter
[3:50] that he was hunting with and brother
[3:52] Brenham was real hyped up you know
[3:53] trying to get to the top of the mountain
[3:54] where the elk was that's what he wanted
[3:56] to get there and the Indian was saying
[3:59] you know you got to slow down Down Slow
[4:00] Down slow down and brother Bren like oh
[4:02] we got to keep going he said he slowed
[4:03] down a little bit the Indian was saying
[4:05] that was still too fast he said he
[4:07] started walking the Indian was like
[4:09] that's still too fast and brother
[4:11] Brenham I love to hear him say he said
[4:13] the elk is up there that's what he told
[4:15] the Indian and the Indian told him
[4:17] they're El born there they've been
[4:22] there and he said you know what that he
[4:24] had some right truth in that and he told
[4:26] him he said look the Indian said you got
[4:28] to walk him once to look nine times amen
[4:31] and that just tells us to slow things
[4:33] down you know our life can get so out of
[4:36] CA cater we get into chaos and sometimes
[4:40] it becomes like you can't undo it but
[4:41] for the grace of God so we have to slow
[4:44] down we don't have to be in a rush with
[4:47] the Lord that's one wonderful thing
[4:48] about the Lord and we can learn what he
[4:50] wants from us to build on this
[4:52] Foundation that he has for us you know
[4:55] we're building something in the Lord you
[4:57] know we know the precious promises that
[4:59] he has for us we're building towards
[5:01] something and we have to learn how to
[5:04] build as we talked about last time
[5:06] counting the cost and um go back and
[5:09] listen to that you know planning your
[5:12] spending being slow enough to understand
[5:14] it and the world is designed to make it
[5:16] very complicated you know but a simple
[5:18] plan I talked about last time if your
[5:21] cash and your money is out of C there
[5:23] simple way get the cash out the bank put
[5:26] it in an envelope for the categories of
[5:29] EXP expenses that you have take the cash
[5:31] out of the envelope when the envelope is
[5:33] empty stop
[5:35] spending man if you did that from when
[5:38] you were young my my my but see that's
[5:41] how simple God is with his word it's a
[5:43] very simple plan but the Devil comes
[5:44] along makes things very complicated
[5:47] makes it very complicated and God wants
[5:49] us to rest in the Simplicity of his word
[5:52] that's his desire to rest in the
[5:54] Simplicity of his word but we have an
[5:57] enemy that we have to fight that's
[5:59] bringing all kind of different voices
[6:01] different conversations different
[6:02] thoughts that's his goal to try to bring
[6:04] along something that's more complicated
[6:07] until you get lost in it but remember
[6:10] that plan remember a simple plan
[6:12] anything that works that allows you to
[6:14] not spend more than you make is the
[6:16] start of the journey when you're talking
[6:18] about money that's the start of it I was
[6:20] telling the kids the other day you know
[6:21] and I'm sure I've said it before you
[6:23] know I I was 16 years old went into I
[6:25] think it was JC Pennies or Sears they
[6:27] had a $250 VCR I didn't have a dime but
[6:31] they told me they have credit cards I
[6:32] was like okay I signed up told me you
[6:35] are approved man I felt like oh my
[6:39] goodness I am growing up man I brought
[6:43] that $250 VCR home oh man I thought it
[6:46] was golden I don't know what happened to
[6:48] it but I don't know if I paid it off but
[6:52] that goes to show that was the devil's
[6:54] tactic getting me started in the wrong
[6:56] direction right so you know why
[6:59] Financial Jubilee you know what why how
[7:03] hearing recognizing and acting that's
[7:05] what it's about you know and I I always
[7:07] talk about financial Jubilee and you
[7:08] might say John what why you know you you
[7:10] seem to bring this all the time because
[7:12] I think it's something that we spend all
[7:15] our life dealing with and I think if we
[7:18] can see what God is trying to say in it
[7:20] then we can see it in the bigger picture
[7:22] I think young people can see it old
[7:24] people can see it middle-age anybody can
[7:26] see it and you can see what God is
[7:28] intending for for us and we can learn
[7:31] how to fight on this journey of money
[7:33] and with the greater things that God has
[7:35] for us so Financial Jubilee when the
[7:37] trumpet sounded every man could go free
[7:39] if he wanted to go free right so we're
[7:42] free in our finances we're free in this
[7:46] word of God if we want to go
[7:49] free if we want to go free that's very
[7:52] important but we are free and that's the
[7:54] message that God is telling us that
[7:56] we're free you know and I think God has
[7:58] done something very special in this
[8:00] church I mean it's one of the only
[8:01] churches that I heard that the pastor
[8:02] put the church and offered him to go
[8:04] through learning about Dave Ramsey and
[8:06] his teachings and things like that and
[8:08] that to me is amazing so why why God has
[8:11] done this here for this
[8:13] church why because God has a plan right
[8:16] he has a very special plan and we can
[8:19] take that and receive that he wants us
[8:20] to know we're free in all areas of our
[8:23] life why is that important if we can be
[8:26] faithful in the unrighteous thing like
[8:28] money then God will commit to us true
[8:31] riches right amen and that's the journey
[8:34] we want those true riches I mean we have
[8:36] an amazing message with Promises of true
[8:39] riches we see the examples in the word
[8:42] of God we know what God is trying to do
[8:45] he's trying to prepare a bride for
[8:47] himself that we can be so close to him
[8:49] when he comes to give us that true and
[8:52] full Revelation we're that close that
[8:54] the shadow becomes the hand that's what
[8:56] he says right so he's trying trying to
[8:59] prepare us in all areas of our life so
[9:03] we want those true riches that's what
[9:04] I'm after the true riches that God has
[9:06] promised for all of us amen but how are
[9:09] we going to do it I wish it was
[9:12] easy I wish you didn't have to train and
[9:14] I wish you didn't have to fight but you
[9:17] do and that's one thing being around
[9:19] this message all my life you know I I've
[9:21] seen two sides of it there's one side
[9:23] that's talks about this rest and it
[9:26] almost feels like you don't have to do
[9:28] anything
[9:29] you don't have to do anything but rest
[9:32] but I can tell you if you're thinking
[9:33] about rest in that way you're thinking
[9:35] about the world side of rest this is not
[9:37] a cruise ship as brother Wade always
[9:40] says it's not that kind of rest where
[9:42] you put your feet up and hey God is
[9:45] going to get me out of all of this I
[9:46] don't need to learn anything my my my
[9:50] you are in a world of trouble no you
[9:53] have to train and you have to fight amen
[9:56] and I learned that after coming to this
[9:58] word after being free from my sins there
[10:00] was a lot and still a lot I have to
[10:02] learn right every day training and
[10:06] learning we have to train and we learn
[10:09] have to learn and our Prophet says and
[10:11] so an Army first in getting ready for
[10:13] battle first they've got to be selected
[10:15] some soldiers they've got to be dressed
[10:17] for fighting they've got to be trained
[10:19] for fighting amen that's him telling us
[10:23] that we've got to be trained we got to
[10:25] be dressed and guess what you've been
[10:28] selected right you all have been
[10:30] selected for this battle so we can train
[10:34] amen now there is a rest there's a rest
[10:36] in God's promises that's where we're
[10:38] resting and believing but we have to
[10:41] fight our way through this world and
[10:42] become Overcomers in this world but we
[10:46] do believe in his word as the rest that
[10:47] is the rest that it's talking about but
[10:49] not on this life's journey no no no it's
[10:52] a fight every day all the time
[10:57] amen and the word says let be glad and
[11:00] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[11:02] marriage of the Lamb is come and his
[11:05] wife has made
[11:07] herself ready she's prepared she's
[11:11] gotten herself ready what God brings in
[11:14] your path he wants you to learn and grow
[11:17] and to overcome and to make yourself
[11:20] ready praise the Lord Jesus amen I just
[11:24] want to pause and thank the Lord for
[11:26] something my wife and I you know it was
[11:29] uh years ago that she made herself ready
[11:32] just this week she made herself ready to
[11:34] be my bride I wasn't there she was
[11:37] staying with her mom in the hotel and
[11:38] getting prepared and I thank God I want
[11:41] to just recognize the lord gave us 25
[11:43] years of marriage
[11:46] amen praise the Lord Jesus that's his
[11:51] grace and uh we both come from broken
[11:53] backgrounds and uh you know all the
[11:55] stats are stacked against us tell you
[11:57] they stacked against us but not with him
[12:00] that's right amen but we have to
[12:03] overcome amen both her and I we fight we
[12:07] try not to fight each
[12:09] other but we fight we fight to overcome
[12:12] all of the train all of the the garbage
[12:14] the background all of the strains it's
[12:17] almost like a daily thing we deal with
[12:19] because it's in us you know we've seen
[12:21] it we've seen family members walk away
[12:23] marriages broken on all sides that's
[12:25] what we' see that that's almost normal
[12:29] exactly so by God's grace we're creating
[12:31] new patterns by his grace so I'm
[12:33] rejoicing in the fact that the lord gave
[12:35] me 25 years of marriage that's his grace
[12:38] Amen to have done that and that's
[12:41] everything see we are indebted because
[12:43] of our past you know not just my parents
[12:46] they come with a history with a bad
[12:49] history past we all come from that
[12:52] history coming on down coming on down
[12:55] strains jeans all this stuff all the way
[12:57] back to our mom e
[13:00] all the way back all of us and that's in
[13:02] us and that's what we're trying to
[13:04] overcome in this hour all of the things
[13:07] so when we get born again that's the
[13:09] beginning that is the beginning you're
[13:11] now entering into the fight to
[13:14] overcome Amen to rest in his word but to
[13:17] train and learn and apply it to make
[13:20] ourselves ready amen for that hour that
[13:22] we know we know we're that close to so
[13:25] it's time to get ready in all areas of
[13:27] our life amen AB amen that's why this
[13:31] this one scripture means so much to me
[13:34] clean your lives up pay your debts oh no
[13:37] man Jesus says get all things off your
[13:39] hand get everything right Make Ready Get
[13:44] Ready remember in the name of the Lord

[13:49] time is now to make ready get ready
[13:52] clean your lives up heyen get it to
[13:55] where it's simple enough that you can
[13:56] have this this peace in your life to
[13:59] serve God to ask him Lord reveal more to
[14:01] me and you have some space for him to
[14:04] reveal more to you amen we need that
[14:07] space amen not only all of the negative
[14:10] stuff that's been stacked against us but
[14:12] think about the things that we should be
[14:14] building on Amen all of the history
[14:18] everything has come down to this hour
[14:21] all of the wisdom all of the word our
[14:23] Prophet his message all of it has come
[14:26] right down to today amen we've never
[14:28] been here today any of us but here we
[14:31] are with this revealed word these
[14:33] promises all stacked amen that we can
[14:36] take advantage of heyen I told you last
[14:38] time as I'm building on my family and
[14:40] where my dad comes from and slavery my
[14:42] granddad was a slave and we're building
[14:44] on all of that amen so when I see God
[14:47] moving it gives me strength that I don't
[14:49] have to go out and apply for this debt
[14:51] and get this debt and do this no I
[14:52] already got so much Lord let me handle
[14:55] these great things that you've already
[14:56] given me the fact that I have a wife for
[14:59] 45 years Lord let me handle that let me
[15:00] enjoy that by your grace why don't I
[15:03] need a car on debt when I have this when
[15:06] I have kids that are doing the best that
[15:08] they can by God's grace and they still
[15:09] there they still listen they still want
[15:11] to be home praise God lord Jesus I don't
[15:14] have time to sign up for this or that
[15:16] this debt no Lord I have time to get on
[15:18] my knees and pray for my children I
[15:20] don't need anything complicated in my
[15:22] life I need it as simple as God can have
[15:25] it so I can make ready and get ready and
[15:27] that's what we all need to do make ready
[15:29] get ready we know something is happening
[15:32] but the devil has so many things around
[15:34] us that we're so crowded and clouded
[15:37] that we can't get to that freedom that's
[15:40] right amen but God wants us to be free
[15:43] amen and that's why I believe our
[15:44] Prophet brought this say pay your debts
[15:46] get it right Make Ready amen and i' say
[15:50] come on you got something to do God just
[15:52] don't poke things down your neck you've
[15:53] got to believe it you've got to do some
[15:55] fighting see that's the fight the fight
[15:58] to believe it you're fighting to believe
[16:01] these promises that God has given us and
[16:03] I believe that after you fight God gives
[16:05] you things to let you see yes he's at
[16:07] work so I'm a firm believer if you apply
[16:10] these financial principles you see God
[16:12] working he starts stacking and you start
[16:14] saying oh Lord you are true you're true
[16:16] to all your promises amen that's what I
[16:19] tell my kids and my son and seeing him
[16:22] see God moving his life I'm like praise
[16:23] the Lord so you sing you sing the world
[16:27] is a liar the dev devil is a liar God is
[16:30] truth he wants the best thing for
[16:32] everybody he doesn't want you to have
[16:34] the broke downam things and everything
[16:37] oh bro that's not his goal his goal is
[16:39] for you to have the best as long as you
[16:41] can manage the best for his glory that's
[16:44] his desire but we got to believe it and
[16:47] we got to fight to keep that type of
[16:50] mentality remember the principles God
[16:52] owns it all he owns it he controls it he
[16:54] provides it do we believe that do we
[16:57] believe that he really owns it he
[16:58] controls that he provides it if we
[17:00] really believe that then we should never
[17:02] have to enter into debt we shouldn't
[17:05] have to do that if if we truly believe
[17:09] it now that's not easy in this world I
[17:11] know it's not easy in this world because
[17:14] it says like oh my goodness I maybe it's
[17:18] changed maybe God has changed you know
[17:21] and the world has gotten so complicated
[17:22] God can't deal with it anymore we got to
[17:24] kind of go the world's
[17:26] way do do we think that
[17:29] I used to think that I used to think
[17:31] that I I actually remember coming up in
[17:33] a message home and I had brothers and
[17:35] sisters and not just money but we would
[17:38] talk like you know that you used to
[17:42] could maintain your
[17:44] Purity you used to but it's not like
[17:48] that
[17:50] anymore you know you used to could do
[17:53] these type of thing and keep your life
[17:55] clean but it's kind of too complicated
[18:00] now so we kind of have to compromise a
[18:03] little bit more and go to way the world
[18:06] goes God
[18:10] understands no his word is here the
[18:14] precious promises the true riches that
[18:17] he has for us that hasn't changed that's
[18:21] why you can come along and says Jesus
[18:22] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[18:27] forever letting you know don't change my
[18:30] word is true not to keep you bound but
[18:33] to keep you actually free that's what he
[18:35] wants you to do to see him in
[18:38] everything amen so he's faithful with
[18:41] his part it's our part we run into the
[18:43] trouble we are stewards we got to be
[18:46] diligent we got to be faithful that's
[18:48] what's required of
[18:49] us avoid debt like the curse the
[18:52] blessing of the Lord and maketh with and
[18:53] he added no sorrow with it we have to
[18:56] avoid this thing amen and I don't stand
[18:59] here you know proud I I made many
[19:01] mistakes many and in every way made
[19:06] mistakes amen and I had to learn I had
[19:08] to come overcome I had to grow and again
[19:10] I still learning still
[19:12] overcoming but once I started learning
[19:14] what God wants from us that's what I try
[19:17] to
[19:18] avoid so I know debt is a terrible thing
[19:21] God does not want that for his people if
[19:23] we made mistakes there is a way out and
[19:26] I thank God because this message is
[19:27] packed packed with vitamins to help us
[19:31] get out of things that we get ourselves
[19:33] tangled up into amen praise
[19:37] God no the world is full of
[19:39] advertisements and television radio
[19:41] newspapers and the American people fall
[19:44] for such as that and if the American
[19:46] people fall for such as that amen we we
[19:49] have to learn we got to learn and and
[19:52] and with the word of God and every day
[19:53] he's preaching he's bringing the word of
[19:55] God to us you know it's up to us to
[19:58] apply it okay and then we should be
[20:01] feeling something if we're still alive
[20:04] and that's what I said you know brother
[20:05] Dale bringing the church through
[20:07] financial peace from Dave Ramsey and
[20:08] things like that and you know all of
[20:10] this you know it's up to us to apply
[20:13] it's up to us to say you know what you
[20:14] know I may have made some mistakes but
[20:16] I'm going forward I'm I'm done I'm done
[20:20] I'm done and Lord help me with the
[20:21] mistakes that I have made right okay
[20:24] amen and that's the same thing in every
[20:26] area of your life and everything right
[20:28] you know you make mistakes kids make
[20:30] mistakes all those types of things but
[20:32] you can get to a point by God's grace
[20:33] and say you know what no more no more
[20:36] Lord I'm I'm going to start fighting I'm
[20:37] going to start proving you in your word
[20:40] Lord Lord is your way better you know we
[20:43] we shouldn't be afraid of this word you
[20:46] know I like to tell my wife this if your
[20:49] product is good you don't have to be a
[20:52] worried you know and it seems the world
[20:55] is trying to make us feel worried even
[20:57] for our children as if if what we have
[20:59] is not good it's great it's wonderful
[21:04] you know that is the message that we
[21:05] need to bring that we are free daddy is
[21:08] free and nothing is going to steal my
[21:11] joy okay nothing is going to steal my
[21:14] joy because who gave it God gave it to
[21:16] me that's right so I'm happy yes the
[21:19] only concern I have for my children let
[21:22] me tell you is that they don't get to
[21:24] see the blessings that God has for them
[21:27] that's it right because I know it's
[21:29] better I know it's a better way I know
[21:33] it is the way and Jesus says I am the
[21:36] way the truth in the Life what do that
[21:37] mean in every single thing you're not
[21:39] going to find better advice from God but
[21:42] from God there's nothing you can seek
[21:44] better on how to live how to have your
[21:46] marriage how to raise your children how
[21:48] to walk in this journey from youth to
[21:51] death but through this word of God there
[21:53] is no way there is no better way he's
[21:57] safe and concluding I am the way the
[21:59] truth and the life done deal you can
[22:03] spend your life searching you're going
[22:05] to come right back yes sir so it's up to
[22:07] us as parents or those who are a little
[22:08] bit more seasoned to Hold Steady hold

[22:16] things your children and family oh no
[22:19] let them see Mama and Daddy we good we

[22:41] billions that's how I feel with this
[22:43] journey and this word we have billions
[22:46] why are we
[22:47] worried why but that's the devil's goal
[22:51] to put your word aside your kids don't
[22:53] have nothing to look at you're sad
[22:55] you're down in the dumps I wonder they
[22:57] can walk off somewhere else because they
[22:59] get you caught up in this little twist
[23:01] instead of no Daddy's fine I love you
[23:04] this word is true kids I that's
[23:07] it we happy we enjoying dinner amen
[23:11] praise God we're not down amen we are
[23:14] winning people by his grace we have won
[23:18] through Jesus Christ amen the money God
[23:20] we talked a little bit about this you
[23:22] get your income you you give for tith
[23:25] you should your taxes your
[23:27] living debt
[23:29] that comes in picture on the journey
[23:31] early top section is what we call
[23:33] short-term money plans the bottom
[23:35] section is the long-term money plans and
[23:37] most people never get there because the
[23:39] enemy has a tactic and he tries to get
[23:41] you right there you start living in your
[23:43] debt you start Bal you get right caught
[23:45] up in there and you may spend the rest
[23:46] of your life never able to get to what
[23:49] we call true investing where you can do
[23:51] things with money that's very different
[23:54] right okay and that's the same way with
[23:55] the word of God if the devil can get us
[23:57] caught up and we become ineffect
[23:58] effective in our walk Born Again
[24:00] Believers but ineffective caught up in
[24:03] this trap can never get to the things
[24:05] that God can use you in a way that you
[24:08] may not even can imagine today amen and
[24:11] we have to come to something we have to
[24:13] come to something that God has promised
[24:15] us that we know we're in some type of
[24:17] vow right where we manifest what we've
[24:20] been talking about for years amen amen
[24:23] and that's the same thing with money if
[24:24] we can get through that and avoid that
[24:26] and get out of that then we can get to
[24:28] somewhere with money and again it's just
[24:31] an example of the precious promises that
[24:34] we can get to in the Lord
[24:38] amen God's GPS on Deb he says oh no man
[24:41] but to love one another for he that
[24:43] loveth another has fulfill the law the
[24:46] rich ruleth over the poor and the borrow
[24:48] is servant slave to the
[24:50] lender the Lord shall open unto thee his
[24:53] good treasure the heaven to give thee
[24:55] rain unto thy land in his season and to
[24:58] bless all the work of thine hand amen
[25:01] and thou shalt lend unto many nations
[25:03] and thou shalt not borrow amen look what
[25:06] God intended for the Jews in that
[25:08] scripture Deuteronomy
[25:10] 28 he said hey I'm going to bless the
[25:13] work of your hands he wanted the Jews to
[25:15] stand out as a special people where God
[25:18] is doing the providing and they're being
[25:21] that example that the world can look to
[25:24] and is no different for us today God
[25:27] intends for us to stand out as a special
[25:29] people not caught up with the way of the
[25:31] world showing that God provides right
[25:35] amen showing that we have this joy we
[25:38] have everything we have need of that's
[25:41] what he wants the world to see right
[25:43] amen and in order to do that remember we
[25:45] got to train and we got to fight to do
[25:47] it amen yes
[25:50] sir debt lies the world is full of it
[25:53] visa says it's all it takes Visa also
[25:56] says it's all you need discover says it
[25:58] pays to discover Master Carter you can
[26:01] imagine what that is already about it
[26:03] Masters you am so you have to avoid the
[26:08] way of the world and these are small
[26:10] things now you just get on the internet
[26:12] you can find some of everything my son I
[26:14] we always joke about it now and talk we
[26:16] actually went to a meeting and they were
[26:17] yelling they said OPM that's the way to
[26:20] do it OPM means other people's money you
[26:22] know and they were saying CH OPM OPM say
[26:26] it that's the only way OPM
[26:28] my goodness other people's money so him
[26:31] and I joke about it because now he got
[26:32] some wisdom he's like my goodness I
[26:36] can't believe they're saying
[26:38] that amen so it's full of it and all of
[26:42] the tactics are there the devil's job is
[26:44] to get you looking at one thing that you
[26:46] may lack forgetting about everything
[26:48] that you have right and making you doubt
[26:51] that you can get the things that you
[26:52] lack that's his goal I told him I said
[26:55] hey most of the time and we don't
[26:58] argue we don't hurt about anybody you
[27:00] know we we understand we understand a
[27:04] lot of times we just don't believe don't
[27:06] believe we can get to it don't believe
[27:09] we can save enough money to get to the
[27:10] car that we want we don't believe it
[27:13] maybe God is don't bless me like that so

[27:19] dealer with a loan because I I don't
[27:21] believe for me it don't come that way I
[27:24] got to go this way no don't believe
[27:26] those lies man if you if the devil got
[27:30] that lie then you know God has his truth
[27:32] on the other side and that's where you
[27:34] have to fight to hold on to
[27:37] that all right as we come down I I
