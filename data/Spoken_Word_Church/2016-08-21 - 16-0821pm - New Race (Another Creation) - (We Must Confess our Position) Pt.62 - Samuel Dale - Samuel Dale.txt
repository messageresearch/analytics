«  E-12       †        I've thought this: If I could--could pray and God would do something here in the Supernatural realms to let you know that He was present, and then surely you would take my word for it. See? You'd take my word. And then I'd tell you He was out there and would heal any of you that would confess His--Him to be your Healer.
    Remember, He can never do nothing for you until first, you say He's done it; believe Him, and accept it, and testify of it. Did you know that?
    He's the High Priest of our what? Confession. Hebrews 3:1. Now, He's setting at the right hand of the Father, to make intercession upon our confession. See, we've got to believe it, accept it, and confess it. And He's before the Father to make good anything that we confess in the redemptive blessings, of course.

«  E-7       †        And He now is a High Priest, Hebrews 3, setting at the right hand of God Almighty in heaven, making intercessions upon our confession.
Now, the word used there in the--in the Book of Hebrews is used in the King James Version, is used "profess," but "profess" and "confess" is the same thing. You profess something or confess it, you professed that you believe that He has... "He was wounded for your transgressions with His stripes you were healed." So He's a High Priest to make intercession upon our confession. And He cannot do nothing for us until first we accept it and confess it.
    Now, we could get down at the altar and pray till we were--till we laid on our faces and died. Until we believe and accept His pardoning grace, we're still lost. No matter how loud we could scream, or how long we could stay, or how much we could do without food, until in our heart--the revelation God gives us that Jesus Christ died to save us, and we accept it as our own personal property. It's something Christ did for me, did for you, and to whosoever will b...

might find him amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord you like turning your scriptures turn back where we read this morning to Hebrews to Revelations 3 and then into Romans 8 Revelations 3 Romans 8 remember all the announcements have been made and things and keep a thing in mind keep praying for these that are sick like sister Lora and all and remember the fellowship meeting will be there on the third Saturday in September and remember all the other announcements that have been made the ones that are missing today and the reasons and things just pray that the Lord would would bless each one amen any announcements we need to make oh yes one thing now we're trying to change around downstairs we get everybody while he standing up okay that way you can't claim you ain't hearing uh we're trying to change around things downstairs a little bit to where we can have the Sunday School classes so you'll see a curtain pulled across and you that are late coming in you know you're supposed to come through that other main part of the door not the main one coming up to stairs and to do your thing but make sure you go in there if you got to and be real quiet because they're going to be having Sunday school class just behind a curtain so don't be fooling around in there and I don't understand is why you can't get here before service you know before time and when they announce downstairs that we're supposed to be out at a certain time uh when that Bell Rings you're supposed to be out of there and get gone all right go on to where you're going to and don't hang around and and want to sit there and talk cuz they're they're trying to get get everything in order see we we're not set up in a big place so we have to uh you know the children has to start over here and then they're getting through before the rest of us can be going that way we're not flooding the coming up stars for the bathrooms so that gets everybody kind of in order but if you don't follow it in the other things you'll mess it up and and all like that so just remember that and keep it all kids glasses start 15 minutes all the children's classes start at 15 minutes till 10 getting through 15 after and that way they can get up and then waiting them starts at 15 till or whenever they can get everybody in the room you know but then they they get out and try to get up so remember these things and do it we really enjoy the kids want to give them a good hand we appreciate the kids for their part in the singing in the worshiping things and and praising the Lord okay any other announcement okay Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace and guidance Lord thank you for all things and we pray that you would just bless us now with your presence this afternoon and Lord we're confessing that you're here so we're going to believe that everything will be all right and all the service will be great and it'll all be in your honor and Glory we ask you to just have your way with each one of us remember the sick among us and remember what you said we're just confessing the words you said you said you would send your word and heal us and Deliver Us from destruction so we confess that and father we just thank you and just have your way now in the service remember the sick among us and take away that sicknesses and things because that is part of your atonement guide each one now have your way in Jesus name amen remember remember to pray too for the uh brother Homer Fraser passed away so remember to pray for the family there the Lord would would be with with all of them you know in that time and he's been having a lot of trouble and uh but he's passed on to his reward all right Revelations 3:14 and the angel of the Church of the lady of candr these things sayth the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God all right we go to Romans 8 beginning verse 24 for we are saved by hope now that's not hope like I hope it that's where we read the Bible and we interpret the wording but go back and see what it's saying we're Saved By Faith right all right for we are saved by hope now watch but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why does he hope for for what a man seeth why does he yet hope for it but if we hope for that which we see not see then there is past things there's present things there are things that will come all right all the way through he's covering it but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it we'll get two sicknesses healing you say you're healed sometimes you got to wait right because that's just God's way of doing it okay then he says likewise the spirit also help with our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with gr groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God so you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we were talking about this morning how that we must confess now this afternoon we're going to try to cover over into the point and we won't have the questions and answers Wednesday if you want to we'll have them next Sunday if that's fine because we won't have them Wednesday cuz I've got a message that's I've got to put behind this one to bring forth and continue the thought if we get to Wednesday night we will have some questions so have it on your mind all right now what was we talking about this morning according to Hebrews 3 and 1 he is the high priest of our profession all right profession and confession is the same word right all right so he's the high priest now as I said this morning why would the bible say that he's the high priest of our confession why does it say that what does it say he's the high priest of our confession what did it just to say you have a confession and then it says he's the high priest what do you need a high priest for but we got to have one now we we brought it to P I brought it down this morning trying to show the point that heaven is real and it's not just that God is setting up there now and the Bible said as it bring out this morning that he was sitting on the throne you know resurrecting sitting in Heavenly places we're supposed to be that don't mean we're out there does it but it means we're resurrected in spiritually and see he's not just laying up a throne a body no life in it or nothing that's just terminologies as I hope you were catching this morning that to me God is very busy Heaven is a busy Place y all right and if he's making intercession Upon Our confession as I said this morning even if you had you know 100,000 people praying you realize he's making intercession upon 100,000 prayers and he's the high priest of that see we need the high priest because the high priest is the only one that can make the atonement that's right right the high priest now we're talking about the main atoma they were priest that made this and priest that made offerings but the main atonement to Israel was to be made by the yearly high priest all right and see then him being the high priest he was capable of making an atonement amen we say well he made the atonement 2,000 years ago yeah but to him it doesn't matter where it would be 10 million years ago or 10 million years after now he has no time and no thoughts of time all right but my point was this morning that he's doing something amen he's making intercession Upon Our confession amen right right now we're going to deal with a lot brother Brown says this evening that he can't do it until you confess it well you can do anything you want two he's Bound by his word if his word says he can't do it he's Bound by it that's right you want a scripture he said our sins was in the sea of forgetfulness he's Bound by that scripture he cannot bring that Sin from under n amen the blood if it's been put under there he's Bound by his own I've got one in here where brother R said he's bound the we're not just looking at it like a halfhazard thing when God says something it must come to pass but as I saying this morning now the thought was what everything that's in the Bible has been spoke by someone yes writing speaking it prophets talking whatever uh Noah telling about the world and what it would be and and you know anything that you want to relate to it's always been because somebody said it and he's waiting for somebody to say it amen all right now here's the point we'll get to Wednesday night he's waiting on you and I you know that everything waiting on you and I to do what I got to get away but I will make this statement what's he waiting on us to do well we can do this well we can do that we can do that what's he waiting on now if he is the high priest of our confession he's waiting on somebody to confess it and until it's confessed by someone that really has the goods of confessing it it won't never happen that's right we taught the end of the world 50 years ago 50 years ago we were talking about the coming of Jesus Christ I'm just saying in my life in your lives most of you where you were that we were talking about those things but why has it been we've been given 50 years after the going of the Prophet right what's God waiting on okay now if he's making intercession that means he's doing something right right he says he made inter intercession that would be ped right see I'm trying to get you to look at calvary's present tense look at Salvation is present tense it do you no good what good is to talk about a pist that's Faith Builder yes but the pist is not reality to me and you right oh I live yeah yeah okay but you're not getting it God's wanting somebody to stand here now and confess it that he can make it come to P all right now because he's making intercession upon what we confess all right we ended up by saying what can God confess a trinity that was the ending of the message no cuz there's no such thing can he confess that hell is eternal no cuz there's no such thing all right but you know what we used to SAR about it that's right we thought that was what we needed to confess right that's right well I'm I'm just I'm saying you want me to I'm saying what the Bible says God in three persons Blessed Trinity that's not a Bible confession so it must be from somewhere else right am but yet we did do those things right now is it right then what did the prophet say when we read the little quote we won't ask him to do that we're going to jump over about number six but I'll quote a little bit from some of it Hebrews chapter 4 brother randam says hold fight to your confession he said hold fast that don't mean just keep testifying that's what we thought it was right that's right we thought it's just us keep testifying and somewhere down the road God might bring it to F you're not saying what God says God said it's already come to pass see when we get to that reality we're getting to something all right but I'm quoting brother r he said whole F that don't mean just testifying if you don't live the life like pulling it up you don't hold it fast so now he's talking about living the life dealing with holding fast your profession or confession you don't hold it I what does he say you're doing you're living a hypocritical thing all right you better just be on out and just forget it and be a sinner right don't profess a Christian live something else you're the biggest stumbling block the world has ever had so now you know brother randam is not saying don't keep confessing or don't keep on testifying now you know know he's not saying that well brother R I got where he said he said let not testify so I not testify no more uh you know better than that his emphasis is what the life we live shows more than the words we blabber right right I can't hear your words because of your life right all right so then we went on to talk about in Romans where it says for us to what believe in our heart confess with our mouth believe in your heart won't save you right now I'm that's your Bible so it's believe in your heart confess with your mouth God if you won't make a confession and it's sure you you don't have it in your heart you don't have a possession if you're not willing to testify of it but what did he say he cannot save you the Church of the Living God 51 he cannot save you by the merits of your prayer right okay he cannot save you by the merits of your enthusiasm or good works amen he saves you by the merits of your faith in your confession if you will confess man then I'll confess you all right first a believing then a confessing that's the Bible now so we'll go through as we're reading it this afternoon we'll be bringing these things to think about truly believing it it being in real faith and then confessing it all right if you take away either one of them where you at that's right now we're going to have to think a little bit very simple thought but you're going to have to think what's being said all right we left off on this quote this morning right so go ahead to number seven and we'll pick up except God's Gift listen close you'll never live above you this is the quote we read at the end this morning you'll never live above your confession Jesus is the high priest of our confession now get in your mind what I'm talking about if he's the high priest what you say definitely has a lot to do with it sure if you say he's a trinity he can't say that now remember to confess is what somebody else says now well I'm just saying what he said but see he wants you to speak from your own Heart Reading as I said Romans 8 that had been read so much in the Baptist Church I got where I didn't want to read that scripture cuz everybody believed in their heart and confessed it with their mouth but why was it they wasn't saved now you got God's word y That's right then may I quote brother R he said if you can find the promise in God's word he said you can call him on the scene listen paraphrase it but very close he said if he don't bring it to pass you can call him liar right do you need that quote that's very close isn't it can't you see people standing before him one day does it not say that they'll come and say have not even cast out devils and things in thy name what did he say depart from me I never knew you see it's very vital then what we confess amen that's right right if I don't get nothing else you get what I'm talking about you look at the preachers of this message and what they're saying God told them they brother around and said you got your two Souls your two Lords your perus your son of mans you got your your no Holy Ghost doctrines you got uh River Jordans you got all kind of doctrines and each one says God told them that sure you remember I told a brother from Florida that time I said why did them two brothers split they both sat the same thing and I explained what both of them said and he said it's right they both said the same thing and they split the churches split most of this message now which one's right which one's wrong well all right if you don't get the idea you're in bad shape cuz what did he say you'll never live above your confession Jesus is the high priest of our confession is that right now any scholar knows that same word profession is confession to same translated now sitting at the right hand of to the father to make intercessions upon what our confession he can't do nothing for you until you first confess he's done it amen and what is he going to say I'm not saved tonight because I got happy and Shout that is it listen to this one I'm not saved because the gift of God works through me I'm saved because I've met the conditions that Jesus Christ required from me I'm saved according to the Bible and it's not because I feel like I'm saved Satan can whip you and stomp you on your feelings but he can't when it's thus sayeth the Lord well where we going well we don't we don't have thus sayth the Lord only prophets got thus sayth the Lord this right here is thus sayeth the Lord what I read from or quoted read when we started from Romans it says confess with your mouth and believe in your heart you know you shall be saved that's th sayth the Lord but do you believe it that way right do you believe that's thus sayith the lord well see then what's he saying he ain't saying we all got to be prophets and have thus sayith the Lord what is thus sayith the Lord anyway you ever thought about it it's what the Lord says to somebody right it's not what somebody says right is What God Says through somebody is thus sayith the Lord the entire Bible is thus sayith the Lord amen right we just got to get it in the right place okay but what does he say I'm saved because I met the condition that Jesus Christ required from me what does he say he said you must be born again there's a requirement right Paul says what you believe in your heart confess with your mouth you shall be saved H there's your requirements repent everyone and be baptized the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost called it so now you've come to face god with thus sayth the Lord now come on don't you think that when brother randam said what I was quoting a moment ago that if you can bring any promise from God's word to God if you don't bring it to pis he said you can call him a liar now he ain't talking about bringing our ideas to God he ain't coming talking about what we think the second person orders intercede for the first person or the third person could come make it happen no that's not God's confession the main thing to confess is one thing he has already done it right as far as he is concerned this world is already over and he's he's building us a future home that's right right amen that's right okay so then we need to think about it look what he goes on to say now we'll read some let me get a cough drop to get this throat cleared up I was hoping for 3 or 4 weeks without preaching would do it but you know that don't always work but listen go ahead on number8 and let's talk about something remember our whole thoughts that God I started to title it that way I started to say God can't do nothing cuz he can't till somebody confesses it right see the scripture said he's the high priest of our confession now not the high priest of your feeling the high priest of your confession the Hebrews 3 says he's the high priest of our confession so we got the scholars the Greet come down to confess and possess as the sign now he's sitting at the right hand of God to make intercession upon your confession so he's very busy remember whatever you can confess him to be that is what he is and if it's not you're not saying what he says right right confess is to say what the same thing that's right all right see make intercession upon your confession he can't do nothing to you or for you until you accept what he has already done and confess it confess it now you said but but but but you you just bring up things that just confuses me sorry honey I didn't confuse you you was Bor than confused I just exposed your confus right so just think about it then all right but listen go on to number nine which is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever look he's a high priest of our confession therefore he can't do nothing for us until first we confess that he has done it it's not confessing he will the confessing he has done it is present tense not past that's what we think we think it's p sure it's over but it's when you can say the way he says it then it's done right there he goes to work watch can't you just see him I know I know I'm carnal I'm sorry can't you just see Jes Jesus sitting there that ain't no talking about no lifeless body but Jesus is sitting there I'm trying to make an illustration he's sitting there and about that time Al Canard says by Stripes I'm heal I'm the high priest of that and you know what if he believes it it's got to happen right right you don't think like that you think it's all over and he's up there playing bingo or rolling bowling balls and that's why the the thunder goes in the air you know we we don't believe in Zeus and and Thor is the old bowling ball now we believe Jesus is up there oh great my point is to get us to look at one thing God's not back there he's not over there he's right here now amen amen that's right that's right making intercession Upon Our confession then he goes to work when you say it making good what we profess that he has done what and he will make good anything that he included in his atonement right so now listen we don't need to try to think about things that ain't in atonement okay right what are we supposed to come to not we will be or ought to have been but we were past tense already healed God did it back there in Calvary and the only thing we do is reach up and receive it by faith and believe it confess it and you're going to see all of these quotes is going to have that little word confessing and remember confession is to say the same thing but it's to say what somebody else said that somebody else is God Almighty and he's already taking care of it he just wants us to believe it right go ahead to number 10 as I was with Moses 1951 and I tell you he was out there and would heal any of you that would confess him to be your healer remember it can never do nothing for you until first you say he's done it believe it and accept it and testify of it do you know that he's the high priest of our what confession Hebrews 3:1 and he's sitting at the right hand of the father to make intercession Upon Our confession see we've got to believe it accept it and confess it you see if we don't say what he says then he doesn't have to back it up but see we try to get off onto the la la lands of our thoughts you remember the other day when we were bringing out that the disciples found a man doing Miracles there was not one of them and they told Jesus should we go stop him and he said no said because if right if he's not against us he's for us in other words I'm conscious of knowing what he's doing remember our point that he gave the disciples through the anointing to cast out Devils heal the sick raise the dead and you remember the 70 that walked away from him was the ones he was talking to when he said remember your names are written in heaven and the both that seven he walked away there was a lot of people back there had some things going on are you listening there's a lot of people today got things going on because if you can believe what God says and accept it remember the Bible says if you say not if you pray if you say to this mountain don't doubt in your heart remember the original thoughts brother randam had on that that he couldn't explain it Y and he said I'm going to just say that that was before the atonement but then it struck him in matter words before the atonement after the atonement what it was is what God Said but can we believe it oh that was for brother brandham like a big man in this message he said the third pull was for Jesus Christ and brother brandom and not for you and I if I called his name you'd be amazed but I heard him say it or wouldn't say it well I come to find out the prophet said one day that the third pull was for the bride and the church and two the totally lost so you know who I want to believe okay now think about it he cannot do nothing for us until we believe it go ahead to number 11 expectations 61 he's a high priest to make intercession Upon Our confession and cannot do nothing for us until first we accept it and confess it now we could get down at the altar and pray till we were now listen to him till we laid on our faces and died until we believe and accept his pardoning grace we're still lost that's right no matter how loud we could scream how long we could stay or how much we could do without food until in our heart the revelation God gives us that Jesus Christ died to save us and we accept it as our own personal property it's something Christ did for me did for you and to whosoever will believe it then you're saved because you have believed it and you healed the same way all right it don't make no difference what we do until we believe it and accept it the pardoning grace is no good and we know for a certainty then we've got to confess it we don't have no problem or shouldn't have with that Jehovah Gyra number 12 now if the Holy Spirit was taken out of which was taken out of Christ Jesus where his Corporal body sitting at the right hand of God making intercession for on our confession do you believe that he cannot do one thing for us until we confess it now watch you said Brother David you said he was sitting there with him I you better remember I had these notes reading them last night so you ought to pay attention when I make a statement you ought to pay attention he's going to bring that out in a minute and let brother R say it you remember what I said a while ago he's sitting there waiting then when you confess it come on he cannot do one thing for us until we confess it and then he works and he making intercession on our confession he goes to work on that that's right making your confession you're going to find out how important your confession is look at the next one expectation and Leadership of leadings of the spirit is corporal body sits on the throne of God for a bleeding sacrifice Before the Throne of his majesty to make intercessions Upon Our confession he cannot help us until we we confess it first for he's the high priest of our confession now remember the job of a high priest the job of a high priest was not necessarily to raise a lamb he probably never bathed one probably never fed one I'm just make a point okay but one day he took that lamb and made an atonement nobody else couldn't do it that's right and why couldn't anybody else is sincere well I'm sincere God knows my heart I'll just offer my own offering and that wouldn't work I don't care how sincere I grate you thank you you are that wouldn't work right you could get killed out way very easily right see he's the high priest of our confession go ahead number 14 sir as we would see Jesus now the word confess there is the the same word ministers would know it profess it says profess and confess is the same word to profess it is done to profess it was done confess it it come from the same Greek word and we know that we must confess that he has done it and he cannot do it until we confess it then he's the high priest to makeing recessions upon what we confess that he has done for us that makes a faith in a finished work that Christ did for us at Calvary right makes it to a point confess go ahead calling Jesus on the scene 15 Hebrews says there confess high priest of our confession therefore he cannot do anything until first we could confess that he has done it that's right and then when we confess it then he is the high priest imediator to go to work on that and make it right so we pray trusting in God tonight in his kindness and mercy that he will give us his abundance of Grace remember you must accept it must accept it and confess it can I just read a few without if they get them up fast enough I want to read this go to number 15 16 I want to read this one this is second we would you see Jesus every sin in the world was forgiven when Christ died at Calvary okay but what's that got to do with you right what do you mean well he all he wants you to do is believe in your heart and confess with your mouth right that's all he's ask us to do there's a blood atonement on the Altar for the sins of the world but it'll never do you any good until you accept it and confess it he can never work on it until first you say and have by faith Faith accepted it they need a high priest to make intercessions Upon Our confession see he can't move he's bound there's nothing he can do until first you accept it and confess it and from your heart you believe it then it touches him then he can go to work on it and make intercession for you yep so think about it God is bound to the point that he cannot do anything until somebody confesses it you got to believe it and confess it if not he can't make it come to Pi cuz remember the point now if you get nothing listen if he's the high priest of our confession now listen listen the high priest didn't now you got to get the whole story so listen the high priest didn't make an offering just for himself he made your offering sure we know it was for everybody for him and everything but remember he walked behind there and if he'd have been sin in his life he would have died so remember he must have got took care of before he went back there that's right is that all right with everybody see that way he could car it for me and you so it's my confession that he's taking we know for certain God don't need no confession so he's taking what we say however we confess it that's the way it is you see why I fight so hard the doctrinal issues of the message because if that's not saying what brother around said then we don't need to be saying it right right there's a Bible full of truth right why do we need so many doctrines and ideas well you got well come on I've left it open I'm for internet right now come on show me where I've ever taught anything outside of this message show me where I've taught anything contrary to this message now you show me preacher to tell you that and I'll go with you did you see what I said I said you tell me who they are and I'll go with you and we'll see whether it's right or not well let just be if that's sarcasm I'd sure love to have a lot of it right I thought we supposed to believe a prophet I thought he said that he'd be glad to see a day when people would stand up and say you are not saying what Paul said that's right of course you're not popular when you do that oh that's just your opinion but see he cannot do anything that's right until we believe it and confess it and then he goes to work upon what you have need of you have need of Salvation he goes to work on it amen right you remember what we were bringing out this morning we're down to it let's read number 17 cuz that's where we stopped this morning and picked it up look what he says at Thy word Lord I'll let down the net God cannot save you excuse me God can only save you as you testify he can only heal you as you testify he is sitting at the right hand of the father tonight in heaven making intercession upon your profession it isn't how loud you cry how hard you beat the altar how many Good Deeds you do it's your faith that saves you and if you confess it with your lips and coming from your heart and not just say it with your lips I believe it coming from your inner being your soul watch what he said he goes to work as a high priest what's he doing he's going before God and he's saying you know Richard Marlo is down on Earth and he's saying that I'm the same yesterday today and forever right he said you mean and you know where we're going okay I'll give you the last quote okay God is waiting on you and I adoption time so now you see what I'm getting to don't you but if it's not right on the regular New Birth then adoption time won't work either all got to be one thing right listen he goes to work as a high priest sit at the right hand of the father to make intercessions upon your confession Hebrews 3:1 he cannot do one thing for you until first you believe it and accept it and then confess it to be so and the people today they'll go out say well I felt better last night but today I'm not I'm but today I'm so bad I just can't hardly stand it that's just exactly where you lose your confession and drop right down that's why you can be healed today be sick tomorrow with the same thing okay now watch him look where he carries it on too but carry it right now no matter who you are how saintly how Godly you are your minister clergyman or your Deacon or whatever you are are you've been a Christian for 50 years and watch it if you go out of here tomorrow and lose faith that you're a Christian and start to telling people you're not a Christian anymore you're backslid now there's where we ended this morning I believe that a Christian can backslide but that don't mean you're lost cuz that's what he's just bringing you he didn't tell you you was lost he said you backl now if you come to justification you can lose your confession you come to sanctification you can lose your confession but if you come to the New Birth you can't lose that but you can backslide well I don't believe Christian well then okay that's your opinion I do because that way I can keep things straight amen I can keep the man that the prophet referred to him this morning in the Hebrew Book that was a preacher he went out and got him some beer and got drunk and things and all that he took him off scene brother Brandon said God had to take his child home so now you argue with him about whether you backslide or not right I ain't looked up the quotes to see what all of it is I just know that statement is right but if you're just Justified you can lose everything you're just Sanctified you can lose everything when you lose your confession but if you're truly born again you can't lose your eternal life that's my confession because I can't see having eternal life and losing you mean God give you eternal life he going to take it back he going to give it to you again he going to take it back he going to give it to you that's a good Methodist that's a good Methodist Doctrine if you die when you're Sanctified everything's all right I'm making no light watch what he goes WR say now I thought I'd skip it but it's all right I'm sorry look at number 18 which is off the message Jehovah Gyra no matter how much you pray how much you cry how much you agonize how much you do it'll never be accepted that's right well brother Dale you're taking away everything that I thought was the reason I got saved God can do nothing for you until first by faith you accept it and believe it and confess it watch that's the only way God can act now is when you act first you like that one amen when you act first all in our life right cuz he's a high priest making intercession on your confession of your faith in his finished work I don't believe there's anyone could find fault with that I like that one he said I don't believe I can find anybody what all you got to do is believe it confess it saying that it's already done 19 the queen of Shiva no matter how much you pray Let's see we read other St no excuse me okay he can't do nothing for us read up all up and down he's a high priest sitting at the right hand of a mighty God making recession Upon Our confession our profession it's the same word now he can't do nothing for us until we already say that he's done it right we have to Pro confess it or profess it that he's done it then he can go to work on it and make the the intercession now can I stop there and just preach a while you realize what he just said just that one quote that one statement you realize what he said that God cannot do anything until you first believe it except it's for you and confess that it's already done right now may I ask it in this way cuz I got to bring that to bring this when a high priest makes an offering and we're talking about the Old Testament forms right everybody with me yes the Old Testament when the high priest made the atonement it was for the P sins amen that's right there's no Old Testament in any way that talks about it being right there it's pointing out Point remember everything the Old Testament pointed to Jesus Christ amen that's right right nothing there was present tense other for that time when they made the atonement it wiped away the past year never done nothing to the Future right brother Bron says when you come see future home oh he said justification just chops off your P sins he says does nothing to your future now I hope you're going to swaller and listen does nothing to your future sanctification is cleansing setting aside does nothing to your future the new birth cleanses all of that out and puts eternal life living in you now may I say it in my words then there is no future don't worry about your sin there's no future what do you mean just what I say it when you receive eternal life there's no pist right in the SE forgetfulness we agree with that but there's no no future everything's present that's right when you receive eternal life you're just as Eternal as you'll ever be agree that he not trying to make a future right it's good us to believe where we're at right now amen were you following me you go back cover what I've been talking about God cannot do anything for you until you first confess it right well he done it back under what let me ask you a question what good is a god of yesterday what good is a god of tomorrow if there's no God of today do you understand what I'm getting at I'm trying to get us to think about what kind of confession we need to be making that's it right we need to get away from the past right ain't nothing you can do about it right it's done finished y get away from future CU we ain't there yet that's right right get down right now amen we are definitely not talking about Catholicism that you pay so much money and you do certain thing and they'll forgive you of what you're going to do there's no such thing right right he's not going to forgive you or something you do salvation when you receive it does not set you in a category that you cannot never sin that's why it's so careful for us to think Catholicism puts it to work well bless God I ain't got to worry about it I'm born again I can't go to hell what kind of confession is god making remember he's going to confess just what you say what kind of Salvation do you have well it don't make no difference where I sin or not I'm a born again Christian you know what you're proving there you're proving you ain't Born Again does that hurt your feelings well good you can do something about it right I'm not trying to be hateful I'm trying to save your soul you see church he can only confess what we say now if you have missed all this morning and all this evening remember one thing the only confession we can make is that he's already done it it's a finished product all right but his confession is he's already done it he's now revealing it to you and then he will not account sin to you wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait you you you you you just said that one ago but you ain't listening blessed is the man to whom God will what not impute sin now may I quote brother brandham see we think oh it's us we're so good it don't matter what I done he won't impute it now may I quote brother R how many of you remember what he said said he won't impute sin he said there is a man of that person now you're going to automatically say Jesus Christ don't hold on to that that's fine but here's what he said he said he cannot impute sin over the token you know what the word I didn't know I was going this way but you want to quote he can't impute sin over the token that's right you mean that gives me a right to live like the devil no because when you're saying that you automatically met and you don't know where you're at you know what I'm more concerned with my life today than I was 50 years ago when I received the Holy Ghost right at 5040 something you know why because if my savior thought enough to die in my place to save me why would I ever think about what I could get by with how dare that thought enter the mind of a Christian to think you can get by with anything but remember he won't impute it over the token what is the token the the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that right but you see it's so important for us to say the right thing well brother Dale I just I believe that that God and three persons is what it is well God can't confess that so he didn't make intercession right right he only makes intercession when the truth is spoken amen maybe he's not as busy as we think you remember that while ago I was trying to illustrate how busy he is listen to all the prayers maybe he's not as busy as we think maybe he ain't got a lot to do because we're not saying it right you must act first before he can do anything you must say that he's already done it for he's the high priest there to make intercession Upon Our confession of what he has done for us so you see before God can do anything for you you must F you first have to believe it and confess it he cannot work cannot do one thing I tell you no wonder people are scared of Divine Healing I say this reverently and brotherly but there's so many hoaxes that's called Divine Healing and you scare the people off so is the hoaxes of believing in Salvation you cannot ever be saved until you believe it accept it and confess it that's right okay drop to 24 we'll read this one we'll try to bring it to a close off the message believest thou this look what he's bringing he says he's talking about it never say nothing else but what I'm Healed from now on see we shouldn't say anything else come on when I say that then you go back well you said this morning yeah I said this morning when you go down to the doctor's office you don't walk in and say there ain't nothing wrong with me go and tell him what's happening well if I tell him what's happened that's going to mean I got it I come on folks you already got it it ain't going to change from a non-malignant cancer to a cancer in the doctor's office cuz you don't say it you already got it walk in and say I'm sick give me something then he can give you something you go to God and you say God there ain't nothing wrong with me ain't nothing wrong with me Lord now who you lying to all right so let's read that settles it he can't do nothing for you till you first confess it now watch this real careful he's the high priest of our confession now watch it in that case not even to your faith right now I didn't say that you're going to talk to him you doubt he said it see he's the high priest of our confession in that case not even to your faith well he's a high priest of my faith but you won't confess it you afraid to say it listen folks you're looking at a man that you've been with me a long time and you've seen God heal me of many things from eyesight to blood chain types to knees that are supposed to be taken from me all forms of things amen the way I get my healing is do one thing first number one you go ask God is anything wrong CU remember I quote to brother Bram where he says to be healed first confess your sin right so you ask God is anything wrong now listen I serve a God maybe you don't but I serve a God that knows things when I'm saying before God God have I sinned I don't mean have I had a wrong thought I don't mean of this or that or the other about it I ask him is anything against me right and then I must say father there's nothing against me because if there is I've asked you to forgive me and you promis you would this is the way I get my healing and then I just start saying by his stripes I'm Healed and I don't care what the doctor says I don't care what anybody says I'm healed amen that's why my confession is what when you talk to me how are you doing I'm doing wonderful I'm not going to confess anything else I've worked at jobs carrying 80 90 to 100 pound of hubs to put them on each car one a minute with a brace on my back and having to eat pain pills and things but I never gave up I was laying in the hospital and we the only time that we did back then we had a service one time like Friday night Saturday night and Sunday night brother Mo Pastor I was in the hospital because of my back doctor told me he said I'll let you go home if you'll promise me you'll go home and lay in bed for a week or two I never gave him my word I said doc can I go home I never gave him a word cuz you know what I done I went home I brought an ice pack and I sat here Friday night Saturday night and two services on Sunday with an ice pack at my back but you know what God touched me and took away the pain can Fess your way into your healing listen hey I say it as a human being even it may not be great Supernatural faith that you first received when you got that it's easy to confess but just start confessing it somebody comes up like I say we we get in here we preach on faith we preach on faith you go outside and everybody talking about the doctors they're going to do that weak or what's wrong with them right why don't you confess your way into your healing right you know you might confess it you say yeah but but you read to us well brother R said it's not not just saying it that's right but it is say for us not to say it to start confessing it and keep confessing it the sicker you get by his stps I'm Healed one confession going up by STS I'm heal to going up you know after a while I have a funny way of looking at things I guess ever thought about in the Bible where the the guy comes you know I was reading it yesterday yesterday morning and the guy comes up and knocks on the door the guy know said give me three loaves of bread cuz I got company that's come in I ain't got nothing to eat he said get out of here my kid is in the bed all let go on said because of the ever how you pronounce it in other words the constant pounding of the man you know what he got up and open the door right you ever thought about you might just worry God so much by saying you're healed that he might heal you you say you're stupid I agree with you but it works won't you try it instead of saying how sick you are say how well you are now we know we're under the curse of sin but just because you got a bad cold is that the devil is after you I don't mean it wrong I just life about it and I get these points brother Mo years ago his trailer was about 20 something years old and and water pipes got the busting on him and he said one day he said the devil's after me I said no they wore out I said he wore out I said you can't expect him to Li you know I HED him fix some things it was wore out but why don't we just start saying What God Says God says I'm Healed well I don't want to lie about it okay you're already liar so we settle that more than one anybody got any problem you see because you're not thinking if it's true that uh Salvation means natural or spiritual right the word Soo which means physical healing our spiritual healing then what about your confession is your salvation come on we're always talking about how sick we are right you know why I'm over on this side cuz my leg's hurting but I ain't going to give up okay but is your confession of your salvation and your healing the same o That's itching in it would you approach your salvation and believe it's on the same basis of your healing and every time you walk out the door and talk to somebody yourself do you go before God every day and say God I'm lost God I'm lost God I'm lost do you oh did you get it you understand what I just said you don't put your healing and your salvation in the same basket that's right healing is eternal salvation is on the basis of I mean healing is not Eternal salvation is on the basis of Eternal healing is on the basis of right sick today right heal to tomorrow sick the next day salvation doesn't work that way so watch now what I'm saying if it's true that he can't do nothing for us until we we confess it so he can't heal us until we confess it well then he can't save us till we confess it well you know what we might be doing a lot of backsliding Reason reading that quote while ago we might be doing a lot of backsliding because we're not taking What God Says listen to what he says 24 he can't do nothing for you till you first confess it he's the high priest of your confession in that case not even your faith and even couldn't be faith until you confess it Y come on I thought we believe faith is a substance of things hope far the evidence of things not seen it can't be Faith until we profess it or confess it and then it's got to be what he's saying right you got to accept Faith believe it and confess that it already is done for faith is a substance of things F far the evidence of Things Not Seen he said I thought we say by faith and everything so evidently up in here he's the high priest of your confession in that case not even your faith if your faith is not correct you're not saved right right right what's God doing waiting on me and you adoption time waiting on you and me what's he waiting on us for what's God waiting on you and me for you mean he can't fulfill his word until we believe it right it's been the whole day bringing that for just a few words so listen you mean my great super duper faith is not enough it is if you've got it right if you got it you'll confess it but if you won't confess it you ain't got it is that good terminology yes if you won't say it you don't have it what if God's waiting on you and I to say things listen church I've been around 50 years I got a quote laying at home I'll bring it Wednesday Lord willing where brother R said God's waiting on one man in the world was turned upside down by Martin Luther not by Martin Luther and his cohorts is when Martin Luther said it God could make it come to pass I said that Wednesday over and over John Wesley was a man every Church age had one Messenger right one Angel that's right the angel gets it first and he brings it to the people then they they say it right we believe that that's right but what if God's waiting on you to say it I thank God for the rain that we've received it's really been a help we've received a good bit what if it's one of these children that said Lord we need rain y but why can't you do like terance at least come up here every service and say not let's pray for rain let's thank God for rain right that's pretty pretty hard to do ain't it thank God for rain when it ain't raining it ain't been raining in much and you say Thank You Lord thank you Lord now what is he making intercession now he don't need nobody to remind him it ain't rained right you know he don't need nobody to tell him that right but what about somebody just saying thank you for rain when it ain't even raining why don't you do that why don't you try it right I've Tau you from 30 years ago or more and I'm trying to get you to believe enough to say it I thought as I said this morning one big brother said it or did I say it today when big brother said third pool is for brother brandham and the Lord Jesus not for us well I read Word a prophet said is far that's de see I read where the Prophet said is far the bride and the church and to the totally lost see God don't need nobody to confess negative what if Luther to come out praise God I got it do J shall live by faith May maybe hope so maybe it could be he didn't care what anybody else said the pope he got excommunicated for one little statement you know what excommunicating from the Catholic means you're lost you're eternally lost you can never be saved you're doomed to hell and you don't get out of purgatory that's right are you with me yes let's just start saying What God Says amen amen that's right I'm in in the statement by this come on musician I've said this before and the brother asked me he said brother Dale do we have the faith of the fathers I said I don't believe everybody has it but I believe some has it he said' do we have the ministry of Jesus Christ I said not as a whole somebody has it for the part they must have now here's what I've been aiming at for weeks and weeks and weeks so listen if we won't confess that we have the faith of the fathers God cannot bring it to P that's right well it could be other people I okay we we we'll go along with that but I thought we supposed to talk about us being Christians cuz we could be totally lost and rest doing okay but every what it is somebody is going to say this is what we have right amen I've told you as much as I could about it there'll never be another Prophet to come with great things like that no but there's a bride around the world yes sir that to put together where God is dealing with each one of them and you have the faith of the fathers put together the ministry of Jesus Christ was you listening and I started off the whole thing trying to talk about the ministry of Jesus Christ was a purpose for making this statement unless somebody says it it can never come to pass I don't have a problem you're looking at me quietly sitting there I don't have no problem I just got the truth I just read you about 10 11 quotes where the Prophet said God can't do nothing until you confess it you know what he can't bring the faith of the fathers until somebody says it's already here he can't bring the ministry of Jesus Christ until somebody says it's here he can't bring the headstone until somebody says it's here he can't bring a chain to the body until somebody says it's here so you know you know maybe the prophet's right you know what I mean by that I'll put that back in your L not mine when he said God is waiting on you and I he's waiting on you and I right you know where I stand about the cuz I made my blunt and plain over the years about return Ministries and Tents and all but you know what may I go to conduct order and Doctrine no excuse me may I go to spoken words readal see all the waiting has always been on the people of God Moses went to Egypt to try to deliver he couldn't do it why because the people if you say you're sitting down waiting on brother brandom to come back just remember one thing he can't come back until the people is crying for him to come back that's all I've ever preached for 50 years but people don't want to hear that they want something that they can look forward to do that is waiting on you and I that's right waiting for somebody to say it amen when the people got to say in Egypt Moses was sent back right and God didn't need a whole band of people to help he didn't even need ER and he got in trouble with it but he claimed he had to have him because he had a speech impediment see God's waiting on somebody to believe who they are right then he can make manifest what you say right so when we going to say it what we got let's stand when are we going to say it no we'll go outside talking about how bad it is s he p a debt page 398 right I say it this way if we can't confess right for our healing they Ain much need to worry about salvation and getting out of here so we all going by the grave we might as well go by some food plot I [Music] mean some might well go ahead go down pay The Undertakers [Music] weing folks ain't come all this long [Music] time I I believe God's waiting on you and me to say a Revival came one time because a little woman me free I'm glad that Jesus started cleaning it all my SE things in the church she to

it is I thought we was trying to believe God's word did he says we're healed but he's waiting on us to say it that he says we're saved but he's waiting on us to say it why can't we believe it thank you Lord you say thank you amen now I'm as honest as I can be folks of trying to do what I've tried to be these children right out here I don't think there's one child in this church now don't do it now For Heaven's Sake cuz I ain't got the money but there ain't a one of you I've proved it before four the a a one of you if I said walk up here and I'll give you $20 they'd come walking up why because they believe it that's childlike faith I thought it's what we're supposed to be with God I thought it was supposed to be some dramatic experience or this but just believe in God you see what I'm getting in folks we're living below our privileges because we want to confess what God has already done to where he can make it manifest now if you don't think that's right go home and read your Bible and think about everything in the Bible as I said was spoke by somebody who was it what it Abraham I guess and he went down and he conquered this that and the other I may be wrong names but it'll be you I think it is Abraham and he come back and he said God said I'll just give you 10% where' he get that th why do you want to give him why didn't he want to give him 50% why didn't you want to give a god high and high or something before the foundation of the world that's right God had already decreed that to be why do you pay 10% as a tithe because it's decreed right see Abraham just you Lord I'll just give you 10% and God just looks down through time and he says that'll just be for everything y the prophet one time if I ain't mistaken made a statement he said probably wind up be about that way in Salvation about 10% y see all this is not halfhazard thoughts that happens God knew before the foundation of the world where you'd be sitting right here today and he knew what I'd say but he knew what you'd think when are we going to get it down to where we can just say thank you Lord one more let's go what we got let's sing Break Every Chain there is power in the the name of
