traveling back this evening and just have your way with each one now we committed to you now in jesus name amen amen amen revelations 1. the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to humanity's servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his angel unto his servant john who by record of the word of god and on the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth with about a blessing just to read and they they hear the words of this prophecy because that means that you if you couldn't read somebody can read it to you right so it's a blessing just to hear it right keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand okay matthew 24 jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to shoot him the buildings of the temple jesus said unto them seek out all these things verily i say unto you there shall not be left one stone here upon another that shall not be thrown down and he set up on the mount of olives the disciples came into him privately saying tell us when shall these things be what if there will be one stone left on another then they went on the end of the questions right and what shall be the sign of thy coming because they knew he had spoke of his coming uh constantly right his second coming right and of the end of the world you may be seated the lord at his blessing reading of the word because we know the ending of the world is this sick seal it will end the world because you know time will come to a close and things will be over and then it'll be finished so now we're having questions and answers and i've got one i want to take it first and then if you have anything uh on your heart any comments and things feel free to do so as we continue along and uh the one the one question that was given me at lunchtime says can you go over why dan and ephraim are bought brought back in the millennium millennium you know the right millennial rank said did the removal only apply to earthly dealings and since the 24 000 are purged then they can be they can take their place among the tribes all right now we covered dan and ephraim how that when you we went back into tribes so we'll take a fight run through we went back into the uh the dealings with it under the sixth seal and uh dealing with 144 000 and found that they were 12 tribes listed there in revelations 7 and in those 12 tribes there's one of um jacob had 12 children all right we named each one and brought it down and uh then when we get over here to uh revelation 7 you find out that dan is missing out of the the writings there in revelation 7 and then you know brother adam when he was referring to it he said see dan and ephraim are missing here in revelation 7 and and that's true because the ephraim was um not a son of jacob he's the son of joseph all right so then the original was to have been we went through the whole series of going and covering that uh there was original in god to have been 12 you know 13 tribes 12 of them circling around for the camps etc and then the levite would have been in the midst and joseph never was to have had a tribe the prophet said named after him it was to been you know doing because you're dealing back in the part of genesis you're dealing with the the sons of jacob then you started dealing with the tribes and we tried to emphasize that a little that we went along seeing once you started um it even is not listed as tribes when you would be coming out of egypt it would just be the children of israel but then they begin to camp and they begin to do and up and it began to pick up the word tribe and we see then that what happened was was joseph and levi were the two you know they were the children of jacob out of the twelve but what happened was that god was intended and i said who had 13 tribes so that would have worked out with levi being in the midst and there would be no uh inheritance no tribe would really to be named after him but yet it was uh done because of the fall all right then the levite would have been in the middle and the twelve tribes around which would have picked up uh ephraim and manasseh which were the two children of joseph and that was put in to make it 13. let's see then you say well that would have really made 14 but it would have but joseph wasn't and i said wasn't to have a tribe named after him because joseph would have been a perfect type of christ all right so then in the original you would wind up in the children of israel as they started their journey and they counted and they'd done things they had the 13 tribes listed the levite in the middle and that would have been the perfect order but dan and ephraim went after the golden calves not the time of the children of israel when when you know they came down and they made uh aaron made the guys because it's another incident but they went after that in worship and as they did their names were taken out not that they said it didn't blot out you know of their names of their tribes it's because it stated they would be blotted out under heaven but god didn't remove the tribes and leave them out they went right on being who they were and the prophet said that's where the trouble was because they thought they got by with it but it didn't see they went on over if you'll go read there where dan and ephraim went and they made the case you'll find them later coming back joining back together dividing ten tribes and two tribes and and all kind of incidences in the uh the writings of the gospel but when you come over to then to revelations you find that ephraim is and dan and ephraim being missing and you do you find joseph put back in and you find uh then the the uh let's see what you want to put back in joseph and manassas was put back in in revelation 7. all right and see it was taken out under heaven and that's a wonderful instead of god that we serve that even though those people went after those golden calves and the things that was made their names were not blotted out in heaven and to prove that it wasn't when you come over into ezekiel 48 you'll find dan and ephraim put back in because ezekiel 48 is the millennial reign go back and read you daniel 70 weeks but around said uh ezekiel 40 to 44 is the building of the millennial temple you know to be made all right then chapter 48 you get back to shoredom in perfect tribal order and that would wind up then being the 13 tribes you know back right putting the the 12 with the danny from back in you don't take out manassas and things you leave it like it is but what you wind up doing is you have israel in the millennium and they are back in tribal order and it won't be camped out in tribal order count in the millennium it would just be a wonderful time and there won't be any uh uh worship or animal sacrifices in the millennium in the temple it's there as an example or to show that god keeps his word because he promised david that his son would sit on his throne all right we know that you know it happened that way in the natural but then when you come over into the part of the millennial reign it's a promise to the jews the millennium is to the jews it's not to we will be there as a honeymoon but not as people to do we can rule and reign there will be as we covered this morning a little bit and did the other day it will be the gospel to the even in the millennial reign but in the millennial dan and ephraim is put back in what about a great god that thanks so much of his people now that he would say i'm going to remove your name under earth because you've done wrong well but he said i'm going to put it back in well as i said now don't go try to study the bible and see if you could find dan and ephraim take it out you know that's what we said this morning thank god for a prophet you just read here and you find them you read over here and you find them gone and then you're left with the idea of what happened to them and you can't get it all balanced up it it takes you hours if you ever got done the other day and that you don't realize it you go try it sometime just go back and search it out and just try to keep up with them tribes and keep them straight you've really got a whole lot to deal with and you've got to just really write it down this one says this and says this this one says this this is it then you look at them the best way to do put them down this chapter says so and so this chapter says so and so you know because if you don't you're going to start juggling the tribes around and can't figure it out all right but dan and ephraim is put back in the and as they're put back in it's remember it's in heaven they come back because the millennium is the first heaven verse heaven is the millennium first earth is now remembered in scripture so while he was in earth he quit dealing with them but when you come back in to tribal order in the millennium because the millennium is to the jews it is the nation of israel in the millennium it's their promise it's their doings because that was what they were told it would have and they will have it because god keeps his word i like that i like to find where he's made a promise i remember reading it where he said he won't send the headstone on our marriage he said he'll send it because he promised it well you know the coming of the headstones are revealed in his word so they may know how goody goody we are right right you know we have special people boy look at us like i said this morning you get that head raised up that way you're gonna get slapped down that's right because that's what happened to the children of israel huh that uh it's hard sometimes to explain back there all right but they will be put back in tribal order and all because there's tribes remember dan and ephraim dan is a child of joseph but ephraim is a child of joseph if i get that right dennis is of jacob ephraim is of joseph so you don't don't get them confused and trying to calculate but then you say well why would brother branham when revelations seven just leaves ephraim leaves dan out well that was the reason he left that now manassas was put in the place of of damn and joseph placed back in season that would bring it back up because it was under heaven but in heaven it'll all be made right right you'll all be made right for me and you one of these days and everything will be over we'll be there with our children and with our offspring if they believe not just because they're our offspring but because they believe because we can talk to them about the word of god and get them to see god right for their own sales we don't deal with them then there's no gonna be no doing okay all right so that will be that one uh anybody else got any anybody got any comments any thoughts on the uh sister trudy said she wrote hers down and left him at home so uh richard where yeah i guess he's in the back back there probably get to which when you help you look you get your sister trudy she said she wrote down a bunch and then forgot him i said well maybe you can remember and write them down i'm like that too i i have to write down she ain't as old as i am yet right well my question was pertaining to um the redemption plan for the foolish virgin um now the food i just need to get more verification understanding now the food virgins would know they miss it until the bride leaves um and if that's the case then where will they go after they die and get their virgin where does the foolish virgin go after they die okay they will have to go into a position to be waiting all right now we'll get back to this in a little bit so i'll just say a word about it that we believe that when a person dies no matter who whether they're christians or saints you have a place to go to it would be called your theophany you can use the word theophany even as a word for uh unregenerated people because it's simply meaning your celestial form of your soul this the soul that goes on the body goes to the ground the spirit says go back to god who gave it we've got this in a minute to recover it but the soul goes to a place well then the foolish virgins when we leave out of here in a rapture the foolish virgins will have to give their life for the gospel in the tribulation that is their purging because of the rejecting of the real truth of the word of god and it will be the foolish virgins will be uh in each age brother brown said so it's not just in this end time age that it's done so they've done a lot of people's done died you know of the foolish virgins and they went to a place i can't put them in the fifth dimension because that would be the center dead and i wouldn't want to do that but i wouldn't want to put them in a position of of the uh the ones that's passed on you know up to where we're at you wouldn't want to put them into the bride position and see that all christians a prophet said we'll go to the six dimensions and he uses the word christians a lot of times as just people that are believers so i like that ray he said he said only the bride goes to the sixth dimension well then you'd have a problem trying to deal with where everybody else was at so we'll get back in a minute to this to cover evidently must be sections or whatever you want to call it i don't know i'm not educated enough to be able to express uh the point except that they must be groups because when brother random went beyond the curtain of time he didn't see paul and peter and them he only saw the people of his age now there's a question in here in a minute that'll very well help us to understand that but see to me that if when we die the foolish virgins will give their life they will have to go somewhere into a dimensional holding situation which would be the sixth dimension and then when they do then they will come forth in a resurrection after the millennial reign and will have to go forth to the white throne to be judged with everyone else because they will be after the millennial reign there will be a a a judgment of all mankind so you'll be brought up everybody will be brought up that's not already went up the brides already went up the other that we've dealt with the other day are already there and and done lived through the millennium and different things so there won't be a judgment for them but it'll be the judgment of the people like that like foolish virgins but it'll be people that are lost we'll have to come up as we recover this morning a little bit you know they'll come up and stand there and be judged as whether or not they can receive eternal life but there is an opportunity for the foolish virgins that are real true for this bullish virgin real true people as we call them right around them we call them christians he wouldn't say the baptist ain't a christian he'd say a believer he's a christian so he'd use the word christian so he said christians go to the sixth dimension well as i said then what are you going to do with them you would have to have um would you make a position or thing uh we're in a day of understanding a little better i guess of some of those things i don't think it's cubicles you know this group goes in here this group goes in there and they can't look over the wall and see the others on the other side i don't think like that i'm glad we're in a day when it has been proved by the computers that you can overlay right you can take a computer and you can just overlay things and you just keep you can and it doesn't mess up any of the dimensional parts of it you know you can put you something here and you can overlay it and you can do it again and you can overlay that and you can just keep overlaying it and eventually you'll have a completion look like you go to the doctor and he'll take he'll lay out this thing and show you and he'll say here's the body well it's you know and then he says well here you take this off and you can see so much and then you take off some more and you can see some more well i mean to me that's just the best way i can understand the dimensional situation of god putting us into a place to where that we will not be bothering each other are wondering about each other we will be concerned about our group in where we're at is that what you're talking about dude yes and he did answer part of my next question because my next question was if they were to be in the sixth dimension well at that time the bride will be in the millennium so we wouldn't be in the sixth dimension right okay the only ones would be in the sixth dimension would be your foolish virgin form waiting to whether or not they could come forth and receive eternal life because the others that i've covered in the millennial reign you know your old testament sites i believe will be in the millennial right the real genuine true ones and you're 144 000 your two witnesses and your fifth fields you could all be in the millennial right so that would live only in the sixth dimension the souls of those that would be known as the foolish virgins because those that are not going to be given eternal life we'd be in the fifth dimension right the souls of them would be in the fifth dimension waiting for a judgment and things like that you say well they're in hell that was that's a dimensional hell's not burning right now he said it's just a falling he said a burning hell would actually be good that's not what you don't mind yes thank you she said she had a page full i i like to get you know sometimes i get sister barbara she'll write me a 10 page letter you know and talking about what she believes and sister johnny will do that every once in a while and she used to give me a whole book and you know i enjoy reading of your thoughts and your testimonies because it helps me it helps me to see where you're at and what your understanding is but it helps me because sometimes i really say hey you know they corrected me right there just a little bit maybe i've leaning too far you know and i loved it i love to read your comments i love to hear what you have to say because we're all together as a christians this is not a lord over me pastor you know that you can't have your thoughts and like i've always said if you differ with me i'd he'd rather you tell me let me go tell somebody else i don't think you have a right to tell anybody else until you tell me first because that would be derogatory it wouldn't work out all right who'll be next you met sister a regina of simple questions from there um you said this a few times but duh on me um the five groups i'll tell you the four that i have and you just fill in the blank old testament saints 144 whose virgins and fist seal jews who am i missing are you missing the bride from one stop to madness you've got to deal with the uh the um gospel to the heathen you know in the millennium so you actually have six when you come down to it so it's okay okay our sister just missed herself she's trying to figure out where everybody else is laughing i understand that but let's do it anything else yeah um you've said this on many occasions over the years about um sharing the word with someone and i think i have the answer but i just want you to clarify for me when you say that i cringe because i'm a quiet person so and i know you've said before too that our lives speak for it as well right will that be considered as you know if you're applying first it sure will if you if you don't talk but yet you live the life it can be an example unto those around you that's the point that i've always believed you know but ron said your life is so loud i can't hear your words huh say meaning that you're not living according to your testimony will you and your people that are are really talkative it really will go out and no they're they're on fire but then you see them sneak around and do little things that's not correct we'll see people are watching you you know they can see you doing that and they say i don't want any part of that i've always been honest with what i try to say to you because i've always been people that tried to convert me you've heard me say to the lord when i was a sinner i told him i said i'll live a better life than your deepest board lives and i did because i could call attention to some of their problems well their life was so loud i couldn't see anything they were talking about i didn't want what they had if that's all they was gonna give and i had to get over that to a word that i could actually come to the lord you know and see it correctly so then just go ahead i'm not one you can go with me there's a lot of you here that have been with me hunting you've been with me there uh uh maybe one day i'm very talkative and and uh talking about the word but the next day i'm real quiet or something it's just i'm not like everybody else and you know you sit down and you say well you meet in a group and and sometimes i'll say something sometimes i won't because that's just that's just part of my nature ways i'm i'm more of a quiet person until i come here i know you're going to differ with me you know i'm more quiet and i'm in a very observative about what's being done anything else no thank you okay all right we'll be next we'll have comments questions talks and remember now i've never considered the per a question to be simple or you know meaningless that's so so simple i don't want to ask it if it's a question what's the problem it's the question you'd say well brother dale what's the color of the first horse rider i'm not going to get up here boy you're in that if you've been coming to church all alone don't know the color first horse rider no i'm going to tell you it's why i do the best i can to make it sensible enough for you to understand it because any question is a question and if you've got a question on your mind then you won't rightly come to a position of of uh understanding with that question because that's the question that's blocking you so don't ever worry about asking a question and say it's too simple it may be the question some of the people in the building are needing let alone yourself anybody else on the 25th uh of november you were talking about the the first heaven um and i thought just jot it down real quick can you explain it the first heaven first heaven all right now the bible says that the first heaven in the first earth is passed away that's that's in isaiah thank you that isaiah where it says the first heaven the first earth has passed away all right now the prophet said the first earth is now and i'm looking at the book but i'm trying to call the name of it but anyhow i'll find it it's easy oh just running your computer first heaven and it'll come up all right these heavens of heavens and all like this out here that we talk about you know we talk about this much of it is called heaven and then up here's heaven and paul spoke of the heavens of heavens and then he was taken up into the third heaven but the prophet said the first heaven is the millennial right because that's when heaven ruled over earth and that's the reason it's called the first heaven heaven is ruling over earth there won't be any devil he's bound for the thousand years so it's he's you know it can rule there won't be any atmospheres or problems there won't be any things going wrong it'll all be a beautiful utopia in the millennium so it's called the first heaven you see then like i said now you can go into paul and say that it takes you know third heaven well brother random now he says on when he was beyond the curtain of time uh whether he was relating the two together that's up to him but he said i believe i went to the first heaven whereas paul went to the third heaven but he'd run around and go to the millennium i would have any trouble i wouldn't have any trouble to say that's fine um i'd rather stay with what he said sold under the altar because that was what the angels of the lord referred to in him when it's beyond the curtain of time but if you said well he went to the millennium i'm not going to argue that he didn't i'm just going to say well you know he just said soldier of the altar because there's so much to be dealt with when you try to answer the one part and another part opens it that keeps going in too and you know what about paul he said he went to the third heaven and said that he couldn't actually talk about the things that he saw well maybe one of these days we'll get to see what he saw you know we'll get to understand it because we'll be there it'd be a wonderful time all right then what you're doing yeah anybody else all right maybe you can talk to something as we go along because i got some some more or less questions relating to what we've been talking about but not to say well this is under seal number one or seal number two or seal number six or whatever it's relating to what i've been encouraging you to do and that is to study the seals to see what god is speaking to you maybe the lord willing will get into a little bit wednesday night of the seventh seal and i would ask you i've listened i don't know how many times this week and last week every time i'm in the woods hunting i'm mostly listening to the seventh seal over and over and over i would ask you to go through that but do like now because this is the notes for wednesday okay i've got that in my mind seeing it hard to keep from preaching it see i've encouraged you to take every seal and read it not to just we know what the symbols are we can take the symbol of the first one the second third fourth no symbol of the field no symbol of the six we get into the stuff like that but i'm wanting you and i to read the seal book to see what it's saying to you and i then when we come to the seventh seal i told you that this hindered me when i first came into message because i read through the seal book and i saw great wonderful things but i was reading symbols i was reading you know what a man had to say i was not looking to see what it was speaking to me i was looking to see what it was speaking to somebody else over there after we're out of here but then one day i began to realize hey when that prophet got to that seventh seal he just mentions a few words and all at once he starts talking about what's going on in his ministry he was right right you get in that seventh seal just go over and over and you'll see and do they say that it throwed me because i was thinking this man is not supposed to be building his own self up and seemingly that was all he was doing under the seventh seal you know but then i had to wait for about i don't know really how long i waited quite a few many years before i ever read seal book again and then i began to realize that i was missing it because i was missing what the seals were saying to me trying to think they were only talking to somebody else or about somebody else because i could quote you in the early days just as well as now that the bride goes up revelation 4 1 not single 1921 and and say the seal does not even do the bride but the revelation of redemption is to the bride and the seals reveal the revelation of redemption then read the seventh seal or listen to it and you'll see brother adam is not talking about himself he's talking about what god is doing well i hope you do that forever see to take each and every one of them and study them from the point to see because like we went into the fifth seal and by going into the fifth seal i believe it helped us drastically to understand us as a being a person a soul yes and see even though that has nothing in relationship to because it's sold under the altar it's fifth still jew but yet we can see what that soul is to them see what it is to you and i that's right so then it's like i'm saying i didn't mean it i don't mean to say these questions here are not related they are coming from what we talk about and then by doing that then it's in the part of the seals and that's what we're catching on to the right flights all right now let's go into it and just try to pick up i've got quite a few and uh we'll see what we can get into if we have to have questions and answers from st all right well then i took a while ago i said i got noticed for wednesday i can prove i'm going dear honey i'm not just study for them but now listen here's the question does the soul go to the place of the revelation in other words the soul does it go to the place when it you know you pass away in other words you you go on a rapture or a passing away either way would be you know uh does it go to the place of the revelation i believe that that's what i've talked about a minute ago the overlay of that sixth dimension the position or whatever you'd want to call it sections uh groups of people when runaround went beyond the curtain of town he didn't go to the to the luther's people or wesley's people he didn't even go to the pentecostals he really went to his people right and see it would be the people of the revelation of the hour of where he was at and when we pass on see we go to where our revelation is and that could be bad or good because if we don't have a revelation we'll go to where we don't have one right we would go to the fifth dimensional sin or dead but if we have a true revelation of god then that is what's drawing us right pulling us to a position a place and you remember i went through and preaching about it quite a bit during the fifth seal that see when you come into the word and that word will establish your place to go to it will put you a place it will make a place jesus said i go to a better place for you and see then that way it's it's all christians will go under that sixth dimension you know christian people but what form would be under that until something happens and then we're raised whatever but it would be the revelation those feel sealed jew they don't have the revelation of jesus christ correct that's right but it says for the testimony of the hell the testimony they held they were jews they were god's chosen people true sure they had turned down the messiah because that was had to be done where you and i could come in yes but still when their death came it gave them a place to go to so then truly that's a great statement that when your soul when you die or whatever or if we're changing we're going to another dimension or whatever you want to call it and it'll be because of our revelation yes right so that way luther would be in one place and wesley would be in another because of the difference in the revelation and the hour they were living so the pentecostals would be in another and see brother brownson said didn't go to the pentecostals he said this is your people right let's say this is azusa street you know the pentecostal because he was not the messenger to jesus christ he's a messenger to the bride of christ in the end time so then he would go to where his revelation was and the people with earth would be on that revelation because they said you know he said well paul and him have to be judged and he said yes he said well then i preached just what paul preached and he said the saints there you know they rallied around that point right of his message if you hadn't come they said all right now if anybody has any comments as i go along raise your hand we'll we'll go from that point but i'll try not to spend that so much time that we don't have time to get through so truly then your revelation provides you a place to go to right next question if the soul is the nature of the spirit how can that be separated at death if the soul is the nature of the spirit how can they be separated at death all right now according to brother branham what we follow if you die he said your body goes to the grave your spirit goes back to god who gave it and says your soul goes under the altar or goes to another dimension you know a place right so then it will divide just as the bible says that the opening of the word will discern between the body the spirit and the soul the other words to tell us about it so we're a unique of body spirit and soul without all of that being together we're not a person and we're not a person without a body spirit and soul he said well yeah there's a person yeah that's a soul that's the main you because that's a division that has taken place upon death upon death we must be separated from that union our unity that we would have as a being standing on earth like this so because this is going one way it can't go with me that's right but around them didn't see beyond the curtain of time bodies of the people that lived upon earth he saw their theophany all right see then that way your body would be down here your spirit would be and i can't explain that scripture because i've been through it many times where it says in your spirit goes back to god who gave really that's talking about him now first off it's really talking about jesus christ that when he died that his spirit went back to god and gave it that's really the text thought of it but what happens to you and i the spirit couldn't of a sinner couldn't go back into the presence of god and be with him but there's no place of saying you know a place for spirits to be put so we're dealing with something that a way that's i consider to be unanswerable so there's not a use of dealing with it you know on that basis of where it would go it don't get you the word it would go to a it can't reattach to god if it's a sinner and even the best we can do with our spirits today i'm just honestly not going to be about it the best christian in the world brother brown's spirit the best that he could be would not go back to god as that way of going it would it's just to me it's a statement of understanding uh what happens and i said the main point is that it's talking about jesus christ when he died because his spirit couldn't go back to god his spirit was not perverted right but the best we can do our spirit is perverted that's why we have to have a change in the body and not a change of the getting another spirit but we need to be working on this one brother i don't really know how to say things but hey but anyhow i had to talk a lot and i had discussed with around a lot and and i was discussing with a person and it was uh when uh and he came up this morning about about the woman preacher thing and uh there's a spirit ghost with that is that the woman can can be telling you the very truth of what's going on and because because your spirit or your nature is not in the correct position that thing that she's a woman telling you it blinds you you understand what don't mean and a lot of times when you say something about about brother brown you don't say it just like he said it or verbatim i believe that everything that i have don't come from the message of the hour i honestly believe that you know and of course that's personal to me see and what you thought about see to me to me when your soul leaves your body your body leaves you your spirit leaves your body your body's dead it lays down on the ground it can it can't i deal with people a lot of times you know they won't and brother brown calls this pest house but you know the lord jesus christ can't manifest himself without this pestilence he can't do it see but the only way he can do it with this pass out that he's got to be the nature of this pest house see and and the nature of this pest house is is the nature of my spirit because my spirit is the life that lives in this pest house and what you know what you what i'm seeing what you're talking about there is that that spirit uh it's uh it's it's governed by two natures and i believe you come here with the nature of satan as your soul i believe when you're born again that nature leads you and the nature of almighty god the lord jesus christ comes up and takes residence in your life now if i'm going to do something evil or or be overcome by satan he's going to have to do it from the outside in the into my spirit and my spirit acts and my body acts in relation to what that is if i'm born again and i'm doing in nature and and you see a godly nature about me that's that born-again experience it's working from the inside so what you're saying there a minute ago is it really that nature that spirit uh it's not sinful the nature inside of is simple or the nature outside it oppresses it that doesn't replace it but the nature of my side oppresses that spirit so to me what you're what what you're saying there is i believe that your body goes to the grave your soul your spirit goes to god he gave it and there's nothing wrong with that fear it's a soul that goes into the dimension of the dead or the the lost the lost realm or if it's if it's not born again that's where it goes to but if it's born again then it goes it goes to whether the bride is taking up her residence as a theophany and both of them are theophanies now i believe i got that i believe i said that's just like it's christmas time you know i just praise god you know about christmas this is this is a to me for a christian this is the most just dynamic whatever you i don't know what word you use because it's a manifestation of god in human flesh and if you're born again if the lord jesus christ lives in you if you've had that born-again experience and he's taken up residence in your life then he's living in there as your theology as your boring inexperience and uh what you were saying there just a minute ago you know i believe the evil thing is the spirit i mean excuse me the evil thing is the soul it's whether or not it's of god or not if it's not a goddess of satan this is satan you know what that is we come here that way i just that's what you was talking about there a minute ago i just want to explain that but you know a lot of times we have a we have a problem we can't listen to people because well you're just you're just this or you're just that and it's god almighty standing there in human flesh trying to tell you something trying to show something well that's what i thought about that that this morning what you thought and let's share with gail to you know you we're talking about this morning about the about the earthquakes well you know this is earth this thing i'm walking in this earth you know is it had a spiritual earthquake and i think that's what you were talking about before because that's where i got it from is what you're talking about this morning when you talk about the earthquake if we had a an eruption you know and it's in this place that we walk around in i don't you don't want to get anything out of that nothing that just come to me when you were they called quakers coming well you know the other day uh the scripture was read and i remember i remember when it was talked to me what the what the what the acts 2 38 was and uh and i remember that i was pricked in my heart how many people just you know been in a trinitarian church for for 20 25 years as a deacon an elder or whatever you want to have and then all of a sudden the scriptures brought to you and and you feel that tree you know i think maybe you know there's a lot of people that have experienced acts 238 without debris you know good knowledge well you know i just i'm just telling this because because this is what i see you know and i just praise god and we're living in a time that in what you said this morning these people they see you and they come to an understanding they might not hear the word but they see you and they come to an understanding of what what what real person to me is listen being what really being a christian is i just i just thought i'd say that i'm just you know appreciated see to me yes to me it takes body spirit and soul to make a person all right you know that's the the parts your body is coming from the earth comes from mom and dad he brought into the world right you know your spirit is a permitted the prophet used it because of the fallen condition but adam's his spirit wasn't perverted there was no perversion in his spirit form because it was created perfect eve was created perfect but it went wrong because of the fall and it began to pervert around said through her uh flus which he would cover that as your memory reason conscious affection something through your spirit realm but then your soul is the real part of you that god is dealing with because he has to work through your body because that's the hearing the things right he has to go through your reasoning you remember your you know your affection tonight because that's a part of you but he's trying to deal with that inward part of what you really are and then two if we went see and and i've got another part right here to go on to if you just if this thing just went like a lot of people thinks that we're going out of here and we're going up to a utopia and you know we're old bodies down here we don't need it no more well now that part are you gone you don't have the groaning the older we're getting we're groaning for a change that's the point we're groaning within ourselves right waiting for a change you call it old age or whatever you'll call it but see the real you inside of there it's either the brother said it's either born again or it's lost that's right so if it's lost and it dies it has a place to go to we call it fifth dimensional situation you know because that would be the center dead but then you would call the others as they're going up to a six dimensional situation and we have one in here in a minute connecting 126 and 27 with that they won't wait to get to it but see to me i don't believe that you're i don't believe we understand the soul and and i'm just saying i don't either a lot but i don't believe we understand the spirit part in the body because we're always trying to blame something else you know we we want to blame something else for our problems you know but with the spirit we're going to blame the body well the body's useless without the spirit it can't do anything all right but then the spirit of man is a real part of man that's right it's not just a condition or an existence or something that would display a a way of doing it is actually real that's right god created it animals have a spirit part of them right there a life right they don't have the soul right but they have a spirit part about it that motivates them and then that that's real right you can see them doing it bird dog will point you know you don't have to be trained he'll point because he's a bird dog and you know because that's you take a quarter horse these quarter orbs you take a tennessee walker now you have to make them to pick their feet higher to make it look better for these other but they'll pick their feet up pretty good and they just torture them to make them go higher you know make it look beautiful for everybody but see i believe that we don't realize that all of these parts of us are real we we can deal with this out here a little bit the body you know we kind of deal that because we you know well i know about that but inside of there has to be a spirit yes right and we'll get to it in a minute it is not the brain or the mind yes it works through that that's right and like i read another day about evolution and to think as complicated as we are as a human being what we're made and then somebody think we laid on one side and grown an arm flipped over on the other side and grabbed another one wound up getting an eyeball from this side and i bought from that side and you know i mean i i i can't go that way i just i can't stand that this goes too far but i believe the spirit of man is a real part of you i believe your soul is a real part of you and your body is a real part you don't put them together won't work that's right the change is going to be for the body and to take away that start of the spirit that would be an unusable ever what you would want to call it because the bible says come let us reason together there's nothing wrong with reasoning if it's according to the word there's nothing wrong with your memory if your memory is according to good things and you actually love god with your spirit so then we don't want to just make it a well the spirit's nothing because it has to be a part of us okay sister truly we're still in this part and then we'll get some more questions i always believe that the spirit came to a newborn baby and that's what made all of the body mechanisms that god created work together a fetus has my brother graham said it's just wiggling jumping muscles but if you poked it it would react that's just a nervous reaction but to have all those body functions work together i thought came from the spirit that baby god when it was born and in that light is that part of the soul but that's what i don't understand how how they can be separated and yet the souls that are in the fifth dimension have they're moving beings they have spirit as far as i can you see then you're like you're saying let's go back to a baby when a baby's born it can't be born the the body is come from mom and daddy we know that but the uh the spirit and the soul would have to come from god so then god would have to give when the baby is born not just a soul you would have to give it a spirit part yes all right but when an animal is born look how close they get they would get a spirit part to make them work all right and they would have to be trained to a degree to be able to do what they do and that would be natural learning from mama and daddy whatever you know show them how to hunt what to do but it's still that it starts working off with a degree of saying of their memory an animal would have a certain amount of memory it would have a first certain amount of affections it loves its little ones it can reason out to a certain degree all right now i use that word best way i know a certain degree because it won't go along with the soul to be in the fullness of it but what's so amazing to me is you take a a baby that's say six months old because of that whether you get to work with turnover but you take a baby especially when it gets up to seven or eight nine ten months old you put it on a table it'll crawl over to the side and just fall off but you take a dog that's only just a month old maybe especially when you get where it could see maybe it's either you put it on the table and they go to the edges and it'll look off it won't fall it looks like they got it on us you know they look like they know more about life than we do but i believe that's the reasoning part of the form that they would have of the spirit part of them that would make them work you know so god would have to give them a little more greater manifestations in their early life than he would to say a baby let's see then a baby when it comes into the world god gives it a spirit and and it'll start working on that baby that's why it's so um important to to train those children correct from a little bitty baby like you always hear me say you know the poor baby starts into the world it's laying up in a hospital bed it's just been born and a couple of nurses out there cussing and raising cane going all the full moon babies are coming you know and the poor little thing that first thing he hears you know and you know you've got parts about you that work according to what is there but that spirit of that by abc would start being trained in the wrong direction and that's what satan done to eve he didn't jump in all at once he began to work through her reasoning factors of her spirit and he began to worry that he would actually get to her and make her think wrong but the baby is born into a family that nobody lies nobody cheats nobody steals why is the baby a thief why is the baby a liar cookie all over his face cookie in his hand you ask the baby you ain't cooking it's gotta come from somewhere else so jeffrey make sure you don't teach that baby wrong because you got responsibilities that goes with with the doing because that spirit is part of you just like a dog that has a spirit part about it and we have that part to make us reason but by being the soul within us now not to say a separate part but a separate part of the unity we call it our eunuch that soul is in god's image when it's created because it's created perfect a baby doesn't you know how that wrongness is perfect and that little soul that's within there starts a life living and to me what happens is as i said satan he goes through that spirit part and he perverts that inner being or in other words he gives it his nature his nature now satan can't can't create a soul right i don't believe in that name i don't believe he can create a soul they can't create anything it only creates habit trouble but what he does he starts working through the spirit realm and the nature of the little baby becomes according to the nature of the spirit realm you follow me and it's taught wrong well then the nature of the soul would be wrong the soul itself would be wrong because it could only motivate according to the nature of the spirit part that's within it because i believe that spirit part is real it's not just thoughts and imaginations it's not just or it's a real connecting part of you and it will always be a part of us that's why i believe when when you receive the new birth you don't get a new the bible says you get a new spirit yes all right now brother around says you couldn't stand your own self reason it's saying that but salvation deals with the soul of the individual not the body and spirit amen there's too many people that are christians so-called in spirit realm that's right because they love god they go to church they worship but they didn't go out and just live like the devil see there's something wrong there because a true christian won't work that away see that's why when that soul is perverted and satan can give it to nature right around said even those fallen angels he said they give you a nature see why because through your spirit they pervert you yes everything we have now is a perversion right yes when you look at it at the world right around insanity on this out of diverse streets can you look at it now and you you parents with your children watch what they want on the tvs the the internet systems or things watch what you allow them to see because that's going into their memory bank right you see them out now that they they want to kill somebody to know what it is to say they blow the brain out you know kids want to know what it is they say well the reason i don't care i just want to see what it was to kill somebody why don't they turn the gun around and shoot themselves because they wouldn't have too much of a memory about what that place but they don't want to do it that way they want to see what happens to harm to others and how it would be even back when we had a tv back in the baptist church we started monitoring when our kids were watching and that was back in 1950s right and we left the baptist church what was on tv back then yet we were already monitoring our kids kids get to seeing this stuff on the movies the thing now they want to go out and act like it right we want to go out swinging the trees yeah like tarzan or your girls wanted to dress up in a friendly little dresses and act like um who shirley temple you know or something see that's a motivating of our natures then when you say that the soul is the nature of the spirit that's true but don't just say that soul is just the nature because you're just making it nothing and you're making the spirit more real those people make the spirit more real than they do the soul i believe the soul is a real part of you because the soul of the real party is what's going to live on even if you die but see it's it's got to have that spirit to work right all right but when you go then what it's like the next one when someone dies it sounds like they're divided all right which would be true into three different places known as the body the spirit the soul and it would have to be a death right it would have to be a division of death because you cannot take this body into the presence of god and that's why i say our spirit needs working on because this spirit even though it's good and the good part you'd say could go to god but there's still another bad part they can't go and i'm talking about a true born again christian yes because satan deals with you and your spirit realm right that's what he's trying to get you to reason you remember brother around when his wife and daughter had passed away and satan began to talk to him he said in his reasonings and memories he had to be in his spirit room right all right then all it wants something down on the inside of him the real william branham coming to be and the real william branhams would say lord even though you've done that i love you right now and thank you know even like the quota i always try to give you one that run around said he said god said you showed me one time you took my wife and daughter he said do it again that's how sincere the man wanted to be incorrect he wasn't meaning he wanted to lose his second wife and one of the daughters that's that's where carnality interferes he wanted the lord to cleanse him and die break him down to where that inside man i believe that really the per the inside of us is i believe you contacted on a rare occasion honest i wish i could say i walked in the realm of my soul but i don't i walk in the realm of natural things and my spirit from my memory reason consciousness and things is motivating me and talking to me and guiding me but every once in a while the lord says that ain't right or maybe he'll tell you something that's beyond anything that could ever be you know and it wouldn't be your spirit realm you'd be something on the inside of you talking and then you'd say the lord give us the lord take it away see that's where the inward part of man the real part that we are but in our spirit realm we would reason and precautions and things and we try to figure out why things are going the way it is brother around said your reasoning things is okay if it's according to the word that's it that's right when it ain't according to the word that's right so something comes to you and starts talking to you just say well what about the word i mean that's all the hopes i've got folks i preached all of these years to you out of one thing and that's exactly what it is right there that even though things would sound right beautiful there's just something within me says that's not that's not right well then i'll go back to the word to find out what it's doing and to see what the word says i don't try to reason it out because if you do satan's gonna get on there to start with with you he's once bringing the thought i'm listening he was last night to the brother of random i don't know what was it though what the holy ghost is giving foreign and he was talking about that he was driving down the road and said the devil started talking to him well he started telling him all of this and telling him that like i was saying when he got to that point there when his wife and i wife and baby died do you know that he come to that basis and he said within himself he had reason so much until he said if that's the way it is go back and listen if that's the way it is i won't serve him no more he said but something down inside of him and said the lord give us the lord take it away him as a human father and a husband and he'd wring some things out and he was fixing to agree with the devil he said on that one he said i talked to the devil talk to him i talk to him most of the time sometimes it gets so carnal i don't even listen to anyone i'll just turn that off you know but i had a while he said satan because he was telling him he said well you know this man you're talking about he's just a man like anybody else he's like oral roberts billy graham said he just went a little farther than these guys and he began to talk about the lady you know he was saying that jesus dwelt did that mean he wouldn't god he said but when he rolled his shoulders back and he said lazarus come forth he said you talk about who it was so he talked to the devil with the scriptures that's right on that inner part and you'll see that it can be divided and the greatest thing to me that divides body soul and spirit is one thing i know that some people don't agree with this part but that's all right let's see as a born-again christian you can't sin in your soul that's right so if there's any sin whatsoever connected to the human person it's going to have to be through your spirit because your body can't sin without the spirit the bible says the body's dead you tap a man in the head and you cut him if you cut his feelings off all the way down you know something in his body he ain't got no problems his brain might work but the rest of him ain't gonna operate but then you put a man in an unconscious state your spirit ain't gonna work nothing's gonna work all right but you see the question when some someone dies it sounds like that they're divided well they are right because that body is in one place the spirit you would say is in another right whatever and the other is the soul so it would bring the division and run around even states it i believe it he said the soul would be released come and pick up the spirit and come to the body and he says that's what will happen and you and i he said especially if we die and go by the grave but see what i like about it if we don't die go by the grave you know what's going to happen it's going to happen right here amen well that soul that's within there is going to go out through that spirit and captivate it until that body will only be a little bit living moving instrumentality yeah brother dale do you believe we'll do wrong brother you know in the greatest hour jesus had hanging on the cross the devil surely could talk to him right i never believed that we're gonna go along you know this is what i i look at people and they're preaching and i watch it real close and i look at it like here we are we're in bad shape we move up we're in better shape a little better a little better shape we live better shape we look we get a little bit better we get a little bit better you know but while we're just going to get to a place to do the old thing on bothers now i don't believe that i'm honest maybe you do i believe the devil ain't going to be able to control us that's right a lot of difference in what i said and what i said there the devil run around said you can live so close to god the devil don't know what to do with you well if you call that sinless perfection you got a problem you better call it holy ghost perfection and let it be him all right now i've got one question here want to move it down so um i'll put two together in minutes okay let me get a half of one okay it's five minutes to four i didn't know that was that long let's leave it right there so if i go into the next one i'm going to have to cover an hour i got a good going we got wednesday night we have questions and answers but let me just end it by saying so come on musicians i believe that the body the spirit and the soul is a unit but it must be divided not divided like for written aparts and doing parts it's just realizing what's taking place because if we send us in as a christian it better not be from our soul that's right it better be in our spirit being i've always tried to explain that because if you sin from the soul and you say we're just a unit you know they said we're all unit by spirit soul unit well if you don't divide it you're going to have that unit sinning right because your prophet says we sin every day so you're gonna have to talk something with him but listen you can love god with your spirit and you see people doing that and i'm gonna say this and we'll quit them because your anointing deals in your spirit realm that's why you can have in your spirit realm the baptism of the holy ghost on your spirit genuine that's it every day of your life and don't go to hell right and you see people that are in the spirit realm they're just always floating and bubble dancing and going and really happy but what about the word that's it one brother said he said i shouted over a trinity and he said i shot the same way now and i thought i believe i'd change that statement just to hurt him because he was saying i shouted over the trinity and i was wrong you know shouting now might be wrong he didn't realize the statement he made but see i don't preach the spirits you'll never control them that's right i don't preach the bodies because you'll never give you able to do anything with them i try to preach to your soul and to get you to realize there's more to this than just coming to church it's either god living in us or it's not god right that anointed ones when i saw it it opened up a lot of scripture a lot of understanding because you can be anointed in your spirit and still be lost you love god with your spirit and still be lost what about that come to him one day and say how not i cast out devil to thy name and done great marvelous work and he said depart from me i never knew you right you never had an experience of salvation in a new birth yeah so we better divide spirit body spirit soul all right let's stand together what we got brother i'll fly away i'll fly away okay i am i am hi everybody think about it um um because i can't die he wasn't crying and bickering and complaining and dropping it's not a horrible thing but what about a group of people that don't have to die you say well i just don't know maybe we're predestinated well why can't you believe your predestination what are you going to believe like i said this morning i'm going to start saying i'm redeemed let's just sing that one what's the comment in the booklet i'm redeemed start confessing it where god can make it manifest and see that will be the point okay somebody got it what
