[10:10] exodus chapter 21 and and then uh
[10:13] leviticus chapter 25.
[10:16] uh but before we go let's go to the
[10:18] author in prayer oh god we're so
[10:19] grateful to be able to gather together
[10:21] around your word lord and we thank you
[10:23] for so many blessings that you've given
[10:24] to us
[10:25] thank you for bringing louise and
[10:27] christine and their family back home
[10:28] safe and sound oh god and for the work
[10:30] that they've done laboring for you and i
[10:32] pray god that you'll give them rest lord
[10:34] jesus help them give give them a little
[10:36] time of rest from their labors
[10:38] lord we've gathered together tonight
[10:40] lord jesus like i was saying lord many
[10:42] have driven for a long way tonight on a
[10:44] wednesday night in the middle of the
[10:45] week and and we haven't come just
[10:48] because we want to just just do some
[10:50] tradition or
[10:51] or check check something off of a list
[10:54] lord but we've come because there's
[10:55] something in our heart that's hungering
[10:57] for you and
[10:58] we need more of you lord jesus yes sir
[11:00] lord i pray god as we look into your
[11:02] word tonight you'll strengthen your
[11:04] people or that you'll edify the ones
[11:06] that are sitting here listening and the
[11:08] ones that maybe are streaming in from
[11:09] all around lord that are listening
[11:11] tonight lord that you'll give them
[11:12] something that'll quicken their faith
[11:14] and make them want to be
[11:16] serve you even more lord than they were
[11:18] doing before lord jesus
[11:21] lord of granted lord that you
[11:23] you'll remember these blessings upon
[11:24] your people tonight we ask in the name
[11:26] of the lord jesus christ
[11:28] amen
[11:30] so exodus chapter 21 verses 1 to
[11:34] uh
[11:34] to 6 says um
[11:37] it says now these are the judgments
[11:39] which thou shalt set before them if thou
[11:42] bring if thou by an hebrew servant six
[11:45] years he shall serve and in the seventh
[11:47] he shall go out free for nothing
[11:49] if he came in by himself he shall go out
[11:51] by himself if he were married then his
[11:53] wife shall go out with him if his master
[11:56] have given him a wife when she had borne
[11:57] him sons or daughters the wife and her
[11:59] children shall be your masters
[12:01] and he shall go out by himself
[12:04] and if the servant shall plainly say i
[12:06] love my master my wife and my children
[12:08] i will not go out free
[12:10] then his master shall bring him unto the
[12:12] judges he shall also bring him to the
[12:14] door or unto the doorpost and his master
[12:16] shall bore his ear through with an all
[12:19] and he shall serve him forever
[12:21] so every seven years you could go out
[12:23] free for nothing you didn't have to do
[12:25] nothing but there were some restrictions
[12:26] but then let's go to leviticus chapter
[12:28] 25
[12:30] verses 8 to 10 and we'll read and thou
[12:32] shalt number
[12:34] seven sabbath so seven of these seven
[12:37] times seven sabbaths of years under the
[12:39] seven times seven years and the space of
[12:41] the seven sabbaths of years
[12:43] shall be under thee forty and nine years
[12:45] then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the
[12:47] jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the
[12:49] seventh month and the day of atonement
[12:51] shall you make the trumpet sound
[12:52] throughout all your land and ye shall
[12:54] hallow the fiftieth year
[12:56] and proclaim liberty throughout all the
[12:58] land unto all the inhabitants thereof it
[13:00] shall be a jubilee unto you and you
[13:03] shall return
[13:04] every man under his possession
[13:07] and ye shall return
[13:08] every man unto his family
[13:11] you may be seated the lord is blessing
[13:13] to the reading of the word
[13:15] so i want to take a topic tonight from
[13:18] those scriptures that i just read it's
[13:19] time time to return time to
[13:22] time to go back
[13:24] and you know as you can read there that
[13:26] and the scripture that every man ever
[13:28] every hebrew ever every uh son of
[13:31] abraham there if he was a son of abraham
[13:34] he had a possession that was blocked out
[13:36] that was his
[13:37] and and and it it had that when that uh
[13:41] at that time the of the of the blowing
[13:43] of the shofar at the end of the the
[13:45] seven sabbath years that signified that
[13:47] it was time to go back time to return
[13:50] back to his possession
[13:52] if he had if he had got himself into a
[13:54] bad spot and
[13:55] sold out to well we'll say
[13:57] it's kind of hard to preach from the old
[13:59] testament types and the present day
[14:01] reality but let's let's go over to the
[14:03] present day reality you say you now you
[14:05] you've been sold out to sold out to sin
[14:07] and you've been you've gotten yourself
[14:09] in a rough spot you listen to the lie of
[14:10] the devil and now it's time when you've
[14:13] heard the the shofar blowing you've
[14:15] heard the trumpet of god blowing his
[14:16] time is signifying that it's time to
[14:18] return back to your possession
[14:21] now every seat of abraham has got a
[14:23] possession
[14:25] what we need to do though is to open our
[14:27] eyes to what our possession is you've
[14:29] got a possession you know think about
[14:31] them in the old testament they would be
[14:34] somebody get themselves into a bind and
[14:35] they have to be sold into slavery and
[14:37] they're sitting there working with
[14:38] hoeing in the field and and maybe after
[14:40] after the years have gone by 49 years
[14:43] they began to kind of get
[14:45] maybe their eyes of remembrance had kind
[14:47] of gotten glazed over that they maybe
[14:49] they'd forgotten where that little
[14:50] little plot of land was that was theirs
[14:53] but when that shofar blew it signified
[14:55] it was time to go back
[14:56] now in genesis chapter 15
[14:59] the lord made a covenant with abraham
[15:01] saying unto thy seed have i given this
[15:03] land from the river of egypt under the
[15:05] great river the river euphrates and so
[15:08] he gave them he gave them that
[15:10] inheritance abraham and all of his seed
[15:13] now abraham had a natural seed but he
[15:15] had a spiritual seed too he's got a
[15:17] spiritual seed and the spiritual seed is
[15:19] what i'm looking at this afternoon
[15:21] looking at if you've if you've been born
[15:23] of of god if you've got that same life
[15:25] that told abraham come follow me if that
[15:27] same life is living in you then you've
[15:29] got that seed of abraham in you and so
[15:31] that gives you a right to an inheritance
[15:34] just like those that were had a natural
[15:36] they had a natural seed
[15:38] the natural seed of abraham they had
[15:40] their own they had an inheritance in
[15:41] that land now an inheritance if when
[15:44] somebody dies if if your mother and
[15:46] father your grandparents or whatever
[15:48] when they die they they leave you that
[15:50] maybe they'll leave you a bag of money
[15:51] or they'll leave you a house or a car or
[15:53] whatever and maybe you just just kind of
[15:55] imagine you you go to the courthouse and
[15:57] you're sitting there listening to the
[15:58] law you read out the wheel and telling
[16:00] you everything you've got and maybe you
[16:02] didn't know what it was you had
[16:04] but when the lawyer is standing there
[16:06] reading out the wheel you've got a house
[16:08] you've got a money to pay off all your
[16:10] bills you've got money to get you out of
[16:12] the situation you're in then you realize
[16:14] your eyes become open to i i've got an
[16:17] inheritance i i think that's how so many
[16:20] times people are and when they you know
[16:24] somebody that's going to be a christian
[16:25] one day and they're out there in the
[16:26] world and they don't know that god's got
[16:28] all these like the cattle on a thousand
[16:31] hills every all these eternal
[16:33] possessions lined up for them just
[16:35] waiting for the day that one day their
[16:37] eyes will be open to realize
[16:39] what they have access to
[16:41] now i i think i think maybe maybe
[16:43] tonight if we could just look into the
[16:44] scripture and recognize what we have
[16:46] access to you've got access to every
[16:48] spiritual blessing every blessing that
[16:50] god has laid away for you you've got
[16:52] access you've got a right to your
[16:54] healing tonight you've got a right to
[16:56] claim it you've got a right you've got a
[16:58] right to claim
[17:00] the new birth if you're sitting here
[17:01] wondering if god loves you if he still
[17:04] if he still care cares about you you
[17:05] have a right to that because it's a
[17:07] right that's been given to every seed of
[17:09] abraham the seed of abraham has a right
[17:12] to these possessions now now brother
[17:14] brown he laid out
[17:16] as he was preaching about the jubilee he
[17:19] would
[17:20] he would kind of lay it out in in these
[17:22] patterns and it's really difficult to
[17:23] see what he's talking about if you don't
[17:25] look for these patterns another word
[17:27] pattern what you talking about brother
[17:28] i'm talking about the start and the
[17:30] finish now the start here the start of
[17:32] the journey is is these little babies
[17:34] being born and their mothers are crying
[17:36] out and and prophesying as they're being
[17:39] delivered about where they're going to
[17:40] be placed when they get to the promised
[17:43] land now when they got to the promised
[17:45] land didn't happen for a long time they
[17:47] had to go down into egypt and be in
[17:49] bondage and their children many children
[17:51] born but then they came out of egypt and
[17:53] they were positionally placed
[17:56] where those mamas had cried out as they
[17:59] were being born that they were going to
[18:01] be where they were going to be living
[18:02] now so you see there's there's the
[18:04] pattern i want you to think about
[18:06] tonight the pattern is there's a start
[18:08] and a finish the start is when they were
[18:10] born when they were being born something
[18:12] was being cried out and when you were
[18:15] born there was something in the life
[18:17] that was in you
[18:18] god was one day was going to place you
[18:21] positionally place you in the body with
[18:23] the gifts he was going to put you where
[18:25] you needed to be whether that was a
[18:26] minister or a deacon or or a song leader
[18:29] or a help in the church or a housewife
[18:32] at home cooking biscuits and telling her
[18:34] family how to serve god whatever that
[18:36] was going to be one day you were going
[18:38] to grow into a place where god could
[18:40] fill you up because you believed his
[18:42] word so there's a start and a finish now
[18:45] so so brother ram said in a type or a
[18:47] figure we take israel because it's the
[18:49] jubilee time and the church was given a
[18:51] portion which was christ himself that
[18:54] was poured out by the holy spirit and to
[18:56] each heart that would receive it and
[18:58] become sons of god there's your start
[19:01] there's your starting place
[19:03] he said when the baby was born and the
[19:05] mother in labor uttered the voice of
[19:07] this patriarch when the baby was the
[19:09] baby was being born and the mother and
[19:11] labor was uttering the voice of this
[19:13] patriarch and positionally placed him in
[19:16] his place in palestine hundreds of years
[19:19] later
[19:20] hundreds of years later there was going
[19:22] to be a finish where that child would be
[19:24] positionally placed what are you talking
[19:26] about brother bob i'm talking about a
[19:27] capstone i'm talking about being being
[19:30] brought back to a place where you can be
[19:31] adopted i'm talking about where the
[19:33] church the bride can be can return back
[19:36] to where god wanted to be from the
[19:38] before the foundation of the world the
[19:40] thing that was spoken on the day of
[19:42] pentecost that that life that life that
[19:45] god put in the church was for a purpose
[19:47] to bring forth a bride that would
[19:49] actually manifest his same life in this
[19:51] earth
[19:52] now now back in 1957 brother brown said
[19:55] he said when you believe on the lord
[19:56] jesus christ you then have the new birth
[19:59] when you believe on the lord now now
[20:00] think about that this as i preach these
[20:02] things there's a pattern a start and a
[20:04] finish he said
[20:06] you then have the new birth when you
[20:08] believe on the lord jesus christ when
[20:09] you believe on the lord you receive a
[20:11] new thought a new life
[20:13] but it isn't the baptism of the holy
[20:15] ghost boom what what is he talking about
[20:18] he's talking about a start and a finish
[20:20] he's not talking about when when you're
[20:22] born again there's three things that
[20:24] make up that born-again experience
[20:26] you're justified you're sanctified he
[20:28] cleans you out you pack the word in then
[20:30] the life of god comes and quickens that
[20:32] word and brings it to life so it leaps
[20:34] off the pages and now it's living in you
[20:36] and now you are written epistle known
[20:38] and read of all men but that's not the
[20:40] end of the journey he said now see he
[20:42] said you got the new birth when you
[20:44] believe when you believe now when you
[20:46] really believe when god that spirit
[20:48] comes wooing over you and inspects you
[20:50] and finds out that you really do believe
[20:52] and you're actually accepting what the
[20:54] word says that he promised it to you and
[20:56] you believe then you've got the new
[20:58] birth he said it's a gift of god that
[21:00] god gave to you through sovereign grace
[21:03] by accepting the gift that god has given
[21:05] to you he that heareth my words and
[21:07] believeth on him
[21:08] that sent me hath eternal life has
[21:10] everlasting life that's the new birth
[21:13] you're converted
[21:14] it means you're turned around but the
[21:16] baptism of the holy spirit puts you into
[21:18] the body of christ subject to the gifts
[21:21] for service now now
[21:24] we we can't get that quote out of the
[21:26] box out of the message we must
[21:27] understand it and what what he's talking
[21:30] about is he's talking about the same
[21:31] thing that in that mess if you go back
[21:33] and listen to the message the token he
[21:35] goes all this way and then he says now
[21:37] the true baptism of the holy ghost in
[21:39] other words there's a finish to the
[21:40] thing there's a start and there's a
[21:42] finish he's not saying when you're born
[21:44] again you don't have the holy ghost he's
[21:46] saying when you're born again there's
[21:47] more to it now there's something there's
[21:49] something greater there's something that
[21:51] god wants to bring you to a place where
[21:53] you cross over that river jordan just
[21:55] like the hebrew children when they were
[21:57] coming out of egypt you step across that
[21:59] into the promised land into your
[22:01] inheritance into the place that god
[22:03] where you know you understand what god
[22:05] wants you to see in the word well you
[22:07] understand your place you've been placed
[22:10] positionally he said in the statue of a
[22:12] perfect man he said the holy ghost
[22:14] christ in the person of the holy ghost
[22:16] comes upon you and the true baptism of
[22:19] the holy ghost and you got all these
[22:21] virtues sealed in you then god lives in
[22:24] a tabernacle called the building the
[22:26] living tabernacle of the living god's
[22:28] dwelling place in the adoption number
[22:30] three he said now after you're adopted
[22:33] all right after you're adopted you're
[22:35] placed you're placed you're put right
[22:38] where god wants you to be doing what god
[22:40] wants you to do obeying god's word the
[22:43] way that he wants it to be obeyed
[22:44] because he said you're placed then you
[22:47] understand then you understand
[22:50] after the ceremony said and you've been
[22:52] put into the body correctly i believe
[22:55] that when joshua marks those children of
[22:57] israel crossed and they were following
[22:58] the word in lockstep and they saw the
[23:00] water parted and they went and following
[23:02] after him they had an understanding as
[23:05] he began to unfold to them where he
[23:06] wanted them to go be placed do you know
[23:08] the bible even says that where they were
[23:10] supposed to go was put into a seven part
[23:12] book and they looked in that seven part
[23:14] book and they knew what their
[23:16] inheritance was and that's the same
[23:18] thing that the bride is doing today
[23:19] she's looking into the unfolding of the
[23:21] seven thunders and she's recognizing
[23:23] where god wants her to be positionally
[23:25] placed
[23:28] he said we find then when joshua divided
[23:30] the inheritance to the people
[23:32] each person was placed positionally
[23:34] exactly the way these hebrew mothers
[23:37] name those children
[23:38] exactly the way that when they were born
[23:41] that she their mother cried out
[23:43] and said what was going to happen to
[23:45] them
[23:47] our joshua
[23:49] our joshua the holy ghost is placing you
[23:51] into your inheritance
[23:53] our joshua's putting us exactly where
[23:55] we're supposed to be
[23:57] he said the church of god will begin to
[23:59] get into his place and he said that's
[24:01] when the phyllis that's when the
[24:02] philistines begin to back up when they
[24:03] came over the promised land and they
[24:04] knew what they were supposed to do they
[24:06] knew that those walls of jericho were
[24:08] going to come down they wasn't afraid of
[24:10] the ones that were in that land because
[24:12] they knew they recognized that that land
[24:14] that they were walking around on that
[24:16] land was the same land that god had
[24:19] promised to their father that god had
[24:21] promised to abraham if we can look at it
[24:23] that way as we walk through the bible as
[24:25] we walk through these promises these
[24:27] things that we're reading about and
[24:29] preaching about these things have been
[24:30] promised to us and we've heard a message
[24:32] delivered to us today to this day to
[24:35] open up our eyes to the things that have
[24:36] been promised to us that's when the
[24:38] philistines will go to backing up that's
[24:40] when the shorts will go off the hair
[24:42] will grow down faces will be washed
[24:44] cigars will be missing missing he said
[24:47] that's right you'll see when the holy
[24:48] church stands in his power positionally
[24:51] placed the sons of god adopted into the
[24:54] family of god powerful church standing
[24:56] there in his glory what kind of promised
[24:58] land are you talking about brother bob
[25:00] i'm talking about this promised land
[25:02] when you walk over into that promised
[25:04] land and you know where you're supposed
[25:05] to be you know what god has called you
[25:07] to be because the word has been opened
[25:09] up to you and now you understand
[25:12] he said now something somehow or other
[25:14] the individual lost their inheritance
[25:16] that was given to them by god
[25:18] there come a year called the jubilee
[25:20] year
[25:20] that's why it's time to return back
[25:24] maybe this morning that you might be
[25:25] wondering what your inheritance is
[25:27] wondering if god still loves you
[25:29] wondering if god still cares for you
[25:30] wondering if god cares enough to heal
[25:32] you and your of your broken body to heal
[25:35] you if like
[25:36] my daughter when i go hobbling around
[25:38] because of my aches and pains she'll say
[25:40] daddy you're malfunctioning
[25:44] we wonder if we wonder if we're supposed
[25:46] to just go around malfunctioning it or
[25:47] not but but there's a promise in god's
[25:50] word there's a promise for healing
[25:52] there's a promise for salvation and a
[25:54] promise for deliverance
[25:57] he said if he was a freeborn and a true
[25:59] blooded israelite no matter who held the
[26:01] possession
[26:02] no matter who held it if it was in the
[26:04] devil's hands
[26:06] if he had lost everything it had to go
[26:08] back to him free
[26:09] it had to go back to him free
[26:11] and he didn't have to pay a thing
[26:14] you don't have to do nothing for this
[26:16] you this this is the greatest
[26:20] this this is an opportunity that it just
[26:22] sells itself
[26:23] all you have to do
[26:24] you think about the opportunity we've
[26:25] been given that you don't have to do
[26:27] nothing for this you don't have to work
[26:30] up nothing you don't have to push a
[26:31] penny with your nose you don't have to
[26:32] go tell a priest all the deep dark
[26:34] secrets that you've done in your life
[26:36] all you got to do is confess you're
[26:38] wrong to god and ask him to forgive you
[26:40] and just believe him just believe what
[26:41] he's done believe what he did on the
[26:43] cross believe what he did for you he
[26:46] didn't have to do a thing but just stop
[26:47] what he was doing and go back to his
[26:49] inheritance
[26:52] why because he had a right
[26:54] before the foundation of the world god
[26:56] knew all of his children he knew you
[26:58] before the foundation of the world it
[26:59] doesn't matter if you're walking and sin
[27:01] if you're doing things that you
[27:02] shouldn't be doing if you've been sold
[27:03] out sold out to the devil's life but yet
[27:06] god knew you and that gave you a right
[27:09] that when you heard that gospel trumpet
[27:11] blown something something began to
[27:13] spring up within you i i i believe that
[27:15] i'm free i believe that you whenever you
[27:18] think about the first time you heard the
[27:20] gospel preached and you heard the
[27:21] minister behind the pulpit preaching and
[27:23] you began to wrestle something began to
[27:24] stir in your soul like brother and i'm
[27:26] explaining something began to pulsate
[27:28] within you and you began to realize that
[27:30] i'm free and those chains began to drop
[27:32] off and you begin to lift up weary hands
[27:34] and praise god because he'd done
[27:37] something that no man could do no
[27:38] minister could do no deacon could do but
[27:41] only god alone is the one that can set
[27:43] you free when you believe him because
[27:44] you had a right to it he gave you that
[27:47] right he promised it to you it's written
[27:49] in his word and whosoever will let him
[27:51] come it's a right to you if you believe
[27:53] it it's a god-given right by grace he by
[27:56] grace had inherited it and it would have
[27:59] been given to his fathers and handed
[28:00] down year after year
[28:02] no matter what had taken place if he
[28:04] lost it he must go it must go free
[28:07] admit grace
[28:09] is provided for each individual return
[28:12] to their rightful inheritance
[28:14] we need to understand our rights
[28:16] [Music]
[28:17] romans chapter 9 says neither because
[28:19] they are the seed of abraham are they
[28:21] all children but in isaac
[28:23] and isaac the promise shall all thy seed
[28:25] be called amen
[28:26] that gives us an opportunity because if
[28:29] in isaac all thy seed shall be called
[28:31] and isaac was a type of christ and i'm
[28:33] in christ that gives me access to that
[28:36] same promise the same promise that i'm a
[28:38] seed of
[28:39] if you could really see that it'll
[28:41] change the way that you pray it'll
[28:42] change the way you approach god because
[28:44] you can come with confidence laying
[28:46] before god that i am a seed of abraham
[28:49] why because i believed your word and
[28:51] you've come and vindicated it in my life
[28:53] and quickened your word that i held in
[28:55] my heart and filled me with the holy
[28:57] ghost and that makes me your seed i am
[28:59] the seed of abraham and i've got a right
[29:02] that gives you a token that you can hold
[29:04] every every promise of god and come to
[29:06] him boldly proclaiming i believe what
[29:08] you've spoken i believe it
[29:11] paul said that is they which are the
[29:12] children of the flesh these are not the
[29:14] children of god but the children of the
[29:16] promise are counted for the seed the
[29:18] children of the promise i'm looking at
[29:20] that children of the promise this
[29:21] afternoon
[29:23] jesus said in john chapter 10 the thief
[29:25] cometh not but for but
[29:27] before to steal and to kill and to
[29:29] destroy but he said that ain't why i
[29:31] came
[29:32] he i he said i am come that they might
[29:34] have life and then they might have it
[29:36] more abundantly
[29:39] that's that's that promise that's the
[29:40] promise of the seed of abraham he's he
[29:42] came to he came to bl i i believe that
[29:44] this message that we've heard is a
[29:46] positive message i believe that
[29:48] everything that brother brown preached
[29:49] is something that
[29:50] to pull us up not push us down because
[29:53] he he came not to take something away
[29:55] from us but to give something to us to
[29:57] give us his life to impart his blessings
[30:00] to impart us his promises
[30:03] joshua 1 8 1 9 says have not i commanded
[30:06] thee
[30:08] be strong and have a good courage
[30:10] to be not afraid neither be thou
[30:12] dismayed for the lord thy god is with
[30:13] thee wither so ever thou goest
[30:16] now that was a promise to joshua but i
[30:18] believe we can claim that this morning
[30:20] at joshua 21 he said there failed not
[30:22] all of any good thing which the lord had
[30:23] spoken under the house of israel
[30:25] all came to pass
[30:27] all of it came to pass that's another
[30:29] right that we can claim access to that
[30:31] everything that god has spoken is going
[30:33] to come to pass well all it needs is
[30:35] somebody to believe it
[30:36] all his word is going to come to pass
[30:38] ephesians chapter 2 says for we are his
[30:41] workmanship i'm i'm speaking a positive
[30:43] message this morning this afternoon i'm
[30:45] talking positive we are his workmanship
[30:48] created in christ jesus under good works
[30:50] which god hath before ordained that we
[30:52] should walk in them and that's that's
[30:54] the right that you have as a seed of
[30:56] abraham that we are his workmanship that
[30:58] god created us for a purpose and what is
[31:00] that purpose to claim your inheritance
[31:02] to have access to the things that god
[31:04] promised to you in romans chapter eight
[31:06] he said for i am persuaded now now this
[31:08] is something to
[31:09] quote to yourself when you get down that
[31:11] you gotta write when you get down and
[31:14] think that god has abandoned you paul
[31:16] said i am persuaded that neither death
[31:18] nor life no angels nor principalities no
[31:20] powers nor things present nor things to
[31:23] come nor height no depth nor any other
[31:25] creature shall be able to separate us
[31:27] from the love of god which is in christ
[31:29] jesus our lord there is nothing in this
[31:32] this that the devil can do to you
[31:33] nothing in this world nothing your boss
[31:35] can do to you nothing the people at your
[31:37] job can do to you that's going to
[31:38] separate you from the love of god
[31:42] why because you're a seed of abraham
[31:44] you're a seed of abraham not by the
[31:46] flesh but you're the seed of abraham by
[31:48] the promise by that promised son that
[31:49] came that isaac was a type of
[31:52] because christ made a way for you your
[31:55] inheritance is in christ
[31:57] he's the one that made the way
[31:59] your inheritance is in him
[32:02] now let's back up for a second
[32:05] because brother ram said
[32:07] this day
[32:08] this day this is the satan's eden
[32:11] where the god of this evil age will come
[32:13] and sit down right in the tabernacle of
[32:15] the church and and and and he'll make
[32:18] people think
[32:19] that they're free when they're not
[32:21] that they're actually that they're that
[32:22] they're free when they're still a slave
[32:25] now brother braham said in all the days
[32:26] of our life and back in 1959 he said we
[32:28] hear so much today about we are free
[32:31] oh we live in a beautiful america we
[32:33] free we're free now that's that's the
[32:35] american dilemma we think that because
[32:36] we've got an american flag in our yard
[32:38] or we take a picture with an american
[32:40] flag blowing behind us they're saying
[32:42] good good uh
[32:44] uh
[32:45] patriotic songs and stand up at the
[32:46] football game and and say the pledge of
[32:48] allegiance that we're we're free in the
[32:51] sense that brother brown is talking
[32:52] about now now that that that's totally
[32:55] different he said the air is full of it
[32:57] books are wrote of it thousands of them
[32:59] but you are a million miles from being
[33:01] free
[33:02] you're not free don't you be deceived by
[33:04] that america is one of the greatest
[33:06] deceived nations
[33:08] and in more bondage than any place i
[33:10] know of
[33:11] now you think about how how how the
[33:13] devil has flipped that on his head that
[33:15] this america is free in the sense that
[33:17] the women can and and men and everybody
[33:19] can do whatever they want in walmart you
[33:22] go through walmart and you'll see a
[33:23] picture of what freedom has become
[33:25] people are free to do whatever people
[33:27] are free to talk however at my job
[33:29] they'll they use language and things
[33:31] because they're free they're free to do
[33:33] things but yet being in that in that
[33:35] condition they're free but yet they're
[33:37] they're in bondage
[33:39] he said they're worse in bondage than
[33:41] communism could put them in
[33:44] now that's a big statement
[33:45] he said communism can only hurt the body
[33:48] they can only put the body in bondage
[33:51] but when the devil comes in he puts the
[33:52] soul in bondage
[33:54] now you think about that somebody in a
[33:56] communistic concentration camp with
[33:59] eternal life on them would be free while
[34:02] their body is in bondage but somebody in
[34:05] america going through walmart dressed
[34:07] inappropriately dressed the way that the
[34:09] devil wants wants them to dress
[34:11] would be would be a slave
[34:13] now see how the devil flips it around we
[34:15] we think that we're so so great because
[34:18] we're free but yet the devil's got this
[34:20] nation in bondage but there's something
[34:23] there's a there's a gospel trumpet that
[34:25] has sounded to make us truly free
[34:27] he said you might be he said man as a
[34:29] slave america is a bunch of slaves you
[34:32] might be a slave to pride you might walk
[34:34] up and down the streets and go through
[34:35] every store in every fashion that you
[34:37] can see on television and go from store
[34:39] to store trying to buy something you
[34:41] become a slave to it you become a slave
[34:43] to your dressing you become a slave to
[34:45] your money that's the only thing that
[34:47] you think of is to make money grab and
[34:50] put it up here if you do that or you're
[34:52] a slave oh you think about this american
[34:55] system that's got got our got our little
[34:57] sisters thinking that that they that
[34:59] your your goal in life is to put all
[35:01] this max factor and thing on and dress
[35:03] in a certain way but that's slavery
[35:05] that's the slavery of the devil or to
[35:07] have all these men slaving away for
[35:09] money and spending their whole life and
[35:11] money i see people at work that do that
[35:14] some of these
[35:16] maybe they'll be listening in but i'm
[35:18] going to preach it anyway some of the
[35:20] lawyers when i i would leave i would
[35:21] work late nights and sometimes i would
[35:23] leave when i was back in the office i
[35:25] would leave maybe 9 30 at night some
[35:27] nights but the lawyers would still be
[35:29] there because they're slaving away for
[35:30] that money they got to get that money
[35:32] they would spend all their life working
[35:34] for that money but what good is that do
[35:36] you if you don't have eternal life you
[35:38] can be you can be living in a big
[35:40] mansion and living in a nice home but
[35:42] yet be in bondage and the israelites
[35:44] down in egypt
[35:46] they were in bondage they were they had
[35:48] to make bricks without straw they had to
[35:49] listen to their to their master go when
[35:51] i say come when i say arise when i say
[35:54] that taskmaster's whip when i was on
[35:56] their back and that's the same way that
[35:58] the devil has got people in america the
[36:00] devil makes you just do whatever he says
[36:02] to do put that makeup on cut your hair
[36:05] put put put all the this worldly clothes
[36:07] on watch these netflix movies that you
[36:09] ain't supposed to be watching listen to
[36:11] all this music you ain't supposed to be
[36:12] watching and he's got you in bondage
[36:15] when god wants to have somebody that's a
[36:17] prisoner to him somebody that's so sold
[36:19] out to him that he can fill every fiber
[36:21] of your being so that he can show your
[36:23] dreams and show your visions and have a
[36:25] visitation by an angel maybe one night
[36:28] you'll wake up like some of the young
[36:29] people in this church and there'll be an
[36:31] angel standing beside your bed standing
[36:32] there that's what god wants you to do he
[36:35] wants somebody that can be so sold out
[36:37] to him that you ain't sold out to the
[36:39] world anymore he wants some consecrated
[36:41] people
[36:44] you see the devil will tell you the
[36:45] devil will make you think that you're
[36:47] free when you're really a slave and the
[36:49] devil will tell you everybody is happy
[36:52] the devil will tell you everybody's
[36:53] happy with the way you are that
[36:54] everybody's happy that you're in prison
[36:56] everybody's happy that with the way that
[36:58] you're you got depression or or whatever
[37:00] it is that even god don't love you
[37:02] anymore but there's a way out of
[37:04] servitude that god give us you know what
[37:06] that way is and
[37:07] and down in egypt when moses he put a he
[37:10] put a bronze serpent around that pole
[37:12] around his shepherd's staff and he said
[37:14] whoever will look at this
[37:16] will be free from from that what the
[37:17] devil has laid on you
[37:20] you start thinking i can't break break
[37:21] free of consuming things i shouldn't do
[37:24] what you need to do is look to jesus
[37:26] because he's the way you think i can't
[37:28] break free of this this pornographic
[37:31] devil look looking at all the things you
[37:33] ain't supposed to look at on you can't
[37:34] you can't break free of alcoholism now
[37:37] what's gotten into the young people is
[37:38] they start vaping and stuff and they get
[37:40] all that vape stuff and the devil will
[37:42] get you to a place where you think you
[37:43] can't break free of it but if you'll
[37:45] look to jesus you'll be able to break
[37:47] free listen i ain't beating on people
[37:49] this morning i'm trying to lift you up
[37:51] from the place that you are i'm
[37:52] preaching the gospel of deliverance
[37:54] there is a shofar that's been blown that
[37:56] there's a trumpet that's been blown you
[37:58] think i can't break free but if you look
[38:00] at jesus he's the one that already paid
[38:02] the price so that you could break free
[38:04] if you look at the cross where jesus
[38:06] shed his blood for you look at the
[38:08] stripes that he where he bore for our si
[38:10] our sorrows and our iniquities
[38:13] that's what the gospel message is to do
[38:15] is to bring liberty to you
[38:17] to bring liberty to you to bring you
[38:18] back to a knowledge that you have an
[38:20] inheritance and what is your inheritance
[38:22] it's eternal life your inheritance is
[38:24] jesus christ your inheritance is every
[38:26] promise that we've read about in the
[38:28] scripture in first peter chapter one it
[38:30] says blessed be the god and father of
[38:32] our lord jesus christ which according to
[38:34] his abundant mercy hath begotten us
[38:36] again unto a lively hope by the
[38:38] resurrection of jesus christ from the
[38:39] dead to an inheritance
[38:42] to an inheritance incorruptible
[38:44] and undefiled and that fadeth not away
[38:48] reserved in heaven
[38:50] for you amen
[38:51] you've got inheritance reserved
[38:54] and all you got to do
[38:56] is like those children of israel when
[38:58] moses took up that staff and and put and
[39:01] twisted that bronze serpent around it as
[39:03] a symbol of sin already judged all you
[39:06] got to do is look to jesus
[39:08] look and live
[39:09] because god wants you to be he wants you
[39:11] to have a sound mind he don't want you
[39:13] to go through life with the devil
[39:15] pop popping your head with all them
[39:16] ideas and things that
[39:18] you you can't even hardly think straight
[39:20] you know you get you get into a place of
[39:21] of demonic depression or something and
[39:23] you've got thoughts constantly running
[39:25] through your mind where you can't even
[39:27] think straight the devil don't want you
[39:28] to live in that
[39:29] condition he wants to transform your
[39:31] mind
[39:32] change your mind so that you can think
[39:34] right and do right and heal your body
[39:35] and give you peace in the time of
[39:37] trouble and comfort in the valley of the
[39:38] shadow of death and lift you up from
[39:40] that from that spot of depression
[39:44] you think you think about when caleb
[39:45] there's only two that came out of came
[39:47] out of egypt joshua and caleb
[39:49] and and each of those two individuals
[39:51] they they type different kinds of people
[39:53] joshua type somebody that had a message
[39:56] and caleb types somebody that will sit
[39:58] there and listen to the message so if
[40:00] you're ever wondering you know what what
[40:02] what what am i supposed to be doing
[40:04] you know so many times we like to type
[40:06] things as a minister if you're not a
[40:07] minister then well sorry you don't have
[40:09] any types no you got a type in caleb
[40:11] caleb was somebody that when when he
[40:13] went over there he had heard that he had
[40:15] an inheritance and joshua told him you
[40:17] go take that mountain over there that
[40:18] mountain is yours and caleb said even
[40:20] though he was 80 years old or whatever
[40:22] he said give me my sword i'm gonna go
[40:24] take that mountain from the giants and
[40:26] so god
[40:27] you know god god wants somebody that'll
[40:29] face the giants
[40:31] he'll want he wants somebody to stand up
[40:32] to the giants and say he wants somebody
[40:34] that'll be identified with somebody like
[40:36] caleb even though you even though maybe
[40:38] you're old in body and weak and frail in
[40:40] your body but yet you'll take up the
[40:42] sword of the word and say i'm going
[40:44] after the devil i'm not standing here
[40:46] i'm not standing here defeated but i'm
[40:48] going to take god's promises and i'm
[40:50] going to believe that the inheritance
[40:52] that joshua told me i had i believe that
[40:54] i'm going to go take that
[40:56] and he did
[40:57] he did he took it just like david took
[41:00] his inheritance he did it he took it
[41:01] just like you ruth got her inheritance
[41:04] somebody a little mole bodies didn't
[41:06] even have an inheritance but yet she got
[41:07] grafted in because she had a she had a
[41:09] kinsmen redeemer somebody that would
[41:11] that would marry her and take her in now
[41:13] he said brother brown said
[41:18] let me skip over that quote i'm trying
[41:19] to
[41:20] i'm trying to keep hurrying
[41:26] never mind i'm gonna read it anyway
[41:28] [Laughter]
[41:31] he said he said in jubilee year in 1954
[41:34] he said in our country and everywhere
[41:35] else men and women have sold themselves
[41:37] out to sin drinking gambling corrosion
[41:39] doing things that they ought not to do
[41:41] and become slaves to the devil
[41:43] he said i met a young lady here not long
[41:45] ago she said brother branham i'll give
[41:47] you anything if i could only break this
[41:48] bon
[41:50] band of whiskey
[41:52] she said i started when i was a little
[41:53] girl went with a boy that drank we
[41:55] started mixing drinks and i become a
[41:56] perfect slave to it
[41:58] if i don't have it she says i just go
[42:00] wild if i could only get rid of this
[42:03] you know the devil that's how the devil
[42:04] does people
[42:05] he'll he'll get you in a fix where you
[42:07] think you can't you can't get rid of it
[42:09] and brother and you can't he said i said
[42:12] you can't do it yourself
[42:14] but i know someone who can break it for
[42:16] you
[42:17] the lord jesus christ has come to make
[42:19] you free
[42:22] maybe maybe let that sink into your mind
[42:24] tonight that if you if you're in a
[42:25] predicament if you're if you're in a
[42:27] where the devil's just just constantly
[42:29] coming by and accusing you of all the
[42:30] things that you've done you can't get
[42:32] out of that predicament yourself
[42:34] you know you it's like it's like if the
[42:36] house is falling down and you you keep
[42:38] coming by and coming by the house and
[42:39] you say i'm going to paint this house
[42:41] and you just keep painting it but yet
[42:42] the shutters are falling off and i'm
[42:43] going to paint it and make it look real
[42:45] nice that's what the pharisees did and
[42:46] jesus christ told them that they were
[42:48] they had dead men's bone they were like
[42:50] a white-washed sepulchre with that
[42:51] painted on the outside but on the inside
[42:53] it was
[42:54] it was
[42:55] decaying flesh dead dead on the inside
[42:59] so you can try to paint it up on the
[43:00] outside and come to church and make it
[43:02] look real nice and everything but you
[43:04] you can't do it on your own
[43:06] you can try to if the house is falling
[43:08] down you can keep trying to prop it up
[43:10] with blocks and prop it up you know put
[43:12] another you ever seen one of them old
[43:14] old trailers you know that's got all
[43:15] that like a stack of rocks underneath
[43:17] the corners and you're like whoa that
[43:19] doesn't look like a good foundation and
[43:21] you know things start falling apart and
[43:23] you like in your life and you'll try to
[43:24] start putting blocks back to prop it all
[43:27] up and you can try to do that but yet
[43:29] you'll fail every time but you let god
[43:31] get a hold of a life and he'll he'll
[43:33] change it around so that you gotta
[43:34] you're on a real foundation not on the
[43:36] foundation of sinking sand but something
[43:38] that'll stand the test of time right you
[43:41] know what you know what i i
[43:43] what
[43:45] moses moses tried to prop his life up he
[43:47] ended up killing the egyptian he ended
[43:49] up he ended up causing all the egyptian
[43:51] people to lose confidence in him and
[43:53] then he lost all feeling for the freedom
[43:55] of the people and he went out in the
[43:56] wilderness and said well i'm just going
[43:58] to stay out here
[43:59] everything just fell apart because he
[44:01] tried to prop his own life up he tried
[44:03] to fix it all up and do it himself but
[44:05] one day he met the burning bush he met
[44:07] god or that burning bush
[44:09] and and that changed his life so much he
[44:12] was willing to go down into egypt and
[44:14] take over the whole country on the back
[44:15] of a little mule because he met somebody
[44:17] that he met he met the author of our
[44:20] salvation
[44:23] which is why romans chapter 3 says
[44:26] therefore by the deeds of the law there
[44:27] shall no flesh be justified in his sight
[44:30] for by the law is the knowledge of sin
[44:32] it's not by the law that we're saved but
[44:34] it's by grace
[44:38] and god has given us grace
[44:40] brother adam said the church now is like
[44:42] israel god by his marvelous grace
[44:44] without any organization or anything
[44:45] else he called israel to his health
[44:47] he called them to their inheritance
[44:50] grace furnish them a prophet amen grace
[44:53] give them a pillar of fire
[44:55] grace give them a lamb
[44:57] a sacrificial lamb grace give them power
[45:00] grace give them deliverance grace give
[45:02] them victory grace give them all these
[45:05] things and they danced in the spirit and
[45:07] shouted and praised god about it because
[45:09] it was grace not something that we had
[45:11] done with our own self not something
[45:12] they had done not something we do but
[45:14] grace and god has given us grace to not
[45:17] be a servant but to be a son
[45:20] now exodus chapter 21 says now these are
[45:22] the judgments chapter 21 verses 1 to 7
[45:25] or actually one to two we'll just read
[45:27] those
[45:29] these are the judgments which thou shalt
[45:30] set before them if thou bind hebrew
[45:33] servant
[45:34] six years he shall shall serve and in
[45:36] the seventh he shall go out free for
[45:38] nothing
[45:42] and i don't intend to hold you along
[45:44] tonight
[45:48] there were seven years this is called
[45:49] like a little shemitah it was like a
[45:50] little sabbath of the land and every
[45:52] every seven years you could go free for
[45:55] for nothing if you were a slave you
[45:57] couldn't couldn't if you had married a
[45:58] wife you couldn't take her with you
[46:00] while you were in bondage but you could
[46:01] go free and you could go free now you
[46:03] look look at this now it it god god's
[46:06] got the a timeline set out so he's he's
[46:09] marking out time
[46:12] and every seventh every seventh year a
[46:14] message would go out that you could go
[46:16] free for nothing so there's a set time a
[46:18] set time that you can go free
[46:20] there's a set time for the jubilee
[46:22] message to sound there's a set time
[46:25] and what i'm trying to call your
[46:26] attention to now is that we can
[46:27] recognize where we are scripturally by
[46:30] looking in the bible and seeing what
[46:31] time where things fall so we know now
[46:34] that it's it's time to go free because
[46:36] now we've come we've come to that
[46:38] seventh seven the seventh seven times
[46:40] seven is 49.
[46:43] now a man would lose his inheritance
[46:44] that he could not buy it back himself so
[46:46] he would find himself working his
[46:47] servitude until a map to a master until
[46:49] the debt was paid off and he was
[46:51] helpless and under the power of his
[46:53] master and whipped and beaten but there
[46:56] came that set time that he could go free
[47:00] a set time
[47:01] in genesis chapter 17
[47:03] god told abraham my covenant will i
[47:05] establish with isaac which sarah shall
[47:08] bear unto thee
[47:09] at this set time and the next year so
[47:12] there was a set time for that promise to
[47:13] come to pass
[47:14] in first samuel chapter 13 he said he he
[47:17] tarried this is where where saul messed
[47:19] up he didn't tarry seven days
[47:21] he samuel told him to terry seven days
[47:23] according to the set time
[47:25] according to the set time that samuel
[47:27] had appointed but samuel came not to
[47:29] gilgal and the people were scattered
[47:30] from him and that's where saul messed up
[47:32] if you go back he didn't wait for for
[47:34] the time that had been set out he didn't
[47:36] he didn't just wait for god god for
[47:38] samuel to come on the scene in job
[47:40] chapter 14 it says oh that thou would
[47:42] has hide me in the grave job saying that
[47:44] thou that thou just keep me secret until
[47:46] thy wrath be past it thou will
[47:47] disappoint me a set time
[47:50] and remember me so there's a set time
[47:53] that you can go out of the pawn shop now
[47:55] now you think about down through all
[47:56] these seven church ages that they they
[47:59] begin to kind of fall away from the mess
[48:00] of the previous messenger and they begin
[48:02] to
[48:03] kind of go out and weird ideas will
[48:05] begin to come up and strange things and
[48:07] then the message there will be a set
[48:08] time for a message to come on the scene
[48:11] and and irenaeus will come on the scene
[48:13] and straighten everything up and
[48:14] there'll be a set time for you to go
[48:16] free
[48:16] you can go for it not all the way though
[48:18] you could go free but not not all the
[48:20] way
[48:21] there's but there's a set time
[48:23] go down all these all these seven church
[48:25] ages columba would preach his message
[48:27] and then luther as you're coming out of
[48:29] the dark age luther would preach his
[48:30] message there was a set time that you
[48:32] could come out of that dark age idea
[48:34] where you were justified because you
[48:36] belonged to the roman catholic church
[48:37] and you paid a priest and john wesley
[48:39] would preach his message of
[48:41] sanctification because it was a set time
[48:43] that was a set time appointed and you
[48:45] keep building moving on up until now
[48:47] we're coming we're coming up to a set
[48:49] time where we don't go free partially
[48:51] but we're turned back to our inheritance
[48:54] return back to return back you're fully
[48:57] paid
[48:58] the way is fully paid out of the pawn
[49:00] shop
[49:05] i gotta skip through some of these news
[49:07] and and ever
[49:09] every time every time the message will
[49:11] go out they're hearing they're hearing
[49:12] the sound of freedom
[49:14] what's the sound of freedom when the
[49:15] gospel is preached the gospel preached
[49:18] to bring you to to break you out of that
[49:21] veil that the devil's got over your eyes
[49:23] that it can't be done that it's not
[49:24] possible that that that
[49:27] it's just not going to work out but the
[49:29] sound of freedom is isaiah chapter 53
[49:31] that says surely he hath borne our
[49:33] griefs and carried our sorrows
[49:35] he was wounded for our transgressions he
[49:37] was bruised for our iniquities the
[49:38] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[49:41] and with his stripes we are healed and
[49:42] we like sheep have gone astray we have
[49:44] turned everyone to his own way and the
[49:46] lord hath laid him on on him the
[49:48] iniquity of us all and that's the sound
[49:50] of freedom and then you know all the way
[49:52] up until
[49:57] until jesus began to preach
[50:05] you know a a son a son there's a
[50:07] difference between
[50:09] you know brother brown told us he would
[50:11] describe how that you look out in the
[50:12] field and you see everybody working in
[50:14] the field and and you can't tell the
[50:16] difference between a servant and a son
[50:18] everybody looks the same but when that
[50:20] trumpet began to be sounded then the sun
[50:23] could go free
[50:24] now see there's a difference between a
[50:25] server a servant is going to get their
[50:27] reward a servant's got their reward as
[50:29] jesus taught us and in matthew chapter
[50:31] six he said therefore when they'll do us
[50:33] thou in alms do not sound a trumpet
[50:35] before thee as the hypocrites do in the
[50:36] synagogues and in the streets that they
[50:38] might have glory of me and verily i say
[50:40] unto you they have their reward so
[50:42] they've got their reward but a son has a
[50:44] reward of being able to return back to
[50:46] it as inheritance a servant now a
[50:48] servant who was a servant a servant is
[50:50] somebody that's just just a hypocrite
[50:52] they they come to church and they say
[50:53] well i burn a candle every night or or
[50:55] i'm an american but yet they're they're
[50:57] as in bondage as anybody you ever saw or
[51:00] i i stand for the pledge of allegiance
[51:02] or my well my parents are message
[51:03] believers whether you're a servant but
[51:06] god wants to god wants you to not be a
[51:08] servant not just to be coming to church
[51:10] and just kind of going through the
[51:11] motions but he wants to or putting you
[51:13] putting your money in the offering plate
[51:15] or doing the things that that it looks
[51:16] like a christian does or trying to
[51:18] whitewash things on the outside but he
[51:20] wants you to be a son
[51:21] you know that's why paul said in
[51:22] galatians chapter 4 he said wherefore
[51:25] thou art no more a servant but a son and
[51:27] if a son than an heir of god through
[51:30] christ and in hebrews chapter 9 he said
[51:32] how much more shall the blood of christ
[51:34] who through the eternal spirit offered
[51:35] himself without spot to god purge your
[51:37] conscience from dead works to serve the
[51:40] living god and dead works is what a
[51:42] servant does when a servant comes into
[51:44] the house of god they're just they're
[51:45] they're holding and they're they're
[51:47] doing things like like it looks like
[51:49] somebody does but he wants to purge your
[51:50] conscience from those dead works so that
[51:53] it's alive in you so that it's living in
[51:56] you not just something that you're doing
[51:57] because you think that the minister is
[51:59] going to give you a pat on the back or
[52:01] you won't be in trouble with the deacon
[52:02] but to to actually serve a living god
[52:05] and that's what a real that's what a
[52:06] real seed of abraham is going to do now
[52:09] he said the seed the heathen slave could
[52:11] not return back to his inheritance
[52:12] because he didn't know nothing about it
[52:14] see why understanding is so important
[52:17] when the gospel goes forth it opens up
[52:19] your understanding and he said a heathen
[52:21] means an unbeliever an unbeliever in the
[52:23] word they don't know what you're talking
[52:25] about they want to call you a holy
[52:26] roller they want to call you like they
[52:28] did their forefathers 50 years in
[52:29] louisiana crazy they want to call you
[52:31] crazy or like like paul in the ways of
[52:34] heresy that's the way i worship the god
[52:35] of our fathers pointing at paul saying
[52:38] you isn't that how preaching is
[52:40] sometimes it looks like you're a little
[52:41] bit crazy
[52:42] spitting and slobbering and jumping
[52:44] around and hopping up and down and some
[52:46] some preachers run up and down the
[52:47] aisles and all of those kind of things
[52:49] and the way and the way that uh
[52:51] of heresy they called it he said see the
[52:53] heathen don't know nothing about it
[52:55] though he professes to be something but
[52:57] yet a heathen is an unbeliever an
[52:59] unbeliever in god's word that makes him
[53:01] a heathen
[53:04] and you think about that now a heathen
[53:05] and a real son of god could be working
[53:07] in the field side by side and you
[53:09] wouldn't know it because one one is an
[53:11] outward manifestation but one the other
[53:13] has got something on the inside
[53:15] something that's real and brother adam
[53:17] said before if i want to if i wanted to
[53:19] be a real human
[53:21] if i wanted before i could be a human i
[53:23] had to be i had before i could walk like
[53:25] a human before i could talk like a human
[53:27] i had to be born to human now and now in
[53:29] order to be a son of god but if you want
[53:31] to be a son of god you got to do the
[53:32] same thing to be a human you got to be
[53:35] born a human to be a son of god you got
[53:37] to be born a son of god ain't that a
[53:38] beautiful way to express that
[53:40] if you wanted to be a monkey you'd be
[53:42] born a monkey if you want to be a parrot
[53:44] you'd be born a pair if you want to be a
[53:45] human you'd be born a human but if you
[53:47] want to be a son of god you've got to be
[53:48] born a son of god and if you're born a
[53:51] son of god then you'll walk like a son
[53:53] of god and you'll talk like a son of god
[53:55] and you'll act like a son of god
[53:57] he said then you become christ-like and
[53:59] do the works of christ then you're then
[54:01] you're not funny them people a human
[54:03] acting like a human is not funny a human
[54:06] acting like a human is not funny but
[54:07] then you put a son of god in there and
[54:10] it looks different because the son of
[54:12] god and amongst servants
[54:14] is going to be different amen
[54:18] it makes you it makes what does it do it
[54:20] gives you something that where you can
[54:22] access your inheritance that's right it
[54:23] gives you some what does that mean it
[54:25] gives you it gives you the ability to
[54:27] say well come what may
[54:29] come what may i'm going to believe god's
[54:30] word i can because i can identify myself
[54:33] back with the word like ruth and like
[54:36] the example i was given earlier ruth
[54:37] didn't possess an inheritance she didn't
[54:39] have an inheritance but yet she was
[54:40] brought into an inheritance by the work
[54:43] of her redeemer who she trusted in she
[54:45] put all of her confidence in boaz and
[54:47] said throw your garment over me and she
[54:48] put it she put her confidence in what he
[54:51] was going to be able to do and he told
[54:52] her fear not i will do to thee all that
[54:54] thou requirest and he took care of the
[54:57] whole redemptive work
[54:59] and she began to realize that she had an
[55:01] inheritance
[55:02] she because she was grafted into that
[55:03] inheritance
[55:06] now now brother ram said
[55:10] in leviticus chapter 25 30 it says that
[55:12] if it be not redeemed within the space
[55:14] of a full year then the house that is in
[55:15] the walled city shall be established
[55:17] forever to him that brought it
[55:19] throughout throughout to brought bald it
[55:21] throughout his generations
[55:23] it shall not go out in the jubilee
[55:26] and and if a man bought property inside
[55:28] of a walled city then he had one year to
[55:30] redeem it that back if he sold it so if
[55:32] you've got if you're in a walled city
[55:34] you can't go out
[55:36] if you're if you're in that walled city
[55:37] you can't go out but we've we've been
[55:39] called out and brother i'm kind of
[55:41] skipping through my notes to make a long
[55:43] story short but he said a kinsmen
[55:45] redeemer could go get somebody somebody
[55:47] that was like you could go get somebody
[55:49] that was in that walled city of all
[55:50] their ideas and all their denominational
[55:53] ideas and all the things that their the
[55:54] devil's got them
[55:56] hemmed in by and go get them and take
[55:58] them out of that walled city and you see
[56:00] we've we've gone outside of that walled
[56:03] city we've gone out into the into the
[56:04] countryside like the the shepherds that
[56:06] could could understand sheep could
[56:08] understand what life is could understand
[56:10] could recognize when the angels could
[56:11] come visit them we've gone outside
[56:13] beyond the camp we've gone outside of
[56:16] man's ideas and man's carnal
[56:18] understanding
[56:19] beyond the walls of organized religion
[56:21] and he said we haven't walled ourselves
[56:23] away from it so far that we got to hear
[56:25] what somebody says instead of what this
[56:26] saith the lord is i can hear what the
[56:28] word of god's got to say about it
[56:31] now is the hour of jubilee
[56:33] now aren't you glad that we've heard a
[56:35] message that's called us out of all
[56:36] those walled walled ideas that after all
[56:40] of the fighting and all the all the
[56:42] bickering and things for years now we've
[56:43] come out to a place where we can sit
[56:45] down and we can really we're at a place
[56:47] where we can receive what god wants us
[56:48] to hear that hear that ram's horn
[56:51] blowing hear that shofar blowing to take
[56:52] us back to our inheritance and brother
[56:55] said come back to your original
[56:56] inheritance to a real holy ghost again
[56:59] he said it's time to rise be sons of god
[57:01] in the name of jesus christ and rise to
[57:04] a place so you can return in this
[57:05] jubilee and hear the sound of the
[57:07] trumpet of the gospel of the word of god
[57:10] if the slaves want to stay in the walled
[57:12] cities let them stay
[57:14] but you're free
[57:16] you're free because god's called you out
[57:18] and you've been anointed you've been
[57:19] anointed to bondage
[57:21] not you've not been anointed to bondage
[57:23] but you've been anointed to liberty
[57:29] now um
[57:32] you think you think back when how daniel
[57:34] felt when he was looking at the end of
[57:35] the bible and into jeremiah's writings
[57:37] and he knew they were fixing to go free
[57:41] they had two more years left
[57:43] i think i think that's two years
[57:46] that they had before they were to turn
[57:47] back
[57:48] to their inheritance
[57:50] and and the angel came and visited him
[57:52] and laid out that plan that would lead
[57:54] up finally to culminating in jesus
[57:56] christ
[57:57] who would return
[57:59] the believers back to their inheritance
[58:01] by filling them with the holy ghost and
[58:02] paying the sin debt
[58:04] now
[58:05] jesus when he preached think think about
[58:07] christ preaching he preached in isaiah's
[58:09] chapter 61 when he began to he opened up
[58:11] the book and he began to read the things
[58:14] that were written about him identifying
[58:15] himself with the scripture and he said
[58:17] the spirit of the lord god is upon me
[58:20] now now let's pause just for a second
[58:22] now
[58:23] up till now
[58:25] the jubilee year
[58:27] was was always represented by the
[58:28] blowing of a shofar blowing of a horn
[58:32] so whenever whenever you wanted to go
[58:33] free you'd have to wait for that horn to
[58:35] be blown
[58:36] but now
[58:37] when jesus opens up the book of isaiah
[58:39] he he changes things a little bit
[58:42] he changes it from waiting for a ram's
[58:44] horn to be blown now let's see what he
[58:46] identifies it with he said the spirit of
[58:48] the lord god is upon me
[58:50] because the lord hath anointed me to
[58:52] preach
[58:53] good tidings unto the meek
[58:56] to preach
[58:57] he hath sent me to bind up the
[58:59] brokenhearted
[59:01] to proclaim liberty to the captives now
[59:03] he's reading from isaiah but what's
[59:05] isaiah talking about he's talking about
[59:06] the jubilee year
[59:08] that the brokenhearted and the captive
[59:10] can go free that they've got liberty and
[59:13] the opening of the prison to them that
[59:14] are bound to proclaim the acceptable
[59:17] year of the lord and the day of
[59:18] vengeance of our god to comfort all that
[59:20] mourning and of course he stopped he
[59:22] stopped right there before he got to the
[59:24] day of vengeance to proclaim the
[59:25] acceptable year of the lord
[59:27] but he equated that with preaching so
[59:30] now all up until that time you had the
[59:33] blowing of ever ever ever 49 years you'd
[59:35] have somebody blowing blowing the ram's
[59:37] horn to signify that you could go free
[59:39] but now
[59:40] it's changed to preach in the gospel to
[59:43] preach the gospel so jesus is
[59:45] identifying the jubilee with preaching
[59:47] the gospel and when you when the gospel
[59:49] is being preached it signifies it it
[59:51] opens a way for you to go back to what
[59:53] god wanted you to have possession of
[59:56] and brother adam said let's go back to
[59:57] god back to the eagle food back to the
[59:59] leadership of the holy spirit back to
[1:00:01] the word of god let's go back to the
[1:00:03] fasting and praying how about that
[1:00:07] so many so many people today i heard an
[1:00:09] evangelist preaching about this recently
[1:00:11] that people have got to a place where
[1:00:12] they just don't fast and pray anymore
[1:00:14] because they feel like they don't need
[1:00:16] it anymore you get to a place where
[1:00:17] you've got the word piled in and you
[1:00:19] have a good intellectual understanding
[1:00:21] of the word and you think well i don't
[1:00:22] need to pray about what i'm going to
[1:00:24] preach about i don't need to pray about
[1:00:25] my family and you're you're getting off
[1:00:28] track
[1:00:28] don't don't it's time to go back he said
[1:00:31] it's time to go back to the fasting and
[1:00:32] praying
[1:00:33] he said why the church forgot the street
[1:00:35] meetings long ago the church forgot it's
[1:00:37] long nights of prayer have we forgotten
[1:00:40] that if we're forgotten about
[1:00:42] really getting desperate with god and
[1:00:45] getting along with god until something
[1:00:47] begins something supernatural begins to
[1:00:48] take place
[1:00:50] maybe that's why sometimes we don't see
[1:00:52] god move the way that we want it to see
[1:00:54] because we need to go back
[1:00:56] back to back to really having a
[1:00:58] relationship with god instead of just
[1:01:00] just learning about some things
[1:01:03] he said why they can't pray 15 minutes
[1:01:05] no more oh my when it does it's some
[1:01:07] little formal thing
[1:01:09] and half of them fall asleep
[1:01:12] why it's a disgrace
[1:01:16] he said today
[1:01:17] god can send a preacher and hammer that
[1:01:19] word as hard as he can
[1:01:21] and we go to sleep
[1:01:24] get up and walk out
[1:01:26] he said no wonder you're walled in the
[1:01:28] church is
[1:01:29] but it's time to go back go back what to
[1:01:31] a to a real relationship with god a real
[1:01:34] hungry
[1:01:38] yeah i was telling somebody it might
[1:01:40] have been my wife you know you look look
[1:01:42] and look around at the way things are
[1:01:44] and it looks like just spiritually the
[1:01:47] difference between the way it is now and
[1:01:49] and 20 30 years ago was just people
[1:01:51] don't care anymore they got to a place
[1:01:53] where they just they just don't really
[1:01:55] care anymore i used to used to the big
[1:01:57] dilemma was all these doctrinal
[1:01:59] differences and things where people
[1:02:01] would kind of fight things out but now
[1:02:03] you don't even really find people that
[1:02:05] really care that much about doctrine
[1:02:06] they just
[1:02:08] people are leaving the message
[1:02:09] and they don't they
[1:02:11] people in the message don't even
[1:02:13] sitting in church sometimes don't think
[1:02:14] that seem like they really care that
[1:02:16] much about about even what's being
[1:02:18] preached but i think it's time to go
[1:02:20] back to karen i i think that's what the
[1:02:22] holy ghost does to you is it it makes
[1:02:24] you care that's one of the that's one of
[1:02:26] the biggest evidences i believe is when
[1:02:28] you see a young boy or girl get the holy
[1:02:31] ghost they start to care and maybe
[1:02:33] they'll start that maybe they mess up
[1:02:35] and fall down and trip and land on their
[1:02:37] face a lot but yeah yeah you care you
[1:02:40] you get up and you care you care about
[1:02:42] the things that you do wrong
[1:02:44] i think we need god wants to see a
[1:02:46] church that cares that cares how we act
[1:02:48] and who cares how we do he wants to care
[1:02:51] he wants to see us care about whether
[1:02:52] we're captive or not or where we've
[1:02:55] really got liberty
[1:02:57] care enough to care enough to say amen
[1:02:59] care enough to open our eyes if you know
[1:03:02] i think sometimes we we care we care
[1:03:04] enough to drive an hour or some of us an
[1:03:06] hour and a half to church but yeah when
[1:03:08] we get there
[1:03:10] we fall asleep
[1:03:11] and the devil will put us to sleep and
[1:03:13] everything i i i want to get everything
[1:03:16] i can out of church if i'm going to
[1:03:17] drive an hour and a half if i was going
[1:03:19] to drive an hour and a half to a ball
[1:03:20] game and
[1:03:21] or whatever thing a driver hour after a
[1:03:23] movie or whatever they do in the world
[1:03:25] i'd want to get my money's worth
[1:03:28] and you don't even have to pay for this
[1:03:30] i want to get i want to get i want to
[1:03:32] get a blessing if i'm coming to church i
[1:03:34] want to get a blessing if i need i need
[1:03:36] something for god we we're all needy
[1:03:38] [Applause]
[1:03:40] god wants to set us free it's time to
[1:03:42] return now now see you those seven years
[1:03:44] every seven years he it's like a jubilee
[1:03:47] of the soul
[1:03:48] each of these seven years the irenaeus
[1:03:50] would would preach his message and
[1:03:52] martin would preach his message and and
[1:03:54] they'd be free the people that were in
[1:03:55] bondage that didn't know how to get born
[1:03:57] again he'd preach a message and they'd
[1:03:58] be born again and every seven years a
[1:04:01] jubilee a little a little a little midi
[1:04:03] shemitah was what is called for the soul
[1:04:06] but i'm going to close in just a few
[1:04:07] minutes so hang on with me just a little
[1:04:09] bit longer but in leviticus 25 8 it was
[1:04:11] something a little bit more now we
[1:04:13] started off we started out by there's a
[1:04:16] start and there's finish
[1:04:17] there's there's you start off by being
[1:04:19] born again but then there's there's
[1:04:21] something that god's working you up to
[1:04:23] and leviticus 25 18 if y'all could pull
[1:04:25] that back up again i read that when i
[1:04:28] started
[1:04:28] thou shalt number seven sabbaths of
[1:04:30] years under these seven times seven
[1:04:32] years
[1:04:33] and the space of the seventh sabbath of
[1:04:35] years shall be under the forty and nine
[1:04:37] years so in the 49th year there's going
[1:04:40] to be something preached
[1:04:42] there's going to be a message go out in
[1:04:44] that 49th year to declare declare a a
[1:04:48] golden jubilee to declare that
[1:04:51] a a higher level of freedom
[1:04:54] then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the
[1:04:56] jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the
[1:04:58] seventh month
[1:05:00] does that sound familiar to anybody in
[1:05:02] revelation chapter 10 7 it talks about a
[1:05:04] message being preached
[1:05:08] in the day of atonement and what happens
[1:05:10] on the day of atonement the day of
[1:05:11] atonement is when that high priest comes
[1:05:12] forth and makes known to everybody
[1:05:15] everything's been paid for he comes out
[1:05:17] and makes himself and our high priest is
[1:05:19] christ so christ comes out he comes out
[1:05:22] and declares that everything he he's
[1:05:24] visible again on the day of atonement
[1:05:26] and the day of atonement to the 144
[1:05:28] thousand the day of atonement to them
[1:05:30] will be they will recognize that
[1:05:33] the the
[1:05:34] the he's the one that they killed the
[1:05:36] nail scars in his hands and
[1:05:38] all the things that they did because
[1:05:40] he's visible among him he's visible in
[1:05:42] the preaching of the two witnesses
[1:05:45] what's the day of atonement us the day
[1:05:46] of atonement to us
[1:05:48] to us is when he's visible among us in
[1:05:50] his word and his people again he's being
[1:05:53] revealed to us because we've heard that
[1:05:55] jubilee trumpet again and you shall
[1:05:57] hallow the 50th year and proclaim
[1:06:00] liberty throughout all the land into all
[1:06:02] the inhabitants thereof it shall be a
[1:06:04] jubilee unto you and you shall return
[1:06:06] every man unto his possession and ye
[1:06:09] shall return every man unto his family
[1:06:11] now when you hear that when that trumpet
[1:06:13] was blown all across the countryside
[1:06:17] they didn't have to be there and like
[1:06:18] actually see like you didn't have to go
[1:06:20] fishing with brother brown
[1:06:22] you didn't have to be with him and be
[1:06:23] one of his personal acquaintances all
[1:06:25] across the land all you had to do was
[1:06:27] hear that trumpet be blown as long as
[1:06:29] you heard that and and and jesus
[1:06:32] we read it in isaiah he's saying the
[1:06:34] gospel trumpet is when that is the
[1:06:36] preaching of the gospel when you hear
[1:06:38] that gospel message preached even though
[1:06:40] maybe you never sit in one of brother
[1:06:42] rams campaigns even though maybe you you
[1:06:45] never saw any of the miracles performed
[1:06:47] in his in his campaigns but yet you
[1:06:49] heard that gospel trumpet blown
[1:06:52] and so you know that you can go free
[1:06:54] now this this trumpet this trumpet is
[1:06:57] it's different than than just being born
[1:06:59] again this trumpet takes you back to
[1:07:01] your inheritance it takes you back to
[1:07:03] where you're not wondering if if if
[1:07:05] you're good enough you're not wondering
[1:07:07] if this is really going to work you're
[1:07:08] not wondering wondering if you're really
[1:07:10] born again or not but it's taking you
[1:07:11] back to an understanding you're not
[1:07:13] wondering if you can take a body change
[1:07:15] you're not wondering if you've got what
[1:07:16] it takes anymore because you've got an
[1:07:19] understanding of what it takes to have a
[1:07:20] body change because the word is
[1:07:23] restoring you back to an open the full
[1:07:25] opening of the word you're not wondering
[1:07:27] if the lord wants to heal me or not
[1:07:29] you're not wondering if the lord if
[1:07:31] there's grace enough in this in the
[1:07:32] scripture for god to heal me but you
[1:07:35] know brother i'm talking about we need
[1:07:36] to we need something to take us up to
[1:07:38] higher heights to higher heights to
[1:07:40] higher a higher level of understanding
[1:07:43] in the gospel
[1:07:44] that is what this golden jubilee trumpet
[1:07:47] is for to take us back
[1:07:50] you know many of us have escaped the
[1:07:52] bondage of the world
[1:07:54] we've escaped the bondage of the world
[1:07:56] but yet our soul our souls have been
[1:07:58] sealed in by a new birth but in our
[1:07:59] spirit satan's still got us in bondage
[1:08:02] and our spirit he's still got us in
[1:08:04] bondage we're we're wondering where
[1:08:05] we're so tore up by the things we
[1:08:07] remember and things that things that
[1:08:08] we're thinking about and the devil come
[1:08:10] by and and and
[1:08:12] you see you've got to get you got to get
[1:08:14] so fortified behind the word just like
[1:08:16] eve was not eve stepped out from behind
[1:08:19] that word and as soon as she did the
[1:08:21] devil was able to slip in there and give
[1:08:23] her something but if the bride can get
[1:08:25] so fortified behind the word
[1:08:28] you've gone back to your inheritance
[1:08:29] [Music]
[1:08:31] he said the church was to go on to the
[1:08:32] full promise
[1:08:34] the church tonight should be in her
[1:08:35] splendor of glory she should be waiting
[1:08:37] for the coming of the lord instead of
[1:08:39] that she's scattered everywhere
[1:08:40] wondering which is right
[1:08:42] is this right is that right i'll join
[1:08:45] this and go over here and down that
[1:08:48] oh return brother brown said
[1:08:50] get away from those things he said when
[1:08:52] you see the trumpet of god sounding the
[1:08:54] word of god and god vindicating it was
[1:08:56] signed in the wonders that he said it
[1:08:57] would do
[1:08:59] if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound
[1:09:01] the chief captain won't vindicate the
[1:09:03] call
[1:09:05] for he said in mark 16 all the world you
[1:09:07] know what a certain sound a certain
[1:09:08] sound is when it is telling you plainly
[1:09:11] what you need to do and where you need
[1:09:13] to go plainly you need to be born again
[1:09:15] plainly what this jubilee trumpet is for
[1:09:19] plainly i you know so many times you
[1:09:21] know
[1:09:22] look back in your life when you go and
[1:09:23] you listen to different preachers and
[1:09:25] things and it would not be plain
[1:09:27] it would be uncertain it would be
[1:09:29] uncertain how you're supposed to get
[1:09:30] born
[1:09:31] how you're supposed to be born again i
[1:09:33] believe now we're we're we're at a place
[1:09:35] now where the gospel can be preached
[1:09:37] with clarity
[1:09:40] let me get off that
[1:09:43] in hebrews 11 he said
[1:09:45] because we've got something better for
[1:09:47] us and the sound of freedom
[1:09:50] the sound of what is the sound of
[1:09:52] freedom that we've heard the sound of
[1:09:54] freedom is that you were in him before
[1:09:55] the foundation of the world
[1:09:57] the sound of freedom is that there's a
[1:09:59] mystery in the back part of god's mind
[1:10:01] and you are that mystery
[1:10:03] that's what that was what was revealed
[1:10:05] to us with with this gospel trumpet the
[1:10:08] sound of freedom is the seven thunders
[1:10:10] declaring your complete redemption
[1:10:12] right that's that's what this gospel
[1:10:14] this golden jubilee is the sound of
[1:10:16] freedom is is to not be under satan you
[1:10:18] don't have to be under satan's dominion
[1:10:20] anymore
[1:10:23] you know what that's what brother brown
[1:10:24] said that the jubilee trumpet meant that
[1:10:26] when the jubilee trumpet sounded
[1:10:28] it meant that satan is finished
[1:10:31] satan can't do anything else that's what
[1:10:33] that goal if you if you're sitting if
[1:10:35] you're influenced by that by that golden
[1:10:37] trumpet that's what it means to you it
[1:10:39] means and the musicians can go ahead and
[1:10:41] come and we'll close on this it means it
[1:10:43] means that the bride has received her
[1:10:45] liberty that she's not battened down
[1:10:47] with a bunch of crees and dogmas but
[1:10:49] that she's free to react because she
[1:10:51] understands her position she knows what
[1:10:53] god she stepped over jordan into his
[1:10:55] promises she stepped over into the new
[1:10:57] corn of the land amen
[1:11:02] you know when and if you if you remember
[1:11:04] in second corinthians paul was talking
[1:11:06] about he said even this unto this day
[1:11:07] when moses is read the veil is upon
[1:11:10] their heart
[1:11:11] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[1:11:13] lord the veil should be taken away
[1:11:15] and he said now the lord is that spirit
[1:11:17] and where the spirit of the lord is
[1:11:20] there is
[1:11:21] liberty
[1:11:23] that's what god wanted us to have he
[1:11:25] wanted us to have liberty when the veil
[1:11:27] is taken away
[1:11:29] and you can see what god wants you to be
[1:11:31] and to do
[1:11:33] and how to act and to live and what you
[1:11:35] have access to
[1:11:38] you've got liberty amen
