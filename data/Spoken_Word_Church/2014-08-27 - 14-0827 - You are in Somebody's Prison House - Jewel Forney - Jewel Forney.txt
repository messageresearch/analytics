trust God that she go through a real smooth surgery and and that God really do something Supernatural and there forth praise God and you know my style I'm not a longwinded preacher but I'm going to say what I got to say then I'm going to parachute so if you got your Bibles this evening I'm going to read two places in the scripture one is Isaiah the 61st chapter and Ephesian the thir chapter but Isaiah the 61st chapter of is and I want to begin reading this a lot better for me to look right here and this on this little letter I got and I like this better I hate to say this it say The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach good Tiding right unto the meat he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captive and the opening of Prisons to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord Y and I think he stopped right there and he didn't go that part he just stopped right in there somewhere in other words because it was not the day of Revenge is was not that was not his message he only went to the part that was concerning himself and he stopped why you that why St Luke when Jesus stopped everybody was standing there what's going on why didn't read the rest of it because he only read the part that was concerning his ministry okay uh Ephesians 3 Ephesians 3 the book of Ephesians the 3D chapter me yeah Ephesians the 3r chapter I want to read verse one a little simple thought Paul said here for this cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles am let's pray oh Father I trust you God to help me to yeld my body my mind my spirit my soul to you one more time father I trust God that you give me the strength to yal myself and get out of the way bless your peoples tonight Lord they work they tith father God I Know The Enemy don't die try every Tech he's good to keep them from being in the service but father they made a sacrifice father and I trust that you meet their needs father we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you you may be seated one moment thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God tonight I like the way Jesus spoke it in uh Isaiah spoke it here he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to preach the good uh to preach good Tiding unto the meat and to and and good time unto me and to have sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captain and the opening of the prison to them that are bound my title is you are in somebody prison house right you are in somebody prison house and uh uh you know today we are in somebody prison house if you don't want to believe it or not right it a but two sources in the world is either God prison or you going to be a prison for the in the devil prison house so I begin to look at this thing here as I begin to think on anything here what is a prison what is a prisoner a prisoner is a it means a a person a prison is a building a cell for locking up peoples convicted of a crime right it says a p to have a prison you got to have a prisoner right yeah what good would be a prison it was not a prisoner so a prisoner is a person who is held caped by someone or something right yeah then Paul did a definition it was a definition a prisoner of love and then it goes on here and says here and to be a prisoner you have to have a conviction somebody had to bring you up convict you of a crime and it said to convict to judge and found guilty in a in a court of law the jury convict him for a robbery a person who is sentenc to serve a person who who is serving a sentence in prison this is the natural ter right prison so now I want to look here and we begin to here a prison is been bound by someone or something hallu it don't mean that you are are prison somebody that's held by captive even by a power of some source and you can't get free of it it could be a drug you can be a prisoner the drug you can be a prisoner to sex you can be a prisoner all the things if you can't get free from it you in prison but I'm going to use this right here the prophet said in the in the in the message uh in the old seal book he he talking about here in the Old Testament he said in know and he talk about speaking of the Jubilee He said but if you do not he said but but if he do not want to go if he do not want to go he is satisfied with his slave master then he is taken into the into the temple and they would they and they want would would take an all you know what all is and and they would pierce his ear and put a hole in his ear and it is a Mark that he can never go back right is that right he has so that he he has to serve his master for all the time I do not care how many times the Jubilee sounds that's right or whatever happen he has absolutely sold his Birthright he he has sold his birth rate out of for being free right when Satan when a man turn down the gospel right Satan marks him yeah what in there he deed him so he can never hear the truth no more he is finished he stayed with the group that he is in that he stays with that group he stays with the group that he is with he do not want to hear the truth you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free and then he go to when God he marcks his people's too HJ but God walks his people and we don't want to HJ we want to stay with God I begin to look here I say I want you to notice this thing right and we begin to build for a few minute so so he say the prophet said he should know the truth we quote that scripture a lot we say well you should know the truth and the truth shall make you free well that is not necessarily the way it go cuz a lot of time people hear the truth and it's still in bondage so this hearing the truth just hearing the truth and just say I hear the truth I made fre free that is not it but the Bible say if you continue in my word you must stay in the word to stay free if you continue in my word then you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free talking about prison for a few minutes now I want you to notice here I want you to notice these few things poters I want to use when Jesus when the first Man was created that God created on Earth put him in the Garden of Eden yeah and he said to her I'm giving you Dominion right I'm the Lord over you Paul I'm the Lord over you Adam Hallelujah in other words I rule you what did he do the first man that God ever created and spoke into it he walked out on the earth that man was a prisoner yeah he was a he was a prisoner to eternal life right and as long as he believed and stayed with God word he was B by eternal life Adam should never have broke the Bell that Adam should never had escaped right he was in eternal life he had a life sentence Adam had a life sentence and long as you stay behind the word continue in my word you got eternal life Adam Adam had a life sentence but Satan came along and Satan begin to set up a plan so Adam can escape yeah and only to escape God prison to escape God prison is actually is a felony Hallelujah in other word Adam committed a felony against God hallelujah and when he did Escape Satan put him on death row Adam didn't have to die until he escape now Adam is on the death row right now Adam know what it feel like to die he shouldn't have know that Adam should never had tasted death he was on Life Center but Satan got him to escape look at this here in other words you say what he do I want you to notice these few things I want to bring to your attention a felony a felony is a a felony is an interment is a is is a a punishment it in other words it is is punishment in fact by death or in prison you know a life sentence a a felony is is counted as uh as as robbery felony is counted as rape felony is counted as uh uh hom homicide felony sign at all these things that we do rap robbery uh all these things is felonies in the natural they all got a lay they all got a a prison sentence to it how if you break it do one thing automatic you saying I want to go to prison how so a felony is a present is is a penalty or it could mean death so ath can send you to death Ro so now when Adam fell Hallelujah he fell from eternal life he fell from his eternal life sentence right Satan put him on death row exactly Satan put him on death row see because now no longer will a man be able to live a thousand years on earth right Hallelujah he why become man on death road cuz D with the Lord is a thousand years and a thousand years at a day how meusa live 969 years the oldest man that ever live but he never lived out a thousand years he was on death rad he had to die H that why we come back to eternal life again in the Millennium we walk out for a thousand years how to to pick up that old sa and live Eternal day on right how they begin to look here I'm going to go in here and look at this look Clos so we begin to realize but I want you begin to realize felonies how the things that we do how now you said brother Joel I use the term a felony is Rob if you rob somebody you done done something against somebody will yeah a force you took it by force right a robbery and I begin to say what do they got to do with the kingdom of God yeah robbery got to do a lot with the kingdom of God cuz the Bible says Satan come to steal kill and Rob right that is the three attributes of his coming yeah to kill steal and Rob right Jesus said these words will a man rob God right right right will a man commit a telling the oh God right when a man do not pay his ties and his offering he is he is a robber he's stealing from God he's the same anointing that old Judas is is on that man he's a thief I you let me use this here let me make this play in St John 12 you know when Jesus when Judas when this woman chck the allil and she came and she was KN Jesus feet and and all these things were taking the Romans in there Judah says why to this woman knowing his feet which is explicit all won't she give us all to the poor yeah that it price love the Bible say he didn't care nothing for the poor right the Bible say he was a thief right and had been stealing out of the money bag right so he was concerned about his own pocket he was not concerned about the gospel right that why Judas never made because he was a thief from the beginning that what God never gave him a place HJ in other word he had the attribute of sat in him and robbery does not always mean hallah I'm I'm tiing over robbery mean got the pr life the time with the word the time with Christ if you rob God right Amen Let take this thing here for a little further here I just throw the things in to get disturb our minds in the way remember how so that was that so that what man man have begun to Rob God is more than one way in more than one way he said in other words if for you ought to be convicted for something or something amen something got to have you in bondage how something got to have you in bondage either you be in bondage to God or you can be in bondage to a Doctrine something that's false that carry you down the wrong road and you cannot get away from it right that's bondage Hallelujah in other words I begin to look at these things that I was studying these things out I'm talking about being a PR most people's in bundage by fear fear is the biggest test Master over people life he a demon CU we all got to come man you almost preached my message today sorry I was going to use that me he got to talk about F that we start talking about that day so fear is one of the things I had in my T how so fear is one of the most powerful test Masters how the devil you to hold you in prison to Satan to keep you on death road because he know as long as you Fe God can't heal you right T would not move if you fear it right demon would not move if you Fe on demon that what Jesus said I did not give you the spirit I did not give you the spirit of fear but I gave you the spirit the spirit of peace and of a sound mind how because fear pace of Visions is not real what it do it's stealing you from Faith it's robbing you from faith I would believe but what about this no you need to forget about that and just believe God hallelujah other words it ain't no what about this and what about that I believe God word against every obstacle I believe that God said he was a Healer he was a deliverer I don't care what the devil say he not going to rob me out of my faith let look at this stay here a little closer let's just take a look Rob I'm talking about I'm just talking about Rob and thievery so you said brother Jewel let's here see we go in the religious realm because we think in the day that everything that look like God is God but everything that look like God ain't God how a lot of we got I tell you what let me just use a quotation for a second he was speaking uh he was speaking on this message choosing of a brother more peoples is robbed by human Spirits more than any other thing more people look to man more they look to God that why today we find people falling away from the faith because they not looking at God they looking at what man do right but God say look I he the author and the finish of our faith Glory yes sir he said this is the problem here he says he says the same implies the choosing the church now you watch now now you must pray over the church that you are fellowshiping then because church has Spirits PL not singular yeah because it shouldn't be but one spirit in the church Hallelujah it should not be plural many spirits in the church because they but one Spirit One Faith one Lord and one baptism that's what the power of God lay not in the spirit but in our spirit if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead if it dwell in you it will bring your body to the same level Revelation he had but churches has Spirits then he said now I want you now I want to not be a critic but I recognize I I am an old man I'm I got to leave here one of these days but I have got to answer at the day of judgment for what I say tonight or any other time and therefore I got to be dead earn truly convicted convict you go into a church you just watch the behavior of the church you just watch the pastor and you will usually find that the PE the church act like the pastor does nothing wrong but acting like the pastor if he preaching the word because if he preaching the word you're not acting like him you are acting like the word of power of the Holy Ghost he preaching but if he preaching himself right if he preaching himself then you acting like him because that's his Spirit he preaching to you sometime I wonder if we just not get in one another Spirits instead of the Holy Ghost that's why today I say here we got more thiefs in the message how end of the word what they call the day when somebody steal identity yes that's the word identity St somebody get your identity and other word but in the me and and when you say somebody steal your identity what would you call that a thief he's a th it's a felony it's a felony to steal somebody identity right Hallelujah in other word brother brother Sam can't be me and I cannot be Sam Amen brother brother way canot be me and I can't be brother Wade brother Mar can't be me and I can't be him that Ste his identity Hallelujah that mean I'm a thief that why we got so many Eddie bers running around identi St so many people trying to impersonate Dy Reagan Identity Thief that's one Dy Reagan that's one amb of that the rest of them in th that know there true truth in way H don't try to be me be what God made you hallah I'm going to be the way that God made me you be the way that God Made You and God will love you more and people will love you more but people I'm tired of this identity step H man what people do that for they not doing it for the glory of God they doing it because they want the glory for themselves if they see God bless this man well I got to be like Brother s no you need to be like you because God uniquely gave him a gift how to break the word to his assembly and there one of him that know how to do it h you don't need to try to be here you need to say Lord let me use my gift what you made me to do I don't need to sing like ell Presley right a Jane Brown yeah I didn't need to be me right if I can't care two men a bucket but it ain't the point how I sound is the point what I worship H so be get to go here thank you Lord look at this thing here look closer see Jesus people think because they got the Holy Ghost I know I got the Holy Ghost but it don't mean you're going into ruption right does not even mean that you saved because you got the Holy Ghost and now let me just read this the reason I say this we talking about thevery how because we realize here this is the AG Satan is come to kill steal and destroy right he's trying to get everything he can and when Satan is done with you he to get rid of you Satan to talk you in the Rob in the bank then he go back and call the police on you yeah he T me into getting drunk one night he call the police T Elija for four years dirty devil amen that just the way he work and other word I'm saying that to let you know he's not your friend Hallelujah in other words he's a thief he's a liar he's a he's a murder how how you can trust somebody like that brother BR say i' rather have a drunk with me than a murder right a liar excuse me right but then look at this thing real quick we talking about a Thief Identity thieves okay look here the Bible says here in St Matthew say many any will come to me that day saying Lord Lord right have not we prophesied in thy name Lord have not we cast out devils in thy name that say Matthew 7:21 you want read it he said have not we done great one is ass sign in thy name and Jesus says depart from me right I never knew you that's right it never was an intimate relationship between me and you now what we got right here I said the what we have right here is identity thieves what they doing they are stealing from the anointing of God to glorify thems the television Val what they do they steal from God's anointing they see Power they see the Holy Ghost move but you don't see the life and if it is not burn the same life that Jesus Christ had then is not none of his because we not mag we do not we do not look at how many gifts we got we look at get the F we bur so the life is known by the tree is known by food outside of that you got impersonation right a thievery of the anointing of Jesus Satan was a thief he tried to steal God's glory for himself and man says that try to operate in the law of healing operating in the law of Prophecy without the life is a thief power of pect church is satanic how you using God glory to glorify and Jesus said I don't know you why because there was no faith there was no life to make it work see gifts and calling a move if people got faith to believe it it could happen but don't mean that because you got the Holy Ghost anointed on you that you that you got it h that does not mean that you got it in the M of leadership this a quote I want to use here in the M of the leadership he said the choice of your conduct you say you cannot mix it now you either for God or against God and if you try to use God glory and not be in the Holy Ghost then you against God right so you stealing from his anointing you stealing from his glory how you identity if you're trying to be an impersonator is somebody that's trying to act like somebody else but not really got the real person Hallelujah and he says here and you against God and the outside expression shows exactly what's on the inside see the cerber you may you may think well I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven that does not mean a thing that did not mean one thing you you going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life right in your life and still be lost and go to hell if it just fall on your spirit you will do these gifts you would do these signs of Wonder and still be L but if it ever fall in your soul how if it ever fall in your soul then nothing can separate you you're a prisoner for life amen yes sir now look at this thing here I say if we didn't have prisons we got to deal with things that's trying to hold us yeah trying to hold us out trying to keep us from going on into the word let us look at one in let me look at Second Corinthians second Corinthians the 10th chapter and the fourth and fifth verse Paul speaking here second Corinthians the 10th chapter the fourth and the fifth verse Paul was speaking these words right here he was letting us know we got to keep in we got to keep these things right that's trying to hold us back things are keeping us in bondage Hallelujah here what Paul says right here uh Second Corinthians the 4th verse 2 Corinthians the 10th chapter and the 4th verse says for the weers our Warfare are not conal but mightily through God the pulling down a stronghold right a hold it something that's keeping you from being a preson of a God right something keeping you from your pright something keeping you from being a dedicated Christian is a stronghold it may be a teaching it may be a false teaching it may be a job it may be anything that holding you back from the word of God you are in bondage you see people think bondage is a well I just got a little sin see God ain't got no misdemeanors right I don't think about God in at least in the courtroom you get a little Grace you got a misin child H well you know I seen a man stealing onions one time that was not no big deal the judge just looked at him and say no more trespass said Miss Addis don't you never steal no more I was there in jail with in court when they gave him that he said you he said he said right now he said you not to go back on her property and you better pay her for her onions and he trying to tell the Jud only reason I stole the onion because when I eat pork salad I love onions am the judge say I can't believe him she charged him for stealing onion but anyway that's a misdemeanor yeah that but if he would have stole $25,000 for a bank that would have been a different thing it would have been a felony crime and the Jud wouldn't say go home he's not that home so Paul telling us here casting pulling down strongholds cast down imagination more people isound imagination and they Bound in any other realm in faith he said cast down imagination and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bring into captivity bring into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ the knowledge of God right cast down every thought that come against the knowledge of God what is the knowledge of God how it we should s wly after we have receive the knowledge right of Truth Glory now how would you get knowledge of Truth am 3 and7 says surely the Lord would do nothing except he reveal his secret to his servant the prophet so if you getting God knowledge it got to be a prophet on the scene to make it known so how once the knowledge come didn't demon going to come the CH teaches to try to get you to turn your back on what God is doing you you but the point of it is when these things come up cast them down don't get discouraged in your Christian walk stay with the message stay with Christ and look at this thing right here let's go on here and think of this thing on prison on Prison we looking at prisons a prison for Christ cuz Satan is going to deal with you and there a the attack it's in the it already got the world they serve him you know but we we we we putting up a resistance so now the only way that Satan can fight you is trying to get you to turn and become a prisoner or either escape the power of God and be put on death row now one thing about death row you put on death row and they tell you going to die tomorrow at 10:00 believe me tomorrow at 10:00 you going to sleep yeah yeah sir you going to be sleep tomorrow at 10:00 but let me finish this I get back to that in a second so Paul teach this so Satan knows the only way he could get to a Christian is get us to reject the knowledge of truth right so now if you notice in that 1 Timothy 3 says that many shall depart from the faith yeah oh yeah the be a Deport there got to be something to cause you to get upset there got be something to cause you to want to leave how you might you might have been looking at event you might be looking at what this person said and what that person said over there but that something caus you to depart from the faith right and the Bible say give it heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils lead the faith not that you was in it you lead the faith and all of a sudden you lead the faith and all of a sudden how you you giving heed to seducing spirit and now in other word Satan got you Bound by the spirit of a demonic power H and now you fighting against the very thing that save you amen sir oh man I looked at this stay right here I'm going to deal with prisons then I got some good things to say in a second but I want to let you know this is a serious hour see because we living in an hour that we living in an hour that felonies have become in the way people look at it as a misdemenor you go and kill somebody today long as you don't shoot that dog you'll get out yeah you shoot that dog that's they give Li give you double life you'll get more life for a dog you will for a human Hallelujah in word my son-in-law had his dog uh no not a friend a friend of mine had his dog in the car and the son and he just run in the store just to get something right out but a lady was there when he come out had a phone calling in on him and he says what you doing she said that is animal cruelty you going to kill that dog and all is he said Miss I just run into the store he I'm I know the dog was in the car you better get him I don't play that I said man she's upset about the dog and people killing babies 44,000 babies a year die left in the car Hallelujah in other words in a lot of it people got enough money to pay the way out of it right but people see felonies in his head how felonies in because what what callus them felonies to be accepted because men have not been able to discern between right and wrong when you lose your knowledge of how to discern between right and wrong how can you judge a nation right right when they'll call evil good and good evil amen let me look here real quick this ain't going to keep you all night but I want you notice we have come so weak and over the last let's say last 25 years with our Christian vales we know that we realize that this nation as a nation had rejected God 1956 she had a chance to receive it or turn around but the Bible say when you receive not the knowledge of the truth how then never remain no more sacrifice for your sin so now the knowledge of the truth was presented the people say we don't want it we want our freedom they chose to be mocked with death yes sir freedom is not being able to go out here and buy cigarett when you want to and buy B when you want that is not freedom freedom is when you know when I lay down at night I know where my soul rest H that's real Freedom that's right so we begin to look here because I say our nation was founded on value Christian value in God we trust I understand when they sat around and had meetings they would sat around the table all the coms and them guys in big offices they would sat there around the table and they would bring an empty chair and they would lead there for the invited guest Jesus Christ that when we were standing for something now they sat around the table and they do got an invited guest Jack Daniel it is a spirit it is a spirit but was it is a spirit but no longer they got the word as the absolute right pray because people is calling bad the good bad and bad good now I'm going to show you I'm going to throw this little thing in here and I want to baby like those saying stir up your mind in the way of remembrance I want brother way to come and read something real quick I was looking up in the Law Dictionary legal guidance you anybody got that book is ever law that was this nation was founded on was in this book ever law that this nation said that was a law and this is what we stand for at this time it was it was a law but for some way how did this law get swept under the rug yeah come here go to the mic and read it to us that one at the top crimes against nature sexual deviations which were considered crimes at common law and have been carried over by statutes include solomy and beastality solomy and beastality is in the Law Dictionary mhm yep that's it yeah that's it what happened to that law yeah when men heart turn from God right that's what happened because God can not destroy a nation until Nation totally reject him order St Luke 17:30 could not be fulfilled until that happened when laws that we once stood for it was beastality salamy when two men mating with each other was actually a crime against nature right but now it's accepted as marriage I can find a lot of things to go to hell for but that ain't one of them yeah right that is not one of them right but see what I'm say to say why did they do this because men's Hearts have turned from God they don't want to hear God a girl sneez the other day and some somebody Snee she said bless you they put this girl in court wonder what they say when somebody use the Lord name in vain yeah I ain't heard nobody go to court for that H I ain't heard nobody go to court for using the MF words and all this kind of stuff nobody went to jail for that or went to court for that but you say bless you then it become a crime they no longer can discern wrong from right we living right here now we don't need no interpretation we at the end time hallel that was going to happen say as it was in the days of Norah see we tried to try to make the events happen but we couldn't make them happy we had to happen according to prophecy to happen now I just thought I thought this is this is actually another message I'm on right here but it's so good it fits so good with this message that I brought in so I want you to notice here before God can ever burn this nation this Solomon Spirit had to raise because that was what they burnt solom Kamar for for the inmal level for the men's the women's did change the natural youth what was he preaching here and women begin to go with women and men begin to go with men what was he preaching there souls in prison right how souls in prison because he said he gave them over to a reate a mind that cannot repent anymore that's it turn them over to a reprobate mind to do those things in the flood pity now I ain't got a reason to destroy the nation so now I ain't got a reason to let storms come anytime they want to he got a reason to let hurricanes come anytime they want to he got a reason to let earthquakes come anytime they want why because there's no way to hold it all because the world have rejected him only reason they ain't destroyed yet the bride is still here the bride is still here thank you Lord that's right let me just show you if you never looked at it it's a strange I think maybe when I looked at it last time it was 19 states have accepted same seex me marriages it was only 19 States was left every other state had they accepted now I don't know how many it is now they have accepted same seex marriages but believe me the world going to go right and

finish this thing up let me just use this man I don't know how I got on that I'm running into two messes excuse me but I want you to notice just real quick I want to speak a little bit about PR the benefits of PR the benefits you know prison do have benefits you know you said what it is it was a guy that was sick real bad sick and he didn't have no money no insurance but he needed operation and so what he did he got him a big brick he walked through the window th through a store oh you know you going to jail soon as he throw that them cops was there took him to jail found out he had a pded that he need to be go to surgery because once you get in prison once you go to jail and once you go to prison you no longer blown to yourself right you don't in other word the prison now you getting prison no benefits you get three bills a day how three meals a day and all your health worker how if you need an operation that prisoner is responsible to see that you get it if you need a teol The Prisoner is responsible to see that you get it but you are their property on you go to bed when they say go to bed you get up when they say get up you don't do your own thing you do what they tell you to do you a prisoner you don't blown to yourself you got a testmaster to tell you what to do I leave you he tell you say we going to bed at 9:00 tonight and you got a movie you want to see at 10:30 it don't matter right 9:00 the lights go out you are a prisoner for that you are you are you are a prisoner to that state right right and that state if you die whatever happened to you they're responsible right good benefits that why you find people that don't want to be free they love to go back to prison because they know you know I got a friend right now he called me several years back
