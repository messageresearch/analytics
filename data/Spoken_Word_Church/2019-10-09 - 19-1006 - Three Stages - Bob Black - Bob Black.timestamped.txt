[0:02] [Music]
[0:07] so this morning that's going to go
[0:11] through some scriptures and just kind of
[0:13] do a little bit of study so before we
[0:19] get started let's just go to the Lord in
[0:21] prayer
[0:22] I've got myself grateful to you to be
[0:24] able to gather together around the word
[0:25] within the history floor and learn more
[0:27] about you oh my god should this be with
[0:29] us today
[0:30] bless the services Melissa the wait is
[0:32] administered to the services today let's
[0:34] build a bagel or does he
[0:36] mr. Dedalus afternoon yes we're in a
[0:38] bunch English you can just take care of
[0:40] us all in the US and bless the city
[0:44] amen
[0:47] so I'm just kind of take a look at the
[0:50] three state you know Brown said in many
[0:52] meeting many times about three stages
[0:55] and all the different old tests on the
[0:57] types of three stages three pulls and
[1:00] three three this and three that and so
[1:03] we're gonna just kind of look at the
[1:05] three stages of the games of a Christian
[1:07] just by going through some some
[1:09] scripture this morning so I'm going to
[1:12] start at Romans chapter eight and we
[1:14] were trying to get this blown up enough
[1:16] so that it was visible on the screen I
[1:18] hope everybody can see that solo Romans
[1:29] chapter eight verse 1 we will be done
[1:31] about verse 23 or so and he's gonna
[1:33] comment along the way so check verse 1
[1:37] says there is therefore now no
[1:39] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:41] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:44] after the spirit there's no there's
[1:48] therefore now no condemnation they like
[1:50] it like Paul said in another scripture
[1:51] who can hold anything to the charge of
[1:54] God's elect
[1:54] okay look at chart ghazal it because
[1:56] once once you're in Christ that your
[1:59] soul is made absolutely perfect nothing
[2:02] nothing at all wrong nothing else is
[2:04] required for your soul because God is
[2:07] abiding in your soul he's living in the
[2:09] so therefore your justify the walk not
[2:13] after the flesh but after the spirit for
[2:15] the law of the spirit of life in Christ
[2:17] Jesus has made me free from the law of
[2:20] sin and death for what the law could not
[2:23] do and that it was weak through the
[2:25] flesh God sending his own son in the
[2:28] likeness of sinful flesh and for sin
[2:30] condemned sin in the flesh to the law
[2:34] the law could not make us righteous and
[2:36] the law was really sent to kind of
[2:38] magnet to expose to us the sense that we
[2:41] need something and I kind of like to
[2:45] compare it if you've ever seen
[2:47] Ray Comfort he's he's kind of an
[2:50] apologist or like somebody that really
[2:52] knows how to defend the face and he's
[2:53] got some videos on behind them he'll
[2:55] actually go out to the streets and wait
[2:58] and present the gospel people standing
[2:59] outside courthouses and different things
[3:01] in the way he does it is he'll go
[3:03] through the Ten Commandments he goes
[3:04] through the law and presents the law to
[3:06] people and by presenting the law had
[3:09] exposes that they need something so
[3:11] she'll say have you ever told a lie have
[3:14] you ever committed adultery and and when
[3:17] you're presented with the law you and
[3:20] he'll saying you know about adultery
[3:21] well as Jesus said if you've even looked
[3:24] at somebody
[3:25] another perfect
[3:26] a woman with lust in your heart so he
[3:28] magnifies it in front of them and
[3:29] exposes their sensual you know and then
[3:33] they begin to realize that when because
[3:35] the law was presented to them that they
[3:37] need something but the law all the works
[3:39] of the law is not what could never make
[3:41] us righteous yeah it's we we we needed
[3:45] something and so that's that's where you
[3:47] know even when preaching you know you
[3:48] you uh you can't breathe just grace you
[3:51] got to preach the law the law as Wilson
[3:53] presented wouldn't follow it up great so
[3:55] that so that they know people know that
[3:59] there that that that the satisfaction of
[4:03] the law was made in the atonement that
[4:06] Christ died for us and that if we
[4:08] believe on that and and trust in the
[4:11] atonement
[4:11] then that will be young will give us his
[4:15] righteousness and that is the
[4:16] satisfaction of the law for whether the
[4:19] law could not do in that it was weak
[4:22] through the flesh
[4:36] Ray Comfort
[4:43] and that it was weak through the flesh
[4:45] God sending his own son in the likeness
[4:48] of sinful flesh and for sin condemned
[4:50] sin in the flesh that the righteousness
[4:52] of the law might be fulfilled in us who
[4:55] walk not after the flesh but after the
[4:58] spirit
[4:59] so the righteousness of the law was
[5:02] fulfilled by God manifesting himself in
[5:04] us and a lot of times even we kind of
[5:06] lose sight of the fact that we're not
[5:08] here just to kind of do do the works but
[5:10] we're we're here I was in life it's Jax
[5:13] but I feel the law so when God is making
[5:16] manifest in your life is word it's you
[5:18] actually walking out the law and being
[5:20] the actual fulfillment of the law for
[5:23] your day of the word for your day
[5:24] because you that's that's really the
[5:28] only way for the law to be expressed as
[5:31] by the spirit so let's just lay there
[5:36] after the flesh do mind the things of
[5:38] the flesh but they that are after the
[5:41] spirit the things of the Spirit for to
[5:44] be carnally minded is death but to be
[5:47] spiritually minded is life and peace
[5:52] because the carnal mind is enmity
[5:55] against God for it is not subject to the
[5:59] law of God neither indeed can be so then
[6:03] they that are in the flesh cannot please
[6:06] God in other words they that are
[6:08] motivated by the things of the flesh
[6:10] they that are in the flesh means those
[6:13] that are that are motivated and
[6:14] following that law of the flesh and
[6:18] following the will of the flesh instead
[6:21] of following the mind of God in but he
[6:24] are not in the flesh that's kind of made
[6:26] me a strange way
[6:27] right because we're we're physically
[6:30] where we're in this tabernacle of the
[6:32] flesh but you're not in the flesh
[6:34] doesn't mean that you're not in this
[6:36] tabernacle of the flesh but you're not
[6:37] motivated by the things of the flesh
[6:39] because you're you've got a the mind of
[6:42] Christ in you to move you to lead you in
[6:45] the guide you if so be that the Spirit
[6:48] of God willing now if any man have not
[6:51] the Spirit of Christ he is none of his
[6:53] and if Christ be in you the body is dead
[6:57] because of sin but the Spirit is life
[7:00] because of righteousness
[7:02] so then Paul he's starting to get into
[7:05] something you got kind of a strength
[7:07] like a conflicting an environment with
[7:09] it you've got the body is is dead but
[7:12] there's something inside of you that can
[7:14] make that body obey the obey the will of
[7:17] God that something that's the soul of
[7:21] God can make the body can bring the body
[7:23] into subjection and bring it into
[7:25] obedience just like Billy Graham talked
[7:27] about that a solar system where you
[7:30] become like the soul is like the Sun and
[7:33] the planets rotating it about it might
[7:35] might be your five senses and that soul
[7:38] on the inside brings the outside into
[7:41] into harmony and moving everything and
[7:43] in the correct cadence moving it in the
[7:46] rhythm of the word so it brings the body
[7:50] into subjection to the life of God on
[7:52] the inside
[7:58] there's a spirit of him that raised up
[8:01] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he
[8:03] didn't raise the Christ from the dead
[8:05] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[8:08] his Spirit that dwelleth in you in other
[8:11] words it's gonna weaken it to life it
[8:13] will make that body or bring that body
[8:15] into subjection now that's the whole
[8:18] story of the message is that is that
[8:20] when you're born again you see you have
[8:23] trouble in the flesh and you'll have
[8:24] trouble and you'll always be prickly
[8:27] brother Graham said until until your
[8:30] last step but that story is the whole
[8:32] story is that it is the rising of the
[8:34] Sun and when that life comes into that
[8:36] body into the word then it will bring
[8:39] you it won't slowly bring your senses
[8:41] here your men will reason consciousness
[8:44] every aspect of you into subjection to
[8:46] the word and that's the power of the
[8:49] word there is power in the gospel it's
[8:51] not we're not we're not just listening
[8:52] for the word vain words of some man but
[8:55] we're actually listening to the Word of
[8:57] God when you read the Bible it's the
[9:00] Word of God actually coming to pass in
[9:03] your in your members and bringing your
[9:05] whole beating into subjection to the
[9:07] order therefore brethren we are debtors
[9:11] not to the flesh to live after the flesh
[9:14] for you to live after the flesh he shall
[9:17] die but if you do the spirit do mortify
[9:19] the deeds of the body ye shall live in
[9:23] other words there's something that you
[9:25] got to do you got to eat the word
[9:28] constantly be sincere living humility
[9:32] destroy the works of the flesh but Bob
[9:35] just like your attitude say I don't want
[9:38] to live like this and you open yourself
[9:40] up to the Word of God and that's killing
[9:43] the DS
[9:45] [Music]
[9:46] for but if you through the spirit do
[9:49] mortify the deeds of the body
[9:50] each shall live for as many as are led
[9:53] by the Spirit of God they are the sons
[9:57] of God now that's the powerful scripture
[9:59] because that means that the Spirit of
[10:02] God is actually something that can
[10:03] motivate you that this this more than
[10:05] just being educated into into the
[10:08] mitches there's actually a person that
[10:10] we're talking about there's actually a
[10:12] person that can lead you in your walk
[10:13] they can instruct you in everything from
[10:16] where to get a job or where to go to
[10:18] school what to do with yourself the
[10:20] purpose in life they can motivate you to
[10:22] make great decisions in life but small
[10:25] decisions big decisions my program said
[10:28] the reason that he speak he raised that
[10:30] little fishie from the dead instead of a
[10:32] big event was to prove to us that God
[10:35] cares about the little things he cares
[10:37] about everything from the small to the
[10:39] great and and he's leading us he's
[10:42] leading us by a spirit and so uh when
[10:45] you when you begin to that's what he
[10:47] wants us to have a fellowship with him
[10:49] not just not just to kind of just kind
[10:51] of learn it like you're going to school
[10:53] where but this is like I was talking
[10:55] about Wednesday night this is a love
[10:57] relationship with God we're actually
[10:59] we're actually learning more about him
[11:01] because we're in a relationship with him
[11:03] not just not just to study call it's not
[11:07] just a cold ed formal religion there's a
[11:10] spirit of a living God that we're
[11:11] following for you have not received the
[11:14] spirit of bondage again to fear but you
[11:16] have received the spirit of adoption
[11:18] whereby we cry
[11:20] the father so here we're getting into
[11:22] the three stages of the gross growth
[11:24] process when you're born again and I've
[11:27] talked about this before when you're
[11:29] born again you begin to like a baby when
[11:32] it's born it's supposed to be the first
[11:34] thing that comes with when it's born
[11:35] first thing that it sees is this day is
[11:38] it comes out and it says how about
[11:41] father and that's the same way when
[11:43] you're born again you begin to see God
[11:45] you begin to see that's that's what
[11:48] other M said the evidence of the new
[11:50] birth is a personal revelation of Jesus
[11:52] Christ to you personally and and when
[11:55] you come when you're born again and you
[11:56] come forth and you see the father
[11:58] you begin to it begins to appear you and
[12:00] how he what he is and that's something
[12:03] personal to you that's why you know it's
[12:07] wonderful that you know to share a
[12:09] testimony and things and you hear a
[12:11] preacher preach about things but that's
[12:14] all things that are it can be
[12:16] third-person something that they've been
[12:18] through it's got to be something that
[12:19] you personally have known already and
[12:23] then it becomes then you know what it
[12:26] means to cry out a lot because you're
[12:28] seeing the father for yourself
[12:30] the spirit itself took Celeste that's
[12:33] ground floor that's the first stage and
[12:36] and if we have time to look through some
[12:39] some different things that brother Ram
[12:41] said and just kind of go through the
[12:42] different scriptures in the Bible they
[12:45] talked about these three stages to kind
[12:47] of really expose that brother branham
[12:49] didn't make this stuff up it's actually
[12:50] in the scripture all of these things
[12:53] come from when he's talking about three
[12:55] pools and three stages we we would have
[12:58] no idea about these things that without
[13:00] a prophet coming but he didn't just make
[13:02] this up it's all throughout the Bible
[13:04] from the beginning to the end the spirit
[13:08] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[13:10] that we are the children of God so you
[13:13] say well I don't know if I have
[13:15] well get into the word and and seek his
[13:19] spirit and he will bear with us to you
[13:21] that whether or not that you have it and
[13:25] if children then heirs heirs of God and
[13:27] joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we
[13:30] suffer with him that we may be also
[13:31] glorified together because he's bringing
[13:35] us to a place of glorification right
[13:37] where I reckon that the sufferings of
[13:40] this present time are not worthy to be
[13:42] compared with the glory which shall be
[13:44] revealed in us that's maybe something
[13:46] that we decide of awfulness
[13:49] is the end of the road and you know what
[13:52] we preach about that so many times that
[13:54] God in the death before the foundation
[13:57] of the world he had a picture of you in
[13:58] his mind and it was not as a little baby
[14:00] and it was not as an old person but it
[14:03] was in the prime of your youth it's a
[14:05] full-grown person walking in the statute
[14:08] of a perfect maintenance that's the
[14:10] picture that God had a meal and so
[14:12] that's that's the investor end of the
[14:14] road so you know when you go through
[14:16] heartaches and troubles and things just
[14:18] kind of keep that in mind that God is
[14:21] molding you into his image and it might
[14:23] be rough and it might be tiresome and
[14:26] struggles and everything but there's a
[14:28] purpose and a plan in God in God's mind
[14:30] for her here is that first verse 19 this
[14:33] is God's purpose for you for the artist
[14:35] men expectation of the creature waiteth
[14:37] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[14:41] the creature the creature ears look out
[14:43] all creation and all creationism is is
[14:46] looking for somebody to be on this earth
[14:49] with these virtues may manifest in you
[14:51] so there's the second stage the second
[14:54] stage of your growth is to have all
[14:56] these virtues in there and then he's
[14:58] sealed in by that holy and brotherly
[15:00] kind
[15:00] the Holy Ghost sealing all these virtues
[15:02] in you into that into that person
[15:04] somebody that we're at what the spirit
[15:08] of their spirit of the memory reason
[15:10] Constance affection all those things
[15:12] give way entirely to that to that soul
[15:15] pushing out so that all these things can
[15:18] be made manifest that you got it they
[15:19] got a manifested son of God walking and
[15:23] talking just like the father for the
[15:25] creature was made subject to vanity not
[15:27] willingly but by reason of him who has
[15:29] subjected the same in hope that the
[15:32] creature didn't make or was not made
[15:34] subject to vanity because of because of
[15:36] our decision because if we wanted to but
[15:40] God allowed these things to happen so
[15:42] that his word could be made manifest
[15:45] because the creature itself also shall
[15:48] be delivered from the bondage of
[15:49] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[15:51] the children of God from we know that
[15:54] the whole creation groaneth and
[15:56] travaileth in pain together until now
[15:58] why because it's it's the Word of God is
[16:03] being produced just like a woman in
[16:05] labor push at birth pains like
[16:07] programmed push down the whole creation
[16:08] groans and travails the calls because
[16:11] the son of man is being birthed by the
[16:14] word and and in every age the word was
[16:18] being pitted their word was being
[16:20] produced but now the culmination of all
[16:22] things now as the time for this this
[16:25] entire picture to be produced and and
[16:28] we're looking at I'm looking at it right
[16:30] now and that's that's a that's amazing
[16:34] when you think about it and not only
[16:38] they but ourselves also which have the
[16:40] firstfruits of the Spirit even we
[16:44] ourselves groan within ourselves waiting
[16:47] for the adoption to wit
[16:52] of our body so what's adoption adoption
[16:55] is when you come to a place where God
[16:58] can reveal something it was not revealed
[17:00] to eating in other church ings the
[17:03] secret or the revelation is like us it's
[17:06] not like a secret like we're looking for
[17:08] that lost tape the program preached or
[17:10] or that little secret phrase but see the
[17:15] simplicity of the gospel is that it
[17:17] starts with justification sanctification
[17:19] - baptism the Holy Ghost and that
[17:21] mystery keeps unfolding until it comes
[17:25] to its fullness and if the whole thing
[17:27] is really that simple justification
[17:30] sanctification of the baptism only goes
[17:32] away and this is implicitly gospel just
[17:35] keeps magnifying it's it's like a little
[17:37] baby growing the little baby when it's
[17:39] born has it's got ten toes and ten
[17:41] fingers it's got everything that an
[17:43] adult will have it starts out with hair
[17:46] and start several toenails all those
[17:48] different things but when it grows up
[17:50] it's all that is magnified it's come
[17:53] into a full grown condition so waiting
[17:57] for the adoption to wit or to understand
[18:00] the redemption of our body in other
[18:02] words to understand that I am NOT going
[18:04] to die to understand that they're up to
[18:07] have a supernatural revelation that my
[18:10] body will be changed and there is
[18:12] nothing that can stop that that's what
[18:15] the that's what adoption is to wit that
[18:17] the revelation of the body and and
[18:20] that's why these Church ages didn't did
[18:23] not come to that revelation it took God
[18:26] coming with a capstone message to open
[18:29] the books to reveal to us that that
[18:32] hidden mystery that God has revealed
[18:35] them since it restores back to their
[18:37] understanding that there's a growth
[18:39] process them and all these things they
[18:41] go into the message so let's look at
[18:43] this for a second let's look at these
[18:46] three stages in the scripture
[19:08] so first Peter first Peter chapter 2 he
[19:11] said wherefore laying aside all malice
[19:14] and all guile hypocrisy and envies and
[19:16] all evil speakings as newborn babes
[19:19] desire the sincere milk of the word that
[19:22] you may grow thereby if some be ye have
[19:27] tasted that the Lord is gracious now see
[19:30] that's where when you read the Bible
[19:32] there's a bucket of hidden things
[19:36] revealed in between the letters and so
[19:39] because it may be maybe when you were a
[19:41] newborn baby you read this and then
[19:43] you're just talking about any any of you
[19:45] you read to that's what he's just
[19:47] talking about we need to study but he's
[19:49] talking about these three stages as
[19:51] newborn babes desire the sincere milk of
[19:55] the word then you make room their life
[19:58] if so be he of takes it that the Lord is
[20:01] gracious to whom coming as unto a living
[20:05] stone disallowed indeed of men but
[20:11] chosen of God and precious the ye also
[20:14] as lively stones because in this whole
[20:17] body of Christ you are a stone eating
[20:21] them mix up like little little pyramids
[20:25] with in this great big pyramid you are
[20:28] little few minutes that go into this
[20:30] building and you're you're not like a
[20:32] rock that can't move or something but
[20:35] you're a lively stomach our built up a
[20:40] spiritual house an holy priesthood you
[20:44] you all of these lively stones built up
[20:46] together a spiritual house for God to
[20:50] dwell in because down through the seven
[20:53] churches
[20:54] culminating in the Saints that makes
[20:56] that makes the complete Bride of Christ
[20:59] and God is dwelling in his bride and
[21:03] holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[21:06] sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus
[21:09] Christ wherefore also it is contained in
[21:12] the scripture behold I lay in Zion
[21:14] our chief Cornerstone in other words
[21:17] that the capstone is shaped just like a
[21:19] cornerstone mr. parsall
[21:22] Jesus Christ is our cornerstone that's
[21:24] the thing the revelation of Jesus is
[21:26] that the thing that our new birth is
[21:28] founded on is the foundation of the
[21:31] entire Christian journey and he will
[21:34] also be the head he's the head and the
[21:36] corner and and this whole picture the
[21:39] whole pyramid is Jesus Christ revealed
[21:43] it's revealed all together in this bride
[21:46] an individual I lay in Zion a chief
[21:52] Cornerstone that led to precious and
[21:54] indeed that believeth on him shall not
[21:56] be confounded in other words he didn't
[21:59] believe it on him will not be confused
[22:00] you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[22:02] when it's revealed to you and you'll
[22:04] you'll have an understanding that will
[22:06] not make you be tossed about and running
[22:10] around wondering what's what's what
[22:11] what's what's down what's up unto you
[22:15] therefore which believe he is precious
[22:17] gainers be disobedient the stone which
[22:19] the builders disallowed the same is made
[22:21] then a doctor came and a stone of
[22:25] stumbling and a rock of offense even to
[22:28] them which stumble at the word being
[22:30] disobedient where are two Hafsah they
[22:32] were corner a stone of stumbling because
[22:35] it seems so simply people it seems kept
[22:38] so confusing and and it just makes
[22:41] people stumble over the revelation of
[22:44] the Lord so let's go
[22:54] where it says he says it's our off on
[22:57] verse 12 for when for the time ye ought
[22:59] to be teaching you have need that one
[23:01] teach you again which be the first
[23:02] principles of the Oracles of God and are
[23:05] become such as have need of milk and not
[23:07] of strong for for he's telling young Eva
[23:11] grow up a little bit you don't need to
[23:13] get up where you can start understanding
[23:15] the things in the in the promised land
[23:18] keep that old corn of the land if they
[23:22] eat the mysteries for every one that
[23:24] uses milk is unskillful in the word of
[23:26] righteousness for he is a vain but
[23:29] strongly belong it for them that are a
[23:31] fool age even though I really use have
[23:35] their senses exercised to discern both
[23:37] good and evil so he's saying again there
[23:41] isn't a scripture that you start off
[23:42] with a bang wrote a full Ange mystery to
[23:47] know Galatians
[23:55] now I say that the air as long as he is
[23:58] a child because now now this is the
[24:01] second stage you start off as a baby and
[24:04] then you're a child and finally you're a
[24:07] man or a woman in the in the script now
[24:10] I say that the air as long as he as a
[24:13] child so he's coming up on the beach now
[24:15] with a baby anymore-- differeth nothing
[24:18] from a servant though he be the Lord of
[24:20] all but is under tutors and governors
[24:22] until the time appointed of the Father
[24:25] and so he's talking about you need the
[24:28] tutor of the Holy Ghost to nurse us and
[24:31] raise it was up until the tutor could
[24:34] say well he's looked people just like
[24:35] the father he's a child a child these
[24:38] child really those children you know
[24:41] disobedient you do stuff you like like I
[24:44] was preaching Wednesday night about you
[24:45] know David did a lot anyway I made a lot
[24:47] of mistakes we make a lot of mistakes as
[24:50] Christians and then the Lord will give
[24:51] us a little whipping I can come to
[24:53] church or sometimes the preachers give
[24:54] your little quickly yeah and you and you
[24:56] straighten up and and you and you and
[24:59] God keeps molding you into his image
[25:01] right so we start off with babies and
[25:03] then the world through the children keep
[25:05] growing up until we come up there's me
[25:10] visas for pull my disability
[25:29] yeah
[25:34] Ephesians 4 is talking about
[25:38] talking about how we're growing into the
[25:41] into the Grace and knowledge of Jesus
[25:44] Christ
[25:44] I might've found the wrong Scripture
[25:55] oh yeah this Ephesians 4:14 now for so
[26:01] he talks about how he gave fossil
[26:05] products fabulous powerful ministry for
[26:06] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[26:08] the ministry for the edifying of life
[26:10] Christ - we all come in the unity of the
[26:13] faith and the knowledge of the Son of
[26:15] God unto a perfect name stature perfect
[26:18] man unto the measure of the stature of
[26:20] the fullness of Christ so if you ever
[26:22] wondered where does the scripture say
[26:23] statue of perfect man and it doesn't say
[26:26] the word statue of a perfect man
[26:28] but that's description patience 4:13 the
[26:32] stature of the fullness of Christ unto a
[26:34] perfect man then we get support B would
[26:36] no more children though that's the
[26:40] second stage children tossed to and fro
[26:43] and carried about with every wind of
[26:45] doctrine by the sleight of men and
[26:47] cunning craftiness whereby they lie and
[26:51] linked to the seat especially the truth
[26:54] in love may grow up in them and all
[26:56] things which is the head even Christ and
[27:00] then we go to first correct
[27:05] I really like this tree
[27:15] we just get a few more minutes first
[27:21] Corinthians 13 is where he's talking
[27:22] about love let's start have charity
[27:28] never faileth but we know in part and we
[27:32] prophesy in part
[27:33] he said we we know we know what we're
[27:36] looking to play you through a glass
[27:37] darkly we see things heart Parcher but
[27:41] when that which is perfect is come then
[27:44] that which is in part shall be done away
[27:47] and then it goes in to see he's talking
[27:49] about growth when I was a child I spake
[27:53] as a child when I read I understood as a
[27:55] child I thought as a child but when I
[27:59] became a man I put away childish things
[28:03] for now we see through a glass darkly
[28:05] another word partial revelation you see
[28:09] the grace that God has shown us in this
[28:11] age that we we have the privilege to not
[28:13] be able to look partially to a glass
[28:16] darkly like looking at Jesus through a
[28:18] damp like maybe fogged over glass and
[28:21] you can see his image and kind of get a
[28:23] sense of his form and everything but now
[28:25] we can see him face to face through his
[28:27] word we can we can see him exactly the
[28:31] way all these mysteries and everything
[28:33] are are completely unfolded before us
[28:35] but the in face to face now I know in
[28:40] part but then shall I know even as also
[28:42] I am known
[28:43] and now abideth Faith Hope charity these
[28:45] three but the greatest of these is
[28:49] cheering why because charity let's go
[28:54] back to verse eight
[28:55] charity never faileth whether it be
[28:59] promising they shall fail whether they
[29:00] be shown and all these thing he talks
[29:02] about how the cherry bears all things
[29:04] believeth all things hopeth
[29:06] things and your shopping and so forth
[29:11] then all these virtues are made manifest
[29:15] evening you're completely a subjection
[29:17] to the Word of God which is warning your
[29:20] door and then we'll go back to
[29:30] [Music]
[29:32] seasons four eleven which is what we
[29:35] looked at earlier till we all come in
[29:37] the unity of the faith and of the
[29:40] knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[29:43] perfect man may be dispatched to the
[29:46] former she cries so they you've got
[29:48] three stages and it's important to look
[29:51] at to understand those three stages
[29:52] because when you read scripture then
[29:55] things like the story Ruth the story of
[29:58] Elijah going from the Gilgal school of
[30:01] prophets River Jordan
[30:02] Ruth deciding gleaning resting Abraham
[30:09] deciding god sanctifying a method with
[30:13] the burning lamp and smoking furnace and
[30:17] then meeting to some man all these three
[30:19] stages are
