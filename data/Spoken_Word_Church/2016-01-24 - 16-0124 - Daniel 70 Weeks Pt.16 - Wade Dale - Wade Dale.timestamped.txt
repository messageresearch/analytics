[0:51] minutes let everything settle down turn
[0:53] right back on for me too yeah Jim lays
[0:56] down for five minutes good everybody she
[1:00] removed but as we left last Sunday we're
[1:08] talking on this laughs and with my paper
[1:10] mill last week's yeah my ahead my dad my
[1:17] young at my get some timers you
[1:22] know all right so now yeah you turn on
[1:26] that ok we are horrible we're going to
[1:36] focus on this last week now we had many
[1:39] times before many times before we're
[1:44] showing this time period between this
[1:49] this parenthesis and this one here all
[1:53] right that is the 490 years that God
[1:58] promised the jeers and their Redemption
[2:01] all right it may go cable that we're
[2:03] on to that point right seventy times
[2:06] seven is 490 years all right Jesus in
[2:13] the scripture they asked him said how
[2:14] many times do you forgive someone he's
[2:17] at seven times he said no seventy times
[2:19] seven well that's kind of strange that
[2:22] he was telling them that Israel it's
[2:24] going to be four hundred ninety years
[2:25] before you retain all right to go
[2:28] through Redemption so we are how's Danny
[2:32] home he home ok Bo Danny's been in a
[2:36] hospital after the most of the week so
[2:38] hope everybody keeps men in prayer but
[2:42] he's doing okay now that means he's
[2:49] cranky and yeah I know anyway I like
[2:52] owner seem like I'm doing before take
[2:54] away from you how do you display hain't
[3:00] no place like home in hospitals are all
[3:02] right but it was a lot better to recover
[3:04] from the house alright so now the four
[3:09] hundred nine years now then we showed
[3:14] where the wild branch was brought in
[3:17] just going to try to bring you back
[3:18] everybody up we'll wrap so if if you
[3:22] really if you took this out and pull
[3:26] this and this together okay you would
[3:34] have had the 490 years consecutive 490
[3:40] years nobody understand that day man
[3:42] you'd have consecutive 490 years to
[3:46] fulfill the scripture but you got to
[3:48] remember that the scripture was written
[3:50] knowing that we would fall knowing that
[3:53] the Gentiles will be brought in so the
[3:56] scripture was written so that this would
[3:58] happen core knowledge God before
[4:03] knowledge wrote the Bible because they
[4:05] knew what was going to happen knew that
[4:08] we were going to all reject him at
[4:10] County Jews included and that he was
[4:14] going to
[4:15] paul says low i turned to the Gentiles
[4:17] all was the first church age messenger
[4:19] and during all this time now there was a
[4:21] lot of Israel let's say hold on there
[4:24] was a lot of Israelites individuals got
[4:28] if lot of individuals that were saved
[4:31] during this time but most of it
[4:34] especially from about right here to here
[4:36] with Gentile okay all right let's see
[4:42] they were saved at the Jews in the
[4:45] beginning at that clinic off they will
[4:46] say 120 was saved in the upper room but
[4:48] there was others added so it wasn't as a
[4:50] nation never Israel as a nation was
[4:53] saved or redeemed until we get over to
[4:56] here okay but the Gentiles 12 you know
[5:00] in continuance we come through here
[5:03] through the revelations chapter 1
[5:07] through 3 and we see the church ages the
[5:10] church ages is a Gentile age right now
[5:16] that's why I want you to see it um that
[5:20] right here though as soon as that last
[5:22] Gentile at save right here I mean yes we
[5:27] know for a fact there was an overlap
[5:28] because we're going to talk about this
[5:30] not this sunday but in two sundays from
[5:32] now we're going to kind of go through
[5:34] the 1947-48 Israel becoming a nation
[5:41] remember they gather it all together
[5:43] brother branham talked about it many
[5:44] times Israel gathering as a nation well
[5:47] they have to gather here so God can
[5:48] start dealing with them here that's why
[5:52] that God had to start bringing them
[5:53] together here it's going to be off on
[5:55] Omega even in the Jewish stems the money
[5:59] stamkos remember your alpha your alpha
[6:01] age is how the Alpha is the first okay
[6:05] first alphabet alpha your alpha bride
[6:09] okay its one guy what about tipping them
[6:13] Lord Jesus Christ no there was no
[6:15] strange doctrines like they are now
[6:17] there was some but most of your church
[6:20] was built this is built on the Apostles
[6:23] profits with the correct interpretation
[6:25] of the Bible okay if I got to the
[6:28] correct interpretation about you so it's
[6:30] got to end with the correct
[6:32] interpretation about now what happens in
[6:33] between is not correct interpretation
[6:37] diploma because when they started in
[6:41] here in ad I mean yeah an ad in 306
[6:48] hundred eighty they come in father son
[6:49] Holy Spirit church age from here to here
[6:52] and even part of this one I had a
[6:56] Trinitarian idea right so God had to
[7:01] restore Malachi 4 had to restore the
[7:05] faith of the father's to the children
[7:08] nobody John the Baptist did John the
[7:11] Baptist right here took the old father's
[7:15] from the Old Testament and restore them
[7:17] to the New Testament Gentile age all
[7:22] right that's Malachi 4 5 and he shall
[7:25] turn the hearts of the father's to the
[7:27] children hmm and the hearts of the
[7:31] children back to the father's a message
[7:37] of restoration to restore back they said
[7:42] Wayne saying that because God can't
[7:43] pattern Israel any other way pattern
[7:47] holds true watch remember what I told
[7:50] you there was no salvation in here of a
[7:52] group called Israel that's the Old
[7:57] Testament but they wouldn't they were
[7:59] cut but they had to be what 445 bc
[8:02] established them into what a nation so
[8:05] that God could start dealing with them
[8:07] and then the Messiah come to them they
[8:12] reject him all right so what's gonna
[8:17] happen over here God's got a somewhere
[8:20] right here bring it back to restoration
[8:24] as a nation he's going to restore them
[8:28] back as a nation okay I got all right
[8:32] I got to restore them back and then what
[8:35] does he do he begins dealing with them
[8:39] he said oh no well yeah he had the
[8:42] Gracie remember God had to bring him in
[8:44] as a nation if he said I'm only going to
[8:46] deal with you as a nation then he's got
[8:47] him storm back to that nation that
[8:49] nationality okay so God right in here
[8:53] this is in a lap over remember I told
[8:55] you all the church ages are like this
[8:58] truly because brother bridal calls it
[9:02] this lap over well there's people come
[9:04] now this age into this age okay but
[9:09] there's no lap over in the last church
[9:11] age this is the finishing of the Gentile
[9:15] age and the beginning of the what Jewish
[9:18] age are the age of the children of
[9:21] Israel right now what happened when they
[9:26] were beginning to come in who came on
[9:29] the same no man I'm just giving you this
[9:35] because I want you to we've got to turn
[9:36] our thought to this who was the son of
[9:39] man they crucified the son of man you
[9:42] can't kill the son of god we just went
[9:44] through seats three sons name son of God
[9:46] son of man son of David Wright they
[9:49] can't kill son of man I mean you killed
[9:52] son of man he killed son of God and then
[9:54] brother Brown said down through the
[9:56] church ages it was what Sun God Spirit
[10:00] God butt back here we're beginning from
[10:03] here to here what do you have right here
[10:06] I'm at a revelation again ok now we
[10:12] missed him here the Jews did the Gentile
[10:18] is dead the Gentiles accepted right here
[10:23] and receive the new birth Israel didn't
[10:26] sue so if this pattern holds true then
[10:29] this patterns got to hold the same
[10:31] troupe does this pattern at the ending
[10:35] of the Gentile age the Son of Man comes
[10:37] on the scene and this time they don't
[10:39] crucify they accept him just like we
[10:43] accepted a minute
[10:45] all right ok so the pattern has to hold
[10:49] so a man comes on the scene revelation
[10:55] of the Son of Man comes on the scene so
[10:56] the revelation son of man's gotta come
[10:58] on the scene in the last Turk age
[11:00] because without the revelation the son
[11:02] of man you can't consent a man to the
[11:04] rapture so our man's gotta be on same
[11:06] same take a rapture but when the Sun man
[11:10] goes up which is us in human flesh Sun
[11:13] man is all of us not God guards not
[11:15] coming down here until way back over
[11:17] here right right but right here that's
[11:21] what I said before I scriptures not only
[11:23] to the Jews when it says where you get
[11:25] those scars when you receive the new
[11:29] birth you had to see those cars if you
[11:34] can see those cars you didn't get
[11:35] morning and you so I didn't see them see
[11:36] their we're going in you what I mean see
[11:38] understand you need to understand those
[11:42] scarf he came visible to you through the
[11:46] word you got convicted to what happened
[11:50] and what you do you saw gone and gone
[11:54] born again what you think's going to
[11:56] happen right here they're gonna preach a
[11:57] sermon we read it last Sunday where did
[12:03] you get those scars he said in the house
[12:05] of my friend well he got it back here
[12:07] but the revelation is going to come
[12:09] right here okay they missed that
[12:11] revelation right there digital did the
[12:15] Gentiles accepted it the revelation
[12:19] Peter says there are the Christ the Son
[12:22] of the Living God jesus said upon this
[12:24] rock revelation I'll build my church
[12:27] well he built the church on sun god
[12:29] revelation all down through here this
[12:30] was all son of god but you had to come
[12:33] back to the Son of Man revelation to
[12:37] take a rapture okay so son man has to be
[12:41] back on the scene just like he was here
[12:43] except he's not in a body form he's in a
[12:45] mini member body form all right not one
[12:48] man brother Brad almost not beasts on
[12:50] lad
[12:53] he had the manosphere the son of man but
[12:57] he was ice on a man he was a beast on
[12:59] the man all right that's the same way
[13:01] you and I sure we're still sons and
[13:03] daughters of a living God but when we
[13:05] take a when we take a body change truly
[13:07] that's the son of man standing on earth
[13:10] again in a mini member buddy because if
[13:15] he would have had any problems in his
[13:18] self he wouldn't resurrect he was God he
[13:23] was God okay same way we're here we
[13:26] can't have problems for these right here
[13:28] for us once said this is important
[13:30] without needs and this added two things
[13:35] that we've got to understand about the
[13:37] body change you can't you can take a
[13:39] bunny thing you've gone by the great you
[13:42] know your Christians could look you say
[13:45] well what what's the big deal what a big
[13:47] deal is big deal is is uh this first
[13:51] church age had all this right but they
[13:56] didn't have a son of man revelation
[13:57] that's some God revelation but they're
[13:59] dead laying in the grave waiting on
[14:01] somebody alright same way was all down
[14:04] through the church ages they had a son
[14:06] of God revelation what think God died
[14:08] for their sins forgave them came into
[14:11] their life started taking up a bow and
[14:13] they started acting different okay
[14:16] pattern holds true everywhere so same
[14:18] thing is going to happen over here in
[14:20] this last part of Daniel seventy weeks
[14:25] the redemption of Israel I believe
[14:28] they're gonna have to go through
[14:28] justification sanctification in the
[14:30] baptism run all the goes to receive the
[14:32] new birth just like me and you did okay
[14:34] and and this church is built on it and I
[14:37] believe because you know one I went
[14:40] through it I went through justification
[14:43] sanctification baptism holds up sign
[14:44] tell you exactly where come through that
[14:46] can you or do you just walk into message
[14:49] church this amount
[14:52] that's my question to you go devices lot
[14:58] quicker I can smoking gambling on we're
[15:00] starting on church that's just
[15:01] sanctification that's just being
[15:04] sanctified no one gets you in the body
[15:06] now sure if you were in another age but
[15:09] that won't get you born again now you're
[15:11] not you're going on sure you might give
[15:12] you life of the gospel but you're not
[15:14] going on a raptor and you're on going up
[15:15] to a body change for sure only much see
[15:19] these were mature these were good tour
[15:21] people these are got to be mature people
[15:24] that's lame is restoring the faith of
[15:26] the children babbling babies Pentecostal
[15:30] baby back to what the original father's
[15:33] the background Twelve Apostles right and
[15:38] now we got I just want to get that in to
[15:41] show you that the pattern holds true
[15:43] everywhere Israel had to come back
[15:46] together as a nation before God would
[15:48] deal with him he dealt with them all to
[15:49] here with the prophets many times and
[15:52] they rejected him and then they rejected
[15:54] the true prophet but if there would have
[15:57] been no Gentiles and you would have just
[15:58] took this line and moved it right over
[16:01] to here they would have accepted him but
[16:05] see the Bible wasn't written that way
[16:07] the Bible was written with two prophets
[16:09] injected the Bible was written with 1260
[16:12] days to the juice Oh God knew that week
[16:14] you know there's a lot of things you can
[16:16] say well they're not have not been a
[16:17] father won't happen it really doesn't
[16:20] matter what is in the Bible to me are
[16:25] useless but what if we didn't the Bible
[16:31] was written it are you going to change
[16:32] Oh is he going to change the Bible just
[16:34] go to what you thought should happen no
[16:36] yep all right so remember now I want you
[16:42] to get something to this right here so
[16:45] this right here is God dealing with a
[16:49] Gentile people individuals right now but
[16:54] when we go in a rapture God comes back
[16:58] down into profits will read in just a
[17:00] minute for 1260 days now that's what you
[17:05] on your what's your chart nobody got
[17:08] your chart all right you need to bring
[17:10] this need to be with you need to be with
[17:12] you the whole time this needs to be
[17:13] important because this is where most of
[17:16] the contention is in the message brutal
[17:19] Elise was bringing up the other Sunday
[17:21] what is the contention well the
[17:24] contention is in a nutshell and then
[17:28] we'll go back and I'll read you the
[17:29] folks will do all that right at the end
[17:31] I'm going to some of this thing up with
[17:33] with about two or three weeks of
[17:35] forgetting the dates because the dates
[17:38] to me don't matter to us but it does to
[17:43] the gyms because there are date people
[17:45] there are timepiece so it means
[17:47] something to them that's why the feast
[17:49] days don't mean anything to us it's off
[17:51] to the juice right we're not guaranteed
[17:54] to fix nothing we're not well I can you
[17:57] show me the Bible where it says the
[17:58] Gentiles are guaranteed ten times you
[18:01] guarantee nothing nothing that's why i
[18:03] said before finally in the Bible where
[18:05] we're going to be in a wedding supper
[18:06] for 1260 days that's right but it still
[18:14] it's not a it's not a feast that we're
[18:16] talking about have nothing to do what
[18:19] we're talking about ok a feast day to us
[18:23] should be every day yeah ok feast of
[18:27] Pentecost is a daily to us but the Jews
[18:31] that's why say you got to get your brain
[18:33] back over in the Israel in the Jewish
[18:35] time because there is a day god told him
[18:39] he said on the fourteenth day after the
[18:41] first month of the year you gonna have a
[18:43] passover on that day you know go swap
[18:45] days it's gonna be 14 days you get ready
[18:49] for my feast gosh don't get God don't
[18:51] you get ready for your face you gotta
[18:54] get ready for his feet ok because their
[18:56] head yeah so most of the people in the
[18:59] message just in a nutshell because of
[19:03] some of the quotes that they
[19:04] misinterpret mr. prophet said because
[19:07] look brother I'm could not misinterpret
[19:09] the Bible he was a Bible preacher profit
[19:13] interpreter of the Divine Scripture so
[19:16] he can't be wrong
[19:18] in that aspect he can say 5000 and mean
[19:21] 500 that ain't got nothing to do that's
[19:23] just a human mistake and like I said
[19:27] last section I'm gonna say it one more
[19:28] time I do not care if 16 people fell off
[19:31] a bridge right I hope you understand
[19:33] what I'm saying I'm not belittling
[19:34] nothing but what I'm telling you is
[19:36] people are basing their salvation I'm
[19:38] not finding 16 people and a fell off a
[19:40] bridge you don't work hard you know what
[19:46] was really hard was for Isaiah to go to
[19:50] Hezekiah and say you're dying tomorrow
[19:53] get your stuff ready Hezekiah goes to
[19:58] praying as n goes back and sets down
[20:00] under a tree or whatever doing his going
[20:02] about if they duties delivered mail or
[20:04] whatever you know he's he's uh he's out
[20:07] there working yeah making honey and and
[20:11] God's over there saying Hezekiah heard
[20:14] your prayer now why didn't God just say
[20:17] Hezekiah that's all right you just
[20:20] you're gonna live another 15 years no he
[20:23] had me go back to Isaiah and go and i
[20:28] was there go Jess floor he said go back
[20:31] to Hezekiah cuz look no women he said
[20:35] well that's tough he told him read the
[20:37] Bible thus saith the Lord get your house
[20:40] ready you're gonna die well buddy let me
[20:42] tell you something if it was this age
[20:45] that's happened this man I mean we
[20:47] believe I mean that's going to happen
[20:50] but now if we were reading a commentary
[20:53] of that okay a message book let's put it
[20:58] that way we were reading the message
[20:59] book and brother Brown says I said Lord
[21:01] has a guy you're going to die and that's
[21:03] put in print that's our problem all this
[21:06] is them print and there you know on the
[21:08] video and Internet that's the whole
[21:11] problem with the whole thing the devil's
[21:13] got in and diluted the whole thing but
[21:16] if we ran a message but we're brother
[21:17] and sister said Lord John Henry you go
[21:20] down
[21:23] alright saying we just read that book
[21:25] say we don't get read all of them we
[21:28] read that book right and he says I said
[21:33] Lord John here in one week you're going
[21:34] to be dead two weeks later John here it
[21:36] comes in the store now what you gonna
[21:39] think that prophet was lying no I
[21:45] probably what line that prophet done
[21:47] what God told him to do the people the
[21:52] people the one who changed the mind of
[21:54] God see then you go back about two weeks
[21:58] later and if you have another message
[22:00] vote for brother Graham says well God
[22:01] woke me up in a vision and told me to
[22:03] tell go back and tell John Henry that
[22:06] he's heard his prayer and he'll live but
[22:09] what if you never got that book what if
[22:14] you just got one book that's what the
[22:15] imagined divorced guys and it was on
[22:17] what's his name up there and Jefferson
[22:19] Building I won't call it once it's
[22:20] Trevor yeah remember that you say that
[22:22] we'll see the people over in Africa they
[22:25] read a marriage and divorce book barossa
[22:27] Brennan said polygamy would be all right
[22:29] and it was legal back then and all that
[22:32] they don't read the other messages
[22:33] because they're going he said it right
[22:35] here you know cuz what they were doing
[22:36] pushing polygamy that brother branham
[22:38] was a polygamous preacher so if you read
[22:42] one book you just you just narrow minded
[22:45] but brother Bridal always and I love
[22:47] what Clark told me one time they stuck
[22:49] with me forever brother round said face
[22:52] final resting place is in the Word of
[22:55] God face fine when I put my face I'm
[22:59] gonna put my face on what the word shift
[23:00] now brother branham was a divine
[23:02] interpreter of that word so he could not
[23:04] be wrong when he come to major doctrinal
[23:06] issues man right so that's where I say
[23:13] because that was the son of man ministry
[23:16] he was preaching that's the same thing
[23:17] to come out of this man's mouth piece on
[23:19] the man had to be or we're not go Pat
[23:23] earn our patterns off it's not the
[23:27] Ministry of the same man who the son of
[23:28] man hears it was there yes ok so their
[23:32] contention is in the message cornered a
[23:34] few quote
[23:35] is that the seventy weeks of Daniel is
[23:40] going to totally end when the two
[23:43] prophets finished prophesying because
[23:45] they said Jesus freaks three and a half
[23:46] years here which was the first half of
[23:49] the 70th week which there's no way you
[23:52] can't put it in the Bible you can't put
[23:54] it in them in the time you can't put in
[23:56] the prophets message so that's wrong
[23:58] okay but they put two three and a half
[24:00] years back here of Jesus's ministry and
[24:02] then there's only three and a half years
[24:03] left of the 70th week according the
[24:08] Bible that's not true according the
[24:11] problem I suppose that is true that
[24:12] there's just two and a half years how do
[24:14] you ministry the two prophets unless let
[24:18] me show it let me give you some
[24:19] scriptures going to write them down not
[24:20] going to i'm not going to read them all
[24:23] but where i read some of them daniel 7
[24:25] 25 excuse me Daniel 12 we're going to
[24:35] talk about in just a few minutes Daniel
[24:38] 12 7 brother revelations 13-5
[24:48] revelations 11 3 and daniel 9 27 all
[24:56] speaks of a three and a half year period
[25:00] now look this is what they'll cost well
[25:02] once you don't want to be confused
[25:03] Daniel here says time 1 x 2 and a half
[25:12] one two three and a half that's three
[25:16] and a half years in Revelation 13 5 it
[25:20] says 42 months what's 42 months three
[25:25] and a half years alright revelations 11
[25:28] 3 says the two prophets will prophesy
[25:29] for 1,260 days alright got it 12 hour 60
[25:35] days and then Daniel 9 27 says in the
[25:38] midst of the week now what's the middle
[25:40] seven
[25:41] yeah okay that's why I according to
[25:46] Daniel 9 27 then in the midst of the
[25:49] week he'll break the Covenant what the
[25:51] Antichrist so if he breaks it into midst
[25:53] of the week we can only be smart enough
[25:55] to understand there's green have more
[25:57] left right it ok I mean let's but I got
[26:04] a quote well how's that head one day
[26:06] okay then you make I live all property
[26:12] you know jesus said many times he said I
[26:14] won't say some things in other words let
[26:16] me paraphrase 20th century I'm gonna
[26:18] paraphrase this for Jesus Jesus and I'm
[26:21] gonna say some things that you will not
[26:22] understand but the ones that spoke to
[26:25] whip wait you just said eat my flesh and
[26:32] drink my blood and he walked off he did
[26:34] not explain it but when the Holy Ghost
[26:36] fell on Paul Paul never heard jesus said
[26:39] that that's right now Matthew or mark or
[26:43] Luke or John my decoder will see
[26:45] remember mark and Luke didn't know Jesus
[26:47] it was really just Matthew and John they
[26:49] may have told Paul then one day Jesus
[26:53] said eat my flesh and drink my blood and
[26:54] walked off well even when they told call
[26:56] that the Holy Ghost quick and call and
[27:00] said oh I don't want he was talking
[27:01] about I have received the Lord that's
[27:05] which we read it ever communion Paul was
[27:08] the Institute ur of the communion
[27:10] showing that the body was the bread and
[27:13] the blood was the wine in symbolic so we
[27:17] eat his flesh and drink his blood that's
[27:19] what they were saying about the apostles
[27:20] remember when they couldn't find the
[27:21] body of Jesus alright so movie come out
[27:24] about that you see that there's a movie
[27:27] come out a big picture movie I saw the
[27:30] previews the other down on YouTube but I
[27:34] can't remain it's called risen but what
[27:37] it is it's a perspective from a Roman
[27:39] soldier trying to find the body of Jesus
[27:42] he's like a FBI agent he goes out tries
[27:45] to find the king and all are piloting
[27:47] all him like you got to find this body
[27:49] you know we we got
[27:51] this proof so what he has to do he has
[27:54] to go and find Jesus's followers and
[27:57] talk to them and ask them well I don't
[27:59] know if there's a conversion at the end
[28:00] but I mean this guy's just it shows them
[28:03] putting Jesus in the tomb and putting
[28:04] the seal on you know and then he
[28:06] introduced uh it's kind of like a modern
[28:08] day but it was back then you know so
[28:10] like a modern-day FBI he brings two guys
[28:12] in this is what happened there's a
[28:14] weirdo man to this rock started falling
[28:17] everywhere and you know the hearth
[28:18] earthquake and we heard this wind and we
[28:21] looked in the tomb and he was going well
[28:24] who stole it will hurt you know so they
[28:26] go and it might be something good to
[28:27] watch but but you ever but now remember
[28:35] right here his revelations 123 kind of
[28:39] go for some you just a little bit but
[28:41] revelations 41 revelations 1921 is this
[28:44] last part so everybody says that this
[28:46] right here is going to end the seventy
[28:49] weeks of Daniel when I broke I'll never
[28:53] taught that there's no way the Bible
[28:56] teaches that okay right but keeping your
[29:00] mind that three and a half years that I
[29:02] just told you about right there that's
[29:04] all of the Ministry of Jesus Christ is
[29:06] left on the face of the earth to the
[29:09] Jews got it 42 months all that I told
[29:15] you 42 months time time and a half time
[29:18] all that got it but we know for a fact
[29:23] that there's one week left after the
[29:25] rapture according to the Bible according
[29:27] the province message and like I said
[29:29] before according to the feast days that
[29:34] we're going to get into a little bit
[29:35] later alright but watch real simple here
[29:40] real real real real simple men will read
[29:44] the Bible says that seventy weeks are
[29:47] determined to do six things we rather
[29:51] there six things got to be accomplished
[29:53] inside of this excuse me 490 years all
[30:00] right nice Bible reading after that
[30:03] really
[30:04] interpretation seventy weeks are
[30:06] determined to and goes all through sit
[30:09] list six of them then what Gabriel does
[30:13] in Daniel 9 25 he starts to explain how
[30:18] right says he will be at seven there'll
[30:22] be a seven year period of 60 two-week
[30:24] period and prince that shall come shall
[30:26] destroy the city what I taught us in 80
[30:29] 70 never really speaks anything because
[30:31] look Gabriel is not an angel to the
[30:34] Gentile gable don't announce to the
[30:40] Gentiles Michael is our his army is our
[30:43] man okay all right but Michaels cries to
[30:46] everybody right what I'm saying his
[30:48] gable doesn't announce anything about
[30:50] the turkey he didn't say anything about
[30:51] getting off he just goes right in and
[30:54] says the prince is going to destroy and
[30:56] in the myth and then the press that
[31:00] shall come and the other one right here
[31:04] he's going to make a covenant with many
[31:06] for one way but he say well he said many
[31:10] he makes it with the whole world you
[31:13] don't just make it with the Jews now the
[31:15] Jews are the central factor right but
[31:21] remember the Bible talks about peace and
[31:23] he comes in with flattery he's got to
[31:25] get the whole world involved with
[31:26] getting now he's getting the whole world
[31:28] involved okay now at the end everybody's
[31:33] going to turn on Israel why so I said
[31:35] when he breaks that covenant he's going
[31:37] to break it to the Jews but what's going
[31:42] to happen is as the whole world's gone
[31:44] then come against Jews so the post or a
[31:48] say the Pope the Antichrist is gathering
[31:52] during that three and a half years you
[31:53] think he's taking a vacation he's not
[31:55] only to ride or ever you know smoking
[31:58] cigars and drinking wine he's working on
[32:02] this part and this right here is the
[32:04] Battle of Armageddon so he's got to get
[32:07] everybody together to destroy Israel
[32:09] Satan hates Israel and you don't think
[32:12] it's Satan inside of a man
[32:15] doing the work it is remember it was
[32:18] Satan inside of a man back in the garden
[32:22] right here Satan inside of a man same
[32:26] way here Twila calling the beast in the
[32:29] beginning and the beast in the end all
[32:32] right we're watching I mean listen to
[32:35] the seals and he distinctly that's where
[32:39] a lot of people tell us that no I'll
[32:41] take what he said in the cells over this
[32:44] book right here and exactly he
[32:47] distinctly said there are three only
[32:50] three light years left drawer after the
[32:53] rapture to the juice but he didn't say
[32:56] they what all the pasta cute right
[33:00] that's the problem you don't you don't
[33:03] listen to what he's saying because you
[33:04] can't say something hot contrary to the
[33:08] scripture because look if they
[33:10] prophesied for 1260 days and then
[33:12] they're killed the ministry is over
[33:16] alright then all heck's going to break
[33:19] legs when out how you're going to do
[33:21] these other three of the six whole
[33:24] purpose how you gonna put these three in
[33:26] here because what they say to make to
[33:32] make their theory correct all this goes
[33:36] over here but they never one time spoke
[33:37] on the six full purpose because they
[33:39] don't understand it and the seats fold
[33:42] purpose if you really go to studying the
[33:44] six volt purpose it explains to you what
[33:46] Dana said in two weeks is this has got
[33:50] to be after the redemption of Israel but
[33:54] look you say all business with them
[33:56] redemptions over while wearing Daniel
[33:59] it's just cool to Daniel 9 and I told
[34:05] you we're gonna hit this hard right here
[34:06] this is what I miss it yes good
[34:11] seventy weeks of terminal who that
[34:15] people and and and upon the holy city
[34:25] they know nothing about city over here
[34:29] this is people but what your hand this
[34:32] is people this is a redemption of Israel
[34:35] flesh guy this is the redemption of
[34:40] Israel to City bring in could wire the
[34:48] city set up the vision and prophecy will
[34:54] get into all these North the most holy
[34:57] all right then the 70 week period will
[35:04] in okay now let's go back to only work
[35:10] and then let's go back to Daniel 12 like
[35:13] I said something I hadn't seen good just
[35:17] sitting right there in the Bible cuz
[35:19] once and that time Michael Shiel stands
[35:21] out the great French with standard for
[35:22] children then there should be time of
[35:24] trouble such as never was since it was
[35:25] the nation where's that out that's not
[35:28] Michael standing up right here
[35:35] right here hmm this is going to be a
[35:40] tribulation period but the great
[35:43] tribulation is going to be right here
[35:45] that battle of Armageddon since there
[35:48] was a nation even to that same time at
[35:50] that time thy people shall be delivered
[35:52] what 144,000 going to go out I know
[35:57] right hand you can write it right here
[35:59] and this will mark that's the end of
[36:02] 1260 days when he breaks that covenant
[36:05] with the Jews they're going to come
[36:08] against Israel they're going to income
[36:10] class the Israel and they're going to
[36:11] fight against Israel okay and everything
[36:16] is going to be destroyed right now
[36:20] that's why I'm saying if everything is
[36:21] destroyed right there and the people the
[36:26] most of the preachers in the message say
[36:28] that that ends the seventy weeks of
[36:29] Daniel then something's wrong the only
[36:35] thing we're going don't I'm we're gonna
[36:36] bring in everlasting righteousness so
[36:38] provision profiting on come on trollese
[36:39] after of the battle armor getting over
[36:43] just come to me it's just read the Bible
[36:46] okay you say why why brother I'd say
[36:50] what he did I will explain that later
[36:52] okay one thing that time first 12 and I
[36:56] heard the man close the lemon which was
[36:58] part of the river know why Daniels still
[37:00] in the vision notice right hand left
[37:02] hand to Heaven I swear if I even live a
[37:03] friend that should be for a time times
[37:04] and a half when he shall accomplish
[37:07] together the power of the holy people
[37:08] all these things shall be finished
[37:11] people
[37:13] people and people three and a half years
[37:19] is the people Israel flesh and the holy
[37:24] city okay okay because really sure watch
[37:35] and I think I didn't minister to me not
[37:38] go watch that again but the first three

[37:42] suit for excellent indicative that's
[37:44] justification sanctification in the
[37:46] baptism holy go that bursts you into the
[37:48] body the first three the profits are
[37:52] going to pre is redemption finish your
[37:54] transgression making understand
[37:55] reconciliation for iniquity 33 things
[37:59] justification same protections about
[38:00] feeling holding up hi right then then
[38:07] you got your other three right here this
[38:09] is for the city because what what are we
[38:13] go you know you say well how do you know
[38:15] that well now the Bible tells us that
[38:17] right here when we come back in
[38:20] Revelations 1920 ones with the prophets
[38:22] in when we come back we come back to a
[38:24] city hmm I got it right here in Isaiah
[38:30] 65 alright we come back to a city in a
[38:34] temple built by the israel we don't

[40:09] and go a lot optician totally
[40:11] differently
[40:13] yeah and they shall free to get that
[40:15] part I thought you're going downhill
[40:17] when I starts and then when thought
[40:19] you're really going down and they shall
[40:21] build houses and inhabit them now that's
[40:23] not the future home right remember the
[40:27] future home is built by Jesus Christ
[40:29] himself according to our desires that's
[40:32] we on over here pass the whopper own
[40:35] judgment passed the Battle of Gog and
[40:37] Magog way over here so let's stay

[40:44] vineyards and eat fruit of them they
[40:46] shall not build in another inhabit see
[40:49] we build houses now then we give them to
[40:51] our kids you see what that's what
[40:52] they're saying we build houses they
[40:53] inherited because we die and we'll be on
[40:57] a diet is it going to build them at
[40:58] another there shall not build in another
[41:01] habit they shall not plant and another
[41:03] eat all right they shall not labor in
[41:08] vain I bring forth for trouble but they
[41:11] have the seat of the blessed of the lord
[41:12] and their offspring with them before
[41:14] they call our answer while there yet
[41:16] speaking over here the wolf and the lamb
[41:19] shall feed together he's coming out the
[41:20] Millennium okay come back the Millennium
[41:24] Linea rein good but what's got to get us
[41:28] there is this 70 weeks let's go let's go
[41:33] to verse 11 right here this is where we
[41:37] were at last Sunday will read this again
[41:39] and we really didn't get into it I
[41:40] wanted to but looking into it to sunday
[41:42] bro the least take your next sunday will
[41:44] be a blowjo greens this time for sure so
[41:47] and from the time that the daily
[41:49] sacrifice shall be taken away now what
[41:51] did we establish Jews and is the Jews
[41:56] and the Antichrist is going to make a
[41:59] covenant he's going to allow temple
[42:01] worship they're trying to get to my side
[42:03] bag 144,000 says he's already he's
[42:05] already hearing us he's going to break
[42:07] that covenant and the abomination is
[42:09] going to happen right here not here from
[42:15] the time that the daily sacrifice shall
[42:16] be taken away the abomination that
[42:18] maketh desolate set up there shall be
[42:23] 1290 days
[42:25] alright that's over here you said watch
[42:30] more than 1260 what we talked about here
[42:37] remember God doesn't roughly stop
[42:39] something then start something else he'd
[42:41] give up at lap over time here get a life
[42:43] over time here he's gonna have a lap
[42:45] over time here you tell you know that
[42:49] well how you gonna put 1290 days in
[42:52] there the Bible says it so we gotta go
[42:55] by what the Bible said all right in two
[42:59] weeks we'll probably try to get into
[43:01] that and i'm going to lay in here try to
[43:03] be here or at least watch it because
[43:06] from here to here it's going to be the
[43:13] battle all right barmageddon according
[43:21] to this prophets jar according to the
[43:23] Bible it's going to be 1290 days we got
[43:25] 1260 that's 30 more days over all right
[43:30] remember this is still to the Jews so we
[43:36] still going to put the feast days in the
[43:38] feast days are going to fit right in
[43:40] with these 1260 days here the 1290 and
[43:46] even the thirteen hundred and
[43:48] thirty-five
[43:53] it'll fit right into the feast days
[43:55] because they they will have a jubilee
[43:59] year and that's going to be there
[44:02] thousand-year millennial reign that's
[44:04] that you believe they're looking for
[44:06] okay here's we're looking for Jubilee
[44:08] year and I was watching a commentator of
[44:11] the other day and he did a really good
[44:12] job he said when God instituted that he
[44:17] said really there's no record of coming
[44:21] on for word that they used it he said
[44:27] because the rich people he said what if
[44:28] you accumulated well for 50 for 49 years
[44:31] and all of a sudden on that 50th year
[44:33] you got to give everything back and
[44:36] everybody starts pouring in he said the
[44:39] rich people Pharisees and all the ones
[44:42] by he said the rich people would not let
[44:44] them have their feast day I mean they're
[44:47] Jubilee year because they didn't want to
[44:49] give their money back Jews included she
[44:53] was included show me any old tests to
[44:55] show me the New Testament where they
[44:56] said work at work it says to howl that
[44:59] Jubilee here and do not do this and not
[45:01] do that but in history he shows that
[45:04] there's they really don't keep that that
[45:06] year because that year is if i buy bring
[45:11] her take her from you and two of acres
[45:13] from you and I've got 20 servants that
[45:15] that I brought in of yours and you know
[45:17] accumulate all as well when
[45:19] importing idea or the fiftieth year that
[45:21] Jubilee year I got to give you the 300
[45:23] acres back I got to give you your people
[45:25] back I got Hubie years back everybody
[45:27] starts at zero so nobody wanted to do it
[45:30] but right here is where are you undoing
[45:33] because everything's equal right there
[45:37] at jubilee here that's why brother Brown
[45:41] said that 1977 was the 7-inch Jubilee so
