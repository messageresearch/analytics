[31:45] have the headstone was taken away and
[31:47] now the headstone's back in the son of
[31:50] man Ministry The Headstone is Jesus
[31:52] Christ and he's in the body now getting

[32:19] we can't fathom having a day without a
[32:22] headache or a heartache or a trouble or
[32:24] a trial or a ache or a pain we can't
[32:26] fathom that but that's what we're going
[32:27] to
[32:28] that's what we're heading toward it's
[32:31] going to truly be a change
[32:34] and no so but as the song says Oh What A

[34:56] the word was with God and the Word was
[34:58] God
[34:59] and that word was made flesh that was
[35:02] the whole intent
[35:04] for that word to be made flesh
[35:06] and dwelt among us and we behold his
[35:08] glory the glory of the only begotten of
[35:10] the father
[35:11] fall
[35:13] of Grace and Truth fall
[35:15] of Grace and Truth II Peter 1 says
[35:17] besides this what besides the new birth
[35:21] giving all diligence add to your faith
[35:23] virtue and divert your knowledge
[35:24] knowledge Temperance tempers patience
[35:26] patience godliness godliness brotherly
[35:29] kindness and the brotherly kindness
[35:30] charity you may be seated that's what
[35:32] we've been working we've been working in
[35:34] faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[35:35] patience now we've been on godliness and
[35:39] now we're heading toward brotherly
[35:41] kindness
[35:44] I had this on I guess I must reached
[35:46] back there and cut it off I got I'm on
[35:48] now
[35:49] I thought I was on when I walked out
[35:51] here but okay anyway
[35:53] technology boot devil
[35:56] First Timothy Paul is telling us he says
[35:58] look without controversy great is the
[36:00] mystery of godliness we discussed that
[36:01] this morning great is that mystery
[36:03] because listen I'm telling you 99 of the
[36:06] world
[36:07] thinks they're not perfect not going to
[36:09] get perfect and there is no way to be
[36:12] perfect
[36:14] according to what the uh accepted
[36:18] intelligence of the day is
[36:21] the accepted intelligence of the day is
[36:23] is that we're all just a bunch of goof
[36:25] UPS we we you know we're not perfect we
[36:28] can't live this we can't live that
[36:31] I just wonder if you really sat down
[36:34] with a with a good Baptist or a
[36:36] Methodist or somebody and just just say
[36:38] look what is your opinion what is your
[36:40] thought
[36:42] on being perfect
[36:45] they're going to say well I you know I
[36:46] I'm I'm I'm this I have these issues
[36:48] with this I got a problem with that got
[36:50] this got that the other uh and and you
[36:53] can and what I would say to them they'd
[36:55] make him really mad I'd say well now I
[36:57] know what problem you got the problem
[36:58] you got is it's not that
[37:02] it's your Doctrine
[37:04] it's your Doctrine is what's bad that's
[37:06] right it's your Doctrine start with that
[37:08] start with the doctrine don't worry
[37:10] about I can't quit smoking worry about
[37:12] getting born again
[37:14] and get born again not by the second
[37:16] person of a Trinity right
[37:20] or the third person of the trinity
[37:22] uh and and what's your baptism
[37:27] uh uh what's your manner of life
[37:31] uh do you wear dressers all the time or
[37:33] do you do you do you dress like a man
[37:36] you gonna make him really mad after
[37:38] about right there
[37:40] and then they're gonna jump up and
[37:41] they're gonna say just exactly what I've
[37:43] always said and brother Dale said the
[37:45] same thing you ain't perfect I ain't
[37:47] perfect
[37:48] see they they cop to me that's a cop-out
[37:51] they want to move everything over to the
[37:52] side
[37:53] well the Holy Ghost is the one that's
[37:55] bringing it back over here so you know
[37:56] one thing's for sure they don't have the
[37:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost and their soul
[38:01] they have an anointing that tells them
[38:03] they need all these people that lives
[38:05] right
[38:06] right there's people I mean you good
[38:09] neighbors is like brother Dale always
[38:10] said you know you're good neighbors good
[38:12] neighbors are okay but if good neighbors
[38:14] are not Christians they're going to hell
[38:19] period
[38:21] they might go to heaven because of you
[38:24] but what if you ain't got the new birth
[38:27] hmm
[38:29] sometimes we put all this on well you
[38:32] know my neighbors being good to me you
[38:34] better make sure you're good
[38:36] you better make sure you got the new
[38:38] birth now if you don't have the new
[38:40] birth how can you cover them you can't
[38:41] cover yourself
[38:43] for true
[38:45] amen so let's get our own self covered
[38:48] first and then
[38:50] let them see the mystery of godliness
[38:54] they don't know how we live until they
[38:56] get the same Holy Ghost we got
[38:58] that's what I asked that preacher not
[39:01] too long ago I said look if you got the
[39:03] Holy Ghost and I got the Holy Ghost how
[39:06] do we act different
[39:07] well why
[39:09] why are we acting different sure you
[39:11] like hunting and I like fishing that's
[39:13] Humanity that ain't got nothing to do
[39:15] with with Bible Doctrine
[39:19] how can your Holy Ghost tell you that
[39:21] and then the my Holy Ghost tell me this
[39:24] same way in this message it's the same
[39:26] way we'll get to brotherly kindness
[39:28] brotherly kindness is just being ripped
[39:30] out all over the place nobody has love
[39:32] for anybody anymore even brother random
[39:34] in 1950 he said it's leaving
[39:37] in other words there's no more 1950 man
[39:40] in 1950 of course most of us weren't
[39:42] born but when I was growing up man
[39:44] everybody said hey everybody spoke to
[39:46] each other and now
[39:49] it's like if you hear your neighbor dies
[39:51] you hear it on the on the news
[39:57] yeah that's what I thought
[40:00] but you and I need to change that
[40:03] if we can't live it before our neighbor
[40:05] why we need to live in here
[40:08] if your people at your work don't think
[40:10] you're different you've got a problem
[40:12] if they don't see the difference you got
[40:15] a problem
[40:16] because you know why they're you're
[40:18] acting just like they are
[40:20] so it must be the same thing inside to
[40:21] use what they got in them
[40:24] well I'll preach it anyway
[40:26] but that's just about that's where the
[40:28] rubber meets the road folks and all's
[40:30] going to come down to our minor of life
[40:34] our conduct out there not in here
[40:39] Colossians 1 verse 21 says you that were
[40:41] sometimes alienated in enemies in your
[40:43] mind that's all of us by Wicked Works
[40:47] yet now hath he what he's reconciled and
[40:50] the body of his flesh through death to
[40:53] present you holy and unblameable and
[40:56] unrepute unreprovable in his sight
[41:01] if you continue in the faith grounded
[41:03] and settled and be not moved away from
[41:05] the hope of the Gospel which you have
[41:07] heard and which was preached to every
[41:09] creature which is under Earth where Paul
[41:11] I am made a minister who now rejoice in
[41:14] my suffering for you and fill up that
[41:16] which is behind of the Affliction of
[41:18] Christ in my flesh for his body's sake
[41:20] which is who the church wherefore I made
[41:23] a minister according to the dispensation
[41:25] of God which is given to me for you to
[41:28] fulfill the word of God even the mystery
[41:30] which hath been hid from ages and
[41:32] generations is what we're talking about
[41:33] today
[41:35] that's why great is the mystery of
[41:37] godliness but now has made manifest to
[41:39] his Saints to whom God would make known
[41:42] so God's going to have to make this
[41:43] known
[41:44] but he's not going to make it known to
[41:46] the newspaper
[41:48] it's not going to make it known to the
[41:49] radio
[41:50] he's going to make it known through
[41:52] flesh
[41:52] your flesh and my flesh no one else can
[41:56] live this Bible folks I'm telling you
[41:58] it's just like back at the Old Testament
[42:00] time you got people that that that the
[42:03] do's and don'ts in the Old Testament
[42:04] that that was a time that that was there
[42:08] but now you and I and I'll read it here
[42:10] in just a few minutes where we've come
[42:12] under a dispensation of Grace and we
[42:15] didn't get in that dispensation of Grace
[42:17] we're all going to hell
[42:20] The Ten Commandments we've already at
[42:23] least one of them ten we have a problem
[42:24] with
[42:27] well you can be quiet all you want to
[42:30] but it's the truth
[42:31] if it wasn't for Grace Now by Grace we
[42:34] can live those Ten Commandments by Grace
[42:35] those Ten Commandments it's not don't
[42:37] make them not in fact make sure you live
[42:39] them amen
[42:40] amen that's right I mean do you have an
[42:42] issue with killing somebody
[42:44] thou shall not kill
[42:46] well Jesus is fixing to tell us he said
[42:48] they say of old
[42:50] well brother Brown said if you kill the
[42:51] influence of a man in the end time
[42:53] you've killed the person you don't have
[42:55] to kill him with a gun
[42:56] you killed their influence you've killed
[42:58] the person right so let's look at that
[43:00] here in just a minute to whom God would
[43:01] make known what is the riches of the
[43:03] glory of this mystery among the Gentiles
[43:05] which is Christ in you the hope of glory
[43:08] whom we preach warning every man and
[43:11] teaching every man in all wisdom that we
[43:13] may present every man perfect in Christ
[43:16] Jesus wherefore I also labor striving
[43:19] according to his work which worketh in
[43:20] me mightily so we're talking about
[43:23] godliness and we'll kind of skip through
[43:24] some of the stuff from this morning and
[43:26] get to brother kindness but we looked at
[43:28] reverence and respect piety towards God
[43:31] and then we look we talked about the
[43:32] horse forehead the horse forehead
[43:34] there's no reverence or respect it's
[43:36] just a you know wanting it's whatever
[43:38] you do that's okay if that's who you are
[43:41] that's okay no it's not okay
[43:47] listen
[43:49] we have to live Godly there's somebody
[43:52] going to live this Bible
[43:57] somebody there's a group of people
[43:59] that's and it's not going to be in a
[44:01] group
[44:02] it's going to be individuals but we can
[44:04] be in a group somebody's going to live
[44:07] what God wrote in the Bible you know why
[44:09] because that's why I wrote it
[44:11] remember God can see the end from the
[44:13] beginning so because he can see that
[44:15] somebody came to this
[44:18] he wrote the Bible and make it flow
[44:20] right straight down to where you are
[44:21] today
[44:22] amen
[44:23] y'all don't go to sleep on me already I
[44:26] have to come back and wake you up German
[44:28] chocolate cake
[44:30] think of your favorite sports team
[44:32] maybe that'll keep you awake
[44:34] is that your perfect man brother Brian
[44:36] was talking talk about uh godliness I
[44:39] can't do it brother he said oh yes you
[44:41] can I think that's an outstanding
[44:42] statement he never I mean he explained
[44:45] it all but they said no he said yes you
[44:47] can
[44:48] so you know what that gives me that
[44:50] gives me
[44:52] see there's that door that opportunity
[44:55] that when God sent us a prophet he sent
[44:58] us a prophet to open the door or to open
[45:01] the seal or to open the Bible so that we
[45:05] can maneuver our way through this Bible
[45:08] without stopping and going I can't do
[45:10] that man
[45:12] I can't do that
[45:14] uh my denomination won't let me do that
[45:18] think of what brother Brown says he's
[45:20] talking about Unity talking about he
[45:22] said your denomination won't let you do
[45:23] that
[45:25] ah see that same thing with us our
[45:28] attitude maybe won't let us do that
[45:30] we're working on our attitude come on
[45:32] like sister Nikki he's still working on
[45:34] me
[45:36] what to make me what I ought to be
[45:40] and Lord just keep on just start start
[45:43] hacking
[45:44] come to church read your Bible pray
[45:46] listen to The Prophet's message
[45:49] I can't tell you to do much more it's
[45:51] just do more of that
[45:54] all right and I'm guilty too
[45:57] I need to do more
[45:59] let's just keep striving though come
[46:01] Church read your Bible
[46:03] do the things that God tells us to do
[46:05] not what we want to do in our own mind
[46:07] do what God tells us to do and we should
[46:10] be fine everybody with me
[46:12] it's not something listen if it was so
[46:14] hard that only an elite group of people
[46:16] can do it God would be a respecter of
[46:19] persons he's not a respecter of persons
[46:21] even the most illiterate person
[46:24] can't get born again
[46:26] doesn't take money doesn't take
[46:27] education
[46:30] it takes a willing heart
[46:33] now if we're willing to stay in the
[46:35] world guess what God's going to allow
[46:37] you to do that
[46:38] but if you're willing to put forth the
[46:40] effort effort and say God y'all pray for
[46:43] me my new teeth
[46:46] they won't come out they're glued in
[46:49] but
[46:54] I can hear myself whistling don't say
[46:56] right Luis you didn't do that you didn't
[46:58] hear me
[47:01] but I have to be careful where I spit
[47:05] while I'm talking
[47:06] so just pray for me it's it's something
[47:09] interesting and you can't feel them
[47:11] because they're not attached to you so
[47:14] just pray that we get through this
[47:15] brother boy you'll worry about sooner or
[47:17] later when you get old
[47:19] can't stand him look at the hair on his
[47:21] head at 70 years old
[47:23] Godly jealousy it's just Godly jealousy
[47:25] it's all of this okay
[47:28] this
[47:30] deity comes from the Latin now when you
[47:33] think I think about this the other day
[47:34] and I didn't bring out this morning when
[47:36] you when somebody says okay we're going
[47:38] to talk today about deity
[47:40] what do you think well that's God up
[47:43] there
[47:45] amen shake your head that's God up there
[47:48] deity we have no
[47:51] um we don't sit and think about us being
[47:53] deity
[47:55] we just think about us be stinking
[47:56] humans and we're lost and but we got to
[47:59] come to a place though somewhere where
[48:00] God through a prophet told us
[48:03] if he is now inside of you
[48:06] it's not somewhere even Moses picks it
[48:08] up he said we don't have to go to heaven
[48:10] to get it
[48:11] he said it's right here man it's not
[48:14] thee even in my mouth the word of faith
[48:16] that we preach which paraphrasing a
[48:18] couple of scriptures together
[48:20] but the divine nature of deities is
[48:22] believed to be what
[48:29] actual being the divine nature what is
[48:32] the divine nature of God these virtues
[48:35] that's the divine nature of God all
[48:37] right so the divine nature of deities is
[48:41] believed to be immortal goodness and
[48:43] powerfulness you say well by the way
[48:44] we're not Immortal no we're not but
[48:46] we're heading toward that but I promise
[48:48] you one thing something inside of you
[48:49] that is
[48:50] there's something inside of you that is
[48:53] eternal it is Immortal it can't die
[48:56] there's no way it can die you can't cut
[48:59] this flesh up enough to make it die
[49:01] you just separated and then we're gonna
[49:03] come right back together
[49:05] praise God
[49:07] he's talking about the corn of wheat now
[49:09] watch what brother Graham said the same
[49:11] God within the pillar fire was in Christ
[49:13] Jesus the same one in Christ Jesus is in
[49:15] you that's right God in you the hope of
[49:18] glory
[49:20] is that right the baptism of the Holy
[49:22] Spirit dwelling in the person now you
[49:25] become what sons of God that's why
[49:27] brother Brown says and I agree 100 the
[49:30] the true New Birth
[49:33] is one of the most
[49:36] uh it's just something that nobody
[49:38] really talks about they just say well
[49:39] you're in the message aren't you or you
[49:41] were born an eagle or or don't you get
[49:43] this feeling when you hear the prophet
[49:44] message and don't you hear this and
[49:47] no getting born again has nothing to do
[49:49] with the prophet
[49:51] don't get quiet
[49:54] there's been New Birth since the since
[49:56] the the day of Pentecost
[49:59] brother Brandon was just over here in
[50:00] just a small section of this church age
[50:04] that we're talking about he's just a
[50:06] small section of it
[50:07] hey man
[50:09] so we need to get Born Again by the word
[50:11] of God we get we need to get Born Again
[50:13] by the Lord Jesus coming into our heart
[50:16] and saving our soul
[50:19] then that makes God in you the hope of
[50:22] glory it's just an ill-talk subject
[50:24] Because unless you get the baptism of
[50:26] holy ghost in your soul you're not born
[50:28] again
[50:30] and I want you to pray uh for a young
[50:33] young man Jim Ellis he's uh he wants to
[50:37] hunt on our in our hunting club in
[50:38] Illinois so
[50:39] um some of y'all knew that I left Monday
[50:42] morning or Sunday night he and I and we
[50:44] drove course this eight hour drive up
[50:46] there and ate our ate our back but we
[50:48] were together for two three days
[50:50] up there working in gym I don't know
[50:53] where these the Methodist or Baptist he
[50:54] likes to drink a little bit
[50:56] says a few little few bad words but he's
[50:58] a good guy he's a beekeeper friend of
[50:59] ours but anyway coming back I didn't
[51:02] bring I didn't bring it up
[51:04] he said well kind of tell me a little
[51:08] bit about your religion
[51:11] I thought oops
[51:13] yeah I know
[51:15] here we go
[51:17] so I just kind of you know I just kind
[51:19] of I said well we're kind of between uh
[51:21] we don't believe speaking in tongues is
[51:23] the evidence but we we don't deny that
[51:25] speaking in tongues is part of the Bible
[51:27] and he agreed I said but we don't and I
[51:31] went through this just a Simple Plan of
[51:33] Salvation
[51:33] told him the story about remember I told
[51:35] you about the banker friend of mine you
[51:37] know John stump we were out there
[51:38] fishing on the lake and and I just got
[51:41] born again and and was living different
[51:42] and and um and they all saw it and
[51:46] that's why John was uh John was asking
[51:48] me is you know what's going on here I
[51:51] said well I I got saved I said I got
[51:53] born again
[51:54] I said I don't do those things no more
[51:56] because he's sitting there drinking a
[51:57] beer cursing you know all day and he
[52:00] just holds the beer up and he says well
[52:02] praise the Lord he said Wade got saved
[52:04] and he said and he said I I'm just glad
[52:08] that I got saved everyone and I'm I
[52:10] looked at him I said John what'd you get
[52:12] saved from
[52:14] what'd you get saved from you gotta save
[52:16] save from what you're doing the same
[52:19] thing you did before
[52:22] so I told that story to Jim but you know
[52:24] what Jim said
[52:26] I about had I about had a fit
[52:30] he looked at me and he said
[52:33] so that's what it means to be born again
[52:34] huh
[52:39] he said so that's what it means to be
[52:42] born again all the whole time may have
[52:43] been a Christian for 20 30 years
[52:46] he had never seen there was a difference
[52:51] he said well I guess I'm gonna have to
[52:52] work on my mouth I said no let the Lord
[52:54] work on your mouth
[52:56] I said let the Lord work on don't worry
[52:58] about it I said listen whatever you say
[52:59] is your business I said but I'm just
[53:01] telling you that to be born again you've
[53:04] got to have a different Spirit than you
[53:06] have now
[53:07] you've got to have a different even
[53:09] perspective our perspective of life is
[53:12] totally different I don't have a
[53:14] perspective that one day me and Jim's
[53:16] gonna get mad at each other and get a
[53:17] divorce
[53:19] that's not that wasn't even in even when
[53:21] I was a sinner that wasn't in part of my
[53:23] vocabulary I asked the whole problem an
[53:26] issue life lesson 785
[53:28] you ready
[53:32] work on your problems
[53:36] well you burnt the rice I'm divorcing
[53:39] you tomorrow
[53:46] you drive through the drive-through and
[53:48] get a divorce papers I mean it's not
[53:50] that way but it's just about that way
[53:51] that people don't even want to work on
[53:53] anything anymore why they ain't got
[53:54] nothing inside of them they're looking
[53:56] for something better
[53:58] they're looking for something else you
[54:00] and I have the best
[54:02] we have the best in our life we have the
[54:05] best in our life
[54:07] we have the best in our kids you say oh
[54:09] yes
[54:12] we're still believing
[54:14] amen we're still believing
[54:18] I'm not throwing mine out of yours
[54:20] either one
[54:22] but they got to have a change
[54:25] but that just really threw up my soul
[54:27] brought tears to my eyes and he said so
[54:30] that's what it means to be born again
[54:32] I said yeah Jim
[54:34] I said that's what it really means to
[54:36] have to be a Christian
[54:38] to have God in your life and for the
[54:41] world sure I said you saw me this whole
[54:43] time uh Brett the guy that lives up
[54:45] there he's a drinker and a concussion
[54:47] you know I said that don't bother me
[54:50] I said I know he's not changed now he
[54:53] professes Christianity goes to church
[54:56] every once in a while
[54:58] but he's not got a portion of God in him
[55:01] he's still got a portion of you know who
[55:03] in him
[55:04] right
[55:08] but if you ever tried to just just sit
[55:10] down with people and say hey
[55:12] this is what brother Brown say tell them
[55:14] how your fire got lit well I told him
[55:16] how my fire got lit and that when it did
[55:20] light me it burned me up
[55:22] made me a new creation and we start
[55:24] talking about that and you you know
[55:26] making it new make it a a new attitude I
[55:28] said Jim I said we can you know we can
[55:30] hunt and fish and and and talk about
[55:33] things and talk about beekeeping and all
[55:35] that stuff I said I'm fine I said but
[55:36] when you asked me about the word of God
[55:38] I'm going to tell you my perspective
[55:42] my experience I'm going to tell you mine
[55:45] this is how I got saved and look I said
[55:48] and this is he said you don't say no he
[55:50] said you don't slip up saying about when
[55:52] I said no
[55:54] no not in part of my vocabulary now
[55:56] listen I'd be lying to say I didn't
[55:58] think I'm in my head
[56:00] if y'all don't think of me in your head
[56:01] please pray for me
[56:04] but that's just part of life
[56:09] it's part of life
[56:10] the birds fly over but we used to let
[56:13] them build houses in our brains right
[56:16] now we just let them fly right on
[56:19] through
[56:20] and that's the difference when I told
[56:21] Jim I said now Jim you know me we've
[56:24] known each other for probably 10 years
[56:25] beekeeping and stuff I said you know me
[56:28] I said I'm not one that that that lives
[56:31] two different ways or he said no you're
[56:33] the one you're you know you're that way
[56:35] all the time you know there's not a time
[56:37] when we're all up here sitting around
[56:38] drinking and there's not a time when we
[56:40] go over here beekeeping and we have a
[56:41] beer or we he but he did look he said
[56:44] you really you ain't never said a bad
[56:45] word and and I said no
[56:49] remember my testimony I tried to say one
[56:51] one time
[56:52] and the Lord hit me in the chest with
[56:54] his fist
[56:55] and all that came out was there
[56:57] but see God's going to protect his
[56:59] people I'll tell you what he's going to
[57:01] do he's going to protect himself
[57:03] [Music]
[57:04] he's protecting himself inside of you
[57:07] that's what he's doing it's not that he
[57:09] don't care about you but he's protecting
[57:11] himself he's protecting the gift God
[57:13] give you that's what he was doing with
[57:14] brother Brown I'm not so much of brother
[57:16] random was so special we know he was but
[57:18] he wasn't so special that that the the
[57:20] angel said don't smoke or drink or cut I
[57:23] wish that angel would have come to me
[57:25] but you know what
[57:26] he he probably came to all of us you
[57:29] know what we did we left him up in the
[57:31] tree where he talked to us
[57:33] brother Brown took it serious
[57:36] I don't know smoke or drink but now
[57:38] remember brother Randolph didn't now
[57:40] he's six or seven years old when he had
[57:41] that it went that he didn't uh ever get
[57:45] tempted
[57:47] come on he told us
[57:51] he told his uncle or whoever it was give
[57:53] me that bottle
[57:56] right he had an intent on doing what he
[57:59] said he wasn't going to do or shouldn't
[58:00] do right it wasn't and he just sat there
[58:03] and he's like oh no I'm just you know
[58:05] no he had to fight that thing he had to
[58:09] fight what was going on inside of him
[58:10] because he was a human being he said I
[58:12] spread them he said we die with our
[58:13] boots on well we're just alcoholics and
[58:17] we have a hard temper now remember he
[58:19] had a temper he had to work on too I'm
[58:21] going to show you how to selfish Spirit
[58:22] here in just a few minutes I'm just
[58:24] telling you what he said this is not
[58:26] hearsay well it is he said it

[58:32] Brown said look deity fell on the day of
[58:35] Pentecost

[58:39] deity fell on the day of Pentecost it's
[58:42] still falling if it falls on folks we
[58:46] obviously we can't live it but he can
[58:49] leave it to us
[58:51] that's why we struggle and fight I wish
[58:53] you'd just stop the struggling and
[58:55] fighting and get born again

[59:00] change

[59:09] far as looking at godliness but look on

[1:00:10] there's not different levels of
[1:00:12] godliness like there's different levels
[1:00:14] of love and we may get to it may not but
[1:00:17] there are different levels of love
[1:00:18] there's filial love there's agape love
[1:00:20] there's lust and brother Brown said then
[1:00:21] there's filth all right so let's read
[1:00:25] this just real quick this is what the
[1:00:26] Holy Ghost is writing to me and you
[1:00:29] everybody with me all right what Shake
[1:00:32] Yourself for a minute
[1:00:36] what y'all need to do is get up
[1:00:37] everybody bring a bowling ball
[1:00:40] and set up with that bowling ball and
[1:00:43] just kind of you know spread your legs
[1:00:44] out about two feet
[1:00:47] and I mean one foot about two feet that
[1:00:49] way the other one right over that

[1:01:07] everything brother ham said was serious
[1:01:10] but this was written by the Holy Ghost
[1:01:12] to me and you
[1:01:13] everybody with me on this and this is
[1:01:16] what God is writing he said pick up your
[1:01:19] pen and write this down
[1:01:22] now here's what I'm trying to say to you
[1:01:23] the law of reproduction bring forth of
[1:01:25] its kind Genesis 1 11. these last days
[1:01:28] true church Bride Comes To The Headstone
[1:01:31] now we got to come to all the virtues to
[1:01:34] get to that right we've got to have the
[1:01:36] virtues working in our life to get to
[1:01:38] the headstone
[1:01:40] will be the Super Church a super race
[1:01:43] as as in other words as we near the
[1:01:46] great headstone and that's what we're
[1:01:47] doing now we're we're at godliness we're
[1:01:50] not far from that love where the
[1:01:51] Capstone is there
[1:01:53] and that Love's going to be a lot
[1:01:54] different than we think
[1:01:56] they will be much like so much like him
[1:02:00] they will be so much like him even they
[1:02:04] will be in his very image
[1:02:07] what is the image of God that's the
[1:02:09] image of God
[1:02:12] in order
[1:02:13] to be United with him because remember
[1:02:17] rubber can't Unite with blocks bricks
[1:02:20] wood it's got to be the same material
[1:02:22] we're working on making this the same
[1:02:24] material
[1:02:26] all right they will be one they will be
[1:02:28] the very manifestation of the word of
[1:02:30] the Living God that was back in we were
[1:02:32] talking about in uh in the Book of John
[1:02:34] John 17 when Jesus was telling us three
[1:02:37] or four times we got to be like one like
[1:02:39] him and the father now how was him and
[1:02:41] the father one
[1:02:42] I kind of skipped that this morning you
[1:02:45] thought about that
[1:02:46] how was Jesus and God won
[1:02:49] they weren't two different people
[1:02:52] right
[1:02:54] so are we a separate person
[1:02:58] that's where our problem is we we we're
[1:03:00] just a bunch of Tunis
[1:03:02] we harp on the trinitarians and we harp
[1:03:05] on the Oneness let's harp on the twoness
[1:03:07] and let's get true Oneness like brother
[1:03:09] random like Jesus wanted it to be true
[1:03:11] Oneness Is Us in the multitude of bride
[1:03:14] together all right everybody with me
[1:03:17] then from a little group
[1:03:20] of the true seed of the word God will
[1:03:23] present Christ a beloved bride of Virgin
[1:03:26] look a version of his word
[1:03:28] not our own ideas not our not our
[1:03:32] thoughts but a version of his word and
[1:03:34] through them and by them who the bride
[1:03:39] will be fulfilled all that has been
[1:03:41] promised this listen this is the Holy
[1:03:43] Ghost writing to me and you
[1:03:45] this is not brother Ram's thoughts this
[1:03:47] is the Holy Ghost writing to me and you
[1:03:49] fulfill all that has been promised for
[1:03:51] his word in the Virgin who knows no
[1:03:53] man-made Creed or Dogma The Word of
[1:03:57] Promise in himself like it was in Mary
[1:04:00] God himself made manifest he will act
[1:04:04] himself by his own Word of Promise so to
[1:04:09] fulfill all that has been written of him
[1:04:11] as he did when he came from the Virgin
[1:04:13] womb type of the spirit womb now that's
[1:04:16] us type of the spirit womb now so will
[1:04:19] the Virgin now accepting his word what
[1:04:21] become virgins and then we accept the
[1:04:23] seed word of God all right be it unto me
[1:04:25] as thou has said though it was said by
[1:04:27] an Angel while it yet was written the
[1:04:29] written word Isaiah 9 6. look they will
[1:04:33] love him
[1:04:34] love his and will have his potentials
[1:04:36] for he is their head what is his
[1:04:38] potentials
[1:04:39] the virtues
[1:04:41] and they are his subjects subject to his
[1:04:45] headship of Christ was his that's why I
[1:04:49] say and that's why all the ministry that
[1:04:51] true Ministry of the word of God will
[1:04:53] tell you you've got to have a heads up
[1:04:55] you gotta have a Shepherd you gotta have
[1:04:58] a pastor you can't push play and make it
[1:05:00] right
[1:05:01] we're not built for that
[1:05:03] if we were built for that amen
[1:05:06] hallelujah praise the Lord it'd be so
[1:05:07] easy but we're not built for that
[1:05:10] we're built to be talked to every Sunday
[1:05:12] and every Wednesday by a human being
[1:05:14] that pours out their heart amen
[1:05:16] Amen to get you to see God not them
[1:05:20] notice what Harmony Jesus never did
[1:05:23] anything until sin of the father or the
[1:05:25] father showed him first Harmony between
[1:05:27] God and Christ see John 5 19. so will
[1:05:31] the bride
[1:05:33] and he shows her his word of life he
[1:05:36] shows her and she receives it
[1:05:39] she never doubts it
[1:05:42] nothing can harm her not even death
[1:05:46] for if the seed be planted the water
[1:05:50] will raise it up again amen
[1:05:53] then I got a great big Hallelujah
[1:05:55] here's the secret all right here's the
[1:05:58] secret
[1:05:59] the word is in the bride
[1:06:02] and the mind of Christ to know what he
[1:06:05] wants done with the word now listen
[1:06:07] that's only at adoption
[1:06:10] right
[1:06:12] how's he going to give you something
[1:06:13] knowing you're gonna mess up
[1:06:15] he's God he knows you will
[1:06:17] he can't give the baby the car keys
[1:06:22] he's not going to even though little
[1:06:24] kids like we used to love your kids play
[1:06:26] around with little little Keys you know
[1:06:28] for the little play cars well you ain't
[1:06:30] gonna get in a real car do that same way
[1:06:32] with God he's come down through all
[1:06:34] these Church ages and there's pieces
[1:06:36] being left out
[1:06:38] man's ideas got involved uh doctrines
[1:06:41] got involved denominations got involved
[1:06:44] and the Word was eat down as talk about
[1:06:48] the restoration of the Bright Tree the
[1:06:50] word was eat down the effects of the
[1:06:51] word have been eat down
[1:06:53] but now it's to come back
[1:06:56] to be restored in a group of people that
[1:06:59] does what he says to do and the mind of
[1:07:02] Christ to know what he wants done with
[1:07:04] the word and she does it in his name
[1:07:07] she has thus said the Lord then it is
[1:07:11] germatized so the Holy Spirit Waters in
[1:07:13] until it's grown look
[1:07:15] and serves its purpose
[1:07:18] you have a purpose in this
[1:07:20] if you're a born-again child of God you
[1:07:23] have a purpose in this whole thing all
[1:07:25] right you can either be the fingernail
[1:07:27] or you can be you know the arm whatever
[1:07:29] it is just Lord just let me be in your
[1:07:32] body
[1:07:33] that's what George said just Lord just
[1:07:34] let me be in the body somewhere they do
[1:07:36] all
[1:07:38] hey man I'll believe that brother
[1:07:39] interjects that no one can persuade this
[1:07:43] different they have thus at the Lord or
[1:07:44] they still
[1:07:46] folks that's what we're preaching if I
[1:07:47] preach the word of God to you it's thus
[1:07:49] says the Lord
[1:07:51] it's touched out the Lord
[1:07:54] or they keep still then they will do the
[1:07:56] works of God for he is himself in them
[1:08:00] continuing his word to fulfill that's
[1:08:03] where people are missing it they don't
[1:08:05] really think that God himself has went
[1:08:08] inside of you and he's working outward
[1:08:12] because you ain't perfect now ain't
[1:08:14] perfect
[1:08:15] my denomination says we can't do that
[1:08:19] well you know what your denomination is
[1:08:20] it's a horse forehead
[1:08:24] for it is himself and them continuing
[1:08:26] his word to what fulfill as he did
[1:08:29] complete in his day all things when he
[1:08:32] was here he did not complete all when he
[1:08:34] was here why he's completing it now
[1:08:38] for it was not time yet I say today it's
[1:08:43] time now
[1:08:45] and I've just got a little snippet of
[1:08:47] one of the scriptures I read so to the
[1:08:49] doctrine which is according to Godliness
[1:08:51] so there is a Doctrine
[1:08:53] according to Godliness that tells you
[1:08:56] the doctrine that we have
[1:08:59] will make you Godly
[1:09:01] the doctrine we have will make you holy
[1:09:04] the doctrine we have will make you
[1:09:06] without spot a wrinkle
[1:09:09] because I know one thing for sure if
[1:09:11] I've been Justified what I did in the
[1:09:14] past God cannot see it
[1:09:19] if I'm Sanctified today all that old me
[1:09:23] has been moved out
[1:09:27] and if I'm born again by the baptism of
[1:09:29] the Holy Ghost I can't lose
[1:09:31] you can't lose
[1:09:33] we have trials and tribulations so what
[1:09:36] all that live Godly in Christ shall
[1:09:38] suffer persecution
[1:09:41] you know why because this world listen
[1:09:43] this world's mind is not even yours I
[1:09:45] mean I hope you don't think I hope you
[1:09:47] don't think like the world
[1:09:50] we used to did
[1:09:52] we used to think like the world all of
[1:09:54] you did we all did before we got morning
[1:09:56] and we thought just like the world
[1:09:58] Romans 1 verse 16 says for I am not
[1:10:00] ashamed of the gospel of Christ that's
[1:10:03] what I was telling Jim I'm not ashamed
[1:10:05] that I'm different
[1:10:06] some people are ashamed I'm not ashamed
[1:10:09] that I'm different
[1:10:10] you should not be ashamed right well I'm
[1:10:13] just different I ain't gonna say nothing
[1:10:15] well
[1:10:18] brother Brian said tell him hey fire got
[1:10:20] lit how you gonna tell him that if you
[1:10:21] don't talk to him
[1:10:25] but I really appreciate you know Jim was
[1:10:28] very tentative and and like you said
[1:10:29] before I mean afterwards he said I'm
[1:10:31] gonna have to brush up in other words
[1:10:32] maybe that'll spark something in his
[1:10:34] heart to say hey I really don't have
[1:10:36] what I thought I had
[1:10:38] and you know what that's good enough for
[1:10:40] me I want you to realize today
[1:10:42] that you may not have what you think
[1:10:44] you've got
[1:10:48] thank you brother none you're the only
[1:10:49] one to wait for I am not ashamed of the
[1:10:51] gospel of Christ for he is the power of
[1:10:53] God what it is the power of God unto
[1:10:56] salvation to everyone that believeth now
[1:10:59] let's talk about image just a second
[1:11:01] because Genesis 1 26 favorite scripture
[1:11:03] God said let us make man in our image
[1:11:05] whose image God
[1:11:07] if you make somebody image that look
[1:11:09] like God all right after our likeness
[1:11:12] and let them have dominion over the fish
[1:11:14] of the sea and follow the air cattle
[1:11:15] Earth creeping thing that's what Adam
[1:11:18] had so God created a man in his own
[1:11:20] image an image of God created in him but
[1:11:22] remember that image got marred
[1:11:26] now we're made in the image of Mom and
[1:11:28] Dad
[1:11:31] Cain was in the image of Mom and Dad
[1:11:34] Abel was in the image of Mom and Dad you
[1:11:37] and I are in the image of Mom and Dad on
[1:11:39] the Earth but what we gotta look and see
[1:11:41] that when God created this man it's not
[1:11:44] in the image of your mom and daddy
[1:11:46] oh
[1:11:48] he was we were created in His image
[1:11:51] so God created man in his own image
[1:11:54] he has his own personality
[1:11:58] the image of God created in him male and
[1:12:00] female created them and God blessed them
[1:12:02] and God said be fruitful and multiply
[1:12:04] boy what about that they're multiplying
[1:12:06] and not even in flesh we think about
[1:12:07] multiplication we gotta be in flesh
[1:12:09] spiritual multiplication is way better
[1:12:11] than natural multiplication see we have
[1:12:14] to have natural multiplication now
[1:12:16] because of the Fall
[1:12:18] but then you have an opportunity to have
[1:12:20] spiritual multiplication which is
[1:12:22] somebody preaching the word of God and
[1:12:24] somebody yet born again that's spiritual
[1:12:25] multiplication all right be fruitful and
[1:12:28] multiply and replenish the Earth and
[1:12:30] subdue it see we're not going to subdue
[1:12:32] this Earth until we're in the Millennium
[1:12:33] brother Brian there's a quote he tells
[1:12:35] us that and have dominion over the fish
[1:12:37] is saying to follow the air and
[1:12:38] everything that moveth upon the Earth
[1:12:41] let's look at this word for a second
[1:12:42] Godly
[1:12:44] Godly means Theos
[1:12:47] it's a deity
[1:12:49] what's this whatever can in any respect
[1:12:52] be likened unto God or resemble him
[1:12:56] in any way
[1:12:59] see brother Donnie was brought here by
[1:13:03] uh brother and sister Paul Bush
[1:13:05] right what we're looking at now but
[1:13:07] brother Brown says hey you don't see the
[1:13:09] real man
[1:13:11] you don't see the real man but you know
[1:13:13] what God thought so much of that image
[1:13:16] 20 years old you're gonna look like 20
[1:13:18] year old Donnie fabush you're not going
[1:13:19] to look like 20 year old Bob black
[1:13:22] he taught so much of that DNA that
[1:13:24] brought your mom and daddy together
[1:13:26] to get you here bring your bring your
[1:13:29] quirks bring your attitudes or your
[1:13:32] disaditudes or whatever be attitudes
[1:13:36] all of our attitudes
[1:13:38] and he put that together and said okay
[1:13:40] hang on just a minute when I go inside
[1:13:42] that guy he's going to be different
[1:13:44] when I go inside that sister she's going
[1:13:46] to be different
[1:13:48] Mom and Daddy get them here
[1:13:51] because that was a law that came up
[1:13:53] back in Genesis
[1:13:55] that had to be a man and a woman they
[1:13:57] brought children
[1:13:58] in sorrow she would be bearing child man
[1:14:01] would work by the sweat of his bride
[1:14:04] but thank God the title never happened
[1:14:07] in the millennium all that'll be done
[1:14:09] away with it'll be back to the original
[1:14:10] where we won't have that sorrow and
[1:14:13] paint and praise God I won't have to
[1:14:15] water my garden with a water hose
[1:14:19] praise the Lord
[1:14:27] whatever can in any respect be likened
[1:14:29] unto God or resemble him in any way is
[1:14:33] Godly
[1:14:34] so he's going to take an image that that
[1:14:36] looks ungodly
[1:14:38] hours
[1:14:40] and he's going to make it Godly to we're
[1:14:43] going to resemble him by what not by DNA
[1:14:45] but by birth
[1:14:46] New Birth
[1:14:48] and maybe some of us needs it just keep
[1:14:50] coming back in my mind maybe some of us
[1:14:52] need to look at what Jim what Jim Ellis
[1:14:54] said
[1:14:56] and just say wow is that really what it
[1:14:59] means to be born again
[1:15:01] if you've not experienced that then
[1:15:02] you're not born again
[1:15:05] I'm so sorry
[1:15:07] if you've not experienced a change in
[1:15:09] your life
[1:15:12] if you cannot tell somebody
[1:15:15] the change in your life
[1:15:17] then you need to get born again
[1:15:19] not that I came not that I just showed
[1:15:22] up and appeared and started coming to
[1:15:23] church not that the message sounds good
[1:15:26] listen I agreed with serpent seat and
[1:15:29] all them other doctrines when I was 14
[1:15:30] and I was lost as a as a
[1:15:32] blind cat in a me house or a blind dog
[1:15:35] in a me house
[1:15:36] I was blind but I could see that and
[1:15:39] then brother round tells us he comes up
[1:15:41] and he says that's just common sense
[1:15:43] hey man
[1:15:45] he said that's your common sense to see
[1:15:47] that well that was pretty much common
[1:15:49] sense for me to see what happened in the
[1:15:50] garden because I knew what my problem
[1:15:52] was at 14 years old well praise the Lord
[1:15:55] anyhow y'all didn't go through it bless
[1:15:57] you
[1:15:58] uh
[1:16:00] I have books about that God's
[1:16:03] representative or vice region of
[1:16:04] magistrates and judges in other words
[1:16:06] somebody that resembles the Creator
[1:16:09] you and I have here are here today to
[1:16:12] resemble the Creator the only way you
[1:16:15] can resemble is to be made in His image
[1:16:18] second Timothy 3 11 persecutions
[1:16:21] afflictions
[1:16:22] which came unto me in Antioch and
[1:16:24] Iconium and lifestra what persecutions I
[1:16:27] endured but out of them all the Lord
[1:16:29] delivered me praise the Lord can anybody
[1:16:31] have that anybody has that testimony
[1:16:33] anybody has that testimony well we'll
[1:16:36] pray for you all the other ones because
[1:16:37] you're fixing to get one but out of them
[1:16:40] the Lord delivered me yea and all that
[1:16:43] will live Godly in Christ now Paul is
[1:16:45] telling us listen
[1:16:47] I'm trying to live Godly the best I can
[1:16:49] and I'm gonna I've been suffering all
[1:16:52] this persecution
[1:16:55] listen folks they'll persecute you and
[1:16:57] not even know it
[1:16:59] because you're so different
[1:17:02] as I said before what brother dick says
[1:17:04] is your your spirit irritates their
[1:17:06] demons
[1:17:08] and that's kind of the way it is
[1:17:10] but able man and Seducer shall wax worse
[1:17:12] and worse look deceiving and being
[1:17:14] deceived so it's not going to get better
[1:17:15] for them it's just going to get worse
[1:17:17] all right
[1:17:19] so that's godliness so let's move to
[1:17:21] brotherly kindness just for a few
[1:17:22] minutes and then we'll take communion
[1:17:25] second Peter 1 verse 5 says besides this
[1:17:27] giving all diligence add to your faith
[1:17:29] verse you diverse your knowledge and all
[1:17:30] those temperaments temper patience
[1:17:32] patience godliness and brother godliness
[1:17:34] brotherly kindness into brotherly
[1:17:36] kindness charity we're right up here
[1:17:39] to where we need to be but I want us to
[1:17:41] watch
[1:17:42] some of the things we'll go we'll go
[1:17:44] through some other stuff with brotherly
[1:17:45] kindness because it's kind of a broad
[1:17:47] broad spectrum
[1:17:48] it means Philadelphia we know that love
[1:17:51] of the Brethren love of brothers and
[1:17:53] sisters Brotherly Love in the New
[1:17:55] Testament
[1:17:56] the love which Christians cherish for
[1:17:58] each other as brethren
[1:18:01] all right also Philadelphia's which love
[1:18:05] as a Brethren loving brothers and
[1:18:07] sisters in a broader sense it's loving
[1:18:10] one like a brother loving one's fellow
[1:18:12] Countryman of an Israelite or of a
[1:18:14] Christian loving Christians you said
[1:18:17] that's real easy no it's not
[1:18:20] Matthew 24 12 give us a a pretty dire
[1:18:24] situation and because iniquity shall
[1:18:27] abound he's talking about the end time
[1:18:28] remember Matthew 24. Matthew 24 is the
[1:18:31] seals all right Matthew 24 says that
[1:18:34] because iniquity shall abound the love
[1:18:37] of many shall wax cold
[1:18:40] First Peter 1 verse 22 says seeing you
[1:18:43] have purified your souls in obeying the
[1:18:44] truth through the spirit unto unfeigned
[1:18:47] love of the Brethren you know what that
[1:18:49] word unfeigned means undisguised
[1:18:54] or sincere
[1:18:57] there's no way it's you think I don't
[1:19:00] love my wife
[1:19:02] because it's undisguisable
[1:19:05] I love her with all I got
[1:19:09] do you
[1:19:10] some of y'all don't even hold hands you
[1:19:13] ought to try it sometime
[1:19:16] preach brother I will unto and your
[1:19:19] sister should be going yeah
[1:19:22] unto unfeign the love of the Brethren
[1:19:24] which means undisguisable
[1:19:27] uh he's talking about a Prophet by the
[1:19:30] way this morning yeah that's that's
[1:19:32] that's his quality right there
[1:19:35] his love for even the people that hate
[1:19:37] him was so undisguised
[1:19:40] he loved them all
[1:19:41] he just throwed the love out there and I
[1:19:45] believe he did it sincerely but but
[1:19:47] watch what the Paul says he says under
[1:19:50] unfeigned love of the Brethren see that
[1:19:51] you love wonder I mean Peter will love
[1:19:54] one another with a pure heart fervently
[1:19:58] undisguised uh don't just shake your
[1:20:00] hand and say God bless you
[1:20:03] really mean it I want God to bless you

[1:20:10] our WhatsApp you know we we send little
[1:20:12] hands up you know and we send the little
[1:20:15] hearts out we send a little smiley faces
[1:20:16] out

[1:20:28] just to move it out of the way and going
[1:20:30] about your life
[1:20:34] please pray for me
[1:20:38] well I send them too
[1:20:41] but I stop and pray right there because

[1:21:06] incorruptable by the word of God which
[1:21:08] liveth and abideth
[1:21:11] forever
[1:21:13] 1958 watch this
[1:21:16] because we're going to talk about
[1:21:17] Brotherly Love or brotherly kindness so
[1:21:20] they're they're kind of interchangeable
[1:21:21] so watch this just a minute and then
[1:21:22] we'll take communion here in just a
[1:21:23] minute
[1:21:24] 1958 anything that had a beginning has
[1:21:28] to have an end all right we know that
[1:21:30] all right
[1:21:31] so the love you have for your wife is
[1:21:34] going to end
[1:21:37] it sure will
[1:21:40] I'll prove it to you
[1:21:43] anything that had a beginning has an end
[1:21:45] why were you so quiet about that that
[1:21:47] didn't mean you unlove your wife it just
[1:21:49] means you're gonna love her way up here
[1:21:51] instead of down here
[1:21:53] uh agape love is not conditional filial
[1:21:56] love I'm sorry you can tell me all you
[1:21:58] want to I love and I do I love my wife
[1:22:01] unconditionally but taste times I don't
[1:22:02] love her as much as I do
[1:22:04] the day before
[1:22:06] but now I'm not coming by The Godfather
[1:22:08] I'm talking about I'm talking about uh
[1:22:11] selfish love we'll get into that in just
[1:22:12] a second anything that had a beginning
[1:22:14] has an end thank God he's not that way
[1:22:17] hey man come on thank God he's not that
[1:22:19] way
[1:22:26] I'm glad that we can realize that kind
[1:22:28] of love is unwavering
[1:22:31] love
[1:22:34] I believe he loved Judas his care
[1:22:39] out of his Humanity he he said friend
[1:22:43] come on man
[1:22:44] why are you doing this I know you got to
[1:22:46] do it but
[1:22:48] I enjoyed being around you
[1:22:50] and not the way when people leave here
[1:22:53] or even people that you're acquainted
[1:22:54] with and all of a sudden like like take
[1:22:57] brother Tim hymns for example I like to
[1:22:59] fellowship with him
[1:23:00] I don't fellowship with him now
[1:23:03] because we're not of The Same Spirit I
[1:23:05] just don't see that but I do love him
[1:23:08] I love him I'll go I still pray for him
[1:23:11] all right
[1:23:13] did you ever think of that God the Great
[1:23:15] Master rainbow in the sky we'd say it
[1:23:18] like that with the seven spirits of God
[1:23:20] red perfect love after that comes feel
[1:23:24] your love from Agape to feel your love
[1:23:27] that's the love that you have for your
[1:23:30] wife if some man would insult her you'd
[1:23:33] shoot his brains out see because it
[1:23:35] causes or creates a jealousy but that's
[1:23:38] filial love look secondary love
[1:23:41] it's not it was created
[1:23:48] it was created love
[1:23:50] it should have never been filial love
[1:23:53] they should never been lust
[1:23:55] they should never have been perversion
[1:23:58] there was Agape Love in the in the
[1:24:00] garden before the fall
[1:24:02] all right listen then comes the lust for
[1:24:04] another man's wife then comes filth see
[1:24:07] it just becomes perverted but all of
[1:24:10] this kind of love had a beginning
[1:24:13] but when that real genuine love of God
[1:24:16] that I've been talking about comes into
[1:24:18] the human being by the new birth being
[1:24:21] born again it had no beginning and it
[1:24:24] will have no end it's that Genesis 1 26
[1:24:26] man that was made in His image you are
[1:24:29] then a Son of God and a daughter of God
[1:24:31] and your affections are on things above
[1:24:34] feel your love would make you shoot a
[1:24:36] man for insulting your wife agape love
[1:24:39] would make you pray for his lost soul
[1:24:40] that's the difference
[1:24:43] all right ready for this one 1958
[1:24:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:47] and then the first great spirit of God
[1:24:49] which is love
[1:24:50] God's like the great rainbow we couldn't
[1:24:53] imagine what he looks like but just say
[1:24:55] you look like the rainbow in spirit the
[1:24:58] perfect Spirit of love red blue the
[1:25:00] perfect Spirit of Fellowship just all
[1:25:03] perfect spirits and then they begin to
[1:25:06] condescend begin to condescending coming
[1:25:09] down and they come all the way down to
[1:25:11] filio love or agape love to feel your
[1:25:14] love and on down to lust and down to the
[1:25:16] lowest and when God himself became man
[1:25:19] Jesus he came down that same way to the
[1:25:22] lowest pits of hell and picked out those
[1:25:24] who he knew before the foundation of the
[1:25:26] world whose names were written on the
[1:25:28] book and redeemed them back to himself
[1:25:30] there you are the story of redemption
[1:25:33] cannot be fully known until we see him
[1:25:37] and stand in his likeness
[1:25:39] the full Plan of Redemption
[1:25:42] cannot be seen
[1:25:44] and here comes
[1:25:45] feel your love
[1:25:47] or agape love feel your love
[1:25:50] lust
[1:25:52] and then on down to perversion
[1:25:55] what are we looking at we're looking at
[1:25:57] Brotherly Love or brotherly kindness
[1:25:58] that's the love for the brothers love
[1:26:00] for the Sisters
[1:26:01] but when we get over on on the other
[1:26:03] side all that love is going to be in
[1:26:05] agape love
[1:26:07] amen
[1:26:09] brother Brown hugged those sisters over
[1:26:10] there and didn't bother him again I love
[1:26:12] poor blessed brother Ernie villain away
[1:26:14] with his heart he's passed on but he'd
[1:26:16] always tell mama he said sister Dale
[1:26:17] said I just love you so much he said I
[1:26:19] can't hug you here he said but I'll hug
[1:26:20] you in the millennium
[1:26:22] and that's true
[1:26:24] there's so much love now you just
[1:26:26] useful you have to
[1:26:29] and Mama gets hugged by a lot of people
[1:26:30] because she's Nanny and that's okay
[1:26:32] that's a bother I hope that don't bother
[1:26:34] nobody's feelings I think it's all right
[1:26:36] but now I'm not gonna go hugging Bob's
[1:26:40] two daughters no way why
[1:26:44] because you get to thinking about
[1:26:45] something and everybody else gets to
[1:26:46] thinking about perversion and all this
[1:26:48] other thing but when we're on the other
[1:26:49] side see there's not degrees
[1:26:52] but I'm telling what are you saying
[1:26:53] brother I'm saying we need to learn that
[1:26:55] now
[1:26:57] to be respectful
[1:26:59] be respectful of what you do be
[1:27:01] respectful of of sisters and brothers
[1:27:03] and be respectful
[1:27:05] when you come to the house of God to the
[1:27:08] minister of this preaching give him your
[1:27:09] attention give him your full full just
[1:27:12] for at least for a little while give him
[1:27:13] your attention
[1:27:14] because you know what he may be speaking
[1:27:16] from God to you and that's the only way
[1:27:19] you say well I'll I'll talk to God when
[1:27:21] I get home
[1:27:23] I doubt it
[1:27:25] I doubt it anybody want to make me a
[1:27:29] doubt I doubt it
[1:27:31] right here is right here
[1:27:33] I hear him clearly here because I want
[1:27:35] to hear one brother Bob brother Aaron
[1:27:37] Brother Louise different ones even the
[1:27:39] Sunday School teachers when they bring
[1:27:40] something and it brings Clarity that's
[1:27:43] not Humanity
[1:27:44] that's God
[1:27:46] because listen I'm telling you amen the
[1:27:48] devil does not want you to learn about
[1:27:51] God
[1:27:52] he does not
[1:27:55] to make you forget God
[1:27:57] worry about what's going on at home at
[1:28:00] the moment
[1:28:02] amen
[1:28:03] worry about everything in the world but
[1:28:06] what but God and what he's saying to the
[1:28:09] people
[1:28:11] you love the Lord
[1:28:13] let's stand our feet
[1:28:19] listen there is no way
[1:28:23] that we're going to make it without each
[1:28:25] other
[1:28:28] we're just not
[1:28:30] I got to have I got to have a head I've
[1:28:33] got to have brother Dale that teaches me
[1:28:35] even though he doesn't have to say a
[1:28:37] word right now the teaching back before
[1:28:42] is helping me
[1:28:45] I'm I'm sorry I hate to I'm going to
[1:28:48] toot my horn I listen to what brother
[1:28:49] Dale said while he was preaching
[1:28:51] all right I'll listen to it so I don't
[1:28:54] have to I don't have to wonder what he
[1:28:56] said it was ingrained in me but you know
[1:28:58] what the Holy Ghost job is to do one
[1:29:01] thing
[1:29:02] to lead you and guide you into all truth
[1:29:05] and bring to your remembrance the things
[1:29:08] that were said now today you may not
[1:29:10] remember out of this one hour you may
[1:29:12] not remember 10 minutes of it but that
[1:29:15] is your 10 minutes that God is speaking
[1:29:17] to you
[1:29:19] it may be brother Donnie's 10 minutes
[1:29:21] and maybe brother Ryan's 10 minutes
[1:29:24] there's one thing about old brother Ryan
[1:29:28] he'll send you a little note and say
[1:29:30] that was good spot on
[1:29:33] he ain't doing it to get he ain't doing
[1:29:35] it get took out to eat either
[1:29:38] he ain't doing it for he needs to go eat
[1:29:41] good grief
[1:29:43] all right let's go to the communion it
[1:29:45] anybody have a need and we need to be
[1:29:47] prayed for we'll head on into the
[1:29:48] communion and foot washing
[1:29:52] the Lord bless you I appreciate you
[1:29:54] we're gonna like I said we're going to
[1:29:56] start in brotherly kindness and we'll
[1:29:57] talk about selfishness
[1:29:59] next Sunday actually that was on here
[1:30:02] and it blanked itself out I don't know
[1:30:04] if the Lord didn't want us to talk about
[1:30:05] it today or not but it was on this
[1:30:06] that's why I hesitated a few minutes ago
[1:30:08] at the very end of this
[1:30:10] what I showed you on the screen because
[1:30:11] it was all the definition of selfish and
[1:30:13] what brother Brown said about having a
[1:30:14] selfish spirit so maybe we'll do it next
[1:30:16] Sunday that's the Lord tells me to stop
[1:30:18] let's go to communion all right but but
[1:30:21] let's just remember one thing
[1:30:22] selfishness if you'll look at
[1:30:24] selfishness just think about it
[1:30:26] when we grow up as kids
[1:30:28] we're selfish
[1:30:31] if we're untrained and untaught a kid is
[1:30:33] selfish my toy mine mine mine mine mine
[1:30:38] mine mine never never
[1:30:40] hardly ever will you get a kid to go
[1:30:42] well here play with my toy no you
[1:30:45] usually have to smack him pretty good
[1:30:47] and take the toy away from him and give
[1:30:48] it to
[1:30:49] the kid that's coming to visit right
[1:30:51] because that's because of selfishness
[1:30:53] because of what happened in the Garden
[1:30:56] of Eden Eve was selfish
[1:30:59] she didn't want to share it with her
[1:31:00] husband
[1:31:02] she wanted to do it herself
[1:31:04] it made her selfish and God said I hate
[1:31:07] that
[1:31:08] I hate that
[1:31:10] First Corinthians 11 23 for I have
[1:31:12] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:31:14] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[1:31:15] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:31:17] took bread
[1:31:18] and when he had given thanks he'd break
[1:31:20] it and said take it this is my body
[1:31:23] which is broken for you let's do in
[1:31:25] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:31:27] also he took the cup and when he had
[1:31:29] stopped saying this cup is the New
[1:31:30] Testament in my blood this new year as
[1:31:32] often as you drinking in remembrance of
[1:31:34] me for as often as you eat this bread
[1:31:36] and drink this cup you do show the
[1:31:38] Lord's death until he come wherefore
[1:31:41] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:31:43] this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[1:31:46] guilty of the body and blood of the Lord
[1:31:48] what is the body of the Lord You and Me
[1:31:51] but let a man examine himself
[1:31:55] that's why we announce communion several
[1:31:57] weeks in advance
[1:31:59] get ready
[1:32:01] pray
[1:32:02] ask the Lord to take all that claim my
[1:32:04] slate Lord
[1:32:06] dump all that in the sea I don't want I
[1:32:09] don't want it brought up because if not
[1:32:10] if I miss something
[1:32:12] I could be eating and drinking damnation
[1:32:15] for he that eateth and drinketh on word
[1:32:17] leaves and drink contamination to
[1:32:19] himself not discerning the Lord's body
[1:32:22] for this cause many are weak look that
[1:32:25] means it is happening
[1:32:27] it was happening in Paul's time in the
[1:32:29] Corinthians they're coming to the table
[1:32:30] eating and as as you know brother Ryan
[1:32:33] said different once they were coming and
[1:32:35] drinking and getting drunk and they just
[1:32:36] were having a it was just a feast to
[1:32:38] them no it's a solid should be a solemn
[1:32:40] time
[1:32:41] thinking of what the Lord did for us for
[1:32:43] this caused many or we can sickly among
[1:32:45] you in many sleep for if we would judge
[1:32:47] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:32:49] when we are judged
[1:32:51] read the scripture a few minutes ago we
[1:32:53] are chastened of the Lord
[1:32:55] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:32:57] world that's what I've been telling you
[1:32:58] for this whole today
[1:33:00] if you're separated if you have the new
[1:33:02] birth
[1:33:03] God in your soul you don't have to
[1:33:06] separate yourself from the world you're
[1:33:08] already separated from the world and
[1:33:10] whatever condemnation they get will
[1:33:12] never affect you
[1:33:15] never
[1:33:17] because you're born again you're locked
[1:33:19] in over here on this side sure we may
[1:33:21] have a lot of trials and tribulations
[1:33:22] and I was thinking the other day just
[1:33:24] for a second you know you you look at
[1:33:26] people and
[1:33:28] like brother John was talking about the
[1:33:30] the financial part of our of our life uh
[1:33:33] and and you'll be telling a lie
[1:33:36] if you said money in your pocket didn't
[1:33:38] feel better than not having any
[1:33:43] that's what I thought
[1:33:45] but what are you doing with that extra
[1:33:47] that you got in your pocket
[1:33:56] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:33:57] world
[1:33:59] the world's going to be condemned you
[1:34:01] and I are not
[1:34:03] to me that's the greatest money in the
[1:34:04] pocket there ever was
[1:34:07] all right
[1:34:09] to me folks that's safety
[1:34:12] if you'll learn how many of us have been
[1:34:15] places you didn't feel safe
[1:34:17] many
[1:34:19] it don't feel good does it
[1:34:22] but you got there
[1:34:25] and you ready to leave
[1:34:26] but what about I was telling the brother
[1:34:28] yesterday he's calling he had been
[1:34:30] Church in a while
[1:34:32] and he said he said he said brother wait
[1:34:34] he said I've got this Spirit on me that
[1:34:36] that people are trying to kill me
[1:34:40] pray for the brother I don't have to
[1:34:42] tell you who he is
[1:34:43] he said he said everywhere I go I think
[1:34:46] somebody's trying to kill me
[1:34:49] I saw a brother you quit coming to
[1:34:51] church I said if you'll come to church I
[1:34:52] said I promise you they ain't one person
[1:34:53] in this building trying to kill you
[1:34:56] except the preacher
[1:34:59] right
[1:35:00] we want to all die we want everybody
[1:35:03] needs for sure but but we're
[1:35:06] safety is here but see Satan wants to
[1:35:09] pull you apart
[1:35:12] this is the greatest safety net you'll
[1:35:13] ever get is to be among Believers
[1:35:15] because you ain't got to worry about
[1:35:19] just name 20 different things you don't
[1:35:22] have to be worried about definitely
[1:35:23] don't have to worry about me killing one
[1:35:24] to kill Ryan they sometimes don't want
[1:35:26] to choke him but I don't want to kill
[1:35:27] him
[1:35:29] you didn't know that did you you do now
[1:35:31] beware
[1:35:33] but they're safe and they're safety here
[1:35:36] what God's give us he's given us safety
[1:35:39] to come into a building and to be around
[1:35:42] brothers that you don't have to make
[1:35:43] sure you billfold like Tom used to keep
[1:35:46] his in his front pocket and and he kept
[1:35:48] it rubber band of course he had about
[1:35:50] that much money in his pocket he's done
[1:35:52] going on now so don't worry about it but
[1:35:54] but he had that in that front pocket so
[1:35:56] nobody could take it out of his back
[1:35:57] pocket well now he didn't do that at
[1:35:59] church you do that when you out yonder
[1:36:02] you ought to feel safe in here it ought
[1:36:04] to be comfortable
[1:36:06] some of you make it too comfortable
[1:36:09] when it comes to nap time
[1:36:11] we're for my brother and when you come
[1:36:13] together to eat Terry one for another so
[1:36:15] we're gonna do that in a minute feeding
[1:36:16] man hunger lady meet at home in other
[1:36:18] words Paul said hey you're not eating at
[1:36:20] a buffet table and saying it's communion
[1:36:23] we're going to take this solemn uh
[1:36:25] listen it's not a joy to eat that bread
[1:36:30] okay I know somebody like some people in
[1:36:32] this congregation likes to eat because
[1:36:34] they get the biggest pieces
[1:36:36] but but as far as sitting down and
[1:36:38] eating a meal is that's not what this is
[1:36:40] this is separate from that
[1:36:42] this is something we should do and and
[1:36:44] when we take that we should say Lord you
[1:36:47] took stripes for me
[1:36:49] you you drank you you didn't even drink
[1:36:52] the bitter vinegar they put it through
[1:36:53] your mouth and you spit it out
[1:36:55] because you know why because he said
[1:36:58] you're not going to eat this or drink
[1:37:01] this
[1:37:02] with me
[1:37:03] till we get over there
[1:37:05] so he didn't drink any more after that
[1:37:07] If any man hunger lady meet at home that
[1:37:09] you come not together under condemnation
[1:37:11] and the rest will I said in order
[1:37:14] when I come Paul said when I get back
[1:37:16] I'm going to set some other things in
[1:37:17] order
[1:37:19] so let's have just a moment of Silent

[1:41:29] evergreen tree
[1:41:32] I will carry my cross
[1:41:37] through the midnight
[1:41:41] come morning there's glory for me
[1:41:48] sometimes I'm despised and rejected
[1:41:55] and I question
[1:41:58] oh Father
[1:42:00] how long
[1:42:03] then I take one more look
[1:42:08] at Mount Calvary
[1:42:11] and it gives me the strength to
[1:42:16] go on
[1:42:18] you know he's talking with the with Jim
[1:42:22] it it was a probably an hour or more
[1:42:25] that I went through scripture and went
[1:42:27] through situations and things telling
[1:42:29] them you know not just what I just told
[1:42:31] you that was just a small snippet of it
[1:42:33] but I was thinking I thought Lord don't
[1:42:35] don't make me look
[1:42:38] so arrogant
[1:42:41] and different
[1:42:43] that he shuts down
[1:42:45] because you can I mean you can start
[1:42:47] telling people about this and you start
[1:42:48] and they're like
[1:42:50] you think you're perfect you know but
[1:42:54] praise God that didn't happen scripture
[1:42:56] started coming and and I was using some
[1:42:58] quotes from brother Brandon I just
[1:43:00] didn't tell him but uh that's okay
[1:43:03] when it comes to you when it comes to
[1:43:05] your memory you need to say it
[1:43:07] so I just kind of went through scripture
[1:43:09] and I said well what about this holy
[1:43:11] ghost thing Jim I said I said over there
[1:43:13] it says he's a comforter and said he
[1:43:15] would come back
[1:43:17] and not be just beside you but in you so
[1:43:21] now if I'm Gonna Act
[1:43:23] like the world
[1:43:25] that can't be inside me
[1:43:28] because I'm controlled by the inside guy
[1:43:31] so I just you know I just laid that out
[1:43:33] and we you know we were
[1:43:35] um
[1:43:36] uh heading toward I'll tell you exactly
[1:43:38] where it was at we were actually close
[1:43:39] to uh Monteagle Mountain coming back uh
[1:43:43] toward Chattanooga on 26 and
[1:43:46] and I just said Lord I just don't want
[1:43:48] that to be where he shuts it off and he
[1:43:50] thinks well this you know you're just so
[1:43:52] good
[1:43:53] tell you know Mr Goody Two Shoes you
[1:43:56] know you don't cuss you don't drink you
[1:43:58] know and I just tried to explain him I
[1:43:59] said look there's there's a motivation
[1:44:01] inside
[1:44:03] of me
[1:44:05] and I didn't say it but he realized
[1:44:07] smart enough to realize that he wasn't
[1:44:09] motivated by the same thing I was
[1:44:11] motivated
[1:44:12] because when he turned around I didn't
[1:44:14] know what he was going to say brother
[1:44:15] Michael I didn't know what he because I
[1:44:17] could see him out of the corner of my
[1:44:18] eye you know he's just kind of looking
[1:44:19] like this straight ahead and I thought
[1:44:21] he fixing to hit me
[1:44:26] here I am going up Monteagle Mountain
[1:44:27] that's not a good place to get whacked
[1:44:30] on
[1:44:31] but he just kind of turned like that and
[1:44:33] he said so that's what it means to be
[1:44:35] born again
[1:44:36] I said yeah
[1:44:38] that's what it means to be born again
[1:44:41] I said it just makes you different
[1:44:43] you're not like the world
[1:44:46] I said look I said and I told him we
[1:44:49] used to go hunting in South Carolina and
[1:44:51] that was just a bunch of Drinkers and
[1:44:53] smokers
[1:44:55] um Good Guys not not belligerent they
[1:44:58] didn't they could control themselves to
[1:45:00] a degree
[1:45:01] but uh you know brother Dale he
[1:45:04] he'd be walking by and
[1:45:08] you got enough
[1:45:11] you need some more two more
[1:45:13] let's just hang on a minute we'll get
[1:45:14] two more
[1:45:15] that's great I wish that happens every
[1:45:17] time
[1:45:19] fill them all up fill my cup Lord
[1:45:21] and fill their cut
[1:45:24] all right I just I want everybody to
[1:45:26] take communion that means that things
[1:45:27] are going at least going right for the
[1:45:29] moment all right but let's just continue
[1:45:32] this thing on to the coming of the Lord
[1:45:35] and
[1:45:36] and back to what I was saying
[1:45:40] so he said that and
[1:45:43] and it was it was it was like and then
[1:45:46] the second statement was it wasn't like
[1:45:48] well okay that was just
[1:45:51] no something went off
[1:45:54] because he he felt condemnation
[1:45:57] immediately he said
[1:45:59] so I got to start doing better
[1:46:01] he said because I let him slip every
[1:46:03] once in a while and he does because I
[1:46:05] heard him you know I said well yeah
[1:46:07] I said well as you work on it at least
[1:46:09] you know to work on it
[1:46:11] um and then knows the difference between
[1:46:14] just being religious
[1:46:16] and having the new birth
[1:46:18] because there's a big difference
[1:46:20] huge difference
[1:46:21] all right everybody ready you ready yeah
[1:46:23] we're good all right let's take
[1:46:37] amen
[1:46:44] when I talk to people
[1:46:48] of course I asked the Lord just from to
[1:46:50] say for him to say the right thing
[1:46:53] but I think Lord they don't hear this
[1:46:55] every day
[1:46:59] they're just like well you know you
[1:47:01] ain't perfect I ain't perfect we're good
[1:47:05] my denomination says
[1:47:08] my church says come as you are well
[1:47:10] that's okay this church says coming you
[1:47:12] are too but
[1:47:14] don't leave as you came
[1:47:17] we believe in a change
[1:47:19] we don't believe in just continuing on
[1:47:21] the same way you are
[1:47:22] because even when even in in Redemption
[1:47:25] it's you know when you when you repent
[1:47:28] what does it do you turn
[1:47:30] and going another Direction that's what
[1:47:32] I was telling you Jim I said
[1:47:35] I said that's what I was telling John
[1:47:37] stump I said well John what'd you get
[1:47:38] saved from I said you're doing the same
[1:47:39] thing he's doing when I met you the
[1:47:41] first time several years ago
[1:47:43] and he just kind of looked at me
[1:47:44] bewildered I said well if I knocked you
[1:47:46] off of this boat
[1:47:48] and you couldn't swim
[1:47:52] and I reached and got you
[1:47:54] pulled you back in the boat where it was
[1:47:56] safe
[1:47:58] that's saving you
[1:48:00] you were drowning
[1:48:02] I said so you're telling me I can knock
[1:48:04] you off the boat and you can go ahead
[1:48:05] and drown and still be a Christian
[1:48:09] I never thought about that way when
[1:48:11] people tell you that sometimes it's okay
[1:48:13] but sometimes it's a cop-out they're
[1:48:15] just like I'll leave me alone you know
[1:48:16] so I just left him alone
[1:48:17] but the only light they're going to see
[1:48:19] is going to be me and you
[1:48:21] the only light they're going to see
[1:48:24] True Light let me put it that way the
[1:48:26] only true light they're gonna see
[1:48:28] is me and you so let's go to the foot
[1:48:29] washing scripture let's pull it up on
[1:48:31] the screen
[1:48:33] John 13 says supper being ended the
[1:48:36] devil having now put in the heart of
[1:48:37] Judas is Carrot Simon's son to betray
[1:48:39] him Jesus knowing that the father had
[1:48:41] given all things into his hand that he
[1:48:43] was come from God and he was getting
[1:48:44] ready to go back to God
[1:48:46] he rises from supper and laid aside His
[1:48:48] Garment took a towel and girded himself
[1:48:50] and after that he poured water into a
[1:48:51] basin and began to wash the disciples
[1:48:54] feet and wipe him with the towel with he
[1:48:56] was girded
[1:48:58] he rises then comes he to Simon Peter
[1:49:01] well here's Peter and Peter said Lord do
[1:49:04] you wash my feet dust I wash my feet
[1:49:06] Jesus said what I do thou knowest not
[1:49:08] now but Thou shalt know Hereafter he
[1:49:10] knew the dead Pentecost was coming Peter
[1:49:13] said unto him Thou shalt never wash my
[1:49:14] feet don't ever tell Jesus never
[1:49:18] you'll get an answer just don't tell him
[1:49:21] never
[1:49:22] all right Peter said unto him Thou shalt
[1:49:23] never wash my feet Jesus answered and
[1:49:25] said if I wash your if I don't wash your
[1:49:28] feet
[1:49:28] you have no part with me
[1:49:31] Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my
[1:49:33] feet only but also my hands and my head
[1:49:34] see Peter had to take some of that
[1:49:36] selfishness away
[1:49:38] you know washing my feet
[1:49:40] all right and you know why because Peter
[1:49:42] figured he was gonna have to turn around
[1:49:43] and watch Jesus's feet which he didn't
[1:49:45] but later on he washed his other
[1:49:47] disciples feet when they got the Holy
[1:49:48] Ghost
[1:49:50] Jesus said to him he that is washed and
[1:49:52] he is not saved to wash his feet but is
[1:49:54] clean ever wet but you're clean but not
[1:49:55] all for he knew you should betray him
[1:49:58] therefore he said you're not all clean
[1:50:00] so that would tell me that he washed
[1:50:03] judas's feet
[1:50:05] Judas was still there when this was
[1:50:06] going on somewhere in all this Judas
[1:50:08] left and went and did what he's supposed
[1:50:10] to do so after he had washed their feet
[1:50:12] and taken His Garment was set down again
[1:50:14] he said unto them know you what I have
[1:50:16] done to you you call me master and Lord
[1:50:18] and you say well for so I am
[1:50:20] if I then your master Lord Master have
[1:50:23] washed your feet you also ought to wash
[1:50:25] one another's feet for I have given you
[1:50:27] an example that you should do as I've
[1:50:29] done to you very very I say unto you the
[1:50:32] servant is not greater than his Lord
[1:50:33] neither he that is sent greater than he
[1:50:36] that sent him if you know these things
[1:50:37] happy are you
[1:50:39] everybody happy
[1:50:41] are you if you do them it's happy time
[1:50:44] when I come to communion
