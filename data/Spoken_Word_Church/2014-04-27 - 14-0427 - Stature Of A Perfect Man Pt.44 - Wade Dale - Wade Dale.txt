TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so Bob only you going to go to Min yeah you are well then you going to do Sunday school next day too okay so you can I'll drive and you can meditate okay then you can drive and I'll sleep so you have any other plans that day or anything beside that all righty good all right let's turn to second Peter 1 let's get started on godliness we were patiently finished with patience so now we're going to get into go it's going down the table I it now where are we patience godliness patience have patience be patient have patience why triv when it run down there you go thank you second Peter one verse one I should have made these can you see that Rebecca can you see that me what okay D Joe right okay I'm going to make it a little bit bigger next time but when I get you have I'm doing this on the computer at home and I'll go up to about 14 or 16 on the fonts and I don't know how big that looks but it must need to go to 20 because that's I mean I can do this but that's not going to that's not going to help a lot so anyway okay Simon Peter a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to him that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto thee through the knowledge of God and Jesus our lord that's what we're doing now we we're getting into the knowledge of God cuz it all is Godly knowledge there's knowledge on the pyramid and we went through that but all this is knowledge cuz knowledge is knowing right knowledge is having is knowing what you're doing all right so that's what God wants us to do he give us the new birth as a guide but even being our gu if you have a guide you need to be guided to somewhere uh Danny and I don't need a guide where we went fishing yesterday we've been going up there for 30 years we know every inch of the place so we don't need a guide there why cuz we already know what we're doing but now if he and I were to go to Colorado fishing on the White River or go to Montana on the White River fishing we going to need a guide CU you never been there before so being the God's give us the a guide the Holy Ghost and being that he was a guide then he's the one that's going to have to guide us into all truth that's what the Bible says he lead and guide you into all truth and all truth is is that we're not just to get the new birth and then sit down and and be still no we got to fight for every inch of ground same with Joshua Joshua had to fight sure the land was his but he had to fight for every inch of it so that's what we're doing now we're fighting a battle and we'll see here that in godliness watch as we go on through this cuz I want you to see grace and peace be multiplied on you through the knowledge of God as we grow up this statue of a perfect man we should be more aware of what's going on around us we should be growing we should be how many of you are praying for godliness how many of as we go through I know Sister Johnny is cuz she sends me emails and how that God's helping her and and that's wonderful you can send me emails if you want to it it's nice to to sometimes to voice you know what's going on in your life but have you prayed godliness or we just going through this and you're saying well then you just teach me see that's no more than Catholic Church that's right that's no more than a Catholic Church I'm standing up here and you say oh brother way that's wonderful I just about saying well Pope thank you very much for that's right you understand what I'm saying you got to obtain listen verse one to them that have obtained to them that have obtained Peter didn't say I've obtained it and you can't get it see that's what the Catholic Church does they say we've got it the Pope's got it and nobody else can get it but we're going to tell you what it is and you just accept what we say right okay well see that's where like I was saying the other Wednesday night about Dogma that's a personal view personal view that's just like this now that's totally different than Revelation now Revelation is this Jesus didn't have a Dogma Jesus had a Doctrine that's right there's a difference in dogma and Doctrine right if you bring Dogma then you bring your own idea that's right that's right that's right it's pretty simple you know if you're dogmatic about something that's okay to be you say that word but still you got to be careful cuz the Catholic Church says this is the way it is and that's what brother Bram said Creeds and dogmas has bound the Holy Ghost why CU this is it Pentecost bound the Holy Ghost by their Dogma that says You must be you must speak in tongues to receive the Holy Ghost that's a Dogma now that's not a Doctrine right sure they say it's a Doctrine they uphold it as a Doctrine but it's man's ideas that's right and if we're just preaching man's ideas then we're just preaching Dogma we're just preaching dogmatic ideas that's my ideas and nobody else's right but if you take the word of God though it's a Doctrine Jesus had a Doctrine and his Doctrine was the truth every word of it that's right so if we come back to that I I I don't I don't understand when when uh some people say that that even I you know well Dad for one is is is uh arrogant and no there's a confidence and arrogance is really close but when you preach the word of God in its Purity that's not arrogant that's right Paul stood up one day and he preached to a great big group of people and he said you'll be judged by my gospel right and if an angel come from Heaven that's where he got his Revelation from he said if an angel comes from heaven in other words if an angel walked through that door and Stood Beside Me and preached anything else besides what I preach to you let him be a cursed that's right in other words he didn't come from that's right Heaven that's right you understand what I'm saying yes so why can't we be confident but not arant but confident in what God's given us and confident that if one word got us out of the garden being one word off going to keep us out of the garden that's true that's right but if we can find that one word and I a mean one word you what I mean the word that'll get us back in the garden why not be confident about it why not be like Paul Paul said I run this race well he was pretty you know he was a staunched Jew he was confident though you know why cuz he met God Moses was pretty confident Moses was a Meek and Mild man but he was very confident cuz God told him you're the one that's going to lead children of Israel out of out of Egypt that's right okay and even in his inadequacy even he need needed Aaron and he needed 70 people so what he got him to the promised land didn't he Joshua took him over but he got him to the promis land all right so that's what we're going to look at in godliness I hope that that we're building The Virtue knowledge Temperance patience and I hope that's something that you're praying for not just something that I'm going to teach you and you're going to hear it and it's going to click on and now I have knowledge of it and now I know no it's it's a daily walk it's your walk not mine nothing more than a daily walk with God in your job and if you're not working if you're retired then you should be more blessed that's right you got more time to study that's true okay so take that as take this as the virtues that we that are required remember they're not just needed they're required for us to take a body change right there's no way we're going to take a body change without these virtues working in our life is that right say amen that's right will not take a body change now you doesn't mean you're not born again doesn't mean you're not going to you're going to have to die that's right period there ain't no F there the butts about it Peter James and John had all the virtues they're dead Paul had the virtues he's dead something's got to take us on up to the Capstone that's right and not only change Sarah's body but Sarah's body had to be changed inside that's right right cuz she couldn't receive a child in the in when she was a young girl in the first place so not only did God change her back he changed her atoms inside her body so she could receive a child that's right so God's not only going to change these bodies he's going to like I was saying the other Wednesday night he's going to change this thing this thing is vile this thing is is not there flesh and blood is not going to inherit the Kingdom but but the flesh and blood that he gives us that's right that's right what he did last Sunday dying for our sins and and raising up in in that raising up he glor he took us and we're already in a glorified condition right in his mind we're already in a glorified condition that's right right that's right okay and I really caught something the other day and here we are back to what off the subject again but okay but I was thinking about something the other day um Daddy's always said I got to quit saying Daddy they they tell me on the internet not to say Daddy because they don't some don't know what I'm talking about brother Dale says that watch that you don't redeem yourself out of existence okay see I caught that when I was preaching on that little Wednesday night if you say this body is going to be redeemed as it is you hear me as it is M what is redeemed is to take back to its original condition well the original condition of this is back down in the earth that's good ain't that right that's right the original condition of this thing right here was my mom and daddy ate beans and potatoes and it's in the earth so if I want this redeemed back right I'm going to redeem myself out of existence I'm going to be potach and calcium and all that stuff we got to get to see that God in his mind before the foundation of the world he saw what you were going to look like and he connected to you down here that's right and this is going to go but it's not going to go in this right exactly this is Fallen condition right but redeem means to bring back right right so what's he going to bring it back to what he saw right what he saw cuz it's always remember and that brought back Ephesians 1 again that we were chosen in him not of him in him right so if his body's redeemed M mine's were that's right he didn't see Sharon Rose at8 months he saw no he didn't he saw her as a 20-year- old woman so where did that body come from that's right that's what we saw and you know when you and I were discussing that listen one more thing cuz there was a lot of people thought I was saying something I wasn't it is this body redeemed MH right but it's not this body redeem you understand what I'm saying it's the framework it's who I am it's the human being that I am all right but with Sharon Rose now she died in 6 months old right or 8 months whatever it was she was a baby yeah now listen let's just be plain and honest Sharon Rose the baby that died when hope died brother Brown's first child when he went wherever he went in that Vision he saw a 20-year-old girl standing there she says Dad he said I didn't know who she was now listen let's just be real honest you say well it was that 6mon old body made into 20-y old now those things that was in a six-year-old body six-month old body that's not in 20 old body everybody understand what I'm saying yes humanly speaking yes that had to come from the mind of God that's right but see in the mind of God is calcium potach hey he's that where do you think he created it from that's right he created it from his mind his mind the expansion of God is what we're standing on right and then brother BR said he brought us down here to what display his attributes amen that's right to display his RB because we're going back not into the mind of God because we've already come forth and once he speaks it we're not going back cuz like Brother D said we're going to speak oursel out of existence if we keep going back too as as a lot of message people say you know we're we're going to we can't go back to because back to in the Garden of Eden this was in the dirt right we got to go back to that mind of God where he saw this here and he's going to put it together change everything that's why it's called change that's right he going to change everything and then we're going to walk on the earth like we should have had there not been a fall right now we spoke that a thousand times but I hope it comes more alive to you now that that we are not we are not going to redeem oursel out of existence the true ones that's right the True Believers know where you come from and you can say I came from God and I go back to God well where was I then I was in the mind of God but once he spoke it once it come from a thought and then it was expressed it can't go back the other way because it's already expressed that's right so this is the mind of God expressed right in its natural reality right because God's thoughts are Eternal so if anything comes from God it had to be Eternal if we come from God and go back to God it's got to be eternal right God saw a positive photogra of us correct and we came in a negative in the negative form I read that quote that Wednesday night we're being developed to that positive if you'll read it says this the person inside of you there's a person being developed what it's for our it's not for God that's right it's for our Understanding God's already developed it before the foundation of world you and I just got to like I said the matching pieces they got to come together but see in our in our baby form of our new birth we're not at that condition yet everybody understand that cuz we still have the carnal mind we still have the things of the world and we still going to have the things of the world but we're going to have to learn how to handle the things of the world that's right by faith virtue knowledge Temperance you know what it's going to take a special Faith to get us out of here but it's not going to be a faith to where it's 10 steps where we've been taking one step it's just the same Journey one step at a time because you and I are finite right we forget stuff we remember stuff and then we forget more than we remember yes never do we remember more than we forget so we sure are not in a infinite condition cuz we forget well praise God I do I forget a lot more than I remember so we're going toward the positive though but you know what if this is laying in our in US it can be quickened that's right it's not laying in US it can't be quickened that's true like Aaron said Wednesday night in nonseed there's nothing to Quicken right okay so if you're nonseed you can't be quickened to this but if you are seed you can be quickened to this that's right and to take a body change we must have this because this is the power that works its way out that's right cuz God works from an inward to an outward Satan's trying to work outward and get our inward being cuz you can't get in the soul if you're born again that's right but he's trying to kill your body he's trying to get enough people killed you know to take the to take try to take godliness off the Earth but here God he puts all these wonderful people down here and Satan's edting and he says hey go at it yep because watch we're going to see it if we get to it brother random gives you a key right here let's finish reading this according as his divine power given us all things that pertaining to life and godliness through the knowledge of him that's called us to glory and virtue so he's already talking about godliness and a't got to it yet whereby are given to us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness godliness brotherly kindness brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they're already in you can you bir yes right you got all you need then you burn yes but abound right that means be overflowing that means be full that means you get a that's where the word Bountiful comes from you get a bountiful crop all right a bound if these things be in you in a bound they make you see that word I like that word make yeah CU it's like Monica with that spanking spoon she makes them kids be quiet why because she they know that that spoon's coming at of them not not going to feed in the mouth is going to hit the other end got it yes so so they make you these things in other words this is what I'm i i i i Circle that word in my Bible cu the way I see it is is when when you get these virtues it'll make you that's right it'll make you be this kind of person that's right cuz you lose your will after that yes sir not my will but thy will be done all right same way with you and I that you shall neither be Barren it'll make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unre fruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ now buddy if you got the knowledge of Jesus Christ you're there that's right okay and that's what I believe brother Brandon brought us was the mind of God he brought us the knowledge of Jesus Christ who he was what he was doing here exactly and why he was here right so then we can understand how we got here that's right what we're doing here and where we're going all right that which was which is which is to come right brother bam read that many times in the in the seal book and people don't catch that but that's exactly what the Seal's done it showed you where you come from what you doing here and where you going there's not a hope anymore there's not a hope you know in the Baptist Church meth they have a hope right we hope this happens we hope when Jesus comes we hope and it's okay to say hope because the Bible does in Romans 8 it says therefore we you know we have hope for it but but hope has to turn into faith and faith is where you have to say that's where the confidence in is in because hope is like well I don't know if Daniel 70 weeks is right or not brother randam made this here and he made so many mistakes here and brother randam wasn't right here the cloud here see that to me that's breaking all Faith down that's right and that's what Satan did with Eve he broke her faith down that's right now that's what he's trying to do you and I as the Bride As the eve of the end time he's trying to break us down right whether we're Christians or not he knows listen Satan knows whether you're born again or not you may not but Satan knows if you're born again or not he feels it he's the spirit he's a supernatural anointed being y so he knows whether you're born again or not that's why brother BR says when you get the new birth Satan turns every gun on you why cuz he knows he's going to try now to destroy destroy your body that's right get you off this Earth because this is his edting for right now right he wants to get you away from here he don't even want to see you again cuz see he can't go in the sixth Dimension that's one thing for sure Satan might can go in Four 3 2 and one or even five but six and seven he's not allowed I don't believe right I don't believe he's allowed there cuz only Christians going in the sixth Dimension and Jesus is the only one in the seventh glorified body in the seventh Dimension so Satan can only roam see to and fro in the Earth the Bible says right but not in the six Dimension he ain't roaming around I promise okay I got to quit preaching and start teaching finish that's good Greek lexican okay godliness means Holiness that's pretty simple but look reverence respect pety towards God or godliness and here is where that same word is used used Timothy must have had a good observation of this cuz a lot of this is in Timothy talks about godliness but watch and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness so there's a mystery of godliness what is it God was manifest In the Flesh justified in the spirit right seen of angels M preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world received up in the glory now about Jesus Christ right what about me and you if we don't make it personal that's right then it's just a hope so I hope Jesus did that that's right I hope he did no if you got the new birth you know that cuz great without controversy other words I'm not even going to argue with you Paul say I'm not arguing with you about this I'm just telling you who it it is God was manifest In the Flesh if you're born again that's exactly true justified in the spirit amen seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles aren't we doing that now same thing believed on in the world and received up into the glory that's where we're going to go when we get out of here then Timothy says in 1 Timothy 4:6 if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things Thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ nourished up in the words of faith and of good Doctrine wherein to thou Hast attained but refuse profane and old wives fables and exercise thyself rather unto godliness exercise do something all right exercise your faith for bodily exercise profit is little but godliness is profitable unto all things that's right okay having promise of the life that now is he just showed you what was right Jesus Christ what is you MH having promis of the life that now is and of that which is to come that which was which is which is to come all right that's good this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation in other words you should accept this it's worthy of all acceptance we should accept this that that's what he's talking about in second Timothy talks about the other side having a form of godliness not having godliness but a form because Satan has a form of godliness he's spiritual he's Supernatural so he has a form what's form is an image Satan wants to be God okay so that that's pretty simple having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away right so turn away from those things that are not godliness let's see what brother Brown talks about here but if you got genuine Faith then put genuine virtue to it then genuine knowledge then genuine Temperance then genuine patience see you're moving right on up the line all right fifthly add godliness oh my godliness to be added what does godliness mean I looked on four or five dictionaries and couldn't even find what it meant finally I was brother Jeff there we found in the dictionary God and this means to be like God oh my after you got faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience then be like God you see I can't do that brother brandom oh yes you can there's where you better lay it on right there yes sir oh yes you can let me just read a few scriptures now then he's fixing to tell you how you can is that kind of right pretty simple if he says yes you can a prophet just don't say yes you can and leave at handang he brings you back to the word because being a word prophet he has to tell you how this is going to happen that's right all right let me just read you a few scriptures here just in Matthew 5:48 we'll take this one and see what it sounds like Matthew 5:48 see if you're supposed to be like God you know the Bible says ye are Gods Jesus said so why all the virtue all the things that's in God is in you mhm Matthew 5:48 be e Jesus speaking in Beatitudes be therefore p e r f e c what's that perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect you get way up here now before you're asked to do that so you're getting way up there before he asked you to be actually you can't act this you you can act but you can't be this part of godliness without faith and virtue and knowledge and Temperance these things are exactly the way they're supposed to be all right but now you get way up here before you asked to do that all these things has to be added first then when you get up here he's asked you now to be perfect godliness Sons and Daughters of God that's right how many things I could say along that line now he goes to Ephesians 4 what's Ephesians 4 how are you going to get godliness watch Ephesians 4 he gave some Apostles some prophets some pastors and some teachers some evangelists for the perfecting of the Saints let's turn to Ephesians 4 and find out over here in the book of Ephesians it says about this thing to about how we should how we should do Ephesians the 4th chapter begin with the 12th verse Ephesians 4 begin with the 12th verse all right let's begin up here at 11th birth and he gave some Apostles and some prophets remember last night don't try to take the other man's office see some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers for the perfecting of God does it read like that congregation say no the perfecting of what Saints who are the Saints the Sanctified ones the one started from down here I'm sure he's pointing at the bottom of the pyramid from down here all right perfecting of the Saints for the working of the ministry the ministry of Jesus Christ for the edifying of the body of Christ for the edifying building it up edifying until till what till we all come to the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God and to the perfect man and to the Assurance oh my to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ wait what sermon was that H what sermon was that stand the name of that statue of perfect man yeah there it is right there on the header okay right yeah that's what we're going to be on we're on the Statue of perfect man perfect takes godliness you have to add to your faith godliness see you start off down here with virtue then you go to knowledge and you go to Temperance then you go to patience now you're on godliness godliness oh my our time's getting away let's see but you know what godliness meant you sing the song to be like Jesus to be like Jesus on Earth I long to be like him all through life Journey from Earth to Glory I only ask to be like him that's godliness when he was Smite on one side of the face he turned the other when he was spoke too rough he didn't speak he didn't back they guard they always looking for one thing here's the key I always do that which pleases the father now boy we got a long way to go yes I always do that which pleases the father but now remember I stopped right there because it's a requirement we've come up this far and you say oh godliness is the is the roughest one one no I think brotherly kindness is the roughest one right patience patience is you know everybody's got their different ones that battles they got to fight but brotherly kindness brother randam says You must the Bible says You must love your neighbor as you love yourself you say well I love my neighbor he's a good guy don't ever give me no problem you got to love him just like you love you that's right that's what Jesus said he said the greatest commandment then what do he tell them he said love one another we'll see what brother Bri says about brotherly kindness that's why it's way up there at the top yeah cuz you got to have every one of these virtues before you can have brotherly kindness I promise you cuz that goes back remember we talked about faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness is something that's got to come from inside can you imagine what was said about brother bran and he knew what was said and yet they said he nobody knew who his enemies were that's what Billy Paul said said he did not know who you wouldn't know if you talked to brother brandham there was no way you could tell if somebody was for him or against him he spoke about every well see he had brother he had the Seal of God he had the Holy Spirit sealed all that in and and and before we get to there but I want you to chew on something you know brother brandham had to go up this statue of a perfect man before he could preach it you can't preach something you're not aware of you can't I mean you can preach it but you preach it in vain you preach it in Hope but brother B said it took him 30 years to preach this why CU God had to take him up that statute of perfect man just like he did Peter but see Peter and them stop where exist brotherly kindness there with the Holy Spirit molding all that together but the headstone or the Revelation that brought all these things together had not come yet but it did come to brother brandham see that's the adoption part you're not adopted at Faith you get the spirit of adoption at Faith everybody understand that maybe we'll talk about that next Sunday for a little bit because to come to adoption you receive the spirit of adoption in Romans 8 right somewhere in 16 or 18 somewhere in there in Romans 8 you receive the spirit of adoption crying ABA father daddy daddy crying you don't cry when you get up to brotherly kindness okay yeah but it's always go ahead to me a scatch up man is a working process all the time that's correct but but the whole thing is you try well I'm grown a lot I really do I have worse Val I have a better time with driving because of Dr um and she told me some some things to do but in the grocery store I have and it's not because somebody looking at me but the me and the devil we have a wonderful time where you have made a a me aware of I don't take nothing I I I cuz it's hard it's all get I to go to the the dairy Department you way over there in the bread Department yeah you don't took something you don't want it once upon a time I never PL where I left got it throw it out right but I have the worstest time in the grocery stores now when I get something and I got to go way on the other side and put it back because you got to Bight but but the whole thing is what I'm saying you working cuz I told you to make it better you got to make yourself better no nobody nobody know down but God knows and the devil said uhhuh and you I've done it recently Rome got to the car and said uhhuh you didn't put that SW back where you got from did you so he he check me out and said okay you can't count that as doing it so it's a working process it's not like you br you know you put your got go back but you always got to go up you got to keep checking check check to the check the check it's never finished project it's it'll finish but still that's human life I did the same thing yesterday I I went somewhere Jacob wasn't with me yesterday he went somewhere else and did some work and I was by myself I walked by a piece of paper I did the same thing that he had Dred on the ground cuz I knew where it come from it come out of Jacob truck it was in your yard or the yard up there and I walked by it and I was my back's been killing me for 2 or three days and I didn't want to bend over no more than I needed to you know I walked past that thing and I believe it was the Lord might have been the devil but sometimes you can't tell the difference maybe you can but I can't you know what but it came to my memory though you told them people y'all to make a place better whether you did it or not you make the place better when you leave so I turned back around walked over there and pick that piece of paper up put it in the trash okay so that it may not be the devil since Journey may be God saying hey there's your example and it's like you said I'm watching you I don't care whether everybody else is watching see I feel better now that's right by doing it you say pick a piece of paper the devil's going to condemn you all day if you don't that's right so best thing to do is even if he is condemning you walk over pick the sucker up put it in in the trash and go I'm done I don't have to deal with that no more just like here yeah this is a big example right here yeah big up like the other day I was coming up step they piece of paper about that big about in front of study I watched I don't know how many people walk over that pie of paper I thought now somebody will pick that piece of paper up they did I did and I I did that in the store I'll see a piece of paper pick up I mean you just try what we're trying to do is we're trying to that statue of perfect man is built like that to get the things of the devil off of you give don't he's going to accuse you I don't care if you wake up in the morning you're going to get accused but get rid of get rid get rid of get rid of get rid of that's what we're doing we're trying to get rid of all these accusations Lord bless you you I think that when you were
