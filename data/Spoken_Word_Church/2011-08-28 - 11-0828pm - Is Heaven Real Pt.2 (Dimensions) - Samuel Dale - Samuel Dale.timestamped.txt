[29:58] sir good to see everybody in the house
[29:59] of the Lord if you'd like turn in your
[30:01] scriptures turn to Isaiah
[30:04] 61 Isaiah
[30:10] 61 and acts
[30:13] 7 be basically the same reading but I
[30:15] want to show it like from the Old
[30:17] Testament and then coming over you know
[30:19] and if we can in what we're talking
[30:21] about I hope you enjoyed this morning I
[30:24] enjoyed bringing it and I pray that you
[30:26] you'll just it home and study it like I
[30:29] said if I was you I would try to get the
[30:31] message on the uh countdown and the uh
[30:36] present stage of my Ministry and listen
[30:39] to those over and over to uh to try to
[30:42] get a understanding because he explains
[30:44] a lot of the things and it saves me a
[30:47] lot of trouble and time to break it down
[30:50] now we got the one of the quotes back up
[30:52] here today but Joe was so particular on
[30:55] this U series until he spelled alter
[30:59] wrong this morning so he went back and
[31:01] and recopied it where he could get the
[31:03] word alter in the correct way but uh you
[31:06] know we're trying our best and they're
[31:08] doing their best to get everything in So
[31:10] Perfect an order and I told them I said
[31:12] don't worry about it that's that's no
[31:14] problem but he wanted to change it so he
[31:16] went back and spent his time changing it
[31:19] remember the Bible study
[31:21] 6:00 Saturday general questions we just
[31:24] maybe there'll be someone this maybe
[31:26] there'll be some some thoughts and
[31:28] everything and I did mess up this
[31:31] morning I was saying brother Wade and I
[31:33] went down and prayed for for brother
[31:35] Fred Hooper about a month ago but it was
[31:37] Brother Dean and I so you know just a
[31:40] slip in your human brain a cat Cranium C
[31:44] you know but just pray for us the Lord
[31:47] would bless us and keep all things in
[31:49] way and remember the family there
[31:51] brother Fred Hooper that has passed away
[31:54] and and you know just remember that okay
[31:56] Isa Isaiah
[31:58] 66 and then we'll go to the book of Acts
[32:04] 7 our precious Lord and our savior Our
[32:07] Redeemer our all in all and Jesus is
[32:10] your name thank you for that name thank
[32:12] you for everything Lord and we pray that
[32:14] you'd help us and guide us we realize
[32:17] realization that there is nothing in any
[32:20] of us that is worthy of anything
[32:23] whatsoever we are we're really not even
[32:26] worthy of being destroyed because
[32:28] there's nothing our in US worth doing it
[32:30] would take something to destroy us with
[32:32] and we're not worth
[32:34] that but yet you took us and you made us
[32:38] your children we thank you we love you
[32:42] and we appreciate it now just come and
[32:43] speak to our hearts and lives and those
[32:45] that'll hear the tapes and all we pray
[32:47] that you would just give understanding
[32:49] ears that we may all see you forgive our
[32:52] sins lead us guide us by thy Grace in
[32:55] Jesus name amen amen that's
[33:00] right
[33:03] Isaiah got warm up here so I get rid of
[33:06] my coat early I hope the put it on down
[33:09] if we can or whatever some's Fanning or
[33:11] something that was always that way but
[33:14] Isaiah 66 I just wanted to read this
[33:16] from the Old Testament then bring it
[33:17] over to the New Testament and try to
[33:19] pick up in to what we want to say so
[33:22] Isaiah 66 what does it say thus sayith
[33:25] the Lord the heaven is my
[33:29] throne and the Earth is my foot stol
[33:33] where is the house that ye build unto me
[33:37] and where is the place of my rest now we
[33:41] get over see Peter picked it up and
[33:45] carries it on a little bit so let's go
[33:47] over
[33:48] to acts 7 we'll start reading verse 40
[33:55] 4748
[33:58] but Solomon built him a house how be it
[34:00] the most high dwelleth not in temples
[34:02] made with hands as saith the prophet
[34:06] Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot
[34:08] stol what house will you build me sayith
[34:11] the Lord or what is the place of my rest
[34:16] look at the next one hath not my hand
[34:18] made all these things you may be seated
[34:22] the Lord add his Blessing to the reading
[34:25] of the word now Heaven is his Earth Is
[34:29] His foottoo
[34:30] what place could mankind
[34:34] build for almighty God to come down and
[34:40] dwell with
[34:41] us how beautiful a place would you try
[34:44] to make they have made great shrines and
[34:48] things around the world to their gods
[34:51] great
[34:53] multibillion dollar
[34:55] buildings uh you know things that are
[34:59] Beyond almost looking uh real and doing
[35:04] but yet spending it and overlaying a lot
[35:06] of it with gold and and doing all kind
[35:10] of things because they're wanting to in
[35:13] some way I guess you'd call it appease
[35:15] their
[35:17] God but he said Heaven's my
[35:21] Throne Earth is my foot stool right now
[35:25] that would be a pretty good sign
[35:28] fell
[35:30] right cuz as Heaven goes as far as
[35:33] Heaven goes and it keeps on
[35:35] going you know and Earth would be your
[35:38] foot stool that would be you know I'm
[35:41] just saying that's how big my God is I
[35:43] don't think we can exalt him exal exalt
[35:48] exal him I want to exalt him and to try
[35:52] to bring him into the place of where
[35:55] that what I believe I see about him I
[35:58] want you to see that now we talk about
[36:01] this morning without backing up and and
[36:03] spending time with it uh we were talking
[36:08] about the
[36:10] dimensions and we live in the third
[36:12] dimension we live in light you know
[36:15] light and
[36:16] matter and uh we think this is a real
[36:20] place but then we find out about the
[36:22] fourth dimension that even demons travel
[36:25] in those diens itions and uh it would be
[36:29] like the Witch of indor the Prophet if
[36:31] you'll listen to the tapes I gave you
[36:34] you'll hear him explaining those things
[36:36] how that you know that uh that which of
[36:38] Endor was capable of entering into a
[36:42] position that she could actually enter
[36:44] the fourth dimension and actually bring
[36:47] Samuel out of that
[36:48] Dimension visible enough to and and and
[36:52] things that could be done you know
[36:55] through those dimension
[36:57] and my point has been trying to get you
[36:59] to see what that those dimensions are
[37:03] the higher we go the greater the uh the
[37:08] uh the more real it
[37:11] is we we're we're trying to hang
[37:14] here you know we try to hang in this
[37:16] world right but yet science has carried
[37:20] us so fast through space until you know
[37:23] we've entered other dimensions and
[37:25] things Einstein said in the fourth
[37:27] dimension that you could take a ball and
[37:30] pass it through another ball at such a
[37:32] greater speed that it would actually go
[37:34] through and never disto disturb any of
[37:37] the molecules of that ball none
[37:41] whatsoever you know and and you know
[37:44] those things you say they're not uh
[37:46] they're not capable of doing it uh I've
[37:49] never been able to do it but there's
[37:51] people that can take a straw and hold a
[37:53] straw and an IR potato if you if you had
[37:56] never seen it you wouldn't believe it
[37:59] take that straw and work it backwards
[38:01] and forth and hit that potato and the
[38:03] straw will go through the
[38:05] potato up you're in Gainsville when uh
[38:09] the tornado struck Gainesville in 36
[38:12] they
[38:13] found pine needles sticking through
[38:15] railroad tracks
[38:19] y That's how fast it would
[38:22] mooving see and see that's what we are
[38:25] we're just in a dimensional
[38:27] barrier and things are keeping us from
[38:30] being able to do and some people will
[38:32] never because they can't believe and
[38:35] they'll never be able to to enter into
[38:38] uh other dimensions and think about
[38:41] things but that's the one thing that
[38:44] when we get back to Earth We're still up
[38:46] in heaven now all right when we get back
[38:49] down to earth we will talk about how the
[38:51] soul of an
[38:54] individual is super
[38:58] natural thing right all right and try to
[39:02] bring out those things to see that even
[39:05] the the soul of a sinner look what we've
[39:07] done look in my time in in in 71 years
[39:11] we went from a horse and buggy that's
[39:14] right yep to an
[39:17] astronaut and it just no limits as to
[39:21] what they're doing you read the other
[39:22] day about now that they're they're
[39:24] putting humanoid
[39:28] which is not what we called them in the
[39:29] old days the old days they talked about
[39:31] humanoids and and they were going to
[39:33] take the parts of a man and put him
[39:35] together and parts of a machine put him
[39:36] together and they've been able to do
[39:37] pretty good at that cuz they got people
[39:39] that can run and do things but they've
[39:42] got a humanoid now that can actually
[39:44] think out things and go into outer space
[39:47] and be able to make calculations and do
[39:49] all kind of things because it's a robot
[39:51] that's made for those things they
[39:53] actually call it a humanoid because it
[39:55] is cap capable of making decisions you
[39:59] say well is it a soul no it's not making
[40:01] decisions they give it 10 to make and it
[40:04] can make one of the 10 it's not thinking
[40:07] it's this this don't work that work this
[40:09] don't work it's got to match with one of
[40:11] them all the way around somewhere but
[40:13] you know we're in a
[40:15] supersonic y time and
[40:19] life but yet we're trying to study the
[40:21] dimensions to see how that each one gets
[40:24] greater and greater and greater and
[40:26] greater until we finally will one day
[40:29] return back to where we came from and
[40:32] which is heaven and I sold you this
[40:34] morning and I believe that a dimension
[40:37] signifies a
[40:38] limitation
[40:40] yeah a dimension signifies a limitation
[40:44] life like matter you know life like time
[40:48] whatever you want to call them it's a
[40:50] limitation M cuz it's a
[40:54] dimension see then in in doing
[40:57] that one day though all of these
[40:59] Dimensions will be incorporated and
[41:01] it'll come back to
[41:03] Eternity because heaven has no
[41:06] Dimension there's not a dimension of
[41:08] Heaven that's that's the one I'm talking
[41:10] about now and now listen get it out of
[41:13] your mind what I get out of your mind
[41:15] what I'm not talking about the Bible
[41:18] says the Heaven and Earth will pass away
[41:20] and brother brandom calls Heaven the
[41:22] first Millennium calls the first Heaven
[41:23] first the Millennium we'll get to all of
[41:25] those signs so don't get tied up into
[41:28] all of when I'm talking about heaven now
[41:30] I'm talking about past all
[41:33] Dimensions I'm not talking about even
[41:35] the seventh Dimension that where God is
[41:38] at the
[41:39] time right amen those are just for times
[41:42] and beings and purposes I am talking in
[41:45] all of my thoughts I've been have been
[41:48] keeping telling telling you ever service
[41:50] we are back in eternity we are not we
[41:54] haven't come down to our son rainb both
[41:56] we haven't come down the the to any
[41:59] Dimension yet we're just talking about
[42:03] Dimensions we're still talking about
[42:05] eternal life right that's what I'm
[42:08] trying to get you to see eternal life
[42:09] has no beginning and no ending am how
[42:12] can you put it in a dimension right and
[42:15] it's not it's not the number seven
[42:17] that's why your Dimensions ends with
[42:18] seven that's right but then eternity is
[42:22] an
[42:23] eight so then get into the future home
[42:26] message and study what the prophet is
[42:27] saying over and over and how the Holy
[42:29] Ghost fell on the eighth day how that
[42:31] Jesus was circumcised the eth day how
[42:33] all the things that took place and all
[42:36] of being the Eighth Day are eternity
[42:39] amen all right see because there there
[42:42] are great things there to be able to
[42:45] look
[42:45] at but I've tried to get you to see that
[42:49] that things are
[42:50] real and we talked about the fourth
[42:53] dimension and and demons traveling and
[42:56] and talked about cancer being a fourth
[42:58] dimensional disease he said all diseases
[43:01] are fourth dimensional all right that's
[43:03] why you can't kill them out you can't uh
[43:06] uh eradicate them uh you can you know
[43:10] what what is it that turns into it um
[43:14] um you had
[43:16] measles measles or which one was it that
[43:19] turns into these dreaded diseases today
[43:22] you know and you know chicken pot
[43:27] it turns into dreaded diseases today see
[43:29] they thought they eradicated it they
[43:31] eradicated it back as I said the cancer
[43:34] can be brought back down to the place to
[43:36] below 880,000
[43:38] whatever the are of it they call it but
[43:41] you can never take it out of the body CU
[43:43] it's a
[43:45] demon only God could drive it out of the
[43:48] body now he can do that I believe in
[43:51] that amen but that's you know we've got
[43:53] to keep in there so we keep going to
[43:55] more or less
[43:56] going into more
[43:59] tangible and I want you to look at this
[44:02] drawing we were giving this morning
[44:05] because brother Joe and him we worked
[44:06] for hours up and down trying to get this
[44:09] to where uh you know I'm so pleased to
[44:13] have these is is doing it but they
[44:15] almost had to make their own computer
[44:17] programs to to be able to do some of
[44:20] these things and sister Esther was back
[44:22] there a while ago talking about Joe's
[44:23] doing what he done and she said I you
[44:26] doing something nice I said you didn't
[44:27] think your brother could do that did
[44:29] well I know I couldn't because a lot of
[44:32] the overlay all the things you're
[44:34] looking at is colorful overlays and it's
[44:37] not just bring it down see to me I'm
[44:39] just okay here make
[44:42] this he said well I've got to make it
[44:45] into this program I got to make it into
[44:46] this program I got to put it into this
[44:48] program I got to bring it into this
[44:50] program here we've got you know brother
[44:53] Anderson brother Bob sitting here out in
[44:55] the audience now that they can tell you
[44:57] A lot of that stuff is it it just took
[44:59] hours to be able to move this around to
[45:03] be able to get what we wanted to make it
[45:06] look in the correct order but I want you
[45:08] to look at something and we'll get back
[45:09] to it later on a whole lot more look
[45:12] very carefully into what is said to the
[45:14] souls under the altar in other words the
[45:16] sixth
[45:17] Dimension if you look in there you'll
[45:19] see
[45:20] trees you see
[45:23] grace now when brother randam went
[45:25] beyond the curtain
[45:26] time what did he
[45:29] see well he just didn't see nothing now
[45:32] he said people come running over the
[45:34] hills he said beautiful is not a
[45:37] word Immaculate what was the words he
[45:40] used he said there there nothing to it
[45:43] he said it's far beyond that right we
[45:46] know what it was real right you know
[45:49] those people was real right you know he
[45:52] could feel them right he could touch
[45:54] them he said now come on right that even
[45:58] women that you could feel and said you
[46:01] know what I mean yeah he said but all
[46:04] the sex glands was gone and there was no
[46:08] problems with hugging the women
[46:12] right see but it's real that's why I had
[46:16] him to put it like that with trees and
[46:18] things and put an altar in there because
[46:21] the Soul's under the altar crying how
[46:24] long the the sixth Dimension all right
[46:27] then look at the sixth going on into the
[46:29] seventh and then look over to the left
[46:32] hand side and you'll see the River of
[46:36] Life coming
[46:39] down because it can run all the way down
[46:42] into the sixth
[46:44] Dimension cuz it can run down all where
[46:47] man is that's cuz the sixth Dimension is
[46:50] the Christian remember but look up above
[46:53] and see heaven and you see trees and and
[46:56] and and we have to use
[46:58] clouds but clouds signify in this
[47:02] Dimension a a wrong act or a
[47:05] destructiveness because there was no
[47:07] clouds in the sky but yet we use them
[47:10] for this and I don't see anything wrong
[47:11] with it today you know to be able to one
[47:15] of these days lay down in the in in the
[47:17] the beauty of Eternity and see the
[47:19] clouds going across and see the trees
[47:22] and the mountains and climb Mount
[47:24] Everest man never even lose your breath
[47:26] and you know just uh you know what's uh
[47:31] why can't we think right what's wrong is
[47:34] brother Dale just a a a
[47:37] intellectual giant of some form you're
[47:40] looking at the most stupid thing there
[47:42] is when it comes to anything that's not
[47:44] that God doesn't relate to
[47:48] me but yet think about it heaven is real
[47:53] amen eternal life is real M right it's
[47:57] not a zap of electricity that you feel
[47:59] right or drops are falling and I'm not
[48:01] against you saying that that's what
[48:03] happened to you but that's not eternal
[48:06] life eternal life is a
[48:09] person right and he's the person of
[48:13] eternal life dwelling in you you can't
[48:15] explain that right how can you explain
[48:19] as I keep saying there 7 billion people
[48:21] in the world God could give everybody in
[48:22] the world a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[48:24] today you believe it right
[48:26] and that wouldn't make him no less
[48:29] right but everybody would have the
[48:31] person of Jesus Christ that's right one
[48:34] of these days we'll connect that
[48:36] together but you see then you get up
[48:38] into and if you'll notice the light is
[48:40] called Heaven of
[48:43] Heavens Heaven of Heavens see we only
[48:46] just take the word
[48:48] Heaven if you get the other one and then
[48:50] we'll start reading a few
[48:51] things but it's just more or less the
[48:54] next one got is more more or less you
[48:56] know brings it down to basically zeroing
[48:59] in on the seventh dimension in
[49:03] heaven cuz I want it in your mind to tie
[49:06] it all together and just to look at
[49:08] things and now let's read some things
[49:11] that the Bible says about these
[49:16] Heaven of
[49:18] Heavens
[49:20] Heaven of
[49:22] Heavens let's just pull that up brother
[49:24] Richard get on there the scriptures all
[49:29] right look at
[49:31] it look at the many times that it's
[49:34] mention I mean directly this way because
[49:36] you can line up other words I did just a
[49:39] couple but look Deuteronomy 10 and 14
[49:42] says behold the
[49:44] Heaven and the heaven of
[49:49] Heavens is the Lord's thy God the Earth
[49:52] also with all that therein is First
[49:56] Kings
[49:57] 8:27 but will God indeed dwell on the
[50:00] earth behold the heaven and Heaven of
[50:04] Heavens cannot contain thee how much
[50:07] less this house that I have builded
[50:09] that's right we know that's coming down
[50:11] to like Solomon and 2 chonicles 2:6 but
[50:16] who is able to build him a house seeing
[50:19] the heaven and Heaven of Heavens cannot
[50:23] contain him who am I then that I should
[50:26] build him an house save only to burn
[50:30] sacrifice before him then that
[50:33] UN 2 Chronicles
[50:36] 6:18 but will God in very deed dwell
[50:40] with men on the
[50:42] earth behold Heaven and the heaven of
[50:46] Heavens cannot contain thee how much
[50:49] less this house which I have
[50:52] built Nehemiah 96
[50:57] thou even Thou Art Lord notice capital
[51:01] letter alone thou H has made Heaven the
[51:05] heaven of Heavens with all their host
[51:09] and the Earth and all things that are
[51:12] therein the Seas and all that is therein
[51:16] and thou preservest them all the host of
[51:20] Heaven worship
[51:21] thee Psalms 68
[51:24] and33 to him that rideth upon the
[51:27] heavens of Heavens now notice the other
[51:30] would say heaven and then Heaven of
[51:33] Heavens all right now it's coming down
[51:35] to what to the plural to him that ride
[51:38] up upon the heavens of Heavens which
[51:42] were of old Lo he do send out his voice
[51:46] in that a mighty
[51:48] voice Psalms 148 and four Praise Him ye
[51:54] heavens of Heaven
[51:56] and you Waters that be above the
[52:01] heavens I see two with plurals even all
[52:06] right Psalms 115 15 and 16 you are the
[52:10] Blessed of the Lord which made Heaven
[52:12] and Earth the heaven even the
[52:18] heavens are the
[52:20] Lords but the Earth hath he given to the
[52:23] Children of Men
[52:25] that's right all right yes sir now we're
[52:27] going to find out one of these days when
[52:29] we get started back this away you're
[52:32] going to see that this Earth wound up
[52:34] belonging to the
[52:38] devil and being his domain that's why we
[52:42] have trouble that's why I don't want to
[52:43] stay in this third dimension right I
[52:47] certainly don't want the
[52:48] fourth but we've got to deal with a lot
[52:51] of things all right now
[52:56] the point I want to make of the
[52:58] message as I
[53:01] said these heavens of
[53:05] heavens we don't have to do away with
[53:08] anything that's right we can just look
[53:10] how more positive it
[53:12] becomes as we're turning
[53:15] back to where we should have
[53:18] stayed heaven to me is a real place
[53:23] amen we wonder you know make the
[53:25] statement what is God to you you
[53:27] remember I've asked that for what 40
[53:29] years maybe what is God to you what do
[53:32] you think he is just floating around
[53:34] like a glob and there was nowh for him
[53:37] to float because there was nothing for
[53:38] him to float in you know cuz there was
[53:42] no molecules no iron no atoms no
[53:48] nothing see Heaven is so much Above This
[53:51] atmosphere as we want to call it this
[53:54] life
[53:56] until you don't need gas
[53:58] mask you know you don't need uh oxygen
[54:02] tents and I know it's carnal and forgive
[54:05] me for using
[54:07] carnality but any of you that ever saw
[54:09] the movies of Superman you've seen him
[54:11] come from a another
[54:14] planet which they were they had reached
[54:16] a superior race of
[54:19] people that was interplanetary travels
[54:22] everything was taking place and they'
[54:23] reached all of that and Superman when he
[54:25] came to Earth that's why he had his
[54:27] abilities now I'm just giving you the
[54:29] natural forgive me but brother brandham
[54:31] did run around and pull
[54:33] this hang out of the tree and go hard
[54:36] like tars but you know sometimes you can
[54:39] learn from what you
[54:42] see you know and and if you'll
[54:45] incorporate it but visualize something
[54:48] of so far
[54:49] above how would it be if we could some
[54:53] way take life like it is
[54:56] today take it
[54:59] back 6,000
[55:02] years to where there was no
[55:07] uh death sorrow heartaches
[55:10] troubles wouldn't that be a beautiful
[55:13] place wouldn't it be something if we
[55:15] could go back to the Garden of
[55:18] Eden can't you think in your mind like
[55:20] that but see we're not going backwards
[55:22] we're going
[55:24] forward
[55:26] if we went backwards we'd have trouble
[55:28] but think about the Garden of Eden where
[55:30] that the animals are there and they you
[55:32] know and they there's cheetah his
[55:33] brother ROM would say and said you
[55:36] know there's nothing wrong no no harm no
[55:41] wrongs no
[55:44] problems wouldn't that be a wonderful
[55:46] place well we're going to a place that
[55:49] that was created from
[55:52] y
[55:54] yep
[55:56] come on we'll get that we'll bring it
[55:57] over bring it into existence bring it up
[56:00] we're going to a place that that was
[56:02] created
[56:06] from but you
[56:08] see we're trying to get something to
[56:11] reality right yeah for you to think real
[56:14] is your God real or is he just a thought
[56:18] of your
[56:19] mind well I don't really know where
[56:21] brother random know what God looked like
[56:23] Jesus are you know might not have looked
[56:25] like uh
[56:27] Hoffman's well he never said that that
[56:31] was exactly what he did identically look
[56:33] like part he just said it's the best
[56:35] that he'd seen
[56:37] right but you see we want to argue over
[56:41] some situation and be in our dumb
[56:44] stupidity of living in this dimensional
[56:47] forms we're in trying to comprehend an
[56:49] eternal God that's it
[56:53] amen that can just move through space
[56:57] and do what he wants
[57:00] to if you don't get nothing out of the
[57:03] message today and you can do go ahead
[57:05] and make me anything you want to but I'm
[57:07] trying my best to get you to see that
[57:09] God is real eternal life is real it's
[57:12] not just a thought it's not a concept
[57:15] it's not a good feeling it's not a good
[57:17] desire a good idea right eternal life is
[57:21] eternal life which is almighty God
[57:25] Heaven is just as
[57:27] real right as Jesus Christ is
[57:33] real because we're still up in heaven
[57:35] now we haven't even started bringing you
[57:38] down to the Earth to talk about things
[57:41] we're still up in heaven step there with
[57:44] me to where he could see
[57:47] something you brother Dale but you sound
[57:50] like you're talking about a civilization
[57:51] existing before this I'm not talking
[57:54] about human civilization right right and
[57:58] we're not even got to the human
[58:00] civilization on Earth to get away from
[58:03] it I'm talking about the civilization
[58:06] that was the civilization of all
[58:09] civilizations yep which would be
[58:11] almighty
[58:15] God and then do you think that God is
[58:17] just floating
[58:20] around we'll get down and cover some
[58:23] scriptures
[58:26] as we condescend and
[58:29] eventually like I said there's a throne
[58:31] that develop is there in the seventh
[58:36] Dimension and the people are under the
[58:38] throne you know under the Sixth
[58:39] Dimension are under the throne a
[58:42] throne you know that somewhere in those
[58:45] dimensions and they have to be under the
[58:47] seventh there we will find a place
[58:49] called a white Throne
[58:51] judgment we will find a seat sitting
[58:54] there
[58:56] mhm according to Bible That's
[59:00] Right read your Bible read the book of
[59:04] Revelations let said this morning read
[59:06] five four and five and through
[59:09] there and see that in that doing John is
[59:12] describing a lot of the things that he
[59:15] sees when he saw him somewhere right
[59:18] amen yes sir that's right there'll be a
[59:21] judgment
[59:23] seat and then one one day from that
[59:25] judgment seat will announce an
[59:27] announcement listen enter ye into the
[59:30] joys of the Lord now which way is the
[59:33] person going from
[59:34] there right there will be people giving
[59:37] eternal life at the white Throne
[59:39] judgment right right and the Bible says
[59:40] enter ye into the joys of the Lord
[59:43] prepared for you before the foundation
[59:45] of the world are we still in the Bible
[59:47] right so there'll be people that are
[59:49] given eternal life that will be able to
[59:52] walk into eternity that's right
[59:55] they're not going to be held in
[59:56] Dimensions right that's
[1:00:02] right it won't
[1:00:04] work heaven is
[1:00:07] real that's right we'll get into it and
[1:00:12] see that Jesus comes writing back in
[1:00:15] Revelations 19 with his bride on white
[1:00:18] horses out of Heaven y
[1:00:23] right
[1:00:25] yep we'll see that there's a future
[1:00:29] home that comes down out of
[1:00:37] Heaven we'll see that there's water that
[1:00:40] they didn't consider it in Genesis that
[1:00:43] there's water that was above the heavens
[1:00:46] in other words up in
[1:00:49] heaven and there was water under the
[1:00:51] firmament down on earth right the Bible
[1:00:55] says it y that's
[1:00:58] right but what are we looking
[1:01:01] at well you're just confusing me brother
[1:01:04] Dale well now I'm as sorry as I can be I
[1:01:07] don't see how more simpler that that I
[1:01:09] could bring anything
[1:01:12] down cuz we're taking scientific and
[1:01:14] we're taking the prophet's message and
[1:01:16] we're dropping down and just simply
[1:01:18] talking because I don't have the voice
[1:01:20] to be able to preach so I just have to
[1:01:22] talk to you be like so said there by his
[1:01:27] wife she was doing pretty good this
[1:01:29] morning listening to the tapes until I
[1:01:31] got down into talking about some of
[1:01:33] these things and she jumped up and
[1:01:34] wanted to turn the thing off you know
[1:01:37] why I probably got to bothering her
[1:01:38] about me talking about TV and how that
[1:01:41] your clothes and the things you're
[1:01:42] wearing and all your garments is going
[1:01:44] right through here and God sees all of
[1:01:48] that and you're not hiding anything from
[1:01:52] anybody take your picture do what you
[1:01:55] want to slide them under the covers
[1:01:57] they're not hid
[1:02:02] am but how real is heaven to
[1:02:07] you brother random what about these
[1:02:09] heavens of
[1:02:12] Heavens what do you have to say about it
[1:02:15] all right let's start on number one on
[1:02:16] your
[1:02:20] notes what about it brother
[1:02:23] Brandon accepting God's provided way at
[1:02:26] the end time 1963 115 paragraph
[1:02:30] 35 and he's telling about the the
[1:02:33] Christian businessmen writing and saying
[1:02:36] that that what the vision brother randam
[1:02:38] had seen beyond the curtain of time and
[1:02:40] they wrote it exactly like he said it
[1:02:43] and he said he was pleased for
[1:02:45] that and see then they questioned him he
[1:02:49] said well you know Heaven is made for
[1:02:51] human beings there's no such a thing as
[1:02:53] Horses in heaven Heaven well I said I
[1:02:56] answered him back I said brother I never
[1:02:58] said I was in
[1:03:00] heaven it wasn't he under the Sixth
[1:03:02] Dimension
[1:03:05] right we read that this morning he was
[1:03:08] in the sixth
[1:03:11] Dimension I was asking where Jesus was
[1:03:15] see I never said I was in heaven I was
[1:03:16] asking where Jesus was he was still
[1:03:19] Beyond I said but if you it might help
[1:03:22] you but if it might help you a little
[1:03:25] The Book of Revelation it says when
[1:03:26] Jesus left the heavens of
[1:03:28] Heavens he was riding a white horse and
[1:03:32] all the host of heaven was following him
[1:03:35] on white horses see so that was coming
[1:03:38] from Heaven of
[1:03:42] Heavens so your Prophet knows about
[1:03:44] heavens of
[1:03:46] Heavens is heaven real brother random we
[1:03:50] would see Jesus I've give you this
[1:03:53] before
[1:03:56] 1957 number two on your notes 5:15
[1:04:00] paragraph
[1:04:01] e56 he's talking to somebody you know in
[1:04:04] pray line or
[1:04:06] something and he said that's how we
[1:04:09] don't have to guess anymore he said
[1:04:11] heaven is
[1:04:13] real Christ is real He's Alive
[1:04:17] Tonight
[1:04:20] now not just because he made that quote
[1:04:22] out of there
[1:04:24] he was standing there Discerning out
[1:04:27] things and praying for the sick to prove
[1:04:30] that Jesus was real and proven that
[1:04:34] heaven was real your brought your
[1:04:36] Prophet brought it right here cuz he
[1:04:38] could stand here in one dimension and
[1:04:39] see somebody else and call her name and
[1:04:41] said you live at so and so street so and
[1:04:43] so and so and so even till you heard the
[1:04:46] story and he told somebody where they
[1:04:49] lived at and these people they knew them
[1:04:50] and they run around where they at and
[1:04:52] they said well run around and missed out
[1:04:54] didn't he what do you mean yeah he told
[1:04:57] you you that certain address where you
[1:04:58] live said don't live there he said I
[1:05:00] moved that's
[1:05:03] right that's the point I'm trying to get
[1:05:05] you to see if Christ is real that could
[1:05:08] discern out thing heaven is
[1:05:11] real all right going down things that
[1:05:15] are to be 1965 1205 paragraph
[1:05:20] 42 and I do not think that heaven is a
[1:05:24] place that my mother used to tell me
[1:05:27] about I believe that the church has
[1:05:29] grown from that to think it used to be a
[1:05:33] hundred years ago or two I think the
[1:05:36] old-timers used to think that everybody
[1:05:38] everyone that died went up to heaven and
[1:05:41] had a harp and and sit up there on the
[1:05:44] clouds and and played a harp now they
[1:05:48] know that there was a place called
[1:05:50] heaven now they know that there was a
[1:05:52] place called heaven but but they if that
[1:05:55] be so all the musicians would have it on
[1:05:58] us you see and I wouldn't like
[1:06:01] that I can't play music cuz I I clap off
[1:06:06] mess up I
[1:06:09] can't see but watch what he said they'd
[1:06:12] have it on us you see but it it isn't
[1:06:15] that kind of a
[1:06:17] place it isn't playing Harps at all I
[1:06:20] believe don't believe the Bible teaches
[1:06:23] that
[1:06:24] but that was a conception that we had
[1:06:26] before the fullness of the word come
[1:06:29] into
[1:06:31] existence are you reading or the opening
[1:06:34] of The Seven Seals that's promised to us
[1:06:37] in this age that we then
[1:06:42] understand now he wasn't totally putting
[1:06:44] it just on where he went right even
[1:06:48] though that was great but we didn't get
[1:06:50] to goire with
[1:06:52] him we could believe he went and come
[1:06:55] back but he's putting it in the
[1:06:59] scriptures about heaven and it being
[1:07:01] real I believe that heaven is a real
[1:07:04] place just the same as this place is a
[1:07:08] real place see for God started us in our
[1:07:12] spiritual growth here in growth in this
[1:07:15] place and I believe that heaven is a
[1:07:17] place just as real as this where we
[1:07:20] don't set up there for eternity and just
[1:07:23] set on the cloud we don't just strum our
[1:07:27] heart for all all from here ever but
[1:07:31] we're going to a real place where we're
[1:07:34] going to do things where we're going to
[1:07:37] live we're going to work a lot of people
[1:07:40] don't like that word we're going to
[1:07:42] enjoy we're going to live we're going to
[1:07:46] life to real eternal life we're going to
[1:07:50] a heaven a paradise just like Adam and
[1:07:53] Eve worked and lived and Aid and enjoyed
[1:07:57] in the Garden of Eden before sin came in
[1:08:00] we're on our road right back there again
[1:08:03] right right back the first Adam through
[1:08:06] sin taking us out the second Adam
[1:08:08] through righteousness brings us back in
[1:08:11] again justifies us and brings us back
[1:08:19] in now remember what I brought out the
[1:08:22] other day to say time
[1:08:25] the prophet said we are in here and said
[1:08:28] we were horse and buggy and he said then
[1:08:31] we went to automobile and he said then
[1:08:33] we went to airplanes and he said then we
[1:08:35] went to
[1:08:37] astronauts interplanetary travel is a
[1:08:40] type of like the Rapture the things
[1:08:43] going into the moon was a type y of of
[1:08:47] the Rapture all right so listen to what
[1:08:49] he's
[1:08:51] saying countdown 19 in 6299 the morning
[1:08:55] service paragraph 111 it's the same
[1:08:58] thing in this day of atonement we have
[1:09:00] to come in the same way come by the same
[1:09:03] way by the same message by the same
[1:09:05] Christ by the same power that they
[1:09:07] received on the day of
[1:09:09] Pentecost the same way it has been all
[1:09:12] the time the same one because it's the
[1:09:14] same door and how do we get into this
[1:09:18] body by the door and Jesus is the door
[1:09:21] to this body so we come in and are born
[1:09:25] into the kingdom of God through the door
[1:09:27] Jesus Christ and now the door is just
[1:09:31] about to close at the lady ofan Li
[1:09:34] countdown and the church is fixing to
[1:09:36] take its orbit above all tribulations
[1:09:39] all everything and soar its way into the
[1:09:44] heavens of Heavens carrying the church
[1:09:48] to the bosom of
[1:09:51] God Heaven of heavens put it R what do
[1:09:54] you think about
[1:09:56] it number
[1:09:59] five accepting God's provided way at the
[1:10:02] end time 63 11:15 paragraph
[1:10:06] 35 this is another repeat almost but
[1:10:09] it's a little bit
[1:10:10] different and they said well Heaven is
[1:10:12] made for humans and there's so no such
[1:10:15] things as Horses in heaven well I said I
[1:10:17] answered him back I said brother I never
[1:10:19] said I was in heaven I was asking where
[1:10:21] Jesus was and he was beyond and this may
[1:10:23] be a total repeat cuz sometimes I do it
[1:10:26] but if it might help you to a little the
[1:10:28] book of re The Book of Revelation that
[1:10:31] says when Jesus left the heavens he was
[1:10:33] riding a white horse and all the host of
[1:10:36] heaven was following him on white horses
[1:10:39] see that was coming from heavens of
[1:10:41] Heavens I think that is a total repeat
[1:10:44] all right next one Spirit of Truth 63 11
[1:10:49] 1118 paragraph 67 the man said there's
[1:10:52] no such thing as Horses in heaven
[1:10:54] brother brandom heaven was made for
[1:10:56] human beings not horses well I thought
[1:10:58] well usually do you see anyone like that
[1:11:01] you have to explain everything they're
[1:11:04] just trying to pick something see you
[1:11:07] can't explain God anyhow you got to just
[1:11:10] believe him but it might comfort him I
[1:11:13] said brother I never said I was in
[1:11:15] heaven in the vision I asked for Jesus
[1:11:19] and they said he was still Beyond here I
[1:11:21] was in a state like Paradise but that it
[1:11:25] might help you the Bible said in the
[1:11:27] Book of Revelations that Jesus came from
[1:11:29] the heavens of Heavens writing on a
[1:11:32] white horse and all the host of
[1:11:35] Heavens was following him upon white
[1:11:37] horses so there must be some up there in
[1:11:39] the heaven of
[1:11:41] Heaven heavens of Heaven he PR it back
[1:11:48] there where did he go and what took
[1:11:51] place Be not Afraid not to 63 606
[1:11:55] paragraph
[1:11:57] 209 there they was just like we are
[1:12:00] today but you know
[1:12:02] what he hadn't really left them you the
[1:12:05] Bible said that he climbed up one of the
[1:12:07] Hill highest hills there was in the
[1:12:09] country so he could watch them and
[1:12:12] that's what he did when he left us at
[1:12:14] Calvary he he he when when he They
[1:12:16] Crucified him he never left us he didn't
[1:12:20] climb the highest hill but he climbed
[1:12:22] Calvary and kept on climbing past the
[1:12:25] moon stars Plumb on into the heavens of
[1:12:29] Heavens how are you go further you can
[1:12:33] see and he got so high till he has to
[1:12:36] look down on
[1:12:38] Heaven the Bible says yeah he weigh up
[1:12:42] in the heaven of Heaven ascended on
[1:12:46] high go up a far till you can't you look
[1:12:49] back down to see
[1:12:51] Heaven yet we don't believe Heaven's
[1:12:53] real oh it's just a dimensional just
[1:12:57] a mighty conqueror 1956
[1:13:01] 401 the morning service paragraph 54
[1:13:04] when a high priest when a man has
[1:13:06] finished his work he sits down when I
[1:13:09] quit preaching I sit down but not until
[1:13:11] I quit preaching when you're working
[1:13:14] when you're working when you sit down
[1:13:18] your work is finished Jesus sat down at
[1:13:20] the right hand of glory and when he seen
[1:13:24] his first martyr listen dying for the
[1:13:27] cause of Christ the resurrected Lord
[1:13:30] Jesus brushed back the skies he must
[1:13:35] raised from his
[1:13:38] throne to give a special welcome to
[1:13:41] little Steven to bring him
[1:13:46] home there he is raised from the dead
[1:13:50] his domain reaches from eternity to
[1:13:52] Eternity
[1:13:54] he is far above every Angel every
[1:13:57] principality everything there is in
[1:13:59] heaven why his Heavens his throne is far
[1:14:04] above the heavens of Heaven God raised
[1:14:06] him up
[1:14:08] right think on these things and just
[1:14:10] read them we're talking about something
[1:14:11] real is the point living dying buried
[1:14:14] Rising coming 1959
[1:14:17] 329 the s Service Rising he justified
[1:14:21] freely forever oh no one can never can
[1:14:24] never know can never think of that great
[1:14:26] day when he rose up and the angel saw it
[1:14:29] in the heavens of Heavens the Angels
[1:14:32] sang the Praises of God and rejoiced
[1:14:35] while the Old Testament Saints in
[1:14:36] Paradise shouted Hallelujah raising he
[1:14:40] justified the heaven shook the Earth
[1:14:42] shook Paradise Shook and Hell shook when
[1:14:44] that great voice come forth up from the
[1:14:47] grave he arose Rising he justified
[1:14:50] freely forever amen you understand
[1:14:53] understand what I'm getting
[1:14:54] at everything's under his command amen
[1:14:59] he controls
[1:15:01] everything images of Christ 1959 525 the
[1:15:09] e37 oh Lord God the creator of Heaven
[1:15:11] and Earth who brought again the Lord
[1:15:13] Jesus from the dead brought him from by
[1:15:16] him by the quickening spirit of the
[1:15:17] Eternal God brought up that body that
[1:15:20] you dwelt in and has raised it up to the
[1:15:22] throne of Heaven he come to the lowest
[1:15:25] that there was in the earth The
[1:15:28] Prostitute and become the lowest servant
[1:15:32] went to the lowest city dwelt with the
[1:15:34] lest people raised the lest raised the
[1:15:37] lowest name and become the poorest of
[1:15:39] all the poor even to Nature the birds
[1:15:42] had nest and the foxes had dens but the
[1:15:44] son of man had not a place to let his
[1:15:46] head and yet that quickening Spirit who
[1:15:49] honored that true servant that made
[1:15:52] himself a servant that we might have an
[1:15:54] example to go by it raised him up from
[1:15:57] the pits of Hell brought him by the
[1:16:00] grave and brought
[1:16:02] that body out and set it in heaven in
[1:16:05] the heavens of Heavens until he's
[1:16:08] exalted so high till he has to look down
[1:16:11] to see the heavens and give him a name
[1:16:13] that's above every name in heaven and in
[1:16:16] Earth do you understand what I'm saying
[1:16:22] yes
[1:16:24] the heavens of
[1:16:30] Heavens now where did Jesus take those
[1:16:34] Old Testament
[1:16:38] Saints you may argue with me on
[1:16:40] Dimensions or thoughts for a minute but
[1:16:42] that's it's all right I just have to
[1:16:43] speak what I
[1:16:47] believe we know that the prophet
[1:16:49] couldn't go into the seventh Dimension
[1:16:52] right
[1:16:54] all right because that would be dealing
[1:16:56] with immortality which means eternal
[1:16:59] life in human
[1:17:01] flesh so he could not Ascend there where
[1:17:03] did those Old Testament Saints
[1:17:06] Go did they raise in Mortal
[1:17:11] bodies or did they raise in
[1:17:14] theophany did they raise in some form
[1:17:18] other than total
[1:17:22] immortality because I'll remind you
[1:17:24] right if you're saying that Roose is in
[1:17:26] total immortality I'll remind you some
[1:17:29] statements brother Brandon said one
[1:17:32] day he said Adam would reach over and
[1:17:35] get
[1:17:37] Eve and said eve would reach over and
[1:17:40] get
[1:17:42] abble and able to get Seth right and
[1:17:46] said the resurrection would come
[1:17:50] right it does not say that all the Old
[1:17:52] Testament Saints came up with Jesus in
[1:17:55] the in his
[1:17:59] resurrection it only says
[1:18:01] some came up with him where did they go
[1:18:05] and what happened to
[1:18:09] them now if you make it mortal
[1:18:12] bodies you're going to have to take them
[1:18:17] into at least the seventh
[1:18:20] Dimension with Mortal bodies because
[1:18:23] Jesus could dwell
[1:18:26] there and and you got a problem because
[1:18:28] why couldn't brother brandom go higher
[1:18:30] than an Old Testament
[1:18:33] Saint
[1:18:35] right you're going to have to
[1:18:38] think maybe their bodies didn't come out
[1:18:41] of the
[1:18:42] Grave I know click computers just went
[1:18:46] to
[1:18:47] running but brother Dale brother Brandon
[1:18:49] said that that Abraham said we better
[1:18:51] get out of here we might be recognized
[1:18:53] there's quite a few hundred years
[1:18:55] between the time of Abraham and the
[1:18:58] Ascension that was brought up and
[1:19:00] Abraham the
[1:19:02] man they didn't have cameras to take
[1:19:06] pictures they didn't know what Abraham
[1:19:08] looked
[1:19:10] like it wouldn't have been that they
[1:19:13] would have been standing there looking
[1:19:14] and saying here's Abraham and SAR how
[1:19:18] would they
[1:19:20] know I just talk sensual
[1:19:25] M but cus being the high
[1:19:29] priest and a man subject to the spirit
[1:19:32] of
[1:19:33] God are any of those
[1:19:35] priests right subject to the spirit of
[1:19:38] God and the world of spiritual
[1:19:41] points and they saw something moving
[1:19:44] around they might have been able by
[1:19:46] their spiritual eye not a natural eye
[1:19:49] but by a spiritual eye been able to
[1:19:51] comprehend something was taking place
[1:19:55] and Abraham says we better get out of
[1:19:57] here we're being
[1:19:59] recognized not by Abraham and
[1:20:02] Sarah but by a spiritual
[1:20:05] condition those people were spiritual
[1:20:08] people back there The Witch of indor
[1:20:11] could call up the spirit of Samuel and
[1:20:13] she was a garbage
[1:20:15] can right but she had a
[1:20:18] gift see we get over on this side over
[1:20:21] here we're going to finally get round to
[1:20:23] preach on where the Prophet
[1:20:26] said gifts and callings the Bible and
[1:20:28] the prophet said are without repentance
[1:20:30] and you know gifts and callings are
[1:20:32] predestinated eternally now I listen
[1:20:35] I'll show you how technical brother R is
[1:20:37] in the same paragraph he says the nine
[1:20:40] spiritual gifts are not predestinated
[1:20:45] eternally that's how technical brother
[1:20:47] Rand is the nine spiritual gifts are not
[1:20:49] predestinated eternally sure but he said
[1:20:53] the fivefold ministry the
[1:20:55] gifts I ordained thee Jeremiah Prophet
[1:20:58] before the world ever
[1:21:00] begun we're going to break away from
[1:21:02] some of our sugar tit
[1:21:05] doctrines to look at something and see
[1:21:07] it in
[1:21:09] reality but wherever they went and
[1:21:12] whatever they done I like the scriptures
[1:21:14] don't you let's go to Psalms 24 and7
[1:21:17] just for a few
[1:21:18] moments I told you I'm not trying to
[1:21:21] disprove this about dementia this about
[1:21:23] that I'm trying to show us in the Bible
[1:21:25] eternal
[1:21:26] life and eternal life is a
[1:21:29] person amen this is where the psalmist
[1:21:32] strikes

[1:25:46] be able to run down
[1:25:47] through that Jesus could run down

[1:26:10] one day that's
[1:26:12] right somewhere in those Realms that we
[1:26:15] looked at a sixth to seventh Dimension
[1:26:17] and total eternity comes a position and
[1:26:21] existence but there's still got to be
[1:26:23] another Journey because there got to be
[1:26:24] a journey of mankind the bride of Christ
[1:26:27] there got to be a journey of these
[1:26:28] mortal bodies that will go up through
[1:26:30] those reals be Chang the moment the
[1:26:33] twinkling an eye yep and turn out to be
[1:26:36] Eternal in an eternal
[1:26:38] heaven so how's your Heaven is it
[1:26:41] getting a little bit more
[1:26:42] tangible
[1:26:44] right a little bit more than thinking
[1:26:46] that Elohim means self-existing so he
[1:26:49] just floting around
[1:26:53] we're going to get down to find out that
[1:26:54] he could have had billions of
[1:26:57] years of living with the
[1:27:00] angels before man or anything else was
[1:27:03] ever created that's
[1:27:09] F in heaven right cuz you better
[1:27:13] remember sin didn't originate on
[1:27:17] Earth that's right sin originated in
[1:27:20] heaven amen it's according to the
[1:27:23] prophet according to the Bible and there
[1:27:26] was a battle according to to Revelations
[1:27:28] 12 I believe it just right in there
[1:27:31] Michael and his angels is what I've
[1:27:32] always tried to tell
[1:27:35] you that fell the devil he just ain't
[1:27:37] never figured all this out
[1:27:39] yet is what I tried to tell you he
[1:27:42] believed he was the anointed Sher right
[1:27:45] right-hand man of God nobody between him
[1:27:49] and God that's right y and he was
[1:27:52] standing there one day
[1:27:54] and
[1:27:57] just out
[1:27:59] stepped
[1:28:04] Michel and Satan say where did he come
[1:28:07] from it's supposed to be him and
[1:28:10] me and I still see him and I see another
[1:28:14] is this getting close to a
[1:28:17] trinity now that was God in another form
[1:28:20] right that's right
[1:28:23] that was the fell Satan couldn't
[1:28:26] handle it wasn't a battle up there that
[1:28:29] they was fighting each
[1:28:31] other we'll find out that along about
[1:28:34] that time that Michael just speaks a
[1:28:35] world into existence and when Satan gets
[1:28:38] all upset and everything's going on and
[1:28:40] he can't handle
[1:28:42] it he's finally exposed what he's doing
[1:28:45] he says to the outer
[1:28:50] Darkness Michael just speaks the word in
[1:28:53] a way Satan has to go down to this world
[1:28:57] that's right y because this is Satan's
[1:29:01] domain that's right right that's why it
[1:29:05] started in
[1:29:07] darkness without form and
[1:29:12] void cuz Michael is Christ right right
[1:29:15] right he's not an Angel that's right
[1:29:18] he's call that in the Bible but he's not
[1:29:20] an
[1:29:20] angel
[1:29:28] Christ number
[1:29:30] 13 which is the mighty
[1:29:33] conqueror e27 1958

[1:30:19] the arch of The Old Rugged Cross went
[1:30:22] Jesus and the soldiers of the Old
[1:30:24] Testament right down through the streets

[1:33:55] about Beyond us is a
[1:33:59] reality Beyond us is more real than the
[1:34:02] existence we live
[1:34:04] in
[1:34:06] controlled by the Holy
[1:34:09] Spirit places that you and I can go and
[1:34:12] see around the land are

[1:35:19] will be done away past may I use it in
[1:35:22] the way I want to use it all of these
[1:35:24] Dimensions will pass away not be
[1:35:28] annihilated
[1:35:30] right they will change in
[1:35:34] form and pass away the world will still
