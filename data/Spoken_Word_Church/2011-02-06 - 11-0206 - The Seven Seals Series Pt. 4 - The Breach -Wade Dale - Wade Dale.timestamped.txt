[0:00] let's read that part
[0:02] luke 17.
[0:04] luke chapter 17.
[0:07] and here we go we're going to start at
[0:11] verse 20.
[0:13] what i want to do is
[0:15] get
[0:16] you to
[0:20] get you in into the part where the son
[0:23] of man is
[0:25] is something that you really
[0:28] i want you to think about
[0:30] because if you're born again today
[0:49] um
[1:00] i didn't hit paul no you're not gonna
[1:01] really need to steal a book today but i
[1:03] want you to
[1:05] get in the
[1:06] habit of bringing it
[1:08] okay it's kind of like when we were in
[1:10] football you know if you fumbled the
[1:12] week before guess what you did
[1:14] you carried the football the whole next
[1:16] week during class and everything
[1:20] never happened to me because i didn't
[1:21] care the football but
[1:23] apple did a lot of the quarterback
[1:27] and running back
[1:28] and if you remember you were in home ec
[1:31] they gave you a five pound bag of flour
[1:33] or whatever sugar
[1:36] that's what an egg
[1:49] that's what i want you to do in the
[1:50] steel book because it's going to be much
[1:51] more important than any egg or a bag of
[1:53] flour
[1:54] i hope
[1:56] so just get in habit of bringing it get
[1:58] in the habit of bringing the seal book
[2:00] and when we start reading in it you'll
[2:02] have it
[2:03] you won't fumble
[2:06] but we're going to start in the breach
[2:08] but i want to read this first because
[2:10] this is
[2:11] for background before
[2:13] we look at
[2:16] what we saw
[2:18] from the son of god to the son of man
[2:20] what we were doing down here and
[2:23] the son of god if you're born again
[2:24] today the son of god should not be a
[2:26] mystery to you that should be that new
[2:28] birth that's inside of you the one
[2:29] that's leading you and guiding you
[2:31] and
[2:32] bringing you
[2:34] revelation of the word correct right
[2:36] that's the son of god not to say that
[2:38] the son of god is not important but if
[2:40] you're born again you have the son of
[2:42] god
[2:43] all right
[2:44] you have the son of god revelation
[2:46] because it had to be revealed to you
[2:47] that you had that
[2:49] all right but the son of man is what the
[2:51] mystery is all right
[2:53] so now let's read luke 17 20
[2:58] and even scofield didn't pick this up
[3:00] but you know usually he says he shows
[3:02] you a reference point this does not
[3:04] reference matthew
[3:06] 24
[3:08] but it exactly is matthew 24 like what
[3:10] we were reading in a bible study
[3:13] last night
[3:14] all right because in matthew 24 and 25
[3:17] it says that uh if you say low christ is
[3:20] here
[3:22] and don't go because he's not there you
[3:24] understand what i'm saying so in luke
[3:26] watch what he says and when he was
[3:28] demanded of the pharisees when the
[3:29] kingdom of god should come he answered
[3:32] them and said the kingdom of god cometh
[3:34] not with observation
[3:36] neither shall they say lo here or lo
[3:39] there for behold the kingdom of god is
[3:41] within you
[3:42] that's the baptism of the holy ghost
[3:44] that's the son of god
[3:47] the new birth
[3:49] the creator god the one that was before
[3:51] the foundation of the world and that's
[3:53] what you have inside of you is in your
[3:55] birth
[3:56] it's a revelation of who that person is
[3:59] all right
[4:00] now
[4:01] jesus does not finish
[4:04] he continues
[4:06] and he said unto the disciples the days
[4:08] will come
[4:09] when you shall desire to see
[4:13] one
[4:16] see that one
[4:19] of the days of the son of man and you
[4:22] shall not see it
[4:24] now they didn't see it naturally because
[4:26] he knew they weren't going to live long
[4:27] enough to see it
[4:30] but spiritually
[4:32] let me just put it to you this way
[4:35] the son of man never went out of
[4:37] existence right
[4:40] because brother raham said it was son of
[4:41] god through the seven church ages well
[4:42] that doesn't say that the son of man was
[4:45] dead and gone somewhere else
[4:47] it was the revelation of that son of man
[4:49] was always there in the bible
[4:52] it always was in the teachings even of
[4:55] paul because what do we get the son of
[4:56] man revelation from what's in the bible
[4:59] but they didn't have the revelation to
[5:01] give to the people like this end time
[5:03] prophet did
[5:05] when he saw the revelation of the son of
[5:06] man when the son of man actually was
[5:09] made flesh
[5:10] right there in that man through that man
[5:12] now brother branham was not god
[5:15] he was a son of man revealing the son of
[5:17] man he was that trumpet he was the one
[5:19] that was giving the voice that or god
[5:21] was using his voice to get to me and you
[5:24] all right
[5:26] you will see what you shall desire
[5:29] to see one of the days of the son of man
[5:31] and you shall not see it
[5:33] why that flesh jesus christ ascended
[5:37] and he has not come back yet
[5:40] nobody understand that the son of god
[5:42] came back on the day of pentecost
[5:44] in the hearts of the people and it made
[5:46] god in human flesh
[5:47] right here just like we are now
[5:51] but there's a
[5:53] time that the son of man is going to
[5:54] come back in power in manifestation not
[5:57] that the son of man went somewhere on
[5:58] vacation and came back in the end time
[6:01] no it had to be we were talking about
[6:03] last night with somebody you know um
[6:05] teaching somebody how to
[6:08] to show that a prophet had to come in
[6:10] the end time
[6:12] there was a lot of mysteries that was
[6:14] not revealed you got baptist mystery
[6:16] methodist pentecost and all these things
[6:18] now and
[6:21] they were not made known as like i said
[6:23] we're not going to be we're not going to
[6:24] heaven with confusion someone had to
[6:26] come you had there had to be a prophet a
[6:29] word prophet come in the end time
[6:32] because luther came
[6:34] and and he did a little bit of work of
[6:38] restoring back
[6:39] because he brought faith back to the
[6:41] people
[6:42] back in the in the
[6:44] middle age or fourth age
[6:46] it was dark ages they put their faith in
[6:48] the catholic church
[6:51] do penance do this do that
[6:53] works exactly works so now here's martin
[6:56] luther bringing a group of people out
[6:59] that says we've got to live by faith
[7:01] well now
[7:02] that's what paul preached
[7:05] i live by the faith of the son of god
[7:08] so
[7:09] so so uh martin luther was bringing the
[7:12] people to a realization that
[7:14] they didn't need to do work they needed
[7:16] to have faith in god but now yet martin
[7:18] luther still had things about him that
[7:20] he had followed some holy ghost baptism
[7:22] i'm sure he was trinitarian
[7:24] he still had roman catholic ideas
[7:26] but god was using what that man
[7:29] to bring a group of people out to see
[7:32] part of the word well now that's
[7:34] restoring
[7:35] but it's reformation they call it
[7:37] reformation because it was reforming the
[7:39] people
[7:40] it is an act of restoration because it's
[7:42] bringing everything back up the trees
[7:44] growing back again all right
[7:47] two shoes
[7:48] but in martin luther's teachings he
[7:51] didn't tell the people not to smoke not
[7:53] to drink not to you know do the things
[7:56] that the catholic church does why he was
[7:58] reforming
[8:00] alcoholics known same thing that's
[8:02] reformation you're reforming somebody
[8:05] when you restore somebody back with
[8:07] which in
[8:08] in this day and time you can never do
[8:10] that
[8:12] unless you have the holy ghost right
[8:15] you can go to alcoholics anonymous and
[8:16] they'll tell you you are an alcoholic
[8:18] until the day you die that's what they
[8:20] tell you right right you're an alcoholic
[8:22] accept it
[8:23] realize you are and stay away from it
[8:25] well some do some don't that's
[8:27] reformation that's why martin luther
[8:29] could smoke a pipe and drink beer
[8:31] because he was reforming the people
[8:33] out of an age
[8:35] he was coming to do a part of
[8:36] restoration because it was restoring the
[8:38] people back but it didn't go to full
[8:40] restoration because it didn't restore
[8:42] the people back to
[8:44] gifts
[8:46] things of the flesh not to do
[8:47] sanctification stuff like that but god
[8:50] liked that that was what god wanted that
[8:52] was all the people could stand
[8:55] so he took martin luther
[8:57] birthed him into the body put a group of
[8:59] people in the ground and then raised up
[9:01] a man named
[9:02] john wesley
[9:04] now john wesley was also a reformer
[9:06] because he even said drinking tea
[9:09] was not
[9:10] profitable to your body so it was a sin
[9:12] so he told about what drinking tea well
[9:14] see that's reformation you can't get
[9:15] that out of restoration that's
[9:17] reformation that's reforming that's
[9:19] alcoholics anonymous
[9:21] but yet they had the new birth for their
[9:22] time all right
[9:24] but see if if you take and restore
[9:27] somebody
[9:28] see that means you take
[9:30] this
[9:32] is original
[9:35] and during the ages or during a certain
[9:37] length of time
[9:38] it got put to this well it's still the
[9:41] same
[9:42] twist height
[9:44] all right
[9:45] but something's happened to it
[9:49] so i'm going to reform it
[9:52] that's reform because it never went
[9:53] anywhere but now what is what is this
[9:57] that's restored back to its original
[9:59] condition
[10:00] so i want you to get reformation and
[10:02] restoration the difference in
[10:03] reformation to reform somebody is they
[10:06] might do it again right
[10:08] martin luther could smoke a pipe and
[10:10] drink a beer and
[10:11] and do the things like that and and
[10:14] still be a son of god but be a son of
[10:16] god
[10:17] in his time right
[10:20] that's right like that
[10:23] but he was still like that
[10:25] okay
[10:27] excuse me i think what you're saying is
[10:30] you restore something through
[10:32] reformation
[10:35] when you reform something it's going in
[10:37] stages right
[10:38] to restoration which is the final
[10:41] project you had to have reformation
[10:44] reformation is not bad you know brother
[10:46] branham saying well they were just
[10:47] reformers the reason they were reformers
[10:50] they weren't word prophets if they were
[10:52] word prophets as soon as that word
[10:54] struck their heart
[10:56] it would have be and then with the holy
[10:57] ghost it would have said baptism in the
[10:59] name of jesus christ no eternal hell no
[11:02] trinity but it didn't martin luther was
[11:05] coming through reformation he was
[11:06] reforming the people but it was an act
[11:09] of restoration because what do you do
[11:11] when you put
[11:13] in matthew or john where it says the
[11:15] seed must go on the ground
[11:17] if it doesn't die to buy it alone
[11:19] well now did he come back up and look
[11:21] like a
[11:22] corn no
[11:24] started out with two little things that
[11:26] didn't even look like the seed two
[11:28] little green shoots sticking up
[11:30] but somewhere in those two little green
[11:32] shoots was the life of that seed that
[11:33] you planted
[11:35] when jesus planted that seed on the day
[11:36] of pentecost that was the life
[11:40] but see he said it has to go back to
[11:41] that original grain not the whole plant
[11:44] right
[11:45] so now you got
[11:46] martin luther
[11:48] john wesley
[11:50] all right the stalk coming up what are
[11:52] you doing you're still reforming people
[11:54] right
[11:54] now we drink tea
[11:56] if martin luther i mean if john wesley
[11:58] would have seen us drinking tea to keep
[12:00] us out of the church
[12:01] that's reformation right that's
[12:03] reforming somebody right
[12:05] but when brother branham came the holy
[12:06] ghost came on the day of pentecost to
[12:08] restore the gifts
[12:09] that give a platform for the prophet to
[12:11] step out on what if brother branham
[12:14] would have came in right at the end of
[12:15] wesley's age when we were still riding
[12:17] horses and and brother branham comes on
[12:20] the scene and he starts blasting no
[12:21] eternal hell and
[12:23] and all the things that he was he was
[12:24] preaching
[12:26] people couldn't stand it but you had
[12:29] reforming
[12:31] joshua led by faith
[12:33] let's all live a sanctified life
[12:35] oh now we've got a holy ghost here and
[12:38] we're speaking in tongues we're doing
[12:39] just like the book of acts said
[12:42] to a degree they still had fathers and
[12:44] holy ghost baptism that's why they were
[12:45] still reforming
[12:48] but see when the grain comes back again
[12:50] that's what had to come back was the
[12:52] grain had to come back
[12:54] then that was what went in the ground
[12:58] which was
[13:00] restoration
[13:01] restoring it back to its original
[13:03] condition and that's what brother
[13:05] branham did from 47 to 63. he brought a
[13:09] restoration back to the original word
[13:13] got all the loose ends tied together and
[13:15] then like we were talking about a few
[13:17] weeks ago then he brought the son of man
[13:19] message not to say the son of man wasn't
[13:21] in there because he talked to the son of
[13:22] man even back in the 50s
[13:24] he said in the beginning was the word
[13:26] words with god and he said that was son
[13:27] of man that was the son of man
[13:30] would not cut our hair and wear dresses
[13:33] and that kind of thing would that be
[13:34] reforming
[13:36] that would be that would be reforming if
[13:38] you did it
[13:39] because you had to right
[13:42] alcoholics anonymous says if you don't
[13:44] drink
[13:45] you'll be okay
[13:47] but now restoration is i was a drunk one
[13:49] time which i wasn't but i cheated
[13:53] all my life from 14 years old to
[13:58] until i was 39.
[14:03] every day my life
[14:05] but when the lord brought me to a state
[14:07] of sanctification
[14:10] it was from one day to the next day
[14:13] and i've never wanted it again sure boy
[14:15] it smells good sometimes
[14:17] that's the old flesh man right right
[14:19] that's right see we're still we're still
[14:21] trying to restore this guy
[14:23] the restoration is what was inside but
[14:25] see it keeps this outside guy under
[14:27] control right all right and that's
[14:29] what's happened down through the ages is
[14:31] that thing inside of you called the holy
[14:33] ghost i can call it a thing because the
[14:34] bible called it a thing
[14:36] he told mary he said that thing in you
[14:39] and be conceived of the holy ghost all
[14:40] right that's what's keeping you clean
[14:44] but it did not take away the sin curse
[14:46] right
[14:47] because you're still dying right we're
[14:48] still getting older things we got
[14:50] problems and things are going on we're
[14:51] still putting people in the grave
[14:54] that was under the sun god dispensation
[14:56] people are going to still die just like
[14:58] we said before right
[14:59] but somebody had to come back and preach
[15:01] a message and show that god was coming
[15:04] back in human flesh again
[15:06] not by himself but in a group of people
[15:09] he's had a bride
[15:10] but from 47 to 63 that's what brother
[15:13] branham was trying to get us back to
[15:14] where paul said
[15:17] the life that i now live i live by the
[15:18] faith of the son of god that's what he
[15:20] was trying to get everybody back to
[15:23] and then he had a message to bring
[15:25] past that right all right so let's
[15:27] listen
[15:29] to that
[15:30] do i thank god they didn't reform that
[15:33] that's right because we wouldn't have
[15:34] been
[15:35] restored
[15:36] thank god they didn't restore back then
[15:38] yes if they didn't if they had restored
[15:40] back in the when the holy ghost fell see
[15:42] because the holy ghost fell
[15:45] on a group of trinitarians
[15:49] so that wasn't full restoration right
[15:52] even f f bosworth one of the greatest
[15:54] brother brown called him the greatest
[15:56] faith healer of his time
[15:59] he never saw the message of the hour he
[16:01] was under that age of coming out of that
[16:04] holy ghost 1906 through the street
[16:06] and he was a faith healer
[16:10] to a degree that was you know
[16:13] rivaling brother branham i would say but
[16:14] he was not a word prophet
[16:17] he was he was he took the word of god
[16:19] and he lived it the best he could
[16:22] the son of god lived through him and did
[16:24] the healing
[16:25] everybody understand that but he never
[16:27] accepted the message he never said he
[16:30] was still a trinitarian he's still
[16:31] baptized as far as i know
[16:33] in the name of father son holy ghost see
[16:35] so that was back in that time
[16:37] when that was happening and brother
[16:39] branham was trying to get him out of
[16:40] that or hit god through brother branham
[16:42] not brother branham but god through him
[16:44] was trying to get him to a place
[16:46] to restore back just to the faith of the
[16:48] fathers down at that bottom that's why i
[16:50] said we read malachi 4.
[16:52] but there's something else because
[16:53] remember we read then matthew 17 where
[16:55] the son of man has to be risen again
[16:58] son of man rose 2 000 years ago on
[17:00] easter sunday
[17:02] we didn't nobody killed him except we
[17:04] killed the effects of him doing anything
[17:06] in during the church ages
[17:09] as the son of man all right
[17:11] but now at the end time with the word
[17:12] fully restored back and then christ
[17:14] coming down in revelation 10 7 just like
[17:16] he promised he would and he would take
[17:18] all the mysteries and time all together
[17:21] and listen
[17:24] this is god in simplicity this is the
[17:26] simplest form that god will ever be in
[17:30] is right now because he said you won't
[17:33] see me no more
[17:35] the world
[17:36] he said but you'll see
[17:39] because i'll be with you even in you to
[17:41] the end of the world that's the son of
[17:42] god but the son of man has to come back
[17:44] in power
[17:47] in the end time everybody's saying so
[17:48] man son of man and son of man well let's
[17:50] see
[17:51] verse 22
[17:54] and he said a disciple
[17:56] the days will come
[17:58] when you shall desire to see one of the
[18:00] days of the son of man and he shall not
[18:02] and ye shall not see it
[18:05] all the way through the church ages you
[18:07] know he said
[18:09] and you shall and they shall say to you
[18:12] see here or see there go not after them
[18:15] or follow them
[18:16] for as the lightning that lighteth out
[18:18] of the one part under heaven remember we
[18:20] read that last night
[18:22] the bible says the light and come from
[18:24] the east to the west so shall the son of
[18:25] man well what did son of man start he
[18:27] started in what jerusalem the east
[18:29] where'd he end up in the west
[18:31] brother brown said he went all the way
[18:33] around cities at the west coast now
[18:35] which was california
[18:36] he's going to china now in our time and
[18:38] brother brown said he had to end back up
[18:40] in what the east again right
[18:43] because they're going to see this
[18:45] they're going to see the son of man one
[18:47] day the whole world is they're going to
[18:48] see jesus christ
[18:50] in human flesh
[18:52] but they're going to see him in judgment
[18:54] that's not going to be
[18:55] what they think it's going to be because
[18:56] they're going to miss the coming that
[18:58] we're talking about right now
[19:01] for as the light the lightning that
[19:03] lighteth out into one part under heaven
[19:05] shineth unto the other part under heaven
[19:07] so shall also the son of man be in his
[19:10] day but first
[19:12] must he suffer many things and be
[19:14] rejected of this generation what was he
[19:15] saying
[19:16] that's when the first son of man is
[19:18] going to be buried going to be put down
[19:20] right there
[19:21] he was the son of
[19:22] man he was the son of man with the son
[19:25] of man ministry standing on earth right
[19:27] there
[19:30] but he told them that though
[19:32] when the son of man raises again so
[19:34] there's another part coming
[19:37] and as it was in the days of noah so
[19:39] shall also be in the days of the son of
[19:41] man what did they do
[19:43] they did eat drink they married wives
[19:46] plural
[19:47] wives
[19:48] marriage and divorce
[19:51] many wives they don't mean polygamy so
[19:53] much that means they married and given
[19:55] and married married married married
[19:57] divorced married and divorced
[19:59] they were given in marriage until the
[20:00] day that noah entered into the ark and
[20:02] the flood came and destroyed them all
[20:04] likewise also as it was in the days of
[20:07] lot
[20:08] they did eat they drank they bought they
[20:10] sold they planted they builded but the
[20:12] same day that lot went out of sodom
[20:14] it rained fire brimstone from heaven and
[20:16] destroyed them all even thus shall it be
[20:18] in the day when the son of man is
[20:21] revealed
[20:23] we know for a fact he was not revealed
[20:25] back then they did not know who that man
[20:27] was
[20:29] oh peter said thou art the christ the
[20:30] son of the living
[20:32] god all right they knew god was inside
[20:35] that man but they did not know who that
[20:37] son of man was
[20:39] in that day he which shall be upon the
[20:42] house top and his stuff on the house let
[20:43] him not come down to take it away
[20:46] and he that's in the field let him
[20:47] likewise not return back
[20:49] remember lot's wife whosoever shall seek
[20:52] to save his life shall lose it
[20:55] talk about us and whosoever shall lose
[20:57] his life shall preserve it
[20:59] i tell you in that
[21:01] night there shall be two men in one bed
[21:04] the one she'll be taking the other one
[21:05] she'll be left what's he talking about
[21:06] let's talk to resurrection or talk about
[21:08] the rapture i mean all right
[21:10] two women shall be grinding together one
[21:12] be taken one left two men should be in
[21:14] the field one taking one left and the
[21:16] answer to send it to him where lord
[21:20] where is this going to happen
[21:22] and he said unto them wheresoever the
[21:24] body is
[21:26] neither will the eagles be gathered
[21:28] together
[21:29] just like it's when the carcass is
[21:31] getting like we read last night this is
[21:32] the same
[21:33] this is the same scenario if you look in
[21:35] the bible matthew mark luke and john
[21:37] doesn't always put everything in order
[21:39] together the same one's got one view of
[21:41] a different thing luke this is exactly
[21:44] what we read last night in matthew 24
[21:45] and 25
[21:47] exact same thing
[21:48] but this was luke's interpretation of it
[21:50] more of the man intelligence
[21:53] of whatsoever the body is
[21:55] whatever the carcass is there shall the
[21:57] eagle be together now like daddy said
[21:59] and that's true you take scripture has
[22:01] different meaning that scripture means
[22:03] when everybody's killed and the
[22:04] carcasses are laying dead all over the
[22:05] ground the eagles or vultures are going
[22:07] to eat them up
[22:09] but in a spiritual sense since the son
[22:11] of man is coming back in this day
[22:13] wheresoever the word carcast the word
[22:17] whatsoever the body
[22:19] is
[22:21] this will the eagles be gathered
[22:22] together
[22:24] all right so that one this one wants you
[22:26] to see that the son of man
[22:30] was on the earth at one time
[22:33] he died ascended
[22:34] sent the holy ghost back on the day of
[22:36] pentecost as the son of god
[22:39] to give the people the holy ghost you
[22:41] don't see him again he said you'll see
[22:42] me no more
[22:44] but you'll see me again in the end time
[22:46] all right
[22:47] like in matthew will the son of man be
[22:49] risen again now let's go to revelation
[22:51] 5.
[22:58] well you know whoever hears this or sees
[23:00] this or all you people sitting here i
[23:01] want you to understand one thing
[23:03] 90 of the people in this message do not
[23:06] understand they cry son of man solomon
[23:08] they do not understand who some man is
[23:10] they do not understand why he had to
[23:12] come they do not they just say he's here
[23:19] i don't think
[23:20] so he's got to come in revelation first
[23:25] then he comes back to get a group of
[23:26] people
[23:29] truthfully
[23:31] truthfully
[23:33] we're not going to see him
[23:35] until we see him in the air that's right
[23:37] the son of man the physical
[23:40] that's right
[23:41] flesh
[23:42] one you can touch
[23:44] because he's going to be where
[23:45] in you and i
[23:47] because we have to be
[23:49] bone of his bone
[23:51] flesh of his flesh sure we're married to
[23:54] him by the son of god ministry we're
[23:56] married to him by the holy ghost that's
[23:58] inside of us but he doesn't only just
[24:00] want that
[24:03] like sister trudy was was talking
[24:06] we were talking just a minute ago
[24:10] when god took that book we were talking
[24:13] about this book here in revelation just
[24:14] for a second
[24:16] when god took that book back
[24:18] from adam
[24:20] satan came down and he was brother brown
[24:23] said he was a squatter
[24:26] he had a right to your body because it
[24:28] fell he caused it he interjected himself
[24:31] into the human
[24:34] race
[24:36] through this
[24:38] through the beast
[24:40] he interjected his seed into the human
[24:42] race
[24:43] not his natural seed because look people
[24:45] satan don't have a seed
[24:46] satan cannot reproduce itself right he
[24:49] has no power right he has no life
[24:52] he had to go into god's laboratory break
[24:55] into the god's laboratory and see that
[24:57] well if
[24:59] this goes here
[25:01] god will have to give it life
[25:03] so he took that beast which he knew he
[25:05] was a master scientist himself
[25:09] closest to god
[25:10] right he wasn't a dummy closest man to
[25:13] god there is
[25:14] still is
[25:15] that's right
[25:17] he knew that seed would mingle with her
[25:19] seed
[25:20] so he got that beast to do what he could
[25:22] and he knew god had to give it life
[25:24] because remember brother brown everybody
[25:25] says well uh the bible says i got a man
[25:27] from the lord
[25:29] brother ramsay sure the lord's only one
[25:31] that can give life satan knew that
[25:33] satan took god's word
[25:37] kind of deep satan took god's word and
[25:40] made it work right see that's what
[25:42] they're doing now
[25:44] that's what anointing one's at the end
[25:45] time is doing they're taking god's word
[25:48] and making it work but yet they're the
[25:50] devil that's right because they've never
[25:52] been born again on the inside
[25:54] faults
[25:55] anointed one
[25:57] they're false but the anointing has to
[25:59] be true because if you get healed it's
[26:00] got to be from god you cannot believe
[26:02] right but he entered into god's
[26:04] laboratory
[26:05] saw that and knew if he could get
[26:07] energetic himself that he could take a
[26:09] claim on this right here
[26:12] and then by the nature of the fall he
[26:14] could get into you and cause you to do
[26:16] things that were wrong
[26:18] then he knew that god would have to
[26:20] judge you
[26:21] that's not a dummy but he thinks he can
[26:24] get enough on his side
[26:27] of this or whatever
[26:30] to defeat god because that's what maybe
[26:32] he wanted a better kingdom than michael
[26:33] and he still does he didn't he didn't
[26:35] stop because he got beat you know the
[26:37] first time
[26:39] but here in revelations 5 we see a book
[26:43] that book come from
[26:45] god almighty
[26:47] it was a book of names
[26:49] it was the bible
[26:52] all right everybody understand that
[26:54] book of life book of names all right
[26:58] and it was sealed up
[27:01] now
[27:03] you're going to hear maybe it sounds a
[27:05] little contradictory but this bible
[27:07] wasn't sealed up
[27:09] to the degree that man didn't know
[27:11] anything
[27:13] when man opened this book god opened
[27:15] their eyes to certain things right
[27:18] because the book wasn't sealed and
[27:19] nobody knew nothing until the end time
[27:20] that's what a lot of people think in the
[27:22] message that martin luther didn't have
[27:23] anything wesley didn't have anything
[27:25] because the book was stealing
[27:26] the book was sealed
[27:29] but man could open the physical book
[27:32] and by being born again the holy ghost
[27:34] inside of them could coincide with the
[27:35] part of the word that they could see for
[27:36] their time
[27:38] so they can open the book right
[27:40] you know we can physically open this
[27:42] book and still be clothed that's right
[27:44] right that's right we can physically
[27:46] read this book you many people in
[27:48] denominations they're reading this book
[27:50] now they're going to baptize people
[27:51] hundreds of them probably today in the
[27:53] name of father song holy ghost they're
[27:54] going to get it out of this open book
[27:56] right
[27:57] physically open book
[27:59] but spiritually it's close to their eyes
[28:01] they can't see the part that they're
[28:03] supposed to see all right so let's not
[28:05] see that when this book is closed and
[28:07] then it's open that is something that's
[28:08] physical and everybody's going to be
[28:10] able to see
[28:12] the only time every eye is going to
[28:13] behold is when when he comes in judgment
[28:16] that's the only time everybody's going
[28:18] to see him every knee is going to bow
[28:19] every tongue is going to confess that's
[28:21] way over there away from from from what
[28:24] we're talking about here all right
[28:26] so now why
[28:28] why was there no rapture in the other
[28:30] ages
[28:32] because the son of man ministry was not
[28:33] there
[28:35] the ability
[28:37] for man to have a body
[28:40] that can be
[28:42] restored not reformed
[28:47] because you can you can reform your body
[28:49] you can make your body that people make
[28:50] their body every day do things
[28:52] right right that's right i mean
[28:55] but that's reformation
[28:57] see to restore me back to my original
[28:59] condition
[29:00] when the book was in the hands of the
[29:02] one that was supposed to brought me
[29:04] out
[29:06] adam
[29:08] that's been lost
[29:09] right
[29:10] and then we've worked in permissive well
[29:12] now that's right god's permitted these
[29:14] bodies to come
[29:16] he had to because he said let every seed
[29:19] bring forth of his kind and there was no
[29:21] way he could take that back once he said
[29:23] it see once he said it satan heard that
[29:25] and said
[29:26] hmm
[29:27] that seed will mix with that one all
[29:29] right
[29:30] and i'll get in the human race right
[29:32] there
[29:32] well god knew that but still it's the
[29:34] perfect plan that's right well that's it
[29:37] still everything's gonna bring forth his
[29:39] kind
[29:40] spiritual or natural
[29:42] right all right
[29:44] so that part that god had for adam to
[29:48] bring us
[29:49] into the world
[29:51] with a flesh body
[29:53] put that genesis 126 man in there
[29:56] and us live eternally our bodies
[29:58] becoming eternal somehow somewhere
[30:00] adam's body wasn't even eternal it was
[30:02] just being renewed every day
[30:04] what the prophet said
[30:07] we must believe that you can't explain
[30:09] it
[30:10] just believe it
[30:12] because we're not going back to that
[30:13] condition that's right
[30:16] we're going back to the condition where
[30:17] that that body wasn't brought out of the
[30:19] womb of a woman
[30:21] because that genesis 1 26 was not
[30:23] brought out of the womb of a woman
[30:25] he said multiply and replenish before
[30:27] they were ever put in a human body
[30:31] spiritual multiplication that's right
[30:33] the spoken word is original seed that's
[30:35] what brother brown really started seeing
[30:37] i believe when what his message was all
[30:39] about
[30:39] in the spoken words regional city
[30:41] because when when you know the angel
[30:43] said as of yet malcolm 4 hasn't been
[30:45] made known in you then something was
[30:47] coming that was more or greater or
[30:49] better
[30:51] than what he had preached before all
[30:53] right
[30:54] but to fully restore somebody back you
[30:56] got to have the ability to get back to
[30:58] restoration restore
[31:03] i will restore i won't reform
[31:07] reform is going to happen
[31:10] but i will restore the years that all
[31:12] this thing happened and then we're going
[31:14] to be restored back to a garden of eden
[31:16] conditions so let's read just a few
[31:17] verses and then we'll
[31:20] just a few minutes
[31:22] and i saw in the right hand of him that
[31:24] sat on the throne a book written within
[31:26] and on the back side sealed with seven
[31:27] seals
[31:29] all right
[31:31] and i saw a strong angel proclaim with a
[31:33] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[31:35] book
[31:36] and to loose the seals thereof
[31:40] now what now
[31:42] is the importance of
[31:45] the seal
[31:47] john was standing there if you'll read
[31:50] your
[31:51] breach
[31:54] john the baptist john john the revelator
[31:56] was standing there with the holy ghost
[32:00] in his soul
[32:02] knew he was an eternal creature that's
[32:04] right he didn't have the holy ghost
[32:06] that was 1890
[32:08] he got the holy ghost in 80 30 because
[32:10] he was in the upper room
[32:12] he had to hold those for 60 years
[32:15] he's probably 80 or something years old
[32:16] you know he was a little bitty boy when
[32:18] when jesus brought him into
[32:20] into the uh
[32:21] the disciple
[32:24] here he is in his old age
[32:27] and in verse four
[32:28] he's weeping
[32:31] wife's done weeping he's born again he's
[32:33] going to heaven
[32:36] he's got it made pretty much
[32:39] i mean just in human terms he's
[32:41] he got a free ticket if you're born
[32:42] again today you got a free ticket
[32:45] you may have to die
[32:46] that's true but you got a free ticket to
[32:48] heaven if you're born again
[32:50] why do we strive for the rest of this
[32:54] and i saw a strong angel proclaim with a
[32:56] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[32:57] book and to loose the seals thereof
[33:00] and no man
[33:02] now if you're reading your book brother
[33:03] brown said there was michael was there
[33:05] gabriel was there
[33:08] he said but it took a man
[33:10] not an angel
[33:12] took a man
[33:16] and no man in heaven or in earth neither
[33:18] under the earth was able to open the
[33:20] book neither to look there on
[33:22] right and i wept much
[33:26] because no man was found worthy to open
[33:28] and read the book neither to look their
[33:31] own
[33:33] brother around said all the prophets
[33:34] were there
[33:36] so it's going to take something mightier
[33:37] than just a prophet
[33:41] but why was john weeping
[33:45] why was he weeping he was a born-again
[33:47] believer
[33:49] he was seeing
[33:51] things he'd never seen before he was
[33:53] writing things that he that man had
[33:55] never seen before why was john crying
[34:00] you ever thought of that
[34:03] now this is the breach the breach is
[34:05] between the church ages and the seals
[34:07] bringing out of the church ages
[34:09] because in the church ages is the son of
[34:10] god ministry right
[34:13] so we had to come out of the son of god
[34:15] ministry out of the church ages there
[34:16] had to be a breach to show
[34:19] what happened
[34:21] all right
[34:22] because i always look at it this way
[34:24] revelations 4 brother brown said the
[34:25] bribe goes out in revelations 4 and i'll
[34:27] see you in revelation 19. right
[34:30] but now in a spiritual aspect we get
[34:31] everything in between right in
[34:33] revelations 4 we went in a rapture
[34:36] and in heaven this is what we're going
[34:37] to see
[34:38] just what four describes that's the
[34:40] first thing i believe we're going to see
[34:41] when we get in heaven right
[34:43] now
[34:45] verse
[34:46] 5 he's going to tell us how we got there
[34:52] because in revelation 5 if revelation 5
[34:54] don't come into view
[34:56] if if somebody doesn't stand on this
[34:58] earth and take a body change
[35:01] none of this is going to happen
[35:03] but since it's already been written
[35:05] somebody's going to come to it and it's
[35:07] going to happen that's right so we just
[35:08] got to believe that besides okay all
[35:10] right
[35:11] but in revelations 5 we see how it
[35:14] happened
[35:15] why was john weeping
[35:17] verse five and one of the elders senator
[35:19] me weep not
[35:21] behold the line of the tribe of jude in
[35:23] other words one of them
[35:25] was worthy
[35:27] to not just loose the bands of satan on
[35:31] your soul
[35:32] because john had already been loosed
[35:34] from that
[35:35] john had been loosed from the bands of
[35:37] satan in his soul
[35:38] but john knew if somebody didn't take a
[35:40] body change none of this was going to
[35:42] happen that was in that part we're going
[35:44] to see next sunday because we need to go
[35:47] we'll see how john
[35:49] i believe he saw a little something we
[35:51] got to read between the lines
[35:54] just keep reading revelation 5 and keep
[35:56] reading the breach about three weeks i
[35:58] should ask everybody next week everybody
[36:00] hold their hand up
