[0:00] with us this morning he made it thank
[0:04] you for taking over last Sunday and we
[0:10] are going to continue all in Hebrews
[0:13] that brotherly love continue we not
[0:16] forgetful to entertain strangers for
[0:18] thereby some have entertained angels
[0:19] unawares like said before if we if we
[0:26] could see what was going on in the other
[0:29] dimension and a lot more busy than this
[0:32] one we think we're busy angels are doing
[0:36] things for us and with us and helping us
[0:39] I love it brother Browne said when you
[0:42] know believer has an angel you get from
[0:45] birth that's your predestined there an
[0:46] angel it's that's that's somebody there
[0:50] with you know who you think well words
[0:52] of that sometimes when that's not your
[0:53] Savior it's just I don't all right
[0:56] remember them there in bonds as bound
[0:59] with them and then which suffer
[1:03] adversity is being yourself hopeful in
[1:05] the body so in other words don't
[1:08] disclose people and you know you say
[1:11] well we saw one so it's going through a
[1:13] hard time well you know kinda maybe
[1:15] enter in with them a little bit you know
[1:17] tell them that I'm going back to me
[1:18] praying for them it's good a comfort
[1:19] about Lancome oh right just enter in and
[1:23] say God whatever they going through its
[1:26] an adversity in if there's a child of
[1:28] yours and then they'll accept it we've
[1:30] all been through it we've all gone
[1:31] through it we all still going through it
[1:33] adversity because we're all one body of
[1:36] Christ you can't kick the you can't keep
[1:38] the baby out with the bathwater you know
[1:41] it old saying domain well you can't take
[1:43] a little baby in Christ and you just you
[1:46] know acting like a baby
[1:47] but if there's a baby if they're born
[1:49] again be careful you may entertain
[1:55] angels unaware than the entertainment
[1:57] may not be the good part you know so
[2:00] let's just be careful let's be mindful
[2:02] of the whole body of Christ that's
[2:04] booked up that's what I wanted to see
[2:07] and all these different things at work
[2:08] that we're doing now specially for the
[2:10] youth and different ones we need we need
[2:14] to we have diversity as far as adversity
[2:17] we have diversity in the body many
[2:20] different members and different parts so
[2:22] we need to be we need to be especially
[2:24] now my brother date I mean I know he
[2:28] don't mind me telling he said he breezed
[2:30] a lot of fruit during his time of trying
[2:33] to witness to people a lot of times you
[2:37] witnessed with with a joke oh you know
[2:40] that's the minute not good tender hands
[2:45] and nail scarred hands and but now
[2:48] there's a big difference in that and
[2:50] then talking to somebody's been in the
[2:51] message twenty years but then even have
[2:53] a chokehold everyone all right get their
[2:56] attention remember like god yes I think
[3:00] marriage is honorable in all and the bed
[3:02] undefiled but whoremongers and
[3:04] adulterers God will judge all right let
[3:07] your conversation is just will be we
[3:09] wrap couple son just go let your
[3:13] conversation be without covetousness and
[3:16] be content with such things as you have
[3:19] where you guys said I will never leave
[3:21] thee nor forsake thee now do we really
[3:24] really believe that be content with such
[3:30] things as you have whether Bible you
[3:33] know the Bible comes in the Ten
[3:36] Commandments this is don't covet thy
[3:37] neighbor don't covet two things in your
[3:40] neighbor I'm it's nice to have a good
[3:42] thing
[3:42] tonight but don't try to compete when
[3:45] your neighbor and all the other stuff
[3:46] you know actually be them their worldly
[3:49] people you sure don't want to you want
[3:51] to just be contempt alright be content
[3:54] with what you got doesn't mean that you
[3:57] need to just sit home and not do nothing
[3:58] no that's not what that means you be
[4:02] content with what you got four he said I
[4:04] will never leave thee nor forsake thing
[4:06] so that we may boldly say the Lord is my
[4:09] helper and I will not fear what men
[4:12] shall do then to me and for all ought to
[4:16] know that very well
[4:18] while the persecution that that he went
[4:21] through and even to be so bold as to
[4:25] tell people that you'll be judged by my
[4:26] gospel I am sure they people hated him
[4:29] for that but you know what it's the
[4:31] truth and will be judged by all the
[4:34] gospel is preached to us and here in the
[4:36] end time we don't have an excuse we've
[4:38] got an open book so we've got all 66 66
[4:43] books and everything else in between so
[4:46] we don't have an execute that's why more
[4:48] is given more it's required remember
[4:51] them which have the rule over you that's
[4:53] spoken unto you the Word of God they
[4:55] space follow considering the end of
[4:57] their conversation considering the end
[4:59] of their conversation not too little or
[5:02] the outcome of their what conversation
[5:05] or what they say they're kind of right
[5:10] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[5:12] and forever is be now carried about with
[5:17] divers or meaning strange doctrines what
[5:20] is the good thing that the heart be
[5:21] established with grace not with meats I
[5:24] feel asleep things not with food which
[5:29] have not profited them they have
[5:30] occupied therein in other words he's not
[5:33] talking about food there I don't think
[5:34] he's talking about spiritual food be not
[5:37] carried away with meaning strange
[5:38] talking for
[5:39] is a good thing that the heart be
[5:40] established with grace not with meats
[5:43] are not with stuff that you should eat
[5:47] which have not profited them that have
[5:50] been occupied therein and you see that
[5:54] in the message to light you see in
[5:55] different places you see that there's a
[5:57] lot of things going on in different
[6:01] places that what is it property you need
[6:04] to look at that consider the end of the
[6:06] conversation right we have an altar
[6:10] where I'm they have no right to eat with
[6:13] serve the tabernacle but the bodies of
[6:16] those beasts whose blood is brought into
[6:18] the sanctuary by the high priests
[6:19] percent or burned without the camp
[6:21] wherefore jesus also that he might
[6:23] sanctify the people with his own blood
[6:25] suffered without the gate and we know
[6:27] that he wasn't crucified in Jerusalem
[6:29] they took him outside the city
[6:31] and home to Golgotha and they crucified
[6:33] him there because of their share of a
[6:35] good stuff excuse me the offering in the
[6:39] Old Testament was not killed inside the
[6:41] Holy of Holies they knew that it was
[6:44] killed outside and then brought in same
[6:46] way with Christ he was killed outside
[6:48] the gate brought in to the city I mean
[6:52] not his body but he come back into the
[6:54] city when he resurrected he took away
[6:57] all of them I think that's what Paul's
[6:59] trying to tell me these beasts and all
[7:03] that you've got your Tabernacle kind of
[7:04] like what we're talking about 144,000
[7:06] Paul's trying because remember he's
[7:08] intertwining with the Jews he's been
[7:10] he's been a sacrifice to God with his
[7:12] life you know done the sacrificing and
[7:16] maybe him not being a high priest but he
[7:17] sure depended on that high priest every
[7:20] year to go behind the veil and and get
[7:22] his sins forgiven now he was trying to
[7:24] tell them hey you gonna need to do that
[7:25] it needs to be Jesus Christ the same
[7:27] yesterday today and forever he's a man
[7:29] we're for Jesus that he might sanctify
[7:31] the people with his own blood suffered
[7:32] without the gate let us dare go forth
[7:36] therefore unto him without the camp
[7:37] bearing his reproach that's thinking
[7:42] yesterday
[7:44] we look at the we look at the nominal
[7:48] world and some of them are trying real
[7:51] hard but well I tell you the true gospel
[7:54] is just i we were at meal camp yesterday
[7:58] and there was this boot that had this
[8:02] great big sign that says do you know the
[8:05] Bible remember when we walked right when
[8:08] he handed me a car and he said it looks
[8:11] like you all know the Bible or something
[8:12] because he's no well read let's knock
[8:14] y'all well read in the Bible lesson I
[8:17] never said a word
[8:18] didn't Jim was there with address and
[8:21] you know and a lone pair that thing but
[8:23] I wanted to stop and say well let's talk
[8:25] about act 2:38 for a minute cuz he has
[8:27] the wrong time to do it that you don't
[8:28] want to bridge fruit make a scene but we
[8:32] have to one of my saying we are a
[8:34] selected people that have been called
[8:36] out of all that we were all caught up in
[8:39] denominationalism and all the different
[8:41] things that we come through but we've
[8:43] been called out of that without the camp
[8:45] but the reproach we have to bear is that
[8:48] when somebody comes and tells us about
[8:50] their denomination and want you to come
[8:55] to their church and then they want you
[8:57] to do this and you just kind of have to
[8:58] say well no you know we just use use use
[9:03] discretion listen it's gonna come a time
[9:07] the way they the separation is gonna be
[9:09] worse than it is meant cuz we're even
[9:12] see them separation in our own ranks
[9:14] amongst liberal family members much less
[9:18] spiritual family members the little
[9:20] family members are being run apart
[9:21] because of what doctrine denomination
[9:25] right but we have to bear his reproach
[9:34] and I was thinking also they talk about
[9:38] you know Jesus died on cross into the
[9:40] denominational world and if my brother
[9:42] Brad said they really can't they can't
[9:43] get him off the policies like Jesus died
[9:45] for our sins but when you say hold on
[9:48] when you say well he's now living inside
[9:50] of him they'll say yeah that's fine
[9:52] but you know you still see the smoking
[9:54] drinking and the apparel wearing and the
[9:56] doing and of this and that the other you
[9:58] go I don't know if he's in their mind
[10:02] you know your your testimony doesn't fit
[10:05] sure what brother Brown said your
[10:06] testimony doesn't fit your life you know
[10:08] and that's what this was we were saying
[10:10] back up here watch the strange doctrine
[10:14] be established through grace not with
[10:15] meats which have not profited them than
[10:17] have been occupied therein in other
[10:21] words they may have they've got a
[10:24] message they have a message listen the
[10:26] denominational people there's going to
[10:28] be good people in there that's going to
[10:29] be given eternal life but they will be
[10:31] foolish virgin or they will be under
[10:34] their own message because the bag has
[10:37] had a message the men that has had a
[10:38] message the Pentecostals had a message
[10:40] and they're going to be a lot of them's
[10:42] going to be bright because they got
[10:43] warning in under their opportunity but
[10:46] now since this has come to life the end
[10:50] of the conversation of this is is that
[10:52] Jesus is not a second person we're not
[10:54] praying to a second person we're not
[10:55] praying to a to a father that I mean to
[10:58] a son that has to go to the Father and
[11:00] it's two separate people or the Holy
[11:01] Ghost is another you got three ending up
[11:03] there speaking of that same way we've
[11:06] water baptism you know you could have
[11:09] stopped and talked to that guy about
[11:10] water baptism and you just made a sane
[11:12] mind because you've you've you've got a
[11:15] knowledge of the not a knowledge of the
[11:17] truth you've got this knowledge he has a
[11:20] knowledge of the truth
[11:21] his knowledge tells him he needs to be
[11:23] baptized which is good he come to a
[11:26] knowledge he needed to be baptized and
[11:28] that's what Paul's dealing with people
[11:30] that have come to a knowledge maybe that
[11:33] well I don't know if this sacrifice up
[11:35] here
[11:36] I don't know about all that and he said
[11:38] well you know let me tell you something
[11:39] let's go without the camp we got to get
[11:41] out of Jerusalem in other words or get
[11:43] out of jewelry jewelry not jewelry
[11:46] jewelry we got to get out of that gotta
[11:49] go to the temple gotta make sacrifices
[11:51] Jesus Christ made the sacrifice for you
[11:54] that's why it's so beautiful by now
[11:56] 144,000 when they they're gonna have to
[11:58] come out of the camp because they're in
[12:00] the camp of Israel now they're going to
[12:02] have to be separated outside even their
[12:05] own brothers probably their literal
[12:08] brothers when when the two prophets
[12:10] bring the message and they get a
[12:12] revelation that Jesus Christ died for
[12:14] them we'll see that's totally contrary
[12:16] to all of jewelry all of even Orthodox
[12:19] youth don't believe that Jesus was the
[12:21] Messiah they believed it was a dead
[12:23] person whatever but when they see that
[12:25] they're gonna have to come outside the
[12:27] camp they're gonna have to and then what
[12:29] are they gonna do they're gonna be
[12:30] killed
[12:31] yeah and I was thinking about this last
[12:33] this week coming up when we're talking
[12:36] about the the Daniel 70 weeks and all
[12:38] just remember we won't remember one
[12:40] thing those 144,000 are not going to go
[12:44] up the statue of the perfect man they're
[12:46] going to get born again under the
[12:48] justification baby form sanctification
[12:50] baby form and the baptism of the Holy
[12:52] Ghost they're not gonna have time to go
[12:54] up this statue for a minute and that's
[12:55] not for them this is for us Peter said
[13:00] it's for that have the divine nature of
[13:03] God sure you they will receive the
[13:04] divine nature of God methey I mean some
[13:06] of them may not have a year or whatever
[13:10] to listen but what they're going to do
[13:13] is they're going to come to a place
[13:15] where did you get those stars and that
[13:21] they wail and mourn away from each other
[13:23] because of what happened and then God's
[13:26] gonna burp them into the body but not as
[13:28] bride remember bride is this is a
[13:30] requirement for the bride because look
[13:32] this is for what this is the first thing
[13:34] about last week
[13:35] this is for the body 144,000 is not the
[13:38] body they're not the body of Christ
[13:41] this body is taken away this wild olive
[13:45] branch is taken away so that God can
[13:48] graft back in the regular olive tree but
[13:53] that regular olive tree is not going to
[13:55] take the position of Grove that the
[13:57] bride took so they're just going to get
[14:00] born again they're gonna get baby form
[14:01] justification they're going to know that
[14:02] their past sin so that's what Daniel 7 2
[14:05] weeks is for make them end up sin
[14:08] transgression and what iniquity finished
[14:13] finished and finished done done with
[14:15] reconcile he's going to reconcile them
[14:18] to a position but you and I are
[14:19] reconciled to that position and then
[14:21] born because marks given the morons
[14:25] required this is was given Peter gave
[14:28] this to the Gentiles and then Paul
[14:32] continues on about growth development
[14:33] he's talking about the Gentiles because
[14:41] the Bible tells us that we may read a
[14:42] little bit later on in Daniel over in
[14:45] Daniel it says Daniel death of course
[14:47] this is to his people he said you need
[14:48] you're gonna go to sleep in other words
[14:50] you're gonna come to a place and then
[14:52] you're gonna go to sleep and you these
[14:53] other people are gonna come in 144,000
[14:56] oh I'll take this up and there girl take
[14:58] a rapture but they're gonna have to die
[15:01] say under 44,000 - is they're gonna have
[15:04] to die we'll talk about that this
[15:05] afternoon they're gonna have to die give
[15:08] their life and then their resurrected
[15:10] rapture you and I have a promise that
[15:12] will not die that will have a body
[15:15] change before that for most for some and
[15:18] then a carrying away right mm-hmm for
[15:23] here we have no continuance T but we
[15:25] seek one to come now see that's
[15:27] separating I would I would see that in
[15:28] an angle Stephanie wait Jews have a
[15:31] continuance they have a city they are
[15:34] going to live in Jerusalem God promised
[15:37] them that's where he would put his name
[15:38] was the injury
[15:41] that city the very foundation of that
[15:45] city is going to be rebuilt for the
[15:47] Millennium that's for the Jews because
[15:50] it's for Daniel and the city if you get
[15:53] those two together you'll see damn
[15:56] seventy weeks mortgage use well this is
[15:58] for the people and this is for the city
[16:00] that's what we're talking about the
[16:01] specific purpose we'll go over that
[16:03] again that the first three is for the
[16:06] people when the last three is for the
[16:07] city very plain right that you can see
[16:10] that there is one week left after the
[16:12] rapture to finish Daniel 70 weeks not to
[16:15] finish the tribulation and not to finish
[16:17] the 1260 days but in Daniel 9 I was
[16:21] reading yesterday Daniel 9:24 through 27
[16:23] has no half weeks in there anywhere
[16:27] they're full weeks seven weeks 62 and
[16:29] one there's no half weeks in the Bible
[16:34] except for the ministry of Jesus Christ
[16:36] and the ministry of the two witnesses
[16:38] that's the only half weeks that you have
[16:40] in there and that's inside Daniel 70
[16:43] weeks but it doesn't finish Daniel 7 do
[16:45] you laughing about
[16:46] we do that about Haley just laughing
[16:53] [Music]
[16:56] their bikes my love me like that without
[16:58] betterment for here we have no
[17:00] containment stadium we know because
[17:02] we're just going to actually be in the
[17:04] Millennium I want you to know that we're
[17:05] going to be in a millennium just like
[17:07] just like you you're going to Hammond

[17:35] you're you're well taken care of well
[17:37] that's what's gonna happen in the
[17:38] Millenium because we're gonna show up
[17:40] after they build the temple we're going
[17:43] to show up to be the anointing as
[17:45] brother Brown said in the six fold
[17:46] purpose the norming to the

[18:13] ourselves but Christ is because he's got
[18:16] to rule the 12 tribes of Israel
[18:18] alright I'd like to have a picture of
[18:23] that Danny found carrying the diaper bag

[18:56] is you you are the city and when we get
[18:59] to the future home which is way
[19:01] different than a millennium way
[19:03] different so this is a temporal place
[19:05] that thousand years is temporary
[19:08] everything in is temporary
[19:10] now there's gonna be eternal people in
[19:12] it but all that's gonna be wiped off
[19:14] after the white throne judgment and then
[19:15] there's a new city which is you and me
[19:17] are going to come down out of heaven
[19:19] settling in on that mountain that's
[19:21] going to be over there in the same place
[19:23] called truth okay if I write with that
[19:26] just get the two things separated future
[19:29] home then though see that brings us in
[19:31] future ohm is nothing but to the bride
[19:35] 144,000 then become servants they filled
[19:39] you whatever you want to say but all
[19:40] everybody else boots virgin has to live
[19:42] outside the city right in the Millennium
[19:44] it's just going to be Jesus stepped on
[19:47] the throne as the son of David with the
[19:49] twelve problems of Israel he's ruling
[19:51] and
[19:51] for a thousand years and we're just
[19:53] going to be there just to be happy and
[19:55] have fun and we're gonna be you know
[19:56] it's gonna be we've been in fortified
[19:58] bodies for a while so and there's a lot
[20:02] to learn to that too so we'll get to
[20:03] that maybe later on so we don't have a
[20:07] continuing city but remember the Jews do
[20:10] so you have to separate the two the Jews
[20:12] have a steady they're going to live in
[20:13] in the Millennium for a thousand years
[20:16] they're going to build back to the
[20:17] tabernacle they're going to build back
[20:19] everything that gets destroyed and then
[20:22] we're going to live there 22 zico 2244 B
[20:25] everywhere is leaking 45449 came too
[20:28] much on the dimensions but you have to
[20:30] watch where a lot of things come from
[20:31] the east and even the Shikata even the
[20:34] Shekinah glory we're going to come in
[20:36] brown brown so we're gonna come in for
[20:37] what Christ comes from through the what
[20:39] eastern gate yeah so we're coming
[20:41] through the when we come back we're
[20:43] gonna come back into the Eastern Eastern
[20:44] gate when you sing that song you know
[20:47] we'll about the eastern gate won money
[20:51] yes these from gay yami-chan horn beside
[20:54] the east engaged over level that's what
[20:56] we're going but now listen we're not
[20:57] going to enter in as Jews we're going to
[21:00] enter in as the anointing to the whole
[21:01] temple to the whole but they know that
[21:08] and we were over there on the eastern
[21:12] yang there say old cemetery they read
[21:17] somebody that's a cemetery in front of
[21:20] it thinking they're gonna keep God okay
[21:23] no he just don't like this resurrect the
[21:25] ball go run away
[21:30] they'll have to pick a bunch of those
[21:33] houses and all kind of stuff just
[21:34] surrounded that's my brother I'm said
[21:38] you know when it's that little place
[21:40] called Palestine because see this is my
[21:43] thought on this just room just for a
[21:44] moment until Israel takes over Palestine
[21:48] again they're really not in their
[21:49] homeland but Palestine is part of their
[21:52] and remember it's right on the border
[21:54] they just blobs of each other all the
[21:56] time comes over the Palestinians hate
[21:58] the Jews because that's it's one's kids
[22:00] and then they might be some issue of
[22:02] everyone I'm saying they're right there
[22:04] at that border because remember Israel
[22:06] took that in that six-day war and give
[22:09] it right back to will see Palestine
[22:11] brother have you read many times he says
[22:13] that city and he brings Palestine
[22:16] Palestine Palestine even at the end of
[22:19] ten two weeks I believe he's thoughts
[22:20] about Palestine we'll see they don't
[22:22] have Palestine until they occupy
[22:23] Palestine they're not in their homeland
[22:26] that's why we're still here maybe when
[22:28] we get ready to get out of here they'll
[22:29] take Palestine over again and in that'll
[22:32] stick of course it's going to set a lot
[22:34] of people angry at them but the whole
[22:36] world angry at them anyway right what
[22:39] one place do you hear so much about
[22:41] they said Jerusalem and the Jews and
[22:43] what they're doing what this is doing
[22:44] the neck and doing one nation is doing
[22:45] this one you don't hear it nobody else
[22:47] except that one little place you don't
[22:50] want to because that's where God is
[22:51] gonna be God said that's my city I'm
[22:53] gonna give this to the Jews this is your
[22:55] land you will have this that's why we're
[22:57] gonna come back in the blend but now he
[22:59] didn't say that to mean you me and you
[23:01] got from north south east and west all
[23:04] the way around we have the whole earth
[23:05] right by him therefore let us offer the
[23:09] sacrifice of praise to God continually
[23:11] that is the fruit of our lips giving
[23:13] thanks to his name and I believe that's
[23:16] what you do every time you talk about
[23:17] thought at the time we sit down and talk
[23:19] about the Lord even the things that
[23:20] God's done for us that we're giving
[23:23] thanks to his name but to do good and
[23:26] communicate forget not
[23:29] I believe you remember what brother Dale
[23:33] reads in in Peter it talks about life
[23:37] and godliness you read that we've been
[23:40] reading it under time brother Dale have
[23:42] been talks about life and godliness so
[23:45] life general you stole my eternal life
[23:47] yeah your general life is controlled by
[23:50] your Christianity wait but now then we
[23:55] have a conversation that we have here
[23:56] but sister Johnny hasn't all right Terry
[24:02] Johnny has got to go back home and carry
[24:04] that conversation well she's not got a
[24:07] hundred people to talk to she's got her
[24:09] little whatever it is same way with us
[24:11] we dispersed and go to the different
[24:13] places and we carry that conversation
[24:15] with us okay by him therefore let us
[24:18] offer the sacrifice of praise to God
[24:20] continually that is the fruit of our
[24:22] lips giving thanks to his name just like
[24:24] Gigi you know the guy probably didn't
[24:26] have anything for me but when we walked
[24:28] by there and he handed me that thing he
[24:29] needs to though I co and Bible readers
[24:31] will not in the Bible but we were
[24:34] clean-cut didn't have things hanging all
[24:36] over the place Jim didn't have tattoos
[24:38] and we have tattoos all over and there
[24:41] was a was a very maybe they didn't
[24:45] believe it that way but there was an
[24:47] image of godliness right there you know
[24:50] where we were clean-cut
[24:52] that's all he done he had everything he
[24:53] said he said I see all the Bible readers
[24:56] are suffered you know the by I see
[24:58] you've done well ran in the Bible walk
[25:01] all he done was handing me that I said
[25:03] hello Jim said hello he handed me the
[25:05] thing so I see yeah you understand what
[25:07] I'm saying so let your conversation
[25:09] really Brown said your conversation is
[25:12] your life it's not so much as your
[25:14] conversation sometimes we say thanks we
[25:17] don't keep saying but our life
[25:18] conversation to the world and see that's
[25:21] one we're set apart and that's why I
[25:24] don't I don't see where I said I do see
[25:28] where Christianity has got so lacks
[25:30] because if you look out in the crowd of
[25:32] people then you see the things that we
[25:36] know are not right and they go to church
[25:39] today
[25:40] consider the self Christian you know
[25:43] women leading saying smoking cigarettes
[25:45] how you coming so let's see we separate
[25:49] ourselves but you know what we don't do
[25:53] the separate God does the separate to
[25:57] rewire life that's why I don't agree
[26:00] with the ones that try to live so close
[26:02] to that line where you can't hardly but
[26:04] seeing a crowd I can take all of you and
[26:06] put you in a crowd and y'all pick you
[26:07] you can take us out why because you know
[26:10] what to look for there's a lot of times
[26:12] you go through a crowd like yesterday we
[26:14] saw some like Amish or Mennonite and
[26:16] they had a long dress and the different
[26:18] things oh but then you saw the other
[26:19] part day didn't have much at all and
[26:23] needed to but see you see that we'll see
[26:27] God separating you you're not doing the
[26:29] separating and we're not gonna say well
[26:31] they're going to hell because of that no
[26:33] they're going to hell because they're
[26:34] unbelievers so you and I could dress
[26:37] well here's my point we can all dress
[26:39] well and try to fit in but if we're not
[26:40] born again let's get this real quick we
[26:45] have not that far but to do good and
[26:48] communicate forget not what my point was
[26:50] these these virtues are not just for you
[26:55] being godly it's for your life if you'll
[26:59] take the life principle that's why I
[27:00] don't mind somebody like they ran again
[27:02] different ones Rick Warren and some of
[27:04] them that use the Bible to help you in
[27:06] life because if you'll use life
[27:07] principles of the Bible I'll promise you
[27:09] you'll do better my brother they'll said
[27:11] you pay your tithes every Sunday like
[27:12] you're supposed to and don't join God he
[27:14] said I'll guarantee you you'll be better
[27:16] in a year well you see the one thing
[27:18] it's just so obvious
[27:20] you see people struggle Kumtor times
[27:22] know they struggle with their money you
[27:24] know one thing's for sure they're not
[27:26] paying their high that's right you can
[27:28] see that I mean that but see that's what
[27:30] you see you see that part you don't
[27:32] really have to good luck
[27:34] you know so and it's just saying you
[27:38] know what does that need our money baby
[27:40] wants you to be a trooper giver if you
[27:42] you know if you even pay your time then
[27:44] you pay that out of our city because you
[27:47] think you have to that's not going step
[27:49] done it God says he loves a cheerful
[27:52] Giver all right
[27:54] I'd love to play my top I don't have to
[27:56] when Jude tells me how much time we need
[27:57] to pay her I tell her I'm on top of pay
[27:59] we don't know no that goes first if you
[28:06] put that first you're going to worry
[28:07] about the rest well that was a life
[28:11] lesson but to do good and to communicate
[28:13] forget not God
[28:15] Paul God through Paul is telling us to
[28:17] be Christian rid of our lips giving
[28:19] thanks to his name but do good and
[28:22] communicate forget not because people
[28:24] are watching you all right for with such
[28:28] sacrifices God is well pleased God's
[28:33] well pleased with acne if we do that
[28:34] didn't done shaking his head amen
[28:37] obey them they have the rule over you
[28:39] and submit yourself when they watch for
[28:40] your souls talking about nonprofit
[28:42] pastors teachers and evangelists
[28:44] as they must give account that they may
[28:46] do it with joy and not with grief
[28:51] brother they were gonna lead this flock
[28:53] out of grief I don't think he might get
[28:55] greed but he's not running out of grief
[28:58] man he's watching for yourself that we
[29:02] made that he may do it with joy or we
[29:04] may do it with joy and not with grief
[29:05] same way without our even I don't what
[29:07] we do we shouldn't do it I agree we
[29:09] should not have a sad countenance when
[29:10] we come to church some people they like
[29:12] it just took them I mean a
[29:15] tractor-trailer load of grief to get the
[29:17] church you know what they got a drug
[29:22] problem
[29:24] they drove their self the dirt but if
[29:28] you come with a cheerful heart and do it
[29:30] the way the Bible says then you're fine
[29:34] do it with joy not with grief what that
[29:38] is unprofitable for you he's not saying
[29:42] you're not a Christian he's just saying
[29:43] if you do it how to grief it's not
[29:45] profitable for you pray for us run
[29:52] Funplex doctor pray for us for we trust
[29:55] we have a good conscience and all things
[29:57] willing to live honestly now that's just
[29:59] life life and godliness in second Peter
[30:04] read that again if you've never read it
[30:05] before it talks about life and godliness
[30:08] this is God's image but if you'll apply
[30:10] this over into your life you'll have a
[30:13] better time
[30:14] pray for us when we trust we have a good
[30:16] conscience
