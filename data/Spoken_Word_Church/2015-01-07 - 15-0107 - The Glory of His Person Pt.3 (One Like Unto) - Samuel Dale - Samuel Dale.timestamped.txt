[2:18] sometimes to sit down and just listen
[2:21] you know without having to plan for
[2:24] whatever you're doing I I generally have
[2:26] to listen in a rotation see if something
[2:29] that I'm speaking about but when you can
[2:32] just sit down and put on the tape and

[2:38] Brother randam explaining over and over
[2:40] and over that you're born again at
[2:43] Faith and then you know while all these
[2:46] people get confused about that I don't
[2:49] understand it but that's the way it's
[2:50] got to be for everybody all right if
[2:53] you'd like turn in your scriptures turn
[2:54] in Revelations
[2:56] 1 and then we will go to Exodus

[3:06] your prayers they uh finally got our
[3:08] test back from the uh sleep ever how you
[3:12] say that word Acme or AC me or whoever
[3:14] it is what whatever and I laugh because
[3:20] they said I stopped breathing 152 times
[3:24] with and I didn't sleep 4 hours I know
[3:26] because I was awake most of the night so
[3:29] I don't I don't know what's keeping me
[3:30] awake and keeping me alive and they said
[3:32] that that my uh uh oxygen level had got
[3:36] down as low as 87 during the night and
[3:40] said no wonder you wake up a lot I said
[3:42] okay but they don't know that when I
[3:45] wake up I pray so I don't worry about it
[3:49] I just say by Stripes I'm Healed and I
[3:52] keep right on going he's old Devil's
[3:54] cutting off trying to stop my breathing
[3:56] trying to stop everything try to cold

[4:03] worried about it for and if he does
[4:05] everything's all right anyway that's
[4:07] right who's worried you know I don't
[4:10] have no concern whatsoever I have no
[4:13] fear in that line of anything that the
[4:16] devil can do to me CU he can't do it
[4:18] until God gets through with me then when
[4:20] he's through with me I'm that's all
[4:22] right you know but just just pray for us
[4:25] that the Lord would you know take
[4:26] everything and make it work out for his
[4:28] honor and Glory all right Revelations 1

[5:14] word and healed us and delivered us from
[5:16] destruction so we believe it and we just
[5:19] depend upon that have your way now as we
[5:21] read your word you come and speak to our
[5:23] hearts about what to say to your people
[5:26] in jesus' name amen revelation
[5:31] 1 we'll start verse
[5:35] 10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's day
[5:38] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[5:40] a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega
[5:43] the first and the last and what thou see
[5:46] us right now
[5:48] notice you
[5:50] know a voice comes and said I am Alpha
[5:53] and
[5:54] Oma all right now he knew as I've tried
[5:58] to emphasize so much he knew whose voice
[6:01] that
[6:02] was he didn't have no problems with that
[6:05] see all
[6:07] right and what thou seest right in a
[6:09] book and send it unto the seven churches
[6:12] which are in Asia unto Ephesus unto
[6:14] samna unto per pergamus under Tiara
[6:17] under Sardis and under Philadelphia and
[6:20] under lady oia and I turned to see the
[6:22] voice that spake with me and being
[6:24] turned I saw seven golden
[6:27] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[6:28] seven candlesticks one like unto the son
[6:32] of man clothed with a garment down to
[6:34] the foot and G about the PS with a
[6:37] golden girdle maybe an odd scripture to
[6:40] get to when we finally get to the to the
[6:43] part we want to bring out tonight but
[6:45] Exodus
[6:48] 33 and we'll begin reading at Verse
[6:51] 18 if you remember the background story
[6:55] Moses says Lord I'd like to see you
[7:00] what about as many times as he been in
[7:01] personal contact with him things that
[7:04] had happened but he's never seen him
[7:07] like he wanted to and he said Lord I'd
[7:09] just like to see you well he didn't mean
[7:11] I'd like to see you in Revelations I'd
[7:14] like to see you in this and that of the
[7:16] other cuz he'd seen that all right so
[7:19] what's what he's saying and he said I
[7:22] beseech thee show me thy
[7:24] glory and he said I will make all my
[7:28] goodness pass before for thee and I will
[7:31] proclaim the name of the Lord before
[7:33] thee and will be gracious to whom I will
[7:36] be
[7:37] gracious and will show Mercy on whom I
[7:40] will show mercy and he said thou cast
[7:44] not see my face for there shall no man
[7:50] see me and
[7:53] live and the Lord said behold there is a
[7:56] place by
[7:57] me Thou shalt stand upon a rock and it
[8:00] shall come to pass while my glory passes
[8:05] by now watch what heus saying now it
[8:08] shall come to pass while my
[8:10] glory now we're talking about the
[8:12] Sevenfold Glory of his
[8:14] person this is all a background to get
[8:17] to that part so now watch what he's
[8:19] saying he shall come to pass while my
[8:22] Glory passees by that I will put thee in
[8:25] the Cliff of the rock so now his glory
[8:28] is going to pass by
[8:29] and he's going to be over here taking
[8:31] him putting him in a
[8:34] rock read your
[8:39] Bible and it shall come to pass while my
[8:41] glory passes by that I will put thee in
[8:44] the Cliff of The Rock and will cover
[8:46] thee with my hand while I pass by look
[8:50] at and I'll take I will take away mine
[8:54] hand and thou shalt see my back Parts
[8:57] but my face shall shall not be seen you
[9:01] may be seated the Lord at his Blessing
[9:04] to the reading of the
[9:06] word
[9:08] now I want
[9:10] to try to get to a point tonight I've
[9:13] been trying to for a while to to do but
[9:17] you know I was going to go on into the
[9:19] Sevenfold Glory of his
[9:21] person but when when I got into the part
[9:24] of thinking on it then it began to
[9:26] develop into other things that I believe
[9:29] we need to understand there you know and
[9:33] and uh be able to follow it in a line
[9:37] but now what have we been doing we've
[9:39] been using Revelations
[9:42] 1 and we saw in Revelations 1 that Jesus
[9:47] says now
[9:49] John before I show you
[9:52] anything I want you to know who I am
[9:56] right CU he had said I am Alpha and
[9:59] speak of the beginning and the
[10:01] ending now then he says now
[10:05] John I'm being that Alpha and Omega said
[10:08] now you just stand and listen to me
[10:14] while that was the quotes we gave from
[10:16] the prophets you know on the seven
[10:18] Church ages and on the patmas
[10:22] vision now think about what's taking
[10:28] place he shows John these things and he
[10:32] says now before you before I show you
[10:36] anything I want you to know who I
[10:39] am I'm the alpha I'm the Omega I'm the
[10:43] beginning I'm the ending I'm all of it
[10:47] all right and said just stand there
[10:51] now and just
[10:54] listen we we read there in Revelations
[10:58] that it takes just a minute to read uh
[11:00] you know almost the whole chapter of one
[11:04] you know maybe one two minutes but yet
[11:07] we look at those things as uh you know
[11:10] we just read it but I don't look at the
[11:14] Bible that way I look at it in the bases
[11:17] of that maybe this would have been quite
[11:20] a
[11:22] while you know what's the needing be in
[11:25] a
[11:26] hurry the Eternal God is going to speak
[11:29] and he wants to make sure that John
[11:31] understands him so it's not you know a
[11:34] lot of time we just read something and
[11:36] we think that was just a two-minute
[11:38] Affair like I said about uh Nicodemus
[11:40] and Jesus talking that might have been
[11:43] hours in
[11:45] conversation you know see we we we
[11:49] narrow those things down and want to
[11:51] make them a little bitty short stories
[11:54] instead of
[11:55] thinking now he says
[11:57] John
[11:59] I'm Alpha and
[12:01] Omega now you just stand there and
[12:03] listen now you know John whose voice
[12:07] this
[12:09] is amen it wasn't a
[12:13] trumpet it's just stating in that way
[12:17] right that it's like a trumpet it wasn't
[12:21] a to to it was a voice it said
[12:25] something see when we started off in
[12:28] there in Revelation he said now I'm the
[12:31] alpha and omega you know a voice
[12:34] speaking well now there was no problem
[12:37] with John understanding whose voice that
[12:41] was because he knew that
[12:44] voice all
[12:46] right and he knew that he was to be
[12:49] there cuz he said he was you know verse
[12:52] about nine he said I was on patmas for
[12:56] you know the word of the Lord he knew he
[12:59] was there for a reason he wasn't just
[13:00] throw out there for no no reason he knew
[13:04] he was there for some reason and he was
[13:06] there to what hear the things and then
[13:10] said write it in a book right and send
[13:14] it
[13:15] unto the seven Church ages all right now
[13:19] in doing that then John knows who's
[13:25] talking he knows that voice see he knows
[13:31] this dire but yet he's looking maybe in
[13:34] another
[13:36] Direction cuz it said and he turned to
[13:38] see The
[13:40] Voice the prophet you remember we gave
[13:42] it the voice in the person is the same
[13:46] right so that was to be the voice of
[13:48] almighty God that would speak all right
[13:51] and as he would be doing that he says
[13:53] now John you just hold on a minute
[13:56] before I take you any further in all all
[13:58] of this I want you to know who I
[14:01] am and I want you to stand still and
[14:04] just
[14:05] listen well right John pays close
[14:11] attention and he turns to see that
[14:15] voice and probably in himself was
[14:19] expecting to see the Lord Jesus Christ
[14:23] standing there because he knew his voice
[14:27] all right now I've tried to emphasize
[14:29] that a lot trying to get something to
[14:31] you that will help us uh maybe a little
[14:34] further along all right and
[14:37] uh this is with way taking the Sunday
[14:40] service is it giving me more time to
[14:42] kind of just you know Coast a little and
[14:46] if I repeat myself a lot just don't
[14:48] worry about it it might be for me but it
[14:52] might be for you too you know so just
[14:55] hang on all right but now John
[14:59] you write this book you send it to the
[15:02] seven Church
[15:03] ages all right and said now you know
[15:07] whose voice it is but when he turned to
[15:09] see the voice now notice he he's a
[15:12] prophet and things are taking
[15:15] place when he turned it's kind of like
[15:17] chapter four and five you remember there
[15:20] in in he he sees a
[15:24] throne then he sees one on the throne
[15:28] all this is stages of something
[15:31] transpiring it's just not he turns to
[15:33] see a throne and one sitting on the
[15:34] throne it's not that way he emphasizes
[15:37] it all right so is it here he hears the
[15:41] voice he turns to expecting to see the
[15:45] Lord Jesus all right and then but it
[15:48] wasn't a problem when he looked now and
[15:53] he saw seven golden candlesticks seven
[15:57] lampstands you can to go through all of
[15:59] the things the prophet did with
[16:01] expressing it but he sees that
[16:05] first and he stands and looks at
[16:10] it then he sees one standing in the
[16:14] midst of the seven golden Candlestick
[16:18] am all right now as I said he was
[16:21] expecting probably to turn to see the
[16:24] Lord Jesus standing there but he
[16:27] realizes that some IND different because
[16:30] he's not seeing Jesus
[16:34] Christ you
[16:36] know the human person that he knew upon
[16:40] Earth so he looks and he says all
[16:44] right there's seven golden
[16:48] candlesticks he knows he's got to write
[16:50] these things and send it to him but then
[16:52] he saw one standing in the midst of the
[16:54] seven golden canand like unto the son of
[16:56] man that's right he did didn't see the
[16:59] Lord Jesus Christ in human flesh of the
[17:02] bodily form of the Lord Jesus that was
[17:05] stood on Earth are you with
[17:07] me but what does he see he sees a bodily
[17:10] form
[17:13] right
[17:16] right now listen with me and think about
[17:18] it he sees a bodily
[17:22] form and he knows that bodily
[17:26] form is the one one that's
[17:29] speaking to him not just looking at it
[17:33] like do you see that picture over
[17:36] Y
[17:38] no he knows that voice is coming from
[17:43] this
[17:45] form that he sees standing before him in
[17:49] the midst of the seven golden
[17:50] Candlestick amen now that's what I've
[17:53] been trying to get us to look
[17:57] at and he has no problem then
[18:02] looking at this form that he
[18:08] sees you know
[18:11] right and and he doesn't look around oh
[18:15] you're not
[18:16] Jesus you
[18:18] know no he knows the voice amen just
[18:23] like Paul
[18:24] what I am Jesus whom thou persecuted
[18:31] right you see he's looking here and he
[18:34] sees one standing in the midst of the
[18:36] seven golden candles like unto the son
[18:38] of man he knows it is not the flesh form
[18:43] that he's looking at amen but he knows
[18:46] he's looking at a
[18:48] body because he describes it later in
[18:52] you know the face and the the ha and the
[18:56] feet and the things that we'll we'll get
[18:59] to it but he saw one standing in the
[19:02] midst of the seven golden Cy like unto
[19:04] the son of man all right now we know
[19:07] like means same person or same being or
[19:10] likenesses whatever all
[19:13] right and he knew who it was that was
[19:15] speaking to
[19:18] him but he's looking at a at a
[19:21] symbol and the symbol is not just the
[19:25] church
[19:26] ages you know the candles
[19:29] candlesticks which one you want to
[19:32] use but he actually
[19:34] sees a
[19:39] person
[19:41] right he describes that
[19:44] person as we'll go along
[19:47] later so he's not surprised that he
[19:49] didn't see the person of Jesus when he
[19:53] turned but he saw the
[19:56] body now not the the body of the Lord
[19:59] Jesus Christ body that we look at I've
[20:01] expressed that but he saw this body
[20:04] standing in the seven golden
[20:07] candlesticks
[20:11] right one like unto the son of
[20:14] man in other words the son of man in
[20:17] another
[20:18] form an imorph are changing his
[20:22] form all
[20:26] right now if he saw him in another form
[20:30] what form did he see him in that's
[20:32] that's the point I want you to to dwell
[20:34] with me for a little while am he saw him
[20:38] in the bodily
[20:40] form and it wouldn't have been
[20:43] necessarily to look like the bodily form
[20:47] of the Lord Jesus Christ you know as we
[20:49] talk about it and talk about what he
[20:51] looked like and
[20:53] thing but he sees a bride
[20:57] form
[21:00] God is going to reveal himself where
[21:03] does he really reveal himself as being
[21:06] okay
[21:09] John I want you to know who I
[21:13] am and I want you to stand still and
[21:15] listen
[21:17] now and I want you to see this
[21:19] form all right we've been through it
[21:22] over and
[21:23] over through why we are not a
[21:26] denomination where brother brand said he
[21:28] saw a bride standing in the candlesticks
[21:32] draw
[21:34] outen all
[21:36] right saw him in that all
[21:40] right this
[21:43] description that he
[21:46] gives is a description
[21:49] of the
[21:51] Bride
[21:53] right all right but now it it can't be a
[21:58] second
[22:01] person right cuz if it was it wouldn't
[22:05] be saying like unto the son of man it
[22:06] just say some
[22:08] man but when it's emphasizing like unto
[22:11] the son of man it means simply that he's
[22:14] changed
[22:17] forms all and that's not the flesh form
[22:21] but it's the form that he's revealing
[22:23] himself
[22:26] in and Reve heing himself in Bride
[22:32] form G about the PS with a golden girdle
[22:35] you know all of the things we'll get
[22:39] back to more on that later i' I tried to
[22:41] put a lot of emphasis in
[22:43] it and you know what he was looking
[22:46] at 2 Thessalonians 1 and10 covers
[22:50] it when he shall come to be
[22:54] glorified in his Saints right
[23:00] to be glorified in his
[23:02] Saints
[23:04] all one light we went
[23:07] through his
[23:09] bride perhaps not a man a
[23:13] woman and coming down to see that it
[23:16] even winds up being the
[23:18] judge because of the girdle and the the
[23:21] places where it was
[23:23] put in all judgment according to John I
[23:27] think it's
[23:28] 532 is the judgment is put into the
[23:31] hands of the
[23:33] son all
[23:35] right so now I have no problem then
[23:39] looking at what John is looking at and
[23:41] saying that this was the Bride of Jesus
[23:45] Christ all right and that bride of Jesus
[23:48] Christ would be the
[23:52] word for the age and
[23:56] time and it would be be the Son of God
[23:59] right you say no no it's the son of man
[24:03] see you just getting spiritual enough to
[24:05] flop difference between Son of God and
[24:06] son of man just stay with me in what I'm
[24:08] talking about all
[24:10] right because brother random and saying
[24:13] who is this son of man he said in the
[24:15] beginning was the word word was with God
[24:16] and the Word was God that's I think it's
[24:18] the rising the sun all
[24:21] right see then you could look at him and
[24:24] see that that Son of God was the one
[24:27] that came out in the
[24:29] beginning but now he's come down to show
[24:32] himself in Bride
[24:36] form like unto the son of
[24:39] man see not being the physical son of
[24:44] man but one like unto the son of
[24:47] man all right now you better hold on a
[24:50] little bit on that to think about it
[24:53] because we don't want to go too far in
[24:54] that line so let's stay with what did De
[24:57] see there he saw the
[24:59] glorified Lord Jesus Christ in Bride
[25:05] form the Son of
[25:10] God the Son of God that's why it says
[25:13] he's like un to the son of
[25:16] man because what's the difference in it
[25:18] brother Brown said there is no
[25:20] difference this day except the bodily
[25:24] form right right right there's no Del in
[25:28] God and his bride except for the bodily
[25:31] form that she's
[25:33] inen all right right so it's like unto
[25:36] the son of man so he sees him standing
[25:39] there as the glorified Son of
[25:42] God we'll read these in a
[25:45] minute all
[25:48] right he says
[25:51] John write this and send it to the
[25:56] church
[25:59] I want the church to realize who they
[26:01] are is that why he sing
[26:04] it I want the church to realize who they
[26:07] are so I'm not just going to start
[26:09] writing about the church ages and what
[26:11] happens in the ages and times sure he
[26:14] does that but he's laying a
[26:18] background for us to see like I've
[26:20] always told you to me the Book of
[26:22] Revelation is the greatest of all the
[26:23] books because there's nowhere in the
[26:25] Book of Revelation do you see Jesus
[26:27] Christ by himself he's always
[26:31] with
[26:33] somebody because he'll never do that
[26:36] again because that's the way he joined
[26:39] himself all but are you
[26:43] listening watch what he says
[26:46] now judgment is given to the
[26:51] son now where do we get down I know we
[26:53] won't deny to where I'm going anyway but
[26:55] where do we get down to where it says
[26:57] that no man man to seen God at any
[27:01] time but the only
[27:04] begotten had the
[27:09] clarity you know if you study brother
[27:11] Brown's message real closely it gets
[27:14] very very close in some places
[27:17] that there is actually a quote and
[27:20] forget time we'll read it where he says
[27:21] that Jesus had no no legs no arms no
[27:25] hands EX you know God had no hand arms
[27:29] or legs except in
[27:33] Jesus and he says you can't see
[27:36] him but yet what we just read in the
[27:39] scriptures declares that
[27:42] Moses saw right a
[27:46] form
[27:49] right and brother R said he saw the ofne
[27:52] a form right amen all
[27:54] right now think about it
[27:59] not only does he show John who he
[28:02] is he shows John where he
[28:06] is in his church and that church is his
[28:11] body the
[28:13] Believers and that church must be
[28:15] revealed remember the message we brought
[28:18] that
[28:19] out Christ Myst God revealed she is to
[28:21] be
[28:23] revealed the bride is to be
[28:26] revealed all right that's right why
[28:30] because she and the word becomes one and
[28:32] when you're revealing the word you're
[28:33] automatically
[28:34] revealing the person that you're talking
[28:38] about so are you listening
[28:42] now what did John see so let's just read
[28:46] a few quotes and then we'll get on to
[28:48] our
[28:50] thought what did John
[28:53] see all right let's go on over to number
[28:55] two brotherr we quoted number one course
[28:59] around talk about how that one like unto
[29:01] the son of man who was this his bride
[29:04] one like watch how the the Holiness of
[29:08] Jesus covering her has washed us from
[29:11] our sins with his own blood look the
[29:14] gospel that held the power and glory of
[29:18] God over the bride of Christ that's your
[29:20] golden girdle all right but now look at
[29:23] what that's that's the first one look at
[29:25] number two and see what he says which is
[29:28] the revelation of Jesus
[29:30] Christ paragraph 74 and also the 14th
[29:34] and 15th verses describes his Sevenfold
[29:37] Glory of his person oh it's beautiful
[29:40] when we see Christ in his
[29:43] Sevenfold
[29:46] personage of Sevenfold
[29:52] beings now you following him of his
[29:56] personage
[29:58] in his glorious
[30:00] Resurrection
[30:02] now you're going to have to hold a point
[30:05] there because they can't be a Sevenfold
[30:11] beings but the being can be divided into
[30:14] his into Sevenfold
[30:17] personage I gave that one this to where
[30:19] if somebody come along they get it and
[30:21] pick it up and say well well what about
[30:23] this you know all right we see Christ in
[30:26] his seven
[30:28] fold personage watch him now Sevenfold
[30:34] beings that looks like seven
[30:37] beings no it's like the Bible says about
[30:41] that there's what the spirit it's one
[30:44] Holy Spirit but the Bible says there
[30:46] seven
[30:47] spirits it's not seven spirits it's a
[30:50] manifestation of God in seven ways right
[30:54] so that's what I said about this these
[30:56] Sevenfold beings of his personage in his
[30:59] glorious Resurrection now that's what
[31:01] you're looking
[31:04] at that's what he says because it's the
[31:06] 15 14 15 you see him in that Sevenfold
[31:11] Glory all right look at the next
[31:14] one look at number three the patmas
[31:20] vision paragraph
[31:25] 171 now we're going to read the
[31:27] Sevenfold Glory of his person see it's
[31:30] one
[31:31] person not Sevenfold beings
[31:35] right it's one person made manifest in
[31:38] seven ways to cover the point right now
[31:42] watch He's seven things here he mentions
[31:47] his head his hair his eyes his feet his
[31:49] voice seven things he mentioned here the
[31:54] Sevenfold Glory of Jesus Christ and then
[31:57] he says now let me read it to you so he
[32:00] begins to read
[32:02] it and look what he gets to go on up
[32:05] because we'll get back to this in the
[32:07] message later what a
[32:09] vision what did he see
[32:12] here the Sevenfold Glory of his
[32:14] personage you know what did he
[32:17] see the
[32:21] glorified Son of
[32:23] God and
[32:26] Assemble
[32:29] you see why I emphasize the Son of
[32:31] God because it is not the son of man is
[32:34] one like the son of
[32:36] man falling back to see that that it's
[32:39] not me and you that's being made
[32:45] manifest it's God being made manifest in
[32:48] you and I Paul says what Christ in you
[32:52] the hope of glory that's right but it's
[32:54] a Sevenfold Glory we're not going to get
[32:56] into that part because that's going to
[32:57] be kind of hard to to
[33:00] follow because you got his face what and
[33:03] you got his hair
[33:05] what and and I I ask you to if you will
[33:09] to uh somebody to draw
[33:13] that you know of what you
[33:17] see because it it's got to be
[33:21] him but I I want to see the drawing that
[33:24] can come out of it feet like Bryce and
[33:28] all kind of things we ain't to that yet
[33:30] see we got to pick up something here
[33:33] this is in the the point of trying to
[33:36] understand it all right look what he
[33:38] gets
[33:39] to look what he says on the message of
[33:42] the Resurrection this is 3A the to the
[33:50] brothers and he's talking about he's on
[33:53] Alcatraz he's out here and all the
[33:55] things that happening he's on the Lord's
[33:57] day looking over the water maybe God
[34:00] loving his see her and he said I heard
[34:03] the voice of many
[34:05] Waters and when uh voice of trumpet and
[34:10] when I turned to seea I saw s and golden
[34:12] candles and the one standing in the
[34:14] midst of them lik un to the son of
[34:17] man
[34:19] glorified
[34:23] state right glorified state
[34:27] so this is just not seeing us in uh you
[34:31] get over to chapter two and chapter 3
[34:36] and then you'll see about us being on
[34:39] Earth but this is showing us there and
[34:43] showing him in
[34:46] us the glorified Son of
[34:51] God that's why it says it's like unto
[34:53] the son of man because it is not the son
[34:56] of man
[34:58] man it is the
[35:02] bride she can be the son of man yeah we
[35:05] we'll go there amen but you got to hold
[35:08] it in to a point and and you know I hope
[35:11] you're you're at least thinking with
[35:14] me but he saw him in a glorified
[35:18] State look at the next one number four
[35:22] patma Vision paragraph
[35:25] 53 or page 53 excuse me Church age book
[35:29] there he stands one like unto the son of
[35:33] man as the jewel is beautified by the
[35:36] mounting of the ring watch so is he
[35:40] glorified in the midst of the
[35:45] churches it is the Lord's Day John sees
[35:48] him standing not as a priest but as the
[35:51] coming judge the finish a glorified
[35:55] state so now now when John is being
[35:58] shown on patmas he's showing the bride
[36:02] already in a glorified condition
[36:07] amen I said that may be a little bit
[36:10] trickier or you're thinking but we'll do
[36:12] our best to try to back up on it later
[36:14] because see then you go to chapter 2 and
[36:17] chapter 3 and you see the bad things
[36:19] about the church ages and the thing but
[36:21] you also see the good
[36:24] right right what's your point brother
[36:27] Dale he's showing us in chapter
[36:32] one already into what he sees us to
[36:40] be the
[36:41] glorified Son of
[36:44] God the
[36:48] body the body that he inhabits
[36:53] right see then it's not the body of
[36:56] Jesus that you're looking at
[36:59] right it's the bride amen which is what
[37:04] his body I thought that's what we
[37:06] believe the scripture said you know that
[37:09] we were his body and that he was the
[37:13] head all right and seeing that it's in a
[37:17] glorified
[37:21] State look at the next
[37:24] one page 52 fision number
[37:29] five How Deeply moving and inspiring was
[37:32] the appearing of Jesus to
[37:35] John
[37:37] what he has no problem with saying Jesus
[37:39] to John because that's what I've been
[37:41] talking about if you've been thinking
[37:43] I've been talking about a bride I'm I'm
[37:45] talking about Jesus
[37:49] CU who was in exile for the cause of the
[37:52] word and behold the Living Word
[37:57] now stands before
[37:59] him what an Illuminating
[38:02] Vision forever descriptive
[38:05] attribute has a
[38:09] significance what a
[38:11] revelation of his glorious
[38:15] being look what he thinks about himself
[38:18] I mean thinks about
[38:20] us look what he thinks about
[38:23] you that he would start off in the book
[38:26] of re rations talking about
[38:30] you and who you
[38:34] are sure then he has to drop back and
[38:37] take Earthly things but that's that's no
[38:40] problem it's just seeing his glorious
[38:44] being but seeing it where it's
[38:49] at you understand why he's a saying one
[38:52] like unto the son of man now we're going
[38:54] to get a couple of scriptures in just a
[38:56] minute we're going to go with something
[38:58] to try to understand but I want you to
[39:01] follow me of what I'm saying whether you
[39:03] agree with me or not that's up to you
[39:06] because I can't make you
[39:10] agree but what did John
[39:15] see before did I tell you anything I
[39:19] want you to know who I
[39:22] am and just stand there and listen now
[39:26] cuz I'm going to show
[39:28] you who I am and where I'm
[39:34] at and he showed seven golden
[39:37] candlesticks that would be enough to see
[39:39] the bride of Christ because you could
[39:40] take those the prophet did and preach
[39:42] great lengthy messages on the the
[39:44] lampstands and what they meant and a
[39:46] different
[39:49] thing but then he saw one in the midst
[39:51] of the seven golden candles sck like
[39:54] unto the son of man when do we get to
[39:56] that descriptive part of him that he was
[39:58] saying just now about the Glorious
[40:00] things of the that any little thing has
[40:03] a has a lot of meaning to
[40:05] it his hair like wool his face white his
[40:11] you
[40:12] know but what I want you to think
[40:17] about
[40:20] symbols John is shown in symbols
[40:25] right
[40:27] The Book of Revelations is written in
[40:32] symbols that's why it won't say the son
[40:34] of man it'll say one like to the son of
[40:37] man it's a symbol that has to be and it
[40:41] took a prophet to understand those
[40:44] symbols for us to be able to follow it
[40:47] see now this is not I want to make sure
[40:51] you follow me where then and I can use
[40:53] these two
[40:55] scriptures this is not seeing the flesh
[40:58] man of Jesus
[41:01] Christ but this is you know his
[41:05] body while he was here on Earth else it
[41:08] would not have said one like unto the
[41:11] son of man it would have said the son of
[41:13] man all right but saying like means that
[41:17] it's
[41:20] another form of the same person
[41:25] right all
[41:28] right similar
[41:30] resemblance corresponding are the same
[41:33] form appearance that's the word
[41:36] like but now for just a
[41:41] moment I want you to think with me
[41:44] because this is very valuable to
[41:47] understand the symbols the forms and the
[41:50] things the prophet tells us the
[41:54] symbols you know
[41:57] nobody could tell us those
[41:58] symbols they had them all messed up even
[42:01] brother brandham before God revealed it
[42:03] said you know it said about that arrows
[42:05] of love you know shooting a little Cupid
[42:07] riding
[42:10] along until God revealed
[42:13] it all right now what I want you to
[42:17] think with me a
[42:19] minute about this form of the son of man
[42:24] or one lik un to the son of
[42:27] man and and follow
[42:30] it in the scriptures to where we can get
[42:32] an
[42:34] understanding so go ahead with number
[42:36] six brothers which is Daniel 3 and
[42:39] 25 now watch these two
[42:44] scriptures and you'll understand what
[42:47] I'm talking
[42:49] about because it can be it will be two
[42:53] different or whatever you're looking at
[42:57] forms will be
[43:00] used and that's what we got to get to to
[43:03] understand that in the Book of
[43:05] Revelation you're seeing God in another
[43:08] form a bodily form which is the Bride of
[43:11] Jesus Christ right
[43:14] all that's the form it's into John on
[43:18] pmas so now watch what he saying Daniel
[43:21] 3:25 he said he answered and said lo I
[43:23] see four men loose walk in the midst of
[43:27] the fire and they have no hurt and the
[43:30] form of the fourth is like the Son of
[43:32] God right and you know the story how the
[43:36] three Hebrew children were cast into the
[43:37] fiery furnace you know and and the
[43:39] things and you know it killed the people
[43:41] that throw them in and and all of the
[43:44] story and and then who is it
[43:46] Nebuchadnezzar comes up and you know
[43:49] he's looking down in there the next day
[43:51] and and he looks down at it and he said
[43:54] how many did we throw in in they said we
[43:57] throw three in he says uh 1 2 3
[44:05] 4 and he says they're not hurt because
[44:08] the Bible emphasizes it it's not
[44:12] hurt so now we know for
[44:16] certainty that God had to been the
[44:19] fourth man right amen
[44:21] right I mean that ought to be sensible
[44:25] the fourth man was God himself amen
[44:27] right all right now to look down and see
[44:30] him not
[44:32] burning that's what emphasizing have no
[44:35] hurt
[44:37] see by not you know if he if he didn't
[44:40] even see the Fourth
[44:43] Man Nebuchadnezzar would have known
[44:47] something Supernatural was taking place
[44:51] right right had he not even seen the
[44:54] Fourth
[44:54] Man
[44:56] he knew that something was
[45:00] protecting
[45:02] amen
[45:05] these and how would he come up with what
[45:07] he
[45:08] come and said the form is like the Son
[45:14] of
[45:16] God now this is a heathen
[45:19] King this is not a Jewish rabbi or a
[45:22] high priest right that was supposed
[45:26] known about the coming down of God the
[45:29] condescending and the the Loos the theop
[45:32] the thing coming down from the
[45:35] beginning this is a heathen
[45:44] King and
[45:46] look he said he's got a formed to him
[45:51] right amen like I said if he hadn't seen
[45:55] nothing he would have know something
[45:57] Supernatural was taking place but he
[46:00] sees the
[46:01] form of a
[46:05] man he knows that that form of that
[46:10] man has to be God
[46:14] himself now
[46:16] watch and if you can see
[46:24] God you you you can't see
[46:28] God we'll get to that in a
[46:33] minute he knew that if he could see
[46:36] something it would have to be the Son of
[46:41] God because he knew he couldn't see
[46:46] God all right father with me
[46:50] now why would he jump over now go ahead
[46:53] with number seven and let's read this
[46:56] one from
[47:00] Daniel and he said I saw in the night
[47:02] vision behold one like the son of man
[47:06] came with the clouds of heaven and he
[47:08] came to the Ancient of Days and brought
[47:10] him near why would he switch over and
[47:12] call him one lik and the son of
[47:22] man why would it emphasize one liking a
[47:25] son of man
[47:29] you already got a pretty good story
[47:30] going by seeing the Fourth Man in the
[47:33] fire and realizing the Fourth Man In The
[47:35] Fire has to be God and if you can see it
[47:39] it would have to be the Son of
[47:43] God now you know the story of Daniel 7
[47:47] and you know what it all covers we won't
[47:49] have time to go into it but we'll just
[47:51] state it you know that's going to the
[47:54] white Throne judgment and the Ancient of
[47:56] Days and the things that sit and the
[47:59] bride is sitting with
[48:04] him are we right y right is revelation
[48:07] what 17 and and Daniel 7 supposed to
[48:11] both be the white Throne judgment I
[48:13] believe I'm right on those
[48:17] scriptures are you following me
[48:22] right when he sees one in comparison
[48:27] with his looking at it he says he's the
[48:30] son of
[48:35] God because if I can see it it's got to
[48:37] be God and I can only see four down
[48:39] there I got them counted one 2 three
[48:41] four you
[48:42] know but I'd like for you to answer me
[48:45] one question what happened to the fourth
[48:51] man I know the three Hebrew children
[48:53] were taken out of the FY furnace
[48:56] but what happened to the fourth man just
[48:59] a little
[49:04] point but here you're dealing with a
[49:07] multitude of
[49:08] people one like the son of man came with
[49:11] the clouds of heaven
[49:17] right Y and we're to sit on the throne
[49:20] with him right the white
[49:24] throne
[49:26] you get the point what I'm
[49:28] driving Nebuchadnezzar sees one called
[49:31] him Son of God he sees many he called
[49:34] him son of
[49:41] man right
[49:45] right does that ring a
[49:48] bell he sees one and he says Son of
[49:52] God he sees many coming to the white
[49:55] throne judgment you know to sit on the
[49:57] Judgment with him the clouds of
[50:03] heaven and he
[50:05] says one like the son of
[50:09] man trying to explain Revelations
[50:17] 1 that if in Revelations
[50:21] 1 he sees one like unto the son of man a
[50:26] multiple form but it was one
[50:33] body this don't seem to be hitting right
[50:36] tonight don't worry about it I'll preach
[50:37] it again next Wednesday iin
[50:40] concern I'm just telling you you're
[50:43] going to have to
[50:48] think it's not to go to church and Glory
[50:51] Hallelujah we're doing good and
[50:52] everything feels good and give us a
[50:54] piece of ice we'll run down through I
[50:55] get you some chill bumps or whatever you
[50:56] want to do
[50:59] right I thought it was the word of God
[51:01] we were supposed to be concerned
[51:07] with I thought we were to talk about the
[51:09] word of God and I
[51:11] thought the word of God was the
[51:14] Believers that was in the book that's
[51:16] what I thought that's right amen do you
[51:19] need that
[51:20] quote the Believers in the
[51:23] book they are the word
[51:27] amen John sees it over on patmas already
[51:31] transformed into a glorified state
[51:35] right all totally finished
[51:39] y all right I'll go on with it if I have
[51:42] to I'll drop back write your questions
[51:45] out about
[51:47] it notice now this one Daniel sees in
[51:52] chapter
[51:53] 3 and he only sees one
[51:57] man you know with the three Hebrew
[52:00] children and in Daniel 7 he sees a large
[52:04] group of
[52:07] people this has got to be the same
[52:10] person
[52:14] right
[52:17] right if it's not then you got two
[52:22] Gods so it's got to be the same person
[52:27] in other words the same person made
[52:30] manifest in another
[52:38] form and if Nicodemus could see one and
[52:42] say son of
[52:45] God and Daniel could see many and say
[52:47] son of man it's got to be the same
[52:52] person throughout the Bible
[52:56] God has revealed himself in many
[53:01] forms will you go with
[53:04] me he's the uh son of man Son of God Son
[53:09] of David alpha and omega beginning and
[53:12] the ending Jehovah Gyra Jehovah graa all
[53:15] of the many different things that he has
[53:18] revealed himself in that form but it's
[53:22] the same
[53:24] God
[53:27] amen now if you don't follow this line
[53:29] you're sure going to miss when we get to
[53:31] the Sevenfold Glory of his person where
[53:33] the face is white and the hair is white
[53:35] and the Feet's Bryce
[53:44] and see Revelations 1 and3 says one like
[53:49] un the son of
[53:51] man see then that would be God in
[53:54] another form
[53:58] I
[54:00] morphe be one of the forms that he
[54:03] reveals himself to
[54:10] us and
[54:12] watch what I want you to see is that God
[54:16] has taken many forms to reveal himself
[54:21] right that's right now none of the forms
[54:25] reveal you and
[54:28] I so it a't no need to even thinking
[54:30] about H like wool and what this is and
[54:32] what that can be get it all out of your
[54:34] mind get the feet of BR get all that out
[54:36] of your mind and just leave it
[54:40] alone because all of the forms that God
[54:43] has had has been revealing
[54:48] himself right throughout the
[54:54] word but it's the same
[54:59] person making himself
[55:01] known same person making itself
[55:05] known
[55:07] now just for a minute and I'll back up I
[55:09] know I'm going to have to Sunday anyway
[55:12] I mean Wednesday next
[55:15] Wednesday but now remember what we said
[55:19] so go ahead brother and pull up 7
[55:22] a which is Exodus 33 and you'll see why
[55:25] I use this scripture all
[55:30] right and he said thou can not see my
[55:37] face for th shall no man see me and
[55:45] live now get the
[55:48] point Moses had seen him in many
[55:53] ways many forms
[55:56] many things happened the burning bush
[55:59] and all kind of
[56:05] experiences he' talked to him the Bible
[56:08] said what lip to ear I believe is that
[56:10] right and it had said something about
[56:11] seeing him face to
[56:15] face but yet he says Moses you can't see
[56:19] my face and live
[56:23] amen so Moses said okay is any other way
[56:27] I can do it he says go in over there and
[56:29] stand in that Cliff to the Rock remember
[56:31] it was the same Rock to me is the same
[56:34] rock that Moses smoked where the water
[56:36] came out of I don't have no problem with
[56:39] that go stand where you stood in the
[56:42] revelation of your faith and the things
[56:44] has taken place that you have done and
[56:47] seen and all of the miraculous things
[56:50] that's took place stand in
[56:53] that why can't you and I do that tonight
[56:56] folks you mean what God has revealed to
[56:59] you and
[57:01] I our children could confound the
[57:04] scholars and things right over the
[57:08] Simplicity of the Gospel that they've
[57:13] heard it's ain't been no this Fly by
[57:16] Night
[57:18] time but you understand what I'm getting
[57:20] at Moses said Lord I'd like to see
[57:23] you
[57:25] he wasn't meaning to see him in his
[57:28] glory of of parting the Red Sea he
[57:31] wasn't seeing him in his glory of of the
[57:34] the water and bringing it or the the
[57:36] great things or the the the the snakes
[57:40] you know and and all of
[57:43] that he wanted to see
[57:47] him and God says you can look at my back
[57:51] part going right on down through from
[57:53] where we just readz we read it when we
[57:55] started you can see my back
[57:58] part but said you can't see my
[58:02] face now what does he mean by
[58:07] that oh we've got it all figured out one
[58:11] day there's a man walked on the shores
[58:12] of Galilee and we looked up and seen his
[58:17] face and we see Jesus there's his face
[58:21] there's his
[58:23] face
[58:28] I'd like to quote a statement I've got
[58:30] in my pocket here I'll use it later but
[58:33] you know that brother randam says
[58:34] there's no way you can see God without
[58:36] God in
[58:38] you now that'll be on down the road a
[58:41] while said you can't see God without God
[58:44] in
[58:45] you all right he said well Moses and him
[58:49] no they didn't see
[58:51] God they saw the form he was in
[58:55] right come on are you with me they
[58:58] didn't see God they saw the form he was
[59:00] in where was he he was in the form of
[59:02] the
[59:03] Whirlwind
[59:06] right they seen his form but they
[59:09] couldn't see his
[59:11] face because no
[59:15] man can see God or ever has seen
[59:21] God now don't jump on down with your
[59:24] mind and say his son had declared him
[59:27] because we got a lot in here to go down
[59:30] hang on with us all right look at number
[59:33] eight and let's see if you can
[59:35] comprehend this
[59:37] scripture and see what it's talking
[59:40] about 1 Timothy 6:15 and 16 it's talking
[59:44] about Jesus Christ
[59:46] right which in his times he shall show
[59:49] who is the blessed and only
[59:52] potentate the king of kings and Lord of
[59:55] lords who only hath immortality dwelling
[1:00:00] in the light which no man can approach
[1:00:03] unto
[1:00:04] y
[1:00:07] yep whom no man has
[1:00:11] seen nor
[1:00:14] can
[1:00:22] see now where you going
[1:00:25] well we'll use that one at that point
[1:00:27] let's use number nine which is 1 John
[1:00:31] 4:12 go ahead with number
[1:00:33] nine no man has seen God at any
[1:00:43] time yeah but but brother Dale I I
[1:00:46] thought we could see God you're missing
[1:00:49] the
[1:00:51] point you can't see God
[1:00:56] you see the form he takes to reveal
[1:01:01] himself to you
[1:01:08] right why is it you can't see God go
[1:01:11] ahead with the next one number 10 and it
[1:01:13] explains
[1:01:16] it and look who's
[1:01:23] talking but the hour cometh and now is
[1:01:26] when the true worshipper shall worship
[1:01:28] who's
[1:01:29] talking is that Jesus to the little
[1:01:31] woman at the
[1:01:32] wh you
[1:01:35] know is that who it is it's Jesus
[1:01:37] talking to to the little woman you know
[1:01:40] but the hour cometh and now is when the
[1:01:42] true worshipper shall worship the father
[1:01:44] in spirit and in truth for the father
[1:01:46] seeketh such to worship him God is a
[1:01:50] spirit and they that worship Him must
[1:01:53] worship Him in Sp spirit and in
[1:01:58] truth now can you put it
[1:02:03] together this eternal
[1:02:06] Immortal everlasting
[1:02:13] God can't be
[1:02:19] seen never been seen of no
[1:02:22] man now wait a minute mot come
[1:02:26] on I just got to explaining
[1:02:31] that that Moses said I'd love to see
[1:02:34] you he says Moses you can't see my face
[1:02:37] and
[1:02:39] live he says nobody can't do
[1:02:43] that he said go stand in that rock and
[1:02:46] I'll pass by
[1:02:47] you and said you'll see the back part
[1:02:50] and said that'll be my form that I let
[1:02:52] you see
[1:02:59] God can't be
[1:03:03] seen all
[1:03:06] right cuz God is a
[1:03:11] spirit the spirit can't be
[1:03:13] seen the spirit has to manifest itself
[1:03:17] Amen in some way amen for it to be able
[1:03:21] to be
[1:03:22] seen all right
[1:03:24] so you go back before the foundation of
[1:03:26] the world when he was self-existing
[1:03:32] now you know how I've brought that down
[1:03:34] so don't run off with the wrong way on
[1:03:38] it God is a
[1:03:41] spirit but you know what brother randam
[1:03:43] gave and I'll got it in my notes for
[1:03:44] later brother R said he's a spiritual
[1:03:49] being he said he never did have hands
[1:03:52] and things like we have until Jesus
[1:03:55] that's
[1:03:57] right but he said when he's coming down
[1:04:00] in
[1:04:01] condescending that it was the logos the
[1:04:04] theophany the Son of
[1:04:07] God and he says that theop has greater
[1:04:11] hands greater eyes and greater
[1:04:16] ears so don't ever think about it you
[1:04:19] know I've been against it from the
[1:04:20] beginning we think God is a spirit he's
[1:04:22] just a spirit he just he
[1:04:25] just he just blows everywhere and
[1:04:29] just no the prophet said it we'll bring
[1:04:32] it to you he's not like the
[1:04:37] wind he said God is a
[1:04:41] being
[1:04:43] amen but what about a being that can't
[1:04:46] be seen unless he transforms
[1:04:49] himself
[1:04:53] right unless he takes a form he can't be
[1:04:59] seen why because we're in this world
[1:05:03] he's from that world that's the best way
[1:05:05] of saying it World whatever you want to
[1:05:07] call
[1:05:09] it you said well what was he before the
[1:05:12] world oh I guess he just floating
[1:05:15] wind no no no I don't believe that never
[1:05:19] have taught nothing like that cuz I've
[1:05:22] always taught that I believe that God is
[1:05:24] a
[1:05:27] being it speaks of his hands his head
[1:05:30] his heart his hair his it speaks of a
[1:05:33] lot of things about
[1:05:36] him but just remember you can't see him
[1:05:40] right and that's why I've always taught
[1:05:42] you what I believe that when we get over
[1:05:45] there on that other side we'll see
[1:05:53] Jesus
[1:05:56] because God can't be
[1:05:59] seen we'll never enter that world where
[1:06:03] he came
[1:06:05] from that's the best words I got I don't
[1:06:07] have anything
[1:06:09] else we can't enter into that realm that
[1:06:12] atmosphere that forms or whatever is out
[1:06:16] there he's condescending this way
[1:06:21] amen he was self-existing
[1:06:25] yeah see God is a spirit now watch what
[1:06:28] your Prophet had to say go ahead with
[1:06:30] number uh number
[1:06:33] 11 let's just let the prophet answer it
[1:06:36] questions and answers on
[1:06:38] Hebrews uh
[1:06:44] 57101 wait a minute I got these
[1:06:46] backwards I'll have to swap it I know I
[1:06:48] did a while
[1:06:49] ago uh yeah okay we're right I look
[1:06:54] looking for that 456 now look the body
[1:06:58] and watch God is the spirit you how many
[1:07:02] understands that say amen amen
[1:07:04] amen what do you understand is the
[1:07:08] spirit you understand that the spirit
[1:07:10] can't be
[1:07:12] seen you understand that a spirit has to
[1:07:14] manifest itself in a form to be able to
[1:07:16] be seen amen now do you believe that see
[1:07:19] that goes on a little more thinking
[1:07:21] right
[1:07:22] look how many understand that say amen
[1:07:25] God is a spirit Jesus is a
[1:07:29] man and Jesus was God made
[1:07:35] flesh Jesus was he could never we could
[1:07:40] never see
[1:07:41] God he's a spirit you can't see Spirit
[1:07:46] no man has seen God at any time no man
[1:07:50] couldn't see God and let me say this you
[1:07:54] never seen
[1:07:55] me now he's trying to describe it right
[1:07:59] you've never seen me in all your
[1:08:02] life you never will see me that's right
[1:08:06] you see this body that declares this
[1:08:08] person that's in here amen now this body
[1:08:12] doesn't have eternal life but the spirit
[1:08:16] has eternal life this body will go
[1:08:20] back but it couldn't but it'll come
[1:08:23] forth again in its likeness just like a
[1:08:26] grain of wheat goes into the ground but
[1:08:28] are you listening now
[1:08:31] yes no
[1:08:33] man can see God because God is a spirit
[1:08:36] he said you've never seen me he said you
[1:08:38] see the body I inhabit right
[1:08:41] right now you say but wait just a minute
[1:08:43] now we got scripture yeah okay we'll get
[1:08:45] to them later but we'll go we'll bring
[1:08:47] it out they said Philip said show us the
[1:08:50] father that it
[1:08:52] satisfies he said Philip have I been so
[1:08:54] long we and said you've seen me you've
[1:08:56] seen the father amen
[1:08:59] amen now what's he
[1:09:01] mean when he was this one that said over
[1:09:04] in John that we read over there a minute
[1:09:06] ago talking to the lady that God is a
[1:09:10] spirit he's the one that put all these
[1:09:12] other scriptures into the scripture that
[1:09:15] says nobody can see
[1:09:16] God now what's he
[1:09:22] meaning
[1:09:25] he's
[1:09:26] saying
[1:09:29] Phillip I am that almighty
[1:09:33] God but you'll never see me the way
[1:09:36] you're wanting to see
[1:09:38] me that because I'm a
[1:09:43] spirit but said the the son will declare
[1:09:46] it we'll get to that scripture the son
[1:09:50] will declare
[1:09:52] it no notice it says son would Son of
[1:09:56] God is what's going to declare
[1:10:00] him so he says
[1:10:03] now have I been so long with you if you
[1:10:07] seen me you've seen the father
[1:10:11] that's now if I don't get far enough to
[1:10:13] find this quote let me state it when he
[1:10:17] saying you've never seen me in all your
[1:10:20] life you'll never see me you see the
[1:10:23] body that
[1:10:25] declares this person that's in
[1:10:29] here
[1:10:31] right so Jesus is
[1:10:35] right he said if you seen
[1:10:42] me he said when you see the father one
[1:10:45] day you'll know who I
[1:10:49] am because that body is what has to
[1:10:52] declare him
[1:10:54] amen so you see what it's talking about
[1:10:57] Jesus is
[1:10:59] right no man is seen God at any time
[1:11:02] God's the spirit oh that's just
[1:11:06] all and Jesus said if you've seen me
[1:11:08] you've seen the
[1:11:12] father so he had to be talking about the
[1:11:16] human element fleshly part that was
[1:11:18] standing there
[1:11:21] right cuz I believe when we get up to
[1:11:23] Glory it's not going to be a little halo
[1:11:26] over here and a little Pillar of Fire
[1:11:28] back here a little Cloud around
[1:11:32] here it's going to be
[1:11:36] Jesus because then we'll know who he
[1:11:39] is because Jesus is the only body that
[1:11:42] God ever had that's right amen now come
[1:11:45] on you said well wait a minute you want
[1:11:47] know only body God ever had the Only
[1:11:49] Natural Body God ever had we're not a
[1:11:51] natural
[1:11:52] body
[1:11:54] we are a multiplied form an amorphia of
[1:11:58] change into a multiple form body we're
[1:12:01] not just one
[1:12:05] body so the Bible's still right God is a
[1:12:12] spirit and there's no way to see
[1:12:15] it let's see if we can get this other
[1:12:17] one then we'll
[1:12:20] quit uh go ahead with the next one which
[1:12:22] is Shalom
[1:12:24] number
[1:12:26] 12 which is Shalom preached in
[1:12:29] 1964 roll it on up because you can get
[1:12:31] into all the other and read it see what
[1:12:33] it is I gave you that to where you can
[1:12:34] have it and now as when we are die you
[1:12:40] know when we die like in the physical
[1:12:43] body as we are now we are separated from
[1:12:46] one
[1:12:48] another now listen to
[1:12:50] him but it's really this body is the
[1:12:54] only thing that identifies us to each
[1:12:59] other
[1:13:00] amen so now God is a spirit can't be
[1:13:03] seen I can't see you I see the body you
[1:13:07] inhabit the body you inhabit declares
[1:13:11] unto
[1:13:12] us all right come on and what but it's
[1:13:16] really this body is the only thing that
[1:13:18] identifies us to each other because we
[1:13:21] are bound in five senses C tast fi smell
[1:13:23] here and as long as
[1:13:26] we can see or feel one another w we have
[1:13:30] evidence that we're
[1:13:32] here if you're blind and can't and can't
[1:13:35] see then you can feel one another you
[1:13:38] know because what it Earthly Des senses
[1:13:41] declares one another right P it on
[1:13:46] up raise raise this and on up
[1:13:51] to but really frankly
[1:13:54] we've never seen each
[1:13:56] other did you know that we've never seen
[1:14:00] we one
[1:14:02] another you hear something speaking out
[1:14:04] of a body hear that it impersonates
[1:14:07] what's it's on the inside so then when
[1:14:11] we talk to each other we're really not
[1:14:14] talking to the
[1:14:18] body it's the spirit
[1:14:22] inside
[1:14:23] but the body is the thing that
[1:14:26] identifies the spirit that's on the
[1:14:32] inside therefore when we speak to each
[1:14:35] other we are quickly can understand
[1:14:38] right away whether we are Christians are
[1:14:45] not come on because there's a fellowship
[1:14:49] in the spirit that we talk from amen
[1:14:57] I know I say it this way you'll flop it
[1:14:59] back home and so I'll go ahead and say
[1:15:00] it anyway you know that a lot of times
[1:15:03] I'm just the kind of a person that uh
[1:15:06] you talk to me it's hard to find out
[1:15:08] where I'm
[1:15:09] at and I understand that certain brother
[1:15:13] I won't call his name we had differed
[1:15:14] with each other years ago he said if I
[1:15:17] can get with sister Dale I can find out
[1:15:19] what brother Dale
[1:15:22] believes
[1:15:24] we said I'll never find out from him you
[1:15:26] remember
[1:15:32] that you see you'll never find out
[1:15:34] what's on the inside of this
[1:15:42] man because inside of this man is
[1:15:45] something trying to talk to
[1:15:48] you if you don't have the same Spirit of
[1:15:52] the one that's within
[1:15:54] here then you don't understand what I'm
[1:15:56] talking about
[1:15:59] amen that's why I understand people
[1:16:01] don't understand
[1:16:04] me I don't have no
[1:16:09] problems but I'm just saying if we got
[1:16:11] the same Spirit what's the problem
[1:16:14] right
[1:16:17] right now you go talk to a
[1:16:20] trinitarian you know right real quick
[1:16:22] that Spirit you talking to two ain't the
[1:16:23] right Spirit
[1:16:27] right
[1:16:29] okay watch what he says and therefore
[1:16:31] when we speak to each other we are
[1:16:34] quickly can understand right away
[1:16:36] whether we are Christians or not because
[1:16:39] there's a fellowship in the spirit we
[1:16:41] talk from you see that it vibrates on
[1:16:45] one another that whether we are
[1:16:47] Christians or not therefore we have
[1:16:50] never seen each other
[1:16:54] remember brother bandam saying that
[1:16:55] there was like a vibration come to him
[1:16:57] and he knew it was the right Spirit or
[1:16:59] not come to him and you ever talk to
[1:17:01] somebody and you just didn't you just
[1:17:04] something just just didn't feel
[1:17:07] right you
[1:17:10] know well there's one thing about it
[1:17:12] it's either God or the devil one so you
[1:17:15] know it's it's one of the other no
[1:17:20] problems but just for a second cuz you
[1:17:23] know how I
[1:17:24] preach I'll end this part we'll take it
[1:17:27] up next
[1:17:30] Wednesday I believe
[1:17:32] Jesus the
[1:17:35] flesh was a
[1:17:38] creation and if that's the only body
[1:17:41] that God ever
[1:17:42] had only body he ever will
[1:17:46] have because that's a one membered body
[1:17:49] it's not talking about the bride of
[1:17:51] Christ being his body because we are but
[1:17:54] we're a multiple form of
[1:17:56] that that's why I was trying to get you
[1:17:59] to see where he said Son of God and Son
[1:18:01] of
[1:18:02] Man see there in Daniel because one is
[1:18:05] the Son of God in a one form the other
[1:18:08] is a multiple
[1:18:09] form all
[1:18:14] right you see I believe when that baby
[1:18:16] was born there 2,000 years ago we called
[1:18:20] Jesus I believe what the prophet said
[1:18:22] that in body he was a
[1:18:26] man he say in Soul he was
[1:18:30] God then he'll say in spirit he was
[1:18:34] God I believe
[1:18:40] that you see that way you don't have
[1:18:42] eternal
[1:18:45] sunship and a mess up in your
[1:18:48] Doctrine because that way you got it
[1:18:50] right when Jesus said if you seen me you
[1:18:52] seen the
[1:18:55] father there's not another body anywhere
[1:18:58] can manifest God like that I don't care
[1:19:01] who we are who we think we are and what
[1:19:03] we think we're doing right it won't
[1:19:07] work see when that baby was
[1:19:12] born the
[1:19:14] soul and the spirit of almighty God came
[1:19:18] into that body
[1:19:21] amen and walked in that body upon this
[1:19:24] Earth that body is my
[1:19:30] brother that
[1:19:33] body is my
[1:19:35] Advocate amen that body is my
[1:19:42] healer that body gave his life to be a
[1:19:50] sacrifice but that body is all will ever
[1:19:53] see of
[1:19:55] God because he declares himself to be
[1:20:00] there and see that does away with all
[1:20:02] you River Jordans and the doctrines of
[1:20:04] people you know that he wasn't God until
[1:20:06] this and then he became God and the
[1:20:09] Bible said he was
[1:20:11] born
[1:20:13] Emmanuel I've got a quote at home laying
[1:20:15] a that we talk about Body Spirit and
[1:20:18] soul of Jesus
[1:20:21] Christ
[1:20:23] because you see God can't be
[1:20:28] seen that Spirit can manifest itself in
[1:20:32] a form and you can look at that form and
[1:20:35] see whether it's God or not because it
[1:20:39] will always follow the
[1:20:42] word that
[1:20:46] soul that comes into us by a new
[1:20:49] birth will always declare God God as to
[1:20:54] being the one true amen and living
[1:20:59] God see it takes all of these forms for
[1:21:03] us to understand let's
[1:21:06] stand
[1:21:07] right takes all these
[1:21:11] forms for us to
[1:21:13] understand many
[1:21:16] forms that he has with the one God
[1:21:21] Amen
[1:21:23] the one God that walked the shores of
[1:21:25] Galilee and there in that man he said if
[1:21:27] You' seen me you've seen the father
[1:21:29] Phillip he said because inside of this
[1:21:32] body is the soul and the spirit the very
[1:21:36] life the very being the very character
[1:21:38] the very nature the very all of God is
[1:21:42] here standing before
[1:21:44] you and that way you're not
[1:21:48] Oneness because you see that Son of God
[1:21:50] had to start way back y and work its way
[1:21:53] down to
[1:21:57] there to be the right
[1:22:01] one can you see that you can't see
[1:22:05] God but yet if he'll just declare
[1:22:08] himself if he'll just manifest himself
[1:22:11] you'll see what we got brother 138p
[1:22:14] spiral book 138p spiral book anybody got
[1:22:16] a need the alar is
[1:22:21] open
[1:22:23] you see that sun declares brings him out
[1:22:26] into the
[1:22:27] open to where you and I can see
[1:22:32] him Moses was able to see a form of
[1:22:36] God in the burning
[1:22:40] bush he was able to see him in many
[1:22:44] forms but he wanted to see him face to
[1:22:46] face in other words he wanted to see
[1:22:50] him more real than anything thing it had
[1:22:53] ever been
[1:22:56] before he says you can't do
[1:23:00] it see we are of one world and he's
[1:23:03] another
[1:23:04] one he had to condescend into this world
[1:23:08] to be able to give us an
[1:23:11] understanding of what it'll be like the
[1:23:13] Bible says when we'll get over there
[1:23:15] we'll have a body like unto his but just
[1:23:17] remember it won't be his body it be mine
[1:23:19] then it's talking about my body that
[1:23:21] I'll be living in
[1:23:24] right my body I'll be living in your
[1:23:27] body you'll be living
[1:23:29] in and see that's why we're a new
[1:23:31] creation that's right go ahead
[1:23:36] am my hope is buil on nothing less than
[1:23:42] Jesus blood and
[1:23:45] righteous th dare not trust the sweetest

[1:27:23] sinking s all other ground is sinking
[1:27:29] s amen I just hope you'll go home and
[1:27:33] pray and say well you know maybe I'm not
[1:27:37] understanding but you'll open it up to
[1:27:39] where I can because I'm simply talking
[1:27:41] about one true and living God made
[1:27:44] manifest in a many membered form called
[1:27:46] The Bride of Jesus Christ and to see
[1:27:49] that we can understand why it talks of
[1:27:51] the things that it
[1:27:54] does you haven't never read the Bible to
[1:27:57] where you know it's I'm pretty sure it's
[1:28:00] in the songs of
[1:28:02] Solomon but he describes his little
[1:28:07] girlfriend you ever heard brother
[1:28:09] Brown's definition of his first
[1:28:14] girlfriend it was something like legs
[1:28:17] like a jbird something like a swan and
[1:28:22] neck like a swan how would you like to
[1:28:25] be described like a bunch of goats
[1:28:28] coming down off of a
[1:28:33] mountain well that'd be something would
[1:28:36] it you go around tell everybody in the
[1:28:37] country get get on Facebook my husband
[1:28:41] says I'm like a bunch of
[1:28:44] goats that's what God says about
[1:28:50] you see it's according ording to what
[1:28:52] your thinking
[1:28:55] is to them the most beautiful thing that
[1:28:58] David maybe could see was a bunch of
[1:29:01] goats coming down off of a
[1:29:05] hill he wasn't looking at him like a
[1:29:07] bunch of stinking bats and you know all
[1:29:09] kind of things he saw something
[1:29:13] beautiful read the songs of
[1:29:15] Solomon that'd be a good thought for you
[1:29:17] by the time we get into the next message
[1:29:20] read the songs of Solomon
[1:29:22] and listen to what it's talking about
[1:29:25] sometimes it's confusing because you
[1:29:26] can't hardly figure who's doing the
[1:29:28] talking but you
[1:29:30] know look and see how he describes
[1:29:34] it gowake my
[1:29:38] love said he lookth through the
[1:29:41] lattice and says my heart failed cuz I
[1:29:45] think it used there something
[1:29:49] else you see we look at the Bible as
[1:29:52] being what we think is the word of
[1:29:55] God but do we look at it as talking
[1:29:58] about us and what God thinks about
[1:30:00] us and his description of
[1:30:04] us and his description of you in
[1:30:06] Revelations one is you got a white
[1:30:12] face and you got hair like
[1:30:18] wool and you got just and feet like br
[1:30:26] you know that's the most beautiful thing
[1:30:27] he could think of but it don't look too
[1:30:30] pretty to me that's why I ask you to
[1:30:32] draw
[1:30:35] it I don't look like a pretty
[1:30:41] woman I dare say brother Bob you better
[1:30:43] not go home and tell your wife that she
[1:30:45] looks like what brother Brandon said his
[1:30:47] first girlfriend look
[1:30:50] like
[1:30:53] right but to him it was
[1:30:56] beautiful you know right
[1:31:00] amen I've always got in trouble talking
[1:31:02] about my wife and I said if you got an
[1:31:05] old nag you always got a brag on that
[1:31:07] old horse cuz it ain't worth two
[1:31:09] cents but I said if you got a real good
[1:31:12] th bread then you don't go around all
[1:31:15] over the country bragging on her because
[1:31:17] everybody knows she's a th bread she
[1:31:20] said but you don't have to ref H to me
[1:31:22] as a
[1:31:24] horse well to me that's a beautiful
[1:31:28] picture got a lot of things involved in
[1:31:32] it never pray for Wade this weekend and
