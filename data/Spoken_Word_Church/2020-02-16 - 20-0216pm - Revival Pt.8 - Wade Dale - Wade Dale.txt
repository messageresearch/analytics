these individuals in this building and father the ones that are not born again may they be so thirsty at the end of this service father that they'll want more than anything this eternal life that you've been parted to us Lord truly it is a river that flows that river that we were thinking Lord this morning about the river that comes out from under the throne when this is all said and done there's gonna be a pure river run out from under the throne in that new city we're gonna be able to drink from that thing for eternity and we're gonna how it's unrestricted what a what a mighty God

they will accept it probably give us this day our daily bread and forgive us of our trespasses and be with us in the further man if service in Jesus name we ask amen Psalms 1 38 8 now we're still talking about revival and I had a little treat this morning I mean I'm doing triple duty today I had early this morning and speaking of men's breakfast for the United Methodist Church so I survived I lived through the whole thing so did they gym dads two brothers were there so the Methodist preacher that he talks about the whole time he was there and he he said he didn't know he didn't know I had it in me I said well it ain't me though I walk in the midst of trouble now what revived me and I did speak about revival to them because I want them to ever the whole world to see that that there needs to be an individual revival not a worldwide revival but an individual revival some thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of my enemies and thy right hand shall save me the Lord will perfect that which concerning me I like that the Lord will perfect that which concern if me now mercy O Lord and do it forever forsake not the works of thine own hand let's read Psalms 85 1 turn us o god of our salvation and caused on anger toward us to cease wilt thou be angry with us forever wilt thou draw out that anger to all generations remember this is David speaking wilt thou not revive us again that died people may rejoice in thee you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word you'll have to excuse me just a minute I've got a slow leak but take what take vitamin C I believe think so hey but vitamins these kind of hard to chew on vitamin nobody got that that's right slowly is trickling back okay huh she said take zinc I said that's kind of hard to swallow zinc of the metal okay let's get to the quote number one goodness gracious but take vitamin C it's good for your body it keeps you from having colds let's look at number one recognizing your day in this message brother Anthony we don't act this way all the time a lot of times on Sundays though we do recognize you entertaining this message the property god this is the prayer that I have on my refrigerator and I hope you put on yours God created me a revival let me be the revival let each one of us be the revival the revival in me make me Lord to hunger make me the thirst create in me Lord that what is needed in me let me from this hour on be thine more consecrated servant a better servant more blessed of you more able more humbler more kinder more willing to work more looking to the things that are positive and forgetting the things that are in the past and the negatives let me press toward the mark of the high calling of Christ amen amen that should be everybody's prayer that God created me a revival I was telling him this morning I've told you before but we we have spent all of our life waiting on somebody else to start a revival well if so and so we'll just if this person will just brother brother never said that he said created me revival let me be the revival the Welsh revival was the policeman on the corner when the man came up dead where's the wealth revival he said you're looking at it so let's stop looking and for this some great preacher too to come or some great person to raise up because we're gonna we see all the characteristics for the ones of you that haven't been here we're going to kind of go over it a little bit again look at number two the resurrection of Lazarus brother I'm said brother I feel real good right now what this church needs today is a good revival now as I was telling them this morning in the 1960s going to the Baptist Church there would be a banner up and it would usually be in June or July because that's when most people would come to church they wouldn't come when it's cold so they'd have a revival beginning on Sunday and the song leader would get up into Baptist Church you know how they do this you know they the song leader from the Baptist Church they do this he would sing revive us again Phil I see it just liked it Danny Brown filled his heart with I love mate so be rekindled with far from ball hallelujah on the go and you know you were that's enough free time doing this but that's the way it would be in it but know what it would be though that would fill the altars and then like someone said said they they'd preach you a fiery sermon and then they would then they dangle your soul over Hell like a weenie over a fire you know we don't want you to go to eternal hell so come to the altar that's not what a revival is nothing in the nothing in scripture are in definition says that a revival it's saving of souls that is not what it is a revival is just stirring up of what you already know about it's what's stirring up what you already have now though you cast the net it will grab some people Zachary black it will grab some people and bring them in but what did he do it brought brother Zach to a realization he didn't have what he thought he had that okay so then it brought him to a realization now he can start his own little revival and revive what has become inside of him so we're not saying that it was to not bring centers in they don't but it will if you become so intoxicated with God it's God like brother Daryl said it's got to pull people in but mainly a revival is it's a stirring up of what you already have as I told him this morning real simple the children of Israel under Joseph they were fine they weren't slaves Joseph said come into Egypt so they come into Egypt and after a length of time though what happens is it's kind of like the old adage brother Anthony if you want to if you want to boil a frog the frogs got to be alive before you can boil it because it releases poison kind of like a lobster so you take you excuse me you take the Frog and you don't boil the water and throw the frog in he'll jump straight out because it's hot we put him in there about 90 degrees when he's like in the pond and he's kind of kind of warm then you just keep turning the heat up and it'll absolutely cook that cook that poor frog and he'll never know he's dying that's what Satan has done to us he's put us in a lukewarm condition and he has started the heat and that's what he did with the children of Israel listen the children of Israel were the children of God so they didn't have to become the children of God they were already the children of God they just got caught in bondage and needed a revival listen it wasn't Moses that brought the revival the Bible tells you the people began to cry out when they realized they weren't just visitors in Egypt anymore that they were slaves and that's the way we are we must realize that we are the children of God but we can get caught in a place that we're caught in slavery and don't even know it sometimes but Satan keeps turning that heat up but being a child of God God will never let you die be a child of the devil he'll just let you go ahead and cook but a child of God he'll make you realize and what will happen is there will be a revival not a resurrection big difference resurrection is somebody died and had to be brought back to life that's it you're new birth but a revival is reviving the person that you already got inside of you and where God can use you to do the works of God not the works of the devil everybody got that same man so it's just a stirring up of what you already know about so the children of Israel got into the place they were tired they were sick and tired of being sick and tired amen so what happened then the call that the people gave to God sit second Ana hey buddy back there good to have little Hudson with us today glad you brought your parents to church but the call came out from the people it's gotta come from the people I'll read you a quote where brother Brown said preacher can't bring a revival I sit here and I can scream as loud as I want to and it won't do any good unless you catch what's being said and then you take it with you and do something about it alright so it's gonna be done the way that God wants it done it's the people cry out for a revival and then God sent them a Moses amen same way with the whole world the whole world was dying in sin and iniquity and God took his incentive south and then on the day of Pentecost there become a revival there was something that came up then I told you many times before one of the greatest revivals in the 1800s was in Dwight Moody's time in two different ones but then around the turn of the century right before brother Branham comes on the scene to spearhead the healing revival what happened was and I'm reading back in history and you can read it yourself it's real plain in the 1900s there was no cure for a lot of things what was happening was there was the illness was without performing any kind of medicine and the people of God started crying out God we need healing man has come to a place to where they can't take these disease now but now look you today we have an advancement of medicine listen folks you really don't need faith today you go to the doctor because there's one on every corner there's a specialist for your hair and the pimples on your finger and all these others there's a specialist for your fingernails you understand what I mean that wasn't in the nineteen or the twentieth right at the turn of the century there was just little home remedies well the people the Christians started crying out to God and said God we need a revival so God sent them a healing revival worth thousands and hundreds of thousands but not only did he send the revival he said William Marion Branham a prophet that could literally look inside of you and tell you where it was that what would happen when you got healed that they didn't know nothing about oh that thing's gonna swell like a little puppy dog that gets hit on the side of the road how simple is that you're gonna get sicker before you get better now who would have told him that the doctors not gonna tell him that Dobbs are gonna say let's cut the thing out no but the great physician was on the scene through a prophet in the end time and he was as I've always said that Albert Einstein one of the greatest minds in the world was on the earth but there was a there was a spiritual Einstein called William Branham that he knew he went out as an eagle and went up higher and he could be able to see things that man could never see when I see the advancement now and the sickness has come almost close together because remember brother Branham said cancer would be as a toothache in the end time so now listen member brother Brent preached a lot of sermons don't do you fear cancer well they feared that word a long time ago now it's not so much why because the advancement of manners went so far so what are we saying we're saying we don't need a healing revival Oh Lord we love to get healed I mean we love to get healed but there's no healing campaign going on that's not promised anymore this revival we're talking about now is a word revival it's going back to the Word of God which has healing in it which that salvation in it but you got to be able to stir up what you've already got and then bring some of you to a realization that you don't have but you want it and you groan and cry waiting for it and God sends it doesn't he promised he would buddy all right let's go testimony on the sea so we're not looking for we're not looking for a listen we're not even looking for a one-man message anymore this is this is the bride this is the bride aged brother Branham was one to bring us the message but as I was telling them downstairs in the Sunday School class church age messengers only were in a certain small part of their church age Columba wasn't even in his church age he died before the church age that he was accredited with began according to the Prophet so who took the message the people it's in the people sure sure we cried out for many things and God would send somebody we cried listening to people in the Catholic Church cried out to God God why do we have to do penance why do we have to pray to dead Saints why do we have to do this why do we have to do that sister antlers been a Catholic was the Catholic she knows what he's talking about they build all their life on that stuff you know walking through the cobblestone on your knees and all that stuff no the people cried out and said god this can't be it and God said okay I got a little guy named Martin Luther he's in your system but I'm fixing to bring him out and he's going to preach you a message that's gonna bring you out of that now what more are we looking at today we're lucky we've had the message to bring us out and take us out what are we doing here we need to revive what's already here not a new message not a new doctrine not a new mystery I thought you and I were the mystery number three testimony on the seat and then we began to find out miracles isn't taking place in a more like like they were let's it go home sick it is of God is it because of God you can't blame God for none of that it's because of the lack of the revival among the preachers huh it's the preachers fault always people lack of the revival among the people there is no revival they sit and listen go home and say well I guess that was pretty good on huh see there's not that zeal there's not that something in the people that should be there he didn't call them non-christians but there's something not in there I was telling them a story this morning I went to the dentist I think I felt something even if I went to the dentist this little girl was there you know and she was getting ready to work on my teeth and she was an assistant she was talking to the doctor Amy and she said we went to this church the other Sunday and we've been trying to find a church we went to this church the other Sunday and that guy preached 20 minutes we're finding us another church you know me mouth full of cotton mouth full of Novocain I didn't care I care why'd you tell mom I did I looked over I said do what she said 20 minutes he priest said Lord it was like an eternity I looked at her and I said let me tell you something lady my righteous indignation got up a little bit I think it was the drugs i'ma blame it on them anyway Levi but no I looked at and I said lady what are you going to church for I did because somebody went Oh Heather somebody went after I did and then the lady was still kind of healing me but I really didn't care cuz I told her I said look you want to go to church in here about 15 minutes about a man that hung on a cross for three hours nails in both hands nails and his feet a crown of thorns on his head for three hours and you can't set 20 minutes and let somebody tell you about him I told I said you set for an hour and watch Bachelorette or whatever they were talking about and you'll just I can't believe that girl is going out with four men for one hour they'll sit there and listen and watch but they won't sit 20 minutes I said sister if our people took 20 minutes of our sermons I said they would beat that string us up well some of you might not but I mean what would your comment bake if somebody just come up and preached you 20 minutes and then you went to the house but that's all they do that's the world they don't have God they have a form of godliness but denying the power of the word that's why I thought about a word revival it's got to become from the Word of God I was a little wheel whither cuz my heavens can you believe somebody would literally I'm not going back to that church ain't twenty minutes anyway moving right along Joel to verse 23 let's go to that one we've been with before we'll get to a certain spot and then I'm gonna wait til for Wednesday night and finish this up be glad and rejoice the children of Zion talking to you and rejoicing the Lord your God for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat and the facts overflow with wine and oil and I will restore or I will revive unto you remember that bride tree never died but it got eat to the stump but there was still life thank God in the roots you can't kill God there that tree will still it look like you couldn't see nothing look out there now middle of the dead of the winter time you look down in your lawn well - green because it's fescue but you look down and you think there's nothing there don't worry give it a little it's got plenty of moisture so all it needs is some warmth and then you'll see things start popping up why the life is down in the ground the life is in the earth and I will restore or revive to you the years that what the badness need to penticoff see that's what brother brown said all the different denominations they ate that tree down because of their creeds and dogmas but it's promised I will restore that tree you can't kill the Tree of Life this why it's called the tree of life and I will restore to you the years and you say what's that got to do that read seen them before broken sister and brother man said I don't need no fill it don't need no filter no straining is talking about that bubbling water that comes up out of the ground no pumping no jerking no nothing else it's just there bubbling up it don't have it don't have to depend on local rains to fill it out now look rains or revivals so he's going to send the former revival and the latter revival in the same month which is right now we've had the former rain or former revival which is the teaching revival of the Word of God through the prophet in the end time and through the fivefold ministry and then God is getting ready to take them the second stage are the latter rain and he's gonna harvest what's been planning rains or revivals that's that fountain of life where the carcass is what's the carcass the word where the word is the Eagles will gather you don't have to pump up a revival you don't have to pump up nothing that's what I mean we could sit here we could have a real emotional service and it would just be an emotional service but what does it do for us I don't mind I like to I like to sing songs and get pumped up sure keeps you from sleeping so much sister Elmo blames sister Anna marooned of today for all this sleepiness she fed us cake and ice cream during between services so the carbs are hitting about 253 which is right now if I fall asleep we all in trouble all right wake yourself number 5 let's get through this getting in the spirit that's the way you get a revival it's when you really get in the spirit of revival not whooping it up or something but praying it down praying it down until there's a revival strikes your heart until all the logs of a cliche please the axis ISM and all the logs of fanaticism we're going to come back to this Wednesday night because we're gonna talk about the River of Life and we're gonna talk about them logs clogging up the river and all the logs of fanaticism and all the logs of systems and all the logs of unbelief flows out and then the waters of God come falling down upon you there you are third seal now that's what's reasons today the revivals were supposed to have now remember in 1963 he just came out of that healing revival that I was talking about everybody got that same m4 though she Lear sleeps a man okay-dokey so what's he talking about you think man this guy is gonna talk about this great revival that he just came out of we have denominational revivals which listen a denominational revival cannot be a word revival they have no word to revive we haven't had a real stirring no no no no no sir don't think we got revivals we haven't oh they got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a revival no we're no no the the bride hasn't had a revival yet there's been no revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it it'll take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again a way down that sleep bath in this church look I'm glad God sent us a prophet he will that's as much as God telling me that he's gonna send it he will send it he promised it so he's gonna send us a word revival whether you part of it or not is up to you now let's go to number seven broken system 1965 but that's the way God does he humiliates us in our educational system not as I'm trying to support ignorance don't put your kids out of school but I'm trying to tell you the difference education can never bring life it takes the Spirit of God to bring life and that life must not come out of just the intellectual revival it's got to come out of the Bible word revival and that word is the same yesterday today and forever and when it falls today and quickens you get the same result as you did in Acts - exactly it always has it always will look because it's the Spirit of God that conditions the atmosphere that's what we were talking about last couple of Sunday's ago about Dunamis power and exosphere power that it's got to create an atmosphere there's got to be an atmosphere created so that God can come listen he's not gonna come into some of our atmosphere hello some of them I create I really don't want him there because he'd be it's really a shame to me Susan Stephen said me hey but God wants to help us though if we'll if we'll let the spirit help us condition the atmosphere it'll always be where God can walk in and say hey I'm here I'm here to help you hey man that's what a revival is for us to revive you to tell you hey you can do this if you'll do these things get in the spirit not some kind of other spirit but the Spirit of God and it will condition the atmosphere so that God can come in and what quicken the word number eight perk of me in church a hey by alright perk of me in church age but God never placed signs the head of the word signs follow the word that's when Elijah told the woman to make a cake for him first according to the word of the Lord when she did as the word said the proper sign came come to the word first and then watch the miracle the seed word is energized by the Spirit the Holy Spirit not some of the spirits we hang on to hello hey man Holy Spirit that's why they call it a Holy Spirit there's really some unholy ones but we don't want to deal with them John 14 mm-hmm if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever what is it the Spirit of Truth even the Spirit of Truth listen folks this word revival has got to be the real true Word of God God's has winked at so most of our ignorance until you come to a place to where now you can't plead ignorance no more because the Word of God is what to edge cutting dividing the spirit in the soul telling us where our problem really lies listen if you're born again today your problems not in your soul that's Almighty God the problems in your spirit the problems not in your flesh your flesh just does what your spirit tells it today and then even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not are in other words not see but understand neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you john 14 25 these things have i spoke good unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you John 16:12 I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now why couldn't they bear them didn't have the Holy Ghost they'd understand what he was saying howbeit when he the Spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth not part truth all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he shall show you things to come a revelation he will show you things to come Luke 24 verse 49 said then behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high power that's 1 verse 7 and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father has put in his own power but ye shall receive power that word we're going to read in just a second is Dunamis it's dynamite power it's power that is inside of you it's creative power but you shall receive Dunamis power after that the Holy Ghost after so you can have excellency a power which is the permitted power and work under anointed ones and all these different things but you can't have Dunamis power in your soul and be lost that's God that's the power of God will read it in just a second and you shall be witnesses unto me Jerusalem Judea Samaria and the uttermost parts of Lulla Jordan make it personal amen alright let's go to the definition of that power is Dunamis and we went through this we'll fly through it pretty quick doing them means power virtue and I watch them what's the what's the second faith virtue strength power now not this kind of power listen the whole world thinks Sampson look like Arnold Schwarzenegger no he was a little shrimpy kid that's why it wouldn't be so it wouldn't be a revelation or a mystery if this guy walks in and goes I can pick that pillar up and I'll just take them walls down what if some little guy looks like Don Knotts most of you know who that is Barney Fife if he walked up and says I'm gonna pick them I'm gonna pick them to turn walls and and I'm gonna kill him on the hill they're gonna go really and he just goes that's why they were looking for his power inherent it means you inherited this power you inherited this power power residing anything by virtue of its nature if you're born again today you have the nature of God and it's not on you it's inside of you a wit of wit are which a person or thing exerts and puts forth moral power and excellence of soul the greatest power that ever come about was when Jesus walked out and said all power in heaven earth been given unto me he'd been dead for three days sometimes we look at powering and it's okay to exercise a little bit I kind of want to but don't worry buddy when you get 60 it goes it all fall because of gravity you know though the Bible does tell you to exercise your faith exercise your faith all right let's go to Romans 13 verse 1 well they never soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power but of God remember Satan has no power Satan's powerless unless God gives him power and who gives him most of them his power take your hand watch take ahead and do this point at your neighbor and then go this guy right here is when he gives the devil the power that's what I said that everybody goes now for that black could have the power we'd be good well I think he's got it now so let's point somewhere else for there is no power but of God how can you deny there's only one creator and if that creator can say let there be and stand and watch this whole universe every star you look at tonight one man made it by his spoken word not out there with a shovel he just said let there be what do mighty God we serve I was looking at the Grand Canyon one day and I thought man there's no way man could fill this big hole up that thinks 300 miles long and a mile deep I said but God could speak one word and it shut right up or he'd bring enough dirt to fill it in in an instant that's the God we serve the powers that be are ordained of God whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God and we're going to get into this in just a second that's what's happening in the world is the people are resisting the power of God and you and I to a degree do the same thing and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation Romans 1 verse 16 enough I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ so what is the power of God the gospel of Jesus Christ for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the Dunamis or the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek Luke 4 verse 32 and they were astonished at Jesus's doctrine for his word was with power his word was with Dunamis his word when he said something it happened Amen my brother Dale was talking about Adam when Adam was in the Garden of Eden what he said came to pass he had the mind of God that's what we're heading to that's what we're standing on the earth today comes remember Jesus never Jesus never walked out one day and said now now me and the Father we've been arguing back there behind the tent no he said whatever the father says that's what I did he and I are one there's no argument between us but we are hold on who argues with God we do we argue with God what no world are you doing but his doctrine must have been this is why that I we're gonna have to come to a word revival because the word is for the power is the word is where the Dunamis is the power to create listen the power to get those people out of the grave the power that Adam had that was born in the Old Testament that Jesus come as brother nails talking about Jesus came he came on the earth then he leaves and where does he send the power sends it back to the people drawing pulling drawing pulling drawing pulley first Corinthians 1 verse 18 excuse me for the preaching look of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the Dunamis of God it is the power of God first Peter 1 verse 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which is according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance there's that inheritant power to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power our Dunamis of God through what faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time we're here this is it now that's the inherent power to an inheritance incorruptible anything God gives you is incorruptible his word can't be corrupt we corrupt his word man corrupts his word we stop up the flues God doesn't stop up the flues his brother Chris long was talking about there's there's no conflict between Garden Satan nor the Creator the conflict between God and Satan is the person standing between God and Satan me and you we are the conflict but what Satan has said why I destroyed your word by them people right there and guards over here notice I said yeah I know that but I'm gonna bring it back right back through them amen I'm gonna bring it back right back through the same people that you think you destroyed bring it back and then we'll do it in your garden like brother like brother that's right like brother Aaron said said I'm God's God just slipped into Satan's even and just gonna bring out of people just like would have been standing in the Garden of Eden had there not been a fall but there had to be a fall there had to be a savior they had to be a healer a redeemer they had to be somebody come on the earth that's why it just makes so much sense that Adam could not come with an eternal body in the spirit along with the soul if he did he wouldn't never fail but in the condition he's in he fell because God had attributes we already know that we've been to message long enough who are kept by the power of God through faith in the salvation ready to be delivered in the last time so now we're going to cover just for a few minutes what the prophet of God said but let's turn to revelation 6 verse 8 because we've got to cover that other power which is exosphere now Dunamis power is an inherent power that is the power of God that is creative power and I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed him and power was given unto them power was given to them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with a sword and hunger death and beast of the earth if you look all in the Book of Revelations every time God's talking about the devil he has to give him power so let's see what that power says though let's go to the next one the Greek lexicon says that power though is XOC a power which is power of choice liberty of doing this one pleases leave or permissive remember God has a perfect will and a what a permissive will physical and mental power the ability or strength which one is in dude which he either possesses our exercises they didn't say anything about inheriting a next we'll see a power is something that can come down upon you as God give the power to the four beasts to go out and conquer the world that's ecstasy of power look at person look at number nine let's see what brother Brown said about this testimony of a true witness 1961 his word testifies his word testifies in the last day that there will come a falling away now is that not happening and there would come up a cold formal powerless church age that's what we're living in folks that's what we got to overcome a church that had no power having a form of godliness but denying the power that up from search turn away he give the sign that there'd be times when a man was sitting the temple of God showing himself he was God he'd come ruling the nation's how perfectly all these things how God's Word has been perfect and remember King Nebuchadnezzar did the same thing all through the kingdoms let's scroll down to the bottom save time God's Word is a true witness and God's Word said in the last days they were compared less times men heart failing them for fear perplexity of times and distress between the nations and they'd come a falling away from the church and look men would rise up showing themself big dignitaries and so forth what big name preachers all right and what pile and would power away from the church and have a form of godless and deny the real power of God Church joining he spoke to the church getting in that condition we are a witness everybody say that we are a witness that the Word of God is fulfilled the church is in that if this was in 1965 61 the church is in that every organization is in that same state right now I'll challenge any man to show me any organization on fire for God oh they think they got revival oh no they don't because this last revival has to be a pure war revival you can't revive something that's dead it needs a resurrection I'll challenge any man to show me any organization on fire for God fill with the Holy Ghost with signs falling rising tell me one any organization there's no such a thing there it's not on the pages that's right they're all powerless and dead get it but he also prophesy thank you God for sending a prophet that gets us out of all this yeah clap your hands yeah thank God he sent us a prophet to get us out of this mess but he also prophesied there be a real Church in that day a little flock a remnant he said there would be and there will be that's the satellite there will be a people who know their God said the Prophet will do exploit in the last day thank God he said to be evening Lots in the last day the Prophet said so God's true witness said so there'd be evening lies what is an evening live the same as the morning live the Prophet said there'll be a day when it wouldn't be night or day of gloomy time outside just enough light to see where to get around how to get around but in the evening time it shall be like what would it be coming back going back to the early time there'd be even lights in the last day shining all right let's go to the bottom keep going look he said they'd be a prophet rise in the last day Malachi for giving the signs of the days of light so forth also prophesying for the people to return back turn back to the faith of the first Pentecostal fathers just telling the church downstairs we're going through the Book of Revelations no other prophet no other seven star messenger one of the seven not any of them but the last one was required to turn anybody back Lucca didn't turn the people back to Columbus message no Wesley didn't turn them back to Luther's where he'd be going backwards but in God that wasn't backwards because you got to go back to where you fell from so he said a prophet in the end time to take us all the way back to right here and then hitta he said that but it had to be because of what what felon if in those ages it wasn't the people it was the word that they had had no effect it was powerless because man had said it's novenas it's water baptism father son Holy Ghost it's three gods pray to the saint mary and saint sicilian and saint patrick sing whoever turn back to the original turn back to the bible get away from organization the denominations and go back to the first go back to the original Pentecost to the original filling of the Holy Ghost to the original Dunamis power of God the word testifies that that will happen I'll tell you before I told you before I'll tell you again XOC a power is okay but it will not get you out of a grave Dunamis power the power of God the only power is gonna get you alba grave or change your body brother Branham 1962 all things what's this oh you said that you're taking under the Old Testament brother Branham all right let's go to the New Testament 2nd Timothy 3 the Holy Spirit warned us that in the last days that the church would get away from the sincerity and the faith I don't think he's talking about denominations at this moment I think he's gone about us the sincerity in the faith did have a form of godliness but would deny the power that went with the white right thing right things having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof yes sir God hates a powerless religion I want everybody to read that with me God hates a powerless religion and any religion today that hasn't got Christ in it it's powerless but any religion that Christ is in under his own blood and it's got power in it God hates the religion without power he's got said you say God hates the religion without power brother Branham what world you talking about he said your solemn feast as they stink I guess he does hate it he said it makes me sick cuz remember what is this age it's lukewarm he spews him out of his mouth makes him sick and remember he told us rich the latest in church because you're lukewarm in other words you make me sick I'll spew you out of my mouth and we've come to that age God send us an Isaiah to chop the thing to pieces I believe he did well lay it out before the people cry out spare not you think he'd be accepted certainly not but he'd cry just the same solemnly feast their stink God hates powerless religion it's got to have power in it it's got to have sincerity sincerity brings power sincerity brings real worship not forms but genuine wine Dunamis worship power to know that you've passed from death unto life God wants to perform his word by his power how can he perform and when the church denies his power that's what we're gonna talk about we'll stop right here that's what we're gonna talk about Wednesday night we'll pick it up I may read I may read one more God wants to perform his word by power when the church denies his power how can he perform and vindicate his word when the church explains it away you saw that's for the denominational people no that's the people in this message you can't get it right when the church explains it away and says this for some other day in something how can God who knows to fulfill his word and performance word among people people the people deny listen brother Dale can be 100% on the word which I believe he is and you all could die go to hell me included you gotta take what he said and live it and the people did not that he does it yet they go through all the rituals oh my lord one more number 11 and it won't stop right here hadn't even been going an hour mm-hmm God hates a powerless religion this is another quote brother Branham really emphasized you put in powerless and read hey he hate God hates powerless religion now remember though that power is not power for me to walk up and say oh you're healed you're not gonna have any bills everything's gonna be paid for you get a new Corvette sorry no you don't boats like 1974 no air conditioned no heat flat tires sorry but I'm sorry he looked at me like he was gonna kill me when I said Corvette sorry about that if you daddy wasn't here we would get you a Corvette but no it's not that's not the power we think that the power is gonna be though really is it one day we're gonna be just oh there's my mailman run I don't have any bills in my mailbox that's not it we listen you as a Christian don't survive because of that you survived because of the powerless inside of you you survived because of when you get up the morning doesn't matter if you got 25 bills you can't pay god you saved my soul you've saved my soul now really though being a Dave Ramsey out you need to watch your student be there's a good steward of your money right right that's right but God hates the powerless religion but now look the powerless religion is a word false war is a false word true word can't be powerless hello true word cannot be polished it's full of power but God hates the powerless religion it's got to be power certainly it's a power to save a man from sin it's a power that can do signs and wonders and miracles as jesus promised they zeroed in I'm talking about you and I they zeroed in on the Word of God back there and believed it and hit the target you zero the same way on thank God for a prophet you zero the same way on the Word of God it'll hit the target again not another target same target it's got to because he's the same yesterday today and forever God don't like a powerless religion how many times I need to say it stays a brother Brown said that a hundred times God doesn't like a powerless religion God does not want that God wants to perform have you ever heard the statement this is gonna really flip you out listen everybody listen listen you got me God's waiting on earth God does not want that powerless God wants to perform but who's he wait no do it again point at your neighbor uh-uh go like that's it God's waiting oh don't point at her lay by God wants to show herself alive listen people we live way under our privileges God wants to show itself alive how can he do that by the power of the spoken word our very hopes is in the resurrection is that right our hope of life its resurrection the resurrection of Jesus Christ everybody loved the Lord say Amen all right we'll read this one then we'll stop right here revelation of Jesus Christ Church AIDS book now remember this Christ in the true church now look true church not false Church true church Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes Satan revealing his works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting look that this discrediting of God's Word is the devil's business listen he's he's got enough sense to know he can't do away with God's Word that man's got a lot of power but he tries to discredit the word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people at little church get the true revelation now I didn't make them big that's what the church age it the church age book makes that a big pump big font he knows that if the church gets the true revelation the true church and what she is not what she's going to be what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church now what's the framework you see that you see that that's framework and you're sitting in it and there's two spirits sitting here today in the framework of this church if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church he's not talking about that Church over you under the believes father son hold no he's coming here if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless before look at that word he didn't say him he said her he will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert now watch in the desert Jesus didn't use any power except the spoken words spoken words all he said if you be you know I'm supposed to tempt the LORD thy God if you did you're not supposed to do that finally the devil just said I'll deal with you later he will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ was stood as every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates revelation but we love it and with true revelation in our lives the gates of Hell cannot prevail against us but we will thank God for a prophet but we will prevail over them you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this is that this book we are studying which is the book of Revelation is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in the future age then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us revelation or we will fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study 20 minute sermons and thinking to make this book real it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book or this word revival cannot be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one with prophetic insight it will require now when you take a study in school there are things that are required you can't jump around them if they're required you got to go through them it will take one with prophetic inside it will require that the ability to hear from God how you're going to hear from God through the word it will require supernatural instruction not just the student comparing verse with verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know we'll stop right there Wednesday night we'll speak on the River of Life because the problem the problems not the river let's stand our feet and musicians come the problem is not the river it's the logs they clog up the river you can't stop the river of life but you can plug it up a little bit that's what man has done they've dam to thing up and I mean not be am it up they dammed it up really they dammed the people daamn didi they've made they've made look those people are damned if they don't come to God they have the River of Life it's not flowing in their life if they're not born again and even if it's flowing in your life today you've still got logs of your own ideas or of your own this or of your of your something that you haven't your temperance and your patience and your godliness has not come to the place then what happened is that fluid or that part of that River has been clogged up we'll talk about that when see not let's think there's a river of life first and then we'll see yours okay all right then we're saying you're sending Lee let's just sing that again

before the foundation of the world that that well would be right there and they would be an ordained prophet walk right to that well and then preach the sermon off of it but what's the more mystery than that is he walks over and picks up a cigarette pack boy don't touch that cigarette pack but he preached one of the greatest sermons he ever preached a thinking man's filter hey man so there's a river of life and he said Lord what is this thing bubbling out for you and that well said I don't know it's just something it's just something down in here if something you can't see but you watch and see what it produces Colet water would just bubble up and brother round said it was the cleanest purest water you ever seen on the face of the earth bring up Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] to me
