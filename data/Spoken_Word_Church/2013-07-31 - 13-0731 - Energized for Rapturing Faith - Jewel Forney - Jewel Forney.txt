Lord I kind of getting to feel like just a second home he was uh matter of fact I might have been here a little more to help you know this evening you know my style uh in the South they call me the helicopter preacher as I try to live up to that to the best of my knowledge so we trust God denied that I can just go up and deliver what I got and we can land and everybody can go home pretty loads up if you got your Bibles tonight I'm gonna reap in two places in the scripture Saint John the 20th chapter and also Romans the eighth chapter and I'm gonna begin reading that Saint John the 20th chapter excuse me and I'm going to begin reading at the 19th verse and it reads like this and the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the door was shut where the disciple was similar for the fear of the Jews came Jesus stood in their midst and said unto them peace be unto you when he had so said he showed unto them his hands and his side then the disciples didn't they were the disciple glad when they saw the Lord didn't say Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so sin are you and when he had said just he's breathed on them and said unto them received he ate the Holy Ghost who's ever seen he remit they are remitted unto them and unto them and who's ever seen they should be retain they should be retained uh Romans 8. one verse from now Romans 8 verse 11. it says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelling you he that raised up Christ from the dead she also quickened your mortal Body by his spirit that dwelleth in you a gracious father helpeth o God to to heal our bodies and our mind and our spirit oh God oh God help us to get ourselves out of the way this evening father but I give you all my spirit Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you you may be seated one moment thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God this evening until from the scripture this evening as we was opening the opening world when after Jesus resurrection he prayed to the uh come in the midst of them and we know the stories that peace be unto you Hallelujah we begin to look at her uh and then he began to show unto them his hands and his and he showed unto them his side in other words and then and then you know the story he made himself known to any vanished right on this site but we begin to look at this here again then we find out in Romans 8 it began to teach us just right here if the Same Spirit of him that raised up Christ from the dead if it dwell in you it will bring your body to the same Revelation that Christ walked in I had a title this evening and I want to use a title called energize for Rapture and faith energized for rapturing Faith and the reason I use energy because I begin to realize the whole world is based on energy the night we move our energy Hallelujah Electra we are right here where we sitting we are responding through the might we are responding By the Light tonight about uh uh uh about uh the internet that maybe set up here but the thing that's moving the church tonight uh the thing that moving there in this natural is energy right if the if the lights go out and the air condition go off everybody man they ain't sitting in this hot Church how did that just the way people deal I never did that it wasn't especially in America but yeah but you know what I'm saying everything is energy if you got a car what good is a car if it ain't got energy right Hallelujah you got a carnival crate hallelujah it's either one day it ain't got no gas or you brought it Forward right I believe hello let me leave that alone that just sounds so good I understand it but by God grace but the energy that we the energy that we talk about tonight we we we begin not beginning uh how did I come up with a domestic energy it was it was you know you said you you're trying to study and you're trying to get inspiration to come up with something to preach sometimes and brother Brandon was out there one time he was out there and uh uh out there and he said he walked across a cigarette pack we realized he got this inspiration by something he picked up and looked at and God inspired him so I'm thinking in my office I'm trying to think of Lord I'm trying to get inspirational living new quotes reading you know how you doing you anyway and all of a sudden I looked on my desk I had a pack of energized batteries and I said and I never leave you know I never I really ain't never paid no did you and I just looked on the back of the energized battery and I thought I'd just read what it says and then the energized battery it says the battery was designed to create a dynamic seal a line battery to hold a library to hold power for up to 10 years and I thought about that I said a battery is designed with a dynamic seal a line battery to hold his power up to 10 euros and when I thought about a seal I think thank God for a dynamic seal in line the bride to have enough power enough energy to go all the way to the Dead Redemption Hallelujah I thank God for that kind of power hell did everything and I realized it was the same energy the same dynamics that they're probably used in the teaching rising to the sun you know on the battery and then he used it in the the same it was spelled the same way and using the the message right into the Sun and he and he uses Corporation right here we put too much scratch on them tenants right and nothing on the Dynamics in other words we got this is the edge of mechanics everybody has got their minds on mechanics right but remember mechanic is no good we have to put out the power to put it in action I don't care what you got right right if it won't if there's no power to make it work it's no good that's right because it's so easy he said it it needs the dynamic power of God the resurrection problem Jesus Christ up on their church and manifest and to bring it to pass that it is gasoline it might be in a gasoline can can it can still be water see but the only the only proof of it is it put the life on it and prove what it is gas or not how you brew I guess you you play with a match right you get a match around gas it'll tell you if it's gas and you won't have to have you won't need nobody to come down to try to mechanically prove to you it was gas how do you won't need nobody to try to look it up on the computer and prove to you as gas just like a match already it'll prove Itself by the power that's already in it foreign and another one he says here and they talk about mechanics and Dynamics and the way he's in the mechanic without the dynamic is no good neither the dynamic without the mechanic you can scream and shout and jump up and down all you want to and deny the word it won't do you any good at all and then what we do today we don't find a testmatic move around the message how they're all to becoming a bunch of Holly shouting but no doubt don't understand the dynamic power that God done brought for this hand it won't do you no good how do you show that begin to relax yeah so I'm gonna use this kind of uh maybe break it down in my own way of doing it this evening so I begin to look here and I began to realize here that I'm beginning to realize him so we need energy we need energy drink we always trying to find something for energy right especially when you get old ER they come up with something when you get old but you said I'm gonna try that because everybody want to feel that little extra boost how do you you always want to feel like you did when you was 18 years old you might not look like you do your 18 year but at least you can feel like it so so you know we all want to try to get that little boost of energy how do you do when so the world if you notice all of a sudden it been an explosion of energy every day you go energy drink energy cry or energy cooking or energy chunga a bubble gum energy a candy everything all of a sudden why we go people body is breaking down and they need energy and we need energy in the natural we need God to come and bring energy into spiritual so we can make a right this energy that we need and this energy that we need Christ had to come down and express that energy anyway he was the very source of energy how do you know the word in that word he is he when Christ came he came to express I am the source of energy and if any man comes Ali after me pick up my cross I will energize it and listen we begin to look here so how did God bring his energy to the Earth how did God bring the source of energy it said by prophecy that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and whosoever believe in him shall not bear he was energy so we're talking about God energy how do you know we begin to realize here he had to bring he had to express he wanted to express this energy so anyway I want you to understand something about God want you to understand something about God being in the image of God the spirit he never knew what it was to be weak right right God never knew what it was to be weak so because he was a spirit right how to show he could not go around when you're going through your Lord's bow Dolly and you're going to your lower trial how do God need to know what your how I feel to be a man right Hallelujah so the only way that God can feel what it is to be weak or the way that God you didn't feel that how it feel to be a man himself he had to become you that we might be through his energy may become him how to show what he did he made he moved from the invisible God into a good of up with skin on him right right and you according to the Bible here Mary received the word how did Christ come through prophecy of Isaiah of burnish accuracy he even materialize it himself around his own work at one day man I had to him one day he became in a human body and when he doubled his human body he know what you're going through when you get tired he know what it was to be tired I mean when you have a headache he know what it is he was not sin but he became sin through his own he man in the word God had no sin in him Christ was not even born in sin right the only way he could become sin he took us all off same curse it is a man hang on the tree he put his own self underneath right and he took the sins of the world upon himself telling this energy he had this energy that he was going to express he wanted to show him he wanted to understand his power he wanted to understand so as a man as a man as a man God as a man and when he come in the form of Christ he knew what it was to be weak right yet still he know what it was to be weak as a man but he also know what it is to be powerful in the spirit so what would he do he was trying to show up the weakness of the flag Hallelujah not to depend on it but be pinned on the power of the word Heaven because we had to see how weak the flush him so we can have confidence in the word amen said everybody says here we begin to realize here when Jesus came he immediately God has him then he goes into he goes out here let me say reversion how did he was born marry his boy he came into the world I want you to notice something about him coming yeah according to that word she became pretty heard nothing about Jesus did 12 years old he shows up in the temple yeah teaching him and teaching them about the scripture in other words so here all of a sudden Mary and Joseph came and they said uh we're your father and I sought you where you are hey Jesus said no and don't you be done with Joseph not my father right and you're not my mama woman right honey I'm about my father business so Jesus you know what he he had the wisdom he took his wisdom and showed who he was so we hear no more about him right then all of a sudden one day John was baptizing on the River Jordan and Jesus come walking out and when John looked at him he said behold Hallelujah Behold the Lamb of God I'll talk about the one that was not born like me and you was born honey the one that when he came he came from God and he was going back for the God Amen so what he even did he walked out in the water what did God do he was God but he needed to be activated right Hallelujah you know either way the prophecy needed to be activated he didn't come to walk out in the water he come to heal the sick he come to open the blind it up anybody had to be activated what did he do what he wanted that in the water the spirit of God the spirit of the god like a dog company sitting at Heaven he's not come down to energize you to put you in action Hallelujah put him in action he goes into the Wilderness right let me tempted of the devil he was weak he first in 40 days 40 nights and he was weak he was so weak a 40-day fast and you he had no chicken you're gonna be weak I'm just rotating it right now I mean you're gonna be thinking about all kind of Temptations in your mind gonna probably start acting up and all of a sudden the devil moved into him and he got this week what was he trying to teach us he was trying to teach us to have faith in God the weakest Christian can beat the devil in the ground hallelujah oh you beat the devil not by a human ability but you beat the Devil by the word and faith in the word so what did he did he goes out there and the devil come preaching the Bible that's right he shouldn't say bread because in the beginning God gave him bread and it went out and fell he told Adam he's gonna eat the bread until you return to the desert here the devil came and picked the scripture back up miss little Kaden this interpreting the scripture saying if thou be the Son of God this is what God told you to eat but Jesus said man he did not deny the bread he's the if man should not live my bread alone always stays great with the word Heaven and the devil came and quoted Psalms 91 challenged him to cast himself down how did Jesus say to the devil he said it is written don't you tempt the Lord thy God and then we showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the Gina Beat the Devil by saying I'll Worship the Lord that God and him only shall I serve because the word case sir nothing but but God right amen hallelujah we begin to look at him and Jesus so in other words admittedly when it goes through the Temptation right that Bible said the Angels had to come because he needed recharge honey now I want you to notice this recharge it he needed to be charged up again Hallelujah you remember how it was used to be in the whole day you got a toy and the battery run down yeah yeah and you put it on the oven right and then heat the elements up then you throw it back in the toilet the better run a little longer it ain't like the high-tech stuff they got today you know they man I see kids they're not gonna make you want to be a kid again I said look guys got helicopter wow everything I had I had to ring that day it's not bugging no more brother here hello this is over here I need to stand right there man they're like wow oh man so you know what's in here but you had to steal the battery would run down and when the battery would get weed how did the battle was getting weak and we'll try to charge it back up to get energy and if the battery had a good sale it will hold a charge but if a baby got a dead sale it won't hold a chore I know that's what it is today if you gotta say only you that come from God you will hold a charge foreign you know something I brought a watch it wouldn't run I said what's wrong with the stupid watch yeah you know I'm trying to figure out what your tempting anymore and I look there now I've seen a little plastic paper and I poured it out and it activated the watch how did God put a seal in you honey for your day in this message and you could not be activated in Lutheran you could not have been activated but in this end God sent a voice I have to pull the seal the loose what do you do it put you in action for your age Hallelujah tell what he been doing we all been activated by the word of God God is putting something in her he told Jesus said Saint John went down he's an immediate received him he gave me power to become the sons of God and it ain't your own power we move about it ain't my power but it's by the power here that running on his Shadows but Jesus himself he was energy he was a very source of energy right Hallelujah in other words so everywhere he went he always released energy he couldn't even go to a funeral service he could not even go to a funeral service without a resurrection take place he was so full of God energy anyway when something happened but you're saying being a man he he had the ability to get weak he had the ability to get tired he was on the he was on the boat one time because he was tired he went down to go to sleep he was having no doubt a good nicely good rest I'd be a good rest today by two hours before I feel good so he got he was tired and all of a sudden the bull got in the rain and the Storm come everybody forgot that the source of energy was on the boat and all of a sudden somebody come to their remembrance and people said go down there and wake the master how did Gina brother say nobody can get no sleep around here yeah energy that you need is already here not on the boat but in the soul of man ready all we need to do is wake it by faith heavy so he says here he gets up on the boat he moves out there he be tired but inside of him with the power of almighty God peace be still all he needed was to speak the word of myself but haven't said another point I want to bring out you remember her you remember when uh when all of a sudden here that this we talking about activating you know what I was on how did I meant to use this how do you remember when when when Elizabeth got impregnated and the angel came to Livermore and told Elizabeth that John will go in the spirit of Elijah he remember the promising he went to Elizabeth in Saint Luke 1 he told Elizabeth he told the angel told her that John would go forth in the spirit of Elijah Hallelujah but the point everyone how you living with was carrying a dad Berry yeah the baby had never been activated so prophecy was laying there was not manifested at that time but she needed somebody to activate the promise so God sent Mary now because the Lord got a gun remember the the the voice had to come to the bride I leave Mary be the type of the Bride she goes down there because living but needed a Revival he she had had a Revival when a woman got her dead baby she's under depression that's right because a sign that a baby is lying you feeling some movement if it's not moving it gonna cause some problems so Elizabeth no doubt was fighting especially being in her old age but fighting depression already you know I'm having this baby now it ain't no movement in my body something is wrong how did the angel told me about heaven but the baby had not moved it what was the baby doing the baby was waiting on the spirit of Prophecy tells you to stand up how did Mary goes down there and when she saluted ligma John was activated and received a power to Holy Ghost the activating power and come to divorce honey they come back here am I hear in the word of God if you're gonna be activated you're gonna have to hear God voice hello look at you show you Jesus could be drank you remember one time Jesus was in a meeting and all of a sudden he preaching to all the people's run that was just a little woman that had a blood issue right she if I could just only sneak in there he just touch that him up has gone I could be I don't need to touch his head I don't need to touch his hand if I can get just to the lower part of it was going to touch it I could be made whole and all of a sudden she moves through the crowd because she would not let nobody see a movie through the crowd because those I wouldn't say even them Disciples of that they would have turned this woman away because the woman with a blood issue was counting unclean Hallelujah so no religious legalism Spirit were not a little unclean woman touch Jesus but Jesus let us sneak do that right right honey you know when you put your cables on a car and you're going to try to crank a dead battery a battery you know it pulling the other bag what are you doing it's pulling energy from one to the day when she pulled my thing she was able to pour energy Jesus said he said I got weak he said who touched me and Peter them looked at him they said man come on master I always say something off the wall man all these people touching you come on man yeah what's wrong what you mean who touched you Jesus said this time yeah yeah it wouldn't have touched I can't hear the touch honey when I got in touch this time it pulled from my inside honey I feel energy left in my body I needed that person that touched me ain't poor enough energy into them I knew that that blood issue that demon had to leave their bodies how did Jesus turn around and looked at the crowd he didn't say woman that favored made the whole how the woman you are healed or whatever what are you sure to do he was sure to do I don't care what condition the person is I don't care what kind of blood this is if they have enough Faith to touch me they'll be me whole I don't care what the problem is think what move God energy all right so we begin to look at her he wanted to show us this energy he would assured that I am the resurrection I am the life so he wanted to learn the hell confident how did all the source of energy come through him how do you oh all our energy all our spirit come from almighty God how did what did Palace said Palace said I have power to do this Jesus said nobody not this time right not at this time you only have the energy or the power to do this because it comes from God hallelujah your life is depending on me Hallelujah and the energy that you got to come against me is to fulfill my scripture so I'm energizing you to go the opposite way right so that basically what it was but one time we find out here again Jesus energy was not given to him for himself right the energy that he had he had a purpose how do you show and then where his purpose was how I'm gonna come and I'm going to show through me believing in me the source of energy how do you I don't care where you ate I don't care how weak you are if you need it I'll be there all on time Hallelujah but I remember one time Jesus went up on on a map called Mount Transfiguration that energy was just over you know you can get too much energy and overload a box right sometimes I do that you just put too much on a box and then what it I call it a surge of power or whatever it is and then knock out the lights too much energy I need too much energy overloaded you put a 220 on a on a 110 you're gonna hold the load something how do you know what I'm saying Show Jesus himself one time his body begin to punch away for two minutes Jesus I got to go release this energy I'm having a problem search honey somebody dude goes on my Transfiguration and he releases the energy how do we need to release the energy the power that knew what happened a resurrection took place and all of a sudden Elijah walked out of the Grave was Christ released his energy ain't going to bring forth raps in pain the bride is here that we are the one they're going to see God release his energy when the dead in Christ come and meet us on Earth somebody on them please see that promise Hallelujah find him cheated one time he had a friend that died the battery went dead he was in the grave he had been there for four days now that battery's her battery's dead and got a dead sale you can jump it off all you want to that's why Judas couldn't hold a charge Judah is getting a hold of George his energy run lower level run low before he got to Pentecost Hallelujah in the world he might be like that you little energetic Little Robot how did he was walking but before he made it to Pentecost it stopped right he had a friend named Lazarus so Elijah's been in the grave for four days he's already stanking circumstance in other words Martha hears about this is Jesus's message they come because your best friend is sick and Jesus went on doing his right Ministry whatever he was doing at that moment knowing that Liza was in this condition so about four days after he died Jesus excuse me he decided I'm gonna go down there now because now they can't say that their tradition is saying that lives of the spirit hangs at the Jewish leader that the spirit lingers around the body for three days and Gina would have rolled him in three days they would have went to their tradition but he waited to the fourth stage he broke that tradition and he showed up how did so everything worked together how did he shows he's going down there and Martha approaches him oh Master if you would have been here my brother would not have died if she would have had the right faith and she wouldn't believe who he really was see you could have spoke the word that's right amen what did the satira say I don't need you to come to my house I don't need to see your body I need you to speak the word because he understands the authority behind the words and then Jesus said he'll rise you know the story she said yes Lord I know he will whatever you ask God and then the story goes she was not really looking at it in the light that Jesus was looking at it right because when they come to the final end she said oh yes Lord I know he will raise in the general adoration so now she's putting the resurrection way over here how do you know that in other words why was she looking because she had a reason why he couldn't write it now because he was already snagging but that if God have no limitation on faith Hallelujah anyway he said show me what you lay to me Hallelujah see that I know you're raising the resurrection Jesus said I am amen I am the source of energy amen I am a resurrection how do you show me where you laid it right amen David go down to the Grave you know when you jump a call you know how it is you just don't go to a car pull the hood up yeah hook the cables up to the car they got the strong battery and hold them in your hand and say jump off tell me how you drop a call you can shout hallelujah your whole cables do you blew in the face here never jumped somebody gotta hook it up himself not at least we ain't got that that phone technology yet but they're probably working on it but it Wheels but right now it's still manually done you put one cable here in one game but uh a negative and a positive how they didn't yeah then the one that's in the car he said that maybe he I know him to crank my eyes you never know and he crank it here and all the woods you can feel your body what are you doing pool and energy and that battery has not got a dead cell in it you crank that it'll take off and it'll keep it'll keep running it'll keep going but if it got a dead cell in it the sooner you cut it back on right you got to go back and do that again how did that one Joe we got too many dead sales in the church Hallelujah I don't think I'm gonna make it I miss man we'll start back to Dragon I think that's a dead cell you always have to jump them off everything to see if I need another jump off and if you need another jumbo you need to get a new battery you need to ask God to return you with a supernatural face how do that you could make it to the Rapture and then Paul say you did run well but what happened to you so Jesus get down to the internalizers have you noticed him being God all he had to do is walk up to the stone the storm that was over the Moonstone that's right right he didn't need them but you got to do something too right when I come to jump you off you got to get the cables and do it he said I want you to roll the stone away I want you to hook it up Holly I want you to put the negative deposit together honey I want that's your job he had to hook it up it's your job to come to church and hear Faith how do you I want to get Faith do you need to come here and hook up the cables in the world that's your job to come here to work Hallelujah and all of a sudden they hooked it up how did Jesus been the son how did God Chatham energy how did his body couldn't do it but the power that was on the inside of him good he cried with a lot of boys all right amen but you know in all this in Jesus ministry like I said his ministry was the energy that he had in that body yeah yeah he intended to release it why do you think he told me it's important I go away if I don't go away you won't have enough energy to make this life hell if I don't go away you won't have enough energy to fight the spiritual warfare you up against hardly because they're going to take us they're going to take a a special anointing up on you to be able to come to Spirit of age when Jesus was in that body that body had a limitation he had to release that limitation right right say what oh yes because if God didn't get tired God didn't get time hello Jesus Jesus moved around in that body and he comes in the disciple be there he'll say this mask open the door the devil said I'm gonna get rid of this energy I'm gonna fire I'm gonna get rid of him he didn't know what he was doing right right if he killed him and trying to take him and if he go to the grain It Ain't No Stopping now when the devil did this he didn't realize what he doing he not didn't own it did he try to get rid of the energy he just released the energy because once he come out of the green I didn't want you to come out of the Grave he never made the statement before in his Earthly Ministry when he walked around before he died once he conquered death baby to hell he slipped up to them say I got all power my energy is all power in heaven in Earth so what he said I'm claiming all energy and I want to tell you what because everybody was walking around here you go he says let me show you now his body is energized he's so much energy now he don't even knock the door honey walk right in the midst of his stuff how do they look he's a distance this is not a ghost put your hand right here how do you put your head put your head right here I do a Sprinkle me a piece of fish how did this body right here is Unlimited in power and then what did he vanish right on this side Hallelujah did he took that same body he's not got power in heaven in Earth a cow come down right you didn't get up another room and get on charge so they had to go to the upper room and they all had to get hooked up to the charger Hallelujah cause they had to wait till they all receive energy they all gonna need this energy because they were too scared to face the public that's right you one of them not me yeah hello you believe in that problem that was countless they were scared to take the challenge of taking a stand for the word right he said wait till you go to the upper room I'll give you power all right I'm gonna put on I'm gonna energize you they all got up there and the batteries must have been pretty low yeah yeah because normally I charge my battery 24 hours after 24

the word the anointing is about the bride what are we going to preach we need to see what we're going to preach uh we find in Revelation one and then we're beginning to begin to look at uh let me say time look at verse 13. Revelation and in the midst of the seven what right one like it done to the woo son of man clothed with a garment down to the what and girded about the what is a woman breast honey show you that the anointing of the shadow man it's gonna be inside the bride he's going to be the bride that praying the devil though not not sure God ain't waiting on somebody else to do it he waiting on you to recognize your position that's why I say it all creation is waiting for the wife right don't recognize her position Hallelujah hey the good about to pass with a golden girdle and then he said and then we begin to go in there did he go back and he picks up the position again his head and his head and it's her world like War as white as snow and his eyes were at flames of Sword a flames of fire and

five four Ministry until they all come right everybody Hallelujah we better wake up we got a job online cause you if he just said sure pregnant in position he says here he says Ephesians 1 verse 22 as he had put all things under his feet and given to him and give to him and get and gave to to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that feel all in all is the body the devil hate this Revelation he hate when the bride get Revelation right because he know he's defeated right he's defeated he goes to use another quarter I'm going to use Christ who God revealed he says here it's the body they're going to defeat the Devil right right the mind of Christ is going to be in you and the body the same attribute that was in in in a in the book of Acts with three when he went down now it says it is now man let look on us Hallelujah to crush your devil God gave us authority to put you down here Halley look on us we come to put you in your place see we go we have none but such as we have we give to you in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk Hallelujah demolition what was it the demonet and with the body to put in me right Hallelujah so now he says and this is what God been doing this message has no love they don't got it all messed up people don't got it all allocated because everybody said the message was William Brennan no brother Brandon never say to mentioned with you all right brother Brandon said the message was Jesus Christ the same yesterday today Avail so when the men that were looking at the veil got blinded from the supernatural so now all they can do is pull up but they made a mistake made a mistake but I'm not looking at no mistake because I'm seeing the word made flesh I'm seeing the same note on it that was on the prophet of God made flesh it's the way you see it right he said well he made a mistake blood was a god like me he's a god allowed me to say anything to throw some people off he noticed so many dead cells was running the message they wouldn't go on in the resurrection no way how did Jesus said they were full of dead man they couldn't get charged up but as many had received him he gave him power right the whole of George when I see a man give up this day I didn't realize that's a dead sale right and he couldn't go up to Pentagon one of them little toys energized that's all right and where'd he go LLY but God gave you something to go all the way he said pause it he told the bird you did run well why your batteries start the weekend now this is the last mile of the way right if I give up now right how to listen to all this garbage people love to hear people people love lies yeah all people love life you want to sell some you want to sell something tell a good lie all you got to do I saw Ella Presley riding a bike in Memphis wow I saw Michael Jackson the other day eating a restaurant you see him eating somewhere today it won't be in this room let me leave that alone but here is and he says here and to be sure that the whole rapture now Luther was a port this message have been building up the body this is why they couldn't have what you have but your hands and feet everybody got to work together now if I wanted to go to church tonight and my feelings didn't want to go we're gonna have problems you say I'm going to church your mind saying your feet say I'm tired you got some miscommunication if you look in the natural realm and they'll probably says something is wrong or you deformed or something if you tell your hand to feed you and then slap you every day except mentally he's not acting right right because the body is made the fitly joint and work together right isn't that why he preached them in Christ and Mr God revealed he said the fail can't look at that even though it's just a little teeny bit of your finger right right you can't do that little bit of your finger is more important to you you think it is you might look at this ain't nothing but a little man it don't mean nothing to me just my little bit of finger it ain't got no it don't got no I don't care about that part you think you don't care about it hit it with a hammer it'll make your body break dance oh yeah it's gonna make you do something you think you don't think I didn't tried it before oh but I got out of there wow oh wow I did things I didn't know I would do you better be careful you might say something you want to say and finger right there got a lot of blood pretentions in it Hallelujah net worth so he said nah be sure either be sure that the whole the whole Rapture now now let me go excuse me to be sure that the whole Rapture now Luther was a boy what's it was a boy the prophets was a boy but they are are not give myself a mine there are not a part just just a revelation that they was making oh goodness and one thing about getting old I love my glasses oh yeah okay you're making up to making up the body excuse me making up the body feet toes on and so forth until the head which we we get to that in a few minutes see that making up the entire Rapture it is the body of the word which is Christ amen outside the dead you were lost there's no Rapture outside the body right and the body at the last day this is the edge of the intelligence of God the mind of God is here the wife is the only one that knows what he won't done with his word exactly she know how to please a mate right Hallelujah that's why he's saying when he's at a bride know her mate the reveal word what she comes to the intelligence we come to the point that the body the brave is what tells the body to cast our Devils when a demon come on your body if the brightness in the signal to fight for you your body don't uh uh uh Alien maybe uh a German virus your brain sends a signal attack that demon so God is giving the mind to the Christ given the mind to the body so we know how to fight spiritual warfare foreign or how religious or no how what your relationship is or what your fellowship is or what your the nomination is organization is your loss outside of the word being in you if you're abide in me the word my word about in you didn't ask what you will because you end the word are the same and the word is God mine how did we gonna take the mind of God and this last day this bride is going to put the devil in this place he said why because the Bible tells you why you think all this judgment is falling how do everything waiting for something to take place either you wait until that third pool wake up right because he told me wait you want that third pool if God don't Supply his bride in this place in the last day if he don't take care of his bride like he did Elijah it's something wrong with the God we serve but he promised I would never leave you or forsake you and at the time we have need of it he was your Revelation that produced the power to get it Hallelujah the musicians come tonight that's what we waiting on I'm waiting on to see God I'm not satisfied I'm not satisfied with just a team right right I just seen a lot of moves of spirit I see a lot of things took place but I'm still not satisfied I'm not satisfied even on the scene the person raised from the dead and I've seen people get healed people received it all kinds of things took place over here I'm not satisfied because I hadn't seen one person yet with a missile grown out right Hallelujah and that's my promise to restore it back everything that the devil tougher I want you to restore that get at missing limb back why because God is going to energize the bride with the mind to do so Hallelujah he's a good Friday going in with a crippled body one leg only one leg on and she gonna be a full mature right he was waiting on the brother to catch us what she is this is all this Revelation being trying to get you to realize Who You Are Hallelujah you say the right word say the right word right right and you say brother will it be that we have need for it God gonna drop
