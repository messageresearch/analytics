TRANSCRIPT
========================================
something drift in a little bit but I want to ask everybody a question and I'll ask it again toward the end I want to ask you a question if brother brand if the opening of the seals if the opening of the seals was a revelation if the opening of the field s and it's open remember it's open why haven't we went around why is it still 50 years later everybody not exactly but yeah it opens individually I don't no wait a minute hold on this my question the dispensation of the book is now open we know what brother Ram said about the first SE you should have been read it already we're starting on the first seal next Sunday but I want to get this out of the way I going to start today but thought this morning I thought take this angle why I mean he told us the white horse rider was Antichrist right that cleared up a doctrinal issue that had been hidden for a thousand years since the Bible was written right right since the Bible's been written since they wrote the Book of Revelation man has read Revelation 61 proad it stabbed at it like we were talking about last night about adoption I believe when brother randam went out to to Arizona remember he did not get the revelation of the seals in Arizona a lot of people think he did they want to give you all these little trinkets of things that he no forget it he was told if you read the book he was told to go back to Jeffersonville because the angel told him everything that he would get doctrinal wise would come from Jeffersonville right right remember brother ra said any kind of Doctrine I feel I I can come here and teach this at the Tabernacle so the angel come to him at the tabernac I me not the Tabernacle but at Mrs Woods house there in the their study but what happened out on Sunset Mount or or out there in Arizona West State where he was at remember he was caught up in a constellation of a pyramid of angels right and what happened out there I believe was his adoption that's when God come down and told him that you're fixing to start your message go back to Jeffersonville and these seals are going to be revealed the whole thing that you probed at thought about uh I was thinking this morning you know even brother rham in the in the 50s and I know brother Dale's going to cover this excuse me but Jes Jesus's Ministry was in stages like he talk Wednesday night brother R's Ministry was in stages the angel told him there were going to be three stages take the People by the hand right tell the very thoughts and intents of the heart and what in other words let me put it in my in my word restoration of all things all right cu the first pull and the second pull was to the world he went to the world with this gift but now when he comes to that third one or the third stage of his ministry CU a lot of times he say my Ministry is going to change 1959 he says my CH Ministry is going to change it didn't change really till 1963 but there was a platform being built the building was being built the Pyramid was being built so that brother randam could go to Arizona have the seven angels come down didn't tell him a thing you know everybody think well there's the doctrine in the message that thinks that all seven angels U Paul irenius Martin Luther Columba oh yeah and brother brandham was the seventh one and that's why brother Bram says that seventh angel was a striking Angel they say he saw himself I don't believe that I just don't believe that I just believe that brother brandham as a prophet sure he could see who those seven Messengers were I believe he could but those were seven angels but they didn't start as Angels bird birds doves Angels right stages Birds they fly right doves they fly but you come up to Angels so you come up to Angels they didn't tell him anything but they were caught up but I believe God told him something this is now your message go back to jonville and it'll be told to you so what happened then was is he preached those seven Messengers mes messages of the seals okay God in Simplicity was a excuse me was a foundation um Revelations 5 or the breach was the foundation right but when he preached those seals he said that it was one of the most Supernatural times of his life right and all the years of the Healing Ministry of Willam brandham millions of people healed hundreds of thousand seriously healed come off a cot thing several dead being raised uh he had already went through the squirrels being see to me that's where you coming up he he was coming up to that point to where you know healing by the hand grabbing the hand knowing the thoughts and intents of the heart and then to me number three is creation spoken word or the word the spoken word because that's what he was coming to right right just like Moses same thing I mean when I read and I do read that Moes Moes said God raise up a prophet like unto me we know that talking about Jesus Christ but guess who that was all also speaking of you [Music] know cuz remember Jesus's Ministry there was no there was no documentation of Jesus taking him by the hand see going through stages like that he preached his ministry was in stages in preaching he didn't start out I don't think by grabbing about no he was God Almighty he didn't have that limitation he didn't have that limitation on his ministry but he did have a limitation on the word that he brought because he brought it in stages the Bible said he grew in Grace and knowledge the Bible says he became perfected by the things that he suffered God had to take him upon that mountain uh brother R me said and said and this is something that I don't understand that might help me I don't understand how he can be God Almighty and human flesh walk up to a mountain and Moses and Elijah have to tell him about him coming back yeah that to me that's hard something you know Paul Peter said Paul says things hard to understand sometimes brother say thing hard to understand cuz you think if Jesus went up a mountain there's Moses and Elijah well he knew who they were the theophany and Jesus knew who that the Moses and Elijah was cuz he's the one that created them he's the one to put them on the earth start with right but brother Bown said Moses and Elijah come to tell Jesus about his second coming about his death Bill and resurrection and second second coming so there was some things that was withheld from Jesus that he needed at the time they needed it I'm like Brother D I don't think at 5 years old he knew he was a messiah that was going to die no he would become neurotic that's right so God in stages brought it to himself the word cuz at 13 remember he goes in and starts reading the scroll well he starts to identify himself then you look in Luke where Jesus comes on up further goes to the church opens the Scrolls and says this day this scripture fulfilled what he do he identified who he was standing there greatest anointing that ever struck the Earth brother r s outside of all the healings and all the things Jesus done the greatest thing that he done was walked in that Temple open scroll and identifi who he was that's what we were talking about last night the the thing we've got to get to and to me it's what the seals does it shows you and and it helps you to realize that you're perfect right that's right there's not one day that Jesus got up out of his bed from sleeping that he didn't know who he was when he come to that point when when when the angel came or the Dove came down of the Holy Ghost on the day that of the baptism of Jesus not making him God but giving him the anointing for his ministry knowing where he was going knowing what he was doing right he knew what he was doing now there was not a time in his his life that he doubted who he was that's our problem we doubt we fear Jesus said fear not fear not everywhere he went fear not fear not fear not fear not fear not fear not you had no fear how can you walk on water with fear how can you stop a a storm can't have fear we always you know you be honest both the lightning hits the ground what's the first thing we do oh my Lord what that hit is coming this way we're going to have a storm right hello everybody oh some of you are already in the Perfection no you just down in your bunker denying it but remember that's the whole key to me that's the headstone if Jesus was The Headstone he knew who he was every day of his life he knew who he was he had no doubt who he was now there was times that I'm telling you there was times he probably had bad days that's right humanly right okay but he never never come to a point that he did not know who he was right and that's what we have to come to like Brother Don was preaching Friday night he he he said I come you got to say I come from God well how many times have I been saying that already you got to be able to say that I came from God and I go back to God you said now wait a minute no what's inside what came to me at the new birth was with God before the foundation of the world it actually wasn't with God it was God right in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God Amen so if we have a word birth then what's our problem what we got to realize we got to start realizing like brother Dev saying who we are now that's right cuz we can't listen because that old denominational idea you hear it all the time you talking about people now are talking about the end time more than ever but they're putting it way out under right mm Jesus is coming but now I don't know if it'll be in my time or not you know we'll see it's going to happen everybody got that yes so brother brandham comes and he comes up to a place and he brings his message brother brandham comes to the place where God says this is what I sent this man to do remember we've been reading it you know even back when we all preached you know brother Dale myself all of us Aaron all of we've all preached and know for a fact that that there stages of ministry but what happens is you come to a place to where you hear your H where God's going to speak through you amen and that's the way it's going to be it's not going to be a doubt or a fear that's right see I believe that's why the angel come to brother Bram right at his in 47 right remember 1947 when he was at the Cave the angel comes walking in and he says fear not he said you're going to be sent to the world you're going to pray for the sick you're going to pray for Kings you're going to pray for monarchs and he's sitting in a Dusty old cave at 30 something years old had never probably been out of Kentucky much all his life or Indiana you know traveled around a little bit and preached I'm sure cuz he was pastoring at the time but this Angel walks in and says your message is going to go around the world he said even cancer won't stand in your way when I buddy that to me and and brother brand saw that he placed it in the word see because an angel can come and talk to you and it be the devil that's right but I believe he he gave brother around keys to scripture and keys to to what he was doing you say why you telling me this it's got to happen to you maybe not an Angelic form come in and tell you what but you got to know your position and when you do know your position at that moment brother Brandon was probably a little bit scared right he was a little bit apprehensive but I don't know that he doubted it the only thing he said was is he said how can how can this happen you know he was questioning he said I'm a old he said he's almost see Moses same thing Angel come to Moses Moses said I can't talk good brother says I I'm an old Southern Kentucky and I can't talk good he said don't worry about that in other words this is your message so brother R took that message and believed it so that's what we and then what did you do he took it to the world that's right he did exactly what the angel said to me that's the Vindication that that angel did I wasn't there you weren't there none of you were there in that cave he was the only one in that cave but by the Vindication of what he said amen by the Vindication of what that angel said it came to pass exactly like he said it he said I'm an angel sent from God Almighty that's right or sent from the presence of the Lord I believe is the is the exact quote so brother Bram knew that an it was an angel because what happened the Holy Ghost Inside of brother brandham agreed with what the man said the angel said not a man but what the angel said right so there was an agreement there so you and I have to do the same thing well the Holy Ghost that we have because remember the Holy Ghost is a seal right right that's what SEALs us to the day of our Redemption I was reading some of that this morning on the Seal of God cuz listen there's only one seal and that's the Holy Ghost right but everything else is outside that okay let me read that for you right here cuz I want you to I want you to get the now brother Rand you're either sealed by the holy ghost or you have the mark of the beast there's no gray area there's no in between see I I had it all right right here here's one questions and ANW the mark of the beast is on today and the Seal of God is the Holy Spirit to reject it is the mark of the the Beast even who sees the holy ghost that you're supposed to receive it and don't do it automatically you take the mark of the beast because there's only two classes to exist all that didn't have the Seal of God had the mark of the beast so to receive the Seal of God is to receive the Holy Ghost to reject it is to have the mark of the beast there's the whole thing that's Christianity in a nutshell you're either sealed in or sealed out on the two sealed in or sealed out all right so that the Seal of God then brother Brown didn't come to bring us another seal or another Holy Ghost right amen he came to bring the fullness to show everything that's right but I still want to ask you a question go back to the same question I asked go back to the very same question that I asked what I ask when we first started we got it in book form he broke the seals to us told us the white horse rider was Antichrist showed the four stages right showed the four stages put it back in Matthew 24 took it back in the Bible where nobody had figured out that's where that Jesus had already preached s right went to Matthew 24 and brought it right back in Matthew 24 told us about that the fifth seal Jew brother rand's idea on that was that the souls all the that that was talking about the souls on the altar he thought was a Christian right which was not right so that mystery was taken care of that mystery was revealed all right The Sixth Seal showing that the two prophets coming to Israel now there nobody pulled out out of the Bible that had to come from the prophet of God he had he opened that six sale to us in its form of letter you hear me in its form of letter cuz like I told you before all all these seals open after we leave brother Brown said the bride goes up in Revelations 4:1 nothing to her between 4:1 and 1921 that's what he says nothing to her nothing this is all gentille now sure we get the spiritual application of it but we go up and come down so the Revelation 61 Falls in between that so that's the SE amen you said what about Revelations 10 well the mighty Angel is going to come to them you don't think Christ is going to preach through two prophets to them right yes right yes but in the days of the voice we know what that voice where that voice came from and you know what two prophets are going to know where that Bo came from they're going to know that that Elijah number four you don't think Elijah 5 is going to know who four Was Elijah for sure knew who one two and three was right so number five is going to know who four was so and and I was sitting there yes Wednesday when Daddy was preaching and he started to read that scripture and I had never really seen it that clear and the very thing he said came to my brain before he said it because he said behold I send you Elijah a prophet for the great day of the Lord right right they said oh that's to us is it all to us that's the Israel hello Israel is looking that's why they know that that Elijah is got to show up before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord cuz it's in the Old Testament you you'll get it in a minute okay you think let it run around in your head for minut you'll get it we know that who that was to us but you see how scriptures know I want to prove to you how scriptures have layers behold I will send you Elijah the prophet now that's the last book of the Old Testament of course now remember to the Jews there original Old and New Testament that's right right it's the Bible that's right the Torah and all the things that go with the Torah that's right I was thinking other day you know um you you talk to people about your hair and your dress and stuff and they say oh that was Old Testament that's in the Old Testament I said well the Ten Commandments were too why are you still using my point exactly I mean if you if you're not if you're not going to use this let's just take and and tithing is not in the New Testament tthing is in the Old Testament thank you if you take all these things in the Old Testament you say well well hair and dress that's in the you you know well hair is not but dress is you know you say in Deuteronomy and the preachers still preach out of the Old Testament oh yeah and that's what I told some I said what do you mean that's in the Old Testament so is The Ten Commandments our constitution was written according to the Old Testament right so you know if somebody ever tells you that say okay you need to take those Ten Commandments out of your off you out of your yard or wherever you know cuz they're no good they that's Old Testament that's old stuff but behold I will send you Elijah the prophet he's sending that Elijah to Israel before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord that's why they know that Elijah that's why when they have their Sedar they open the door and they look for they listen they are literally looking for Elijah we weren't looking for Elijah right right we weren't looking for Elijah in in the B and whatever else you were they never preached that there had to be a a prophet coming in the end time and but Israel that's the last book of that's that's their last book they read right cuz they don't have a new testament they read that and they say okay the ending up of this Testament there's Elijah got to come back before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord so that's what they're looking for so that Elijah to them that's right but we get the spiritual application that they missed the coming of Elijah that the Gentiles get or the world get because he continues on and he shall turn the heart but remember I was thinking I said that's that's Elijah 3:4 and 5ly not just Elijah 3 and 4 that's Elijah 5 4 and 3 or 5 3 and 4 right behold I will send you Elijah the prophet to that's Israel that's right all right to the two prophets right that's why they going to accept that anointing of Elijah soon as that anointing of Elijah comes in them 144,000 they going to turn right straight to that message I mean that they know he's got to come back and they know the end times come you see what I'm saying yes so behold I will send you live of the Prophet number five for the great gra for the of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the what the fathers to the children that was John and the hearts of the children to the fathers prophet in the end time amen so there you got all your Elijah now you got one and two they were alive in the Old Testament John 3 John was the third not John 3 but John was thei and he Bridges from the Old Testament to the new right okay and I want to let's see who was that who was at camp meeting some of y'all were at camp meeting and brother Ryan brother Donnie made a statement said the Old Testament the first book of the Old Testament was James you got to remember he was talking about Written Letter cuz you know we know for a fact that and he brought out the death of the testator because the first book is the book of Acts but that wasn't the first book written the Book of James is the first book written it was written before the book of Acts but it didn't take place before the book of Acts you understand what I'm saying Jun had a little confusion on that that brother Dy was saying that the first book of the New Testament was James the first book written commentary written James was the first one to write it because remember he was the first one to die so he he wrote his first remember Herod killed him in the book of Acts right but the book of Acts was started more you say the book of Acts wasn't the book he was the book that's right right it was not a book Luke wrote the book of Acts and that's what darn was he did marvelous job Friday night the book of Acts was written by Luke and Luke was nowhere around Jesus [Music] nowhere around him never knew him personally but he wrote with perfect understanding and he wrote about the book of Acts so it had to be the Holy Ghost write it right and Matthew Mark Luke and Matthew Mark Luke and John was not written till like ad60 30 something years after Jesus had already left the scene well they had to recall in their mind they didn't have all timer in God looked through every bidle of that really cuz John was old when he went to pmas I mean he lived to be 90 something years old when he went to patmas he was in his 70s and he comes back and he you know writes so it had to be God write these things what I'm saying about this God wrote this through a prophet but you take that Bible that you got in front of you and there's 13,000 you know brother R said it was 969 different denominations well that was back in the 50s and the early 60s I looked up the other day there's 13,000 known denominations in the world now 13,000 known denominations 90% of them besides the ones that preach that that preach out of a different Bible they all preach out of the Bible Well the Bible on this right so what is it about The Written Letter unless it's revealed it's just Written Letter that's right same thing with this right there is a supernatural element hidden in these seals that brother brandham did not right write down okay you hear what I said did not write down did not have written or a sermon but now remember this quote a mystery of scripture previously hidden truth now divinely revealed okay Ryan was saying in Bible Study last night that he's seeing more and more God's revealing more and more of the of it right after he just reads the same scripture we've read like just like hey how many times you read Malachi 4 maybe even thousands I hope but how many of you CAU that that Elijah was going to Israel and then that was Elijah was was John the Baptist and that Elijah was brother bandam you got them all right there to me that's a hidden Mystery that's a supernatural element that was brought to my attention and it should have been yours cuz Daddy two minutes after I thought about it cuz I looked on the screen and it just was like it was almost highlighted and then brother Dale prayed and then he read the script need to start talking about it and that's what he said so it it's God showing us but he's got to show it to us in stages how many times you read seal book how many times you took a body chain I thought the seals was for the Redemption of the body hello I thought the seals were for the redemp how many times you read it many times I wore one book out and I'm starting on another one I got 18 pains I didn't have when I started reading the first one right you understand what I'm saying yes what I'm saying is it's written down it is open amen but it's got to be a supernatural element it's got to be made known to us in this writing yes same thing with the Bible brother Bown did not come to bring us a new Bible right but he brought Clarity to what the Bible said amen he brought Clarity not to what man said amen that's right cuz that's what Donnie was saying he said you know brother R didn't come to bring a new Bible and then there you know the people now are saying that he was wrong here and wrong there no he was if he's wrong the Bible's wrong am then they need to just throw Christianity all the way out right they need to just throw Christianity all the way out that's right if they say he was wrong because he took everything he had out of the Bible but there is a supernatural element Still Remains despite the Revelation so despite 1963 that brother Brown preached these seals we've read them since 1965 51 years now bless you 51 years now we've read this right 65 to 2016 wow most of the people that heard this literally is dead honestly except the they were little children they weren but they didn't get the revelation of it but even brother R said it's gone from you we read we talked about that last Sunday but that Supernatural element this is what happened in 1963 in 1963 a voice came and thundered out in Jeffersonville Indiana to loose those SE to break those seals because the Thunder is what when the seal for of God when the seal break all right they were just like those people sitting in there and that's not listen they were Christians they bride they're going to heaven so I'm not I'm not putting them anywhere I'm putting them in their place it wasn't for them he said in the book questions and answers it's not for you but yet he had to break those to a group of people so that somebody could catch it do the air wve somebody could catch it and carry it on to the coming of the Lord but Paul comes down to the road of Damascus right God knocks him off a horse with a light and a thunder and all these things that happen What Paul say he heard Jesus speak directly to him sa all why pers persecutes down me now the people around him didn't hear it now they heard the Thunder the Bible say they heard the noise right they saw the light right but they never got the supernatural element right and even when God thundered from heaven when Jesus was standing there and he said I'll both glorify it and glorify it again in other words glorify me Father you hear what when Jesus said think it's John 17 glorify me father with the glory we have before the foundation of the world and a voice Came From Heaven what the Bible say people around it heard the Thunder didn't hear voice that's right brother Brandon goes down to SAA Canyon he gets upon a rock he tells the Brethren he said go hide remember they said they were scattering going under underneath cars cuz this big old Whirlwind and it was throwing rocks everywhere he said you know the Rocks was cut out will it come right down over a prophet and did he [Music] run now they saw the action right they heard the noise of the Whirlwind they saw the Rocks getting thrown around everywhere but brother Bram heard a voice that said judgment will strike the West Coast so remember he throw rock up in the air and he said thus sayth the Lord judgment was well God was talking to him that's the super natural element of that happening those people around him he was God wasn't talking to them God wasn't talking to Paul's people that was with him on the road to Damascus that's right right right they just heard a noise they just heard a noise they didn't get the supernatural element even though the noise that listen in every situation they knew something happened in every situation everybody even all those Brethren brother R what what happened what was it what was it they knew something happened but they didn't get the supernatural element God was revealing something to his prophet and all they saw was lights and thunder and noise amen so the Thunder is the voice of God when the seals broke so the seals broke in 1963 by the voice of a prophet bringing a message right the people you you hear them on the tape they're shouting they're they're praising God they're they're raising their hands they're they're worshiping that this great message has come to an Apex of breaking those Seven Seals right 51 years later we're still here this has been printed in hundreds of different languages and it's been preached on and spoke about but there's a supernatural element that we're not getting and you say brother way do you know it no I don't know you got to know it for yourself I'm standing up here and thunder all day long that's right I believe when a minister goes to the pull pit he's thundering out the voice of God if he's telling the truth that's right right but we've got to catch I mean how much of a sermon do you catch be real 10% be real how much of a sermon do you catch well that was a good message Brother D what did I say 15 minutes after my sermon started you just have to shoot me cuz I wouldn't know right but I got an element that come through that yes I got an element that will connect to me that I can go study or an element that could is one of those aha moments you know yeah like the other day you know I've been reading that all my life and you know it was one of those moments to where God spoke to you that's right he called me an eagle that day and he might have called you a buzzard that day but he might have called me a buzzard one day cuz sometimes you satep there and go this must not be for me cuz I ain't getting nothing out of it you know but God I hope it's for somebody else you know I mean really let's be honest we don't get everything but to me here's my whole point that super Supernatural element is not words on the paper that's why brother brandham said the seven Thunders are not written right they're not written anywhere Thunder one you see what I'm saying yeah Thunder too right cuz remember John was getting ready to ride them in the Book of Revelations and God said don't ride them that's right John saw he must have saw something of a symbol or some element and God said don't write that down but remember John didn't get the supernatural element of it or he took a Rapture so he died and went by the grave so it wasn't for him it was for a group of people I believe now on on the on the on the ground at this moment that's right it says Supernatural element Still Remains despite the Revelation I thought the supernatural element was a revelation no this is the Revelation brother B revealed the Seven Seals to us white horse rider handc there's a revelation that Revelation had never been seen before but that Supernatural element how are you going to get how you going to get a body change out of realizing the Devil is a white horse right you're not that's not that's the supernatural element how many of you read in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost that's Bible that's black and white that brother told me one time he said that's black and white plane in the Bible absolutely that's a Revelation that you got to be baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost that's what Jesus said that's the Revelation he gave to the people but they turned it into literal father son Holy Ghost baptism but now the supernatural element never ever revealed Father Son and Holy Ghost was the correct baptism listen God went at the ignorance of people that baptized in the name of fathers and the Holy Ghost right because their Revelation was that it was the father Son and Holy Ghost Martin Luther's Revelation was to baptize in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost and God winked at that revelation of ignorance you say well that was totally wrong absolutely but that Supernatural element had not broke coming up to this age to where we can understand cuz listen get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ ain't going to save you right so there's even a supernatural element past that you see what I mean that how do y'all think that we got it all no we just got enough to get us into heaven just enough that's why I told you about the 10 virgins why did the five foolish go to the wise cuz they knew they had it but why didn't the wise say we've got an abundance we can just pour it out all over you they didn't say that they said we've only got enough for ourself you go get yours mhm cuz the foolish version gets a revelation yes sir yes listen they're white they're Justified and Sanctified truly Justified and Sanctified they think they got the Holy Ghost right until they find out that they don't yeah that's your story see you just keep digging into the five wise and five fols bur you just keep digging in a little bit F five wise say look we just got just enough you know what I'm this let me put it in 2016 version We preached this for 51 years we don't have time to preach at 51 more that's what the five wise is going to tell the five foolish the five foolish vergins like brother Donnie said it's not that they were virgins they were both virgins the key is that one set was wise and one set was foolish I really like that I I'm going to use that in in a sermon because it's not that they were virgins they were both virgins and one had a whale in their lamp and the other was that's correct wise and foolish is the only two words you need to use that's the key words in that whole cuz remember there was five take the word wise out there was five virgins and then there was five more virgins Bible said it was 10 virgins right five were wise put them in the category and five were foolish put them in the category amen that's right you see what I'm saying yeah they were all 10 virgins brother Brown preached 10 virgins there was 10 of them they looked just alike they were virgin but five were wise they caught a supernatural element that these five didn't right amen right listen there's a supernatural element that's going to be revealed right on down through time even when we we're just going to get enough of the seals to change our body because to me like Brother D says the seals is a revelation of the entire Bible entire Bible and you think we can get everything out here I don't think so yes sure um you're saying that um the supernatural power and uh to get a body change you have to be able to say but we somebody here have to be able to say my father and I are one I come from God I went back to God God my father and I are one with other said until you can say that it's not possible to get about J no no that's where and you know it's going to be that that you're going to not believe that you can do it you say that's too simple you find me another way find me another way you just got to believe it yes Abraham believe God right but God gave you the increase so no go ahead no no that's okay no okay it's okay but you're you see my five wi five is foolish that to me that clears up a lot you going to have to talk loud all right hello she can do it uh I just wanted to say without the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's no way that you can see who you are that's correct no way you get that that's right that's exactly right you got to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost or you will not you might you might get Justified and Sanctified that's why I believe a lot of people in the message are just Justified and Sanctified cuz they think they got it they got a revelation listen when I was 14 years old I had a revelation of what happened in the garden I had a revelation of water baptism but I didn't have a supernatural element cuz I wasn't born again but I did get a revelation you said how did that happen well Judas got a revelation didn't he brother Brown said he was justified and Sint that's why brother D's been bringing that out strong so close they don't dece the very La the five foolish virgins were so close to the wise they knew where to go to get all that's right they weren't just way out you under somewhere living off in on an island somewhere do you understand what I'm saying they were right around because they were virgins they were right around they were so close and finally they got a they they got they got a revelation they didn't have the Holy Ghost then where' they go they went to the ones that did let's go upstairs we'll finish this next Sunday but make sure you bring your seal book
