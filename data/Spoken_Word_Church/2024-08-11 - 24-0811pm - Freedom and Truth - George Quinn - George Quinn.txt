I will rejoice and be glad in it for this is the day this is the day that the Lord has [Applause] made amen let's give the Lord a good hand clap of Praise this is the day not the 24 hour day this is the day of the Lord we're in the day of the Lord just like John was on Al palas I don't think we've got out of it we're still in the day of the Lord as it was back 2,000 years ago almost yes sir it's the same day of the Lord amen you love the Lord you may be seated for a moment we'll U start in with the ordination if you guys want to go ahead and sit down leave the guitar available though cuz I think somebody's going to need it I believe the Lord has set in his church officers um to help lead and guide uh this is not a oneman show amen right this is an organism not an organization we're an organism we have moving parts and those moving parts are important and to keep a church healthy we need officers um if you don't if you don't need deacons then uh why did God put them in the Bible why' God put Bish Bishops in the Bible why did he put all these things in the Bible if we're not going to need them but we need them they're needful so we are in need of as brother Bob became our assistant pastor there was a he um became inactive as a deacon and so we had a uh an opening and I had um asked Brother Anderson if he would consider it and he said yes and we um so far we checked everything out and I've told a few uh the other day we talked about it at the meeting and I'm going to read you the scripture and and do like brother Brown I'm going to read you something that he said which is very profound but in 1 Timothy 3:8 they don't have it up on the screen but I'm going to read it to you says likewise must the deacons be grave not double tonged not given to much wine not greedy of filthy lucer holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience somebody asked brother ROM a question one time on questions and answerers says and he was dealing with that because you know he was coming he was coming with new doctrine but it was the truth all right so there were some of those old deacons that still believed in the baptism Father Son and Holy Ghost they still believed in trinitarian cuz they hadn't all come into the message yet well they asked brother random he said if if the if a deacon does doesn't believe what the pastor says he shouldn't be a deacon cuz the Deacon supposed to be the policeman of the church to enforce the rules not make them to enforce the rules of the church all right so holding the mystery of the faith in pure conscience and let these also first be proved then let us use the office of a deacon being found blameless even so must their wives be grave not slanderous sober faithful in all things and we have found that Brother Anderson he's been with us for a while he's grown in the Lord uh his family's grown he's he's a good man of his household he takes care of his family his wife takes care of the family and and we just feel that that he would make a good fit and uh to be a deacon of the church now this is I'll read you this real quick they asked brother Brandon one time this is the placing of a deacon 1958 they said one young man that they found was not exactly qualified not cuz he wasn't the right type of man but he wasn't married a deacon must be married okay he would be he would be okay to be on the trustee board but the pastor and I came together and asked the age of the young man he was in his early 20s honorable just a real man but he was single the Bible requires a deacon to be married he must be the husband of one wife and then another man which was a very honorable man very qualified for the job that would make a loyal man a brother suggested him then after investigating the case that brother had just recently come to the faith so a deacon must be mature enough to not somebody just come off a street and come into the message of the hour and cuz you got to have wisdom yes right to hold the truth and to to hold this truth to be faithful to this truth and that's what a deacon really brother R said you know Deacon's got a a more stringent uh a requirement than a than a pastor a pastor doesn't have to be married right but a deacon does because the Deacon is going to have to come to you one day and say hey your kids are and he remembers how his kids are or were right why you got brother Ryan and you got now um Brother Anderson brother terence's kids old enough to know better now so that we're we're we're through that season of Life same with mine but I believe he'll be a a wonderful Deacon a good a good selection and I really would like to bring him out and this is the way brother Ram did it so that's way we're going to do it so Brother Anderson if you'll come up here brother Terence and brother um Ryan would you come up here please he dresses up pretty good too he has on one of he has on one of my dad's ties so if you two would stand right here look this way Brother Anderson you look toward me CU we're going to take a vote and it's just going to be kind of an informal you don't have to write it down but if everyone would bow their heads except for the two deacons beside me and myself is there anyone in this congregation would see that he would not make a good Deacon could you raise your hand at the moment all right if there's none then 100% that would be 100% vote for then Brother Anderson turn around there's your new Deacon we have Deacon here we have Deacon here we sure appreciate you I believe that um I believe that we to move move forward we got to work as a team and and when you have a gap you have to fill that Gap up and then uh did you get get pick okay and uh also now thank you buddy give everybody give me one more God bless you give him the right hand of Fellowship not the right foot of Fellowship amen all right one more don't go anywhere Joe Joe we got one more yeah okay so now also we believe that um I believe that since brother D's a trustee and brother Gary's a trustee that we need another trustee now trustees are technically uh not voted on but we're going to do the same I ask brother Danny Fountain if he would be a trustee and he agreed so if you would come up here brother Danny trustees you can stay there where you see come on buddy brother Danny's been here a long time that man has [Music] grown I'm proud of him I mean he's older than I am but I'm still proud of him we ain't as old as Joy so are we so D brother Danny has has agreed to be a trustee trustees are to take care of the of the finances of the church we're going to be using that office because that's what brother R said we supposed to do all right all right I'll and I'll read you a little something in here a little bit about it but but we don't need to vote brother Danny is just a outstanding guy uh I believe he handles his wife F I mean his family fine and uh and he's good with his finances so we sure appreciate brother Dane's been through a lot amen he's had a lot of health issues and and the Lord's brought him out of every bit of it and he believes we believe in prayer CLA Because he believes in them stuck everywhere around you know all over the place so brother Danny proud of you bud I love you you know brother Danny and I went to church together for a long [Applause] time we went to the chattah huchi Church of fishion but we didn't know no better then did we no we should have been here but we did fish a lot so we did F oh you got it now Virginia do I need to send you a text on that um pray for sister Regina bless your heart but thank you all thank you all that are existing members that are that that that I depend on for for guidance as I said many times before and I've I've um I my dad's not here to to to guide me in all this so I have to have help I am not a one I I'm not always right this is not on internet okay it's just us I am not and I have many years I have thought I had all the answers and I don't I depend on people now like brother Al brother Chris Long people that have been on the battlefield for years that has years of experience in in in this and like I said before I don't talk I don't talk about you guys to everybody but I do don't call your name I don't call your name but an evangelist can't doesn't know what a pastor knows there would be no way that I could go to Andrew Glover and say Andrew I've got this problem with so well he's not a pastor for brother Michael he is been one for 40 something years so it's brother Chris and brother Dutch Scott talked to him yesterday um about a certain thing and and you know I depend on them but I depend on you guys too I want you to be able to chime in and and give your you know voice your your concerns yeah about all the things that are going on but uh I I don't want to be Al I'm not going to be alone I'm going to be we're going to be around a group of people that knows what they're doing uh like brother Mike different ones they're successful they're successful pastors I don't care about business and all that they're successful pastors they've done they've they went through the hardships they went through the ups and downs and I sure depend on them cuz I got them all on speed di brother claw and different ones you know that's went through this that I haven't went through and and I don't want to I told um I don't know if it brother Ryan or somebody I told the other day I said you know dad had a dad had a a time that he could make a mistake and learn and you know for 50 years you understand what I'm saying for being a younger man and he could flow through the mistakes and be better we don't have that much time we don't have that much time I don't want to make a mistake that that'll cost us spiritually or financially and then it then it take us 10 years to get it back there's not 10 years to get it back right if if God said he'd do a short quick work then he means he'll do it through us so I want you to be the spiritually minded people I want I want you to be able to be spiritually minded enough to say hey let's talk about this thing or let's let's this is is going in another Direction let's look at this but I really want us to look at that down the road I like I said we don't have time to Fumble around we we we ain't got we ain't got but man I'm telling you you look what's going on with politics and if and and you know Trump may be your man which is fine the other one ain't but just think about what brother Mike he said Constantine did the same thing he put church and state together called is self religious I guess this is on the internet but Donald Trump ain't a Christian that's right said he he's not he is not at all okay so why are we depending on him to get us out of here with but the nominal people will because they got that pull of that feeling of the even the foolish virgins going to be fooled I don't know why I'm preaching fooled because of that they're fool foolish virgins you and I are not foolish virgins we're wise virgins we're wise to the things of the world and wise and sure we watch the political scene and sure we watch all these things but we watch them we don't get involved in them right but you just watch this thing and watch this thing coming up you look at the stock market it lost a lot of money the other day it's getting ready to hit the bottom and you know I ain't making no predictions but usually October is the time the crash comes so maybe this year maybe next year but it lost like $1 trillion dollar the other day in one day that a bother me cuz I didn't have nothing in it brother Donnie said I don't even know what went on but somebody's pension got knocked down some so you know but that look one day that morning stock market opened the day they CL the same day it closed as 1.7 trillion had been lost worldwide worldwide not in United States but worldwide just just because why somebody was watching the Monitor and saw stuff going up and down and got panicked and started selling and all you know how that all works but it's coming today folks we're going to have to trust in God more and more trust with trust each other more and more bind closer together more and more that's why I like to have a a team of people here that can uh can do what needs to be done now brother rown watch this he said look and that's what taken place this is in 1959 a super super sense and we'll call Brother George out let him sing a song and that's what taking place here with tonight with the brother Morgan brother William Morgan resigned as a trustee they needed another trustee and brother s was appointed that's why I said it's appointed as a trustee now watch he said it's official as long as the church in our church it's the sovereignty of the church the church moves or puts in trustees the church moves the pastor or puts in the pastor whatever it is it's the church in all that's Apostolic that's the way it has did in Bible times therefore we feel that no one person then is a dictator or something in the church we don't want that every man every person myself in voting in anyone you just got one vote right right and really I don't vote until there's a tie and then my vote would be the counted but other than that it won't be just one vote it isn't what I say it's what the church says what the church says in the body he said you like that oh yes I think that's very scriptural that's the way it should be done that was super s 1959 so we're going to stand to our feet we'll get brother George to come if uh sister EST would you just come and play uh Open the Eyes of our heart and we won't have to have all the musicians back up here we can listen to your beautiful plan all by yourself but you love the Lord I love brother George he's got he's got good him and brother Keith read too brother Keith had a lot of good thing points to bring out and it's just the wisdom of these people over the years that we all need to depend on amen amen seek counsel the Bible says seek counsel so that you can do what you need to do so let's sing Open the Eyes of My Heart as brother George comes speak to us the Eyes of My Heart Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you oh I want to to see you to see

this where this came from was um um when we had one of the sisters that go to another church but she she visited us she would have been here uh in our September meetings but she died of cancer and she was young and she was a real lovely sister a real real Christian real real faith and just it was her time to go amen that's all about it and I mean I'm sure you know the story about the little girl that died and brother Bram said God owes me an explanation but God doesn't owe you an explanation you don't and uh and then when he found out uh uh she was only 21 or something and he found out that when she was two they were out camping somewhere and she fell into the river and and and the anel said brother BR that was her time to go right but but God spared her you got another 18 19 20 years it so God works his own own patterns and his own own will and um we were certainly we went up to the funeral and we were certainly uh Missing offer but uh just before uh that I was up speaking for them and she she' passed away and um her mother's still there her brother's still there her husband's still there and and the daughter amen and uh we sang this song Praise the Lord and this I I heard this song brother we I heard this song um amen praise God Allelujah got the electrics in all it hope I'm not going to be electrocuted here no yes yes and uh anyway he uh I was listening to we we love and I'm sure you'll agree with me we love Christian music in our home amen and uh just to permeate the atmosphere to get the right atmosphere in your house amen and I certainly love the way you do this with brother Bram we've got the S at home we where we can read down the letters as it comes and and be a blessing and so uh one night uh one day yeah that's more like it there one night um we were listening to um um some Christian singing and square portions come on Amen and he sang this yes he did and brother Roger used to sing it up there in uh amen up in Virginia amen and so I sang it for sister Carol and then when brother Jan died up in Virginia sang for him up there and I wanted to sing it for brother Samuel today amen and actually that's who I'm singing it for amen somewhere beyond the grave there is a l where Jesus went to prepare by his own hand and for the sav of Grace there is a rest in place and in a few more days it will be mine would you like to sing with me amen oh some call it [Music] Heaven I call it home oh some call it dreaming Lord oh let me dream on some call it [Music] Paradise somewhere beyond the sky some call it heaven but I call it home someone said you can go by home again things will never be as good as they have been but I've got news for you oh my when Heaven comes in view one Glimpse and you will know the best is to come Hallelujah yeah amen some call it [Music] Heaven I call it home oh some call it dreaming oh let me dream [Music] onise somewhere beyond the SK some call it Heaven oh I call it home some call it hen I call it home amen amen thank you hallelujah amen yes sir it really it really tried its best to slip down onto the floor there but amen praise God and U Hallelujah that's why we say sing and Paul said it upsite from the body amen home with the Lord home with the Lord not just an acquaintance or a visitation home home with the Lord amen so God bless you and then one other thing that that uh that I I looked up for um when the sister where are you that came with the Redemption him where are you there you are okay so I found that other song Amen and uh praise the Lord uh we were looking at the H Redemption and some of the the quotes we got from it this morning some of the hymns we mentioned uh but there was another little one that I love haven't got the words for it so I'm not going to play it but I'll tell you what when I was in India amen um uh I sang it with uh the pastor's daughter and we go back a long ways she was only born and I got the photograph over in Ireland 22 years ago and we had the joy of of being a a help to her in her spiritual journey and uh Amen to see uh her dedication which I dedicated her to the Lord and here I am up on the platform of her singing amen uh come thy found of every blessing to what is that hungry Hearts you know beautiful song Amen and uh praise God uh the the the verse that I can remember most which is it's a uh think the third one it said prone to wonder Lord I feel it prone to leave the one I love take my heart dear Lord and see it seal it from thy courts above then there's another piece but that's all I could remember in my memory today and that's youve got that come th F of Every Blessing well thank you it's been a real joy to be here and it means all the world to me praise God much else doesn't uh apply anymore I just come for the people amen and uh for to be with the bread of Jesus Christ and I'm so glad to be here with with you today amen that's that's the lord it's just the Lord amen and you know when when you're when you're there and you feel that it's just where God wants you to be that's very important amen because I would not like to be on the mission field if God did not want me to be there you know Sister Jun so you really wouldn't want to do that amen and uh praise God my little uh tablet I I I just on the Hub I need a little bit of an adjustment with it to get to get the the the writing up again to me but I've got this all in print anyway so um praise the Lord um you remember this story brother Bram told where he was going through the the the forest and uh he looked down and he always said maybe he'd see sometimes a whiskey bottle or some somebody been out having a party and but this day he looked down and he seen someone had been smoking their carton of cigarettes you know I was telling brother Mark up there in uh Pilot Mountain if they've got the marathon uh gas station and it says up there you know a wow wow two packs of cart whatever I can't remember what it called two packs save $180 wow wow Save $180 I mean just kill yourself but you'll save $180 you know amen I I I I thank God you know I thank God that we're all delivered here hallelujah I tell you what if there was one person in here that would even think of smoking I tell you you get it right up here and we'll pray that off you amen we'll pray that off you sure would praise the Lord amen so um this is where this this message actually came from because he picked up that Carton and it says um you know a thinking man's filter and a holy man's taste and brother Brandon preached that as you know a thinking man's filter and a holy man's taste the word of God so we we we love that message amen and this this message is not that but it was something similar amen I don't know where I got it but I got it somewhere where I was I I looked I was looking at something or something come up and was about a man who was a fraudster a fraudster he really could Rob people of their money but not with a gun but with his tongue amen that would he rob them with their tongue and uh he just made people believe him like whatever he would say the way he just put it over it was so like the gospel truth you know they would do it you see and uh so uh sometimes he said he was a pilot and people believed him he was a pilot probably couldn't even flly playing and and and and other times he was a professional footballer you know and he's telling people and they would go for all this you know they'd go for all that there and he kept what you have to do you have to keep reinvented that's what the thing with science amen I I I preached a series brother we about before the beginning when there was nothing amen there was brother bam said there was nothing not an angel not a of nothing under H to know that there had to be something to tell us there was nothing amen and I'll tell you what and and there was something there which was eternal because everything that was created had to have a Creator amen so there was something greater an eternal spirit that had in all his mind what he wanted to do and he done it Hallelujah and praise God ear nothing he made something Hallelujah and so we're so thankful to that today that uh for for our young people and then of course at the beginning where uh he spoke the word in the beginning God amen I said and and and and let there be light and he spoke the word that's the highest form of faith and he believed his own word brother Bram said and and praise God as a wonderful thing to do amen and sometimes I've had the thing happen to me myself where you've you've said something and you say oh what did I say that for but you know you watch it and see how it comes out and and it was just it was just the Lord amen and so anyway so this this man amen um uh praise the Lord Lord he uh he kept Reinventing himself and uh continually deceiving people and of course he was making a killing out of it all and uh he was what you call a a proverbial or a professional liar he could lie but you know brother Bram said and it's true what he said he said always tell the truth because you don't have to change it you don't have to change it lies you do you're going to have to reinvent that's what I was talking about s they're they're always Reinventing their Theory oh no we don't believe that anymore but yeah this is what we and they're going and they're going and they're going and they still don't know where they're going amen all right but we do praise God it's brother we had said that am mean he mentioned truth a number of times there when he was speaking Hallelujah and so here he was and he defrauded people out of their savings and amen wow his whole his whole life as the story went and it's a true story his whole life was based on lies am mean I know another person whose whole life is based on lives has whole being amen and praise God uh you know so when your Life's a lie like that and you're defrauding people something happens sometimes where you're Reed in and you go to the court Hallelujah and uh praise God so it came to light it came to light and uh so uh when they were having the trial uh the prosecu and solicitor amen said about him he said he has no basis of truth from which he operates right so there he was doing doing what he was doing but he had no basis of Truth to to to to to from which he operates and I was thinking about that I said my Lord that's wonderful you need a basis of truth from which they Alit Hallelujah you don't you can't build on a lie amen you have to have a basis of truth from which you operate amen and this is where I got that praise God and and praise the Lord maybe there'll be uh just but let's pray just before we do speak and you can just be seated it's fine Hallelujah Lord Jesus we just thank you for this day Lord as the Pastor said amen it's just not 24 hours it's the day of the Lord hallelujah the Lord's day amen and we're living in that in in that time lord and dear God we just pray father today that Lord uh or we go home to our own places that Lord you will speak another little word father that it'll all come together and Lord that you will just bless it to the people and Lord may we all get something from it today Lord from your from your wonderful uh uh amen table Lord we pray it in Jesus Christ's name today take full control do what you want Lord and father God we give it all to you and we give the glory to Jesus amen and amen praise God so Hallelujah when I was thinking this amen um where your treasure is there will your heart be also that's very very true amen very true and so what we classified or what we call the message was freedom and Truth amen freedom and Truth amen so this guy didn't have that his whole life was based on a lie now that's a strange thing because I I'm sure if I said you does anybody here know like a habital liar I'm sure somewhere between you were a kid and going to school and all that I'm sure you met somebody somewhere where you could say right that's them and and and I certainly can there used to be a boy in our Factory and honestly he could tell you a story you wouldn't believe it or you would believe you know he always had a story to tell and so praise God it went back to you know brother Bram says and and situations like that there was a point in his life when it happened there's always a point if you sometimes people went off the rails and you could actually go back to a point like the like the the girl that the brother Bram talked about and she had been delivered and then she's G past the the the dance hall and she stopped she shouldn't have stopped Hallelujah she should have just walked on Amen praise God that's my old life I'm not there anymore I'm a new creation Hallelujah and so anyway uh he he uh even when he was a child he was always lit for school and so amen the teacher would call him out amen and she'd call him out out by name Michael Michael come out to the front and so he come out says you're lit again like what why are you lit oh miss miss all all the all the Sheep were Ling last night me and Daddy was up to 4:00 and all this he was a liar and wonder nothing was happening at all but that was a story Hallelujah and that's what happens folks and the devil's like that the devil you got to when you realize that the devil when he speaks I preach the message on what the devil has to say and you take it the whole way through the Bible when he speaks and he's a liar hallelujah praise God he's just a liar amen so even bam and looking down at Israel said they couldn't be the people of God look at them all that carnality he's fire hallelujah hallelujah Moses and that group had the the sh of the king and the camp they had all the the Tabernacle up there and we're walking with God Amen and so praise the Lord that's the truth now so amen uh truth is a very important thing praise the Lord and actually our study is to bring out aspects important aspects of Truth amen because the way I would put it like this that each time it talks about truth in your Bible it can actually mean something a little bit different there's different aspects of Truth and you'll get to see that I hope let me see about five just after after okay praise God Amen so it's very important amen and uh uh amen like our reading Amen in John 8 and 31 let's see what it says said then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him they were Believers if you continue in my word then you are my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth will make you free Hallelujah so we're a free people we're in Liberty today amen and you shall know the truth and that truth will set you free praise God and and so that's where we are today hallelujah amen and uh praise God he says uh Jesus answered amen verse 34 he said Jesus answered uh truly truly or verily verily I say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth forever he says if the son therefore make you free you will be free indeed Hallelujah so thank God uh you know uh there was people in brother branham's day sitting at a table a breakfast table and brother Bram was having a little talk afterward and the next thing is he' say something maybe 13 people get up and walked out all from one denomination because he they he said something that they didn't agree with oh my my my my my so praise God you'll know the truth and the sun shall make you free and I'll tell you what we don't need any denominational uh like uh I've I've been in churches like that even Pentecostal churches where they would put up a big thing at the outside there and we believe this we believe that we believe in the Trinity and they'll give you all the reasons we believe in speaking in tongues as the evidence of the the baptism of the Holy Ghost well you ought to go to Africa and see some of them people you know dancing and and speaking in tongues and say oh they must have the Holy Ghost there amen you got to qualify things like that and you can't just tell people uh that that that said praise the Lord amen and we're certainly not against speaking in tongues you know that but I'll tell you what praise God certainly not but Amen to say that's a witness amen uh the Holy Ghost would fall Upon A group of people some people could speak in tongues may we never do it again in their life but I don't mean to say they've got the holy ghost that reinfor in the just on the unjust so amen and praise God and uh amen he goes on to say in verse 44 I don't know if it'll come up what it does but he said you are your father that devil and the lust of your father you will do he's talking to the Pharisees and he says he was a murderer from the beginning now where have you ever heard anybody telling us about serpent seed yeah where the Bri's the only ones that I know that really believe that amen and praise God it's the truth hallelujah it's the truth amen and and he was a murderer from the beginning I mean the serpent had to get that Spirit of murder from somebody and he got it from the devil praise God and he killed evil amen and so it says uh uh amen and he Abode not in the truth he abod not in the truth amen why because there is no truth in him amen hallelujah there is no truth had to had to take a notice of what he said about this coming election amen just there praise God you know I mean really if you believe Donald Trump as a Christian well you want to go and meet him then and you find out that he's find out that he's not you know you see them them kind of people have to be all things to all men that's right but thank God when he stands for Israel I say amen hallelujah He he'll not let Iran set up their missiles you know on the West Bank so as they can blow Israel apart they not going to let that and they won't let it happen either and so amen it says there b nothing the truth there's no truth in him when he speaketh now think about this young people all of us when he speaketh he speaketh a lie he is incapable of telling you the truth a professional liar bet a liar cannot tell you the truth they don't even know the truth as a matter of fact you get to the place and that's where the devil is today you get to the place where you believe what you're saying is the truth and yet of all us a darn right lie but you believe it's the truth you know if you had an interview with the devil and and asked him do you really believe that the bread's going to have a a Rapture he' probably say yes but we'll stop it or something like that because he's a liar he's a liar amen and thank God we need advice uh we certainly don't go to him to ask for it I'll tell you that amen and he's the father of Lies amen and that's why I hate to when I I've heard some talk with young people or whatever not you know and they've been listening to the devil you know oh God doesn't love you you only think he loves you and he'll lay it on like a real thick amen and he'll give you all these reasons why you know that God doesn't love you praise God he'll give you many reasons and yet you'd be going onto word you'd be have to go on word to believe that amen for God does love us and and you know he he doesn't forget us hallelujah amen he will never forget us amen and so hallelujah amen and then Jesus said to them he said uh and because I tell you the truth you believe me not which of you convince of me or convict of me of sin as if I say the truth why do you not believe me amen why do you not believe me now let's really go into this here hallelujah truth amen like our reading we you shall know the truth the truth shall make you free the word is used uh it's a it's a Greek word uh ala ala that's as much as I'm going to say about it but that's the word I'm going to use amen and that's what it means right there when it says you shall know the truth and the truth will make you free amen that Al it's a noun a noun is a person a place or a thing Hallelujah so that's what a known is very important and basically it means the reality the reality lying at the basis of the appearance amen now the real that that word you you look it up in Greek that's the reality lying at the basis of appearance now what does that mean in plain English or simple English amen just you take about like the pillar of fire well thank god we've got the we've got the photographs of it Hallelujah and and and and and and testify of that amen and so what is the reality of the basis of what appear years it's the truth amen it's the truth hallelujah it really happened amen praise God and I I I I later on I'll go into another little aspect and and we'll look at we'll look at that as well amen and uh praise God it's that's a good example the light was caught on the camera a camera can only take the light that it sees but this light was with it Hallelujah and so we know that and we know that the examination and I couldn't care less because I know that anybody's going to question that amen they are not going to be uh for it amen if they're questioning it they're not going to be for it and we know exactly what was done then nobody ever questioned that nobody when all around the world Hallelujah with the Full Gospel Busom as men and everything and and and we ac we accepted it then and we accepted George D lissy's thing on it so it's the truth hallelujah because that is uh that is the the the the the reality lying at the basis of the appearing amen so praise God and that's wonderful amen and uh that was a reality and it's the truth and and and may I say that if I spoke of the Miracles of our Lord Jesus like he performed like feeding the 5,000 amen and you and I know amen that's nothing to him praise God if there had been 10,000 people there that day they would all got fed Hallelujah and I love when I was in Israel because I tell you you'll never do God I don't care what way you want it you'll never right do them and when I was over in Israel with my wife and we went up to where that place is where the 5,000 were fed and um amen it was cooked it was cooked meat it was cooked bread cooked fish Hallelujah and uh on the movie there you know Jesus of Nazareth they were all big things of raw fish you know well nobody's going to eat that Hallelujah it was cooked bread as the little boy had for his lunch it was cooked fish amen now I guarantee you if you you were uh eating that amen we had our drinks today if you were just eating cooked bread and cooked fish you'd be thirsty and you say well he doesn't care we we've had a good food you know so he does care because when we got there we found that this is the fountain the seven fountains Hallelujah right there with that happened there was seven fountains Hallelujah and I said my said to my wife look at that look at that he provided water for them to drink after they had the fish and the bread Jehovah jar Jehovah jar all the time amen so praise God and you look at that amen what is it what is the reality lying at the basis of what you see praise God you know I said at one time that you know maybe if some of them phes had been looking over at that and said H I wonder how what kind of a magician trick is that there that he's trying to do that praise God but God doesn't operate with people like that Hallelujah you got to accept it by faith and what you get is real it's the truth hallelujah amen you could ask any of them people they made know all could tell you well he prayed for it that's all I know and it came to me and we had it we had a good we had a good lunch you know yeah and then we had the water to drink you know so praise God hallelujah that's the way it is amen and you could look at any of his stories amen uh the truth of Walking On The Water see what is the reality lying at the basis of what you see that's the truth he's walking on the water Hallelujah you know you and I know that he could do that Hallelujah and he did do it Hallelujah so praise God that was the basis of reality amen of verity or truth what is true in any matter under consideration praise God now you can look at your own life as as brother Ryan did this morning look at the little things and and really to know it's true Hallelujah it has to come into that word amen what is true in any matter under consideration Hallelujah so so that's very important amen remember when brother branam was talking there he went down to the right family and amen um this is uh what is true okay in any matter under consideration and there he was at their home and he spoke of the squirrels being created amen and that's a wonderful thing and he he was lifting up his hands like as if to to to show how he was shooting at it and he could shoot it right in the left die he was a marksman amen and uh and little how spoke up she said that's nothing but the truth amen well there you are you see what what is uh amen uh the the the the basis anim what is true and aner so we're talking about squirrels hallelujah what is true about that Hallelujah is that it actually happened it actually happened that's is true about it and and and I I think I told you before that when brother Chris was over from Scotland amen he went to Charlie Cox and they were just having fellowship and talking and and Charlie said you know them squirrels we at them that night okay but he said you know them squirrels didn't have a belly button they didn't have a belly button see now that that is what what she said that's the truth they didn't have a belly button they were spoken word creation that's as simple as that they didn't have a mama father see so so it's wonderful Hallelujah and and and what is true or truth in any matter under consideration amen and uh praise the Lord and of course the holy said spirit said to him give her what you wants you know you when you come and speak to God Like That by faith hallelujah amen I tell you what something will happen something will happen amen and it did with her and she got her two boys converted and they were converted Hallelujah brother Bram asked the older boy that when he got the tent which brother Bram thought he would he's a human being remember when I get him a tent would you you drive the a big truck with do the chairs and all he said I well brother R him and uh that boy was the one that was giggling and laughing when he was talking about shooting squirrels that got there and creating them and all that but I tell you what when he said I give them to you to sister right they fell down and they're weeping and said Mama we want the Lord you know and and they they they were they were baptized and praise God serve God hallelujah well amen now so amen and she got what she wanted amen and that's the that's what this word means amen that word uh veritable uh amen uh the word it means true genuine real actual actually happened Hallelujah it actually happened praise God and uh I don't know if it's here but might be later but you know he was telling brother Brown brother Perry green and another brother he was telling them about that and Perry green um probably most of you don't know par green but uh bless the Lord don't backl over that amen amen but per green was standing there you know and uh and um you know he a big man you know he used to you have to look up at him you know praise God but he had a weish Valor he wasn't going to take any Guff you know I can tell you that amen and there he was and and brother Bram I just throw this in for you brother Bram told a little joke he said there were um uh up in some Northern uh State and there's one Undertaker and he he phoned up to another Undertaker and so he said yeah what can we do for you he said I got a big problem and he said what's that he said well you know there's a there's a fellow he was up from Texas and he died and he said we ain't got a casket big enough for that guy you know said you do would you have anything he said no no I don't have anything in got he said what am I going to do he said oh there's an answer he said what what what should I do he said just take a big pen stick it into him and he said you'll fit him into a shoe box so he told her he told her to Perry all right okay not not to be disrespectful hallelujah amen so Hallelujah that that's what the word means amen that that that truth that Verity that truth Verity means true genuine real actual it really happened and that's what he said to per green per turned and said this man's either either a prophet or or he's he's fooling me you know and brother Bram just slowly turned said brother green it really happened it really happened praise God that's that that's wonderful hallelujah amen and uh truly or justifiably so-called amen uh amen um this this word uh that we're using here and uh amen uh the word uh uh let me see uh yeah like in Romans 1:25 you don't have that coming up but it says who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and serve the creature more than the Creator who is the blessed and forever amen now the truth of God may be be said this way the truth concerning God or God whose existence is true amen that's what it could really and they've turned that into a lie well they're turning into a lie today amen as if it never happened praise God but he's there he don't change God is still in the throne and and he'll always remain on the tone it doesn't matter if your name is Vladimir Putin amen or whoever your name is praise God Amen the AL Toya over over in Iran amen and I'll tell you one thing you know the Iranian people are nice now I actually LED an Iranian family to Christ when we were in turkey and they had come over the border and uh amen the girl said she said my grandmother knew a little bit about that but she said we we we don't really and I started to explain about Christ and wanting to come into your heart and and to save them from their sin and we let her and her husband and the children there but four of them all together Iranians and and and we LED them to the Lord so I'm I'm glad about that nice people they were praise God and uh praise God but it's these it's you you know how it works it's a it's the guys that uh 1% or 2% can keep everybody else down if they've got the right setup amen with with with with secret place and arms and people being done away with and all that that's how they rule they rule by fear amen and so praise God yeah Simon Vietnam amen and they've got and China you know China photo photographs everybody they know what you're doing at any time I tell you they do praise God and and Britain has a lot of photographs too you know you can have a some guy jump out and he stabbed a soldier and you thinking how they going to find him goodness made the had them within 24 hours because they got that many cameras and they just home in it all before you know it they've got them so praise the Lord but that's okay amen so uh uh amen here the truth of God is in itive of his faithfulness and the Fulfillment of his promises exhibited as Christ amen in Christ amen Verity and Truth amen and that's what that word Verity means it means genuine and and and absolute Hallelujah and we thank God H and and you know we do have an absolute in John 16 amen where Jesus said I am the way I am the truth I mean the old pilot you could well imagine you know he didn't go to church every Sunday pilot but you know something and he said what is trueu I've got an emperor and all out what is truth you tell me said I'm the truth praise God it's in a mind it's in a person embodied in a mind amen and he says and no man cometh unto the father but by Me So Very ver Verity and Truth what is true in any matter under consideration so you want to know what truth is you're looking at it right now did it did it you know they say that that pilate committed suicide whether he did or didn't I wasn't there to see but I'll tell you one thing praise God he was standing there and he didn't realize like brother brunham talked about the flunky that brought the invitation about Simeon to come to the to the the big party and uh brother Bram said I wish I'd been that flunky I wish I could have got within two feet of Jesus Christ and handed him the note and say Lord have you anything to say to me amen have mercy on me a sinner but he missed it all he missed it all he missed it all so anyway praise God now amen truth as a personal exence Excellence Excellence truth it's good to be have the truth it's good that's why the message is the truth it is really is Amen Hallelujah Jesus said in verse three if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you under myself that where I am there you may be also so what is it what is true in any matter under consideration so here he's talking about the glory and he's telling them he said let not your heart be troubled Hallelujah you believe in God believe it also in Me In My Father's House of many mensions what are you looking is it true he said he said this is the truth amen he said if it were not so I would have told you I would have told you and so therefore it is the word that is using for truth hallelujah is the matter under consideration so praise God for that no matter what what it is amen and and he says in John 14 he said H and I pray the father and he will give you another comforter that he may abade with you forever even the spirit of Truth amen hallelujah there's no lies in God he said I'm the Lord I lie not M lies but God does not lie hallelujah amen and everything that you can test praise God uh by what what what by your faith and know that it's the truth amen and so praise the Lord amen and let me say I'll go on he said I will not leave you comfortless well we know that's the truth why cuz he hasn't left us comfortless so Pro preaching about his presence today Hallelujah he husband walked away from us and said well I hope you make it in and good luck or whatever that's what we say in Ireland good good luck you know well I said I don't believe in good luck we we don't need good luck you know maybe Good Fortune I'll stop with that but not good luck amen un that's the Rish amen they think they're being really you know oh good luck to you then you know yeah okay so praise the Lord even the spirit the world cannot receive that Spirit hallelujah amen and uh because it seeth him not H and neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and he shall be in you and I will not leave you comfort I will come again to you amen and he said when that Spirit of Truth has come he will guide you I like that amen and two things I may say in here that when Brother Anderson came up here today and I was looking on the screen over there praise God and what I could see was a sincere man a sincere man a genuine man Hallelujah a humble man that wants to do what he's asked to do by the grace of God Amen and and and we had a we had a a baptism just a too months ago it was nice praise the Lord and um praise you just keep praying for our fellowship amen because we just want to grow and we just the the Catholic church is going down we want to go on Hallelujah up up up up and uh so uh we had a baptism and I got the tank all open you know and um I remember when we opened that tank and uh we were kind of scooping out the big digger was scooping it so this guy you know he was like a kind of smart like bird and he he knew what I was doing he knew what I wanted so I went over to him you know this big grin on his face and he's he's digging this big hole out right in front of where the pup was going to be and uh I said to him hey and what what I said you just man your own business and keep digging and I'll tell you when to stop Hallelujah he knew friend well we were going to put a baptismal tank in there and we did and the only thing is it's so deep down that we we we couldn't get it an actual um uh pipe out so we could amply it easy so what I have to do is I got my little pump and we pump it out and then we get it all freshed up again it's quite a little work for me and amen and getting out at the very end you got to scoop it out with the water H uh and and I did that got all the lovely fresh water in and the girls came down and they uh would come come dressed ready for the baptism so we had uh them from Dublin uh the pastor his daughters got baptized and then these two girls from letter Kenny the nigan girls are Nigeria and uh what I liked about them was was the sincerity then them girls you could even see it if if you looked on the the photographs we took you can see the sincerity am amen and that means everything and praise God they were really serious and I said to them look I I'll never I'll never force you to do it it's not in my agenda uh when God tells you to do it and the mother said brother George they've been talking about it for months now amen I said okay they're ready then we'll do it and we did it and I saw two sincere girls amen abula and Grace and they got baptized and it was wonderful day and I could see the sincerity of their hearts right there in that tank amen as each one got in and was baptized and and as I'm saying sometimes you say things that you and and there I was speaking to uh the parents from the the platform there from behind the pulpit and I said you know something a sister toyan brother P the father was there I said these girls will never give you a de's problem in their life that's what I said to her I said you watch and see if that's not true because they were their rage tenderhearted so receiving the Lord and getting baptized and amen and that's the truth praise God so that's going to be the way it'll be amen and uh Hallelujah so it's wonderful to be guided into all truth as the Pastor said today praise God we need help we're not a one man ban you know uh you know at that we we we need we need help Hallelujah and uh praise God in Ephesians it says if so be that ye heard of him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus amen or you could read that even as truth is in Jesus cuz he is the truth and and that meaning is not merely an ethical thing amen but uh but it is in all its fullness and scope that's truth embodied in him amen praise God the truth that's what it really means hallelujah amen he was that perfect expression well it's true and you know I was I was reading I started off in Genesis and my I got going in Genesis and when I got to the book of Exodus had a new brother B them like that get on to the Book of Exodus excuse me would you bring us that water thanks milon and so I get into the book of Exodus and uh kept reading the way through the Old Testament thank you very much praise God God bless you forgot to bring it out amen yeah amen that's good and so um when I when I I was reading Ezekiel and you know if you read it's hard it's not e easy reading and you can say oh but what about the B of the dry bones and we all preaching that yeah it's true that's only one chapter oh what about go and M yeah 30 we know about that and know there's little places where even at the beginning where he talks about seeing the glory of the Lord and and as the appearance of a a man Hallelujah fire oh my but then you come to that D it's very hard reading in between after that because God is telling the people all the time all the time where they're falling short and and asking them to turn stop you can do it there's still room stop and I'll bless you but they never did stop Hallelujah and he took Ezekiel over and he saw them all there beside the temple worshiping worshiping uh what's her name asth or whatever praise the Lord breaking kicks onto her H H terrible terrible but you know so that's the whole way through that right into the the the um right up to Malachi and uh God always telling them hard to get right don't you know get right ey this is the time they never did and then I got un the New Testament and I thought wow what a difference praise God this man comes along Hallelujah we read about his birth we read about the mai we read about his uh Lage and all these things and then it just jumped into his ministry and praise God and he starts to tell them Hallelujah that they never heard in the Old Testament he said ye have heard it said but I say unto you Hallelujah blessed is the pur and spirit for theirs is the kingdom of God hallelujah and that was the difference I said what a difference what a difference hallelujah amen always telling them get back get back and the remant always did but my goodness here the Lord Jesus never a man spoke like he did Hallelujah never a man and I thank God for that amen n okay praise the Lord n Hallelujah so there that word amen even is the truth is in Jesus amen the perfect expression the representation or Revelation by language of Truth Yeah by language just like we said there it's true blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of God the Kingdom of Heaven hallelujah amen and he said I have told you the truth which is in me not merely verbal but with sincerity and integrity of character he said which one of you can condemn me of sin he couldn't do it because he was sinless sinless spotless Lamb of God and that's what it means there the perfect expression the representation or Revelation by language Hallelujah of the truth amen and it's the truth hallelujah and so wonderful Amen in John 33 he said 33 he said he hasth received his testimony hath set his to his seal amen uh a witness that God is true amen God is true Hallelujah and it says amen uh that's wonderful for he whom God have sent speaketh the words of God that's wonderful and it's it's true all the way through the the Testaments it's true this this afternoon amen and I'll just leave that out I could say something there but the next the next word that I wanted to go on to that it's it's a not a known but it's spoken of you'll see here in a minute it's spoke enough of true true what is true what is factual and it's uh Ali Thea Ali Thea amen and uh Native amen is a word added to the known to give it quality to give it Clarity amen what it means what it means so amen what is manifested truth what what has been manifested hence actual true to fact hallelujah amen like crossing the Red Sea praise God and people could argue about that to the the CH come home I don't care anything I know how God did it but a strong East Wind and that was dry for them and they went AC cross ujah that's all and I know Moses spoke that word lifted up what was in his hand amen and thank God you know like the little woman Elicia said her what's in your hand she said well got all these empty jar she says some oil borrow borrow manyy borrow borrow you know and uh I think somebody was telling me sister Jun about brother um sharik there preaching about digging the ditches said no matter what anybody said keep digging if God says dig dig Hallelujah that's wonderful good it was really good amen and so uh amen that word means amen uh to give it quality it means uh true to fact like the crossing of the Red Sea is true to fact Hallelujah and and and means uh that truth is there Hallelujah so amen years ago I came up with a definition of Truth myself which really doesn't cover it all but it does cover a part of it and in the in this study today Hallelujah it says I I I I I came up with a thing uh amen that truth was that which is according to the facts now if you think about that is true praise God now if you said to me you know I came here this morning and um we had so and so for breakfast and and you know uh we got a nice Journey over and well I said is that true and you say oh that's true because it's according to the facts that's what you did and you can repeat it so if you go into the scripture it's exactly the same thought that which is according to the facts Hallelujah did he do these things or did he not did he say to the Centurion that day uh Lord if you come my servant is sick but but I'm under authority too and I've got a hund soldiers under me I say to the one come and he comes I say go go and he goes Hallelujah and he said I know that you've got Authority Hallelujah I know if you speak the word my servant will get healed Hallelujah and when he when he left amen and he met up with the other servants and he said Lord master master he they healed Hallelujah he said when did the fever break he said but such and such an are then he realized that was exactly they are he spoke to Jesus Hallelujah so why this word a AIS amen means that which is true to fact amen true to fact Hallelujah it really happened it really happened amen and you look at for instance when when brother Bram went beyond the curtain of time folks it really happened Hallelujah he could he could look at himself back lying on the bed like this Hallelujah and he's in another land he's in another dimension and it was real he said you could feel them hallelujah praise God and and I like oh I like this hallelujah amen brother Joy said it but he said do you know when when brother Bram went over there Hallelujah you notice he said they were clothed in white that's true but when you going to Revelation I'm not sure what the chapter is but it's it's a chapter where the the Jews are through the tribulation and through the Holocaust are given they're given white robes but we've got them Hallelujah we don't God doesn't need don't have to say oh I'm glad to see you there's a white Ro for you we've got them Hallelujah they are given to them but we've got them tonight we're clothed in white Hallelujah and that is that is awesome it is really awesome Amen so praise God uh amen and that's what I came up with so when Jesus walked on the water it's according to the facts he really did Hallelujah listen to this amen um amen praise the lord it's only when Peter walked on the water and took his eyes of Jesus he began to sink amen and Jesus lifted him up and he didn't say Well done Peter at least you got 10 fet he said why did you doubt why did you doubt praise God my when he gets a man or a woman that's not going to doubt the promise praise God hallelujah you you'll get something out of that there amen so then they were in the ship and they came they worshiped him saying offer truth thou artart the Son of God when brother brandham I told you about per green so I'll leave that there but of a truth Thou Art the Son of God they worshiped him Hallelujah and I'm getting on rightly so so praise God I hope not to hold you uh too much time amen so what is true in any matter under consideration Amen in John 1 it says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and full of Truth hallelujah amen amen and and and he was Hallelujah everything he said everything he explained even on the cross Hallelujah he's still speaking the truth amen and they're scratching their head I wonder was that really a lger who was it they didn't know amen they didn't know but praise God he was full of grace Hallelujah and he was full of Truth amen and uh and the law was given by Moses but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ because there was a Heavenly Tabernacle and and God said to Moses now he couldn't have had all that in his mind there no way for every curtain every ring uh everything that was going to be in the Tabernacle that God just told Moses and he said all I remember all that he actually saw it up there somewhere the way it is with God hallelujah I'd love to see it too amen praise God the heavenly is much greater than the Earthly it's gone but the one in heaven is still there praise God and and we thank the Lord as we read it out from Hebrews this morning amen so praise God Amen that aaliah amen that which is true in any matter that you consider praise God and that is so true of our Lord Jesus amen and so then in Matthew 22 it says the the the herodians came to him amen always trying to trick him always trying to trick him they always thought that are more smarter than he was and so one time they said Lord what what should we give to Caesar they're really trying to trap him you know and if he says oh don't give Caesar anything said oh you're an enemy of Caesar just broadcast that if they say no don't give him nothing they say oh no he's he's an enemy of Caesar and if he says give them something they say oh he's supporting the Romans and they got him they had him they thought they had him until he said show me a penny just so simple God in Simplicity and there he showed him a penny H said who's that said that's Caesar amen I think it's Nero actually on about I might be wrong there but Augustus or whatever but anyway he said then you give to Caesar what Caesars and as far as we're concerned Caesar ain't got nothing that we want Hallelujah and he said then give to God what's his gods and they went away what did he say what was never heard anything like it amen praise God and so they said to him in this particular story they said Master oh Master teacher we know that thou are true oh yeah lovely yeah yeah yeah and you know just soft suing him you know and uh praise God and it says and you teach us the way of God and Truth he could have stopped him right there and said then why do you not believe me but he didn't so then they go on and uh amen so praise God uh that's what they were coming to amen that what is true in any matter under consideration and you care for uh no man for thy regardest not the person of man should we do this should we do that they were just trying to trick him amen praise God but they didn't realize that he was the truth praise God and embodied in human form amen and uh you know it says in Romans it says what if some did not believe shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect God forbid let God be true and let every man a liar as it is written that thou may be justified in thy saying and mayest overcome when thou are judged amen so Hallelujah for that and I will get into a few quotes before I I close but there's so much of this that's in the scripture that I had to keep it in the scripture for a lot to to make this out amen and U he talks about in Peter about Sylvanas a faithful brother unto you as I suppose I have written briefly exhorting and testifying that that this is the true grace of God wherein you stand Hallelujah folks you know as the man said you got to know that you know that you know that's all about it Hallelujah you're not there no doubt there's no in your mind you know it's the truth and you believe it and why cuz it has set you free you're at liberty today Hallelujah sh sing do whatever you want you're at liberty hallelujah amen and uh praise God he said the true grace of God in which you stand or that the grace of God the unate favor of God is true to fact amen so if you experience it that's the best way you know the scripture says taste and see that the Lord is good see there there you have it is that the truth is that according to the matter under consideration if I taste will it be good and he said yes you taste and see so when you taste and see and you a lot of you have done that amen that the Lord is good the Lord is good thank God for that I thank God Amen all of my life you've been faithful amen and then in John a new commandment I read unto you which thing is true in him and you because the darkness has passed the light shineth now shineth not only a light but the True Light that was to come into the world Amen and the Commandment is true Christ is true to fact Vindicated to be the truth and the light amen and Jesus said himself I am the light of the world that's the great lighthous Hallelujah that's shining amen the light of the world may I say it like this he said I am the light of the world may I say it like this I am that is the person of God Amen the person Son of God hallelujah I am the illumination of the world that means to see the truth brother Bram said the word of God is the light in this hour the revealed word is the light of the hour Hallelujah so praise God when you can see it you don't understand why you can see it but you can see it and you know it's the truth you've got that witness in your heart hallelujah oh my it set you free it really set you free we're under no other spirit hallelujah praise God Amen yeah and an want if they ever want to I remember one time I did preach U I don't know how I ever got this going this but I preached to a bunch of priests actually so yeah Catholic priests well I knew F Well I said George you're only going to get one shot at this so I took my and there was a guy up in front of me you know and uh praise the Lord he was the way he preached was you know we should think and he would stand there thinking and then he would say something else it's a good thing to be here you know what's he talking about you know and he kept preaching like that and he' stop and he would be thinking about the next thing he was going to say then about two minutes later he would say and know I said look I said for forgive me for being different you know but I'll tell you what I didn't need new minutes to say what I was going to say next praise God and I knew you know yeah some of you may believe it but I'll tell you it's the truth hallelujah it's the word of God if you say you believe the word of God you'll believe what I'm saying today you know and and that went on to God and funny enough you know none of them came and said well thank you for that but you never be back here don't even know how you get in but I'll tell you what all the little nuns that were at that meeting that day they all come around and said oh George that was wonderful that was wonderful hey you know something if I could have got a hold to some of them nuns I tell you what I mean spiritually I tell you we could have cuz their hearts were kind of tender I tell you it been lovely to to to to to to see some of them really and I do believe some of them could get a justifying experience amen but but my my but they enjoyed it they enjoyed the word hallelujah so praise God uh that which is true to fact actual amen and uh the thing is true amen he's the light of the world Hallelujah let me go right on and I'll I'll finish up just as quickly as I can yeah have not too much more to do praise God Amen and um Amen Let me see here yes uh in in one John five I've left out a few there but don't matter and we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son Jesus Christ this is the true God this is eternal life Hallelujah so that's why we're not we're not pondering about brother Samuel or a Wonder we know we know Hallelujah where he is this morning or this afternoon praise God it's wonderful and we know also he wouldn't come back here say said brother George no I'm sorry I'm not coming today yeah right we're having a meeting up here you know it's very good hallelujah amen and we understand that I wouldn't call my wife back at her not for a million pounds no a million dollars wouldn't do it praise the Lord so praise God because I know where she is is a far better place than this amen and and and we know him is true that's lovely Hallelujah in Thessalonians amen there's another little word here it's a little change Ali Theos Ali not the alios and it has a little another aspect of of Truth so he says in one Thessalonians it says for they show us what manner of entering we have had unto us probably the the prophets and now ye turn to God from Idols to serve the living and the true God Amen and and to wait for his son from Heaven whom he raised from the dead even Jesus which delivered us from the Roth to come Hallelujah so praise God when it comes to Easter time when it comes to Sunday what do we do you know brother brandham didn't say it he said we come on a Sunday morning to honor the resurrection that we believe you walk in that door you're saying I believe that he's raised today I believe in his presence with us today I believe he's walking with me every day I believe we're on the King's Highway walking in the way Hallelujah and I believe one day we're all going to get to gather around a great big table Hallelujah thousand miles long and I'll tell you what a day that will be when every tear will be washed away hallelujah oh no more pain no more sickness amen hallelujah so this denotes truth in the sense of being real and genuine amen and it's used of God in Revelation 6 amen where it says and they cried with a loud voice saying hard long oh Lord holy and true Dost th not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth amen and so what I said it meant there this denotes truth in it being genuine it's real Hallelujah and they're asking how long and he told that's where he gives them the the REM amen and praise God that which is not only by name and resemblance but the real nature corresponding to his name how long oh Lord truth oh always comes back to the name always Hallelujah truth Amen brother praise God and that's what they're saying oh Lord how long amen true and holy amen how long and and the the real nature corresponding to the name amen that this word and and every aspect uh corresponding to the idea signified by the name that the name real genuine but there's something else like Jehovah jera praise God now Jehovah is his name but then there's tagged on it Jara Hallelujah so what is it his name his nature his name is Jehovah his nature is that he provides so we're coming to a god that provides our needs hallelujah we're coming to a god that you know you might some of you might be saying it's all right for you to say that there but I'm going through a real rough time I wanted a little pity party here today you know but you not get one for me n of my people I don't believe in pett parties amen praise God if God taking you to a hard time he'll get you to a hard time Hallelujah just keep on trusting amen and so his nature is that he supplies our needs you know when you get really into a a real problem amen and uh the Bible says he's a very present help in time of trouble that'll go with this morning a very present help in the time of trouble so what have I to fear what have I amen I'm leaning on the Everlasting Arms with my Lord so near I'm leaning on the Everlasting Arms so what happens whatever happens it'll work for our good amen the whole purpose of it and that's the same with it I didn't even mention the C meetings but that's all work good for good to them that love the Lord amen because it declares what God fulfills by the meaning of his name amen he's truly God Amen he's truly mine Hallelujah and he's the opposite to fictitious to counterfeit to imaginary to simulate it or pretend it he is God the true God and distinction from all over everything that's false he's the true one that's it he says it in the book of Isaiah he said I am the Lord beside me there is no other other there false gods and all that but beside me there is no other I'm the one amen above all L on the highest the highest spiritual being the highest order of spiritual being it's in God it's in Jesus Christ today Hallelujah so amen and it says these things says the amen the faithful and the true witness amen a faithful and you know you don't want someone to come along and tell you lie they don't want you to do that you know somebody come up and say oh I know that you could buy something for you know maybe $2,000 and you're going to save 3,000 or something thinking you don't want somebody coming along telling you that amen oh I believe it oh that would be wonderful you know you don't want it has to be praise God a a faithful witness someone that ain't going to tell you a lie amen and I'll tell you the very few of them about but I'll tell you what you can you can prove it amen and uh praise the Lord that that that's it amen that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even his son Jesus Christ this is the true God this is eternal life Hallelujah wonderful and could have throw this out to you just that take us home and Che on it okay and then I'll bring it back to you brother Hallelujah listen to this the name of God what is it then brother Bram said the word interpret it as is the manifestation of the name of God so just what I've read out to you that's actually explain it the word interpreted Hallelujah uh amen declares the very name of God Amen manifestation of the name of God the interpreted word just think about that so when we looked at jovah G there we have it's God and it's his J and his n and and all these Shalom and all these different one the Lord my shepherd all them different things and that Revelation that interpretation is a revelation of the name of God and that's what he says that's the prophet said you said God's only prophetic place of worship type

amen and he said be not afraid he is true to his utterances of his own word amen everything he says he'll stand over it amen I I sometimes you'll buy something you'll go in there somewhere and you'll buy something and the boy he's a good man he's a good salesman and he'll tell you everything but he won't tell you that it's how long it's insured for amen and then it breaks down you come back and say well it's not insured for that you see and you've been had that's just all about the simple thing about it but praise God here amen he is true to his utterances to his word and I'm glad about that cuz you got that's a foundation you got to have that praise God cuz you can't build on nothing else amen and praise the Lord that word signifies that he's true to his he cannot lie and Revelation three Amen to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write these things sayth he that is Holy he that is true amen it's all there it's all all these different aspects of the truth what he says or what he does and all these different aspects of the truth but praise God that that truth sets you free amen these are the true says of God these are the true says of God Amen that's wonderful he said look and I often wondered brother weird why did he say that what did he say he said I am the true Vin no we had to wait to the 20th century to have a Prophet come along and tell us why right why because it was a false F right in that that's right Hallelujah he knew then when he said that there's a false F nobody else knew knew it we didn't know it you know and brother bro had to catch that Hallelujah why because if it hadn't have been he would have just said I'm the vine but he didn't he said I'm the true one amen so there's going to be a false one amen they'll grew together they always there's Twins and all that there are parallels but I'll tell you what praise God when the White Horse rid went out who went out to meet them the lion of the tribe of Judah I'll tell you God has not

king then Jesus answered th say I'm a king to the end I was born for this cause I came into the world Hallelujah and you know we knew that when he was hanging there the only Kingdom he had was in Hearts his disciples the only Kingdom he had Hallelujah here on Earth but praise God he's got a kingdom Hallelujah today amen and he's not just to you and I he's not just a king he's our King he's the king King of Kings Lord of lords and we love him today amen the Lord is the true God he's the Living God I know that you know that well you don't look anywhere else for another God cuz there ain't no other God to go to but we've come to the real one the one that that made it all happen Hallelujah and spoke the word not big banget he spoke the word hallelujah and it happened amen and thank God for that hallelujah amen okay he said this is eternal life that you may know the only true God God and Jesus Christ whom he has sent amen okay let me just come right down to if I may praise God yeah yeah I I want to finish up just going to leave some of us but you've got enough you've got enough to to get my thought today now remember the fraudster he had no basis for truth upon which to operate you have every basis there is to operate cuz you know everything he said is the truth everything he said is the truth it's going to happen if he said it's going to happen it's going to happen if he says I'm going to bless you he will bless you praise something that there Hallelujah it will come to pass amen and uh so Amen brother Bram says this and I want you to notice this he says uh if this is my last meeting with you people he said the vision the visitation of the Angel is true amen hallelujah praise God and and and I remember it was Ronald that said it that caught my attention where where where where he said you know do you really believe that the the devil knows what happened in that cave do you really believe that the devil knows an angel appeared to brother brandham he said certainly it happened and you can tell where because when the prophet love young children and this little girl came up for prayer and her eyes were so crossed amen and and he thought about his own little girl amen that was dying in pain 10 months old oh my what a time that was and brother Branham could never explain that right that's one thing that he couldn't get from God why why that little girl why that little girl why did you take her Lord and he never got an explanation cuz God doesn't ow as an explanation and the best thing and I can tell you people this the best thing as I operate my life if you don't ask the question you don't need an answer it's only when you got a question do you need an answer but if you don't if you've got trust you say Lord I trust you I I I I just trust you amen that you're in this thing and was going to work out to your glory that's and so when brother Bram was praying and this nothing happened couple of times he prayed for her then he began to realize there's something going on here and so he took that little child up in his arms and he didn't he he had finished praying he just turned directly to the devil and he say you know an angel of God appeared to me in that cave and he said leave the little girl and bang her eyes just so that proves it that surely proves it amen that that that praise God he says the vision the visitation of the Angel it's true and I wouldn't even have time to listen to anybody to say oh I don't believe that okay if you don't believe it it's not for you just as simple as that hallelujah praise God I'm and among Believers today hallelujah we're among Believers we're Believers today not unbelievers not even M Believers we are believing what we've been told Hallelujah and it is true amen so he said if I die this moment it's the truth hallelujah and what about the true seed it will happen just as we have said the people of God uh are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger of the age amen and Revelation 10:7 and he will be the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning Hallelujah that is thus saith the Lord hallelujah I love that thus said the Lord the only one that never said thus said the Lord was Jesus cuz he didn't need to say it he was the Lord hallelujah amen and what a blessing folks for us to see the godhead as we see it what a blessing Hallelujah you know and and and and the Simplicity of it is is that you cannot take Christ away from Jesus you just can't split them they will not split Hallelujah and you cannot take Christ away from God they will not split and there you got the whole godhead right there the fullness of the god H dwelling in him Hallelujah and it's wonderful I can go on and on about thees right there Hallelujah and all the whole way through the Bible amen but if I may say this I've got a very very funny people people talk about two Lords that's a contradiction the Bible says there one Lord amen so so but I tell you what I think brother we very very quickly amen it's all to do uh what I read out about Jehovah uh jarah and it's always if you look at it Jehovah capital L capital O capital r d know brother Samuel went on through that amen see Lord hallelujah that's him and he's God you know but then when he became adoni when he took on that first visible amen uh a theophany amen and God was rested in in that theophany and that you could touch it you could see it at times it became flesh Hallelujah that's the Adon Adon amen and the lovely thing is that you could use that word of Abraham as he said my master Abraham or Adon my master see and and and it would be that way but you can use it of God hallelujah you can read it all way through the Psalms many scriptures have got the Lord and in Lord in small little cases amen and that's ad don't I what he's talking about and you know when the Lord Jesus came along and he said to them that that day at the first foot washing in communion he said you call me Lord you are calling me adoni and that is who I am if I being your master and your lord wash your feet so ought you to wash so God bless you when you have your communion service I thought it made have mean this weekend and I would have enjoyed it but hallelujah amen so it's wonderful praise God that that it's all there for us to see it's all and the more you look at it the more you just Rejoice the more you just thank God Hallelujah for to be able to see what you see no Hallelujah and I'm right down here uh amen right at the end praise God and amen that indicated Prophet that came Malachi and I love that I love that really I do love it you know when he said there uh and God in Simplicity he said amen when did your heart I heard a little preacher preaching on on it about Elijah not but when did your heart get turned back to the Pentecostal fathers that's right and he says when you believe the truth that's in the Seven Seals

your life then he turned your heart back to the Pentecostal fathers amen wonderful Hallelujah and he will bring back the elect in the last day amen and that Vindicated Prophet he'll restore the truth
