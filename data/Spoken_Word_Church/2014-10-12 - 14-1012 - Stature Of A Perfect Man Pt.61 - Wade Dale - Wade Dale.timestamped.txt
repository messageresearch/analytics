[1:07] writing the different books and the
[1:08] different fonts the pages have changed

[1:42] they're waiting for the headstone
[1:45] see we got to come to a place and wait
[1:47] for the headstone we're not coming to a
[1:49] place and there it is we're going to
[1:51] come to a place and wait on it because
[1:53] remember there's other people in their
[1:55] Journey
[1:56] this got to come to that also
[1:59] you may come up here and say I got
[2:02] brotherly kindness
[2:04] where you at Lord
[2:05] well that's okay he might be dealing
[2:08] with you over there but I'm still down
[2:10] here trying to get my temper out of the
[2:11] way
[2:12] so but if I'm if God saw me make it you
[2:16] know what he's going to wait on me right
[2:18] he's going to wait until I get some get
[2:21] it first some can run faster some can
[2:23] run slower
[2:25] so
[2:26] you don't all come to the same place at
[2:28] the same time all right same way with
[2:30] adoption and all these other things all
[2:31] right
[2:32] we come to the east at revelation
[2:35] we may sit in a sermon and listen to
[2:37] brotherdale preach and say
[2:39] and that's best I've heard and and don't
[2:41] start working with you and the guy
[2:42] sitting beside him you going
[2:44] you preached out about two years ago I
[2:46] got that you know but still you can add
[2:48] to that right you add to the Revelation
[2:50] all right you don't just sit there and
[2:52] sleep say well it's not for me today
[2:54] Lord right unless somebody get something
[2:58] preaching nothing then you you know then
[3:00] you say well maybe Lord that's for
[3:01] somebody else not for me
[3:04] building this Monument building this
[3:06] statue see the it starts off with a
[3:09] foundation stone face virgin always the
[3:11] information Godly brothers and kindness
[3:12] now what does it do then you're waiting
[3:15] for the headstone which is love for God
[3:17] it's love and he controls he is the
[3:20] strength of every one of these things
[3:21] that's right yes sir
[3:23] now stop for a minute and go back to our
[3:27] example of Jesus Jesus went to the River
[3:29] Jordan at the beginning of his journey
[3:31] not the beginning of his life but the
[3:34] beginning of his journey as the Messiah
[3:36] he was born to Messiah but God
[3:38] identified who he was on the River
[3:40] Jordan now look you weren't born Messiah
[3:43] you become a messiah
[3:45] because you were born in sin you were
[3:47] born different than he was that's right
[3:49] he didn't need a new birth he was born
[3:51] right the first time so he didn't have
[3:52] to come to a journey and realize he was
[3:54] lost
[3:57] you know I I pray for me because I'm
[3:59] doing the ministers meeting next time on
[4:01] uh what happened to the Soul at the new
[4:03] birth so it's going to be a touchy
[4:05] situation but you know I thought
[4:08] all these people are saying well I
[4:09] always was eternal and I just realized
[4:11] it and you know I remember when I got
[4:13] down on my head and you know when God
[4:16] came to me and saved my soul
[4:17] I didn't realize I was always Eternal I
[4:20] realized I was lost yeah
[4:22] because a relation realization of me
[4:24] being lost
[4:26] put me on the journey towards realizing
[4:29] that yeah I was always Eternal with God
[4:31] see right
[4:34] brother Brown preached two ways he
[4:36] preached God's mind to you and then he
[4:37] preached to the people that needed it
[4:40] right everybody understand that because
[4:43] remember in God's eyes Luis your angle
[4:46] is already eternal
[4:47] never sinned a day in his life because
[4:49] remember one Speck of sin in front of
[4:51] God he has to destroy it every person
[4:54] has to
[4:55] boys brother Anthony can't see you he
[4:58] hears your voice
[4:59] through the blood right he hears The
[5:03] Sinner and the saint that's right
[5:05] amen
[5:08] but he knows you're a child
[5:10] because he birthed you at the new birth
[5:13] you're a child of God but you always
[5:15] were a son like his brother around said
[5:16] you always were a son in my mind of God
[5:19] you always were a son
[5:21] God if he looks at you any other
[5:23] different way but
[5:25] if he made you a son
[5:31] that's why I was preaching the other day
[5:33] a chosen in him not chosen by him
[5:38] the Bible says chosen in him so whatever
[5:40] he was in Christ whatever Christ was if
[5:44] I've accepted that that's what I am
[5:47] but if I was chosen by him that'd make
[5:49] him a respective person
[5:51] right right I've chosen by him then
[5:54] Adolf Hitler could walk up to the white
[5:56] throne and said you chose that man
[5:58] before the world and he had no other
[5:59] choice and you told me I don't you're
[6:02] saying that I didn't have a choice so
[6:03] you're you can't be a just judge God
[6:06] right amen
[6:09] let's just get real with this he can
[6:11] walk up and say oh well there's a mom
[6:14] black standing up there on him
[6:16] on the podium with you you know they
[6:18] want to throw them
[6:19] why is he up there
[6:21] God says well I chose him and I ain't
[6:22] Choose You
[6:24] ain't right right
[6:27] he'll say this man I offered it and he
[6:30] chose it therefore being omnipotent and
[6:33] being all-knowing and being infinite
[6:35] he could give you an angel at Birth he
[6:38] knows when you're going to get born
[6:39] again
[6:40] so I settled with God but it's not with
[6:42] you you have come down through
[6:44] permissive will
[6:46] that Genesis 1 never dropped down into
[6:49] permissive will right
[6:51] yeah Genesis 1 26 never came down into
[6:54] permissive will until you received it at
[6:58] the New Birth when you call
[7:02] out to God it was God calling you really
[7:05] that's right you heard from your
[7:06] theophany you heard from this that God
[7:08] already saw by foreknowledge he saw this
[7:11] before the world and you would want it
[7:12] more than Adolf Hitler and he'd give
[7:15] Adolf Hitler a million years he Adolf
[7:17] Hitler would never change his mind God
[7:18] knows that so we have to put it into the
[7:21] mind of God that when brother Brown sees
[7:23] you always was eternal you never sinned
[7:24] on any day
[7:26] now listen
[7:27] he's lying if he's talking about this
[7:29] guy that was out in the world that's
[7:31] right
[7:32] I'm gonna preach this morning come on
[7:34] you know he's lying if he said that but
[7:36] he's not looking at that person
[7:39] yeah right right he's looking at that
[7:42] part of me that and I had a brother tell
[7:44] me the other day he said well well if
[7:46] your soul came to you at the new birth
[7:48] and that's that's a pre-existence of
[7:50] souls I said there's only one
[7:51] pre-existence of assault yeah and that's
[7:53] Jesus Christ right my soul didn't come
[7:56] to me at the new birth that's right
[7:57] God's Soul came to me at the new birth
[8:00] that's right
[8:01] hmm
[8:05] your soul came when you were born when
[8:07] you were born born in sin Champion
[8:09] iniquity God give you a soul perfect
[8:12] able to communicate with this world but
[8:15] it had a nature on it that was a damage
[8:17] that was Fallen that was
[8:19] you understand how we preaching here
[8:20] yeah
[8:21] but you heard from that theophany that
[8:23] Genesis one man that Genesis one man
[8:25] never failed
[8:28] Adam fell
[8:30] but Genesis one man that was in him
[8:32] never failed right
[8:33] the flesh man Adam is what sold us out
[8:36] brother Brown said then every soul after
[8:38] that I got close brother I said Every
[8:40] Soul after that has been blackened
[8:43] blackened by sin because see then
[8:45] everybody got a choice all the way
[8:46] through
[8:47] and Adolf Hitler can't say well you
[8:49] chose him and didn't choose me no God's
[8:51] gonna say Adolf I came down on December
[8:54] the 4th 1937 and you turned me down
[8:59] I would have give you what this man's
[9:01] got if you would have accepted it just
[9:03] same way with Abel and Cain there they
[9:05] stand Abel and Cain stand here today
[9:06] yeah right right able and Kane are
[9:10] standing here today able accepted the
[9:12] sacrifice Cain couldn't accepted it and
[9:15] turned it down to me that's just the
[9:17] example because remember Genesis starts
[9:18] everything right exactly okay
[9:22] and there was a seed preparing
[9:25] with you before the foundation of the
[9:27] world and when you were young when you
[9:29] were little there was no seat in here
[9:30] right
[9:31] right it was the word
[9:34] right here is what he knows you're going
[9:36] to accept you're going to accept the c
[9:38] word of God
[9:40] the brother told me he said well what's
[9:42] that deep colony of the day
[9:44] it's my free Mall agency
[9:47] I'm able to do that
[9:50] there's got to be a deeper never respond
[9:52] you know your brother Brown said that
[9:53] sure right sure but it's my choice it's
[9:56] what's calling
[9:57] I chose to call out I chose to accept
[10:02] Gotta Have Fish Gotta Have water first
[10:04] right so God's here
[10:08] God's here he's the water he's already
[10:10] got it ready for you
[10:11] but the fish has got to be put in the
[10:13] water to live same way with us so
[10:17] who are we
[10:20] man how about something
[10:22] 329.
[10:24] right in here oh let me get back to my
[10:26] point Jesus went to the River Jordan and
[10:29] was baptized and there was
[10:31] a Dove came down and said this is my
[10:32] beloved Son and who am I pleased to
[10:34] dwell
[10:35] right then about three years later
[10:44] three years later he goes upon a
[10:46] mountain
[10:48] and God says this is my beloved Son and
[10:49] whom I'm pleased to dwell here ye him
[10:53] put his stamp of approval on that man
[10:56] that that's me you got to hear from that
[10:59] man right there
[11:00] all right same way with Billy Brown
[11:03] he goes through all that you know down
[11:04] at the river
[11:06] in 1933 he says your message will
[11:08] forerun
[11:10] right four run the returning of Jesus
[11:12] Christ he didn't say you would right
[11:14] that's right how many times have you
[11:16] ever brother I've never said the angel
[11:18] said you would forerun he said your
[11:20] message or forerun the coming of Jesus
[11:22] Christ so it's the message not the
[11:24] messenger that's Forerunner
[11:27] that's why the people who believe he's
[11:30] going to come back that's why because
[11:31] they think
[11:32] we would call them the second time right
[11:35] but he never said that go back and put
[11:37] in all your quotes you want to put he
[11:39] never said you were before he said your
[11:41] message or a dumb message is the forerun
[11:44] the coming of Christ which is exactly
[11:46] the truth
[11:47] so there brother around was and the
[11:49] angel come down
[11:51] and said your message before one second
[11:53] coming across then you go skip you know
[11:57] 30 years later
[12:01] 30 years later
[12:02] 1963 or 62 he goes up on the mountain
[12:07] God brings the cloud brings the angels
[12:09] He says go back to Jeffersonville in
[12:12] other words this one is going to begin
[12:13] your message because remember 47 to 63
[12:15] is not what Malachi 4 is supposed to do
[12:18] in its entirety right nobody understand
[12:20] that
[12:21] but if you do away from if you do away
[12:23] from 47 to 63
[12:26] everybody see what I'm pointing out you
[12:29] do away with 47 to 63 that's a building
[12:32] right process
[12:35] if you say well no we just get the third
[12:37] pull or we just get what brother Brown
[12:39] you know we just we're we're the third
[12:40] four people
[12:42] uh to me I don't like people preaching
[12:44] stuff like that but anyway that's just
[12:45] me right here's the third pull yeah
[12:47] right here is the coming back of Christ
[12:50] when Christ came down
[12:53] to reveal those Thunders to reveal the
[12:55] seals
[12:56] that's what he came in in in tight you
[12:59] see what I'm saying this is this is it
[13:00] he's become the Divine love you at the
[13:02] new birth
[13:04] but the Apex are the uh The Headstone
[13:06] remember it was rejected now I don't
[13:09] know if I'm gonna get cut today but
[13:10] we'll get to it next week
[13:12] this right from
[13:16] and I say again from here to here
[13:19] the apostles had that yeah so brother
[13:21] Brown didn't bring us a new message but
[13:24] from 47 to 63 he was bringing the hearts
[13:27] of the fathers I mean the children to
[13:30] the fathers that's right right
[13:32] faith of the Father the children
[13:34] babbling Pentecostal babies from
[13:36] children to the fathers now this is the
[13:38] faith of the father this is Paul this is
[13:41] all the ones before uh back in the first
[13:43] church age calling those people Peter
[13:47] that's what was lost down through the
[13:49] church agents
[13:50] was this part right here this position
[13:54] so God when he started with brother
[13:55] random what's the first name preached
[13:58] 1947 look on your table you start
[14:00] freaking faith right then his last
[14:04] sermon was communion
[14:06] all right so that's what he preached
[14:07] from Faith to communion
[14:10] but right here is his message
[14:13] that's the message of Malachi 4. yeah
[14:16] that William Branham according to
[14:18] Revelations 10 7 because you can't take
[14:20] this Malachi 4. mankind four is restore
[14:22] that
[14:23] but remember the brother said he'd do
[14:25] two things in the church a book One turn
[14:28] of Hearts of the children back to the
[14:30] fathers
[14:31] and they literally literally remember I
[14:34] preached a sermon on literal literal is
[14:35] not a type
[14:36] it's the thing if you're literally who
[14:39] you are then that's who you are you're
[14:40] not a type of anything and that's this
[14:42] that's the headstone the aspirins when
[14:45] the seals broke the brother around them
[14:47] The Headstone came down sealed him off
[14:50] as an adopted son of God and God said if
[14:52] you're going to hear anything from him
[14:53] because remember this had already been
[14:55] preached
[14:58] this has already been preached down
[15:00] Through the Ages Paul preached this
[15:01] right Peter preached this now John
[15:04] Wesley didn't preach all this I'm sure
[15:06] he preached some of it but he didn't
[15:07] come to that he wasn't required to come
[15:08] to it you got it it was eaten down in
[15:11] this church age here
[15:13] and brother Claude made a good statement
[15:14] I read a few months ago
[15:17] well paragraph 330 what's been done it's
[15:19] manifested through seven Church ages and
[15:22] seven Church age Messengers he parallels
[15:24] the church ages with
[15:26] the statue of perfect man right
[15:29] so then we understand so far what I'm
[15:31] talking about if you don't raise hand
[15:33] I'm saying again don't worry about it I
[15:34] don't want to lose anybody
[15:36] but this was preached by Paul Peter
[15:40] James John probably even Iranians and
[15:42] some by Martin
[15:43] but then he got eroded here in this age
[15:47] and it was either way go back to the
[15:49] bride tree or go back to Joel right it
[15:53] was either way and this was all lost so
[15:55] brother Reynolds came back to preach us
[15:57] to hear
[15:58] I will restore
[16:00] this is a restoration
[16:03] okay he will restore
[16:06] right all those things that were lost
[16:09] but this had never been preached only by
[16:11] one person
[16:12] Jesus Christ
[16:13] Jesus Christ was The Headstone right
[16:16] he's a headstone Jesus Christ was The
[16:19] Headstone still is the Head Start
[16:21] all right
[16:22] but remember all through the Bible and
[16:24] all the pyramids this was left off why
[16:27] man couldn't understand it
[16:30] they got him in partial down here man
[16:32] when we were talking about putting them
[16:33] put a little line right there that's
[16:35] that's the Cornerstone
[16:37] the pyramid is the little pyramids and
[16:39] it grew into a great Mountain
[16:41] but this right here is what caps
[16:43] everything off this right here brother
[16:45] around says three paragraph 329 right in
[16:48] here right in here
[16:50] you see I've got in between all these
[16:52] Works in here now the original copy I've
[16:55] seen it one time but I ain't seen it
[16:56] since he's got Holy Spirit right here
[16:58] and there's waves
[17:00] coming down through here
[17:02] remember in Sister Shepard's dream she
[17:04] saw water flowing out right that always
[17:07] beer coming down through Christ saying
[17:09] Holy Spirit the holy spirit is above all
[17:11] this welding this together
[17:14] now see once you've reached this right
[17:15] here he's welding you together
[17:18] okay he's welding you together
[17:21] down here he's putting you together
[17:26] that was good I just got that got it
[17:30] sometimes I can come up face the Lord
[17:33] but now see he's putting you together
[17:35] here
[17:36] see but you put the studs up for the
[17:39] house and not put One Nail on it and go
[17:41] and then I'll go
[17:44] but once you put them
[17:49] you put your nailing it together he says
[17:52] right here he says welding it together
[17:54] so there must be a piece there to weld
[17:57] you can't weld air
[18:00] and a nail can come out and they all can
[18:02] come out wish that happens down here
[18:04] brother Brown said though if you stink
[18:06] that nail which means you drive that
[18:08] nail down and it's sticking out about
[18:09] that far yeah it'll hold for a little
[18:11] while
[18:12] but something can pull it out or
[18:15] something can knock it over but if you
[18:17] drive that thing down for them pneumatic
[18:19] guns that we got it will drive them
[18:21] nailed outside well there's no way you
[18:23] can get a hold of that and pull it back
[18:24] out
[18:25] so the pneumatic nail of God's word
[18:27] nailing us together
[18:28] welding us so there's got to be a two
[18:31] pieces to weld you can't weld one piece
[18:36] all you're doing is put a little solder
[18:37] on the end of something welding it
[18:40] together is that
[18:41] that's what he's doing with us he's
[18:43] welding us together building a what a
[18:46] perfect church for the Capstone to cap
[18:49] it off
[18:51] we need we have to go let me start we'll
[18:53] start this there next Sunday he says
[18:55] when will it when will it when has it
[18:58] been what's it been doing
[19:02] and if y'all can't bring your book or
[19:04] or bring your uh tablet or whatever he
[19:07] says starting back here where was the
[19:09] church first founded what was the
