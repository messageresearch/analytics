»     10     †     Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.

way that they might go to a city of habitation for he satisfied a longing soul and filthy hungry soul with goodness hardness and in the shadow of death my own generation because they rebelled against

Lord and we ask you to just bless each one have your way with all of us and guide us in Jesus name Amen we're going to ask for verse 9 if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man by what means he has made whole be it known unto you all into all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him that this man standing here before you oh this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved you may be seated Lord that is blessing for the reading of the word now I know it means what it's saying and it's right but you know sometimes you look at the scripture you know but if you look at that or think about that life verse it says that where there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved in other words there is no name for nowhere under heaven hurt that can save you or have anything to do with your salvation except the name of the Lord Jesus Christ all right so get that thought in your mind and you'll understand all right now just background a point this is just after the Holy Ghost falling on the people in the upper room you know and the things that are happening and you come down to chapter that's two and you come down to chapter three and you'll find this is the first miracle was the healing this recorded other disciples you know where Peter named the man laying at the gate you know I've been lying from his mother's womb and he said you know arms of them and and Peter them said you know silver and gold have I none but in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk it was the first miracle that took place when I in it so odd that you could take a miracle that even it's recorded on through 2 3 or 3 & 4 that I couldn't say anything because the demand was standing there in other words they knew about it the fries and all knew this man had been coming and sitting there daily asking arm so it wasn't a secret thing but what about when you wind up in a man that's been lame all of his life and you see him out there jumping up and down and running all over the place and all like that and then you've questioned the people that that would happen by you know in that odd could we be that away no no no we couldn't well that's kind of the thought today could we fit in a category that maybe not knowingly but be like them you know they were not bad people they were great people they were all the priests and the different things you know and they lived it free Stalin lived in the temple and went to church every day and all of the great things that they were but when a man gets healed then the question about it and then turn around and warned you not to preach the more that night because they did that was you that got on over into the fourth chapter in other words they probably beat him in fact a figure they got by with it but they threatened them a couple of times and you know they told them not to do it and Peter get something he says well we don't know where to obey your obey God said but we're not worried about it we're going to go tell everybody what happened so they took him back and they warned him again what about somebody getting healed and yet because it's none of your group it's none of your little clique your little thing I don't know where the helper well I like what the Bible said the man was dying he was over 40 in other words they'd been there for 40 years setting out to her nearly and nobody could argue the point but yet they wanted to argue the point you know they want to argue with them about this so just think about it now and as it did when it come to the point and they begin to be questioned that's when Peter and then picked up and what we read all right and they said all right now you want to know how this happened did we tell you the one you crucified that he now has given to the church this power this thing's come on in let's see did you see our visitors with us you know sitting and doing that in the name of Jesus Christ said we tell you this is what happened the Lord done these things and what about a group of people that's always amazed me no matter whether it would be after I come into messages we call it or back when we was in the Baptist's always wondered what people could hate somebody for healing the sick raising the dead casting out Devils and they couldn't argue about it I'm talking about in the ministry of Jesus Christ right then when that minister of Jesus Christ came over into the church and they were doing the same things the same people were ridiculing them and telling them not to preach no more I can tell nobody about these healings and I remember the one man that was blind and lord jesus healed you no no they got onto it and he even is family just about backed away from him you know the mom and daddy come they're afraid to say anything because they did that's going to get onto them and throw them out of the church for healing now when I'm talking about not talking about salvation you're talking about natural healings and miracles that took place that cannot be questioned by anyone because the people dier could you fit in that category could we fit in that category it's because it doesn't come to our little group our ranks or our dollars you know could it be that we would turn against the real truth oh no well you know what if you to ask them that they just said that to read to have our visitors with us and we always say to you here when you come one time your visitor and we say welcome to you come two times you're part of us because we don't have anything here to join anything we just part of the body of Christ so we say to you welcome just you know I mean my point is if it happened again you know what would be the things that we would say and do you had the man that was healed you lamed are he was healed he was up running all over the place and everybody knew it and then you take the people in and ask them how that happened not the one who learn right not to learn how it happened but to try to set you up will they be something with it just because you don't believe the way that people believe does that give you a right to even turn down the things God does well I just don't believe that really helping you know I don't know well let's see you do it that's what the disciples to say back to when did even the man we tell them I want to go there minute ago that his mom and daddy wouldn't say but he told him he said now you come on and tell me that he's ever been recorded that a man was blind he can see and said then this breaking it down in plain language today and saying now let's see where you done it but yet they didn't believe it why why would you think that way what would be in the human mind to turn down what could not be questioned but yet you don't agree with it could we be in the same category or go see according to the scriptures that we read when they come to the questioning the disciples gave their answer they replied back and they said we want you to know this man is whole because you crucified the very lord of glory and yet he turned as I said a minute ago he turned to the church and gave the church the power to heal the sick cast out Devils said in other words Peter would be saying it watch the problem why are you so upset let's see you do it well that didn't stop anything did it but I liked where the disciples did it to they put it to the point you know saying it can't be questioned the man standing here and you can't question that happening we said we're not telling you just a story we're not just making up something saying well we're standing here and we can't prove it to you they went back in the scriptures what about taking it back into the scriptures to the scribes and the Pharisees will say it - that way - where you'll follow - were because that's the learned that was the high priest was are you reading in the 3rd chapter you'll find the priest was there you'll find all of them was dire all their kinfolks as has the high priest and things was dire it wasn't something done in the corner that nobody didn't know about it it brought the attention of all of those people to come to them and when they were asked about it Peter said ok here he stands you can't argue but he said don't you remember the scriptures and surely it hurt their little feelings when he said this one that's healed this man said you crucified Him and as I was always a Citroen it's always been in my mind to think of what wrong did Jesus do that a ver ever gave man the right to do any of the things he done one thing any one act of the life of Jesus Christ where would it justify for you to kill him all he died was done good healed a sec said two people got him off a well fire and all of that why would you want to kill somebody but seeing like I said now not even the fact that they could prove this had happened that's a great thing Jordan think about but the fact that Peter would turn in and turn it to the word and say this man you crucified said by his name this man stands hold before you and said this was folk oven the word this was spoken you reason to turn these scriptures this was poke up in the word this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which is become the head of the corner you wouldn't something nut are you following me when you can lay down the healing you can lay down the miracles you can lay down the things that happened that man could not question and yet people would turn against it one what would make mankind to be that way it would turn against the very things that could be proved not to be able to question it but then Peter turning back to them and said the scripture said you would do this the scripture is verified if you would do this like this and said why don't you believe it you know that Jesus in his ministry spoke of these things just in his ministry let alone the reading we'll get to that to Psalms in a minute to read worse there in the scripture but I want to approach it this way see the Lord Jesus when he was here what did he have to say about these people and their ways go ahead and pull up number 1 we go to Matthew 21 let's just read some scriptures but I like for things to be in Word it's great to have all kind of physical proof but what about going to the word with it then it can't be questioned at all in the mouth of two or three witnesses let everything be established Matthew 21 42 44 jesus saith unto them did you never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected and then with the builders them and where Jesus said this is already spoke of in the word that you're doing what the word says you're going to do you realize that's what they were exactly doing they were fulfilling the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing I like this part here because it listed in each gospel Matthew listen listen Matthew Mark and Luke and each one of them says because it's picking it up for the Old Testament and it is marvelous in our eyes therefore I say unto you and because of what you're doing because of you rejecting me as the Messiah is that what he's saying so I'm showing you this in the scripture if you do it and said look at you so what's going to happen to you because that you've rejected the head of the corner the stone therefore I say unto you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you who's he talking to the Jews and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof them that would be given to the Gentile you read all the scripture and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken we don't whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder what about standing and telling the greatest religious leaders that had ever been did you're rejecting me as your Messiah you declare that he is to come by the scriptures and show me word of the word fire phrase in Scripture Jesus was saying to him show me work I haven't fulfilled the Scriptures they had not one thing that could bring against him was it Herod he's I find nothing Paulo I find nothing against this man that was a heathen that didn't give a hoot about cutting a man's throat is we we said in plain language only interested in would stopping an insurrection we said how to find nothing in history but what about telling those people so now because you've done this and rejected me the kingdom is going to be taken from you and given to a people you go over the other writings that said even go to a nation that was not even the nation when we're going to be giving to the Gentiles you know what to get your feelings hurt so bad until they're ready to kill the man that is said that right can we do that because it doesn't agree with every little thing that we thinks about look at mark basically the same type of scriptures but just look at it mark 12 caught it want you to think of these scriptures why shield are for the lord of the vineyard same situation he's talking about what's happening and he's come to Union Gundy same and what shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do you'll come and destroy the husbandmen and give the vineyard unto others and have you not read this scripture the stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing this marvelous and I'm not being able as I keep pointing out to bring any accusation against him he said well know what about you well you bring one accusation detective use they never said a thing when Jesus planted a rope together made it wheel and drove out of the temple there's no record they ever tried to bring that charge against him because they knew they were wrong they were in start doing the wrong things with the selling of the animals when all right if they'd have brought him outside done him away out all kind of that was legal they never said a word looks like that would be one thing that you could bring against him well you got mad and you beat him out they knew then what he was doing right are you following me they had not one thing to be able to bring against him well why would you turn him down go ahead number three Luke 20 verifies - he shall come and destroy these husbandmen and he'll give the vineyard to others and when they heard it they said god forbid and he beheld them and said what is this then that is written that can't be done that you can't take it away from us in Jesus is what is this that's really make sure Lee knew what was written right I said he beheld them and said what is this then that is written the stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the corner my point is could it happen again in you and I because it never came our way because it never came from our group if Jesus would have come as a Pharisee and acted like a fire seasoned unlike the Pharisees would have accepted it right if he become a coming to Sadducees should've been in that way they would have accepted him but when he came not belonging to anything remember he didn't blow anything he was every time he was either Almighty God or the whole religious world is in a chaos because of whether it's the truth or not all right forgive me no shyness who gets leading yes we throat I hate to do this but it's either that or quit so you put up with not liking me doing that that's all but think about it now the Lord Jesus referring to the scriptures right and telling them what the scriptures had to say about now let's read that scripture that go ahead to number 5 let's read the scripture that he's referring to and read the scripture that Peter was referring to let's go back in the Old Testament let's pick up these things remember now the first he's supposed to know description look what he says in Isaiah 28:16 therefore thus saith the Lord God behold I lay in Zion for a foundation or stone a tried stone a precious cornerstone a sure foundation he that believeth shall not make way make haste he's referring back okay let's go one more let's go to Psalms this is the scripture the Lord Jesus was referring back to let's go into Sean's now I'm going to find it anyhow you got it wrong eight one eighteen I will praise thee for thou has heard me and art become my salvation the stone which the builders refused is become the headstone of the corner ours again this is the Lord's doing it's marvelous in our eyes the stone which the builders with use see in other words the Lord Jesus wasn't this is what I'm saying about Peter it wasn't just the fact of saying the Lord Jesus didn't just come out and say well look what's happened let's see you do it he could have easily said that to him right he did in cases where he said who do you cast him out by what I mean he could have just ever service said look you get up and do this no he was good but he wanted to see the scripture spoke of this coming stone and that he'd be the chief Cornerstone when it was finished well what about turning that down what about turning him down he said what are you getting - I'm getting - one thing is there any way you could question the fact of whether or not God is real well I ain't never seen him glory your smaller thank you that's about as dumb as excuses you could get just say you ain't never seen it I thought thought we was to believe to see not see to believe run all right we see what would be your excuse today by not accepting God's Word what would be your arguments are your thoughts well you don't belong to our group what does it matter that's why we don't belong to any group sure well the following yes we follow we do but we don't belong to any organization or anything why not arguing with nobody about anything it's just her business I just chose to be that way okay all right now watch then knowing that the Lord Jesus Christ was in prophecy all the way through the Old Testament to come into being right trying to run down to where we are and that in all of that he was the fulfillment of all the scriptures and he could say even show me where I've sinned and they couldn't bring a case against him of sin oh yeah they had rumors but they wouldn't stand before him they had rumors running around yell he's illegitimate child he's just that or the other but they were smart enough not to bring those things out I like it that way I'm a human being I'm not people say oh you're too smart you're too intelligent you know intelligence is good if you use it correctly right I three not like to read about the Apostle Paul I like to follow his readings you know why he's smart you remember the time though they was going to kill him or whatever beat him up he just turned around he said now I'm over here you group I believe this with you here in the resurrection and I'm over here with this group and I believe this over here and he got into fighting with try to read the book of Acts and he just walks out I think anybody ought to be smart not the wisdom of man but the wisdom of God was if I will say wise as a serpent harmless of the death we said what are you getting at I'm getting to the point of why in the world mankind will not believe even though the proofs the thing unquestionable signs but why won't we believe it and then put our car with us into that point and say well who is this then who is this stone that was promised to come who is this branch as the Bible says to come out of the son of David who is this fulfillment of all the scriptures that he's Jesus Christ the chief Cornerstone he's the stone that was promised to come do we still believe that he promised today to come and do what he's doing go ahead go to number six go to Ephesians 2 coming down to you 9 and therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow-citizens with the Saints and of the household of faith now that should be the people I'm talking to today shouldn't be any problem because you should be not strangers or strange language or wordings we're using to talk about plain old simple language God promised in his word then he would send the Messiah he would come and what would happen to him and he'd be the stone that the builders would reject and when they got here they done exactly what he said they'd do it rejected but think about it we're not out to some word that we don't know the truth we should know the truth I thought it was full set us free so look now they're far you know more strangers and foreigners but fellow-citizens with the Saints and of the household of God okay and I've built what upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets and what is that foundation of the apostles and prophets what were they bringing Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone the one that was disallowed the one that was rejected but why would you reject him remember this is speaking to the Ephesians telling them who they are look what he says to the Romans this apostle paul romans 9 and as isaiah said before except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed we had been and sivanna shot him and made like under Kamara what shall we say then the two gentile us remember what we're saying want to go Jesus said what's going to happen because of these is turning down this stone he said you're going to be cut off is that what we were doing want to go you're going to be rejected and the Gentiles is going to be brought in now that Gentile was a dog to the Jews right so that's a bad thing for them to be doing but look what he said what shall we say then that the Gentiles which followed not after in other words live like the devil wheel carrying clubs on the back with nothing we were you know it wasn't something with great religious people we just Gentiles we were just either ah is that what he's saying that followed not after in his word it wasn't concerned but look what they've done they've attained to righteousness how come or how even the righteousness which is a faith revelation now we're getting to the point of seeing that those use when Jesus were talking about the stone they begin to understand when he said the King I'm going to be taken from you and given to another because of what you do they begin to understand and they got upset Paul carries this over to the Romans which is in the New Testament and he's speaking to the Jews trying to get them because he was a Jew right Paul he said I always I did we have cast away from my people he was trying his best to get them to see the truth not at what he didn't wasn't necessarily in the book of Romans trying to get them to see what the Jews done to Jesus what he was trying to get them to see what they were doing right these Romans knew what the Jews had done they crucified Jesus Christ so he wasn't trying to get them to see that he's trying to get them to see what they were doing how the Gentiles which were total outcasts no promises right few little types and shatters throughout the Old Testament the Gentiles that accepted Jesus Christ and become the people of God but now he's talking to them he's talking to Christians you have a Christian can't turn down God be careful be careful with that statement yeah but I've got the Bible God won't let me peel off but not B but you might have to take you out seen to get rid of you right is that also in the word so now we're trying to get down to where we're at right so we stop in with the Romans to see what Paul is saying to them see then we get down to where we're at okay listen and Isaiah which is really Isaiah you know the word extent you coming down what shall we say then that the Gentiles which followed not after righteousness no lineages no nothing to get us here have obtained of the righteousness even the righteousness which is of faith Abraham called the father of faith right because it was Abraham's believing faith believing I want but Israel did God give our Israel's of law you give it to them it regardless what you want to argue about what happened in between this end here Israel received the law right the Oracles came to Israel the law the Word of God came to okay look but Israel which followed after the law of righteousness there was not a thing that they could save Paul said a hebrew of the hebrew of this that everybody's on he said blameless considering the law the high priest if i could bring one mark against the high priest and kill him right he kept the law that close you realize that who jesus was talking to those that were not guilty of breaking any laws did he condemn them for breaking the laws or did he condemn them for what we're reading right here but Israel which followed after the law righteousness hath not obtained to the law Roger Israel kept the law to the letter is that what Paul's saying why didn't God save them he gave them the law they kept the law why the were there not Rochester righteousness means to be right or the factor act to being right it's not a great big word that you put out it's really just a state or fact of being rocked that's the best definition of righteousness because you can try to figure out I didn't do this and I didn't do that I did do this and God's righteous they got to do with it it's the factor state of being right so now look but Israel which followed after the law of righteousness had not obtained into the law Roger wherefore wherefore is a word that can be called why word for word are for just for in other words just said why why is it that Israel followed after the law of righteousness but never attained to that why why did they not get it the answer is it because they sought it not by faith but is it were by the work to the law doing and not doing what the law says right what do they wind up doing but as it were by the works of the law they tried to keep the law to the letter for they stumbled at that stumbling-stone stumbled at the students tongue now how you going to stumble at the stumbling stone when you're doing exactly what God says for you to do and not do are you following me trying to get down to where we are now because we're not talking about keeping the law a born-again Christian is the only one that can keep the law you want to discuss that point a born-again Christian is only one that can keep the law that's why Paul said the things I thought was right I found to be no wrong he said then I got born again I found out what it was he said now I live by faith not by keeping the law he said well you don't believe in keeping the law under if you're a born-again Christian your underwear about it right now if you born-again Christian you're going to do what the law says right come on see they sought it not by faith but as it were by the works of the law where they stumbled at the stumbling stone now could we sit in our self-righteous little estate that's where second I live a good life I don't drink I don't smoke I don't chew I don't run around with women I don't do all the things I live a good life well praise God Alcoholics Anonymous would like to see you because you'd make them a good neighbor but where's that going to save you there's no salvation in whether you keep the law or not that's what Paul is explaining it's got to come by faith so that's where we're going to get it right for they stumbled at the stumbling stone now he's using naturally as really they stumbled after stumbling but he's really telling them you're right now stumbling at the stumbling stumble because you're not seeing it by faith you're trying to do it by some kind of words you're still trying to lean to some words as your salvation works is supposed to be an expression of salvation works is not salvation is the expression of an inward life to come outward right look now you're going to stumble at the stone the stone as it is written behold I lay in Zion or stumbling stone and rock of the sinners and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed then we're talking about believing he's not talking about keeping it actually talking to them that are trying to keep it it's wonderful to be a good neighbor but there's no salvation in it but you know what they've done away with hell you notice that because there's nobody going our anymore because everybody's got some little good thing and you go there and the preacher gets up and he says I know this brother has been a bad guy and he's honest but I saw him place he paved the parking lot in the church over there so I know he's in heaven to bless it oh brother am i right nobody's going to hell no more they just going to do away with he that's silly I call you leave so is it silly to think you got some kind of works which you can make yourself better if silly do you think that you done are getting new don't you want to slit right no oh you funny preacher you mean you telecom guys you don't want to let us know once you get born again we won't worry about living right right you know what I drink all the alcohol I want to I just won't call it cigarettes or I lie cheat and steal and curse now all I want to you know what because the thing that used to make me do it is gone see that's Christianity that's not works of the law that's salvation now listen go ahead let's get this one more go ahead to first Peter number eight we'll get this and just take a little bit up and go look what Peter says unto use R for which believe he's precious but to them which be disobedient we think of disobedience as being somebody mean arrogant and hateful and always doing wrong then Pharisee stood right before the Lord Jesus and he never condemned them whatsoever because he knew they were living the law to the letter show me where he ever said a word Dukakis or any of them about something wrong they were doing they were good people look what he says here don't you use our for which believe he's precious but it was then which be disobedient and watch this scripture the stone which the builders just allowed the same is laid ahead of the corner now how can it be made ahead of the corner and what you're saying but under you which be disobedient as he the head of the disobedient Regis picture remember he's the head of a whole thing he doesn't matter whether it be a sinner or saint he's the head and we big disobedient claim to be married to him he's still the head because he created you he brought you into being and we're disobedient look what he says the same as made the head of the corner and the stone of stumbling I like on that tour that you you know the Bible talks about trying to find the stone have you ever thought about it this way you know you got a football field what is it 100 yards long and 50 wide or whatever it is something like that I think it's 100 anyway long and you're looking for a rock and there's one rock laying in the middle of the football field and you stumble over it trying to find it now that's about as dumb as you can get right even a blind man wouldn't work that way goes at least blind man be down on the ground hunting park crawling around trying to feel Park right are you following me you stumble it the truth it's a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense to who even to them which stumble what at the word now your righteousness sometimes is coming back from a book of rules to fit into a revelation of Jesus Christ you're not a Christian because you don't do things or do you ride you're a Christian if you're born again see they stumble that the word being disobedient were unto also they were appointed now those Pharisees back it on forward around stumbling at the word dire stood the word before them performing all the words said he would do yes they stumbled over that what was their stumbling now quote the prophet this way I think Leslie birkland he said it was hard to get those Pharisees to realize they were sinners where he could die for their sins right was Jesus trying to get the fire season all the little better and what's better couldn't get they were not breaking the law they were living the law that was what they thought their salvation was and that was right until Jesus came and when he came he came to fulfill the stumbling stone the one they'd stumble over what's the greatest stumbling you could think about the children of Israel doing he said well they killed it that's good I mean that's top-notch that's good but you know what to me is the greatest stumbling that we could ever do anyone could ever do was to it refused to accept Jesus Christ as their Savior do you see where I'm going not to what you think I'm going to stumbling in a crucifixion sure that's great that's in there they crucified Him they done hello son but you know what he died for cos just as much as he did Peter he died for Judas as much as he died for John Judis where he messed up was what come on I'm not one of these trying to make this new modern version of Judas no I'm just plain and honest with the scripture Judas just done what a human mortal would do Peter denied the Lord Jesus and cursed after denying in three times who was the worst sinner to stand there is that the Bible was Judas any worse than anybody else no his only problem was what he didn't make it to upper room yeah but I don't believe that because I believe he was a son of perdition that could not be saved you also believe that came couldn't be saved in the garden because of his situation but in the Bible there says to Cain if you'd have done once your brother Abel done you would have been accepted read your Bible it says you wouldn't do it what it was he say to Judas Judas even though you fulfilled all this wording about computers would have made it to the upper room so what was those Pharisees doing stumbling at the word because the word had said you're going to crucify Messiah you're going to reject him you're going to crucify but their greatest condemnation was not now listen I know I'm a strange preacher but listen to the wording the fact of them crucifying Jesus Christ is not the worst of all sin for you to be a murderer or monger or adultery strokes is there any difference in one little sin and a whole lot of sin I thought the Bible said it was a little foxes it's for the vine mine's it to loot foxes because you won't get rid of little foxes because you think it ain't big enough hurt nothing right what are you saying I'm saying that could we today reject the Lord Jesus Christ claiming to believe him the Romans were claiming to believe in theater was pretty adamant about their situation I mean Paul would there's asking a simple question can we stumble at the stumbling stone could we reject the Lord Jesus Christ yet in every way do everything that he says do or not do Persis did they kept the law to the letter you know what Jesus never come to do away with the law Bible says and you say Oh Nate didn't know again you come to magnify the rigs you Bible he come to magnify the law and make it honorable the law said thou shalt not commit adultery what did Jesus say look on a woman with lust in your heart you committed her daughter already he magnified it what are you trying to get true could we be stumbling at the word and rejecting it because that we just don't believe it that away her brother so-and-so didn't say it her you know what about it could we be stumbling into stumbling-stone the stumbling stone we'll get back to later to the Lord Jesus Christ as the stumbling stone come we know that because we know who is is your chief Cornerstone that was the point but what about it see we need to teach our children to be good and do good we need to talk of those things that's wonderful because that is part of the Word of God but teach them that it's not salvation just because they're doing good and not doing bad don't tell them they're going to heaven because of what they have done or hadn't done you know your stumbling at the word he said you've never heard anybody say that Judas Iscariot could have been safe why couldn't he if he had done rock oh you just don't believe in predestination I sure don't believe it's your way hungry but what about it could we be stumbling it the word that we've heard in this life days should President Li you talking about lean yes okay solve the problem how about you you know one comes on Matt Lee you don't wanna come come about everybody the rejected stone here we're going to go on through and go into even to the headstone and the stomach and surely if you'd realize it we stumble at something strong we're surely going to stumble at the headstone now I'm going to see what that is because you're going stumble we got to get it right what their corners tell me is you say well the corners telling the hits on the same stone I'll agree with you to a degree but it's a different position and there's also a whole lot more of it when you come to headstone it's not just come up to the one find it know what you see my main point of understanding today is one time have we rejected Jesus Christ because we have some reason or some thought in our mind some something that we could do or not do that would bring us to salvation you ain't go down and go to hell for what you doing don't do get that out of your mind you're gonna die and go to hell because what the Bible says he that believeth not is condemned already well I believe that through Jesus now that's not what it's talking about that's what I was getting to because see what is the new birth it's revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not because it was revealed to brother Branham not because it revealed anybody else because is revealed to you as the salvation thank God for the way it comes but it's not real until it's accepted as to you into our hearts in our lives who's your stumbling afterward that new birth is the greatest thing could ever happen to an individual does it puts the one inside of you that can lil the lung I didn't say it puts it in there and you will never do wrong I'm not done it just puts the one inside of you to lead you makes you a child of God that's what Israel turned down now listen if it's right what Jesus said the kingdom be taken from you and give it to another what was the kingdom sons and daughters of the Living God right come on was that the children of Israel the children of God royal priesthood all that put it to Israel there was others right the Oracles the word come to them all the things come to Israel even the adoption pertain to Israel all the things retains the Israel but they sought it not by faith the by but it was by the works of the law because they thought what they'd done or didn't do with what God was talking about and Jesus never one time said accomplished I want to tell you where you went wrong it doesn't because there was no wrong in his life that could be brought up what about you not come on musician what about you and I today and we accepted Jesus Christ as our Savior well yes I've accepted him as I say okay now question number two as he accepted you as he accepted you remember is not you accepting him that's wonderful you got to do that we got things to do we got to follow the line right but has he accepted us well I've done all I can do and if he ain't accepted me it's his fault now you better to be careful you're getting on dangerous territory I just want to make sure one thing if he's accepted me I don't have to worry about it he's accepted you then he'll prove it to you it may be a while before he does it somewhere he'll come to you and confirm it see then you know for yourself not for somebody else I told you the story where we was poor of us that was baptized years ago in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and just one brother come out and told us said I believe all four you receive the Holy Ghost three of them accepted what the brother said I was our are you living I talked with him they said that brother said I saved and I believe I'm sorry I said that brother said I'm saved and I ain't saved yet you've heard the story about everybody to group you know ask them said to the Lord save you make up this one little boy said Lord anything he's they've done nothing yet well at least he was honest right this is the way I was I wouldn't go take it on that man's word which was a good man who took his word on which that didn't mean I saw heaped I ordered my own experience he said don't you think that you had a good affair I would an ordained deacon at 23 years old so you know they thought a lot of it I accepted Jesus Christ when I was 18 years old when I was 29 when he accepted me he said what I just don't understand you I don't understand how that he's booked he accepted two disciples in the upper room and he brought to Holy Ghost 120 why didn't he bring it to the rest of the world but he didn't accept him he went outside in one sermon which priest and 3,000 souls was accepted of God and he gave them the baptism in the Holy Ghost it's not whether you accept him or not it's whether he accepts you if he accepts you you let you know so you realize then I'm not searching it by works or do I'm walking by faith where we go let's take what about it could we reject the very stone that we claim to read how about it you know Jesus is your Savior if not then you you're the one with a problem don't wait too long okay but don't ever think now here I know because they both I tried to explain it I accepted Jesus Christ not 18 years old I was 29 years old when I received the baptism of the holy go two years I recovered in this message I don't put it on the fact that I accepted dementia I know better than that I want an experience that would not be questioned not just guy executive because of this I wanted something for him to accept me [Music] for two years in this message I prayed the study fasted run all over the country everybody to pray for me one day I realised that wasn't what it was one day I realized that it was the word [Music] so I just took his word and let it right back before leave your word you said if I do this you're do this I've done all I can do Lord that's up to you then he came on the scene because it was a problem it is no question about it I was like how about it you have that Iker don't matter what if I say is it's not gonna stop you can be dumb and everything else and so understand why I'm covering up they did it's knowing where you're staying as Jesus Christ been my personal to you Mac will follow have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe the daily was 18 years old 25 23 years old and ordained a deacon at that time everybody else thought I had it one day I saw I didn't have what the word said but I took it by revelation that the word speak to my heart yeah but I've done this I've done that you do every bit of that I'll be saved yesterday evening just letting that father we thank you for this day and we ask you to just help us I know it's what we've tried to approach to do because we know we're going on into something else for this one order trying to get us all to a point to where we can think about ourselves and not to think about others and what they are and be concerned about that but to be concerned about our own sales to examine ourselves as we try to do in the word to see whether or not we are the children of God just bless us now as we go and eat a natural meal rang us back together the scene into your weight as he ministered unto its Lord just bless each one we love you and we thank you in Jesus name you dismiss when they drove when nails in my savior's and Zen is B I didn't hear him cry when the peers decide my god is ow
