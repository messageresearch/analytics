[5:03] you know we'll read these scripture John
[5:06] 17 verse one these words spake Jesus and
[5:10] lifted up his eyes to heaven and said
[5:12] father the hour has come glorify thy son
[5:15] that thy son Also may glorify thee as
[5:18] thou Hast given him Power Over All Flesh
[5:21] that he should give eternal life to as
[5:23] many as thou Hast given
[5:25] him and this is eternal life what that
[5:29] they might Know Thee the only true God
[5:33] and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent amen
[5:36] I have glorified thee on the earth I
[5:38] have finished the work which thou gavest
[5:39] me to do and now oh Father glorify thou
[5:43] me with thine own self with the glory
[5:46] which I had with thee before the
[5:48] foundation of before the were was I have
[5:52] manifested thy name unto the men which
[5:55] thou gavest un gavest me out of the
[5:58] world and watch coming down to the
[6:00] church now the the called out the
[6:02] disciples and
[6:06] things I have manifested thy name unto
[6:08] the men which thou gavest me out of the
[6:11] world thine they were and thou gavest
[6:15] them me and they have kept Thy word and
[6:19] now they have known that all things
[6:21] whatsoever thou Hast given me are of
[6:24] thee for I have given unto them The
[6:27] Words which thou gavest me
[6:30] and they have received them and have
[6:33] known surely that I came out from thee
[6:36] and they have believed that thou did
[6:38] send me now read these yourself and keep
[6:41] in mind what he's saying to the
[6:43] disciples he gave them the word God gave
[6:46] them to him it's not two people there
[6:49] but it's coming out see and and showing
[6:52] where they're at watch and I pray for
[6:54] them I pray for not for the
[6:58] world right but for them which thou
[7:01] gavest me for they are thine and all
[7:04] mine are thine and all thine are mine
[7:07] and I am glorified in them now and now I
[7:11] am I am no more in the world watch now
[7:15] see he's fixing to leave going out all
[7:17] right but these are in the world and I
[7:20] come to thee Heavenly Father keep thy
[7:23] thine keep through thine own name Those
[7:27] whom thou Hast given me that they may be
[7:30] one as we are now how was he and the
[7:33] father one the father come and dwell in
[7:36] him right so how is it with us while I
[7:39] was with them in the world now once I
[7:42] kept them in thy name those that thou
[7:44] gavest me I have kept and none of them
[7:47] is lost but the son of predition that
[7:50] the scripture might be fulfilled and see
[7:52] he kept Judas up to the
[7:54] last right he kept him up to the last
[7:58] but then he went away all
[8:00] right and now come I to thee and these
[8:04] things I speak in the world that they
[8:07] might have my joy fulfilled in
[8:11] themselves I have given them Thy word
[8:15] and what what he does with the word now
[8:17] and the world hated them because they
[8:20] are not of the world even as I am not of
[8:23] the the world I pray not that thou
[8:26] should us take them out of the world
[8:29] much
[8:30] you know look like he said well get us
[8:31] out of here you know no he doesn't do
[8:34] that but that thou should us keep them
[8:38] from the
[8:40] evil they are not of the world even as I
[8:44] am not of the world watch him now
[8:46] sanctify them through thy truth Thy word
[8:49] is truth and as thou has sent me into
[8:52] this world even so I also send them into
[8:57] the world how did he do it he come and
[8:58] dwelt in them and went right that's what
[9:00] he's doing
[9:01] now and for their sakes watch I sanctify
[9:05] myself that they they also might be
[9:09] Sanctified through the truth and you can
[9:11] go on down and pick up more but we'll
[9:13] stop there because we we get enough
[9:15] scripture you may be
[9:17] seated
[9:19] and now
[9:22] we took
[9:24] Sunday both Services
[9:27] expressing you know
[9:30] is talking about coming to this new
[9:34] birth that we believe that if you're
[9:37] born you know you have to be born again
[9:39] to be in the Kingdom you can't see you
[9:41] can't enter the kingdom and things you
[9:43] have to do those things all right and
[9:45] then we're coming down to a point of
[9:47] talking and we did Sunday and we titled
[9:50] the first part of it you know about the
[9:53] the
[9:54] justification and then we got up into
[9:56] the point of talking about in the
[9:58] afternoon of the stage of
[10:01] justification all right now what did the
[10:04] prophet say there's three
[10:06] stages right amen justification
[10:09] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[10:11] Ghost you don't shortcut it you can't
[10:14] just jump in real quick and say well I
[10:16] didn't need them others I was live so
[10:18] good until I didn't need to be cleans
[10:21] and you know forgiven I was just oh
[10:23] great Glory I wish I could say that and
[10:25] I I wish you could but I know you can't
[10:28] so that solves a problem but not to be
[10:31] hateful to be just plain and Truth All
[10:33] right but we went through talking about
[10:37] justification and we went into the
[10:39] future home and talking about these
[10:42] things that the prophet has brought unto
[10:45] us and we believe that what we talked
[10:49] about it Sunday from the message Christ
[10:51] as a Myster God reveal that God could be
[10:55] revealed now what is it what is the new
[10:58] birth Pro the prophet it said Christ a
[11:00] mystery it's revelation of Jesus Christ
[11:02] personally to you then we were dealing
[11:04] with it Sunday God is known by
[11:06] Simplicity and revelation of Jesus
[11:07] Christ to the most illiterate person
[11:10] that's right all right so now that means
[11:13] the most illiterate person can be saved
[11:16] thank you Lord all right see we think
[11:17] they don't have enough mental capacity
[11:20] but it shows to me that you don't have
[11:22] to have this great head knowledge but
[11:25] you have to believe
[11:29] what you've heard amen you know you have
[11:32] to believe it all right but then it's
[11:36] it's not taught by most everybody of the
[11:38] new birth and that we need it and that's
[11:40] why brother Ram we got on to it on birth
[11:42] pains where he says there's not very
[11:45] many genuine new births that's right
[11:48] amen
[11:49] why because they just sympathize with it
[11:53] yeah yeah I like that that's a good idea
[11:56] they want to stay with the old system
[11:59] you know their old church allies their
[12:01] old thoughts their old ways you know
[12:04] they want to stay with that and claim
[12:06] the new birth are the message of the age
[12:11] all right see then coming on over into
[12:13] especially into our day in time of the
[12:16] message of the age that we're living in
[12:19] and they want to hold to that old system
[12:22] their old ideas and you see them in the
[12:24] message that that people would even say
[12:27] you know well boy I'm glad that was
[12:29] brought out because you know I always
[12:30] kind of believe something like that you
[12:33] know well that's that's all right if
[12:34] it's truth but to believe something that
[12:36] it's not truth in trouble right then we
[12:40] went on talking about that very few
[12:42] would believe
[12:44] unto receiving the Holy Spirit right so
[12:49] very
[12:50] few genuine new
[12:52] births very few will receive the Holy
[12:55] Spirit the way that it's supposed to be
[12:58] all right and doing that he went in and
[13:00] we talked about
[13:02] justification as by faith in the word of
[13:05] God all right now I don't want to leave
[13:07] that because I want us to stay with the
[13:10] point so what we'll do is we'll just
[13:13] pick up from where we left off Sunday
[13:16] and we'll we'll read some of the things
[13:19] that we read there because it will be
[13:22] not only in the stage of justification
[13:26] it goes right on into sanctification so
[13:28] that's where where we're going on into
[13:30] it now on the doing so if the brothers
[13:32] will start we'll pick up and we'll start
[13:35] on the future home and we'll reread some
[13:38] of the things that we talked about
[13:40] because we're a firm believer and that
[13:42] was on the message uh Church order
[13:45] preached in 1958 he explains we believe
[13:48] in justification by faith we believe in
[13:50] sanctification by the blood we believe
[13:52] in the baptism with the holy spirit so
[13:54] that was 58 all right then when he comes
[13:57] up here to to speaking on the future
[14:00] home in
[14:01] 1964 he said he want to make it plain he
[14:05] said it was a great confirmation a great
[14:07] loving blessing when I see this and see
[14:09] that since a
[14:12] boy first time ever dealt Christ dealt
[14:15] with me I've always taught those three
[14:18] stages of Grace they always
[14:22] taught the three stages of Grace well
[14:25] then why would it come into the people
[14:27] of the message now say well he changed
[14:28] this and he changed that you know well
[14:32] that's that's nothing to me but it's
[14:34] just something that you know I don't
[14:36] want you to get caught with it so then I
[14:39] warn you to be aware of what you listen
[14:43] to as to the great beautiful
[14:46] explanations of things that seems to be
[14:50] right but will not work out all right so
[14:52] we'll drop back now and we'll just come
[14:54] up from where we were and then we'll go
[14:56] right on through Reading because it's a
[14:58] continuation
[14:59] of reading so you'll watch that from
[15:02] from the future home so we talking about
[15:04] it Sunday and what did he say the first
[15:06] step is repentance toward God Then
[15:08] followed that is water baptism water
[15:10] baptism repent be baptized in the name
[15:12] of Jesus Christ see water baptism
[15:14] follows showing that repentance was
[15:16] genuine are to remit our P sins that has
[15:20] nothing to do with future sins see it's
[15:24] justification just chops off the pie
[15:26] sins all right see we sin again
[15:29] you know say I come to alter and I'm ask
[15:31] the Lord to forgive me and he forgives
[15:33] me well that's gone into SE of
[15:35] forgetfulness is totally annihilated but
[15:38] the next time I sin what do I have to do
[15:40] that's right so what did we read off the
[15:43] one in church
[15:44] order 1958 what do we read what the pro
[15:47] he said you be justified he said but
[15:50] what he say maybe that person go on
[15:52] drinking
[15:53] smoking problems y well no no no brother
[15:57] Dale when I got Justified I quit
[16:00] everything you quit everything but
[16:04] lying is that blown enough because it's
[16:09] it's humanly
[16:12] impossible all right you say but I I
[16:15] know I experienced that I know what
[16:18] happened 5 minutes after I repented of
[16:21] my
[16:22] sins right I'm just honest see all right
[16:26] you say but yeah but look look I when I
[16:30] got went to the altar I quit everything
[16:33] well praise the Lord you're a wonderful
[16:36] person but now brother brownon says it
[16:39] don't matter what you got to be filled
[16:40] with something so now what was you
[16:42] filled with so we'll get to that but
[16:45] look that has nothing to do with your
[16:48] future sin it only remits repent and be
[16:50] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[16:52] what far remission taking away of the
[16:55] pie sins has nothing to do
[16:59] with the future just your sins has been
[17:02] chopped off what you did you can't
[17:04] repent for what Adam done you never done
[17:07] it Adam did it you just get forgiveness
[17:09] or what you done the old
[17:13] nature is still
[17:16] there all right now what did we use so
[17:19] go ahead and pull up to number one on
[17:21] the drawing Brothers we're going to try
[17:23] to juggle some books tonight if we can
[17:26] okay pull up the number one that shows
[17:28] all of the drawing
[17:29] that we'll get to it when it comes on
[17:31] down because we're going to read it in
[17:33] just a minute all right
[17:36] now here's the way brother Rand says
[17:40] things he said here's a human heart
[17:43] here's a human
[17:45] heart all right he said this one up here
[17:49] has got a snake in it it's got sin in it
[17:52] and and he said it's got a life he said
[17:54] this one down here has a dove but he
[17:57] says it has a life
[17:59] all right now but how do you get from
[18:02] here to
[18:04] here
[18:06] see because that's the stages is there
[18:10] and you you can think and say well
[18:12] brother d i don't agree with you but he
[18:13] said I here's a human heart here's a
[18:15] human heart why not make it the same
[18:17] human heart because regeneration is to
[18:20] take this man to be this man right yes
[18:25] irregardless of what you want to think
[18:27] about that you got to do this but it's
[18:29] stages of
[18:30] that it's not done just when more all at
[18:34] one it can be right I don't mind quoting
[18:37] scripture to you because it's the house
[18:38] of
[18:40] conus they said can anybody feid water
[18:44] see that these have received the Holy
[18:46] Ghost that we did at the beginning all
[18:48] right so it's possible but not very
[18:52] probable ever how you say that because
[18:55] the prophet said very few people will
[18:57] believe all the way amen but it's not
[19:00] saying you can't
[19:02] right I'm not trying to emphasize you
[19:04] can't and you didn't that's between you
[19:07] and God right there's no way that I can
[19:10] have anything to do with between you and
[19:12] your savior all right but see then watch
[19:15] what he
[19:16] says okay go ahead with number two now
[19:19] brothers and pull
[19:20] up drop that off we'll get back to it in
[19:23] just a minute because we just got
[19:26] through with the uh which would be
[19:29] paragraph
[19:30] 89 and of future home number two I hope
[19:34] these that Tak can read them out there
[19:36] cuz we we worked on it but all right now
[19:39] watch cuz this is a continuation we
[19:43] read first what we read the first step
[19:48] repentance toward God that's paragraph
[19:50] 87 and 88 all right explaining
[19:56] what that has nothing to do with your
[19:58] future it only remits Okay now what's he
[20:03] saying then he steps to the board and he
[20:05] says now let me illustrate he said
[20:07] here's a human heart and here's a human
[20:11] heart all right now this one over here
[20:13] has a snake in it that's sin here he has
[20:17] his life now watch that quote throughout
[20:22] theight and more Sunday and keep on
[20:25] about what is that he said here he has
[20:29] his
[20:31] life this one over here has a dove in it
[20:34] which is the holy spirit here he has a
[20:39] life right now what is he talking about
[20:42] here he has a
[20:45] life because I thought the drawing that
[20:48] he was making was a drawing of an
[20:50] individual or really the soul of an
[20:53] individual because he didn't draw the
[20:55] three rings to come through justif I
[20:57] mean come through something through the
[20:59] body and then through the spirit and
[21:01] then into the soul you know and the
[21:03] doing he goes straight to the message
[21:05] and draws a heart a soul of an
[21:09] individual all right and in that soul is
[21:12] where the new birth takes
[21:16] place it doesn't do any good to get rid
[21:19] of some of the body out here that's well
[21:21] and good it doesn't do any good for the
[21:23] spirit part to work because you're not
[21:26] born again in your body you're not born
[21:28] again in your Spirit you're born again
[21:29] in your soul the real you all right now
[21:34] so when doing it
[21:35] watch see he brings it to a
[21:38] point well this one here he has malice
[21:41] hatred Envy that's what causes it is
[21:45] this fella now remember that in a minute
[21:47] there's your
[21:49] snake
[21:50] right we'll get back to the draw in just
[21:53] a second with this one here he has
[21:55] malice hatred envy and what's causing it
[21:58] is this fell here well this one over
[22:01] here has love and joy and longsuffering
[22:04] and that's what does it down here all
[22:07] right now you're supposed to have kept
[22:09] your
[22:10] drawing so look at your
[22:14] drawing and you got the one up here with
[22:16] a snake in it you got little lines in
[22:19] there said sin then you got down at the
[22:22] bottom you got one with a dove in it all
[22:25] right now keep that in mind as you're
[22:28] going so watch what he
[22:30] says and when you ask you're forgiven of
[22:34] your sins you're only done this taken
[22:38] that away what did you take
[22:40] away
[22:42] sin right you only took your sin away
[22:46] right now we'll put the drawing back up
[22:49] in a minute what but the thing that made
[22:52] you do it is still
[22:55] there that's the old root of evil is
[22:58] still there notice then you repent and
[23:01] the baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[23:03] that he forgave you of your sins all
[23:05] right now while we're at it drop back to
[23:08] number two on your your uh Hearts
[23:12] brother I tried to label this one two
[23:14] three where it would come so you just
[23:16] look at your own and look at what you
[23:19] got all right now here's the one that
[23:22] we're dealing with we don't have to
[23:23] worry about the guy down here that's got
[23:25] the dove in it we'll get to him later
[23:28] but it's a long ways down there right
[23:30] all right so here what do you got
[23:33] sin and you got the snake this is what
[23:37] made you do
[23:39] it was the old root of evil we'll get to
[23:42] that in a minute now look what happens
[23:44] when you take the sin out what have you
[23:48] got you're still not right that's what
[23:50] he said that's right he said you can
[23:52] repent and everything he said but you're
[23:53] still not right he said because the
[23:55] thing that made you do it is still there
[23:59] that's right amen all right so what did
[24:01] you do when you
[24:03] repented the sin went out so what do you
[24:06] look like that right
[24:08] there the old root of evil don't go out
[24:11] when you repent that's what we're going
[24:13] to read from the prophet that's right
[24:15] all right so do you see what it's doing
[24:17] now we're going from this stage to this
[24:20] stage all right so now drop back to
[24:23] where we were what was you on you were
[24:25] on uh
[24:30] you're still on number two with the
[24:31] reading but the thing that made you do
[24:34] it see you're forgiven of your sins you
[24:37] only done this taken that away you took
[24:40] out the
[24:41] sin but where you
[24:45] left all right but the thing that made
[24:49] you do it is still there you see our
[24:51] thinking is that if we repent it gets
[24:52] rid of the
[24:53] devil
[24:56] uh-uh it gets rid of the sin
[24:58] right right amen of the individual right
[25:02] all right we're going to go into
[25:03] scriptures and things with it now watch
[25:05] see watch what he calls it the thing
[25:08] that made you do it is still there so
[25:10] what did we do in the second part of the
[25:13] drawing sin gone snake left the old root
[25:18] of evil all right that's the root of
[25:20] evil it's still there notice then you
[25:23] repent and baptized in the name of Jesus
[25:25] Christ for remission of your sins and
[25:27] notice now watch this then then secondly
[25:29] comes
[25:32] sanctification told you this is a
[25:34] continuation of reading which sets our
[25:37] mind in order for
[25:40] Holiness see watch what these things
[25:42] that happens at sanctification right
[25:46] amen record these things that happen at
[25:52] sanctification go sanctification which
[25:54] sets our mind in order for holiness
[25:58] now working up here
[26:01] yes right working up here yes starts
[26:05] working up here yes but where's it
[26:07] working
[26:08] at now the Bible said if the mind that
[26:11] was in Christ be in you to make a new
[26:12] creature now that's not his brain right
[26:15] so that mind is not the mind that we
[26:18] talk about the the part up here that's
[26:20] running the it's the mind that's inside
[26:22] of
[26:23] you right cuz that's where he's working
[26:26] at he's not working on your body he's
[26:28] not working on your spirit and the new
[26:29] birth it works back outward that's right
[26:33] it works from the
[26:35] inside of the Soul that's right right
[26:39] all right secondly which sets our mind
[26:42] in order for Holiness to think
[26:45] right now watch it and you'll see when
[26:48] we'll get back in a minute we'll try to
[26:50] cover some things in our lives that will
[26:53] make us think about where we
[26:55] were that's my goal is to to get us to
[26:57] think about our lives and where we came
[27:00] from all right so look set our mind in
[27:04] order for Holiness to think right taking
[27:06] away sanctification is a compound Greek
[27:08] word which means cleaned and set aside
[27:11] for
[27:12] service all right so we have to read
[27:14] these in it because it's dark we'll get
[27:16] to that later then the next comes the
[27:19] baptism of fire and holy ghost that God
[27:22] might dwell in us and the fire of God
[27:25] cleanses our hearts from sin and puts
[27:28] the Holy Ghost
[27:30] Inside all right now watch that and hold
[27:33] that when the Holy Ghost comes I would
[27:37] ask you to write this
[27:39] down when the Holy Ghost comes it's
[27:42] going to get rid of
[27:44] sin but but but brother the sin was gone
[27:47] up here
[27:48] already that is just what You' done back
[27:51] there this is going on right right and
[27:56] we're going to get to something maybe I
[27:57] hope
[27:58] tonight what's now and the fire of God
[28:02] cleanses our hearts from sin and put the
[28:04] Holy Ghost Inside then we bring forth
[28:07] the same life that this did because that
[28:11] that's in us all right they explains a
[28:14] natural birth come on up with notice in
[28:17] the natural birth when a woman gives
[28:19] birth to a baby the Natural Life tpes a
[28:21] spiritual life woman gives birth to a
[28:23] baby what comes for water blood and
[28:26] spirit life all right when a baby watch
[28:28] when a baby's born into the kingdom I
[28:30] can't help but cover the things he's
[28:33] saying cuz if I isolate him you'll say
[28:37] I'm changing something so I'm just
[28:39] reading it every
[28:40] B right you can say but you change that
[28:43] over here well now if he says it then
[28:47] you argue him where he changed all right
[28:50] now watch the baby is when a baby is
[28:53] born into the kingdom of God it comes
[28:56] the same way water blood Spirit the
[28:59] three stages justification
[29:00] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[29:02] Ghost now notice sanctification the
[29:05] third stage now you know he didn't mean
[29:07] it that way second stage of it cleanses
[29:10] the Mind sets the heart the mind of the
[29:13] heart in order of Holiness now was I
[29:15] right hoo it don't set the
[29:20] brain it don't set the brain that's what
[29:22] he said cleanses the mind not this up
[29:26] here brain not that
[29:29] that cleanses the
[29:31] Mind sets the
[29:34] heart now the heart if you draw that
[29:38] heart of an individual then you're going
[29:40] to have to draw another Circle outside
[29:42] and say Spirit five senses and then
[29:46] another outside and say body right he
[29:49] just didn't put them there all right but
[29:52] now watch cleanses the Mind sets the
[29:56] heart the mind of the heart heart in
[29:59] order of Holiness now watch him he drops
[30:01] back to justification a man can repent
[30:04] sin and he's still thinking well maybe
[30:06] he's an immoral man every immoral
[30:08] looking woman he finds it's still there
[30:11] maybe he's a drunkard every time he
[30:12] smells a drink it's still th se but when
[30:15] he gets
[30:17] Sanctified so now he's dropped back to
[30:19] justification but when he gets
[30:21] Sanctified that cleanses that desire out
[30:25] of him that's righten watch him it takes
[30:28] the want of it away now
[30:32] watch he can still be
[30:37] tempted but he takes the want of it away
[30:41] still he's not right yet he's only set
[30:45] aside for service all right now let's
[30:47] stop right there just a
[30:50] minute stop right there and think about
[30:55] it sanctification then what does it do
[30:59] it cleanses the desire out of us we
[31:02] repent of our
[31:03] sins and God chops them off that's
[31:07] justification all right then what comes
[31:10] next
[31:12] sanctification all right what about the
[31:14] sanctification what does it
[31:16] do cleanses the mind that heart that
[31:19] he's
[31:20] drawed cleanses
[31:23] it
[31:25] right now go ahead and pull up number
[31:27] number three brothers and let's look at
[31:30] it we got a lot of doing you think
[31:34] I'm go ahead and pull up number
[31:37] three I tried to give these in step one
[31:39] two three where they could pull them
[31:43] up here's what caused you to do it but
[31:46] when it goes
[31:48] out you're
[31:52] clean and when it goes out you're
[31:55] clean okay wonderful
[32:00] picture but it don't have the dove in
[32:03] it that's right doesn't have the dove no
[32:08] right now watch him see all you've done
[32:11] is cleaned up the soul right now as we
[32:15] get to
[32:17] it what happened to you when you
[32:20] repented of your
[32:22] sins you know may back young or old or
[32:25] whatever you do you ask God to forgive
[32:27] you
[32:28] he took out the sin amen but what caused
[32:31] you to do it is still left MH see
[32:34] because all it done is chopped off the
[32:36] past done nothing to the future is that
[32:38] what we're quoting then comes
[32:41] sanctification to drive that unclean
[32:44] Spirit out now we'll keep on going in
[32:45] just a minute on the other to drive that
[32:47] unclean Spirit out of
[32:49] you all
[32:52] right now what about when you get the
[32:54] unclean Spirit out of you
[32:59] okay you say well it's beautiful there
[33:01] cuz there's nothing there all
[33:04] right now there where our trouble for
[33:07] the next four hours is going to
[33:10] be we won't stay that long tonight we'll
[33:13] continue Sunday
[33:15] okay justification chops off your P
[33:19] sins
[33:21] sanctification starts dealing with
[33:24] listen starts dealing with your
[33:31] nature because there's your nature right
[33:35] amen right
[33:38] right you're the nature of your soul is
[33:41] God if you're born again if not that's
[33:43] on uh souls and prison if not it's of
[33:47] the
[33:48] world right so now what does God have to
[33:52] deal with to try to get this into this
[33:55] stage you know from the night to the
[34:00] Purity he dealing with your
[34:06] nature when you're born again you don't
[34:08] get a New
[34:09] Soul amen you know you know what I mean
[34:13] new another different Etc no I thought
[34:18] we believed in regeneration
[34:21] amen now if you got another Soul then
[34:24] you're throwing that way and you get
[34:26] another one
[34:28] that's not replacement you know I mean
[34:30] that's that's replacement that's not
[34:32] Resurrection amen we're supposed to be
[34:34] dealing with a new birth Amen to redeem
[34:37] the individual
[34:39] amen right and we're totally dealing
[34:42] with these services for the past two now
[34:46] and for two or three more we're totally
[34:48] dealing with the soul the
[34:51] heart that's the life that you are your
[34:56] being and what you are amen so sin
[35:00] chopped
[35:02] off now we're going to read the
[35:04] scripture in just a minute where Jesus
[35:05] says the unclean Spirit goeth out of a
[35:08] man but I want you to think about
[35:11] this what is the unclean
[35:16] Spirit right now watch my point that I
[35:21] tried to bring out the other day you
[35:24] remember this one
[35:27] when you look down at a baby and it's
[35:29] born in sin shaping in the world un
[35:31] shaping iniquity come the world speaking
[35:33] lies you look down that say look at that
[35:35] little Old
[35:36] Devil now that ain't no
[35:39] devil it ain't even age of
[35:42] accountability so it can't be even
[35:43] accounted of anything
[35:47] right see we think about the devil
[35:51] coming to live in us when I'm talking
[35:53] about that we are born in Satan's domain
[35:56] amen and we have to agree to that right
[35:59] his
[36:00] kingdom Jesus we read it I'm not of this
[36:04] world what is the world Satan's kingdom
[36:07] amen right right right his domain all
[36:11] right now when you go and do something
[36:14] wrong well that that's everybody said
[36:17] that's just the
[36:18] devil you got a
[36:22] point but what are you going to do with
[36:24] the person right amen
[36:28] but but brother Dale right there is a
[36:30] snake that's your
[36:32] nature that's the nature of this entire
[36:35] being that you are that's right because
[36:39] that's your
[36:40] soul in Bible terminology is called a
[36:44] heart right soul that's what you
[36:49] are we're not dealing now with body not
[36:52] dealing with the senses of the body
[36:54] dealing with senses of the spirit no no
[36:56] we're up above that now amen so don't
[36:59] drop back in your mind and say well this
[37:01] here that just stay with me and
[37:05] listen
[37:06] see when you repented of your sins all
[37:10] it done was chopped off the sins of that
[37:12] now
[37:13] listen was it the sins of the
[37:16] body that was chopped off oh yeah the
[37:19] body's what done it was it the sins of
[37:21] the spirit well yeah have to be the
[37:23] spirit one no now
[37:26] you you can't disbelieve with your
[37:29] body that's right right memory reason
[37:32] conscious and things is not dealing with
[37:36] disbelieving that's why brother random
[37:38] is so specific to if I could take the
[37:41] next three days two hours each day and
[37:44] talk about Sin right amen because here
[37:48] it is sin is unbelief amen right that's
[37:52] our definition that's R R's definition
[37:55] but what about when he said he sinned
[37:56] every day
[37:59] yep what about when he said you sin
[38:01] every day that's
[38:03] right is that
[38:08] unbelief or is it the spirit and the
[38:10] body
[38:11] activating and working and trying to
[38:16] control come on it's impossible for a
[38:19] born- again Christian to
[38:21] sin that's right so then the sinner he
[38:25] just sins all the way but a Christian a
[38:29] born again Christian can't sin in his
[38:31] soul how can
[38:34] he you can't do it so then you work back
[38:38] out into the spirit and you work out
[38:40] into the body and we do things wrong
[38:42] because we're part of a being but not
[38:46] within the
[38:47] soul
[38:50] right but even in that part of the Soul
[38:53] with that snake in
[38:55] it that's just a nature of what you are
[39:00] amen it's not
[39:02] you this is
[39:06] you it's just something has come to
[39:09] motivate
[39:11] you it's not a devil that comes and
[39:14] lives in you I want to get that out of
[39:16] your
[39:17] mind cuz see we you can't rule like
[39:21] that well I was just a devil then you
[39:23] turn around and say do something you say
[39:25] devil made me do it I don't blame the
[39:27] devil for everything I volunteer for 90%
[39:30] about of it and I know you do too so
[39:32] then that leaves it solves a problem but
[39:35] see we look as I said we look at a baby
[39:37] that's born into sin sh iniquity SP from
[39:39] Mother's it's born that way it's doomed
[39:43] and on its way to hell right but it's
[39:45] not a devil right there it's not a
[39:48] sinner right
[39:50] there because God will not account
[39:53] anything to it until the age of
[39:55] accountability right
[39:58] right amen that's right so then we just
[40:00] say oh that's the devil you say well
[40:02] this old snake here that is just that
[40:04] Old
[40:07] Devil it's the nature of the
[40:11] devil that has come into us in the being
[40:14] of our
[40:15] soul that is not to just say a devil in
[40:21] there it's our
[40:23] nature it's our
[40:26] ways all of our life we've lived as a
[40:29] nature of ways the way we are the reason
[40:31] you do the reason you know that that
[40:34] some people do this and some people do
[40:36] that and what is it natures and
[40:38] ways
[40:40] right and see that's not a
[40:45] devil because even if we take it in the
[40:47] stages of the Antichrist and the things
[40:50] what is it you remember the other day
[40:52] when I said it what dides he start off
[40:55] Antichrist
[40:58] false
[40:59] prophet and here's where people missing
[41:01] brother brandham they'll only they'll
[41:03] they'll watch him they'll go Antichrist
[41:05] false prophet Beast there no such
[41:10] thing it's Antichrist false prophet
[41:14] incarnate false prophet
[41:16] Beast the Incarnate even see the
[41:19] Antichrist is not we'll get to that
[41:23] where brother R calls it a religious
[41:24] part of you
[41:27] of the
[41:28] Antichrist see that
[41:31] Antichrist goes into a deeper
[41:33] state with the
[41:36] person right first they're an antichrist
[41:39] they're doing pretty good second they
[41:41] start being controlled by the devil in
[41:44] their thinking third they become to an
[41:46] incarnate stage that's not incarnate as
[41:48] the devil inside of
[41:50] you but there will be a
[41:53] time when that false prophet
[41:58] will become the Incarnate
[42:03] devil now
[42:07] listen he doesn't know how to become
[42:10] incarnate
[42:12] devil until God becomes incarnate in you
[42:17] so now does it mean that when God comes
[42:20] and becomes incarnate in me and you that
[42:22] that's
[42:23] God or is it
[42:25] you with God God ruling and
[42:29] controlling which one is it you see what
[42:32] I'm trying to get us away from the
[42:34] thinking well that's just a
[42:36] devil devil made them people do
[42:39] that well sure cuz he's a motivator
[42:42] right but he doesn't come down and live
[42:45] in people like we call it brother around
[42:48] let's see he said those fallen
[42:51] angels He said what he said they give
[42:55] you a nature right y now you need that
[42:59] quote I'll be glad to find it those
[43:01] Fallen Angels back there remember 2/3 of
[43:06] them now technically brother Bram will
[43:08] always use 2/3 but technically scripture
[43:11] it talks about 1/3 okay now I'm not
[43:14] saying he's wrong I'm just saying that
[43:18] we don't understand why he uses 2/3
[43:20] instead of a third because the Bible
[43:21] says a third of the Angels fail he said
[43:25] but those demons give us a a nature
[43:27] right that's right see that's where they
[43:30] start at in these children that's right
[43:31] you watch these children they're
[43:32] starting a nature being built in them
[43:35] right brother Ryan in order to know it
[43:37] more than any he's got four 1 2 3 four
[43:40] right together but he can look down and
[43:41] see a nature in each one of those kids
[43:44] that the other ones don't
[43:46] have that's not all together bad C it's
[43:50] all together good because it's got to be
[43:52] that
[43:53] way right we're not talking about how
[43:55] bad everything is
[43:58] see that's our point we want to make a
[44:00] devil I said we well that that's a devil
[44:03] in that child we'll send them down here
[44:05] to the to the reform what know what did
[44:07] they call it where you send them used to
[44:09] be a you know you sent them to a home
[44:12] you know and put them in a
[44:15] home uh what milleville used to be the
[44:18] The Nut House The Nut House you know
[44:20] they send you to a nut house cause you
[44:22] crazy and come find out a lot of them
[44:24] wasn't crazy at all they had mental
[44:26] defici IES because of the food that they
[44:28] were eating there was a lady down at
[44:30] Gillsville who used to live there I
[44:32] remember she was a school teacher and
[44:35] she just went haywire and started doing
[44:36] everything and they couldn't figure out
[44:38] what in the world was wrong with her she
[44:39] started doing bad things they come to
[44:42] find it out she had a deficiency in the
[44:45] food she was
[44:47] eating
[44:49] sure I mean you see somebody out there
[44:51] because of the food they're eating and
[44:53] they're acting this way and you see
[44:54] somebody out here you think's a devil
[44:56] and they're acting that way what one
[44:57] what are you going to
[44:58] be come on I'm trying to get one thing
[45:01] if I don't I'll take the whole night cuz
[45:02] I don't care I want this dwelt into our
[45:05] hearts and our lives to get away from
[45:08] that devil made me do it may I quote
[45:12] brother ROM he said if you did you had
[45:16] to go out because he can't come in
[45:19] that's right
[45:21] amen well I know I done that the other
[45:23] day but the devil maybe do it
[45:28] it might not be the devil you're dealing
[45:30] with right it might be that old nature
[45:32] trying to may I quote run
[45:35] around he's got to be dead cuz if not
[45:38] he'll raise back up we're going to get
[45:40] that in a minute but watching he'll
[45:41] raise back up and you can remember when
[45:44] you was in churches before when they
[45:45] repented of their sins and they walked
[45:47] good for a little while and then things
[45:49] started coming
[45:51] back right what happened but you get the
[45:55] point
[45:58] when we come up through there we
[45:59] repented of our
[46:01] sins all
[46:03] right and remember the way I was have
[46:06] been teaching and I believe it that you
[46:08] can only follow the amount of word
[46:10] that's being preached to you that's
[46:12] right amen now I didn't make the
[46:14] statement brother Brown was one that
[46:15] said it he said nobody can touch the
[46:17] teacher said you got to have that part I
[46:19] didn't make that part you call me a
[46:20] teacher call me anything you want to
[46:21] call me a devil I don't
[46:23] care I'm just telling the truth I can't
[46:26] I quote what he
[46:29] says see because that's what it's to be
[46:32] the five-fold ministry is the five-fold
[46:34] ministry right but there's just one
[46:36] there that in the teaching of the word
[46:40] is above but yet the prophets are above
[46:42] him as far as seeing visions and
[46:44] different all right but you see we got
[46:47] the idea and that's what I'm trying to
[46:50] get us to look at the
[46:52] drawing when you got rid of the
[46:54] sin you still had the old thing that
[46:57] caused you to sin that's right that's
[47:00] right because that Soul did not get born
[47:03] again at justification that's right
[47:08] amen that's why I said it's the same
[47:10] heart you start off up here and you wind
[47:12] up down here with a dove you start out
[47:15] up here as every
[47:17] individual everybody in the world is
[47:19] born that
[47:20] way born in Satan's domain motivated by
[47:24] the devil he makes us and brings us to a
[47:27] nature within us and that nature is that
[47:31] unclean
[47:36] Spirit now are you following
[47:40] me well brother Dale now here's where we
[47:43] go to brother Dale my daddy done this so
[47:46] I got to do this go do this somewhere
[47:49] else and don't talk to me about it my
[47:51] daddy was a drunk but I didn't have to
[47:53] drink I never touched it so then it
[47:55] don't work that way right well there so
[47:58] and so there in these genes you can
[48:00] argue genes all you want to I argue
[48:02] hereditary
[48:03] traits not hereditary
[48:07] genes well it's all these homosexuals
[48:10] they got these genes in
[48:14] them where' to get it
[48:18] from hey I know a little bit I know you
[48:20] can close your eyes and then after a
[48:22] while you can't see I know that but are
[48:26] you listening into what I'm
[48:29] saying when that unclean spirit is there
[48:34] that's the nature of your
[48:36] soul amen right that's what it is that's
[48:41] right it's an unclean Spirit signified
[48:45] as a
[48:46] snake because of that being in the
[48:48] Bible all right now as it does then that
[48:54] doesn't mean you're so devil possessed
[48:59] no you're devil
[49:01] oppressed from the time you're a baby
[49:03] are you listening all up through your
[49:05] life you picked up a nature you act like
[49:08] somebody you look like you know you
[49:09] actually wind up looking like people and
[49:11] you act like people and they're they're
[49:14] doing why because that develops a
[49:19] nature right we tell the story about the
[49:22] little boy and the daddy walking the
[49:23] little boy struggling to try to step in
[49:25] his Footprints right
[49:27] and said Daddy I just trying to follow
[49:30] you
[49:32] well that's why I was so hard and
[49:34] screaming our Sunday about it what and
[49:37] the other week about it we let those
[49:41] demons come in our
[49:44] children now you can't beat them out but
[49:46] you can pray them out you can love them
[49:49] out you can do a lot of things you don't
[49:51] have to love a in either don't worry
[49:53] about it it going to be
[49:55] automatic yeah but if you don't raise
[49:58] them children to serve God they're going
[50:00] to serve something y right right I got
[50:02] them in here after a while we'll get to
[50:04] it where brother around says what he
[50:06] said you every person in the world he
[50:09] said is full of
[50:10] something he say it's impossible to be a
[50:13] human being and not be full of something
[50:15] right right amen but are you
[50:19] listening right justification just chops
[50:22] off your pie sins sanctification starts
[50:25] dealing with the nature of the
[50:27] individual in his soul not in his body
[50:30] in his
[50:31] spirit stick with me on what I'm
[50:33] saying you say well I remember when this
[50:35] happen I
[50:36] remember remember when Christ started
[50:39] dealing with you right right right
[50:41] that's it
[50:44] amen I've tried my best to explain it
[50:46] even in natural terminologies why do
[50:49] some of you sisters hold held yourself
[50:51] down through time when other sisters
[50:53] didn't
[51:03] but just remember that snake is your
[51:06] nature and your soul is your nature the
[51:10] nature of your soul is God if you're
[51:12] born again that's the dove but of not
[51:14] it's of the world souls in
[51:18] prison now think about
[51:22] it then the natural typ in the spiritual
[51:26] he uses those things to bring it
[51:30] out and we just got through where he
[51:32] says that the
[51:34] sanctification it cleanses the Mind sets
[51:37] the heart the mind of the heart in order
[51:40] of Holiness
[51:44] amen he goes out he gets Justified of
[51:46] his sins repent of his sins and things
[51:49] maybe he's a drunker he go right back to
[51:51] drinking and all those things oh we can
[51:53] hold
[51:55] ourselves right
[51:57] now I didn't I I why I did but I I
[52:01] couldn't stand thinking of
[52:06] drinking
[52:09] right I didn't do
[52:12] it that's just
[52:14] trueu I'd haul people boys in my car
[52:17] take them over because in those days we
[52:19] only had certain places you could buy a
[52:20] beer I'd haul them over and get them
[52:22] bring them where they wouldn't get
[52:23] caught cuz I was the driver and that
[52:25] days it didn't bother you if the driver
[52:26] was sober or didn't
[52:28] drink I'd bring them back and set them
[52:30] out and then I'd go do my thing they
[52:33] done their
[52:34] drinking they used to tell me said
[52:36] brother I tell you what said I got so
[52:38] drunk last night I didn't remember what
[52:40] I done I said well then don't give me
[52:41] nothing to drink cuz I want to remember
[52:44] what I
[52:45] done good or bad
[52:48] right I wanted to remember what I'd
[52:52] done if I got drunk and piced out and
[52:54] didn't know what I done then I don't
[52:56] know whether I done it or not
[52:59] right but
[53:01] listen when he get Sanctified that
[53:04] cleanses that desire out of
[53:10] him it takes the want of it
[53:15] away he can still be
[53:18] tempted but it takes the one of it it
[53:20] away still he's not right yet that's
[53:24] right y then he's got to be baptized
[53:26] with the Holy Ghost and brought into
[53:27] that situation all
[53:28] right
[53:31] yeah now we've
[53:35] covered we've covered this but I give it
[53:38] back to them and way to where they'll
[53:39] bring it up and where we can do it go
[53:41] ahead with number
[53:44] three same
[53:46] quote Richard he didn't know cuz I done
[53:49] told Brother
[53:54] uh Anderson what I was doing and Sunday
[53:57] I'll keep putting in the same quote just
[54:00] give it another
[54:01] number this is the number we just read
[54:04] them in it ago where he illustrates what
[54:07] here's a human heart and here's a human
[54:09] heart this one over here has a snake in
[54:11] it that's sin that's that lines that
[54:13] here he has his life that's that soul
[54:16] that whole entire being of that heart is
[54:19] his
[54:20] life right that's his soul okay here he
[54:25] has his life
[54:26] see that's his life this one over here
[54:28] has a dove in it
[54:30] what which is the holy spirit here he
[54:33] has a life what has it done it's changed
[54:37] that soul to a New Creation right right
[54:41] not your body and spirit well this one
[54:44] over here has malice hatred Envy that's
[54:46] what causes it is this fell here what
[54:50] the
[54:52] snake right well this one over here has
[54:56] love and joy and strong what does it
[54:58] down here now when you are asked or you
[55:01] are forgiven of your sins you only done
[55:03] this took out to
[55:05] sin taking that away but the thing that
[55:08] made you do it is still there that's the
[55:11] old root of evil it's still there notice
[55:14] then you repent and are baptized in the
[55:16] name of Jesus Christ forgiven of your
[55:18] sins all right
[55:20] now that old root of
[55:23] evil go ahead to number four
[55:26] which is Luke
[55:31] 11:24 it's also listed in Matthew when
[55:34] the unclean spirit is gone out of a
[55:37] man he walketh through Dry places
[55:40] seeketh rest and findeth
[55:42] none he said I'll return unto my house
[55:45] which I came out whence I came out and
[55:49] when he cometh
[55:50] watch he findeth it swept and
[55:54] garnished y
[55:57] it's
[56:00] clean he finds it swept and garnished
[56:04] now he's talking about the soul right
[56:07] not your
[56:09] house
[56:12] right watch him then goeth he now I've
[56:17] got another one where it says that you
[56:19] know you remember the scripture where
[56:21] the the strong man of the house you
[56:22] remember that in the scripture the
[56:24] strong man of the house has to keep the
[56:25] house that's your soul that's not just
[56:27] houses and thing right then goeth he and
[56:30] taketh to him seven other Spirits more
[56:34] wicked now emphasize that more wicked
[56:38] than himself and they enter in and dwell
[56:41] there because we're going to say in a
[56:42] few minutes they going we're going to
[56:43] read brother Brandon where he says
[56:44] they're religious demons absolutely amen
[56:48] but what's a religious demon more wicked
[56:51] than this fell that's been here that has
[56:53] been a drunk an alcoholic a hormonger
[56:55] and all kind of thing all kind of things
[56:57] in his life but he's been forgiven he's
[57:01] been cleaned out of it he finds it swept
[57:04] and garnished then goeth he and taketh
[57:07] to him seven other Spirits more wicked
[57:09] than himself and they enter in and dwell
[57:11] there and the life state of this man is
[57:13] worse than the
[57:15] first
[57:17] why because of what's
[57:21] happened how does that unclean Spirit
[57:23] how does that uh remember now the
[57:26] unclean spirit is the same thing as root
[57:28] of evil right okay everybody with me
[57:32] root of evil unclean Spirit same thing
[57:35] right all right now watch him look at
[57:37] number five questions and answers on the
[57:40] Holy Ghost
[57:42] 1959 he's talking about Martin Luther
[57:44] preaching justification Wesley preaching
[57:46] sanctification and he preached that a
[57:48] man after Justified is all see but
[57:51] you've got to be
[57:52] Sanctified cleansed look the root of
[57:56] evil taken out of you by the blood of
[57:59] Jesus Christ which is what faith in the
[58:03] blood not a chemistry Faith In The Blood
[58:06] now what now you can't expect the
[58:08] lutherans to preach
[58:10] sanctification now that ought to be
[58:12] enough to let you know that that we're
[58:14] talking about something a little deeper
[58:15] than what are natural thoughts but what
[58:17] did he
[58:19] say the old the root of evil taken out
[58:22] of you by the blood of Jesus Christ
[58:25] where
[58:29] sanctification look at the next one how
[58:32] can I overcome 1963
[58:34] 825 we notice when the unclean spirit is
[58:37] gone from a man he walks in dry places
[58:40] that's exactly what the church has
[58:45] done Baptist Methodist those who
[58:48] believed in
[58:52] sanctification all right then Jesus said
[58:55] the unclean spirit that went out returns
[58:57] back to this church body and finds the
[59:00] house garnished swept clean living Pure
[59:04] Clean
[59:07] livs all right but then if that house
[59:11] isn't filled occupied then he comes in
[59:16] with seven other evil demons worse than
[59:20] he was now watch what he called him a
[59:22] minute and the life stage of this place
[59:25] is set s times worse than it was when
[59:28] the first place they had to be better
[59:31] and listen they had they had been better
[59:35] to stay
[59:36] Lutheran than it would to be to receive
[59:39] that light and fail to walk so will the
[59:43] Pentecostals you know what I mean the
[59:46] house is garnished he takes it to the
[59:50] church now if you can't think about
[59:56] and old some of you are old enough to
[59:58] remember when people live good and done
[1:00:00] good
[1:00:02] right you know that brother around him I
[1:00:04] what I've always I love to read and I
[1:00:07] love to listen to what he said you know
[1:00:09] that the Baptist was made a denomination
[1:00:11] as far as natural man's
[1:00:13] concerned way back down below
[1:00:16] Methodist
[1:00:20] right okay and you know what brother R
[1:00:23] said the Baptist had just become a
[1:00:25] denomination
[1:00:28] that was in the 50s might have been in
[1:00:29] the early
[1:00:30] 60s what's he
[1:00:33] saying they let this thing come back
[1:00:37] in and they rejected it when he brought
[1:00:40] the
[1:00:42] truth now we're not throwing off on
[1:00:44] people you know better than that now so
[1:00:46] get all of it out of your mind erase it
[1:00:49] we're not throwing off on churches we're
[1:00:51] throwing off on me and
[1:00:53] you right but we're looking at it what
[1:00:55] he say about that and you know that's
[1:00:57] what happened you remember when you went
[1:01:00] to
[1:01:02] church I remember when we went to church
[1:01:05] that a woman didn't come to church
[1:01:06] without a hat
[1:01:08] on why cuz she believed in a covering we
[1:01:12] went to church and no women ever come to
[1:01:14] church wearing immoral clothing
[1:01:17] especially pants or anything right
[1:01:20] no I remember when they didn't cut their
[1:01:23] hair
[1:01:27] my mother put on one pair of
[1:01:30] pants a pants suit you know who bought
[1:01:33] it for my sister that was a her husband
[1:01:37] was a Baptist
[1:01:39] preacher so the only one out of the
[1:01:41] crowd of a Preacher the the my sister
[1:01:44] bought her a dress she put I mean a p of
[1:01:46] pants she put a suit thing she put it on
[1:01:48] one time and throw it
[1:01:51] away now come on we're old enough to
[1:01:53] think about these things we're enough to
[1:01:56] think about the ages and the times and
[1:01:58] the way people happen I've told you
[1:02:00] there at the old church in
[1:02:02] Gillsville where the the church was
[1:02:04] sitting here right behind the church was
[1:02:06] a cemetery and when we come to meetings
[1:02:08] the men would go one way into the woods
[1:02:11] the women would go the other way into
[1:02:12] the woods oh bless God I can't go down
[1:02:15] that little tick and than
[1:02:17] everywhere oh
[1:02:20] yeah they were
[1:02:23] sincere and you've seen a lot of things
[1:02:25] happen right right but then you seen
[1:02:28] them dropping
[1:02:30] away we went back to the church where we
[1:02:33] come from about what 10 years ago I
[1:02:35] guess maybe a little more something
[1:02:37] anyhow one of the one of Matthew's
[1:02:39] buddies or Zach one of Matthews I think
[1:02:41] Buddy become a preacher really love him
[1:02:43] a good little
[1:02:44] boy and we went down to hear him preach
[1:02:47] and now they
[1:02:51] was didn't even look like a church no
[1:02:55] right no I'm not throwing off on
[1:02:58] them now may I quote brother brand it'
[1:03:01] been better to stay of Lutheran than it
[1:03:03] would for you to try to move on so I'm
[1:03:05] not throwing off on those people right
[1:03:07] you understand me I'm not throwing off
[1:03:10] on them I'm saying they might be better
[1:03:12] off than we
[1:03:16] are that you don't like but it been
[1:03:19] better if you to stay a Lutheran instead
[1:03:21] of trying to move on but what is he
[1:03:24] saying
[1:03:26] those who believed in
[1:03:28] sanctification seven other Devils demons
[1:03:32] worse all right look at the next
[1:03:36] one now this is back before he comes to
[1:03:39] anointed ones I'm going to emphasize
[1:03:43] that this is back before brother Brandon
[1:03:45] Pro preached on anointed ones so you
[1:03:47] know he knowed a lot and watch him cuz
[1:03:50] what I just read you was 63 it's 64 or
[1:03:53] 65 anointed ones all right now look here
[1:03:57] he's back in
[1:03:58] 58 the unity of one God in the one
[1:04:03] Church the Bible said when the unclean
[1:04:05] Spirit has gone out of a man he walks in
[1:04:07] dry places seeking rest and then he
[1:04:10] comes back with seven other Devils more
[1:04:13] worse than he was and the LIC of state
[1:04:16] of that man is eight times worse than it
[1:04:18] was at the beginning listen that's what
[1:04:21] happens to these meetings when people go
[1:04:24] forth in revivals and men are just led
[1:04:28] to an intellectual concept he goes off
[1:04:32] and joins some church and lets it go at
[1:04:35] that
[1:04:38] satisfied that's all right there's
[1:04:40] nothing to all this other nonsense you
[1:04:43] know what he's saying what we say we
[1:04:45] should not have it the pastor says oh
[1:04:49] that's all that was very way back in
[1:04:52] another age and the first thing you know
[1:04:54] the devil returns back with seven other
[1:04:57] Devils watch
[1:04:58] him and he becomes a
[1:05:01] religious devil
[1:05:07] right now you can follow it easy to see
[1:05:10] in the old days like I said we'd be at
[1:05:12] church we had one man and I'm not joking
[1:05:14] I told you many times
[1:05:16] before he'd come to a Revival every time
[1:05:19] he come to Revival he come to the altar
[1:05:21] cried and repented and said he was got
[1:05:24] it now I've got it now
[1:05:26] he never made it till the next night I'm
[1:05:29] not joking
[1:05:30] now but the next Revival he's back in
[1:05:33] the altar repenting I got it this time
[1:05:35] never made it till the next night now I
[1:05:37] did hear later that he made it praise
[1:05:40] God I'm hoping so all right but my point
[1:05:43] is
[1:05:45] what he just come up so far and go back
[1:05:49] now it's easy to see that you used to
[1:05:51] drink smoke caral run around with women
[1:05:53] and you come to church and you repent of
[1:05:55] your sins
[1:05:57] sins and you you you repent and you you
[1:06:00] know you try to make things right we was
[1:06:02] in a Baptist
[1:06:04] Church and a man got up in the church
[1:06:08] and repented of his
[1:06:11] life before the
[1:06:16] church it's wonder they hadn't killed
[1:06:20] him you know why because he called the
[1:06:23] names of the women that were sitting in
[1:06:24] the church
[1:06:26] that he had been running around with you
[1:06:29] think he wouldn't
[1:06:31] sincere but he didn't make
[1:06:34] it you understand it's easy to think the
[1:06:37] demon comes back and you're seven times
[1:06:39] worse well this guy over here he was a
[1:06:41] pretty good guy he done pretty good but
[1:06:42] then he starts drinking he starts
[1:06:43] smoking he and you name seven things I
[1:06:46] wish you would I'll get it for you if
[1:06:47] you'd like it of the seven demons that
[1:06:49] was cast out of Mary
[1:06:53] Magdalene and not a one of them had
[1:06:55] anything to do with lust or anything of
[1:06:58] that order I'm talking about your
[1:07:00] Prophet said it was Pride boast this
[1:07:02] that or the
[1:07:03] other see we think it was these bad
[1:07:06] demons that's what I'm saying we think
[1:07:07] boy he laid his hand on her cast out
[1:07:09] them Devils them devil just come out of
[1:07:12] her and it was over here it went this
[1:07:14] way and over here it
[1:07:18] went
[1:07:22] religious religious demons
[1:07:26] then he's filled watch
[1:07:28] him and he becomes a religious devil
[1:07:32] then he's really
[1:07:33] filled then he's got pride and jealousy
[1:07:36] and and he's even angry with the very
[1:07:39] God that wrote the Bible he looks down
[1:07:42] there and says these things that I do
[1:07:44] shall you do that was for the
[1:07:48] disciples is that what people say
[1:07:51] religious demons
[1:07:55] unclean Spirit coming back is religious
[1:07:59] demons come on I emphasize it trying to
[1:08:03] we think it's them going back into the
[1:08:04] world of sin and the things they used to
[1:08:06] do and that's
[1:08:08] true but what about the others that come
[1:08:10] to
[1:08:12] church religious
[1:08:14] demons watch him go ahead to the next
[1:08:18] one which is number eight I think that's
[1:08:21] right we on yeah
[1:08:23] okay this is
[1:08:26] un un united under one head okay so
[1:08:30] you'll know the difference between it
[1:08:31] and that one while I go now what happens
[1:08:35] you can't stand
[1:08:39] neutral I'm going to hit this just a
[1:08:41] little bit and
[1:08:42] quit because I've got this too much to
[1:08:47] go and watch can't put it all in
[1:08:50] tonight now what happens you can't stand
[1:08:53] neutral
[1:08:58] okay would you pull up the drawing of
[1:09:01] number
[1:09:05] four pull up to number four drawing
[1:09:08] Brother
[1:09:13] Anderson sin's gone the unclean spirit
[1:09:16] is
[1:09:22] gone beautiful place to be
[1:09:27] but what if you don't go on and the
[1:09:29] demon comes
[1:09:32] back you go back into sin like I said
[1:09:34] about all you know most people go back
[1:09:36] into the sin they came out of go back to
[1:09:38] their drinking go back to their thing
[1:09:40] but others go to
[1:09:42] church and become
[1:09:44] religious
[1:09:50] demons
[1:09:52] amen now I don't want to draw it in
[1:09:55] there but it'd be something wouldn't it
[1:09:57] if that other one was a
[1:10:00] snake and this one and it had sin on our
[1:10:04] first drawing what would be seven times
[1:10:11] worse right in yours if you want to
[1:10:17] religious now you know that what I'm
[1:10:19] telling you is the
[1:10:20] truth I'm not throwing off on nobody out
[1:10:23] there come on but I'm telling you the
[1:10:25] God's honest truth you remember where
[1:10:27] you come from and the people that become
[1:10:31] religious the most hateful people you've
[1:10:34] ever
[1:10:34] seen
[1:10:37] right arrogant hateful people some of
[1:10:41] them was love and
[1:10:43] sweet but what's the biggest portion
[1:10:46] right you can't tell me I'm
[1:10:52] wrong I've been Justified sanctified the
[1:10:55] Holy Ghost you can't tell me I'm
[1:10:59] wrong you would put back everything that
[1:11:03] you started with back into that soul and
[1:11:06] add six times worse than what it
[1:11:10] was you're getting pretty close there to
[1:11:13] be devil possessed all
[1:11:16] right but I still say it's devil
[1:11:20] oppressed because he doesn't come and
[1:11:22] live in
[1:11:23] there like a devil he's back there as a
[1:11:26] nature a
[1:11:29] way now you know yourself that you've
[1:11:31] been around him in this
[1:11:34] message and I'm going to go ahead and
[1:11:35] say it so you just might as well get
[1:11:37] ready to get you see double married
[1:11:40] preachers in this message and they'll
[1:11:43] spend half of their time trying to prove
[1:11:45] it's okay for them to
[1:11:47] preach I ain't saying no
[1:11:51] more religious demons you calling don't
[1:11:55] and call
[1:11:58] nobody if you thought of that then you
[1:12:00] must have been thinking the same
[1:12:03] thing or at least
[1:12:06] wondering listen you st can't stand
[1:12:10] neutral go back to that one now number
[1:12:13] eight what happens you can't stand
[1:12:15] neutral you can't stay like
[1:12:22] that now you can repent and clean C out
[1:12:26] repent and clean out you may be able to
[1:12:28] stay at a certain
[1:12:31] spot but you'll never find a peace in
[1:12:34] your heart I see
[1:12:36] it I spent 10 years in a Baptist
[1:12:41] Church believing I was a born again
[1:12:44] believer a
[1:12:46] deacon teaching the adult Sunday School
[1:12:50] classes left there and come in this
[1:12:52] message
[1:12:55] two years in this message before I would
[1:12:58] ever confess that I had the baptism of
[1:13:00] the Holy
[1:13:03] Ghost you've heard me say it I've read
[1:13:07] six books and listened to two tapes in
[1:13:08] one
[1:13:11] day I was called a two-year
[1:13:15] Theologian by the people of this
[1:13:20] message I was talking one day about
[1:13:22] something and I said brother Brian said
[1:13:23] so and so this brother got right up in
[1:13:25] in front of me and everybody lambasted
[1:13:27] me good brother Bram never said it I
[1:13:30] just listened to that tape the other day
[1:13:33] and he didn't say
[1:13:35] that the next time we met I handed him
[1:13:39] the book and I said would you mind
[1:13:42] reading this right
[1:13:44] here I ain't de christianizing him cuz
[1:13:47] that was the state he was under that was
[1:13:50] the ministry he was under and he turned
[1:13:52] around and he said brother Dale you're
[1:13:54] right
[1:13:55] WR around and said it was he said I
[1:13:57] listen to that tape and I didn't hear
[1:14:01] that I'm not de christianizing nobody
[1:14:04] you think I am you think when I talk
[1:14:06] about ministers or doing this you know
[1:14:08] it's a God's honest truth but you know
[1:14:11] one thing for certain I love them
[1:14:19] people maybe I'm the one with a bad
[1:14:21] Spirit that's okay I don't have no
[1:14:24] problem cuz you see I have to deal with
[1:14:26] that you don't have to deal with
[1:14:29] it but
[1:14:31] look and what
[1:14:35] happens watch what he says that's the
[1:14:37] way it is with the true Born Again watch
[1:14:39] it experience of
[1:14:42] God man says there's no such a thing as
[1:14:46] the baptism of the Holy
[1:14:48] Ghost now he evidently ain't talking
[1:14:50] about truly born again because truly
[1:14:52] born again to believe in it right but
[1:14:54] he's emphasizing it
[1:14:58] right man says no such a thing as a
[1:15:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost it shows he
[1:15:03] hasn't got it now I didn't say it he
[1:15:07] trusts his Creeds he trust what God said
[1:15:12] listen we trust what God said he trust
[1:15:16] his Creeds We Trust what God Said Amen
[1:15:18] now what happened you can't stand
[1:15:20] neutral you got to be filled with
[1:15:22] something to survive notice you might be
[1:15:24] filled with one thing or another you say
[1:15:27] brother brandham I'm kind of on the
[1:15:32] fence no you're not that's right listen
[1:15:38] the Bible plainly says and all that was
[1:15:41] not sealed with the Holy Ghost receive
[1:15:44] the mark of the
[1:15:46] beast all that didn't have the Seal of
[1:15:48] God in their forehead had the mark of
[1:15:51] the beast you got one of it now on now
[1:15:55] may I quote brother random off of
[1:15:56] another and what did he
[1:15:58] say he said but you say brother random
[1:16:00] said we got the mark of the beast he
[1:16:02] said if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:16:04] you're already
[1:16:06] marked now come on folks we're not
[1:16:08] throwing off on nobody
[1:16:10] right but a man that die denies God's
[1:16:13] word and won't stand on his word how can
[1:16:15] you be saying he's got the Holy Ghost
[1:16:25] come
[1:16:26] on but you got to be filled with
[1:16:28] something watch him I'd like to test it
[1:16:32] just a little bit and see where we're
[1:16:35] standing I didn't finish that but around
[1:16:38] he emphasized you're either you don't
[1:16:40] have to wait for the mark of the beast
[1:16:42] you're already
[1:16:43] marked he said you're already marked
[1:16:45] with the mark of the beast that's where
[1:16:47] you're born at born with the mark of the
[1:16:49] beast oh bless God I ain't got the mark
[1:16:51] of the beast if you born again you got
[1:16:53] the mark of the beast amen
[1:16:55] there's one or the other so which one is
[1:16:57] it oh the mark of the beast remember is
[1:17:01] a religious
[1:17:05] Mark see we think about the mark of the
[1:17:07] beast is the big bad Devils the Big Bad

[1:17:18] with
[1:17:20] religion you could have all kind of
[1:17:23] religion that doesn't save you at all

[1:17:56] with a lot of hatred you despise
[1:17:59] everybody that don't agree with you you

[1:18:52] too lazy to do anything about it
[1:18:55] it ain't that something then we're going
[1:18:58] to stop right there cuz I got a lot more
[1:19:01] to go down but I will tell you one thing
[1:19:04] if you'll think about
[1:19:06] it see when you come to religious
[1:19:10] demons the next will be you come to
[1:19:14] anointed ones
[1:19:18] amen Anointed with a genuine Holy Spirit
[1:19:21] on your spirit that's why I said twoo
[1:19:23] much to go come on musician too much to
[1:19:25] go through theight but
[1:19:29] listen what is
[1:19:33] it the unclean Spirit goes out Jesus
[1:19:39] said sure he returns back to a lot of
[1:19:42] people and takes them out back right
[1:19:43] where they came from but that's not the
[1:19:45] person you got to worry about the person
[1:19:47] you got to worry about is the one he
[1:19:48] brings the church and sits in the pews
[1:19:51] with you but watch what I'm saying and
[1:19:54] then you think about it now I know I'm
[1:19:56] hateful but
[1:19:58] listen where has all of these things
[1:20:01] went now in the
[1:20:03] message it's took them 40
[1:20:06] years to get run off the
[1:20:10] truth now they got their own website
[1:20:13] that started what what did it start with
[1:20:16] believe the vision or follow believe the
[1:20:19] sign that's what it started with a great
[1:20:23] internet system to believe brother
[1:20:25] Brandon was a prophet and everything
[1:20:27] just kept pouring it on then one day
[1:20:29] they
[1:20:30] started saying he wasn't a prophet and
[1:20:33] all that he done was
[1:20:35] wrong now you tell me that them unclean
[1:20:38] spirits ain't come back
[1:20:43] amen what would you do if you preached
[1:20:45] this message for 30 40
[1:20:47] years and then turn you back on it
[1:20:51] right and go they won't do that in the
[1:20:53] Baptist Church
[1:20:56] right you understand what I mean they
[1:20:58] won't do it right but yet they've turned
[1:21:01] against brother R's message trying to
[1:21:03] prove he's wrong in every
[1:21:09] way listen folks I've always just been
[1:21:12] straight if I was a
[1:21:14] heathen and a total idiot and to the
[1:21:17] point that I didn't believe in
[1:21:19] God you know now listen I didn't believe
[1:21:22] in God at all I'd still want my kids to
[1:21:27] have an opportunity to think things over
[1:21:30] I would want my grandkids to think
[1:21:32] things over for themselves I'd want my
[1:21:35] great grandkids to think things
[1:21:37] over and to believe in God they would be
[1:21:40] no way I would
[1:21:44] ever you have been here with me long
[1:21:47] enough you know that I've always said it

[1:22:11] and I said no I will tell you the tape I
[1:22:15] preached on it if you want
[1:22:17] that if you're interested enough to find
[1:22:20] out you listen to the
[1:22:23] tape cuz I'm not not an internet
[1:22:25] Pastor I pastored this little group
[1:22:28] right

[1:22:31] soul and my
[1:22:33] soul and that's what I'm telling you
[1:22:37] we're going to all show what we
[1:22:39] are
[1:22:42] yep you got to be filled with
[1:22:44] something we're going to show what we
[1:22:46] are that's right period we're going to
[1:22:48] show what we
[1:22:50] are you just see the people of this
[1:22:52] message now already showing what they
[1:22:53] are
[1:22:58] but you know I like what the Bible
[1:23:01] says who was it said even if Christ is
[1:23:04] preached by contention said I
[1:23:08] Glory a glory for error because not
[1:23:12] Glory that there is error not that way
[1:23:14] now come
[1:23:15] on but by error being preached it'll
[1:23:18] make you
[1:23:22] study when they start Ed all of that
[1:23:25] back in the 70s of the two
[1:23:28] Souls it made me dig to find out what is
[1:23:31] a
[1:23:33] soul 40 years later I'm still talking
[1:23:36] about it
[1:23:39] amen there must needs be heresies among
[1:23:42] you that they that are approved may be
[1:23:44] made manifest that's
[1:23:47] Bible we don't glory in
[1:23:49] error we glory in
[1:23:53] truth cuz truth will expose the error in
[1:23:56] every one of
[1:24:00] us only thing I've ever ask God to do is
[1:24:03] let
[1:24:04] me stand and see you
[1:24:08] there whether I'm make it or
[1:24:13] not I dedicated my life years ago to
[1:24:16] this
[1:24:17] message and I don't have no secondary I
[1:24:20] don't have no place to go I don't have
[1:24:22] no Swiss bank account
[1:24:26] you you'd think of joking it way back a
[1:24:29] long time ago that the preachers in this
[1:24:31] message a lot of the big guys were
[1:24:32] sending money to a Swiss bank account
[1:24:35] why because Swiss bank account supposed
[1:24:36] to stay up when the rest of them fall I
[1:24:39] don't think so go we're all on the gold
[1:24:41] standard but it's truth right I don't
[1:24:45] have anything left over just in case
[1:24:46] this don't
[1:24:48] work I got everything anchored in this
[1:24:51] message let's stand you forgive me for
[1:24:53] being arrogant hateful and whatever and
[1:24:55] you place it to my ignorance and my part
[1:24:58] but you just remember what I'm trying to
[1:25:00] do you go back and you read what your
[1:25:03] Prophet had to
[1:25:08] say well I ain't got time to look you
[1:25:10] that's like a brother come here one time
[1:25:12] brother Mo was talking about stature of
[1:25:14] perfect man and the brother said how
[1:25:16] long did you preach on it he said either
[1:25:18] 62 or 72 messages he said I ain't got
[1:25:22] time to listen all them messages would
[1:25:25] you know what he had plenty of time to
[1:25:27] go on off into era and just believe
[1:25:28] anything he wanted to I got so tickle
[1:25:30] that brother mo one time only time I've
[1:25:32] ever seen him brother mo didn't say
[1:25:33] anything to anybody and and I'll
[1:25:36] illustrate it this brother he was right
[1:25:37] here preaching one I'm just talking
[1:25:39] about and he said brother brandham said
[1:25:42] that the fivefold ministry was folded up
[1:25:47] I can't roll this one piece and laid on
[1:25:50] the
[1:25:51] Shelf well you know what he was one of
[1:25:53] the fivefold Ministry well what didn't
[1:25:55] he shut up
[1:25:57] right you know if he's folded on the
[1:26:00] Shelf he's supposed to be up on the
[1:26:02] Shelf of course he didn't believe it
[1:26:04] that way
[1:26:05] right but he said brother randam said he
[1:26:07] folded it up let it on the sh brother M

[1:29:57] Judas is
[1:29:59] Garrett walked right up through there
[1:30:02] with the Lord
[1:30:03] Jesus and nobody
[1:30:06] knowed but the Lord Jesus who he was
[1:30:11] amen you know what I think he was doing
[1:30:13] pretty good because brother Brown said
[1:30:15] he went through justification
[1:30:16] sanctification now you have to argue
[1:30:18] with him about it so you mean that
[1:30:20] unclean Spirit
[1:30:22] yeah yeah I don't have enough time to
[1:30:24] finish Richard and I were talking the
[1:30:25] other day about
[1:30:27] this he said now if you either Faith or
[1:30:30] doubt and he said you come to clean it
[1:30:31] out he said what are you I said I don't
[1:30:34] know we'll have a lot to talk
[1:30:35] about when we get there but I do think
[1:30:39] one thing I believe Judas repented of
[1:30:41] his sins and he become Sanctified this
[1:30:44] is well let's AR rest of him because
[1:30:45] that's St John 17 same thing what's see
[1:30:48] you going to say well wasn't genuine
[1:30:50] you're going to have to argue with
[1:30:51] brother random because he said it was
[1:30:53] all right
[1:30:54] huh but what happened in that Upper
[1:31:01] Room did a big bad devil come down
[1:31:06] and or did you just open the
[1:31:10] door long
[1:31:13] enough for that old nature that old ways
[1:31:16] and that old being that love money and
[1:31:19] things amen walked right back into
[1:31:22] Judas and he went went out and sold the
[1:31:24] Lord
[1:31:26] Jesus
[1:31:28] right the unclean Spirit came back and
[1:31:32] he went out and sold
[1:31:34] him but listen folks I've never been too
[1:31:37] bad on Judas right because you think
[1:31:39] about Peter what was it about Peter when
[1:31:41] his the unclean Spirit was drove out of
[1:31:44] Peter Well Peter Peter denied the Lord
[1:31:48] and cursed in denying him right
[1:31:55] cursed it must have been that unclean
[1:31:59] Spirit but you see he went away crying
[1:32:02] in Repentance Judas did
[1:32:06] also but there was something
[1:32:10] wrong now may I say what R around said
[1:32:12] he said the problem with Judas he did
[1:32:15] not make it to
[1:32:18] Pentecost that's what he
[1:32:20] said see Peter made it
[1:32:26] I just hope you'll go home think about
[1:32:28] these
[1:32:29] things get the future home and just read
[1:32:33] it and read it and read
[1:32:37] it and see what he
[1:32:40] says like I said i' after all the years
[1:32:42] that I've been preaching from the future
[1:32:44] home I never seen that part that's in
[1:32:47] there that little sentence where he said
[1:32:49] and here he has a life
[1:32:54] then he brings it down to the Dove and
[1:32:56] he said and here he has a life why
[1:32:58] because it's
[1:33:01] him a soul is what you are that is your
[1:33:05] life you're being your
[1:33:08] person think on these things
[1:33:11] father we pray that you would just bless
[1:33:13] each and every one of us as we go our
[1:33:15] separate ways going home and may we Lord
[1:33:18] come to the place of
[1:33:20] realization that all of these things are
[1:33:22] dwelling upon us because Lord even as a
[1:33:25] prophet would bring it and the people
[1:33:27] would see why I don't have enough time
[1:33:30] tonight those demons that was turned
[1:33:33] loose on Israel to drive them to the
[1:33:35] Homeland those demons the prophet said
[1:33:37] has been turned loose upon the Bride of
[1:33:39] Jesus Christ to drive her to the message
[1:33:42] of the hour well look what it's doing
[1:33:44] Lord It's driving a lot
[1:33:46] away but it's driving some right to that
[1:33:49] word that they'll stand on it and it
[1:33:51] don't matter what we love you and we
[1:33:53] thank you be with the people on the way
[1:33:54] home forgive our sins take care of
[1:33:56] everything in Jesus name amen you're
[1:34:00] dismissed
[1:34:13] Jes Jesus be the Lord of all the
[1:34:20] kingdoms of my heart
[1:34:25] Jesus I
[1:34:28] surrender all
[1:34:31] Jesus I
