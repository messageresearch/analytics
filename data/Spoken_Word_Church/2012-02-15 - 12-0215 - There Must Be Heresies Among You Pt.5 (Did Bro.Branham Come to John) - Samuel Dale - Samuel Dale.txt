TRANSCRIPT
========================================
398 we did here know a brand new free jesus is me jesus open the eyes of my heart to see you holy holy pour out your power and oh moses had met him a lot of things but one day he wanted to see it and that's the way we are right i mean good to see everybody in the house of the lord if you'd like to run any scriptures turn back where we've been reading from first corinthians 11 and remember the announcements that's been made this coming weekend the uh sweetheart banquet was to be there by six o'clock i'm gonna start taking pictures by then so i try to come a little earlier for could and everything will be doing and then we'll try to do that and then wade will be speaking to us as we're eating from six from about seven somewhere in there and we can get it together okay now i know you don't pray for these but brother uh tommy went to his operation fine today and everything is fine so we just keep remembering him had to drain a lot of fluid out so remember that and sister sarah um aaron's wife she failed the other day and uh cracked her hand now as far as i know it's a like a lime cracker or something within it you know and uh you know it's not what you call a broken bone but it's a line in there which is really probably i guess in some respects worse but uh she was doing fine the other day with it but just keep her in your prayers i know it'd be a lot of pain and remember that and also let's see huh yep brother claude weissinger will be by here with us on the 29th of this month on wednesday preaching for us to go into florida remember that remember the fellowship meeting will be on the third saturday uh march the 17th at 3 30. so remember that i think that's all the announcements haven't missed any so let's just pray and then we'll go right into a scripture our precious lord and our savior our redeemer or all in all and jesus is that wonderful name that we think about we love you and we thank you father and we ask you to just come on the scene in our hearts and lives because we believe here in the end time that truly we are there at that time to be able to understand it would be a time to open the letter i see and we thank you then in that we believe your word said the lord you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we depend upon that we believe you we thank you for all things just come on the scene tonight and as we speak about you and seal up our lips lord and don't let us say anything it would be wrong in any way but let us just be honest with each and every one of us that we all lord look to you the author and finisher of our faith we love you and we thank you and we committed to you now in jesus name amen verse first corinthians 11 verse 17 now in this that i declare unto you i praise you not that you come to gather not for the better but for the worse see in other words they have a lot of problems for first of all when you come together in the church i hear that there be divisions among you and i partly believe it for there must be be also heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you so it's not just that it might could happen it's necessary that it happens to prove those who can stay with the word and it will come out okay first peter 3 15 says but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear you may be seated lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we've been taking now for a few services uh trying to take some things that you know some of the believers in the message or the people believe and we are ashamed to say a lot of times that there are so many doctrines that are among the people of the message but there's also one truth about it the scarecrow is always where the good corn is at you know so if you plant something in your garden and you've got a bunch of old naughty weeds and things you don't put the scarecrow there you put it where the good stuff is at you know so that's the way it is and like i told you in reading that scripture it's it's not just a point of happening it is the fact that god wants to try you and i to see if we'll stay with the word all right so it's a trial and a test and a doing to see if we will just abide in the word and go right home all right now we've covered over a few couple of trickery services now and we covered like two souls two lords um jesus not being god to the river jordan we covered the seven thunder virtue message and then we got on to this last sunday afternoon on the point that they were saying that we don't have the holy ghost like they did in the book of acts and uh you know we've covered those things so if anybody hears that or interested in doing you can go back and hear the tapes and connect on you know to to hear that right but now i've said this or tried to every time i think i've covered it that just because when i will announce a doctrinal thing uh there are many many different groups of people believing many different ways and are all related to that and uh it's kind of like it was when we was in the baptist church not throwing off on them because i'm saying we're over here you know you had a lot of little fling-offs in the baptist church you had people that believe this and people believe that people believe this people believe that all kind of doctors presbyterians you had all kind of do it pentecostals and all but they they had like a one common gold ground or whatever to walk on and that's why uh we talk about those things and i say this to you like i said before that each one of these things that we've covered or will cover this is as far as i understand and have heard of the people you know especially preachers that i have listened to about these doctrines and you know that's why i do it and say that i would agree or disagree with whatever it would be all right and i say also that there's many people who believe just parts of these doctrines and things you know just uh just believing in parts of it or what it's bringing but you know uh it still is there all right now tonight we're going to talk about something that has been uh were around the message for quite a while and and uh prevalent i guess you would call it or among a lot of what we would call the big ministers of the message and they they follow on the line like this and you know and hearing some of them you maybe have never heard like i said some of these doctrines maybe you've never heard because maybe you've not been out well you're lucky you know that you haven't heard these things but you know i try to warn us because you know that we could be believing some of these things and it not be right well i want us to be right no matter what you know or who is offended at what we say or what we believe but just remember to you on the internet and anyone listening to this tape i'm talking to my church here if you want to listen and and consider that's fine but i am not your pastor i only pastor the church here in lula and i'm responsible for the souls here so then i just try to answer to the best that i can as i said as to some of the things that i've heard but now a lot of people believe that brother branham was the one that came to john on patmos to bring him the revelation that's right of these things all right and uh you know i certainly don't want to say anything contrary to some of the things but i also want to be blunt about what i say because at least that way i can be helped if i'm wrong you can correct me uh but see a lot of people that said they believe john now their own pathways we'll get to it a minute in the angel when john fell down to worship and told him to worship him not and and all he said i'm of thy fellow brethren and the prophets and things and they believed that that was actually brother branham that came there and uh the only uh i'll try to give even quotes that shows these things as to what they use and what they believe but the one thing i want you to think about as we start this thought uh you'd say well we'll read where brother brown said it was a prophet all right all right let's read that we'll read a lot of things that said in the bible so let's read it but then we must come down to a conclusion and be able to state and that's why i read that scripture you know to be able to give a reason of the hope with of what lies within you so see i have a right to ask you you know what do you believe as well as you have a right to ask me what i believe because you're supposed to be ready to give an answer of the reason the hope that lies within you and all like that and like i said a lot of you may have never heard this thought but it is prevalent among a lot of the of the ministers of the message that speak about it all right but the one thing i want to to emphasize before we start see i think that we we put the emphasis upon the one who came to john all right you know on papua's now we'll read just a minute but i'm just making my point and uh you know we put the emphasis upon who came to john now uh all that's well and good but i i always thought that we were supposed to be our emphasis was to be placed upon who came to brother branham right amen not whether or not brother brown came to john but who came to brother branham you know to bring us the revelation that's right all right and you know i i how did the revelation get to to brother branham to be able to take it to john he's someone who's a prophet that's that's all right so we're a lot of in the bible prophets but they were not able to uh bring forth only that that god had revealed unto them you agree amen amen and in doing that then uh see are we concerned of who came to john or who came to brother brown right and the main emphasis to me is should be put on what was brought you know and you know we put the emphasis on who done what well you know i i've never thought any of the prophets wanted to take any glory or honor i thought they all wanted to give their honor and glory to the lord himself all right see and maybe you say well brother branham you know right around said this man i agree with you we're going to read it because i don't mind reading it to you but i'm just asking you the question are we putting our emphasis upon who came to who you know well is that going to change us if we know that that was brother branham they'd come to join on patents would that change us see i want to know what was took to john right amen i want to know what john got all right here you go come on all right go john then wrote what he got right right you know he wrote down what he got he penned it brother brown called him in the church age book a scribe john was described not the author right right that's right of the book of revelation amen the author is the lord jesus christ amen we'll get down to that that's right i'm just laying a point to you then my emphasis my point is upon whatever came to john by whoever brought it to john would be be able to come back to me to where i can get to revelation right and uh i want to put another point right here if i as you i've jot this down and i'm not against anybody that believes anything i'm just trying to say when i believe and let it go but i just ask simple questions to me they're simple that's because that's my simplicity of thinking even if it was true that john came as i said brother around came to john on papa's now that was only the writing of the book now listen to it you have to agree because that's what it says all right then if we don't get the revelation of what is written in the book then we don't have it right now i'll quote this again in a minute no man can reveal anything to you or me that's right the holy ghost brother brown christ mr god revealed we'll get to it a minute said the holy ghost is the only revealer of the word all right now so if it was brother branham it came to john and told him these things that's only the writing of the book right that's right you get me come on i turned black and white that's the writing of the book man that's right but see we've got to know what's revealed right the book has got to be revealed right so then we've got to be able to get it from the book right right after the book is written sealed up and finished until the end time see because john was the last one writing 1895-96 writing the book of revelation all right so if he was the finality or the finish or the writing of the book well then what would it matter if who came to john to bring him the the ability to write the book i want to know who can take the book and god can come down into his hands and unfold the book unto me right all right amen and be able then to let me see what the book says all right and we know for a certainty we believe brother random done that that's right right right but he was the one to come to break because he's the finality of the prophets oh i agree with that 100 see so then what i want to do is find what brother branham see would bring to you and i right but still even though we can hold the books i don't have one out here with me as a spoken word book but i have a lot of quotes here even though we could have that does that mean we understand come on no it's going to take the holy spirit amen that's right to reveal right what he's saying right all right see then that way we're not concerned with who's bringing who to what right i'm not that's right my concern is is to be able to let the holy spirit take what has been brought and let it be spoken to me by revelation all right because only the revelation will do me any good all right and i talked with with one brother personally about this that i know his pastor believed it no but i just told her brother i said i can't see that i'm just honest i can't see what y'all are talking about and i'll get on into it in a minute on the emphasis part of it but you know are you you're getting the point now out there some people on the internet be listening what's the most important who came to john or what was written by john from ever who came to him and then brother branham would be the one that would come to bring to us in this day what was written back there by whoever delivered or whatever took place amen you know that puts the emphasis right back upon the prophet's message right amen and bringing it down to a point then that we should look at it and see that the most important thing is to see the revelation not to see who brought what right because this bible is not the revelation of brother brown right right no more than john was the even john was not the author of the prophet said right that's right he said he was described you know what a scribe does he records what he sees or her or whatever so john recorded it all the way through and as he was recording it he was bringing it down to you and i okay now as i said a lot of emphasis is placed upon that and people believe that brother brown came to join on facmus because of him being the prophet all right there is another side of the view that i would hold closer to but you notice i said a whole closer to i wouldn't say agree with it 100 but some people believe that that john was translated over into this day and saw brother branham and the opening of the seals and went back and wrote you know he was translated over into and brought over but now he the reason i don't go wholly with that is one point too that it would put too much emphasis upon the transmitting and the doings of who is what and who's coming to who instead of being the emphasis upon the lord jesus christ and he is revealing to you and i the word of all god now so let's just take some things that has been said and and let's just see what brother ronald had to say about this point here of the isle of patmos go ahead brothers pull up number one i don't know where it's warm out there or not but it is up here so if you could at least turn the fan on and give it a little a little higher stirring now look this is on them this is on the the revelation of jesus christ the series brought around preach of the church ages you know preaching 1960 1204 the morning service paragraph 113 and we'll read this scripture in just a minute to tie together with it and see what we're talking about then we find out that when john started to worship the angel the angel said see that you do it not revelation 22 i believe it is and he said for i am of thy fellow servants and of the prophets now watch it it might have been elijah it might have been one of the prophets john was an apostle but this prophet was sent and john being apostle looked at the nature of the rest of his epistle all right let's go over there and read this that he's talking about revelation 22 9 and we'll start from there so that we'll have the point of it will start eight verse i guess because in a minute i'm gonna drop all the way back up come on way down verse eight said and i john saw these things and hurt them and when i had heard them i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things and he said unto me see thou do it not for i am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship god all right now brother branham said it could have been elijah or could have been one of the prophets that come to join on balance okay now let's go on over and let's get the next one this is the one everybody likes to use which is taken from the paragraph 59 of excuse me paragraph 201 basically over to 209 or the 5th cl63 322 and watch what he said he said have you caught anything i just wondered if you was yes you see yes sir i might not have to tell you then sunday notice note it's wonderful now notice now and then according to the the time that god was going to deliver to andalugian world he said the eagle the time he was going to deliver israel sent the eagle do you believe that the time even on john do you believe that the time even on john on the isle of patmos this message was so perfect that he couldn't trust it with an angel okay i want you you know an angel is a messenger right but do you know the messenger was a prophet you believe that let's prove it revelation 22 let's see if it was an eagle so he was sure he was an angel he was a messenger but it was a prophet that revealed this whole book of revelations to him come on now it was a prophet that revealed it come on amen now see then we take what they are reading and saying well now you know in the days of the undeluviation he didn't send it by an angel he said by an eagle all right now brother branham was the seventh church age messenger that's right right he was the seventh angel you agree all right so now you see where it is laying down what brother branham is saying you see it was an eagle sure he was an angel he was a messenger but he was a prophet that revealed the book so now you're dealing with an eagle and an angel all right now was brother branham the son of man he said he wasn't that's right right he said it was a son of man we'll get to that in just a minute was brother brown the prophet or was he one of the prophets right now the only prophet i know to be in order of understanding is the lord jesus christ in a prophetic ministry all right see then that way you'll look back and see why brother brown would say that if you don't see christ in every verse go back and read it again he said because you've missed it see all of those prophets was christ to the people and even in the book of acts you'll find that jesus was the one that spoke to john i mean to moses at the burning bush right because he said he said he was in the burning bush all right see then not jesus the flesh that's right because jesus the flesh wasn't in the burning bush you remember how i always tell you gee when i say jesus christ i don't mean jesus the flesh i'm not emphasizing the flesh none whatsoever when i say jesus christ i'm saying christ and saying that jesus is the only name of god you remember that that's right all right jesus being the only name of god so then when i say jesus christ i mean almighty god amen who was melchizedek almighty god amen but he was in a form right that's right okay so now that's where we're going to go through this and look at it so we read there that brother ryan would say shirts and he's a he's an eagle he's a prophet but now did brother branham i asked you see the best way to answer a question and ask a question okay and uh i ask you a simple question do you believe that brother brown in human flesh corporal body human flesh ever what you want to use the word for terminologies of what you want to use do you believe brother brown come to join on patmos in a physical body if you do you've totally got pre-existence in your understanding all right jesus the flesh man never came to melchizedek right right but the christ did right the christ came to melchizedek or watched melchizedek that's what he was right all right see now think those things over i wrote it like this tomorrow just to you i do not believe that brother branham in any earthly form could come to john on patmos that would be pre-existence of a human form all right so we would annihilate the fact that it could be a corporal physical mortal contact of any form right we would have to annihilate that out of our thinking so we've removed that now i know it ain't going to change nobody out there believing and if you believe it ain't going to change you but i'm just i just preach what i believe okay it's up to god to reveal it to you or anybody else they gonna change nobody because they're gonna say brother they don't even understand well i agree i don't understand that you know but maybe the lord does and uh but i just try to stir up your curiosity and hey and i i know the scriptures too a little bit you know not all of them but paul says questions gender strife i scripture now would brother brown contrary to that when he said questions made a strong church what was paul talking about about questions right do you think paul didn't want questions how could van anders told him that he didn't know what he was talking about when he was standing there said have you received a holy ghost since you believed it if ananias had can't ask questions and brother around says questions about the strong church see so now what's being said see paul didn't like endless genealogies and things but there's a truth to genealogies in lineages so decide for yourself so yeah at least i'll try to tell you what i believe what where most people are just i don't know i'm not gonna say nothing because i don't know well i just go ahead and open my mouth and remove all that so that way you can decide what i believe and then you can make up your mind i believe that brother branham was not the prophet right that's right that's right he was a prophet all right i don't believe it was a prophet well listen i don't believe that it was a prophet now do you understand the emphasis brother brown was deep was not the prophet he was a prophet brother branham was not the son of man he was a son of man that these sort of man come to all right so then i do not believe that a prophet a prophet small little one was the one that come to john on patmos i believe that was the prophet amen brother branham was not the prophet he was a prophet that the prophet the lord jesus christ came to brother adam was not the son of man we'll read one of these in just a moment he was a son of man that these son of man came to now to emphasize the point and you'll if i don't get it in remember this later why would a man like john the baptist when we know that he was in the spirit in the power of life right or elijah we know that he was elijah number three right you had elijah elijah with a double portion john the baptist coming to be to recognize this as uh isaiah 42 and the one crying in the wilderness and different things and brother branham would be number four right right and then one of the two witnesses the elijah to the jews is number five all right now catch the emphasis john are you that prophet right now there's one or two things goes there john are you god that prophet now john are you elijah he said huh no i'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness right now if that said john are you part of that ministry of elijah amen this come five times in the bible john would have said yep i kind of believe i am one of them because my ministry would relate to it all right but yet he denies it so they say john okay who are you he said i'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness isaiah 42 i think it is which identified him to be the elijah ministry of that day you agree all right but he was not elijah he was not elisha he was not the elijah to the gentiles in the last days and he he was not the elijah to be the number fifth coming right because if he said yes i am elijah that would have covered the whole time yet he identified himself in the scriptures that's right and they said brother adam are you that alive jesus now i i never said that a lot of people say that about it he said brother branham identify yourself he's okay malachi 4. if my identification luke 17 30 is my identification it would identify the gentile coming of the spirit of elijah to be according to malachi 4 and luke 17 30 revelation 10 7. all right so you'll see the emphasis in a minute when we come back to it but who was elijah the spirit who is the spirit in elisha who was the spirit in john the baptist who is the spirit that was in brother branham who is the spirit that would be in one of the two witnesses that goes to israel it would be as we'll read in a minute it would be the spirit of prophecy amen it would be the christ deep prophet not a prophet right just one of them couldn't identify as being all of it all right that's right that's right are you listening elijah couldn't be allowed elijah couldn't be all of it brother brown couldn't be all of it right john the baptist couldn't be all of it neither could the one coming is the one that was in all of them and that the prophet now listen cause we're gonna quote this in a minute and we're gonna get to something he said the prophet is not jesus right amen now you're gonna catch that one so hold on to it see jesus was almighty god right amen and brother brown they asked him said was why wouldn't jesus accept worship he said that wasn't jesus no baptism he said that was jesus the hmm was so careful in his answers until he laid it perfectly in order because that was not jesus the prophet is the prophetic ministry of the lord jesus christ amen but jesus is the flesh right and jesus is the name of god so you gotta leave it that that profit could be just exactly like we went through the godhead right around and said god stepped over in another form and became the son amen to create the world see not another god man the same god in another form so the prophet that was in elijah elijah john the baptist bled around him and being the end time would be the prophet because he's the god god of all the prophets is the lord jesus christ amen all right now once let's just start reading we'll read a few of these things that i've already quoted go ahead brother the number four number four in this retail no women we got back up we go back up to numbers we go back up to number three i don't want to get this one in that word that somebody wouldn't come along and say wait a minute now this is that or the other let's get it lay it in there let's make your own decision this is paragraph 59 questions and answers uh book number four which you'll find this 1175 in your um see a book i mean cld book excuse me 11 75 right all right 64 8 34 which is question and actually book four paragraph 59 and see they're asking a question dear dear brother would jesus not accept worship in revelation by john when he failed to why would not jesus receive worship in revelations by john when when he allowed worship before would not jesus receive the worship and you know why would he do it when he was he allowed worship before him why wouldn't jesus receive worship when john wanted to worship him now look what he said my dear brother sister whoever it is it was not jesus that would not receive worship in revelations 22 8 that's the scripture we read you'll read it was the prophet angel who would not receive worship when john fell down to worship the angel that had showed him these things he said see that you do it not for i am of thy fellow brethren i am one of the prophets see see i am thy fellow brethren thy fellow servant one of the prophets give worship to god it wasn't jesus didn't accept it it was the prophet wouldn't accept it okay now but you're gonna have to go back and read matthew martin luke and john because surely you've heard me say this statement there was times in jesus's life that he would not accept worship you agree right right man what the bible says you wouldn't let him worship you yeah that was when he was alive but then it was time to do worship and he'd accept it why because he knew what they were doing one of them was looking at the flesh the other one was looking to the god in the flesh one was wanting to worship god in the flesh he would allow that but the other was trying to worship the flesh and he refused to accept it in the flesh so now it wasn't jesus come to join oppatmus no i don't agree i don't i don't believe it was jesus i believe it was the prophetic ministry of the lord jesus christ which would be as i asked the brother the simple question i said why do you want it to be one man one prophet why not make it the prophet which would cover every prophet in the bible the prophet is moses abraham name of all the prophets right that's the prophet which was the spirit of prophecy in a man and that spirit of prophecy in a man could have received worship but would not allow it because none of those prophets would allow worship of them all right and follow me we're going a little further but donnie said he was listening i forgot how many times on one teddy but i preached since 82 or 83 so maybe you don't want to listen to this one over and over a few times because i'll try to say what i can the best that i can but then you know if you misunderstand what i'm saying because your computer went you know over on another track right now and you're running backwards and forth on track two and i'm gonna track one see it all gets muddled up and you don't understand what i'm trying to say all right but look at the next one look at number four now let's just get down to it this is we quoted it we will put it on this tape this is from chrysler mystery god reveal paragraph 318 1963 728 and notice the holy ghost is the only revealer of the divine revelation of christ there is no school can do it no scholar can do it no man how well educated how godly or anything else there is no man can do it no man can reveal anything to you right jesus said quote brother branham right do you need this quote jesus said my own life did not reveal that unto thee but my father when jesus when peter said thou art the christ matthew 13 16 or 16 13 that which way it goes and he said dart the christ the son of the living god he said flesh blood didn't reveal it right around said my own life did not reveal that to him to thee that's what i asked the question one of those see even if it was brother branham that went to john o'balance that is only the writing of the book see then you've got to get something coming from dire to brother branham right back here on earth to let him preach it to us right and then the holy ghost can reveal it because the holy ghost couldn't reveal it what was written in the book come on show me did you know i'm right the holy ghost couldn't reveal the book of revelations only impartial things right until this prophet came that's right all right see because light had not shined in on you remember the pyramid and the things of the dreams and the cutting the top off and looking down in and all of that tied in together right because right around can't reveal anything nope that's right jesus said in my own life didn't reveal that unto peter but my father which is in heaven revealed it amen so i think her emphasis is placed upon the wrong thing even if we could prove that brother brown congregant on batman's that's just the writing in the book i hope you're following me that would seal it up and we couldn't get it what i want to know who come to brother brown he said well i know that show same way it went to john come to bread around one out down over here in tucson arizona and told him to go back home didn't tell him what the seals were come on show me he did go back home it'll be revealed to you what they play he comes back he said i on the breach and the guardians implicitly he said i do not know what that first seal is you said yes you did well you make him a liar somewhere he said i'm waiting on him amen all right i threw out the seal book study it run around was waiting on somebody amen surely when he gets down to the end he said i wish somebody would have caught what's been going on this week he said it's not been the angels of the it's not been nothing in me said it's been the angels of the lord bringing me back he said here for this tonight okay let's see these up by making sure people on the internet can read them go to number five questions and extra book two 1964. some say brother brown is the son of man i thought the pillar fire was the son of man am i mistaken well that's a good question very good but i am not the son of man but a son of man there's quite a difference jesus christ was the son of man son of god son of man son of david he said the question was there and all the things he said i am not the anointed son of man i don't claim to be his prophet many times i said it when i didn't think i said it and catch myself on the tape then he goes explain to the prophet is the new testament preacher well i you know he's he's all right he's explaining what's going on but he's not the son of man jesus was these other man but jesus was the word made flesh which was god in human flesh right the lord jesus christ right amen not this jesus a man he was the lord jesus christ he was god almighty in human flesh right come on look at the next one this is off anointed once the end time 1965 725 paragraph 258 and then the very day that the son of man is revealed revelation 10 1-7 read it when you're on the seventh angel's message opening the seals what is it not the angel is the son of man but the messenger is revealing the son of man amen did you get it can you get it separated now that's where it seems to be so hard for you you see not the son of man self but to sell it angel the seventh messenger is revealing to the public the son of man because it's left to shove it can't organize it's the grain it's a itself again all right he said well we're going down there it says it that the son of man was revealing who is the son of man we just established brother and said he was not the son of man so there was a church ace messenger there was an angel right but he was born a profit but being born to profit didn't make him decent a man right yeah it didn't come out what you meant as we go to the next one paragraph 269 and then 91. i wasn't the one that appeared down on the river i was only standing there when he appeared i'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things and happens as perfect they are things that happen as perfect as they are i'm on i'm only one that's near when he does it i was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what i knew it's what i just surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that god unfolded it's not a man it's god the angel was not the son of man he was a messenger from the son of man the son of man is christ what is he the son of man is christ he is the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man now brother branham was not what we were feeding him he's the one that god used i says plain is what he says that's right but he used him to bring us the message of what this prophet took to john on paper a lot of people think that what happened was it was brother brown's now this is another thought it goes in they think that brother brown's theophany was translated over into and saw these things you take over what thoughts you want to i'm not against any other i'm not against anybody in their beliefs you believe what you want to you have a right to but what i'm trying to tell you my emphasis is upon the lord jesus christ because he's the only revealer of the word and if this was brother brown that come to john on patmos i still want to know what that who told him something on pass right because what he told john was just the writing of the book i hope you catch that right no matter what you think about who come to what that was the writing of the book right this is in the day of the revealing of the book man see that's what everybody thinks they think that that brother brown in some theology form went there and saw this and come back why not just lay down as simple as what he said he said i don't know what those seals are that's right that's what he said read it he even said on the first field he said i've made a horrible mistake today if the holy spirit hadn't straightened me out on something my sister said read the first seal and say but that's where people won't do it they won't go read to see what the prophet said but then they'll just turn around i don't believe you don't believe what you don't even know what your story is at least get down and read the book then it might give a better understanding let's read this now there's three times so go to revelation one there's three times in the book of revelations that an angel appears to john now are you going to make that three different angels that's your choice there's three times in the book of revelation one is revelations one that an angel appears to john all right now let's just let's just take them out of the way let's go along and then maybe when we get to the end we'll have a better understanding revelations 1 uh verse 10 i was in the spirit on the lord today i heard behind me of great voices of a trumpet saying and what the voice say look sir red letter say i am alpha and omega the first and the last and what thou see is writing the book and sending them to the seven churches which are in asia and to emphasis in the smyrna under murderers under tatara and consortist under philadelphia and under leicester and once and i turned to see the voice that's fake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlestick and he turns to see the voice he sees seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one life unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the pouch with a golden girdle now i've done preach to you over and over who that is that brother and says it that's the bride of jesus christ comes gerd about the pouch it's finished that's god because it's like another son of man he didn't save us on a man what life about the son of man the reed his head and his hair was white like wool that's why the snow and his eyes were flame of fire his feet like a defined bryce as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters wrote around said many preachers witnesses page 57 church had booked he had his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when i saw him i fell at his feet is dead and he laid his right hand up on me saying unto me now look you do you have a red letter edition of the bible a red letter edition means jesus is speaking and does everybody understand that one god is speaking right so who's his talking now the one he falls at his feet says fear not i am the first in the lifestyle he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and how the keys are hell and death so we know for certain that wouldn't run around right i mean i solved that problem number one okay let's see go to go ahead and go over number eight which is revelation jesus christ church 8 book page 13. so we'll get this one out of the way and then we can go on to our talk this book is usually termed a revelation in saint john now the prayer the paragraph above this one is where brother brown says john was not a uh of the author of the book of revelation he's a scribe it's the paragraph above this if you want to read it go get your church egg book this book is usually turned to revelation of saint john but that is incorrect it is the revelation of jesus christ given to john for the christians of all ages it is the only book in the entire bible that is written by jesus himself through personally appearing to a scribe yeah now right he did say jesus he's jesus christ jesus himself written that he's talking about not just a flesh man going down to the next one number nine paragraph 110 the seven church ages 54 5 12. and then he looked upon jesus and had seven rainbows above and he was in which which was god's covenant and he was standing in the midst of the seven golden candlestick he was to look upon his jasper and charter stone jasper was ruben and sardis stone was the benjamin that was the first in the lights of the patriarchs that alpha and omega the beginning and the ending and there were seven rainbow colors seven church ages the covenant with him and his and the seven golden candlesticks with the seven stars oh what a picture if we get to it after a while maybe the lord willing all right alpha and omega the beginning in the end and said the lord which which is which was and which is to come the almighty who is he what's this revelation of jesus christ and here he's not a prophet here he is the almighty god manifested the alpha and omega i am a from a to z i am he that was which is and shall come i am the almighty pretty clear isn't it no chance of controversy there lord which was which is so then we know for certain revelations one could have been brother brown it was god himself right let's say in bride form all right that was vision 60 1960 1204 paragraph 257 and when i saw him i felt his feet dead my the prophet couldn't stand no more see such a vision he just he just snapped his strength and he fell right down on his feet as dead now watch and they laid his right hand upon him saying unto the right hand upon me saying say unto me fear not i am the first in the light oh my not a prophet god see no it's not a prophet this is god i am the first in the life i'm the first of the resurrection the life of the resurrect i am he that was he that is and that will come all right now so we'll take that one out of the way and we'll pull that one apart set it aside if that was not brought around that was god okay jump over now in revelations the second time this is used is revelations 19. revelations 19. i don't know don't get these up because relations 19 we'll start reading from verse 5. the voice came out of this room and watch and the voice came out of the throne where's the voice coming from out of the throne right say praise our guard all you saints and all and ye that fear him both small and great and i heard it where's the voice of a great multitude and that's the voice of many waters and that's the voice of mighty thunderings saying hallelujah for the lord god of neptune reign let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be ready to find linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the science and he says unto me now who would this would have come out of the throne and he said unto me blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god and i feel it is speak to worship and i failed to speak to worship him and he said i don't see thou do it not i am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy all right so now that doesn't list us to being brought around that lists the testimony of jesus christ as i was saying a while ago all the prophets and the testimony of jesus christ you agree every prophet moses elijah john whatever you know all the prophets they were back there micah i wanted that that was the spirit of prophecy it was not the man right my brother said about isaiah isaiah said a virgin shall conceive he said now ain't that an odd thing for a man to say all right no i mean let me go into the photo don't you think isaiah probably went home said but i'm goofed up how can a virgin can see you see what he said was true all right it had to come to pass because it was a spirit of prophecy right something he had prophesied now brother gary and i were talking about this the other day see as long as you and i keep prophesying we're going to die i preached a sermon one time many years ago and i preached it and honestly i believe it those who prophesy i must die show me one in the bible that prophesied it didn't die right now you can say well the lord jesus come on that's almighty god don't don't talk to me i can't you know let's go get on them kind of flings i'm talking about in the prophets from the people you know that paul said if we change them on the twinkling i i've always told you i believe when paul's seen that he's seen it just as perfect that it will be the day that it takes place to you and me but he couldn't make it manifest there was no way to bring it that time it wasn't time so it was a prophecy but what he saw was the real thing right brother brown never come and got something different he got it from paul when naaman saw trash jostling in the street he saw buicks and oldsmobile running together in our day out on the highway running like lightning with you know headlights on you know what he saw it because they could be taken over and see those times right because that was the spirit of prophecy all right now so we know that the first time chapter one and chapter 19 would not clarify enough to bring it to make it to be anything that brother brown was speaking of so now let's go over here and let's read this revelations 22 and we'll finish with this part and i'm going to say it again if you believe brother brown to be that that's fine i'm not going to argue with you but just take into consideration the things that we spoke of it should have been sensible enough of what we stated that there would be no way you could bring the human body corporal human physical body of brother branham over to john on papa's ill-regardless if you want to believe that was brought around to come to john you can't bring the body there that's pre-existence now you're getting it too far so you're going to have to back up away from the human mortal and back up into at least it had to be in some other form and see like i said they believe it was a theophany form that come across well that that's all right but just remember now and i know this is going to go contrary to what and we'll get to that doctrine eventually that most people think your theophanies off up in heaven somewhere come on bro brother around says your soul is your chaos okay we get back to that one don't have time tonight we'll get back to that one eventually and talk on so that if you're dealing with those type of things but let's just read revelations 22 and just read and see what it actually say all right see then we'll see that i'm not trying to tear down what brother brown would say you can go ahead and pull it up you want to radical revelation 22. they doing good man so watch now i'll read from here because i want to stop and emphasize because these have been underlying for 40 years so you know i didn't make no nuance for this message and he showed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of god another lamb now who showed it to it somebody showed this to john right okay you can back up over in another chapter pick up and see if it was an angel it's all right now watch in the midst of the street and on either side of the river with her the tree of life which by our twelve manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month in the leaves of the tree was for the healing of the nations there shall be no more curse but the throne of god and the lamb shall be in it and his servant shall serve him and they shall see his face and his nine shall be in their foreheads and there shall be no not there and they need no candle neither light of them son for the lord god giveth them light and they shall reign forever and ever and he says unto me these sayings are faithful and true now remember revelations 21 is the future home so this is own pies okay the future home is revelation 21. this is showing what's going to be in revelation 21. be no not there why lord god reigneth he says unto me these things are faithful and true and the lord the lord god of the holy prophets sent his angel unto his servants excuse me and sent his angel to show his servants the things which must shortly be done behold i come quickly now who's that blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book and i john saw these things and heard them and when i had heard and seen i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things okay then said he unto me see thou do it not for i am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship god and he says unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he says holy let him be holy still and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according to his work shall he shall be i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last now which one said that according to your red letter point the lord jesus was the main one speaking come on first in the life blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have a right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates and to the city or without our dogs and sorcerers and mongers and murderers and adulterers and whosoever loveth to make a lie i jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root and offspring of david and the bright and morning star i like that other one and the spirit and the bride say come amen now say what brother random said that that was a prophet maybe elijah or one of the prophets all right we go back to step one was it the person of brother branham that came to john on patmos or was it the prophet of god which came to john so you can't separate here in the readings the angel from the god who's fake try so it must be the prophet of the entire bible i believe that's who came to join on batman amen amen the prophet amen of the entire bible which would make all of the prophets standing in one finality to reveal because this man would be the one to reveal the next man that's coming number five he's going to israel he's going to take this message right the two prophets take this message to israel and they tell israel about who we are and what we've done see if we make it the prophet which is all the prophets together then we can see that the lord jesus christ is the prophet the form of god just as the logos was the form of god just as the son of god was the form of god now see i'm not a trinitarian but neither am i oneness i would to god one day i could ever get together enough to really preach what took place in rome in genesis because you see i don't have any trouble whatsoever seeing jesus christ standing on earth speaking to his father and not that he's talking to the one inside of him that's what everybody thinks my brother brown said you got the holy ghost in you said who do you talk to well i just whispered back inside of me i'm going to no no i pray to my father which is in heaven don't you jesus prayed to his father that was in heaven that form of god standing on earth was so much man that it could weep but it was so much god it could raise the dead that was god in another form called the son i believe the one that come to the general palace with all the prophets together in one prophet if you want to make that brother brown you're going to do what you want to i believe not that brother branham was to be introduced to the bride right that's it come on i just wrote down some things i believe i don't believe that brutal brandon came to introduce himself to the bride he came to introduce jesus christ to the bride right which is the word see we argue of who it was that came to john instead of thinking about what the man brought whoever it was whoever you think come to john batman it's not important who came it's important what he brought all right but remember there he only brought the writing of the word right come on so you better connected to the end time where this prophet could come and go in the word right and not just be who went to john but who went to all the prophets it would come out there with the revelation of jesus christ amen amen amen and introduce christ i don't believe we need to be concerned who came to brutal i believe listen i believe we need to be concerned of who came to brother branham and not of who brother branham came to but see the emphasis seems to be put on who came to john were you just in the writing of the book what about this who is the prophets it's the lord jesus christ i thought that's my nice doctor i thought the bible was a revelation of jesus christ right amen not the revelation of just one prophet right amen come on but the revelation of jesus christ amen right now may i state again so that maybe it'll collect on you elijah elisha john the baptist brother branham prophet going to israel the five times of the coming of elijah and neither one of them even if you're to ask elijah elijah are you the full total fulfillment of elijah he would have said i don't understand why i'm going to say this but i can't be all of it because that's what elijah said in john the baptist no i'm the voice of one crying in the building see it's not important who came to john it's important the message that is brought to you and i in this end time about this whole book right there did it that was brother brown amen but i still say he represented all the prophets amen anyhow you'd want to think about it i believe it was the lord jesus christ i believe revelation 22 when it turned to the red letter part that that's the one that come to john it was the lord jesus christ when you read revelation 22 it turned to the red letter showing that that was the lord jesus christ the lord jesus christ said i sent mine angel sure he did he sent us a church age messenger that was not only a church educator but a prophet anyway so that he could reveal the entire bible to this man that this man didn't have to take it to john that's no concern who took it to join it's the concern is what he took to join to be able to be brought to you and i to where god can reveal it right that's right and you take this prophet's message that's why that i say when i'm coming along reading a lot of time i just come down through there reading and you see all the right that's on there i don't write my bible what i do in mine because i write down what brother brown said i got it written right there in revelations one where he said this is not a prophet this is god it's because i want to know about who god is don't you thank god for all the prophets right thank god for the revelation amen amen the revelation of jesus christ john is not the author of the book of revelation right john is described right a lie uh let's see isaiah let me put this way my own words okay isaiah was not the author of the book of isaiah right he was described to write what the real author was telling him that's why david could stand forth and say they pierced my hands and my feet he could say the lord said unto my lord sit down on my right hand like that enemies my footstool the ethiopian unit was not the one that's either known as went down that philip i reckon we're talking to and he said is this man talking about himself or another because he could read there that it sound just like the man was talking about himself those prophets were so engulfed until david was probably even in his mentality feeling the beatings that the lord jesus was receiving because he by spirit entered their end see i don't have any problems with anybody i'm just what i say because it's what i believe my emphasis is upon what was brought to you and i by the prophet of this nice day if you give any more emphasis and they don't like to know it let's say it's not what i've got to say or what you've got to say and listen the prophet brought what god had to say but here's the main thing the bible said he didn't hear what the spirit had to say that was to each church age the main emphasis is where the holy spirit in you that we were talking about the evidence the other day of whether or not it can keep on agreeing with the work think on these things what do we have 120 in the red book anybody have a the need savior every will give day um bring your face is church maybe some of you were thinking of this brother they'll be careful what you say about the prophet i wrestle that out today because satan when i started studying for this he says you're going to get in trouble because you're gonna have to go against some of the things seemingly the prophet was teaching i said okay no problem because my heart's clear i brought what i thought what i believe and that way my heart is clear i don't have to worry then so don't think you say when i be careful i always try to be real careful the way i work things the way i say it because that way it's not that i try to compromise he says i try to tell the truth right if you believe that was brother brown that come to john on batman's anybody out there listening are you here that's your business all i still want to know is what brother branham brought to you and i wherever it come from or whoever got it that's all i want to know but i do know that that was only the writing of the book just everybody's emphasis upon that john if you say brother around come to john well then he was coming to john to tell him what to write he wouldn't come in to tell him what it was to reveal it that would be in this day amen see think on these things it's very serious in this hour that we're living but that's the way i think about every message every message i've ever preached i try to preach it with honesty and sincerity of my heart to believe and try to show you every side of it different ways whatever what people think but then conclude we're telling you what i believe see if there's any problems with heaven and the lord knows my heart's right so think about it stumbling on them come to me ready oh right m good musicians so um is uh
