========================================

okay all right morning everyone morning all right let's turn to where we were last Sunday in Daniel and read that first um have stand about that it get you yeah I'm not worried about me I just wanted to see the board we're just experimenting today so this is a test this is only a test the emergency broadcast system right Daniel 9:24 and what we're going to do is is we're going to pretty much try to nail this down go over what we went over the last Sunday again just for the sake of getting it on the video and then maybe start something else next week um Book of Daniel 9 cuz I want you to see one thing um and Daniel and I want to read you a quote before we get started from the prophet in questions and answers this is where everybody goes to when they are questioning whether there's one week left after the Rapture or three and A2 years but watch this key walk over there next to that Co to go open watch this key well I just wanted to get here watch the key in questions and answers in 1964 they asked him a question brother brandham when you gave the message on the 70 Church weeks 70 weeks pardon me of Daniel I believe that you mentioned that the full last week or last seven years will begin when the bride was taken in the Rapture technically he did because there's one week left after the Rapture he said that over seven times in the Daniel 7 week series but now watch what his mind goes to watch this right here no no no n nigh nay you got that wrong not the full seven weeks the week started when Jesus Jesus came on earth now that's not true according to what he preached in the six in the 70 weeks of Daniel not saying the prophet was wrong but if the week started right here you need to eras all this and get rid of everything he preached that whole week what's he saying he's saying there's only one important week listen the week started when Jesus came on Earth in other words that preaching right here here of the three and 1/2 year Ministry of Jesus Christ River Jordan we explain that he said to Messiah Prince you'll come and prophesying in the midst of the seven weeks he'll be cut off and Jesus preached exactly 3 and A2 years which is half of the 70 weeks or the seven days week week days and there's three and 1/2 years left but he said the week started when Jesus came on earth now the natural weeks of 70 weeks of Daniel we prove started back in BC whatever it was 536 or 584 or whatever it was back here according to Daniel in the time the weeks the time all right but what's brother brandham speaking of he's speaking of what we were talking about last week and that is there's a week of the Messiah or the Messiah s week right all right and what is a week it's um seven years one week equals 7 years that's what we started way back over here all right or the whole 70 weeks of Daniel the Prophet is bringing into one week all right one week so there's one week left for Earthly time but there's only 3 and 1/2 years of Jesus is Ministry left because this was probably a gentile asking him with the question and a gentile it doesn't matter about this last week of Earthly time because if that Gentile is born again he won't be here we won't be here but if you don't get this first half what Jesus preached right here if you don't get this first half you won't go in a Rapture here right so let's read now and let's let's go through it step by step kind of conclude everything 70 weeks Daniel 9:24 70 weeks are determined upon thy people upon thy Holy City to finish the transgression make an end of sins make reconciliation for iniquity bring an everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy know therefore and understand that from the going forth of commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem to the Messiah the prince shall be seven weeks and three score and two weeks all right seven weeks three score and two 62 that equals 69 69 weeks all right or 483 years all right the street shall be built again the wall even troubless times now this is for Daniel and his people we get the spiritual aspect of it they get the natural aspect of it and after three score in 2 weeks shall masi be cut off here at Calvary but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city in sanctuary and thereof shall be with a flood until the end of the war desolation are determined and he that's a little age shall confirm the Covenant with many for one week that's not Jesus Christ that's the Antichrist he'll confirm the covant for one week you and I Gentiles that's not to us we will not be here now Gentile bride won't be here Gentile Nation will be here Gentile bride will not be here during that last week cuz we get this 3 and 1/2 year message of Jesus Christ somewhere else like we spoke of last week and in the midst of the weak he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease for the overspreading of abomination he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determin shall be poured upon the desolate so now let's turn to Genesis where we were last last week and being a beautiful type in the Old Testament I hope those of you on the internet can see the board cuz we're going to be drawing on it but and can hear the only speaker we have on this one's right here that's why I'm having to talk a little bit loud CU it's not hooked up to here it's hooked up to there in Genesis 29 now let's set a stage here all right if if we take what the prophet put on the board and the chart and what he preached in Daniel 70 weeks this is what it looks like and that's what it'll be because we read remember last Sunday and we won't read it this Sunday but if you go over into what was it Matthew where Jesus they asked Jesus says how many times should you forgive a brother seven times he said no 70 * 7 what's 70 * 7 490 all right so you got 483 years it's just striking that Jesus said that forgiveness would be finished in 490 years or 70 * 7 forgiveness all right what is 483 years plus one year left after the Rapture exactly 490 years all right so that restores Israel back because remember make an end of sin reconciliation for forgiveness BR Everlasting right what's that doing that's forgiving us right Redemption is forgiving you for what you done and brought you back to your original condition all right so that's what we're looking at so so now let's really not take any more of these dates and times but let's look at it as what happened in the Old Testament between Jacob and these two wives Rachel and Leah now in Genesis 29 uh you can start at verse one CU Jacob went on a journey he came into the land of the people of the East and what'd he do he found this lady in verse 10 that came out with her father's sheep and Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of laan verse 10 his mother's Brethren the Sheep of laan his mother's Brethren that Jacob went near and rolled a stone from the Well's mouth and watered the flock of laan his mother's brother and Jacob kissed Rachel and lift up his voice and wept so who was he after Rachel called his eye right okay and Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother and that he was Rebecca's son and she ran and told her father they were all kin folk right and it came to pass when laan heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son that he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him brought him to his house and he told laan all these things and laan said unto him surely Thou Art my bone and my flesh and he Abode with him the space of a month and laan said unto Jacob because Thou Art my brother should us thou therefore serve me for not tell me what shall thy wages be and laan had two daughters the name of the Elder was Leah now what what's the older Israel Israel's the older remember even in Malachi it say it's going to turn the hearts of the of the fathers to the children but the children to the fathers right right what the old fathers back the people the the Israel is the oldest Nation Israel is the one that that God spoke of first so Leah was the oldest and the the name of the younger was Rachel all right the name of the younger being Rachel then we look at a gentile bride and then we look at the Jews as being Israel so there's your type all right that we begin with now Leah was tendere eyed but Rachel was beautiful and well favored and Jacob loved Rachel he said I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter laan said it is better that I give her to thee than that I should give her to another man abide with me and Jacob served seven years for Rachel and they seemed unto him but a few days remember we said last Sunday a thousand years is a day a day is a thousand years Jesus didn't mind waiting 2,000 years to get his Rachel but coming into the order of things just like why didn't Boaz take Naomi no Boaz took Ruth Naomi was older right typing of the Jews but he had to he took that younger wife to Bear a child to give to Naomi which we'll see that in just a minute in typ same here Jacob served seven years for Rachel they seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had for her Jacob said unto laan give me my wife for my days fulfilled that I may go in unto her lean gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast and it came to pass in the evening then he took Leah his daughter and brought her to him and he went in unto her and laan gave unto his daughter Leah zela the ma for a handmade and came to pass and in the morning behold It was Leah and he said to lean what is this thou Hast done unto me did not I serve with thee for Rachel wherefore then hast thou begal me laan said must not be so done in our country to give the younger before the firstborn look at verse 27 fulfill her weak now there's where we come to fulfill her week well what was her week years seven years so brother Bram said seven one week equals seven years that's in the Bible it just took a prophet to glean that out of the Bible we might have read it a million times we read Lord Jesus Christ baptism a million times right but it never stuck until the prophet showed us the order of how that scripture was the only scripture to be baptized right in the name of Jesus Christ all right same way with this we've read this many many times fulfill her weak and we will give thee this also for the service which Thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years now in the natural that might be 14 years but in the spiritual we're going to look at just one week or seven years because brother randam said here he said the week started when Jesus came on the earth now not when he came on the earth as a baby the week started when he started preaching right here was when he started ministering his gospel excuse me and that's when the week started because he said the Messiah would be cut off which he was and he was killed and then you've got a natural happening here but then the spiritual happening is here with you and I now why do we call it what is the Messiah the anointed one or what is the Messiah it's shows a sign right it's a messiah sign there's only three times that you're going to get the Messiah sign just like Jesus Christ did one time you're going to get it with the Lord himself one time you're going to get it here in the end time with a little Prophet called William brandom which she had the Messiah sign right he told the secrets of the heart nobody else was as accurate as he ever was all right then you've got two prophets going to Israel taking the same Messiah sign to Israel all right so now you've got a gentile bride which we'll see here in type is Rachel because Jacob typ in Christ he worked and labored all through these Church ages to try to get a gentile bride had his eye on her the whole time I believe but he hadn't to come in by the law that he created he had to pick up a um um an the older Israel you said oh well Israel was the apple of his eye no before the foundation of the world there was only a certain amount of names written in the book and that was not the 144,000 are the Jews it was you and eye the bride he had his eyes on us first but being God he comes down and says Israel is my people I'm going to marry her she's here she's the older and I'm going to come down and I'm going to save her and Redeemer but what happened right here they cut him off right so we proved last time that there was no way that he could take her back at this time he could not take her back as a wife he divorcer in the Old Testament to do what to get a gentile bride so he goes and he works his time laan pulls a squin on him and gives him Leah which would which would have broke the type cuz La said I can't give you the younger it's our custom to give the older I can't give you the younger he just didn't tell him that to start with but still what a perfect type this is so what did what did he do he worked seven basically this is what he done he worked seven years for this one right for Leah and he worked seven years for Rachel right all right now let's bring it together and see let's read the rest of it verse 28 and Jacob did so look how great now if it had been me and you what would we have said forget it I'm out of here I'm going to just take both of them and I'm out of here no no no Jacob was a type of Christ remember his name changed to Israel perfect type of Christ Jacob the the Patriarchs all the all the tribes had to come through Jacob and his concubines and Rachel and Li right so now let's read and Jacob did so and fulfilled her a week and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also so now what happened he went in to live he worked seven years for her he went in seven years worked and he got Rachel so it says here and he went in also under Rachel verse 30 and he loved also Rachel more than Leah brother brand said he loves his bride more than the servants cuz that's the way you you in the in the Book of Revelation that's the that's the way people sometimes they get Israel and the bride mixed up he said Israel are Israel is servants you and I are bride we stay in the temple with him we are we we minister to him in the temple you know your wife ministers to you in your home right she's not your servant I hope not okay told somebody the other day when we were talking about something and they were talking about U um ways to be more Amorous toward your mate and they were talking about going to Victoria Secret and going to this and doing this and doing that I said put on an apron put put on an apron get you a towel and some Windex and go to the kitchen start washing the dishes and I'll guarantee your night will be a whole lot better than it will going and looking for all that other stuff all right put that on the internet but look he the whole point was he worked seven years to get one and he worked seven years to get the other now Jesus Christ is not going to work 14 years all right but this is what he did and we were showing it last week what finishes this thing one week equals 7 years or the 70 weeks of Daniel can be summed up in one week or in seven years all right which is Jesus Christ preached three and A2 all right then he preached the same three and A2 again he's going to that's your base that's your base this is the base right here and then brother random you said there was seven years left no I didn't there's only three and 1/2 years left right mhm of a messiah week we prove that there is definitely one week left after the Rapture a few subjects before but this is important this is important and there's one other part that's important you and I got the same three and a half year Ministry of Jesus Christ when brother renam came on Earth preached his message not in the years of preparation he said but when he begins to bring his message and in other words the seals and all the things that Jesus Jesus preached six seals brother Brandon preached six seals and these two witnesses will be the six Seals All right you understand that brother Jo I'm not TR to be funny that who who Jacob yeah well that polygamy was F in the Old Testament I mean polygamy was fine back then but it's not now but Jesus won't have two we're talking about now we're not talking about natural things we're talking about Redemption all right Redemption is David could have 500 wives but they could only have one husband right you and I are millions of bride but we only have one husband but Jesus has many brides right but he only has one wife right that's all one wife now do I no that shouldn't even be be wi shouldn't be disc this ain't got nothing to do with that let's just throw that out of the way people we're not talking about sex and having wives and forget it this is spiritual we're talking about spiritual things here not worried about having I wouldn't want to L I hope all the men would say and the women would say Amen see there we proved that point not even out the Bible prove that point naturally right brother Ray but look in the Old Testament now that you brought it up in the Old Testament it was not illegal to have many wives David had 500 we're talking about this guy having just two but now see that's why we don't need to get get into that cuz they don't have time people don't bring that up no more because because you got Rachel had a concubine or a handmade and Jacob had babies by her this ain't got nothing to do with this Daniel 70 week just clear that out of your head back where he was had to happen on video okay but anyway Jesus Christ came on Earth and preached three and 1/2 years to redeem a gentile bride and I need to clear this up to that's 144,000 that's not all Jews okay but they fell as tribes back in the Old Testament when he divorced Israel Israel were saved Israel was saved as a nation and lost as a nation right right so now you and I we are saved as an individual lost as an individual uh I'm not saved because brother Donnie's saved but now these 144,000 there's only going to be 12,000 per tribe not going to be 12,000 one or one less it's going to be exactly that many so God is going to bring that many people in so Jesus come and preach three and A2 years all right then he was cut off that same three and 1/2 year message was preached down through 2,000 years but the Messiah sign nobody could take a Rapture with that because what happened to Jesus when he got finished preaching that three and A2 years what' he do he took a Rapture right right all right now what happens after the three and A2 years is preach to the Gentiles we take a Rapture right what happens after three and A2 years preach to the Jews they take a Rapture right all right so we got to get this right here straight so he comes and preaches he's cut off from this group of people this group of people accept him and then at the end time we got a little Prophet that comes and preaches the same Messiah message and there's your seven all right take your same three and a half that Jesus preached can't do away with that you say well it's it's not another three and A2 you know I thinking about this other day yes it is another three and A2 because Jesus preached and out of that three and A2 years we've had billions of sermons preached just out of three and a half that's all this world is right is based on Jesus preached for three and a half years and every sermon that was for you know coming forth out of the Bible in other words think how many times that's been preached through here Baptist Methodist Pentecostal doesn't matter Lutheran they're all they all base sure you got your Old Testament but what did Jesus preach in that three and A2 years preached all the Old Testament brought it into the New Testament and and made it alive all right so that's all you got but it's an expounding of that three and 1/2 years all right because right here remember you said well brother Brown preach he didn't couldn't preach three and a half years cuz the seals were in March and whatever I've heard people go off on that remember it's 1260 days not our three and 1/2 years right God's prophetic three and 1/2 years not our three and A2 years this won't be our 3 and 1/2 years we will not look on a calendar and if you're here you can look on a calendar and you can count it up on the calendar and it won't be right but this is 1260 days according to the Bible right right all right so now we got us when we go up in a Rapture when this three and 1/2 years is Quicken to us by what the prophet preached we'll go on a Rapture right right then what will he do he'll take that excuse me that same three and 1/2 years and where's he going to go he's going to preach for 1260 Days to Live are the Jews cuz he's got to get her to get to get her time and that's seven right so brother random you said the seven that there was seven years left after the Rapture he said no didn't he said the week started when Jesus preached right they get the last half everybody see that that's the last half right there half of seven is three and A2 all right so all this right here is redemption in one week or what is one week equal seven years that's the whole Daniel 70 weeks in a nutshell whatever puts us in a Rapture is going to put the Jews in a Rapture pretty simple all right any question now remember we're still in time I know 490 years 77s is 49 that's still in time that's the seventh day that's Millennium even the Millennium all the way to the white Throne judgment is going to be that 490 years right all right the 50th is when that new city comes down and we walk into that new city where there's no sin see during all this time even in the millenum you've still got the devil here you've still got things that's going to happen you got a white Throne judgment where people are giving eternal life but we can't get here without understanding this right here now two great things that comes out of this to prove this is right Rachel Leah has a bunch of them I'm not going to name them they they call them out in the Bible Leah had a bunch of the 12 tribes Reuben she had the first one which is the oldest right but Rachel had two which was what Benjamin and Joseph all right Benjamin and Joseph the only two Rachel had and when Rachel had Benjamin she died yep right Benjamin brother Brenham said types to 144,000 Joseph typed Christ right so out of this Gentile bride we're to birth Christ and what's Christ going to do out of us we're going to just now we're going to go back to Ruth and Boaz Ruth and Boaz had a child and who they give it to they give it to the old Mama Naomi right cuz they missed it the first time right but you got to get it the second time to finish the Redemption because sure sure Boaz raised his hand up and did all his right of redemption but remember what he was doing he wasn't redeeming Ruth right right he was redeeming Naomi right Naomi's was the property remember uh Ruth was the daughter-in-law a great thing because out of that though God had to take the younger to birth a bride to give it to the Gentiles so um Ruth and Boaz had to get get together get together in spirituality like you and I and the bride Christ and the bride together and then we just hand over what is birth in us we just hand it over to the Jews that finished the Redemption right Redemption wasn't finished when Ruth and Boaz went in the bedroom that finished Ruth that restored Ruth back to whatever Boaz had she didn't get Naomi's property she got what boas had right okay Boaz just did the type of redemption to let Naomi to get what she had lost right I understand that Ruth got Christ heirs and join HS it don't say that about Israel you and I are HS and join HS with Jesus Christ so when Ruth married Boaz that made them equal she got what Boaz had now Boaz was a mighty man but now no a no am it Naomi didn't get what Boaz had Naomi got restored what she lost which was what right of being a wife she got it restored now not complet to be restored to being where he took her as a wife too but at least she had the child and she had a she she was restored when that child was laid in her lap everything was put back together just like it was supposed to be cuz without that without Boaz neither one of these would have had anything right I mean without Jacob neither one of these wouldn't have had children because of the way the lineage was same with Boaz if Boaz and Ruth hadn't had their hadn't had that child give it to Naomi restored everything if we don't see Redemption this is my whole point if we don't see redemption in every dock doine in every word of this Bible if we don't see Redemption if we don't see redemption in all the prophets message then then we've missed it yep right if we don't see that God came from way back in his mind to redeem man you me Israel the Sinners everybody and this Bible shows you a pathway back to full restoration be it Jews or Gentiles Jews or Gentiles names you know we just use we use names as types but you know put your name in there well no holding your hand up okay I was thinking now you know we talk about this today and it's all spiritual for us but those people carried children and gave them away sure absolutely first born and we talk y but that was was what was supposed to happen back then you raised up children for your brother if your brother died if I died Terence was supposed to go in with June and raise up a child but that child wouldn't be terence's that child would be mine right cuz she's raising it up in my name all right there a beautiful part to that but we ain't got time to get into that but thank you all for coming this morning we'll see how this turns out and we'll put it together next week I don't know what we'll do we may do this again a little more or we'll do something
