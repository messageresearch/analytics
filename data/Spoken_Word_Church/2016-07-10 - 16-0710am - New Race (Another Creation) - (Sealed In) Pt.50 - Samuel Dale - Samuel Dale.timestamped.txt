[24:10] you may be seated the Lord add his
[24:12] Blessing to the reading of the
[24:15] word now notice in the verse eight if
[24:19] these things be in you it doesn't just
[24:22] mean that it doesn't just stop on that
[24:25] is these things be in you and of bound
[24:28] right if they're just there as something
[24:32] to be and you know we got it and thing
[24:34] uh that's not you know heaped up piled
[24:37] up in other words uh increasing because
[24:41] that's what we
[24:42] want we're not in the days of mankind of
[24:45] down through time that has just been
[24:48] satisfied with going to church and and
[24:51] doing good and things like that that's
[24:53] part of it that's wonderful but we're in
[24:56] the day when God God is requiring that
[24:59] we come to a place that even These Old
[25:02] Vile bodies will be changed am and
[25:05] they'll be a Rapture to take us to Glory
[25:08] all right and see mankind has never been
[25:10] responsible for that we read it there
[25:12] the other day it's in Statue of perfect
[25:14] man brother Brown referring to the ages
[25:16] and he said these are not required what
[25:19] these are required see there wasn't
[25:21] required that down through th so they
[25:23] didn't teach it you know it it's always
[25:26] been to me is to look at things you know
[25:30] by way of the Prophet Messenger to think
[25:32] about it and see back in the age of uh
[25:35] say uh Wesley for instance to show you
[25:38] how the relationship of an age does with
[25:41] each one of us and works you know in the
[25:44] days of Wesley it was sanctification
[25:46] right and you know that was when all of
[25:48] your songs was written about the blood I
[25:51] mean not all but the basics a large
[25:54] portion of your songs that are Rel
[25:56] written related to the blood of Jesus
[25:58] Christ was in that day through you know
[26:02] uh what was his name not Char but uh
[26:04] John Wesley's brother Charles yeah all
[26:07] and many of those because that was the
[26:10] pull of the time that was the hour for
[26:14] that right all right but we're not in
[26:17] that hour we're in an hour when all
[26:20] things is coming to an end and all right
[26:23] and doing that then it's bringing us to
[26:26] a different thoughts
[26:28] or level of thinking but it's the same
[26:31] thing they had Christ we have
[26:34] Christ you think about even we say well
[26:37] well they didn't believe like we believe
[26:38] no but they had Christ in their heart
[26:41] right the believing was responsible for
[26:43] the word of the age or time that they
[26:46] were living all right but they had
[26:49] Christ in their life he was that to them
[26:52] and they sung about him and worshiped
[26:54] him and and praised him all the way down
[26:56] to that because we we we've made an
[26:58] emphasis heavily on what that it's been
[27:00] the Holy Ghost in every
[27:03] age all right every age had that Holy
[27:06] Spirit but it's according to it was not
[27:09] the holy spirit that was taken away
[27:11] that's right see that's what we think
[27:13] about it's not it was the word that was
[27:15] taken away all right but the Holy Spirit
[27:18] can only work according to the amount of
[27:20] word that you
[27:23] have right that's so but we're in the
[27:25] end time when all of the word has come
[27:27] forth amen right right so then the word
[27:31] is here it's available right well then
[27:34] we are
[27:36] required to believe all the word and try
[27:39] to walk into it in the age that we're
[27:42] living and then what is it they without
[27:45] us cannot be made perfect so they're
[27:48] waiting on you and I to come to that
[27:50] place all right we've been through a lot
[27:52] of the things talking
[27:54] about you know the these virtues and
[27:58] things and I have just a thought
[28:01] today I I want to get across because
[28:04] it's it's uh it deals with the entire
[28:09] body of Christ and we will eventually
[28:11] come back to studying or bring it in the
[28:14] church ages and show how each Church age
[28:17] I was looking at a quote this morning
[28:19] there where brother Brandon was talking
[28:21] about Peter and you know like
[28:23] illustrating Peter you were this it but
[28:25] he said Peter said you was a stone you
[28:28] know right he said but said I honed you
[28:31] done you fixed you to put you in all
[28:33] right do you realize we are the stones
[28:36] amen that's right you're looking at the
[28:37] pyramid that's you you want a picture of
[28:41] you then there's a picture of you
[28:43] standing
[28:44] there first as an
[28:47] individual that's right but then as to
[28:50] the part of the age that you're living
[28:52] as the church being made into uh
[28:56] manifestation for the time time so he
[28:57] said Peter said I honed you right amen
[29:01] and he said then I see manage you in
[29:04] well that's what we're going to talk
[29:05] about today and so don't go I try to
[29:08] caution you not to run off on I know
[29:11] that the stones in the natural pyramid
[29:13] are not cemented together I read too you
[29:15] know it's not cemented together they
[29:18] were sitting so and hone so until they
[29:20] sit on each other but that's not so in
[29:23] the Statue of perfect man right amen
[29:25] that's right now you're going to see
[29:26] that I hope to today why that the
[29:29] prophet would draw the drawing remember
[29:32] how I kept mentioning
[29:33] it that how that he would draw the
[29:37] drawing Peter would list Faith virtue
[29:39] knowledge Temperance patience godliness
[29:42] brotherly kindness you know and then the
[29:44] love of God all right but when brother
[29:47] brandom draws the drawing he goes
[29:49] through faith virtue knowledge
[29:51] Temperance patience godliness brotherly
[29:53] kindness and then he cuts that off and
[29:55] brings it down and then he talks about
[29:57] the Holy
[29:59] Spirit and then he goes into love well
[30:03] we'll get to that this afternoon to
[30:04] where we'll be bringing in number-wise
[30:07] because to me it's very very
[30:11] um needful to understand where we're at
[30:15] am if we're going to talk about the age
[30:17] we live in we need to understand where
[30:19] we're at all right and how everything
[30:21] comes and where the messenger comes in
[30:23] at and how that where it is it'll fit in
[30:26] to show showing us the very person cuz
[30:30] we got to look at the person as being
[30:32] built into the statue of perfect man but
[30:34] we've also got to look at the church all
[30:37] the way through as it's coming forth so
[30:40] all right then now what we're getting to
[30:43] see we've talked about how there's each
[30:46] one of these
[30:47] virtues you know and we talked about
[30:50] that faith is not a
[30:52] virtue faith is a
[30:54] birth all right it doesn't say add
[30:59] faith it says have faith the prophet
[31:02] said and be born again he said now
[31:05] you're laying the foundation right all
[31:08] right see then that's the Holy Spirit
[31:11] right amen and the day you receive now
[31:14] watch it when we get to it with a
[31:16] drawing if we can emphasize it a little
[31:18] see the day that you receive the Holy
[31:22] Spirit you receive that Holy Spirit as a
[31:25] babe right amen Desiring the sincere
[31:28] milk to grow th by Etc all right and
[31:31] being a babe in Christ sure we have the
[31:36] parts the baby's got all the
[31:38] parts if it grows parts that's un un you
[31:42] know not according to the correct thing
[31:44] a baby has departs when it's brought
[31:47] into the world all right now but it
[31:49] doesn't have the
[31:51] virtues to be able to manifest
[31:56] itself and as into life it grows into
[32:00] that naturally talking and as we teach
[32:03] them they grow into those things all
[32:05] right but in spiritual
[32:07] speaking the new birth brings it and God
[32:11] gives you the
[32:12] seal to seal you in in the holy spirit
[32:17] all right now but see then you'll come
[32:20] on down through time and then you'll see
[32:23] the prophet talking about this is sealed
[32:25] in and this is in this is burn in
[32:27] whatever he's trying to express the
[32:30] Christian life amen right as to see what
[32:34] God is requiring for you and I am all
[32:38] right see then it's not to just talk
[32:41] about these
[32:43] things is to be they must come into
[32:46] manifestation or we're going to be like
[32:48] everybody else we're going by the grave
[32:50] you say why are we going by the gra
[32:51] because we're not coming to because your
[32:54] prophets when it said it he said I see
[32:56] only one thing
[32:57] holding off the coming of the Lord he
[33:00] said that's the Readiness of the bride
[33:02] all right so that's our problem we've
[33:04] had 50 years since the prophet left the
[33:08] scene to study the message one
[33:13] message in these 2,000 swing offs
[33:17] and doctrines and ideas of the people of
[33:20] the message you know but that's not no
[33:23] problem because we've had ever since the
[33:26] Bible coming this way a couple hundred
[33:28] years you know into the paperbacks and
[33:30] the different things and coming down
[33:32] through the Scrolls we've had the Bible
[33:34] along
[33:35] time and look at all of the world try to
[33:39] you know split over one Bible until they
[33:42] won't even associate with each
[33:44] other right and why you get down to it
[33:47] oh yeah well there's going to be a
[33:48] little group over here in heaven and a
[33:50] little group over here and little group
[33:51] over here I guess we're going to be like
[33:53] downtown Atlanta you can go down there
[33:55] and you got this group here that it's
[33:57] French and this one's German and this
[33:59] one's Chinese and and they don't
[34:01] associate with each other you know they
[34:03] kill each other if they cross the lines
[34:05] you know but I guess that's way it's
[34:07] going to be in heaven well I I don't
[34:09] think so I think that idea is going to
[34:11] be somewhere else all right they're
[34:13] going to be tied up somewhere else
[34:15] they're going to be together all right
[34:16] but it'll be somewhere else all right
[34:19] trying to think about these things that
[34:22] are required in this
[34:25] day down through time it wasn't required
[34:30] to do this or that or the other but now
[34:33] it's a
[34:34] requirement all right so then like I
[34:37] said why would we have anything else to
[34:40] study about when we can take the
[34:43] prophet's message and and the things and
[34:46] I've taught you from day one the Lord
[34:48] revealing it to me back in the 80s there
[34:51] of the fact of saying that it's through
[34:54] the opening of the word that God will
[34:56] bring these virtues into you and I all
[34:59] right then if we don't study the word
[35:01] and make oursel available whose fault is
[35:04] it right right see this that's plain
[35:08] language but it's it's set to that point
[35:11] but now watch it
[35:13] today see there's a difference in just
[35:16] talking about something and it actually
[35:19] being sealed into
[35:21] you in talking about it the prophet gave
[35:24] it Blasphemous names and stature of
[35:26] perfect man both he said that people
[35:28] have a portion of these
[35:31] virtues and not even born again that's
[35:33] right right all right see then you can
[35:37] house some of these things in your
[35:39] life
[35:41] that listen one person standing there
[35:44] without Christ manifesting something
[35:47] that the other person stands over here
[35:49] with
[35:51] Christ and they're not manifesting it
[35:55] right right you you see what I'm talking
[35:57] about some people with just natural
[36:00] virtues they have natural Temperance
[36:04] patience and you know brotherly kindness
[36:06] and here's a Christian on the other side
[36:09] struggling to try to come to those
[36:14] things right see it's not to just well
[36:18] you know you just don't understand we're
[36:20] in the body of Christ well you're sealed
[36:22] into the body of Christ by the baptism
[36:25] of the Holy Ghost we'll get to that in a
[36:27] minute but that's what we want to talk
[36:29] about because remember in the Statue of
[36:31] a perfect man and it's in Blasphemous
[36:33] names that brother brand mentions cement
[36:37] or cementing into these things are
[36:41] Vulcanizing and and really Vulcanizing
[36:44] is better than talking about cement cuz
[36:46] cement implies to us come up you know
[36:50] you put a little cement then you put
[36:51] another block put cement put another
[36:53] block but to
[36:55] vulcanize is a different different
[36:56] wording and that's what we want to use
[36:59] because Vulcanizing means that you take
[37:01] it into like a patch on a
[37:04] tube lot of you don't even know there
[37:06] was the word vulcanize you don't even
[37:08] know that the that the tires was like
[37:10] that but some of us are old enough to
[37:13] remember that when you had a flat you
[37:17] could take a bicycle patch and you could
[37:18] stick it on there well you might get to
[37:21] where you're going but let that thing
[37:23] get a little bit hot and it was going to
[37:24] peel off you going to have a flat but
[37:26] they had a thing called a Vulcanizing
[37:28] outfit that you took it you put it on
[37:31] there and it had this patch and you I
[37:33] saw one the other day laying somewhere
[37:35] and picked it up and you lay it down
[37:37] over the hole and you screw this thing
[37:39] down and you know then you it's got
[37:41] material in there and you set it on
[37:45] fire and that thing will burn you know
[37:49] and what it does it burns that patch and
[37:52] Tube or melts them together right all
[37:56] right it will hold real good well now
[37:58] that's what God is trying to
[38:00] do y to his bride am okay is trying to
[38:06] bring forth these
[38:08] virtues through his
[38:10] church all right and then to vulcanize
[38:15] them together and remember now you don't
[38:18] vulcanize rubber to metal that's right
[38:21] it's got to be the same material so now
[38:24] in the Statue of a perfect man
[38:27] every one of those materials has got to
[38:29] be the same right it's
[38:33] Godly Faith Godly knowledge Godly
[38:38] Temperance Godly Faith all of it is
[38:40] Godly it's not just because that we can
[38:43] do sure we can have as I said some of
[38:46] those things we can have them and not
[38:49] even be born again well truly you can
[38:51] say well you know I I here I have the
[38:54] new birth do you think that that these
[38:57] things here that I could have some of
[38:58] these other things
[39:01] yes why because that's the only natural
[39:04] that's what I've tried to explain it's
[39:06] only natural to have some of these
[39:07] things pulling us because if you don't
[39:10] get nothing out of the message while
[39:11] everybody's waking enough get
[39:15] this all right get
[39:19] this I
[39:21] thought that we
[39:24] believed that to look at the pyramid and
[39:27] see it and we see the lies which is
[39:31] love I sure when you're born again you
[39:33] have
[39:35] love right but let's call it baby
[39:40] love you you have those things and love
[39:43] now watch this is where that I've always
[39:45] tried to explain something to
[39:48] you that headstone that Capstone that
[39:51] love we talk about is pulling
[39:54] us from the day in any born again
[39:58] Christian amen are you following me any
[40:01] are ever born again
[40:06] Christian that love is above pulling us
[40:11] cuz that's the
[40:14] positive it's not negative like this is
[40:17] negative that would be Rubber and this
[40:19] is positive would be metal see not that
[40:21] way it's partial realization when you're
[40:25] born again right cuz that's your
[40:28] earnest what's pulling
[40:32] you have you ever thought about ever
[40:35] person is being pulled by God to
[40:40] upwardly into a Christian Life I got a
[40:43] quote L here where brother Brown said
[40:45] you either have a downward
[40:48] pull which that's what we born with
[40:51] right he said are we have an upward pull
[40:55] right all right
[40:57] so that's why I've always tried to teach
[40:58] you it's the word of prophet and what he
[41:01] said it's your soul is your
[41:04] theophany no mine's up
[41:09] there mine's up under beyond the curtain
[41:12] well no I ain't I'm page 80 of the
[41:16] Hebrew Book what your Prophet said your
[41:19] soul is you the now I didn't argue you
[41:21] going to argue with
[41:23] him well can't you see the positive is
[41:26] pulling
[41:30] you do you realize there's a change of
[41:33] of a body for
[41:34] somebody right we have a choice of those
[41:38] things that's right but there's a day
[41:40] that'll pull somebody right into that
[41:43] change do you realize in God that's
[41:45] already
[41:46] there you realize in God the Eternal
[41:49] life that you have by the new birth is
[41:52] just as powerful as the very God of
[41:54] glory amen that's right amen it's just
[41:58] brought to us as a new
[42:00] birth he's pulling
[42:02] us the day you're born again God starts
[42:06] pulling
[42:07] us well watch it through the
[42:10] pyramid once he gives you the new birth
[42:12] he's pulling you
[42:14] this
[42:17] right is in this right
[42:20] place right that's right hey we see
[42:24] somebody come in the door back there
[42:27] that we ain't seen in a long time as
[42:32] sis okay everybody turn
[42:38] around there sister or
[42:43] everybody's come everybody you know
[42:45] matter what who he talking about who he
[42:48] okay all right good to see you say
[42:50] where's the boy he rambling with
[42:53] you oh he's back here okay okay am yeah
[42:57] all right but see talking about
[43:01] now see when you get the new birth you
[43:03] get it as a baby
[43:06] amen but God wants us to grow up that's
[43:09] right amen and wanting us to grow up
[43:12] he's drawing us upward right he's
[43:16] drawing us to
[43:18] himself leave that love up there amen
[43:22] don't try to bring the the love down on
[43:25] to this it won't fit
[43:28] correctly come
[43:30] on leave it alone just fill the sides in
[43:35] now you going I hope you'll find that
[43:36] out in a minute about the Holy Spirit
[43:38] and what it does all right but you see
[43:42] each one of these virtues then as
[43:45] they're brought
[43:48] forth by the opening of the word to you
[43:52] it brings God's virtue it brings God's
[43:54] knowledge amen right see all right
[43:58] brings the temperance hey brother
[44:01] or we got a whole family okay all
[44:05] right I might not to recall his name let
[44:08] go around the world he'll be mad at me
[44:10] to get
[44:12] through okay but
[44:16] listen
[44:18] now as each thing these virtues are
[44:22] required on the stature of a perfect man
[44:24] that's right not just written out there
[44:27] to look at something to be good but it's
[44:32] required for you and I and now remember
[44:34] why we was teaching
[44:36] because not to lose some but to go on
[44:39] see Peter
[44:42] says to those that have obtained like
[44:45] Precious
[44:46] Faith all right I believe and I've
[44:49] always taught it since I heard the
[44:50] prophet's message that you're born again
[44:53] at Faith amen right right
[44:57] you say yeah but I was born up here cuz
[44:59] this is my age well boy you sure left
[45:02] off a lot of
[45:06] God I don't want it that way amen I
[45:10] believe every Born Again
[45:14] believer is born again at
[45:16] Faith that's the new birth that's why
[45:19] it's not an ad it's a birth a baby that
[45:23] said it's birth the baby's birth
[45:26] yes but it doesn't have the virtues of a
[45:29] of an adult in
[45:31] manifestation it has everything dire to
[45:34] grow into that but it has to have the
[45:38] growth development and that is the
[45:40] Christian Life right and we were not
[45:42] taught that
[45:45] see to where that it's required that we
[45:49] study the message the Bible to mean see
[45:53] before these virtues can come into being
[45:56] all we got to do is to study the Bible
[45:58] and let God bring them into
[46:01] being see we had to have the message
[46:04] come that's right absolutely amen we had
[46:06] to have the end time to be here we we
[46:08] sure we talked about these things like
[46:11] we were talking about when you get to
[46:13] Godliness sure when I was in the Baptist
[46:15] Church I could look up
[46:17] words I knew that where it says Be You
[46:19] therefore for perfect had nothing to do
[46:22] with a sinless life it had to do with a
[46:25] grow
[46:26] development amen I could
[46:29] read all right but see we didn't think
[46:32] about that but then a prophet comes
[46:34] along he tells us these things hey wait
[46:37] a
[46:38] minute he's telling me that all I got to
[46:40] do is grow up in God and and you know as
[46:43] I grow up in God he keeps imparting to
[46:45] me and as he does then I'm the partaker
[46:48] of his divine
[46:50] nature not it's just because I was born
[46:52] here or i' born
[46:54] there no see you're you're throwing away
[46:57] your own opportunity of Christian growth
[47:02] development to you say yeah but but
[47:04] brother Dale said I was born right up
[47:06] here where the was up here where the
[47:07] Pentecostal was at where we could shout
[47:09] speak in tongues and all like that I
[47:11] said all well and
[47:12] good that's their
[47:15] age that's their
[47:19] time but see our time is the entire
[47:24] word amen what those people had is our
[47:28] our property too amen why can't we enjoy
[47:31] it okay let's get on a little
[47:35] bit see the prophet says that these
[47:39] these in the Statue of perfect man each
[47:41] one of these virtues has to be the same
[47:43] material to vulcanize it together right
[47:46] the old tires you put it on I'm in the
[47:49] tube you vulcanize it it become one with
[47:51] a tube if it didn't it pulled loose but
[47:53] if you heated it enough it become right
[47:55] all right that's what God does to you
[47:57] and I he's got his own heating out bit
[48:00] and he kind of puts us through it you
[48:03] say yeah but brother Dale I think I'm
[48:04] way up here well that's good if you got
[48:07] all this down here now what did your
[48:09] Prophet say I think I got three of them
[48:12] laying here what did he say if you're
[48:14] saying well I'm up
[48:16] here when this down here is not
[48:19] correct so you got to come up Faith
[48:23] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[48:26] amen but you said but I'm up here
[48:29] brotherly kindness what did your Prophet
[48:31] say he said Satan will try you I'm
[48:33] quoting brother brandom and he said
[48:35] that's where you'll
[48:39] crumble
[48:41] right so let's take an example brother
[48:44] Dale I'm just at Faith the new birth you
[48:47] know but I think I'm way up here at
[48:49] brotherly kindness when Satan tackles
[48:54] me
[48:56] are you
[48:57] listening I don't have God's
[49:02] virtue I don't have his knowledge I have
[49:05] head knowledge I don't have his
[49:08] Temperance I don't have his
[49:11] patience and even though I can talk
[49:13] about brotherly kindness I don't have it
[49:15] and he'll try me and what'll happen when
[49:17] he puts the pressure on crumble right
[49:20] you're going to fall back down to where
[49:21] you start at right CU remember now watch
[49:25] this if you don't get nothing El
[49:26] remember this if God seals something
[49:28] into you that will not crumble no that's
[49:31] right amen true but that's why you got
[49:33] to go up up up up being sealed in you
[49:36] can't just go up and say well I got
[49:38] brotherly kindness he just sealed that
[49:39] one in up here and then oh I'll get
[49:42] these other things one of these days now
[49:45] God ain't going to do that that's
[49:47] right CU if he did he'd said it here in
[49:51] Peter he said well some of you might get
[49:53] some brotherly kindness so hold on to
[49:55] that that it's sealed in but you no he's
[49:57] telling you you add to your
[50:03] faith
[50:05] virtue it's not your faith what is it
[50:08] it's God's faith given to you which is
[50:10] the New Birth the prophet said have
[50:13] faith and be born again he said you're
[50:15] laying the
[50:16] foundation now what the next one
[50:18] brotherly kindness no it's
[50:22] not see you're going to have to bring
[50:25] every thing in
[50:27] together and as I said a moment ago then
[50:30] let that that's pulling us
[50:33] sure all born again Believers come to
[50:36] Faith birth God's finished product of
[50:40] that individual is pulling that
[50:42] individual toward
[50:44] him
[50:46] right now come
[50:49] on but you see the people as I've always
[50:51] taught you what have I said for almost
[50:53] 50 years the biggest biggest portion of
[50:56] the people of this message are going to
[50:58] die and go by the grave Born Again
[51:03] Believers
[51:05] why I don't have to back up 40 or 50 40
[51:08] something years ago I taught you that
[51:11] right and looking at them now to see
[51:13] them I didn't mean they'd leave the
[51:15] message like they're doing now I just
[51:17] meant they're going to die and go by the
[51:18] grave all
[51:21] right but you look at them now man it
[51:23] just parting all over the place amen
[51:26] death is taking them amen
[51:28] right it's killing them but see I stood
[51:32] here and said that a long time ago so
[51:34] then I don't have to back up that's
[51:36] right see death is going to take us if
[51:40] we can't have the faith to be
[51:43] changed that's right it's not an
[51:45] automatic process we're waiting on the
[51:47] bus to pull
[51:51] up well I've always said this if you
[51:54] better remember one thing if you're
[51:55] waiting on a bus to pull up don't go
[51:57] down to the
[51:59] airport you know and getting ticket line
[52:02] you stand there waiting that's that's
[52:04] not the right place to go at least get
[52:06] where the bus depos at you know you got
[52:09] to get where the bus is going to run
[52:12] right all right see just trying to be
[52:14] part to what we're talking about but get
[52:16] a
[52:17] point all
[52:20] right remember when you receive the new
[52:23] birth according to the Bible Ephesians
[52:27] 4:30 that is the
[52:29] Seal of God that seals you into the body
[52:33] amen that's right all right that is the
[52:36] material we
[52:38] need all right that brings us into the
[52:42] body and seals Us
[52:44] in and it won't come apart then if we
[52:48] just wait and let him seal the next and
[52:49] seal the
[52:52] next right brother Brown said we need
[52:55] the cement of the Holy Spirit to stick
[52:59] all of this
[53:01] together all right now why would he call
[53:04] it cement of the Holy Spirit or that we
[53:07] are as we'll get to it later on in the
[53:10] message you realize the day you're born
[53:13] again you realize you're magnetized Amen
[53:17] to The Headstone sure
[53:21] that's come on headstones a magnet
[53:25] remember what he was explaining where he
[53:27] was in the place and working or seeing
[53:28] the guys working and you you welders you
[53:31] people that know you just take a magnet
[53:33] and you just run it over they sweep all
[53:35] of the shavings out where they grounded
[53:37] up and this magnet would come by and
[53:39] it'd just pick up all that metal you
[53:42] know how to sweep it he'll just pick it
[53:44] up they said well what about that piece
[53:47] said well that's
[53:49] aluminum so now it's not magnetized
[53:52] correctly amen for the the aluminum
[53:54] right we said well what about that piece
[53:57] that is metal he said it's bolded
[54:01] down see it won't come up all right see
[54:05] when you're born
[54:09] again right when you're born again then
[54:13] it magnetizes you all the way
[54:17] up it makes God pulling
[54:22] us it's hard to use the word negative to
[54:24] the people in the message they don't
[54:26] like it I don't have no problem saying
[54:27] negative to positive cuz I know a little
[54:30] bit about electrical wiring not not a
[54:33] lot but a little
[54:34] bit I know the ground wire on
[54:38] electricity is more vital than the
[54:41] positive yeah right you got a guy
[54:43] sitting back here that knows all about
[54:45] them things and can explain it to the
[54:47] letter but I got enough sense to know
[54:50] you can run all this room full of
[54:52] positive
[54:54] wires
[54:55] it won't bother a
[55:01] thing but then you take and ground
[55:04] it now you got
[55:07] it come on you ground it it'll work amen
[55:11] so the ground is a very great thing in
[55:13] God it is not just a negative it is a
[55:17] partial realization to bring us to a
[55:19] perfect realization all right see but
[55:23] it's got to be the same material now
[55:26] before it can be vulcanized together
[55:29] everybody understand that
[55:31] part it's got to be the same material
[55:34] all right then being the same
[55:38] material then watch the point if the
[55:41] holy spirit is the
[55:45] seal that seals you
[55:50] in now that's the same material right
[55:53] that's right
[55:55] so it's going to make you and I sealed
[55:58] in
[56:01] right by the new
[56:03] birth
[56:05] okay see that is the material of God so
[56:09] then anything else is going to have to
[56:11] be sealed or vulcanized to
[56:15] that and then it'll come forth in the
[56:18] right way cuz if it's not vulcanized it
[56:20] won't work so you can't make drawings we
[56:23] tried to settle down and and do the best
[56:26] we can
[56:29] but we tried to to do it go ahead
[56:32] brother Joe and pull up a little bit cuz
[56:33] I want you to to look at it of what I'm
[56:37] trying to say in the natural
[56:40] drawing while he's getting to that point
[56:43] remember the Holy Ghost comes down and
[56:46] seals you and I right now here's why
[56:50] your Prophet put that word Holy Spirit
[56:55] that's not in your Peter and his
[56:58] listings so then what does that make 1 2
[57:02] 3 4 5 6 7 8 nine
[57:08] things
[57:12] right now that's wrong
[57:16] number we'll get to it this evening
[57:18] there's only seven
[57:22] ads right you don't add the Holy Ghost
[57:26] that's right right right your Prophet
[57:29] knew exactly what he was talking about
[57:31] when he made the
[57:32] drawing that Holy
[57:34] Spirit is the same holy spirit all the
[57:37] way through and what is The Headstone
[57:39] the holy spirit amen that's right so
[57:40] look what your Prophet is bringing out
[57:42] now now it's the best we can do with a
[57:46] drawing when he gives you the new birth
[57:49] he seals you in that's
[57:53] right right yep amen he seals you
[57:57] in okay that can never be taken
[58:01] away cannot be
[58:03] destroyed cannot be anything done to it
[58:06] because that is the Seal of God Amen
[58:08] that's the new birth that's why brother
[58:09] R said have faith be born again all
[58:12] right but see virtue even though you've
[58:16] got a connection now if you're looking
[58:18] at the drawing don't think it's made
[58:21] incorrect you see this drawing is full
[58:24] of
[58:25] and this drawing is
[58:28] ful that was made for that amen all
[58:32] right in between is dotted lines
[58:34] representing that it's can be working
[58:37] but not there the way that it needs to
[58:40] be that's right all right but this is
[58:43] sealed when he gives you the Holy Spirit
[58:46] you don't leave a gap up at the top
[58:48] right
[58:50] amen but
[58:52] this is already SE SE amen yes that is
[58:56] The Headstone am that is the seal as
[58:59] when we'll get to
[59:01] it but we don't want to drop it down we
[59:04] just want to let the prophet be the
[59:05] answer amen all right so watch
[59:09] now as these virtues come forth into
[59:13] you blem his name and a statue of
[59:15] perfect man he seals them
[59:19] in right now get to the next draw and
[59:23] then you'll see what I'm talking about
[59:24] you see this drawing now has virtue
[59:27] already sealed
[59:29] in see before you didn't have it sealed
[59:32] in knowledge is are here it's not sealed
[59:35] in that's
[59:37] right anything in between in here
[59:40] messing up can crumble these but it
[59:43] cannot crumble
[59:46] this the new birth cannot be crumbled
[59:49] amen amen that's right faith cannot be
[59:51] crumbled it is sealed amen into
[59:56] you there's not a Gap open that Satan
[1:00:00] can get in you better remember what your
[1:00:01] Prophet what did he
[1:00:04] say he said you're sealed in he's sealed
[1:00:08] out said if You' done this that or de
[1:00:11] what did he say he said you went out to
[1:00:13] him he can't get into you now how do you
[1:00:17] go out to the Devil with the body and
[1:00:19] spirit you can't go out with your soul
[1:00:21] because it's born
[1:00:22] again it's sealed in all right but you
[1:00:26] get what I'm saying see when you come
[1:00:28] forth with
[1:00:30] virtue and it's sealed
[1:00:33] in there's no way to crumble
[1:00:39] this do you understand then what we're
[1:00:41] trying to illustrate see once knowledge
[1:00:43] comes in we only done one or two yeah he
[1:00:46] did do knowledge okay once knowledge
[1:00:48] comes in it's sealed in see that's not
[1:00:51] head
[1:00:52] knowledge that is not just virtues of
[1:00:55] being a Christian and being good what
[1:00:58] did the prophet say virtue is
[1:01:01] strength well now watch him the strength
[1:01:04] of all of
[1:01:07] this so now brother around not just
[1:01:09] talking about this kind of strength
[1:01:12] right Jesus had these virtues
[1:01:16] right he had the strength his this is
[1:01:19] the strength he said of all of this
[1:01:22] y once you fill this all the way up and
[1:01:26] making those
[1:01:28] sides there's no way Satan can get to
[1:01:32] it now we'll get up here to where we got
[1:01:34] to come into the age that we're living
[1:01:36] in sure we'll get the ages to go with it
[1:01:40] but individuals has to come up well
[1:01:42] where am I at brother Dale that's your
[1:01:44] choice that's
[1:01:45] right I cannot tell you where you are at
[1:01:50] right right and it don't do no good if
[1:01:53] you tell you where I'm at
[1:01:56] out cuz that ain't going to do nothing
[1:01:58] but a help to you to realize that this
[1:02:01] can be this or that can be and there is
[1:02:03] hop for all of
[1:02:05] us remember God is the one that seals
[1:02:07] these things in right thank Lord when I
[1:02:11] got that knowledge it just yeah if it
[1:02:13] was the right knowledge right remember
[1:02:16] this material and this material and this
[1:02:18] material is the
[1:02:22] same up in here you can question about
[1:02:25] it he's got one line already pulled up
[1:02:27] to
[1:02:28] Temperance as long as you see that solid
[1:02:30] line is reference in what I want you to
[1:02:33] see is that it's sealed
[1:02:37] in it's sealed in if it's a solid line
[1:02:41] why because that's why your Prophet put
[1:02:44] the Holy Spirit right here that's
[1:02:50] right right come on Peter said Faith
[1:02:53] virtue knowledge temperation Godly his
[1:02:55] brotherly kindness the love of
[1:02:58] God brother Brandon put Faith virtue
[1:03:00] knowledge tempation Godly his brotherly
[1:03:02] kindness Holy Spirit and then the love
[1:03:05] of God what's he trying to tell
[1:03:08] us I read you the last quote there from
[1:03:11] the
[1:03:12] prophet he said the Holy Ghost come in
[1:03:14] the Statue of a perfect man the holy
[1:03:16] ghost coming down through Christ Holy
[1:03:18] Spirit that's not two
[1:03:23] gods
[1:03:25] this is already sealed it don't have to
[1:03:28] be
[1:03:30] sealed these is what has to be
[1:03:37] sealed come on that's why the Rapture
[1:03:39] will take place in this
[1:03:42] age the seventh Church
[1:03:46] age now where do we get to the
[1:03:48] mathematics of this thing in this
[1:03:50] afternoon because you're going to
[1:03:53] see I I hope what we're talking about
[1:03:56] cuz there's eight things in that
[1:04:00] pyramid 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 you put the Holy
[1:04:04] Spirit here see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and
[1:04:09] there's
[1:04:10] eight that's eternal
[1:04:13] life we got to bring this thing to
[1:04:15] eternal life or there's going to be no
[1:04:16] Rapture that's
[1:04:17] right years ago back in the early
[1:04:21] 70s they were teaching an eighth day
[1:04:25] Day
[1:04:26] message that we was already in the
[1:04:29] eighth
[1:04:31] day that's where all of that come you
[1:04:34] know that go up under the Ohio River all
[1:04:37] of these things you know Millennium was
[1:04:39] already there all of that
[1:04:41] stuff people were saying I'm already in
[1:04:44] the eighth
[1:04:48] day I tried to teach it then that's way
[1:04:51] I teach it now when you're born again
[1:04:54] your soul is eternal right you know your
[1:04:58] soul is in an eight that's right but
[1:05:00] your body is still in a
[1:05:03] seven now this is what's going to be
[1:05:06] connecting later in the message you
[1:05:08] realize that the Millennium is still a
[1:05:11] seven that's right
[1:05:14] amen the world don't go into an eighth
[1:05:17] day until the future
[1:05:20] home the Millennium is still under a
[1:05:23] seven
[1:05:24] R said there'll be things in the
[1:05:26] Millennium that won't be in the future
[1:05:28] home why because that seven going into
[1:05:30] it but you and I have already stepped
[1:05:34] ahead by the new birth Amen in our soul
[1:05:39] it's Eternal but our body and our
[1:05:40] Spirits not right page 48 future home
[1:05:45] the soul is redeemed but you're waiting
[1:05:48] the Redemption of the body what's going
[1:05:50] to redeem this body well there's just
[1:05:52] going to be something out this there
[1:05:53] going to be brother so and so he he he
[1:05:55] yeah that's what you've
[1:05:56] done yeah I'm talking to the people of
[1:05:59] the message out there you
[1:06:01] too that you grab these things as they
[1:06:04] come along thinking it was going to be a
[1:06:05] great thing let a young man come along
[1:06:07] in the message and boy he's got this
[1:06:10] delivery he's got this going and
[1:06:11] everybody just flocks to
[1:06:13] him and there a while it just
[1:06:16] D you see them just fall away and go
[1:06:20] into some kind of an
[1:06:23] error
[1:06:25] what did your Prophet
[1:06:26] say he said you'll find scrap peaps of
[1:06:29] ministers and others he said piled along
[1:06:34] the
[1:06:35] way but everybody's looking for
[1:06:40] something now they're running to the
[1:06:43] Tabernacle I'm not throwing off none of
[1:06:45] my
[1:06:46] business now they're going to the
[1:06:48] Tabernacle why
[1:06:50] because Joseph is now pastor
[1:06:55] that's wonderful I no problems it's none
[1:06:58] of my
[1:06:59] business but I wasn't waiting on Joseph
[1:07:03] right I've Been Waiting on
[1:07:09] Jesus amen
[1:07:11] right why because listen these things
[1:07:16] have to be in us and
[1:07:19] sealed you realize you can't tear out
[1:07:22] none of this
[1:07:25] if it's sealed in and see that's why the
[1:07:27] Holy Spirit comes up seals you in holy
[1:07:30] spirit comes up and seal Holy Ghost
[1:07:31] comes up and seal you Holy Ghost comes
[1:07:33] up and seal that's why brother R and put
[1:07:35] the Holy Spirit where it was at on the
[1:07:37] drawing Peter didn't list
[1:07:40] it brother Ram told you how right that's
[1:07:44] now listen come
[1:07:46] on Peter brought the
[1:07:50] message and told how to get where he
[1:07:52] was
[1:07:54] come on your prophets when it said it
[1:07:56] the disciples had these virtues he list
[1:07:58] it right here these virtues he said but
[1:08:01] they didn't have the headstone he said
[1:08:03] hadn't come
[1:08:05] yet
[1:08:07] all see then Peter was telling you how
[1:08:09] to get where he
[1:08:11] was right here in this Holy Spirit and
[1:08:15] all of these things within him sealed in
[1:08:17] him
[1:08:20] amen he's trying to tell us how to get
[1:08:23] there but once we get
[1:08:25] there we
[1:08:27] still got a step to be made The
[1:08:31] Headstone has to unite with the body to
[1:08:33] bring a change amen it's your prophet's
[1:08:37] words all right but you see like I said
[1:08:41] 50 years of studying it we ought to at
[1:08:42] least know what the prophet said that's
[1:08:46] right you ought to know that I'm not
[1:08:48] just kidding when I say that brother
[1:08:50] randam said it the Bible said these
[1:08:52] things are sealed in amen and that's
[1:08:55] sealing Satan
[1:08:57] out but there's things that we need in
[1:09:00] here that are not there this holy spirit
[1:09:04] is the seal cuz if we could draw this on
[1:09:07] up I don't know where brother Joe's got
[1:09:08] it to where you can just keep pulling it
[1:09:09] on up now you get to where oh now you
[1:09:12] got the pyramid the way it's supposed to
[1:09:14] be don't take that Holy Spirit out
[1:09:18] right remember Sister Shepherd
[1:09:22] dream and Junior
[1:09:24] dream one of them calls it a flange in
[1:09:26] the top of the mountain the other one
[1:09:28] calls it a rock box so all we got to do
[1:09:32] is just fill this in make a rock box and
[1:09:35] let the Holy Spirit pour in and let it
[1:09:37] run down through these things and the
[1:09:39] head will
[1:09:41] unite the drawing's
[1:09:44] perfect it's not something to just talk
[1:09:46] about it's perfect but if those things
[1:09:49] are not sealed in
[1:09:51] us but get my point what's
[1:09:57] pulling what was pulling them
[1:10:00] disciples don't you think that Jesus
[1:10:03] Christ was The Headstone amen but why
[1:10:06] does it St that The Headstone was
[1:10:09] rejected hold them
[1:10:13] denomination was
[1:10:17] it I'll remind you there was only two of
[1:10:20] them Pharisees and Sadducees and a few
[1:10:22] herodians in the days of Peter now was
[1:10:26] it the denominations that fell
[1:10:28] away right I know I preached it right
[1:10:32] here and I know two brothers that did
[1:10:34] not like it period
[1:10:36] whatsoever brother brandham said the
[1:10:39] bride went to
[1:10:41] NAA and messed
[1:10:44] up oh they went down and they run back
[1:10:46] yeah they went down and they run back
[1:10:48] and brought a devil's Doctrine with
[1:10:50] them yeah but him disciple right the
[1:10:53] pure un adulter at word lasted four
[1:10:56] ages Luther come out with a trinitarian
[1:11:00] Doctrine I know the
[1:11:02] message you see that's what we think our
[1:11:05] ideas will put these things but it won't
[1:11:06] fit in the
[1:11:10] scripture why did Paul preach to those
[1:11:14] that had these things in the first

[1:12:57] talking about brother Dale I'm talking
[1:12:59] about each one of these has got to be
[1:13:04] cemented together and this is the cement
[1:13:07] right
[1:13:08] here this that runs over here and goes
[1:13:11] down is the holy spirit that's what
[1:13:14] cements it
[1:13:16] together we had the new birth that's
[1:13:18] fine you get the new birth but then when
[1:13:21] you not when you get not he don't go up
[1:13:24] and seal that in and leave a
[1:13:27] gap that's right it'll crumble I didn't
[1:13:30] write the book you read the
[1:13:35] prophet it'll
[1:13:38] crumble because that down under there be
[1:13:41] fool what it going to do you drop if you
[1:13:43] put brotherly kindness up and had it all
[1:13:44] sealed in well what happens in between
[1:13:47] it crumbles it goes down right
[1:13:51] no God don't do that that's right each
[1:13:55] one of these he says you're birth into
[1:13:59] this into this into this into this into
[1:14:01] this into this and see you'll be birthed
[1:14:03] into that that's right I didn't write
[1:14:05] the book re statue of perfect
[1:14:07] man but see most people don't know what
[1:14:09] he taught it CU they never read the book
[1:14:11] and don't listen to the
[1:14:13] tape we've had 50 years what's the
[1:14:16] matter with you oh brother D just an
[1:14:19] intellect well if my intellect has been
[1:14:21] 50 years holling it why happen to you
[1:14:25] that's right
[1:14:27] am at least there one thing I got the
[1:14:30] feel full of seed the Holy Spirit can
[1:14:33] Quicken it but if you don't have the
[1:14:35] seed in the field he can't Quicken
[1:14:37] nothing that's right that's right I'll
[1:14:40] take what I got if it's
[1:14:44] intellect cuz I'll wait on him and I
[1:14:46] know I can be waiting at the bus not
[1:14:48] down into
[1:14:51] airport whatever God wants to do it'll
[1:14:54] he'll come to that that he's SED that
[1:14:56] word down into
[1:14:58] you if you'll hold on that's
[1:15:01] right
[1:15:03] right do you get what I'm talking about
[1:15:07] yes The Headstone is pulling us when you
[1:15:11] got born again it was
[1:15:14] drawing as you come up far enough The
[1:15:17] Headstone nose to seal that
[1:15:22] in and he keeps drawing you pulling
[1:15:26] you and when we come up to Holy
[1:15:30] Spirit you don't have to draw it up you
[1:15:34] just seal in the sides let that Holy
[1:15:37] Spirit that's been doing all the sealing
[1:15:39] just seal the sides in now you got the
[1:15:41] whole thing cuz
[1:15:44] remember the prophet says this seals you
[1:15:47] in he said then The Headstone will come
[1:15:49] and seal the whole
[1:15:51] thing y don't you don't have to run
[1:15:54] another line down through here come on
[1:15:56] you don't have to run another line down
[1:15:57] beside this seal you just bring them two
[1:15:59] together and it's sealed that Holy
[1:16:02] Spirit is a seal that might not mean
[1:16:03] nothing to you or your thoughts but you
[1:16:06] ought to realize one thing it's not
[1:16:09] automatically put
[1:16:10] that being a Christian is not just
[1:16:13] something well I I've been a Christian
[1:16:15] what does he want me to do I I'm a good
[1:16:17] person I do this I do that praise the
[1:16:20] Lord the kindo priest has got you
[1:16:25] beat all
[1:16:28] right you don't believe in being good no
[1:16:31] don't believe in being good I've said
[1:16:33] that for 50 years I don't believe in
[1:16:35] being good I believe in being born
[1:16:38] again and that'll make you good then it
[1:16:42] won't be my ways of doing and my filthy
[1:16:49] righteousness cuz if he's there you
[1:16:51] ain't going to have no dirty
[1:16:55] it's his righteousness it's his faith
[1:16:58] it's his virtue it's his knowledge it's
[1:17:00] his temperence is his patience
[1:17:08] amen but you see the prophet gets over
[1:17:10] to the back of stature of a perfect man
[1:17:12] what does he
[1:17:14] say well I got all these things in here
[1:17:17] Lord now let's get this on the way he
[1:17:19] didn't say
[1:17:22] that
[1:17:24] he didn't say it when he's talking about
[1:17:26] virtue and says see there most of us is
[1:17:28] going to miss it to start
[1:17:30] with but but he he was he was up here he
[1:17:34] just was
[1:17:36] he why would he say when he gets over to
[1:17:38] the end of the statute of a perfect man
[1:17:40] he said fill me up
[1:17:42] Lord with this virtue this knowledge and
[1:17:45] Temperance and patience and he said that
[1:17:48] I may teach
[1:17:49] others Apostles prophets pastors and for
[1:17:52] the perfect ing or bringing these things
[1:17:54] into the body
[1:17:58] amen see the whole message is
[1:18:01] correct do you understand what I'm
[1:18:04] saying the day you was born again God
[1:18:07] was pulling
[1:18:08] you y you say well why didn't it do it
[1:18:11] because they didn't know how
[1:18:14] right this was lost this ability to
[1:18:19] bring these things forth was lost your
[1:18:22] early church had them yeah right come on
[1:18:27] sure the pure unadulterated word lasted
[1:18:30] for ages that's your Prophet saying it
[1:18:34] but then the word begin to die down what
[1:18:36] word this
[1:18:39] word the teachers begin to relax and
[1:18:43] well I think we're up here I think we're
[1:18:45] there I think we're over here I think
[1:18:48] we
[1:18:51] no you don't walk up to a baby and it
[1:18:54] laying down in a cradle and say well you
[1:18:56] know son I think you got
[1:19:00] patience he looks at you
[1:19:07] go
[1:19:09] right no you watch him
[1:19:12] grow and he gets
[1:19:15] patience when he's about 80 years
[1:19:20] old right
[1:19:23] somewhere between 70 and 80 you finally
[1:19:26] realize you've done live long enough
[1:19:29] that there ain't nothing you can do
[1:19:30] about it it ain't no turning back so you
[1:19:33] might as well settle down and forget
[1:19:36] it
[1:19:38] right like I've always said you don't
[1:19:41] you don't know how to raise kids until
[1:19:42] you've raised them and then they raise
[1:19:45] them you know you you have kids and you
[1:19:47] try to raise them and then they have
[1:19:50] kids and they try to raise
[1:19:51] them then you look at him and say boy I

[1:22:25] Hickory I brought it in the house I said
[1:22:28] here well they really couldn't
[1:22:30] understand it come old Doty old
[1:22:32] granddaddy loves everybody you know but
[1:22:35] I was trying to get her to see and let
[1:22:37] her raise you know what she turned out
[1:22:39] to be a good
[1:22:40] kid they didn't have to they didn't have
[1:22:42] to use that right sister or sister or
[1:22:46] used to have a spoon right back
[1:22:50] there and brother Gary at
[1:22:53] Atkins used to say if you want to follow
[1:22:57] the lord read your Bible and study if
[1:22:58] you want to learn how to raise kids go
[1:23:00] find sister
[1:23:02] or that was that was his
[1:23:06] statement she used that come on you know
[1:23:09] God has to do that to get us sometimes
[1:23:11] you say does he whoop us into these
[1:23:13] things well whatever you want to call
[1:23:15] it he's child training us that's right
[1:23:19] you you say well I need patience well
[1:23:22] you know we don't beat each other on the
[1:23:23] back but it is Right Said tribulation
[1:23:25] does work with patience you know but you
[1:23:29] understand what I'm getting
[1:23:31] at you see why the prophet put Holy
[1:23:34] Spirit right here because he didn't put
[1:23:37] down the head on the top of it this has
[1:23:39] got to be here cuz that headstone was
[1:23:42] rejected even the disciples didn't have
[1:23:45] it it was rejected Jesus Christ was the
[1:23:48] Chief
[1:23:50] Cornerstone come on listen listen Jesus
[1:23:54] preached six seals in Matthew 24 there's
[1:23:58] not one
[1:24:00] disciple mentions
[1:24:07] it oh Peter I one of them wrote it you
[1:24:10] know MTH yeah they wrote it but they
[1:24:12] didn't teach
[1:24:14] it Paul got the
[1:24:16] closest when he' call him the man of sin
[1:24:19] or
[1:24:20] something John learned on
[1:24:23] patmas about her
[1:24:28] Antichrist
[1:24:30] right none of them taught it why is it
[1:24:34] none of the disciples if you think the
[1:24:36] head came down there of all the thing
[1:24:39] why did not none of the disciples
[1:24:44] mention the son of
[1:24:49] man come on show it to me
[1:24:53] Paul I mean the disciples wrote about
[1:24:55] that's writing what Jesus
[1:24:58] said even Peter saying Paul says things
[1:25:01] hard to be understood that many wrestle
[1:25:04] to their destruction but Paul never
[1:25:06] mentioned son of
[1:25:13] man why because it would be the end time
[1:25:16] to be this Prophet that would bring it
[1:25:18] forth that was The Headstone they
[1:25:21] rejected Jesus
[1:25:23] preached six seals in Matthew 24 and he
[1:25:27] was the
[1:25:33] seventh
[1:25:35] see and they rejected
[1:25:40] it you know the reason they rejected it
[1:25:43] cuz they didn't know what it
[1:25:47] was right right they didn't know what it
[1:25:50] was they Ste it the god of
[1:25:55] glory and even the disciples could not
[1:25:59] understand him being that until the Holy
[1:26:02] Ghost came down on the day of Pentecost
[1:26:05] into their soul and gave them Eternal
[1:26:08] eye then they knew what Jesus was
[1:26:11] talking about but remember by the time
[1:26:14] he
[1:26:15] died it doesn't matter if they were
[1:26:17] writing it there was no way for those
[1:26:19] seals to be
[1:26:21] revealed
[1:26:23] there were to wait till the last days he
[1:26:26] said Brother D what are you making it
[1:26:28] making it what I always have for 50
[1:26:29] years this message the opening of those
[1:26:33] Seven
[1:26:34] Seals is The Headstone to the
[1:26:38] church now you show me something else it
[1:26:44] is it's got to be a
[1:26:46] message but see they turned down that
[1:26:50] hedone well that was just a other man no
[1:26:53] the disciples is because they didn't
[1:26:54] know what it
[1:26:57] was come on the biggest portion of
[1:26:59] people this message is turning this
[1:27:00] message down because they don't know
[1:27:02] what it is that's
[1:27:05] right that's right they can quoty
[1:27:11] things but where are they teaching the
[1:27:13] people now that we need these
[1:27:15] virtues oh that's way back under brother
[1:27:18] that's way
[1:27:21] behind
[1:27:25] why is it that the headstone is not
[1:27:27] United with the church
[1:27:33] amen oh of course there's a lot of
[1:27:35] people in this message says it
[1:27:39] has you want me to call names or just
[1:27:41] leave it alone and tell you is what some
[1:27:42] people don't a lot of people talk
[1:27:46] polygamy as to be the great Revelation
[1:27:49] under the seventh seal
[1:27:57] I'm too old
[1:27:59] folks I still got a decent memory that I
[1:28:01] know where all those things come
[1:28:05] from but you ought to know it's
[1:28:07] true right that's why it's so messed up
[1:28:10] in the message the way it
[1:28:12] is because it don't people don't know
[1:28:14] what to believe that's right amen well
[1:28:17] that brother he he he he walked with a
[1:28:19] prophet he hunted with him he he
[1:28:21] fellowshipped with him
[1:28:25] praise God I wish I could have been had
[1:28:27] the ability to
[1:28:28] do but you know
[1:28:30] what the Bible tells me a great
[1:28:34] honor come on
[1:28:35] musicians you know what I consider a
[1:28:37] great
[1:28:40] honor the Bible says
[1:28:44] that those who
[1:28:46] believe without having to
[1:28:48] see are greater than those who believe
[1:28:52] because they
[1:28:54] see that's the
[1:28:56] Bible
[1:28:59] right you mean it's a great honor it's a
[1:29:03] great honor to be able to believe God
[1:29:05] that you didn't have to
[1:29:12] see that's right especially they that
[1:29:16] what believe and have not
[1:29:20] seen we've got people among us that saw
[1:29:24] the
[1:29:25] prophet and the healings and the signs
[1:29:27] and the Wonders thank God for that I
[1:29:32] consider that an honor and a pleasure to
[1:29:35] associate with people who walked with
[1:29:37] the
[1:29:38] prophet but that's what I told Brother
[1:29:40] Mo when he began to tell me about a
[1:29:41] prophet I said
[1:29:43] listen you saw the dead raise the sick
[1:29:45] healed and the things but I said I
[1:29:48] wasn't there but I said you tell me what
[1:29:51] he taught in the word and I'll tell you
[1:29:54] whether he was a prophet or
[1:29:58] not I can't look at the signs and
[1:30:00] wonders
[1:30:02] and and call it but I can
[1:30:06] look at the word right amen that was
[1:30:09] brought by the man Y and I can see like
[1:30:13] my wife said one day she said if if all
[1:30:15] those things happen he's talking about
[1:30:17] we listening to T she said he must have
[1:30:20] been a prophet
[1:30:22] will you know that's
[1:30:24] true what about you let's
[1:30:27] stand think on these things now and
[1:30:29] watch it this
[1:30:32] afternoon when you will see that we're
[1:30:34] not going to take that Holy Spirit
[1:30:37] out but we're not going to count it as
[1:30:39] eight things because this seal is this
[1:30:43] right here and that right there that is
[1:30:47] the
[1:30:49] seal amen that's why there's eight
[1:30:52] things
[1:30:55] there amen come
[1:30:57] on the holy spirit's not a ninth One
[1:31:01] Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[1:31:02] patience Godly brother kind and love
[1:31:04] that's eight
[1:31:08] things but there's only seven ads right
[1:31:12] what a wonderful
[1:31:13] point you know
[1:31:16] what there are seven Church
[1:31:20] ages right
[1:31:22] but there's eight manifestations of God
[1:31:25] through the seven Church
[1:31:27] ages or else we've missed it
[1:31:31] all your Prophet is Right am he knew
[1:31:35] what he was talking
[1:31:36] about that's right it's not just numbers
[1:31:39] wise and things to try to show you how
