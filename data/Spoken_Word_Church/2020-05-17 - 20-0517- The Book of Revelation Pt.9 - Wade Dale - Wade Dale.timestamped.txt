[0:00] all right ladies mother come in instead
[0:05] around we've got social distancing going
[0:08] on except for the younger people in the
[0:09] back y'all are immune to everything yeah
[0:17] this yeah anyway all right we're on the
[0:23] church ages and we're at we've been in
[0:24] the last church age so this is one we're
[0:28] living in so we see all this happening
[0:31] literally at the moment we see it
[0:35] happening that now we're looking at a
[0:38] sequence where Jesus said he said I know
[0:40] thy works that thou art neither cold nor
[0:41] hot he would that you either be colder
[0:45] hunt when we see now that the lukewarm
[0:46] people being brother Chris alone were
[0:50] discussing this about this modest thing
[0:53] and it really does if the biased thing
[0:54] has done what I said before it's really
[0:56] show dude get up he's got it and don't
[0:59] die and and you can't help it but if you
[1:05] don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:07] you go run scared yeah turn that almost
[1:09] like you've got a right scared so that's
[1:13] another thing I thought the day about we
[1:14] need to put that air conditioner in that
[1:16] window before some of them if you don't
[1:19] it's gonna be hot back here for 20 years
[1:24] yeah but we've been sweating it but if
[1:26] you put that out it'll it'll
[1:27] dehumidifier back though the walls so
[1:30] it'll take care of both things
[1:33] somebody I do it with we can buy
[1:36] somebody does but they wants to buy do
[1:38] it - that's but they have such a poor
[1:42] mr. Schue okay we have a lot of
[1:48] suggestions nobody
[1:52] let's just remember sister Barbara's on
[1:54] her way to church and her car backing up
[1:55] a little bit so it's gonna make mention
[1:58] any prayer says unto the Angel of the
[2:01] Church of the Laodiceans write these
[2:03] things saith the Amen the faithful and
[2:05] true witness the beginning of the
[2:07] creation of God now why is it saying the
[2:10] beginning of the creation of God as we
[2:14] were talking about the talk a little
[2:16] more about the two and a half tribes in
[2:21] your tights you see that the Holy Ghost
[2:23] came hold the dead Pentecost back in the
[2:27] book of Acts not 1906 but all the way
[2:29] back and it came to a group of people
[2:33] and that was truly the beginning of the
[2:37] creation of God in that point but what
[2:40] happened during the church ages
[2:41] is that the word lost is the fact by a
[2:45] man's tradition and by all these things
[2:47] that come up in the history that kind of
[2:52] deluded you can't it's like I think
[2:55] about this morning you know Bill Graham
[2:56] said the Holy Ghost was a timid person
[2:58] so he just kind of was like okay this is
[3:00] what you're going to believe then you
[3:02] know we just have to go with it he knew
[3:03] that and he made provision for Luther
[3:06] and Wesley to get their inheritance but
[3:09] they come back on this side of Jordan
[3:11] which wasn't the full inheritance which
[3:13] is what the statue of a perfect man the
[3:16] adoption that here you hand the
[3:19] headstone the headstone was over here in
[3:22] the placement land not over here in on
[3:25] this side Jordan right Christ the
[3:30] headstone which is right here yeah they
[3:33] didn't get it down here they got the
[3:35] cornerstone Bible even telling us they
[3:37] get the cornerstone which is the chief
[3:39] in stone but they got him in a little
[3:40] small portion all these Church ages
[3:43] consent before the first church age with
[3:45] a powerful church age though they had to
[3:47] pure unadulterated Word of God for three
[3:49] church ages so there was no
[3:52] denominational churches but there were
[3:54] denominational ideas so there wasn't an
[3:56] ama national spirit because like program
[4:00] said send the Holy Spirit came on the
[4:02] earth the other fare came on the air you
[4:04] know Judas in Jesus twins than ever
[4:07] reliable even on the day of Pentecost
[4:10] 1906 and Lu the street died came on the
[4:12] scene and then I was talking to a man
[4:15] last night a nominal preacher we got
[4:16] some beads out of a recliner but on the
[4:21] back porch it was very easy to get so
[4:24] he's have known the preacher and he was
[4:26] asking me about you know about what I
[4:29] thought about did God create this virus
[4:31] I said no I can't create a virus but
[4:35] Satan can take something in perverted
[4:37] and God can allow it well God will allow
[4:39] down through the turf changes he allowed
[4:42] because he had already said the corn a
[4:44] week was going in the ground so it
[4:45] hadn't gone the ground subway and once
[4:48] when it went in the ground it went in
[4:50] the ground because of the dark ages but
[4:55] now what did he promise I will restore
[4:57] the years that the four that's why that
[5:00] four is so important why that's being on
[5:04] brother the elements be going on forever
[5:06] in and a lot of people miss that because
[5:08] you say well I only goes I'm done well
[5:12] that's not just the holy up and you're
[5:15] done
[5:16] this is God in human flesh not miss it
[5:19] in this age don't see this is not right
[5:22] go ahead
[5:22] this wasn't commanded in any other ad
[5:25] now what happened was in the beginning
[5:28] in the beginning I'm talking about way
[5:31] back before time in the beginning God
[5:35] had this plan it was a perfect plan and
[5:37] he was gonna see it executed that's what
[5:39] program said on Christ amidst regard
[5:42] revealed me a plan of the firm
[5:44] he's going to see achieve but he had to
[5:47] allow all this to happen he had to allow
[5:50] this violence to happen he had to allow
[5:52] in 1906 comes Azusa Street him right
[5:55] after that from 1906 man the brothers
[5:57] were talking about he he realized 1906
[6:00] 22 straight now they were about to
[6:01] finish off the revival but what happened
[6:05] was they didn't see that the bug started
[6:12] eating right then and here you got world
[6:15] war what happened was it's they rejected
[6:18] the 1906 Azusa Street movement I said
[6:22] this other 9:30
[6:23] Azusa Street revival they rejected that
[6:25] revival god-sent played war and play
[6:31] what brother Graham say he said God
[6:33] sends a messenger on the scene preaches
[6:37] his message and as soon as he comes on
[6:39] the saying God puts and he leaves this
[6:41] thing God puts a plague on the earth
[6:42] right so it's exactly what's happening
[6:47] now the way I see it is is that the true
[6:51] seed is going to have to be hung up on
[6:54] the tour ladder than just being over
[6:57] here in the part of the promised land
[6:58] cuz we'll talk about a little bit more
[6:59] today that we didn't get into last week
[7:01] last Wednesday whatever was that this
[7:08] was not and the promised land
[7:11] but it was part of the Promised Land the
[7:14] Promised Land was crossed door but they
[7:18] had to fight over here but who gave them
[7:19] that land that's important Moses gave
[7:23] them that land Moses gabled that land
[7:25] before he died but Moses said in so many
[7:30] works he didn't say no words he told
[7:31] guards like I can't go over he didn't go
[7:34] over South typing that we have a prophet
[7:37] coming the endtime told us that this was
[7:39] okay luther weston print off was okay
[7:42] that was part of the promised land but
[7:44] it wasn't the promise the promise was
[7:47] full authority over here in the in the
[7:51] promised land and he put Joshua which is
[7:55] our top of the Holy Ghost here is the
[7:57] one that takes us over to what full
[8:00] adoption because brother Branham was at
[8:03] the headstone he was a prophet he was
[8:05] one of the angel one of the prophets
[8:07] that spoke and then he had to leave just
[8:09] like Moses said okay it's all right
[8:11] y'all can have this land but now what
[8:13] you got to do is you kind of Hoover and
[8:14] help your brothers fight this land out
[8:18] then you come back here and you can
[8:21] settle in justification sanctification
[8:22] the baptism the Holy Ghost
[8:24] because remember Luther's justification
[8:28] won't put us in the promised land you
[8:33] can't it won't now it starts your
[8:35] journey but we've talked about for
[8:37] months
[8:37] dad you die you you'll be given eternal
[8:40] life but you're not a bride now if you
[8:43] were in Luther's as though you've been a
[8:44] bride because the corn of wheat was
[8:48] coming up to two shoots they may cover a
[8:51] little bit more today but remember the
[8:53] two shoots don't look like the corn but
[8:55] every like that and they were going to
[8:58] produce is in them to shoot every corn
[9:02] every week every town every watermelon
[9:06] every anything is Indian two shoots
[9:09] because that's where the life is so
[9:10] Luther had life but he did not look like
[9:14] to see one he was over here this part of
[9:16] I went in the promised land
[9:24] that's why I said you gotta remember
[9:26] that the the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[9:28] is I promised land but when the corn of
[9:33] wheat went in the ground God had to
[9:34] start them back from scratch or back
[9:36] from two shoots over in this side of the
[9:40] promised land and then the stock and
[9:43] this side from Flint and part of
[9:45] Pentecost which carried over into the
[9:48] promised land so we got to come to four
[9:50] stages one two three four the fourth
[9:52] stage is the placing in the land and the
[9:56] beginning of the creation of God what is
[9:59] the beginning of the creation of God
[10:00] when Jesus Christ became human flesh on
[10:03] the earth through the womb of a woman
[10:05] that was the beginning of the creation
[10:07] of God that's what should have happened
[10:09] had they not been a father had they not
[10:13] been followed that was what would have
[10:14] happened in the Garden of Eden Adam and
[10:17] Eve would have had children by the
[10:19] spoken word not my said my spoken word
[10:21] but she would have had the kid brother
[10:24] Ivan tells us and I you know you you
[10:26] think sometimes you worry about
[10:28] something brother Brown said he said to
[10:29] Jesus Christ you have come through 80
[10:31] what do you you kind of think about that
[10:33] yet but the body should have come
[10:37] through it's once you look at it though
[10:40] it's so simple
[10:41] where did Jesus's body come from dude
[10:43] woman man but we wouldn't have needed
[10:46] uses true well he would have walked on
[10:51] earth in human flesh God's always wanted
[10:53] to be a human being with he's always
[10:55] been a human being but he always wanted
[10:56] someplace to walk around me so he gave
[10:59] him part of that he gave me a party part
[11:01] of that to Adam which would make him a
[11:02] son of God gave him full authority but
[11:05] when he had to take him back he said I
[11:08] gotta go now which he didn't say I got
[11:10] to go mammal he needed the whole plan so
[11:14] he comes him into the church ages he
[11:16] works in parts all the way through this
[11:20] is all in parts of the members this is
[11:21] on this style promised land it is part
[11:24] of growling because the baptism the Holy
[11:27] Ghost is the promised land but the
[11:30] baptism the Holy Ghost week
[11:31] plus our plus is that four states which
[11:36] is an unlined ox man an eagle which is
[11:40] just insane take about ten mil ago and
[11:42] what a full restoration of the word are
[11:45] placing our adoption because here's the
[11:50] whole thing
[11:52] no one has never been required to stand
[11:56] on earth and defy death and cause a
[11:59] resurrection to happen it was not in the
[12:02] first stage second third fourth fifth
[12:03] sixth and even in to the seventh age
[12:07] except into the end of it if I got that
[12:10] because Pentecost is part of that age
[12:14] guy blood when God sent a prophet
[12:17] this angel when he sent a prophet to
[12:20] speak these things to bring us up a
[12:22] little bit higher the faithful and true
[12:27] witness now I preached him that one time
[12:29] because remember that wasn't that he was
[12:31] a false witness back over the fact
[12:33] through the Turk ages true is like your
[12:35] tuning fork it's not fall but when you
[12:38] hit that tuning fork and it vibrates see
[12:40] that means it's a true see Sam or a D or
[12:43] near whatever you want to call it so
[12:46] when the true that means that it was
[12:47] false brother groundcovers that church
[12:49] age book but we covered it a little bit
[12:51] further when we looked at that word true
[12:58] brother Branham had to come because
[13:02] nobody but Jesus Christ everyone out of
[13:05] here
[13:07] so this this the reason the Prophet is
[13:11] son this in time messenger and to bring
[13:15] the trim work for us or to get to that
[13:18] place because we've got these body
[13:20] spirit and soul all for leave not that
[13:24] because that's the beginning of Grace in
[13:25] the God though Jesus's body was not
[13:28] eternal when he was born a baby from
[13:32] Mary it became heater it was changed
[13:37] and became eternal when do you rate when
[13:39] he raised from the dead
[13:40] it was the glorified body he was made
[13:43] eternal and that was the same body that
[13:47] was born from the womb of marriage so he
[13:50] didn't change or Eckstein's
[13:53] but what he did in the end time he comes
[13:55] back as you'll see down here that there
[13:57] they put him out of the church with all
[14:01] the dogma they put him out of the church
[14:06] it's a sad thing
[14:08] it's a sad thing to see though that you
[14:10] look out here well then I will come like
[14:12] this other day that's sincere there some
[14:18] people would make us look bad being
[14:21] sincere as far as doing works and
[14:23] thinking that they're but in this age
[14:26] folks if you're not bright your policy
[14:31] so that's the faithful and true witness
[14:34] the beginning of the crease of God
[14:35] that's why look you got real big lot of
[14:38] Christianity in the world within it
[14:39] starts only a brother medicine owns up
[14:41] to where the right here could a razor's
[14:45] edge right there at the point raising
[14:48] things now if you're standing on a
[14:49] Razors Edge
[14:53] well you can't you can't go I can't even
[14:59] go a quarter of a thousandth of a
[15:01] centimeter off if you do like brother
[15:04] Brown said if you get off on this side
[15:06] guess what happens what happens right
[15:07] here if you fall off on one side of the
[15:09] other you keep going off that's why
[15:14] Garnett sent a prophet and we got to
[15:16] know him believe that he was a true
[15:18] prophet now some people think that he's
[15:19] just a prophet or somebody came into the
[15:21] into the land and just preached an extra
[15:23] serving earn an extra few sermons I
[15:25] don't see that he had to bring the pure
[15:28] unadulterated were so we could stand
[15:30] right there on that needlepoint or on
[15:32] that right on that page they not fall
[15:36] off one way in the other but we see
[15:38] people now like that's talking to Mexico
[15:39] we see people falling off and brother
[15:42] Hamza the only way you can get back is
[15:45] go back
[15:46] right there because you can never go
[15:48] there never is a way that you poured
[15:50] water right here that water couldn't
[15:52] come back and do this right here that
[15:53] water just keeps flowing off away from
[15:55] the truth and that's what's happening
[15:57] right here because Jesus said I know
[15:59] that works that thou art neither cold
[16:01] nor hot anyone to table colder tonight
[16:04] why because in a lukewarm state what's
[16:07] with warm man it's just it just feels
[16:10] good and we'll stay right here that's
[16:12] what a lot of people say but we've got
[16:15] to be hot the colder going to get cold
[16:17] the harder going to get hot and then you
[16:18] got that lukewarm individual are the
[16:21] foolish virgin are the people that are
[16:25] deceived that are in a lukewarm
[16:27] condition because what he said I'll spew
[16:29] thee out of my mouth so in other words
[16:31] you don't become a part of me anymore
[16:33] I'm going to expel you because what
[16:38] happened down here
[16:39] they expelled him somewhere somewhere
[16:44] they put him outside the door so then
[16:48] because I was lukewarm and neither cold
[16:50] nor hot I will spew you out of my mouth
[16:52] [Music]
[16:54] because now says I am rich and increased
[16:56] with Goods now you can take that into
[17:00] natural because there's never been a
[17:02] rich or aged even with this coronavirus
[17:04] thing there's never been a richer age of
[17:06] people being this multi billionaire from
[17:08] multi something getting up into the
[17:10] trillion so I don't rinse and increase
[17:14] with Goods and have need of nothing but
[17:16] you gotta take that to the spiritual
[17:17] part we've got internet we've got the
[17:20] message in our pocket we've got every
[17:22] 1,100 sermons in our
[17:24] right now and we cannot do anything yes
[17:26] and we can listen to them somebody
[17:28] around the world we can listen to the
[17:30] message and help you almost if you have
[17:32] a iPhone watch you can do it through
[17:37] that you know so we've come down to
[17:40] where we think man what else do we need
[17:43] I know it's not that thou art wretched
[17:46] and miserable and poor and blind and
[17:52] naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[17:56] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[17:59] rich and white raiment that thou let us
[18:02] be clothed and that the shame of thy
[18:05] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[18:08] eyes with I said that I might see it
[18:09] then brother Daniel Martinez preached
[18:13] this sermon here
[18:14] several years ago and then when it how
[18:16] many is in here that's for the I says
[18:19] all these things beats I'm gonna give
[18:21] you a way to get back you think you're
[18:24] rich I'm going to give you gold tried in
[18:27] the fire that you may be rich what
[18:29] Ramon's that you may be cloak cause
[18:31] you're naked and don't know it and that
[18:33] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[18:35] anoint thine eyes with eyesalve the time
[18:37] I say so you got miserable poor blind
[18:40] and naked guys gonna reverse that clothe
[18:44] us open our eyes see because the rest of
[18:48] the world blind but the rest of the
[18:51] world says no we got 20/20 we've got
[18:53] LASIK surgery now we can't see we don't
[18:55] need glasses anymore right in the
[18:58] natural so the same way in the spiritual
[19:01] God has to take that laser laser surgery
[19:05] and do surgery on your high not too high
[19:08] up here but I have your understanding
[19:10] that there may be clothed also that you
[19:14] think I brother ransom in an awful if
[19:16] you see some I walking around
[19:18] you go hey buddy any place we call them
[19:20] I'm close that's what they don't have
[19:22] you been
[19:22] go Walmart they'll prove that they have
[19:27] no eyesight that their birthdates is
[19:30] gone yes that's right will smile and
[19:34] buying groceries like nothing's don't
[19:35] know why because what the world's to see
[19:38] the world is blind literally not
[19:41] literally but literally in the spiritual
[19:43] world where they should be the greatest
[19:46] message of overcoming face of the earth
[19:48] and we have full availability of it
[19:51] nobody wants it you tell people we were
[19:54] talking is that brother yesterday he's a
[19:57] preacher and he he started this little
[20:00] assembly praise a long long time ago he
[20:02] said where does your church at know that
[20:03] he's just two blocks back that way I
[20:05] said right to the side bus for Audrey's
[20:08] and he just kind of looked at me and it
[20:10] was either he knew and already heard
[20:11] about us or he didn't even know we were
[20:14] here I said we've been there since
[20:15] nineteen said what you wanted he just
[20:17] never come in it again so you see what I
[20:19] mean you can be right here beside this
[20:22] church let me put it this one you can be
[20:26] inside this jerk and be funny so I don't
[20:32] want the ice out that I may see what's
[20:37] going on as many as I love I rebuke and
[20:40] chasten be zealous therefore and repent
[20:45] behold I stand at the door knock
[20:47] let's get finished with this and look
[20:49] there they all not stand at the door not
[20:52] know what's he doing they put him
[20:54] outside the church brother Brown said
[20:55] and I believe they put him outside the
[20:57] message church because they only they
[20:59] won't
[21:00] shouting the speaking in tongues and
[21:01] they want the feelings and the emotions
[21:03] but they don't want that son of man in
[21:05] human flesh they don't want that further
[21:07] of the gospel for somebody to come in
[21:09] and teach them how to be not teaching to
[21:14] be a son of God because if you're born
[21:16] again you're selling on but to come up
[21:17] just a little bit higher to come up with
[21:19] that eagle anointing to where you can
[21:21] see further never never think that when
[21:26] this church or any other church talks
[21:28] about other churches not being further
[21:30] in the word they're not lost could be
[21:34] but but if they have the baptism my Holy
[21:37] Ghost they're right but there may be a
[21:39] better name not the arm
[21:43] yeah they got to go by the grave they
[21:45] won't come to this beginning of the
[21:47] creation of God because in the beginning
[21:48] of creation of God when this was
[21:50] supposed to happen before the fall we
[21:53] were going to come to earth and our body
[21:55] was going to be made eternal because
[21:56] what brother Graham said how many buddy
[21:58] was not eternal but it was being made
[22:00] eternal they would keep walking if they
[22:02] would have got to the Tree of Life nice
[22:03] London that's why the scripture says we
[22:06] can't let them get to this tree anymore
[22:07] because they got their eyes open and
[22:10] they know what's going on if they can
[22:12] get to that tree there will be God's
[22:14] like we are well that's why I go I've
[22:16] had to shut it off but now remember that
[22:18] tree life of Jesus Christ what did he do
[22:20] he come right back it was a tree in the
[22:22] garden it was Jesus standing there all
[22:24] right
[22:25] and say yeah tell that's your two forces
[22:27] you know you got a good needle and then
[22:31] what showed up when Jesus showed up
[22:32] Judas so they have you got your good and
[22:33] evil one showed up in 1906 a zoo the
[22:35] street good and evil then here comes
[22:37] World War one with all the nerve gases
[22:39] and all the things they said this was no
[22:41] that was the world war to end all World
[22:42] War several million people will kill and
[22:45] that didn't put a punctuation mark on it
[22:47] God sent a plague Spanish flu or
[22:50] everywhere you want to call it they
[22:52] devastated the world right after that so
[22:55] but then now right after they don't want
[22:57] to happen brother Brad was born 1909
[23:01] so in 1918 never I don't feel that
[23:06] something in 1918 here comes the flu
[23:08] will grow the grounds nine years old and
[23:10] he's heading toward a revival I told
[23:13] y'all before right and I didn't really
[23:14] bring in the Spanish flu but there was
[23:16] not any cure for any of this so what if
[23:19] I say God sent a healing campaign
[23:22] because the Christian people in the
[23:24] world cried out and God just like now we
[23:26] should be crying that thought would be a
[23:27] vaccine we need something to help us so
[23:30] God sent a prophet with healing campaign
[23:32] so it's really done works in continuity
[23:35] all the time
[23:36] he doesn't kind of the wet over here if
[23:39] you'll see his word just like we've been
[23:41] talking about the journey of a believer
[23:42] all the way from out of Abraham Isaac
[23:46] all the way through and then we jump to
[23:48] Ruth and today we're going to jump over
[23:49] into extra for a little while it's
[23:53] always typing us as believers and our
[23:56] journey that we should be taking leave
[23:59] behold I stand - door knock If any man
[24:00] hear my voice hear my voice and open the
[24:04] door I will come in with him and will
[24:06] sup with him and he would meet what
[24:08] communion God wants communion you don't
[24:11] the water beats atomically through the
[24:12] door and what is that door that door
[24:14] non-physical door it's the door whatever
[24:17] you got even blocked up then
[24:18] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[24:21] sit with me in my throne now look look
[24:25] how intimate this is and all the other
[24:28] church ages he said I'll give you the
[24:29] tree of life I'll give you the star I'll
[24:32] give you this I'll give you that never
[24:34] was it as intimate as this is today in
[24:37] the end time this is the intimacy of God
[24:40] he's bringing us in to sit not just on
[24:43] the throne with him hey that's it then
[24:47] in
[24:49] in my throne even as I also overcoming
[24:52] them sat down with my father in his drum
[24:55] I my father won and the prize won with
[24:57] him but though there was been talking
[24:58] about building the son of man
[25:01] it's not three different throne sitting
[25:03] up there it's one throne with three
[25:06] different manifestations of the person
[25:07] sitting on the throne even ear let him
[25:10] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[25:11] churches and thank God we were able to
[25:14] hear what was given to us in this end
[25:17] time and even with all this going on
[25:20] with this virus folks we got to remember
[25:23] one thing this world does not know what
[25:27] the end of this is going to be in both
[25:30] Canada from about this he does they do
[25:32] not know so that make what what's better
[25:34] fear is not knowing fear is not knowing
[25:38] what's going to happen but you and I
[25:41] should have no fear we know we already
[25:44] read the paper 60 years ago but what
[25:47] this thing is coming to know we didn't
[25:49] know it was a corona virus
[25:51] but still it's Bible is passed from
[25:54] person to person just like a bad spirit
[25:57] and everything else it but so is the
[25:59] Holy Spirit amen you get around people
[26:03] that love the Lord when you when you
[26:04] love the Lord right so there's the
[26:07] church ages there's no mortar cages and
