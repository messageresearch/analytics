little abby you know and i hope they're watching and many others and we just say to you have a thanksgiving time together you know in the lord amen all right revelations 1 very familiar this directly has been read 40 it's makes 50 times because 50 messages but how many more times we need to read it where we can really get it the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show into his servants things which must shortly come to pass and then sinned and signified by his angel unto his servant john and by record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and say that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand time to what time to understand time to understand now revelation 6 verse 12 through 17 now beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became his blood and the stars of heaven fell into the earth even as a fig tree casted her untimely figs when she was shaken to the mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when his role together and every mountain and island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and everett bondman and every freeman hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountain and said to the mountains and rocks fall upon us and hide us from the face of him that sit up upon the drone and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand you may be seated before that is blessing to the reading of the word and we were trying to cover their um sunday the point of and also uh brother jackson what's his name jason jason jackson will be here for preaching for us the weekend of the new year's time which will be on sunday and then monday will be our what's not service and he will be speaking for us looking forward to hearing him never met him never hurt him but looking forward to that this guy is jackson so remember that all right now as i said we we most everybody even brother brown am i looking today what he said about the uh sixth seal the tribulation see he knew that this scripture is used here as the tribulation and is using it as the tribulation then uh you know back in his early ministry he believed in a tribulation coming and the basics of religion um you know understanding they they believe that there will be a tribulation period but there was a lot of um misunderstandings as to uh you know what it's all about and what it's doing and you know we're not trying to straighten out none of that but just trying to uh understand the doings of the bible and followed it through but the main thing that we were trying to get across this past weekend was what this sixth seal is the tribulation period right and we don't have to go through that tribulation as the bride of jesus christ we're taken out of here in a rapture before that time comes and that's a great thing you say well you know why we have to understand this out of the other this is a good way to understand is to know and realize that we don't have to go through these times we don't have to face the times that's coming up on the earth it's getting bad enough like it is but this is just a pre-tribulation an amateur tribulation because really now when you're thinking about the tribulation period it is the wrath of god poured out now that's the point i want you to see tonight and we'll get down to it in a minute that it then it is the judgment seal you know but then he'll say that it's a judgment seal of the word well see in the tribulation what will make it so horrible is it will be the wrath of god poured out now look at the minor or amateur tribulation or pre-tribulation of all of the jews that have been killed down through there that we talked about all of the things of life that's going on were 200 000 people just washed off and killed and those are just amateur tribulation and it's that is caused by and brought on by satan and his doings but the tribulation period is when the wrath of god is poured out right that means there's no mercy no grace see once he once it ends up with you and i then his wrath can be poured out upon the earth and as we'll get to it in a minute 144 thousand is put in there the foolish virgin the world is purged a lot of things is to happen under this seal but the main thing i want you to see is that the tribulation period will be the wrath of god poured out there won't be any mercy that's right you could think about those 200 000 over there that uh greater uh tidal wave and things but you know there was still mercy that a lot of people didn't die right you know you can always find something like that but what about a time when you actually cry for the rocks and the mountains to fall on you no wonder the world will be so upset as we're covering sunday that when those two witnesses are finally killed that they send presents to each other to celebrate right because see every time they turn around they're just calling down the plagues of god what about it not raining for three and a half years i mean we had a three months drought with no water we we consider it to be a very horrible time but what about three and a half years with no rain that's a that's a horrible situation to even think about see that's the wrath of god now we're going to talk about it in a minute being a judgment seal then remember we are the ones who cause this to take place the people of the world is what's going to bring down the wrath of god you agree amen see because of the way we've lived we've done what we've done with the earth the bible says he'll destroy those who destroy the earth amen and yet we just run along doing it you know you know i've always thought about it i hate to roll down a window to see anybody throw anything out when i was out there fishing in the ocean after you pass a 12-mile limit i think it is you can just throw everything overboard all christ goes overboard man we just throwing stuff out i took my part and set it oversight i'll start taking it back right i'll take it back it may be bad to bring back put it in the trash but at least i'm not just throwing the garbage out but you just think about all those ships and all those things out there that just pumping all their waste out into the ocean no wonder everything dies and this is a pre-tribulation yeah this is not the wrath of god amen that's what everybody thinks so they're saying oh look that town was so sinful that's a wrap of god being poured out well it couldn't be but it don't have to be either you know let's turn around look at the rest of us and see what it is that's right all right but think about it now the tribulation period will be the wrath of god poured out upon man because of the rejection and the things and what we do and there'll be no mercy sure there will be salvation for the 144 000 to receive salvation during the tribulation period and we'll get to that in a minute and that's jacob's trouble but see then after that they're still there even though they receive salvation even though they you know they are the people of god amen but even with that they're going to be left there right for the wrath to be poured out upon their own things that have been called down by the the two witnesses to set it up is going to fall on them also because of the rejecting well now as i was trying to bring out the other day about if the root be holding the things and we we must you know depend upon the roots which is jewish and if if all of that has to go through that look what god does to you and i he doesn't put his bride through a tribulation his wrath can't be poured out upon the bride that's right because she's so much of him until it would not be correct would you think about it even though that 144 000 will receive god receive eternal life into their soul they won't be the bride of jesus christ because they rejected that right but they will be the people of god you know but they'll be put right in the tribulation to purge them for the rejecting you say well if they get eternal i want to be purged for because that's the thing i want you to see see church you and i accepted jesus christ as our savior right amen by accepting him as our savior he comes and lives in us see we have accepted this way we've said it's mary being unto me according to thy word you realize what she was saying right she was going to repair before the world as a pregnant young girl that had no husband right that's right but the world wasn't gonna be happy because she was gonna have a baby they wanted to kill her joseph had to cover her with a protective form of a husband to keep her from being killed but she was willing to take all of that ridicule in that part for her savior what little bit of problems we go through what little ridiculing we have ah baby stuff you know childish to even think about it oh everybody's against me no you got the problem with your in your own self if that's what you think amen that's right yes i'm being persecuted for being a christian maybe you're not acting like a christian as a reason you're being persecuted that's right you know what maybe they're not looking at you as a christian man they might be trying to show you you're not one brother there we need to preach on the seals okay you're supposed to be on those signs okay well i i thought that's part of it but now listen do you see what i'm talking about the tribulation period when it comes not the amateur tribulation not the things that are taking place now not even the days is getting worse and worse and worse upon the earth but when this bride leaves out of here even though that 144 thousand i want you to get the point even though they will get eternal life but they will not be the bride of jesus christ right right they rejected that right the foolish virgin that will go to the white throne have to stand a judgment and they'll receive eternal life if they're true you know not all of them but some will but they'll never be the bride what an opportunity it is for you and i to think about what god has done for us and then how silly we are you know to be griping and complaining no we ought to be put in the tribulation dishonest we deserve it you think you don't no we deserve it what you don't want he went to hell and i don't have to go he took my judgment upon himself that's right that i don't have to be judged he paid the price that's right who can argue with him about it you ever think about that really the bible says how can a thing form say that then it formed it once you form in this way i mean if even if he did make you literally a lost sinner we know he doesn't but if he did what right would you have or what court of appeal could you apply to because you don't mind you see the wrath of god then will be poured out and even that 144 000 those two prophets they will be under the wrath that they even call down themselves amen oh no no no brother tale they're they're going to be set aside then you're not getting what brother adam and you won't get what he's saying about what i'll try to bring tonight he's saying even though they are the children of god for that period of time they're going to be put in there for the rejecting of jesus christ amen that's what you would call what no you there'd be no name for it you couldn't call it grace with pardoning to it uh what would you call it that he would actually he's going to put them that we're going to re he's going to put them right in there and purge them when he's already given eternal life right you see the only one that bypasses all tribulation is the bride of christ what a wonderful god what a wonderful savior amen now we know this tribulation there's questionable arguments among the people of the message even now and we have never here even tried to in any way teach a seven-year tribulation period the prophet didn't teach it we don't teach it the denominational system of the world uh their doctrine is that there's going to be seven years tribulation there'll be three and a half years they call it minor tribulation and they say the bride church group you know the true christians will be here during that three and a half years of minor tribulation but then there'll be a vast major tribulation for three and a half years that the church will be gone you know and all of that but yet we know that those things are not right that's right even the drawings of the prophet that we have in the daniel 70 weeks don't confuse that to think that he's teaching seven years tribulation because it's not what he's doing he's teaching three and a half years of tribulation according to jacob's trouble but then they'll go into a purging of even the world right under that last part of the daniel 70 weeks that's what people can't understand they say well well you y'all have been so um adam and i guess is the word to try to prove with this to get a seven years and then here you turn around and say it's not like you think i'm saying you know and it's not that's there's only three and a half years of tribulation because that's the wrath of god poured out with israel existing here then it goes into a chaos because now what's the point of getting that that even though they are placed under i was thinking about this today trying to explain it even that 144 000 they're placed under the wrath of god but they're not crying for rocks and things to fall on them right they're crying for god to unveil himself believing in that even though it's called jacob's trouble and even though it's called the tribulation or the wrath of god poured out there will be a group of people there that will be under some form of mercy to keep them being destroyed amen all right they're just put there because of the rejecting because there's no no where to put them you can't put them in the bride the bride's done gone that's the point that i'm trying to emphasize to you if people would just study the bible from that but the bride goes up revelation 4 and it's not seen until revelation 19 on earth she's seen in heaven in chapter 5 and the thing but not on earth why because see really when all of those seals begin to break they're going to break to israel not like that we maybe try to understand it one two three four five see it's just going to open as a tribulation period they'll sing the white horse rider the red horse rider the black horse rider they'll see all of those signs yep but it'll really be the tribulation period jacob's trouble jacob's trouble is many things let me let me hold that on but we'll try to discover all right go ahead let's start on this because that's what we want to talk about this tribulation period now i'm talking about the three and a half years after the rapture not talking about the seven years of the purging because it just goes on over into a raining out of the wrath of god until the world and everything is purged but it's the three and a half years after the rapture of the ministry of jesus christ to come back to israel but it will come back to them in a tribulation period but it's called jacob's troubles let's read them brother number one jeremiah 30 and 7. so the last for that great that day is great so that none is like it it's even the time of jacob's trouble but he shall be saved out of it all right it's jacob's trouble but he said he shall be saved out of it see out of the tribulation period of the three and a half years after the rapture there i keep emphasizing that where nobody won't misunderstand me it will be called jacob's trouble it's the three or five years for the two witnesses but jacob's gonna be saying nothing you know what's gonna happen to jacob in that three and a half years his name is going to be changed to israel right because he's got a redemptive plan that he can receive eternal life but because of his rejecting back dire he's going to have to be brought in in a horrible type of situation but it's jacob's troubles but he'll be saved out of it that 144 000 is going to be saved out of it they're going to be brought out of that in jacob's trouble all right and look what it'll turn out to be let's just read it a little bit about this and let you just think about what he's saying go ahead to number two which is the revelation of jesus christ 1960 1204 des moines service prairie 399. he's talking about this tribulation that doing his family was out and gone so the rapture will come before the tribulation sets in the tribulation many people get them mixed up we'll get it straightened this week the lord willing by the help of the lord remember you're looking for a great tribulation period that was if you'll type that in the bible that was jacob's troubled age you see when he was troubled that had nothing to do with the gentiles the gentile has nothing to do with it no time in the bible to that the gentile church is raptured all right jacob's trouble now let's talk about it a minute and then read it see jacob's trouble is when jacob left i want you to think i try to preach and just take things and get you to think a little bit spiritually remember israel is in the tribulation because of their rejecting of the messiah right jacob's trouble begins when he leaves egypt i mean these are israel as we call it today and he goes down where he is meets up with his wife and you know he gets married and all that whole story see it's not just over there when he was wrestling with the lord that's in there we're going to read all of it but jacob's trouble starts when he left the promised land right that's what i call jacob's trouble now when he left that land to go he went down and jury found her wife and all the things went through it those things happened he's out there fighting it out what's his name layman or what his name was his dad-in-law tricks him deceives him and makes him work all those times and everything you know gives him the wrong life and then he has to work and everything else see all of that is jacob's trouble because that's where his trouble become that's right when he left the promised land to take a journey and that's where mine and your troubles at right we leave the promised land of this message that's right we're promised the truth but if we go out of the land we're not promised anything would run around say about a jew outside of jerusalem you see his backslid where judah just leaves jerusalem he's backslidden he's out of the will of god you see he gets all of the troubles and all those things happen ensure on this journey back he's trying to appease oh esau he's trying to give him all of his families and puts them all ahead of him my brother claude was talking about him he put leah and them out you know he put the bond people first you know his concubine women wives and then he sent leah to him and then i asked he said rachel you know then he was left alone and then he met the angel of the lord and he wrestled it out with him i never have to believe that to be a physical contact i don't know what you believe i mean i don't think he held on to him and wrestled with him that's right i think when he'd start to get up cause he wasn't gonna get up and leave anyway come on get the whole story get it truthfully the angel of the lord wasn't gonna leave until he blessed him right we didn't get up start to leave you know jacob just come on now just let that down let's talk a little while you know let's let's drink some more coffee and you know and we got some sweets here and we'll eat them they talk a while and that angel makes out like he's gonna leave again because he wasn't gonna leave he didn't come there to leave without blessing me that was his job because it wasn't a wrassling like a that kind it was more of a stay here you know don't believe trying to hold on to it that way not not getting cold you ain't leaving you ain't leaving so that's what we get all that in our mind we like to make pictures you haven't ever been in a bad shape i had to wrestle it out with the lord for a day or two sometime for a week or two there's some time for a month that you're trying to get the lord to heal you deliver you save you then what the physical battle was it i mean was you wrestling with the lord we're reading a little bit brother around and said those two witnesses wrestle it out until they get 144 000. out of the children of israel well you know what they're doing they're preaching the gospel right you've never been that way you've never been to the point that it just seemed like that god was totally away from you and you were crying out searching after him and repenting and trying to straighten up and do what was right but see he wasn't going to leave you anyway but we didn't know that right you certainly don't want to get right about the middle of it so okay lord i know you got me in this so just take care of it i'll see you later i'm going on vacation you call that stupidity brother they'll i call it human entity that is fun stupidity because you don't ever dare get to the place you think you can let god do what you want him to do you better always be willing to take whatever he gives you you remember brother brown said you never asked god for anything you didn't get now i used to think man when i first heard that i thought lord i shall ask you for a lot of things i didn't get i kept on listening you know what he said one day he said i've never asked god for anything that he didn't get me or tell me he wasn't going to give it to me then he says no from god it's a perfect answer right what if obama would have took it when god said don't go but you see he begged and pleaded and everything in the world goes no but his first was his perfect will second was his permission i'm honest folks i don't know where you're going to take this to be correct or not but i do we live most of our life in a permissive form trying to work out something with god in our lives when we should be repenting and just settle down and quit but you see church jacob's trouble was a whole lot of things all the way through that he was dealing with him he was in trouble because he was out of the promised land even though god was down there with him with blaming them and blessing and yes but he wanted to go home and he knew what it would cost him to go home he knew that at first it would cost him everything he had that's why he was willing finally to give it all families children money cattle everything he had centered ahead of him but then he had one thing in his mind he saw he's gonna kill me he said he saw he'll kill me well then he had to go back home he had to get with him wasn't that something right yeah if you and i could ever get this thing down right we ain't going to be worried about what people think about us and troubles we're going to count them as glory stones or something to stand on and shout hallelujah of all the problems that we so believe about you know okay but listen it's symbolized go ahead to number three six seal paragraph 244 i would invite you to go to the sixth seal and listen to the whole seal uh yesterday was down in the woods hunting and yesterday tuesday i guess today's wednesday but i had an opportunity to listen to the sixth seal and it was really a great time to just sit down there and listen but look what brought around says on the sixth seal vergara 244 now notice again now also when these jews i'll give you another little symbol so you can realize that it's used over here now on this side of the rapture and he's proving who this is right watch what takes place is absolutely symbolized we won't take time to do it now but it's symbolizing what was called jacob's trouble all right he goes on down to explain what i was just talking about sure he was a little rascal he had his eyes on the birthright but he stole it he was a deceiver when he goes down to his father-in-law he puts those speckled sticks between them keeps still jacob that's right tripper upper deceiver all right he's got to go see the reason there's got to be israel turned down jesus christ so there's got to be a purging of that sin you say well he just goes to him they've got to be a purging and they're right there in it jurors i've tried to explain they're going to have the grace of god but i don't believe that they're going to be totally free from all the plagues and things because if they are what's the reason of putting them there right i thought the reason of putting them there was to purge them well i thought purging what meant trouble oh but brother dale can't you just see people preaching oh man and everybody just shout glory ain't that wonderful they just preached with them 144th house they're going to be in goshen and ain't going to be nothing happening they're just going to be there and all the whole world around us falling apart i'm sorry i can't preach that way but it don't fit the word they're there for a purging and they're going to be purged right that's right they're going to be in the time of when there's no water they're going to be in a time when things are happening and even the two prophets are calling down they ain't going to be set aside if you believe that i'm sorry i don't what would you put them in the tribulation form sure they have eternal life in their soul surely accept jesus christ but they won't be right that's right now why not to be eunuchs the prophet said servants to the bride in the millennial right right but to go to that millennial reign means they're going to be purged but remember now as i said jacob he's a shyster he's a deceiver it took jacob a long time to be brought to a place that god could call his name israel a lot of trouble sure we love to just go to light to the next one and wanna do but let's read it go to number four i got 264 with the sixth seal now notice the esau didn't need his money right where he had everything he didn't want it when he got over there neither does rome need money they got the wealth of the world we find out that israel in that time of trouble when he was jacob he wrestled with the got a hold of something that was real and they're going to do that the tribulation there was a man come down jacob got his arms around him and he stayed there and the father said i'm going to go now i must be going now it's coming daylight oh that breaking of the night so it's fixing to come but jacob said i'm not going to leave you you stayed right with him those two witnesses moses and elijah they'll wrestle with god until 144 000 of the tribes of israel are called now that's just before the tribulation period now i see you getting into it well you say women just before remember tribulation sits in over here and works its way to israel while they're getting the message then it begins to strike there don't you think it's going to be affecting them so don't get tired of it and try to move it over and just leave it like it is and just take that 144 000 call them out with the two witnesses in the three and a half years after the rapture of it right across overlaps come in we know that but then there'll be a great tribulation of a purging of all things but remember the 144 000 and the two witnesses are killed the purging then will be going into other things all right jacob's trouble he's going to take them two witnesses three and a half years hey my brother they'll always talk the bible saying israel will be saved in a day it looks like today we go out of here they're saved next three and a half years preach it to them you know a lot of christians three nine years but it takes that long to call them all out so then israel is truly still born in a day but not just a 24-hour period not what it's talking about that's just a that's just a symbol or a thought because every one of us was born again on different days right but you know what we're all born again on the same day that's right the day of the lord for our hearts and lives all right but he followed me jacob he goes through a lot of things and it brings him into the tribulation period if it brings him to that he's being purged cleansing for the rejecting read the six-fold purpose make an end of sin bringing everlasting righteousness let's get on over to number six well number five brother branham is using what is the attraction on the mountain he said so judgment is fixing to strike the gentile world and the jews have got three and a half more years through the period of tribulation jacob's trouble all right now go on to number six because i want to get a thought in 144 the sixth seal for we know that this sixth seal is what the judgment seal yep it's the judgment seal exactly what it is the break-in here it is the breaking forth of the judgment upon the people we're out of this tribulation judgment will come forth out of this the judgment will come forward what out of the judgment's name 144 000 redeemed jews seal what does the word judgment mean it means damnation strong's recorded 29 17. it means condemnation are to be condemned it means to go to law in other words her offense is a decree judgment in other words condemnation of wrong condemnation wrong a judgment israel is put in there under judgment because they rejected jesus christ and you see why they're put there do you understand why they're put there they're put there for a judgment but i just don't understand because they're giving eternal life and then they're are you gonna judge them you see church for the bride we receive eternal life we don't have to be judged because god judged us right there you realize why it would take so long and brother said one seal italians our bible together you realize what happened to you in the new birth you had to come to a position to realize you were lost that's right and to know that you were to being lost you were under the judgment of god who's had a right to destroy every one of us the bible says we judge ourselves we won't be judged is that true right judgment's sealed and we're going to get the next one's going to be judgment seal of the word a judgment seal will you realize to get the new birth you judged yourself as being wrong and you realize there was no hopes whatsoever true yeah there was only one time plead the blood right right lead the blood of jesus christ he took my judgment i don't want it to be judged amen but you realize that i judged myself to be lost and i accepted him as my savior and by doing that then i placed everything on him because i realized he was already judged we get down into a minute where the prophet said when he came to calvary that was a six seal judgment right jesus christ came to calvary as a sick seal judgment that's right for you and i am judgment means a price has to be paid it means there's a place there that so he took my place their own calvary he took my place in hell he said all you got to do is just judge yourself as being wrong you know that's hard for people to do it's hard to get people to realize they're wrong right you want the prophet i think it's worth faints but around said it was hard to get those pharisees to realize that they were lost right to where he could die for i believe that's murder pain what about someone paid the price but yet am i willing to accept it he died under judgment come on church jesus christ died under judgment that price had to be paid but he knew if he didn't die under judgment we'd have to have judgment that's right you see what it means when the jews turned down calvary when they rejected jesus christ they judged that he wouldn't work the one he said he was right come on they brought judgment upon themselves they said let his blood be on us on our children amen see there's a judgment can we judge ourselves as sinners and know that we're lost there's no hope if we can't we can't be saved that's right oh brother dale you just make it so hard hard for what if we don't realize we're lost we can't be saved right that's right god ain't gonna override your free moral agency and save you we need you don't want to be saved let's don't get into catholicism but see that's really what happens to you when you receive the new birth you judged yourself as being lost you judged yourself and deserving hell and all that would pertain to them when i was talking about jacob he wasn't just when he was wrestling with the lord he was wrestling it out back over there with layman and all of that and he realized that he's going home and if he was going home he was going to die can we judge ourselves to the point to realize it if it takes death on right that's right didn't paul say i die daily what about the church the judgment seal have been on the others and kind of stay away from this type of preaching and trying to bring down the others and i sat down yesterday listening to brother branham you remember how he done he said we've been on this and we've been covering a lot of things he said i thought today maybe we'd just be a little different and he said then you remember what he done he took matthew 24 from revelation 6 you know you take one and the other take one in the other he said just give the class something else i was hoping tonight there'd be a whole bunch of visitors here because you wouldn't accuse me of being rich and deep you'd be thinking i was trying to help them but come find out we're just all home folks but the message is the same right have we judged ourselves yet do you realize what i'm talking about what goody goody thing do you think you ever done or didn't do to save you no i had to face one thing one day and that was the word i looked in the word and i realized that i deserved everything it had in there on the back and there was no hopes whatsoever for me because there was no man as job said that's what he desired he said if some man could just be found to be able to take my hand and touch the hand of god and bring us together sure he believed in a general resurrection in the end of the world read the book of job see that wasn't the end of the world in the resurrection was not what was revealed to him when he said i know our redeemer liveth he's tall a coming redeemer he saw the ability to bypass tribulation we're going to have to go through the tribulation even if that we taught in organized religion see they teach that the terms of what they call a gentile people saved in the tribulation period well the prophet said there's no gentiles to be saved in tribulation he says only 144 000 jews he said no that's not correct to say that there's a bunch of gentiles going to be saved no as the tree leans it falls the day the rapture takes place there won't be no salvation anymore for the gentiles as the tree leans it'll fall if you are a good person and done whatever it's already at that time settled it's not that you can try to plan to do something good you try to plan to do something good that's not a foolish virgin who is merging not somebody that says well hey i need to give water to everybody in the world because i might find somebody that's trying to figure out some way to get to heaven amen but it's when you just do something just out of love or thoughts or just whatever right and god looks down and sees that right you've heard rebecca talk about the neighbors that brought around said would be given eternal life because they didn't make fun of them you know and you know they could have called the police every other day on them for too many cars parked in the yard and probably parked all over their yard they didn't do it another one says they'll be given eternal life right it's not something you plan or try to figure out he's just being what you are but who wants to be a foolish virgin because i'd still have to stand the white throne and be judged but you see if i stand here and i look and i see that i deserve hell and everything to be thought of that's right the united see one took my place and was judged in calvary i'll give you the quotes after a while if i don't have time to read them but you ought to know it that sixth seal was right there on calvary god judging jesus christ to pay my price and he walked away from that cross everything would have been lost that's right he took my judgment didn't finish there i deserved to go to hell he went there for me amen i like that scripture and not leave my soul in hell neither suffereth thy holy one i got to see corruption that's right that flesh wasn't going to corrupt we know that see my soul don't have to go to hell why you went there for me judgment seal i hope you understand see even that faith sealed you that we talked about it's gonna plain grace to them because they didn't judge yourself wrongly still crying out for avenge they didn't judge ourselves to be wrong it's mad because what is that they wanted to be revenged because you see they never judged yourself dead you realized to be born again you have to judge yourself lost judge yourself dead judge yourself and have no hope whatsoever amen and to see that somebody paid my price somebody was judged for me i had a message a long time ago and he never got to it you see that most people are actually serving they totem pole god and what i mean by that is there is no living god for them it's just a form it's no more than an idol but they believe that they can touch that idol and run around and say they'll even hear imagine her voices and they believe everything's all right you know back in the old testament you had to believe that that animal the lamb the goat the doves the animal that was called you know the red heifer the things it was ordained you had to believe that that animal was in your place you know if you're going to worship a god whether it be a totem cold or whatever it is you swear allegiance to that god right i mean you're willing to give your kids to an alligator you swear allegiance to that god and we foreign allegiance to that god and no matter what he does i love him i was talking to someone yesterday i said if god sends me the hell i love him no matter what i love him because look what he's blessed you and i know there's nothing else to intellectually in our minds know about the things of the bible you don't everything like that to just intellectually know it without it being revealed whatever you just know god's word no there is a god that's right amen but he's not a total vote when i heard that prophet the first time i heard him say he said that great jehovah that covered all time in eternity he said he didn't stay up there when we sinned he said he'd come right down here to live with us right he said they're all what israel done he was right there i told him what a god truly is saying what almighty god we serve to take our judgment judge ourselves to be dead accept him as our savior and let him take our place let him sanctify us because what is sanctification is it not cleansing and setting aside am i right so you can put the new birth anywhere you want to in the word and just preach all you want too long it fits see those jews are going to be sanctified that's right in that tribulation period they're going to be cleansed of sin that's what happened to you we accepted him as our savior and we become sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and then his own life could come into us to make sure we don't have to pay no price don't worry you could believe in justification and sanctification as a form of old testament doings of trying to commit yourself to god and believing but there was no new birth back there there was no way that animal life could come back upon the soul of the individual but you know before that soul could come back into you and i to live that soul had to go to hell that's you had to go if you hadn't went in your place judgment seal of the word sure we're not over there when these things start falling the reason we're not is that we've done went through the purging here we accept him as our savior and we let him purge us from sin cleanse us sanctify us you can accept the very life of the one that that's it jacob could only wrestle with him every what you want to think that he is he could just ration it out and give it an anointing of a changing of a name a preserver because that's what he done no we saw he was he wanted to kill him right you know god had to go down into that old man's heart and plow that thing up real good he was going out there to kill him because he stole the bird that's right he didn't want his money he didn't want his cattle didn't want his stuff he wanted his hands on jacob so you know what god done and he just got to mellowing the heart down just a little bit right and he's riding out there in that desert and he says i'm going to meet him i'm going to kill it i'm going to hang him up for the birds to eat and one day he looks out and he sees all that people hitting his way cattle goods he said i don't want none of that junk i got all i need no no kids don't know wives i got all of these something began to deal in the man's heart he's the moon at least jacob was trying to be repented i'm still going to kill him next he looks up and he sees here comes some more of his goods and things he said he's really trying to appease me you know and finally rachel walks out and all of the things no esau says he's willing to give me his wives i heard the story of how he got him and how he worked for him he loved she already cared for liam they love rachel he begins to mellow down just a little he said i'll still get him he's a thief he's a checkup all at once he looks out of here doesn't come a mighty war you're riding on a charging horse neither does here come a man on the ground begging you know pleading with he sees a man that realized he deserved it and he sees a living preach you know just barely able to walk his heart got changed instead of killing him he runs up and throws his arms around him he said you got your birth right because you see i didn't cherish it enough all right i sold it out can you remember he did yeah for a party a little bit of meat someday but listen church are you and i willing to lay on the altar of god and plead the blood of jesus christ to save us why because he judged me jump over we'll come back pick up a couple of these times do it i'm going to find where he was talking about calvary go over to number 14 brother we gonna get through him i'll use some of these again sunday run it over to number 14 and look what he's talking about matthew 27 let's see what he did there matthew the 27th chapter now remember his son had been beaten and had been troubled they made fun of him and he was now hanging on the cross at three o'clock on good friday afternoon just about to take place matthew 27 chapter matthew 45th first i believe it is from the sixth hour of the seventh there was darkness and all and he goes through the great earthquake and all the things blackness darkness egypt blackness darkness god delivering jesus at the cross just before he brought him up from the resurrection first darkness sun went down in the middle of the day and the stars wouldn't shine two days from then he was going to raise him up with a mighty triumph after the sun and the moon and the stars and everything in egypt all these things taken place he delivered israel to the promised land look what he's doing all right moses in egypt delivered israel riverand was taken into jesus christ of calvary down to moses why because he said ezekiel sees this sixth seal he said isaiah saw this sixth seal i've asked all the purging of the world let's read that we do number 15 just to make sure you follow what i'm saying paragraph 321 in isaiah let's take this isaiah the prophet seeing this sick seal open and spoke of it that's whether it's important or not in order to be driving into our head right there that's where it says what's this important this happens after we get out of here what are we worried about here look what he said that's whether it's important or not maybe he picked up that thought that people say you know some of you may be saying well what do we need to know about this we're going to miss it until your prophet thought you thought well the whole thing whole plan of redemption lays under these sails and we'll get to it when i get time there's only six seals of redemption the seventh seal don't reveal anything about redemption there's only six seals that's right every name that's ever revealed in the world has got to come under the sixth seal because that's all they are to redemption well seven seal ain't a ridiculous form well the whole time whole planet redemption lays under these seals the whole book now remember we see jesus we've seen jesus saw it is that right jesus saw it now we find others that saw it we find it typed out in jacob we find it typed out in egypt we see it topped out at the cross now let's go back to isaiah i got a whole lot of prophets tonight and he said isaiah goes through all of it all those prophets typing and showing what the sixth seal would do we'll get back to it sunday and cover a little more it's even the purging of the world the world's going to be purged under the sixth seal but the main thing i want you and i to see that at calvary jesus christ was so purged until god accepted that's him the price is paid right all right body went to the grave so went to hell paid my price right all i got to do seal of the word the prophet said all i got to do is just accept jesus christ and let him take care of all my troubles you selling a sick seal don't mean nothing to me well then calvary don't mean anything to you right because the judgment seal of the word right anywhere in the word you see it you see condemnation all those definitions and then you see somebody pay the prize how much more church should we cry out in agony and realize our savior paid our price and god judged him dead dead that i don't have to die sit in the hell and i don't have to go paid the price of all of the tribulations could ever be thought of and i don't have to go to the tribulation what almighty god we serve what about it just take what i'm saying take justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost take it is seal poor because that's death huh five is grace to people that don't even want it right and sixth is sanctification a cleansing sanctified to cleanse and set aside what the prophets say the greatest cleansing is is fire to burn it out so the bible says what do you hate yet holy ghost and fire go to future home and you'll run around and explain that that looks like you get a holy ghost and a fire go to future home and see what he's explaining it that's exactly right holy ghost and fire because he's still burning burning burning burning within me but the main thing of it was that he came down to burn out everything that was left you get sanctified sure the unclean spirit goes out but sure what are you you're the same person you was only in a clean state and what motivates you is still the same except for the point that you're cleansed and set aside the devil still has access to ever feelings and memories and reasons and it's all that we have before we were come to salvation see the world one day we'll get a fiery baptism right that's right it'll burn ever germ you see that's what happened in the new birth everything that sanctification left the fire comes and burns it out because really it's the same thing because the holy ghost is fire it's not a holy ghost and fire like two different things the holy ghost is a fire god's word is a fire you remember the two prophets that says fire comes out of their lips you remember the prophet back there in the old testament said it's like fire shut up in my bones the greatest cleanser there is is fire sure it's not going to be like it is coming into the future home no but it'll be so much of a fire to under under the sixth seal of the nuclears and the things that are taking place until there'll be a cold cleansing right but there can't be a millennial right now prophet said i was reading it today i think i've got to know he said it can't be a millennium until the world is sanctified purged see the reason we miss it see we step ahead of everything we're head of the world right the world's waiting is baptism we gotta have our baptism in our soul we already have eternal life we're already spiritually in the 8th day by the new birth eternal life and that eternal life is going to change my body yes that's right i don't have to wait to the future home to get some kind of a change that's what a brother up north there says one of these days you'll catch up with your body in the future home my lord what is the new birth god is not capable of taking this man that i am and changing me and making me a brand new creature all over then there is no god judgment seal of the word so let's judge ourselves you see there was a day i looked back at what i was in and what i was teaching and i had to judge myself that if i stay here i can't go home with god's word oh sure we all done what we all doing right what we all do we want to hang around try to help them well we did that's fine but you see we're just like old prophet there was abram and god says get up and get out of here he said where i'm am i going he said ain't none of your business just get up and go he made it let's judge ourselves unworthy and accept jesus christ of his word come on lord hang on this the judgment seal to the word jesus hanging our own calvary was judged until the moon the stars the things went into total darkness the same as it was down in egypt well he was down there paying my price let me judge myself and be wrong let me condemn myself i don't like being condemned brother dale when you've got a problem with god i love the scripture where we read it in the communion right you notice i always stop and emphasize i said if we'll judge ourselves we'll be judged but if we are judged we are chastened to the lord that we be not condemned we should have a repentant heart every day of our life and no matter what i tried my best to save a man's soul one time to try to straighten him out on a doctrine and later i told him i said i'm sorry not for trying to save your soul but i said i'm sorry for crossing you he at least went away and told people he said what about a man that would try to straighten you out and say i'm sorry i'm not sorry for trying to help somebody no i'm sorry maybe my actions and reactions and my ways of doing is not good enough i'm sorry i'm sorry as a human like i am as a pastor or whatever i love the lord i want to see you there if you ain't come to the place like i was trying to bring out about paul paul said i would be a castaway for my people if you've never come to that you're not worthy to live that may hurt your feelings i'm sorry but it's true if you're not willing to be a castaway then you can't help nobody else that's right that's what the world want is people that are willing to give their lives the word christ can live judgment seal of the word listen where we got it in the spiral book me be willing to die god every get rid of all the demons is oh is hello right now fighting they're getting tired of being bombed but they still have that old attitude you know well we want more than blowing all over the place over here with us right we'll be ready to fight too but see the world keeps putting pressure one of these days they're gonna mess up try to put pressure on israel and that's going to be all cause she knows who she is she knows she's the chosen of god do we know we are his pride we're just not the chosen we are his bride uh what a beautiful message i hope that people sees it you can see that from start to finish there a scripture came in my mind just as you were speaking if you don't get the beginning you ain't got to worry about the end right but you go there with the thief on the cross there was a picture there there was a whole picture right there because those two thieves on that cross with with the lord jesus christ was there for a purpose one of them seemed that he was wrong he admitted he said this man has done nothing but we deserve what we fix right now committing they're wrong he judged himself he said he judged himself right and he turned to the lord admitting who he was when you come into your kingdom lord remember me and watch him he says this day and told him he was told his position right there he said this day thou be with me and see that's a picture for every one of us here this is where we start and that brings us to what brother said i've been preaching all night it brings it it brings you right through that sick seal purging it bringing in the whole thing right there you can talk about this all night bro i hope you know how much i appreciate it how beautiful the picture it was to me that i could stand here watching a vision before me like in my part in that vision what a great thing the priesthood seals and this scripture here comes into my mind to start you've got to see that you was wrong and the same repentance brings us day by day through the purging to the position god before the foundation of the world put our name on his book of life and he didn't just put our name but he put our whole journey amen and he said i'll be with you like he told moses now you go moses i'm to see him exactly but i'm going to be with you guys so i just won't keep on going brother what a what a great thing that has happened has been happening what's happening here tonight amen all right you know this thing going on with israel and you know there's people out there if they don't believe israel can take care of themselves they think the united states got help i'm looking for the day if they take care of themselves over there by themselves to prove that almighty god can handle this situation they don't need us but there's people scared to death because something's going to happen to israel if they did if something did happen to them they needed that's what we got today what we're putting up with in this country today we brought all this stuff on ourselves exactly we claim to be a christian nation and living is ungodly uh where i heard on the news coming up over in in san francisco that there's people just walk out there just as buck naked as the day they was born and the city is demanded they start wearing clothes now what does that take you know hallelujah amen amen anybody else remember be praying for wade for the weekend there to have it really jesus break the lord bless and say to everybody happy thanksgiving remember the turkey how about that because it's going to give up his life for you to be able to eat some tomorrow and some of you may just eat ham but remember the pig too but that way we're all just have a good time and god made these plans for us to be here we got nothing to be afraid of because he said before the first bomb failed exactly we got there's a people here and i'm praying that whatever each one of us is one that got predestinated before the foundation of the world to be here and fulfill this and let's do it exactly it's all winding up but let's just go home to not thinking about judge ourselves that would be not judged i do i love that scripture in the communion it just stands out to me every time i read it when we judge ourselves we won't be judged but if we are he takes our judgment right what a wonderful god we serve amen father we thank you we love you we just ask you to go with us now as we go our separate ways going home be with each and every one forgive our sins lord take us to calvary and let us die at the foot of the cross for that all the judgment of the world would not be set upon you will be rained down upon us because we deserve it we deserve a lamb to be as it is today because of what we've done with it lord we just ask you to have it your way with us fill his heart with love may we all be your children goddess now in jesus name you just
