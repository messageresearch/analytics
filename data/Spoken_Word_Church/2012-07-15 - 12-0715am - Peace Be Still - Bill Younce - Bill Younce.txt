brothers all done a good job expressing you know their thoughts about this part of you know what happened in 1963 of the pillar of cloud and why the dates are different and things and all and I thought they done a good job of expressing it it was it was really good because we know like I told them we knew back in the even in the right around about 70 somewhere right in there that there was a discrepancy about the dates that they were arguing about then but now there's a lot coming out and saying things and and all like that that about it but it's got to be here there must needs to be heresies among you that are they that are approved may be made m f it makes you dig makes you study think about what the things are amen but we had a good time and we looking forward to brother bill

the first time I've ever preached here it's his fault cuz he never called me you have to operate on that again and he's never preached for me called him I'm used to a different kind of microphone I got this ear tore off a drunk run over me back in 1983 and so it's real sensitive and I hope it's formed right for this to fit it where the musicians go I want to sing it you going to sing song musician come back up here oh I'm sorry it's my fault I'm not SE y'all didn't know he was an international singer he's Pentecostal God bless you brother Dale said we had a real good time yesterday yes sir you should have been here amen course it's always you ladies can never show up for these meetings and so except to eat with us fix it give me be flat this is an old song Hallelujah to the lamb I liked it when I heard it and so I wrote a verse the last verse to it so be flat oh it was told that he would come and the race he would run it would be on and over cross but when they lay him down in the Tomb the power of the Lord walked right in the room now he reigns He reigns forever more yes Hallelujah to lamb hallelu to the lamb let was SL the Tree by his we are healed by we areal oh Hallelujah to the L God come back Som take us home with him to stay all his glory forever will share and that last we all be glory live forever everybody help me now to the lamb Hallelujah to the lamb that was slain upon a tree and by his St we are healed and by his blood we are seal Hallelujah to the L God and since he's left from off that Throne the open book that'll take us so long then we'll know all the Mysteries have been revealed and when our bodies begin to change you'll hear the bride begin to S Hallelujah to the Lamb of God come on now help me Hallelujah to the lamb that was SL the tree we are healed by his BL we are seal hallelujah amen I trust that everybody is having a special year amen are you all having a special year is everything okay you R I thought you had wed up for 220 there brother him should be preaching instead of me back and some get real nervous when I get around a lot of theologians and the message so I started to say this is a special year for me me sister Charley been married 48 years June the 12th amen got the same one I started out with amen I've raised her the best I know house since 16 years old you Fells get married that's the best time to get them and then that way you can train them like you want them while they're young and so then uh in October I'll start my 45th year preaching the message hour yes sir I'm going to preach the sample today that you probably won't even think that I preach the message all I can preach so deep that I can throw you out of life jacket to come and bring you back in right but we and I know you all here are so established in the word of God because I know you're Pastor real well am right you're established in the word but I think a lot of times as I travel throughout the country people needs more faith right exactly and so if you have your Bibles let's turn to St Matthew chapter number 27 I appreciate brother Dale having confidence in me Amen to ask me to stay over is this is just an easy weekend I preached in Illinois North Carolina Friday night I got in here at 15 till 2: Saturday morning we were here all day in the service I'm going to try to get out of here by so if you see me hit the door and take off the flying I've got to slide back in the pull Pit by 6:00 and Elizabeth and so while I'm young I I figured I better do all I can for the Lord Matthew 2750 Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up The Ghost and behold the veil of the temple was rent in Twain From the top to the bottom mhm and the Earth did quake and the Rocks rent and the graves were opened and many bodies of the Saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection went into the holy city and appeared unto many mhm now when the Centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus saw the earthquake and those things that were done they feared greatly saying truly this was the son of God let's pray Master Jesus we know that you're in the house today because we're here yes Lord God does not dwell in sheet rock and pews and lights and carpet he dwells in people and so when your people walked in the house today God is here Among Us Lord and so let us today be encouraged and strengthened that we are a part of God's kingdom yes Lord we should be so excited Lord about all the things that have been going on and the things that we have heard yes Lord they ought to be such a praise Among Us L that we'd have to holler and tell people to quien down like do when we're in India so much praise of God that my interpreter has to say please be quiet I can't hear Brother Bill that's right what's wrong with us Americans God yes Lord we saw the same book and the same lamb that John saw and it so caused such a praise in his life that he just he was a real Church disturber so God I pray that you'll come today and let the Holy Ghost saturate his house and we'll just love and appreciate you for your grace strengthen somebody's faith today we'll honor you for it in your precious name we pray amen may God bless you can be seated well nothing else it feels good to have my ears free and so uh from those scriptures I've read to you this morning I'd like to preach to you on the first visit behind the veil amen and so uh the scripture that we just read to you the whole entire world had been waiting on this for thousands of years for this event to take place it was the purpose of God and the hunger of man that always desired and wanted to see God sure and we'd like to approach it first if you don't mind uh in the best way that I can simply explain it is it's like the priesthood yeah that's been handed down and I can't help it because God chose it to be this way but God he chose to hand the priesthood down from father to son that's right that's right right and I want to talk about a son that he's been prepared the years of his life by his father yeah yeah and he's being taught by his dad the things that be of God to now when this happened back in the old days of Jesus day they they never had a new testament to study that's right that's right and so his dad had to teach him all the things of the old scriptures yes but uh just the same time because I try to get down by four if I to save time let's just go like to the night before this son for his first time in all of his life I guess all night long he's crying out tomorrow I get to see God for my first time yeah oh yeah come on could you imagine what a Saturday night this boy had right all these things that dad told me right I must be so careful tomorrow because I'm going behind the veil where God is at yes and I can remember he would roll and Tumble in so excitement and that's the way every one of us ought to be when we come into the house of God we ought to rode and tumbled on out long I I hope you all don't thinking I'm trying to tell you to do something different here but I require my church when I get out of that chair and I head to that pull pit I want everybody in my church standing on your feet Clapping Your Hands and praising God because we're going to hear something from Glory today amen and give God a praise because the Holy Ghost has been dealing with your pastor whoever all night and today we're going to hear from God that's right and so this boy is so excited about tomorrow getting to see God for his first time and I just imagine brother way as he makes his way into that church will just yall don't mind Templar Church whatever so you can simply know what I'm talking about and the boy walks in the back door and and he sees that Veil 40t High believe brother 40t high and it's covers the whole entire front of the temple and how would you like to come to church here all of these years and you never got to see God and your pastor is the only one that's allowed to see him right and uh I I know that and and what I have heard if you look behind that Veil and you're not qualified to do that you're a dead man that's right well I'd have been a dead man right because I'm nosy when it comes to the gospel I want to know everything that's going on I would have to just walk up and pull back and take a little peek behind her and see what he been talking about all these years cuz I want to know wouldn't you and so he starts down that Highway and that his daddy had taught him he's now it's going over in his mind right and he said first of all I remember my daddy told me if I go behind that Veil and I've got sin in my life they're going to drag me out there a dead man right right right so that's why a lot of churches around the message don't want the Holy Ghost no more because it's a house cleaner and they're afraid their sins are going to be discerned out and they don't want nobody to know about it but I want you to know that the word of God is here this morning to discern your heart out and you can't get away with nothing and people in my church accuse me all the time they say brother Bill you have got my house bugged oh because last not everything that we said in our home and talked about you brought it across the pull pit what that is that's the word Discerning you out right and he's trying to help you right but so this boy now he's worried and I I believe that everybody that claims to be a believer when you come in the house of God you ought to make sure that if there's been any sin committed you ought to be crying out have my father I need help this morning I want to be clean God when I come in here I don't want the Holy Ghost to have to beat up on me that's right you you ever even see your pastor and I tell my people a whole lot time ever since we open the door in heaven and let it we're lifted up and we coming up a little bit higher and all the time we have to come back down to the Butcher Block yeah oh yeah and start whittling on everybody and cutting them up why is that cuz you pulled us down to the Earth that's right and we're trying to keep you up here and you and your life keeps pulling us down we just need a fresh dedication of God in all of our Lives I believe brother R said we backslide every day of our life every day we don't make progress in God we're backsliding true my where we ought to be now we ought to be in such a Heavenly atmosphere hey that's what what's happening to the bride today the voice has calling out to it come up a little higher amen amen but still yet I deal with people like your pting them 25 years Pastor would you help me time my Sho you know what I'm talking about spiritually where you been 25 years what's been going on what have you been hearing right amen oh I better get back to my story okay so this boy wants to make sure he has no sin in his life right amen and so now he comes down the hway and he gets ready to make his step up on that platform real say m could you imagine the feeling in his heart that's right oh I hope I'm not driving you crazy brother go ahead you got to be a fast cameraman to keep up yeah but uh that fear of going where God's at yep yes making sure that everything is perfectly all right right amen and it's such a fear when you make that first step on that platform to reach and pull that Veil back for your first time cuz you're going to see something you've never saw in all amen you're going to feel something that you've never felt since the day you was born and in all of a sudden he pulls the veil back right and he walks in and he starts looking around and he looks at the they altar the shoe bread and all that and I'll not go through all these things to save time but you all know all about and so he he he says what you know that's just what daddy told me everything's just exactly R away just like Daddy told me it was and he keeps walking and he knows he knows he's got some more Realms he's got to go through with and there's some more steps he's got to take in order to get back where he really wants to be for that day and so he starts making his little March back through the different veils and the different Realms of God and all of a sudden he comes into a presence a presence that some time you get into it it might make you talk in Tong I'm not ashamed of that it might make you do a holy dance it might make you scream and cry and holler you don't never know what you're going to do when you get in God's presence today over with God's presence might be here so strong you might be rolling down that highway back oh yeah all right now I'm getting ready fight got take bless and so as he goes back and all of a sudden he gets into a place or position MH that he realizes now I I am coming into God's glory glory this is what my daddy told me about and once you get into God's glory there's a real and a presence there that that's nothing like it's never been in all of your life and you know what he only saw an amber light yep that's all he saw is an amber light right right but we I hope the time we get done with we can go even into something greater than just being in a present but even being in the presence of ammer light could you imagine what it's like exctly could you imagine when brother brand would see that light come out he he'd say I see it over this in head and I see it going here and there can you imagine just seeing that what about Lo walking right into the almighty God's presence in yes amen yes well I'm going to go ahead and bring him on out so he comes back out and he's been in a presence like never been Y and he meets some church people hey boy watch your like wer yeah you got to see God today for your first time you know brother D he do some the Strang thing I don't know why it goes on like shut up man sh shut up I've been somewhere that it'll cause you not to never say nothing about nobody no more I've been in your presence man I don't hear no complaints I don't hear no moaning and groaning going on I don't hear you talking about nobody I've been in God's presence and all I can I just tell everybody I've been in the almighty presence of God and and it'll cause you sometimes to get excited yeah amen it'll even cause you sometimes to even say Amen C you some sometimes and just say and say hey I believe I like to hear a little bit more of that and when you get into that Amber presence of God there just something about that sh of Glory that you never are satisfied I've had the Holy Ghost now over 40 some years I'll never be satisfied somebody asked me said brother Bill do you know when you got the Holy Ghost I said no I don't cuz I died yeah and a dead man don't know when he died I don't know what day it was or I don't know what month it was but I know I couldn't drive my car home my wife had to drive me home and I happened to be one of them so if I embarrass you I hadn't be one of them I wasn't speaking in English when I went home I got to a place in God's glory in his presence something I've been praying for for8 Years Around The Altar I prayed 8 years around the altar I must have had a lot of demons and a lot of Hell in my life that had to come out of there and I had to pray a long time to get rid of it but once I released myself to the master it took me two minutes to e the Holy Ghost amen there you and it causes a presence in your life that will change you you'll stop curing you'll stop smoking you'll stop drinking you'll stop drugging and jugging and all these things and you get a hold of God and you just want more of it and you want more of it and that that's like said if there's a deep for calling there's a deep to respond to the call and you just keep going to go higher and higher and higher and like en was one of the wor knots of the Bible he just took out and a walk with God and after a while God said well I'll tell you what it's closer to my house and it's to yours as say going home and he was a wasn right that's right we going to be some of them for long you know he was and he was not that's what I'm talking about so would it really mean something to be in the presence of God Amen thank you Lord you got to PR prepare yourself to be in God's presence these people and I I don't want to talk about message people but that's all I ever preach to yeah go ahead I'm I I'm used to preaching to 10,000 people when I go to India I know what it's like to preach to 15,000 people that means there's 30,000 eyeballs looking at you or you preach I know what that's like yeah I preach to one if I can get him to stand still long enough don't matter size is nothing crowd is nothing it's a big God we serve amen and so now we we got to prepare ourselves to walk into God's presence is it all right I go on so uh could you imagine all this uh I hope last night of course you all didn't know I'd be here would you you probably most of you started your vacation today there's there's been a lot of people in the Bible that have made a trip into God's presence yes sir do you mind if I use some more scriptures sir ahead I love my prophet's quotebook yes sir yeah and so uh let's go to St Luke Chapter 2 m do you like that little story first amen did it make you feel like you know I want to get back her in ten right amen I really need to make a trip back her brother Bill so that I can I can be like that boy was when he come out of there yeah and so uh here is another man that I love to pre about and and I guess you all thought I was going to have a whole manella folder full of computer quotes this morning no sir come on I apologize but I've never went into the computer world yet I just learned a week or two ago how to uh find a text message somebody sent me on the telephone and I told him don't expect to get one back cuz I don't know how to do that because I I I really don't want to get trained I want to get trained in this right here and we always when we started out you know we we were preaching the message before computers ever come out and as Brother David M would tell you if he's still alive give me the whole book yeah don't give me a little quot I used to watch brother Mo thought he bring a sa in books in here that you know what he's talking about when he got done and so I'm going to tell you something uh we need to get a hold of God Amen and I I keep hearing brother brand scream out back to the word right amen anybody ever heard him say that back work amen he preached another message back to Pentecost right that's what I heard I heard I heard him say Amen St Luke 225 let's get around somebody that's real dangerous and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was just mhm and devout right waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him he's really dangerous a't he amen and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ right and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then tu up in his arms and blessed God that's right and said Lord now let us thou thy servant depart in peace according to Thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation amen amen now here is a man that had a testimony has anybody in the house got a cane amen what anybody got a cane you know like you used to walk with mind me in the car oh well he didn't do that all right I I'll just use my arm as one be all right but here is a man that had a testimony yeah he did and if this church right here and my church and everybody's Church don't have the same testimony that Simeon had we're going to miss something somewhere first of all we got to have that Holy gohost to experience he had and uh let's let's just uh a few times talk about him in this manner Wednesday night church service was H right after after this after he' receiv received this Revelation and he said uh church I I want to tell you something I had a visitation from God this week and I want you to know it's been revealed to me that I'm not going to die until I have seen the Lord Christ amen youall just remember what I'm telling you yes uhhuh and he comes in Sunday morning they give him a little like a lot of you brothers were come this morning and maybe before he's afraid or something say you all mind if I testify yeah I just want to tell you all it's been revealed to me by the holy ghost that I'm not going to die until I have seen the Lord yes sir and he come back in Sunday night and he's got the same testimony and let's say 25 years pass right and the AG is sitting in on him yeah yes and he said I want to tell the church something this morning I know you all probably T TI hearing this story but I I just want to tell you something I don't know why it is but I just get vibes in my body whenever I start think about what the Holy Ghost told me yeah and he told me that I wasn't going to die until I seen the Lord's Christ yeah yes come on brother I'm 68 years old and I've got the same testimony I tell the funeral homes they try to sell me a funeral plan I said I'm not going to die yeah amen I believe believe I'm one of them brother call that's on this earth right now that's going to make a body change I don't know what I'd look like I might look like a snake out a the woods that just shed his high and it's laying on the ground and he's gone yeah but when God gets done shaking us with this message of the hour and the power of the Holy Ghost and the transforming power of God comes down upon us and you stand there look at a 68 year old man make a body change like Abraham back about an 18y old man yes sir it's going to happen just you're sting on him we which alive and remain until he's coming we're not going to hinder nobody but we shall be changed from Mor to immortality and it's going to happen immediately in a moment that tckl ey is anybody getting ready to get out of here yes sir yes sir I'm looking for it that's my testimony and they say brother Bill you just preach about the coming of the Lord and all these Mysteries and all these things all because I've it's been showed to me by the holy ghost that in this message brother R said it's faith for rapturing amen that's what gives us a fa Rapture thank you Lord and so let's go uh 50 more years and say see might be 75 or 80 and he walks into his little can you know how senior CI have to do sometime and he says church I know it's been many many years that I told you all that the Lord showed me y that I'm not going to die die until I've seen the Lord Christ right yes everybody sits is he going to tell that same old story again is he going to give that same old testimony is he going to preach that same old mystery this morning we went through it 49 times and what's he doing it again for God just Tred to send us a friendly reminder and so let's just go to 80 years old with seeon I I ain't got no scripture back all these ages and stuff I'm just using it as in this story Simple Story told you I was going pre simple this morning he's 80 years old and he's got a little Walker now yeah and he comes in even before he left his house he told his wife he said honey my body's been vibrating all night long I I don't know what it is honey but it's like the Holy Ghost is been on me all not long I don't know what's going to happen today but I it's just all over me brother and I can't how many I can't have I just want to hurry up get to church early today and he walks outside his little walk and he stands there and he says he church can I testify to you a minute about something can I just tell you one more time that the Holy Ghost revealed to me many years ago that I'm not going to die until I've seen the Lord's cry back that time the church door come open and there's a little about 18 year old girl had a little baby in her arms I don't know what you think about this little baby but I believe he's Emanuel God and could you imagine what it's like cuz he baby Jesus coming in Emmanuel form in baby form and as he comes down the alleway and that baby gets closer and he gets closer and she's standing before him now and here you are two foot of the presence of Emanuel God you be sir Glory I don't know what you all do but we live close to church Indian reservation and I came from from that to see my mama come from that side I go amen many presence and I just got to praise God a little bit this morning CU I've got the viberation so bad today I don't know what in the world's happening but I do know one thing I feel what I've always felt amen when you felt what you've always felt you'll always be what you've always been and so all of a sudden she takes this baby Emmanuel could you imagine what it's like to get to hold Emanuel in your arm holding Emmanuel and he's no longer coming now he's no longer just being testified about but now you're holding him in your arms right yeah what did he say let your servant depart in peace that's right brother because the testimony I've been giving you people all these years in my eyes Hallelujah cuz I've seen that one I've been testifying about and I'm going to tell you one thing if this baby Emanuel has ever come not only to be held in your arms Jesus it's greater now than it was 2,000 years ago Jesus said I'll not only be with you Jesus be with you in a minute by the way he turn say I have need to go by Samaria and bless God he's gone and you may not s for a month but he said I'll not only be with you but I'll be in you and I realiz bless God when my feet hits the door of the Walmart Jesus just walked in the door CU he's in my soul and he's in my soul and I've always testify that the Holy Ghost is in my soul wherever I go to church or to visit the grandchildren or wherever I go but Jesus is going with me because he said he'd be in me even to the end of the world and if you think be satisfied and can't overcome the world with Jesus in you what's he going to take yes yes exactly that brother all you nothing bothers me you're a liar things do bother us I'm a preacher and I'm a human being and things bother me the greatest thing bothers me church people church people are you you know you study all week long and you try to get a message together and you you you know a pastor can't help so we know now the Bible says that the saint shall judge the Earth who could judge this church any more than brother Del because he every one of you and so we we have these thoughts and we can't help but maybe this will really help that person this morning maybe this little word that's coming will really help this and encourage them and give them strength and you come in and they ain't here exactly right I think the word IR ain't see it irks me find when you're expecting them all right all righty so I believe the Lord to bless us today then in our day did you know that Satan's even trying to make us all doubt who we can make it or not absolutely truth brother tell you you can't make it oh yeah you just goingn have to talk to it amen Satan talks to us preachers too sure oh yeah he tells me you think you're something you ain't nothing you nothing but a dog I said you're a devil you don't know who I am I'm King bill you call me a dog but God said I'll be a king right I will make you Kings and Priests who you you know why you have to be a king because somebody is going to Crown Him king of kings and that's us amen amen I'm going to around I'm going to wear a crown yes it's a bright and Shining Crown God said I was yeah God said I a King sir does anybody treat you like he was a king anywhere you go brother I treat me like a king since I've been here I don't have to have my crown on to be treated like that's right that's right so the devil's trying to tell us all we can't make it that's right it's like it was I believe it's about the last uh Exodus chapter 5 and you ever hear Moses fussed God Moses fussing at God he said you brought us out here now and we we've done all these things and you got us out here now and and you ain't done nothing for us God just told him two little words and I preached on many time you'll see brother Bill How can any of us in here making me into glory and make the body change you'll see when the transforming power of God comes down he can roll back the Red Sea it can change bodies it can do anything it wants to that's when it's here yes sir so you'll see just hang around a little while and you're going to see there's somebody in the air want to make a yes sir we're going out of here so let's see if uh somebody can make it let's go to St Mark 4 is this simple enough for you all it's just simply deep good simp St Mark 4 now when I read this if you don't catch these little old words in here you might miss my thought am I doing okay you're doing good you're fine St Mark 435 verse 35 says in the same day when the evened was come he sath unto them let us pass over unto the other side right and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there were also with him other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full how much more water could you get in the ship when it's full you can't get another drop in it it's full the next drop it's overrun right yes and there Rose a great storm oh I just read that and he was in the H part of the ship asleep on a pillow yeah and they awake him and say unto him Master carest thou not that we perish right and he arose and rebuked the wind and said un the sea P me still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm amen and he said unto them why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith and they feared exceedingly and said one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the Sea away yes I suppose words that was said about Jesus how can I say this without trying to make me something the words he said people said about him never a man ever spoke like his man that's right that's my heart's desire yeah right yes I have people sometimes Brother D I know You' have they've been people that you preach brother Tim around somewhere they say brother Bill you said something 10 years ago and I'll never forget it I like that person but we ought to be people that's preaching things that nobody has ever spoke like that's right that's right and that's why it has such an effect on people if this message is introduced right right yes and so we got to do for people here and Jesus is telling us now that maybe if the devil has got you worried about get making it over there yeah what did he say he said let us pass over unto the other side yes did he say this storm was going to stop us no did he say that maybe a bous win or something other is going to come up and stop us n no and so the devil if he's a beating on you tell him we will make it amen cuz God said amen and so if he told us to go to the other side ain't nothing and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against us there's not nothing going to stop us from getting over there how many of you are planning on going to heaven you ought to be saying amen how can anybody stop us amen Obama's not going to stop us neither is the pope wrong going to stop us neither is the top five preachers in the message going to stop us amen thank God for the bottom 5,000 nothing is going to stop this change brother R said God said I'm not going to let somebody else do it I'm going down there and I'm going to do it for myself he's the one that's going to do it we're just preaching to you what God Said that we can do and we're going to the home show that's right right that's right yes sir thank you all for your smiles Hallelujah I keep a mirror on my pullit all the time and once while I have to remind the people do you all see what I have to look at all the time

back room how where you oh you well we don't have one I why you want you practice what you preach I believe when I bring the Holy Ghost in I want him in the sanctuary like he was in church in about 30 45 minutes before service and some people begin to speak in tongues and things like jeon Bill and the church order take and they rise up and they take the interpretation tongue L upon none of that happened in the sanctuary and now we got him in the back room and they don't even come out yeahhuh yeah that's right so they forgot who's in a 100 part of the ship he got's on board if you're going to the other side how can the ship go down when God's on board he can't go down right Lord Jesus I hope we realize today we got God on board with us we can't go down there's no way the devil can stop me and you from making it in this Rapture because inside of you you think you don't have nothing but let some pressure start coming just let a few things and that that standard in your life and God raise up your standard now CU all Hells are breaking Lo God raise up his standard and you can just feel it go away amen right amen you ever wonder what causes that you ever been up up against a wall it's

long winded like me brother around here can I tell you another little story amen would you women like to hear something exciting for you all yes I hear so much about the women in the message they beat

does that's right uhhuh okay I just I just thr that in yeah yeah we don't have to lift no more offing let's just turn over the page in St Mark 525 am I still in the message okay and when I start reading if you've ever heard this story before anybody preach on you can say yeah we've heard this already brother Bill heard me tell it yet that's right that's right verse 25 of Mark 5 and a certain woman now this woman wasn't anybody that was very important yeah she wasn't of the Royal bloodline that's right she was just a little certain woman in a church in L Georgy yeah come on just sit there nobody popular her name is not on the Neon Light Signs going down the highway or the big bulton boards and all the say she just a little certain woman right which had an issue of blood 12 years yeah and had suffered many things of many physics and had spent all that she had and was nothing better and rather grew wor so she must have been a pretty wealthy woman called Medicare Medicaid human Blue Cross and Blue sh have never paid all these bills for 12 years right and then she's worse off yeah after 12 years of been with the doctors they some of them will kill you but sometime it's better all right when she heard of Jesus D come on came in the press behind and touched His Garment now sisters youall remember this as long as you left for she said yeah Jesus didn't say Peter James John nobody said she said that's right y if I may touch but his cloes I Shall Behold amen and straight way the Fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that PL you know why because she spoke the word for herself right right you believe you sisters can actually speak the word absolutely my mother-in-law is 85 years old lives in a little mobile home up on the mountain that we fix for and Wednesday evening about 2:00 she opened her cabinet door in the kitchen and she said who left that piece of black tape L under my cabinet and she W in there and a snake bitter what would a 85y old woman do with the snake look like he's about 6 or 7even foot long she said you down you she's in church when she not praising the Lord hallelujah am Hallelujah B Hallelujah get you

that devil off your back yeah amen you sisters know how to M kick give him a good start praising the Lord yeah and say that same devil that was talking to me minut go I'm tell something you know how real Jesus is yeah Glory Hallelujah down at the cross when my savior died he'll get out of there right I'm trying to help you sister you Pi the word if you want to right believe that I meaning the Bible sir yes sir and she is healed y just because she spoke the word he said if I touch you g I'll be ho he don't have to anint me with o he don't have to lay hands on me he don't have to speak the word he don't have to do anything oh I'm going to do is touch His Garment cuz I've already said when I touch His Garment I'm here right now I'm sure this is too simple for us all yeah and Jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about in the press and said who touch me now this is a little woman that's got such such a faith there so certain she can stop God dead in these tracks right yeah amen blind when he screamed out Jesus day and God Stood Still yeah he stood there y do you all know we got plac like and the lamb stood yeah yes Hallelujah that's right yes right over here sitting on the throne in Revelations 4 but over here in Revelations 5 and brother b as as the message was being revealed he says I see him now right in up from the throne yeah he's he's getting in an upright position and all of a sudden it says and the lamb stood right you know why the lamb stood CU us Pentecostals that didn't know nothing about the message of the hour is calling for God to come down cuz we're we don't know what to do or where to go that's right I'm talking about when we first come in message you're right somebody's caused the lamb to stand that's right and open the book y yes let us see yeah hallelujah amen that's right yes sir he stood still he stood up he went somewhere I I I this little woman caus him to stand still and he looked around about no first he said 31 and his disciples said unto him thou seest the multitude thrown in thee yeah and sayest thou who touch me Lord all these people around here and all this crowd how do you know somebody touched your Garnet he said I perceive that virtue has gone out from me strength of healing just left my body right and he started looking around and he said who touching me Y and he looked around oh boy you ever have God did look at you yeah I know you're hiding from him and he he's he's searching to look at you you and he looked around about to see her that had done this thing look this poor little woman she's like a lot of messy women yeah but the woman fearing and trembling know what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth yep she was so nervous and she he's getting ready to chew me out for what I've just done and I just started praising the Lord because of the seals and things that are loose and I hope brother H don't Che me out for this screaming and H I'm going about so she's she's fear she got fear on her is this story making sense right come on now watch this certain woman to nobody and he said un her daughter hallah oh there's a change that place from just a little certain woman and now Jesus is calling her daughter thy faith has made it thee whole amen go in peace and be hold of thy plag glory to God well Glory I like it tell you one more story and I'm going to get out of here go ahead bless it's found in St Matthew 14 y'all feel like this is Little Faith Builders yes sir thank Lord yes sir St Matthew it's on page 109 so here these guys is getting ready to get in the boat again yeah that's lot of message preach they go fishing morning they preach oh sorry I hope I don't get in trouble and I get to come back to again and straight way verse 22 of St Matthew 14 and straight way Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitude away that's kind of like a lot of preachers ain't trying to get them to open the door and let Christ come into the church right and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves another storm coming up yeah for the wind was contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea amen and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying yes it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straight way Jesus spake unto them saying be a good cheer it's I Be not Afraid kind of like Jack C talking getting elev woman said I've got cancer he said be a good cheer sister whatever whatever they had Jack they be of good cheer everything's all right God knows how to heal people right Be not Afraid yeah is anybody here actually afraid today you afraid you going to get right over by a train coming out of here yeah no just watch the lights and that thing come down front of you stop yeah that's right and Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and Jesus looked back at him said one word come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water go to Jesus sure but when he saw the wind bers he was afraid beginning to sink he cried saying Lord save me and immediately like a Rapture Jesus stretched forth his hand and CI and said unto him oh thou little faith wherefor did thou doubt all right can I tell this story like this amen Peter was a Fishman I never read where he knowed how to swim or not never have heard I don't know if he if he even knowed how to swim or not right don't know if keep swim like an Indian you know how to do their hands over their head and like it but now somebody asked him to come and let's just look at it like this here's this big boat and it's got like a rope ladder down the side and Peter at his command and in his mind he's qu he's calming down this letter he said he's asking me to do what it takes of God to do M uhhuh sure so he starts coming down the L brother could you imagine the thoughts in his mind but coming down to water yeah and especially when he to his toes touch the cold water you know that we do sometime but he's said he said I I'm moving at his command he only said one word in me y right yesly and if he says come you better come that's right no matter what the situation is amen but all of a sudden his feet touch the water and he's doing now what it takes a God today that's right Jesus Christ I hope we see where we're in am I'm doing what it take God to do now I'm walking on the water like he is I will walk on the water with you yes I will walk on the water with you I guess he just started singing here he went towards Jes and he's like a lot of us there's a borous wind wave ra up and it's a bigger waves and things that had been seen that day yep and he let that boisterous wind get his attention off that's right what he's looking at y what he was doing and there's a lot of Winds of doctrines and things come around us and get our eyes off what our real goal is right brother and so he's walking down and he's looking at this bous wind and it causes him to lose his foing right and he started sinking y oh yeah and you know what Jesus said Jesus didn't cuss him out Jesus didn't fuss at him yeah he never said one word he just said oh you have little faith yes see that's where we got our P pastors we got to start talking to our people right oh you have real faith can you just see the faith of Jesus Christ is being revealed through the message of the hour correct oh yeah can't you see the revelation of Jesus Christ and what a faith it brings and and you know uh we are right now supposed to be doing things that only a God can do that's right that's right exactly right you know why we do things that God does because he lives in here and when he starts speaking out of his mouth right we don't necessarily every time have to say it's thus sayith the Lord we just say lady be amen I don't even lay my hands on people no more and pray for them I don't use oil and anoint people no more when I I pray I found a higher Faith than that blessed I got some looks looking at me now go ahead brother there was one man that wanted Jesus to come by the house and pray for his daughter yep MH and he wanted him to lay his hands on her and brother brand said that bottle of oil that I use he said it's been the biggest hindrance of my ministry that's ever been in the United States of America but it's a Jewish tradition and we're supposed to be getting ready from all these traditions and all that's right a Jewish tradition but there was another man a ceron that had a 100 people or more over him he said I'm my servant I tell him to do this and he does that and he does these things and you know he said Jesus you do not I'm not even worthy that youd come by my house y but he said all you have to do is just speak the word will be healed yes amen that's the faith of Jesus Christ you know what Jesus my Lord I have not found so great a Faith No not in all of Israel that's this man right here is God right then if he could have that greater Faith why can't we it and go ahead like this little woman and speak the word amen that's right right Nick this is great you said we got some great things to speak out sir brother Bill I'm possessed of a devil hey I am prepared right now to anybody in this building that would say you're possessed to the devil I'm ready to cast it out amen cuz the authority has been given by the by God himself to the Ministers of whatever you bind on Earth I'll bind it in heaven amen yes sir sure well I believe I'll testify while I have a chance amen I know what it's like Brother Dean I have faced to Demons of Hell sure I was preaching a youth rally Richmond Virginia why they want an old man to preach the young people I don't know why but the pastor says if you have question why that we call brother Bill in you watch the altar service at the end right that's why we want him here cuz I found out you can preach to young people it's like you do old people right touch their heart you know what young people tell me in youth camps qu talking to us and treating us like a kid some of the ones hold the Youth Camp say want you m m and that young people they want to see somebody the power of God in their life they want to see the holy ghost moving among the people that's right and so this black brother a friend of mine from over next to U Virginia Beach Virginia he come up brother D after the service and was making an altar call and he looked at and he said this he said brother y please remember my daughter in prayer he said she's so demon possessed that I can't do anything with her any longer I did not know that the girl was in the house and about that time there was a young girl come down the hway like over there and she come around and I counted 12 preachers behind me before I started praying and when I started praying there was nobody there and this girl sat down in front of me and she started ripping her clothes off and it just so happened we had some good siiz sisters along with us with us in the van and they saw it and he grabbed her when she started ripping her clothes off and I know I wouldn't messing with just anything right that's right and so I reach over and I I I was going to say brother let's pray but they would they would not brother wait it's it's awful to tell but there wasn't one preacher nowhere I said you think Satan that I'm going to back off too I reach over brother Dale and I grabbed a hold of that girl's face and her eyes popped out in front like a like a like a m child her eyes come out I reach one suck her her skin I felt her skin changing under my hands just like alligator hide I'm not messing with a holy ghost filed girl now I'm messing with somebody that's possessed of the devil and the Ministers of this hour if we don't get down to business the devil's going to possess them and take them out off under our hands we got to get prepared yes we got to be ready to cast out Devils I got to hold that girl I said loose your hold on her enemy right now I cast you out you devil come out of her right now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and she just withered like this and slid off in the floor right delivered of it amen hallelujah I'm testifying now I hope y mind it helps people yes sir I was in East Camp up north I'll say there that way you don't know where it was at brother H me and my said this thing from songs for us I usually keep about 195 250 songs with me all the time I need and so I started singing and I seen these two girls come up beautiful beautiful brown headed girl beautiful little Bron headed girl about 17 or 18 years old real thin nice and I standing there and I I can't help it because the holy ghost shows me things come on I thought both of these girls are persisted but the brown H girl wasn't possessed as bad as the blond H girl was and so I just seen that Spirit come on her and I said youy lose your H loose your h on this young girl's life you can't be afraid when you do these things Brothers we got God in our lives and he operates and he knows how to do these things but this young blond-headed girl but the time we got done with her it was five preachers and two sisters that little skinny girl she'd crawl on her back like a snake on her elbows I tried to make eye contact with her and she looked at us and we started casting that devil out of that girl and guess what he had to go cuz there was somebody had more Authority than he did right amen am you know what that girl's Pastor didn't know she's in the Youth Camp her parents didn't even know she was in the youth camp but she was from a message Church sure and they called me back and told me that when that girl went into that Sanctuary Sunday
