[5:04] which is great I was gonna suggest that
[5:06] but I don't have to you're doing it on
[5:08] your own so god bless you for doing that
[5:11] if you see an older couple or an O or

[6:20] life but sister nyla has decided to be
[6:22] baptized and you know what the water

[6:25] to be it'd be a real good time
[6:29] for you to die so god bless you good to
[6:33] be in the house of the Lord first
[6:34] Corinthians we'll be making these
[6:36] announcements a little bit more as we go
[6:38] through so
[6:39] journey of a believer this is part 10 or
[6:42] 11 I can't keep up with it but we'll be
[6:44] talking a little bit about Esther but
[6:46] we're gonna go back through and read
[6:50] a little bit more about Abraham and Ruth
[6:54] I hope you understand it even you know
[6:56] you listen to what brother Dale has been
[6:58] speaking on we we we are called as the
[7:02] as Lewis was saying we're called into
[7:05] adoption that's our call our call is not
[7:08] to stay over there with Ruben and GAD
[7:11] and half tribe of Manasses all right
[7:13] we'll talk about that a little more to
[7:14] clarify that a little more today but our
[7:17] promise is is the placing in the land
[7:20] across Jordan that's our placing now
[7:24] they were in the part of the promised
[7:25] land that they were to get
[7:27] Luther had the baptism the Holy Ghost
[7:29] Wesley had the baptism Holy Ghost
[7:31] Pentecost had the baptism the Holy Ghost
[7:32] but they didn't go further into the word
[7:35] as we'll see now also in Esther that
[7:39] there was a lady named bash died and
[7:40] back style was his wife
[7:42] but she didn't want to go no further
[7:44] with it so he divorced her and married
[7:47] another girl so we thank God for these
[7:50] types and shadows and I hope you're
[7:52] really getting something out of some of
[7:53] these types and shadows that were I
[7:55] don't Bible is good to just read but it
[7:59] needs to be read with understanding it
[8:00] needs to be read with spiritual eyes
[8:02] like the Bible says in Revelations that
[8:05] God gives us I south to put on our eyes
[8:08] every Sunday and every Wednesday every
[8:10] time you press play every time you're
[8:12] talking about the Lord there's some eye
[8:14] south going on your eyes so that you can
[8:17] that you can see better so let's bow our
[8:20] heads you Heavenly Father thank you for
[8:22] this day
[8:23] thank you for protecting us Lord you
[8:28] you love us if you love us you told us
[8:32] you'd take care of us and I pray Lord
[8:34] that our honor and praise and it would
[8:37] all be back towards you Lord if it
[8:40] wasn't for you at Calvary we would never
[8:43] be here Lord and we thank you that
[8:46] you've sent a messenger in the end time
[8:48] to to bring these little nuggets out of
[8:51] the scripture that that was in your mind
[8:54] the whole time but man had got it so
[8:56] scrupled up until it took a prophet to
[8:59] come Lord with a mind of God and to tell
[9:02] us what this love letter means every
[9:06] time we open it up Lord it's written not
[9:09] to Esther not to Mordecai not to the
[9:12] different ones even Abraham and Isaac
[9:14] it's written to your bride it's written
[9:17] specifically for us in the end time who
[9:20] the end the world's come upon for us to
[9:22] be able to glean these things out Lord
[9:24] and to take a body change as becoming
[9:27] the Word of God father just bless us now
[9:29] and be with us heal the sick Lord we do
[9:32] have sick among us we pray that you
[9:34] touch them Lord keep their sickness away
[9:37] and as we say again Lord we pray that
[9:40] you just stayed this thing father that
[9:41] we'd get back to some kind of normalcy
[9:43] and Lord that you'll you'll they'll
[9:46] allow us to come back into the service
[9:49] to where we can have full services in
[9:51] the front Lord and be able to worship
[9:53] you father we pray this you just bind
[9:56] the enemy bless our pastor father be
[9:58] with the Deacons the elders all the
[10:00] different ones Lord that has anything to
[10:01] do with the church that we're we're
[10:03] trying to uphold Lord here today all the
[10:06] rules and the regulations we pray that
[10:08] you we would have patience Lord maybe
[10:10] that's what we need we need patience so
[10:13] we sent you sent this thing among us to
[10:15] see and to trust as you always said but
[10:18] Lord you said we would come out as pure
[10:20] gold because we're your children father
[10:22] just asked you to bless us and the
[10:24] further the service you be the active
[10:26] speaker Lord and may we be the
[10:28] participants in Jesus name we pray amen
[10:31] first Corinthians 10 that talks about
[10:33] I'm not gonna read all that but you me
[10:35] you look and you see that this the whole
[10:38] book of Corinthians is the book of
[10:40] Corrections or what's he doing he's
[10:42] telling he's telling the Corinthians
[10:43] that hey Moses was a messenger and Moses
[10:48] was given a group of people and had all
[10:52] kind of signs and wonders going on in
[10:54] their camp I mean they just God just
[10:57] babied them but watch what it says in
[11:01] verse 5 but with many of them God was
[11:04] not well pleased for they were
[11:05] overthrown in the wilderness what they
[11:07] didn't do what they were supposed to now
[11:09] these things were our examples to the
[11:10] intent we should not lust after evil
[11:12] things as they also lusted need to be
[11:15] idolaters and all these different things
[11:16] let's read verse 11 though here's the
[11:19] whole summation now all these things
[11:21] happened unto them for example and they
[11:24] are written for our admonition upon whom
[11:26] the ends of the world are come you may
[11:29] be seated in the Lord at his blessing to
[11:30] the reading of the word like I said
[11:33] again thank you all for coming your ones
[11:35] downstairs for having patience
[11:39] and we're just going to move right along
[11:41] and let's see what the Lord has for us I
[11:45] I
[11:48] some I think it was my lovely wife back
[11:51] there was know why I was singing and
[11:53] saying Amen so loud the other day
[11:55] sitting in the back I'm just glad to be
[11:57] a church
[12:01] see y'all I
[12:03] think another day I read in Kings
[12:05] therefore David
[12:07] the Ark of the Covenant had been gone
[12:09] for months over in another place and
[12:13] here comes the ark back there pulling it
[12:16] there pulling it into ended Bethlehem
[12:19] into Jerusalem and David gets out that
[12:21] he gets so happy till his poor old wife
[12:24] rebukes him and he says I don't care and
[12:29] that basically what are you saying I
[12:30] don't care if the whole world sees me
[12:33] the Word of God is back where it's
[12:37] supposed to be so I say now the word of
[12:39] god is back where it's supposed to be so
[12:41] we should be happy
[12:43] there's not been a lot of amens I mean
[12:46] female amens
[12:49] in the sanctuary for a little while so
[12:52] now we can get all the good amens from
[12:55] the from the brothers and the sisters so
[12:56] we missed you and good to have you back
[12:59] and good that we can that we can
[13:02] fellowship hey listen we have no
[13:04] fellowship anywhere else do you have
[13:05] fellowship anywhere else I mean your
[13:07] regular family yeah you do every once in
[13:08] a while but you don't talk about God if
[13:10] they're not Christian but when you get
[13:12] among this family here then we can talk
[13:14] about the Word of God what God's done in
[13:16] our life and all the things that we've
[13:17] that we've saw that week before that
[13:20] we've read and and like brother Ryan
[13:23] said the other days and man thanks for
[13:24] all those nuggets well you know what
[13:26] somebody like brother Ryan though we'll
[13:28] go back and study them for months at a
[13:30] time and just keep and it just keeps
[13:32] unfolding that's what it should be for
[13:33] everybody that we take these little
[13:35] nuggets listen when God gives you a
[13:37] nugget remember it's eternal God can't
[13:40] give you any things not eternal in his
[13:42] word when he gives you a revelation that
[13:44] revelation is eternal then we'll never
[13:45] go away from you actually you build your
[13:48] character on that revelation you build
[13:50] your Christian journey on that
[13:52] revelation that God gives you maybe just
[13:55] one word maybe just one sentence maybe a
[13:57] whole message
[13:58] like we've been talking about in the
[14:00] Book of Ruth all the little nuggets and
[14:03] we see that we know one thing's for sure
[14:05] Ruth didn't walk through life going well
[14:07] now 6,000 years from now there's gonna
[14:09] be a group of people that they're gonna
[14:11] mimic my life and they're gonna use my
[14:13] life as a subject know she lived her
[14:15] life she lived her life as Ruth that's
[14:18] who she was samo with Esther Esther
[14:19] lived her life as Esther okay she didn't
[14:23] she didn't have the knowledge that she
[14:25] was not gonna be forgotten
[14:27] several thousand years later when we're
[14:29] sitting here reading about her today
[14:31] same way with Abraham I don't believe
[14:32] Abraham got up and said now in 2020
[14:35] they're gonna still be talking about me
[14:36] he had no clue
[14:38] but God did tell him he said can i
[14:41] withhold anything
[14:43] from Abraham and his children can I
[14:47] withhold anything from no well if we're
[14:49] the children of Abraham by faith they
[14:51] God can't withhold anything from me and
[14:53] you he's gonna reveal itself to somebody
[14:57] you just gotta decide whether it's you
[14:59] or not mm and today we should decide
[15:02] that it's us we're the ones that he's
[15:05] going to reveal it to we're the ones
[15:06] that he has brought to this purpose and
[15:09] his brother Joe and I were talking about
[15:11] angels a few minutes ago and I've been
[15:13] studying a little bit on it myself and
[15:15] he brought some point see brother
[15:17] Branham had an angel I don't know why
[15:19] I'm going here but I'm gonna take this
[15:20] for a minute brother Brian had an angel
[15:22] remember that angel stepped out and
[15:23] appeared to him
[15:26] middle-eastern man said he was kind of
[15:28] big built by six foot tall said he stood
[15:30] there with his arms crossed
[15:31] and brother Brown was like who are you
[15:33] and he said look I am an angel set from
[15:37] the presence of the Lord to tell you
[15:40] these things
[15:41] now listen the difference in brother
[15:43] Branham and I says is he could he could
[15:45] step over into that dimension being a
[15:49] prophet
[15:50] but folks I'm gonna promise you one
[15:52] thing there's an angel just like that
[15:55] that walks with you every day of your
[15:58] life that stands over your bed at night
[16:01] and watches you sleep and make sure that
[16:05] when you get up and go to work that the
[16:07] traffic even though we may have to stop
[16:09] in it the traffic is not gonna bother
[16:12] you are you going to go to a place and
[16:14] you're gonna you're gonna try to go in
[16:16] this direction and what happens
[16:17] something happens and you have to go in
[16:19] another direction or you're five minutes
[16:21] late or five minutes early I'll never
[16:23] forget that that time that we were
[16:24] coming back from a fellowship meeting
[16:26] and we come through Dawsonville there
[16:28] and coming out of Dawsonville there's a
[16:30] crossroad and there's no
[16:32] there's no traffic light but they
[16:34] stopped on this way because we were on
[16:36] the major highway on 53 I guess it was
[16:38] and I was in the front and the van and
[16:40] Daddy was in the back in the van and
[16:42] they was probably probably between
[16:44] hearing the door distance between us as
[16:46] we're traveling down well make a long
[16:48] story short I go through that
[16:50] intersection at about 55 miles an hour
[16:53] and I see this
[16:55] light go through my
[16:58] rearview mirror and then they're caught
[17:01] then I call it going that way that had
[17:05] never stopped through that stop sign and
[17:07] if we would have been one second
[17:10] one way or the other brother Dale would
[17:14] have got side right in the driver's side
[17:16] or I would have got right in the
[17:17] driver's side the guy saw him hit his
[17:19] brakes when he realized what he'd done
[17:21] but brother Gary he went right between
[17:23] us and we're running fifty-five he's
[17:25] probably running forty or so you see
[17:28] what I mean
[17:29] one second
[17:31] 1001 and I would have been here or 1001
[17:35] later and daddy would have been here you
[17:37] know what guardian angel
[17:39] he's over there going hey hold on man
[17:41] I'm gonna get it in between these two
[17:43] I'm gonna make it a miracle so they'll
[17:46] see what I'm doing I just if you don't
[17:49] believe that then that's okay but I
[17:51] believe we all brother Brown said we had
[17:53] angels all believers have angels so
[17:56] they're right there with us the whole
[17:57] time we just can't physically see them
[18:00] and you know sometimes you see a flash
[18:01] the lighter you see something that maybe
[18:04] them
[18:06] brother Collins passed away you know
[18:08] this last Monday and he was a rather
[18:11] large man and being a rather large man
[18:14] they said he had a heart attack and as
[18:16] soon as he had that heart attack he died
[18:18] on his feet they said he was dead before
[18:20] he hit the ground
[18:22] but the paramedics told sister Barbara
[18:26] his wife she was telling relaying it
[18:29] does
[18:30] that there's no way that big of a man
[18:32] died on his feet and didn't have
[18:35] bruising or scars on his body because of
[18:38] the way you would have fell because he
[18:40] was in the yard he was out in rocks Jim
[18:44] that rock that place is not like a real
[18:46] soft place it's dirt everywhere rocks
[18:48] everywhere stomps everywhere right but
[18:52] he laid down just like this right here
[18:54] turned his head sideways and that's
[18:56] where he died I said sister Barbara
[18:58] there's no I have no problem with that I
[18:59] said soon as he centers that happened I
[19:01] said his guardian angel reached and
[19:03] grabbed his head and just laid him down
[19:06] and then brother Joe told me he said you
[19:08] know that happened in the Bible member
[19:10] Stephen they stoned Stephen and he went
[19:13] to sleep in the arm to the angel
[19:16] hey man what a mighty God we serve hey
[19:18] give me my hands left-right
[19:20] we're not alone in this thing that's my
[19:23] we're not alone in this thing this
[19:24] journey that we're in is an anointed
[19:26] journey it is a journey that you are
[19:30] going to have to take because you're a
[19:33] child of God that's why with this
[19:35] journey of a believer I'm trying to take
[19:37] look in the Old Testament and you see
[19:38] these people in their journey where they
[19:41] don't realize everything that's going on
[19:44] but you and I realize
[19:47] everything that's going on when we see
[19:49] something in our life we go well that
[19:51] was because of and that was because of
[19:55] you know put whatever in it for your for
[19:58] your are you are you think of what
[19:59] brother Branham said have you ever had
[20:01] something happen in your life and you
[20:03] think of a quote or think of something
[20:04] that that happened in brother Browns
[20:06] life or you say well that happened to
[20:08] Esther or that happened to Ruth or that

[20:20] just the line ox in the man you got to
[20:22] have that eagle anointing you got to be
[20:23] able to see higher it's the further
[20:26] we're not better people than those
[20:28] people were we're still sinners saved by
[20:31] grace but God has been gracious enough
[20:34] brother Ray to send us a message
[20:37] that explains
[20:39] what's going on and this whole world is
[20:43] falling apart people are scared to death

[20:51] political realm is and see what this is
[20:53] listen you and I you and I we know the
[20:56] end of the whole story and we don't just
[21:00] know it by the Bible we had God sent a
[21:02] prophet that gave us clarity that he
[21:05] could see and he said watch Russia when
[21:08] she comes down after that oil watch the
[21:10] Vatican don't worry about communism he
[21:12] said you worry about Romanism he said it
[21:15] would be that purple curtain that you
[21:17] need to worry about not communist I'm
[21:19] not Russian who's gonna take over what
[21:21] we know what's gonna happen we know

[21:52] money but
[21:53] God has no stipulations when he gives
[21:56] you something he's a free giver but the
[21:58] devil always want something in return

[22:42] me to come to your house and pray for

[23:03] what tomorrow's news is we know how this
[23:06] thing's gonna wind down but Colonel I
[23:09] get you being up here in the front step
[23:11] here okay
[23:12] this were brother Colley says you're
[23:14] just a young brother Colley
[23:17] y'all pray for brother Colley pray for
[23:19] all the ones in brother Colley wanted to
[23:21] come to church day tomorrow brother
[23:22] Colley wanted to come to church he said
[23:23] I wanted to come but let's just let's
[23:26] just play this thing come you say well
[23:27] are you scared no I'm not scared
[23:29] he's what he's better from what from
[23:33] what is the affliction that he was that
[23:35] he was dealing with he's he's doing a
[23:37] lot better some Gardella healer
[23:40] cocktail the healer there's no man gonna
[23:42] heal us there's no virus gonna kill us
[23:44] and a preacher asked me yesterday we
[23:46] were taking up we were taking if we
[23:49] don't get to this that's okay we were
[23:50] taking a
[23:51] there's a lady that worked with you and
[23:53] her father-in-law was a preacher named
[23:56] Grady Sexton you remember Grady section
[23:58] well anyway he was there and we were
[24:01] taking the bees it was in it really easy
[24:03] it was in a recliner on their back porch
[24:04] so the Beast found that's a good place
[24:07] to be so we opened it up so he asked me
[24:08] he when I told him who you were he said
[24:11] did God bring this plague or this virus
[24:14] I said no and he just kind of looked at
[24:17] medicine no I said God can't create
[24:20] something like that I said no God can
[24:23] create a cure he already has the cure I
[24:25] said but he allowed it to happen and
[24:28] when I said that he didn't in June he
[24:30] just kind of went that's right I said he
[24:33] allowed it to happen because look
[24:35] brother I said God allows a lot of
[24:37] things to happen but he don't make them
[24:40] happen he allowed this to happen to show
[24:44] who's got it and who don't the show
[24:47] whose weak and who's strong listen you
[24:49] said while I'm weak okay you found a
[24:51] place
[24:53] Abraham found a place he was weak
[24:57] but then in other places he was strong
[24:59] you need to find your strength and then
[25:00] work on your weaknesses because remember
[25:02] like I said before only during hard
[25:04] times do people really rise up the cream
[25:06] really comes to the top the the the when
[25:09] the going gets tough the tough get going
[25:11] you understand what I'm saying so we've
[25:14] come to this hour that we need to this
[25:16] is kind of pencil sharpening time this
[25:18] is the time when we need to really look
[25:20] and see do we really got what we think
[25:23] we got right as we were talking about do
[25:25] you really know that you know that you
[25:27] know that you can walk into fiery
[25:30] furnace
[25:32] that you can walk right in the three
[25:35] Hebrew children did it with no baptism
[25:37] of the Holy Ghost they just believed
[25:39] that they said look either God's gonna
[25:43] take us to the house
[25:45] or he's gonna make a miracle out of this
[25:47] one of the two and he made a miracle
[25:49] that stood for centuries so we thank God
[25:52] for that let's look again at the journey
[25:54] of Abraham I want us to see that listen
[25:56] we're not here go ahead pull that up
[25:58] we're not here just
[26:01] and I want to say this and listen what
[26:04] I'm saying not just to get the baptism
[26:05] of the Holy Ghost
[26:07] that that would that was your dark ages
[26:10] that was your when the corn of wheat had
[26:12] to fall in the ground and his brother
[26:14] Dale was talking about and I want to I
[26:15] want to make another point to help you
[26:18] with that you know when I walk out and
[26:19] look in the garden I see the two shoots
[26:21] coming up now that's not corn
[26:25] but every life all the life
[26:29] that's gonna make that corn is in them
[26:33] two shoes you cut them two shoots down
[26:36] you killed the plant so they're just as
[26:38] important as the cordon it's just this
[26:41] what it's the phase that's gotta go
[26:43] through its another phase it's got to go
[26:45] through its the husk it's got to go
[26:47] through you know we're farmers or even
[26:49] you just look outside and see plants
[26:51] ending in the ground you see there's
[26:53] nothing you know all of a sudden a
[26:54] little bud pops up then all of a sudden
[26:56] two shoots pop up every life that's
[26:59] gonna make anything on that tree or bush
[27:02] or rosebush or what is in them to shoot
[27:05] so that life was in Luther that life was
[27:09] in Wesley that life within Pentecost it
[27:12] was just the stages that it had to go
[27:14] through so you and I have come through
[27:16] those stages but we got to come to that
[27:18] fourth stage of placing our adoption
[27:23] because as we were talking about this
[27:25] morning in the son school class when you
[27:28] come to revelations 3:14 and he said it
[27:30] and the Bible tells us the beginning of
[27:32] the creation of God that was never
[27:34] required in any other age now what was
[27:37] the beginning of the creation God it was
[27:39] virgin born son of God the Son of man
[27:42] born 2,000 years ago the barn the way it
[27:46] was supposed to been born
[27:48] so now why is the same thing wise to say
[27:50] the beginning of creation of God in
[27:52] revelation 3:14 for the loudest and
[27:54] church age
[27:55] darkest hour but here we are to produce
[27:58] Jesus Christ again and then in that
[28:03] fourth stage
[28:04] that okay
[28:06] maturity the only way we can take this
[28:10] what's going on outside is being mature
[28:13] all right
[28:14] journey of Abraham remember
[28:17] went through justification
[28:19] sanctification we showed him going
[28:20] through the Holy Ghost the new birth
[28:23] placing or adoption then we saw the
[28:25] journey of Ruth what happened to Ruth
[28:27] Ruth come up to a place and she had to
[28:29] decide whether to go with Naomi which
[28:32] was the type of the old church the
[28:33] Jewish Church are to go back to her with
[28:36] her denominational sister orphan go back
[28:38] into the world or go back into her
[28:39] denomination all right well we're gonna
[28:41] see that's happened the same thing with
[28:43] Esther almost that we see there was
[28:46] something come on the scene there was
[28:47] another woman because remember a woman
[28:49] always types a church always brother
[28:52] branham said always in the Bible you can
[28:54] type a church with the women in the in
[28:57] the Bible or even he says go look
[28:59] outside he said they're typing what they
[29:01] are now blind wretched and miserable
[29:02] naked and don't know it go to Walmart
[29:08] you'll see blind rich admissible naked
[29:11] and don't know it or they wouldn't go
[29:13] outside they don't sell mirrors anymore
[29:14] I don't think
[29:16] it's not required that you look in them
[29:18] before you leave
[29:19] but that's just the way the world is
[29:22] that's the world but you and I watch how
[29:23] you and I walk through the same Walmart
[29:25] and everybody looks at us like we're
[29:27] crazy y'all sisters they looked at you
[29:30] look at you like you're crazy and the
[29:32] man you ain't got short shorts on and
[29:34] tattoos up one leg and you don't have
[29:36] you you know you tank top on with you
[29:39] girlfriend's name on the top on the
[29:41] shoulder that you don't even like
[29:42] anymore I
[29:44] love my mama
[29:47] but that's the way the world is look how
[29:50] blind that is though they think that's
[29:52] perfect they all gather together and
[29:54] that's all would you get your tattoo
[29:56] and we all get together and say man
[29:58] where'd you get that revelation from you
[30:00] see the difference
[30:02] birds of a feather
[30:05] and we're all white now we're all
[30:08] Eagles
[30:10] for those of you didn't go to the
[30:12] funeral that was wonderful because
[30:14] brother Mike brings in a point brother
[30:18] Dale brings on a point and the other
[30:20] brother raising the point and it was all
[30:22] different characteristics of the lamb as
[30:26] bill the tariff said that him just as
[30:27] meek as a lamb and the other than
[30:29] bringing in the Eagle and brother might
[30:31] bringing in his point and at all what it
[30:33] was the life of of Eugene Collins
[30:37] but it was totally fit in all the
[30:40] scripture that you could think about for
[30:42] a lamb and eagle and what brother mind
[30:44] could talk about being a soldier alright
[30:48] so can they say that about us
[30:51] because our journey to me is more
[30:54] important than their journey because we
[30:57] have to come to full maturity
[31:00] that's our that's our call it wasn't
[31:02] their call listen Abraham root Sarah
[31:04] they're all resting and they're all over
[31:07] in another dimension now waiting on us
[31:08] to finish this thing up but we're gonna
[31:11] finish it up by what by watching them
[31:15] cuz look this is what we're wanting
[31:18] right here
[31:19] we're ruining our reward our reward is
[31:23] not just by and by I'll die I'll fly
[31:27] away hallelujah all died I'm going know
[31:32] somebody's come and got to come to what
[31:34] a
[31:35] maturing of that capstone and take a
[31:38] body change so that's what you and I
[31:40] that's our commission we have no other
[31:43] commission but that
[31:46] so Ruth deciding she decided to go with
[31:49] with Naomi and think look how strong
[31:51] that was she said
[31:53] I'm a Moabite
[31:56] my god is different from yours but now
[32:00] whatever your God is that's going to be
[32:04] my god
[32:05] Naomi whatever you I'm gonna listen
[32:08] listen because remember the Ruth is a
[32:11] type of us
[32:13] they always a type of the old church
[32:16] what are we doing today we're looking
[32:19] back on the old Jewish heritage of the
[32:22] Old Testament
[32:23] cleaning out what Ruth is supposed to be
[32:26] bringing forth today everybody got that
[32:29] all right so it's Ruth deciding then
[32:32] Ruth serving she goes out feels she
[32:34] starts doing she starts coming to church
[32:36] she starts what she starts gleaning she
[32:40] starts putting up a little food
[32:44] Sundays and Wednesdays nice play
[32:47] whatever else you want to talk Bible
[32:49] study and I hold those things that's
[32:52] what Ruth was doing she wasn't just
[32:53] standing on the corner field said hey
[32:55] bring me some ice over I attitude
[32:58] sometime
[32:59] hey bring it to me no Ruth went out and
[33:03] what she caught the eye of the master
[33:06] she caught the eye of the king of the
[33:10] harvest she caught the eye of Boaz was
[33:13] like who's that girl because remember
[33:15] she wasn't in the lineage of G of the
[33:19] Jewish lineage she had no lineage she
[33:21] hadn't married into the Jewish family
[33:23] the husband died well there she comes up
[33:25] though under the protection of Naomi the
[33:29] old Jewish church and weaves her way
[33:32] through that as the old Jewish church is
[33:34] today I'm talking to you the old Jewish
[33:36] church is weaving us through these types
[33:39] and shadows
[33:41] Feast of Trumpets feasted all these
[33:43] different feast off we know that type
[33:45] Christ but you know what we can look at
[33:47] and see how it's part of us we're now
[33:50] brother Brown said feasting under the
[33:52] Feast of Tabernacles well you're not
[33:53] building booths out in this didn't you
[33:56] see that when you were over there well
[33:57] somebody saw in the when he went to
[33:59] Israel at the Feast of Tabernacles
[34:02] they made booths and then go sit in them
[34:05] outside
[34:06] well that's that's just a type that you
[34:10] and I are the in gathering we're coming
[34:12] into a place but you're bringing your
[34:13] you're bringing your booth with you
[34:16] you're bringing your booth and you're
[34:18] sitting you know you walk outside and
[34:20] you you take your booth to the world
[34:22] because what happens in the Jewish realm
[34:23] is you can walk out into a courtyard of
[34:26] somebody's house and there's all these
[34:27] boots well you know what they're doing
[34:30] all these feast is you when you're
[34:33] looking at them from if I'm looking at
[34:35] Lewis and Christine and they're doing
[34:37] one of the feast
[34:39] I'm seeing what they're doing so when
[34:42] you walk through the world folks
[34:44] that's why your written epistles Feast
[34:47] of Tabernacles feast of firstfruits all
[34:51] these things he's seen you that altar
[34:53] but you know what that all happened
[34:55] because of you
[34:57] he said what do you mean but the whole
[35:00] Bible was written for the bride the
[35:02] whole Bible was written to get us to a
[35:05] place to realize that who we are what
[35:08] we're doing here by what by these
[35:10] different journeys now remember these
[35:14] are not and we're not and never will be
[35:18] microwave journey
[35:21] one minute
[35:23] got Heat no it's a crock-pot so don't
[35:27] low
[35:29] if there was a real low it said on that
[35:33] one right
[35:34] I mean he's been in a long journey we've
[35:37] all been in a journey even if it's 20
[35:39] years that's a long journey well that's
[35:42] what it is it's what God is just you
[35:44] he's walking us through all these things
[35:46] he's letting us go through but you know
[35:48] what he's doing he's protecting us you
[35:50] need to believe that God is protecting
[35:52] you
[35:53] that you do have a guardian angel it
[35:56] took a prophet to guard to tell you
[35:57] you've got a guardian angel I remember
[36:00] anti telling a story when she flipped
[36:01] her car over because she's running too
[36:03] fast going around the curb that wasn't
[36:05] God that was but God was in there
[36:08] didn't you tell the story it felt like
[36:10] she's in a bubble what was happening
[36:12] that guardian angel had wrapped around
[36:15] her and he was taking the bones
[36:19] if you don't believe that you can't be a
[36:21] Christian I believe that
[36:25] almost got shot in the head with a 36 he
[36:28] wouldn't have been here today your parts
[36:29] of him wouldn't either
[36:31] right here
[36:34] right here that close when that thing
[36:37] went off well you know what the guardian
[36:39] angel daddy was reaching down like this
[36:41] and I don't know if you ever felt it or
[36:43] not but it doesn't matter but that angel
[36:45] just pushed his head back I
[36:48] just booked folks I believe it more now
[36:50] than ever that there's something guiding
[36:53] you and you don't have to be a
[36:55] middle-eastern six foot tall guy with
[36:57] his arms folded walk into a lot in your
[37:00] room
[37:02] don't have to be that but you gotta be
[37:04] leave just like to believe that Abraham
[37:07] believe when he saw Melchizedek what'd
[37:09] he say my lord brother Dennis appreciate
[37:12] he knew the presence of the Lord you and
[37:16] I must realize the presence of the Lord
[37:19] when it comes now there's a lot of times
[37:21] it's my own presence
[37:23] it's a lot of times it's your own
[37:25] presence but there's a lot of times
[37:27] though that God will slide in there or
[37:29] that guardian angel will go hey
[37:31] move over a little bit
[37:36] they'll never tell you wrong
[37:39] now you may do wrong because listen
[37:43] let me get this straight we have more
[37:46] power than the angels
[37:49] that's what I did a Christian has more
[37:52] power than the Angels
[37:53] cuz we're right there with God
[37:57] but they are given to us to lead us and
[37:59] guide us and then we have to make the
[38:01] choice just like we talked about this
[38:04] morning with Cain and Abel Cain her
[38:07] choice everybody's got a choice
[38:09] Ruth had a choice she I didn't decide
[38:12] then she had to go out in that field as
[38:13] she worked from daylight to dark she
[38:15] didn't do you win just a half way
[38:16] Christian
[38:18] right she wasn't a half way Christian
[38:21] she went out there in that hot field and
[38:23] she gleaned and finally Boaz she caught
[38:26] the attention of boys and Boaz they will
[38:29] help if she's gonna be out there let's
[38:31] give her a little more
[38:33] I'm gonna tell you something folks you
[38:36] look at this congregation
[38:40] and you tell me now there's one or two
[38:44] how this thing has affected you
[38:47] economically
[38:48] it has not affected me at all I'm
[38:51] working six days a week
[38:54] are you are you some of you know a few
[38:58] of you maybe but I'm talking about in a
[38:59] whole I'm telling you if you do what God
[39:03] says God is obligated
[39:07] obligated to do what he said doesn't
[39:11] matter you maybe everybody goes through
[39:13] a little rough place
[39:14] but you pay your tithe you go to church
[39:17] you do the little things
[39:23] I'm just saying I can see who's blessed
[39:26] brother Dale's always known who ties
[39:29] players and who's not and all cuz you
[39:30] you know how you see that God hates God
[39:33] has listened brother Brown said take God
[39:35] at what at his word
[39:37] God you said right here and you know
[39:41] what that ain't blaspheming when you can
[39:43] take God back to his word brother Bryan
[39:44] said God loves for you to remind him of
[39:47] what he's already said now Lord you
[39:49] promised me that if I paid my tithes
[39:52] you'd pour out the windows of heaven and
[39:54] I wouldn't be wanting for anything
[39:58] that's just some one little simple thing
[40:01] I've seen people blessed and what need
[40:05] Christians but they paid their ties
[40:07] because they thought that was an
[40:09] obligation they should do well you know
[40:10] what God didn't say if you're Christian
[40:12] or if you're not he just said if you pay
[40:14] your tithe
[40:16] listen God knows your heart if you'll
[40:18] come to church and do the things you're
[40:19] supposed to do God will take care of you
[40:22] he's never seen what is righteous
[40:24] forsaken or his seed begging for bread
[40:27] so this thing is not affected me at all
[40:30] and it's not affected most of you
[40:31] there's a fee and that's okay that's
[40:33] life stuff but look at the end we just
[40:36] keep going and then we'll get to the end
[40:39] and we'll go man I didn't miss know that
[40:43] that I thought I'd miss him
[40:47] amen
[40:49] we're seeing right now stuff that we can
[40:53] do without
[40:55] let me walk down now that we can do
[40:57] without that we didn't need to start
[41:00] with but we thought we needed before all
[41:01] this happening just put it in here
[41:04] whatever I have mine you have yours
[41:07] but Ruth walks through and Ruth proves
[41:10] who she is
[41:11] she gets out in that field as she works
[41:14] and you know what God notices
[41:16] Boaz turns and said who is that and
[41:19] that's a whole that's Naomi's
[41:20] oh that's my kinfoke
[41:23] course naomi was the kinfolk but when he
[41:26] looked at Naomi
[41:28] he looks a little passionnel and he sees
[41:31] a really pretty Gentile girl and sees
[41:35] that she's doing all she can to
[41:38] sustain herself
[41:40] so guess what
[41:43] when Ruth comes to the threshing floor
[41:46] and the lord of the harvest is laying
[41:47] there and she lays at his feet not
[41:49] trying to you understand what I'm saying
[41:51] not trying to make favors with him
[41:53] trying to get on his good side she lays
[41:56] as his feet at his feet as a servant
[41:59] Naomi said this is what you need to do
[42:02] and the prophet of God said Boaz just
[42:06] took the veil of took his bail and laid
[42:08] it over he says just like God takes the
[42:10] veil of the Holy Ghost and he says okay
[42:12] I'll accept you remember same thing with
[42:14] with Abraham now Abram Abram Abram now
[42:18] you're Abraham
[42:20] and he gives him a sign of circumcision
[42:25] because he's what he sees Abraham's
[42:29] faith
[42:31] he sees Abraham's faith that Abraham has
[42:36] faithfully done these things that you
[42:38] and I have faithfully done these things
[42:41] it's not easy to do a lot of things that
[42:43] we do I remember sitting I'm standing
[42:46] yesterday with a couple days ago me and
[42:49] June we're we have two mirrors well we
[42:52] actually look in the mirror but we have
[42:54] two mirrors and Jews over doing her hair
[42:57] and and and she looks at me and she says
[42:59] you've got about three hairs is her you
[43:01] know doing this and I'm making a point
[43:03] got about three hairs like this and I
[43:05] just reached over and got the scissors
[43:06] and we just took them right off and I
[43:10] said honey I'm sorry you can't do that
[43:12] and I was I was making I was sorry that
[43:15] y'all have more of your sisters you know
[43:17] something gets that a place Julie
[43:18] something gets out of place on Gary you
[43:19] just go you know slip it right off bless
[43:22] his heart
[43:23] but
[43:25] but but let's see we can't do that for
[43:29] y'all y'all have to kind of put and
[43:30] that's what I'm talking about the
[43:32] sacrifice that you make as females as
[43:35] the sisters but now remember a female is
[43:38] the type of the bride so the same thing
[43:39] with us we're all female so there's
[43:42] things that we can do and cannot do we
[43:45] can't snip them more wild hairs off we
[43:48] have to deal with them right new
[43:51] but you see what I mean about us
[43:53] everything we do through the life is
[43:55] typing if you can't see God in your life
[43:59] you do get morning in
[44:01] today I want you to go with nyla and go
[44:04] to a grave and lay that old person down
[44:07] and
[44:09] raising newness of life
[44:12] you'll never feel the same again
[44:15] so then what did what did boy I say look
[44:18] Ruth
[44:20] you can't get yourself morning in I
[44:24] wished my kids I could just say I want
[44:28] to mourning him but we pray for him but
[44:31] no boy I said you stay right here
[44:34] I've got to go do something
[44:37] I've got to go do the right of
[44:40] redemption
[44:41] you can't do it because you're not even
[44:43] the lineage
[44:45] Ruth had nothing she could only get she
[44:51] was a hurling connection was Naomi the
[44:54] old Jewish Church that's our connection
[44:57] Christ came to the old Jewish Church she
[45:01] turned him down
[45:02] there for a Gentile bride could come in
[45:06] but now he's not gonna forget Naomi
[45:08] because but because of Naomi because of
[45:10] all this
[45:11] you and I become perfected
[45:14] the Gentile the old Gentile bride we
[45:17] become perfected by looking back at
[45:20] these ones that were in the Old
[45:22] Testament the old Jewish Church but God
[45:25] doesn't forget it because what happens
[45:27] Ruth is rewarded by getting Boaz
[45:31] there's Bowl a standing there saying hey
[45:33] I'll redeem Naomi because remember he
[45:35] redeemed Naomi
[45:38] and got Ruth and then they became
[45:44] intimate and had a baby
[45:47] and through seven Church ages that
[45:50] baby's been growing and we're going to
[45:51] take that baby and we're gonna hand them
[45:53] back over to the old Jewish Church which
[45:56] is Naomi we're gonna hand Jesus Christ
[45:59] right to them and say this is what you
[46:01] missed
[46:02] and they're gonna say where did you get
[46:04] those scars
[46:05] where did you get those scars he said in
[46:07] the house of my friends in the house of
[46:09] in the house of Naomi in the house of
[46:12] Abraham and all these different ones in
[46:14] the Old Testament all the Old Testament
[46:16] you got Azra the blushing prophet is
[46:19] brother Bob was talking about all these
[46:21] different prophets in the Old Testament
[46:24] I think brother Dale preached on it
[46:26] several times a long time ago they all
[46:27] had fathers look at David man after
[46:31] God's own heart he ruled a country that
[46:33] I was reading to read through Kings and
[46:36] Samuel and basically Samuel see that God
[46:39] David didn't just do things now he did
[46:42] slip up one time with Bathsheba but you
[46:45] watch him every time the Philistines
[46:46] would come up he'd go to God
[46:49] he'd go to that urine thumbing or take
[46:51] the epod and he'd go in and say God do I
[46:54] need to go now because remember God said
[46:56] go up you'll take him off then one day
[46:57] he said no David you need to wait a
[46:59] little while see there was something
[47:01] going on same way with me and you we
[47:04] were sharing and saying god I want to do
[47:06] no
[47:08] because you know what he'll do he'll say
[47:10] well that's what you want to do you're
[47:12] not gonna be successful but David if
[47:15] you'll wait a little while then David
[47:16] goes back a couple days later says God
[47:18] are we gonna win this battle he said
[47:20] going up remember the bold berry tree
[47:21] and all those different things he said
[47:23] wait right here well that's the type of
[47:25] me and you and our battles sometimes God
[47:27] you go to God and God will say go on man
[47:29] I'm with you you go out there and you
[47:31] slay that whatever but sometimes he'll
[47:34] say hold on just a minute things are not
[47:37] exactly right and
[47:38] there was David a man after God's own
[47:41] heart and then to do what he did well he
[47:44] didn't have the Holy Ghost to God him he
[47:45] wasn't he was going through but now
[47:47] remember here we go again you look at
[47:49] the story and without Bathsheba this
[47:52] beautiful lady with no clothes on on top
[47:55] of a roof that David desired who came
[47:58] through that
[48:01] Soloman came through that
[48:03] another type of Christ coming down and
[48:06] ruling and reigning so you can't figure
[48:08] it all out
[48:09] you just have to realize I
[48:13] want to make this so simple
[48:16] there is four journeys in your life
[48:21] justification sanctification the baptism
[48:24] Holy Ghost and then going on and
[48:25] furthering the Word of God
[48:27] getting rewarded or placing or adoption
[48:30] look at Abraham he takes his son up on
[48:33] the hill but what does he do there he
[48:35] knows one thing for sure he's getting
[48:37] ready to stab his only child and God
[48:39] says nope I
[48:41] know now you know what he was saying
[48:44] Abraham you should know now that you're
[48:47] bid that you've got it we're not angel
[48:49] come from they stopped him
[48:51] he had to take on some solid form we
[48:55] always think of angels being something
[48:56] that can pass through a wall
[48:58] but he took on some kind of solid form
[49:00] because you reached and grabbed
[49:01] Abraham's hand that's what's going to
[49:03] happen with us sometime we're going to
[49:05] meet we've always said we are what we're
[49:08] the son of man in the end time well
[49:09] you're meeting God in human flesh
[49:13] every time you look at your brothers and
[49:15] look at your sisters and they're really
[49:17] true born-again Christians you're seeing
[49:20] God in human flesh you're seeing the son
[49:23] of man if we're a collective body of the
[49:25] son of man then that's what you're
[49:27] looking at
[49:30] Abraham couldn't do that sure he looked
[49:33] at Melchizedek and he said I don't know
[49:35] who you are but that person that was
[49:38] inside of Melchizedek couldn't come
[49:40] inside Abraham
[49:42] but when you meet him when you meet God
[49:45] and get the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[49:48] then that is God in human flesh and then
[49:51] you can do what then you can meet
[49:53] somebody else
[49:54] and recognize brother Graham says what
[49:57] give me two minutes for somebody I'll
[49:58] tell you where they got the Holy Ghost
[49:59] or not
[50:00] two minutes that's not even a good
[50:04] conference not even a good question
[50:05] conversation two minutes
[50:07] but let's look at the four
[50:09] combat beasts the lion ox man and eagle
[50:12] we know what that is the line was the
[50:13] first three Church ages they are was the
[50:15] middle church age the man was the next
[50:17] to church ages which was Luther and
[50:19] Wesley and the Eagle is obviously our
[50:22] age that we're looking at is everybody
[50:25] okay with that amen so then you had rude
[50:27] we won't go through all the we know that
[50:30] what Ruth was
[50:31] Naomi was the old church orful was the
[50:34] denominational Church roots was the
[50:36] Gentile bride and Boaz type of Christ
[50:38] because we're going to bring some other
[50:39] characters in just a minute and I'm
[50:42] going to just touch a minute on Esther
[50:44] and then we'll close all right so Ruth
[50:46] chapter 2 was serving roofs chapter 3
[50:48] was resting what Boaz had to go Christ
[50:51] had to go die
[50:54] to do the right of redemption but upon
[50:57] his death he turns around like I said
[50:59] before and he puts his feet on the
[51:01] ground out coming out of the tomb and he
[51:04] says this is mine I
[51:06] have come and I have captured death hell
[51:10] and the grave
[51:11] so at all what it takes me and you to
[51:13] believe that it takes me and then what's
[51:16] then what's God gonna do he's gonna
[51:17] reward us
[51:19] he's gonna reward us not by just giving
[51:22] us the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's
[51:24] gonna reward us by giving us more of
[51:28] that baptism of the Holy Ghost and a
[51:30] deeper walk with God not just a mindless
[51:33] walk with you look at people outside
[51:35] today they have no direction
[51:37] look at them they have no direction zero
[51:40] what are you gonna do I don't know what
[51:42] are you gonna do I don't know what are
[51:43] you gonna do
[51:45] and you know what they do they instead
[51:47] of going to God they go to pills and
[51:49] they go to alcohol and they go to all
[51:50] these different things that they go to
[51:52] and brother Brown said that that's what
[51:54] that satisfies the urge
[51:57] when what they're doing is is they're
[51:59] jumping right over Christ because he's
[52:01] standing there to give you a holy urge
[52:05] or holiness to live by and we're gonna
[52:09] see that in Esther in just a few minutes
[52:12] so everybody got that so far so good
[52:15] we're good so now let's look real quick
[52:17] I want to try to explain this a little
[52:19] bit more
[52:21] from last Wednesday now we look at the
[52:25] the two tribes and the half tribe
[52:28] we may not even get any extra we'll just
[52:31] do this right here any woman's clothes
[52:32] and we'll start on next Sunday
[52:34] but I want to get the characters down on
[52:37] extra so you can be thinking about it
[52:38] but look numbers 34 now let's just Moses
[52:41] now watch this is Moses the prophet of
[52:46] the day everybody got that say man this
[52:50] is Moses the prophet of the day that God
[52:54] has sent and listen God didn't send him
[52:57] to take him over
[52:59] or he would he took him over
[53:03] now Moses didn't know that but God knew
[53:06] he was gonna bring him right up to the
[53:08] border and he was gonna have to go off
[53:10] the scene and then Joshua
[53:13] was gonna take him across but before he
[53:17] left the scene say
[53:20] before brother Brian left the scene
[53:22] watch what he done I mean before Moses
[53:24] left the scene mm-hmm sorry
[53:28] and Moses commanded the children of
[53:32] Israel saying this is the land which you
[53:35] shall inherit by lot no watch which the
[53:38] LORD commanded to given to the nine
[53:40] tribes and a half drop
[53:42] all right
[53:44] for the tribe of the children of Reuben
[53:47] according to the house of their fathers
[53:48] and the tribe of the children of GAD
[53:50] according to the house of their fathers
[53:51] have received their inheritance and half
[53:54] of the tribe of manasseh have seve they
[53:56] receive their inheritance hold it right
[53:58] there just for a second so they got
[54:00] their inheritance first
[54:04] but look at me it's not a placing
[54:08] they were given inheritance on this side
[54:12] while the Prophet was still alive
[54:17] it had to take the Holy Ghost I mean
[54:20] sorry Joshua to take them on the cross
[54:23] okay the two tribes in the half tribe
[54:26] have received their inheritance on this
[54:28] side Jordan near Jericho eastward toward
[54:32] the Sun rising it wasn't in a bad place
[54:34] is it the rising of the Sun then Joshua
[54:38] commanded watching then Joshua commanded
[54:40] this is
[54:42] the officer the people say pastor the
[54:43] host this is actually we didn't redo
[54:46] that one brooks/cole don't know that's
[54:48] another scripture that's Joshua one
[54:50] right there hold it right there stop
[54:53] so what did Moses do Moses said look
[54:56] you've come to me and I've given you
[55:00] this side
[55:02] all right let's pull that chart up now
[55:06] remember the chart we had last Sunday
[55:08] they got it right here and I'm like
[55:11] brother I'm like brother Bob
[55:14] these guys got little places not very
[55:18] big look at my NASA
[55:21] but monaster had to carry on half of
[55:25] each tribe over here so if you got
[55:28] justification sanctification the baptism
[55:30] of the Holy Ghost that baptism the Holy
[55:32] Ghost had to carry on into here
[55:34] everybody got that you see what I'm
[55:37] coming man they had to carry on into
[55:40] here and then get a bigger portion no
[55:43] we get a bigger portion
[55:46] proper God tells us
[55:48] justification sanctification baptism
[55:50] hole goes Luther Wesley Pentecost and
[55:53] what do Pentecost - Pentecost was the
[55:55] bridge that got us across the river
[55:59] but remember just they had to go across
[56:02] Jordan and fight with the group of
[56:06] people what are you saying brother wait
[56:07] all that message that Moses had
[56:11] he didn't deliver it over here in the
[56:14] Promised Land but Joshua what did God
[56:17] say Joshua as I was with Moses so will I
[56:22] be with you so he had the mind of Moses
[56:28] in the people
[56:31] so when they crossed over half tribe
[56:33] went this all these went over and helped
[56:36] them fight it out what are you saying
[56:38] wait brother wait the Word of God is
[56:40] what's helping us fight the fight the
[56:42] thing out it's not people and it's not
[56:45] swords and shields and
[56:47] guns no it's the Holy Ghost
[56:51] we're going across we're taking
[56:53] justification sanctification the baptism
[56:55] the Holy Ghost the Prophet goes off the
[56:57] scene when during the Pentecostal age
[56:59] later on after the end of the age all
[57:02] right guys I got that
[57:04] so now what is this
[57:06] that's where we are at right now
[57:09] because these came back across and took
[57:12] up their position you'll never forget
[57:15] justification you'll never forget
[57:17] sanctification and you'll never forget
[57:19] the baptism of Holy Ghost what got you
[57:21] started because they're standing right
[57:23] here
[57:24] right here
[57:26] it's where Moses is looking across and
[57:29] he said okay you get this but there's
[57:33] more
[57:34] there seems to be open
[57:37] there's trumpets to be open there's
[57:40] Daniel seven new weeks all the great
[57:42] mysteries of God over in here that they
[57:44] didn't get over here
[57:47] they'd be okay with that this is where
[57:50] we are folks we've got justifications
[57:52] that catch the bathroom the Holy Ghost
[57:53] but that justification won't get you
[57:55] anywhere today it just gets you started
[57:57] into the body right there sanctification
[58:01] but you understand what I mean
[58:02] justification under Luther he could
[58:05] still smoke a pipe and drink a beer and
[58:07] talk about God God was pleased with that
[58:09] because he was only commissioned to show
[58:11] the just shall live by faith that was
[58:13] the revelation
[58:14] but that revelation couldn't keep him in
[58:17] over here it was a combination of all
[58:21] these when the Pentecostals come then
[58:22] what happened the prophet of God comes
[58:25] on the scene and through the Holy Ghost
[58:27] now through the Holy Ghost Moses is gone
[58:30] when they cross over in here Moses never
[58:33] went over in this promised land
[58:37] the prophet of God said I must decrease
[58:40] that he can increase who he Joshua
[58:43] Jehovah Savior
[58:45] Josh away Christ is the one that took
[58:49] him across
[58:50] into this promised land they fought it
[58:53] out got their position and then Luther
[58:56] drops right back here Wesley drops back
[58:58] here Pentecost drops back here but when
[59:00] the bride is going to go up this whole
[59:03] all of us this is all is going to be
[59:06] taken up but they weren't given
[59:09] what these people got they were a
[59:12] portion apart prophet of God says a dip
[59:15] of the Holy Ghost you know listen if you
[59:17] get a dip of the Holy Ghost that's good
[59:18] enough for me at the moment I said it's
[59:21] the moment because if you get a dip with
[59:23] the Holy Ghost it's all of God yeah but
[59:25] what happens is is you see that they
[59:28] decided and asked Moses Moses is sure
[59:31] you can stay under your messenger
[59:36] hello you can stay under your messenger
[59:39] but there's more to come
[59:41] under your messenger you're to be the
[59:45] final voice to the final age that's over
[59:48] here that's not over here we've come
[59:51] through Luther Wesley Pentecost now
[59:52] we're in the white eagle age we're in
[59:55] the age of what
[59:57] literally literally this is where we're
[1:00:00] gonna live when this is all over and
[1:00:02] done with
[1:00:03] we know that for a thousand years
[1:00:06] where's the Oh
[1:00:08] Jerusalem and Bethlehem all this right
[1:00:11] in here this is where the new city is
[1:00:12] gonna push up and make that pyramid
[1:00:15] mountain but during the Millennium I
[1:00:17] believe during the Millennium we're
[1:00:18] gonna live round here they're not gonna
[1:00:20] build that temple over here in Moab
[1:00:22] right they're gonna build it right here
[1:00:25] and that's where we're gonna live for a
[1:00:27] thousand years why because we fought it
[1:00:30] out here on this battleground not that
[1:00:33] battleground on this battleground
[1:00:36] listen why do you think they love that
[1:00:38] little you know if that was a world map
[1:00:40] that wouldn't even be
[1:00:43] maybe that big
[1:00:46] why is the world hate that place coach
[1:00:49] the devil hates that place he knows if
[1:00:51] he can get us out of that land
[1:00:53] he's got us
[1:00:55] but what happens Israel goes back to the
[1:00:58] promised land and now we're gonna see a
[1:01:00] little girl named Esther that
[1:01:03] she's gonna go through a journey to
[1:01:05] she's gonna be she's gonna be living
[1:01:07] with a guy that has the kingdom from
[1:01:09] over here in India all the way into
[1:01:12] Turkey back that way 147 provinces this
[1:01:15] God the Medes and Persians they own the
[1:01:17] whole world
[1:01:19] but the whole world bowed
[1:01:23] when Astor asked one question
[1:01:27] this little bride I'm telling you
[1:01:30] there's many many sure there's some
[1:01:32] powerful angel there's Gabriel there's
[1:01:33] all these different ones but when you
[1:01:35] get on your knees and ask God for
[1:01:37] something
[1:01:39] there's silence in heaven
[1:01:43] you must know that
[1:01:46] that you as the bride watch you know
[1:01:49] what
[1:01:50] the king has complete power
[1:01:54] right
[1:01:57] whatever he says that's the way it goes
[1:02:00] but
[1:02:01] if you look down through time there's
[1:02:04] always a queen
[1:02:06] and she's right there beside of him and
[1:02:10] sometimes he might ask her
[1:02:13] he might say what do you think about
[1:02:15] doing this
[1:02:16] because what's gonna happen in this next
[1:02:18] part that we see is that the King's done
[1:02:21] made a decree
[1:02:23] the King made a decree he wrote in this
[1:02:26] Bible everybody's gonna die
[1:02:29] get a little head of myself but right
[1:02:33] man as appointment to die it's appointed
[1:02:37] unto man to die and then the judgment
[1:02:40] well we're gonna read in here maybe next
[1:02:43] Sunday that the king makes a decree and
[1:02:46] according to the Medes and Persians you
[1:02:47] can never take it back so you can never
[1:02:50] take the Word of God out and take the
[1:02:53] pieces out but there was a provision
[1:02:55] made in that word and Esther said
[1:03:00] I know you said what you said but Haman
[1:03:04] is the one that did this the devil he's
[1:03:07] tricked you into doing this and he said
[1:03:10] when I've said I've said what I've
[1:03:12] written I have written
[1:03:14] but the little Queen walks up one day
[1:03:16] and says if I found favor in your side
[1:03:19] getting my people defend their self
[1:03:26] and he writes in a decree he says
[1:03:30] Israel can take up arms and defend
[1:03:34] itself and that's what saved the natural
[1:03:36] story that's why they have the the day
[1:03:39] of Purim or the time of Purim in even in
[1:03:41] Jerusalem now it's because Esther helps
[1:03:45] save because Haman was gonna decree was
[1:03:48] destroy everyone every Jew you see that
[1:03:51] same devil he was in Haman it just when
[1:03:53] Dame Hammond died it moved into Hitler
[1:03:56] when Hitler died has moved into
[1:03:58] everybody in the country buddy in the
[1:04:00] world that Devils not dying he's just
[1:04:02] moving different places but we'll see in
[1:04:04] here and let's let's look at this
[1:04:06] everybody understand that that's very
[1:04:07] important because you see you see other
[1:04:10] position they got our position we have
[1:04:13] to go through this journey
[1:04:14] but we have to cross over and we have to
[1:04:18] possess
[1:04:19] the land
[1:04:21] we have to possess what virtue knowledge
[1:04:25] temperance patience godliness brotherly
[1:04:28] kindness and the capstone which is love
[1:04:30] that's our possession
[1:04:32] but Joshua in verse one
[1:04:36] says remember which Moses rember the
[1:04:38] words in verse 13 which Moses I servant
[1:04:41] see remember you're reminded how many
[1:04:43] quotes his brother Dale read today four
[1:04:45] or five how many quotes I read one or
[1:04:46] two you're reminded of what Moses has
[1:04:49] told us
[1:04:51] saying the Lord your God has given you
[1:04:54] rest and have given you this land
[1:04:56] can you glean that from what you're
[1:04:59] reading
[1:05:01] or when you press play that's your
[1:05:04] inheritance that's your land that's God
[1:05:07] speaking to you telling you what he's
[1:05:10] already give you right
[1:05:12] it wasn't that God came up one day and
[1:05:15] said well I'm just gonna give you on
[1:05:16] this side of Jordan Norton's there's a
[1:05:17] whole time
[1:05:19] Abraham wherever the sole of your feet
[1:05:22] goes you're going to get that land
[1:05:24] and sure they've been driven off by the
[1:05:27] ice and this eye and that eye and all
[1:05:29] the other eyes
[1:05:30] but they had to fight and what happened
[1:05:33] was
[1:05:34] they come right in your wive's your
[1:05:36] little ones your cattle shall remain in
[1:05:37] the land which Moses give you on this
[1:05:39] side
[1:05:40] but you shall pass before your brethren
[1:05:42] armed
[1:05:43] listen if you don't have justification
[1:05:47] sanctification and the baptism of Holy
[1:05:49] Ghost you are not armed
[1:05:51] you say well not just the Holy Ghost no
[1:05:54] you can have the Holy Ghost every day
[1:05:55] your life and die and go to hell but you
[1:05:57] can't be truly justified truly
[1:06:00] sanctified and truly filled with the
[1:06:01] Holy Ghost and die and go to hell
[1:06:03] because that's inside the soul man
[1:06:06] the baptism of the Holy Ghost can be an
[1:06:08] anointing that comes on you and you can
[1:06:10] be just as religious as the next person
[1:06:12] and inside of you the prophet of God
[1:06:14] said be just as black as said
[1:06:17] but like I said before if you say all
[1:06:20] right I know where I went through
[1:06:21] justification
[1:06:23] okay I know I went through
[1:06:26] sanctification I know the unclean spirit
[1:06:27] I know I'm not doing the things I used
[1:06:29] to do I know God filled me with the
[1:06:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost and I've went
[1:06:34] further on with God into the placing in
[1:06:36] the promised land you can't you can't
[1:06:39] lose
[1:06:41] you can't then just have the Holy Ghost
[1:06:44] on your flesh are on your spirit if you
[1:06:47] go through truth listen the Bible says
[1:06:49] those who is justified he is already
[1:06:52] glorified
[1:06:54] alright everybody okay let's go through
[1:06:58] this one thing you know I want you to
[1:06:59] read if you wish the book of Esther
[1:07:04] mm-hmm but let's go to Esther and you
[1:07:07] don't have to do that just pull up one I
[1:07:09] got right here we're gonna go through
[1:07:10] the
[1:07:13] you scroll it up where it says Esther
[1:07:15] King because what's gonna happen is
[1:07:17] here's the other here's the players
[1:07:18] again
[1:07:20] didn't brother Brown said this relax of
[1:07:22] a boy mm okay so I wrote King King
[1:07:25] because the king is a king
[1:07:27] its King God's the king all right Esther
[1:07:32] is the top of the bride thanks ties the
[1:07:34] type of the church
[1:07:35] Mordecai's the type of the prophet the
[1:07:37] end time prophet and Haman is the type
[1:07:40] of the devil so we're gonna see the king
[1:07:42] of Soros he doesn't just have a little
[1:07:44] Kingdom he owns a hundred and twenty
[1:07:46] seven provinces from India to Turkey
[1:07:50] look at it on your map and he all I did
[1:07:54] own it but he ruled over every bit of
[1:07:55] that so he wasn't just a little
[1:07:57] rinky-dink king that was you know the
[1:08:00] mayor of guilt for
[1:08:03] Harlem
[1:08:10] but you watch what he does and you watch
[1:08:13] how this whole thing if you read your
[1:08:15] Bible
[1:08:17] because extra comes up and just to give
[1:08:21] you this background then we'll close
[1:08:22] right here it read even what Scofield
[1:08:25] says watch what Scofield I'm gonna read
[1:08:28] it right here real quick the
[1:08:29] significance of the book of Esther is
[1:08:30] that it testifies to the secret watch
[1:08:33] care of Jehovah over disbursed Israel
[1:08:37] all right now who are we we r type of
[1:08:40] we're type of it that type of Israel so
[1:08:42] we're a type of them the name of God
[1:08:45] does not occur one time
[1:08:48] but in no other book in the Bible is his
[1:08:52] providence more conspicuous
[1:08:55] now watch this if this ain't the time
[1:08:58] right now a
[1:08:59] mere rim that returned to Jerusalem if
[1:09:02] you'll understand this history they were
[1:09:04] dispersed they were driven out of Israel
[1:09:07] there was a small group stayed there but
[1:09:09] this group went way out somewhere where
[1:09:11] they're at now so watch but now look
[1:09:14] what's this
[1:09:15] doesn't it sound a lot loud to see the
[1:09:18] mass of the nation preferred the ease
[1:09:21] and lucrative life under Persian rule
[1:09:27] the mass of the nation preferred the
[1:09:30] easy and lucrative life under the
[1:09:32] Persian rule but God did not forsake
[1:09:35] them what was Laodicea easy
[1:09:39] rich have need of nothing and not us
[1:09:44] what he here does for Judah he is surely
[1:09:48] going to do for all the Covenant people
[1:09:51] so what's gonna happen is as Israel is
[1:09:54] in peril and there's this King that can
[1:09:56] you know there's this King that can back
[1:09:58] it up
[1:09:59] he's got an army he's got a hundred and
[1:10:02] twenty seven provinces and we're gonna
[1:10:04] look and see next Sunday let's go ahead
[1:10:06] and stand our feet and we'll bring them
[1:10:07] you and we'll get ready to go get ready
[1:10:10] to go have a burial
[1:10:14] but if you'll watch these you see a lot
[1:10:16] of 7s and threes and even bash time
[1:10:19] means beautiful you know how John looked
[1:10:22] at that
[1:10:23] church John looked at that church and he
[1:10:27] thought it was beautiful okay
[1:10:30] then you look and see that there were
[1:10:32] seven Chamberlain seven eunuchs that
[1:10:36] were
[1:10:37] attached to the king and number seven
[1:10:40] his name's carcass
[1:10:43] we're going somewhere with this
[1:10:45] alright and then bashed I refuses the
[1:10:48] Kings commandment
[1:10:50] sets up our own denomination
[1:10:54] then you've got a seventh messenger
[1:10:57] there are seven messengers under the
[1:10:59] king and they all know it none of them
[1:11:03] say anything except number seven
[1:11:06] ma'am you can't the only one that says
[1:11:08] anything he actually says hey King if
[1:11:11] you don't do something
[1:11:13] you're gonna have a problem later on so
[1:11:16] it's just it just continues down and
[1:11:18] even more to come means little man
[1:11:22] about five foot five five foot six
[1:11:24] little man
[1:11:26] and then you look at Esther whose first
[1:11:29] name was Hadassah
[1:11:32] which means Myrtle that was her Jewish
[1:11:35] name because remember she was hiding her
[1:11:37] name because they were kind of an
[1:11:39] outcast
[1:11:40] but she got a new name
[1:11:43] hmm she got a new name
[1:11:47] hey guy was the keeper of the women hey
[1:11:50] God means the word hold my boy it gets
[1:11:54] better and better but we'll talk about
[1:11:56] next Sunday
[1:11:58] sister Trudy called and said their water
[1:12:00] main pipe busted and their basement is
[1:12:02] flooded so we need to pray for them that
[1:12:05] that they'll get their water fixed and
[1:12:08] we know how that is the devil just tries
[1:12:11] his best to
[1:12:14] show his face but you know what he does
[1:12:16] this job but you know what God does his
[1:12:18] job too so we'll we'll pray for
[1:12:21] but God bless you it's a journey and
[1:12:24] answer and it's a long fight and it's
[1:12:27] not Chuck I said you may lose a battle
[1:12:29] but you're gonna win the war
[1:12:31] you may lose the battle every once in a
[1:12:34] while but the war's already won
[1:12:35] everything has already finished them
[1:12:37] it's over with and and we need to be
[1:12:40] more in touch brother I'm talks about
[1:12:43] spiritual
[1:12:44] happenings and he said spiritual people
[1:12:46] watch spiritual things so I think we're
[1:12:49] all being spiritual people we should
[1:12:50] watch even the little things like
[1:12:52] brother
[1:12:56] when he just died forgot his name thank
[1:13:00] you mom brother Collins she's only 78
[1:13:03] brother Collins
[1:13:05] that's an inside joke brother Collins
[1:13:08] and you it's all that tragedy but then
[1:13:11] when you look and see that the
[1:13:12] paramedics have to go we don't know what
[1:13:15] happened I mean they know that his heart
[1:13:17] stopped they know that but Howard I mean
[1:13:19] you could see him laying there's just
[1:13:21] like he was asleep he had no scars he
[1:13:22] had no bruises they said we don't know
[1:13:24] how this happened well you know what all
[1:13:26] of the believers there it wasn't we
[1:13:28] weren't on going no
[1:13:31] we know as soon as they she told me that
[1:13:34] story I I could just see I
[1:13:36] could just see the angels in the other
[1:13:39] dimension having a having to walk up and
[1:13:43] and just lower him down
[1:13:45] so that there could be a testimony and
[1:13:48] of all the different things that we have
[1:13:51] what a testimony what a mighty God let's
[1:13:54] sing a song
