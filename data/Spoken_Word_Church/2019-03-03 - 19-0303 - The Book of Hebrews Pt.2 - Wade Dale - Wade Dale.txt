TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and for us that is not oh no but that's that's for them they came here we've hadn't seen it crushed it over a little bit maybe a squirrel to run across it but not for a human to walk across that's for sure you know when you saw that picture one time of those boys playing on the iceberg back home in Newfoundland sure is our place you know when they won everything we're doing that in turn they don't but they were doing that in Duluth Minnesota when we were up there when I was with us in January the Lake Superior froze over and the kids just running out of crosses but wait anyhow they know what they're doing we don't do that bro no I don't want it to be - 1700 watt y'all we all said oh yeah that is true not going to be 17 or everything below I have work we're talking about the book of Hebrews but we got into a little something that I think we still need to be talking about just really understand God God who had many times and in many matters that I'm talking about here speaking times passing to the father's by the prophets remember that was the Old Testament has in these last days spoken to us last 2,000 years by his son now the last 2,000 years he's spoken to us in the form of what the Son of God because he was if we were talking last night at the Bible study for those of us that were here there was there was Christ came in three sons names but let me let me go over something else we though because we're looking the same thing right here because you got to start with the son of God that's the creator we talked about that's Jehovah that's God above us that's the spirit God right right alright then this same God comes to be for some man which is flesh and this we're going to put spirit we're going to do like the you know the UH the Jewish people did they do not spell the word God right it's G - D that's they can't they so holy they can't write so they're just gonna put G so we're gonna do G / D so the Son of God spirit god son that's West gun then he comes back this man leave this man leave this flesh man leaves this man comes back yes in the church ages that's the son of God back to what spirit God which is the Holy Ghost and the believer there all right with that Lucy don't know you you can't see that okay so what Jesus was truly telling us he said I came from God and I'm going back to God so anyway telling them story telling truth you and I'm saying why don't watch you not saying why we we come down here where the Word made flesh if we have got excited yes so we come from God theophany yes we come from theophany God we come down here in human flesh now who are we going you said I won back the flesh no there's people in another realm right now that's not in their human flesh they're in the sixth dimension waiting on us to bring again this man the man in the end time the seals hands don't remember this right here was right here but it was what it was rejected so what was rejected being that it was rejected it did not come here and this is your seven churches all right candlesticks that's what he's saying here dot in many times the many matters but under father's by the prophets we're right here now God did say son of man prophesy but if you'll watch in your reading sometimes there'll be a little s only when he's talking to zekiel Ezekiel was a son man you wouldn't need some man with a stunt man talking to a group of people but if you'll notice here once awhile read The Book of Ezekiel mentally insane Son of Man and it'll be half the less it won't be the first part of the sentence and if you'll really get to digging in you'll see that that was God talking not Ezekiel talking that was God doing the speaking all right but nobody can because of that tell the son of God the spirit god this is Jehovah God above us God with us God in us but we get a special part because that this does not need a body change this does not need any kind of redemption it is the Redeemer right this is the Redeemer that's why we look and we see in Revelations 5 the lamb takes the book jehovah sit on the throne live the book in his hand why because he has what is the book the book is a book of names of all the redeemed believers bride not foolish virgin 144,000 not in that section now there's many sections of the look ok you may have to go over that I've been thinking about the winning revelations a pretty sermon long time ago called the book of books if you'll remember that and that's what we are worth a buck now what contain what's contained in the book is all the believers but there's one section that this lay on tape because brother Branham says in Revelations 5 that the lamb comes out from behind the throne he is in the church age is doing his intercessory work so he's coming out from the search ages what is John John says John the bad news I'm trying to get to John the Bagginses behold the lamb of God takes place in the world then John the Revelator go through nations 5 and he says the the tribe of Judah has overcome and he turns and when he turns he don't see a line he sees a lamb that was the lamb the lamb was the son of man flesh does that lay on that flesh on it all right nobody got that it's not confusing in then after this because this is the headstone he comes back in the form of the Son of Man in the seals to give us a body change so this guy doesn't this guy doesn't need a body changing I'm not saying this gun versus that God it's the same guy know the position Jehovah's then he didn't need a body saying he's eternal God he's the one who said let there be with this person in more feet into this person not two people he more feed into that person not not in went into that person yesterday one family anyway he anymore be into the person he would be a more begin to that person so he was revelation was Jehovah then the lamb comes remember in the church ages it's a Gentile Church age really Jehovah doesn't have anything to do with then in the form of Jehovah I thought it was gone above us God with us now is God in us Jehovah's not back up their hand right Jehovah is now in more feed into the people and that book the lamb takes this book of the believers and taking the book that's the opening of the sealed so we must become the son of man in a collective bride form to take the book and then what do we do we take a rapture right right here this doesn't rapture this tractor this was what was missing from the church this was a this is what was missing from the church the body changed the revelation that when he walked how that tenses all how in heaven there's been given unto me but now then this man when he leaves this one comes back and see you got several you gotta look at because he comes back as the son of God to who 144,000 he's not coming to the Son of Man to them kaleil gotta die all right and he's not bringing them to a position of right they lost that remember we preached that long in the force field we they lost he divorced him he can't marry him back but he can't take them in and make them sons and daughters of God indeed what in the form of the 144,000 right now bride they're not right all right so then so then he in the Millennium he comes as the son of David I want to throne a literal throne judging the twelve tribes of Israel just like they were talking last night three travel on this side three on this side three on this side and three on this stuff okay that's the Millennium temple you got gone in the middle with the bride all right and then you've got three you got three three three and three which is 12 times 12,000 trial 12,000 each trial 144,000 and as we were saying last night I don't have a quota for it but I just have the Bible does not there's no way that that a person a man head of a household them you got a man and two kids that God's going to rapture that one man and leaving mother three now the wife I might see but you got to remember go back to numbers that's why they call it the Book of Numbers it's because God numbered the people that's where your numbers come from if you want to see how many drive people then traveling come any number Don one time when there was over 600 and something I told you last night 600 something thousand men above the age of 20 they never documented females and little children so in the high 44,000 to me is 144,000 men and if they have families will I don't understand about the wife but I promise you one thing God's not gonna take them and leave a five year old or an eight year old or seven year old there's going to be a hundred forty four thousand males come IV males were never number soil be hundred forty four thousand plus but it's going to be a hundred forty-four thousand men that received the Holy Ghost the message of the two prophets coming under the son of God revelation because what is the son of that revelation Jesus died coming died in you in place but you're singing yes now you will you can put that in the son of man - but there's some thoughts the Holy Ghost that's what they receive they receive the Holy Ghost [Music] just like you an idea of anything but remember our position in their position our position we're virgin bride they're not virgin anymore cuz they went out playing the part of the harlot and God can't take them back cuz he came once you defiled you can't be come back alright it's revelation the word love it no it's just like we were talking about last night everybody's regulation that revelation is in degrees we were talking about the fullness and I didn't make this statement but I'll make it now if you have the new birth you're full of God because your whole soul is God there's not a little speck of it that's not but now there's a lot of people leaving the graves that we're all of God but they need a body change so they're not all of God that we have the old gun okay they have a portion just like the ocean just like this cup of coffee I hope cup of coffee but that little drop is the same thing it's what's in that whole cup in America it's a million gallons that one drop right there has the same what's good the same ingredients that's what's in the whole ocean but they're not the whole ocean you and I are the ocean Luther was the drop member brother Ramsey took the dip into the Holy Ghost well it is all adultery and Luther was full of the Holy Ghost right hey what part Holy Ghost he was full of the Holy Ghost but now in this bare ground he was not full to the fullness you and I are the only ones that's gonna be the fullness in our spirit realms and in our in our soul they won't be no no no they've only got three and a half years the book of the book of come on Brandon Zachariah will tell you when they reveal this man Jesus to the hundred forty-four thousand they are going to go in their house separate from their parents separate from their kids separate from everybody they're going to wail for four days just because they realize that you know what they're thinking oh my god we killed me we kill the Messiah the one minute we're looking for we kill me work in other words we're cut off but what does the Bible say no just like Joseph will happen the Joseph when he revealed himself to his brothers that had put him in a pit he revealed to him they said first thing we're gone we're done we're Danny Jones did another no-no if you haven't done this we couldn't him past seven years of good to be with this seven years of bad you God did this to preserve us and you okay that's the same thing he's gonna reveal come to hate God took the Gentile bride they're gone but I'll come back for you because I can't forget you because you got to remember those those two prophets will have to come preaching the Old Testament first they're gonna have to see Christ come out of that Old Testament they can't just walk up and say brother Brown upset right Sam in other words the first thing we'll care cuz we're the Browns not their prophet but now when they see the Moses analyzing ministry come out of them two people they're gonna go hang man we know the ends near because he lives us here okay but what's going to happen to all another jewelry are Israel jewelry not jewelry jewelry is there going to condemn them 144,000 till this because they didn't come to them because what happened when Christ came to the Jews caucus didn't believe it because caucus didn't come to him and say I'm them something brother beretta makes that many many times he makes an analogy that the reason counts them didn't believe who he was it's coach they thought well this watch Messiah is gonna come he's gotta come right here build a temple he's gonna come right here to me and tell me who he is well he did he did and they missed it alright so I hope that helps for this Lexington book of Hebrews demands just if you know Romans was wonderful but I believe Hebrews ties a lot to us coming out of the Old Testament because what's gonna happen is we're gonna get further into this he's gonna revert back to Abraham he's gonna revert back to Moses Hebrews eleven is full of all the Old Testament Saints so there might give this Sun God is Jehovah the one X student said let there be theophany God our spirit died then for four thousand years he continues as that through the Old Testament they're 4,000 years of Old Testament right the very okay with a from there's 4,000 years of Old Testament from Genesis to Malachi then there's about four hundred years that there's no prophets remember and then a virgin shall conceive came forth and then now son of God I mean so God has went into flesh and resided he didn't just know he remember he would have known a flesh and then he would I was thinking that's the other day-to-day that Joshua was the top of the Holy Ghost Moses was kind of of another worse he wasn't he was one that brought him out but he couldn't take them in the Holy Ghost same way brother rambro a layout they needed to come out but he couldn't take me and they didn't take him in and thought that he was wrong but he had a position to fulfill he prophesied he was a prophet but Joshua was commissioned to take us in as I was with Moses so I will be with you and Joshua is the holy ghost of this day and that Holy Ghost came to bring us a revelation because brother Graham cannot give you revelation brother Dale can't give you revelation I think you know I can give you a revelation except that guy right there because what did this man say this man nobody understood while he was here totally misunderstood but he said when he the Holy Ghost has come in other words you'll understand what I'm saying to you you may not understand the man standing here but you sure well understand what I'm saying to you and I'm going to be on my church on that yes because truly the rep the church is not built on the seal the church is not built on Dan stammen weak she's not a built on the church is built don't believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved that's what the church is built on that's the common denominator from this church journey to this church a right because remember he said well no it's the baptism and all that no remember that baptism went away about right here right God went into ignorance of man but still believe don't know he's cross enough shall be saved Martin Luther believed on the Lord Jesus Christ and he was saved yet he was still a Trinitarian and did Trinitarian things hey if I got that yes so the basis from from the first church age to even our church age even right now believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saying now you gotta keep going on to receive the Holy Ghost that's a requirement but it's in major okay it's in measure the Holy Ghost is in measure read the Bible but I will tell you it's in measure alright so now we got we got this gun this is all one man this whole plan is based on one man all right and as brother Dale was talking last night I'm gonna add just a little bit to it he's gonna preach the sermon and it's gonna be really you'll really understand it because one day all that's gonna terminate one day all that's going to go away look look why do you need to over is really glorified body in an eternal place the title not the person the title okay we need a lamb dances over weight you need to whole ago you are the whole to go why you need to seal the nets don't you don't you are oh and of course this Donuts evolved to us but still remember this son of David only is in time it's only during to 1,000 years of the Millennium then that goes away so they won't be on the lingam temple in the new the future home the future home is our place to live God builds it now they might build something outside that's fine with me but the Millennium we build and inhabit us what the Bible said in the future home it's already built it's already done read your future homeless once if you refute your home you can get a lot of documents straightened out just about doing that so what's gonna happen is all these tiles are gonna go away because you don't need redemption after your either you're fully redundant listen you don't need to pray anymore then you do now you understand what I'm saying but but we're not gonna be what are we going to pray for in a glorified body right you there's nothing to brag for you tell me some of the pray for what we pray for our loved one will know not when that happens cause remember redemption is over when you can avoid if I body it's done whatever the way to treat it is go right so that prayers over will there'll be no suffering no sorrow no pain no thinking about bad things one more thing to pass away be told all things to be new so all that will terminate that he will be one person sitting on the throne and us in the city with him and then all the other outside the city will be listen they're so good there's gonna be still a sting come up the road today politics is rotten but government's not yeah the government is on his shoulder if he sits on the throne is the son of David ruling the twelve tribes there's got to be government there if the Bible says in Revelations that the Kings will come in and bring a king that's gotta have some hits drill over so there will be but it won't be like here it won't be like here we got to get on Rohan because when you first thing you say well the king you know he's no but they will be positioned there will be governments outside the city we don't need it it's going to be a lot different than what we think it's gonna be I believe yes I mean we're not going to lose our humanity still human will be able to go outside and walk through the garden I believe that plan will have to we do in a millennium because the sex will plan remember the Bible says we'll plant and harvest and then we'll build a house but we won't give it to our son because it's not a genealogy or general cuz I'll build my house to leave it to Josh just leaves in the storm you don't do that in Millennium there's nothing to leave it to this what I'm telling you things are going to be just totally over when we go in Iraq or when we think about a tank going after there's no need for anything for us anymore it's all good tell me something else we need more work no you are gorg we need more work for ya we'll get ya we'll get a message of cheer down through the ages but what it is that the message of chair is is going through the center that's being given eternal life because of you and your message to him is is this is why you missed it and this one happened and this what Christ died to save me and through me you came in and that's a message to cheer thank about the old man sure we know who that man is on the drum we never will forget that we're sure yeah will worship Him yes but there won't be remember there is no temple then they don't charge church is done there's not even gonna be a temple there brother brother Brown will tell you that and eat your home and even the Bible tells you there's no temple in the left last year let's go to revelations [Music] it is about 20 will start at 22 let's just we just read this right here and he showed me a pure river water blob clear the crystals presenting from the throne of God and from the lamp in the midst of the street of it neither side of the river was their Tree of Life bare twelve manner of creeping on and there should be no more curse but the throne of God and the lamb shall be in it and his servants shall serve Him and they shall see his face and his name shall be in their forehead there shall be no night there they need no candle and them the light of the Sun for the Lord giveth them lot less your reign for ever and ever keep going on there is a place where it says there will be a temple neither selling the throne Oh make all things new a mountain when the me going in well we read up later but brother branham tells you and he says look he stood a single been temple in the future home there is a temple in the Millennium you can read that read that Ezekiel 42 44 but here there's not there's no Leah stating mystic sector before this verse 22 written and I saw no temple there you know thank you and you other than there somewhere all right let's go back Hebrew so God it's not anytime they just want you to understand it that and not saying this but I any means to Paul was a prophet yes the Paul wasn't I wrote this why I just wrote on this board no he knew this man was but all the positions he didn't know that that's why that's why you and I are not a bunch of know-it-all but we need this to prepare us for anything Satan has the brain right that's what the word does to me the word to me answers and satisfies questions because I have a question now don't you mean - I have a question that I can't walk through that wall line cuz my human mind goes well you're solid where are you this way yours does too I can't do this because now Jesus didn't have that I can't do this because when he got out of the tunnel okay no he just walked right on through just like you wouldn't in black all right well that's the same what's gonna happen to us so God look sometimes dogs manners will never get through the book Hebron hath in these last days spoken to us by his son which is the son of God who has appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the world's so that worked the Christ the Son of the Living God now the Creator the Creator Garko he wasn't just Jesus there was many Jesuses in that date as many hey juices in this day but there was only one Jesus Christ and then we give him the title because remember become a baptism no I in the Bible they were baptized Lord Jesus Christ it was either Jesus name or Jesus Christ his name but brother Branham said we give him his lordship and baptize him and they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that give him all this time okay but baptizing in the name of Jesus Christ is fun come that's what the Bible says now yeah be careful because one place it says baptized in Jesus name that's where the Jesus name people baptized didn't they just say well baptize you Jesus no no Lord Jesus Christ give him the whole title and and gives him possession of you just want to bring that out because you can't find Lord Jesus Christ in the Bible they say no Jesus Christ or Jesus name half of these last days spoken to us by his son whom an appointed heir of all things who Jesus Christ by whom also he made the world who being the brightness of his glory and the Express image of his person in other words when this person right here the first person we talked about them in the Sun God if you were standing there in a expose Brendan said a panorama you would see you don't have a picture Jesus you see Jesus standing there 90 50 years old but you will see Jesus standing there at 20 years old it's time that we got old but that's what you would see because you don't see a different person he these press image of his person if you've seen me you've seen the father now be lying if he's saying I'm something different than my father you've seen me you've seen the father all right this would be the brightest of exploring this press image of this person see this is the problem that that people had and you see the Catholic Church pick it up you see the brightness of his glory no I would assume since the devil did this I would assume that the devil told countless look when this Messiah walks in the door he's gonna have this halo around his head he's going to have this glow emanating from his body because then every Catholic statue or whatever you want to see there's either a halo or there's some kind of fuzzy something around right he was missing that Jesus that was the whole problem he was God revealed in human flesh he didn't need a halo around his head all right or when he walked in a room we just all lit up no he wasn't human man but that was the problem and then like I said when he came to church picks it up every time you see Jesus he's got this halo leaving now they got married with the halo and Jesus with the little thing you know no pelo on his head I don't believe when Jesus was born that was the halo around his head no you got to know who he is not by the signs right not by the Sun you got to know about what in your heart all right so so this is this is God Jesus was the expert the son of man with the expression of God God always wanted to live in human flesh he always did the Express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power in other words what Jesus said to God when Jesus said some of the father didn't don't know I mean that no they were the same person so you can't think too difficult and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sin that remember the son of God the Son of God in the son of man is what cleansed us remember Isaiah 53 52 53 just relieved that report he gave a solo ransom so the soul of God is this the flesh of God is this this is the ransom this is the lamb yes I forgot that he gave his soul a ransom the soul of the Son of Man was another guy before Abraham was I am this wasn't that wasn't right if I got that so the Son of God wasn't ransom he gave us all a ransom so he could see a see not seen natural seen spiritual but he had to come into the land to give his life because remember who took your strives not this person this person did right the lamb took it was a bloody lamb the lamb took your stripes yes the stomach God never had straps he because that's what we got to go back to this never found that he didn't fall but he come into sin he wasn't sinful but he came into sin to redeem us back to here he gave his soul a ransom in this dimension okay because it's easy for one man to die for another but he will totally ransom his soul so that's all we come back into you me given my life for brother Bob would be very commendable I get a Purple Heart it'd be more than that Allah but I did and I can't come back in Bobby making better but if this man come into this man became this man gave his life to ransom your soul and my soul and he didn't just ransom her soul he made us his soul so I came from God me the lack of done that's what you and I are going to do right now right and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sin he purchased it by what dye don't cross me I said he didn't say son of man can save anybody while he's on earth he did not weigh all of the thief on the cross he took him to paradise he didn't take him to the sixth dimension doing in the paradise actually the person we were talking about last night Stephen was the first person recorded person that died martyr and his soul went into the sixth dimension I said recording may have been another but I think even brother Brown said Stephen was the first martyr being the first martyr he died he went into the sixth dimension which I purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high what'd he do he went up and like Stephen said I see what I see the son of man sitting on her understanding he wouldn't say and he was sick on the right hand of the Father why he came back into his authority he came back into his power right he came back into his power which is all power teller has been giving up the man when he was down here the son of man sure he had control over this but did still die okay but when he came out it was transformed that's what we've got to say that transforming Connor that transformed us here not waiting we'll get into that a little bit this afternoon about tribulation that's why people without the new birds have to go through the tribulation brother Brown said that's their cleansing part they have to give their life because they don't have the life of God inside of them because he's already racks them in you if you're born again today you don't go to hell you know you don't have to worry about the second death right being made so much better than the Angels as he has by inheritance and obtained a more excellent name than they see because the inheritance who got the inheritance not this guy father's give inheritance he gave his inheritance to that flesh of the son of man phone all right if I got that that member brought I read the quote many times brother I said God Jesus Christ inherited the eternal life in his spear in his of flesh didn't have to in its own this and it's and it's buried but his flesh had to be redeemed it had to be made eternal and in being made eternal that's our inheritance that our body can be made eternal obtained a more excellent name than they what then what the Angels he became look he was right here and then you got angels then you got some man he became lower than the Angels yes but now it says here at sea so but now remember the other students who said he became what he came down here lower than the Angels but he was better than the Angels because he got an inheritance they don't get an inheritance he got an inheritance for coming down here to being lower but his name has become higher because the Angels now understand I don't know whether they didn't understand before but I know one thing's for sure brother Brown said in the Bible tells you they do not understand the plan of redemption cuz they never fail and we're redeemed some of them failing they were came back for some of them they don't understand retention they have to be quiet it could be something to is half-hour silence never for the which of the Angels said he at any time thou art my son so you know the angles were his son no no angels are not humans and humans are not brother branham explained that somebody asked him will we be angels over there he said you're a human angels are not human listen even even Satan's not a human all right Brenda which of the Angels said he at any time thou art my son this day have I begotten thee surely didn't ever say that to an angel but he did say to you and me and again I will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son in other words the angels are took them taken out of the equation his father's an son father and son and again when he bringeth and the first begotten into the world not who was that who was the first begotten our firstborn Jesus Christ into the world he said and let all the angels of God worship me what happened on the day that he was born the angels come to the Shepherd's and said Behold right right angels announced a program said in heaven I mean that's an owner come sorry and of the Angels he saith who made is he thanking spirits and his ministers a flame of fire but unto the son he saith thy throne O God is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom let's see what that word means in him we'll leave we'll get out of here what do that works let's see what to just see a sticker a wine a rod the staff a walking stick a branch one to lean upon so what is that it's a staff we'll cover that next Sunday actually just doing next Sunday I want beer next Sunday it was last oh no you're doing [Music] somebody else okay then the next one who we say in the next one was is your turn yeah you Bob just done is giving that believe so be nice I am that time on the next time
