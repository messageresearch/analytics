[0:00] good to be back in the house yeah
[0:06] talking about a lot of a new mother they
[0:09] keep back and I see you you're not doing
[0:11] well keep running prick
[0:13] that's all I find even though we don't
[0:14] even know what you bumped it all right
[0:36] so now we're almost ball today we're on
[0:42] the 6000 scale one more time we're gonna
[0:44] do the six zero once again look at
[0:47] what's going on with the state c up
[0:49] standard and then whale love then with
[0:53] all of them
[0:53] I want to take a gap like the property
[0:57] any kind of stop and then next time you
[1:01] may do something a little different a
[1:03] little special a little thing before we
[1:04] start into the Seventh Seal or we may
[1:06] stop here and just continue upstairs and
[1:08] then run it all the way to here and then
[1:10] we'll do it all if they will see so
[1:11] we'll see what the Lord has but
[1:14] continuing on for those of you that work
[1:16] your wings you're a bit less and the
[1:17] winds near was here whatever wins the
[1:20] night we started on the foundation for
[1:27] the seals to speak on them upstairs so
[1:29] if you have not listened to easy not
[1:32] service please do because it was faster
[1:36] it was a good foundation for you to to
[1:40] to understand what we're doing I mean
[1:43] you just say well here's the seal here
[1:44] and that's what that's all back that
[1:45] we've been doing is here's the seal and
[1:47] here's the part that's up under it we're
[1:49] going to cover a little of it but we'll
[1:51] cover more of it upstairs and we're
[1:53] going to stay on the foundation for a
[1:56] while so before we get into the first
[1:58] seal so let's read this I saw when the
[2:02] lamb opened one of the seals and I heard
[2:04] it was the noise of thunder one of the
[2:06] four beasts saying come and see
[2:08] I start before Whitehorse and then we
[2:11] know
[2:11] what happened to him another horse that
[2:13] was red dirt steel was white the black
[2:16] horse
[2:17] the for steel was the pale horse all
[2:22] right and then the fifth seal remember
[2:25] the fourth seal the rapture takes place
[2:27] on the fourth seal so the fourth seal is
[2:31] the rapture seal now I always thought
[2:33] maybe the Seventh Seal was around to
[2:34] seal but it's not seven seals Christ but
[2:38] the four seals a raptor seal each one of
[2:40] these seals I was talking about the club
[2:42] the other night on the phone or actually
[2:44] when we're out there and he's been going
[2:46] through the seal some and highlight them
[2:49] and and each one of them has a different
[2:51] characteristic and we'll talk about that
[2:52] won't you name it seals but the fourth
[2:54] seal has to be the rapture seal because
[2:57] that's when we take graphic it's on the
[2:59] fourth seal all right we take a body
[3:02] change and everything happens right in
[3:03] that fourth seal it's like what I like
[3:05] again I'm studying more now like William
[3:08] was talking about last Sunday that comma
[3:12] that comma was 2,000 years that comma
[3:17] represented 2,000 years in church ages
[3:20] or whatever there was of time it was in
[3:23] the comma and like a Randy our last on
[3:25] Wednesday night that one scripture in
[3:28] Compass's the whole church ages from
[3:29] crop before it starts to the time that
[3:31] it ends in just one three four words
[3:32] that's why these that's why now I can
[3:35] see more that the Word of God is eternal
[3:36] one word you take one word or one phrase
[3:40] or even that comma which is a lot of
[3:43] commas of cause we're going to continue
[3:45] this all the calls ferment just thinking
[3:47] about what's going on and then continue
[3:49] on so that's what we were looking at to
[3:52] Wednesday night is that the seal
[3:55] breaking showed what that seal was and
[3:58] that's what we've been covering but
[4:00] there's an underlying meaning to every
[4:02] bit of the man there's a there's a
[4:04] revelation we'll talk about this
[4:05] afternoon despite the revelation the
[4:08] Prophet said though there is a
[4:10] supernatural element that's underneath
[4:12] the revelation you say how do you know
[4:15] that well when when the Lord revealed
[4:17] one God to you it was a simple
[4:19] God want Jesus in God's the same person
[4:22] but now did they stop there no it did
[4:25] not stop there
[4:26] it brought everything and to me in that
[4:32] one guy to me one God is is it's all
[4:34] through the Bible right so being the one
[4:40] God is always through the Bible then the
[4:42] first seal property God said if one
[4:44] steal can time the entire Bible together
[4:46] well I can see that more now than ever
[4:48] it's not just a quote and we'll read
[4:51] some of this afternoon where brother
[4:53] Brown said the Bible became a brand-new
[4:54] book well now I thought he just preached
[4:56] to seal revelation 6 through 8 right
[5:03] they know when he preached in the seal
[5:05] well that's not the whole book but he
[5:08] said the whole lotta became a brandy but
[5:10] why did he say that well because it tied
[5:13] the rest of the Bible together
[5:15] yes just like in the water baptism the
[5:19] other Sunday speaking on there there was
[5:20] some things in it that I mean everybody
[5:22] knows the baptizing them Lord Jesus
[5:23] Christ was that's just saying look read
[5:25] this brother I said that's just the
[5:27] ability to read it's playing let's
[5:30] repent and be baptized in the name of
[5:32] Jesus Christ but one one cup bottle sex
[5:36] oh yeah I can take that to the point but
[5:39] I ain't gonna take it all the way Bible
[5:40] says the Bible says the stone to stone
[5:43] the God that all right
[5:46] the Bible says cut the hand off that the
[5:49] Bible says an eye for an eye yeah okay
[5:52] jesus said eat my flesh and drink my
[5:54] blood see them come out so there's an
[5:57] underlying meaning there we and taught
[5:59] me another day was on like the other day
[6:01] truly most people in the message have
[6:04] they have a top-level revelation they
[6:06] never around said the seal of them but
[6:08] remember that's just the ability to read
[6:10] and put scripture together yeah
[6:13] revelation 6:1
[6:14] is a mighty angel or the angel come and
[6:18] says come and see John and one still
[6:19] open a while
[6:20] right now well even people you know
[6:23] that's where people that leave the
[6:25] message they said well Clarence Larkin
[6:26] thought that Clarence Larkin might have
[6:28] talked out but he didn't have a message
[6:30] behind it right your revelation I mean
[6:34] miami-based people got together here we
[6:36] go back to the narrow minded people this
[6:39] message they're so narrow-minded and we
[6:41] are too to a point we get so
[6:43] narrow-minded but we get set in this one
[6:45] way and blind everything else just like
[6:48] the seal well the seal is opened in 1963
[6:50] that's all there is greatest message the
[6:54] Prophet ever preached and it's just
[6:56] laying there on paper no there's
[7:01] something missing that we're not getting
[7:02] because I think when he said right from
[7:05] faith lies in the books and the tape so
[7:08] if he live in the books in the tape that
[7:10] means it's laying there waiting for us
[7:12] to bring it out because I'm telling you
[7:16] and I'll tell you this afternoon we are
[7:18] that seal group of people that brother
[7:22] Brown talked about in questions and
[7:23] answers and I'll prove it this afternoon
[7:25] I touched a little bit on it Wednesday
[7:27] but I'll prove it this afternoon where
[7:30] it was not meant for it even 10 years
[7:33] ago certain group people yes a certain
[7:37] group people now come on everybody 10
[7:39] years ago 20 years ago 30 years ago it
[7:43] wasn't meant for them a man my brother I
[7:46] said it wasn't meant for them and that
[7:48] was 50 years ago okay say it's gone from
[7:51] Ian and then he said this is that third
[7:53] pull and then if you type close together
[7:55] where brother arms of the third pull is
[7:56] laying dormant it's laying there it's
[8:00] not being used except in a spiritual way
[8:03] me and brother club become a good point
[8:05] because it can be used and it's always
[8:08] used in the like adoption we all every
[8:11] one of us revelations eight what is it
[8:15] 14 says we received the spirit of
[8:18] adoption whereby we cry daddy daddy cry
[8:22] that's a baby once you're born into the
[8:24] family you are under the
[8:25] terms of adoption now that doesn't mean
[8:27] you go to adoption not everybody is
[8:31] gonna make a good option right they hear
[8:34] you him the sword in the hand we'll talk
[8:36] about this afternoon her brother ran
[8:37] with the sword in hand to me was the
[8:38] adoption of brother Branham it was
[8:40] giving the word to the Prophet and
[8:43] saying here whatever you say that's
[8:44] what's gonna happen cuz the sword he
[8:46] said fit my hand perfectly so that's the
[8:50] same way with us to be we all are under
[8:53] the spirit of adoption because once
[8:56] you're born into the family you get all
[8:58] the family benefits now you may not get
[9:00] up all the authority you know you may be
[9:06] you may be three sons and they're all
[9:08] three sons so in other words they're all
[9:10] three born-again sons and daughters of
[9:12] God but one acts different than the
[9:16] other one free moral agency I believe
[9:20] that because the Bible says grieve not
[9:22] the Holy Spirit of God we grieve the
[9:24] Holy Spirit so much until that we may
[9:27] not make it to adoption but that one son
[9:30] that one son when he comes to a place
[9:32] and that father keeps watching because
[9:35] watch what brother Ram said brother and
[9:36] says the Holy Spirit goes back to God we
[9:39] know less Jack's of a play there's not a
[9:41] Holy Spirit that walks up to God and
[9:43] tell him you got that acts of a play
[9:46] same person and truthfully the father
[9:50] knows what you done sit for the
[9:52] foundation of the world he knew that's
[9:54] why he could say that we're all adopted
[9:57] sons and daughter cuz really in the body
[10:01] change we all become adopted sons and
[10:04] daughters of God because see Adam lost
[10:06] sonship he lost the right to be in the
[10:10] day he wasn't adopted basically in that
[10:13] position because you know what God
[10:15] didn't come down and interfere with Adam
[10:17] before the fall whatever Adam said
[10:20] that's what happened well why because he
[10:22] was throwing to him done remember I've
[10:23] said many times before when the the
[10:25] tiger came across and Adam said Tiger
[10:27] God didn't go no women no God said
[10:30] that's exactly what I call it so that to
[10:32] me that's adoption is that the father
[10:35] and the son are one so much that you
[10:38] can't see the difference the father can
[10:40] go on a vacation like you come to the
[10:41] father can go on a vacation and leave it
[10:43] to the son okay so but now some of the
[10:49] other signs what about the prodigal son
[10:51] prodigal son he went out and get all the
[10:53] stuff in the world but when he came back
[10:55] he was restored once you're born again
[10:58] you can't get out of the family of God
[11:00] you can miss yourself up you can die an
[11:03] early death or you cannot make it to
[11:05] adoption that's your to me that's God
[11:08] saying here this is how you do it if you
[11:11] do it fine if you don't find we all
[11:14] gonna get to the same place but it's
[11:16] like I sell them brother Claude you
[11:17] can't throw it out there though and say
[11:19] well if we don't we don't somebody is
[11:21] going to come to full authority just
[11:23] like Adam and Eve standing on the earth
[11:25] to say dead come out of the ground an
[11:28] adopted son of God a daughter of God has
[11:31] to be alive and at that position to call
[11:33] the Dead out of the ground what to call
[11:36] who out of the ground sons and daughters
[11:37] of God they didn't make it to floridaa
[11:40] sin to full authority but somebody's
[11:42] through to me I believe through the
[11:44] opening of these seals
[11:46] answering all the questions that we have
[11:48] I have a lot less listen you know you're
[11:52] born again this is my home this is my
[11:55] this is me I know I know I'm born again
[11:57] because he said well make your list no
[12:00] because what I started with has
[12:04] progressed if you're still wondering
[12:08] about the same things that you wondered
[12:11] about 20 years ago go back remember what
[12:15] brother rambling when the guy was dying
[12:16] he said now lay me - where'd you leave
[12:17] God he said now I lay me down to sleep
[12:19] yeah go back to that spot yes it's
[12:23] ignorant not to because you know that's
[12:25] what he knew that's where he lost God
[12:27] hat you know where you veered off yeah
[12:30] you're the only one known
[12:32] you know where you've been in another
[12:34] direction when you should have went in
[12:35] this direction you know you did think
[12:38] you shouldn't do but you know what the
[12:40] prodigal son took all of his fortune
[12:43] took all of his wealth and went out and
[12:46] just
[12:47] in other words playing a prostitute
[12:50] pretty much he just stole himself to the
[12:52] world but the father always knew he'd
[12:55] come back the father always was waiting
[12:57] for him
[12:57] and when he came back he didn't say now
[13:00] why did you stay home 20 years and why
[13:01] did you do this one no he said open arms
[13:06] kill the fatted calf put him back in his
[13:09] position ain't supposed to be in and
[13:11] that's the way God is doing the you and
[13:13] I is he's putting us but now remember
[13:15] there was one son that stayed ever home
[13:17] huh he was about to publish business
[13:19] this one what but he came back around
[13:22] because he was part of the family the
[13:24] father couldn't deny that son he had him
[13:27] he was in the body so when you get
[13:29] borning him your revelation should
[13:31] progress and I'm telling you your
[13:33] revelation should progress you shouldn't
[13:35] not have knowledge no we think no
[13:37] there's no more than than we did a year
[13:40] ago six months ago but when it truly
[13:43] ties together when you start seeing that
[13:46] picture like we've come back Wednesday
[13:49] Peter grass cow tree and remains where
[13:55] it's supposed to be I say at home
[13:57] everything is where it's supposed to be
[13:58] but it's not the strap position the tree
[14:01] can't be up here in the clouds yet the
[14:04] tree is part of the picture the cow
[14:07] can't be in top of the tree counterpart
[14:10] of venture but he's in these out of his
[14:13] position the adoption is a position it's
[14:18] a position you come to and the position
[14:21] you come to is is is it has nothing to
[14:24] do with your wealth of your natural
[14:27] being are the not wealth of your natural
[14:31] being it does not have reading this
[14:33] morning brother Adam even brings the
[14:36] Seventh Seal people I won't read
[14:39] maybe another son your food from out the
[14:40] stair and still people that's me and you
[14:42] the Seventh Seal people are the 11th
[14:46] hour workers the Seventh Seal people see
[14:51] we come right here at the end they've
[14:53] had all them years to to have all the
[14:56] 2000 years since Jesus died and then up
[14:59] to the 1500 swear they wrote the Bible
[15:01] in print form and then all the way
[15:03] through and they've had Martin Luther
[15:07] Wesley
[15:07] we now have had William Brown with all
[15:10] the tapes in the books what have we come
[15:12] to some have come to an intellectual
[15:14] knowledge some have took it and started
[15:17] progressing on up
[15:18] well actually up the pyramid okay go see
[15:22] that Holy Spirit right there that's very
[15:24] important it's not teaching you get get
[15:27] the Holy Spirit up here you get to
[15:28] always bury here but that is not what
[15:31] that is what I was talking about
[15:32] Wednesday night that's a new birth from
[15:36] according to my account for that's
[15:38] taking us to the headstone that's that
[15:40] breach here and the priest to get us out
[15:42] of the church ages get the baby turned
[15:44] right and get us into the seals come see
[15:47] the baby sure the baby was the baby was
[15:50] conceived it wasn't the baby came from
[15:53] if I mean the baby was conceived wrong
[15:55] the baby was conceived right but we were
[16:00] turned wrong I've seen my death the
[16:02] other day the furthermore to that
[16:03] Wednesday night we'll talk about today
[16:06] dr. Polk to me the other day and he said
[16:08] he said what is a breech birth and I
[16:10] said well it's when the feet come out
[16:12] first he said we're not in the fee date
[16:15] he said were no headache
[16:18] he says that head had to come first
[16:22] so thank God for that then they get a
[16:25] little faith to bottom either cutting
[16:26] grass or glue and my other thing so but
[16:30] we come to these seals don't we see that
[16:32] that in the fifth seal because I want to
[16:34] show you a little example and then we'll
[16:35] talk about that stairs with this fish
[16:37] seal you see a group of people that we
[16:40] talked about that was given white robes
[16:43] and they did not care about Jesus Christ
[16:45] right
[16:47] they ain't care that's the grace of God
[16:51] well brother Brown said mayors and
[16:53] divorce was preached in the seals right
[16:55] show me where he preached a minute see
[16:57] he did not he hardly mentioned marriage
[17:00] and divorce in the seal but I got the
[17:03] quote for brother Brown said marriage
[17:04] and divorce was revealed in the seven
[17:06] seals
[17:07] well to me right there's where it come
[17:09] in that fifth seal Jew went out did
[17:14] whatever they wanted to do didn't care
[17:17] what they did and God give him a white
[17:19] robe same thing with you with our
[17:20] management divorce problem he didn't do
[17:22] away with our problem but he did bring
[17:24] us grace to where we could accept the
[17:26] grace of marriage endures and go on and
[17:28] not let that bother us anymore all right
[17:32] all right with that see but then you got
[17:34] to peel back the onion and see that that
[17:36] would that that is like I said that is
[17:39] for the first revelation for your body
[17:41] change comes remember in imagine divorce
[17:45] situation and a brother the other days
[17:47] well you know I know I I know I divorced
[17:50] the devil in man Jesus no that's not
[17:53] right he was the guy in the message - I
[17:56] hate that you can't divorce the devil
[18:02] you have to kill
[18:05] because if your old husband is the more
[18:07] sisters you're not supposed to marry
[18:09] again if he's alive now if your old
[18:11] husband's DEA they don't when you think
[18:14] that that was dead
[18:16] d-day I don't have that old man was dead
[18:21] if he's dead then sisters you may in the
[18:24] Lord you man who every month a cop that
[18:26] same thing with the body change the
[18:28] grace of marriage and divorce freeze you
[18:30] once you once you get rid of that old
[18:32] husband sisters don't go kill your
[18:35] husband the spiritual hair all right
[18:39] because then if you did kill your
[18:40] husband you go into that part where a
[18:42] murderer won't enter into the kingdom
[18:43] balance don't be careful that I'm just
[18:47] covering all my bases okay I don't want
[18:55] [Applause]
[18:58] [Music]
[19:00] somebody's looking online and see if the
[19:02] insurance policy fight but that's not
[19:05] all though you know what
[19:06] that's silly that we have to explain
[19:09] that but you know what somebody's carnal
[19:11] mind would take them to that yeah well
[19:14] because you say well how'd that happen
[19:16] well Paul gets up and starts preaching
[19:18] about the resurrection and that we're
[19:20] resurrected sitting in heavenly places
[19:21] in the resurrection of the inside man
[19:24] you know we've been resurrected and
[19:26] carry it out of here and two guys in the
[19:28] church to preachers Phil it's us and how
[19:31] many ins they go out and start preaching
[19:33] it Paul said the resurrection was over
[19:35] right that the resurrection had already
[19:37] happened
[19:38] well Paul rebuked don't turn them over
[19:40] to them to the devil remember the Bible
[19:42] description
[19:42] why they took what he said in
[19:46] misinterpreted totally misinterpret what
[19:49] are you talking about
[19:50] and the Impala says work we come into an
[19:53] out resurrection which come up out of
[19:54] thee and that's the same thing with you
[19:56] and I if this is not a new new birth but
[20:00] remember we're birthed into every one of
[20:02] these Peter had to pick that up and say
[20:06] being born again being born again
[20:09] we're right here running around a few
[20:12] the statue perfect man this seals
[20:13] everything in so let the capstone can
[20:16] come down the capstone can come down on
[20:18] here like we can was talking about the
[20:19] other day it has to fit perfect right
[20:22] here and actually it doesn't come down
[20:25] it's filled in by the Holy Spirit seal
[20:27] them so to me this right here that's
[20:29] that that's that part that nobody's
[20:32] reached right here because they may have
[20:35] right here the Holy Spirit in the in the
[20:37] face of the Father but that Holy Spirit
[20:41] that capstone is the Seventh Seal
[20:44] so they've never been preached correctly
[20:47] by man until brother Branham preached
[20:50] them listen in 1963 and beyond because
[20:55] he never put preaching on the seal if
[20:56] once they opened in 1963 he just
[20:58] continued and preached them all the way
[20:59] till he passed away he eclipsed because
[21:05] because adoption is placing here or
[21:09] sealing all this in because brother
[21:10] Clark now we're talking it truly power
[21:12] without character satanic so you can
[21:15] still have the new birth and you're
[21:17] doing things wrong because you you do
[21:19] get power you shall receive power after
[21:23] the Holy Ghost to them in some scripture
[21:25] but you can use it wrong we all do we
[21:30] use it wrong okay but right here the
[21:33] power with character with all these
[21:36] working the Steep brother Branham
[21:38] couldn't people when he reached the
[21:40] place of adoption whatever he said
[21:42] that's what's gonna happen he's gonna
[21:44] walk Tennyson around town with alcohol
[21:46] y'all are gonna die today and then all
[21:48] about today God went had to honor that
[21:50] word but God knowing that even in its
[21:54] infancy when those two kids were making
[21:59] love in the auditorium the property God
[22:03] said God told me whatever you say he
[22:06] said and he said thankfully carry them
[22:08] out here get out of here dead yeah if I
[22:10] don't have spoke it now I'm not verbatim
[22:13] at expert
[22:14] he said he said whatever I say it see
[22:17] I'm take something that's God given
[22:20] authority to a human man yeah okay but
[22:26] it's the same thing as God you authority
[22:28] to a human man named Adam one time I
[22:30] don't was a human he was supernatural in
[22:34] the Genesis 21.6 man but when he put him
[22:36] in that 2:7 man he became a natural
[22:38] human breathing a mortal human being so
[22:44] what am I saying
[22:44] it's not so weak that man this is gonna
[22:48] be like brother Clark now we're talking
[22:49] that's not not for that see if we think
[22:52] that adoption is and it is it's placing
[22:54] it's putting your way up in a top
[22:55] position but it's not that it hasn't
[22:57] been done it I've done it the Lord Jesus
[23:02] done it brother branham done it we've
[23:04] got mouth of two or three witnesses how
[23:07] it worked so it's not something that
[23:11] we're going to come to and then we don't
[23:12] have anything to background no go back
[23:15] to Adam go back to Jesus go back to
[23:17] brother Graham there's your three
[23:19] examples of a manifested son of God
[23:22] adopted able to control nature okay if I
[23:28] got that so that's what these seals
[23:30] doing and you got a look if we way up
[23:32] when we go to them upstairs we'll have a
[23:33] little more time and we'll break it down
[23:35] a little bit more than even what we did
[23:37] down here so now we're in the sixth M
[23:42] and I'll be helmet opened the sixth seal
[23:44] though that was great earthquakes Sun
[23:46] became black as sackcloth of hair and
[23:47] the moon became as blood and the stars
[23:49] of heaven fell unto the earth even as a
[23:52] fig tree casteth her untimely figs when
[23:54] she is shaken of a mighty wind and the
[23:58] heaven departed as a scroll and it
[23:59] rolled together and every mountain and
[24:01] island were moved in other places you
[24:02] see all this all this is nature
[24:06] earthquake son
[24:09] moon stars heaven earth feat tree figs
[24:17] wind heaven Mountain Island earth now
[24:27] you bring me in here you bring in the
[24:28] men in okay but what happened they ask
[24:32] the rocks to follow on well they they
[24:35] went in a hidden cave and they wanted
[24:37] the rocks to fall what a great things it
[24:42] that's why no I'm gonna say this real
[24:47] real reverently and see you look at your
[24:51] you look at your foolish virgins and
[24:53] they know something's going on because
[24:56] there's something going on with us they
[24:58] feel the pull well these men here
[25:03] because thanks good people on this earth
[25:06] there's good people yeah there are
[25:08] that's good and what we would say
[25:10] nominal Christian people that's gonna
[25:12] have to go through this they're gonna
[25:15] have to go through this so you're not
[25:17] talking about what I'm saying is you're
[25:19] not talking about total ethan's because
[25:24] look they calling the lamb now sinner
[25:35] someone I regenerated never gonna make
[25:38] it that name never on any kind of book
[25:40] like my brother Graham said now he
[25:41] doesn't know a difference in a lamb and
[25:43] Jesus Christ don't care about right so
[25:46] something of these men and all these
[25:48] people why are they hiding
[25:54] they know just enough what's coming
[25:58] because remember the foolish person
[26:00] during this time during this period
[26:03] right here and I didn't bring this out
[26:05] today
[26:06] during this time period that we're
[26:08] looking at the six seal the foolish
[26:12] virgin will be hunted down and killed
[26:17] millions just like the six you know it's
[26:21] like the six million Jews were hunted
[26:23] down and killed by a man Hitler the same
[26:26] is going to happen to a group of people
[26:28] they didn't go all the way with God but
[26:31] the foolish virgin see they're coming to
[26:33] get oil they're coming to us to get oil
[26:36] [Music]
[26:39] and like Mia Louise was talking last
[26:42] night we're running out of time for even
[26:45] y'all sitting in this building I mean
[26:47] all that when I say y'all I mean all of
[26:49] us we can't keep going back over and
[26:52] back over they certain time where God
[26:54] says all right the horsemen are here if
[26:56] you're a woman you just want to stay one
[26:58] because the horseman is heading in that
[26:59] direction yeah okay
[27:01] and I mean that with all seriousness
[27:03] she's God's gracious to keep looping
[27:06] back and picking up but what he does
[27:08] when he leaps back he knows at least a
[27:09] dog don't do anything wasteful yes think
[27:12] about this of the bait he loots back and
[27:14] he may not get but one person one person
[27:17] he one person he's got that one lost
[27:20] sheep he's gonna let the ninety and nine
[27:22] keep going remember but he's got he
[27:25] hears that crime that one lost sheep he
[27:27] comes back one more time but you know
[27:30] what he does that sheep he breaks his
[27:32] legs he's serious about it this time
[27:35] you're not getting away from me this
[27:37] time and he carries him to the 99 I love
[27:40] that I love that this man
[27:45] we are go
[27:48] now that's probably why they know
[27:52] they'll come to us now
[27:53] I said nano they'll come to us now well
[28:01] now what's going to happen see this is
[28:02] this is after thinking I'll explain that
[28:04] come in done it's plain good enough that
[28:06] this is all where we are gone what do
[28:11] you want to say the bride thank you the
[28:13] bride of Jesus Christ that's boring in
[28:15] and all seven church ages has taken a
[28:17] rat took a raptor
[28:18] but now because remember go back to you
[28:22] go back to your type there was ten
[28:27] virgins now remember they were virgins
[28:30] they had never been manhandled by man
[28:33] bright brother Brown said to be man held
[28:35] by man is to be in the denomination okay
[28:38] so you got you ten first wanna say a lot
[28:40] of people in this message you're gonna
[28:41] be food for that's because they're not
[28:43] gonna be taught enough to come to a
[28:45] place of receiving the Holy Ghost good
[28:47] look let me just be real honest we you
[28:49] never buy on internet if you're pastors
[28:50] not born again and you're underneath
[28:52] them you're not gonna get born again
[28:54] unless you hear something else and come
[28:56] out and go in another direction so all
[28:59] right but though watch you got you ten
[29:01] virgins know what happens they all hear
[29:04] the same cry right right they are all
[29:11] hear the same cry and they all wake up
[29:15] it's not that we call them five sleeping
[29:18] virgins but it's really they all wake up
[29:20] at the same time these don't go back to
[29:22] sleep but what do they do when they wake
[29:25] up and they find out they don't have
[29:29] enough oil they go looking for it but
[29:33] where they go they're not going out here
[29:34] to look for it they're gonna tax their
[29:36] self to these five wise virgins right
[29:41] they don't start coming back to church
[29:43] they go they know where the oil is and
[29:46] they say give us of your oil and we're
[29:49] to tell them look we got just enough to
[29:55] get ourselves out of here you gonna have
[29:57] to go find it somewhere else and then
[29:58] when they left
[30:00] the cry came come up the file went up in
[30:04] the five state weeping and wailing and
[30:06] gnashing of teeth now that's the five
[30:08] foolish burden that will be right in
[30:10] here because look you can't have this
[30:12] brought in to just heathens I mean who
[30:17] cares about the Lamb of God if you're
[30:19] just the center if you just don't write
[30:23] you don't know the position he holds as
[30:26] a sinners now as a center to be
[30:28] repentant to be regenerated yes you do
[30:30] know that but you have to come to you
[30:33] know you go out on the streets and you
[30:35] say who's the Lamb of God well somebody
[30:37] that may have heard something in the
[30:38] Bible they must it but we know that's
[30:39] kiesza but if you say the Lamb of God
[30:42] most people worldly people they don't
[30:44] know what to do but no know who Jesus is
[30:46] well I know the Jesus is okay yeah
[30:49] because you probably cuz in his name of
[30:50] like you know you doing one thing but
[30:52] they don't know the position of this
[30:54] lamb but these people do that's why I
[30:56] was looking at this was another one the
[30:57] onion peel this is the foolish virgin
[31:00] crying out hide us and the dens and
[31:03] rocks of the mountains because you know
[31:05] your foolish virgin here we are
[31:06] narrow-minded people again the food
[31:08] partners are not all in the United
[31:09] States of America they're all over the
[31:12] world
[31:12] okay they're all over the world remember
[31:15] ones in the bad ones awake or twos in
[31:19] the bed into the wait one goes in one
[31:20] state
[31:21] well the 2-litre awake or during the
[31:23] daytime and the two that are asleep is
[31:25] you know they're in the backside of the
[31:27] earth they not you know the world goes
[31:29] wrong so the words perfect you just
[31:32] won't let it be the same and the hoots
[31:35] he loved it for the great day of the
[31:36] wrath date of his wrath has come and
[31:39] it's going to say that and you're not a
[31:41] Christian people the world's not going
[31:44] to carry the world is one of the ones
[31:45] it's going to be gnashing of teeth and
[31:48] wailing and think I'm know what just
[31:50] like Puerto Rico you know they just
[31:52] total devastation and I've reading this
[31:54] morning where that the governors all got
[31:56] together said we need help now we got
[31:58] people just wandering around the streets
[31:59] and don't know what to do and and in a
[32:02] disaster situation a lot of times we do
[32:04] we know it takes all of us it takes all
[32:07] of our normalcy away yeah hey you think
[32:09] look when we lost power for 44 days last
[32:13] week Monday through Thursday we came out
[32:16] of a normal routine yeah we had to go
[32:20] get a generator we had to go find
[32:22] extension cords we have to go find
[32:24] lights we have to go find you see our
[32:26] plan we have to go find a place to plug
[32:28] in our cell phones go out the car
[32:32] blowing man what if your car's gone you
[32:34] understand once and so that's just a
[32:36] that's not even up that's not even a
[32:41] pimple consider them what them people
[32:43] went through you know yeah so but what
[32:46] about this let's take that my 10,000
[32:48] more times yeah
[32:49] all right so let's just don't be here
[32:51] yeah this is going to happen okay this
[32:57] is going to happen and we can read about
[33:00] it and we can study it and we can say
[33:04] thank God he's like I told your wings
[33:06] you're not the one of the greatest
[33:07] things that God revealed to me three the
[33:09] prophet of God is that I don't have to
[33:11] go through the Great Tribulation right I
[33:14] don't have to stand before the white
[33:16] throne judgment to me that frees a lot
[33:19] of things from me all right because you
[33:22] talk to a denominational person first
[33:23] thing I'll tell you is we gotta all
[33:25] stand at that white throne judgment and
[33:27] these songs that they have you know
[33:29] standing before the throne standing
[33:31] before the bar we don't have to stand
[33:34] before that one thank God for a prophet
[33:36] thing to tell us that but you know why
[33:39] it's always been in the Bible but it's
[33:41] not verbatim you know when he says and
[33:46] the books are open there was what was it
[33:48] there was Thrones brother Brown said
[33:51] drums that means as much people there
[33:52] it's not just one there's one sitting on
[33:54] the throne back over in Revelation 4 or
[33:56] somewhere over an arrow when we come
[33:57] over to the wife own judgment he said
[33:59] you know there's throw me thrown
[34:01] employee that's where we are we're not
[34:02] we're not gonna listen we're out several
[34:05] million people gonna be setting up on
[34:06] the front all right you are the throne
[34:09] okay cuz remember that's what revelation
[34:12] 3:14 is supposed to tell us he told us
[34:16] that what we would give
[34:17] is that we could sit with him in his
[34:20] throne now we can't all sit in the front
[34:22] I mean on the front but we can all sit
[34:26] in the front there's room enough for all
[34:28] that was in the throne but now on the
[34:29] throne they'd have to be a real big one
[34:31] look at Aaron in different ones and all
[34:33] that
[34:33] just take the law to a lot of real
[34:36] estate and my brother Richard Douglas it
[34:38] and cover a pretty big throne
[34:41] anyway selling but in the throne I can
[34:43] put all the believers in okay so so
[34:46] thank God for that but yeah this is your
[34:49] foolish virgins they're in here crying
[34:51] out there are the ones that know this is
[34:52] coming they're the ones that no even
[34:57] remember the Bible says there will be a
[34:59] still small voice tell them you missed
[35:01] it now why would listen why would God
[35:04] tell a sinner that senator okay he's
[35:10] telling the foolish virgin yeah you
[35:12] missed it you were that close and you
[35:15] missed it because brother branham in and
[35:18] what makes it think that he said after
[35:21] the rapture they'll keep on going to
[35:23] church and think they're getting safe
[35:25] Collette will tell you something once
[35:27] the rapture takes place and the people
[35:28] that are attached to us see us miss be
[35:31] missing they're gonna be right in
[35:34] looking they're gonna be searching and
[35:37] they're going to realize they missed it
[35:40] let's see what are they gonna do they're
[35:42] gonna keep their mouths shut
[35:43] no they don't tell their tell others
[35:45] they gonna tell others and then they're
[35:47] gonna tell other the crowds going to go
[35:49] out that they missed it and they're
[35:51] gonna cry for the rocks fall and what
[35:56] one hurts me they got two prophets on
[35:59] the scene they can turn their heart back
[36:02] but God's finished for the Gentiles
[36:04] these two prophets will not save one
[36:07] Gentile because the Gentile door
[36:12] sure I'm not sure there I'm sure that
[36:15] the manner that right
[36:16] they just got receive the Holy Ghost and
[36:18] but a but look they can't receive the
[36:21] Holy Ghost it's just like I said before
[36:22] they can't receive the Holy Ghost while
[36:25] that while we're here because if they
[36:26] receive the Holy Ghost then they gotta
[36:28] go in a rapture with us right so they
[36:32] can you say well they're over they can
[36:35] be in a sanctified condition they could
[36:36] be they could be said in the message
[36:37] Church over here but be of Jewish
[36:39] descent you know I'm not looking for
[36:43] them these people will not impact me do
[36:47] you know what we impact them more than
[36:49] they impact us because unless we get out
[36:52] of here them to can't do their job and
[36:54] they'll receive the Holy Ghost will go
[36:56] up and the Holy Ghost will fall right
[36:59] down to prophets and guess what there'll
[37:02] be the only two people in the world with
[37:03] the baptism of the Holy Ghost at that
[37:05] now see how precise the word is they'll
[37:08] be the only two people that have the
[37:10] baptism of the holy birth in their soul
[37:14] but now then 144,000 is gonna come out
[37:17] of that okay and then what's gonna
[37:19] happen then then when they left off the
[37:21] earth don't remember the foolish virgin
[37:25] don't have the whole dumb they're gonna
[37:27] be hunted down and killed down through
[37:28] the tribulation and then when based in
[37:30] profits in 144,000 leave all hell's
[37:33] gonna break loose
[37:36] because why
[37:37] the wrath of God as long as there's a
[37:40] son listen if you have a son or daughter
[37:42] in a kingdom and you were a king and you
[37:44] were getting ready to raid that Kingdom
[37:46] and you you you you you were gonna kill
[37:48] every person in that city but your son
[37:51] or daughter was still in that city a
[37:54] natural king wouldn't do that he would
[37:57] wait till they got him out then it would
[38:01] be Katie bar the door all the way from
[38:04] the front to the back
[38:05] kill them all because that's their
[38:06] commission but as long as there's even
[38:10] one got to name him if you found five
[38:14] you know Sodom and Gomorrah I'll save
[38:16] the whole city both of them he couldn't
[38:19] find five he only fell
[38:20] what forward live it's live from the two
[38:24] daughters now if God would assist a
[38:26] favor had what it said for God would
[38:30] have said Whitman I got a four were down
[38:32] there while we know what happened to
[38:33] Lot's wife but she was in there and had
[38:36] to come out so you see how precise the
[38:39] word is Abraham stopped at five he said
[38:42] God have you find five you know he
[38:43] started with 15-minute winning and down
[38:45] to five or ten and then he got close is
[38:48] to hit you didn't ask the right thing
[38:50] but that's why Sodom and Gomorrah was
[38:52] destroyed because they had to even wait
[38:54] to lighten them we're out of them out of
[38:57] the city
[38:57] okay so shout perfect word is and thank
[39:00] God for a property that we could put all
[39:01] this together by by one by revelation
[39:05] not by just because these two prophets
[39:08] like I said they have they're waiting on
[39:10] us we're not waiting on them we don't
[39:14] need their message colors to the Jews we
[39:19] don't need their message but they need I
[39:22] miss it and I say our message I say they
[39:25] a message of the hour they need our
[39:27] message to take it to the 144,000 and
[39:32] then what do they do being prophets they
[39:35] start a nature cleansing of the earth
[39:38] but say no spiritually you and I through
[39:43] the prophets message Jesus Christ coming
[39:47] down and speaking to us do a prophet but
[39:49] then Jesus Christ now speaking us to us
[39:51] through the Holy Ghost in all of us then
[39:56] we're getting a nature cleansing in here
[39:59] if we don't get cleansed in here none of
[40:01] that's going to happen so the nature
[40:04] cleansing and the sixth seal does start
[40:05] right here then they're a natural seal
[40:07] will open when we're gone all right
[40:10] let's go from
[40:13] [Music]
