[23:52] i can do to make the devil upset
[23:54] that's what i want to do lord we we
[23:57] remember your prophet spoke about how
[23:58] that
[23:59] that in this hour it would get darker
[24:01] and darker and darker and we remember
[24:03] him down at telling a little story of in
[24:04] the cave where
[24:06] he said there was that little boy that
[24:08] said
[24:09] there is a man that can turn on the
[24:10] light and lord we're looking for you to
[24:13] turn on the light for us this afternoon
[24:15] lord jesus in this dark hour that we're

[24:41] it now lord we pray lord that you'll
[24:43] just feel welcome here to move among us
[24:45] this afternoon lord jesus
[24:47] lord let us not just be a vain gathering
[24:49] together lord jesus but
[24:50] gathering together to worship in you and
[24:52] the power of your resurrection
[24:54] to know you lord in the way that you
[24:55] want us to know your tough
[24:57] lord i believe that you've given us
[24:58] everything to restore our fellowship
[25:00] back with you lord jesus
[25:02] to restore our communion with you now
[25:04] lord and through your word
[25:05] lord let us commune with you this
[25:07] afternoon as your word goes forth
[25:09] we ask lord god that the words that i
[25:11] speak lord will not be my words lord but
[25:13] you will speak words of edification and
[25:15] strength to your people
[25:16] and open up the ears of your people to
[25:18] hear and receive lord
[25:20] we ask these things in your name amen
[25:25] so john chapter 14 verses 14 to 21
[25:28] says if you shall ask anything in my
[25:31] name i will do it
[25:33] if you love me keep my commandments
[25:36] and i will pray the father and he shall
[25:38] give you another comforter that he may
[25:40] abide with you forever
[25:42] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[25:43] cannot receive
[25:45] because that seeth him not neither
[25:47] knoweth him
[25:48] but ye know him for he dwelleth with you
[25:50] and shall be in you
[25:52] i will not leave you comfortless i will
[25:54] come to you yet a little while and the
[25:56] world seeth me no more but ye see me
[25:58] because i live ye shall live also at
[26:01] that day ye shall know that i
[26:02] am in my father and ye and me and i and
[26:05] you
[26:06] he that hath my commandments and keepeth
[26:08] them he it is that loveth me and he that
[26:09] loveth me shall be loved to my father
[26:11] and i will love him
[26:12] and will manifest myself to him jesus
[26:15] saith unto him
[26:17] not his carry it lord how is it that
[26:19] thou would manifest ourself unto us and
[26:20] not unto the world
[26:22] and jesus answered and said unto him if
[26:23] a man loved me he will keep my words and
[26:25] my father will love him
[26:27] and we will come unto him and make our
[26:29] abode with him he that loveth me not
[26:31] keepeth not my sayings and the word
[26:33] which you hear is not mine but the
[26:35] fathers which sent me
[26:37] these things have i spoken unto you
[26:39] being yet present with you
[26:41] but the comforter which is the holy
[26:43] ghost whom the father will send in my
[26:45] name
[26:46] he shall teach you all things and bring
[26:48] all things to your remembrance
[26:50] whatsoever i have said unto you you may
[26:53] be sitting
[26:54] seated the lord has blessings to reading
[26:55] the word
[26:58] so just to add a little context to the
[27:00] scripture as you as we were reading
[27:01] those words maybe think about how the
[27:03] how it was really another junction time
[27:06] something was about to take place and
[27:07] the disciples thought that uh
[27:09] they had put all their maybe looking at
[27:12] jesus as the fulfillment of
[27:13] of something they didn't quite
[27:14] understand looking at him to bring in
[27:16] another kingdom that they didn't quite
[27:17] understand and then here he was
[27:18] talking about how he was going to go off
[27:20] the scene going to leave him and but
[27:22] yeah he was trying to give him some
[27:24] comfort i i'm leaving you but i'm going
[27:25] to give you a comforter
[27:26] yeah and and they didn't fully
[27:29] understand maybe
[27:30] at that time what what that meant what
[27:32] that comforter was going to do and what
[27:34] the purpose is
[27:35] and i believe maybe in this hour there's
[27:37] many people that don't understand the
[27:38] purpose of what the holy ghost is
[27:40] and so that's what i want to want to
[27:43] bring this afternoon
[27:45] is what was it given for now
[27:51] brother brown preached that series of
[27:53] three messages
[27:54] back back in 1959 or whenever it was
[27:58] what was the holy ghost given for and
[28:00] and how to get it and how did you how to
[28:02] know you got it which was the one that
[28:03] was not recorded and then
[28:04] then the uh questions and answers on the
[28:07] holy ghost
[28:08] and we were actually listening to
[28:10] questions and answers on the holy ghost
[28:11] as we were coming up the road this
[28:12] morning and in that sermon brother
[28:14] branham really lays out
[28:15] what happened on the day of pentecost
[28:17] that he explains he dramatizes a little
[28:19] bit for you
[28:20] and if you go back and listen to that
[28:21] brother bam talks about how they were in
[28:23] the upper room
[28:24] brother jesus told them to go to
[28:25] jerusalem and terry and wait and they
[28:27] waited there for 10 days and they were
[28:28] there in that upper room and
[28:30] then it was like three different things
[28:31] began to take place there they were
[28:33] there in the upper room with all their
[28:35] different opinions and all the different
[28:36] ideas of what was going to take place
[28:38] how long it'll be and we know that peter
[28:39] rose up and said well hold on now we
[28:41] ain't got it yet let's just wait a
[28:43] little bit longer and
[28:44] then they all began to get in one accord
[28:46] and the bible says in acts that they
[28:47] began to pray in one accord and they
[28:48] were there
[28:49] getting in getting their their mind in
[28:51] one accord believing that god was going
[28:53] to give that promise to them
[28:54] that the promise was to them and it was
[28:56] going to it was going to come
[28:58] and and brother brown began to relate
[29:00] that that three first
[29:01] first they saw it was like a like a like
[29:04] a mighty rushing
[29:05] wind moved into the building like a
[29:07] rushing wind and then he said
[29:08] he began to describe that it was like he
[29:10] compared it to that that
[29:12] movie ten commandments cecil b demille's
[29:14] movie the ten commandments where you
[29:15] he said look at that pillar of fire in
[29:17] the movie how they
[29:18] how they put that in that movie and off
[29:20] of that pillar of fire were little licks
[29:22] of fire and
[29:23] he said that's just how it was all for
[29:24] that pillar of fire little licks of fire
[29:26] and he said in that room there in that
[29:28] upper room
[29:29] the little licks of fire began to circle
[29:31] and move and they were sitting there and
[29:33] they began to observe the looks of fire
[29:35] moving them out that room
[29:36] and the licks of fire began to settle on
[29:38] each one now that's number phase number
[29:40] two
[29:41] the licks of fire began to appear now
[29:43] now see how
[29:44] you can begin to you can see something
[29:46] and that's great that you can see
[29:48] something you can feel something that's
[29:49] great
[29:50] but the third thing was the holy ghost
[29:52] the holy ghost went into them the holy
[29:54] ghost to birth them
[29:56] and the holy and then what what happened
[29:57] he said now they were about a block away
[30:00] from the temple where the temple was
[30:01] they were in that upper room and it was
[30:02] at a block away and they were up in that
[30:04] upper room because they were scared
[30:06] they were afraid of of all the people
[30:08] outside that they might kill them and
[30:09] they might string them up and all those
[30:11] things they were afraid
[30:12] but when the holy ghost fell on them it
[30:14] quickened the word that they had been
[30:15] hearing for three and a half years and
[30:17] they weren't afraid anymore
[30:18] and they went out
[30:23] they went out on the street and the holy
[30:25] ghost was so they were so
[30:26] filled with the holy ghost brother
[30:27] graham said that they could not express
[30:30] what was going on with him and he said
[30:32] they were moving a block they were going
[30:34] toward the temple a block walk
[30:36] a block away where all the people from
[30:38] cappadocia and phrygia and all around
[30:40] the world were gathered together to
[30:41] worship there the temple
[30:42] and as they went they began people were
[30:44] asking them what's wrong with what's
[30:46] going on with you
[30:47] and they they begin to share that they
[30:49] tried to express
[30:51] that this is the thing that we've been
[30:53] waiting on this is the promise
[30:55] that was foretold in the book of joel
[30:57] and all those things that brother
[30:58] branham said that they could not express
[31:00] they couldn't quite get it out and and
[31:02] they began to say this
[31:04] they staggered and with stammering lips
[31:06] and other tongues they began to
[31:07] say this is the thing and god changed
[31:10] their words as it came out they with
[31:13] understanding began to speak and he
[31:14] changed their words so that other people
[31:16] could hear what they said now now we
[31:19] know all those things that was how the
[31:21] holy ghost first
[31:22] fell that was the holy ghost first fail
[31:25] and i want to ask you this question what
[31:26] did it do what was the purpose of the
[31:28] holy ghost
[31:29] was the purpose of the holy ghost just
[31:31] so they could preach right there in the
[31:32] temple
[31:33] was the holy ghost just so that they
[31:35] right there in that moment so that they
[31:36] could they could preach good sermons
[31:38] what was the holy ghost for that was a
[31:40] purpose to the holy ghost
[31:42] you see there's a there's a purpose the
[31:44] holy ghost was given to actually
[31:46] accomplish a purpose
[31:48] everything is for a purpose brother
[31:49] abraham said this church is erected for
[31:51] a purpose
[31:52] there's nothing without a purpose and a
[31:54] cause you
[31:55] are here for a purpose the holy ghost
[31:57] was sent for a purpose and if we can get
[31:59] get
[32:00] into the message and identify what our
[32:02] purpose is what our role is what the
[32:04] holy ghost is here for
[32:05] it will give you confidence and power
[32:08] brother said what was the purpose of god
[32:10] sending the holy spirit
[32:12] what's it for if it's such a great thing
[32:14] then why did god send it
[32:16] if you can understand that you must have
[32:18] the holy ghost
[32:20] you've got to have the holy ghost is
[32:22] more important than who you're going to
[32:23] marry it's more important
[32:25] than what job you have is more important
[32:27] than where you live
[32:28] it's more important than any other
[32:30] decision you can have in your life
[32:32] because
[32:33] everything else stems from that thing if
[32:36] that holy thing
[32:37] is living inside of you as the bible
[32:38] calls it that holy thing then everything
[32:40] else will just radiate
[32:42] off of that the sons of god are led by
[32:44] the spirit of god as
[32:45] the bible tells us now now brother jesus
[32:49] said here in john chapter 14
[32:51] verse 18 i will not leave you
[32:53] comfortless i will not leave your
[32:55] accomplice i will come to you so
[32:57] that kind of proves if jesus is coming
[33:00] to you
[33:00] if that is jesus coming to you with the
[33:02] holy ghost then that proves that
[33:04] christianity is not just a dogma
[33:06] christianity is not just some things
[33:08] that we learn but christianity is
[33:09] actually the person of jesus christ
[33:12] being revealed to you it's a person
[33:14] coming and living inside of you
[33:16] that's what the holy ghost is is that
[33:18] jesus christ himself coming and dwelling
[33:20] inside of you
[33:21] and revealing himself to you and that's
[33:23] why brother adam said god's purpose we
[33:24] find here in sending the holy spirit was
[33:27] one purpose that god himself might dwell
[33:30] in his church
[33:31] that god himself might dwell in his
[33:34] church
[33:34] and continue his plans through the
[33:36] church
[33:37] to continue his plans that one day he
[33:40] was
[33:41] working in jesus christ but now he's
[33:43] working in you and i
[33:45] to continue his plans and you to use
[33:47] your hands and use your feet and use
[33:49] your eyes and so forth
[33:50] that god was in christ continuing his
[33:52] plans through christ
[33:54] and out of christ into the church
[33:56] continuing his work through the church
[34:00] now now again i'm y'all know how i do
[34:03] lately
[34:04] i preach i preach directly from a
[34:06] message so the message that i'm
[34:08] preaching from is what was the holy
[34:09] ghost given for
[34:10] with a little bit of a little bit of
[34:12] lean in on questions and answers on the
[34:14] holy ghost
[34:16] what was the holy ghost given for so if
[34:18] you have any questions about this
[34:19] i always want my ministry to not point
[34:22] back to me
[34:22] don't go listen to what i said over and
[34:24] over again but go listen to what the
[34:25] prophet said
[34:27] go listen to what brother branham said
[34:28] and as you listen to him and dig into
[34:30] what he said
[34:31] then then it's actually pointing back to
[34:33] jesus christ and the revelation begins
[34:35] to unfold
[34:36] not because of what i said but because
[34:38] i'm repeating what he said i'm i'm
[34:40] i'm breaking down the nuggets of what
[34:42] he's already spoken and i hope that
[34:44] maybe gives you confidence what i'm
[34:46] saying this
[34:46] this afternoon now he said now we know
[34:49] what the holy spirit is we find out last
[34:51] night that is god
[34:53] now now brother brown said now when we
[34:55] think of god the father as jesus spoke
[34:57] of here his father god the son is jesus
[34:59] god the holy spirit
[35:00] is what we call it today now that does
[35:02] not mean that there is three individual
[35:04] distinct gods
[35:06] it means that there is one god and three
[35:08] offices
[35:09] now i'm not going to break down the
[35:10] godhead or anything this afternoon but
[35:12] brother
[35:12] brother ram said may we say it like this
[35:15] all that god
[35:16] was he poured into christ because he
[35:19] emptied himself and poured into christ
[35:21] and christ was the fullness of the
[35:22] godhead bodily all that jehovah was he
[35:25] poured into christ
[35:26] and all that christ was he poured into
[35:28] the church not into
[35:30] one individual but into the entire body
[35:33] so from that we can take the point that
[35:35] god wants to pour himself into you
[35:37] he wants to pour himself into the body
[35:39] he wants to pour himself
[35:41] and what does that mean to pour into it
[35:43] means that he wants to give you the same
[35:46] mind
[35:46] he wants to give you the same power he
[35:49] wants to give you the same works
[35:51] he wants to give you the same life he
[35:54] wants to give you the same
[35:55] qualities he wants to give you the same
[35:59] person the same person that walked on
[36:01] the shores of galilee
[36:02] he wants to put that in you and that's
[36:04] what that means when he poured he poured
[36:06] all of himself
[36:07] into christ and he walked on the shores
[36:10] of galilee fully
[36:11] manifesting every characteristic of god
[36:14] every quality of god
[36:15] all the patience and long-suffering all
[36:18] the joy and everything that goes into
[36:20] being god
[36:21] and he wants to pour all of that into
[36:23] you so
[36:24] if you want the holy ghost if you want
[36:26] all of that to be poured into you you've
[36:27] got to find out how it works
[36:29] because brother branham in this sermon
[36:31] he's talking about how god works
[36:32] according to his law
[36:34] and if you'll follow his law follow his
[36:36] plan for how to get the holy host in you
[36:39] then you can have god will pour all of
[36:41] that into you
[36:42] not into one individual but into his
[36:44] body and of which you are a part of you
[36:46] are a part of that body
[36:48] and god can pour into as he's pouring
[36:50] his spirit into the body he's pouring
[36:52] himself into you
[36:54] now this whole all through the
[36:56] scriptures it talks about god pouring
[36:57] himself
[36:58] and brother uh jesus there in luke 22 as
[37:01] he was having his last supper he said
[37:02] likewise also the cup after supper
[37:04] saying this
[37:05] this cup this cup with the wine in it
[37:08] this cup is the new testament in my
[37:09] blood which is shed or poured
[37:11] the original the original greek is
[37:13] poured for you this cup
[37:15] is put my my my life poured there on the
[37:18] cross it was poured out
[37:19] so that it could be poured in you it was
[37:22] blood his life was poured out on the
[37:24] crosses that was shed for you
[37:26] so that he could pour his life into you
[37:28] on the after the day of pentecost
[37:30] and titus it says not by works of
[37:32] righteousness it's not by our works
[37:35] that he pours his life into us which we
[37:37] have done but according to his mercy he
[37:40] saved us
[37:40] by the washing of regeneration and
[37:42] renewing of the holy ghost
[37:44] which he shed or poured on us abundantly
[37:47] he's
[37:47] pouring it on us abundantly if we'll
[37:50] work
[37:50] in the way that he has designed it out
[37:53] to be to be worked through
[37:55] let me pause like that just for a moment
[37:57] and kind of dwell on that
[37:58] do you know what that means god has a
[38:00] law through which he works
[38:03] just like an electrician if you go to
[38:05] build a house
[38:06] you there might be power running all
[38:09] through the power lines outside but if
[38:10] you can
[38:11] if you can have the correct
[38:13] understanding to know how to wire a
[38:15] house
[38:16] and run the wire from here to there and
[38:18] put
[38:19] everything in place and get everything
[38:21] in the way that
[38:22] will allow the electricity to flow then
[38:25] the electricity will flow through the
[38:27] house and will light all the light bulbs
[38:29] and if you can work according to god's
[38:31] law in that same manner
[38:33] then god's power can flow through you
[38:36] and that's why you've got to hear the
[38:38] preaching of the gospel so you'll know
[38:39] by what law
[38:40] this the holy spirit will flow through
[38:43] you the same way with a plumber if he's
[38:45] plumbing a house
[38:46] the water will flow through that house
[38:49] through the pipes if you work according
[38:50] to the right law
[38:52] and put everything in order and and and
[38:54] don't make no leaks or anything but
[38:56] everything situated in just the right
[38:58] way so it's working according to the law
[39:01] that when the inspector comes he can say
[39:03] everything's built according to the
[39:05] right
[39:05] the right pattern the right plan and
[39:07] when you turn on the valve then the
[39:09] water will flow through it
[39:10] that's the same way the holy ghost is
[39:13] well if you do everything exactly the
[39:15] way that god's word says
[39:17] the power of god will flow through you
[39:19] so that the holy ghost can fully be
[39:20] manifest
[39:21] and that god can feel you feel every
[39:24] fiber of your being
[39:26] that's what this gospel is for to allow
[39:28] the holy spirit to feel
[39:29] people to feel individuals so that you
[39:32] can manifest the word for your age
[39:36] in acts chapter 2 verse 17 and 28 it
[39:38] says and it shall come to pass in the
[39:39] last days as
[39:41] they were testifying of what what had
[39:43] taken place
[39:44] i will pour out of my spirit upon all
[39:46] flesh pour out i will pour it out
[39:49] and your sons and your daughters shall
[39:50] prophesy and your young men shall see
[39:52] visions and your old men shall dream
[39:54] dreams and on my sermons and on my
[39:56] handmaidens i will what
[39:58] i will pour out in those days of my
[40:00] spirit and they shall prophesy
[40:02] and in acts chapter 10 verse 45 when
[40:05] when peter was speaking to the
[40:06] to the the house of cornelius it says
[40:09] while peter yet spake these words the
[40:12] holy ghost fell on all them which heard
[40:14] the word
[40:14] and they of the circumcision which
[40:16] believed were astonished as many came
[40:18] with peter
[40:19] because that on the gentiles also was
[40:21] what poured out the gift of the holy
[40:23] ghost
[40:24] now the holy ghost was poured out there
[40:26] in the house of cornelius
[40:28] upon all them that heard the word so
[40:30] there is how you
[40:31] lay the conduit for the water to flow
[40:33] through there is how you get
[40:35] all the electrical wiring laid out so
[40:38] that the power of god can flow through
[40:40] is by the word if the word is preached
[40:42] in the right way
[40:43] and you receive it in the right way with
[40:45] a with a
[40:46] broken and a contrary heart ready to lay
[40:48] down all your old ideas and say
[40:50] i was wrong there and now i believe it
[40:53] this way because it's been vindicated
[40:55] it's been proven i recognize the truth i
[40:57] believe it
[40:58] that something has got to happen now now
[41:01] jesus told this parable of filling up a
[41:03] wine bottle and he said no man put the
[41:05] new wine into old bottles
[41:07] in other words you can't pour you can't
[41:09] pour the holy ghost
[41:11] into an old wine bottle that's all all
[41:15] hardened up and and all got it so
[41:18] just so stubborn that it won't listen to
[41:20] nothing else it's still
[41:22] so stubborn and it won't listen to the
[41:23] truth
[41:25] jesus said no man put us new wine into
[41:27] old bottles that's the new wine just
[41:29] burst the bottles
[41:30] and the wine is spilled and the bottles
[41:32] will be marred but
[41:33] new wine must be put into new bottles
[41:37] you can't put new wine into a bottle
[41:40] that's got so
[41:41] so hardened up and so resistant to the
[41:43] truth that every time you try to tell
[41:45] it's something new that maybe it hadn't
[41:46] hurt before that it just
[41:48] blows up and bust and then the way it
[41:50] was i was talking to somebody about how
[41:52] they were testifying about
[41:54] just sharing some things about what they
[41:55] had seen in the gospel and the person
[41:57] that they were talking to
[41:58] just blew up and said how can you teach
[42:00] me you come to teach me and they begin
[42:03] to blow up and that's
[42:04] that's putting new wine into an old
[42:06] bottle when somebody blows up
[42:08] and you maybe you'll be sitting there in
[42:09] church and you say i ain't listening to
[42:11] that
[42:11] i'm stubborn i'm stubborn god don't want
[42:14] somebody that's stubborn he wants
[42:15] somebody to be pliable like a little
[42:17] green tree
[42:18] like somebody that could just blow with
[42:20] the wind and look god teach
[42:22] me you know i was preaching up there in
[42:24] kentucky and i shared with them
[42:25] up there i said i'm going to share with
[42:26] you one of the greatest mysteries of the
[42:28] bible
[42:29] that if you want to get anything from
[42:30] god you come like a little child
[42:33] come like a little child with an empty
[42:34] bowl saying god
[42:36] teach me and i'm ready to receive i'm
[42:37] ready to do it what if you want me to be
[42:39] baptized over again
[42:41] if you want me to come and whatever you
[42:43] want me to do if it's according to your
[42:44] word i'm going to do it
[42:46] just like a little child you see then
[42:49] then you become a bottle that god can
[42:51] feel then you can become a bottle
[42:54] you're a bottle that's all oiled up and
[42:56] it's pliable and the more you put in it
[42:58] can expand and expand and
[43:00] allow allow itself to be filled an
[43:04] old bottle just just busts in the air
[43:06] every time you try to tell us something
[43:07] you see you see what happens is when you
[43:11] begin to recognize your purpose
[43:13] the holy ghost has a purpose and you
[43:16] have a purpose
[43:17] and your purpose is to be filled with
[43:18] the holy ghost god wants you to be
[43:21] filled up so much that he can use you
[43:23] god's purpose is to be
[43:24] for you to manifest his word and brother
[43:27] branham in this sermon he begins to
[43:29] right there in this
[43:30] in this sermon he begins to go and he
[43:32] begins to relate the story of ruth
[43:34] and about how ruth began to hunger and
[43:36] thirst for her purpose
[43:37] now the bible says that if you hunger
[43:39] and thirst for righteousness you shall
[43:41] be filled
[43:42] you shall be filled it'll be poured out
[43:44] if you're if you're hungering and
[43:46] thirsting for righteousness
[43:47] like ruth was brother brother said and
[43:50] as just as sure as you're hungering
[43:52] tonight for the holy spirit
[43:54] it's something in you pulling you that a
[43:57] purpose of your
[43:58] of god and your life has got to be
[44:00] fulfilled
[44:01] just like it was with ruth remember how
[44:04] ruth said
[44:05] she got to a place that she recognized
[44:07] that the place she was at
[44:08] she needed she needed to return go back
[44:11] to jerusalem she'd go back to israel she
[44:13] needed her purpose
[44:14] was not to stay there in moab but to
[44:17] follow
[44:17] and go by and ruth said and treat me not
[44:19] to leave thee or to return from
[44:21] following after thee
[44:22] for whether thou goest i will go and
[44:24] wither thou largest i will lodge
[44:26] thy people shall be my people and thy
[44:28] god my god
[44:29] in other words she began to recognize
[44:31] her purpose
[44:32] that the god that she the gods that she
[44:34] had been following there in moab
[44:36] she was changing from that purpose now
[44:39] to follow after this god
[44:40] the true god and she recognized her
[44:43] purpose i believe that's what brother
[44:44] branham was preaching about in
[44:45] desperation
[44:46] when you begin to recognize your purpose
[44:49] recognize what
[44:50] god has called you to do something
[44:52] begins to take hold in your life and you
[44:53] can't rest until you're satisfied
[44:56] i've got to be satisfied and the only
[44:58] thing that will satisfy me
[45:00] is the baptism of the holy ghost god
[45:02] filling me with his own life that's the
[45:04] only thing that's what i need
[45:06] brother said that's when a person's
[45:08] called a vision
[45:09] don't make any difference what our
[45:11] people said you're going over there and
[45:13] becoming a holy roller or something that
[45:14] didn't make any difference to ruth
[45:16] there was a purpose of god to be
[45:18] fulfilled
[45:19] when you can catch that vision and catch
[45:22] the purpose of god
[45:23] calling in your life it doesn't matter
[45:25] what somebody says about you it doesn't
[45:26] matter what somebody thinks about you
[45:29] you're there you're ready to see god's
[45:31] word fulfilled in your life
[45:35] you see god god in life in the life of
[45:38] ruth god was working on hurry on both
[45:40] ends
[45:41] see god god is doing something to make a
[45:43] way
[45:44] for your purpose so ruth was coming back
[45:46] she was coming back to the homeland
[45:48] and their boaz began that something was
[45:51] working in boaz and god's
[45:54] just the same way as
[45:57] just the same way as god god there on
[45:59] the cross performed
[46:00] the rite of redemption he performed
[46:03] everything that was necessary there on
[46:05] the cross since he died for you
[46:06] as god directed all of his anger there
[46:09] on jesus
[46:09] instead of directing it at you he
[46:11] directed every bit of his anger and his
[46:14] wrath on that man hanging on the cross
[46:16] so that you could come to him
[46:18] you say well i wonder if god is angry
[46:20] with me but he's already directed all of
[46:22] his anchor on him
[46:24] he poured it out on him all of his wrath
[46:26] there on the cross as he beat as he was
[46:28] beaten and and mocked and scorned all of
[46:31] that wrath was poured out on him so that
[46:33] you would have a way
[46:34] so that you would have a path to come
[46:36] back to jesus
[46:42] brother brown said that's the way god
[46:44] did
[46:46] he followed his own laws right see god
[46:49] don't expect you to follow his laws
[46:51] and that he not follow god is a man that
[46:53] he follows his own laws
[46:55] god cannot follow give you one law to
[46:57] follow him this is what brother brahma
[46:58] said
[46:59] and in him follow another he follows his
[47:01] own laws
[47:02] you see why it's so important to follow
[47:04] follow these laws
[47:06] to follow the prescription because the
[47:08] prescription is how the wiring in the
[47:10] house is done
[47:11] the prescription is how the pipes are
[47:13] laid and if you
[47:14] follow the law follow the work the way
[47:16] the follow the prescription
[47:18] then everything will work so that the
[47:20] holy ghost can flow
[47:22] through the right channel brother said
[47:25] then god in order to redeem the lost
[47:27] church the lost world the lost creation
[47:29] god who is infinite in spirit to redeem
[47:31] the lost human race
[47:33] god himself become kinfolks a man a son
[47:36] that he created in the womb of mary
[47:37] and then he made an incent or a
[47:39] testimony outside the gates of jerusalem
[47:41] he was lifted up between the heavens and
[47:43] earth and died and redeemed everything
[47:45] and in bleeding he sanctified a church
[47:47] that he himself might live in
[47:50] and fellowship and commune with that
[47:52] lost spot of fellowship from the garden
[47:54] of eden
[47:55] where god came down every evening
[47:58] church time so what was the holy ghost
[48:01] given for
[48:02] what was all of this for to restore you
[48:05] back to fellowship redemption was
[48:09] fellowship restored communion restored
[48:11] living in man again
[48:12] that's the purpose of the holy host the
[48:14] purpose of the holy ghost is restore you
[48:16] back to fellowship
[48:17] to restore you back to communion so that
[48:20] you have an understanding of what god
[48:21] wants so that you know what your purpose
[48:23] is
[48:24] so you recognize the purpose of god
[48:26] living in man
[48:27] brother said it that's the purpose of
[48:29] the holiest it's the father again
[48:31] god the father dwelling in you working
[48:33] out his plans to finish his plan of
[48:35] redemption
[48:36] working through you making you a
[48:39] co-worker
[48:40] with him giving you a place do you
[48:43] realize how magnificent that is that he
[48:45] didn't just come himself
[48:47] and do all the work there on the cross
[48:48] but he wanted you to have a role in
[48:50] saving your brother and sister he wanted
[48:53] you he wanted the ministers to preach
[48:55] the gospel he wanted you to testify at
[48:57] your workplace
[48:58] he wanted you to share it with your
[48:59] friends and he gave you a part in this
[49:02] so that you would be a co-worker with
[49:03] him that's what the holy ghost is given
[49:06] for
[49:08] giving you apart for your fallen lost
[49:10] brother and sister
[49:11] giving you his spirit and his love to go
[49:14] hunt the lost as he did
[49:16] in the garden of eden and it's there in
[49:17] this message that brother man talks
[49:19] about how there in the garden
[49:20] he began to say adam adam where art thou
[49:23] but now
[49:24] it's his spirit in you saying adam
[49:27] adam where arthur it's the spirit in the
[49:29] church that's what the holy ghost is
[49:31] giving for
[49:32] he's crying out for those lost people
[49:34] through you
[49:35] it's no more god walking through this to
[49:37] the through the evening time in the
[49:39] garden of eden but it's now him walking
[49:41] in you
[49:42] speaking out a message of peace and joy
[49:44] and deliverance to people that are lost
[49:46] that are bound in prison changed come
[49:48] like brother luis was saying this
[49:50] morning to come
[49:51] there's there's something to come to and
[49:53] it's the promise of the holy ghost
[49:58] is it it's the father manifesting
[49:59] himself in you in john chapter 14 verses
[50:01] 8 to 12.
[50:03] philip sayeth unto him lord show us the
[50:05] father and it sufficeth us
[50:08] show us the father i wonder if can we
[50:10] recognize where the father is now
[50:13] brother brown said that when you get the
[50:15] holy ghost you've got father showing the
[50:17] holy ghost living inside of you
[50:19] because it's not three different people
[50:21] it's that one god living inside of you
[50:23] so if you want to see the father show us
[50:25] the father
[50:26] where is the father now where is his
[50:27] tabernacle he's tabernacling in the
[50:30] hearts and lives of his children
[50:32] jesus saith unto him have i been so long
[50:34] time with you and thou has not known me
[50:36] philip
[50:37] he that has seen me have seen the father
[50:40] and how sayest thou then show us the
[50:41] father
[50:42] believeth thou not that i am in the
[50:44] father and the father in me the words
[50:46] that i
[50:46] speak unto you i speak not of myself but
[50:49] the father that dwelleth in me he doeth
[50:51] the works
[50:52] what is it today when somebody's
[50:54] preaching the gospel and speaking the
[50:55] words of eternal life
[50:56] it's the father speaking if it's not
[50:59] some man's ideas or man's opinion
[51:01] if it comes straight from the word but
[51:03] quickened by the holy scholastic it's
[51:05] not
[51:06] man speaking anymore but it's the father
[51:08] speaking and it's god performing in you
[51:10] his works it's not the man doing the
[51:12] works
[51:12] but it's the father doing the works
[51:15] believe me that i am in the father and
[51:17] the father in me or else believe me for
[51:19] the very work's sake
[51:20] verily verily i say unto you he that
[51:22] believeth on me the works that i do
[51:24] shall he do also and greater works than
[51:26] these shall he do
[51:28] because i go unto my father and he went
[51:31] to the father to put the father in you
[51:33] to declare the works of the father
[51:35] that's what the holy ghost was given for
[51:37] the holy ghost was given to declare the
[51:39] works of the father
[51:40] it's the father working in you and
[51:42] living in you
[51:43] to declare his great attributes in first
[51:46] john chapter 1 verses 1 to 3 it says
[51:48] that which was from the beginning which
[51:49] we have heard
[51:50] which we have seen with our eyes which
[51:52] we have looked upon and our hands have
[51:54] handled of the word of life
[51:55] for the life was manifested and we have
[51:58] seen it
[51:59] we have seen the life manifest do you
[52:01] know that's what the holy ghost was
[52:03] given for
[52:04] to manifest the life of god to put it on
[52:06] display
[52:08] not just some dogma not just some good
[52:10] teaching
[52:11] but the life the quickened word made
[52:14] alive
[52:15] resurrected from dead works god himself
[52:19] walking and tabernacling in you for the
[52:22] life was made manifested and we have
[52:24] seen it and bear witness
[52:25] and show unto you that eternal life
[52:28] which was with the father and was
[52:30] manifested
[52:31] unto what's he saying that we're showing
[52:34] unto you that eternal life
[52:36] that same eternal life which was with
[52:38] the father when was manifested unto us
[52:41] that which we have seen and heard
[52:42] declare we unto you that you also may
[52:44] have fellowship with us and
[52:46] truly our fellowship is with the father
[52:48] and with his son jesus christ
[52:51] that's why john chapter 14 says at that
[52:53] day
[52:54] he shall know that i am in my father and
[52:57] ye and me and i and you
[52:59] why because now the father is
[53:01] tabernacling himself and you
[53:03] declaring himself through you and then
[53:04] and that gives you
[53:06] reason to know that i am in my father
[53:09] jesus is in the father and you're in him
[53:11] and it's all wrapped up together he's in
[53:13] you by the new birth and you're in him
[53:14] because you're part of that body and
[53:16] he's the manifestation of the father
[53:18] that's why he's in him
[53:19] i and you i am in my father and ye and
[53:22] me and i and you
[53:23] we're all part of this one great
[53:25] mystical body and through that god and
[53:27] manifesting that
[53:28] life that same life that spoke the world
[53:30] into existence through you
[53:33] john chapter 16 verse 26 to 27 at that
[53:35] day ye shall ask in my name and i say
[53:38] unto you that i will pray the father for
[53:39] you i'm not going to pray the father for
[53:41] you
[53:42] in that day for the father himself
[53:44] loveth you
[53:45] because you have loved me and have
[53:47] believed that i came out from god and
[53:49] that day the father will be tabernacling
[53:51] in you
[53:52] it's the father manifesting himself what
[53:54] is the holy ghost given for
[53:56] god filling his church with the same
[53:59] life that was in jesus christ that's
[54:02] what the holy ghost
[54:03] was given for now now brother branham in
[54:06] this message
[54:07] he said after the reformation of 1500
[54:09] years of dark ages
[54:11] luther was the first reformer to come
[54:13] forth after the round of the apostles
[54:16] and then when luther come forth god
[54:19] tipped up a little bit he's got his
[54:22] just to paint a picture he's got his
[54:24] filling pot
[54:26] he's got his after 1500 years of dark
[54:28] ages
[54:30] 1500 years it's time to get to feeling
[54:33] how does he feel it how does he lay the
[54:36] pipework
[54:37] how does he lay the electrical wires so
[54:41] that the electricity can flow
[54:43] so that the water can flow how does he
[54:46] get it
[54:46] he said and then when luther come forth
[54:49] god
[54:50] tipped up a little bit of the spirit and
[54:51] poured it out upon the church in
[54:53] justification
[54:54] it's time to get to feeling now now see
[54:57] this is what the holy ghost was given
[54:58] for
[54:59] see how seeing why it's so important to
[55:02] listen to what brother graham said
[55:03] so many times we'll get in our head well
[55:05] i already know what the holy ghost was
[55:06] given for
[55:07] but you begin to listen to what he's
[55:09] saying right what is it for
[55:11] anybody he's bringing it up to a
[55:13] culmination in this message he's
[55:15] bringing up to
[55:16] what it's really for now listen he said
[55:19] god tipped up a little bit of the spirit
[55:20] and poured it out upon the church in
[55:22] justification
[55:23] why was he able to pour it out upon the
[55:24] church in justification
[55:26] because out of that dark age out of the
[55:29] out of the darkness
[55:30] came a little bit more of light as
[55:33] luther began to preach
[55:34] that it's not by doing no venus and by
[55:37] paying
[55:38] paying people to be prayed out of
[55:39] purgatory and all those you're not saved
[55:41] by that but you're saved
[55:43] by faith in jesus christ and that is
[55:45] counted for righteousness just the same
[55:47] way as it was
[55:48] to abraham that's what makes you just
[55:50] that's what makes the person feel with
[55:52] the holy ghost just
[55:54] down in your soul you're just because
[55:56] the price has already been paid
[55:57] and god is not looking at you he's
[55:59] looking through he's looking through the
[56:01] smoke of his burning blood
[56:03] he's looking through the smoke of that
[56:05] atoning sacrifice his blood has already
[56:07] paid the price and he's not looking at
[56:09] you
[56:09] he's he's made you just by his sacrifice
[56:13] and and that's what martin luther was
[56:15] preaching and that's what allowed
[56:17] the pot to be tipped up a little bit
[56:19] pour it out a little bit
[56:20] now i'm just dramatizing they're not an
[56:22] actual pot we're not talking about we're
[56:24] talking about the life of god being
[56:26] poured out into the church and he tipped
[56:27] he brother and said god tipped up a
[56:29] little bit of the spirit
[56:30] and poured it out upon the church in
[56:32] justification and then in the days of
[56:34] wesley
[56:35] he poured out a little more of himself
[56:38] into sanctification
[56:39] he poured out a little more of himself
[56:41] why could he pour out a little bit more
[56:43] because there was a little bit more
[56:44] light on the word
[56:46] and the more word you have the more word
[56:49] you believe the more
[56:50] spirit can be poured out and that's what
[56:53] the holy ghost has been taught wrong
[56:54] so many years the more words you have
[56:57] the more spirit can be poured out
[56:59] it's not that you can just go to a cam
[57:01] meeting or somewhere and you don't have
[57:03] a clue about nothing
[57:04] that you don't even have to listen to
[57:05] the word you just sit there and and you
[57:07] feel good or something
[57:08] but you've got to hear the word preached
[57:11] if the word
[57:12] is preached and you receive it then the
[57:14] spirit can be poured out
[57:15] the more word available the more spirit
[57:18] can be poured out
[57:19] that's why he said and then in the days
[57:21] of wesley he poured out a little more of
[57:23] himself
[57:24] a little more of himself into
[57:26] sanctification now you see where he's
[57:27] headed
[57:28] martin luther wesley a little more
[57:32] a little more see where we're supposed
[57:34] to be at now
[57:36] brother and i said look at the lutheran
[57:38] age you read history you read history
[57:40] look at their
[57:41] revival and what they did look how much
[57:43] greater the wesley revival was how much
[57:45] greater the wesley revival was
[57:48] and he said how much more power they had
[57:52] how much more power they had but in the
[57:54] minority
[57:57] and he said as the age has grown onto
[57:59] the end time
[58:00] god has been filling his church just
[58:02] look around and find out if that's truth
[58:05] or not
[58:06] just look around and and we can look
[58:08] inwardly and see
[58:10] look inwardly at the revelation of god
[58:12] that god has been pouring out in your
[58:15] own life
[58:16] that is how you should be able to
[58:17] recognize that god is filling his church
[58:20] in this hour
[58:21] get our mind like brother louise was
[58:23] talking about this morning get our mind
[58:24] if we can get our mind off of what other
[58:26] people are doing and
[58:26] how other people are preaching the
[58:28] message and doing all kinds i can't help
[58:30] that
[58:30] i can't help how people have made the
[58:32] message this and that and those and
[58:34] whatever i can't help that but i know
[58:35] that this message is true
[58:37] i know that there's power in this
[58:39] message i can't help what people are
[58:40] doing out there but i can help
[58:42] what i believe i can help myself i can
[58:45] hardly help myself
[58:46] i know this message is true and i know
[58:48] that there's power in it to change your
[58:50] life
[58:50] and brother brown said that the more
[58:52] word that's given the more
[58:54] spirit will be poured out and the more
[58:56] that's given
[58:57] the more is required but i'm saying now
[59:00] god he said as the light has begun to
[59:02] shine in this last days
[59:04] he's expecting us a great thing from us
[59:07] because where there's much given there's
[59:09] much required so he's going to require
[59:12] much more of us than he did of the
[59:14] lutherans or the methodists
[59:16] but because we walk in a greater light
[59:18] with a greater power
[59:20] with a greater witness than they had now
[59:23] we have a greater witness of the
[59:24] resurrection
[59:26] we have things more firmer more sure
[59:29] than they had
[59:30] a greater witness a greater a greater
[59:33] power
[59:34] what kind of a greater power greater
[59:36] power to be a light to the world
[59:38] to withstand everything every thought
[59:40] that the devil throws at you
[59:42] when the devil says you can't you can't
[59:43] do it we've got a greater witness in us
[59:46] a greater than he is in us than he is in
[59:49] the world
[59:49] it's god and you living it out it's not
[59:51] you it's not by your works
[59:53] but because you have received the word
[59:55] for your day that life
[59:56] is now being manifest in you and you've
[59:59] got a greater power and a greater
[1:00:00] witness
[1:00:01] and a greater testimony because god is
[1:00:04] now living in you in his fullness
[1:00:06] the fullness of the bride he's poured
[1:00:08] everything out
[1:00:09] all of himself is poured out into you
[1:00:11] the same characteristics the same life
[1:00:14] the same attributes
[1:00:15] the same love the same joy the same
[1:00:18] peace
[1:00:18] all that sameness that was in him on the
[1:00:21] shores of galilee is now in you
[1:00:25] and brother brown talks about how that
[1:00:27] it began coming forth from luther two
[1:00:29] shoots and moved on into a tassel and
[1:00:31] then onto the shook
[1:00:32] and then onto the corn and he talks
[1:00:34] about how that
[1:00:35] now listen we're talking about purpose
[1:00:37] that there's a purpose with the holy
[1:00:38] ghost that you have a purpose as an
[1:00:40] individual
[1:00:40] and he begins to say that you can't say
[1:00:43] the corn cannot say to the tassel
[1:00:45] i don't have no use for you because
[1:00:48] there's a purpose there's a purpose in
[1:00:50] every age a purpose to every believer
[1:00:53] and every age every believer has a
[1:00:54] purpose
[1:00:55] and so you can't look at somebody else
[1:00:57] that maybe doesn't have the capacity
[1:00:58] to go on as much as you and say there
[1:01:00] there's no purpose for you
[1:01:02] every believer i i'm trying to preach
[1:01:04] grace this afternoon
[1:01:06] every believer has a purpose don't let
[1:01:08] nobody tell you you don't have a purpose
[1:01:10] don't let nobody push you under their
[1:01:12] thumb and say well i'm greater than you
[1:01:14] if you can get down and hubble yourself
[1:01:16] brother i'm saying oh the tassel can't
[1:01:18] say to the leaf i have no use of you
[1:01:20] because the same life that was in the
[1:01:22] leaf made the tassel the same life that
[1:01:25] was in the tassel made the ear
[1:01:27] it was a lutheran church that made the
[1:01:28] wesley church it was the wesley church
[1:01:30] that made pentecost
[1:01:32] but pentecost what is it it's the
[1:01:34] restoration of the same kind of a grain
[1:01:36] that went into the ground at the
[1:01:37] beginning
[1:01:38] so every believer in this body has a
[1:01:40] purpose everybody has a purpose and
[1:01:42] they're all part of the plan we so we
[1:01:43] don't demean a holy ghost
[1:01:45] believer because for not understanding
[1:01:47] what you do
[1:01:48] we're trying to lift one another up
[1:01:50] we're trying to pull one another up and
[1:01:51] so we don't push
[1:01:52] we don't mock somebody because they may
[1:01:54] be stuck still inside of the eggshell
[1:01:56] but we're trying to help everybody out
[1:01:58] we're trying to pull one another out of
[1:01:59] the eggshell come on you can do a hatch
[1:02:02] come on it's time to start picking with
[1:02:04] that beak it's time to start
[1:02:06] speaking that word and come out of the
[1:02:07] egg come out of the egg we're not trying
[1:02:09] to keep you in the egg
[1:02:11] [Applause]
[1:02:13] excuse me
[1:02:17] see now now brother brown said now on
[1:02:21] this age that we're now live in this age
[1:02:23] this age is beyond pentecost it's time
[1:02:28] it's coming forth you are expected to be
[1:02:30] filled more because you've been given
[1:02:31] more word and so the holy ghost was
[1:02:33] given to teach
[1:02:34] to teach you it's beyond pentecost in
[1:02:37] other words it's moved on from the
[1:02:39] lutheran church
[1:02:40] to the wesleyan church to pentecost and
[1:02:42] now we're coming back to the ripening of
[1:02:44] the grain
[1:02:45] and that is what the holy oast is for
[1:02:47] the holy ghost is there not
[1:02:49] not just to give you the holy ghost not
[1:02:51] just to give you eternal life in your
[1:02:53] soul but it's actually there
[1:02:54] to begin transforming you from the
[1:02:56] inside out to it calls the maturity of
[1:02:58] the church
[1:02:59] the maturity of the bride to bring you
[1:03:02] into a maturity and to a place of
[1:03:03] maturity
[1:03:04] why because the holy the purpose of the
[1:03:06] holy oast the purpose of the holy oath
[1:03:08] is to eventually bring the dead from the
[1:03:10] ground
[1:03:11] that's what brother brown said in this
[1:03:12] message these are my words it's the holy
[1:03:15] ghost the purpose of the holy host is
[1:03:16] god
[1:03:16] the holy ghost expanding and expanding
[1:03:19] maturing you up
[1:03:20] until you come to a place where the holy
[1:03:21] where the dead will rise from the ground
[1:03:25] glory he said and i'm kind of jumping
[1:03:27] around a little bit i'm watching that
[1:03:28] clock
[1:03:29] brother abraham said and what was the
[1:03:30] holy ghost given for the same holy
[1:03:32] spirit that saved the lutherans
[1:03:34] they sanctified the methodists that
[1:03:37] baptized the pentecostals
[1:03:39] as now setting an order the coming of
[1:03:41] the lord jesus
[1:03:42] that same holy ghost is now setting in
[1:03:45] order
[1:03:45] the coming of the lord jesus how is it
[1:03:48] doing that
[1:03:49] he said when when it it'll be so
[1:03:52] powerful
[1:03:54] that body will come into this group of
[1:03:56] church
[1:03:57] that body of the lord jesus will come
[1:03:59] into this church in other words the
[1:04:00] church will be filled
[1:04:02] the church will be filled why because
[1:04:03] she's heard the word the full word
[1:04:05] the church will be so filled until that
[1:04:07] body will come into the church
[1:04:09] that'll draw the rest of them from the
[1:04:11] grave
[1:04:13] there'll be a resurrection that's what
[1:04:16] the holy ghost is for
[1:04:18] what is the holy ghost without us they
[1:04:20] cannot be made perfect
[1:04:22] without us they cannot be made perfect
[1:04:25] because it's the whole body being
[1:04:27] manifested
[1:04:28] and you take one part of that body out
[1:04:31] and the whole body is imperfect
[1:04:33] every member of the body is has a
[1:04:36] purpose
[1:04:36] every single member in that body is
[1:04:38] there for a purpose
[1:04:40] the lutherans were there for a purpose
[1:04:41] the wesleys were there for a purpose
[1:04:43] and you're there for a purpose and
[1:04:45] nobody here is demeaning you or pushing
[1:04:48] you down
[1:04:48] but there's a gospel here that if you
[1:04:50] receive it god can feel you in the same
[1:04:53] way that others have been filled
[1:04:55] i want to declare to you that if others
[1:04:56] have received the holy ghost
[1:04:58] then that should be a sign for you that
[1:04:59] you can receive it
[1:05:01] it's waiting there for you to receive it
[1:05:02] it's it's there brother i'm saying the
[1:05:04] skies are filled with
[1:05:06] they might be filled with the electric
[1:05:07] power but if you don't get the wiring
[1:05:09] right
[1:05:10] it can't be used but if you listen to
[1:05:12] the word and obey the word
[1:05:14] then that same power that has been given
[1:05:16] to others will be made manifest in your
[1:05:18] life
[1:05:20] what was the holy ghost given for to set
[1:05:22] an order the coming of the lord jesus
[1:05:24] christ
[1:05:25] to make a way for that body to be fully
[1:05:28] manifested in his bride
[1:05:29] the whole body of the word what body of
[1:05:32] the word the body of the son of man
[1:05:34] the son of man fully made manifested and
[1:05:37] a living walking group of people
[1:05:39] god fulfilling his word and manifesting
[1:05:41] himself in you
[1:05:43] the holy ghost was sent to live in you
[1:05:47] now i think it's so interesting how
[1:05:49] brother man preaches
[1:05:50] he preached after that sermon and he got
[1:05:52] really deep and then he backs off
[1:05:54] and he says he goes back to john 14 it
[1:05:56] says verily verily i say unto you he
[1:05:58] that believeth on me
[1:06:00] the works that i do shall he do also
[1:06:04] and greater works than these shall we do
[1:06:06] because i go to my father
[1:06:08] and he begins to talk about how there's
[1:06:10] many people that sit in the church and
[1:06:11] they say i believe
[1:06:13] i believe and there's a quote in this
[1:06:15] message where eva says you can say you
[1:06:17] believe the pastor
[1:06:18] but that ain't the holy ghost you could
[1:06:19] even say i believe
[1:06:21] why do you believe it because the word
[1:06:23] says so but that's not the holy ghost
[1:06:26] and all these evidences see you've got
[1:06:28] to have the holy ghost and the holy
[1:06:29] ghost is different from the way many
[1:06:31] people think
[1:06:32] it is the holy ghost is not just a dogma
[1:06:35] or not just being able to intellectually
[1:06:37] in your mind to understand
[1:06:39] a lot of the things that are preached
[1:06:41] even but the holy ghost is a person
[1:06:43] the holy ghost in you will actually give
[1:06:45] you the correct interpretation of the
[1:06:47] word
[1:06:47] the holy ghost in you will mix that
[1:06:49] letter of the word that killeth
[1:06:51] with the love of god and it will give
[1:06:52] you the right interpretation
[1:06:54] that letter that you can take and chop
[1:06:56] somebody's head off with it
[1:06:57] and kill somebody the letter that will
[1:06:59] kill your family if you don't use it
[1:07:01] right
[1:07:01] the letter that could kill a church you
[1:07:03] mix it with the holy ghost and power
[1:07:05] the love of god in there and it'll give
[1:07:07] you the right interpretation
[1:07:09] you've got to have the holy ghost
[1:07:11] brother brown said
[1:07:12] see you see he said yes i believe sure i
[1:07:14] believe jesus christ is the son of god
[1:07:16] but the devil believes the same thing
[1:07:18] the devil believes the same thing so
[1:07:20] it's not just
[1:07:21] sitting in church and saying yeah yeah
[1:07:23] that's good that's a good idea and you
[1:07:24] go right back into the world and
[1:07:26] nothing's been changed you don't have
[1:07:27] the power of god in your life nothing's
[1:07:29] been changed at all
[1:07:30] you don't have the life of god being
[1:07:31] made manifest brother said you are
[1:07:34] not converted until you've received the
[1:07:37] holy ghost
[1:07:38] that's right you are believing unto now
[1:07:40] the definition of converted
[1:07:42] converted if you go and look on the
[1:07:44] internet converted means
[1:07:45] of a building having been adapted to be
[1:07:48] suitable
[1:07:49] for a new purpose in other words you
[1:07:51] take an old run down building that's
[1:07:53] good for nothing
[1:07:54] like you were when you were out in the
[1:07:56] world and convert it
[1:07:57] and fix it up so that somebody can come
[1:08:00] and live in it
[1:08:01] and that's what god is doing even when
[1:08:03] he converts you
[1:08:05] he's made you into a building that he
[1:08:07] can come and live in
[1:08:08] he's made it so you can he can live
[1:08:11] inside of you because that's what the
[1:08:12] holy ghost is giving for
[1:08:14] not just so that you can be a good
[1:08:15] church member and so that you can nod
[1:08:17] your head and go along
[1:08:18] yeah i believe it i yes sir i agree with
[1:08:21] the pastor i love
[1:08:22] i love the pastor i agree i agree with
[1:08:24] the word i agree with the word see
[1:08:26] there's a when the holy ghost comes in
[1:08:27] you it will make you really agree with
[1:08:30] the word
[1:08:30] where you thought that you agreed before
[1:08:32] the holy ghost
[1:08:33] will give you the right interpretation
[1:08:35] of the word why because
[1:08:36] it is the interpreter of the word the
[1:08:39] interpretation of the word is the word
[1:08:41] made alive the word actually living
[1:08:44] in you when it's there on the page it's
[1:08:46] dead
[1:08:47] it's dead letter it can kill it can kill
[1:08:49] and destroy but when the holy ghost
[1:08:51] comes
[1:08:51] it'll raise it from the gray and raise
[1:08:53] it up
[1:08:54] just like it raised jesus dead body
[1:08:57] laying then
[1:08:57] there in the tomb that body was spoken
[1:09:00] word body
[1:09:01] it was a spoken word spoken into the
[1:09:03] womb of mary and they're
[1:09:04] laying the tomb but one day at the
[1:09:06] rising of the sun that life came back
[1:09:08] into their body and caused it to rise up
[1:09:13] and brother brown said you're not sealed
[1:09:15] by believing unto but sealed by the holy
[1:09:17] ghost
[1:09:18] ephesians 4 30 grieve not the holy
[1:09:20] spirit of god whereby you're sealed
[1:09:21] until the day of
[1:09:22] your redemption that seals you when you
[1:09:25] found
[1:09:26] favor with god and he shields you by the
[1:09:28] holy spirit
[1:09:30] now i don't want to leave loose ends
[1:09:32] don't you just hate it when a minister
[1:09:33] preaches stuff like when you found favor
[1:09:35] with god and he leaves that loose end
[1:09:36] and you're sitting there thinking well
[1:09:37] how am i supposed to find favor with god
[1:09:40] how do you find favor with god through
[1:09:42] his word
[1:09:43] you find favor with god by doing the
[1:09:46] only thing that you can do
[1:09:48] is believe his word what else can you do
[1:09:51] but believe his word there's no work
[1:09:53] that you can do
[1:09:54] you can't beat yourself on the back with
[1:09:56] a whip or anything
[1:09:57] it's not how long you pray or things
[1:09:59] like that it's not even how much you
[1:10:01] come to church
[1:10:03] but that's part of it it's how much you
[1:10:05] believe god's word and when you believe
[1:10:07] god's word all of those things
[1:10:09] begin to become an outward manifestation
[1:10:11] that's why when you begin to believe
[1:10:13] god's word
[1:10:13] and take it at his word that something
[1:10:15] will be recognizable in you
[1:10:18] if you're not at the house of god every
[1:10:20] time the doors are open then that shows
[1:10:22] something is wrong in your life it shows
[1:10:25] that you have not
[1:10:26] identified the purpose of the holy ghost
[1:10:28] because if you see
[1:10:30] the vision if you see the purpose of the
[1:10:32] holy ghost in your life
[1:10:33] you'll be there every time the chur the
[1:10:35] word is being preached
[1:10:38] well i didn't mean to get on there
[1:10:40] listen first peter chapter one says
[1:10:42] seeing you have purified your souls
[1:10:46] you have purified your souls and obeying
[1:10:48] the truth through the spirit
[1:10:50] unto unfeigned love of the brethren see
[1:10:52] that you love one another with a pure
[1:10:53] heart fervently
[1:10:54] being born again not of uncorruptable
[1:10:57] corruptable seed but of incorruptible by
[1:11:00] the word of god which liveth and abideth
[1:11:02] forever it's the word of god
[1:11:04] the word of god is how you find favor
[1:11:06] with god
[1:11:07] the word of god now now if you actually
[1:11:10] catch the purpose of god in your life
[1:11:12] that that is what you're supposed to be
[1:11:14] doing here on earth is get the holy
[1:11:15] ghost
[1:11:16] that it will not matter how mean
[1:11:18] somebody is to you
[1:11:20] it will not matter what it speaks behind
[1:11:22] the pulpit it will not matter how rough
[1:11:24] somebody is
[1:11:25] you catch that purpose if you've got
[1:11:27] that vision you will do whatever it
[1:11:29] takes to get that holy ghost in your
[1:11:30] life
[1:11:31] you will drop everything until the life
[1:11:33] of god is manifested in you
[1:11:35] when you catch the purpose of god in
[1:11:37] your life that that's what god wants to
[1:11:38] do with you
[1:11:39] that that promise is laying there for
[1:11:41] you to get it he promised it
[1:11:43] and if he promised it then come and get
[1:11:45] it he promised it
[1:11:49] oh yeah sometimes you got to be a little
[1:11:51] jacob it don't matter how mean somebody
[1:11:54] is some part sometimes you've got it'll
[1:11:55] be a little shy stress
[1:11:57] and do whatever it takes to get that
[1:11:59] word if i have to sneak in before the
[1:12:01] service starts to get those message
[1:12:02] books off the front view
[1:12:04] after if i have to do whatever it takes
[1:12:06] now listen this might be a little bit
[1:12:07] hurtful or whatever
[1:12:08] but you see your eternal life is at
[1:12:10] stake your eternal life is at stake
[1:12:13] what does it matter if the preaching
[1:12:14] gets a little bit hurtful sometimes
[1:12:16] if it will save your soul and give you
[1:12:18] eternal life but brother bob that stings
[1:12:20] it stings when somebody preaches the
[1:12:21] truth
[1:12:22] extinct but the truth is what will set
[1:12:24] you free the truth is what will bring
[1:12:26] deliverance
[1:12:27] the truth is what rick causes you to
[1:12:29] realize that you're still
[1:12:31] that little eagle in the egg and you've
[1:12:33] got to come out
[1:12:34] you're not supposed to be in the egg and
[1:12:37] when the pre when the gospel is preached
[1:12:39] it causes you to realize
[1:12:40] and begin into desperation
[1:12:43] glory brother brown said it could
[1:12:46] compare compared to antichrist to answer
[1:12:48] christ's spirit
[1:12:50] the antichrist says yeah i believe
[1:12:52] casting out devils
[1:12:54] but they can't go all the way on to the
[1:12:56] holy ghost
[1:12:57] why they they get caught up in the
[1:12:59] intellectual
[1:13:00] mental conception i go to church i kind
[1:13:03] of understand what the preaching is
[1:13:05] about not really
[1:13:06] i don't have i know i don't have a full
[1:13:07] revelation they're kind of catching on
[1:13:09] to some things
[1:13:10] and they get they get satisfied with the
[1:13:13] mental interpretation
[1:13:15] their own mental conception
[1:13:18] now do you all realize hold on now y'all
[1:13:21] y'all lift up your weary heads wake up
[1:13:23] just for a second
[1:13:24] do you realize what the difference
[1:13:26] between an intellectual believer
[1:13:28] and a real holy ghost believer is right
[1:13:30] everybody starts off as an intellectual
[1:13:33] exactly everybody starts off why because
[1:13:36] you when you hear the word
[1:13:37] it goes in your head it goes in your
[1:13:39] thinking channel
[1:13:40] and you're thinking about it and you're
[1:13:42] pondering over it and you're battling it
[1:13:44] out
[1:13:45] wondering whether this is true or not
[1:13:46] wondering what jesus really meant by
[1:13:48] matthew 28 19
[1:13:50] if that what how does that compare with
[1:13:51] acts 2 38
[1:13:53] and you're battling it out and you're
[1:13:54] wondering you don't understand
[1:13:56] but then you see that's mental that's a
[1:13:59] mental conception
[1:14:00] a middle understanding that's not what
[1:14:02] saves you but you got to go through that
[1:14:05] you got to start off with an intellect
[1:14:07] we don't want to stay at intellectual
[1:14:09] and be a stand in intellectualism is the
[1:14:11] danger
[1:14:12] stay in there staying there is what
[1:14:15] judas began to get satisfied and he in
[1:14:17] his intellectual thinking he began to
[1:14:19] wonder
[1:14:21] now now john chapter 12 verses 4 to 6 is
[1:14:24] where judas really had a little turning
[1:14:25] point
[1:14:26] he got it all in his head that he knew
[1:14:28] more than jesus
[1:14:29] why why would you let that little woman
[1:14:32] come and
[1:14:32] pour pour out break that bottle of woman
[1:14:35] all over your feet which she could have
[1:14:36] done
[1:14:37] gone and done a whole lot more with that
[1:14:39] the bible says that judah said then
[1:14:40] saith one of his disciples
[1:14:42] judas his carrot simon's son which
[1:14:44] should not we should betray him why was
[1:14:46] not this oint my soul
[1:14:47] for 300 pence and given to the poor why
[1:14:50] was
[1:14:50] not and the bible says this he said not
[1:14:53] that he cared for the poor but because
[1:14:54] he was a thief and had to bag and bear
[1:14:57] what was put therein and he began in his
[1:14:59] own mind he began to think that he knew
[1:15:02] better than the preacher
[1:15:03] he knew better than the pastor he knew
[1:15:05] better than the ministers on how to get
[1:15:07] the holy ghost
[1:15:08] he knew better than somebody else
[1:15:09] preaching the true word and that's when
[1:15:10] you get that intellectual the
[1:15:12] intellectual life you begin to get
[1:15:14] satisfied
[1:15:15] don't get satisfied you remember brother
[1:15:17] brother brown said somebody came up to
[1:15:18] him and said well what more can i do but
[1:15:20] believe
[1:15:21] and brother and i said yeah that's all
[1:15:22] you can do but there's something else to
[1:15:24] follow that
[1:15:25] when god recognizes that you have
[1:15:27] believed then he will seal you with the
[1:15:29] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:15:31] so to be satisfied with an intellectual
[1:15:33] state
[1:15:34] is the worst thing right and one of the
[1:15:36] worst because
[1:15:37] you'll keep coming to church you'll keep
[1:15:39] sitting there on the pew being religious
[1:15:41] in a religious state
[1:15:42] sitting there thinking that you're right
[1:15:44] because you have a good
[1:15:45] mental understand mental conception
[1:15:48] thinking about what it's right to be a
[1:15:50] christian i'm a good person
[1:15:53] i'm a good person i can be a good
[1:15:54] christian and just go off and live
[1:15:56] any kind of way live in adultery live in
[1:15:59] filth and
[1:16:00] allow my family to live in filth and all
[1:16:01] that kind of stuff but
[1:16:03] let the holy ghost come and straighten
[1:16:05] out the correct interpretation of the
[1:16:06] word
[1:16:07] and actually live inside of you and see
[1:16:09] see what change it will be it will
[1:16:11] wrought in your life
[1:16:12] see there's a difference between
[1:16:13] something you can reason about
[1:16:15] and something that is alive there's a
[1:16:18] difference between something that you
[1:16:20] can reason about and question and ponder
[1:16:22] over
[1:16:23] and something that is alive and see
[1:16:24] that's what the holy ghost was given for
[1:16:27] to bring the word to life
[1:16:31] to bring it to life
[1:16:38] let me stop on this for a second i'm not
[1:16:40] stopping
[1:16:41] i just dwell on this
[1:16:45] now now my brother jesus was talking
[1:16:47] about when he began to be questioned
[1:16:48] about marriage and divorce
[1:16:50] marriage and divorce is one of those
[1:16:52] like off topic things because
[1:16:54] it's so it seems so hard as you go back
[1:16:56] i actually have been spending some more
[1:16:57] time listening to marriage and divorce
[1:16:59] and i believe i believe that that
[1:17:01] message has one of the
[1:17:02] is one of the greatest grace messages if
[1:17:05] you'll listen to it and the way that it
[1:17:07] was really meant
[1:17:08] somebody was telling me how they went to
[1:17:09] a church and on the on the ministry's
[1:17:11] wall back there in the back was a little
[1:17:12] sign that said don't preach about
[1:17:14] marriage and divorce
[1:17:15] and that's the way many people have
[1:17:16] treated marriage divorce because they're
[1:17:18] afraid of it
[1:17:19] but in that sermon do you know the true
[1:17:21] rev i believe the true revelation of
[1:17:23] marriage and divorce is as god is trying
[1:17:25] to
[1:17:25] fully unite with his bride you can't
[1:17:28] have a wedding unless the
[1:17:30] old man is fully dead and brother
[1:17:32] branham in that message
[1:17:33] lays out all the reasons why you can't
[1:17:36] get married
[1:17:37] if there's still a living if it's still
[1:17:39] a living partner all those things
[1:17:40] but now he's coming he's coming to bring
[1:17:42] grace to prove to you to show to you
[1:17:45] that the old man is dead
[1:17:47] and there's no reason why you can't be
[1:17:50] fully united with the bridegroom
[1:17:55] no no i didn't mean to get off of that
[1:17:56] but listen in mark chapter 10 verse 45
[1:17:59] and they said moses suffered to write a
[1:18:01] bill of divorcement
[1:18:02] and to put her away and this is the
[1:18:04] reason we get in our in our head we
[1:18:06] understand
[1:18:06] we understand marriage and divorce by
[1:18:08] our reasoning and jesus answered and
[1:18:10] said unto them for the hardness
[1:18:12] of your heart he wrote you this precept
[1:18:14] he wrote he allowed you to
[1:18:16] write a law of divorcement why because
[1:18:19] of your hard hearts
[1:18:21] what was the holy ghost given for the
[1:18:24] holy ghost was given
[1:18:25] to take that old stony heart out
[1:18:28] and make your heart put the love of god
[1:18:31] in that heart
[1:18:32] so that then you can interpret the word
[1:18:35] correctly
[1:18:37] so then when you have the love of god in
[1:18:39] your heart
[1:18:40] and you've got when you and your wife
[1:18:44] are both filled with the holy ghost and
[1:18:46] the love of god has preeminence in your
[1:18:49] home
[1:18:50] there ain't going to be no writing of
[1:18:51] divorcement there ain't going to be no
[1:18:53] writing of divorce
[1:18:54] but that's why jesus said but from the
[1:18:56] beginning of the creation god made them
[1:18:58] male and female
[1:18:59] for this call shall a man leave his
[1:19:01] father and mother and cleave to his wife
[1:19:04] why
[1:19:04] because in the beginning adam had love
[1:19:07] for his wife
[1:19:08] it was love and that's what god that's
[1:19:10] what the holy ghost is giving for
[1:19:11] to take us back so that we love one
[1:19:14] another
[1:19:14] not so that we can read those quotes in
[1:19:16] marriage and divorce bless
[1:19:18] god i've got a right to put my wife away
[1:19:20] because you won't bear me a child
[1:19:22] but if the holy ghost is in you it will
[1:19:24] interpret the word correctly
[1:19:26] so that you will love your wife and do
[1:19:29] like adam and try to redeem your wife
[1:19:31] back now it wasn't an attribute adam's
[1:19:32] attribute
[1:19:33] to do that to be able to do that but
[1:19:35] jesus christ
[1:19:36] could to redeem his wife back and that
[1:19:39] same attribute by the holy ghost will be
[1:19:42] and a man or a dog a son or a daughter
[1:19:44] of god that really has
[1:19:45] that love to try to redeem his spouse
[1:19:49] to try to talk to them in love to try to
[1:19:52] work with them and
[1:19:53] share the gospel with him am i okay
[1:19:58] y'all y'all believe what i'm saying
[1:20:02] even if you don't believe it just just
[1:20:04] ponder on these things i'm talking about
[1:20:05] i'm not talking about marriage and
[1:20:07] divorce someone i'm talking about
[1:20:08] love i'm talking about that's what the
[1:20:10] holy ghost was given for
[1:20:11] to make you love one another to make you
[1:20:14] love one another to make you love your
[1:20:15] spouse
[1:20:16] and that's what the holy ghost brother
[1:20:17] brown said the holy ghost interprets the
[1:20:19] word
[1:20:20] it gives the correct interpretation of
[1:20:22] the word it manifests the word
[1:20:25] it makes the dead letter live it brings
[1:20:29] forth fruits
[1:20:30] it brings every promise to pass that's
[1:20:32] what the holy ghost was given for
[1:20:34] the holy the purpose of the holy ghost
[1:20:36] is to bring
[1:20:37] forth a resurrection it's to raise up
[1:20:41] that's what the purpose was that's why
[1:20:43] adam abraham back in
[1:20:45] in the old testament had such confidence
[1:20:47] that god would raise up if he killed his
[1:20:50] son isaac
[1:20:50] that god would raise him up because he
[1:20:53] had confidence in this
[1:20:54] power of the resurrection that god that
[1:20:57] that
[1:20:58] same spirit that raised christ from the
[1:21:00] grave
[1:21:01] that same spirit that's that's an
[1:21:03] attribute of god the holy oak state
[1:21:05] raises up from the dead
[1:21:08] hebrews 11 says of whom it was said that
[1:21:10] and isaac shall i see be called
[1:21:12] accounting that god was able to raise
[1:21:14] him up even from the dead
[1:21:15] from which also he received him in a
[1:21:17] figure abraham had
[1:21:18] confidence that there was resurrection
[1:21:21] power in that spirit
[1:21:23] and brother abraham said what is eternal
[1:21:26] life
[1:21:29] all that the father has given me will
[1:21:31] come to me all that comes to me i'll
[1:21:32] give him the holy ghost
[1:21:33] and i'll raise him up at the last day i
[1:21:36] will do it
[1:21:37] he said not no if and ans about it
[1:21:41] i will all that comes and i will give
[1:21:44] eternal life he will have to raise
[1:21:46] he will have to raise because he's got
[1:21:48] eternal life
[1:21:50] he has to come can't die no more than
[1:21:52] god can die do you see what the holy
[1:21:54] ghost does
[1:21:55] when the holy ghost comes into your life
[1:21:56] it raises
[1:21:58] the it raises the word to life in your
[1:22:01] life
[1:22:02] it actually causes it to live it raises
[1:22:04] you from the dead works that you do the
[1:22:06] dead works of
[1:22:07] of trying to do something for god or
[1:22:09] trying to just coming to church and
[1:22:10] trying to do something
[1:22:12] but it raises you from dead works to
[1:22:14] actually live serving a living god
[1:22:16] that god is actually living in you it
[1:22:19] raises it
[1:22:20] that's why as i was kind of studying on
[1:22:22] this i began to think back to that that
[1:22:24] old song remember
[1:22:25] i don't know if you've ever heard that
[1:22:26] song ain't no grave gonna hold me down
[1:22:29] they clawed eli now they turned it into
[1:22:31] a old bluegrass song with uh
[1:22:33] uh rock guitar howling in the background
[1:22:35] and everything if you're listening to
[1:22:36] the other day but it was originally
[1:22:38] originally a song that claude eli was a
[1:22:40] songwriter he got he got tuberculosis
[1:22:42] when he was real sick when he was real
[1:22:44] young about 12 years old
[1:22:46] and he just began the holy ghost came
[1:22:47] upon him there when he was dying of
[1:22:49] tuberculosis in his bed
[1:22:51] and he rose up from his bed and began to
[1:22:52] sing that song
[1:22:54] ain't no grave gonna hold my body down
[1:22:56] why because that's the power of the holy
[1:22:58] ghost
[1:22:59] to raise you up from the grave to raise
[1:23:02] you up from dead dark cold
[1:23:03] denominational ideas
[1:23:05] from rage to raise your up from your old
[1:23:07] way of thinking
[1:23:08] to raise you up from sin and despair to
[1:23:11] raise you up and if you were to die
[1:23:13] and go down into the grave and that
[1:23:15] eternal life was
[1:23:17] living in your soul that ain't no grave
[1:23:19] gonna hold that body down
[1:23:21] because that is what the holy ghost is
[1:23:23] given for
[1:23:24] the holy ghost was given to raise you up
[1:23:27] to raise you up that you cannot
[1:23:29] keep the revealed word in the grave you
[1:23:33] can't keep it down
[1:23:34] you can't keep it down you can't keep
[1:23:36] the revealed word down in about in the
[1:23:37] heart of a believer
[1:23:39] the devil can try to put you down and
[1:23:40] tell you oh it ain't for you
[1:23:42] don't even bother trying anymore but
[1:23:45] before long
[1:23:46] god will begin to raise that spirit up
[1:23:48] within you because why you can't
[1:23:50] keep it down that's what the holy ghost
[1:23:52] was given for that's why i was put into
[1:23:54] the church
[1:23:55] to show to prove to god that he loves
[1:23:57] you to prove that he's there for you
[1:23:59] he's with you and he said he'll never
[1:24:02] leave you for sake it doesn't matter
[1:24:03] how down you get how dark the world gets
[1:24:06] you cannot keep the word down
[1:24:12] you see the purpose the purpose is to
[1:24:15] manifest
[1:24:17] the same works brotherham said the
[1:24:19] purpose of sin of the holy ghost was
[1:24:21] for god to continue through a bunch of
[1:24:23] people to continually manifest god to
[1:24:25] the world
[1:24:27] not by creed not by the nomination
[1:24:30] but what by by the power of his
[1:24:33] resurrection
[1:24:35] that's what the holy ghost has given for
[1:24:37] the holy ghost
[1:24:38] is the power of the resurrection that
[1:24:40] you cannot keep down that the devil keep
[1:24:43] that king keep down
[1:24:44] by making his word real
[1:24:48] by taking his promise and standing on
[1:24:50] the side of the minority and believing
[1:24:52] god
[1:24:52] and watch the black skies move back and
[1:24:55] the power of god
[1:24:56] move in and take over that's what he
[1:24:59] wants brother brown said
[1:25:00] that's what the holy ghost was sent for
[1:25:03] that's what purpose he sent it for
[1:25:05] we know what it is now brother braham
[1:25:07] said
[1:25:08] and that's why he sent it doesn't that
[1:25:11] give you confidence this afternoon
[1:25:13] that now you know what the holy ghost is
[1:25:15] given for
[1:25:16] that should you know what the purpose is
[1:25:19] it's to manifest himself to continue
[1:25:22] through
[1:25:22] you to continue his life in you
[1:25:26] by the power of his resurrection by the
[1:25:29] power of that same life that raised up
[1:25:31] christ from the grave
[1:25:33] and if that same life lives in you then
[1:25:35] that same
[1:25:36] power will raise you up from your dead
[1:25:38] works it will give you power
[1:25:40] to withstand everything that the devil
[1:25:42] throws at you
[1:25:43] so then it becomes not you doing the
[1:25:45] work it's
[1:25:46] christ living in you
[1:25:51] so many people have made the gospel a
[1:25:53] book of rules and a book of works
[1:25:55] but what it is that's god living in you
[1:25:57] that you don't have to do anything
[1:25:59] that should liberate and free every
[1:26:01] believer that you don't have to do
[1:26:02] anything all you have to do is
[1:26:04] yield yourself to him to allow him to
[1:26:06] have full sway in you
[1:26:08] like brother louise was talking about
[1:26:09] this morning just fully yield yourself
[1:26:12] yield yourself as a vessel that he can
[1:26:14] come and inhabit and live in
[1:26:15] and how do you do it by surrendering to
[1:26:17] the word and how do you surrender to the
[1:26:19] word
[1:26:20] if you don't know the word get into the
[1:26:21] word and and
[1:26:23] and and give him give yourself to it
[1:26:26] brother i'm saying god came down
[1:26:28] made a body lived in it shed that blood
[1:26:30] for the sanctifying of this which
[1:26:32] absolutely expelled the guilt
[1:26:34] of sin and shame i'm just kind of going
[1:26:37] to kind of skip ahead a little bit
[1:26:39] brother brother said
[1:26:42] oh my i'm trying to find a place to
[1:26:46] i'm i'm going i'm going to stop right
[1:26:48] here we're going to read a few
[1:26:50] few more little things now the brother
[1:26:51] brother said the holy ghost the holy
[1:26:53] ghost to identify
[1:26:54] whether it's really in you he said the
[1:26:56] holy ghost will follow god's word to the
[1:26:58] letter
[1:26:59] now that don't mean that you know
[1:27:00] everything all at once but when you
[1:27:02] are presented with the word there's
[1:27:04] going to be a desire in you because
[1:27:06] something's been changed in you
[1:27:07] that i want to be right i want to follow
[1:27:11] god's word
[1:27:12] and you'll do everything you can to
[1:27:13] follow that word because brother braham
[1:27:15] said the holy ghost
[1:27:16] in you will follow god's word to the
[1:27:18] letter and a preacher behind the pupil
[1:27:20] that ain't got grace enough to preach it
[1:27:22] i doubt he's got it well that's what the
[1:27:23] holy ghost is for that's been one of my
[1:27:25] biggest grievances
[1:27:26] through my through my walk as a
[1:27:27] christian as people ministers that will
[1:27:29] draw back and won't share the full
[1:27:31] gospel
[1:27:32] i won't preach the whole thing but if
[1:27:33] the gospel is pre if the gospel is there
[1:27:35] if we've heard it
[1:27:36] then let's preach it glory brother i
[1:27:39] said the holy ghost is there to give
[1:27:41] unction to the preacher
[1:27:42] it's to set the church in order it's to
[1:27:45] unite
[1:27:46] us together with power it's to give
[1:27:48] holiness
[1:27:49] to the group the holy ghost is to bring
[1:27:52] a
[1:27:52] unity of spirit well what about that the
[1:27:55] same thing that was given there on
[1:27:57] on the day of pentecost when it first
[1:27:58] failed to bring up everyone in
[1:28:00] one accord to bring a unity of spirit is
[1:28:03] to unite us together with
[1:28:05] love brotherly love yeah and brother
[1:28:08] brown said now people look at me in the
[1:28:09] face a lot of hands went up you had the
[1:28:11] holy ghost see sure
[1:28:12] there was it's examining time it's
[1:28:14] examining to see
[1:28:16] whether you have truly received whether
[1:28:17] you meet the requirements and brother
[1:28:19] then begin to tell that story of the
[1:28:21] little fire the little jeffersonville
[1:28:23] fire truck and the little clarksville
[1:28:25] fire truck that pulled up at the fire
[1:28:27] and they began to squirt a little water
[1:28:28] here and squirt a little water there
[1:28:30] and then somebody from the big
[1:28:32] louisville fire company pulled up
[1:28:34] and he said they jumped off of that
[1:28:35] truck and they ran toward the fire
[1:28:37] because they knew what to do
[1:28:38] they knew how to put it out and they ran
[1:28:40] toward the fire and it almost sounded
[1:28:41] like an action scene he said
[1:28:42] they ran toward the fire and they tossed
[1:28:44] the axe ahead of them and before they
[1:28:46] got there the axe went through that
[1:28:47] window and they were coming to put that
[1:28:49] fire out because they were coming
[1:28:50] why they were coming committed they were
[1:28:53] coming
[1:28:54] he was coming to put that fire out with
[1:28:56] a vision
[1:28:57] he had caught he knew what his purpose
[1:28:59] was and that's how every believer should
[1:29:01] be as a musician
[1:29:02] come on forward and we'll end on this
