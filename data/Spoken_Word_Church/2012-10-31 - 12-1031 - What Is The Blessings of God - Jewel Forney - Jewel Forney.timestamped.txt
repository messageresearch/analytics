[7:25] 16 take methew the 16th chapter and and
[7:29] I want to begin reading at the 15th
[7:31] verse Jesus speaking here he says and he
[7:35] said unto them who say yeah that I am
[7:39] and Simon Peter answered and said thou
[7:41] the Christ the son of the Living God
[7:44] right and Jesus answered he said unto
[7:46] him blessed are thy
[7:50] Simon born of Jonah for flesh and blood
[7:53] has not revealed it unto thee but my
[7:55] Father which is in heaven and I say Al

[8:31] more time father God I trust God that
[8:34] you come and take over lord and give me
[8:38] the strength to surrender myself and get
[8:40] out of the way Lord now father God I
[8:42] commit this service to you in the name
[8:44] of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless
[8:48] you you may be seated one
[8:50] moment thank the Lord for reading of the
[8:53] word of God this evening as I took from
[8:56] the the word of God from the book of
[8:58] Deuteronomy it say says here he says all
[9:01] the blessings shall come on thee and
[9:04] overtake thee if thou shall hugen unto
[9:06] the voice of the Lord thy God and I took
[9:10] a title this evening overtaken by the
[9:14] revelation of blessings everybody want
[9:17] to be overtaken if it's a b blessing
[9:20] that we want if I'm going to be
[9:21] overtaken by something let God bless me
[9:25] H but I begin to look I begin to think
[9:28] on this thing excuse me on overtaken by
[9:33] blessing people when they overtaken by
[9:36] something it's not you are looking for
[9:39] it to happen it just happened right if
[9:42] somebody was overtaken in a car rate
[9:44] they were not planning the carate it
[9:46] just happened Hallelujah you know in
[9:49] words just it's something that happened
[9:51] that you was not planning for it to
[9:53] happen but it happened but I say how
[9:56] much more if we can come to the
[9:58] revelation of almighty God and God
[10:01] overtake Us by blessing not even when we
[10:03] are looking for it it just happened I
[10:06] begin to take here I begin to look at
[10:08] this thing right here overt taking my
[10:10] blessing now we really here when God
[10:12] gave this Revelation to Peter I knew
[10:15] Peter was not looking for it right H and
[10:18] God came to Peter and said to Peter who
[10:21] the man said that I am Peter said th of
[10:24] Christ the son of the Living God and
[10:26] Jesus said blessed are thy son born
[10:29] Jonah for Flesh and Blood never revealed
[10:32] us to you you have been overtaken by the
[10:34] revelation of blessing how we realize
[10:37] that God blessed him we realize here
[10:40] that blessing is an eternal attribute
[10:43] exactly it's something that God gave
[10:46] eternally he spoke it and when God spoke
[10:49] that word blessed that mean that God
[10:52] can't think it back right so I begin to
[10:54] realize here I took in Genesis
[10:57] one right verse
[11:01] 28 first God spoke God created
[11:04] everything he created he it it says here
[11:07] you know it begin to talk in Genesis 1
[11:10] and then the Bible said Genesis 1 and
[11:13] ver when God in the beginning God
[11:14] created heaven and earth and then you
[11:16] know did God and then it said and the
[11:18] Earth was without form da was up the
[11:21] faith of the and the spirit of the Lord
[11:23] God move uh moved up on the face of the
[11:25] one and God said let there be light and
[11:27] then you know God divided God if you
[11:30] notice God begin to say he saw that the
[11:33] day was good he saw it but you know he
[11:35] never said anything about blessing till
[11:38] he got to man right H if you notice here
[11:42] he never talked about blessing until he
[11:44] got to man so Genesis 1 and verse 28 and
[11:49] the Bible say and God blessed them H
[11:54] that that that's something that the
[11:56] devil can't take away and God blessed
[12:00] and and God said unto them be fruitful
[12:02] and multiply and replenish the Earth and
[12:05] S do it and have dominion over the fish
[12:08] of the sea and over the fowls of the
[12:10] earth and over every living thing that
[12:13] mooved upon the upon the face upon the
[12:16] upon the Earth so we begin to realize
[12:19] here that God blessed them and God told
[12:22] them I want you to be fruitful and I
[12:24] want you to be and I want you to
[12:26] multiply and I want you to replenish
[12:29] Earth before Adam got to that right amen
[12:32] right he broke the word of God right he
[12:35] didn't lose his sunship that's right he
[12:37] lost his Dominion right right Hallelujah
[12:39] and way he should have had Dominion ship
[12:42] over over over the Earth he should have
[12:44] dominion ship over everything to move
[12:47] and God blessed him and told him I want
[12:49] you to be fruitful and multiply but
[12:51] before before had before Adam exercise
[12:55] those pleasant he cut himself off
[12:57] through unbelief right amen
[12:59] so we begin to realize here we realize
[13:01] here so what they do God had to keep
[13:04] that word he had to keep that word
[13:06] moving he had to keep that word HH
[13:09] inspiration on the word blessing so we
[13:11] realize here what did God do he raised
[13:13] up a not a son that he can
[13:16] bless Abraham God said to Abraham
[13:19] Abraham what I have blessed thee
[13:22] whatever you do Abraham I Will Bless
[13:25] thee H Abraham he put it on Abraham
[13:28] right because was eternal blessing H was
[13:31] something that God said I would bless
[13:33] Abraham I would multiply your seed I
[13:36] would bless you AB huah he begin to tell
[13:38] Abraham I am unconditionally H I am
[13:42] overtaking you Abraham I am going to
[13:44] bless
[13:45] you and you know the St was Abraham was
[13:49] looking for
[13:50] God God was looking for
[13:52] him God called him when he was not even
[13:54] looking for God he was done the child
[13:57] doing his own thing but God had a
[13:59] blessing for him and God called him out
[14:02] and say Abraham I'm going to bless you
[14:05] how you been overtaken by blessing
[14:07] amen now I'm going to just stop for a
[14:11] moment and I'm going to think about
[14:13] blessings because when you talk to the
[14:15] world or you talk to peoples about
[14:18] blessings and you begin to listen at the
[14:21] radio preacher tevision evangelist when
[14:24] they speak on blessing it's always
[14:27] materal blessing right right you notice
[14:29] that they always go to the subject we
[14:31] believe that God going to bless you
[14:34] Hallelujah you you gave such a such
[14:36] amount of money to the church and God
[14:38] going to bless you with a new home God
[14:40] going to bless you with a new car and
[14:42] they always get the people mind always
[14:44] work up on material thing but I want to
[14:47] tell you what people God material thing
[14:50] will pass away but the Eternal thing
[14:53] that's what God want to bless us with h
[14:56] because you find here if you get up CAU
[14:58] you you and if God bless you with a new
[15:00] car sooner or later it going to wor out
[15:02] you going
[15:04] tell so it ain't nothing that God got
[15:07] Eternal blessing I take let me uh just
[15:10] read a quote from the adoption book page
[15:12] 15 he said bless bless it bless us with
[15:16] what Divine Healing for knowledge
[15:18] Revelation wisdom power tong
[15:21] interpretation the tong wisdom knowledge
[15:23] and all and all the Heavenly blessings
[15:26] and joy unspe able and full of Glory
[15:31] every heart filled with the spirit
[15:33] walking together s together in Heavenly
[15:36] places not one evil thought
[15:40] amen we get to that point you know we
[15:43] been
[15:44] blessed we get there you know have you
[15:47] know we had to deal with he a not a
[15:50] mother not one cigarette not one short
[15:53] dress not one this that or the other not
[15:55] one evil thought nobody uh nobody uh got
[15:59] anything against one
[16:02] another everybody speaking in love and
[16:05] harmony everybody with one Accord and
[16:08] one to play then suddenly that came a
[16:10] sound from Heaven Like A rushan Mighty
[16:12] Wind there you are he blessed us with
[16:15] all spiritual blessing so he if you
[16:19] notice here he L he going and teaching
[16:22] us we should see the spiritual
[16:25] place so begin to gohe look at the
[16:28] blessings so we begin to go here I begin
[16:30] to realize here we think I'm blessing so
[16:33] we we begin to realize the world it it
[16:35] least so everything is in the blessing
[16:38] real is always going to the mature real
[16:40] it's always I'm going to be blessed God
[16:42] going to do here H but what about
[16:45] Revelation if God blessing you by
[16:48] Revelation if God blessing you with
[16:50] Revelation he giving you power over
[16:53] every work of the
[16:55] devil he bless Peter take Peter and the
[16:58] against the hell shall
[17:00] not Hallelujah they shall not be able
[17:03] they might come against you Peter H they
[17:06] might fight you here and they might
[17:08] throw this at you and they might try
[17:10] this but they shall not be able to
[17:12] change your mind and make you turn
[17:15] against
[17:17] God here Eternal blessing so we begin to
[17:20] go here so I begin to look on these
[17:22] things here as as we begin to think this
[17:24] but people take then if they're not
[17:27] blessed with mat a mature then they take
[17:29] blessings sometime for Sensations yeah
[17:33] right I feel good how you know oh I went
[17:37] to church the other night and they they
[17:39] shout the church down Hallelujah and the
[17:41] preacher didn't get to preach yeah what
[17:43] happened you got caught up in emotions
[17:46] right how there's no higher calling than
[17:48] the preaching of the word of God how so
[17:50] if you go to church and you get worked
[17:52] up in emotion and sensation that's good
[17:55] I I believe that the Holy Spirit got
[17:57] those thing but what we Eternal
[17:59] destination on how God in other words
[18:02] you might not even feel like you saved
[18:04] you got to know you saved because the
[18:06] scripture Revelation tell you I'm a Son
[18:09] of
[18:11] God God bless you so begin to go
[18:15] here I begin to look at these things
[18:17] here I begin to realize here so we begin
[18:20] to realize here we must we God have
[18:23] called us to be a blessed peoples and
[18:26] we're to be overtaken by revelation of
[18:27] blessings amen and we begin to if we
[18:30] will study the Scripture it caus A
[18:33] peculiar people yeah pecul I looked at
[18:36] up in the Lexicon that mean God treager
[18:41] peoples Hallelujah God treed people
[18:44] meaning royal priesthood of chosen
[18:48] people of people that God say I'm going
[18:51] to bless you and I'm going to choose you
[18:53] and the devil ain't going to be able to
[18:55] do nothing about it because I decided
[18:57] and my for knowledge I'm going to bless
[19:00] you how so we begin to hear we are God
[19:03] chosen people but we realize here now we
[19:05] find out here God try to bless people
[19:08] why God can't bless people because
[19:10] people won't let him because people Fe
[19:12] that's right how they Fe if I believe
[19:15] God if this happen I don't believe I
[19:18] know if I hold on to this I don't
[19:20] believe it going to happen they always F
[19:24] right when Adam left the blessings of
[19:27] God when Adam moved from the presence of
[19:30] God the first word he spoke after he
[19:33] left the presence of God I hear thy
[19:36] voice and I was afraid right F had come
[19:40] in and and F had come in out of his own
[19:44] mouth he was bringing a cur on his own
[19:47] self how because God did not teach him
[19:51] through how God did not teach him how to
[19:53] PR and never since then man in his own
[19:57] mouth he a bless itself or
[20:00] curs so we begin to realize here we find
[20:03] out what James said out of out of the
[20:06] same mouth proceeding blessings and out
[20:08] of the same mouth preceded cursing H
[20:11] it's hard whatever you put in your mouth
[20:14] but we need to put the word of God in
[20:16] our mouth and possess the Gate of our
[20:21] enemy going let just look at so now we
[20:24] think about blessings am I'm going to
[20:27] I'm going to begin to look at it like
[20:28] this
[20:29] so when we think about blessing how you
[20:32] know that God blessing you you know some
[20:35] people say well the other day I was
[20:38] going down the road and I feel chill
[20:40] bumps yeah
[20:42] yeah man come on yeah that's all you got
[20:45] to base your Eternal destination on you
[20:47] feel chill but you going to be tossed to
[20:49] and fro because you living by emotion
[20:52] and feelings that's right Hallelujah so
[20:54] you living by something that God and way
[20:56] you living by you living by something
[20:58] that only yourself that you can feel
[21:00] yourself and you try to bless yourself
[21:02] because I feel good how but the point it
[21:05] is God that's good and and and I hope
[21:08] you feel good but the point of it is I
[21:10] want you to look at the spiritual things
[21:12] of God how we go the spirit of lay seal
[21:15] is an age that people will go off F
[21:18] instead of the
[21:20] word lay our seal is an age that taught
[21:24] us this is the end that people would
[21:27] Revelation 3:17 he said because thou
[21:30] said I am rich right and increase with
[21:33] good and have need of nothing H if you
[21:37] don't need nothing you ain't got no
[21:39] youed to pray for more God right H if
[21:41] you don't have a need for nothing you
[21:43] don't in other words you know way I I
[21:45] got everything I need I have a need for
[21:48] nothing and and and and knowth it not
[21:51] that thou are wretched and and and
[21:53] miserable and blind and and miserable
[21:56] and poor and blind and naked and don't
[22:00] even know it what it is what it is about
[22:02] le le is a ag a material thing and
[22:06] people say I'm blessed just living in
[22:09] Lay alone you bless with materialism
[22:11] right I mean everybody got material
[22:13] stuff now Hallelujah people can't say we
[22:16] can look at the people that sit here and
[22:18] nobody don't look like they on
[22:20] salvation this is here you might not
[22:23] have money but you got a credit card how
[22:26] you can get what you want how there a
[22:28] material blessing lay me people right
[22:32] how but the point of it lay that people
[22:35] depends on
[22:37] FS you know why because lay is the age
[22:41] that you blind right and a blind man
[22:44] don't live he had to feel his way
[22:46] through right he got to depend on his
[22:48] feelings to get around how and that
[22:51] blind is his a it got the people Le to
[22:54] feel it stand of the word of God how did
[22:57] they don't go to church because I don't

[26:23] key to my car now people don't normally
[26:25] give the key to the car right you ask
[26:27] somebody for the car

[26:30] you give a man to key to your car here
[26:32] go my power to get you to from here to
[26:35] there now the church is 20 M if somebody
[26:37] give you the key to their car I don't
[26:39] expect you to walk 20 miles yeah right
[26:42] come on now tonight we know that nobody
[26:44] ain't walk 20 miles to church tonight
[26:47] reason I know that because people at
[26:50] church
[26:53] right I guarantee you people had to walk
[26:56] 20 M to church the church will be
[26:58] tonight but I want to tell you what but
[27:00] if you got the key you get inside your
[27:02] car and you drive the church and and you
[27:06] got the key and when Jesus gave you the
[27:08] key he gave you every
[27:12] blessing I don't understand why people
[27:14] want God to come and he yeah I don't
[27:17] understand why people want God to
[27:18] deliver right but God gave you the key
[27:21] to his house everything you have need of
[27:23] is on the inside all you need to do is
[27:26] open the door and go the inside how did
[27:29] it get if you need healing open the door
[27:32] to Healing go in the inside and get
[27:34] healed if you need Deliverance go in
[27:36] inside and get delivered you got the key
[27:39] to do it all he need is your faith to do
[27:44] it so to go here and look so we begin to
[27:48] think he sent
[27:50] Jesus people under understand Jesus
[27:53] didn't come to make your life miserable
[27:55] right he came to bless you GL amen so
[27:59] you read in the scripture like Acts 3
[28:01] verse 2 says unto you first God have
[28:05] been raised of his son Jesus send him to
[28:09] bless you
[28:13] and and bless you in turning yeah away
[28:17] every one of you from his iniquities
[28:20] right Jesus came y to bless you to turn
[28:25] you from your iniquity right things that
[28:28] we do that we ought not do but Jesus
[28:31] came right to turn us away right H
[28:35] that's the blessing God gave now we
[28:37] begin to look here we begin to look at
[28:39] as I begin to go here and look at these
[28:41] things because I begin to realize here
[28:43] God came to bless us and to turn us away
[28:46] from all our iniquity because I want to
[28:49] tell you what it ain't nobody in here
[28:51] that ain't got something that undone or
[28:53] something that un said or something that
[28:55] they cannot stand before God when say
[28:58] Lord I'm perfect without the blood of
[29:00] Jesus Christ right
[29:03] exactly let look at like
[29:06] Paul's begin to describe the blessings
[29:08] of God and Paul Tau it in Romans 4 verse
[29:14] 6 he says and he took him here Paul
[29:18] understood what God blessing was Paul
[29:22] understood what God's grace was right
[29:25] why you think Paul could take this
[29:27] scripture and he going write about the
[29:29] blessings of God is such impact such
[29:33] inspiration because Paul understood if
[29:37] God did not send his mercy and God did
[29:39] not send his Blessing he would have went
[29:41] straight to hell right Paul stood this
[29:45] so Paul the one that T he says here
[29:48] Romans 4:6 he say even as David
[29:52] describe the blessing of the man whom
[29:56] the Lord imp righteousness right without
[29:58] works amen you said what did I do to get
[30:01] there absolutely nothing that's right
[30:03] because you was good enough you couldn't
[30:05] have got there the rich man came to
[30:07] Jesus he tried to he tried to approach
[30:09] God upon his own Mar upon his own
[30:12] righteousness and he was not good enough
[30:14] H he said Lord I deserve to do this from
[30:17] my youth Jesus said all right he said if
[30:19] you want to serve me then and you said
[30:21] you don't kept my commandment he I tell
[30:23] you you like one thing and you like
[30:26] because you got another God that you
[30:27] love more than you do me he they said
[30:30] all you got to give to the PO we you see
[30:33] right there that rich man hard would
[30:35] sold out to God he could not overcome
[30:37] the material things of this
[30:39] world he says and we realize it's done
[30:43] worse he said blessed is the man of God
[30:46] whom the Lord right with our work then
[30:49] Paul said blessed are they who
[30:52] iniquities are forgiven right who sins
[30:55] are covered amen hallelujah blessed is
[30:58] the man to whom the Lord will not impute
[31:01] sin to so Paul begin to realize here how
[31:05] do even though I deserve to go straight
[31:07] to hell but I can look through the grace
[31:10] of almighty God say blessed is the man
[31:13] that God would not
[31:16] imp cuz if God would imputed Paul's sin
[31:20] Paul had blashe right
[31:22] amen go back and read the scripture Paul
[31:26] said I have blasphemed through ignorance
[31:28] right in other words Paul should have
[31:31] been scrapped off he should not have
[31:33] been able to be saved for what he done
[31:35] but the point of it is the scripture say
[31:38] blessed is the man whom the LA had
[31:41] impute sin to blessed is the man who Ned
[31:44] H are forgien and who sins are covered
[31:48] it was not Paul doing it it was the
[31:50] mercy and the blessing of almighty
[31:54] God do you realize when Paul killed
[31:57] Stevens and he he brought he didn't
[31:59] leave no way back because the scripture
[32:02] say touch not my anointing do my Prophet
[32:04] no harm it better for a millstone to be
[32:06] TI right your neck you throw it to the
[32:08] depths of sea and Dr and then touch one
[32:11] of my anointing Paul killed a man full
[32:13] of the Holy Ghost how do he he left no
[32:16] way back but I want to tell you why he
[32:18] got back because God had blood there God
[32:21] had mercy there and God had a blessing
[32:23] and Paul was not looking for God but God
[32:26] came looking for powerul
[32:29] Hallelujah he was overtaken by God
[32:32] blessing and I'm tell you what we needed
[32:34] to do Hall some don't realize here how
[32:37] much more we need I need God if I want
[32:39] God to do something for me tonight I
[32:41] want God to overtake Me by revelation of
[32:43] blood let me understand it how it was
[32:46] not for God blessing it was not for God
[32:48] imp was not impute sin to me if it was
[32:51] not God if God would not a charge
[32:53] iniquity to me I I would have went scrap
[32:55] to hell but God Rich him Mercy
[32:59] hallelujah thank you Lord so Paul he was
[33:02] there how he kill
[33:04] Stevenson and then would with d
[33:07] Stevenson looked up y because Jesus
[33:10] empowered him a few days before that
[33:13] amen said we s you remit they remit
[33:16] whoever s you retain they'll retain how
[33:19] whoever you forgive St they'll forgive
[33:21] it how Ste had power how do God Empower
[33:24] him with power to speak the word and
[33:26] bless somebody H and then Stevenson was
[33:29] die Stevens looked looked up on and
[33:32] looked to Christ stand at the right hand
[33:34] in the authority of God and he cried out
[33:36] he said Lord laid out this
[33:39] charge what did he do he dropped the
[33:42] charges how was poly s before God right
[33:48] I thank God that what the grace did for
[33:50] all of us hallelu with Jesus said father
[33:52] hallelujah hallelujah father L not the
[33:55] Char he dropped the charg of that c
[33:57] right H and we can go free but we got to
[34:00] take Faith and accept what God does
[34:03] that's right we take Fai you say well
[34:06] I'm looking for the blood God you are
[34:08] not saved by the blood You Are shved by
[34:10] the
[34:11] faith the blood is what keep you say but
[34:15] keep you clean day by day how God wash
[34:18] you day by day that's why we don't got
[34:20] no sins against
[34:24] us

[34:32] so just out here but there but see the
[34:35] the day it is the spirit will lay us

[34:40] worshiping God it's all self right self
[34:44] L everybody feel like look what I

[34:52] become lovers of self more than lovers
[34:55] of God hallah you know it's all about me
[34:59] it's all about myself how in other words
[35:01] that the world is all caught up in
[35:04] themselves how everywhere you go it this
[35:07] matter about me but the point of it is I
[35:09] say you know what it is God is not let
[35:12] us live our life for ourselves we come
[35:14] to church to live our life for somebody
[35:17] else that somebody can see Christ
[35:19] shining in You You Lord H he want you

[35:25] yourself you don't give light to the
[35:27] World Behind Your Life hiding Christ
[35:30] under a bush you let it shine so
[35:33] somebody that's in darkness they can

[37:51] begin to go God trying to get us but TR
[37:55] to restore us right and this revelation
[37:58] of blessing yes how God going to bless
[38:01] you how God going to bless people
[38:04] today how we get Revelation to be
[38:07] blessed the Bible says
[38:10] here it says Romans 10 verse say what
[38:15] what said it the word is not right to
[38:19] thee even in thy
[38:21] mouth and in thy heart that is the word
[38:25] of faith which we pring that's right if
[38:28] th if thou shall confess with thy
[38:33] mouth the Lord and thou shall and and
[38:38] the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thy
[38:41] heart that God has raised him from the
[38:43] dead thou shall be saved and if you read
[38:46] the rest of the Scripture it that how
[38:49] can you how can you believe when I'm a
[38:51] preacher right that's right that's right
[38:54] they come to
[38:56] hear they
[38:58] Faith with God when you come to church
[39:00] and hear the word of God you are
[39:03] blessed because God is spiritually
[39:05] maturing you into a spiritual growth
[39:07] that when things come your way you got
[39:09] some word in your mind in your heart you
[39:11] can go back to say Dev I heard it preach
[39:14] you get behind me say that the word of
[39:16] God said this and I am blessed because I
[39:19] know my place in the
[39:22] word take this little step further so
[39:25] now we begin to go so we think about God
[39:27] blessings how good God been to we saved
[39:30] how God keep us saved by the washing of
[39:33] the word of God how and we hear the word
[39:35] God is keep blessing us over and over
[39:38] again H so if I begin to look here now I
[39:41] want you to understand when God bless
[39:45] you when God blessed Abraham right he
[39:48] told Abraham say Abraham look up to the
[39:52] Stars he's en
[39:54] C look at the S and you
[39:58] I can't do
[39:59] it do you realize here everywhere you
[40:03] go everything that come in contact with
[40:05] you come under the atmosphere of
[40:08] blessing H you know I work at you you
[40:11] can go work for somebody hall and then
[40:13] they could be unbelieving if you work
[40:15] there and you live a holy and Sanctified
[40:17] life you know it's the job of Prosper
[40:20] right what you say what happened that's
[40:22] God blessing Hallelujah he said I bless
[40:25] you he told Abraham see I bless your
[40:28] seed and they shall possess get of the
[40:31] enemy don't think it's SC people that
[40:34] about coming H that overtake you you
[40:36] don't you don't try to make that happen
[40:38] God automatically do it h because God
[40:40] promised he will bless Abraham SE Hall
[40:43] don't what we don't have to worry about
[40:44] this economy is falling I don't care
[40:46] what happened here I realize here that
[40:49] my Bible said that Abraham see the
[40:51] righteous won't be forsaken all he see
[40:53] to be Bing bread that's what the word of
[40:56] God say
[41:02] Hallelujah but see we we get this we
[41:05] create this spir that God won't stand
[41:08] behind his word things is going on
[41:11] everything is happening in the world
[41:13] people thinking what I'm going to do

[42:23] on oh like God was going to bless him
[42:26] yeah see what happened F God in their
[42:29] minds and they begin to think that God
[42:31] ain't going to keep his word how they
[42:33] because to say because God will put them
[42:35] through a test they thought God was
[42:36] going to keep his word but I will let
[42:38] you know what God Said God can never
[42:40] change his mind what he said about you H

[52:42] covenant child but the man still blessed
[52:45] right he might have got the natural
[52:47] thing but God blessed him right but it
[52:50] being of the sea Hallelujah the Royal
[52:53] seed it was not the natural thing that
[52:55] was looking for it was Supernatural
[52:57] things right amen I'm going to tell you
[52:59] here now you said was Abraham
[53:03] perfect if he was perfect Christ don't
[53:05] need to come right right she what was
[53:09] saying if he was so holy Christ didn't
[53:11] need to come right did Abraham have
[53:13] problem some he had problem when the man

[55:13] nothing wrong why because the blessing
[55:15] was on Abraham not the
[55:20] king so we begin to go here let's look
[55:22] at this blessing so now Abraham had
[55:26] problem like everybody him and lot was
[55:28] going to the same church
[55:31] yeah had they both went to the same
[55:34] church yeah and all of a sudden lot
[55:36] Herman started with Abraham
[55:39] Herman yeah who and other everybody got
[55:41] into some doctor issues
[55:44] yeah trying to prove the two Lords to
[55:49] Abraham fighting against doct yeah and
[55:52] ABR so Abraham said don't let it be
[55:55] scrib between them us yeah MH let us
[55:58] break this Spirit of division right y y
[56:01] he said let us the best of to separate y
[56:03] m so he said lot he said where you want
[56:05] to go lot look down to a
[56:09] solar that's what a big buck say yeah
[56:12] yeah I'm going that way you can stay out
[56:15] you in the country you want
[56:17] to I'm going down here where they making
[56:19] the money at have to go down here and
[56:21] live bu those solemn nights and all that
[56:23] perverted Spirit down now he chose to go
[56:26] down now lot get down there and the man
[56:28] become
[56:29] prosperous he became the mder of the
[56:32] city the man making plenty money
[56:34] everything going good for lot all of a
[56:37] sudden he get weaker in his face every
[56:39] day right can finally the devil kept
[56:42] shift in him and shift in him till the
[56:45] man didn't even have no faith right so
[56:47] now lot could not come
[56:49] out right because he didn't have enough
[56:52] Faith to come out right the man loveed
[56:55] it down there s right but the point of
[56:58] it
[56:58] was he had an uncle that loved him right
[57:03] he had an uncle that stayed on his knees
[57:06] Lord Open the Eyes of lot hard how he
[57:09] had a h that say I'm not going to let go
[57:11] of my nephew I love my nephew he like
[57:14] people today right we see we see him
[57:17] doing something wrong first we say
[57:18] forget him but Abraham said no I'm not
[57:21] forgetting
[57:22] lot he's my nephew I'm holding on to him
[57:25] and I'm going to BL God I don't know how
[57:27] he going to bring them out I don't know
[57:29] how he going to save them I don't know
[57:31] the condition I see the condition they
[57:32] because we look at the condition of the
[57:34] flood not the condition of promises when
[57:37] you look at flesh we get blood because
[57:39] we see our young people we see our
[57:40] children doing things that we be say why
[57:43] my kids doing
[57:44] this oh my God they going to go to hell
[57:47] they going to do this they going to get
[57:48] killed they going go but you looking at
[57:50] the
[57:51] natural you got to look Bey up because
[57:53] flesh is there nothing good in flesh
[57:55] nowhere and when you reach out for
[57:56] somebody else you not looking at their
[57:58] faith because they ain't got no faith
[58:01] but the B say if you got faith for
[58:02] yourself you take that same thing right
[58:07] Abraham un believe a
[58:09] lot now you say how did a lot come
[58:12] out did he come out on his own marriage
[58:15] or did he come out on Abraham Faith
[58:16] right the Bible says James 5:16 the
[58:20] effect fir of a righteous man availing
[58:23] much right so Abraham had a his thing
[58:27] because he believe God so now it's time
[58:30] for lot to come out yeah now lot is in
[58:33] the back condition by the way right when
[58:36] I'm talking about bid yeah the man is so
[58:40] B these angels come down there these
[58:43] perverted solom knits seeing these
[58:45] angels go in this house they kicking the
[58:47] door in and lot got two two virgin
[58:51] daughters really and lock goes to the
[58:53] door say don't take these angels take my
[58:56] two
[58:58] daughters you know what I would I would
[59:00] have went to the door with
[59:03] something oh yeah would had something
[59:06] they would have take something they take
[59:07] my other six there you know but here it
[59:10] is yeah but the he was backslid so he
[59:14] was so weak in his F he gave his clean
[59:17] ver his daughter over to these perverts
[59:19] the T right all that he done backlit
[59:24] completely his Fai was complet wi right
[59:27] but God said Abraham seed right will
[59:30] possess the Gate of his enemy so now let
[59:33] us go to the scripture see how lot come
[59:35] out yeah Genesis 19th Chapter
[59:42] Genesis you say sometime I pray for my
[59:45] children I don't see nothing happen keep
[59:47] praying on H you Ain the go if you can
[59:50] see something happen you don't need
[59:51] faith for Hallelujah faith is something
[59:53] that you don't see they they not see but
[59:56] you believe by the power of God some way
[59:59] somehow God going to
[1:00:02] Prevail so uh Genesis 19 chapter gen and
[1:00:07] verse 29 and it says it and it came to
[1:00:11] pass when God destroyed the the cities
[1:00:15] of the plains that God done
[1:00:19] what done
[1:00:21] what remembered Abraham how God was not
[1:00:25] looking at
[1:00:26] he was looking at Abraham it was Abraham
[1:00:29] he gave the promise hey Abraham whatever
[1:00:31] you pray for whoever you call me for he
[1:00:35] remembered Abraham and he remembered
[1:00:38] Abraham and he sh lot out of the midst
[1:00:41] of the overthrowing when he overthrow
[1:00:44] the city in which lot dwelt it was not
[1:00:47] lot coming out on his own it was Abraham
[1:00:50] kept laying there before God calling out
[1:00:52] for L Lord save my nephew don't let it P
[1:00:55] with the we yet
[1:00:57] right you got to take that same favor
[1:00:59] hold over your
[1:01:01] children I I can't promise you they
[1:01:03] going to be in the Rapture but I can't
[1:01:04] promise you hold that fa don't waver
[1:01:06] they'll make it out right hallelu God
[1:01:09] promised that Hallelujah he promised us
[1:01:11] if you ask anything we put a limitation
[1:01:14] on it he anything without a limitation
[1:01:17] because you got the right of the a come
[1:01:21] the
[1:01:22] blessen now what would have happen and
[1:01:25] lot would refus the blessing MH he would
[1:01:27] refuse to come out right why did abah
[1:01:30] keep calling on the lot right what did
[1:01:33] lot have to do when he was D that
[1:01:34] backlit why didn't God let him go to
[1:01:36] hell cuz if God would have let lock with
[1:01:39] to hell he would had to denal his own
[1:01:42] race right on because remember Ruth come
[1:01:45] through lot then Boaz then Jessie Then
[1:01:49] David right right right just came
[1:01:51] through that lineage so AB hold up so
[1:01:53] that why when God give you Faith to hold
