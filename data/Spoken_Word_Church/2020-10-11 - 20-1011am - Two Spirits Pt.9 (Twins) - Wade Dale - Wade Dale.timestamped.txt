[28:29] not fun getting old and it would be nice
[28:31] to reverse the process but you know what
[28:33] by the preaching of the word we're going
[28:34] to reverse that process amen that
[28:36] process to me
[28:37] is being done word by word by word by
[28:40] word
[28:41] all right like brother luis was talking
[28:43] wednesday night about the the potter
[28:45] uh you got to put the water to it you
[28:48] got to water you
[28:49] you can't just take a dry old dry piece
[28:51] of uh
[28:52] flesh and do anything with it it's got
[28:54] to be watered it's got to have the water
[28:55] of the word so
[28:57] god bless you if you would turn your
[28:58] bibles to first john 4.
[29:02] and like i said brother bob will be here
[29:03] with us wednesday night he'll
[29:05] see this or we can i'll text him a
[29:07] little bit later but like i
[29:09] said again thank you all for your
[29:10] prayers and for all your
[29:12] comments and literally
[29:15] around the world people were praying for
[29:17] for brother dale it's good to have a
[29:18] church body
[29:20] that's not just confined to these walls
[29:22] amen
[29:23] and you know we used satan's technology
[29:26] he gave us all the internet and all the
[29:28] wi-fi and all the different things but
[29:29] we're just going to use it to our
[29:30] advantage
[29:32] we're going to get the bride to pray
[29:33] just real quick
[29:35] for for others and you don't have to
[29:36] wait two or three weeks to find out some
[29:38] of you get instant messaging so
[29:40] and that's the way god is god gives us
[29:43] revelation that's what we want more than
[29:46] anything is revelation so just keep us
[29:48] in your prayers keep us in prayers that
[29:49] we'll all be
[29:50] we're we're doing our hand washing and i
[29:52] was talking to sister cleta
[29:53] a few minutes ago and i read an article
[29:55] not too long ago where
[29:56] now they're saying that we may be too
[29:58] clean that you know when we were kids i
[30:01] know
[30:01] we'd get outside and play and for those
[30:03] of you young kids that don't know what a
[30:05] tater patch is
[30:10] nyla's going down what are you talking
[30:12] about a tater patch is when you go
[30:14] outside and play for so long in the dirt
[30:17] and you sweat and you come in you got a
[30:19] little roll right here
[30:23] and it's brown and you could plant
[30:26] taters in it
[30:28] because it's dirt and mama would make
[30:31] sure that we would go wash that tater
[30:33] patch off
[30:35] before we did anything but you know
[30:36] they're saying now that we're
[30:38] so hand sanitized and so sanitized and
[30:40] so sanitized
[30:41] i think another day and just just a
[30:43] thought in your mind think how many
[30:44] things that are already your body's
[30:46] already combating i know sister ruth
[30:48] knows it and a lot of people that have
[30:49] been in the health care field
[30:51] your body even at night there's things
[30:53] working there's there's there's
[30:55] antibodies and there's
[30:56] all these different things that's
[30:58] fighting things off of you because we
[30:59] live in what we're talking about we live
[31:01] in this
[31:02] satan's eden that he would surely love
[31:04] to kill every one of us
[31:06] and everything he touches dies anyway so
[31:10] we are expecting
[31:13] though brother dale to come to complete
[31:15] recovery and be back in the pulpit we
[31:17] miss him and you know that
[31:18] too but there is a healing process
[31:20] that's got to happen
[31:21] so he's told me last night he said just
[31:24] keep everything the way it is for a
[31:26] while
[31:26] so we're just going to keep everything
[31:28] the way it is for a while amen so
[31:30] everybody okay god bless you i know
[31:31] there's
[31:32] several downstairs there's several out i
[31:34] think brother aaron is in
[31:35] uh tennessee with his family and anna
[31:38] and richard and the kids are there with
[31:40] dad
[31:41] uh and the reason we showed that is like
[31:42] i said so he could see it on big screen
[31:45] i know some of you have some of you
[31:46] hadn't but thank you for what you've
[31:47] done brother
[31:48] luis and sister christine for putting
[31:50] that together and all the work that
[31:51] everybody does around here we're just
[31:53] one big church family so
[31:54] first john 4 verse 1 let's bow our heads
[31:57] heavenly father thank you again today
[32:00] for a time that we can come and serve
[32:02] you father
[32:03] in a building to honor the resurrection
[32:07] that two thousand years ago lord you
[32:09] stepped out of that
[32:11] tomb and you said all power in heaven
[32:12] there's been given unto me
[32:15] but lord thank you that you didn't keep
[32:16] it lord you said
[32:18] that i'll go away but i'll come back
[32:22] and i'll not just be with you i'll be in
[32:24] you to the end of the age
[32:26] father we're coming up to the end of
[32:27] this age and lord we know that you have
[32:29] not left us
[32:31] there are things that look like maybe
[32:32] that that that we
[32:34] question a lot in our humanity that are
[32:36] going on but lord
[32:38] as we've said many times before the
[32:40] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[32:42] of the lord
[32:43] so you have complete control lord of
[32:46] everything that goes on
[32:47] father we still cry out lord for healing
[32:50] for
[32:51] ones that are not here by the kali all
[32:52] the different ones that are in the
[32:53] sanctuary lord
[32:55] pastor lord and different ones mom we
[32:58] pray that you touch them father and just
[33:00] keep on that healing process lord
[33:02] and we pray that you would be with the
[33:06] be with the bride around the world as we
[33:08] see many many prayer requests coming in
[33:10] that this
[33:11] virus is hitting a lot of people in
[33:12] different places
[33:14] lord we pray for mercy lord and we pray
[33:17] that you'll cover us by your blood
[33:18] father
[33:19] be with the people here lord give them
[33:21] strength let us bind together closer to
[33:23] you lord
[33:25] and take care of us in the furthermore
[33:26] this service we ask in jesus name
[33:29] amen first john 4 verse 1 says beloved
[33:32] believe not every spirit
[33:34] but try the spirits whether they are of
[33:36] god because many false prophets are gone
[33:38] out into the world
[33:39] hereby know you the spirit of god and
[33:41] every spirit that confesses that jesus
[33:43] christ has come in the flesh is of god
[33:45] and every spirit that confesses not that
[33:48] jesus christ has come in the flesh is
[33:49] not of god
[33:50] and this is that spirit of antichrist
[33:52] whereof you have heard that it should
[33:54] come
[33:55] and even now already is in the world
[33:57] like i said that's
[33:58] 2 000 years ago year of god little
[34:01] children
[34:01] have overcome them because greater is
[34:03] healeth in you than he that's in the
[34:04] world
[34:05] they are of the world therefore speak
[34:07] they of the world and the world heareth
[34:08] them
[34:09] we are of god he that knoweth god
[34:11] heareth us he that is not of god heareth
[34:13] not us hereby know we the spirit of
[34:15] truth
[34:16] and the spirit of error that's the two
[34:18] spirits
[34:19] or two seeds we've been talking about
[34:21] and we're gonna
[34:22] try to get to where we talk about twins
[34:24] so you may be seeing the lord's blessing
[34:26] to the reading of the word
[34:27] let's go to the first quote and read it
[34:29] again
[34:31] brother claude and i were talking
[34:32] yesterday or day before yesterday
[34:34] and he's kind of on the same subject but
[34:36] he's covered under demonology
[34:38] we know there's only one demon and
[34:40] there's only one god
[34:42] all right there are many demons under
[34:44] that demon and there are many helpers
[34:46] under
[34:47] the lord jesus christ we know there's
[34:49] angels there's all the diff but you know
[34:51] where his helpers are today
[34:52] right here this is his family this is
[34:54] what's going to destroy the effects of
[34:56] the devil
[34:57] is you and me in human flesh today
[35:01] by just getting up and coming to church
[35:03] you have defeated the devil
[35:05] amen by just getting up and saying i
[35:07] really don't feel
[35:08] i'm going on i really i'm going on see
[35:11] you've done right there you you have
[35:13] done what you've separated those two
[35:15] spirits
[35:16] and you know that you have the spirit of
[35:18] truth by coming to church
[35:19] or the spirit of error by putting
[35:21] something else in the way of that
[35:23] all right and it has to be a demon
[35:24] because god's not going to tell you not
[35:26] to come to church
[35:27] all right so now remember this christ in
[35:30] the true church is a continuation of the
[35:31] book of acts
[35:32] but the book of revelation shows how
[35:34] that the antichrist spirit would come
[35:36] into the church and defile it
[35:37] look what it's doing now it's coming
[35:38] into the church and defile it
[35:40] making it lukewarm formal and powerless
[35:43] it exposes satan revealing his works
[35:46] the attempted destruction of god's
[35:47] people and the discrediting of god's
[35:50] word think about all that the
[35:51] discrediting of god's word look what's
[35:52] happening now even in the message of the
[35:54] hour they're discrediting the word of
[35:56] god
[35:56] all right they're not saying that it's
[35:58] god it's nothing they're not saying it's
[35:59] false they're just discrediting it
[36:01] saying well it may be for something else
[36:03] somebody else is coming or we got
[36:04] another message and
[36:06] anyway that's antichrist spirit all
[36:09] right
[36:10] now look it's not the antichrist it's
[36:11] the antichrist spirit because we know
[36:13] it's going to head up when we get
[36:14] finished
[36:15] down the line we know that that heads up
[36:17] in one person
[36:19] amen well i read it over there in
[36:21] revelations uh yesterday 17 18 19 read
[36:24] over in there you see this
[36:26] beast that comes up upon the earth and
[36:28] this beast
[36:29] is going to give power and we'll cover
[36:31] that long time from here
[36:32] but we need to get to these 22 to the
[36:34] twins because remember brother brown
[36:36] said there's twins
[36:37] in every revival he fights that he
[36:39] cannot stand it he knows that if the
[36:41] people
[36:42] get the true revelation of the true
[36:44] church and what she is and what she
[36:46] stands for
[36:47] all right you got to stand for something
[36:50] and that she can do the greater work she
[36:52] will be an invincible army
[36:54] if they get a true revelation of the two
[36:56] spirits within the framework of the
[36:57] christian church
[37:00] not out there right here christian
[37:03] church
[37:05] and by god's spirit discern and
[37:08] withstand the antichrist spirit satan
[37:10] will be powerless
[37:12] before her let's read the second one
[37:14] it's also an exposition of the seven
[37:16] church ages did you get it now there are
[37:18] these twins again
[37:20] there are those two trees again remember
[37:22] there was a tree of life and a tree of
[37:23] knowledge of good and evil always those
[37:25] two
[37:25] right growing side by side in the same
[37:29] earth partaking of the same nourishment
[37:31] drinking in the same rain and benefiting
[37:34] by the same
[37:35] son but they come from different seeds
[37:39] one tree is for the word of god and
[37:41] exactly as god gave it and
[37:43] loves it and obeys it the other tree is
[37:46] from the seed that is anti the word of
[37:48] god
[37:48] and changes it where it wants to it
[37:51] substitutes its own creeds and dogmas
[37:53] for the living true word of god exactly
[37:55] as did cain
[37:56] who ended up killing abel but fear not
[37:59] little flock
[38:00] stay with the word keep that word
[38:03] between
[38:04] you and the devil eve did not do that
[38:06] and she failed
[38:07] and when the church lets down on the
[38:09] word she goes into the depths of the
[38:11] darkness
[38:12] of satan what about that that's pretty
[38:13] powerful quote
[38:15] all right so we see that there's two
[38:17] opposing spirits now
[38:18] but god when he comes up we've been in
[38:21] the garden of eden for a long time and
[38:22] maybe we'll try to get out of it today
[38:25] but being we don't have but one service
[38:28] we know that god set up a plan before
[38:31] the foundation of the world he knew what
[38:33] was gonna happen he
[38:34] he by four knowledge everything was
[38:36] already he could see what was coming
[38:39] he knew what adam and eve would do he
[38:41] knew what satan was gonna do
[38:42] lucifer was gonna do when he created him
[38:45] and he
[38:46] knew that the plan that he had was
[38:48] perfect because god doesn't have to go
[38:49] back and change his plan
[38:51] so whatever this is that happened and
[38:54] that's why you and i got to get a true
[38:55] revelation of every step of all this
[38:57] that happened
[38:58] because that's where we get a true
[39:00] revelation because right here in the
[39:03] garden of eden
[39:05] man by their knowledge
[39:09] changed the bible right from the
[39:10] beginning
[39:12] the original word of god says that adam
[39:15] and eve
[39:16] in the garden of eden without sex
[39:19] there was a beast there and the beast
[39:22] the satan
[39:23] entered the beast defiled eve had
[39:26] relations with her then had relations
[39:27] with adam and then those twins were born
[39:29] now see man changed all that
[39:33] man did god never changed it man changed
[39:35] it
[39:36] man changed it and said no it was an
[39:38] apple then it was an apricot then
[39:42] we don't know what this is and we don't
[39:44] know where this is have we don't know
[39:45] what's happening
[39:46] but we do because we had a prophet to
[39:50] come and
[39:51] walk into the mind of god that the mind
[39:53] of god was there before the foundation
[39:55] of the world
[39:56] because it was part of god and we we
[39:59] as recipients of what the prophet gave
[40:02] us
[40:03] could go back into the back part of
[40:04] god's mind with the prophet of god
[40:08] he didn't go into the mind of god and
[40:10] then come out and shut the door
[40:12] he brought what he had what he saw he
[40:15] brought that mind of god
[40:17] christ the mystery god revealed all god
[40:18] was deported to christ christ into where
[40:21] you and me the church take her back to
[40:25] the garden of eden
[40:26] take her literally take her back to
[40:29] where
[40:30] man before man got a hold
[40:35] of this word and what made it powerless
[40:40] made it formal cold and powerless oh
[40:42] they just ate an apple
[40:44] and we really don't know but all of a
[40:46] sudden they had to put on clothes and
[40:47] all of a sudden you had a
[40:49] you had a set of twins born and and all
[40:52] they must have been from adam because
[40:54] uh eve said i've gotten a man from the
[40:56] lord and you understand what i'm saying
[40:57] you see how they preached all that now
[40:59] that wasn't god that did that
[41:01] that was satan that did that satan
[41:03] preached that sermon
[41:06] in the minds of people down through the
[41:08] ages
[41:09] and they just believed it same thing
[41:12] with the trinity same thing with all
[41:13] this different water baptism
[41:15] that never come from the mind of god
[41:17] that's why when brother branham went
[41:19] into the mind of god and got the
[41:20] information
[41:23] it wasn't a denominational idea
[41:26] it was what god said and that's what he
[41:30] brought it and he said this is what god
[41:31] said
[41:33] this is what was in the mind of god so
[41:34] you and i
[41:36] because listen without a revelation we
[41:38] can't go back into that mind of god
[41:40] because the mind of god is a revelation
[41:42] the mind of god is not just pieces
[41:44] you know you can read this and and
[41:46] listen when i was 14
[41:48] years old i knew what happened in the
[41:50] garden of eden by reading what brother
[41:51] brown said and just
[41:52] studying science and knowing that there
[41:54] was a missing link and
[41:55] and knowing that that being 14 years old
[41:58] you get to thinking things different
[41:59] than you did when you was five or six
[42:00] years old you understand what i'm saying
[42:02] so you really knew what satan was doing
[42:04] and where he started at he started in my
[42:07] the mind of eve or because remember
[42:10] if you keep we keep going here we got to
[42:13] remember and we'll read it in a little
[42:14] while
[42:14] there's also two wombs
[42:18] amen there's two wombs you have a womb
[42:21] in your mind
[42:22] and you have a natural physical womb all
[42:24] right
[42:25] so what did satan get to first he got to
[42:28] eve's
[42:29] mind the womb of her mind because what
[42:32] did gabriel do when he come
[42:35] and met mary he got in he got the womb
[42:39] of mary's mind to thinking
[42:41] because the first thing mary said she
[42:42] said how can this happen now that came
[42:44] from up here
[42:46] how can this happen i'm 16 years old and
[42:49] i pretty much know how everybody got
[42:51] here
[42:51] on the face of the earth what are you
[42:54] telling me
[42:57] he said it'll come from the holy ghost
[43:01] and she got a revelation
[43:04] that she was the one because she
[43:06] remembered isaiah 9 said a virgin shall
[43:09] conceive
[43:10] so that seed that spiritual seed
[43:15] was planted in her womb first up here
[43:18] before the natural seed could happen
[43:22] in mary's natural womb so that's the way
[43:25] you and i
[43:26] now remember you and i are what we
[43:30] are women in the body all of us i've
[43:31] uncovered this before we are all women
[43:33] in the body of christ
[43:35] amen so we have a womb that we have
[43:39] here and that's the womb that satan is
[43:42] after
[43:43] because once he gets this one he's got
[43:45] everything else right because the body
[43:47] just follows behind
[43:48] but listen satan was so smart he was
[43:51] standing there and he saw
[43:52] what god said look we're going to go
[43:53] right here to the law of reproduction
[43:56] because the law of reproduction it has
[43:59] two
[44:00] distinct meanings now watch
[44:04] on the law of reproduction genesis
[44:07] 1 11 says and god said let the earth
[44:09] bring forth grass
[44:10] the herb yielding fruit after his kind
[44:12] whose seed is in itself upon the earth
[44:15] the earth brought forth grass and herb
[44:17] yielding seed after its kind of the tree
[44:18] yielded fruit whose seed was in itself
[44:20] after his kind now that's natural seed
[44:23] everybody got that say
[44:24] man that's natural seed the animals were
[44:27] told to
[44:28] to repopulate the world by natural
[44:31] seed sperm and egg coming together and
[44:34] making babies everybody got that
[44:36] all right but now when we come to
[44:37] genesis 1 26
[44:39] that is not a natural seed
[44:43] that is spiritual genesis 1 26
[44:46] and god said let us make man in our
[44:48] image never in this
[44:50] genesis 1 26 i was thinking about this
[44:52] yesterday from genesis 1 26 to 1 28
[44:55] there is no natural relations involved
[45:01] because there's not even a natural man
[45:03] you're looking at
[45:04] you're looking at a spirit man remember
[45:07] brother brown said god created man
[45:09] and he created man of spirit first all
[45:11] right let us make man in our image after
[45:13] our likeness and let them have dominion
[45:15] over the fish of the sea and old foul
[45:16] that's good because you know what that's
[45:18] adam that's what adam and eve did
[45:20] they took over the world but god told
[45:23] them the same thing he told the animals
[45:26] the animal's natural the trees natural
[45:29] the grass natural there is a natural
[45:31] seed
[45:33] have you ever thought about that law of
[45:36] reproduction
[45:37] is still going today even in the natural
[45:40] that god set forth 6 000 years ago it's
[45:43] still happening every day
[45:45] we today we see the leaves falling on
[45:47] the trees
[45:48] the seeds are dying but what's happening
[45:50] the pine tree
[45:52] lets go of that seed and it goes and it
[45:54] goes into the ground
[45:55] it sits there for a little while during
[45:57] the winter time because there's no
[45:58] warmth
[46:00] to bring it out of the ground but
[46:02] because of that law of reproduction
[46:05] come about march you see a little green
[46:08] chute come up
[46:09] you don't see nothing you just see
[46:10] barren ground and implanting planting
[46:13] uh garden this year you know you plant
[46:15] that garden and you go man i don't know
[46:16] i don't know but all of a sudden what
[46:18] you planted in that row
[46:20] it starts popping its head up so there's
[46:21] the law of reproduction
[46:23] and if you've got hybrid seed it won't
[46:25] reproduce but if you got some heirloom
[46:27] seed or seed that you can re
[46:29] sow then that seed is in itself
[46:33] now let me ask you a question is that so
[46:35] different now
[46:36] when we talk about the spiritual man the
[46:39] seed that god wanted to bring forth
[46:42] from adam and eve was already in
[46:46] adam not natural
[46:50] spiritual the spoken word is the
[46:53] original seed
[46:54] adam i was talking about this a couple
[46:55] weeks ago adam was a literal spoken
[46:58] seed word of god he didn't come from
[47:01] another mom and daddy he didn't come
[47:02] from a
[47:03] a a a sperm in a or a german an egg
[47:06] coming together
[47:07] he came let there be
[47:10] right here so god created man in his own
[47:13] image and the image of god created to
[47:14] him
[47:15] male and female created he them all
[47:17] right so he's going to have a male and a
[47:18] female in this human race
[47:23] but remember their spirit right now
[47:25] spiritual
[47:26] nothing natural and god blessed them and
[47:29] god said unto them be fruitful and what
[47:32] multiply the law of reproduction
[47:36] but satan perverted that law
[47:41] and turned it back into this other law
[47:44] everybody with me not god
[47:48] satan took this right here
[47:52] because why did what did satan preach to
[47:55] eve
[47:56] god told you to multiply
[48:02] and when he put him in human flesh then
[48:03] he could just say all right eve you're
[48:05] the woman and
[48:06] i'm the man and you understand what i
[48:08] mean be fruitful and multiply
[48:10] replenish the earth and subdue it now
[48:13] remember
[48:14] we're heading toward that again
[48:17] i was reading i love that revelations 19
[48:20] when
[48:21] when god comes riding back with his
[48:23] saints
[48:24] that's not everybody that's us comes
[48:27] riding back into the millennium
[48:30] all this other thing and what we're
[48:31] going to do is brother brown
[48:33] said we would subdue the earth in the
[48:35] millennium because right now obviously
[48:37] we're not subduing much of anything
[48:41] right but now god promised us in romans
[48:44] 8 that there would be a manifestation of
[48:46] the sons of god when the earth is
[48:47] groaning
[48:48] so you'll see it in a small portion in
[48:50] the bride i believe
[48:52] real quick because we're going to need
[48:55] it if anything worse than this comes
[48:57] folks we're going to need more than just
[48:59] doctors
[49:01] hello we're going to need what spoken
[49:03] word we're going to need
[49:04] manifestation of the sons and daughters
[49:06] of god
[49:08] but god promised we would have it
[49:12] and have dominion over the fish of the
[49:13] sea and all the fowl of the air
[49:15] now listen we have dominion over the
[49:17] animal kingdom now but it's a fear
[49:19] dominion
[49:22] because we're going to get to it in just
[49:23] a minute where there was no fear until
[49:25] god walked in the garden and adam and
[49:27] eve did what they did
[49:28] first word that come out of adam's mouth
[49:31] i was afraid
[49:33] afraid afraid of what he had named all
[49:36] the animals
[49:37] he'd moved trees around probably if he
[49:39] didn't like this mountain he just slid
[49:41] it over to this side
[49:42] he had complete control like i said adam
[49:44] was not an idiot
[49:46] adam was the son of god he was the
[49:47] closest thing to god
[49:50] besides god because he and then god said
[49:53] when god look
[49:54] brother by the way brother brown said
[49:56] one time he said when god gives you
[49:57] something he don't take it back
[49:59] so he said you have dominion over the
[50:02] fish of the sea
[50:03] follow the air and over every living
[50:05] thing that moveth upon the earth
[50:07] be fruitful though and multiply well see
[50:10] so satan took that and said
[50:12] okay i know that's the plan of god
[50:16] because he's listening to it when it's
[50:17] happening right here
[50:19] he's listening to it he said okay i know
[50:21] but but i know god said before you see
[50:23] how satan is
[50:24] i hate to think like him but sometimes
[50:26] you have to think like him you know to
[50:28] see what his plan is but you know
[50:30] one thing's for sure he said all right
[50:32] he told him to do that but now
[50:33] these people right here this group
[50:36] must be special god's not letting me get
[50:40] involved in any of that satan's not
[50:43] involved in that group of people
[50:44] folks he's involved in all the world he
[50:46] is not involved in the bride of jesus
[50:48] christ he is not involved in the
[50:50] children of god
[50:52] he involves himself with the children of
[50:55] god trying to get us to mess up
[50:57] but he does have nothing to do with our
[50:59] spiritual growth
[51:02] thank god he has nothing to do with
[51:05] anything
[51:06] in your soul he can't take it away
[51:11] he can't make it not eternal when you
[51:13] get eternal life god give it to you and
[51:15] you're sure
[51:16] amen but that's what he's saying right
[51:18] here so satan is going
[51:20] i know what i'll do i'll make him mess
[51:23] up
[51:24] so that's what he did because he
[51:26] remember what god did he took
[51:28] this man and put him on the earth
[51:32] and gave him a body as as brother louise
[51:34] was talking wednesday night he
[51:36] the potter throwed the clay on the wheel
[51:38] and started turning the wheel and here
[51:39] come adam
[51:41] and then he placed that genesis 1 26 man
[51:44] inside of heaven
[51:45] of adam and gave him the dominion
[51:48] over the fish of the sea so if you'll
[51:51] remember one thing's for sure
[51:54] god never wanted us to reproduce the way
[51:57] we reproduce now
[51:58] okay so get that out of your head but he
[52:01] did allow it
[52:02] to get us here so that we can make our
[52:05] choice
[52:07] because of what happened in the fall i
[52:09] like what one preacher said one time he
[52:11] said
[52:11] he said god was getting ready to produce
[52:13] sons and daughters of god
[52:15] and satan all he done was he marred
[52:17] eve's womb
[52:18] then he marred her natural womb and god
[52:21] can't bring a son of god out of that
[52:23] but he didn't he satan said i've done it
[52:27] i've stopped him he can't do it he's got
[52:29] to do it he's got to give
[52:31] listen he had to give cain a life
[52:35] satan knew that satan knew that when he
[52:38] got in that beast and the beast did what
[52:39] he did to eve
[52:40] that because of the law of reproduction
[52:42] before here not this one
[52:45] but the one before he knew god had to
[52:48] honor that because he knew there's one
[52:50] thing i think satan knows is that god
[52:51] pretty much does what he says he's going
[52:53] to do
[52:54] all right so he knew that once he got
[52:57] those seed
[52:58] natural seeds together he could inject
[53:00] himself into the human race
[53:04] that's where you get your seeds from
[53:06] right so god always
[53:08] wanted to be spiritual satan's always
[53:11] been carnal
[53:13] so he used that and brought us into the
[53:15] carnal
[53:17] but what did god do god said okay satan
[53:20] you've got adam and eve and you know
[53:21] what i got to drive them out of the
[53:22] garden of eden we'll see in a few
[53:24] minutes
[53:24] i got to drive them out of the garden of
[53:26] eden and said but you know what you just
[53:28] temporarily
[53:30] stopped a son and daughter of god from
[53:32] being born
[53:34] because in genesis 3 15 he opens it all
[53:36] back up
[53:37] and we'll read it in just a few minutes
[53:39] okay it's that see if god hadn't said in
[53:41] genesis to me genesis 3 15 is
[53:43] probably one of the most important
[53:44] scriptures in the whole
[53:46] as as far as our importance because it
[53:49] gives us a chance
[53:52] come on folks we had no chance when cain
[53:55] and abel were conceived in the womb of
[53:58] eve you and i had
[53:59] no chance as being born again
[54:02] believers we had natural life
[54:06] because every seed had to bring forth of
[54:08] its kind everyone gets together
[54:10] but to come bring you back into that
[54:12] right there
[54:14] you couldn't do it by yourself god had
[54:17] to come and open the door to go back to
[54:18] that
[54:19] amen that's what he did when he came
[54:22] being the seed
[54:24] of the woman all right everybody good
[54:27] say amen
[54:28] all right number three let's read this
[54:29] one now i believe that jesus christ is
[54:31] the same yesterday today and forever
[54:33] believe now in the beginning god made
[54:34] man in his own image and god is a spirit
[54:36] and god made man spirit man
[54:38] then he made him in the dust of the
[54:39] earth now believe that man in the
[54:40] beginning well led the animals of the
[54:42] earth like the holy spirit ought to be
[54:44] leaving leading the church today
[54:48] so let me ask you a question though
[54:50] don't be so carnal to think that adam
[54:52] was just some floating spirit
[54:54] adam was a man god was a man
[54:57] god wait a minute god still is a man all
[55:00] right so he was
[55:01] walking but you know what i don't think
[55:03] he was constrained with
[55:05] with with movement he didn't have to
[55:07] have a car or he could just
[55:09] be on the other side of the earth didn't
[55:11] brother brown say travel like a thought
[55:13] amen travel like a thought that's what
[55:16] we're all going back to now do you think
[55:18] when we get into that new city that
[55:19] we're going to have to call uber
[55:24] no you know what if brother john and i
[55:27] have never been to mars we'll just say
[55:28] hey
[55:29] we'll be back in a few years we'll be in
[55:32] mars
[55:33] standing there amen and just sit down on
[55:36] a rock and talk about whatever we want
[55:38] to talk about
[55:39] see we're so limited here but what did
[55:41] brother brown show us on the countdown
[55:43] if you'll read that message it's really
[55:44] good
[55:45] especially now because of the pressure
[55:47] that's being put on us
[55:48] but god pressurized you to do this but
[55:50] he made us
[55:51] astronauts he didn't he didn't make us
[55:53] earthbound
[55:55] he made us to where we could travel like
[55:58] a fog
[55:59] and god made man spirit man then he made
[56:01] him in the dust of the earth now i
[56:02] believe that man at the beginning well
[56:03] led the animals
[56:04] of the earth like the holy spirit ought
[56:06] to be leading the church today like i
[56:07] said before
[56:08] here was adam adam named all the animals
[56:12] every one of them so they were they were
[56:15] um
[56:16] comfortable lions tigers all the
[56:18] different ones they were comfortable
[56:20] with walking up to adam
[56:21] they were comfortable living together
[56:23] because god told them to multiply and
[56:25] replenish
[56:26] but he said you need to eat the grass
[56:28] and herbs and all the different things
[56:29] in the ground
[56:30] don't you think listen god knew what
[56:33] every creature needed to eat
[56:35] he knew whatever creature needed for for
[56:37] a place to rest
[56:39] and he put it there
[56:42] what do you think we're going back to
[56:45] line will be gentle amen
[56:52] we don't know that though see we've
[56:54] we've all been grown up knowing that
[56:56] and i've always said before all these
[56:58] people that think we're in the
[56:58] millennium
[56:59] that are in the message is a bunch of
[57:01] baloney all i got to do is take them
[57:03] down to the zoo and i won't throw them
[57:04] into the lion's den
[57:06] because if you're in the millennium
[57:09] they're not going to eat you
[57:12] he'll get a revelation real quick
[57:15] that we're still here under the curse
[57:17] but you know what though
[57:18] what did god do god all down through
[57:20] time and even now
[57:23] i've heard the brothers in different
[57:24] places and all
[57:26] where like brother branham the hornet
[57:28] and the and the bull
[57:30] and what did they meet they didn't meet
[57:32] william branham that came from charles
[57:34] and elle brown
[57:36] the bull would have killed him he meant
[57:39] that
[57:40] genesis 1 26. he met that genesis 1 26
[57:44] man which is the same man that's in you
[57:46] today
[57:48] sometimes what gets us first is our fear
[57:54] brother brown said if i had a gun i'd
[57:56] have shot him what that humanity rose up
[57:59] in brother branham
[58:00] because he knew that bull had killed two
[58:02] or three people before
[58:04] and here he was walking in the territory
[58:06] and brother brown being a naturalist and
[58:08] knowing about that
[58:09] he knew he was in that bull's house and
[58:12] he knew what that bull would do
[58:14] but what happened he said something took
[58:17] over
[58:18] now folks that was at genesis 1 26 man
[58:21] that adam
[58:22] from the beginning took over and said oh
[58:25] i'm sorry hornets
[58:27] he didn't get mad at him we start
[58:29] swatting at him and
[58:30] please don't do that being a beekeeper
[58:32] the best thing to do is to make
[58:34] something put your hand in your pocket
[58:36] this is the defense mechanism to a bee
[58:38] or a bug or anything
[58:40] don't do that put your hands in your
[58:41] pocket and just move out of the way most
[58:43] of the time they don't want
[58:44] they don't want to bother you they
[58:46] either want to just check you out
[58:50] just see how you see how you're doing
[58:51] that day you know
[58:54] and you may be having a bad day
[58:56] sometimes and they continue that bad day
[58:59] with a few stings but uh but what am i
[59:03] saying is there
[59:04] that nature that adam had
[59:08] is the same holy ghost nature that you
[59:10] should have today
[59:11] according to that because i believe adam
[59:15] was a full-grown son of god okay
[59:18] he didn't know the seals and he didn't
[59:20] know all these things that we do now
[59:21] because of the fall
[59:22] coming down but he was complete ruler of
[59:26] the whole earth
[59:28] so he like said he wasn't an idiot he
[59:30] knew that's why brother brown many times
[59:32] we read it before her brother brown said
[59:33] uh adam knew what he was doing
[59:36] eve was deceived and we covered that
[59:38] last sunday i hope it didn't hurt
[59:40] anybody's feelings i hope it
[59:41] kind of helped us all a little bit to to
[59:43] see that we can listen
[59:45] we're still deceived
[59:48] anything contrary to the mind of god
[59:52] is a deception even in the message you
[59:55] have false doctrine and all these
[59:57] different things and not just humanity
[59:58] i'm talking about doctrinal wise
[1:00:01] if it's wrong folks it didn't come from
[1:00:03] god
[1:00:05] that's pretty simple all right so now
[1:00:08] let's go to
[1:00:09] genesis 2 7 and the lord formed man out
[1:00:12] of the dust of the ground and breathing
[1:00:13] in his nostrils the breath of life now
[1:00:14] who was standing there
[1:00:15] satan was standing right there lucifer
[1:00:17] was watching this whole thing
[1:00:20] because he knew he couldn't get to that
[1:00:21] spirit man i believe i believe that
[1:00:24] satan
[1:00:25] listen by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:00:27] he can't get to your soul either
[1:00:30] he can try to influence in your memory
[1:00:32] reason conscious effects and imagination
[1:00:34] that's his playground
[1:00:36] and if you don't know that by now you're
[1:00:38] in trouble
[1:00:40] you don't have a white dog black dog in
[1:00:41] you that's fighting because that's
[1:00:43] what's fighting
[1:00:44] remember the old indian said i have in
[1:00:46] me now
[1:00:47] because if you're not born again you're
[1:00:48] just you're just the black you're just
[1:00:50] you're just dark
[1:00:51] inside your soul is just dingy dark but
[1:00:54] by the baptism of holy ghost what
[1:00:55] happens you drive the devil out
[1:00:58] i say you you have to make a choice but
[1:01:01] you drive the devil out well where is he
[1:01:03] going to go
[1:01:04] the bible says he goes out and walks in
[1:01:06] dry places and comes
[1:01:08] back oh the day i got born again the
[1:01:12] next day
[1:01:13] he was back amen
[1:01:16] what was he working at though he wasn't
[1:01:18] trying to get in your soul because it
[1:01:19] was sealed
[1:01:21] i'm telling you folks you better be
[1:01:23] happy that satan can't get to your soul
[1:01:25] god preserved that genesis 1 26 man that
[1:01:28] we're talking about here
[1:01:29] he was going to multiply that genesis 1
[1:01:32] 26
[1:01:32] man didn't matter what satan did didn't
[1:01:35] matter how dark he made it didn't matter
[1:01:37] even through the dark
[1:01:38] ages god filled a group of people with
[1:01:40] that same genesis 1 26
[1:01:42] man and god was happy to see them go
[1:01:45] through
[1:01:46] and be fed the lines not saying happy
[1:01:48] but you don't know what i'm saying they
[1:01:49] had to fulfill a characteristic of every
[1:01:51] church age all right
[1:01:52] okay everybody good well then wake up
[1:01:57] and the lord for a man out of the dust
[1:01:58] of the ground we need i think we're
[1:01:59] gonna start having church at about 12
[1:02:01] and i'll let y'all sleep till by 11 and
[1:02:03] then we'll
[1:02:05] oh lord
[1:02:08] and the lord god formed man of the dust
[1:02:10] of the ground and breathed in his
[1:02:11] nostrils the breath of life and man
[1:02:12] became a living soul
[1:02:14] and the lord god planted a garden
[1:02:15] eastward in eden and there he put the
[1:02:16] man whom he had formed
[1:02:18] and out of the ground may the lord to
[1:02:19] grow every tree that is pleasant to
[1:02:21] sight and good for food now remember
[1:02:22] that's
[1:02:23] the colon there he didn't plant the tree
[1:02:25] of life he was the tree of life
[1:02:27] he was telling them where he was
[1:02:31] the tree of life is jesus christ or
[1:02:33] christ everybody got that
[1:02:34] and what's the other one three of
[1:02:36] knowledge of good and evil is the devil
[1:02:37] now you see brother branham he brings it
[1:02:39] a lot closer because
[1:02:40] he brings it when eve got her knowledge
[1:02:42] she became the tree of knowledge of good
[1:02:44] and evil all right
[1:02:45] because we protect whatever you partake
[1:02:47] of that's what you are
[1:02:49] all right so let's go to the next
[1:02:51] genesis 2 15
[1:02:54] and the lord took the man and put him in
[1:02:57] the garden of eden and dressed at the
[1:02:58] keeping
[1:02:59] the lord of god commanded the man saying
[1:03:00] of every tree of the garden you may
[1:03:02] freely eat he didn't even say he
[1:03:04] couldn't eat the tree of life
[1:03:07] that's not excluded only one tree is
[1:03:10] excluded
[1:03:13] but of the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:03:15] evil thou shalt not eat or what partake
[1:03:18] of when you see that word eat
[1:03:19] in that in this instance here partake do
[1:03:22] not partake of that
[1:03:23] all right because i i was thinking the
[1:03:26] other day we
[1:03:27] we talked about that word eat and what
[1:03:28] happened because there were some
[1:03:29] questions about that
[1:03:30] but brother brown said you and i are
[1:03:32] eating off the body word of the son of
[1:03:34] man we're not
[1:03:37] we're feeding we're we're partaking
[1:03:40] we're indulging
[1:03:42] in the body of the son of man we're not
[1:03:44] vampires we're taking off the
[1:03:45] what there's too much natural going on
[1:03:49] for us to see the spiritual part of this
[1:03:51] that's the same thing with here we see
[1:03:52] all the natural things and we don't see
[1:03:54] the spiritual part
[1:03:55] thou shalt not eat of it or even partake
[1:03:58] of it for in the day that thou
[1:04:00] eatest or partaketh thou shalt surely
[1:04:03] die now see that
[1:04:04] there is your conditional covenant
[1:04:08] remember now we live under an
[1:04:09] unconditional covenant but he lived
[1:04:11] under a conditional covenant adams
[1:04:13] you do this you'll be fine you do this
[1:04:16] you'll die knowing that
[1:04:20] adam was going to partake of this but
[1:04:21] being a savior a healer and a redeemer
[1:04:23] and all these different attributes
[1:04:25] he had to allow adam to come to this
[1:04:28] place
[1:04:29] be put in flesh because brother branham
[1:04:31] said that
[1:04:32] satan knew that as soon as god put them
[1:04:34] in human flesh
[1:04:36] god knew they were going to fall and
[1:04:38] satan's just sitting there waiting
[1:04:41] because once that human flesh showed up
[1:04:43] he said huh i can work on that because
[1:04:45] god told them to multiply
[1:04:48] and they're just in animal flesh i mean
[1:04:50] you and i have no different i mean sure
[1:04:52] we can't commingle with them but back
[1:04:55] then you had a beast
[1:04:59] okay but the tree of knowledge is going
[1:05:01] to be thou shalt not friend the day thou
[1:05:02] eat us thou shalt surely die
[1:05:05] there we go back to that day that one of
[1:05:07] the sisters was asking about the day
[1:05:08] well now see remember if
[1:05:10] brother brown said eve thought she got
[1:05:12] by with something because god didn't
[1:05:14] kill her the day
[1:05:16] that she did what she did that's not
[1:05:18] talking about a 24-hour day
[1:05:21] john was in the lord's day on the isle
[1:05:23] of patmos forever how many years he was
[1:05:24] there he was in the lord's day
[1:05:28] okay give us this day our daily bread i
[1:05:31] always pray that
[1:05:32] give us this day not this 24-hour day
[1:05:35] give us this day that i'm on the earth
[1:05:38] my life for in the day that i'll eat
[1:05:41] there thou shalt surely die so what
[1:05:43] they thought they got by with it but god
[1:05:46] knew nobody was going to live a thousand
[1:05:47] years because a thousand years the day
[1:05:49] and day is a thousand years everybody
[1:05:51] got that all right and the lord god said
[1:05:53] it is not good that the man should be
[1:05:54] alone i will make him a help meet so in
[1:05:56] other ways what did he do
[1:05:58] he made him somebody equal with him
[1:06:00] genesis 3 1.
[1:06:03] now listen so what do you do he made
[1:06:07] eve he brought a flesh of adam
[1:06:11] put it here made a woman he did his
[1:06:14] pottery thing again
[1:06:15] took another little bit of clay
[1:06:19] boy you ought to watch i mean really if
[1:06:21] you ever that was kind of an elementary
[1:06:23] thing i
[1:06:24] i grew up in pottery right there across
[1:06:26] from my house and
[1:06:27] man they you think there's no way they
[1:06:29] can take maybe about that much clay
[1:06:33] and they'll make what they call a
[1:06:34] strawberry jar and what you do is you
[1:06:36] plant strawberries it's got holes in the
[1:06:37] sides of it
[1:06:38] and they'll mold that thing up and
[1:06:39] they'll bring it all the way up now the
[1:06:41] jar will be this big and this big around
[1:06:42] now that one little bit of clay
[1:06:44] watch what god did to me and you and
[1:06:46] like the analogy was when you start
[1:06:48] you start pressing on the inside you got
[1:06:51] to have pressure on the inside
[1:06:53] to create a place for god to be
[1:06:57] or for the water to be so now we come up
[1:06:59] to the serpent the serpent was more
[1:07:00] subtle
[1:07:02] than any beast of the field now we know
[1:07:04] that he's an upright walking creature
[1:07:06] he looks kind of like man kind of like
[1:07:08] monkey everybody got that same man
[1:07:11] all right looks like a little bit like
[1:07:13] man a little bit like monkey he don't
[1:07:14] look like snake
[1:07:16] he turns into snake but he's a walking
[1:07:19] upright creature
[1:07:21] that has somewhat intelligence but not a
[1:07:24] man
[1:07:24] he can't be have a soul brother brown
[1:07:26] said he had a place for one in other
[1:07:28] words
[1:07:28] he didn't have a place he had a place
[1:07:33] in creation because he was the closest
[1:07:37] thing to man
[1:07:38] and what did satan do and somebody was
[1:07:41] talking the other day we were talking
[1:07:42] i believe i believe the serpent or the
[1:07:45] beast
[1:07:46] was uh he was kind of a house
[1:07:50] man and woman he kind of helped help
[1:07:52] adam and eve
[1:07:53] you know talk to the animals and
[1:07:56] they probably were around each other a
[1:07:58] lot so satan goes
[1:08:00] found me something satan's right there
[1:08:03] he ain't off somewhere playing
[1:08:05] no he's right here today playing in your
[1:08:07] mind in my mind
[1:08:10] keeping us from listening to the word of
[1:08:11] god just like he was there
[1:08:14] because he starts talking he steps in
[1:08:17] vicariously
[1:08:18] he anoints that beast
[1:08:22] everybody got that he anoints that beast
[1:08:25] and then he just the beast just yields
[1:08:27] itself because he's an animal
[1:08:29] and satan just starts talking
[1:08:32] and it's not like hey
[1:08:35] how do i talk to you no no no
[1:08:39] same voice the same voice that the beast
[1:08:42] used the whole time
[1:08:44] satan's not a dummy he just says oh hey
[1:08:47] eve good morning
[1:08:49] you having a good day today yeah have a
[1:08:51] good day hey have you noticed what the
[1:08:53] animals are doing out there
[1:08:55] you know i kind of heard that
[1:08:58] god wanted you to do the same thing
[1:09:01] and and there's nothing going on here
[1:09:04] let me show you how it's done wouldn't
[1:09:07] you think that would be
[1:09:07] it yeah so he said unto the woman
[1:09:11] yeah god said you shall not eat of every
[1:09:13] tree of the garden
[1:09:15] and the woman said unto the serpent we
[1:09:17] may eat of the fruit of the trees of the
[1:09:18] garden
[1:09:20] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[1:09:22] the midst of the garden now remember we
[1:09:23] spoke on that
[1:09:26] what you talking about her
[1:09:30] you don't touch her fruit
[1:09:34] in the midst everybody understand what
[1:09:35] i'm talking about without being graphic
[1:09:37] but of the tree of the because see
[1:09:39] listen eve wasn't an
[1:09:41] idiot either she could watch what was
[1:09:44] going on she was co-equal with adam she
[1:09:46] was
[1:09:46] trying to understand but what she did is
[1:09:49] she got ahead of the program
[1:09:53] she got ahead of the program god's
[1:09:55] program was adam speak to eve
[1:09:57] have children bring this genesis 1 26
[1:10:00] into being
[1:10:02] eve's like
[1:10:05] i think i'll listen to this guy because
[1:10:07] we'll get it
[1:10:08] we got a new revelation we read this to
[1:10:10] you the other day
[1:10:12] but of the tree which is in the midst of
[1:10:14] the garden
[1:10:15] god has said you shall need of it
[1:10:16] neither shall you touch it
[1:10:19] so it's not a literal tree we know what
[1:10:21] that is lest you die
[1:10:23] the serpent said of the woman you shall
[1:10:26] not surely die right there change the
[1:10:29] whole aspect of the
[1:10:31] conversation because what did it do that
[1:10:34] knot
[1:10:34] went into eve's womb up here
[1:10:37] and she got to thinking well maybe i
[1:10:42] won't
[1:10:44] maybe i won't die brother brown said she
[1:10:47] fell on jesus christ being the same
[1:10:48] yesterday today and forever what he said
[1:10:50] was what he meant and what he meant what
[1:10:52] he said
[1:10:53] she said oh i think i'll take that
[1:10:56] for god doesn't know that in the day you
[1:10:57] eat the other then your eyes shall be
[1:10:59] opened
[1:11:00] you shall be as gods knowing good and
[1:11:01] evil and when the woman saw that the
[1:11:04] tree was good for food
[1:11:05] and it was pleasant to the eyes and a
[1:11:07] tree to be desired i've never seen one
[1:11:08] like that out in the woods
[1:11:10] and a tree to be desired to make one
[1:11:12] wise she took of the fruit thereof
[1:11:14] and did partake or did eat and gave also
[1:11:18] into her husband with her
[1:11:19] and he did eat now this is brother brown
[1:11:22] said
[1:11:22] that the the devil met her in the
[1:11:25] morning
[1:11:26] and she had to find adam or
[1:11:30] something for the afternoon of the
[1:11:32] evening to present it to him because
[1:11:35] he partook of it but now remember like i
[1:11:37] said before
[1:11:38] there's a lot went on between that time
[1:11:41] that's not
[1:11:41] just not saying because adam realized
[1:11:45] what she had done but what was she doing
[1:11:48] she was so
[1:11:49] zealous isn't that sometimes that you
[1:11:51] and i
[1:11:52] we do the same thing and i believe
[1:11:53] that's what when we come to places in
[1:11:56] our lives that we make mistakes
[1:11:58] why do we make mistakes we get zealous
[1:12:04] and we want to do something outside of
[1:12:06] god's program or we want to
[1:12:08] try to push the program or try to make
[1:12:10] this happen
[1:12:13] i know it's with me i mean the things i
[1:12:17] want
[1:12:18] i want them now patience is a virtue
[1:12:27] i'm just being honest and so but what do
[1:12:29] i do i mess up
[1:12:31] why do i mess up i go out further
[1:12:34] than what god told me to do
[1:12:37] eve
[1:12:40] to me she formulated that in her mind
[1:12:44] and said okay if i do this and then i
[1:12:48] get adam
[1:12:49] then we'll be doing what god told us to
[1:12:51] do
[1:12:52] how beautiful but deadly
[1:12:56] how beautiful is that though same way
[1:12:58] with the denominations i believe when
[1:13:01] when that satan there at nicea satan was
[1:13:03] there
[1:13:05] he was formulating this whole plan and
[1:13:06] he just kept putting what
[1:13:08] little seeds into the womb of those
[1:13:11] men's mind
[1:13:12] at nicea and he says what about this
[1:13:17] and those prophets there brother ramsay
[1:13:18] those prophet true word of god prophet
[1:13:20] stood there and tried their best
[1:13:22] to get them to stay with the word of god
[1:13:24] and they wouldn't have nothing of it
[1:13:25] they said oh jesus
[1:13:28] well he can't be god but he could be a
[1:13:30] like substance he
[1:13:32] he could be a son of a and then what
[1:13:34] about this holy ghost
[1:13:36] that was the devil doing that folks you
[1:13:38] see how slick he was
[1:13:39] he wasn't out in the bar rooms he was
[1:13:41] sitting there in that nice city council
[1:13:46] in control
[1:13:50] fully in control because that's what man
[1:13:53] accepted
[1:13:55] and it was nothing to do with god not
[1:13:57] even in the bible
[1:13:58] a trinity and the baptism
[1:14:02] but what did god do he winked at the
[1:14:03] ignorance of those men
[1:14:06] and allowed it to continue to go but he
[1:14:08] had to restore
[1:14:10] by this end time prophet he had to bring
[1:14:13] all of it back
[1:14:14] to before nicea before all that to where
[1:14:17] jesus christ walked on the face of the
[1:14:18] earth and there was
[1:14:20] the seat of the woman there was the
[1:14:23] thing that was going to not
[1:14:25] not sexually bring us back
[1:14:28] but spiritually spoken word seed was
[1:14:31] what was going to bring us back
[1:14:33] because how did jesus come spoken word
[1:14:36] seed
[1:14:37] amen through the womb of a virgin
[1:14:41] how could that happen she said but she
[1:14:43] said be it unto me
[1:14:45] the day you got born again i'll
[1:14:47] guarantee you
[1:14:49] you said i can't this and i'm two and i
[1:14:52] i
[1:14:52] stood right here and did the same thing
[1:14:55] i've done this i've done that i can't do
[1:14:57] this i can't this
[1:14:58] i'm i'm i'm i'm god had to shut you up
[1:15:04] clear your mind the womb of your mind
[1:15:07] because then you had to you just stand
[1:15:09] right here and say god
[1:15:10] if you need healing today if you need to
[1:15:12] baptize my holy ghost you say god
[1:15:14] i'm an empty vessel i got all this junk
[1:15:17] running through the womb of my mind and
[1:15:19] i want you to plant a seed
[1:15:22] of your word in my mind and then i'm
[1:15:24] going to let it fall down here
[1:15:28] you say oh it's too simple that's how it
[1:15:30] all happens
[1:15:32] but you got to believe listen mary had
[1:15:35] to believe not for just
[1:15:37] instant
[1:15:40] sisters she had to wait to her next
[1:15:43] 28-day cycle if you understand what i
[1:15:44] mean
[1:15:45] to even no but she just said being unto
[1:15:47] me according to thy word i'm right here
[1:15:49] give it to me i i'm
[1:15:52] isaiah 9 6 is going through my what the
[1:15:55] womb of my mind
[1:15:57] somebody's got to fulfill that and
[1:16:00] satan's over there going
[1:16:02] hey you don't know no man that's what
[1:16:05] she said right
[1:16:07] she said how can i do this now see that
[1:16:09] was still satan up here
[1:16:11] putting doubt how can i do this knowing
[1:16:13] no man
[1:16:15] and gabriel just walked her through
[1:16:16] every bit of it she said he said you'll
[1:16:18] be overshadowed by the holy ghost and so
[1:16:20] that thing formed in you
[1:16:21] will be the son of god
[1:16:24] and i believe that god then turned and
[1:16:27] went right to mary and planted that seed
[1:16:29] of isaiah 9 6. listen you and i get born
[1:16:32] again
[1:16:33] by the word of god
[1:16:37] you're not born again by grier's almanac
[1:16:39] or some
[1:16:40] some good saying from charles dobson and
[1:16:42] he makes good sayings i'm not saying
[1:16:44] anything about him
[1:16:44] but you got born again because you
[1:16:46] realize you were lost by what some
[1:16:48] preacher told you out of the word of god
[1:16:52] you're not right you're doing not doing
[1:16:53] this you're not doing that the word
[1:16:54] tells you to do this
[1:16:56] that's god planting the seed word
[1:17:00] into your womb of your mind than to let
[1:17:03] it drop
[1:17:04] down to right here
[1:17:07] this is where it does good
[1:17:11] because satan can still plant one up
[1:17:12] here
[1:17:15] this womb is closed if you got the holy
[1:17:17] ghost everybody got that right
[1:17:20] i believe that's what adam knew about
[1:17:21] eve that if he didn't do something her
[1:17:23] womb was going to close up and she was
[1:17:25] going to be in big trouble because she
[1:17:26] was fixing to bring forth
[1:17:28] a man from a beast or a baby from a
[1:17:30] beast but that's just me
[1:17:32] i don't have no quotes on that but adam
[1:17:35] knew he couldn't just stand there
[1:17:36] he had to do something jesus christ knew
[1:17:38] he couldn't just stand there
[1:17:40] he had to do something he said i'll put
[1:17:44] in my tea
[1:17:45] we'll read it in just a minute everybody
[1:17:46] okay i know some of you are asleep but
[1:17:48] you know what
[1:17:50] just sleep on i can't make if i can't
[1:17:52] get you excited
[1:17:53] nobody can for god to know that the day
[1:17:57] that you eat thereof then your eyes
[1:17:58] shall be opened
[1:18:00] and you shall be as gods knowing good
[1:18:02] and evil she didn't know evil then
[1:18:04] now she knows evil what the carnal mind
[1:18:07] is what enmity to god
[1:18:09] the carnal mind is that division between
[1:18:12] this person
[1:18:14] i'm not saying you got two people but
[1:18:15] from this person this born again
[1:18:18] and the person you walk around in all
[1:18:19] day the spirit part of you
[1:18:21] of your memory reason conscious effects
[1:18:23] and imagination all right and when the
[1:18:25] woman saw the tree was good for food and
[1:18:26] pleasant to the eye tree to be desired
[1:18:28] another word sheep or took give it to
[1:18:30] adam and the eyes of them both were open
[1:18:32] they knew they were naked
[1:18:34] and they sewed fig leaves together and
[1:18:36] made themselves
[1:18:37] aprons let's go to first timothy 2 verse
[1:18:39] 12.
[1:18:40] it says but i suffer not a woman to
[1:18:42] teach nor earthship authority over the
[1:18:43] man but to be
[1:18:44] in silence for adam was first formed
[1:18:47] then eve
[1:18:48] and adam was not deceived but the woman
[1:18:51] being deceived was in the transgression
[1:18:54] we talked about that last sunday so
[1:18:56] let's go to the word deceive
[1:19:01] yep go to the next right there to cause
[1:19:04] to accept as truth are valid what is
[1:19:07] false or invalid
[1:19:10] if you're deceived you think
[1:19:14] what you've got is truth
[1:19:19] eve thought what she did was what god
[1:19:22] wanted her to do
[1:19:24] all those at nicea being motivated by
[1:19:28] satan though
[1:19:29] eve being motivated by satan not
[1:19:32] motivated by god
[1:19:34] motivated by satan thought they were
[1:19:36] what getting
[1:19:37] new revelation oh you prophets go back
[1:19:41] and eat your herbs and
[1:19:42] what do you mean jesus was god and only
[1:19:45] one
[1:19:46] and what do you mean that uh
[1:19:49] jesus told us we read the writings of
[1:19:51] matthew where he said baptize in the
[1:19:52] name of father
[1:19:53] son and holy ghost and then old prophet
[1:19:56] says yes but
[1:19:59] you're not reading the word you're not
[1:20:02] getting a true revelation
[1:20:04] what is his name of the father and the
[1:20:06] son and the holy ghost
[1:20:08] and they said ah you're false what they
[1:20:10] thought they were right
[1:20:12] but satan knowing that it was wrong
[1:20:15] see that's the deception i wrote read
[1:20:18] the scripture in matthew 6 verse 22 i
[1:20:22] i even cautioned myself when you read
[1:20:25] the scripture i cautioned myself you
[1:20:27] should caution yourself
[1:20:29] the light of the body is the eye if
[1:20:30] therefore thine eye be single
[1:20:32] the whole body shall be full of light
[1:20:34] but if thine eye be evil
[1:20:37] thy whole body shall be full of darkness
[1:20:38] now wait a minute but you're but watch
[1:20:41] if therefore the light that is in thee
[1:20:43] be darkness
[1:20:46] how great is that darkness who's he
[1:20:48] talking to he's talking to pharisees and
[1:20:49] sadducees they thought they were right
[1:20:52] we be abraham's seed we have moses as
[1:20:54] our prophet we got moses quote book
[1:20:58] but jesus is telling him said look
[1:21:00] what's in you is darkness
[1:21:02] you think it's light how much greater
[1:21:05] deception is it
[1:21:08] because we're going to read a quote in a
[1:21:09] minute where brother brown said eve got
[1:21:10] new
[1:21:11] thoughts she got new light all right so
[1:21:14] we're going to read that here in just a
[1:21:15] minute
[1:21:16] number four
[1:21:19] position of believer in christ but the
[1:21:21] misunderstanding was they thought i'd
[1:21:23] said that adam
[1:21:24] never sinned but adam did sin but he did
[1:21:26] it with his eyes wide open
[1:21:31] in timothy 3 verse we just read it
[1:21:34] it said that adam was not deceived but
[1:21:36] the woman being to see was in the
[1:21:37] transgression see
[1:21:38] eve actually thought she was right so
[1:21:40] you understand
[1:21:41] you understand what i'm trying to tell
[1:21:42] you it's not this
[1:21:44] dirty act that we have formulated in our
[1:21:47] mind
[1:21:48] it's what happened between eve and the
[1:21:49] beast
[1:21:51] she thought she was in the process of
[1:21:54] fulfilling what god had said
[1:21:57] because it wasn't so out of the normal
[1:21:59] by watching the animals
[1:22:02] procreate everybody got that eve
[1:22:05] actually thought she was right but
[1:22:06] satan deceived her but he didn't deceive
[1:22:10] adam he knew it was wrong but because of
[1:22:13] the love for his wife like i said before
[1:22:15] it was adam had to dig real
[1:22:19] deep in his love for that woman
[1:22:24] after what she did so it wasn't
[1:22:28] filial love that work goes in memories
[1:22:30] and conscious affection
[1:22:32] and imagination it was the agape love
[1:22:35] that god had put in him of that genesis
[1:22:37] 1 26
[1:22:38] man that said
[1:22:41] i can't kill her he didn't kill you did
[1:22:44] he
[1:22:47] no eve actually thought she was right
[1:22:49] but satan deceived her but he didn't
[1:22:51] deceive adam he knew it was wrong
[1:22:52] but because of the love for his wife he
[1:22:55] represented himself with sin
[1:22:57] and was condemned by the same
[1:23:00] and cast out of the garden of eden
[1:23:04] you know probably in adam's mind he was
[1:23:06] saying well now if i can just
[1:23:07] if i can just protect her
[1:23:12] some way god won't kill her but he wound
[1:23:14] up both of them dying
[1:23:17] right just like jesus christ he knew
[1:23:19] we're dying he knew we were dead
[1:23:21] he says well i got to go die too that's
[1:23:23] what he did
[1:23:24] jesus christ came down here and died in
[1:23:26] human literally died in human flesh
[1:23:27] his human flesh died all right
[1:23:32] cast out of the garden of eden but what
[1:23:34] what happened when
[1:23:35] jesus came the right way he's going to
[1:23:38] head us back into the garden of eden
[1:23:40] all right let's look at number five but
[1:23:41] what what's the thing brother brown god
[1:23:44] is looking and trying moving begging
[1:23:45] persuading to find a little heart that
[1:23:47] he can come into
[1:23:48] and coo and make love to that's what he
[1:23:49] did with mary
[1:23:52] mind right
[1:23:56] how he took adam and eve before the
[1:23:57] world was before sin came into the world
[1:23:59] look at adam
[1:24:01] what a beautiful type adam and eve was
[1:24:03] the type of christ in the church
[1:24:05] now remember eve did not sin adam sinned
[1:24:08] that's right not eve adam's sin see not
[1:24:12] eve
[1:24:12] she was the one who did the act but adam
[1:24:14] done the sinning
[1:24:16] the woman was deceived the bible said
[1:24:19] she was deceived she thought she was
[1:24:20] right but adam knowed it was wrong see
[1:24:23] and now look when adam saw eve had
[1:24:24] sinned and had done wrong adam walked
[1:24:26] right out
[1:24:27] not deceived but with both eyes open he
[1:24:30] grabbed her and he walked out of the
[1:24:31] garden of eden
[1:24:34] but he so loved eve that he took her
[1:24:36] place and death
[1:24:38] with her and walked out with her
[1:24:41] so see it like i said before it wasn't a
[1:24:44] it wasn't an act of sex between
[1:24:46] adam and eve that saved her it actually
[1:24:49] killed them both
[1:24:52] it ain't some righteous something adam
[1:24:54] did when he placed a literal seed
[1:24:57] you understand what i mean you can't say
[1:24:59] that i don't know what so you see the
[1:25:01] devil's got into people's minds in this
[1:25:02] message
[1:25:04] we've heard it from some well-known
[1:25:07] people
[1:25:07] that wasn't god that said that i'm not
[1:25:10] saying anything about the brothers
[1:25:13] but that wasn't a true statement adam
[1:25:15] didn't place his literals listen i read
[1:25:16] you a quote the other day where brother
[1:25:18] brown said adam seed is what polluted
[1:25:20] the world
[1:25:20] woman don't have a seed adam's literal
[1:25:23] seed is what killed
[1:25:25] abel saith and all the way down
[1:25:30] sorry a sex act don't save you that's
[1:25:34] what's killing us
[1:25:36] you understand what i mean not that
[1:25:38] that's wrong
[1:25:39] in its right place it's right all right
[1:25:42] but what's killing us though is a carnal
[1:25:43] mind
[1:25:45] jesus remember watch with jesus when he
[1:25:47] walked on earth remember he didn't have
[1:25:48] a carnal mind why he didn't have no
[1:25:50] daddy to look back to he didn't have no
[1:25:51] mama
[1:25:52] he didn't have a genealogist he just
[1:25:54] said before abraham was
[1:25:56] i am
[1:25:59] that was an eternal mind of god which
[1:26:02] now by the new birth is coming to me and
[1:26:04] you
[1:26:06] to take care of this carnal mind which
[1:26:07] is that enmity with god
[1:26:10] all right all right let's go to number
[1:26:14] six please let's go to the red
[1:26:17] down where the red is eve actually
[1:26:21] thought she was right
[1:26:22] she was getting some new light that
[1:26:24] satan was giving her just like he walked
[1:26:26] into nicaea
[1:26:28] and was going to give them some new life
[1:26:30] well that's just
[1:26:31] old stuff that's 300 jesus died 300
[1:26:33] years ago and he
[1:26:34] he came back yeah well just like today
[1:26:37] like brother brown you know he said that
[1:26:39] everything
[1:26:40] everything ended with the now brother
[1:26:41] brown said people said that
[1:26:43] that everything ended with the apostles
[1:26:45] you know apostolic age was not now
[1:26:48] what that's the devil telling them that
[1:26:49] now same thing and i said i said oh
[1:26:51] that's all over with we got new light
[1:26:53] coming
[1:26:54] well whose light was it that light in
[1:26:57] them was darkness
[1:26:59] but you know what they just kept going
[1:27:01] right on
[1:27:03] they brought a pope they just kept
[1:27:04] building it up
[1:27:06] bible talk calls them children of
[1:27:08] disobedience brother brown says
[1:27:10] he says a child can't deceive you but
[1:27:13] when that child grows up
[1:27:16] he can deceive you that's why it's going
[1:27:17] to be the beast in the end a full-grown
[1:27:19] man
[1:27:20] that's going to take over all right and
[1:27:22] we're not going to be here to see it but
[1:27:24] we know who it is
[1:27:25] number seven please this is where we
[1:27:28] were talking about the holy ghost veil
[1:27:29] now notice she pulled off the holy veil
[1:27:31] to see what sex really was compare that
[1:27:34] what lush really would do
[1:27:36] she pulled the veil from off of her eyes
[1:27:38] the holy thing that god had put over her
[1:27:40] eyes
[1:27:40] she wanted knowledge to know what it was
[1:27:42] all about so she pulled the veil off to
[1:27:44] see what it was all about
[1:27:46] she listened to the devil and noticed
[1:27:48] what a place that put her in
[1:27:50] they have done the same in each age it
[1:27:53] didn't just happen back there
[1:27:55] see when i was 14 years old and i was
[1:27:57] reading the message books
[1:28:00] i got a carnal human knowledge of what
[1:28:02] brother branham was talking about
[1:28:05] but i put it back under because i didn't
[1:28:08] have the baptism of the holy ghost but
[1:28:09] now with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:28:10] you can see that that
[1:28:12] serpent seed and that satan's eating and
[1:28:13] all is all right down here
[1:28:15] and it carries on after we leave
[1:28:19] satan continues even i was reading
[1:28:21] yesterday
[1:28:22] even at the end of the thousand years
[1:28:24] satan still thinks he can gather enough
[1:28:27] people
[1:28:28] to defeat us and then that's when god
[1:28:31] says not
[1:28:32] uh we all need to move out of the way
[1:28:34] because this fixing to get ugly
[1:28:37] you know you thought atomic bomb a
[1:28:39] thousand years ago was ugly this is
[1:28:41] going to be real ugly you just stay
[1:28:42] right over here and i'm going to take
[1:28:43] care of all
[1:28:44] i'm going to kill the demons i'm going
[1:28:45] to kill them i'm going to take care of
[1:28:47] every one of them
[1:28:48] and then the new city what happens here
[1:28:50] we come
[1:28:51] right down that new city there ain't a
[1:28:53] devil nowhere
[1:28:55] oh man
[1:28:58] she listened to the devil and noticed
[1:28:59] what a place it put her in they have
[1:29:01] done the same thing in each age
[1:29:03] thereafter
[1:29:04] always taking the intellectual side
[1:29:07] and has now built a kingdom of satan
[1:29:10] knowledge his seed that he sowed
[1:29:12] and has took the world to be an eden of
[1:29:15] death
[1:29:15] now notice now look at revelations 3 the
[1:29:17] lao to see in church age you think it in
[1:29:19] your mind now notice she
[1:29:20] eve is satan's queen see satan the
[1:29:23] serpent
[1:29:24] got to eve before adam got to her that's
[1:29:26] right so he beguiled her see
[1:29:28] so satan the serpent was the husband of
[1:29:30] eve before adam ever knew now we know
[1:29:32] that
[1:29:33] see he beguiled her the bible said he
[1:29:35] did and she knowed she was naked then
[1:29:38] see he's somebody layout to see in
[1:29:39] church age which is wretched and
[1:29:40] miserable naked blind and don't know it
[1:29:42] see that light that they think they have
[1:29:45] is darkness and what's the darkest age
[1:29:47] this age because what
[1:29:48] the most light is here all right if that
[1:29:52] light in you be darkness now i'm not
[1:29:53] talking about it out there i'm talking
[1:29:54] about
[1:29:54] in this christian church brother brown
[1:29:58] said the framework of the
[1:30:00] christian church now look at the
[1:30:03] laodicean church age eve sitting at
[1:30:04] satan's queen she is rich in worldly
[1:30:06] goods blind naked again and don't know
[1:30:08] it
[1:30:08] just like it was in god's eden but now
[1:30:11] not because the holy veil is over her
[1:30:13] face but the lust veil
[1:30:14] that she took off god's holy veil and
[1:30:16] put on a veil of knowledge for lust and
[1:30:18] now she has a lust veil that she is
[1:30:20] blind
[1:30:21] to it being seen she is naked on the
[1:30:23] street and don't know it i was thinking
[1:30:25] you know
[1:30:26] just look at what people do to their
[1:30:27] self on the street
[1:30:30] and that are sitting in denominational
[1:30:32] churches
[1:30:34] tattoos earrings you understand what i
[1:30:37] mean the markings that they've marked
[1:30:39] their self with
[1:30:42] do you think anybody else is going to
[1:30:44] church today
[1:30:46] for the wrong reason
[1:30:50] no they got out just like you did
[1:30:53] thinking that their baptist preacher
[1:30:55] methodist preacher pentecostal preacher
[1:30:57] message preacher
[1:31:00] is going to give them a seed word of
[1:31:02] revelation
[1:31:06] where's the deception is that they're
[1:31:09] getting fed
[1:31:11] if you ever want to re you think you
[1:31:13] think sometimes we get strong
[1:31:14] read god of this evil age
[1:31:18] and satan's eden brother brown says
[1:31:20] they're out there in those
[1:31:21] denominational churches
[1:31:24] worshiping satan thinking they're
[1:31:27] worshiping god
[1:31:29] hands raised singing praise and worship
[1:31:32] brothers reading out of the same bible
[1:31:34] that you and i read out of
[1:31:36] and they're worshiping the devil and
[1:31:39] don't know it
[1:31:40] could we be doing the same thing
[1:31:44] can we be doing the same thing
[1:31:50] but we've been given the pure word of
[1:31:51] god folks
[1:31:53] straight from the mind of god to a
[1:31:55] little prophet
[1:31:56] to me and you and it's being done by the
[1:31:59] holy ghost
[1:32:00] and the holy ghost is never wrong listen
[1:32:02] the holy ghost never told evil to do
[1:32:04] what she did
[1:32:05] satan that unholy spirit told eve what
[1:32:08] to do
[1:32:08] put on a lust veil but you know what
[1:32:10] that didn't that didn't stop god's plan
[1:32:13] that was part of it
[1:32:14] so don't get discouraged
[1:32:19] because look right here it's where i
[1:32:20] want to get to
[1:32:22] we get to twins sometime and they heard
[1:32:24] the voice of the lord god walking in the
[1:32:25] garden
[1:32:26] cool today and adam and his wife hid
[1:32:28] themselves now listen
[1:32:29] at this point in time she was already
[1:32:32] defiled
[1:32:35] she had two literal she had taken the
[1:32:37] seed of
[1:32:38] the womb of her mind from satan she had
[1:32:40] already had the natural act with the
[1:32:42] beast
[1:32:42] and then she had the natural act with
[1:32:44] adam so she had a set of twins in her
[1:32:47] at that point in time did everybody
[1:32:48] understand that say amen natural
[1:32:51] all right because what you got to do is
[1:32:53] when we're talking about that genesis 1
[1:32:55] and genesis
[1:32:56] 1 4 is let every seed bring forth of its
[1:32:59] kind but then you've got that spiritual
[1:33:01] part that's up here
[1:33:03] every seed bring forth of its kind the
[1:33:05] genesis 1 26 man is not sexual
[1:33:08] what did satan do he brought this down
[1:33:10] and put it over here
[1:33:13] but god just said that's okay i'm going
[1:33:16] to have these kids anyway these are my
[1:33:17] children i'm going to have them anyway
[1:33:20] it may have to be by where brother brown
[1:33:21] says this one bread to this one this and
[1:33:23] bread to this one 4 000 people
[1:33:25] of a generation to get you here
[1:33:28] to get you here because you were part of
[1:33:30] that genesis 1 26
[1:33:33] don't you think god's in control every
[1:33:36] aspect
[1:33:39] so the her divorce the lord god walking
[1:33:40] in the garden to cool the day and adam's
[1:33:42] wife hid himself from the presence of
[1:33:43] the lord among the trees of the garden
[1:33:45] there they go getting in trees again
[1:33:47] and the lord god called unto adam and
[1:33:49] said unto him for arthur
[1:33:51] he didn't have to ever do that before
[1:33:55] but remember god knew where he was god
[1:33:58] knew what they'd done
[1:33:59] but look at this gracious god
[1:34:03] he's going to let adam and eve
[1:34:08] confess what they did
[1:34:11] didn't you and i have to confess what we
[1:34:12] did god
[1:34:14] knew what we did from the foundation of
[1:34:16] the world he knew what we were going to
[1:34:17] do
[1:34:18] but he wanted you to confess it out of
[1:34:20] your mouth from the womb of your mind
[1:34:24] and confess it so that he can clear it
[1:34:26] out and put that womb in your heart i
[1:34:28] mean that seed in your heart
[1:34:29] amen he called in the lamb and said
[1:34:32] where are thou
[1:34:33] he said i heard that voice in the garden
[1:34:36] and i was afraid
[1:34:39] because i was naked and i hid myself
[1:34:42] and god said who told you you were naked
[1:34:44] see he's trying to get he's telling
[1:34:46] adam's got to make a confession here
[1:34:48] hast thou eaten of the tree wherever i
[1:34:50] commanded thee that thou should has not
[1:34:51] eat
[1:34:53] and the man said the woman whom thou
[1:34:54] giveth to be with me
[1:34:57] she gave me of the tree and i didn't eat
[1:35:00] there's one quote where brother brown
[1:35:01] says they do
[1:35:02] they're doing like the army they're
[1:35:03] passing the buck
[1:35:05] because adam did he said she she she
[1:35:07] gave it to me
[1:35:08] and the lord god said another woman what
[1:35:11] is it that thou has done and the woman
[1:35:12] said the serpent beguiled me and i did
[1:35:14] eat
[1:35:15] and the lord god said unto the serpent
[1:35:18] because thou hast done this thou art
[1:35:19] cursed above all cattle every beast of
[1:35:21] the field
[1:35:22] upon thy belly shalt thou go in other
[1:35:24] words boom he became a what a snake
[1:35:27] a serpent that we realized today
[1:35:29] remember they asked brother brown
[1:35:30] said well where is he today well he's
[1:35:32] right there
[1:35:34] he's in that snake line somewhere
[1:35:36] because that's where god put it
[1:35:38] he put him in that snake line so man
[1:35:40] couldn't find him
[1:35:41] and dust shalt thou eat all the days of
[1:35:43] thy life
[1:35:45] and i will put enmity
[1:35:49] now there's one definition there's
[1:35:50] there's a couple of definitions one
[1:35:52] definition for enmity is
[1:35:54] we'll read it in a minute but i'm gonna
[1:35:55] do this and then we'll go through it
[1:35:58] it's a mutual hatred or ill will
[1:36:03] and what does that cause though
[1:36:07] a division birds of a feather flock
[1:36:10] together if you don't
[1:36:11] like my i ain't gonna go to your house
[1:36:14] and if you don't like my
[1:36:15] i ain't gonna go to your house and you
[1:36:16] understand what i mean if you don't like
[1:36:17] my doctrine i'm not gonna go to your
[1:36:19] church hello
[1:36:20] right but god said i will put enmity
[1:36:24] between thee who is thee
[1:36:29] the serpent the
[1:36:33] and the woman that's standing here
[1:36:37] right there's going to be a division
[1:36:40] listen
[1:36:40] it's not going to be this woman cannot
[1:36:43] bring forth my
[1:36:45] children the children of god like i
[1:36:48] wanted in genesis 1 26
[1:36:50] but
[1:36:55] right here i will put enmity
[1:36:58] a division there's not going to be any
[1:37:02] more
[1:37:05] the remember the surface now snake and
[1:37:08] he's got
[1:37:09] a different whole different kind of dna
[1:37:11] right there is no more dna of the beast
[1:37:13] it's like it's in cane now actually
[1:37:16] everybody got that king's body came from
[1:37:19] that beast
[1:37:20] so where you see all these neanderthals
[1:37:22] and the men that look
[1:37:24] that's where it came from it didn't come
[1:37:26] from abel abel like adam
[1:37:28] you ever thought of that you should
[1:37:32] because cain looked different than abel
[1:37:33] ain't no they had two different seeds
[1:37:35] two different daddies
[1:37:38] and the woman i'm gonna put a division
[1:37:40] in between thy
[1:37:41] seed and her seed now remember
[1:37:45] her seed don't have a seed
[1:37:48] so he's saying what there's the promise
[1:37:51] that i'm going to give this woman a seed
[1:37:55] not from human instrumentality or male
[1:37:57] instrumentality but from what the spoken
[1:37:59] word of god
[1:38:01] and it shall bruise thy head
[1:38:05] and thou shalt bruise his heel speaking
[1:38:07] of calvary
[1:38:08] where he struck the head of satan at
[1:38:11] calvary but
[1:38:12] look to me and you and all of the world
[1:38:14] it looked like that
[1:38:15] jesus christ was nothing
[1:38:18] just a normal man they caught doing
[1:38:20] something and
[1:38:21] threw him up on a cross and he's crying
[1:38:23] why thou forsaken me and he's
[1:38:25] saying this and he's saying that to the
[1:38:27] world it just looked like another thief
[1:38:32] satan was just laughing but he wasn't
[1:38:35] laughing
[1:38:35] a few days later
[1:38:39] he wasn't laughing when that same man
[1:38:43] showed up at his doorstep
[1:38:46] and said hey
[1:38:50] i've come to uh get the keys here
[1:38:54] i need the keys i need the keys uh
[1:38:57] you don't need them anymore because i've
[1:38:59] destroyed what you have thought you've
[1:39:00] set up
[1:39:02] i have destroyed your kingdom what by
[1:39:04] the woman's
[1:39:06] seed what a promise right there if god
[1:39:08] didn't do this
[1:39:09] he couldn't have come if he didn't say
[1:39:12] that because remember god does what he
[1:39:13] says and says what he does
[1:39:15] because what did he do it put in enmity
[1:39:16] there was no other son of god born
[1:39:19] from adam all the way to jesus christ no
[1:39:21] one everyone was born wrong
[1:39:24] and did not have a part of that genesis
[1:39:26] 1 26 and 27 man
[1:39:29] in their soul in the old testament they
[1:39:32] were covered by bulls and goats they
[1:39:34] were covered
[1:39:35] their sin was covered but not done away
[1:39:37] with right here this seed of the woman
[1:39:40] is going to do away
[1:39:43] with that serpent with that serpent seed
[1:39:46] that you and i were born with
[1:39:48] and it wasn't a natural seed it's right
[1:39:50] here the carnality of our mind
[1:39:54] paul said the carnal mind is enmity to
[1:39:57] god
[1:39:59] in other words the carnal mind is what
[1:40:01] keeps us from being
[1:40:03] what we're supposed to be wow you say
[1:40:06] well
[1:40:06] no it's this that that's all it is
[1:40:10] it's the carnal mind that said enmity
[1:40:12] with god
[1:40:14] because what's the first thing something
[1:40:15] happens we start thinking
[1:40:19] instead of believing amen
[1:40:23] start trying to work something out but
[1:40:26] now watch what god did god said unto the
[1:40:27] woman
[1:40:29] he said i will greatly multiply thy
[1:40:30] sorrow thy conception he didn't kill her
[1:40:34] in sorrow thou shalt bring forth
[1:40:35] children and thy desire shall be to thy
[1:40:38] husband so
[1:40:40] he's setting up the order because adam
[1:40:42] and eve are going to have some more kids
[1:40:45] they're going to have seth and they're
[1:40:46] going to have all those different
[1:40:48] different kids
[1:40:49] but he's directing eve now the desire is
[1:40:52] to your husband
[1:40:54] and he shall rule over thee and he said
[1:40:56] unto adam because thou has hearkened
[1:40:58] unto the voice of thy wife
[1:41:00] and hath eaten of the tree of which i
[1:41:02] commanded thee saying thou
[1:41:04] shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground
[1:41:07] for thy sake
[1:41:09] and in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all
[1:41:11] the days of thy life
[1:41:12] thorns also and thistle shall it bring
[1:41:14] forth to thee
[1:41:16] and thou shalt
[1:41:19] scroll it on up so i can read it please
[1:41:22] and thou
[1:41:22] shalt eat the herb of the field and the
[1:41:25] sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread
[1:41:26] till thou return unto the ground
[1:41:28] for out of it was not taken for dust
[1:41:31] thou art unto dust thou shall return
[1:41:33] and adam called his wife's name e
[1:41:35] because she was the mother
[1:41:37] of all living remember adam was not the
[1:41:39] father of all living
[1:41:41] the seed that was inside of her one of
[1:41:43] them was from the beast that now was
[1:41:44] totally eradicated he had no more line
[1:41:46] there's no more seed line
[1:41:49] of that beast because what the beast
[1:41:51] seed that you and i have to worry about
[1:41:53] now is the carnality of our mind
[1:41:56] not that somebody was born from an
[1:41:57] animal um
[1:41:59] sorry and adam called his wife's name e
[1:42:02] because she was the mother of all living
[1:42:03] until adam also and to his wife did the
[1:42:05] lord god make coats of skins those
[1:42:07] little fig leaves they made wasn't good
[1:42:08] enough
[1:42:10] and the lord god made coats of skin and
[1:42:11] clothing the lord god said behold the
[1:42:13] man has become one of us
[1:42:15] to know good and evil and now lest he
[1:42:17] put forth his hand to take also
[1:42:19] the tree of life and need and live
[1:42:20] forever so god had to what
[1:42:23] create the division he said
[1:42:26] this is basically what he's telling him
[1:42:28] he said look you go out there and fend
[1:42:30] for yourself i'll be with you
[1:42:32] oh listen adam lived 900 something years
[1:42:35] you know
[1:42:36] he didn't kill him but he died before
[1:42:38] that thousand years was over
[1:42:40] because he started deteriorating and man
[1:42:42] you know we got
[1:42:43] 70 years 80 years and some 90 years
[1:42:45] we're we're
[1:42:46] we're pushing it but but 900 years
[1:42:50] that's a long time you see how strong
[1:42:53] god made that first man and woman though
[1:42:56] and even the next generation down
[1:42:58] through there
[1:42:59] methuselah noah they were six seven
[1:43:02] eight nine hundred years old but god
[1:43:06] cursed the ground so now what they're
[1:43:08] taking from the ground
[1:43:11] is what's killing us but what do we eat
[1:43:14] know now
[1:43:15] if we're eating on the body word of the
[1:43:16] son of man it doesn't matter what this
[1:43:18] guy's going to do
[1:43:20] it's that inside man is what's feeding
[1:43:22] off the word of god
[1:43:23] therefore the lord god sent him forth
[1:43:25] from the garden of eden to till the
[1:43:26] ground for whence he was taken
[1:43:28] so he drove out the man and he placed it
[1:43:31] to east the garden of eden cherubim the
[1:43:33] flaming sword which turned every way to
[1:43:35] keep the way of the tree of life in
[1:43:36] other words
[1:43:38] it blocked adam from getting back in to
[1:43:41] partake of what jesus christ the tree
[1:43:43] but that same tree of life is what came
[1:43:48] on christmas morning in april
[1:43:52] and a little baby that by an immaculate
[1:43:54] conception
[1:43:56] amen has everybody got that same amen
[1:43:58] all right so just keep going
[1:44:00] here's the definition of enmity one of
[1:44:02] them typical mutual hatred or ill will
[1:44:06] we're going to see that in just a minute
[1:44:09] let's look at number eight
[1:44:11] oneness this is one of my favorite
[1:44:14] favorite favorite messages now notice
[1:44:16] this now the woman was not a seed
[1:44:18] therefore he said i will put enmity
[1:44:20] between thy seed and the serpent's seed
[1:44:23] telling her what he was going to do
[1:44:25] himself
[1:44:26] to give her a seed not through an
[1:44:30] intercourse sexually he was going to
[1:44:32] create in her
[1:44:34] a seed listen when you and i get born
[1:44:37] again that's the creative power of god
[1:44:40] satan can't create so he can't give you
[1:44:42] that
[1:44:43] he can give you eternal life but god can
[1:44:45] give you
[1:44:46] his eternal seed life by the baptism of
[1:44:49] the holy ghost satan can't do that and
[1:44:51] he hates it
[1:44:53] well you say would it be his seed yes it
[1:44:55] would belong to mary then
[1:44:57] after he give it to her this is my eye
[1:45:00] he give me this it's my eye but he give
[1:45:02] it to me
[1:45:03] this is my hand he give it to me this is
[1:45:06] my voice but he gave it to me see
[1:45:08] and the seed that was mary had nothing
[1:45:12] to do with mary
[1:45:14] it was something god did himself because
[1:45:16] he promised in genesis
[1:45:17] 3 15. so the seed that was in her then
[1:45:20] was a union of an unlawful act now
[1:45:22] somebody eve
[1:45:24] it's not talking about mary it's not
[1:45:25] about eve
[1:45:27] because he's talking about her own up
[1:45:29] here and he kind of makes this little
[1:45:30] analogy and then he gets back to eve so
[1:45:32] the seed that was in her then was a
[1:45:33] union
[1:45:34] of an unlawful act which was death she
[1:45:37] was already pregnanted with the serpent
[1:45:39] seed
[1:45:40] because she had lived with us she turned
[1:45:41] and said herself the serpent beguiled me
[1:45:43] that's right
[1:45:44] and immediately came come on oh we know
[1:45:47] she said she got a child from god
[1:45:48] certainly every child that's born
[1:45:50] illegitimate or anything else has to
[1:45:51] come by an act of god
[1:45:53] he's the one who can make life certainly
[1:45:55] that is see
[1:45:56] she has already she was all ready to be
[1:45:58] mother and that never only what it did
[1:46:00] was clear up the thing
[1:46:02] of the serpent seed the seed that's in
[1:46:04] you now
[1:46:05] is by concepted your unlawful act
[1:46:08] against my word
[1:46:09] what she went with the beast to a
[1:46:11] natural seed
[1:46:13] right and you got the serpent seed but
[1:46:17] i'll give you a seed by immaculate
[1:46:19] conception
[1:46:20] and his seed shall bruise the serpent's
[1:46:22] head and his head shall bruise the heel
[1:46:24] amen
[1:46:24] just let god have it if it's his word
[1:46:28] he'll bring it to pass amen that's what
[1:46:31] mary said
[1:46:33] you said isaiah 9 6 i just believe what
[1:46:36] you said
[1:46:37] genesis 4 verse 1. now here's the two
[1:46:40] we'll get to the twins right here we'll
[1:46:41] read this and then we'll
[1:46:44] then we'll close and adam knew eva's
[1:46:47] wife
[1:46:48] and she conceived and bear cane and said
[1:46:50] i have gotten a man from the lord now
[1:46:52] you know
[1:46:53] this conception right here was not with
[1:46:56] adam
[1:46:58] adam knew his wife eve we know that
[1:47:00] there's that little
[1:47:01] colon and she conceived and bear cain
[1:47:04] and said i've gotten a man from the lord
[1:47:06] and she again bear his brother abel
[1:47:10] that was from adam we know that and abel
[1:47:12] was the keeper of the sheep but came
[1:47:13] with the tiller of the ground
[1:47:15] and in the process of time it came to
[1:47:17] pass that cain brought of the fruit of
[1:47:19] the ground and offering them to the lord
[1:47:21] and abel he also brought the firstling
[1:47:23] of his flock and of the father of the
[1:47:24] lord had respect and to abel
[1:47:27] and to his offering but in decaying into
[1:47:29] his offering
[1:47:30] he had not respect why he cursed the
[1:47:32] ground it wasn't it was blood
[1:47:34] and cain was very roth and his
[1:47:35] countenance failed now where'd that come
[1:47:36] from that came from that beast side
[1:47:38] that didn't come from god that come from
[1:47:41] the b side that he
[1:47:42] that was that was there with with the
[1:47:44] beast and the lord said in the came why
[1:47:46] aren't thou wroth and why is thy
[1:47:47] countenance falling
[1:47:49] now here is where most people i say a
[1:47:52] lot of message people
[1:47:53] they say cain didn't have a chance he's
[1:47:56] just serpenty
[1:47:59] i just go back read the bible i really
[1:48:02] don't care what they say
[1:48:04] same way with daniel 70 weeks and all
[1:48:05] that other stuff i really don't care
[1:48:06] what people say what does the bible say
[1:48:08] about it
[1:48:09] if thou doest well shalt thou not be
[1:48:13] accepted
[1:48:14] there was his out there was the grace of
[1:48:17] almighty god
[1:48:19] telling him personally not through a
[1:48:20] prophet not to a priest not to a
[1:48:22] preacher
[1:48:25] he talked right to cain and said cain if
[1:48:27] you'll do well
[1:48:29] shalt thou not be accepted
[1:48:32] and if thou doest not well sin lies at
[1:48:35] the door
[1:48:35] he give him a choice and to thee shall
[1:48:38] be his desire and thou shalt rule over
[1:48:39] him and cain talked with abel his
[1:48:41] brother
[1:48:42] now why did cain kill abel cain didn't
[1:48:44] kill abel
[1:48:46] because he didn't like him as far as a
[1:48:48] person
[1:48:50] it was two different opposing doctrines
[1:48:57] hello it was the opposing doctrines is
[1:49:00] what killed
[1:49:01] abel cain says why didn't he just walked
[1:49:05] away from god
[1:49:06] and like brother brown said one time
[1:49:08] cain said here
[1:49:09] here's my sacrifice take it or leave it
[1:49:12] see that's the way the devil would be
[1:49:14] but he talked with abel and it came to
[1:49:16] pass when they were in the field that
[1:49:18] cain rose up against abel his brother
[1:49:21] and slew him
[1:49:25] that murdering just like
[1:49:30] cain and abel we're going to type it a
[1:49:33] little bit later on but they came to
[1:49:34] nicea
[1:49:37] cain and abel
[1:49:40] a true word of god true servants of god
[1:49:43] with the true word of god with the true
[1:49:46] way to sacrifice
[1:49:47] with the true way of the word of god
[1:49:51] and then here sets cain
[1:49:55] cain said no we're not doing your way
[1:49:57] anymore
[1:49:59] we're doing it our way take it or leave
[1:50:02] it
[1:50:03] that's exactly what cain did he was
[1:50:05] sitting there at that table and i seeing
[1:50:06] that cane spirit
[1:50:07] and said this is the way it's going to
[1:50:09] be and i'm going to kill you
[1:50:12] if you don't agree with me
[1:50:16] because right after that what issued in
[1:50:17] the dark ages
[1:50:19] where millions of christians were killed
[1:50:22] because they didn't agree
[1:50:23] with cain's doctrine there at nasa
[1:50:30] let's bring it up a little bit closer
[1:50:32] we'll close right here
[1:50:34] let's bring it up to today
[1:50:39] oh no they don't want to slit your
[1:50:41] throat now maybe someone might want to
[1:50:43] if they can get by with it
[1:50:47] when you set ministers meetings and all
[1:50:49] the different meetings and things and
[1:50:50] you see people that
[1:50:51] literally just get veins popping out of
[1:50:53] their neck you know
[1:50:54] because you don't agree with their
[1:50:56] doctrine
[1:50:58] what kind of spirit is that the spirit
[1:51:00] of god
[1:51:02] spirit king the antichrist spirit that
[1:51:05] works in the children of disobedience
[1:51:07] they're disobedient to the word of god
[1:51:10] amen so that's in the framework of this
[1:51:12] church
[1:51:14] message church that we're talking about
[1:51:15] now that's why i say i
[1:51:17] wanted these two seeds
[1:51:20] look how they came down but look where
[1:51:22] they went to they went to a religious
[1:51:25] gathering at nicaea they didn't go to
[1:51:28] some party
[1:51:30] they didn't bring cain's group from a
[1:51:32] party
[1:51:33] no it was the church the church of the
[1:51:36] day
[1:51:38] the one that constantine said well now
[1:51:40] we'll just change everything over and
[1:51:42] and we'll just give all the power to the
[1:51:44] church and we'll
[1:51:45] build these beautiful buildings and
[1:51:46] we'll go on crusades
[1:51:49] but every bit of that was the devil
[1:51:52] because what did those crusades do
[1:51:53] they walked into a community and they
[1:51:55] said if you don't believe the way we
[1:51:56] believe
[1:51:57] we're going to kill you and they
[1:52:00] martyred them by the millions
[1:52:02] 68 million christians were killed
[1:52:05] 68 million abels were killed because
[1:52:08] they didn't take cain's doctrine
[1:52:10] don't tell me that's not alive today and
[1:52:13] today if you don't preach what people
[1:52:15] want you to preach
[1:52:16] you won't preach in their church anymore
[1:52:19] same thing happens today
[1:52:21] let's read this right here real quick
[1:52:23] and then we'll close i know it's 12
[1:52:25] o'clock but
[1:52:26] you can go home when i get done
[1:52:29] okay and please take a nap
[1:52:32] well no you won't need to
[1:52:36] you've been napping since 10 30.
[1:52:42] sorry notice the exact way the record of
[1:52:45] god sets forth the account of the births
[1:52:47] of cain abel and seth
[1:52:49] this is from the church age book genesis
[1:52:50] 4 1. and adam knew eva's wife and she
[1:52:52] conceived and bear cane and said i've
[1:52:54] gotten a man from the lord
[1:52:55] and she again bear his brother abel
[1:52:57] genesis 4 25 and adam knew his wife
[1:52:59] again
[1:53:00] and she bear a son and called his name
[1:53:02] seth there are three sons
[1:53:04] born from two acts of carnal knowledge
[1:53:07] by adam since the bible is the exact
[1:53:10] and perfect word of god this is no
[1:53:12] mistake but a record
[1:53:13] for our illumination since three sons
[1:53:16] were born from two acts by adam which is
[1:53:19] what abel and seth
[1:53:24] since three sons were born from two acts
[1:53:25] by adam you know positively that one of
[1:53:28] those three
[1:53:29] was not the son of adam see how the
[1:53:31] bible is perfect
[1:53:32] god has recorded this in this exact
[1:53:35] manner to show us something
[1:53:37] the truth of the matter is that eve had
[1:53:39] in her womb
[1:53:41] two sons twins from separate
[1:53:44] impregnations
[1:53:45] she was carrying twins with cain's
[1:53:47] conception sometimes previous to that of
[1:53:49] abel's
[1:53:50] see those twins again perfect type
[1:53:54] as always let's go to the next one
[1:53:57] hearing recognizing and acting 1960.
[1:53:59] whenever there is a revival it always
[1:54:02] produces twins
[1:54:03] that's a rude remark but it's true when
[1:54:06] there is a birth out of from isaac and
[1:54:08] rebecca
[1:54:09] it produced twins when the world was
[1:54:10] created
[1:54:13] you get this when the world was created
[1:54:14] it produced twins not cain and abel two
[1:54:17] trees
[1:54:19] tree of knowledge of good and evil and a
[1:54:20] tree of life when the world was created
[1:54:23] two things came in what satan or lucifer
[1:54:26] and god then you go to cain and abel
[1:54:30] and when cain and abel were born it
[1:54:31] produced twins when ishmael and isaac
[1:54:33] were born it produced two
[1:54:35] when esau and jacob was born it produced
[1:54:37] two one of them
[1:54:38] natural one of them the earth the other
[1:54:40] one supernatural and one looked at the
[1:54:42] natural
[1:54:43] intellectual the other one walked by the
[1:54:45] spirit it's
[1:54:46] always been that way one more and then
[1:54:48] musicians come
[1:54:50] power transformation there is always
[1:54:52] twins
[1:54:54] listen sitting here today is twins when
[1:54:56] you go home there's going to be twins
[1:54:58] your twin that's born by supernatural
[1:55:01] birth and you're the twin that's born by
[1:55:03] natural birth
[1:55:04] everybody got that that's why the
[1:55:06] brother brown said we were born between
[1:55:07] satan and eve
[1:55:09] there's always twins and that's the
[1:55:11] reason don't forget this little flock
[1:55:13] the church in the last days is going to
[1:55:15] be
[1:55:16] twins so close that he'll deceive the
[1:55:19] elected matthew 24 24. see the church is
[1:55:21] going to
[1:55:22] it's a pentecostal move now not
[1:55:24] pentecostal i'm talking about
[1:55:26] pentecostal move
[1:55:28] it is so much like the real thing until
[1:55:29] it would deceive the very elect if
[1:55:31] possible and a little later on if i get
[1:55:33] the chance i won't explain
[1:55:34] what how that election comes see it's
[1:55:37] going to deceive them because it's
[1:55:39] almost like the same thing
[1:55:41] see just two fathers
[1:55:45] same mother
[1:55:49] two fathers that's all same mother same
[1:55:52] church
[1:55:53] same movement same thing the bedding
[1:55:55] ground is the same
[1:55:57] where the word falls but one of them
[1:56:01] like here is perverted you understand
[1:56:03] say amen if you do
[1:56:05] see one of them is a perversion because
[1:56:07] it's the wrong father
[1:56:08] which i will prove someday if god will
[1:56:10] let me that denomination
[1:56:12] is the mark of the beast
[1:56:17] i'm just reading see it's the wrong
[1:56:20] father
[1:56:22] he is stirring people to an organization
[1:56:24] instead of the word
[1:56:27] see it's the wrong father look what it's
[1:56:30] a
[1:56:30] cane movement
[1:56:33] wow it's a cane moon i'm talking about
[1:56:36] here this day right here right now
[1:56:40] there are people good pentecostal people
[1:56:42] there's good baptist people there's good
[1:56:44] methodist people that's good
[1:56:47] but there's going to be a lot of good
[1:56:48] people in hell
[1:56:53] if they're in the wrong brother brown
[1:56:54] said being in the wrong ranks at the
[1:56:55] time of the rapture is no excuse
[1:56:57] musicians come
[1:56:58] there's no excuse
[1:57:02] it being in the wrong ranks of this time
[1:57:05] place today word god
[1:57:08] moving showing us
[1:57:12] that he's here but beware the other
[1:57:15] guy's here too
[1:57:18] and he's going to try to get you just
[1:57:19] one word off
[1:57:21] beautiful sermons
[1:57:25] but just one word off
[1:57:29] folks the twins didn't die with cain and
[1:57:31] abel
[1:57:32] the spirits are still here they still
[1:57:37] walk with you every day they talk with
[1:57:39] you every day
[1:57:40] listen if you're not born again
[1:57:43] that's the only spirit that works on you
[1:57:45] every day until god gets ready and you
[1:57:47] listen to what he has to say let's stand
[1:57:49] our feet
[1:57:50] god bless you
[1:57:55] but folks our deception is not out there
[1:57:58] though
[1:57:59] if you think a father son holy ghost
[1:58:00] baptism is right
[1:58:02] your satan's already got you the fight
[1:58:05] is
[1:58:06] is that you and i the fight that we're
[1:58:07] having is the same fight that cain and
[1:58:10] abel had
[1:58:11] in the garden of eden over doctrine
[1:58:14] doctrine
[1:58:15] doctrines kill you brother brown said
[1:58:17] you kill a man's influence you kill the
[1:58:19] man you don't have to literally kill
[1:58:21] somebody
[1:58:21] just kill their influence amen
[1:58:25] thank god we got a wonderful pastor that
[1:58:27] a lot of people don't like my dad
[1:58:29] because it's a doctrine it's not because
[1:58:31] of it's not because him being a person
[1:58:32] he's the best guy
[1:58:33] known in the world but because of his
[1:58:35] doctrine
[1:58:37] that he stood for which i stand for and
[1:58:39] we stand for
[1:58:40] is not according to a lot of the other
[1:58:42] movements that are going around the
[1:58:43] message and you know what i
[1:58:45] that's okay because there's only going
[1:58:48] to be a little small amount of people
[1:58:49] going to really go
[1:58:50] to the body change really small amount
[1:58:53] so
[1:58:54] but we can do it we can do it
[1:58:58] we've been pressurized for it we've been
[1:59:00] warned of it we've been told
[1:59:02] it's coming we've been told now that
[1:59:03] it's here that the two spirits are
[1:59:06] working in the framework of this message
[1:59:07] church
[1:59:08] look at them now they're trying to even
[1:59:09] the people in the message are
[1:59:12] they're leaving that's a cane movement
[1:59:18] that's a cane movement i think god's not
[1:59:20] moving people away from the message of
[1:59:21] the hour
[1:59:23] lord he's i thought he was driving and
[1:59:24] supposed to be driving us to it
[1:59:26] i thought he was supposed to be you know
[1:59:28] we love revelation
[1:59:30] and all that but we get revelation in
[1:59:31] our due season
[1:59:33] eve thought she got revelation but she
[1:59:35] went out there to get it
[1:59:37] we're just walking right there with god
[1:59:39] what brother brown said he said you
[1:59:40] can't jump from here to here he said
[1:59:42] you'll fall
[1:59:43] he said just let god work these things
[1:59:46] out all the way that's why god's given
[1:59:47] us all this time in our life
[1:59:51] i mean a lot of you probably didn't we
[1:59:52] didn't think that
[1:59:54] well naturally when i was 16 years old
[1:59:57] in 1976 i didn't think i was going to be
[1:59:59] 17 years old
[2:00:00] because you know brother brown was said
[2:00:01] to you know what he said
[2:00:03] which they took wrong people took wrong
[2:00:06] because he wasn't wrong when he said
[2:00:07] what he said about 1977 but we just
[2:00:09] didn't think it was gonna
[2:00:10] i mean we weren't even gonna graduate
[2:00:13] school must let's be standing here with
[2:00:14] grandkids
[2:00:16] right so so but you know what that was
[2:00:19] our carnality
[2:00:21] it was nothing god told us if god told
[2:00:24] us it was gonna be 1977 and that's the
[2:00:26] way it would be
[2:00:27] anybody understand that but god now i
[2:00:29] believe is telling us he's giving us
[2:00:31] the pieces of the puzzle now and fitting
[2:00:34] them together
[2:00:35] for all of us to see don't let it pass
[2:00:38] us by
[2:00:40] don't be like cain and say
[2:00:44] i believe this take it or leave it well
[2:00:46] you know what
[2:00:47] you will probably get left
[2:00:51] because god moves on you will probably
[2:00:54] get left
[2:00:55] all right so god bless you let's sing a
[2:00:58] song if anybody has a need
[2:00:59] continue to pray for brother dale i'm
[2:01:01] staying with him tonight so

[2:01:49] exactly what he

[2:04:11] greater is he that is
[2:04:28] [Music]
[2:04:36] money not for me but something also had
[2:04:39] happened
[2:04:40] uh last year before my sister went back
[2:04:43] to kenya
[2:04:44] and i never gave that testimony so i
[2:04:46] felt well
[2:04:48] maybe i need to start testifying
[2:04:51] it might encourage anybody somebody but
[2:04:53] it's not for me
[2:04:55] um i'll start with yesterday
[2:04:59] yesterday at home you know just a usual
[2:05:01] saturday you may sit down if you want to
[2:05:04] just a usual saturday and
[2:05:08] you know normally it was raining i had
[2:05:10] plan i had planned to
[2:05:11] plant my college but it rained so much i
[2:05:14] said i'll do that another time
[2:05:16] so i kept uh i stayed upstairs you know
[2:05:19] doing my work
[2:05:20] and taking care of the kids but and but
[2:05:22] anderson
[2:05:23] i don't know out of nowhere he decided
[2:05:27] we had bought some racks these huge
[2:05:29] rocks
[2:05:30] probably three months ago and they were
[2:05:32] sitting in the carport
[2:05:35] and the plan was we took out all of our
[2:05:38] because i
[2:05:38] we have a lot of clothes david's clothes
[2:05:40] sarah's clothes
[2:05:41] that we were trying to see if we can
[2:05:43] give out or take them to goodwill
[2:05:45] so i just put them out in the carport
[2:05:47] because the cup would have a lot of room
[2:05:49] but anderson said well if if you think
[2:05:53] you want to give them out
[2:05:54] let's buy these racks and i'll set it
[2:05:57] set them up in the attic
[2:05:58] and then we can put them up there but i
[2:06:01] took too long to get
[2:06:03] to work on that because i thought i'll
[2:06:04] ask a few people who need some
[2:06:06] children's clothes
[2:06:07] before i put them up there but those
[2:06:09] rocks
[2:06:10] they've been sitting in the carport
[2:06:12] almost three four months
[2:06:13] and out of nowhere he decided he'll walk
[2:06:17] on them
[2:06:18] on the rocks and i'm sorry i keep
[2:06:21] getting so emotional i don't know why
[2:06:24] anyway he decided he'll walk on the
[2:06:26] rocks
[2:06:27] and just put him in the basement just he
[2:06:29] thought he'd do one
[2:06:31] and then he said two and then he said
[2:06:33] all of them three of them
[2:06:35] and then and he normally has a class on
[2:06:38] saturdays from
[2:06:40] one to four i think he kept it running
[2:06:43] while he was just fixing them
[2:06:44] fixing up the racks so he did that and
[2:06:47] then he took
[2:06:48] everything that was on the floor and put
[2:06:50] it on the rocks
[2:06:52] we woke up in the morning the basement
[2:06:54] is flooded
[2:06:56] flooded i've never seen i i never knew
[2:07:00] what flooding is i remember the brother
[2:07:03] here brother
[2:07:05] forbu she said his basement flooded but
[2:07:07] i've never i've never witnessed what a
[2:07:09] flooding a basement is
[2:07:11] so we woke up i saw uh
[2:07:15] he woke up a little earlier than me at
[2:07:16] five and i didn't know
[2:07:18] david we had a rough night with david
[2:07:20] staying up i was staying up with him
[2:07:23] um so the basement was flooded and
[2:07:26] he had put everything up on the rugs
[2:07:30] yesterday not knowing and you know he's
[2:07:33] so busy
[2:07:34] and i don't know what made him do that
[2:07:38] just put everything up other than one
[2:07:40] box and
[2:07:42] the one box was i think for trash oh
[2:07:44] what he had gathered is trash
[2:07:46] just left the only thing that got
[2:07:48] damaged is a mattress that
[2:07:49] we had it on a wall that was the only
[2:07:51] thing that was not on a
[2:07:53] so we woke up man i didn't know what
[2:07:56] flooding is and it had
[2:07:57] zipped in the carpet is wet the boards
[2:07:59] are wet
[2:08:01] so you know we call the landlord and
[2:08:05] we have to go to laws that buy the that
[2:08:08] vac thing that sucks the water out
[2:08:10] but i i wondered all that time they've
[2:08:13] been sitting there
[2:08:15] and then all of a sudden yesterday he
[2:08:17] felt he needs just to do that
[2:08:19] i thought that was something
[2:08:24] anyway now last year i had this
[2:08:27] we witnessed something and i should have
[2:08:29] testified
[2:08:31] so when this happened today i said i
[2:08:32] have to go testify
[2:08:34] now last year before you all know that
[2:08:37] mary went back to kenya
[2:08:40] and before she went and it's you know
[2:08:42] living on the uh
[2:08:44] she she was to be very comfortable back
[2:08:45] home as a veteran
[2:08:48] getting all her monthly check and it
[2:08:51] would go way better back home
[2:08:54] but mary's had she's been struggling a
[2:08:56] lot and
[2:08:57] hi and my brother and my mother last
[2:08:59] year around
[2:09:01] june may june they went to texas
[2:09:05] and we didn't know she's been i think
[2:09:08] she either took her medication wrong her
[2:09:10] pst
[2:09:12] you know postpartum you know the
[2:09:14] post-war thing
[2:09:15] depress those medications she took them
[2:09:18] wrong that's what she said
[2:09:20] and it made her act so
[2:09:23] wacky abnormal on that trip in a way
[2:09:26] that when they came back from texas
[2:09:29] she took her purse with her car keys and
[2:09:32] everything
[2:09:32] threw it over the window and they were
[2:09:35] almost like two hours
[2:09:36] into georgia they had a very hard time
[2:09:39] with her
[2:09:40] trying to contain her because she just
[2:09:41] wanted to hit the windows everything
[2:09:44] but they made it through her and my
[2:09:46] mother and my brother but they told me
[2:09:48] you know what
[2:09:48] we somewhere after we crossed the
[2:09:50] georgia alabama line
[2:09:52] she too opened the window to cuppas and
[2:09:54] just threw it and it's dark we don't
[2:09:56] know where it
[2:09:56] landed the car keys everything house
[2:09:59] keys they're all in the past
[2:10:01] i said oh my goodness now what do we do
[2:10:03] so the next day
[2:10:05] i decided i'll look up because i asked
[2:10:08] my brother how far
[2:10:09] are you about two hours so i said i'll
[2:10:10] call the villa rica police station
[2:10:13] you know coming up douglasville is there
[2:10:15] any purse that has been reported missing
[2:10:17] you know found on the road no purse no
[2:10:20] purse
[2:10:22] and i thought well let me call her ben
[2:10:24] because her bank card is in there her
[2:10:25] army cards are in there
[2:10:27] let me call the bank the bank couldn't
[2:10:28] help me because she has to be the one to
[2:10:30] call now by the time they got home
[2:10:33] rebecca who is an lpn decided to call
[2:10:36] the police and take her to the hospital
[2:10:38] because she was fighting the police had
[2:10:40] to come and
[2:10:41] take her to the hospital to cut to
[2:10:42] wellster in in australia because my
[2:10:45] my sister lives in douglasville so she
[2:10:48] couldn't
[2:10:49] uh we couldn't deal uh talk to her about
[2:10:52] her purse or anything what do we do
[2:10:54] what do we do with the bank she could
[2:10:55] she was not there to do that
[2:10:57] so i just told my brother you know i'll
[2:10:59] forget about the purse
[2:11:00] and the bank now the per um i mean i
[2:11:03] forget about the bank issues and the
[2:11:06] credit cards and everything i wouldn't
[2:11:07] worry about that now the car keys and
[2:11:10] the purse it has everything of her you
[2:11:13] know her life her documents
[2:11:15] i told my mom well i've called the
[2:11:16] police stations there's no past reported
[2:11:19] what i'll do i told mom now i don't know
[2:11:21] what else to do but this is what i'll do
[2:11:23] mom and i told her over the phone
[2:11:25] i will pray that god will bring the
[2:11:28] person
[2:11:29] to her apartment to her door and i said
[2:11:32] you know i'll just pray that and forget
[2:11:34] about it
[2:11:35] and that's i remember one morning or the
[2:11:38] following morning i woke up it was
[2:11:39] around 5am
[2:11:40] i just knelt down i prayed god
[2:11:44] we don't know what to do but you take
[2:11:46] that purse to the
[2:11:47] doorstep her apartment complex right to
[2:11:50] the door
[2:11:51] because anybody anybody would have
[2:11:53] picked it up you know some
[2:11:55] picked it up that you know or fell in a
[2:11:57] ditch somewhere
[2:12:00] tell you what so she went to the
[2:12:01] hospital stayed three days came back
[2:12:03] home
[2:12:04] i don't even know how they got into the
[2:12:06] apartment she lives in a
[2:12:08] gated gated complex so i think the the
[2:12:11] guy at the uh front desk opened the door
[2:12:14] i don't know how they got it but anyway
[2:12:18] three days later she gets a call from
[2:12:21] the gate because you cannot just come in
[2:12:23] you have to get to the gate
[2:12:25] she says uh there's somebody here an old
[2:12:27] couple here and they want to see you
[2:12:30] she said oh okay what is it about and
[2:12:32] they need to go because they're driving
[2:12:34] to florida
[2:12:36] and they have your purse here i said oh
[2:12:38] my
[2:12:39] god she said oh really okay let me come
[2:12:43] down so she went down
[2:12:44] i think when she got there they were
[2:12:46] gone it was a couple from
[2:12:48] kansas they were driving to florida
[2:12:51] and i think i don't know how they were
[2:12:52] on 75 they took a pass
[2:12:55] took the driver's license in the in the
[2:12:57] wallet drove to that address
[2:13:00] dropped there and went on
[2:13:04] so i told my mom now
[2:13:08] you see what you remember three days ago
[2:13:10] i told you
[2:13:11] how pretty it be taken to her doorstep
[2:13:14] and why not for that you know security
[2:13:17] guard at the
[2:13:18] at the complex they probably would have
[2:13:20] walked right to the doorstep
[2:13:23] so and you pray for my mother because
[2:13:25] what came to my mind at that time is my
[2:13:27] mother is
[2:13:28] she she knows the message but she's
[2:13:31] backslidden
[2:13:33] and i told my husband probably this was
[2:13:35] for my mother
[2:13:37] to say and if you can pray for her just
[2:13:39] pray for us
[2:13:40] oh but that testimony really
[2:13:43] shook me and i said you know i need to
[2:13:45] trust god in everything and
[2:13:47] praying just trust god and not worry
[2:13:50] about you don't have to work anything
[2:13:52] out and
[2:13:53] just pray and let it go but that really
[2:13:55] touched me
[2:14:02] simple faith that's all it takes just
[2:14:04] simple faith
[2:14:07] that purse
[2:14:12] think of the odds of throwing it out in
[2:14:14] a major interstate
[2:14:18] and slinging it god knows where well he
[2:14:21] did
[2:14:23] but then have enough to work on the
[2:14:26] other end
[2:14:28] did you notice it was an older couple
[2:14:31] more seasoned knew the importance of the
[2:14:34] purse
[2:14:35] maybe an 18 year old picked it up and
[2:14:37] they run through it and throw it back
[2:14:39] over the river or something but an older
[2:14:41] couple
[2:14:42] that was traveling god just spoke to him
[2:14:45] and said
[2:14:46] there's a purse right there
[2:14:49] one of my kids dropped her purse out out
[2:14:51] the window how about picking it up and
[2:14:53] taking it to the house for
[2:14:54] amen let's stand our feet that's god
