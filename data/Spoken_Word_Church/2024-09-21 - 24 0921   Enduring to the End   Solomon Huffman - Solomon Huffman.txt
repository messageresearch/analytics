changing method that the prophet taught us that when God wants to do something he uses his word amen so no matter what you have need of this evening I believe with all my heart heart that God can change it by the power of His word amen there's not a need too great there's not a problem too great that our God cannot solve just by the power of His word we just want to go to the Lord in a word of prayer uh before we look to the word and uh maybe if you have a need upon your heart you want to lift your hand up to the Lord and and ask the Lord to come by your way I I believe we're in a special place tonight uh whenever we're gather together in his presence a supernatural can happen lives can be changed Hearts can be touched and uh I believe that he's made a way that we can touch him so let's just bow our heads and hearts together and have a word of prayer Lord Jesus we come to your throne of grace and mercy Lord and how we love to assemble together in your name and Lord we know that you gave us a promise in your word that where two or three will gather together in that name that you'll be here and Lord we believe with all of our hearts that we're a supernatural God is as the supernatural things take place and Lord we just invite you to come Lord and and to walk up and down the aisles and avenues of our hearts and speak to us Lord the things that we have need of Lord no doubt there's people in here that may be discouraged or going through things or battling things but Lord we know that there's not a need too great that you can't answer father there is not a sickness too great that you can't heal and so Lord we're just inviting your presence to come Lord and to to minister Like Only You Can Do Lord the the ability of man will only go so far Lord but we believe that you have a inexhaustible ability to meet every need that we've got so Lord we just invite you to come Lord I pray that you'd help me to get out of your way and help your children Lord to to get out of your way also Lord may you anoint our ears anoint our hearts Lord to hear and receive the word that we have need of Lord we just give you this service and Lord when the final amen is said we'll be sure that we give you and you alone all the glory and the honor and the praise it's in the Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen if you have your Bibles we'll read here in the scripture together in the book of Hebrews in the sixth chapter we'll begin reading at the 13th verse and also in the Book of Romans and the 8th chapter I don't know if you have any monitor here my voice is kind of weak so whatever you all can do to to help that's a lot of help right there down just a little bit that's good thank you amen do you love the Lord tonight amen how many come expecting to hear something from the Lord amen I believe what the prophet said he said that Jesus would never disappoint us so uh no matter what you need if you just expect it you know uh the prophet taught so much on expectation he said if you're expecting to find something to criticize he said the devil will show you something every single time you'll find something to be critical about if you want to but if you're coming uh to God and saying Lord I need you to do something in my life then the prophet said then God will always meet that expectation no matter what and so we just believe that and uh we just want to bring you greetings uh this evening also before we read the word and uh we bring you greetings from our pastor brother Josh Bennett back in North Carolina brother Tim and brother Richard and the different Ministry you all are acquainted with and they wanted to be sure and greet you and we just appreciate brother Wade and the invitation to come and uh we count on a great blessing to speak to you tonight but uh we want to read here in the word together and uh Hebrews the sixth chapter we begin reading at the 13th verse the Bible would read this for when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swore by himself amen what a promise saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and I want you to notice something very powerful in this 15th verse and so after he had patiently endured so there's a there's a a patience that Abraham is having to have after he patiently endured he obtained the promise let's read also in the Book of Romans the 8th chapter very familiar scripture to us Romans 8 28 amen I believe this is one of them what you call refrigerator magnet scriptures but it's exactly uh the truth and it's very encouraging uh to the believer Romans 8:28 for we know that all things amen you need to say that to yourself all things so that covers what that cover covers all things we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the first born born among many Brethren and moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified amen we just ask that God will bless his word as you can be seated and uh if I would take a subject I want to speak to you this evening on enduring Until the End Amen enduring until the end and there's many uh scriptures and places that you read about enduring here in one place in Mark 13 and 13 uh Jesus speaking here he said and ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but he shall that endure and the end the same shall be saved and and you'll find many scriptures that speaks about enduring so we know uh that it's not about who has started the race we can all look back in the past and say there there's been a lot of young people that started off there's been a lot of people that were uh used to be here but they're not here anymore and there's a lot of people that start off uh uh living for the Lord and and and and and coming to church and living a good and Sanctified life but see it's not all just about uh the ones that have started this but see it's about the on that end or it's about the ones that endure until the end and that's what Jesus is saying here he said but he that will endure until the end the same shall be saved and another place here in the scripture in 2 Thessalonians 2:9 the Bible would read this wherein I suffer trouble as an evildoer even unto bonds but the word of God is not bound and therefore I Endure all things for for the elect's sake that they may also obtain the Salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal amen so there's many places as you read uh especially in the New Testament that you hear about enduring in many scriptures you could read about that another place Paul would say that I press toward the mark of the High Calling of Christ so uh you'll find it's almost a principal theme of the scripture that uh we're not in a picnic but we're in a battle and we're in a war and we're in a fight we can all agree that uh the Christian Life it's not just a flowery bed of ease but but every single person in here we had to fight to be here tonight we we did we didn't just get here because it was easy but we got here because we pressed out and came to the house of God and you'll find that the Christian Life that's going to it's always going to be a fight and it's always going to be a press and there's many tapes that you could turn to and find that brother brand would title a lot of sermons and talk about perseverance and talk about uh and end during and and things of that sort he would he would preach many sermons talking about being persevering and if you take that word being perseverant it's something that's in you that that there's just no give up on the inside of you that no matter what you face or no matter uh what you're coming against you're going to persevere and you're going to fight and keep on going and and you know brother Brandon would preach a lot of sermons with them specific titles and persevering and a lot of them slip me at the moment but I was just reading about uh the different sermon titles that the prophet would talk about and you come to find out that the Christian Life it is a life of War it's a life of fighting it's a life of uh uh struggling it's a life of pressing it's a life of enduring and you know it's amazing because we could take all of these words and describe our walk with the Lord and to The Outsider we would say well I'd never want to be a Christian then if there if you've got to fight you've got to endure you got to be perseverant you've got to be persistent you've got to to do all them things it sounds like a lot of hard work amen and to this flesh it would seem like a lot of hard work and you know I wish I could stand here as a gospel preacher in the end time and and prophesy and tell you that that your life is just going to be sunshine and rainbows and it's all going to be easy and it's all it's always just going to be a bunch of Flowery bed of EAS but I'm not able to do that because the Bible never tells us that our life is going to be just a flowery bed of ease or our life is going to be easy but see what the scripture did say is that I'll be with you I'll be even in you all the way until the end of the world so I can't stand here and preach to you and tell you that your life is always going to be easy but I can stand here with full assurity on God's word and tell you that God is a God that will never fail you and he's a God that will be with you even in you every single battle that you think you fight by yourself you're not fighting that thing alone but God is with you even in you it's exactly the truth we're we're not here to prophesy that everything's going to be easy but we can prophesy that God is on our side and that God will be with us and I think it's amazing how God does things and we can all agree on that because there in the book of Isaiah 558 the the prophet speaking there he would say my thoughts they're not your thoughts we can all agree on that my thoughts are not your thoughts and neither are my ways your ways amen how many's ever been there and say God I would have never done it this way or or I would have never thought it would have been this way of course you wouldn't because God's ways they are not your ways and God's thoughts they're not your thoughts amen and I'm glad I'm not God and I'm glad you're not God because you probably wouldn't have chose me and I probably wouldn't have chose you but see that comes down to the almighty election of God and it's election by for knowledge see amen God knew that there would be a germ seed of life on the inside of you and that's the reason he could choose you and elect you before the foundation of this world was ever laid because he knew there was a seed of representation on the inside of you amen amen and as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts we know that God does things in unique ways and God allows us to go through things he allows us to go through battles ain't it amazing that God has all powerful as he is and as Almighty he is and he created the whole earth that you and I live on and in your mind sometimes when you're in the heath of the battle and you're having to do what we're preaching about you're having to endure and then you just sit back and think a moment you know God in just one word he could speak this whole situation out of existence and he could speak this whole battle out of existence but see God did not do that and and here's the reason why because God he's more concerned about your character than he is your comfort God is not always worried hey are you comfortable are you is it easy are you okay The Way It Is God is not concerned about that because God wants you to be ready for a Rapture listen God is not concerned about us being a comfortable church but he's concerned about us being a church full of the character of Jesus Christ listen we're not here to be comfortable brother and sister we are here to have character fit to rule that's exactly the truth amen you'll find that God lets us go through things and God lets us uh uh go through humiliating battles and humiliating trials but see many times it takes humiliation in your life to bring amen a testimony out of it ain't that right many times you or not many times but every single time every time God has given you a test it's not to hurt you it is not to it ain't because God is mad at you and ain't because God how many's ever prayed for God to deliver you out of something just a couple people man I guess y'all don't battle a whole lot of stuff around Georgia I'm all the time saying God deliver me from this God deliver me from this we all brother not a single one of us in here likes going through trials and likes going through these things amen but see what you've got to realize is that you cannot have a testimony unless you have a test Hallelujah you am me you can't have a testimony that you can share with somebody unless you have went through something now listen you've got to learn to to Glory through the tribulation and Glory through the testing and know this brother sister that when God gets done trying you you're going to come forth as precious gold that is tried in the fire listen listen everything you're ever going to go through it is not because God is upset at you but it's because God is molding you and he's shaping you into the person that he wants you to be so don't you ever think that that God you must hate me to let me go through this no it's quite the opposite God loves you and and those that are sons of God they will be chastised of God and that's exactly right and a son can withstand chastisement amen amen that's exactly right a daughter can withstand chastisement because we're of God we can stand it amen let me tell you this God knows what you can stand even if you don't amen the Bible is clear on that that God will not tempt a man more that he can or he'll not allow you to have more battles or or more Temptation than what you're able to Bear amen sometimes it seem like you're getting all the way out real Lord are you are you sure that I can bear this but but see God knows something about you that that you're not even aware listen God knows that there is a seed on the inside of you brother and sister and you may not know it and the church may not know it but God knows those who that is own and he knows that the seed that's in you it will prevail 100% of the time listen this flesh May Fail and this Spirit May Fail but there is a seed Gene of God on the inside of you and it don't matter what the devil throws your way brother sister amen that that seed that's on the inside of you it will prevail every time that's exactly right it can endure it amen we're here to endure and and it's amazing because you see these things in the scripture that there can be so much bad and so much humiliation but somehow at the end of it all it's going to work together for your good and see what the devil wants you to do as the Church of the Living God is he always wants to point your eyes on what's not good right the pastor wants to point his eyes on uh the devil wants your pastor to point his eyes on the problems in the church the problems in this person he always wants your focus to be on issues a and problems and and well this is not good and that's not good and see he always wants your focus to be on that so he can keep you discouraged but see you have to always remind yourself what the Bible said God never said everything would be good but he did say it would work together for my good he never said it would be easy on me but he did say it would work together for my good and sometimes you're going through something as a young person and you're saying God why are you allowing this to happen to me and why are you allowing this battle and this struggle and this battle and I ask you to to deliver me out of the trial and I'm still in it and I ask you for this and I'm still in it see You' got to learn how to change that prayer a little bit because God sometimes he don't just say oh sure I'll just pull you out of the fire listen God never promised to pull you out of the fire but he did say I will be with you in the fire don't you realize if God wanted to he could pull you out of anything you're in right now but see God don't always work the way you want him to work it's because he wants there to be a testimony listen when you sing on Sunday morning God wants you to know what you're singing about when you lift your hands on Sunday morning God wants you to know what you're lifting your hands about listen there ain't a better praise in the lips of a person that's been through a battle and seen the mighty hand of God come down and deliver them out of it see that's why God allows you to go through something so you can say God I know you as healer I know you as deliverer I know you as Savior listen you've got to learn to to endure hardness you got to endure the difficulties because at the end of it God will get the glory out of it that's exactly right y'all all remember the man that was blind and they came to Jesus and asked him they said Jesus why was this man born blind was it was it because the his sins was it because the sin of his parents or was it because the the sin of his grandparents y'all y'all remember the the story in the scripture and Jesus said it wasn't because he was a sinner it wasn't because he did anything wrong I want you to hear me it wasn't because he did anything wrong or his parents did anything wrong but the reason this man was born blind was that the glory of God could be made manifest through this person he said preacher why am I going through what I'm going through was it because of something I did was it because of something my parents did it may not be any of that but it could be but see it could be that God he just wants to get Glory out of your life he wants to use you as an example to show you that God can still deliver them that are oppressed and God can deliver them that are bound and sometimes you get so caught up why am I in this why am I going through this but you've got to realize God I don't know how but you're going to get the glory out of this situation God why is this happening maybe because God wants to get the glory out of the situ you're going through praise the Lord amen everything will work together for the good to them that love God and the prophet talks about it in the message I know because he says we ask God for comfort and peace how many's ever asked for that we ask God for comfort and peace and I want you to listen because the prophet says and God gives us the best that he could what's the best with the song how he wants to know what the best he could give you trials and tribulations amen what yeah the best God could get we ask for comfort and peace and God gives us did you read that right I read it right I'll give you the quote later trials and tribulations that's the best thing God could give you listen my sister I don't know if you realize but this flesh is sorry this flesh don't want to worship God this flesh don't want to come to church this flesh brother it likes the easy way it likes the comfortable it likes the church to be seven Dees precisely or we're going to be all upset and his flesh likes it to be just a specific and perfect way and the prophet's saying here he said we ask God for comfort and peace and God gives us the best he could give us he gives us trials and tribulations he says and that's better than comfort and peace he said see our comfort is just beyond the river so the prophet's taking your comfort and saying if you want to be comfortable this ain't no place for it if you want to be relaxed this is not the place for it he said our comfort amen our us being comfortable is just be on the river listen Church let's not get stagnant and comfortable in the house of God but let's realize hey we're not here to be comfortable we're in a war and we're in a battle and we got to fight we've got to fight for everything we've got we're not here just for just for I am a comfort and easy going and Easy Living see that's what this L to seeing lukewarm has got a bunch of Easy Living and see the devil wants to push the same thing upon the church and say just take it easy you know just do your religious Duty on Sunday morning you and you'll be fine you you just come on you you realize the devil's okay with you being in church he comes to church every service he comes to church more than some folks do the devil's okay with you coming to the house of God but as long as he can keep you comfortable and relax and you're just sitting there and you're hearing the song leader sing and you're hearing the preacher preach A good sermon amen see the devil is fine with that but see you've got to you got to get a little bit of grit about you sometimes and say I'm not here to be comfortable but I'm here to endure and I'm here to fight through amen just this comfortable Easy Living that the devil's trying to bring listen brother sister you got to press through this flesh Amen to really enter into worship and to enter into a service you got to press Beyond this flesh that's exactly what Christ taught Amen to the woman at the well he said listen the hour is coming that them that worship me will worship me in spirit and in Truth Listen brother sister a true service where God is moving and blessing you is when you break out of being comfortable and you break out of just being stagnant that's exactly right amen Abraham the Bible he was humiliated and he had to endure amen could you imagine praying for something and believing for something for 25 something years I don't know about you all but sometimes I pray about it two times and just forget about it but see Abraham wasn't that way Abraham he prayed and prayed and believed and believed and brother for years and years and years he knew by the way that God made him a promise Abraham through your loins I'm going to give you a son I I I I'm going to I'm I'm going to bring a great Victory through you and Abraham is here with a promise of God and what does he have to do with that promise brother and sister he has to endure with it amen he has to endure see he got his testimony right and he said glory to God God's going to give us a Child G glory to God Sarah's going to get pregnant glory to God and see the prophet said something very beautiful about Abraham because he went ahead and testified of it before he even saw any evidence Oh Glory before he even saw any evidence before she actually conceived Abraham was already testifying of what God was going to do and he had to bear that reproach of me he had to endure people saying Abraham you you're just you don't have a child Abra Abraham listen you're old and she's old and Abraham brother he he he just he kept his head down and he endured he said I don't care what you say I don't care what you say I'm going to endure until I see the Promise made manifest amen see he didn't give up on God's promises and listen I believe I'm looking at Sons and Daughters of Abraham here this evening and listen you may have prayed one time I think it's time you pray again you may have prayed for years and years I think it's time that you pray again and you endure and say listen if it ain't tomorrow I'm looking for it the next day hey if God didn't give up on us why should we give up on his word amen God gave us his promise but he sometimes you got to endure see the scripture says though the vision tar do what wait for it though The Vision T though it seems like God is lingering sometimes you got to wait for it a little bit amen let me tell you you keep on praying for deliverance you keep on praying for the victory amen and I'll tell you eventually brother and sister it may not be tomorrow it may not be next week but Victory will come amen Deliverance will come but no matter what your need is it will come as long as you Ure the hardness as long as you endure the suffering and say God I know the mountain ain't moving but I'm believing that the mountain will move amen amen see that's got to be our attitude we've got to constantly endure and fight endure and fight amen Paul amen he he was a man that had to endure he was a man that had to get everything that he knew he was a man that was willing to be humiliated he was a man that was willing to be amen uh below amen lowered down compared to where he was and he said there in the scripture he said yay Dallas I count all things as lost except for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord my my amen the humiliation then God brings it and brings a testimony and brings glorification out of it see brother sister we just have to we've got to learn sometimes to endure the battle and endure the trial endure whatever you're going through sometimes you've just got to you've got to be ready to ride out the storm listen I wish I could tell you that God will deliver you out of it but I can't do that brother sister but I'll tell you about a God that will never leave you he'll never forsake you all you've got to do is call on him when you're in the middle of the situation we serve a God that you can call on him and say God I I need your strength Str to carry on he is a present help in a time of trouble listen he may not just amen do a miracle and deliver you immediately out of it but I'm telling you God can give you the strength you need to go through something that's exactly right amen there's many places we could go but for the sake of time I'm not going to go in many areas in this but amen it was Daniel and the Lion's Den it was the three Hebrew children they endured all the way up until the end he man ain't it so powerful how God does things that he'll let things brother in your life he'll let them get so bad he'll let things get so horrible that you'll literally be me being thrown into the fiery furnace and you're thinking where is God right now where where where is the Lord where is his presence where is deliverance and see sometimes God will let you endure all the way to the very end of the road and then you'll find the force man in the fire hallelujah amen sometimes you'll be all the way into the lion's den and you say devil I'm not going to Bow I'm not going to stop serving God and you'll be all the way into the worst Battle of your life and then you'll find the glory of God and you'll find the presence of God but see listen amen the three Hebrew children would have never saw the fourth man if they did not endure through the battle amen Abraham would have never saw his Isaac unless he endured through the battle and listen you won't ever see your Victory unless you endure through the battle I say church it's time that let let's just hold steady and endure and we'll see the glory of God we'll see the blessings of God we'll see the testimony from God how would we see it unless we endure Hallelujah the prophet talks about in that same quote he said it was until the Hebrew CH was forced into the fiery fer or a fiery furnace that one of them that he said they was in their most outstanding trial that they seen one like unto the son of man he said their troubles I want you to listen to this their troubles produce the Son of God their troubles produced the son of God standing among them and he was there to breee and to wave away the heat wave he said but it was not until they went into the fire that the comforter did appear amen and sometimes brother and sister you're in the middle of the fire but sometimes it's because that's when that God wants to reveal himself to you listen how could you know him as a comforter unless you ever received a big disturbance in your life or turmoil how could you know God is a savior unless You' been loost listen you'll come to find out that God knows what he's doing and he know what you can handle and he know what you can't handle listen he may give you one battle and he may give me one battle and you may have it way worse than I have it or I may have it way worse than you have it but no matter what God knows what he's doing but it's up to us to endure it see the scripture says in 2 Corinthians 4:17 I love what Paul I I I just like a man of of courage and git like this he said our light Affliction you ever in the middle of a battle you say it's light Affliction no our light Affliction which is but one honest man right here our light Affliction is but for a moment our light Affliction now listen you're talking about a man that's been Shipwrecked a man that's been locked in prison amen a man that has been laughed at and scorned at and Paul is right here I've been Shipwrecked and this has happened I've been put in prison and this has happened and this has happened and Paul says listen our lot affliction which is just for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory amen listen next time you're in a real bad battle I want you to remember this scripture this is a light Affliction Hallelujah this is a light Affliction whenever you're really going through something amen I love what Paul does because amen normally we like to cater to the flesh somebody says how you doing brother you just don't even know you don't know how bad I've got it and sometimes you wish you just didn't even ask you say sister how you doing you just don't know what I've been through at school and you just don't know the the trials and the troubles and this and this see Paul wasn't a man like that amen Paul had been through a lot of battles but you never even heard about me amen am me a lot of the worst battles he been through we probably never even heard about and Paul is never complaining and he's never being grumpy about it he says all lot affliction which is just for a moment it's working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight and glory amen I just love what he does here brother Rob because he takes away all excuses and he don't cater to your flesh because when we get down and we get low we want a pat on the back listen it's going to be okay you you you just hang on for a while but Paul ain't doing that Paul said listen you're in a light Affliction and this light Affliction is just for a moment and it's not going to stay this way amen I need you to help me preach just for a moment now amen tell the person beside you it's a light Affliction it's a light Affliction the person beside you it's a light Affliction but what about this amen how many's ever been Shipwrecked raise your hand wow how many's ever been well I want to ask that maybe we got some good testimonies in here KN that I want to ask you you've been to prison and if you have him praise the Lord for taking you out of there also amen but we could all compare our battles and compare our Tri with what Paul had went through and we could look at all of these Avenues but see amen Paul never catered to that he said we're in line Affliction amen listen Paul learned one thing he said he learned one thing no matter what I'm going through I've got to learn to endure it amen I've got to learn to endure what I'm facing amen I want to encourage you here today no matter what you're going through I want you to remember you've got to endure it amen you've got to endure whatever the battle is amen it's amazing because you read there in the Old Testament you find uh Joseph we know the prophet talked a lot of things about Joseph he was a perfect type of Christ except the one scratch he had on him and Joseph he's such a a beautiful testimony of all things working together for the good because this is a man brother sister amen he had been through so many troubles he had done and he he's not living a backsliding life life he's not doing the wrong thing but he's going to prison and he amen he runs away from pifer's wife and gets thrown into the prison again and he's made a slave in the land of Egypt amen and and he would go up and down and up and down and Joseph would fight so many battles and then at the end of her brother sister he's all the way to a position of authority he's in a powerful position and his brothers come to him and he ask him does my father live and then he asked him we we all know the story in the Bible and then they go back and go get Benjamin and so forth and then Joseph comes and he goes to reveal himself to his Brethren and then he he begins to reveal and says I'm Joseph your brother and then they got so afraid and so scared and I love what but I I love what Joseph said in the Bible he said don't be angry with yourselves don't be upset with yourselves because God did this to preserve life amen look at the the the character that was so molded in the Joseph you realize young people amen Joseph could to said listen you look at how look at how great I am and you're coming to me for him now look who's the tough guy but see he had been through so many trials and troubles that there was such a character that was molded into him that when the opportunity to portray Christ arose he did not portray Joseph because all of Joseph had been squeezed and molded out of him but he said don't be mad at yourselves don't don't be upset at yourselves but God did this to preserve life amen so when you're in a trial you got to look yourself in the mirror and say who did this God did this hallelujah amen when you're going through one of the worst storms of life you got to look in the mirror and say God did this to me amen it was God that did this it was God that allowed this God the same God that stopped the son he he could have stopped this but he didn't do it don't be angry and don't be upset because God did this hallelujah amen listen you you study and you find out that Joseph was a slave for actually about 13 years he was in prison or in the land of Egypt as a slave for 13 years and I think it's amazing because sometimes there ain't a way around that sometimes there ain't a way to avoid them 13 years sometimes you've got to go through the 13 years of testing and trial and testing and TR yeah and you think I thought you was trying to encourage us I am very much listen my sister the only way you could be where Joseph was amen people are F say look at Joseph and look how he's such an overcomer and he's such a blessing to the church and he's this and he's this but you don't know what it took you don't know what it took to get Joseph from being a boy that was sold by his brothers in a pit all the way Amen to the right hand of pharaoh what did it take it took a man enduring it took a man that was persistent and persevering he would lay in the prison and say God I'm not giving up God I'm not going to stop God I'm not giving up Do You Realize Joseph could have went and begin to serve the gods that were down in Egypt but he did not do it amen he remained his heart on God and he said God if I'm in the prison I'm still a Christian if I'm in the schoolhouse I'm still a Christian I'm going to endure hardness I'm going to endure pure pressure I'm going to endure the schoolhouse and keep my testimony positive I say God give us some young people like Joseph listen let me tell you very clearly amen your surroundings they don't have to change who you are if you get a true Born Again experience with almighty god listen you can put yourself in the college in the schoolhouse no matter where you put yourself and you will be a Christian no matter where you are because it's in your blood and it's in your DNA to be what you are amen listen I tell you what brother sister amen you young sisters I I I put them up against the whole world that's out there that's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost because there listen they're fighting pressure from the world and peer pressure and influence and all of this and yet here amen dressed in Holiness dressed in righteousness they're in the house of God they want to serve God they want to worship god listen I know it ain't always easy you're hearing from somebody that understands it ain't always easy but I'll tell you this there is a blessing when you press to the house of God anyhow there was a blessing when you say God I'm discouraged but I'm getting back up God I am let down but I'm going to keep on getting back up you said B but I know I need to endure but you don't get how low I am I get you get low yeah amen you go through battles you go through trials but listen you've got to get back up sometimes listen you say well well I fail and I you see the devil will give you whatever excuse you want it's the truth if you don't want to come to church he'll give you a good excuse I got to go buy peanut butter what kind of excuse is that go buy bread what kind of excuse is that just as good as any see the devil will supply the excuses and he'll Supply them all day long but I say away with excuses brother I would overcome but this and this and this amen why don't you stop making excuses and say listen the reason I'm not close to God is because of me the reason I'm not overcoming is because of me amen I didn't not been preach all I'll preach with this I guess amen we can't be blaming one another and we can't be blaming the church we amen you you realize that's exactly what Adam did in the garden oh yeah he Adam was there and he gave a pretty good excuse he said well God it was her it was the woman that you gave me it was her fault amen that was the first little mix up in the marriage wasn't it it was the woman's fault that you gave me it was because of her that that I went and partook of the forbidden fruit and this and this is amen see the devil always wants to give you an excuse of why you can't do it and why you can't serve God and why you can't surrender amen see the devil will make you many many offers if you don't surrender to God I'll give you this and give you this listen he's a over promiser and he's an under deliverer he will promise you things that he ain't ever going to give you he'll promise you a life that he ain't able to give you he'll promise you'll be popular you'll be love you'll be this and you'll be that listen he'll give you the whole entire world brother soul but why does it profit a man if he gained the whole world but yet lose his soul amen see you got to endure those things that the devil brings your way that's exactly right amen you can amen you can take in all these areas of the scripture amen but one Keystone in it is that you'll have to endure Hallelujah I love what the scripture says in 2 Timothy 2:3 I know I'm giving you a lot of scripture here in 2 Timothy 2:3 thou therefore endure hardness yes as a good soldier of Jesus Christ he say but but but nothing's changing and nothing's happening and the services aren't getting better and this ain't happening and this ain't happening but you still got to endure amen amen you still got to endure well well I thought things would be better by now I thought I thought this would be this way you've got to endure it brother sister well well you know I I would really sell out to God but the rest of the church ain't selling out to God the rest of the church got nothing to do with you do you realize we're not going in the Rapture as a church we're going in the Rapture as a individual amen you realize you can have just four people in here that are on fire and full of the Holy Ghost it don't matter if the church is dead and quiet and formal listen if you get somebody truly on fire the Holy Ghost it don't matter what you don't matter if you put them and a bucket of ice water brother sister amen because it's in them and there is a fire that is in them that can't be put out because they're willing to endure it hallelujah it's exactly the scripture to him that overcometh amen amen see you got to overcome brother sister amen you don't overcome just when it's easy or when it's pleasant but you overcome because you have to yeah right there ain't another way there ain't alternate way there ain't more than one way to do this you've got to overcome what but but what about if I hold on you no you can't hold on to nothing see when they come out of the land of Egypt they had to leave everything behind they had to leave the garlics they had to leave the amen the clothes of Egypt you're hearing me they had to leave everything of Egypt behind because God was going to give them new food so they wouldn't need the food that Egypt had to offer amen God was going to give them a new thing that's exactly right amen not because it was pleasant sure it wasn't pleasant to get rid of everything that they had and go out into the Wilderness into a Strange Land but they had to do it because God was calling them to that see you've got to realize that there's certain things you just have to overcome amen and I want you to realize something very carefully here that we could all go back in time and think about a battle or think about a struggle or or think about something that you went through true amen and I want you to think of it just for a moment and look at where you are here today you're here in the house of God on a Saturday night amen you're here serving God you're here playing music you're here s amen you're here lifting your hands to God you're here hearing a crazy North Carolina preacher screaming preach at you for about an hour on almost amen you're here today because that you persevered and because that you overcame listen amen I know the devil wants to put you down and and belittle you and say you're not this and you're not this but but I want to let you know you got here because you overcame amen all of hell you overcame every devil that came your way and listen the god that brought you this far is the god that will bring you all the way back to Eternity amen what makes you think that God would pull you out of every everything you've been through and that he would leave you here today amen no sir that's not the God that I serve but the God that I serve the god that brought me here is going to bring me all the way amen God is not a halfway God God is not a God that just just does a decent job but he does a perfect job well I would overcome but but but you don't know my issues and my problems well let me tell let me talk to you about some men because Abraham was a liar Noah was a drunk David was an adulterer amen all of these men if there was an excuse amen these men had an excuse but they still overcame amen you realize David amen Christ was at the seed of David the literal Messiah amen David was attributed to the lineage of the Messiah and he was an adulterer and a murderer Hallelujah you said well God can't use some like me I'm just so messed up listen but you can't take that excuse it don't work with God it don't work with his terms listen to me tonight there ain't a there ain't a dirty that's too dirty that God is not able to clean there ain't a low that is too low that God's hand is not able to reach to there's not a sickness that's too bad that God is not able to heal it's exactly the truth amen away with with excuses away with well I would but this I would but that I would but this no let let's just get rid of that and say I'm here to overcome I'm here to endure amen I'm here to win this listen I don't know about you all amen but I've been serving the lord for a number of years now and I'm not going to come all the way this far and just say well I guess I just ain't going to do it no more right it'd be like a man working on a project takes him 15 years and he work 14 says I'm done with it now when you get all the way to the end of it that ain't the time that ain't the time to cool off and say well I guess I just won't do it no more but see when you get all the way to the very end of it that's when you say listen I got to buckle down I've got to get this job done listen I want to speak to you very clearly tonight amen sometimes we just got to buckle down and say we've got to get this job done amen listen to me church amen there is a race to run there is a vict to be had there is a Rapture to go in and I'm looking at a people that are going to be there by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony listen you didn't come this far just to turn around listen turn around ain't in your vocabulary give up ain't in your vocabulary he said but I'm down right now then get back up amen stand to your feet and endure hardness as a good soldier amen you Lord hallelujah well the other young people ain't living right what have they got to do with you well this one ain't overcoming andon I but I hear you talking about that and I and I hear you I I I don't have an example to look to I I don't know another young person that's overcoming the world and that ain't worldly and that ain't I don't know another young sister why don't you stop looking for an example and you be the example why don't you stop looking at the church for an example of Holiness and you be the example of Holiness amen you young men well well I don't know other brothers that don't act like the world and don't talk like the world and tell them dirty jokes and tell this nonsense Heen you don't have to know somebody else like that you be the example of a true Born Again Holy Ghost filled believer you said but it's going to be hard I know it's going to to be hard but you've got to endure hardness right hallelujah hallelujah amen endure hardness endure hardness as a good soldier amen what has God placed you here for how can I overcome the prophet says it this way said we find here that God has always had Overcomers will he have them in Georgia amen that's right will God have some will God have a young person in Georgia will God have somebody that will overcome will God have somebody that will endure till the end listen I get it you've endured for a long time but you can't stop I get you've end dired for 15 years but you can't stop you realize I met people that's been serving the lord for 30 years and then walk away get out of church and backslide all together they did good for 30 years but then now look at it see it don't matter for the 30 years if you're still not living it right I said God don't ever let us get that way where we get weary in well doing but let's realize we've got to endure to the end of this thing amen I don't know about you all but but that's what I'm here for amen amen that's what you should be here for amen I'm not here to see what I can get by with I'm here to endure hardness as a good soldier I say God make us some examples amen amen make us examples of people that are persistant amen listen when you amen when you fall short of the glory of God and you will don't you let the devil take you out of the house of God because of that when you make a mistake or you fall in your face and you will don't you ever let the devil take you out of the house of God because of that amen see if the devil can ever get you focused on your past or focused on your failures he will have you defeated right then see you got to focus on the perfect lamb you got to focus on The Advocate that God has given you listen you ain't here because you're worthy you're here because he is worthy don't focus on you focus on him don't focus on the problem focus on the promise don't focus on your past focus on your future that's according to the word of God listen I want to tell you you're going to overcome amen amen you're going to overcome listen I want to tell you tonight you're going to have the last laugh on the devil it's just the truth you're amen you're going to have the last one listen there's going to come a day where you tread out tread out upon the ashes of the wicked and the ones that tormented you you'll look at them like the prophet Isaiah said and say is this the man is this the one that gave me so much grief is this the one that tormented me listen there was coming the day that you'll look down on your adversary and you'll say that's the one that caused that's the one that always taught me out of leaving church that's the one that almost taught me out of serving God hallelujah he ain't nothing but a bluff it's the truth he's nothing but a bluff you said well what do we do when when disappointments come endure them amen what do we do when the pastor lets us down I'm sorry for the Wade we endure listen if he don't go if the Deacon don't go it ain't going to hinder you y'all know that song I'm sure and if the church don't go I'm going anyway cuz I'm on my way amen listen I I love what the prophet said he said I like a man of vision I like a man that has a goal I like a man that's got he's got a meaning in being there I I say God give us the vision of this church we're not without a vision we're not without a direction listen the prophet already saw us over there he already saw a preview of The Bride that will come out of loud of see listen let's not let our vision get blurry amen let's our eyes on the prize like Paul said I press I Endure I fight Amen to the mark of the High Calling which is in Christ Jesus amen stand to your feet musicians go ahead and come I say God give us people that's willing to endure amen and how was Abraham the father of many nations because he endured how did Noah survive the flood because he endured and and how did job get back everything he lost because he endured how will you see the victory by enduring the wicked one that's right amen listen brother I I want to tell you there's a seed on the inside of you and it is Unstoppable amen it's Unstoppable it don't matter what comes your way that seed life will prevail you're an Unstoppable Church you you young people you're an Unstoppable young people people not this flesh but the Jean seed on the inside of you it's
