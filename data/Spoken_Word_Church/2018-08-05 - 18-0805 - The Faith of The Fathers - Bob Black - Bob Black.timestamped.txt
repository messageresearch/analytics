[0:04] you know and this is a topic that we all
[0:25] should be able to quote you know right
[0:27] from the Buffalo this fact that this
[0:29] hidden actually verbatim from the bottle
[0:33] and interestingly you know in coordinate
[0:37] interesting new this is a phrase that
[0:39] program didn't even use until 1960 it
[0:45] took him awhile you can say this phrase
[0:48] exactly like the way it is faith of our
[0:51] fathers faith of these fathers anything
[0:53] like that he didn't even say until 1960
[0:57] what is that it's something that we've
[1:00] got to come to try and so down at the
[1:03] bottom I put this little quote for Paul
[1:06] speaking this to Timothy he said and he
[1:09] said the god of Our Fathers has chosen
[1:11] thee that thou should us know his will
[1:13] and see that just one and should us hear
[1:15] the voice of his mouth in that a good
[1:17] quote for somebody tell somebody but he
[1:20] is in this quote easily the god of our
[1:22] fathers you think about how you know
[1:25] even Paul is kind of looking back to a
[1:28] face that people that had gone before
[1:31] him believers and so we've looked back
[1:34] at the original that original face of
[1:37] the first church age to what what they
[1:41] believed their original doctrine that
[1:44] we've got to go back to you yeah I'm the
[1:48] core and y'all never go where the way
[1:52] he's preached brotherly this morning
[1:53] with
[1:57] the air is coming right back
[1:59] okay thank you yeah you don't mind I've
[2:08] noticed that we expanded the city school
[2:09] class a little more so welcome the other
[2:11] class
[2:14] the faith of our father of the father so
[2:18] just a little background what is faith
[2:21] because we're talking about we want to
[2:24] talk about this morning how do we get
[2:27] the faith of the father's yes if they're
[2:29] so important and what is faith and how
[2:33] do you get it and we you know that that
[2:35] scripture Hebrews 11:1 is it is very
[2:38] familiar to us all faith is the
[2:40] substance of things hoped for the
[2:42] evidence of things not seen
[2:44] so now if you put that to to participate
[2:49] faith your faith is the evidence of the
[2:53] new birth your faith isn't evidence why
[2:57] is it evidence because this is substance
[2:59] it is the substance it's the thing this
[3:02] faith is the substance of God himself
[3:05] inside of you escalations 2:20 when you
[3:08] believe because his own he begins to
[3:11] believe it inside of you right
[3:13] faith is the substance the so brother
[3:16] Branham in that in their very first
[3:17] sermon that one of the you know the
[3:20] first sermon he recorded way back when
[3:22] and he was talking about faith he began
[3:24] to explain that story that we all know
[3:27] so well they he explained it a small
[3:29] sister that was seeking healing that if
[3:32] you have faith you know all things are
[3:36] possible him to believe and he said I
[3:38] can you move this off
[3:39] and she said no and he said well how I
[3:41] can do it and my face that substance the
[3:46] substance face which proves that faith
[3:49] is a it's actually something real is not
[3:51] something imaginary that we just like
[3:54] it's just the philosophy or something
[3:56] like in the early church that the
[3:58] Gnostics and so forth believe that you
[4:01] know all these philosophy and things
[4:02] about the more knowledge you could
[4:04] accumulate that the higher you would
[4:06] grow at everything but faith this is
[4:08] something real and so they demonstrate
[4:11] that he actually reached out with his
[4:13] faith and cause that that thing that was
[4:16] hanging by string to actually move and
[4:19] then he told the story that we got here
[4:22] this quote that if ever my barley knife
[4:25] Barlow knife and I'm Barbie Barlow we're
[4:28] not is only shelf at home but I believe
[4:32] that it's in my pocket you know that you
[4:35] know that causes a lot of people will
[4:36] stone yes but that's how how real faith
[4:40] is faith is is like a it clicked
[4:46] something into place to allow something
[4:50] to operate through it
[4:53] faith is is like a Dow u-turn to get the
[4:58] receiver lined up and so he demonstrated
[5:02] that if if the Barlow knife is on the
[5:04] shelf at home and you forgot it and you
[5:06] believe it then God can put it in your
[5:09] pocket because you believe it wow that's
[5:14] that's far-fetched that's amazing
[5:17] but yeah is true faith actually will
[5:21] make things happen
[5:22] faith and now brother Branham had do you
[5:24] talk about that he'll explain your faith
[5:26] in God's by his faith he said when then
[5:30] you know we've talked about this before
[5:32] come up in the prayer line and she can
[5:34] have her eyes crossed with his face he
[5:36] could uncross her eyes later on that
[5:37] cross back again but when God's faith
[5:40] took hold they would stay crossed his
[5:43] faith you know because he was a man of
[5:45] great faith he could he could do things
[5:48] like that that you know for us it's
[5:51] honestly it's almost you know it seems a
[5:54] little bit out of reach but yeah if you
[5:57] believe the scripture says all things
[6:01] are possible
[6:02] and so the faith of the fathers really
[6:06] is is something that's given to
[6:08] believers that are have reached a
[6:12] maturity because you wonder why why
[6:15] doesn't everybody have all of these
[6:17] different things because God is looking
[6:20] you know he's not gonna give something
[6:23] he's not gonna give the car keys to you
[6:24] if you're gonna go drive it off in a
[6:26] ditch he's not gonna give things to you
[6:29] if you don't know how to wield it and
[6:31] how to use it and what not so that the
[6:35] faith of the father's is there's a lot
[6:37] involved with that you see so let's read
[6:40] this quote real quick he said in faith
[6:42] in faith is the substance he said here
[6:44] in my pocket I think there's an old
[6:45] Barlow knife I've carried for years no I
[6:47] do not see that knife I did not feel
[6:49] that knife I did not taste that knife I
[6:51] did not smell that knife but I know that
[6:53] knife is in there how do you know
[6:54] because I believe it's in there now if
[6:57] it is not in there faith will put it in
[6:59] there if it's not there that chokes you
[7:02] I know but that's true if you believe
[7:04] all things are possible
[7:06] you afraid to take God friends you're
[7:09] scared now I'm out of lift that knife
[7:11] laying on the dresser
[7:14] this is sure of that nice is on the
[7:16] dresser right now if I believe it with
[7:18] all my heart it'll be in my pocket that
[7:21] Junction but God is able to put it there
[7:23] if you believe it that judge has done it
[7:27] but yeah we're supposed to take a body
[7:30] change how do we take a body change
[7:32] you're gonna take a body change by faith
[7:34] by believing something that seems
[7:36] impossible how do you get that faith
[7:38] that's what we're gonna talk about this
[7:40] more faith is the substance I say
[7:53] message brother I said if you have your
[7:54] faith according to your faith be it any
[7:57] is that right no matter how you feel
[8:00] you're healed in that no matter what you
[8:04] see you see what I mean nothing can take
[8:09] it out of your heart
[8:19] and I ain't turning it's over and I'm
[8:23] gonna be loud on that report well if you
[8:26] didn't understand it I understand no
[8:28] that's fine
[8:29] I think it's behind that way well then
[8:31] this right there maybe it's ours that
[8:35] might come from
[8:45] as long as they're right
[8:51] no matter how you feel you're here
[8:53] leaning out there's nothing you take it
[8:55] out of your heart you know that it's
[8:56] just a positive act right if you could
[8:59] only see a friend something would take
[9:01] place you could only know what I'm
[9:04] talking about something would react
[9:06] right now see it's a part that is right
[9:08] there just as positive as these other
[9:10] five senses these are the natural man
[9:13] they give God the natural man and be
[9:18] wrong but God
[9:22] so faith faith is a substance
[9:25] it's something is something real they
[9:28] can move things that can cause a
[9:29] reaction they'll call the reaction in
[9:31] your life it can change you if you just
[9:33] believe God work so out of how do you
[9:37] get faith faith comes by hearing and
[9:40] this is this is something I kind of want
[9:43] to stress to you know you can put the
[9:45] word right in front of somebody you can
[9:47] say that there's one God you must be
[9:51] baptized available Jesus Christ
[9:53] that all the different things that maybe
[9:56] we loaned us as simple truths but yet if
[9:59] someone is lacks the hearing and they
[10:02] won't be able to hear it and so they
[10:04] won't be able to your faith
[10:05] faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[10:08] the word so you can play the word ride
[10:10] from somebody but there it's like a
[10:12] something's over their eyes or something
[10:14] it's blocking it for the a here and what
[10:17] that is is all the hatred teaching the
[10:21] carnal doctors opinions that have
[10:22] blinded their eyes so when you take when
[10:25] you take somebody felt when God lifts
[10:28] the veil from their eyes you can begin
[10:30] to see it allows the light to come here
[10:33] so we'll see in a second how that that
[10:35] the face produces the light or our faith
[10:39] allows the light to come and we'll say
[10:41] like that
[10:44] and you know you that's why you can't
[10:46] argue somebody into the message or eight
[10:48] to ET anything because it takes God to
[10:51] take that to lift that veil from their
[10:52] eyes so they can actually hear what
[10:54] you're saying a lot of times you know
[10:56] you'll talk to somebody and it seems
[10:59] like you're making no cover a fantastic
[11:01] explanation or whatever but but it's
[11:02] just like there's available that
[11:04] something's sitting in between so faith
[11:07] comes by hearing and you can hear what
[11:09] the message is hear what the gospel is
[11:11] saying then it'll produce pain he said
[11:16] and this is this is little storability I
[11:19] was talking about how Hannah went to to
[11:22] heal I went down to the temple to get to
[11:24] pray for a child and she's crying out to
[11:28] God to produce a child in her and look
[11:31] up her mom said she knew that she's
[11:33] gonna have that child when the priest
[11:35] said she said she see the doctor
[11:37] explanation I'm not gonna go strong
[11:39] drink but I'm praying that the Lord take
[11:41] away my our fruits now watch he said the
[11:44] Lord draining you the Lord bless me this
[11:46] is what he lied a priest to say to her
[11:48] and that's all she more than nothing
[11:50] again I'm talking about how you get
[11:52] faith no one's gods priest gods priests
[11:57] that announced blessings on her she was
[11:59] at the house of God she was at the house
[12:02] of God and the priests announced
[12:04] blessings on him and he said the Lord
[12:06] granted you the Lord bless you now God
[12:09] could have put the baby in Iran
[12:11] don't make any difference whether it
[12:14] happened right there or not she had done
[12:16] words something our faith cometh by
[12:18] hearing and hearing of the word of God
[12:20] she accepted it or right then with home
[12:22] rejoice Brady God going that the baby
[12:25] and then nine months little sang was
[12:27] born
[12:27] is that right why why she took God at
[12:31] his work
[12:32] she believed faith comes by hearing
[12:36] hearing the Word of God she heard him
[12:39] citing the Lord granted you the Lord
[12:42] blessed and she grabbed all of that and
[12:43] and and really I'm getting to a kind of
[12:51] an important concept is because stumbles
[12:53] a lot of people that faith comes by
[12:54] hearing the word because that is a big
[12:57] stumbling block for a lot of you a lot
[12:58] of people think that faith comes by by
[13:01] feelings and sensations in that and
[13:03] getting in a church service and feeling
[13:04] kind of normal but if you don't have the
[13:07] word house paint gonna go if you feel
[13:10] something you might have you might feel
[13:12] confident for a little bit but faith is
[13:14] gotta be for the long term Nathan's got
[13:17] to be when you're down in the lines
[13:19] there my name
[13:20] we get thrown into the fiery furnace
[13:21] like like three of your children where
[13:24] the circumstances aren't really set up
[13:27] for you to feel good at about things I
[13:29] think is something that faithless got to
[13:32] be something real okay
[13:33] not just something that is built on an
[13:35] emotion or whatever and so this
[13:38] dismisses this quote my brother I'm
[13:40] sitting persevered he said this if every
[13:43] sick person in here tonight could just
[13:45] have faith in God
[13:46] like George watchman did your Dell where
[13:47] that stands before me tonight we're at
[13:49] the Melton way some way you could cross
[13:51] it that's that's a big old statement
[13:53] right there no matter what your
[13:56] opposition is you would still crossing
[14:00] you would be persistent so persistent
[14:03] till that cancer two more whatever it is
[14:05] would never be able to stand there
[14:07] because you could cross over to the
[14:08] promise that God I give you meaning can
[14:11] only be persistent after they have heard
[14:14] from God you can only be persistent
[14:18] after you've heard the word after you've
[14:19] heard the word faith is only based on
[14:21] the Word of God because faith comes by
[14:24] hearing the Word of God you can't base
[14:27] your face on while I was in a good
[14:29] church service man in it and it was a
[14:30] lot of fun jumping around or anything
[14:33] you think that I'm serious that seemed
[14:36] real simple but yeah so many of them
[14:38] maybe even unconscious maybe even
[14:40] unconscious to the base our faith or
[14:43] whatever
[14:44] something other than the Word of God
[14:45] like to play I'm serious because you
[14:50] know you're talking to people sometimes
[14:52] and and they begin to really push back
[14:56] on the idea that the Word of God is what
[14:59] it's all based on the Word of God
[15:04] because you can't have faith without
[15:05] them again this is this is a little
[15:09] stumbling block that I was talking about
[15:10] the idea that because everybody likes
[15:13] that matchstick where you like the
[15:14] people who strike the mansion in your
[15:16] home it if you don't have something to
[15:18] light it to you don't have to gasoline
[15:20] you know something to burn then the
[15:22] match is going to go out if you don't
[15:26] have the mechanics the mechanics you see
[15:29] makes a way for the dynamics when you
[15:32] have faith in something and the Word of
[15:36] God then it makes a way for the Spirit
[15:40] work so you must have the mechanics and
[15:43] the more mechanics you have then the
[15:46] more dynamics you can have which seems
[15:48] the opposite to the way you would think
[15:51] right so so that's why when you come to
[15:57] church if you come to the house of God
[15:59] and somebody that's a little bit
[16:01] elevated like your pastor can look at
[16:04] you to look at the situation and say
[16:06] well you need some more antifreeze you
[16:10] need your your your brakes are about to
[16:12] go out or your engine is about to blow
[16:16] up you don't put some omen and they can
[16:20] look at the situation and say there's a
[16:23] problem there somewhere and and then and
[16:26] then the word
[16:27] the priest at that's why the word is a
[16:31] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[16:34] the heart
[16:34] many times the ministry is I said it was
[16:37] the minister but many times it's really
[16:39] not even the minister it shouldn't be
[16:41] it's God speaking through that minister
[16:43] to discern situations to discern things
[16:47] that make the mister don't even know
[16:48] about yeah that's really the way it
[16:51] should work is that the minister is not
[16:53] even that's what I like if the Minister
[16:55] it is is that he ate him there he's
[16:58] supposed to be out of way the gift is to
[17:00] get yourself out of the way so that God
[17:02] can use you then and I probably many
[17:06] times as we get too much in the way but
[17:08] if you get out of the way then the work
[17:10] and discern the problems that are in the
[17:12] church and and call out problems like
[17:15] new suspensions wrong there his office
[17:17] was messed up or whatever and and then
[17:19] preach that word and begin to lay a
[17:21] foundation so that people
[17:23] and the work the spirit can work the
[17:28] more mechanics you have the more life
[17:33] makes it real simple it's morning the
[17:37] more the more gasoline you have less the
[17:39] mechanics the more mechanics then the
[17:42] more light yeah yes strike if you strike
[17:45] that match God's knocking at the door if
[17:48] there's nothing there you just say well
[17:50] I don't even know anything about God I
[17:52] don't know you've got to hear the work
[17:54] so that you can say well okay now I know
[17:58] like like for example service II now we
[18:01] know when the Spirit strikes that pile
[18:05] of dead our gasoline you know then then
[18:10] it opens up when you really see Sir
[18:12] Percy okay and I'm on that because I've
[18:15] been talking to my kids about that the
[18:18] when you see that and the reason I'm
[18:21] talking about I was telling my kids
[18:22] about elves because there's a lot of
[18:24] opposition to that in them well but when
[18:36] you see servicing it opens up all sorts
[18:39] of things begin to realize why Jesus had
[18:41] to be born a virgin birth
[18:45] the original problem was in the garden
[18:47] what what how everything in the
[18:49] scripture ties together and that's how
[18:51] it is with all with any revelation when
[18:54] God ignites it and it will produce
[18:57] something so you can't a point is you
[18:59] can't you can't have to have a great
[19:05] movie of a spirit to see something
[19:07] miraculous you got to have that that
[19:09] word lay in your heart so back to the
[19:17] faith of the fathers why do we need that
[19:22] you're just kind of looking down through
[19:23] the seven churches and talking about
[19:26] life how you can't believe if window
[19:29] blinders come off of your eyes then you
[19:32] begin liking come in and you can see so
[19:35] what happened thousands of seven
[19:37] churches especially in the dark ages
[19:40] that's why it's called the dark ages so
[19:43] the light was the kind of hills covered
[19:45] up people's understanding was covered up
[19:48] so they could they it was this about all
[19:50] eating down until they hardly had any
[19:52] understanding of anything
[19:54] and you were in Sydney hey Bailey hope
[19:57] he'll only anything with just some of
[19:58] the just the basic fundamentals of
[20:00] Christianity it had all been eaten down
[20:02] and so without without that without the
[20:06] mechanics how would somebody in the Dark
[20:10] Ages be able to take a body change or
[20:12] things like that it would be impossible
[20:15] you see you got up to for the changing
[20:19] of the body for the changing to get your
[20:23] spirit lined up you you've gotta have
[20:25] the word and you gotta believe it so we
[20:30] said the nikah and this money
[20:31] interchange the Nicolaitans kept
[20:33] smothering the amount until the dark
[20:34] ages Luther's a - brought out the first
[20:36] step of grace a little light began to
[20:38] shine
[20:38] then come forth after that come John
[20:41] Wesley with sanctification road a little
[20:43] brighter and then come the baptism of
[20:45] the Holy Ghost for the Pentecostals
[20:46] bringing back again the faith of the
[20:48] Father but they could not keep it that
[20:51] way
[20:51] thus they had to organize it and then
[20:54] they started it right back into Nicolay
[20:56] it's in here so you see how God working
[21:00] through these men began to bring back
[21:02] but come back to John with Martin Luther
[21:06] John Wesley back to the moment
[21:09] come back to that original face bringing
[21:13] back but yet though still one seems to
[21:15] be tied up which is why God had two
[21:17] percent of profit leasing John one one
[21:21] five something about life and another
[21:25] scripture at the beginning was the word
[21:27] and the Word was with God and the Word
[21:28] was God the same was in the beginning
[21:31] with God all things were made by him
[21:33] without him was not anything made that
[21:34] was made in him was life and the life
[21:37] was the light of me and the light
[21:40] shineth in darkness and the darkness
[21:42] comprehended it not so what is that
[21:45] light that shine that light is the word
[21:48] but he wasn't the Walker from the
[21:49] beginning he was he was the water and
[21:51] that light that shines out is the Word
[21:54] of God made manifest so that's what that
[21:58] life you can see a home that's what this
[22:00] seven church ages this char signifies
[22:03] that the light is just a little bit of
[22:06] light in the dark ages eaten down and
[22:09] then it comes back until in Laodicea
[22:12] that line is pushed out of the the
[22:15] church system is pushed out outside a
[22:17] candle and you can see how there's just
[22:21] going to be a very small little group of
[22:23] people they come back to that full faith
[22:26] of the father's that believe
[22:31] the other I said in a resume of the ages
[22:34] talking about the dark ages and indeed
[22:36] for about 1,000 years the church went
[22:38] into the depth of blackness knowing the
[22:41] depths of Satan
[22:43] down here that you can see exactly where
[22:45] the nominal church was in the dark ages
[22:47] they left the Word of God entirely
[22:50] except for names and titling dhaniya
[22:53] than a few scriptural principles they
[22:56] twisted what they did take out of the
[22:57] Bible by changing his meaning the
[23:00] College of Bishops obsession with vast
[23:02] treatises that books declared himself
[23:04] infallible and they received revelation
[23:07] from God and spoke as done to the people
[23:09] all this was talked to the priest who
[23:12] through fear made the people believe it
[23:14] to the sink or the death race
[23:17] communication which might be worse than
[23:20] death it was now the church with the
[23:22] insured voice that took over and wild
[23:25] with power they drank the blood of the
[23:26] martyrs until the true Christians were
[23:29] all but exterminated and it was hardly
[23:32] any word left to see what comes with
[23:36] hardly a word left that little
[23:38] manifestation of the Holy Ghost our
[23:41] meaning were left and little
[23:43] manifestation of all the goats but the
[23:45] true vine struggled and survived God was
[23:48] faithful to the little flock and in
[23:51] spite of what role might do to their
[23:53] bodies God
[23:54] the spirit within them and the light of
[23:57] the truth shown back by the Holy Ghost
[24:00] Empire
[24:03] now there's another little stumbling
[24:05] block is that is that the idea that well
[24:09] they they couldn't have the new birth
[24:10] back in these ages they believed the
[24:12] word for their day and that produced
[24:15] like not as much light as there should
[24:18] be in this day because of the fewer
[24:22] amount of the less amount of mechanics
[24:24] the less gasoline will produce less life
[24:27] then a whole big only container won't
[24:30] bathtub fulla or whatever go
[24:37] so
[24:40] I'm getting to what is the faith of the
[24:43] father that brother Hank said and turn
[24:46] on the light he said these signs shall
[24:47] follow them to believe that's what Jesus
[24:50] said
[24:50] my name they shall cast out Devils they
[24:53] shall speak with new tongues these signs
[24:54] shall follow them that we shall follow
[24:56] them they say it's all right for the
[24:58] Apostles not for us that's a glare you
[25:02] see where that is that's saying that
[25:04] it's all right for the followers but I
[25:07] don't know if the faith of the father's
[25:09] could be made manifest again when you
[25:12] say it's all right to the impossible but
[25:15] not for us
[25:16] jesus said these signs shall follow them
[25:18] that believe to all the world
[25:20] I remember on that day that cold
[25:24] pre-flight free light will not dry
[25:27] Tennessee up today
[25:29] ving denies the scene it's the fondness
[25:33] upon the earth the business it's time
[25:36] for God to rise and turn on the light
[25:39] again make his word to lead them
[25:42] certainly like that cold cream won't
[25:44] ripen the green it certainly won't it's
[25:48] time for God to rise and turn on the
[25:50] light again how is it going to turn the
[25:52] like it turns the light on by order of
[25:57] the more words you have more like if you
[26:01] believe it that's another danger to the
[26:04] danger of just being an intellectual
[26:07] because I pulse it you can have all
[26:09] understand all mysteries and I have all
[26:11] knowledge and everything but yet you
[26:14] haven't really given yourself over to
[26:16] the over you have an open the door we
[26:18] haven't truly believed it and it's just
[26:20] you know really you can tell I think I
[26:25] really did forget to differentiate
[26:27] between intellectualism and a real faint
[26:29] is they'll produce a real faithful
[26:32] producing weakness because of the
[26:35] election ilysm just make something where
[26:38] you want to tell everybody how much you
[26:39] know and put people down but if it's
[26:43] real face you try to build one another
[26:44] up instead of putting push it consists
[26:47] on my down under your phone and and make
[26:49] it I'm like well you you don't know all
[26:51] the stuff on it so that's why program
[26:58] priests there's a man in here that can
[27:01] turn on the light and he said they
[27:04] probably took them under the wise men
[27:06] that follow that like to Jesus's birth
[27:08] he said they follow the Word of God to
[27:11] the light with all it was the word that
[27:14] brought life so will why wasn't in the
[27:17] day not blinded by freaks it will fall a
[27:19] god-given spoken words and they see the
[27:22] bullets of the power of God
[27:24] within this hour is that that's what
[27:27] produces life and then he told that
[27:29] story of the down in that cave where the
[27:33] little little girl got scared because
[27:36] the lights were turned off when I was
[27:39] alone then little brother there that
[27:41] said don't fear your little sister
[27:43] there's a man here I can turn on the
[27:45] light now of course the man our little
[27:49] brother was brother branham day that
[27:51] cried out to the bride don't fear
[27:53] there's a man here they can turn on the
[27:54] light and that's why we're not you know
[27:57] everybody says well you guys are
[27:58] following the main well you really
[28:02] honestly we're the only group that is
[28:04] not following me we're following God
[28:07] himself and came down and and and used
[28:11] people's lives he is brother Brennan's
[28:13] lives and now the powerful ministry to
[28:16] speak a word that will turn on the light
[28:19] so that you can see clearly
[28:26] and so what's it gonna do all the
[28:30] children back to the faith of the Father
[28:33] Pentecostal father back to the original
[28:36] faith he talks about how through the
[28:39] church changes day that the church is
[28:41] messengers stayed directly with it and
[28:43] was pushed out it's dated right with
[28:46] with the work that they had for their
[28:48] day even though things got screwed love
[28:51] things fell off all known to be seven
[28:53] churches until we get to the end and
[28:55] then God sent a prophet to take us back
[28:58] to the original faith
[28:59] the Holy Ghost is for whosoever will
[29:02] alien olive is in God's will for it to
[29:04] just be a holy man is the Holy Ghost
[29:06] amongst our people
[29:07] that's warning is showing signs and
[29:09] wonders that same church that evening
[29:12] star will reflect the same like the
[29:16] morning star just like that that vision
[29:20] brother Branham said eyes and said he he
[29:23] had of the like two Brides coming to a
[29:27] personal
[29:30] parading you know that he saw the bride
[29:33] in it that be so here's the scripture
[29:39] that we're all here for meeting with we
[29:41] hold I will send you Elijah the Prophet
[29:43] before the pump before the coming of the
[29:45] Great and rippled a little or any shall
[29:47] turn the hearts of the father's to the
[29:48] children and the heart of the children
[29:50] to their fathers lest I come and smite
[29:52] the earth with her so the word the word
[29:57] fate though the father's that exact
[29:59] phrase is not unity where the Bible
[30:01] that's where that comes from
[30:02] he's going to turn the heart of the
[30:04] children to the father's
[30:06] how is it going to do that house how did
[30:10] that happen
[30:26] let's talk about what is the Clayton in
[30:28] the park
[30:32] in Acts chapter 3 just that
[30:36] on the spirit fellow that they have
[30:37] Pentecost then get the priest boldly and
[30:40] in Acts chapter 3 verse 6 this is when
[30:45] they met that beggar sitting at the gate
[30:48] beautiful and Peter said silver and gold
[30:50] have I knew but such as I have give IV
[30:55] and the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[30:57] rise up and walk
[31:00] this next few slides I just want to
[31:02] really highlight not so much the power
[31:06] and the miracles of the early church but
[31:08] the characteristics of the people
[31:11] because of what the statute perfect man
[31:15] is and what the faith of the fathers is
[31:17] Tennessee is a mature church that knows
[31:20] what to do with the word that's not just
[31:22] talks about this not you know like like
[31:24] I said not just putting other people
[31:26] under their phone and saying how much do
[31:27] we know and not being like little
[31:30] children that that don't know how to act
[31:32] but these people more mature Christians
[31:36] that knew what the word
[31:37] what God one done with the word and they
[31:41] they like there's a quote and I think
[31:44] it's a statue of a perfect man where you
[31:45] said the slide is not from God
[31:47] and off they go doing it if they didn't
[31:50] have to go you know spend a lot of time
[31:53] on their knees say not are you sure this
[31:55] is what you want me to do they just they
[31:57] just ran with they they knew what God
[31:59] one down the door and they didn't have
[32:01] to have somebody convince some more
[32:03] upset sit through a lot of services and
[32:05] have the minister just preach and preach
[32:07] and preach until finally they were
[32:09] convinced but they were mature
[32:10] Christians mess with the faith of the
[32:13] fathers is it's not just a little a
[32:14] little child tossed around so so here in
[32:18] verse 12
[32:22] when Peter began to give an explanation
[32:24] for this for this miracle he said you
[32:27] better visual I'm horrible year this I
[32:30] would look you so earnestly on us as
[32:32] though by our own power or holiness we
[32:35] had made this man to walk see that
[32:38] demonstrate I believe that he knew he
[32:42] knew of the mechanism by which this man
[32:45] was made to walk it what nothing to do
[32:47] with his own holiness it was that God
[32:50] was living inside of him and he knew how
[32:53] to operate that he knew how to make the
[32:56] thing work the God of Abraham and of
[32:59] Isaac and of Jacob the god of Our
[33:02] Fathers hath glorified His Son Jesus
[33:07] that's how brother Branham always said
[33:09] that a real minister a ruminant Romanian
[33:12] Eve I will point to Jesus not to
[33:14] themself and so that's exactly what they
[33:17] were doing they were they were pointing
[33:18] the way to Jesus the next chapter for
[33:23] when they they all have been decorum and
[33:26] Peter gave an explanation for what was
[33:29] going on and see you and you rulers of
[33:32] the people and elders of Israel if we
[33:34] this day be examined with a good deed
[33:36] done to the impotent man by what means
[33:38] gives made holy
[33:39] because almond involved and to all the
[33:42] people of Israel that by the name of
[33:45] Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you
[33:47] crucified whom God raised from the dead
[33:49] even by him to this man stand here
[33:51] before you home and then he said this
[33:53] very remarkable phrase it seems to be
[33:56] lost on many even as in this day this is
[33:59] the stone which was set at nought of you
[34:03] builders which has become the head
[34:07] and I don't want to point out something
[34:09] that this later the fathers was lost
[34:12] that that understanding that they had at
[34:16] the beginning that that means the
[34:18] mysteries that they held was the lost
[34:20] and it's Neil all the way up to here
[34:24] with mother Brenda k1c and begin to
[34:26] bring the full word to us this was lost
[34:30] what the stench of a perfect man that
[34:33] that there's any kind of growth process
[34:35] that there's any material and you can
[34:37] see it you know when you listen to
[34:39] people on the radio in and it for
[34:42] preachers they they preach that you must
[34:44] be going in which is fantastic they
[34:46] preach that you must be saved and that
[34:48] Redemption and those kind of things but
[34:50] that mystery that of a birth process and
[34:56] maturity Romans eight Ephesians 4:11 12
[34:59] all of those things that was lost this
[35:02] is the stone which was set at nought of
[35:04] you builders which has become the head
[35:06] of the corner and so Peters saying right
[35:09] there that he has a revelation that is
[35:11] appealing because Jos gonna build a
[35:15] church mitties he goes on to tell about
[35:19] his revelation of who Jesus Christ is
[35:20] and they Laurel and I need to
[35:22] acknowledge have been then that they had
[35:23] been with Jesus the faith of the fathers
[35:30] then Acts chapter four 31 32 when after
[35:33] they you know they feed her to Peter and
[35:35] then they went back and told the
[35:36] disciples what had happened to him and
[35:39] their faith was the giri's and then
[35:40] getting pray and when they had prayed
[35:42] the place was shaking where they
[35:44] they were all filled with the Holy Ghost
[35:45] and they spake the Word of God of the
[35:47] bonus and the multitude of him that
[35:50] believed were of one heart and of one
[35:52] soul neither said any of them that offer
[35:56] the things which he possessed it was his
[35:58] only but they had all things coming
[36:02] I think that's one example that really
[36:06] these each of these virtues is not for
[36:09] the person so much as for others virtue
[36:13] is to give out temperance is dealing
[36:17] with other patients that you can you
[36:21] deal with other people get a hold up to
[36:24] brotherly kindness and you're laying
[36:26] down yourself for other people like
[36:29] we'll see here they lay down there all
[36:31] their goods for other people they just
[36:33] took they sold the property and laid it
[36:35] out so that other people could have
[36:37] subsistence customers over or you know
[36:39] have something to live on they had all
[36:41] things in common because they were
[36:42] loving one another they were there was a
[36:46] real one of the King from believing the
[36:50] Word of God and they were all you know
[36:52] who seems like even in the message today
[36:55] there's a lot of division and everything
[36:57] still but I believe that once uniting
[37:01] the bride together what will unite us
[37:04] together is the Word of God because it
[37:07] will bring us to get you know on the day
[37:09] of Pentecost when in acts 2:38 they were
[37:12] even one Accord but when the spirit fell
[37:15] like quicken that word there was no
[37:17] wasn't no division or anything they went
[37:19] out on the street and they were they
[37:21] were all unwanted for believing the same
[37:23] thing now we went unexpressed things the
[37:25] same way but we're coming to the same
[37:29] the same razor-edge faith which is what
[37:33] this represents all the way down holding
[37:36] and word ever Blanc and the pyramid fits
[37:39] together just perfectly we can to stick
[37:41] a razor head all the way down till it's
[37:44] home together at the very top just
[37:46] just raise your feet so that we're all
[37:49] coming together to it to one heart one
[37:52] soul
[37:53] loving one another loving God and back
[37:59] to the original faint fathers just like
[38:01] they do not not in any mature people
[38:06] what a mightier matures God
[38:14] going back
[38:25] I hope not
[38:28] if you're going like the Pentecostal
[38:30] denomination then that that that
[38:32] wouldn't at all be a bad situation why
[38:42] they didn't clinic up that could be is
[38:48] hard to say what I all I can say is what
[38:53] I believe that we're going back to the
[38:56] to the original doc last lesson 1
[38:59] milligram who said the original doctor
[39:01] in a regional faith the original worker
[39:03] that they held back me
[39:04] so that's because that original doctor
[39:09] the original face will produce the
[39:12] original life will take things right
[39:15] back to the way it was back then and
[39:22] then I'm gonna finish on this with
[39:25] because you know I I think sometimes we
[39:28] get something saying going up the
[39:30] doctrinal illness but the doctor will
[39:33] produce something in like it'll produce
[39:36] a cure the characteristic of Christ and
[39:39] that's what the face of the poverty is
[39:40] the face of the Father says God
[39:42] manifests that in the end people just
[39:45] the same way as he was banging like like
[39:48] this example of Stephen and they stone
[39:50] Stephen called upon God to say Lord
[39:52] Jesus receive my spirit and he kneeled
[39:54] down and cried with a loud voice Lord
[39:58] not this sin to their charge now that's
[40:00] got to be a characteristic of Christ Oh
[40:03] to have somebody knocked in the head
[40:05] with rocks until Bloods coming out of
[40:08] his nose oh oh you know it was a Ben
[40:10] stone that was a gruesome death because
[40:12] you being killed by rocks and somebody
[40:15] being killed in that manner the crowd
[40:16] more forgiving most people would want
[40:20] vengeance or whatever then they want
[40:22] somebody to avenge my death
[40:24] that would be the the carnal natural
[40:27] response of me but this man had
[40:30] displayed the same characteristic of
[40:31] Jesus dying on the cross they said
[40:34] Father forgive well they know not what
[40:36] they do Lauren lay not this sin to their
[40:38] charge and that to me is the faith of
[40:40] the fathers I'm going to stop right
[40:42] there but the faith of the father's it
[40:43] is the same characteristics being
[40:45] displayed in you that were displayed
[40:47] back there because the same word that
[40:50] they do you now feel hope and the reason
[40:55] that you hold it is the cost of let me
[40:59] let me let me just give you a quick
[41:01] summary reason that they had to face the
[41:04] father's is because that the headstone
[41:07] was bad that they had stone as Christ
[41:09] himself he was there walking on the
[41:11] shores of Galilee teaching them for
[41:13] three and a half years telling them
[41:14] things so that when the spirit fell on
[41:16] the day of Pentecost they already had
[41:17] all that water now so what what's gonna
[41:20] what would take you back to the faith of
[41:22] the fathers the faith of the fathers
[41:23] would have to come that's what
[41:27] loneliness is that the little one
[41:29] himself with the scene with a shout the
[41:33] voice and and so forth
[41:35] the Lord Himself will come upon the
[41:39] scene and bring a message they had stone
[41:41] himself that's what that big cloud that
[41:44] we did have a little wall signifies is
[41:45] that God Himself came with a message to
[41:48] bring us back to the full Word of God
[41:51] southern that original life could be
[41:53] manifest in his people and now this is a
[41:56] long drawn-out Sunday School lesson
[42:06] [Music]
