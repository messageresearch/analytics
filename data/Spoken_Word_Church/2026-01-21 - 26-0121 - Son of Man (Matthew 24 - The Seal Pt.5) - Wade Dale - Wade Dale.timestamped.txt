[0:01] They resound
[0:03] with God's [singing] own heart. Oh, let
[0:07] the word of God
[0:09] impart. [music] And word of God,
[0:14] it's ever true,
[0:16] changing me, [music]
[0:19] changing you.
[0:21] We have come [music] with open [singing]
[0:24] hearts. Oh, let the word of God impart.
[0:30] [music and singing]
[0:31] Amen. I want my part.
[0:34] &gt;&gt; You want your part? You came here
[0:35] tonight expecting you'll get your part.
[0:37] Yes, sir.
[0:38] &gt;&gt; Cuz that's what it says, the word of God
[0:40] impart. He's going to impart to you what
[0:43] you want tonight. You will get exactly
[0:46] what you want tonight. If you come
[0:49] expecting, as we were speaking on last
[0:50] week, you will get you're going to get
[0:52] something one way or the other.
[0:54] Like brother Ram said, you can stand in
[0:56] the presence of an eternal person and
[0:57] you'll never be the same. So you'll
[1:00] never ever be the same.
[1:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:02] &gt;&gt; And good to be in the house of the Lord.
[1:03] Good to have each and every one of you
[1:04] here. Um let's be mindful of the weather
[1:08] coming up this weekend. Um we'll be in
[1:11] contact with you on Saturday. We're
[1:12] going to wait and see and just pray that
[1:15] uh if we do get anything, I hope it's
[1:17] not ice. I'm just going to pray it ain't
[1:19] ice. I don't care if we get snow, but I
[1:21] sure don't want ice cuz it's going to
[1:22] tear every every power line we got down.
[1:25] So, just be prepared though. Get you
[1:27] some flashlights, get you some water. Uh
[1:30] get you some warm clothes out and you
[1:32] may have to pile up together and and
[1:35] stay warm. It's what brother Anderson
[1:36] they were going to do. They just going
[1:37] to pile up in a pile and stay warm. So,
[1:42] I think he would probably be the one
[1:44] that would would not get the benefit
[1:45] because most of him would be out of the
[1:47] pile as tall as he is. So, but but just
[1:51] use use wisdom. Uh we'll call and let
[1:54] you know um Saturday about Sunday. We're
[1:58] not going to uh um we're not going to
[2:01] get out if it's bad. And uh we will uh
[2:05] uh brother Emanuel will be speaking for
[2:08] us next Wednesday,
[2:10] this coming Wednesday, a week from
[2:11] today. Uh the banquet. Now, if you're
[2:14] bringing somebody with you, I want you
[2:16] to sign up downstairs, but put beside
[2:18] you who you are bringing with you. All
[2:21] right? Who you're bringing with you.
[2:24] Okay? Um, and February the 11th is the
[2:28] cutoff [clears throat] date. Anna, that
[2:30] should be enough time to
[2:33] well, 10 days. So, February the 11th
[2:35] will be that Wednesday night will be the
[2:37] cut off date of who's coming and who's
[2:39] not coming because we need to get the
[2:41] caterer ready. Anna and them have to buy
[2:44] um plates, napkins, forks, and all the
[2:46] things that they get and uh and see how
[2:49] many will be there for the games and
[2:50] prizes. I know the Ohio group's excited.
[2:53] They're watching in tonight. So, God
[2:55] bless you up there in in sunny, warm
[2:58] Ohio with about a foot of snow on the
[3:00] ground. So, uh but they move around with
[3:03] a foot of snow. We don't move around
[3:05] with a foot of snow down here. Our inch
[3:08] is like their foot. You know, [snorts]
[3:09] we get an inch, we shut everything down.
[3:11] But they're watching in tonight. They're
[3:13] going to start watching in as I said
[3:14] before when we start our series on the
[3:16] seals. And we're going to um they're
[3:19] going to uh to watch online. And uh and
[3:23] I pray that the Lord will give us
[3:24] something uh because it's a late hour.
[3:27] We we we got to get this thing right. If
[3:29] we don't get it right, we're going to
[3:30] still just be here and we're just going
[3:32] to keep getting older. We're just going
[3:34] to keep getting weaker. and and we're
[3:36] going to uh uh we just got to take the
[3:39] promise that God gave us
[3:42] &gt;&gt; and we got to hold on to it.
[3:44] &gt;&gt; Hold on to it to the bitter end. We're
[3:46] going to hold on to it. I know there's
[3:48] going to be a group of people that's
[3:49] going to Brother Brandham would have
[3:51] wasted his time if somebody don't make
[3:53] this thing come to pass.
[3:57] 1100 sermons, the whole man's life, his
[4:00] death
[4:02] &gt;&gt; will be worthless if somebody don't come
[4:05] and and bring to fruition what he said
[4:08] &gt;&gt; cuz he was a prophet of God. So being a
[4:11] prophet of God, I can tell you thus
[4:13] sayith the Lord, there will be a group
[4:15] of people that will take this thing on
[4:17] to the coming of the Lord. Somebody's
[4:18] going to stand on the earth and say,
[4:20] "Death, where's your sting?
[4:22] &gt;&gt; Grave, where's your victory? We're not
[4:24] going to it. That's
[4:25] &gt;&gt; right.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that, too, brother. I
[4:27] do, too. So, let's turn in our Bibles.
[4:29] Let's start. We're going to be a little
[4:31] bit more on on We got to get through
[4:33] Matthew 24 before we get started. But,
[4:35] there's a little something else I want
[4:36] to bring in. Uh, you need to make sure
[4:39] you read or or listen to Christ is the
[4:43] mystery of God revealed. I know that's a
[4:46] that's kind of a long sermon, but well,
[4:48] you'll watch an movie for three hours.
[4:50] So, you ought to be able to to listen to
[4:52] a sermon that'll that's one of the
[4:53] greatest sermons brother Brandon
[4:55] preached.
[4:57] &gt;&gt; And he said, if you don't understand the
[4:59] seals, come back to that that message
[5:01] right there. So, that message right
[5:03] there then is the keystone. So, if you
[5:05] don't understand this, you got to come
[5:07] to understand the Christ the mystery.
[5:09] Now, listen. What is Christ the mystery
[5:10] of God revealed in a nutshell? Brother
[5:12] Brandham is giving this in a three-fold
[5:15] manner. All God was, he poured into
[5:17] Christ. All Christ was, he poured into
[5:19] the church. Take her back to the Garden
[5:21] of Eden. That's the three-fold purpose
[5:23] that God has. So, you can melt every bit
[5:25] of this down to those three things. And
[5:28] we got to look and see that threes are
[5:30] very important even in the seals because
[5:33] the sixth seal come in a three-fold
[5:35] three-fold manner. The seventh seal come
[5:37] in a three-fold manner. But we'll
[5:38] understand that a little bit later on.
[5:40] Now what does you mean by unfold there
[5:42] was something came up like this right
[5:44] here you have brother Ram said I saw one
[5:46] fold of it but I didn't see the next
[5:48] one. So God was showing him this then
[5:52] God showed him this and he didn't
[5:53] understand it then he understood it
[5:54] later because I believe he understood it
[5:56] when he preached Christ is the mystery
[5:58] of God revealed. Amen. So we're going to
[6:02] um start on that. Uh remember that this
[6:06] may take a little time, but we're going
[6:09] to try to keep it slow so everybody can
[6:12] understand because listen folks, this is
[6:15] important.
[6:18] &gt;&gt; Uh you can shout, speak in tongues,
[6:20] raise the dead, heal the sick. That's
[6:22] okay. That's been done for 2,000 years.
[6:26] &gt;&gt; And what has it produced?
[6:29] Not a rapture.
[6:31] Not a resurrection. Not yet. said it
[6:33] hadn't. No,
[6:34] &gt;&gt; but this will.
[6:36] &gt;&gt; So, this is going to produce a
[6:38] resurrection and a rapture.
[6:41] &gt;&gt; So, let's turn to first Corinthians 2:9.
[6:44] Just remember all these things. Thank
[6:46] you again this past weekend for
[6:48] everybody participating and bringing
[6:50] food. Brother Daryl said he had a
[6:51] wonderful time. He got home in time this
[6:54] time for they're expecting all 2 feet of
[6:57] snow up there on Saturday and Sunday, 24
[7:00] plus inches. So, praise God, we live a
[7:03] little bit lower in South than they do.
[7:05] Whoa, that's a lot. Even for them,
[7:07] that's a lot. So, just remember, God is
[7:10] perfected in threes. We're going this is
[7:12] all going to be
[7:15] justification, sanctification, and
[7:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost because you
[7:17] can't go any you can't go any more than
[7:19] that. Sure, we got a four. We know that.
[7:21] But it's a it's the three put together.
[7:25] Luther had justification, so he couldn't
[7:27] go to perfection. Luther had
[7:29] sanctification. He took what uh Luther
[7:32] had. Wesley took what Luther had and he
[7:35] added it to it, but he had things that
[7:37] that were as brother Ram called them
[7:39] loose ends. Okay? Cuz I I'll I'll prove
[7:42] it to you in just a minute because the
[7:43] church really unraveled at Na. The
[7:46] doctrines fell apart. Everything fell
[7:48] apart at Na back in u 3:25 and 606 is
[7:52] where it really went into
[7:54] denominationalism. All right? And then
[7:57] all God then then you got the three all
[7:59] God was in poured in Christ Christ into
[8:01] the church and the same thing. Then you
[8:03] got sayings, deeds, and doctrine. So
[8:05] everything we're going to talk about in
[8:06] the seals is going to be pretty much in
[8:09] a three-fold manner. And I'll I'll tell
[8:11] you in just a few minutes because you
[8:13] need to watch this very closely. Are you
[8:16] listening?
[8:18] There is a natural opening of of that of
[8:21] those seals.
[8:23] But there is a spiritual opening of
[8:25] those seals that we it's to us.
[8:30] &gt;&gt; Not to the world, not to nobody else,
[8:31] not to o any other age but us.
[8:34] &gt;&gt; Okay? It's the only time that it could
[8:36] ever happen. But there's going to be a
[8:38] natural opening. There's going to be a
[8:40] tribulation period. There's going to be
[8:41] all these things, wars and rumors of
[8:42] wars. And we're going to see some of
[8:44] that, but we're not going to see all of
[8:45] it.
[8:46] &gt;&gt; Right. Right. because we're going to be
[8:47] ejected. I mean, we we go out of here on
[8:50] the fourth seal.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[8:51] &gt;&gt; All right. So, there's three more seals
[8:53] left, which are the sixth one is
[8:55] horrible. That's the tribulation period.
[8:56] We're not going to be there,
[8:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[8:59] &gt;&gt; But some people will be there.
[9:01] &gt;&gt; All right. So, you with me?
[9:03] &gt;&gt; So, that's what we're looking at. We're
[9:05] looking at the three-fold manner of
[9:07] everything opening, even the seals.
[9:11] All right. So, let's bow our heads just
[9:12] for a minute. Dear [clears throat] Lord,
[9:14] thank you for this day you've given us.
[9:16] [sighs] Lord, just settle us down and
[9:18] Lord, may we speak the words, Lord, that
[9:19] people understand. And Lord, may it be
[9:22] given as it was given to me, Lord, it
[9:24] was as I was writing these things down
[9:25] and and meditating the last few days,
[9:27] Lord, may it be given out to the people,
[9:29] Lord, in in such a simple form to till
[9:32] they'll understand it, Lord, because you
[9:34] gave it to us to understand. And if he
[9:36] gave it to us to understand, if there's
[9:38] a curriculum to the resurrection and a
[9:41] curriculum that takes that to the
[9:43] rapture, there's got to be a study book.
[9:46] There's got to be teachers. There's got
[9:48] to be schools that preach or churches
[9:52] that preach the true word of God. We're
[9:56] depending on that. Lord, the greatest
[9:58] miracle ever is, Lord, is for you to
[10:00] reveal yourself to somebody. Lord, I
[10:03] pray that you would do that tonight. If
[10:05] nobody if nobody hears it but one
[10:07] person, Father, I pray that that one
[10:08] person will get something tonight and
[10:10] will take it and make it a part of
[10:12] theirel and Lord live it as they should
[10:15] live it. Lord, I pray that you'd bless
[10:17] each one here, be with the ones that are
[10:18] sick. Lord, be with us this weekend.
[10:20] Father, that if we do have the storm
[10:22] coming in that it'll it'll be just
[10:24] light, Lord, and it won't be so bad and
[10:26] nobody will be hurt. Lord, I know
[10:28] there's going to be people got to work
[10:30] and and first responders and and and
[10:32] ambulance and all the they have to work.
[10:34] Police officers, Lord, I pray that you'd
[10:37] protect them, Lord. They have to be out
[10:38] there. That's their job. But I pray that
[10:40] you'd protect them, Father. Just be with
[10:42] us. Lead us and guide us by your Holy
[10:44] Spirit in Jesus name. Amen. 1
[10:46] Corinthians 2:9 says, "But as is
[10:48] written, I have not seen nor ear heard,
[10:51] neither have entered into the heart of
[10:52] man the things which God hath prepared
[10:54] for them what that love him." So there's
[10:56] a stipulation for them that love him.
[10:59] All right? And you can only love God
[11:00] how? By the new birth. That's the only
[11:03] way you can love God. There's people say
[11:05] they love God, but if they don't have
[11:07] the new birth, they're just it's just
[11:09] words.
[11:10] &gt;&gt; It's more of a it's more of a filio love
[11:12] than it is an agape love. All right?
[11:16] That's why we had to have a prophet that
[11:18] preached agape love, had agape love,
[11:20] preached agape love. And listen, there
[11:21] had to be a group of people
[11:24] that's got agape love to understand that
[11:27] love.
[11:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:28] &gt;&gt; That brother Brandham gave every
[11:30] everything brother Brandham preached to
[11:31] us was was love. It was the love of God
[11:33] that brought that to me and you.
[11:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And grace that we heard it
[11:38] &gt;&gt; and responded. A lot of people heard it
[11:40] and didn't respond.
[11:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:41] &gt;&gt; But God hath revealed them unto us by
[11:44] his spirit. Now, what is revealed?
[11:45] Something's hidden and then it's going
[11:46] to be made known. All right? by his
[11:49] spirit searchth all things for the
[11:51] spirit, the deep things of God, even the
[11:54] inmost depths of God's being. You may be
[11:56] seated. Brother Daryl uh touched on it.
[11:59] It's why I was going back to Christ the
[12:00] Mystery where brother Random said he
[12:02] said, "Let's go back into the back part
[12:04] of God's mind and see what his plan and
[12:07] purpose was." Because without a plan and
[12:09] a purpose, even God himself, as as
[12:13] eternal and perfect as he is, he had a
[12:15] plan. and that plan was going to be
[12:18] achieved because God can't do anything
[12:21] and it not come to pass. All right? So,
[12:24] we we're going to depend on that. We're
[12:26] going to depend that if that depend on
[12:28] the the word of God that if we hear it
[12:31] and we apply it. I was thinking just a a
[12:34] few minutes ago and and please don't get
[12:36] me wrong. Please don't get me wrong, but
[12:40] we should not be preaching life lessons
[12:43] at the moment.
[12:46] Come on. I mean, we have to to the ones
[12:49] that just came in, but a lot of y'all
[12:51] I'm sitting here sitting here now been
[12:52] here a long long time.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; We shouldn't have to go over and talk
[12:55] about hair and dress and and coming to
[12:57] church and all that. We We got to move
[12:59] on to perfection.
[13:01] &gt;&gt; Okay. We've got to have and we've got to
[13:03] be students that want to learn,
[13:05] &gt;&gt; students that want to know what God's
[13:08] got for us. Then the only way it's going
[13:10] to happen is is you are going to have to
[13:12] get it through somebody that preaches
[13:16] the word of God.
[13:17] &gt;&gt; There's no other way around it.
[13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:19] &gt;&gt; Listen, let's don't be too hard on the
[13:22] people that press play because we press
[13:24] play.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; Right.
[13:27] &gt;&gt; We're tape church, bro. Every 30
[13:30] minutes, every sermon, we we play tape.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; So, we're covered.
[13:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But the way they have it is though
[13:37] that's the only way you're going to get
[13:38] it is to listen to a tape. Now that's
[13:40] not true.
[13:41] &gt;&gt; That is not true. You got to hear it.
[13:44] The Bible says through the foolishness
[13:45] of preaching. God has ordained a group
[13:47] of people a five-fold ministry to bring
[13:49] us to perfection. Amen.
[13:52] &gt;&gt; So that's what we're going to do. We're
[13:53] going to strive and try our best all the
[13:55] ministry. And even [clears throat] you
[13:57] ley have got a job to do.
[13:59] &gt;&gt; True.
[14:00] &gt;&gt; Like brother Daryl said, you know, this
[14:03] is important. And if it's cut off, it
[14:05] you can really tell it's important if it
[14:06] gets cut off. Even your little toe on
[14:08] your on your foot.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; So, we're going to from now till we
[14:13] finish this, we're going to try to break
[14:16] it down so that we can all understand
[14:18] that
[14:20] when somebody says seals,
[14:23] we think of full redemption.
[14:26] &gt;&gt; All right? We've had redemption.
[14:29] Okay? We've had redemption since uh
[14:33] before the foundation of the world, but
[14:34] since the day of Pentecost when God went
[14:37] in 120 people and restored them back,
[14:42] put eternal life in their soul and
[14:44] restored them to where they should have
[14:45] been. Okay. But not their bodies.
[14:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[14:51] &gt;&gt; God's got to work on the body. The body
[14:53] of Adam is what fell. The body of Eve is
[14:56] what fell. They did not fall in their
[14:58] soul, but they got twisted and trapped
[15:02] and did what they did because Satan is
[15:05] the greatest trapper. And as one brother
[15:09] said one time, he's the best tripper
[15:10] upper there is. And he is.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; He knows He knows your weakness
[15:18] &gt;&gt; sometimes more than you do because
[15:19] sometimes he has to do something to show
[15:21] you your weakness. But you know what?
[15:23] God uses that.
[15:26] God uses the devil all the time to show
[15:28] us our weaknesses. Like I said before,
[15:30] the the the
[15:33] what was it? The 200,000,000 demons in
[15:35] the river Euphrates were loosed on um
[15:38] and Hitler. Well, who loosed them? You
[15:39] say, "Well, the devil did." The devil
[15:41] don't have no power to do that. God had
[15:44] to allow that to happen. God's the only
[15:46] one that's got the key to death and
[15:47] hell.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; He's the only one that's got the key to
[15:50] the devil's house. So God released him
[15:52] because brother Ram continues with that
[15:54] statement. It says and has been released
[15:56] on an end time bride to do what? Drive
[15:59] her back to her homeland.
[16:01] &gt;&gt; And what is our homeland? The seals in a
[16:05] group of people.
[16:09] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[16:11] &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's read this quote.
[16:15] The mystery will be revealed in the last
[16:17] day when the seventh angel's message,
[16:19] not when he starts out doing this. Now,
[16:23] what are we saying? It was not brother
[16:25] Ram 1947. That was not the seventh
[16:28] angel's message.
[16:30] Everybody with me?
[16:32] &gt;&gt; That was not his message.
[16:34] It was according to one scripture.
[16:37] Malachi 4 was to return the hearts back.
[16:40] But remember, brother Brown brings in
[16:42] Revelations 10:7, which brings the voice
[16:46] of the seventh angel messenger. Now, in
[16:49] a bride called or John comes into John
[16:52] and then John prophesy. So, that's the
[16:54] way it's supposed to be. [clears throat]
[16:56] That's what he said.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brown, listen, I'll I'll be
[17:00] real specific. Brother Brown's message
[17:02] began when he said, "Here stands a lamb
[17:06] with a book in his hand, and there goes
[17:08] a wild horse rider. Therefore, that must
[17:10] be the antichrist. That's when his
[17:12] message started. That's when the thunder
[17:14] shouted. That's when the third pull
[17:17] began.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; That's when his real message began. That
[17:20] was the headstone message that had been
[17:22] sealed since Calvary.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; Right there in that week, Brother Ram
[17:29] said, "I've never worked under a greater
[17:31] anointing than this week." Now, he's
[17:32] seen thousands healed. He's seen
[17:34] thousands upon thousands of people,
[17:36] hundreds raised from the dead. He seen
[17:38] mighty miracles. He said, "I've never
[17:40] worked in what?" The opening of the word
[17:42] is the greatest anointing you could ever
[17:43] have.
[17:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, G, Brother Ram said, Jesus's
[17:47] greatest anointing was what? I read it
[17:49] to you last Sunday. Was when he opened
[17:51] the book and identified, come on,
[17:52] somebody. He identified WHO HE WAS.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO IDENTIFY WHO WE ARE. YOU'RE
[17:58] GOING to
[17:59] &gt;&gt; identify who you are.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; You either going to be sealed in or
[18:03] sealed out. And it's going to be up to
[18:04] you to do it. Amen.
[18:10] &gt;&gt; But when he begins to sound his message,
[18:13] see, not the years in preparation. Now,
[18:16] a long time ago, there was a group of
[18:18] people that said, "Well, we're not going
[18:19] to take any quotes before 1963. We're
[18:22] just going to take quotes from 63 to 65
[18:25] when he died." Well, now that's pretty
[18:27] narrow-minded. That means that we're
[18:29] going to just read the New Testament and
[18:30] not the Old.
[18:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. because it's old.
[18:35] &gt;&gt; No. From 47 to 63, Brother Brandham, as
[18:39] good as he could, he brought and set a
[18:41] stage to build on it the message that he
[18:44] was supposed to bring.
[18:46] &gt;&gt; All right.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; That's why that's why God didn't just
[18:50] start the taping in 1963.
[18:54] He started the tape in 1947.
[18:58] &gt;&gt; Or he wouldn't have needed it. He needed
[19:00] it. We all needed it. So you can't throw
[19:02] those out. You've got to have those for
[19:05] a background. That's why all this has
[19:07] been background, background, background,
[19:08] background.
[19:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:11] &gt;&gt; But we must come to a time to where that
[19:13] those backgrounds
[19:15] are behind us.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; Know where you stand. Know who you are.
[19:20] Know what kind of [clears throat] know
[19:22] what kind of position you're in right
[19:24] now
[19:25] &gt;&gt; because it's an individual affair with
[19:27] God. That's why you're going to see
[19:28] you're going to see people that are that
[19:30] are going to deny and well they already
[19:32] are denying the message.
[19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:35] &gt;&gt; Why are they denying the message?
[19:36] Because I don't know if this is a word
[19:39] or not. The denier is in them.
[19:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[19:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; Cuz you and I don't deny this message.
[19:47] Well, then the deni the denier the what
[19:50] are we? We're believers.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; They think they're believers,
[19:55] &gt;&gt; but they're unbelievers.
[19:57] are mate believers.
[19:58] &gt;&gt; But the mate believers are going to be
[20:00] exposed because they will because
[20:02] remember to to be the mate believer is
[20:05] pretty much like the foolish virgin.
[20:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; Only going to come so far. Think they
[20:10] got it already and God's going to say,
[20:11] "No, you stopped right here." Everybody
[20:13] with me?
[20:14] &gt;&gt; All right. But they were virgin. So they
[20:16] were Christians to a point.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; All right. You can't de Christianize
[20:21] them. But they didn't get the new birth
[20:22] or they'd go in the rapture.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. They got to give their life,
[20:26] brother Ryan said, for the gospel in the
[20:28] tribulation period because
[20:30] [clears throat] they weren't fully. You
[20:31] and I right now, if you're born again,
[20:33] you're sealed in. There is no
[20:36] tribulation.
[20:37] &gt;&gt; There is no white throne judgment.
[20:40] &gt;&gt; Like I said before, those are two of the
[20:42] greatest two of the greatest revelations
[20:44] you'll ever get is if you'll strive to
[20:47] get born again here, you got a free
[20:49] ride. A free ride to the future home.
[20:54] Amen. Now,
[20:56] &gt;&gt; I didn't say it was a good ride. I said
[20:58] it was a free ride.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; Because with this thing still attached,
[21:01] it's a bumpy ride.
[21:03] &gt;&gt; All right.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; So, see, not the years in preparation,
[21:06] but when he begins to sound the message,
[21:09] these mysteries then will be revealed.
[21:11] Now, watch. And here they are,
[21:15] not knowing them, and you people are a
[21:17] witness of it.
[21:19] So, we go to Luke 17:30. Even thus shall
[21:21] it be in the day when the son of man is
[21:24] revealed.
[21:26] Uh brother Richard Wilson and I we were
[21:28] discussing this. There's there and and
[21:29] and sorry to say [clears throat] there's
[21:33] a lot of people a lot of people in the
[21:34] message do not understand the ministry
[21:37] of the son of man because they're stuck
[21:39] in the son of god revelation which is
[21:42] truly the new birth. It has nothing I
[21:43] mean has nothing to do with eternal life
[21:45] but we're coming to a place where I want
[21:47] a body change. I don't want to have to
[21:49] go through death. I don't want to have
[21:51] to to to uh be be in another dimension
[21:54] and come back here. I want to be right
[21:55] here.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; I want to be full. I want to fulfill
[21:59] what the Bible said. We which are alive
[22:01] and remain.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:04] &gt;&gt; That's a little word, but it has a lot
[22:06] involved when it says we which are alive
[22:08] and remain.
[22:10] &gt;&gt; That doesn't just mean [clears throat]
[22:12] we as anybody. I just happen to be
[22:15] there. No, you didn't just happen to be
[22:16] there.
[22:20] So one more time, the difference in what
[22:22] the son of God ministry is the church
[22:24] ages, God as the Holy Ghost dwelling in
[22:28] a group of people that have sometimes
[22:32] have flaws in their doctrine. Is
[22:35] everybody with me?
[22:37] &gt;&gt; Luther was born again. He was under the
[22:40] son of God revelation, but he taught a
[22:43] trinity.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; He taught a lot of the Catholic church
[22:48] things. He taught exactly what they had.
[22:50] But God wasn't looking at that at the
[22:53] moment. He was looking at Luther said,
[22:56] "The just shall live by faith."
[23:00] Faith. Believers. Become believers. Not
[23:03] believers in the pope or believers in
[23:05] the priest. Be believers in yourself.
[23:08] &gt;&gt; That's what you and I got to do. Be
[23:09] believers in oursel.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:14] But when the son of man is revealed,
[23:16] that means that God has immorphied
[23:19] himself in his last position before the
[23:23] change of the body, which is, now
[23:26] listen, which is the same three and one
[23:29] half years that Jesus preached on this
[23:31] earth.
[23:33] Okay? The same ministry. What is the
[23:36] ministry of Jesus Christ? perfection,
[23:41] &gt;&gt; resurrection,
[23:43] &gt;&gt; body change,
[23:44] &gt;&gt; rapture,
[23:46] because the son of man did all thosemen.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; But remember, he couldn't come back as
[23:51] the son of man because remember the son
[23:53] of man is the headstone. He's the
[23:55] perfect one,
[23:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[23:58] &gt;&gt; He didn't need to be told what to do. He
[24:00] didn't need to get himself cleaned up.
[24:03] &gt;&gt; But we do. That's why I say when we come
[24:06] to the son of man ministry, you can't
[24:09] sit and fight over little doctrines
[24:11] because there when Jesus was here, there
[24:13] was no doctrine. I I'll bring it to you
[24:15] when we start on the seals. Brother Ram
[24:17] said the first three ages, they had the
[24:19] pure unadulterated word of God.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; But that third age ended in 325 AD. And
[24:25] you know what happened?
[24:26] &gt;&gt; Or 606, one of the two. But you know
[24:28] what happened? It went back to Na. And
[24:31] they absolutely the church unraveled
[24:34] at Nia Rome
[24:36] &gt;&gt; under the weight of the devil bringing
[24:39] false doctrine in. But listen, God had
[24:42] to allow that because he said a corn and
[24:44] wheat had to fall fall into the ground
[24:46] and die
[24:48] before it could come up to fruition
[24:50] because the seed
[24:52] has to be planted. But that seed has to
[24:55] come through a plant
[24:58] &gt;&gt; to make itself again.
[24:59] &gt;&gt; Right? Right?
[25:00] &gt;&gt; You can't just put a seed in and then
[25:02] and then all of a sudden a seed pops up.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; No, you plant a seed and then the two
[25:08] stock then the two ears, the stock, the
[25:11] shuck, the tassel, it comes on out to
[25:13] the full ear corn, which is what? It's
[25:15] that it's that seed.
[25:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; Matured.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; That seed has matured itself. And you
[25:22] can take that if it's not hybrid, you
[25:24] can take that seed and put it in the
[25:27] ground and it'll bring another one
[25:28] forth. That's right.
[25:30] &gt;&gt; That's why you and I, the seeds been
[25:32] planted in our heart. We bring forth
[25:34] whatever whatever position we want to be
[25:36] in. We can um you know, I sometimes I
[25:39] look in my garden back when we had one
[25:42] and and you know, some of the corn was
[25:44] Charlotte. Some of the corn be this
[25:46] high. I plant them all at the same time.
[25:48] Some will be this high, some be this
[25:49] high, some be this high. Plant them at
[25:51] the same time.
[25:53] Right?
[25:54] &gt;&gt; If you've ever done a garden that way,
[25:56] you know that some come to fruition
[25:57] before others. Why? It was where you
[26:00] planted it, how much fertilizer that you
[26:02] give it, how much sunlight. It had to be
[26:04] in a position to draw those nutrients
[26:07] out of the ground and grow.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; But they all had the same opportunity
[26:11] when the seed went in the ground.
[26:13] &gt;&gt; So the seed is being planted now. The
[26:15] seed word of God is being planted in the
[26:17] hearts of the believers. And what are we
[26:20] bringing forth? Are we bringing forth a
[26:22] a crop that that is um not 100%? Are we
[26:26] bringing 30fold, 60fold? What are we
[26:28] bringing?
[26:29] &gt;&gt; Ain't that what the Bible said about the
[26:30] sword of the seed?
[26:32] &gt;&gt; Right?
[26:33] &gt;&gt; I want to be that. That 100% will be the
[26:35] bride that takes a body change.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; That 100% is because remember Jesus was
[26:41] referring to himself.
[26:43] Cornwheat must go on the ground and die.
[26:45] What? Jesus had to go on the ground,
[26:47] die, be buried to resurrect. And he was
[26:51] the whole plant. He was he he was the
[26:53] one that when the era of cornorn came
[26:55] out and there's ever how many brides you
[26:57] going to be that's how many was on that
[26:58] earorn
[27:00] &gt;&gt; and then he took every during every
[27:02] church age and when he when he come to
[27:03] you and and give you the new birth he
[27:05] took and planted that seed right there
[27:08] &gt;&gt; and listen if the seed in the ground was
[27:10] eternal
[27:14] &gt;&gt; you can't change it
[27:17] &gt;&gt; if that seed was eternal when it was
[27:18] planted
[27:21] boy didn't look like it was Jesus was
[27:22] eternal, folks, except for his body.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; But when that seed was planted, the what
[27:28] happened? A seed's got to rot.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; His body didn't rotten. You understand
[27:33] what I'm saying? But it had to be pulled
[27:35] away from the life
[27:38] &gt;&gt; so that it can come back up on Easter
[27:39] morning or resurrection morning.
[27:43] &gt;&gt; But what he done, he became, he was a f
[27:45] fully matured plant.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:49] And you and I are the recipients of that
[27:53] planting of one man in 2,000 years ago
[27:56] called Jesus Christ.
[27:58] &gt;&gt; But that's an expectation of what's got
[28:01] to happen now.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Now
[28:05] &gt;&gt; got to happen the same thing,
[28:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[28:08] &gt;&gt; Because when Jesus came out of the
[28:10] grave, his body was eternal. His spirit
[28:12] and soul was already eternal, but his
[28:14] body became eternal because it went
[28:16] through a process. But remember that
[28:18] process was for me and you.
[28:21] &gt;&gt; That's why you keep reading Christ, the
[28:23] mystery of God revealed. Get on back
[28:24] there a little bit further in the back.
[28:25] He talks again about being the sinless
[28:28] bride of Jesus Christ. Nothing held
[28:30] against us. Not one speck held against
[28:33] us.
[28:37] &gt;&gt; Listen, God decided to forget your sins.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm happy as I can be.
[28:47] that my sins is not following me
[28:49] anywhere.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; Now, if I sin a sin, absolutely, it will
[28:53] follow me wherever I go.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; That's why you got to get it right.
[28:58] That's why you got to even even taking
[29:01] communion and stuff. You got to have
[29:02] your heart right.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; If your heart's not right, then it's not
[29:06] going to do you any good. And only one
[29:08] person knows the heart. That's you and
[29:10] him.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:14] &gt;&gt; You and God. It's not you and your wife.
[29:15] and God is you and God.
[29:18] Everybody with me?
[29:21] &gt;&gt; So when the son of man is revealed,
[29:23] well, now remember,
[29:25] [clears throat] you have to keep these
[29:26] points in mind. Jesus, the son of man,
[29:29] will not stand on this earth until the
[29:31] millennium
[29:33] &gt;&gt; physically the man, flesh man, right?
[29:35] Everybody with me?
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Flesh man. So we're not talking about
[29:38] the son of man coming back and him
[29:40] walking through like the shores of
[29:42] Galilee.
[29:44] One more time. He decided not to do
[29:47] that.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; He decided to
[29:51] Come on, SOMEBODY. HE DECIDED NOT TO
[29:53] WALK ALONE AGAIN.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; HE WANTED SOMEBODY TO UNDERSTAND HIM.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; SO, HE TOOK A PART OF HIMSELF AND PUT IT
[30:00] INSIDE OF EVERY BELIEVER SO THAT WE CAN
[30:02] UNDERSTAND HIM.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND GOD WITHOUT THE
[30:09] HOLY GHOST. The Bible tells us that.
[30:11] Amen.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; You can't call Jesus the Christ except
[30:13] by the Holy Ghost.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[30:18] &gt;&gt; All right. So, this is just laying a
[30:20] foundation, the background.
[30:23] But you got to expect something. We were
[30:24] talking about expectation the other day.
[30:26] Anxious and persistent. Looking for
[30:28] something. You got to be looking for
[30:29] something.
[30:31] I'm looking for
[30:34] I'm looking for something that's going
[30:35] to change my body.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; All right. Everybody with me? So now
[30:40] we're going to come in. We're going to
[30:42] start here real quick
[30:44] and we're going to start reading in
[30:46] Matthew 24
[30:48] and read where Jesus
[30:51] they asked him three questions. [snorts]
[30:53] Okay, there's your number three again.
[30:56] And Jesus went out and departed from the
[30:57] temple and his disciples came to him for
[31:00] to show him the buildings of the temple.
[31:02] Now remember, look at me. Jesus was
[31:05] spiritual and natural.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; All his disciples were natural.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; They were not thinking spiritual.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; They weren't even thinking spiritual
[31:18] when they saw him resurrect
[31:20] and ascend. Are you going to restore the
[31:22] kingdom now?
[31:25] I'm sure G Jesus I mean he had a lot of
[31:27] patience because I'd have been going.
[31:30] Well, finally one day he said, "Peter,
[31:31] have I not been so long with you? Have I
[31:33] not been so long with you people to know
[31:35] what's going on?" But they didn't. They
[31:37] didn't have the Holy Ghost. That's
[31:38] right.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; But my once they got the Holy Ghost,
[31:41] that's why they were a powerful group of
[31:42] people in those first church ages. They
[31:44] took what they had and held on to it.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; They didn't have a recorder. They had to
[31:49] think about it in their head. They
[31:50] couldn't get it muddled up with the
[31:52] cares of life.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; And his disciples came to show the
[31:56] building of the temple. Jesus said unto
[31:59] them, "See you not all these things?
[32:01] Verily I say unto you, there shall not
[32:02] be left here one stone upon another that
[32:05] shall not be thrown down."
[32:07] Now they're looking at this huge temple
[32:09] that's 10 times the size of this
[32:10] building, three or four times as high.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; That's Solomon's temple. That's where
[32:16] God is supposed to meet them.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; Right?
[32:20] Jesus said it's going to be leveled to
[32:22] nothing, destroyed.
[32:26] And as he sat upon the mount of olives,
[32:28] the disciples came unto him privately
[32:30] and says, "Tell us when shall these
[32:32] things be? and what shall be the sign of
[32:34] thy coming and of the end of the world?
[32:37] They were expecting something to happen,
[32:39] but they were expecting it to happen
[32:41] right then.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; All right? It did not happen right then.
[32:46] That's why of the 500 people that met
[32:48] him after his resurrection, only 120
[32:51] stayed with him and had the revelation
[32:53] that he was going to come back on the
[32:55] day of Pentecost inside of their in
[32:57] their heart.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; All right.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; So, we've got to be expecting something.
[33:01] And and as I said, I got a little ahead
[33:03] of myself.
[33:05] When we read this, there is a natural
[33:09] happening. Jesus is going to tell us in
[33:10] a few minutes, there's these natural
[33:13] things are going to happen.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; All right. Right?
[33:17] &gt;&gt; But there's a spiritual application that
[33:19] you and I have got to get because
[33:21] remember if Jesus if we're supposed to
[33:23] have the ministry of the son of man,
[33:25] Jesus Christ the headstone. And he don't
[33:28] come here until the millennium, it's got
[33:32] to be through a group of people.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; It's got to be through a group of people
[33:36] that are mature.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; Not babies. Mature bride, wife.
[33:46] Is your life worthy of the gospel? Here
[33:48] we are. The threes. Remember the
[33:49] remember the three exodus. Well, the
[33:51] let's just look at the third. Then the
[33:53] third exodus. It's when the look it's
[33:56] when the same pillar of fire takes the
[33:58] bride from the church. Now watch. Out of
[34:02] the natural, out of the spiritual, and
[34:06] the spiritual out of the spiritual.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:14] No, I know what he's talking about.
[34:18] So there's spiritual people out there in
[34:20] the world because right here's what he
[34:22] says. He corrects it really. He says the
[34:24] three C the spiritual out of the church
[34:27] rather. Then we get the threes the three
[34:29] ages of it which you meant
[34:30] justification, sanctification, baptism
[34:31] and the holy ghost. But the third exodus
[34:34] is what we are looking at right this
[34:35] moment. Right.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; Same pillar of fire
[34:40] takes the bride from the church
[34:44] out of the natural out of the spiritual
[34:47] and the spiritual out of the spiritual.
[34:49] Brother Brown said, "When the bride gets
[34:52] a revelation of the two spirits in the
[34:54] framework of the church,
[34:57] &gt;&gt; I say message church."
[34:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; There's two spirits working and they are
[35:02] the two highest spirits ever
[35:05] &gt;&gt; and they're both religious because now
[35:07] Satan is uncovered. He's been exposed.
[35:10] We know where he's at. We know where
[35:12] he's sitting
[35:13] &gt;&gt; and
[35:13] &gt;&gt; some of y'all he's sitting right behind
[35:15] your eyelids
[35:18] &gt;&gt; at the moment.
[35:20] What do y'all do on Wednesday? I take a
[35:21] nap. Ain't that right, Jimbo? We take a
[35:24] nap in the afternoon. You know what? To
[35:26] get ready for church.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; If this is boring to you, you need to
[35:31] find you something that excites you.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. Find something that you can
[35:36] keep your eyes open for. If it ain't
[35:39] here, get out of here.
[35:48] God's great mystery of how
[35:52] it's a secret. This is Christ a mystery.
[35:54] This is what you should be reading.
[35:57] He kept it secret. Nobody know nothing
[36:00] about it. Even the angels didn't
[36:02] understand it. See, he didn't reveal it.
[36:05] That's the reason. Now, watch. Under our
[36:08] seventh mystery, seventh seal,
[36:12] the seal, seventh seal was open, there
[36:14] was silence. Jesus when he was on earth,
[36:17] they wanted to know when he would come.
[36:20] He said even the son don't even know
[36:22] what's going to happen at that moment.
[36:25] He was in his humanity. Everybody with
[36:27] me?
[36:27] &gt;&gt; All right. When he come back and stepped
[36:29] out of that tomb, when he said, "All
[36:31] power in heaven and earth has been given
[36:32] unto me." He knew when he was coming
[36:34] back.
[36:37] Even the son himself didn't know when
[36:38] it's going to happen. See, God has this
[36:40] all to himself. Now remember, God and
[36:43] Jesus are the same person.
[36:46] [clears throat]
[36:46] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason there was silence
[36:47] in heavens for a space of half an hour.
[36:50] And seven thunders uttered their voices.
[36:52] And John was even forbidden to write it.
[36:54] See,
[36:57] he summed it all up. What? The coming of
[37:00] the Lord.
[37:02] That's one thing he hasn't revealed yet
[37:04] of how he will come and when he will
[37:06] come. It's a good thing that he doesn't
[37:09] know. Watch that he doesn't. N O not k
[37:13] for those of you that are listening in.
[37:15] He has show. But now look, he didn't
[37:17] hold it for himself.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; He has showed or revealed it in every
[37:23] TYPE IN THE BIBLE. SO IT'S RIGHT HERE.
[37:25] IT'S LAYING IN FRONT OF US TODAY.
[37:28] THEREFORE, the entire Bible is a
[37:30] revelation of God's mystery in Christ. H
[37:34] the entire Bible
[37:37] is an expression OF ONE GOAL THAT GOD
[37:40] HAD, one purpose he wanted to achieve in
[37:44] the entire Bible. And all the acts of
[37:46] the believers in the Bible has been in
[37:48] type expressing what God's goal is. Now,
[37:53] in this last day, he's talking to us. He
[37:56] has revealed it and shows it and God's
[37:59] help. Well, you'll see it right here
[38:00] this morning. What the Lord has had in
[38:02] his mind all along and has expressed it.
[38:05] That's why that message is so important.
[38:08] That was the plan and purpose of God
[38:10] from the beginning
[38:11] &gt;&gt; was to reveal Christ in a group of
[38:13] people. Not just reveal Christ, but
[38:15] reveal Christ in a group of people.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; All right. Christ the mystery of God.
[38:19] Let's keep reading just for a second.
[38:21] What was once God's great secret, great
[38:25] mysterious secret in his mind, now watch
[38:28] is now put in the heart of believers. So
[38:30] it's it's you can't say I don't
[38:32] understand or I don't know. It's it's
[38:33] open.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; It's open.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; That is the body of Christ. What was
[38:38] God's what was God's once great secret
[38:41] in his mind before the foundation of the
[38:43] world is now made manifest.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; Right?
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Think of it now. Watch what he said. I'm
[38:51] sure we don't we don't get it.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; I'm just reading what the prophet said.
[38:56] He said, "I can't see it the way I ought
[38:59] to and I'm sure you don't." But listen,
[39:02] that was him preaching to one group of
[39:04] people that were scattered, smothered,
[39:06] and covered, if you want to say that.
[39:08] All kind of denominations, all kind of
[39:10] ideas, all kind of thoughts. I hope THAT
[39:13] AIN'T THE GROUP HERE TODAY. I hope that
[39:15] ain't the group that's coming to
[39:16] maturity. It's not going to be a group
[39:18] that's GOT A DENOMINATIONAL IDEA. IT'S
[39:20] NOT GOING TO BE A GROUP THAT'S GOT A
[39:21] BAPTIST IDEA.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; I met my cousin today and we were at
[39:27] Walmart and
[39:30] well, she was married to my cousin, but
[39:31] she's my cousin anyway. So, [snorts] her
[39:34] husband was a Baptist minister for a lot
[39:35] of years and he's retired.
[39:38] So, she said, "Let me ask you a
[39:39] question." I said, "Go right ahead."
[39:42] She said, "Did all your sisters wear
[39:45] dresses and don't cut their hair and
[39:47] don't wear makeup?" I said, "Yep."
[39:49] I said, "That's what the Bible said to
[39:51] do."
[39:53] Of course, Ray or the man didn't say
[39:55] anything.
[39:58] She said, "Well, I think that," and I
[40:00] started to say, but I didn't. I let her
[40:02] continue. I thought, "Well, you're
[40:04] telling me what you thought. I'm telling
[40:05] you what the Bible said." She said,
[40:08] "Well, it's a matter of the heart." I
[40:10] said, "You're exactly correct. It's a
[40:13] matter of the heart."
[40:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; And I I told him, I said, "Well, now
[40:17] your denomination teaches that." I said,
[40:20] "I'm just reading what the Bible said."
[40:23] Well, I don't see no different. I said,
[40:24] "Well, let me tell you this. Jesus said,
[40:29] "If you love the world and the things of
[40:32] the world, the love of God's not in
[40:34] you."
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now folks, if we can't be singled
[40:38] out for what we believe,
[40:43] &gt;&gt; I'm getting down in the home now.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; We're in your living room.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Right.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; If we can't I told I told her, I said,
[40:52] "Look, I said, when one of our sisters
[40:54] walks into Walmart, most people that
[40:57] look at them know they're different."
[41:00] &gt;&gt; So, I was oblivious to the whole world.
[41:02] They don't care. You could walk in there
[41:03] naked and they wouldn't care about it.
[41:05] But they but y'all walk into that. Thank
[41:07] God they don't. Y'all thank God for
[41:09] clothes.
[41:11] But y'all walk into Walmart and and it's
[41:13] a it's a condemnation to everybody in
[41:16] that
[41:18] room or wherever you're at.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Then I told him about the hunt that I
[41:22] was just on with those guys that like to
[41:24] cuss more and they did breathe because
[41:26] they breathed while they cursed and
[41:28] cursed while they breathed.
[41:30] And [clears throat] and the man said and
[41:31] I so I told her I said now I said that
[41:34] man said he was a Catholic so he's
[41:37] religious.
[41:38] I said he even told me he was faithful.
[41:43] And I said yeah I told him. I said yes
[41:45] you're faithful to that alcohol and that
[41:46] filthy mouth. That's what you're
[41:48] faithful to.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; There's got to be a separation.
[41:57] We've got to live what the Bible said.
[42:01] [snorts]
[42:01] She said, "Well, I just don't think I
[42:03] got on pants now." She said, "I just
[42:04] don't it don't bother me." And I
[42:06] thought,
[42:09] &gt;&gt; "I still want to be friends with them.
[42:11] They're my kin folks."
[42:13] But that's their Listen, folks. I'm
[42:15] telling you, that's that was their
[42:16] denomination talking.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; That was all that that lady had in her
[42:21] mind was what her denomination said.
[42:24] right?
[42:25] &gt;&gt; And her husband was her pastor for 30
[42:27] something years. But that was what he
[42:29] was taught. He went to the seminary and
[42:30] they taught him all these, you know,
[42:32] well, it don't it don't matter anymore.
[42:34] It's just how you just get them to
[42:36] church. WELL, I AGREE THAT. GET THEM TO
[42:38] CHURCH.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN YOU GET THEM TO CHURCH, THEY
[42:41] GOT TO CHANGE. THERE'S GOT TO BE A
[42:43] CHANGE SOMEWHERE.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; My I'm telling you, don't go to a
[42:48] Baptist church or or anywhere, BUT JUST
[42:50] DRIVE BY AND WATCH THEM WALK IN the door
[42:53] in the summertime. The men's got on
[42:54] shorts.
[42:56] Women's got on tank tops.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; They carrying their favorite beverage
[43:00] in. I hope it's not alcohol, but they
[43:02] carrying Well, Presbyterian, you never
[43:04] know. BUT YOU BUT WHO TOLD THEM THAT
[43:08] THEY'RE WALKING? LISTEN, BROTHER BOYD.
[43:10] THEY'RE WALKING INTO A HOUSE OF GOD.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; THEY SAY,
[43:14] &gt;&gt; "YEAH,
[43:15] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO TAKE them
[43:17] wherever they think they're going to be
[43:18] taken to."
[43:21] &gt;&gt; Satan has deceived. That's why you say,
[43:23] "Well, what's this got to do with the
[43:24] seals?" It has everything to do with the
[43:26] seal because without the opening of
[43:27] seals, we would not know where Satan
[43:29] was.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; We would not know that he was in a in
[43:34] the denomination and that was him.
[43:35] Totally him in that denomination.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; And if you're attached to it, you're
[43:40] just as stuck as he is.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; But God's great mystery, what the
[43:46] eternal God had as a mystery has now
[43:49] been unfolded in Jesus Christ.
[43:53] been given right down to his church.
[43:57] What was once in God's mind is now in
[44:00] the body of Christ. Jesus makes love to
[44:03] the church. His bride whispering secrets
[44:05] to her.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; The wedding is all warm and fuzzy and
[44:13] wonderful, but you have never been
[44:15] intimate yet. But once you get intimate,
[44:18] I'm I'm talking to the adults here. I'm
[44:20] sorry. But once you become intimate with
[44:22] your wife, it's a whole different ball
[44:23] game.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; Well, I hope y'all ain't a bunch of
[44:28] prudes.
[44:30] You got children, some of you.
[44:34] But ain't that what God's doing?
[44:37] Are we allowing our mate to make love to
[44:40] us?
[44:41] &gt;&gt; And let this this this is the seed,
[44:43] folks. No, don't get that carnal junk
[44:45] out of your mind.
[44:46] &gt;&gt; This is the seed that God's worried
[44:48] about.
[44:49] God don't distribute sperm.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; He distributes his word.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; And that's the way it was supposed to
[44:55] been. If they would have waited in the
[44:56] garden, there would have not been any of
[44:58] this.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; It would have been this. Adam
[45:04] had the book.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; GETTING READY TO SPEAK EVERYTHING COMING
[45:09] FORTH AND EVE WAS THERE TO HELP HIM.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; BUT EVE GOT AHEAD OF THAT PROGRAM AND
[45:15] SAID, "I'LL do it."
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Didn't
[45:19] work out very well, did it?
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Christ the mystery. Then as the kingdom
[45:25] according to the promise is ready to be
[45:27] issued in. Now watch the great
[45:29] millennium
[45:31] taking up of the church and the
[45:34] destroying of the wicked
[45:36] and the world under the sixth seal to be
[45:39] purified by a volcanic to take all the
[45:41] corruption and sin of the world to mold
[45:43] her out again and bring forth a new
[45:45] bright new millennium for the age that
[45:48] is to come. Now
[45:51] that's going to be a natural tribulation
[45:52] period. All right.
[45:57] When we see the all these great
[46:00] three-fold revelation, God in Christ,
[46:03] Christ in the church, the kingdom coming
[46:06] or Adam and Eve redeemed back to the
[46:08] garden of Eden. Listen, if we ever get
[46:10] back to the Garden of Eden, we will be
[46:12] in a condition where there was before
[46:14] the fall.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; But we HAD TO COME THIS WAY BECAUSE ADAM
[46:19] AND EVE'S BODY WAS NOT ETERNAL.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; But when we get back Oh, come on,
[46:25] somebody. WHEN WE GET BACK INTO OUR
[46:27] GARDEN OF EDEN, WE'RE TAKING AN ETERNAL
[46:28] BODY WITH US.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; THAT'S HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I DON'T WANT TO I DO WANT TO GO
[46:37] TO HEAVEN.
[46:38] I DON'T WANT TO LIVE OUTSIDE THE CITY,
[46:40] THOUGH.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; I want TO LIVE INSIDE THAT CITY
[46:44] &gt;&gt; CUZ THAT'S WHERE MY MATE LIVES.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE MY HUSBAND LIVES. THAT'S
[46:49] WHERE MY FRIENDS LIVE.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; It would be GREAT TO MAKE IT OUTSIDE.
[46:54] THEY'RE JUST AS ETERNAL, BUT THEY DON'T
[46:56] GET THE BENEFITS THAT WE GET.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN INTIMATE
[47:01] LIKE WE HAVE BEEN INTIMATE to Jesus
[47:02] Christ.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO BE AROUND US ALL THE TIME.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HE CHOSE. AND HE CHOSE A
[47:12] GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT'S GOING TO LOVE HIM
[47:13] BACK.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; YES.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; MORE THAN THE THINGS OF THE WORLD, MORE
[47:17] THAN OUR PETTY IDEAS, MORE THAN OUR
[47:19] WOUSY WY WOO, MORE THAN ANYTHING.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. RIGHT.
[47:25] Adam and Eve redeemed back to the Garden
[47:26] of Eden in the representation of Christ
[47:29] and his bride. And then the kingdom is
[47:32] going to be restored according to his
[47:33] promise. Praise be to God. Now, by the
[47:36] revelation of the three-fold mystery,
[47:39] the threes again, the secret, and by the
[47:42] personal vindication word, vindicated
[47:44] word, by his original headship.
[47:49] That's what we're coming to.
[47:51] The headstone is coming down
[47:54] on a group of people that will be able
[47:56] to receive the headship.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Remember brother Ram said one time he
[48:02] said now if you got iron and you got
[48:04] flesh they won't mix.
[48:06] So if you got headstone you got to have
[48:08] headstone people.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; If the headstone is the revelation true
[48:11] revelation of the word of God body
[48:13] spirit and soul then you're going to
[48:15] have to have a group of people standing
[48:16] here to take that revelation.
[48:20] And the only way you can take it is to
[48:22] know what we have been taught by the
[48:25] message of THE HOUR ALL THESE 60S
[48:27] something years since he's been gone.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T FOR THEM FOLKS. HE JUST SAID
[48:33] HE SAID YOU AIN'T UNDERSTANDING THIS.
[48:35] AND I I you know the quote I read
[48:37] brother said it's not for you on
[48:39] questions and answers ON THE SEALS.
[48:41] YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO GET IT.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; WELL, brother Aaron, if he stopped right
[48:46] there, then we're dead.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. But there's a GROUP OF PEOPLE
[48:50] GOING TO CATCH IT. WHEN GOD SPEAKS TO A
[48:52] PROPHET, IT HAS TO COME TO PASS.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY. IT'S GOT TO COME TO
[48:58] PASS.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IT TAKES? IT TAKES
[49:00] SOMEBODY TO SAY, "BE IT UNTO ME
[49:03] &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO THE WORD I JUST HEARD."
[49:07] &gt;&gt; BE IT UNTO ME. BRING THE WORD TO ME,
[49:10] LORD.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:20] We've arrived.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; We've arrived at a place we can't go
[49:24] backwards anymore.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; We got to go forward.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; We got to change.
[49:32] We got to change and change some more.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; 2026 is going to be a year of change.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Now, that means naturally and
[49:45] spiritually. Amen.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of things going on out
[49:48] there in that world that Brother Ram
[49:49] told us was going to happen that we
[49:51] already knew. So, we don't have to
[49:52] preach on it for hours.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; We don't have to get political about it.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME WHAT name you
[50:01] put on it.
[50:03] United States is the image of the beast.
[50:05] I don't care who's running USA.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; They are going to be the one that speaks
[50:11] for Rome. Now, it just so happens we got
[50:14] the right guy in both places.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; You ever read where the Bible says that
[50:21] craft will prosper in the end time? All
[50:23] these things are going to start. You
[50:24] look at the stock market
[50:27] &gt;&gt; is heading straight up.
[50:29] But remember to fall doesn't mean to
[50:32] just drop something from here to the
[50:34] floor. Fall means you get on top of
[50:37] stone mountain and you drop you falling.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; That's what's going to fall. This whole
[50:43] place is going to collapse, folks.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Listen, just like we're getting ready
[50:47] for this storm to come up. Be vigilant.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; But that's not your life.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Yeah. You think, "Well, yeah,
[50:56] I'm going to protect my life." This is
[50:58] protecting your life.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; This is protecting your afterlife.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; You might be protecting your life at the
[51:05] moment, but this today is what we're
[51:08] talking about is going to protect you
[51:09] for an eternity.
[51:12] for an eternity. WHICH ONE DO YOU WANT?
[51:15] &gt;&gt; You want PARTIAL OR YOU WANT PERFECT?
[51:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[51:20] [snorts]
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Everybody all right?
[51:23] [clears throat]
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Finally, let's get on this just for
[51:26] about 15 or 20 minutes. We Okay. The
[51:29] white horse. Now, and Jesus answered and
[51:32] said unto them, take heed that no man
[51:33] deceive you, for many shall come in my
[51:35] name, saying, I am Christ, and shall
[51:37] deceive many. Now, [cough]
[51:40] there had to be on the earth, there had
[51:43] to be a white righteous church for Satan
[51:46] to copy.
[51:48] Now, listen. Remember through this whole
[51:50] series, Satan never ever ever
[51:55] is an originator of anything.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; He is a deceiver, a copycat,
[52:02] right? But his copy is totally opposite
[52:05] from God.
[52:07] It may look close,
[52:09] but it's not.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus answered, "Take heed that no man
[52:14] deceive you, for many shall come in my
[52:16] name and say, I am Christ and shall
[52:18] deceive many."
[52:20] Brother, I'm on the sixth seal.
[52:24] Now, he's going to start answering. He
[52:25] told us about the first seal. He's going
[52:26] to answer what's going to happen. So,
[52:28] we're going to have a natural mean I'm
[52:29] going to have a natural happening. Then,
[52:30] I'm going to tell you here real quick a
[52:32] little bit about a spiritual happening.
[52:34] And I saw and behold a white horse and
[52:35] he that sat on him had a bow and a crown
[52:37] was given unto him and he went forth
[52:38] conquering and to conquer. Who did we
[52:41] find this fellow was? The antichrist.
[52:44] All right. Matthew 24 4 and5. Jesus
[52:47] answered and said unto them, take heed
[52:49] that no man deceive you. For many shall
[52:52] come in my name and say I am Christ and
[52:53] shall deceive many. See Antichrist,
[52:56] there's your seal. Well, the first seal
[52:58] there had to be there had to
[53:00] [clears throat] be a white righteous
[53:01] church on the earth for Satan to copy
[53:03] from.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; But what had happened, listen to me real
[53:06] quick, what had happened was they had
[53:08] got so close.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham even says that
[53:13] their limbs intertwined.
[53:17] Right?
[53:18] &gt;&gt; So, it's not this bad, gnarly, stinking,
[53:20] black looking tree over here and this
[53:23] great beautiful tree of life over here.
[53:26] Brother Ram said in the end time that
[53:28] their their limbs are intertwining
[53:30] because it's the deception of the age.
[53:33] But,
[53:35] &gt;&gt; see, that's why come on, that's why the
[53:38] seals had to open. It gives me
[53:39] confidence to know,
[53:41] &gt;&gt; amen,
[53:42] &gt;&gt; what a what the doctrine of our church
[53:44] is, the doctrine of the believers are.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; I have no question. I don't have to call
[53:49] James Dobson. I [snorts] don't have to
[53:51] call there. Listen, they're great men.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Okay. Charles Spurgeon, all those we we,
[53:57] you know, we Smith Wigglesworth, we've
[53:59] been talking about him not too. Great
[54:01] man of faith.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Great man of faith. But he didn't have
[54:05] everything. Right.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Brother FF Bosworth, brother Brown's
[54:08] bosom friend, never could accept the
[54:10] message,
[54:12] &gt;&gt; BUT HE HAD FAITH. He had FAITH FOR THE
[54:15] TIME. And brother Brown said, "That old
[54:16] oak tree." In other words, he stood
[54:18] there and he knew what his faith was.
[54:20] That's it.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; And he'll be there, but he will not be
[54:23] an end time bride to take a change cuz
[54:25] he's already gone.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; So, I'm sorry to say that he got caught
[54:32] up in that Antichrist system.
[54:36] Don't get quiet.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Anything outside of the doctrine of
[54:41] Jesus Christ is antirist.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Anti-word. There's no in between.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; There's no God's idea,
[54:52] uh, James Dobson's idea and the devil's
[54:55] idea.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; That's why I put my dependency on this
[55:02] message being right.
[55:05] Amen.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; And everything I've seen as I've come
[55:08] through these 30 years of being or
[55:10] almost 30 of being a minister and being
[55:12] in the message, I've not found one time
[55:16] where it was off.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; I found many times when I was off.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; I found many times when I was off
[55:25] because you you have you start a you
[55:27] start a sentence with I thought you're
[55:29] wrong right there.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Remember I told y'all that a long time
[55:32] ago. Somebody comes up to me and said,
[55:33] "Well, I thought." Well, you're wrong
[55:34] right there.
[55:37] It's like that the I mean, you feel
[55:40] sorry for people cuz you you tell them.
[55:43] And that's why I told the sister, I said
[55:44] or my cousin, I said, "Look, I can find
[55:47] in the Bible how we're living."
[55:50] Can you?
[55:53] And that's why she kept saying, "Well,
[55:54] it's it's all in the heart. It's all in
[55:56] the heart." I said, "Yeah, but what's in
[55:58] your heart's got to show in your body."
[56:00] Yes.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; That's why they have been taken away
[56:03] from the word so much. When those seals
[56:06] opened, it put a group in and put a
[56:09] group out.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; It put a group in and it put a group
[56:15] out. That's why we're looking at the two
[56:17] groups now. And they're both in the
[56:19] framework of the church. One is going to
[56:21] be so deceived. They think they're right
[56:23] and they're not going to make it. And
[56:25] then there's going to be a group that is
[56:27] the true believer that's going to take
[56:29] this thing and stand one day and say,
[56:32] "Death,
[56:34] I figured out.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; I figured out your tactics,
[56:39] &gt;&gt; and I don't want nothing to deal with
[56:41] it."
[56:44] &gt;&gt; 2 Thessalonians 2:1. Now we beseech you,
[56:46] brethren, now this is Paul. Now we
[56:49] beseech you, brethren, by the coming of
[56:50] our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our
[56:52] gathering together unto him, that you be
[56:54] not soon shaken in mind or be troubled.
[56:56] Now, see, excuse me, Paul is preaching
[57:00] the seal here. He's preaching the first
[57:01] seal, but he has no idea that's what
[57:03] he's preaching,
[57:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[57:07] &gt;&gt; I was thinking this morning, um, Brother
[57:09] Manuel, when when John went to Patmas,
[57:13] every disciple was already dead,
[57:16] &gt;&gt; even Paul.
[57:19] So they couldn't what I'm saying is they
[57:21] couldn't get John's writings
[57:24] and read it
[57:25] &gt;&gt; because John wrote all that down from
[57:27] Patmas. Right.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; So he was really the one that
[57:31] spearheaded bringing the truth.
[57:35] Come on.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. He was the only one alive.
[57:38] The only one God showed it to. And
[57:40] listen. And then nobody understood it.
[57:42] DANIEL SHUT UP THE BOOK
[57:45] &gt;&gt; TILL THE TIME OF THE END.
[57:48] JOHN WASN'T IN THE END TIME. WE'RE IN
[57:50] THE END TIME.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHEN THE BOOK IS GOING TO BE
[57:53] OPEN.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; SEAL IT UP TO THE TIME OF THE END. MANY
[57:57] WILL GO TO AND FRO and there'll be all
[57:58] kind of THINGS HAPPENING. LISTEN, DANIEL
[58:00] WAS PREACHING THE SEALS TOO.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Now we beseech you, brethren, by the
[58:06] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by
[58:08] our gathering unto him, that you be not
[58:10] soon shaken in mind or be troubled.
[58:13] Look, neither by spirit, nor by word,
[58:16] nor by letter as from us. This is Paul.
[58:19] As that the day of Christ is at hand,
[58:23] let no man deceive you by any means. For
[58:26] that day shall not come except there
[58:29] come a falling away first, and that man
[58:32] of sin. Where was the man of sin in the
[58:35] first seal? He was sitting on a power.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Wake up just a minute. HE WAS SITTING ON
[58:41] A HORSE, A WHITE HORSE.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; IT LOOKED GOOD.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; HE WAS GOING TO CONQUER. HE HAD A BOW IN
[58:47] HIS HAND. HE LOOKED LIKE HE HAD SOME
[58:49] KIND OF POWER.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; BUT WHERE DID THAT POWER COME? IT COME
[58:53] FROM A DECEIVED GROUP OF PEOPLE.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; THAT HORSE HE WAS RIDING WAS A DECEIVER.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Because what is a horse? It's power.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; And the power is where? Power's in the
[59:07] people.
[59:10] Let me explain that to you real quick.
[59:13] In the millennium, Satan is still going
[59:15] to be alive.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; But brother Ram said he was he had a
[59:22] chain on him.
[59:24] And it's not a chain like we think, but
[59:27] it's a chain of circumstances that there
[59:29] won't be any God come on people. There
[59:32] won't be anybody
[59:35] give him a thought.
[59:38] Yes,
[59:40] &gt;&gt; because brother Ram said he'll have
[59:42] nobody to work through.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; In other words, all power had been taken
[59:46] away from him.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Now, he'll raise up and try to bring an
[59:49] army. He uh YOU GOT TO GIVE THAT GUY ONE
[59:51] CREDIT. He's pretty persistent.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; But he will never ever ever
[1:00:00] be victorious.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Ever be victorious.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Let no man deceive you by see man. Let
[1:00:07] no man deceive you by any means that
[1:00:09] that for that day shall not come except
[1:00:11] there becoming a falling away first and
[1:00:13] we see that now. But [clears throat] I
[1:00:15] want to ask you a question. You can fall
[1:00:17] away sitting in your chair right now.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; You can get cold and formal.
[1:00:24] As brother Daryl said stiff you can't
[1:00:26] raise your hands. Come on people. You
[1:00:27] got to have something to be happy about.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; If you're not happy about this message,
[1:00:31] FIND YOU SOMETHING. YES, SIR.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; GO TO THE BALL GAME AND GET ALL REVVED
[1:00:36] UP. YOU GET YOUR joints going.
[1:00:39] That hurt.
[1:00:42] [clears throat] I'm not kidding.
[1:00:48] And that man of sin, look, be revealed.
[1:00:51] The son of predition.
[1:00:54] In that first seal, it was revealed.
[1:00:56] That was the antichrist.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Who opposes and exalteth himself above
[1:01:03] all that is called God. Amen.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Or that is worshiped. So so that he as
[1:01:08] God siteth in the temple of God,
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; showing himself that he is God.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Remember ye not that when I was yet with
[1:01:19] you, I told you these things. And now
[1:01:23] you know what withholded that he might
[1:01:25] be revealed in his time. Paul knew there
[1:01:28] was something withholding. What? It was
[1:01:30] the opening of the seals.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; That's what was withholding. He just
[1:01:34] couldn't, brother, brother um Luis, he
[1:01:36] didn't have the verbiage at the time. He
[1:01:38] didn't know what a seal was. Remember,
[1:01:39] he was already dead,
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; But he knew there was something coming
[1:01:43] that this thing, right, this man right
[1:01:45] here was going to sit in the temple of
[1:01:46] God showing himself to be as God. So,
[1:01:49] he's going to be righteous,
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; but it's self-righteousness.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Not the righteousness of God. That's
[1:01:57] right.
[1:01:58] For the mystery of iniquity
[1:02:01] doth already work
[1:02:04] only he who now letth will let until he
[1:02:08] be taken out of the way. Now brother Bam
[1:02:10] told us he God let this happen. All
[1:02:12] right is everybody with me? He God let
[1:02:14] this happen until he the bride he and
[1:02:16] she are one until we be taken out of the
[1:02:19] way. And then shall that wicked be
[1:02:22] revealed whom the Lord shall consume
[1:02:23] with the spirit of his mouth and shall
[1:02:25] destroy with the brightness of his
[1:02:26] coming. That's in the tribulation.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, remember, he won't be
[1:02:31] destroyed completely, but his his
[1:02:33] tactics will. But you go on over to the
[1:02:35] lake of fire, and that's when he's
[1:02:36] destroyed.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; So, in other words, that's way that way.
[1:02:42] But remember, he's working now here.
[1:02:44] Even him who's coming is after the
[1:02:47] working of Satan with all power and
[1:02:49] signs and lying lying wonders. Power.
[1:02:52] Everybody's wanting power. So they got
[1:02:53] we got the mechanics but we don't have
[1:02:55] the dynamics or we got one and we ain't
[1:02:57] got the other. We're looking for signs.
[1:02:59] We're looking for wonders. Signs follow
[1:03:02] the believer.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Follow. That means they're behind you.
[1:03:06] You're not looking at them.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; The signs and wonders are looking at
[1:03:09] you.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; I believe in them. I've seen them.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; But remember the greatest thing Paul
[1:03:16] said, you can do all that.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. and not have charity.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; You can have the you can have the
[1:03:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost on your spirit
[1:03:27] realm right today and say amen and think
[1:03:30] you're understanding what I'm saying.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; We got to be right people. We got to
[1:03:37] know that we know that we know that we
[1:03:39] know.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; And with all deceivable, that's a hard
[1:03:45] word. Deceivleness of unrighteousness in
[1:03:47] them that perish. Because look, they
[1:03:49] received not they didn't say they didn't
[1:03:50] say it. didn't receive the truth.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Said they did not receive the love of
[1:03:55] the truth. Love, agape love, the new
[1:03:57] birth
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; of the truth that they might be saved.
[1:04:02] And for this cause, God shall send them
[1:04:04] strong delusion. That's what he did at
[1:04:06] Naa. He sent them. LISTEN, THEY went as
[1:04:10] Christians. Amen.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; They went TRYING TO FIGURE OUT some
[1:04:15] things about the Bible or maybe not the
[1:04:19] Bible but the teachings.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; And what did they come out with? They
[1:04:25] came out with their own idea.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And for this cause God shall send
[1:04:29] them strong delusion that they should
[1:04:30] believe a lie
[1:04:33] that they might all they all might be
[1:04:37] damned who believeth not the truth but
[1:04:39] had pleasure in unrighteousness.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; So that white that first seal we'll get
[1:04:46] into it later on. It shows that there
[1:04:48] was a white righteous people on the
[1:04:49] earth. There was a true church that it
[1:04:51] was born at Pentecost.
[1:04:53] All right. Right. Then Satan gets
[1:04:56] involved and he gets on a horse just
[1:04:58] like God's on a horse on white horse. He
[1:05:01] gets on his own horse, but it's a
[1:05:02] substitute.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; That's not God's horse he's on.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; That's his horse.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; That's not God's horse. That's his
[1:05:12] horse. But he's fixing to get off that
[1:05:14] horse and get on another horse, which is
[1:05:18] red.
[1:05:19] The red horse. And you shall hear of
[1:05:21] wars and rumors of wars. See that you be
[1:05:24] not troubled, for all these things must
[1:05:25] come to pass, but the end is not yet.
[1:05:28] We've had those. We've had wars and wars
[1:05:30] and wars. Listen, do y'all know how many
[1:05:32] wars are going on right now around the
[1:05:34] world? There's like 16 or 17 wars going
[1:05:36] on around the world.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; And that's just natural wars, spiritual
[1:05:41] wars going on right now.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; But the end is not yet.
[1:05:48] Brother, brother Ram said, "Know the
[1:05:49] second seal in Matthew 24:6. And you
[1:05:52] shall hear wars and rumors of war see
[1:05:53] that you be not troubled. For all these
[1:05:55] things must come to pass, but the end is
[1:05:57] not yet." Now remember, there's a
[1:06:00] natural application and a spiritual
[1:06:01] application.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Wars
[1:06:05] and rumors of wars, the wars we have.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. Let's take the second
[1:06:12] seal. And then he reads when he had
[1:06:14] opened the second seal, there went forth
[1:06:16] another horse that was red and power was
[1:06:18] given to him. I want you to realize some
[1:06:20] of you that are that are they're not
[1:06:21] familiar with the seals.
[1:06:24] Look, power was given.
[1:06:27] He had no Satan has no original power,
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; right? He has to be permitted or given
[1:06:33] power as as God permitted him to do
[1:06:35] these things
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; to what? Like I said before, the
[1:06:39] 200,000,000 demons, they're horrible
[1:06:40] demons. But what did he say it done? It
[1:06:42] turned and and drove us back to our
[1:06:44] homeland.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT BOMBARDS me and
[1:06:48] you every single day of our life.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; They're tormentors.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; BUT WE GOT TO BE ABLE TO DESTROY THAT
[1:06:56] THING IN MY in our minds.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; That power was given to him that sat
[1:07:02] there on to take peace from the earth
[1:07:04] and they should kill one another. And
[1:07:06] there was given to he didn't have a
[1:07:08] sword.
[1:07:10] There was given to him a great sword
[1:07:14] perfectly, just exactly. Oh, I like to
[1:07:16] make the scripture answer itself, don't
[1:07:17] you? The Holy Spirit wrote it all, but
[1:07:19] he's able to reveal it.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; All right, the black horse. Real quick,
[1:07:23] we'll get to the black horse and then
[1:07:24] we'll stop because it's 8:25.
[1:07:27] [clears throat] Some people are already
[1:07:28] going to land, but that's where Cain
[1:07:30] went. So the black horse for nation
[1:07:33] shall rise against nation and kingdom
[1:07:36] against kingdom and there shall be
[1:07:38] famines and pestilence and earthquakes
[1:07:40] in many places. Now remember the Bible
[1:07:43] tells us that the famine will not be for
[1:07:47] food. Listen, there's people honestly
[1:07:49] that are starving to death. I'm they
[1:07:50] are.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. But not as many as are eating and
[1:07:54] are fat or getting getting nourishment.
[1:07:58] Right?
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Now, the spiritual part of that is the
[1:08:01] same thing.
[1:08:04] You know, you can eat and be
[1:08:06] malnourished.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; It's according to what you eat.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; You can be malnourished with what you
[1:08:10] eat. Same way with the Bible. So,
[1:08:13] there'll be famines. Bible tells us
[1:08:16] there'll be famines that will take place
[1:08:19] and but it won't be for food. It'll be
[1:08:21] for what? For the word of God.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; These are Now look, this is the black
[1:08:26] horse. This is the third horse. All
[1:08:28] right. The black horse, all these are
[1:08:31] the beginning of sorrows.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, what was the black
[1:08:36] horse? The black horse was the church
[1:08:38] ages. I mean, the dark ages. Everybody
[1:08:41] with me? We we'll explain that later on.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; But the black horse, all right, you the
[1:08:46] white horse was the first three ages.
[1:08:49] All right. The red horse come in right
[1:08:51] after that. And then the black horse and
[1:08:53] then you got what? Then you got the uh
[1:08:55] pale horse. All right,
[1:09:01] everybody with me?
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Okay, we'll we'll get to all that later
[1:09:05] on.
[1:09:06] Now, let's notice the third seal. What
[1:09:08] does it say? This is famine. Nation
[1:09:10] shall rise against nation and kingdom
[1:09:12] against kingdom, and there shall be
[1:09:13] famines, pestilence, earthquakes in many
[1:09:15] places. All these things are the
[1:09:16] beginning of sorrows. See, you're coming
[1:09:19] right on up now. Now, Revelation the 6.
[1:09:21] Now, we're going to open the third seal.
[1:09:23] Revelation 6:5. And when he had opened
[1:09:25] the third seal, I behold the third
[1:09:27] beast, say, "Come and see." And beheld,
[1:09:30] in a little black horse, and he that sat
[1:09:32] on him had a pair of balances in his
[1:09:34] hand, and heard a voice in the midst of
[1:09:36] the four beasts. Now, this is the only
[1:09:38] seal.
[1:09:40] You with me? This is the only seal where
[1:09:42] Christ interjects and speaks himself
[1:09:46] because it's a dark time.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; You with me? And I heard a voice in the
[1:09:50] midst of the four beasts.
[1:09:53] Say, a measure of wheat for a penny and
[1:09:55] three measures of barley for a penny.
[1:09:57] See not that you hurt the oil and the
[1:09:59] wine. Famine. See, exactly the same
[1:10:01] seal. Same that same thing Jesus said.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Let's go to number four. Pale horse real
[1:10:09] quick. Then shall they deliver you up to
[1:10:11] be afflicted and shall kill you, and you
[1:10:13] shall be hated of all nations for my
[1:10:15] name's sake. Now, when we get to the
[1:10:17] fourth seal, what is that seal?
[1:10:20] That's the rapture seal.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; All right, everybody with me? There's
[1:10:24] there's four beasts. There's four combat
[1:10:26] beasts, which is the Holy Ghost.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; The lion, ox, man, and eagle. All right,
[1:10:30] everybody with me?
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; When we get to the fifth seal, there's
[1:10:33] no mention of a beast because there's
[1:10:34] only four. The Bible says there's four
[1:10:36] living creatures, four beasts.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brown tells us therefore on
[1:10:40] the fourth seal, he says the rapture had
[1:10:42] to take place cuz there's no more
[1:10:44] there's no more combat beast. So, in
[1:10:46] other words, there's Listen, folks. Do
[1:10:48] you do you realize when when we leave
[1:10:50] here and when the 144,000 get hunted
[1:10:54] down and killed and they leave out of
[1:10:56] here, there'll be no person on the face
[1:10:58] of this earth with the Holy Ghost in
[1:11:00] their soul.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Not one out of nine billion people,
[1:11:05] there will be no one that has hol the
[1:11:08] Holy Ghost in their soul.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; That's when, I'm sorry, that's when all
[1:11:13] hell is going to break loose. Amen.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Because what is the Holy Ghost? The Holy
[1:11:18] Ghost is our protector.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Remember, he's a comforter.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; He comforted us through good and bad,
[1:11:26] but he's going to comfort us out of this
[1:11:28] place. And then that comforter is going
[1:11:29] to leave, brother Manuel. And then
[1:11:31] there's nothing there's nothing for God
[1:11:33] to come back to this earth for.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Remember, we come back with him.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:11:44] Think about what he's done for us,
[1:11:45] folks.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Think about what he's done for a group
[1:11:48] of people.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Us.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Not everybody else. Us.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we realize that or not.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Us. He's did it for us.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; And then shall they deliver you up to be
[1:12:04] afflicted and shall kill you, and you
[1:12:05] shall be hated of all nations for my
[1:12:08] name's sake. Revelation 6:7. And when he
[1:12:12] had opened the fourth seal, I heard the
[1:12:14] voice of the fourth beast say, "Come and
[1:12:16] see." And I looked, and behold, a pale
[1:12:18] horse, and his name that said on him was
[1:12:20] death, and hell followed with him, and
[1:12:23] power was given unto them over the
[1:12:24] fourth part of the earth to kill with
[1:12:26] the sword. What's killing what's killing
[1:12:28] people now? Is is u is um knives and
[1:12:32] guns, artillery. Is that killing people
[1:12:36] now?
[1:12:37] No.
[1:12:39] No.
[1:12:42] Error in the word of God is what's
[1:12:45] killing people.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; The worst killing you can have is is to
[1:12:50] be standing alive and be dead.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; And know what scripture says?
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; They think they're alive, but they're
[1:12:58] dead.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; If that light in you be darkness, how
[1:13:04] great is that darkness? Amen.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Power was given unto them in the fourth
[1:13:09] part of the earth to kill with the sword
[1:13:11] and with hunger and with death and with
[1:13:12] the beast of the earth. Then what
[1:13:14] happens? The rapture takes or the
[1:13:16] resurrection happens. Rapture takes
[1:13:17] place. All right. I want us to key on
[1:13:19] that. Make sure when we talk about the
[1:13:21] rapture, we must put resurrection in
[1:13:23] first.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; And that's that's probably a flaw that
[1:13:28] people have not been taught, but brother
[1:13:29] Dell's always taught us. Resurrection
[1:13:31] first, then a rapture. A rapture is just
[1:13:34] the event because of the resurrection.
[1:13:36] Right?
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; If you've been here long enough, you've
[1:13:38] heard him long. That's an event.
[1:13:41] It's the catching away. The resurre if
[1:13:44] it's no resurrection, there's no
[1:13:45] rapture.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; So, we got to have a resurrection first.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; First thing we got to do is we got to be
[1:13:52] resurrected.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Now, the fifth seal, we know it's
[1:13:59] martyrdom, right? The fifth seal is a
[1:14:02] fifth sealed Jew.
[1:14:04] Then shall many be offended and shall be
[1:14:07] betray one another and shall hate one
[1:14:08] another. And many false prophets will
[1:14:10] rise and shall deceive many. And because
[1:14:13] iniquity shall abound, the love of many
[1:14:15] shall wax cold. But he that shall endure
[1:14:18] unto the end, the same shall be saved.
[1:14:23] What is the fifth seal? The fifth seal
[1:14:25] is the seal of grace.
[1:14:27] When he had opened the fifth seal, I saw
[1:14:30] under the altar the souls of them that
[1:14:31] were slain for the word of God and for
[1:14:33] the testimony which they held. And they
[1:14:35] cried with a loud voice, saying, "How
[1:14:37] long, O Lord, holy and true? Dust thou
[1:14:39] not judge and avenge our blood on them
[1:14:41] that dwell on the earth?" And white
[1:14:43] robes were given unto every one of them,
[1:14:45] "This is not bride."
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brown will tell us, and
[1:14:50] I'll read it, where he thought that was
[1:14:53] the bride under the altar crying, "How
[1:14:55] long?" Right.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Not true at all. Not true at all. Cuz we
[1:15:01] don't ever say to avenge our blood.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; No, that's not in me and you.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; I don't care how bad somebody treats
[1:15:10] you. It's not could shall not be in you
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; to get even with somebody.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Man don't ever be that way. Don't ever
[1:15:21] set out to get even with somebody.
[1:15:24] Right. Amen.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; And white robes were given unto
[1:15:28] everyone. You know why this is the
[1:15:30] greatest
[1:15:32] opportunity that man has of grace is
[1:15:35] that these people now see we have grace
[1:15:37] today. We have grace because why? We've
[1:15:40] accepted Jesus Christ. We know who he
[1:15:42] is.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; We know he has come and died,
[1:15:46] resurrected, ascended, came back on the
[1:15:48] day of Pentecost, sent us the word of
[1:15:50] God. Right?
[1:15:51] And if we have that in our soul,
[1:15:54] we're born again.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; You have received your white robe
[1:15:59] already.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; But this group of people, brother Ryan,
[1:16:04] white robes were given them. We'll stop
[1:16:07] right there. White robes were given to
[1:16:09] these people.
[1:16:11] They didn't ask for them. YOU AND I
[1:16:13] ASKED FOR GRACE. YOU AND I ASKED FOR GOD
[1:16:15] TO COME INTO OUR SOUL
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; CUZ WE realized there's a man died for
[1:16:19] us and we were lost.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; These people that died didn't even know
[1:16:24] Jesus was the Messiah.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; So, how could he save them?
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; By grace.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; The grace of God.
[1:16:39] We'll cover it. the grace of God that he
[1:16:41] blinded his own children's eyes.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; He did it so you and I could come in.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; He did it. He blinded a group of people
[1:16:53] and let six and a half million Jews get
[1:16:56] killed in the Holocaust
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; so that we could be here today. You say,
[1:17:05] "Oh, that's a God that I wouldn't want
[1:17:06] to." No, that's a perfect God to me.
[1:17:12] Because remember folks,
[1:17:15] Israel was once his bride. The Jews were
[1:17:19] once his bride.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; All right? Right?
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; But he had to divorce them for what they
[1:17:24] did. But he said, "I'll never forget
[1:17:26] them."
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Cuz they were his people.
[1:17:31] They were his people to begin with, and
[1:17:33] he can't forget them.
[1:17:36] So you come over here to the end time
[1:17:38] and you see that 6 and a half million of
[1:17:40] them were killed to get them all drove
[1:17:42] back to where they need to be. But he's
[1:17:44] going to give them all eternal life
[1:17:47] and they don't even know who that man
[1:17:49] is.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; But I'll guarantee you folks, when we
[1:17:53] get over there, that'll be an
[1:17:55] opportunity for you to talk to one of
[1:17:56] them and tell them about this Jesus
[1:17:59] Christ.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a mighty God we serve.
[1:18:03] Then he's going to go over there and
[1:18:04] he's going to talk to them through two
[1:18:06] witnesses and they're going to preach
[1:18:08] Jesus so so strong until they say,
[1:18:13] "We're done for.
[1:18:15] Where did you get those scars?" They're
[1:18:17] going to preach Jesus Christ so much to
[1:18:19] them until they're going to see that
[1:18:21] they killed the Messiah.
[1:18:25] But remember what he says. He says, "Oh,
[1:18:28] no, don't worry. This was all done for a
[1:18:30] purpose.
[1:18:32] Remember Joseph? Even Joseph, you know,
[1:18:34] Joseph's brothers were like, "Oh my,
[1:18:37] we're dead. We We put him on the cross."
[1:18:39] In other words, we put Joseph in Egypt
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; and HE'S GOING TO DESTROY US. ALL HE'S
[1:18:44] GOT, HE'S GOT SO MUCH POWER. HE'S JUST
[1:18:46] GOING TO SAY, "TAKE HIM OUT AND KILL
[1:18:48] HIM."
[1:18:50] JOSEPH, HE HAD SO MUCH INSIDE OF HIM. HE
[1:18:54] WAS TRYING TO KEEP his composure. That's
[1:18:56] right.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; He was speaking to him in another
[1:18:58] language.
[1:18:59] He was hiding himself.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, somebody.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; But what happened during that time? He
[1:19:07] sent his gentile bride
[1:19:10] to the palace.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; They were nowhere around when he
[1:19:15] revealed himself in that courtroom. He
[1:19:17] revealed himself to them. And the first
[1:19:19] thing they said, Ruben and them was
[1:19:21] like, "Oh,
[1:19:24] we're done for now.
[1:19:26] We threw him away. We we got his
[1:19:29] inheritance. We told his daddy he was
[1:19:32] dead.
[1:19:34] You know what Joseph said? Joseph said,
[1:19:35] "No." Said, "This was done to preserve
[1:19:38] life."
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Because if Joseph hadn't got the dream
[1:19:42] or the vision to put up seven years in
[1:19:45] in in good time, they would have
[1:19:48] [clears throat] all starved to death in
[1:19:49] the seven years of of famine.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Same way with me and you. God give us
[1:19:55] seven church ages.
[1:19:57] Now, he's given us a seven seal book
[1:19:59] open now
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; that's going he's going to reveal
[1:20:02] himself to us.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; But when he's finished with us, he's
[1:20:05] going to go straight to the Jews and
[1:20:07] they're going to say, "Oh man, we're in
[1:20:09] trouble." He's going to say, "No, no."
[1:20:11] You'll understand later. There's a group
[1:20:12] that's in another dimension that's
[1:20:14] shouting and praising God and and having
[1:20:17] um um wine and and bread at the
[1:20:20] communion table and they're going to be
[1:20:22] up there for three and a half years. I'm
[1:20:24] going to reveal myself to you. The
[1:20:26] reason I didn't reveal myself to you is
[1:20:27] to get that gentile bride in. Once I got
[1:20:30] her in, I opened your eyes and this is
[1:20:31] what it's going to be. It's gonna be
[1:20:32] Jesus Christ.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve. Let's stand.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Musicians, come on. We'll sing a song.
[1:20:44] So, the fifth seal,
[1:20:47] seal of grace.
[1:20:49] Sixth seal, judgment seal.
[1:20:53] Seventh seal,
[1:20:55] Christ
[1:20:57] the headstone,
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; the man that we've all been waiting on
[1:21:03] is right here
[1:21:05] in this word that we preach. Everything
[1:21:08] we got
[1:21:10] is right here in this Bible.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; All the types.
[1:21:14] I don't know that anybody type Joseph
[1:21:16] like brother Brandham did. I mean, he
[1:21:17] typed him to be perfect like Christ,
[1:21:19] except for one little flaw.
[1:21:21] He told a lie cuz see that made him
[1:21:24] human.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; But everything else he did just he was a
[1:21:28] perfect type of Christ.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Revealed himself to his brothers. And
[1:21:32] who was his who was his real brother.
[1:21:36] Come on somebody.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Benjamin. Benjamin was his real blood
[1:21:40] brother. The other ones were concubines
[1:21:42] and first wives and all this stuff. But
[1:21:44] the his mother died in childbirth and
[1:21:46] had him and and uh and Benjamin.
[1:21:49] Benjamin was the last one. And brother
[1:21:51] Brown said Benjamin topped 144,000.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; And if you'll see if you the Bible says
[1:21:56] he went and hugged him first because
[1:21:58] remember when they came they came
[1:21:59] without Benjamin.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, GO BACK AND BRING ME
[1:22:04] YOUR DADDY HERE." WELL, he knew he's
[1:22:07] going to bring his daddy. He's going to
[1:22:08] bring that baby the youngest is coming
[1:22:10] with him, you know. So when he got him
[1:22:12] in there, I'm sure, Brother Joe, he was
[1:22:13] like a house on fire on a windy day
[1:22:15] inside of his soul. I mean, I would have
[1:22:18] probably went into a closet, shut the
[1:22:20] door, and screamed to let some of it
[1:22:22] out. For him to just stand there, you
[1:22:24] know, he's standing there like an
[1:22:25] Egyptian and and speaking in another
[1:22:27] language. What? He hid himself
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; on purpose
[1:22:33] just so he could get that gentile bride
[1:22:34] and put her in the palace and then
[1:22:36] reveal himself to his people. Israel's
[1:22:42] his people. That was his first people.
[1:22:44] Yes.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; But remember, the gentile bride is the
[1:22:48] one he really wanted cuz he knew we'd
[1:22:50] love him without anything, without
[1:22:53] having to be uh a commandment.
[1:22:57] Come on. We got all the commandments,
[1:22:59] but you don't have to throw the ten
[1:23:00] commandments in my yard all the time.
[1:23:02] You don't have to read me the ten
[1:23:03] commandments all the time. I live them
[1:23:05] as best I can. You should live them the
[1:23:08] best you can.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Live those ten commandments the best you
[1:23:10] can. We're the only one that can live it
[1:23:12] cuz we got the guy that wrote it in it.
[1:23:14] Let's sing a song. God bless you. Real
[1:23:15] quick, just sing one one song.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Make

[1:25:28] and live
[1:25:30] your life [singing and music]
[1:25:32] to me.

[1:25:37] WhatsApp and the different places where
[1:25:39] we where we are post. Brother Joe and
[1:25:41] different ones will be posting. Uh we'll
[1:25:44] we'll wait till Saturday to see how this
[1:25:46] thing works out. Uh many different
[1:25:48] models has many different things. But we
[1:25:50] got a God that control it all. And if we
[1:25:53] [music] don't have church, that'll be
[1:25:54] that'll be okay. We brother Manuel will
[1:25:56] be here this coming Wednesday and
[1:25:58] [music] should be kind of all cleared
[1:26:00] out by then. And uh then we'll continue
[1:26:03] on until we get to the uh to the
[1:26:05] Valentine's banquet and brother Eric Gao
[1:26:06] will be speaking for us [music] on the
[1:26:08] 21st, I think, or 22nd of February.
[1:26:11] Yeah, 22nd of February, [music] he'll be
[1:26:13] speaking for us. And uh keep all that in
[1:26:16] your heart and mind. Like I said before,
[1:26:17] if you're bringing someone, make sure
[1:26:19] that you put their name down when you
[1:26:21] put your name down. All right? And I
[1:26:24] don't care how many people you bring. As
[1:26:25] long as a couple, bring what whoever you
[1:26:27] want to bring. Amen. That's all right.
[1:26:30] But just make sure you write it down so
[1:26:32] we'll kind of get a get a definite
[1:26:34] answer uh to give to the caterer and
[1:26:37] we're going to try to have a little
[1:26:38] extra for that Sunday. Uh now it's
[1:26:42] according to how many people's going to
[1:26:43] be there. So so just keep this uh uh you
[1:26:46] know keep us in [music] your heart that
[1:26:48] Sunday the Ohio group will still be
[1:26:51] here. They're not leaving till Monday.
[1:26:52] They're flying out Monday. They're not
[1:26:54] leaving till then. They're staying
[1:26:56] [music] they'll be here all day Sunday.
[1:26:57] So when the service is over Sunday,
[1:26:59] we're just going to stay here and then
[1:27:02] [music] I I think we'll have enough. We
[1:27:04] always have enough left over. So we'll
[1:27:06] try to make sure we have enough left
[1:27:07] over till we can fellowship Saturday.
[1:27:10] This I'm talking about that that Sunday,
[1:27:13] uh the 22nd of February after the
[1:27:14] Valentine's banquet, the next day, that
[1:27:16] Sunday when the service [music] is over,
[1:27:18] you won't have to go anywhere. We can
[1:27:19] all sit downstairs and fellowship with
[1:27:20] Ohio group. We love them so very much
[1:27:23] and we appreciate them and we appreciate
[1:27:25] them coming down and being with us. and
[1:27:27] brother Eric Gio coming driving all the
[1:27:28] way from Honduras to get here. But we
[1:27:31] sure do appreciate Brother Eric and uh
[1:27:34] uh he's a funny guy. [music] I
[1:27:36] appreciate him. But he will be speaking
[1:27:38] Sunday and then after that, like I said,
[1:27:40] we'll just stay here and just have a
[1:27:43] bite and and what's left over, we'll
[1:27:45] just eat it all [music]
[1:27:46] uh Sunday afternoon. I know some of
[1:27:47] y'all don't like leftovers, but
[1:27:50] bring you a hamburger if you need to. It
[1:27:52] was probably leftover, too. The beet
[1:27:53] was. So anyway,
[1:27:56] think about that. But we're going to try
[1:27:58] to be accommodating that weekend and
[1:28:00] just I'd rather us try to stay [music]
[1:28:02] here on Sunday than to go get something
[1:28:04] to eat. And we're all in different
[1:28:05] tables and and you know, you you get
[1:28:07] scattered. We'll try to keep everybody
[1:28:09] here Sunday afternoon. [music] And uh
[1:28:11] we'll need some help with maybe some
[1:28:12] sisters putting stuff out and brothers
[1:28:15] too helping. And then [music] we'll have
[1:28:16] just a good fellowship here on Sunday
[1:28:19] after the service is over with brother
[1:28:20] Eric. I don't think he's got to go home
[1:28:22] till the next week, right?
[1:28:26] But not that day. Not Sunday. Yeah. So,
[1:28:28] he'll be here um with us for [music] the
[1:28:31] whole day. So, we'll have a good time of
[1:28:32] fellowship and uh remember the
[1:28:34] Valentine's banquet and keep us in your
[1:28:36] prayer. Let's sing it one more time.
[1:28:38] Make me more like thee. And then we'll
[1:28:40] be dismissed after we finish singing
[1:28:41] [music] that song. like me. Oh [singing]
