[0:00] all right that's the best way to put it
[0:02] I guess I don't Trump you know where I
[0:06] know we're having a lot of problems with
[0:08] our system and trying to get all of it
[0:10] worked out I know that may not have them
[0:12] to do what they're doing but we do have
[0:14] that with a lot of things in the system
[0:17] that's messed up and trying our best to
[0:20] correct it but I would I would suggest
[0:22] that you listen to the services last
[0:26] night and you might find some things
[0:28] that would be very interesting that I
[0:31] have known one point for a long time
[0:34] withholding it to her that Hebrews 1140
[0:38] if you place it to only the Old
[0:41] Testament in Hebrews 1140 you're missing
[0:45] the whole story you got to bring it from
[0:48] the Old Testament and then divide it
[0:50] just a little and bring it into the New
[0:52] Testament if you don't you're just gonna
[0:55] say well only the Old Testament is made
[0:57] perfect and there is a doctrine now
[1:00] there is a doctrine out there and if I
[1:04] call the name you would be amazed but
[1:06] that's all right there's a doctrine out
[1:08] there that the Old Testament Saints was
[1:12] perfected by Jesus Christ and that would
[1:17] be without us they cannot be made
[1:19] perfect but the New Testament would have
[1:22] to be perfect by the bride of Jesus
[1:24] Christ well I don't agree with that now
[1:28] it can't be you and me perfected nobody
[1:32] when it says they without us cannot be
[1:34] made perfect I've preached it over and
[1:36] over to you that word perfect means
[1:38] complete are finished we'll get to that
[1:42] in the message describing it it has
[1:45] nothing to do with any perfection it has
[1:48] nothing to do with with anything in
[1:51] relation to how good you are it has to
[1:55] do in relation to how good he is to keep
[1:58] his word the Old Testament Saints were
[2:01] dependent upon the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:03] the New Testament is dependent upon the
[2:06] blood of Jesus Christ but worse the
[2:08] blood in the bride now you got it right
[2:12] now without us you cannot be made
[2:16] perfect they nobody can be brought into
[2:18] the correct order of completion not to
[2:23] raise somebody and preach to them and
[2:25] make them perfect or are they do it now
[2:27] no it's in completion or you know wrote
[2:32] it to the finish the seventh seal to the
[2:34] end of all things
[2:35] all right now so just read that I mean
[2:38] listen to that and go through it okay

[4:08] may see you Lord and you just come among
[4:11] us and manifest yourself in a mighty way
[4:14] as to your little Bride of Christ to
[4:17] bring us to that place of perfection
[4:19] that a resurrection can be brought we
[4:22] love you and we thank you and we commit
[4:25] it all to you
[4:26] in Jesus name Amen so we're still on
[4:33] first Peter 1 verse 22 seeing you have
[4:38] purified your souls and obeying the
[4:40] truth through the spirit unto unfeigned
[4:42] love of the Brethren see that you love
[4:45] one another with a pure heart fervently
[4:47] being born again not of corruptible seed
[4:50] but of incorruptible by the Word of God
[4:53] which liveth and abideth for ever
[4:56] alright then we go over to 2nd Peter 1
[5:03] verse 1 Simon Peter a servant an apostle
[5:09] of Jesus Christ to them that that have
[5:11] obtained like precious faith with us
[5:13] through the righteousness of God in our
[5:16] Savior Jesus Christ
[5:17] grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[5:20] through the knowledge of God and of
[5:22] Jesus our Lord according as his divine
[5:25] power has given unto us all things that
[5:29] pertain unto life and godliness through
[5:32] the knowledge of him that have called us
[5:33] to glory and virtue so were we call to
[5:38] we're called to glory our glorification
[5:42] right we're called a glorification and
[5:46] virtue which is the strength the power
[5:49] the matching things so we're called to
[5:53] that all right now we are the last ones
[5:56] in the group now others are called to
[5:59] their position but we are called to
[6:01] finish the whole thing up because they
[6:03] without us cannot be made perfect
[6:05] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[6:07] great and precious promises that by
[6:10] these you might be partakers of the
[6:12] divine nature having escaped the
[6:14] corruption that is in the world through
[6:16] lust and beside this giving all
[6:18] diligence add to your faith virtue to
[6:20] virtue knowledge and their knowledge
[6:22] temperance the temperance patience and
[6:24] to patience godliness and to godliness
[6:26] brotherly kindness and to brotherly
[6:28] kindness charity you may be seated the
[6:32] Lord had his blessing to the reading of
[6:35] the word so we've we spent some time
[6:41] trying to talk about you know the
[6:46] stature of a perfect man Peter and it's
[6:49] reading you know you know and trying to
[6:51] bring it to a place to see what God has
[6:55] been you know trying to make manifest
[7:00] among us okay and we know that we
[7:05] brought out in the past couple of
[7:07] messages a little quote from the Prophet
[7:10] off the statue of a perfect man talking
[7:13] about the church and how that it must
[7:16] come to these virtues all right see now
[7:23] if you possess these things then it's a
[7:26] possession but if you're confessing it
[7:29] it's just a confession people can read
[7:32] anybody can read second Peter but it's
[7:36] only written to those that are in Christ
[7:39] Jesus who have the new birth to start
[7:43] with the Bible is not written to a
[7:46] sinner it can only tell a sinner that
[7:49] they're lost
[7:51] it is written to the born-again believer
[7:54] cause the born-again believers only one
[7:56] that can comprehend it you know or know
[7:59] what it's doing so that should be a
[8:00] wonderful thought in itself to think of
[8:03] what God thinks of you and I to give us
[8:05] the entire Bible and that's what we've
[8:08] tried to talk about the faith of the
[8:09] father's the statue of a perfect man
[8:11] Peter nem had these virtues all right
[8:15] and they made it manifest in their time
[8:19] and they wrote the word right but see
[8:23] then it was lost down through the ages
[8:26] and it's so hard to try to follow a lot
[8:30] of times on the losing of it until we
[8:33] thought we know they didn't lose it then
[8:34] you never lost the new birth the new
[8:37] birth was in every age it was never an
[8:40] age without the new birth I don't care
[8:43] what you think of what it's doing or
[8:45] whatever well they didn't have this they
[8:46] didn't have that they had the new birth
[8:48] all right because they had the morning
[8:51] in experience all right they had to
[8:54] faith that's why I said that life's not
[8:55] about Peter
[8:57] I mean the Paul in talking to those that
[9:01] were dire you know they without us
[9:02] cannot be made perfect you look at all
[9:05] of those down through there I'm just
[9:07] encouraging you to listen to that
[9:09] because you look at although by faith
[9:11] Paul I'm by faith Abraham by faith nor
[9:14] by faith Moses by faith by faith by
[9:18] faith and then we say one of the faith
[9:20] is a new birth well look at that they
[9:22] all had a new birth no they didn't they
[9:25] didn't have the new Berko Jesus Christ
[9:27] had not died they had faith for the time
[9:32] and that was enough to hold them in the
[9:36] position under the blood of Jesus Christ
[9:39] right they had faith for the time of
[9:43] what they were doing but it doesn't mean
[9:45] just because you read something look
[9:47] like that fight that's what I'm talking
[9:49] to you about these virtues see we read
[9:51] the verses we get a definition of
[9:53] wording and we think we'll look they had
[9:56] this they had to had no no it's not
[9:59] there without the new birth understand
[10:02] the new birth first look
[10:04] that's the most important thing in our
[10:06] lives to understand what it is to be
[10:09] born to you well I believe the message
[10:12] praise God so does the devil now does
[10:16] that make you any different if the devil
[10:19] believed it and I like the scripture
[10:21] goes with it said the devil believed in
[10:23] trembled he trembled about what he
[10:26] believed it it made him afraid of what
[10:32] he could read in the Word of God or know
[10:34] about the Word of God
[10:34] alright let's see we've got to come to
[10:37] these things in other words to bring the
[10:40] prophet said to bring a rapture all is
[10:44] dependent on you and I all right and
[10:47] it's dependent on us to come to a place
[10:50] to bring that rapture back to the faith
[10:55] they had all right see then as to that
[11:00] then we read to from the statute of
[11:02] perfect man that the prophet said that
[11:04] there'd be no resurrection all right
[11:09] there's no rapture without these virtues
[11:13] because that rapture means chain that
[11:16] son died down through the ages that did
[11:18] not have the full amount of virtues and
[11:20] things right but they're not held
[11:23] accountable for that but in the end time
[11:25] is going to be held accountable that we
[11:28] all come to the place of these virtues
[11:31] well I didn't know we had to have it you
[11:33] know it now well I don't know any cuz I
[11:37] did heard you say that well you're gonna
[11:39] be responsible that's a white throne
[11:41] judgment if that's where you're standing
[11:43] because you're gonna answer for that
[11:46] statement wherever who it is to bring
[11:49] the Word of God and we don't believe it
[11:51] you're gonna stand at that throne throne
[11:53] to answer for what you heard if a dumb
[11:55] donkey tells you the truth
[11:59] you got to believe it right so then that
[12:02] that that don't put it into a place well
[12:04] I don't have to believe it cuz well you
[12:06] don't have to believe it cause I say it
[12:08] but when I read what he says now you're
[12:11] gonna have to answer so he said the
[12:14] church would have to possess these
[12:17] qualities before they could be a rapture
[12:23] the church would have to possess these
[12:27] things before there could be a
[12:31] resurrection because somebody's got to
[12:33] call the dead out of the ground and see
[12:37] we we look at it in the wrong respect I
[12:39] wish you would get simple sometimes and
[12:42] think about the things that what we're
[12:45] trying to say and just simply think
[12:47] about it you realize that this is
[12:50] talking this morning about it do you
[12:52] realize that the world is dependent upon
[12:57] you to come to the possession of these
[13:05] qualities not just talk about them but
[13:09] to come to it that's why we're here
[13:12] fifty years after the Prophet left us
[13:15] thing God's waiting on you and I now if
[13:22] that's true then where do we have the
[13:24] right to play around dilly-dally and not
[13:28] walk it in the word okay all right but
[13:31] now listen if you possess these
[13:35] qualities you got to see the whole
[13:39] stature of your being and quoting from
[13:42] the statute of perfect man paragraph 357
[13:45] the whole stature of your being is
[13:47] governed governed and controlled by
[13:50] these things
[13:53] but it cannot be completely controlled
[13:56] till it completely possesses these
[14:01] qualities now you listen to that
[14:06] statement the whole stature of your
[14:09] being is governed and controlled by
[14:12] these things these virtues but it cannot
[14:17] be completely controlled until it is
[14:20] completely till it completely possesses
[14:23] these qualities
[14:25] so what's God waiting on you and a huh
[14:28] to do what
[14:29] to possess these qualities to have what
[14:34] he has provided all right we've been
[14:36] over and over and over God didn't leave
[14:39] us if he requires us to how something
[14:42] what did the Prophet say it's his
[14:44] responsibility to provide the way for us
[14:48] to receive that okay it's up to him if
[14:52] he requires us to be perfect it's up to
[14:55] him to meet the requirement but it's up
[14:59] to you and I to receive what is done and
[15:01] how are we to receive these virtues this
[15:07] mission of Malachi for that 17:30
[15:08] revelation 10 7 do too tight turn hearts
[15:11] of the children back to the faith and
[15:12] fathers the reveal the thunders which is
[15:16] revelation containing the seven seals
[15:17] and there will be these divinely
[15:19] revealed mystery truths that literally
[15:20] turn our hearts by 327 church age book
[15:24] he just told us how to get it how see
[15:31] that's what we were trying to do and
[15:32] we'll get down to it in a minute how are
[15:34] we to get these things if God supplied
[15:40] it then how are we to receive it well I
[15:44] don't have to depend on nobody else I
[15:45] got it myself okay go ahead see he says
[15:51] if you say well I got this I got that
[15:55] and he said if you don't have these
[15:57] things he said dollars worth she breaks
[15:59] you remember that but the chain is
[16:03] strongest at its weakest link
[16:04] darhk's work breaks and if we don't have
[16:08] these things in incompletions and what
[16:11] do we got
[16:13] when you're surrendered your complete
[16:16] being then the Holy Spirit just pours
[16:19] through you in these virtues and then
[16:22] you are a living Tabernacle a stature
[16:27] that unbelievers can look at and say
[16:29] there's a Christian is scanning down
[16:33] when a man or woman possesses this now
[16:37] you want to know what's gonna bring the
[16:38] headstone to the church is it taught by
[16:42] everybody that there's got to be a
[16:43] headstone to the church we're all taught
[16:45] it down through time and everything
[16:47] you're talking about a headstone what
[16:49] did he say okay when a man or woman
[16:53] possesses this then the capstone comes
[16:58] down and seals you into the kingdom of
[17:00] God which is the Holy Ghost right he
[17:08] said well we need to headstone heart how
[17:09] do we get it we got to come through
[17:11] these qualities first well we don't have
[17:16] to have that to go that's what your
[17:17] prophet said it would take that person
[17:19] to go in the rapture he said it would
[17:22] take that person he said to bring the
[17:25] resurrection 367 statue a perfect man
[17:30] these people who died in here are
[17:33] depending and waiting on us and so this
[17:35] church has got to come to perfection in
[17:38] order to bring the resurrection and
[17:41] thereunder souls under the altar waiting
[17:44] for this church to come to its
[17:46] perfection that when Christ does come
[17:52] until the church in the minority gets to
[17:54] into a place until it's the same kind of
[17:57] ministry to dis left because when the
[17:59] headstone comes by what's it to be when
[18:03] Christ unites with a church and how or
[18:07] what is what is the reason for him to
[18:09] you're not with a church
[18:10] he's reuniting with his own being right
[18:15] I thought we were two houses versus I
[18:19] thought these virtues was his purchase I
[18:21] didn't know it was our virtues human
[18:25] people have great virtues that are good
[18:28] people right but that ain't nothing
[18:31] talking about statue of perfect man this
[18:33] is not talking about your virtue in my
[18:35] version he's talking about diversity of
[18:36] Jesus Christ that he has given unto us
[18:39] because that he promised it all right
[18:43] what are we waiting on the What did he
[18:47] say from well I'm against organized
[18:51] religion if what is supposed to the
[18:55] church
[18:56] what is purposed to the church the life
[18:59] that was in Christ
[19:01] now listen isn't refracting in you don't
[19:04] you stand deal unto you
[19:08] and we've got patients virtually all
[19:10] these things in temperature thing and
[19:11] godliness brotherly kindness to these
[19:19] things are we seeking after these
[19:24] virtues no no we don't have to have this
[19:32] we're just ready for the rapture
[19:34] how do you get ready for the rapture
[19:40] if these virtues are required to bring a
[19:44] resurrection why should we we looking
[19:46] for something else to bring the
[19:47] resurrection other than this message to
[19:50] be revealed to you and me are made alive
[19:52] in our hearts and lives why would we not
[19:57] want the word to be true God has given
[20:01] us all of these things and told us how
[20:05] that it would take place do we believe
[20:11] the messenger has brought the message
[20:14] within us these things that will bring
[20:17] that to Pais that he has brought unto
[20:19] you and I we don't have to look for
[20:23] something else well I just don't I don't
[20:26] think we're what we needed we need a
[20:29] whole lot more emotions brother Dale
[20:31] praise God but now how much do you want
[20:35] me to read if you've read the statue of
[20:38] a perfect man if you haven't don't talk
[20:41] to me about it is that plain enough I've
[20:46] asked you probably thirty times in this
[20:49] series to read the statute of a perfect
[20:51] man if you hadn't done don't talk to me
[20:54] about perfection don't talk to me about
[20:56] Christianity don't talk to me about
[20:58] anything if you're not going to study
[21:01] the word I'm trying not to give you my
[21:04] idea I'm trying to read what he says I'm
[21:07] asking you to read what he says
[21:13] but if you refuse to read what he said
[21:15] don't think that God's coming back after
[21:18] you is that plain enough proposal Rep so
[21:23] that's one we don't like you
[21:24] because you just might I make it
[21:26] straight and playing if you don't like
[21:29] it that's up to you but is it the truth
[21:35] if you've read the statue of a perfect
[21:38] man you realize these things these
[21:40] virtues are required and if they're
[21:46] required why would not we want well
[21:51] brother bill then how do we get it the
[21:52] Prophet told you how to get it by
[21:56] studying the message he said it would be
[22:00] these divinely revealed mystery truth
[22:01] that literally turn us back then why
[22:03] would not people want the thunders and
[22:06] the seals and the things we're afraid to
[22:09] get confused honey don't worry about
[22:10] getting confused we was born confused
[22:14] don't worry about that the thing we need
[22:17] to worry about is trying to get rid of
[22:19] our confusion right well I don't like
[22:23] that because I've always been I've
[22:24] always believed the message yeah you
[22:27] don't want to talk to me then okay you
[22:32] don't want to talk to me about it
[22:34] because that's there's no need enough
[22:36] for none of it but now listen what did
[22:38] we get to the life thing now of what we
[22:40] were talking about last Sunday there
[22:44] that we were talking about coming to
[22:47] godliness and what is godliness well
[22:54] brother Brennan said godliness that he
[22:55] looked for the dictionaries and about
[22:57] four or five of them till he finally
[22:59] found the definition like I was saying
[23:02] I've listened already twice this week to
[23:04] that same message so I know what I said
[23:06] Sunday okay you say well I didn't hear
[23:10] you say that well I don't listen to it
[23:11] twice I mean times if you listen to
[23:15] but you see godliness is to be like God
[23:21] why would brother branham say he
[23:23] couldn't find the definition of
[23:25] godliness in a dictionary when you pick
[23:27] up any dictionary and it's got the word
[23:29] godliness in it right have you looked in
[23:36] the dictionary and to see it's got
[23:38] godliness in it but it was not the
[23:41] definition that he was knowing would fit
[23:45] this in the stature of a perfect man
[23:49] godliness in the natural or the wording
[23:51] is to be Pais or to be like you know
[23:55] being God night here or this it's got
[23:58] that to do with it well when the prophet
[24:01] brought it
[24:01] he said if godliness is to be like God
[24:08] well don't worry about being pious and
[24:11] things like that you're not gonna be in
[24:13] any way its to be like God as to how his
[24:17] nature in his ways to where the world
[24:21] can see God in you and me well what do
[24:23] they see what do they think of you at
[24:26] work what do they think of you is your
[24:29] neighbors what do they think of you oh
[24:32] they think we're just a bunch of calls
[24:34] well you know what I don't blame a lot
[24:38] of people for thinking the people of
[24:40] this message or cause because I think
[24:42] they are I've told you over and over I
[24:47] believe the fivefold ministries for the
[24:49] perfecting their science but they said a
[24:51] lot of people that claim to be preachers
[24:52] I don't care about listening to because
[24:57] they're not bringing God's Word so their
[25:01] bio how time to fool with them well
[25:03] brothers l if you listen to until lately
[25:04] no I've done heard too much about all of
[25:07] them times like I said I don't try to
[25:11] bring out things to make deliberately to
[25:15] her but I do hear enough until I can
[25:17] express something to you you know I try
[25:21] to have a decent memory and we're doing
[25:23] it like not waste promised to get me a
[25:24] copy of what was doing life not I've
[25:27] always tried to
[25:30] that adoption was not a thing that the
[25:37] Jews come up with they didn't come up
[25:40] with it the Romans and the Greeks and
[25:44] things come up with the adoption and
[25:46] when the Israelis went under captivity
[25:49] to him they took a lot of those things
[25:52] into their own understanding I said that
[25:56] all along trying to get you to look at
[25:59] the things different whoa no no worry
[26:02] well let us we'll find it because he's
[26:07] somewhere back down through there I
[26:08] heard that I might have heard that in
[26:11] the Baptist Church because you know what
[26:12] we studied adoption when I was in the
[26:15] Baptist Church that's one you you can
[26:23] take brother branham do once you want to
[26:24] he said you better leave him Baptists
[26:27] alone he said they'll tear you apart
[26:29] with the word now that's what he said so
[26:33] we studied the Bible I knew for I left
[26:38] the Baptist Church that being born again
[26:40] been a process of development I knew
[26:43] like I'd ran out the other day where the
[26:45] Bible said he that believeth and is
[26:49] baptized shall be say I could read that
[26:51] in the Baptist Church where was you at
[26:53] I'm talking to the ministers of the time
[26:56] who bless God we don't know no you're
[26:59] sitting back are being deceived it's
[27:01] like it is now
[27:04] but what does godliness mean why would a
[27:08] prophet turndown dictionary definitions
[27:12] until he found the one he wanted just
[27:15] like I said why would he say virtue is
[27:19] not to this live a virgin life or be a
[27:23] virgin that didn't fit the terminologies
[27:27] or thoughts it's being portrayed in the
[27:29] stature of a perfect man for virtue that
[27:33] means power or strength or God's own
[27:36] life a virtuous life not just a virgin
[27:41] you me a virgin be mean
[27:42] it's rattlesnake that's not what he's
[27:46] talking about see your profit then was
[27:48] taking what God was showing him that
[27:52] these virtuous men when he come to
[27:54] temperance our definition is what don't
[27:57] drink alcohol
[28:00] he said that ain't got nothing to do
[28:02] with what we're talking about on this he
[28:08] said it doesn't come to that he said
[28:11] it's that uncontrollable temper for
[28:13] honey now don't it ain't got no temper
[28:15] your face gets red this is leaving me
[28:19] for this a little bit
[28:21] I'll cross you know if it's gonna work
[28:23] the face red or something right sorry
[28:28] but it's true
[28:30] the then we come to those definitions it
[28:34] took a prophet to get the correct
[28:37] definition of what the stature of a
[28:39] perfect man was talking about natural
[28:42] man could read that but he gets the
[28:44] wrong definition so why did he come up
[28:48] with godliness and say well it doesn't
[28:50] mean to be pious it doesn't because the
[28:53] word garland listen you know deals with
[28:55] those forms to our natural understanding
[29:00] but godliness is to be like God you know
[29:04] what it means to be like God is to have
[29:06] the nature of God right the nature of
[29:11] God is to be like God and godliness see
[29:17] then lays it onto the basis that what I
[29:21] love is what your prophet had to say and
[29:23] I've brought this out and I told you
[29:25] that for months I waited to bring last
[29:28] Sunday's message I'm just saying it and
[29:31] you can do what you want to because
[29:33] you're not anyway how many of these
[29:35] listen to life Sunday service over when
[29:37] I told you that I waited four months to
[29:39] bring that I've done listen to it twice
[29:47] and almost
[29:49] I don't believe you're gonna listen to
[29:53] it I understood what you say you did you
[29:57] understood what I was just saying come
[30:02] on say brother branham said when he
[30:06] talks about godliness he said you've
[30:09] come all this way before God expects you
[30:12] to be perfect
[30:14] come on bring it up number five brothers
[30:18] it's natural perfect man let's just read
[30:21] what your prophet had to say about a few
[30:23] thought and what's this point you get
[30:27] genuine faith genuine virtues you and
[30:29] one another Tim you're moving right on
[30:32] up the line all right
[30:34] fearfully add Garland it's oh my now
[30:37] godliness is six but a random is capable
[30:41] of incorrectly giving numbers that's all
[30:44] right he just human all right
[30:47] fearfully add godliness oh my god
[30:50] leanness to be added what does God in
[30:53] this mean I looked in four or five
[30:54] dictionaries and couldn't even find what
[30:57] it meant are you listening
[31:02] he says he couldn't find what it meant
[31:04] whenever different that ever dictionary
[31:06] has the definition of godliness but it
[31:11] was not the definition he was looking
[31:13] for it was not what Peter were talking
[31:16] about as godliness in the stature of a
[31:19] perfect man that form of godliness is
[31:22] man's understanding this is a prophet
[31:27] giving you what God has decided that's
[31:30] where I love it he said he was down in
[31:33] two brothers and he found in a
[31:34] dictionary godliness means to be like
[31:36] guard oh my after and once actually you
[31:39] got faith virtue and all the temperance
[31:40] in place didn't be like God after you've
[31:44] got these things didn't be like God you
[31:48] understand what I'm saying we say oh I
[31:51] just I just get this anywhere I want to
[31:53] see I just needed verse I need knowledge
[31:56] so I don't worry about having virtue
[31:59] you know how no place to put your
[32:01] knowledge
[32:03] if you don't have virtue you mean I
[32:06] can't have knowledge for yeah you can
[32:08] have knowledge first head knowledge you
[32:14] ain't gonna get Holy Ghost knowledge of
[32:16] the true understanding of the Word of
[32:18] God until you get Holy Ghost virtue and
[32:21] you're not gonna get Holy Ghost virtue
[32:23] of the true Holy Ghost until you get
[32:26] Holy Ghost nuber that's where you're
[32:32] studying Paul the man said to him Paul
[32:35] you're much studying has made you my
[32:38] head and that's true if that's all
[32:41] you've got his man's ideas so listen
[32:47] Bert you're not even didn't be like God
[32:50] you say I can't do that brother branham
[32:53] he said oh yes you can I can't be like
[32:58] God he says oh yes you can that's what
[33:07] your prophet said so it's possible to be
[33:10] like God but not the kind that we bring
[33:14] we think of godliness is the past of
[33:17] this daddy I don't drink I don't you I
[33:20] don't smoke at home so I'm like God that
[33:24] ain't what it's talking about it's
[33:27] talking about the reason you don't drink
[33:29] smoke and Jude is what makes you to be
[33:32] like God cuz there's an inward work
[33:34] right come on now watch him you say I
[33:41] can't do that okay but he says now let's
[33:47] read you a few scriptures now he's
[33:50] talking about how to be like God now how
[33:54] are we to be like God brother branham
[34:01] how are we to be like God that's what he
[34:04] said right
[34:05] we say we can't do it he said oh yes you
[34:10] can you can be like God if you have the
[34:14] right understanding of
[34:16] ugliness if you have the wrong
[34:19] understanding of it you'll never be like
[34:21] God so you listen to his understanding
[34:25] if we won't trust him about bringing us
[34:28] words and understand why can't we trust
[34:30] him on the whole thing what's the very
[34:33] scripture he goes to when he's talking
[34:38] about being like God or does he go just
[34:44] let you read a few scriptures here just
[34:47] a minute Matthew 5:48 will take this one
[34:50] and see what it sounds like Matthew 5:48
[34:54] and see if you're supposed to be like
[34:59] God according to Matthew 5:48 right so
[35:10] let's meet Matthew 5:48 to see if we're
[35:13] supposed to be like God see you know the
[35:17] Bible says you're gods jesus said so one
[35:21] all the virtue all the things that's in
[35:25] God is in you there's a new birth
[35:31] there's growth development of the statue
[35:33] of a perfect man it's getting him in us
[35:37] it's not us in him
[35:39] it's him in us right now listen why all
[35:46] the virtue all the things that's in God
[35:49] is in you Matthew 5:48 well we are only
[35:54] read Matthew 5:48 is we don't know how
[35:57] to be perfect we know the Bible says be
[36:00] is our four perfect but we can't be
[36:02] perfect nobody human is perfect you
[36:06] start talking to somebody right now just
[36:08] notice it you start talking about what
[36:10] god when we can't all be perfect you
[36:14] know we all got problems you know we all
[36:18] do wrong you know so nobody can condemn
[36:21] the other person because we're all in
[36:24] the same shape you hadn't heard that
[36:27] talking to people
[36:33] the Bible says we've got to be perfect
[36:39] now how are we going to be perfect
[36:44] listen to them be therefore perfect PE
[36:48] spelt it out what's that perfect even
[36:50] your father in heaven is perfect now
[36:52] this is what I love faith virtue
[36:56] knowledge temperance patience godliness
[36:59] now this is what I love you got way up
[37:03] here now
[37:05] before you're asked to do that to do
[37:07] what he just read B therefore perfect so
[37:12] you got all the way up to godliness
[37:15] before God expects you to be perfect
[37:21] come on church why don't you read so
[37:26] then that means at faith you're not at
[37:29] the perfection you need to be at virtue
[37:32] you still have problems did we go
[37:37] through that that it's not that it's the
[37:42] Verte not to virgin it's C in other
[37:45] words you look at the pyramid you come
[37:48] to godliness so that means there's
[37:51] problems in here that God needs to deal
[37:55] with oh but I don't have no temper
[38:03] brother Dale well the Bible says
[38:06] temperance and the Prophet said it's not
[38:10] to stop drinking alcohol he said it's
[38:13] that uncontrollable temper yeah but I
[38:17] don't have an uncontrollable temper I
[38:19] have you know I don't have no temper no
[38:25] no brother I didn't mean to say that way
[38:28] spitting all in your face what I'm
[38:32] saying is you need right I'm saying he
[38:37] needs ain't saying I need come on
[38:42] just be honest and be sensible don't you
[38:44] understand why would a prophet make a
[38:46] definition that you come all this way
[38:49] you got way up here before you're asked
[38:53] to be perfect so when you're born again
[38:57] as a baby he doesn't expect you to be
[38:59] perfect
[39:01] he's the advocate that takes care of all
[39:04] the time and when we come through that
[39:09] see we come all the way up to godliness
[39:11] now it's being required we're gonna get
[39:15] to some statements brother animate and
[39:17] then you'll see or either we'll get to
[39:20] them next Sunday they were what it takes
[39:22] but you got up here now before you're
[39:25] asked to be perfect God knows that your
[39:30] tempers is not right he knows your
[39:32] patience is not right he knows all of
[39:34] those things are not right right babies
[39:39] growing in grace and knowledge but by
[39:43] the time we come to godliness we ought
[39:46] to start thinking about perfection none
[39:51] of us can be perfect see forget it
[39:53] you're not even in the show you're still
[39:57] in the old Baptist that's what we've
[39:58] done we argued over the word perfection
[40:01] in the Baptist Church Matthew 5:48 was
[40:03] read in the Baptist Church as well as
[40:05] anywhere that where were you at we
[40:08] talked about it we had the definitions
[40:11] correctly I knew in the Baptist Church
[40:13] that the word perfect meant complete
[40:16] because I could read and I knew it had
[40:24] something to do with something that we
[40:26] wasn't gettin because agreed with you we
[40:30] cannot be perfect in ourselves there's
[40:36] no way we can be perfect that's why that
[40:39] brother Adam when he picked the word or
[40:41] the definition of godliness is to be
[40:44] like God he's not in no way referencing
[40:47] the how pious are the deity of God or
[40:51] that you're not supposed to be this are
[40:53] we're supposed to be good people we're
[40:55] supposed to do that
[40:56] the new birth is supposed to take care
[40:57] of those thing we should be those things
[41:00] but God knows we don't always fulfill
[41:03] them yeah with that brother Dale we just
[41:07] don't see these because you you all
[41:09] right you just go ahead and do what you
[41:11] want to of me I passed that fifty years
[41:14] ago what you think about me I'm sorry I
[41:16] don't want it to be I don't want you to
[41:19] think wrong about me but there's one
[41:21] thing I'm gonna do is tell the truth
[41:24] whether you believe it or not I'm gonna
[41:26] tell it like it is I'm gonna read what
[41:28] he says I didn't make that statement he
[41:31] said you got up here now before you're
[41:33] asked to do what to be perfect
[41:35] you come to garland that's before you're
[41:37] asked to be perfect so it's not trying
[41:42] to be good and good and good no it's to
[41:46] be like God as to how these virtues what
[41:48] did we read right above the all the
[41:51] virtue all the things that's in God is
[41:54] in you so how are you made perfect by
[42:00] accepting what he has done for you and I
[42:04] gives us the new birth and he comes and
[42:06] lives in us and brings forth his virtues
[42:13] these are Holy Ghost virtues they're not
[42:16] just virtues of a man that's a good man
[42:18] a good person if Holy Ghost virtue see
[42:22] that's why when he come up with a
[42:24] definition of godliness he could see
[42:26] that we have troubles you know what
[42:29] brother when I got born again I had no
[42:31] trouble since then you just lied not
[42:34] enough like I said to our Wednesday
[42:37] night a woman asked her tobho you know
[42:40] they don't you pray for my tongue he
[42:45] said that's poor fit over 14 foot I
[42:48] think was the word of you he said if not
[42:50] long enough to get your tongue on your
[42:53] tongue longer than this pulpit that's
[42:57] pretty rough but was it the truth she
[43:02] admitted her tongue was her problem
[43:04] he was just analyzing how big it be
[43:09] take whole lot more than 14-foot right
[43:13] let's see if we think one well he would
[43:15] just be in a smarty because he had a bad
[43:17] tongue come on do what you don't but you
[43:21] got all the way up here and listen all
[43:24] these things has to be added first now
[43:27] look then when you get up here up her
[43:31] godliness when you get to godliness he's
[43:37] asked you now to be perfect godliness
[43:41] sons and daughters of God that's right
[43:44] to be perfect because as I said he knows
[43:49] that we've got problem with the virtues
[43:52] he knows we got I meant to stage about
[43:54] six months on that little word knowledge
[43:56] because God knows we've took her own
[43:59] knowledge that's not the knowledge of
[44:03] man that's the knowledge of God we've
[44:07] took her own knowledge to figure it out
[44:09] we're not going to listen to nobody out
[44:12] Scott we got her own understanding well
[44:15] how do you feel since that's fine but
[44:16] look he comes all the way up to
[44:20] godliness
[44:21] now he's telling the church that we need
[44:23] to be made perfect is that enough to
[44:31] verse to understand he's asked you you
[44:35] got all the way up here he's asked you
[44:38] now to be perfect and we're going to get
[44:44] to some things in here in a minute we're
[44:45] brother Branham cuz I've been over over
[44:47] it with you but Ron said the Holy Ghost
[44:49] has not been correctly taught did we
[44:56] teach it as the nuber we teach it as
[44:58] this we teaches is that we teach it but
[45:00] he said it's not been correctly told
[45:02] what's he mean we've got a statement
[45:08] right in here that will read it for how
[45:09] time brother Branham says you come up
[45:11] here to godliness and he said you ain't
[45:14] got the Holy Ghost yet
[45:21] that's what he said are we gonna believe
[45:26] what does he meaning you see that's
[45:31] where I don't worry about my job
[45:33] I don't worry about the fivefold
[45:36] ministry I don't worry about my job as a
[45:41] minister because see I know what my job
[45:43] is then when you read that the Prophet
[45:49] said we got all the way up here to
[45:50] godliness and we ain't got the Holy
[45:53] Ghost here you realize what kind of
[45:55] doctrines that started they've started
[45:59] an O Holy Ghost doctrine that the world
[46:02] is deceived by to believe you ain't got
[46:07] the Holy Ghost that ain't what the
[46:10] prophets talking about well he said it
[46:17] that's true but what do you think he's
[46:21] talking about I think he's talking about
[46:25] just what he's saying you come all this
[46:27] way up to godliness now God expects you
[46:31] to be perfect which is complete he
[46:36] expects you to start coming into a
[46:38] completeness not a perfection of daily
[46:41] lives those things should have been
[46:42] taken care of in our new birth now I am
[46:48] NOT talking about somebody living like
[46:51] the devil lying cheating stealing all
[46:55] kind of things murderers adulterers and
[46:58] things like that
[46:58] that ain't what he's talking about in
[47:01] here that we have problems with if we
[47:06] have problems with adulteries and things
[47:08] like that we need the new birth if we
[47:12] have troubled with adult reason and
[47:14] fornication we need the new birth it is
[47:18] not that well God overlooked sometimes
[47:22] now he just knows we're gonna have them
[47:28] well they don't matter about me being a
[47:30] little bit I got a little bit of temper
[47:32] I know but everybody's got a little bit
[47:34] well what does that justify does that
[47:36] make it okay right everybody picking on
[47:41] Trump because Trump got this from my dad
[47:45] and we got right to me that do you
[47:51] understand what I'm getting there he
[47:54] said we've come all this way now God
[47:57] expects us to be perfect okay now how
[48:03] does he expect perfection to come I
[48:10] ain't gonna ask him it was here like
[48:12] Sunday I don't want to ask this two
[48:14] simple question don't raise your hand
[48:16] just leave it down because you don't
[48:19] want to get trapped but how many of you
[48:23] call to order are the layout of last
[48:29] Sunday that would bring the church to
[48:31] perfection just don't raise your hand
[48:34] don't cuz they don't need to but just
[48:37] admit in your own mind well I didn't
[48:40] really hear anything about it well at
[48:43] least you're being honest so you can be
[48:45] on that side with God I don't remember
[48:48] what you say it well that's all right
[48:52] just don't lie to yourself you know you
[48:57] know you're not going to deceive nobody
[48:58] lying to yourself only yourself right so
[49:02] just be honest and say I was I didn't
[49:05] understand would you please explain it
[49:06] again how are we going to become to the
[49:10] point of being perfect we know it's not
[49:18] talking about perfect as of godliness
[49:21] type of a form of deities or lives or
[49:26] sinless perfection it will never happen
[49:34] it is whether
[49:36] or not we can rest in him for what had
[49:39] I'd rather have a perpetuation for my
[49:41] sins than to have no sin at all it's
[49:46] over you're strong I'm strong I draw the
[49:51] note that I got something to cover it
[49:53] then to not know whether I got anything
[49:56] at all let me at least how the
[50:00] perpetuation for my sins let me keep it
[50:05] that away all right go ahead come on
[50:09] let's read a little bit further now I
[50:13] gave you this last Sunday I think that
[50:16] you know that's what comes up be
[50:18] therefore perfect even as your father in
[50:19] heaven now what does that word perfect
[50:21] mean what does that word perfect we've
[50:25] got to be perfect what does it mean so
[50:29] you're gonna go to a sinless perfection
[50:31] or some great thing to be what does it
[50:35] mean here's your definition the
[50:39] definition of the word perfect is a full
[50:44] age bra to its end now see if you can
[50:50] find anything in here to make us good
[50:55] wanting nothing necessary to
[50:58] completeness you know what I'm saying in
[51:01] other words there's not anything to be
[51:02] added to this to make it whatever it is
[51:04] it's gonna make us perfect okay be
[51:06] nothing added to it huh it's not me and
[51:09] you added see that which is perfect
[51:12] consummate human integrity and virtue of
[51:16] men full-grown adult of full age was
[51:22] there anything of the word perfect that
[51:24] has any definition of any sinless form
[51:30] because we think B therefore perfect
[51:33] even as a father in heaven is perfect
[51:34] well he didn't sin so we don't sin no he
[51:39] didn't sin but we are seeing you ever
[51:42] get to the point do you think you don't
[51:44] see in your the biggest center there is
[51:46] in the building
[51:47] can I be that way
[51:51] all right so then words any definition
[51:55] of perfection they would have anything
[51:57] to do with anything in our lives it's
[52:00] fully dependent upon a full-grown it's
[52:05] alright so now look you come all the way
[52:08] up through here God knowing you and how
[52:11] trouble with your faith your virtue your
[52:13] knowledge your temperance your patience
[52:16] and then when you come to godliness
[52:19] now he's knows that you're beginning to
[52:22] get to a state of being perfect because
[52:27] by then you've done realized God's
[52:30] taking care of it that is not my faith
[52:34] that's his faith given to me that is not
[52:36] my virtue that is his virtue given to me
[52:38] that is not my knowledge that's his
[52:40] knowledge given unto me right that's the
[52:44] only way I can have a perfection is what
[52:46] he imparts not what I do or don't do
[52:51] come on you want to go with the rich
[52:53] young ruler what did he say what did
[52:57] Jesus say to him when he said if
[52:59] anything I can do didn't hurt the
[53:01] kingdom jesus said don't do this don't
[53:03] do that do this do that do this
[53:04] he said I've done every one of them from
[53:07] my youth now Jesus never argued with him
[53:12] and said now wait a minute now you done
[53:13] this over here you pull this dirty deal
[53:15] here he agreed with him he never thrown
[53:22] off on him he said the only thing I see
[53:25] wrong with you you need to sell what you
[53:27] got and give it to the poor because he
[53:29] knew where his heart was his heart was
[53:32] in his back pocket his money his money
[53:37] was worried heart was that and the love
[53:40] of money is a root of all evil money's
[53:42] not so then he understand for our
[53:46] understanding of the rich young ruler he
[53:50] was perfect in our eyes right because he
[53:53] didn't do he done what he was supposed
[53:55] to do and didn't do what he's supposed
[53:57] to not do he was perfect
[54:00] Jesus never said you're perfect
[54:03] he just hit him with one thing that he
[54:05] knew that would cross him he knew there
[54:07] was no need of arguing with him on a
[54:08] perfection because he had done these
[54:10] things what about the Apostle Paul
[54:15] naming all his life and said according
[54:18] to the law blameless
[54:21] you know God didn't come to him because
[54:24] of his blindness you know not being not
[54:27] being wrong he came to him because he
[54:29] predestinated it they knew what would
[54:32] take place and what Paul would be he
[54:34] never come to him because he was perfect
[54:38] don't you ever think you could be good
[54:41] enough to even be saved there's where
[54:43] the trouble is people tries to get good
[54:46] enough let's say if I could just quit
[54:48] all these things then God would save me
[54:50] that is not Bible there is no scripture
[54:53] for any of that the scripture is us to
[54:56] realize we're lost then God can do
[54:59] something about it but listen to be like
[55:07] God he goes to Matthew 5:48 right when
[55:14] he's covered to be like God he goes to
[55:16] Matthew 5:48 alright what's the next
[55:21] scripture well I don't do this and I
[55:29] don't do that under stage no no no he
[55:31] doesn't go to that what's the next
[55:32] scripture come on Jules you listening
[55:38] what's the next scripture that brother
[55:39] Branham used you're supposed to read the
[55:42] book you supposed to have been in the
[55:45] service life Sunday listening to what
[55:47] was saying what's the next scripture
[55:50] that he goes to come on run it up
[55:54] brothers he goes to Ephesians four where
[56:00] we don't want him to go is it all right
[56:06] now with all the choices you had brother
[56:12] branham why you're going to Asians for
[56:14] what's the seasons for
[56:16] how are you gonna become perfect how are
[56:23] you gonna become perfect how are you
[56:25] gonna match up Matthew 5:48 and be
[56:27] perfect
[56:28] how're you gonna do it the Prophet we
[56:30] just read are men to go take all these
[56:32] virtuous put it in the individual you've
[56:33] got God right
[56:35] what does he go to he goes to Ephesians
[56:41] 4 and find out over here what in the
[56:46] book of Ephesians it says about this
[56:49] thing what's the thing he's talking
[56:51] about being therefore perfect even as
[56:54] your father in heaven is perfect
[56:56] let's go to Ephesians 4 to find out what
[56:59] it's about
[57:00] here in the book of Ephesians see what
[57:02] Ephesians says about this thing to be
[57:06] about how we should how we should do it
[57:10] how can we come to it in other words
[57:12] been seasons the 4th chapter and begin
[57:15] with the 12 verse alright let's begin
[57:18] here 2:11 her and he gave some apostles
[57:22] how are you going to be perfect
[57:30] now do we believe that a pastor minister
[57:37] of powerful ministry is to be the
[57:40] connection between God and man now there
[57:43] is a question I'm asking you you gonna
[57:45] shake your head and say you don't
[57:46] believe it
[57:46] now brother Branham is my connection
[57:49] between God and man that's what
[57:50] everybody says
[57:51] yeah well brother Browns not here no
[57:55] that's not derogatory or against
[57:57] anything he's not here so we can't go to
[58:01] him right how about the fivefold
[58:07] ministry how we gonna be made perfect
[58:11] and he gave some apostles and some
[58:14] prophets remember lies not don't take
[58:17] the other man's office he's on adoption
[58:18] right and some evangelists some pastors
[58:20] or some teachers for the perfecting of
[58:23] God does it read like that congregation
[58:27] says no the perfection of what
[58:32] who are the Saints the sanctified ones
[58:37] amen the ones that started from down
[58:40] here the ones that started that faith
[58:51] you say I don't depend on thoughtful
[58:53] okay forget it forget it
[58:57] if I ain't going to depend on the FIFO
[58:59] ministry I'll paint on cars and nobody I
[59:01] ain't gonna be into nothing I'm just
[59:04] gonna tell everybody forget it and see
[59:10] you can't pay you talk to a tape
[59:12] recorder you can only pay your tithe
[59:17] that where you get fed you're supposed
[59:18] to get fed from a pastor yeah but I
[59:20] don't believe that okay I'm no problem
[59:22] you believe what you want to ain't
[59:24] trying to do that I'm trying to get you
[59:26] to see one thing the truth will cut
[59:29] every one of us to pieces don't come to
[59:33] me then I don't believe this under don't
[59:35] come to me and don't let this now let's
[59:36] tell you forget it take your money and
[59:39] go on do what you want to I told the man
[59:42] the other day about money I said I give
[59:45] you a perfect right to take your money
[59:49] and put the house roof on the Widders
[59:53] house I've done that many times I've
[1:00:00] done it through this church so many
[1:00:01] times and not telling nobody
[1:00:03] just tell them say okay take this and do
[1:00:05] that we didn't do that as far as I'm
[1:00:07] concerned that's your tithe now you
[1:00:11] can't go do it yourself without my
[1:00:13] permission
[1:00:14] first off number one because you're
[1:00:17] doing of your own presumption would you
[1:00:19] come to me I'll give you a perfect right
[1:00:20] to go build a house for somebody you
[1:00:23] know long as it's right the because I
[1:00:28] don't care about you money
[1:00:34] I don't care about what you do in your
[1:00:36] life and your money and your doings
[1:00:38] that's between you and God because this
[1:00:42] church is gonna operate and God's gonna
[1:00:48] take care of it
[1:00:49] he always has without having to take an
[1:00:53] offering from the people right okay pull
[1:00:56] it back up to where we're at all right
[1:00:58] so he's going to her he's going to
[1:01:00] Ephesians forward what's Ephesians 4 he
[1:01:03] gave some apostles some prophets some
[1:01:06] pastors some evangelists what far what
[1:01:10] did he give it far what does it say in
[1:01:13] Ephesians he gave some apostles prophets
[1:01:16] teach what for the perfecting of the
[1:01:19] Saints the words their perfection any
[1:01:24] other way outside the fivefold ministry
[1:01:26] now you tell me that well I don't like
[1:01:30] your ad okay I don't like you either
[1:01:32] is that solve the problem we got to get
[1:01:37] into the popularity form you know we
[1:01:42] just leave it that way I like what he
[1:01:45] says then let me follow what he says
[1:01:48] voluntarily not because of a book of
[1:01:51] rules this got to be done look for the
[1:01:55] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[1:01:59] the ministry the ministry of Jesus
[1:02:02] Christ for the edifying of the body of
[1:02:06] Christ for the edifying building it up
[1:02:09] edifying until till we come into the
[1:02:13] unity of the faith and the knowledge of
[1:02:15] the Son of God and how are you gonna
[1:02:17] come that without the fivefold ministry
[1:02:18] if that's Christmas to the perfect man
[1:02:22] unto the assurance oh my to the measure
[1:02:28] of the stature how we're gonna come to
[1:02:34] the statute of perfect man it's gonna be
[1:02:36] through the fivefold ministry
[1:02:41] I don't have to have fivefold ministry
[1:02:43] I'll make it on my own okay well no
[1:02:46] problem I'm not gonna disown you
[1:02:50] or throw you out of the church because
[1:02:51] you don't believe what I say because
[1:02:54] it's up to God to reveal it to you
[1:02:56] anyway let's see that's where it's come
[1:03:02] to that point the ones that started down
[1:03:05] here continue on perfect takes godliness
[1:03:13] you have to add to your faith God in
[1:03:15] this see you start off down here with
[1:03:18] virtue yeah is that enough plain dumb
[1:03:22] well I went back and porn dad you say I
[1:03:24] don't leave brother branham didn't do
[1:03:25] that now blows around was doing it now
[1:03:27] because he's putting their virtue right
[1:03:31] you start down here with virtue then you
[1:03:34] go to knowledge then you go to
[1:03:35] temperance then you go to patience now
[1:03:37] your own godliness godliness oh my and
[1:03:40] my time is getting away but you know
[1:03:43] what godliness meant you sung it to be
[1:03:46] like God on so what now look what he
[1:03:51] says after he comes down after you done
[1:03:53] come from here to here to here to here
[1:03:57] to here to here now because he count
[1:04:00] them coming up okay
[1:04:01] now you're coming into the full stature
[1:04:04] now the son of God work at godliness
[1:04:11] because you're taking on his nature his
[1:04:14] ways you've gotten away from your own
[1:04:18] temperance and your own virtues and your
[1:04:20] own patience isn't that now you're going
[1:04:23] to go because that's when we hit the
[1:04:25] next one you're gonna hear me screaming
[1:04:27] holler that much more on brotherly
[1:04:29] kindness but brother Brennan said is not
[1:04:34] too bad to keeping an individual but he
[1:04:37] said to keep brotherly kindness in a
[1:04:38] group he said it's hard to do
[1:04:48] now you're coming into the full stature
[1:04:51] it now of a son of God but you've got to
[1:04:54] have this plus all this and you can't
[1:04:58] even start until you get this now what's
[1:05:00] he saying you got to have this you got
[1:05:02] to have this but you can't start until
[1:05:05] you get this
[1:05:06] you can't start till you get the new
[1:05:08] birth because that's what brings in the
[1:05:11] body get down here at genuine born again
[1:05:14] duh then you don't have don't add
[1:05:17] nothing it adds to you see come throwing
[1:05:21] up all right coming into perfection now
[1:05:27] we still got brotherly kindness and we
[1:05:34] got a little thing your prophet called
[1:05:36] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost now
[1:05:42] that's in the stature of a perfect man
[1:05:44] so you need to read you know I'm trying
[1:05:48] to encourage you to read what he says
[1:05:50] because that's what's good about it what
[1:05:52] he says is what I say now but what does
[1:05:55] he say all right
[1:05:58] he says you're birthed into this into
[1:06:00] this into this that's on blasphemous
[1:06:02] name so let's just read this one and
[1:06:04] then we're gonna stop cuz we're gonna
[1:06:06] make a flop and then we're gonna stop
[1:06:09] we're gonna give you a whole week to
[1:06:11] think over and get it all figured out
[1:06:14] what you think it is because what did he
[1:06:21] say now you know yourself blessing yes
[1:06:24] name statue of perfect man are the same
[1:06:27] thing that's a perfect man he did not
[1:06:30] describe the lady's dream he goes to
[1:06:34] blasphemous names to describe the lady's
[1:06:36] dream of what he taught in the stature
[1:06:39] of a perfect man so it's the same time
[1:06:42] so now here we're going to blast eNOS
[1:06:44] not to my knowledge I had temperance or
[1:06:47] self-control I like that my country tis
[1:06:50] of the crown my soul will self-control
[1:06:52] from sea to shining sea patience oh my
[1:06:54] tested don't you worry Satan will count
[1:06:57] them for you but look what he said I'm
[1:07:00] coming up the ladder now I've had
[1:07:03] adverse your knowledge temperance and
[1:07:05] now I got to add patience now as he
[1:07:09] named in it coming out and he said now
[1:07:12] I've got to add patience and what does
[1:07:15] he say I still ain't got the Holy Ghost
[1:07:28] now that sounds totally contrary to
[1:07:31] everything that he taught in the statute
[1:07:32] of perfect man and everything I've
[1:07:35] talked for 50 years is up on that basis
[1:07:39] that that statement that he made is
[1:07:41] right and when brother Branham say it
[1:07:49] the Holy Ghost is not correctly taught
[1:07:57] he makes no statement he said I ain't
[1:08:00] got the Holy Ghost yet I teach and
[1:08:07] believe this was brought up last night
[1:08:11] and I thank God for because off the
[1:08:14] message you must be born again brother
[1:08:17] Brennan said I teach and I believe and
[1:08:21] believe can sufficiently proved by the
[1:08:25] scripture that would be 10 11 12 if
[1:08:28] you're trying to bring it up they might
[1:08:29] already have it up there it would be
[1:08:32] like two more it's you must be born
[1:08:34] again I teach and believe and believe
[1:08:37] can sufficiently proved by the scripture
[1:08:41] that you are born of the Spirit and then
[1:08:47] baptized into the body by the Holy
[1:08:50] Spirit I teach and believing can
[1:08:55] sufficiently prove by the scriptures
[1:08:58] that you're born again to the spirit and
[1:09:00] then baptized into the body by the Holy
[1:09:03] Spirit how could that be
[1:09:11] how could that be because that sounds
[1:09:14] like two or three different things that
[1:09:17] sounds like brother Brennan was contrary
[1:09:19] to it believe that you're born to the
[1:09:23] spirit and then baptized into the bottle
[1:09:27] but I thought the baptism was the Holy
[1:09:29] Spirit I thought this was that I'm gonna
[1:09:34] say it and you ain't gonna like it
[1:09:35] that's why you gotta have a fire four
[1:09:39] minutes can I do this I trying to make
[1:09:47] myself to be one of them but you've got
[1:09:50] to have a five fold ministry to
[1:09:51] understand the things brother Brown and
[1:09:53] see it because some of the things he
[1:09:55] said or it's blind into the natural
[1:09:59] point as could ever be when he said I
[1:10:05] believe you are born again and then
[1:10:10] baptized into the body there's plenty of
[1:10:13] statements that brother running mate
[1:10:15] that sounds so wrong but yet are so
[1:10:24] right
[1:10:32] I say with him that I can prove other
[1:10:34] scriptures that you're born of the
[1:10:37] Spirit and then baptized into the body
[1:10:40] by the Holy Spirit do we believe that I
[1:10:52] don't believe what he said to her well
[1:10:55] okay now are you gonna correct him and
[1:10:57] it's up to you just remember what you
[1:11:02] say is up to you you say I don't believe
[1:11:05] he's right there we'll show me why he's
[1:11:10] not right but I got all these other
[1:11:17] quotes are you saying that quote is
[1:11:20] wrong it sure does sound like it is then
[1:11:31] without a fivefold ministry to put it
[1:11:32] together you're still just as confused
[1:11:37] because remember what the powerful
[1:11:39] ministry is supposed to do take the
[1:11:41] things the prophets say it and break it
[1:11:43] down to the congregation come on
[1:11:45] musician break it down to the
[1:11:47] congregation
[1:11:49] if the fifo ministry is right and is for
[1:11:54] the perfecting of the saints according
[1:11:56] to the prophet of god then we have to
[1:11:59] depend upon the fivefold ministry no by
[1:12:04] dependence upon brother Branham upon
[1:12:07] what was he a prophet that was massively
[1:12:11] confused about the new birth when he
[1:12:16] says you believe unto eternal life you
[1:12:22] believe unto eternal life but then
[1:12:24] you're baptized into the body for the
[1:12:26] gifts of the time which is exactly right
[1:12:33] you see P
[1:12:34] don't want to say what brother branham
[1:12:35] said I like it like this was I've
[1:12:41] speaking of the ministers meeting with
[1:12:42] Salman and this brother he got up behind
[1:12:45] me he said there's one thing I don't
[1:12:47] like is when a guy gets up and asked the
[1:12:51] question and said he's the only one in
[1:12:55] the building that's got the answer
[1:12:58] because I when I asked the question I
[1:13:00] said come and explain it now come bring
[1:13:06] your understanding and explain it I was
[1:13:09] being as honest as I could I wasn't
[1:13:11] trying to be sarcastic or hateful I just
[1:13:13] made a statement brother I know mate I
[1:13:15] said come down and show me it's wrong
[1:13:17] they knew better than to get up and show
[1:13:19] that brother branham was wrong they
[1:13:21] wanted to get up and show I was wrong
[1:13:23] but there's afraid because I'd already
[1:13:24] caught him what he said and I wasn't
[1:13:28] saying this is what I say I said this is
[1:13:30] what the Prophet says now come up here
[1:13:32] and showed me the Prophet was wrong oh
[1:13:34] they weren't gonna do that what does
[1:13:39] that make you something yeah that makes
[1:13:41] me just hard to hit it enough to believe
[1:13:44] God's Word is right and hard-headed
[1:13:47] enough to know this message is right
[1:13:50] this message is perfect now the one that
[1:13:52] brought it had imperfections in his
[1:13:55] speech and in his errors and dates and
[1:13:58] times and parts because he was a human
[1:14:00] being
[1:14:00] but his message is right and I don't
[1:14:09] have to go to this message to this
[1:14:11] message to prove he's wrong he's right
[1:14:18] he just needs somebody to believe it and
[1:14:24] wait for God to give the answer to the
[1:14:29] truth that doesn't make it a statement
[1:14:34] then while they're getting ready on
[1:14:36] Daniel 70 weeks brother Branham says six
[1:14:39] or seven times that there's one week
[1:14:41] left after the rapture but the people is
[1:14:46] this message angle and quote that for
[1:14:47] nothing in the world are you gonna say
[1:14:51] he was seven times wrong because he's
[1:14:54] the one who made a statement no they
[1:14:56] threw it high for your threat - wait let
[1:14:58] me see he didn't say that
[1:15:03] you're correcting him next when you and
[1:15:09] Lord I've often said the devil don't
[1:15:17] need he's went on vacation when the pre
[1:15:20] pull of this message come up and started
[1:15:23] trying to follow and teach the message
[1:15:25] in their way the devil went on vacation
[1:15:28] because he don't need nothing he just
[1:15:30] goes off to itself and lets the people
[1:15:31] fight it out because that's all it's
[1:15:35] been is if I come on yet brother where
[1:15:37] we got what are you saying godliness is
[1:15:41] to be like God the greatest definition
[1:15:45] your prophet could give was all of these
[1:15:48] virtues within us but he said you could
[1:15:51] come all of this way before God expects
[1:15:54] you to be perfect you come all the way
[1:15:57] up to godliness now he expects you to be
[1:16:00] perfect you come up to godliness you can
[1:16:02] have an understanding your growth
[1:16:04] development starts in your understanding
[1:16:07] that you can follow what he's saying
[1:16:09] then you'll see why he said you're born
[1:16:12] again and then baptized into the body he
[1:16:19] said I don't believe that what are you
[1:16:23] saying the Prophet was wrong I'm saying
[1:16:27] he said what he wanted to say and what
[1:16:30] he said was the truth give you a whole
[1:16:35] week to think about the things brother
[1:16:38] Branham said that sounds so contrary if
[1:16:42] you'll just wait on God
[1:16:43] they'll come forth and the most
[1:16:46] beautiful picture that could ever be
[1:16:48] done now humanly speaking he made
[1:16:50] mistakes
[1:16:52] speech he made mistakes right that's not
[1:16:57] the message the next message he's not
[1:16:59] brought around him when he says on one
[1:17:01] message
[1:17:01] the white and black will died again died
[1:17:03] a fight again and die like flies the
[1:17:06] next message people won't listen the
[1:17:08] next message he said that was not God
[1:17:11] telling me there that was my own idea we
[1:17:17] see we won't go like that we just quote
[1:17:19] I got this quote quote she'll kill you
[1:17:23] it quotes yourself to death it'll kill
[1:17:27] ya well what do we got any buddy having
[1:17:34] a DD alders open the way he was

[1:19:16] let me lay out some time now
[1:19:18] just know
[1:19:22] and be willing to stand on God
[1:19:26] don't let them be like people a brother
[1:19:28] my brothers tighten up and hit one time
[1:19:30] brother George was talking to a man that
[1:19:33] 3/4 of the Bible are more by memory but
[1:19:37] he was a trinitarian come to straighten
[1:19:39] them out and they're they just in a
[1:19:41] little bit talking to him about the
[1:19:44] scriptures and they had him so tired up
[1:19:47] till he would not even say the name
[1:19:51] Jesus he knew where he was tied up and
[1:19:57] he wouldn't even use the name of Jesus
[1:20:03] at least he knew worried that he knew he
[1:20:06] had no hopes and he didn't want to say
[1:20:08] Jesus cuz they just said who is he he's
[1:20:14] the Alpha and the Omega the beginning
[1:20:15] and the end and he's all in all his name
[1:20:17] of Jesus the man was afraid to say it
[1:20:21] yet he could come in there he came in
[1:20:23] deliberately to straighten them out but
[1:20:28] when they asked him a few questions
[1:20:29] about Jesus he couldn't answer their
[1:20:34] question is that over our hearts and our
[1:20:39] life as this message brought Jesus to
[1:20:42] you what does it matter we're dates and
[1:20:45] times and seasons out there of them
[1:20:48] talking about this and that was wrong
[1:20:50] this was wrong that was wrong as this
[1:20:54] message brought you to Jesus Christ
[1:20:57] glory hallelujah then the word is right
[1:21:03] [Music]
[1:21:06] you said well they've got this they got
[1:21:09] that they got their own ideas I heard
[1:21:15] one the other night where they was
[1:21:16] proving brother Brian said his mother
[1:21:17] was like 13 years old when he's born and
[1:21:20] this lady proved by census report that
[1:21:23] she would have had to been about 22
[1:21:25] years old what's that matter
[1:21:31] what does it matter
[1:21:35] you know sensors are not always right
[1:21:37] sistahs is made by people that just have
[1:21:40] a knowledge of things I've got an aunt
[1:21:46] that all she ever knew about her
[1:21:47] children one of them was born in cotton
[1:21:50] ticking time she couldn't give you the
[1:21:52] month when I was born in corn picking
[1:21:56] time when I was born when that great
[1:21:58] storm come through she never knew any
[1:22:01] other birthdays now you asked her a
[1:22:05] census report and what would it look
[1:22:07] like well JC he was born in cotton
[1:22:11] pickin time will write that older census
[1:22:13] report you understand what I'm saying we
[1:22:17] want to put on all of these great things
[1:22:19] that we hear up when it's watch somebody
[1:22:21] come up with all of these things has
[1:22:26] been burnt down the buildings were
[1:22:28] burning Atlanta and destroyed all of
[1:22:31] your records and things
[1:22:34] [Music]
[1:22:36] you know the greatest record there is in
[1:22:39] all forms how many knows what it is the
[1:22:43] greatest record of anything that there
[1:22:45] is about people you know where it's at
[1:22:48] the Mormon Church if you want to know
[1:22:54] where your family come from contact the
[1:22:57] Mormon Church they have the greatest
[1:23:02] records their records are the purest
[1:23:05] records of all records because they kept
[1:23:10] up with it they mighta kept up with it a
[1:23:13] storm blow the way and done this out of
[1:23:15] the other but they got two records you
[1:23:19] say what do you say we can't depend on
[1:23:21] anything it's not whether this was a
[1:23:23] date writer that was a date right it's
[1:23:26] whether or not Jesus Christ has been
[1:23:28] brought to you and I buy this message in
[1:23:31] the in turn thank God for that that he's
[1:23:35] given us his own life in doing and he's
[1:23:38] come to prove it what do I care whether
[1:23:40] they can prove this that or the other I
[1:23:43] just look them in the face and say thank
[1:23:46] God for the truth you may be right about
[1:23:50] what you talking about
[1:23:51] but that didn't bring me to Christ but
[1:23:54] this prophet message has brought me to
[1:23:58] Christ then you go out to argue with God
[1:24:01] about it cuz I gonna argue II we face
[1:24:06] these doctrines in the seventy's church
[1:24:09] this is not new doctrines they're the
[1:24:12] old doctrines of we had ministers
[1:24:14] meetings in 1970 over whether or not
[1:24:17] brother Branham was wrong on his dates
[1:24:19] out in Colorado and things like that but
[1:24:24] see people don't want to go with those
[1:24:26] things they want to go with what they
[1:24:30] think somebody said and they're just
[1:24:34] breaking the people the message apart
[1:24:37] because if you can touch that mind of
[1:24:40] the human being to stop them from
[1:24:42] believing that the message is right you
[1:24:45] got two people defeated
[1:24:49] they're totally defeated but we want to
[1:24:55] fit in those classes that's why I holler
[1:24:58] and scream like I do I want us to be to
[1:25:02] the bases at one thing we can stand on
[1:25:04] God's Word and don't care what anybody
[1:25:07] says the word is right yeah but that
[1:25:12] Bible can't be trusted well who gave you
[1:25:16] the right to say that I'd have to first
[1:25:20] learn to trust you right what about it
[1:25:25] father we've tried our best to dismiss
[1:25:29] sincere and always have been to believe
[1:25:32] your word is true and forever settled in
[1:25:35] heaven and then we doubt our doubts when
[1:25:39] it comes to mankind trying to prove this
[1:25:41] that or the other we come to back to the
[1:25:43] Word of God and what God has to say
[1:25:46] about all the things and you said it
[1:25:49] would be here and the people would fall
[1:25:52] away and now this falling away but yet
[1:25:59] your little bride is going right on down
[1:26:01] the road saying thank you Lord we
[1:26:05] believe you thank you for being right
[1:26:07] and taking care of us guiding us through
[1:26:09] the truth we don't have to worry about
[1:26:12] it
[1:26:13] we just committed to you lord thank you
[1:26:15] for all things got us now forgive us of
[1:26:18] the things we'd say or something that
[1:26:20] would be contrary to any thoughts or
[1:26:22] whatsoever and just help us to anchor in
[1:26:25] you and let your word have the
[1:26:28] preeminence in each one of us we love
[1:26:30] you and we thank you in Jesus name you
[1:26:33] just mean it's probably one for another
