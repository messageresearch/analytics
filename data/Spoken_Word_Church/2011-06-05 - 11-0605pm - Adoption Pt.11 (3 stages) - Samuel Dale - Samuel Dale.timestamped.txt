[25:13] 8 Ephesians 1 and First Kings
[25:16] 8 enjoyed that song Because amen I
[25:20] believe the greatest miracle that could

[25:24] birth a child into his
[25:26] kingdom the change of the body and all
[25:28] that's on account of that that's that
[25:30] just comes because of being what it is
[25:32] the greatest of all is the birth into
[25:34] the kingdom amen we appreciate it
[25:37] amen just remember now brother prash

[28:01] manifestation of the Sons and Daughters
[28:03] of God that he's trying to make you
[28:05] known so you come on the scene and do
[28:08] signs and wonders to make known your

[28:24] name amen amen Ephesians
[28:31] 1 blessed be the God and father of our
[28:33] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[28:35] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[28:37] places in Christ according as he has
[28:40] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[28:42] of the world that we should be holy and
[28:44] Without Blame before him in love having
[28:47] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[28:49] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[28:52] according to the good pleasure of his
[28:53] will to the praise of the glory of his
[28:56] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[28:59] in the Beloved now let's just go back
[29:01] and read here
[29:03] in First
[29:05] Kings it's kind of where we left off
[29:07] this morning of the coming into the
[29:10] thing and I want to make sure and
[29:11] emphasize a scripture that's in here
[29:14] because some people may read that and
[29:15] say well brother Dale you was off this
[29:17] morning well all right we'll we'll read
[29:20] it and then Express cuz I said that the
[29:23] the Ark of the Covenant when it was
[29:25] brought in you know was the the two
[29:27] tables of stone but there were Side
[29:28] Pockets you read There were Side Pockets
[29:30] that had the other five books in it but
[29:33] when it's listed here it says that there
[29:36] was nothing in the ark save the two
[29:38] tables of stone well that's in the Ark
[29:41] part to where it's made out the others
[29:43] were side pockets in the carrying and in
[29:46] doing the things that Moses had put in
[29:49] there so you know just remember that and
[29:51] then that way somebody come along say
[29:53] look at that you missed it well we might
[29:55] not have missed it so let's go to to
[29:58] First Kings
[30:01] 8 in verse one then Solomon assembled
[30:04] the Elders of Israel and all the heads
[30:05] of the tribes the chief of the fathers
[30:07] of the children of Israel unto King
[30:09] Solomon in Jerusalem that they might
[30:13] bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the
[30:15] Lord out of the city of David which is
[30:17] Zion and all the men of Israel assembled
[30:20] themselves unto King Solomon at the
[30:23] feast in the month eaman which is the
[30:26] seventh month that's really
[30:29] um it's the 7th month 10th day is the
[30:32] same as Leviticus 23 all right and all
[30:35] the Elders of Israel came and the priest
[30:37] took up the ark and they brought up the
[30:39] Ark of the Lord and the Tabernacle of
[30:42] the congregation and all the holy
[30:44] vessels that were in the Tabernacle even
[30:46] those did the priests and the Levites
[30:49] bring up and King Solomon and all the
[30:52] congregation of Israel that were
[30:53] assembled unto him were with him before
[30:56] the ark sacrificing sheep deep in Oxen
[30:59] that could not be told nor numbered for
[31:01] multitude and the priest brought in the
[31:03] Ark of the Covenant of the Lord unto his
[31:06] place into the orley of the house to the
[31:09] most holy place even under the wings of
[31:12] the cherubims for the cherin spread
[31:14] forth their two Wings over the place of
[31:16] the Ark and the churin covered the ark
[31:18] and the stays thereof above and they
[31:21] drew out the staves that the end of The
[31:24] Stave were seen out in the holy and they
[31:27] Drew out the stays that the ends of the
[31:30] stays were seen out in the Holy place
[31:32] before the orley and they were not seen
[31:39] without throughout the stage then as
[31:41] they I'm I'm reading seeing out all
[31:43] right but without and
[31:46] there they are unto this day there was
[31:49] nothing in the ark save the two tables
[31:51] of stone which Moses put there in horb
[31:54] when the Lord made a covenant with the
[31:56] children of Israel when they came out of
[31:58] the land of Egypt and it came to pass
[32:01] when the priests were come out of the
[32:02] Holy place that the cloud filled the
[32:05] house of the Lord so that the priest
[32:07] could not stand to minister because of
[32:09] the cloud for the glory of the Lord had
[32:11] filled the house of the Lord you may be
[32:14] seated the Lord at his Blessing to the
[32:16] reading of the word now you may have two
[32:19] sets on one of these it's like 26 27 28
[32:23] 29 so don't worry about it but there is
[32:26] some quotes on the other side we need so
[32:28] you know just have the one there to to
[32:31] give out because it just be an addition
[32:33] to what we're talking
[32:36] about now we are trying to bring a point
[32:42] to get us to a position to
[32:45] understand uh this this part of
[32:48] adoption and the part that we're
[32:50] referring to is the part of that the
[32:53] scripture says in Romans 8 uh 1921 right
[32:58] through there that it's talking about
[33:00] that the whole world is waiting for the
[33:02] manifestation of the sons of God all now
[33:07] that is a special
[33:09] position of
[33:11] adoption it is a a
[33:13] placing and I've told you what I believe
[33:16] that is and we've read some things this
[33:19] morning showing the different things and
[33:21] talking about it because see the one
[33:24] thing that is in this time and this day
[33:28] is the coming of The
[33:30] Headstone there is a headstone promise
[33:32] to this uh Generation all right and I
[33:35] believe that that is your adoption I
[33:37] will cover in another message more how
[33:41] that the relationship between brother
[33:43] bram's adoption as the relationship of
[33:46] the Lord Jesus's adoption and then we
[33:49] must come in there as to not just talk
[33:51] about what they done or whatever we must
[33:54] have our own all right we'll get to that
[33:56] but uh I'm trying to just get you to
[33:59] look at the word restor or restoration
[34:03] it's restitution in the book of Acts but
[34:06] the word there is to restore and we know
[34:09] that then you go through in the Bible
[34:11] and there's a lot talks about to restore
[34:14] Joel spoke of of restore all things uh
[34:18] Matthew spoke of of a Time coming that
[34:21] Elijah would come and restore all things
[34:24] and tying together the uh the entire our
[34:27] thing to that it would come out to the
[34:30] end and we saw then the one thing that
[34:33] we're needing is The
[34:35] Headstone because that would be the uh
[34:39] placing and finishing or the adoption of
[34:43] the individual is the head uniting with
[34:46] the body and in doing that then see we
[34:49] can talk about restoration this is the
[34:51] only age this is my whole point all
[34:53] right the only
[34:55] age that is promised full restoration is
[35:00] this
[35:01] age see the reason it is because restore
[35:04] means to restore what was originally
[35:05] here now we're not talking about what
[35:08] was here we're not talking about what
[35:10] was here in Jesus we are but when that
[35:13] is restored it won't be restored in
[35:16] Jesus it'll be restored in a group of
[35:20] people upon the Earth that will bring
[35:24] about a change of the body so
[35:26] restoration we're just talking of the
[35:29] simple things a lot of people
[35:30] misunderstand us because of the wordings
[35:32] we use maybe but we're simply talking
[35:36] about the word of God being
[35:38] revealed right I mean that's that's just
[35:40] simple to me as as whatever can be you
[35:43] can say well we've got the
[35:45] Bible that's right we read it and found
[35:47] a Trinity right that wasn't in
[35:51] it there was no such thing we found
[35:54] eternal hell there was no such thing
[35:58] we found all kind of justifications for
[36:00] whatever we thought we
[36:04] needed but those things are incorrect so
[36:07] did we understand the Bible yes we've
[36:09] had the
[36:11] letter of the Bible but having the
[36:14] letter of the Bible or having the letter
[36:16] of the message is not
[36:18] restoration when I'm talking about
[36:19] restoration I'm talking about the
[36:21] revealed
[36:23] word Jesus was the word made alive right
[36:27] he was not just a dead letter but around
[36:30] said his body laid in the
[36:34] Tomb he said
[36:36] waiting for life to come back to it that
[36:39] was the word lay there right right but
[36:42] it took the spirit to make it life see
[36:46] all right when I talk about word and I'm
[36:48] not talking about just letters on the
[36:49] page whether it be the prophet's message
[36:51] or letters coming off of it into uh MP3
[36:55] CDs Etc DVDs or whatever you talking
[36:57] about I'm talking about when it's
[36:59] revealed
[37:01] amen now there was a time we thought
[37:04] we're supposed to baptize Father Son and
[37:05] Holy Ghost CU we read it well I can read
[37:08] it right out of the book but then when
[37:11] we got the Revelation right we didn't
[37:14] have to race out that and change the
[37:16] letters you know to make it fit
[37:20] something we seen it was saying exactly
[37:23] what it was supposed to say we had the
[37:26] wrong
[37:28] Revelation right cuz we swore we had a
[37:31] revelation didn't we it's been revealed
[37:34] to me that there's three Gods people
[37:36] will say you know and I get up to heaven
[37:38] if I don't see three I'll just walk out
[37:40] because it's the wrong
[37:42] place well I don't think you got to
[37:45] worry about it but that's all right you
[37:47] know we're not throwing stones at nobody
[37:50] we're just talking about you and me I'm
[37:52] not preaching out there I'm preaching
[37:53] here so don't ever getet that brother
[37:55] Dale is throwing off on these
[37:57] denomination over here that's over there
[37:58] I don't have no problems with them my
[38:01] problem is preaching to me and you I
[38:03] don't have no problem what's on the
[38:04] internet but I am not an internet Pastor
[38:06] if people listening you take it do what
[38:08] you want to with it but I'm not your
[38:11] pastor see all right because see there
[38:14] is people who say well well you're the
[38:16] only one I listen to well if there a
[38:18] church around for you to go to you know
[38:19] what I said to
[38:21] you you go to that church
[38:24] amen cuz the same thing applies to you
[38:27] as appes to anybody else forsake not to
[38:29] sending of yourself together well now
[38:30] brother Dale we assemble in front of the
[38:32] internet and we listen to you I've made
[38:34] it plain now that doesn't work with me
[38:37] if there a place to go to right you mean
[38:40] you don't want us to listen to you I
[38:41] didn't say
[38:45] that you go to where that that you can
[38:48] at least go to church cuz you need the
[38:49] Assembly of together of people of like
[38:52] Precious faith and do the best you can
[38:55] all right the prophet of God said what
[38:58] he said if you can't get a whole Loa get
[38:59] a high we go on vacations or anything
[39:03] all the vacations we've ever took we
[39:05] didn't miss services on Sunday we rode
[39:08] all over Colorado in a uh a city down
[39:11] there bigger than Commerce I guess and
[39:14] trying our best to find a
[39:16] church and we couldn't even find a
[39:19] Baptist I said find a Catholic Church I
[39:21] ain't never been to
[39:23] mash H we couldn't find one we went in
[39:27] McDonald's talking about the lord well
[39:30] that was different brother R said you
[39:32] out hunting on Sunday go ahead and Hunt
[39:35] if you're way to where you can't be at
[39:39] church but we had to drive 15 miles to
[39:42] get we had to drive 15 miles to get out
[39:45] of the woods and another 15 to get over
[39:48] to the city we went to to try to to find
[39:51] a church but see I just always been that
[39:54] way you know and I've always told
[39:56] everybody go ahead the only time I've
[39:58] ever missed her there was one time out
[39:59] there and I told him I said you go ahead
[40:01] and Hunt I'll just stay in your cabin
[40:03] and listen to tapes and have a good time
[40:05] and I had supper underway when they got
[40:07] back that evening because that was just
[40:10] that's me all right so you say you
[40:13] legalist I brother around said when it
[40:15] comes to Works in my car on Sunday I
[40:16] won't do
[40:18] it he said you can call it legalism
[40:21] whatever you going to do you know now
[40:23] Sox is in the
[40:24] ditch go get the car out of the ditch
[40:27] you know all right but let me get off of
[40:30] that see but now
[40:33] listen we come up to a place to talk
[40:37] about that what is The
[40:41] Headstone I mean what do you
[40:43] expecting when the prophet would be
[40:45] speaking of headstone head seal cou
[40:48] Stone uh capping Stones um all what what
[40:52] are you
[40:53] expecting Surly you're expecting
[40:56] something and and what are you expecting
[40:59] you know to transpire at that time so we
[41:02] were trying to go through
[41:04] scripturally to show that in the the the
[41:08] First Kings when Solomon got the temple
[41:11] ready and got every you know the
[41:12] tabernac
[41:14] already that the life thing was the Ark
[41:17] of the Covenant all right and we read
[41:20] from from uh the message that brother
[41:22] Ram gave us on dedication we ended up
[41:25] reading on that one dedic 1962 1111 the
[41:29] morning service R up telling you and he
[41:31] talks about how that there's two tables
[41:34] of stone another words The Ten
[41:36] Commandments right come into the temple
[41:39] he said The Headstone the capping
[41:45] Stone all right so the headstone is the
[41:47] word
[41:50] right the Cornerstone is the revealed
[41:52] word right you agree which is Jesus
[41:55] Christ so if the corner stone is the
[41:57] revealed word which is Jesus Christ then
[42:00] The Headstone is the revealed word about
[42:02] Jesus Christ that was not made
[42:05] known any other time and that's why I
[42:09] was covering it this morning like we was
[42:11] even the disciples the great Apostle
[42:13] Paul he never wrote about the seals or
[42:18] anything cuz that was withholding from
[42:21] him but Jesus preached
[42:23] it but see none of them ever brought it
[42:26] out why cuz it was waiting for the end
[42:29] time none of them talked about the son
[42:32] of man as I said don't get into Matthew
[42:35] Mark Luke and John that was under the
[42:37] law the writing of sure after they
[42:40] received the Holy Ghost but it was
[42:42] writing of the Life of Christ amen all
[42:46] right and and they could speak of those
[42:48] things because that's what Jesus spoke
[42:50] of right well then Here Comes brother
[42:52] Ram in the last days isn't it such a
[42:54] marvelous parallel to look at what Jesus
[42:56] would do and then look at what brother
[42:58] around would do here he would start
[43:00] talking about the son of man when the
[43:03] son of man is being
[43:04] revealed well see that was a great
[43:08] mystery to understand and to to bring
[43:11] forth cuz it it took that to do it all
[43:14] right now as I was saying this morning
[43:18] then we're The Headstone was rejected we
[43:22] gave those quotes to the morning's
[43:24] message anybody that misses it go back
[43:26] to it and and pick them up all right
[43:28] look on the computer right now and
[43:29] brother Joe's got him on there see but
[43:32] brother R said the last one we read I
[43:34] think was uh E64 Abraham's Covenant
[43:37] confirmed number nine on your notes
[43:40] 61-10 he's talking about the rejected
[43:42] Stone will come
[43:44] back the rejected Stone will come back
[43:49] all right now so I'm looking for the
[43:51] coming of The Headstone but what am I
[43:54] looking for oh but brother Dale one day
[43:56] the head Stone will come and there'll be
[43:58] such an anointing yeah but you got to
[44:01] get in the right stage that's
[44:03] right because the two tables of stone
[44:06] came into the Tabernacle in the days of
[44:09] Solomon and then the shik kind of Glory
[44:11] fell now I've got another scripture to
[44:14] read for you in at a while but it'll be
[44:16] the light of the message all right but
[44:19] it may be interesting okay but now
[44:23] listen we're not looking for the
[44:25] physical returning of the Lord Jesus
[44:27] Christ in a Corporal body we're looking
[44:30] for the physical return in to meet him
[44:32] in the a all right we meet the Lord
[44:35] Jesus in the a the body in the a he
[44:37] doesn't step foot on Earth until the
[44:38] millennial rain all right see in in a
[44:42] Corporal body so we're not looking for
[44:44] that kind of a coming or that kind of a
[44:47] stone and we're looking at it as I said
[44:49] like the two tables of stone going into
[44:51] the temple and then the shik glory
[44:53] fallowing The Headstone will Unite with
[44:56] the entire Body of Christ all right all
[45:00] that are going to to be there at that
[45:03] point will be United together and I said
[45:05] I believe individuals can already be
[45:08] kept off but as a group I do not believe
[45:11] it is completed yet I just honestly say
[45:14] that I you know you say Well when will
[45:15] it be I don't know it will be but when
[45:18] it is it's only going to be a short time
[45:21] right of the manifestation of the Sons
[45:23] and Daughters of God under that
[45:24] headstone because it was only a short
[45:26] time of Jes Jesus Under The Headstone he
[45:28] met The Headstone there were Mount of
[45:31] transfiguration he went straight to
[45:33] Calvary that was his adoption that was
[45:35] his hear ye him all right see then that
[45:38] bringing it down see those two tables of
[45:42] stone came in and then the sh Glory come
[45:46] all right so we ended up by talking
[45:50] about
[45:51] that that was The Headstone coming which
[45:54] would be the revealed word right all
[45:58] right now and that's what I'm looking
[46:00] for the revealed word you say well we
[46:03] got it yeah we got it lay
[46:07] here right we've had this
[46:10] Bible we had this Bible before brother
[46:12] Brown ever
[46:14] come right but that didn't mean we
[46:17] understood
[46:18] it we've heard the prophet's message
[46:20] over and over I remember one day I was
[46:22] talking in a certain place and and I
[46:24] said brother R said so so and this
[46:25] brother said I just heard where's that
[46:26] at I said so and so he said I just heard
[46:28] that message it's not on there I said
[46:32] well now wait just a minute so I just
[46:34] happened to have the book with me so I
[46:36] just got the book and I said you know
[46:37] read
[46:38] that he
[46:40] said well you're right it's there you
[46:44] know but see the him and everybody
[46:47] standing around what if i' been left and
[46:48] didn't have the book everybody around
[46:51] there and him too would have went off
[46:52] saying brother Dale's all messed up well
[46:56] it doesn't matter I'm been messed up all
[46:58] the life but it's according to where the
[46:59] word is right or
[47:01] not so I'm looking for the word to be
[47:04] revealed that's what I'm looking for but
[47:07] then when the word is finally revealed
[47:09] and the adoption takes place then the sh
[47:13] kind of Glory can fall that's right the
[47:17] the prophet is US quoting this morning
[47:18] said there'd be such a baptism of the
[47:20] Holy Ghost that would fill every fiber
[47:22] of your being and and we' go into
[47:24] Rapture I'm looking for that am but
[47:27] let's look for whatever is Promised next
[47:29] that's right
[47:31] amen and see what that is all right so
[47:34] we found out that the Ten Commandments
[47:37] is the word of
[47:39] God that was God in letter
[47:42] form I can take the Ten Commandments and
[47:44] go through it'd be hard for me to do
[47:46] right now but what about the first one
[47:48] let's see what is it First Command U
[47:50] behold the Lord thy God is one or
[47:52] something like that right the first
[47:54] commandment that's exactly the message
[47:56] of
[47:57] hour the Lord our God is one that's
[48:00] right that's not a book of rules that's
[48:02] right man made it a book of rules it's a
[48:05] revelation of God I remember about years
[48:08] ago I could even preach out of it and I
[48:10] could take marriage and divorce right
[48:12] out of say like seal number I mean the
[48:15] you know the the uh I can take it out of
[48:18] the seals and take it out of the Ten
[48:20] Commandments letay it
[48:22] parallel you know because I'm not
[48:24] anointed to do that right now I was
[48:27] that's a day gone by and thank God for
[48:29] Richard and brother Ray Gabriel and them
[48:32] that's doing all of that and putting all
[48:33] those sermons in there and eventually we
[48:35] will have ever sermon from 82 up that's
[48:39] been preached in this church you know or
[48:41] at least our services to be able to
[48:43] where you can get the the uh MP3s or
[48:46] whatever and listen to them all right I
[48:48] didn't ask them to do that they' done
[48:50] that on their volunteer their own basis
[48:52] cuz I'd mentioned a lot of times that I
[48:54] preached the series on this well then
[48:56] they'd go back and try to pull that
[48:58] series Brother Dean there when I
[49:00] mentioned years ago that I preached on
[49:02] Daniel 70 weeks he said where's it at
[49:05] well I never preached on it again it
[49:06] just that was that you know and uh he
[49:09] said where's it at he sat down and that
[49:11] day it was a little harder than it is
[49:13] now because he had to take it off 7even
[49:14] me real and put it on the cassettes but
[49:18] he made this available to people the
[49:20] Daniel 70 weeks that I had preached back
[49:23] there well thank God for these people
[49:25] that'll do things like that you know and
[49:27] leave me to word that I can you know run
[49:30] my mouth and preach the
[49:32] gospel but listen see I want to Anchor
[49:36] this into you if we don't get nothing
[49:39] else the word revealed is what I'm
[49:42] talking about now there's a promise then
[49:46] to restore all things
[49:50] right all
[49:52] right see so if there ever was any word
[49:56] revealed or Made Alive anywhere prior to
[49:59] where we're at we are supposed to have
[50:03] within our possession at least the
[50:06] ability to be able to have that and we
[50:09] do by The Prophet's message thank God
[50:11] for these people that have put the
[50:14] prophet's message into word form take
[50:17] form Etc and done those things because
[50:20] you you know we're the only ones that
[50:21] would would say in the days of the voice
[50:23] of the seventh angel well see you don't
[50:25] have all the writings of luk you don't
[50:27] have all the writings of westle and
[50:28] things like that but I mean we have 12
[50:32] 13400 different messages of a prophet in
[50:37] our day thank God for
[50:39] technology you know to where we can have
[50:41] it yes see and and all like that just
[50:44] just thank God for it it's a it's a help
[50:47] thank God for the computers where we can
[50:48] run it up without having to take the old
[50:50] days of searching for months over one
[50:53] quote let
[50:55] see we we we are supposed to be word
[50:59] people and then our headstone would have
[51:01] to be the revealed word but it'd be what
[51:04] was not made
[51:07] known you said well wait a minute now
[51:10] you said restore means to restore yes
[51:12] the Lord Jesus Christ preached right he
[51:17] preached six seals in Matthew
[51:19] 24 so that can be restored don't worry
[51:23] about it we get on over see he went
[51:25] through the change of the body
[51:27] right that can be restored right see all
[51:33] of these things are are there we're just
[51:35] moving along but look what we brought
[51:37] out from Christ The Mystery of God
[51:39] revealed just to make sure you follow
[51:40] what I'm talking about of the
[51:44] word the Bible the
[51:47] message look what the prophet had to say
[51:49] Christ mystery God revealed this is p
[51:51] page 7576 Christ of
[51:54] mystery and as the head was took up from
[51:56] the grave so must the body follow him
[51:59] into Eden therefore the body cannot
[52:01] recognize any other headship what but
[52:04] the headship of the
[52:08] word if we're word how can we recognize
[52:10] anything else no denomination can put
[52:13] anything to it for whosoever shall take
[52:16] one word away from it or add one word to
[52:19] it they took away from it they took away
[52:23] from it you're dead hybrid right there
[52:26] she's back here with the testimony in
[52:29] her hands the filter of her fornication
[52:31] committing spiritual fornication against
[52:33] the very word that she claims to believe
[52:36] see therefore it's the word or nothing
[52:39] that's
[52:40] right he the word how do you know it's
[52:45] right he the word is Vindicated see he
[52:49] the word properly Vindicated now watch
[52:52] it is the headship the head of the
[52:55] church he is the word the headship he's
[52:59] properly ident
[53:01] identified Vindicated by his own spirit
[53:04] being in the church itself the person
[53:07] showing forth himself in Vindication is
[53:10] the direct proof to the entire body you
[53:13] don't need Creeds then denominations as
[53:16] perish but the headship itself recognize
[53:19] in the body by personal identification
[53:22] see identifying himself proves the
[53:24] headship to the body then we are united
[53:27] under one Vindicated headship that is
[53:30] Christ the word of God not under any
[53:33] church then our headship is a kingdom
[53:36] amen all right the kingdom of God is
[53:39] within you said the Bible Jesus the
[53:42] kingdom we are not a denomination we
[53:44] belong to a kingdom and the kingdom is
[53:46] the word of God made spirit and life in
[53:50] our own life bringing to pass watch Ever
[53:54] promise in this day as it did in that
[53:57] day when the word in God was one now how
[54:00] much pler could you get and the word in
[54:02] God is one in his church today watch
[54:06] making it the headship of the body watch
[54:09] that is redeemed to bring the message in
[54:12] the Life day and be taken up from the
[54:16] dead in the resurrection to go back to
[54:17] restore again Eden just again Adam and
[54:20] Eve in the beginning of the Garden of
[54:22] Eden the three-fold mystery of God his
[54:24] body oh my next one is kinds of
[54:26] Believers 63
[54:30] 11:24 he's talking about the
[54:33] assassination of the president and see
[54:35] the other things and cold blooded murder
[54:37] and house coming down and he's saying it
[54:39] like this you said and the son of man
[54:41] Ascend it up so shall his body Ascend up
[54:45] and he is the head his church is the
[54:47] body oh God it's the head that guides
[54:51] the body and let the headship of the
[54:54] word guide the body of Christ that I
[54:58] that may I be part of that body Lord now
[55:03] what is our headship the revealed word
[55:06] what is the headship You're Expecting
[55:07] brother Dale the revealed
[55:09] word I believe this message is the
[55:12] revealed word am all right but I believe
[55:15] it's got to be revealed to me and you it
[55:18] was revealed to the prophet that's right
[55:21] but then people are saved brother around
[55:22] and said it and I got
[55:24] it well right you could have said that
[55:27] just as
[55:28] easy that the Bible says it and I got it
[55:33] right you can make the same claims to
[55:36] the
[55:37] Bible see but that don't work does it no
[55:40] see but see what are you expecting
[55:42] brother
[55:43] Dale I'm expecting the word of God to be
[55:48] preached by the fivefold ministry right
[55:50] that the prophet has brought unto us and
[55:53] by that that will bring us to that place
[55:57] like I was quoting this morning that
[55:58] this messenger of Malachi 4 would do two
[56:00] things one turn the hearts of the
[56:01] children back to the faith of the
[56:03] fathers two reveal the seven Thunders
[56:05] which is a revelation contained in the
[56:06] seven seal it'll be these divinely
[56:08] reveal mystery to that literally turn
[56:10] our hearts back all right so brother
[56:12] brand brought the message and off The
[56:15] Scene 40 something years later now we
[56:18] are following that Channel Through the
[56:21] word to come out to the end time to see
[56:24] where that we're at
[56:26] and to know what's going on all right
[56:28] see then the word see as I said this
[56:32] morning brother Brandon please explain
[56:34] to us what took place in the temple that
[56:37] we can see what to expect
[56:41] here and then we went to dedication to
[56:43] where brother R said it was those two
[56:44] tables of
[56:46] stone coming into the
[56:49] temple the Ark of the Covenant found its
[56:52] resting place everything was in order
[56:57] but now keep that in mind everything had
[56:59] to be in
[57:00] order told you I got another scripture
[57:02] but I wait till the to read it
[57:04] everything had to be perfectly in
[57:07] order there couldn't be one guy over
[57:09] here playing a trumpet and playing you
[57:12] know Nearer My God to thee you know and
[57:16] all the rest of them playing Amazing
[57:18] Grace what he in the
[57:21] spirit he was playing in the spirit I
[57:24] don't care he wasn't in the he wasn't in
[57:25] the right of the
[57:28] conductor he wasn't listening to the
[57:31] conductor right all right so then what
[57:34] is
[57:35] it what are we looking for God to
[57:39] reveal and to do that we must make
[57:42] oursel available
[57:44] right and people who refuse to listen to
[57:47] the seals and things to anybody that can
[57:49] preach about it they won't listen to
[57:51] that well that's up to them that's none
[57:53] of my business all right now let's get
[57:56] down to one thing
[57:58] then cuz we got up to this point to
[58:01] where we were reading about you know
[58:04] after the door of the Gentile church is
[58:05] closed he'll anoint a church then
[58:07] because that would be then the anointing
[58:10] that would strike home to the church see
[58:14] and when it does see it would be in the
[58:17] end
[58:18] time and be in the revealed word now I'm
[58:22] trying to pick up where I left off to
[58:23] continue it see then the head Shield of
[58:26] the Bride of Jesus Christ is the
[58:28] revealed
[58:31] word and the one that reveals that word
[58:35] must be
[58:38] here it's not an outward teacher we
[58:40] don't have that right we have teachers
[58:42] in the body of Christ yeah we believe in
[58:44] that but we have the Holy Ghost as the
[58:46] teacher on the
[58:48] inside cuz that's the only way we can
[58:51] hear all right and it wasn't to Elijah
[58:55] of the Great Sound of the blast the
[58:56] great doing the this the Lightnings and
[58:58] the Thunder it was a still Small Voice
[59:01] that brought him out of the cave all
[59:03] right so now let's get into it and see
[59:06] what we can do let's see if we can let
[59:09] the prophet of God show us how this
[59:10] headstone will
[59:14] come and it being the revealed word all
[59:18] right let's just read now you you got
[59:20] your your notes from this morning uh
[59:23] some of you that wasn't here if you is
[59:25] there some extra C
[59:27] are you done pass them out I know
[59:28] brother couple of them back there all
[59:33] right but brother random said is this
[59:35] the sign of the end sir page 4862 12:30
[59:39] the evening
[59:41] service and he's talking about the great
[59:43] constellation of angels that he had seen
[59:45] a vision of he was talking about he
[59:48] would have you know that there'd be a
[59:50] great uh something great coming forth to
[59:53] the church and then he said could it be
[59:56] that the mighty Thunder are the seventh
[59:59] angel in the seven constellation now
[1:00:01] this is before he met with the angels
[1:00:03] and this is before he was going west
[1:00:05] seven period constellation the pyramid
[1:00:08] made in a form three on the side and one
[1:00:10] on the top and the dro from eternity
[1:00:13] could it be is this the mystery of the
[1:00:17] seven Thunders that will bring back The
[1:00:22] Headstone all right that's number 13 on
[1:00:24] you
[1:00:26] could it
[1:00:28] be is this the mystery of the seven
[1:00:32] Thunders that we bring back The
[1:00:34] Headstone well brother Dale the seven
[1:00:37] Thunders nobody knows what the Thunders
[1:00:40] are all right I'm glad you said that so
[1:00:43] let's read what the prophet said they
[1:00:45] are that's why I love to do it that way
[1:00:47] all right number 14 on your notes page
[1:00:50] 139 of the first seal 63-18
[1:00:56] and he's talking about how it can't be
[1:00:57] revealed until the end time now when the
[1:01:00] Thunder remember a loud clapping noise
[1:01:02] of a thunder is the voice of
[1:01:06] God Amen now he's telling you that's
[1:01:10] what the Bible said see a clap of
[1:01:12] Thunder they thought it was Thunder but
[1:01:15] it was God he understood it for it was
[1:01:17] revealed to him it was a thunder so what
[1:01:21] is a thunder it's a voice of
[1:01:23] God okay
[1:01:26] when did the thunder sound to the
[1:01:27] prophet when the seals were
[1:01:29] broke there was one Blast Of Thunder in
[1:01:32] the Bible and Seven Seals
[1:01:35] broke all right there was one Blast Of
[1:01:37] Thunder to the prophet in Tucson Arizona
[1:01:40] and Seven Seals broke but now I've been
[1:01:42] through it I can go back through it
[1:01:44] whatever you want to do brother brandom
[1:01:46] says that those angels never told him
[1:01:49] anything out there they told him to go
[1:01:52] back to Jeffersonville and it would be
[1:01:55] revealed
[1:01:57] all right
[1:01:58] now he said it would be revealed where
[1:02:01] there he said well that was just what it
[1:02:04] well that's what he said now so that's
[1:02:06] up to you and what he said he comes to
[1:02:08] the First on that c the god in
[1:02:12] Simplicity and even the breach he said I
[1:02:15] don't know what the first deal is well
[1:02:17] now he's a liar if he
[1:02:19] did I don't mind talking that
[1:02:24] way if he knew what it was and said he
[1:02:27] didn't know what it was it makes him a
[1:02:30] liar he said the Angels Came daily in
[1:02:32] the
[1:02:34] room see the Thunder the voice of
[1:02:38] God all right now then what are we doing
[1:02:41] then what are we looking
[1:02:44] for we're looking for the point of what
[1:02:46] I've always tried to get you to
[1:02:49] see there has to
[1:02:52] be the
[1:02:54] ministry of the Lord Lord
[1:02:56] Jesus in the faith of the fathers we
[1:02:59] covered that this
[1:03:00] morning we read where the Prophet said
[1:03:03] the same Ministry the apostles
[1:03:06] had that's called the faith of the
[1:03:08] fathers and that's what the Lord Jesus
[1:03:10] placed within the disciples are made
[1:03:12] known to him but he did not make known
[1:03:15] The Headstone cuz it was
[1:03:18] rejected all right but see that Ministry
[1:03:22] of the faith of the fathers has got to
[1:03:23] be here before
[1:03:26] then you can even speak of the Mysteries
[1:03:29] of the last
[1:03:33] days all right or the mystery of the
[1:03:36] headstone that's why people are don't
[1:03:39] understand it they're taking a and
[1:03:41] forgive me for using the word what else
[1:03:43] if we're a born again Christian we're a
[1:03:45] baby I'm not de christianizing nobody
[1:03:47] I'm just telling it like it is if we're
[1:03:49] a baby trying to figure out adult words
[1:03:51] we got a problem right right you know we
[1:03:56] got a
[1:03:57] problem because we're we're we're taking
[1:04:00] our little F out or how you say those
[1:04:02] words you know little bitty
[1:04:03] understanding to try to figure out the
[1:04:05] great Eternal
[1:04:07] God wait for God to reveal
[1:04:10] it that's the biggest thing brother R
[1:04:12] said that's what happened to Eve in the
[1:04:13] garden right he said she couldn't wait
[1:04:17] see that's her problem all right now so
[1:04:20] what are we to do
[1:04:21] now see we got to have the same Ministry
[1:04:25] that the Lord Jesus Christ gave the
[1:04:30] apostles that's mandatory it's not a
[1:04:33] question it's
[1:04:35] mandatory then we can start talking
[1:04:37] about the
[1:04:40] things of the end
[1:04:43] time see of the prophet's
[1:04:48] message
[1:04:50] right cuz see you'd be jumping you in
[1:04:52] other words if you you say well I
[1:04:54] brother I believe I'm born again but I
[1:04:56] just jumped up
[1:04:57] here know well how did you get up there
[1:05:01] brother Mo had a good point he said
[1:05:03] that's like taking and jumping up in the
[1:05:04] air and taking your your bootstraps you
[1:05:07] know the strings on your boots and you
[1:05:09] just pull yourself up now how many want
[1:05:11] to try
[1:05:12] that I can do one at a time but I can
[1:05:14] only get that so
[1:05:17] far but see that's what we're doing we
[1:05:19] try to jump up to something and we got
[1:05:23] it I said don't make it too easy
[1:05:27] that you can stumble into
[1:05:29] it but don't make it so hard till it
[1:05:31] cannot be comprehended or understood or
[1:05:34] or retained you know attained
[1:05:37] unto so now let's just read a few things
[1:05:39] brother brand had to say about this same
[1:05:43] Ministry now we're talking about now the
[1:05:45] ministry of Jesus
[1:05:48] Christ that he didn't tell the
[1:05:52] disciples we read the quotes about the
[1:05:54] ones where he the things that they
[1:05:56] understood now we're talking about
[1:05:58] what's going to
[1:06:00] bring the coming of The Headstone the
[1:06:02] finishing of all things and then the sh
[1:06:04] kind of Glory can fall so look at number
[1:06:06] 15 on your notes sign of the Messiah
[1:06:09] 1959 3
[1:06:13] 329e and he's talking about because it's
[1:06:16] a commission commission charged me by an
[1:06:18] Angel and confirmed by his word let it
[1:06:20] be known tonight that you're Jesus
[1:06:22] Christ so he's praying listen Son of God
[1:06:26] that raised from the dead and you live
[1:06:28] in your church in your people now watch
[1:06:32] it not just run around in your people to

[1:06:41] of
[1:06:43] Flesh Grant it Lord will praise you in
[1:06:46] Jesus's Christ name amen the same
[1:06:50] Ministry Jesus had when he was here in
[1:06:52] the body of
[1:06:54] Flesh that's what I'm expecting what
[1:06:56] about you all right look at the next
[1:07:01] one same ministry that's what I'm trying
[1:07:04] to get you to see but I'm W you to see
[1:07:07] that he said in your people are among
[1:07:11] the people and then we're going to read
[1:07:13] a scripture to show the the tying
[1:07:15] together well let's do it right now
[1:07:17] let's do it because it's it's hanging
[1:07:19] there and if I don't you're going to
[1:07:21] miss it all right you just we just read
[1:07:24] of the the in sec in First
[1:07:27] Kings
[1:07:30] 8 let's read 2
[1:07:34] Chronicles all right now remember the
[1:07:37] Kings and the
[1:07:40] Chronicles in other words the same thing
[1:07:43] is
[1:07:44] repeated right what's over here is
[1:07:48] repeated what was in the Kings is
[1:07:50] repeated in the
[1:07:52] Chronicles all right now now this is not
[1:07:55] two
[1:07:56] temples see watch what it's done now got
[1:08:00] to make sure you understand it's not two
[1:08:02] temples then we're going to go to 2
[1:08:05] chonicles
[1:08:08] 51
[1:08:11] okay now I want you to read and see what
[1:08:13] you got to do with
[1:08:15] it I just want to read verse one then
[1:08:17] we'll drop down cuz I want you to see
[1:08:19] it's
[1:08:20] Solomon and not two temples not Solomon
[1:08:24] building one and in a rest restoration
[1:08:25] of the temple the same thing happens in
[1:08:28] the restoration of the
[1:08:30] temple come on we can go all the way
[1:08:32] over there to the restoration of the
[1:08:34] temple under what Ezra and Nehemiah and
[1:08:36] when it does finish this kind of Glory
[1:08:38] comes into the temple again but this is
[1:08:41] a repeat of what happened in the Kings
[1:08:45] all right thus all the work that Solomon
[1:08:48] made for the house of the Lord was
[1:08:50] finished and you go reading all the way
[1:08:52] down through and it's the same thing
[1:08:54] that you're being the spreading of it
[1:08:56] and verse 10 says and there was nothing
[1:08:58] in the ark say the same as king now the
[1:09:01] two tables which Moses put here therein
[1:09:05] at Horeb when the Lord made a covenant
[1:09:07] with the children of Israel when they
[1:09:08] came out of Egypt and he came to pass
[1:09:10] when the priest were come out of the
[1:09:12] Holy place for all the priests that were
[1:09:15] present were
[1:09:17] Sanctified and did not then wait by
[1:09:20] course in other words they were set but
[1:09:23] they they were everybody was just doing
[1:09:25] it
[1:09:26] brother R said there was thousands of
[1:09:29] sacrifices being
[1:09:31] made it wasn't just one it was just
[1:09:34] being made everywhere there all right
[1:09:37] now watch verse 12 and also the Levites
[1:09:40] which were the
[1:09:41] singers which were the singers all of
[1:09:44] them of a sap every how you pronounce it
[1:09:48] of
[1:09:49] Hermon uh jotum you pronounce the words
[1:09:52] correct I don't know how with their sons
[1:09:55] and their Brethren being arrayed in
[1:09:57] white linen having symbols and poers and
[1:10:00] hearts to it the East End Of The Altar
[1:10:04] and with them at 120 priests sounding
[1:10:07] with
[1:10:07] trumpets now listen to all this is
[1:10:10] taking
[1:10:12] place okay and it came to pass as the
[1:10:16] trumpeters and the singers were as
[1:10:21] one are you listening yes perfect
[1:10:24] harmony
[1:10:27] to make one sound to be heard in
[1:10:29] praising and thanking the lord and when
[1:10:32] they lifted up their voice with the
[1:10:33] trumpets and symbols and instruments of
[1:10:36] music and praise the Lord saying for he
[1:10:39] is good for his mercy endureth forever
[1:10:42] that
[1:10:46] then the house of the Lord was filled
[1:10:48] with a cloud even the house the the
[1:10:50] house was filled with a cloud even the
[1:10:52] house of the Lord that the priest could
[1:10:53] not stand see the reason want to read
[1:10:55] that is that's not it's not mentioned in
[1:10:58] Kings that they were all in one

[1:15:57] fulfilled we were to stay here
[1:16:01] until and when they got in one mind in
[1:16:04] one
[1:16:07] Accord and I don't like the joke where

[1:16:46] Headstone was already there in place
[1:16:50] right come
[1:16:52] on the word was in place
[1:16:55] and when the word got in place they
[1:16:57] started
[1:17:00] rejoicing David remember his wife made
[1:17:04] fun of him because he was shouting
[1:17:05] because they were bringing back the word
[1:17:08] he said if you think paraphrasing it
[1:17:10] said if you think have something you
[1:17:11] wait till tomorrow that's
[1:17:13] right you know you think that was
[1:17:15] something me shouting you wait
[1:17:19] tomorrow see what are we doing
[1:17:23] folks that's why there of Glory hadn't
[1:17:25] come that's why it hasn't been there why
[1:17:27] because babies are trying to understand
[1:17:30] spiritual
[1:17:32] matters and it won't be there got to be
[1:17:34] a Ministry of Jesus
[1:17:35] Christ all right we found there from
[1:17:38] page or paragraph that's paragraph 50
[1:17:41] sign of the Messiah we read that one
[1:17:43] where in your people to perform all
[1:17:45] right listen standing in the Gap 1963 6
[1:17:48] 6:23 the morning
[1:17:51] service and he's talking about the
[1:17:52] pyramid and the the rock the things is
[1:17:54] coming is in the shape of a pyramid but
[1:17:57] the cap on the pyramid was never put on
[1:17:59] now I've been in Cairo and in Egypt and
[1:18:01] the cap never did come because it was a
[1:18:03] Cornerstone it was a headstone in the
[1:18:06] church it was the Cornerstone in the
[1:18:08] full church it was The Headstone right
[1:18:11] so it never did come it was rejected
[1:18:16] Christ and it will come and I believe
[1:18:19] that when it's coming that the church
[1:18:21] will shake into a place from
[1:18:23] justification under Luther ification
[1:18:25] under Wesley and the Pentecostal message
[1:18:27] will bring the church to such a minority
[1:18:30] and the ministry will be among those
[1:18:32] people till it'll be exactly the same
[1:18:35] Ministry that Jesus did and that'll
[1:18:37] bring Jesus and catch the whole thing
[1:18:40] away
[1:18:41] okay so let's just keep
[1:18:45] reading Abraham's Covenant confirmed e23
[1:18:48] 1961 318 he's talking about the
[1:18:51] Pentecostals and wesling Etc coming down
[1:18:56] and now it goes on till that has to get
[1:18:59] to such a perfect place until when that
[1:19:03] headstone finally comes it'll fit so
[1:19:06] perfectly the church will be have to be
[1:19:09] in such a such a perfect State until
[1:19:12] when Christ comes he fits right into it
[1:19:14] that's right now keep on reading if you
[1:19:17] want to in between but drop down to the
[1:19:18] last to the next paragraph he said it's
[1:19:20] home to a perfect condition till it fits
[1:19:23] perfectly without cement that's the word
[1:19:25] the church is going to have to be so hon
[1:19:28] down the word hor horning honing the
[1:19:32] church until when Christ comes to take
[1:19:35] the church the ministry the church will
[1:19:37] will pick right up on it and will raise
[1:19:40] Luther westle and Pentecost and all and
[1:19:42] go with it that's right to take the
[1:19:43] church
[1:19:45] up hear you himy 1959 424 the evening
[1:19:50] service you talking about when a child
[1:19:52] is adopted
[1:19:54] then there comes a day when that son
[1:19:56] becomes he's going to be adopted or
[1:19:58] placed you Brethren what I'm trying to
[1:20:00] say placing of a son you understand what
[1:20:03] I mean he's to be placed positionally he
[1:20:06] becomes there and they take him out in
[1:20:08] the streets and put put him on a certain
[1:20:10] garment and they have a ceremony and
[1:20:12] after that Ceremony this childish Place
[1:20:14] were adopted into the same family he was
[1:20:16] born in and his name is just as good on
[1:20:18] checkbook as his daddy's right he falls
[1:20:20] out positionally placed just to showing
[1:20:22] you headstone adoption checkbook all
[1:20:26] comes to one thing all
[1:20:28] right Watchman what of the night 6722
[1:20:34] E40 he talking about the same thing in
[1:20:36] coming of the son of man the same
[1:20:38] Ministry that the son went down in the
[1:20:41] same light he went down in is coming
[1:20:44] again in the resurrection power and The
[1:20:47] Morning Star is reflecting that light
[1:20:51] then we cry Watchman what of the night
[1:20:58] Abraham's Covenant confirmed 1961 to10
[1:21:02] E40 if you can catch it and know what
[1:21:05] I'm talking about number 20 on your
[1:21:07] notes the very Ministry that Jesus
[1:21:09] Christ was doing here on Earth when it
[1:21:12] comes back the very same Ministry at
[1:21:16] Pentecost listen will have to will not
[1:21:20] have to widen itself out in organization
[1:21:23] that will not have to
[1:21:25] but shape itself up in Christ until the
[1:21:28] headstone and the church will fit one to
[1:21:30] the other and them may see so cemented
[1:21:33] till you can't even run take a razor
[1:21:35] blade and go around and find a crack
[1:21:37] where they were put together and that's
[1:21:39] how the church has got to come so much
[1:21:41] like Christ and look what we've got to
[1:21:43] do then cut away and circumcise and chop
[1:21:47] off and form and molded into the image
[1:21:50] of Jesus Christ until that church in the
[1:21:52] cap comes right smack to together he
[1:21:55] goes down and talks about the negative
[1:21:57] and the positive becomes one people
[1:21:59] don't like that negative and positive
[1:22:01] ain't nothing negative in God well
[1:22:02] brother random used it and that's the
[1:22:04] way it is coming the church has got to
[1:22:06] shape itself in itself till it hasn't
[1:22:09] got a spot or wrinkle amen there's the
[1:22:11] second
[1:22:14] right it becometh us to fulfill all
[1:22:16] righteousness which is 1961 101 the
[1:22:19] morning service paragraph 192 he talking
[1:22:21] about the churches week the churches of
[1:22:23] the day we're broke up in an
[1:22:24] organizational St strip separation of
[1:22:27] Brotherhood Methodist Baptist
[1:22:28] Presbyterian Oneness freeness finess all
[1:22:31] kind of stuff we're broke up that's the
[1:22:33] way it's supposed supposed to be it's
[1:22:36] got to be that way now that's what he
[1:22:38] says so then we got Lula I and got this
[1:22:41] I and that I and whose I and whatever
[1:22:44] right all
[1:22:45] right but once then there will come a
[1:22:47] message oh Hallelujah and we know that
[1:22:51] that same Pillar of Fire that led Israel
[1:22:53] we know that the same Ministry that
[1:22:56] accompanied Jesus Christ by that Pillar
[1:22:59] of Fire that had him anointed is
[1:23:02] accompanying the church
[1:23:05] today science has proved it we don't
[1:23:09] need that God proved it we need the
[1:23:11] ministry of Jesus Christ to fit that
[1:23:13] headstone coming y That's brought the
[1:23:16] church into a place where the ministry
[1:23:18] is exactly like it was when Jesus left
[1:23:20] exactly Mighty God unveiled 1964 629
[1:23:25] page 23 it's changed from the Pagan he's
[1:23:27] talking about from glory to glory
[1:23:29] changing coming across East to the West
[1:23:31] it's changed from Pagan down into
[1:23:33] Lutheran from Lutheran down into Wesley
[1:23:35] from Wesley into Pentecost and on and on
[1:23:38] changing from glory to glory producing
[1:23:41] the hidden Manner and now it's right to
[1:23:43] bring him back exactly like he was at
[1:23:46] the beginning his same Ministry the same
[1:23:49] Jesus the Same power the same Holy Ghost
[1:23:51] the same one that come down on the day
[1:23:53] of Pentecost is is the same Holy Ghost
[1:23:55] that's manifested today from Glory into
[1:23:58] glory to glory and back to its original
[1:24:00] seed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:03] with the same signs same wond same
[1:24:05] baptism same kind of people acting the
[1:24:07] same way with the same power the same
[1:24:10] sensation is from Glory under Glory the
[1:24:12] next will be CH be changed from Glory
[1:24:16] into a body like his own glorious body
[1:24:19] where we shall see him Abraham saw the
[1:24:22] same all right
[1:24:27] 22 turn over
[1:24:29] 23 I hope you take these home and read
[1:24:31] them paragraph 1 paragraph 1021 which
[1:24:35] would be question 117 questions and
[1:24:37] answer 64 823
[1:24:40] evening I'm not he I am his servant and
[1:24:42] the pillar of fire is not
[1:24:44] he it's in spirit form see which was
[1:24:48] upon the son of man and has come now to
[1:24:51] anoint sons of men
[1:24:55] now what came on Jesus on the River
[1:24:59] Jordan the full
[1:25:01] anointing right he was born Lord the
[1:25:04] Christ the full anointing came on him on
[1:25:06] the River Jordan for his ministry so
[1:25:07] watch what he's covered right here which
[1:25:09] was a son of man that's come now to
[1:25:10] anoint sons of men to bring back a
[1:25:12] Ministry just like he said it would be
[1:25:15] in order for the head and the rest of
[1:25:16] the body to connect together just like
[1:25:20] like the pyramid as un built and we find
[1:25:22] in that we never did get get the
[1:25:24] headstone on it why The Headstone Yet to
[1:25:26] Come the seven steps in the pyramid and
[1:25:29] we'll go through that someday and I just
[1:25:32] like to show you how that really is
[1:25:34] perfectly with the scriptures all right
[1:25:37] spoken words Original Seed page
[1:25:40] 108 preached 1962 3:18 the evening
[1:25:45] service he was born to do that to
[1:25:47] destroy the works of the devil now his
[1:25:50] body is to do the same because the body
[1:25:53] is the head and body is together is that
[1:25:57] right if Christ is the head now what if
[1:26:01] Christ is the head what's the word his
[1:26:04] body has to be the same thing as his
[1:26:07] head was is that right a church of the
[1:26:09] word born of the word virgin born from
[1:26:11] the word not denominational now virgin
[1:26:14] born from the word keep on reading the
[1:26:17] way the body operates is by the head is
[1:26:19] that right my body can't move until my
[1:26:21] head tells it to move well what if my
[1:26:24] head head is flesh and my body is
[1:26:25] concrete can't move head can say move
[1:26:28] move move move but there's not nothing
[1:26:31] there's nothing to send a message to is
[1:26:34] that right well if my head is Christ and
[1:26:36] my body is a
[1:26:38] denomination how's it going to work how
[1:26:41] can purify and a work together
[1:26:45] Purity and a work together oh I
[1:26:47] love it brother I'll tell you I'd like
[1:26:49] to preach on some of this a while the
[1:26:52] way the body operates Ates is by the
[1:26:55] head and the head is the word is that
[1:26:58] right the head is the
[1:26:59] word now watch what he goes on to say
[1:27:02] man here they can turn on the light 1963
[1:27:04] 12:29 the morning service paragraph 162
[1:27:07] you talking about Pentecostal mana and
[1:27:10] all well yesterday's Luther's manner
[1:27:12] would not work for Methodist Methodist
[1:27:13] manner would not work for Pentecost
[1:27:16] Pentecostal manner will not work for
[1:27:18] today see what I mean every day has come
[1:27:21] day by day fresh and so has it to the
[1:27:24] church ages Luther's manner was the
[1:27:27] message of justification Wesley's man
[1:27:29] message was the manifestation of
[1:27:32] sanctification Pentecostal was the
[1:27:33] restoration of gifts but this is
[1:27:35] introducing The
[1:27:37] Headstone the last days the bride tree
[1:27:39] cont to all of it it it's the same life
[1:27:42] but it's just Mater it's more advanced
[1:27:44] he says all
[1:27:48] right taken from the church a book
[1:27:50] number 26 on your notes 380 which is the
[1:27:53] church a goodness called the resume of
[1:27:55] the ages these H said Luther had the
[1:27:57] spirit of God but his age was not the
[1:27:59] age of full restoration by another
[1:28:02] outpouring like in the beginning it was
[1:28:05] it was the same with Wesley see it
[1:28:07] wouldn't that Booth KN withfield Berard
[1:28:10] Jonathan Edwards M or so forth surely
[1:28:12] they were full of the Holy Ghost yes
[1:28:14] they certainly were but the age in which
[1:28:17] each live was not the age of
[1:28:20] restoration neither was any age but this
[1:28:23] last age the age of complete blackout in
[1:28:27] apos apostasy this is the age of
[1:28:30] apostasy this is the age of restoration
[1:28:33] it is the age of the finished cycle with
[1:28:37] this it is all over amen sign of is
[1:28:40] coming
[1:28:42] 62407 not all them Pentecostal world is
[1:28:46] but I mean in that group they're in
[1:28:48] there somewhere I don't know where
[1:28:49] they're at but they're in there
[1:28:51] somewhere because there'll never be
[1:28:52] another church age then this is the last
[1:28:54] one but God will take that elect out of
[1:28:57] that Pentecostal group and shape it in
[1:28:59] that coming Stone just like that would
[1:29:03] have to fit like that to bring that roof
[1:29:05] down to it you watch it won't be Cy
[1:29:09] cornered and setting this away it'll be
[1:29:12] perfectly fit and this church will have
[1:29:13] to have the same Ministry and Jesus
[1:29:17] testified of the same thing we would see
[1:29:20] Jesus
[1:29:22] 62712 and as the church like the pyramid
[1:29:24] comes to a point so has the church in
[1:29:26] the days of Luther days of Wesley days
[1:29:28] of Pentecost and now just before the
[1:29:31] headstone comes into it that church has
[1:29:33] to be hone so perfectly till the same
[1:29:36] Ministry that he did here his spirit so
[1:29:40] predominant will bring that same body
[1:29:42] right into it and resurrect the whole
[1:29:44] thing exactly that's exactly amen glory
[1:29:47] to God last one turn on the lights 1964
[1:29:51] 1225 that pyramid is so perfect
[1:29:54] if any of you has been there you can't
[1:29:56] run a razor blade hardly they the they
[1:30:00] had no mortar in it as far as we know
[1:30:02] the architect of it was so great now
[1:30:06] they lost The Headstone and they don't
[1:30:07] know where it's at but when The
[1:30:09] Headstone returns it'll be just like the
[1:30:12] rest of it it will blend with the in
[1:30:14] with the stone that's left open if you
[1:30:17] should put the headstone on it it' have
[1:30:20] to be that way and when Jesus returns he
[1:30:23] will find a church that's washed without
[1:30:26] spot or wrinkle it'll be the same
[1:30:28] Ministry he had it'll bring back The
[1:30:32] Headstone so it's left up to you and
[1:30:36] I it's left up to you and I I know that
[1:30:38] was fight
[1:30:39] reading but you can take them home and
[1:30:41] reread
[1:30:44] them you will not stoping to express on
[1:30:46] each one because you can take them home
[1:30:48] and read them and see what he's saying
[1:30:50] the whole point is what just like back
[1:30:53] there when all all the musicians all of
[1:30:55] the trumpeters all the priests and
[1:30:57] everybody got in
[1:31:02] place all right the two tables of stone
[1:31:06] had done come
[1:31:08] in The Headstone had done reached his
[1:31:11] place then the shic of Glory struck
[1:31:15] home what is The Headstone brother Dale
[1:31:17] I believe it is those Seven Seals that
[1:31:20] was brought by the prophet right all
[1:31:23] right right
[1:31:24] I do not believe now you can believe
[1:31:26] what you want to because I've got it
[1:31:27] wrote in my notes to say this over again
[1:31:30] later people have argued Brother Richard
[1:31:33] lost a family because he said that
[1:31:36] brother brandham was adopted in' 63 when
[1:31:40] he met the Angels out there the brother
[1:31:42] said well you don't know that's where it
[1:31:44] was at
[1:31:47] but watch the
[1:31:49] point I believe he was adopted don't you
[1:31:53] where it was in the cabin at 2 years
[1:31:57] old you know or the day he was born or
[1:32:01] whether it was in Arizona in' 63 he was
[1:32:04] adopted right you see quit a church
[1:32:08] because as you're saying and I believe
[1:32:10] this is where he was
[1:32:12] adopted you know what word is your
[1:32:16] adoption well that's what I'm say
[1:32:18] Brother D when I received a new birth I
[1:32:20] was
[1:32:22] adopted into the body of
[1:32:24] Christ a
[1:32:27] baby three stages of
[1:32:30] adoption what about the faith of the
[1:32:34] fathers what do you mean we believe same
[1:32:37] thing the apostles did now the apostles
[1:32:39] never believed in Two Souls seven
[1:32:41] Thunder virtue peria son of man two
[1:32:44] Lords River
[1:32:49] Jordan none of them is in the Bible
[1:32:54] but yet the message people are split all
[1:32:56] over the world by those
[1:33:00] doctrines and everybody says that they
[1:33:05] are
[1:33:07] it and I've told you before there's
[1:33:09] where the deception is going to fall I
[1:33:12] preached the message the other day that
[1:33:14] the prophet of God said what he would do
[1:33:17] these things to try
[1:33:19] us if a prophet speaks and it comes goes
[1:33:23] to
[1:33:24] pass and he takes you to another God he
[1:33:28] said I done it to try
[1:33:31] you you see you think that it's going to
[1:33:34] go one of these days
[1:33:37] until now I hope I'm wrong but this is
[1:33:41] what I've always believed so okay this
[1:33:43] is my personal opinion now
[1:33:48] okay I don't believe you're ever going
[1:33:50] to convert those
[1:33:52] people individual out of those things
[1:33:55] would be right all right but not as a
[1:33:58] whole right and you know what's going to
[1:34:00] happen one
[1:34:02] day when that Shak kind of Glory Falls
[1:34:06] the two Soul people are going to be
[1:34:08] rejoicing around the
[1:34:10] world and saying we told you we was
[1:34:13] right the Shak kind of Glory has
[1:34:17] fallen the seventh Thunder virtue people
[1:34:19] are going the peruse the two Lords
[1:34:22] they're going to be shouting
[1:34:25] I said that 40 years ago I still believe
[1:34:28] it
[1:34:29] today I believe when that anointing
[1:34:31] strikes is just like it is
[1:34:34] now it's to try you to see what you'll
[1:34:36] do
[1:34:38] amen but somewhere right down through
[1:34:41] the middle of that the little bride of
[1:34:43] Jesus Christ will be walking in the
[1:34:47] word there was 120 sitting in the upper
[1:34:50] room out of a world of Millions
[1:34:57] and they were the only one that had the
[1:35:00] truth then we come down to the last days
[1:35:03] anointed ones the spirit poured out upon
[1:35:05] All
[1:35:08] Flesh and God's doing it to Tres to see
[1:35:11] if we'll just stay with the
[1:35:14] word to see what we'll
[1:35:17] do letting things go wrong to see what
[1:35:20] we'll
[1:35:22] do call cing these great signs and
[1:35:25] wonders remember the other week to take
[1:35:27] place to try
[1:35:29] you to see whether you'll stay with the
[1:35:35] word see what would happen to 90% of the
[1:35:39] people if you took two dead people and
[1:35:41] said left them in a congregation and one
[1:35:44] of those doctrinal issues people got up
[1:35:46] and said I'll prove you that I'm right
[1:35:47] but two was going to raise the dead what
[1:35:50] would you do
[1:35:57] well I guess better go along them cuz we
[1:35:59] can't do nothing
[1:36:04] ourselves Bible says to take them out
[1:36:06] and kill
[1:36:09] them you see that's a stern look on your
[1:36:11] face I'm set quoting the
[1:36:13] Bible if my son prophesies a lie I'm
[1:36:17] supposed to kill it right that's
[1:36:21] Bible but yet we don't live in that day
[1:36:24] right we don't do those things we call
[1:36:28] them
[1:36:30] brothers and they can prophesy all kind
[1:36:33] of things and predictions and things and
[1:36:35] we call them
[1:36:40] brothers somebody's going to stay with
[1:36:42] the
[1:36:44] word what are you going to do brother
[1:36:46] Dale I'm going to keep right on going if
[1:36:48] I come here and preach to the post I'll
[1:36:50] be preaching to the Post
[1:36:54] because I'm just going to stay with what
[1:36:55] I've been staying with all this time
[1:36:57] it's led me all this way it's kept me
[1:36:59] from falling into any of these
[1:37:04] doctr I pray to God to just get
[1:37:07] you cuz that's my
[1:37:10] desire brother colie we were over in
[1:37:12] South Carina one time coming back and we
[1:37:14] were talking about one day that there'd
[1:37:17] be a lot of this and that and the other
[1:37:18] happened I said brother collie my
[1:37:20] desires one thing that I've planted

[1:37:28] to Lula that word will hold
[1:37:31] you that's the only desire I
[1:37:34] have popularity is who cares
[1:37:39] right what is it money what's it
[1:37:46] worth brother said Keep Your
[1:37:49] Homes belong to the world counsil of
[1:37:51] churches or take the mark of the beast
[1:37:52] that's what he said
[1:37:54] one of the quotes is exact but you
[1:37:59] know but what are we going to
[1:38:03] do well don't you think we're to go
[1:38:05] listen to what brother so and so says go
[1:38:07] listen to
[1:38:10] it go
[1:38:13] listen but what does the word
[1:38:17] say yeah but it sounds so
[1:38:21] good remember what we started reading
[1:38:24] our headship is the
[1:38:28] word you know they told brother Brandon
[1:38:30] Billy Paul even told him when he told
[1:38:33] that lady she' die at like
[1:38:35] 3:00 Billy Paul said I was in that
[1:38:38] meeting daddy and he said in it was the
[1:38:40] Holy Ghost and brother brandom didn't
[1:38:41] say it
[1:38:43] wasn't get to quote and see Billy Paul
[1:38:46] said it was the Holy
[1:38:50] Ghost he said
[1:38:52] Billy I'm all I'm going to tell you is
[1:38:54] one thing God didn't tell me no
[1:38:58] different right you know what she died
[1:39:03] 3:00 you know that didn't convert a one
[1:39:05] of them that was shouting Glory
[1:39:07] Hallelujah and their tongues and
[1:39:08] interpretations and all the things that
[1:39:10] they were
[1:39:11] saying come
[1:39:13] on did it convert any of them no think
[1:39:18] got him something
[1:39:19] else you remember the lady that was
[1:39:23] fixing her holes and everything and she
[1:39:27] got ready to jump up because she done
[1:39:28] done it till three nights and she jumped
[1:39:31] up to say something and brother randam
[1:39:32] said sit down and shut
[1:39:35] up you know what the preacher said he
[1:39:37] the service was
[1:39:40] over they said brother random you grieve
[1:39:43] the Holy
[1:39:44] Spirit he said how he said she had
[1:39:48] something fresh from God you was just
[1:39:50] bringing the old word
[1:39:57] he said anything contrary to word not
[1:40:00] right
[1:40:02] amen what about
[1:40:05] it what are you going to do cuz I've
[1:40:08] told you what I believe because when
[1:40:10] that sh Falls it's going to fall on
[1:40:14] everything the Methodist the Baptist and
[1:40:17] everybody's going to be shot and Glory
[1:40:19] Hallelujah but you know you say well
[1:40:22] well brother d you just preached it that
[1:40:24] that's what will happen in in the temple
[1:40:28] but you didn't
[1:40:31] listen The Headstone which was the
[1:40:35] word went in the
[1:40:38] temple and took its place that's why I
[1:40:41] read the two different accounts which is
[1:40:43] telling you one just telling you what it
[1:40:47] is when they went
[1:40:49] in the temple the Ark of the Covenant
[1:40:52] reached his
[1:40:53] Place Chronicles tells you they were
[1:40:57] rejoicing and having a great
[1:40:59] time the word had already reached his
[1:41:05] place I believe the word is just about
[1:41:07] reached his place
[1:41:09] amen I said just about
[1:41:12] it I don't have no
[1:41:16] argument then the anointing can
[1:41:19] strike but what's it going to strike
[1:41:24] remember the rain falls on the just and
[1:41:26] the
[1:41:30] unjust what about it what about the
[1:41:38] word people might not understand our
[1:41:40] terminologies but we're just simply
[1:41:42] talking about
[1:41:43] salvation
[1:41:46] right being born again amen by the
[1:41:49] uncorrupt uncorruptible word of God

[1:42:08] you cuz you could at least say when I
[1:42:10] brother Dale believes
[1:42:13] that cuz see if you tell me something
[1:42:16] unless I got a
[1:42:18] reason you know I'm going to believe

[1:42:24] I've always been you say well that's
[1:42:26] your problem believe anything I'll

[1:43:55] again take on these things let's go into
[1:43:58] the
[1:43:59] communion and just think on these things
[1:44:03] Terrence and Bob if you
[1:44:05] will let's stand
[1:44:07] together go into the
[1:44:14] communion they were in one mind in one
[1:44:19] Accord and they come to communion time
[1:44:23] they had reached a
[1:44:30] place they had reached the
[1:44:33] place that they were supposed to
[1:44:36] be and when they
[1:44:39] did then they had the
[1:44:42] communion you
[1:44:48] know for I have received of the Lord
[1:44:50] that which also I delivered unto you
[1:44:52] that the Lord Jesus was the same night
[1:44:53] in which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:44:56] when he had given thanks he break it and
[1:44:57] said take eat this is my body which is
[1:44:59] broken for you this do in remembrance of
[1:45:02] me after the same manner also he took
[1:45:04] the cup when he had s saying this cup is
[1:45:07] the New Testament in my blood this do ye
[1:45:09] as often as you drink it in remembrance
[1:45:10] of me for as often as you eat this bread
[1:45:13] and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's
[1:45:15] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[1:45:18] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:45:19] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:45:22] of the body and blood of the Lord so let
[1:45:24] a man examine himself and so let him eat
[1:45:26] of that bread and drink of that cup for
[1:45:28] he that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:45:30] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[1:45:32] not Discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:45:34] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:45:36] and many sleep for if we would judge
[1:45:39] ourselves we should not be judged and I
[1:45:41] love this scripture but when we are
[1:45:43] judged we are chasen to the Lord that we
[1:45:46] should not be condemned with the world
[1:45:48] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:45:50] together to eat carry one for another
[1:45:52] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:45:54] home that you come not together into
[1:45:56] condemnation and the rest will I set in
[1:45:59] order when I
[1:46:01] come think on these
[1:46:05] things think on these

[1:56:31] been able to
[1:56:33] see that what God has revealed to
[1:56:37] us and we can
[1:56:40] see the word that he's made known in our
[1:56:43] hearts and
[1:56:46] lives and just think about
[1:56:50] it where would we be be if it wasn't
[1:56:53] that word that's been
[1:56:58] revealed may be a hard thing but yet
[1:57:01] where would we be what would be the the
[1:57:08] point life without God would be
[1:57:12] a meaningless thing right amen

[1:57:23] what a wonderful opportunity that has
[1:57:25] been given to you and I to be able to
[1:57:27] take God's word and to hear it blessed
[1:57:31] are your eyes for they see and your ears
[1:57:33] for they
[1:57:36] hear if I die and go to hell I can still
[1:57:38] be
[1:57:39] happy because I can say I've
[1:57:44] seen I can say that I've seen God's
[1:57:49] word what about you
[1:58:02] [Music]
[1:58:09] in
[1:58:18] [Music]
[1:58:34] let's all protect
[1:58:45] together you can be seated for a moment
[1:58:48] till
[1:58:49] we read our scriptures and get ready for
[1:58:53] for the foot
[1:58:55] washing but just think about
[1:58:58] it what an opportunity we have been
[1:59:03] given you know that mankind I remember
[1:59:06] when I was back there and I'm sure that
[1:59:08] you think you can
[1:59:09] remember when
[1:59:11] we we were
[1:59:13] in organized religions and
[1:59:17] things wondering about God
[1:59:22] up one day down the next you
[1:59:27] know one man preach something to us make
[1:59:30] us feel good and other man preach the
[1:59:31] next week make us feel bad and just up
[1:59:35] and
[1:59:37] down
[1:59:40] but then to be able to say that we can
[1:59:42] take the
[1:59:44] word and believe
[1:59:47] it just further Advanced as I read to
[1:59:50] you glory glory to glory further
[1:59:56] Advanced but how can it Advance much
[1:59:59] further than where we
[2:00:03] are I'm not we don't make dates and
[2:00:07] times and Seasons we're not concerned
[2:00:08] but you know there will be a day and a
[2:00:11] time I think I mentioned it may have
[2:00:13] even just here but you know the Bible
[2:00:16] says no man knows the day or the hour
[2:00:19] that's right well if you took 365 people
[2:00:22] and gave each one of them a
[2:00:25] day you you understand what I mean 365
[2:00:28] people stand them up and you got day one
[2:00:30] day two day three day four then next
[2:00:32] month next month next month next month
[2:00:35] and you know each one of them say was my
[2:00:36] day my day my
[2:00:38] day well you
[2:00:41] know you know you still wouldn't be able
[2:00:44] to deny that scripture that says no man
[2:00:47] knows the day or the hour you know why
[2:00:50] cuz you got that one quter of a
[2:00:54] day
[2:00:55] right cuz it's actually 365 in the
[2:00:58] fourth
[2:01:00] days
[2:01:02] right which means you've got 365 and
[2:01:05] then every four years or what it turns
[2:01:07] you got that one day that falls in there
[2:01:10] cuz see you still couldn't do it so the
[2:01:13] scripture is still right no man knows
[2:01:15] the day nor the
[2:01:16] hour there's no way because he doesn't
[2:01:20] make that to mankind
[2:01:22] he does it in his own let's stand
[2:01:25] together and read our scripture then
[2:01:26] we'll go into the foot
[2:01:28] washing 13th chapter of John verse 2 and
[2:01:32] supper being ended the devil having now
[2:01:33] put into the heart of Judas his carrot
[2:01:35] Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing
[2:01:38] that the father had given all things
[2:01:39] into his hands and that he was come from
[2:01:41] God and went to God he rises from supper
[2:01:43] and laid aside his garments and took a
[2:01:45] towel and GED himself after that he
[2:01:47] poured water into a basin and began to
[2:01:49] wash the disciples feet and to wipe them
[2:01:51] with the wherewith he was GED then
[2:01:54] cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter Sith
[2:01:56] unto him Lord Dost thou wash my feet
[2:01:58] Jesus answered and said unto him what I
[2:02:01] do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt
[2:02:03] know Hereafter Peter said unto him Thou
[2:02:06] shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered
[2:02:08] him if I wash thee not thou Hast no part
[2:02:10] with me Simon Peter said unto him Lord
[2:02:13] not my feet only but also my hands and
[2:02:15] my head Jesus said unto him he that is
[2:02:18] washed needeth not saved to wash his
[2:02:20] feet but his clean every with and you
[2:02:22] are clean but not all for he knew who
[2:02:25] should betray him therefore said he you
[2:02:27] are not all clean so after he had washed
[2:02:30] their feet and had taken his garments
[2:02:32] and was set down again he said unto them
[2:02:34] know you what I have done to you you
[2:02:36] call me master and Lord and you say well
[2:02:39] for so I am if I then your Lord and
[2:02:41] Master have washed your feet you also
[2:02:44] ought to wash one another's feet for I
[2:02:46] have given you an example that you
[2:02:48] should do as I have done to you verily
[2:02:50] verily I say unto you the servant is not
[2:02:52] greater than his Lord neither he that is
[2:02:54] sent greater than he that sent him if
[2:02:57] you know these things happy are ye if
[2:03:00] you do them let's just all bow our head
[2:03:02] and be dismissed father we pray now as
[2:03:05] we going into the foot wash and the
[2:03:06] sisters going downstairs to continue
[2:03:09] this Lord we ask that you would bless
[2:03:11] each one and give each one of us
[2:03:13] understanding and then when all is
[2:03:15] finished and done may you protect us on
[2:03:17] the highway and give everybody a safe
[2:03:19] journey we love you and we thank you in
[2:03:21] Jesus name amen you're dismissed
