[6:52] the older we're getting you know the
[6:54] more that they're having to be called on
[6:57] duty to come forth the helm and introdu

[7:12] a Father's Day so well I guess it's
[7:17] surprise to announce there's going to be
[7:22] a father among us pretty quick and I
[7:26] haven't figured out yet for you know
[7:29] what it's gonna work out to because they

[7:49] no high other things to go in Tesla but
[7:52] we appreciate the father sufficient
[7:55] opportunity to be able to know who our
[7:57] father really is because he you could
[8:01] have been like I was they offered to
[8:03] adopt us out when I was a child you know
[8:06] about four or five years old because Dad
[8:08] died and they wanted to adopt us out
[8:11] well maybe material wise I would have
[8:14] been in good shape because of know the
[8:15] person that would have would have been
[8:17] the one to adopt us out but that still
[8:20] would have changed a lot of things and
[8:22] it's not not to be but you know because
[8:24] of all of that I found out who my true
[8:26] father is the natural father is
[8:29] wonderful that's good the Father's Day
[8:31] we give the gifts we do the cards we do
[8:34] everything but a real father is the lord

[12:46] morning we want to speak to the author
[12:48] of the word Amen just want to thank God
[12:51] him I've always thought of myself as you

[12:56] preacher you know I was in Ghana and the
[12:58] brother said to me and said brother
[13:00] Keith I mean I can't believe you still
[13:02] preach from papers and notes and all of
[13:05] that really it seems to them I was kind
[13:08] of backward that's all right

[13:15] step into the office and getting ready
[13:17] to preach and then ah ah I just got the

[13:56] to pick you're a bride for a rapture and
[13:58] Lord God as we walk Lord God we know
[14:01] that along the path we deviate Lord God
[14:04] is destruction along all paths what Lord
[14:07] God when I keep to that straight and
[14:09] narrow path of God that lead to life
[14:11] everlasting Lord God we pray that you'd
[14:15] bless us O God this morning to the the
[14:17] heady fiying of the body of Christ Lord
[14:20] remember those that are without - this
[14:21] morning Lord God we pray that you would
[14:24] bless O God give us a godly example by
[14:27] your word God we pray blesses now when
[14:30] we thank you for all things and believe
[14:32] you speak to our lips and may the years
[14:34] that would be anointed hear your word of
[14:36] God today and Lord God may be an
[14:38] experience for a walk as we pray
[14:40] believing in Jesus name Amen and amen
[14:47] you know I was just in in Ghana and I
[14:53] was looking at the different custom of
[14:55] people you know you know everywhere we
[14:58] do things a little different and
[15:00] so you know I was there and you know I
[15:03] realized that when somebody died the
[15:05] customs and so really you know what they
[15:08] do brother we'd the day before the
[15:10] funeral you know they would have gone to
[15:12] the funeral home and it's a fanfare and
[15:14] they go and they collect the body and
[15:17] they take it home and they set it up in
[15:19] the house or they set it on the veranda
[15:22] and they said you know if the person was
[15:24] a tailor they put him in front of a
[15:27] machine and give him a crouch and all of
[15:29] that and they kept him on to tomorrow so
[15:41] I went you know III could hear them you
[15:43] know playing the music and so from where
[15:45] I was staying and I walked there because
[15:47] I wanted to see what is I'm a very
[15:49] inquisitive kind of a person and when I
[15:52] go I saw this guy you know just
[15:54] crouching up in a chair really and I
[15:55] thought it was somebody alive I didn't
[15:57] know that's the guy that was dead and so
[16:03] they they kept that for three days yeah
[16:05] well they they buried the body the next
[16:07] day but they keep that music and
[16:08] everything for three days and I realized
[16:10] what it is it's like the people from the
[16:12] community they go and they everybody
[16:14] don't need money and after three days
[16:16] the family come together
[16:17] and they count upon which they have
[16:19] because that's when they pay for the
[16:21] funeral where I tell you you know I
[16:27] could be with the guy I could collect
[16:29] all the money but I didn't want that
[16:32] dead person in the house you know it
[16:39] doesn't matter how much you love each
[16:41] other man there's something about debt
[16:42] you know you there's a separation
[16:46] incidentally we have one of our sister
[16:48] you know died just about two two weeks
[16:51] ago and she was 15 years ago she was
[16:56] actually in an accident a very serious
[16:58] accident she was going to the market and
[17:00] you know the the car at an a crash and
[17:05] there were seven persons in the vehicle
[17:08] and six of them died she was the only
[17:10] person that survived really
[17:14] and so 59 years after God took her you
[17:17] know and so we certainly thank God for
[17:20] life and so and so we were going back to
[17:24] do the funeral in July
[17:26] it's a why so long that's what we do it
[17:28] in Jamaica you would have where the
[17:33] first in three days of manner to us
[17:36] that's like disrespect if we love you
[17:45] keep it for long deal of the lordís
[17:50] morning shake somebody and said god
[17:52] bless you god bless you amen in Acts
[17:58] chapter 3 let me read from verse 12 of
[18:05] Acts chapter 3 and when Peter saw it and
[18:10] answered the people Heymann of Israel
[18:13] why Marvel II this or why look he saw
[18:17] earnestly at us as though by our own
[18:19] power or holiness we had made this man
[18:22] to walk the God of Abraham but of Isaac
[18:27] and of Jacob the god of Our Fathers has
[18:29] glorified His Son Jesus whom ye
[18:32] delivered up and denied him in the
[18:35] presence of Pilate when he was
[18:37] determined to let him go but he denied
[18:41] the Holy One and the just and desired
[18:44] murderer to be granted on to you and
[18:48] killed the Prince of life whom God has
[18:52] raised from the dead whereof we are
[18:54] witnesses I'm glad to be a witness this
[18:56] morning reign and his name true fate in
[19:00] his name has made this man strong whom
[19:03] he see and know Eve the faith which is
[19:07] by him as given him the perfect
[19:10] soundness in the presence of you all and
[19:13] now brethren I wot that through
[19:15] ignorance he did it as did also your
[19:19] rulers but this but those things which
[19:22] God before had showed by the mouth of
[19:25] all the
[19:26] it's that Christ should suffer and ask
[19:29] so fulfilled repent he therefore and be
[19:33] converted that your sins may be blotted
[19:36] out when the time of refreshing shall
[19:38] come from the presence of the Lord and
[19:42] he shall send Jesus Christ which before
[19:45] was preached unto you whom the Evin must
[19:48] receive until the time of restitution of
[19:51] all things which God has spoken by the
[19:54] mouth of all his holy prophets since the
[19:57] world began
[19:58] for Moses truly said unto the father's a
[20:02] prophet shall the Lord your God raise up
[20:05] unto you of your brethren like unto me
[20:08] him shall he hear in all things
[20:10] whatsoever he shall say unto you and he
[20:13] shall come to pass that every soul which
[20:15] will not hear that prophet shall be
[20:18] destroyed from among the people yay and
[20:21] all the prophets from Samuel and those
[20:25] that follow after as many as a spoken of
[20:28] likewise foretold of these days he are
[20:32] the children of the prophets and of the
[20:34] Covenant which God made with our fathers
[20:36] are saying unto Abraham and in thy seed
[20:38] shall all the Kindred's of the earth be
[20:42] blessed
[20:43] unto you first God having raised his son
[20:47] Jesus sent him to bless you in turning
[20:51] away every one of you from his iniquity
[20:54] Amen hallelujah may the Lord life is
[20:57] blessing to the reading of the word you
[20:59] may be seated
[21:00] I would like to speak this morning on
[21:03] the New Testament church the New
[21:08] Testament church this is not Judaism no
[21:13] this is not the Church of the Pharisees
[21:15] or the Sadducees no this is a church
[21:19] which begins on the day of Pentecost
[21:22] amen and the Prophet says that
[21:25] hallelujah the church that started on
[21:28] the day of Pentecost has no end
[21:32] in other words Pentecost he says as a
[21:35] beginning it has no handle
[21:37] and so we've got to realize of a church
[21:40] that we're in today is a Pentecostal
[21:43] church amen you know they said Pentecost
[21:46] hallelujah is a shouter and so I'm glad
[21:50] that I'm not afraid of a shout Amen as a
[21:53] matter fact we shout a lot hallelujah
[21:56] because we're that church where the
[21:58] continuation of the church which begins
[22:01] on the day of Pentecost the Bible says
[22:03] and when there were nice abroad
[22:06] hallelujah him and they came and they
[22:08] speed they said these men look like
[22:10] they're drunkard he said we're not drunk
[22:13] as you suppose
[22:14] but this is that which was spoken their
[22:17] lies manifesting in that time was
[22:20] updating the scripture hallelujah amen
[22:24] of the prophets here we are today and I
[22:27] tell you the way that church was that's
[22:30] the way this church ought to be
[22:32] hallelujah amen still believing in the
[22:35] power of Almighty God the Bible said
[22:38] that the Word of God comes not in words
[22:40] only but in power and demonstration of
[22:44] the Holy Ghost are you there with me and
[22:47] then I find that the problem among us
[22:49] today is that we don't have the faith to
[22:51] exercise in the power of God amen we
[22:56] know what it is fundamentally hallelujah
[22:59] but we don't exercise our faith in God's
[23:02] Word hallelujah and so the prophet of
[23:05] God Center now do we get into that
[23:07] church he said for by one spirit are we
[23:10] all baptized into one body which is the
[23:13] body of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah we
[23:16] don't come into the church buyer and
[23:18] shaker we don't come in by association
[23:21] we don't come in by all of us or who we
[23:23] love
[23:24] no sir we come in one way is that right
[23:27] certainly when we're gathered together
[23:29] there's a multitude and then there are
[23:32] those that are born again and there are
[23:34] those that are not born again him in
[23:36] these young people sometimes of the
[23:38] church where they're there because their
[23:40] parents are made them to be there but in
[23:43] the body of Jesus Christ we come in by
[23:46] the spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost
[23:50] amen
[23:51] it means that every one of us must know
[23:53] who Jesus is is a central theme of our
[23:58] experience him and I was reading last
[24:01] night in question and answer 1964
[24:03] somebody wrote a question he said
[24:05] brother branham you know they said that
[24:07] hallelujah you're not just a normal man
[24:10] you are Jesus Christ and brother Branham
[24:13] said you know he said if you take that
[24:15] literally the weights said he said
[24:17] that's the greatest error but he said
[24:20] but yet you've got some truth you see
[24:23] what he did he did not put it all on
[24:26] himself he said but you that as Christ
[24:29] in you
[24:30] it's another Jesus Christ on the face of
[24:33] the earth if we can take it like that
[24:36] you see the problem with the people is
[24:39] that they put everything on the
[24:40] prophetic for rudder and nothing on the
[24:43] bride but Roux Liam brand was not the
[24:46] object of Christ coming in this day know
[24:49] you are that of the object of that are
[24:52] you here with me hallelujah he's not the
[24:55] continuation of Christ you are the
[24:57] continuation of Christ is the writer he
[25:01] come to bring us to a position is the
[25:04] rod but if we don't become that word
[25:06] then all that is failure is the writer
[25:10] hallelujah
[25:11] so you know you begin to tell us er him
[25:13] in our God is known are you there with
[25:16] me in the message believe us know this
[25:18] some sir my brother you can have this to
[25:20] it 6004 0 to him in paragraph 74 I'd
[25:26] like to take this really remember of
[25:28] this organize he said where do they find
[25:31] him where did they find Jesus right
[25:36] where they left him where did they leave
[25:39] him at the feast of Pentecost hallelujah
[25:43] amen where do we leave Jesus where did
[25:47] the church at the feast of Pentecost
[25:49] when we get away from that old-time
[25:53] Pentecostal power him in the feast of
[25:56] Pentecost we walk away from Jesus
[25:58] that's exactly right friends we are
[26:01] living on
[26:02] our privileges amen yes sir
[26:06] him and they left him at the feast of
[26:08] Pentecost and there's only one place
[26:10] that Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[26:13] Pentecostals will ever find him is go
[26:16] back where you left him at is that right
[26:19] where is the joy of the Lord I would ask
[26:24] that this morning where is the joy of
[26:26] the Lord hallelujah because wherever God
[26:29] is this joy where is the power of our
[26:33] Lord the church acts today what happened
[26:36] to God of history a man is waiting for
[26:41] his people to call him on the scene
[26:43] again is the writer and we can't do it
[26:49] payment through denominations no sir
[26:52] because when we get to denominations
[26:55] we're taking some man's idea over the
[26:59] Word of God his errata
[27:02] we can't do it on the psychology no sir
[27:05] because we're looking at the traits of
[27:07] men hey man we can't do it under artist
[27:11] thematical or we can't do it with
[27:15] education no sir
[27:17] we separate ourselves divide ourselves
[27:20] we are not divided we are one person
[27:23] indeed in Christ Jesus we are all one in
[27:28] Christ and our denominations will never
[27:31] do it as good as they are they won't do
[27:35] it our education is the greatest
[27:37] endurance to the gospel ever is that
[27:42] right amen
[27:43] what we need is not education we need
[27:48] the power and demonstration of the Holy
[27:51] Ghost back into the church to
[27:53] demonstrate the power amen
[27:58] Jesus never said going to all the world
[28:00] hallelujah hey many he said going to the
[28:03] world and teach he never said going to
[28:06] the world and do he said going to all
[28:09] the world and preach the gospel and the
[28:12] gospel it's the
[28:14] demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost
[28:16] is errata the resurrection we are still
[28:21] a million miles short where we should be
[28:25] let us move forward let's go back to
[28:29] where we left him at the feast of
[28:31] Pentecost Jesus said in John I believe a
[28:34] 15 chapter he said I am the vine ye are
[28:38] the branches
[28:39] well now if that vine put forth the
[28:43] first branch and out of that branch
[28:45] wrote a book of Acts he said the second
[28:49] branch will make another book of Acts
[28:53] and the third branch will make another
[28:57] book of action is a rod hallelujah and
[29:01] every branch that comes out of that vine
[29:05] will be the same branch amen he said no
[29:09] notice he said the vine does not bear
[29:12] the fruit it is a branch that bear the
[29:16] fruit hallelujah so if we're waiting
[29:21] said well when Jesus come back this is
[29:23] gonna happen
[29:24] you see that's what the people who go
[29:26] and brother branham come back we'll see
[29:28] the power again but what about the power
[29:31] that God has invested in you this is a
[29:36] church in action is it run
[29:38] where do we take our yardstick not from
[29:42] what somebody says oh we find that this
[29:44] kid grow up on our land because people
[29:47] said well if you see a certain thing
[29:49] they said ah you're trying to be like
[29:51] the Prophet what if the Prophet that
[29:55] being like Jesus Paul said follow me as
[30:00] I follow Christ is the right amen so
[30:03] where are we going to be we are going to
[30:05] be another book of action that's a New
[30:08] Testament church amen hallelujah him in
[30:13] 1947 faith is a substance hallelujah
[30:17] paragraph 69 he said God is not in
[30:21] material things no sir
[30:23] God is in men
[30:27] you know where the church has gone today
[30:30] him and apostles are pulling for more
[30:33] and more and more riches and they're
[30:36] preaching a gospel of prosperity you you
[30:40] know your your blessing is in your
[30:42] catalog in the parking lot
[30:45] your blessing is in your cabin upon the
[30:48] hill your blessing is in material things
[30:51] but brethren I say to you if the
[30:54] blessing of God is a material things
[30:57] that you have then those that are
[31:00] outside of Christ and more than you've
[31:04] got think about it
[31:09] amen that is not your blessing no sir
[31:14] I've got a suit on because I work and
[31:17] buy one yes
[31:20] if you labor there's something that goes
[31:22] with it
[31:23] it's a Rotter maybe that's not the
[31:26] blessing of God I'm coming there down to
[31:28] it these are the Holy Ghost
[31:30] never fall an organization it fell on
[31:34] men and so many people today say they
[31:38] don't belong to my fate well if you're
[31:42] the fate of Christ
[31:44] it's all the same God doesn't care about
[31:48] he said our organization don't mean
[31:50] anything that to him and he said the
[31:53] people got their self to a place it's
[31:56] just a big organized world and it that's
[32:00] the reason I'd rather have it in an
[32:03] auditorium he said if it's with the
[32:07] oneness Church the Trinity won't come if
[32:11] it's a Trinity Church the oneness won't
[32:13] come if it's the Methodists their
[32:16] Baptist won't come if it's in a Baptist
[32:18] Church the Methodists won't come
[32:20] hallelujah one body one person said
[32:23] should we be baptized over now in order
[32:26] to comma to be prayed for mercy that's
[32:30] as pagan as we can ever get that's right
[32:33] now he said for by one spirit we're all
[32:37] but
[32:38] into one body
[32:42] brethren there's only one way
[32:44] justification sanctification that
[32:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost put you into
[32:50] the body of Jesus Christ amen and that
[32:55] means whether you're first generation
[32:56] second generation third generation it
[32:59] doesn't matter what generation it's the
[33:01] same way and it will never change
[33:04] amen he's a regardless of who you are
[33:08] and where you are that's right so it
[33:11] doesn't make any difference what
[33:13] organization you are you don't have to
[33:16] belong to Baptist Church or Methodist
[33:18] Church or Pentecostal or whatever it is
[33:21] you have to have faith in God and
[33:25] frankly you don't have to belong to no
[33:29] church but you've got to heal and go
[33:33] sing them again and no sin again it will
[33:37] come on you again worse than it was in
[33:40] the first place you go somewhere then to
[33:43] church and serve God God don't heal you
[33:47] for the devil's glory
[33:48] I wish we were to hear that amen you see
[33:52] people want to be healed they want
[33:55] deliverance but they don't want the God
[33:57] of the deliverance then they want to be
[34:00] healed so they can go back and sit at
[34:02] the bar stool and drink their beer they
[34:06] don't want God they want to give from
[34:09] the giver but they don't want to give up
[34:14] in the message hear him he said God
[34:16] don't save you to lose you he'll be
[34:19] defeating his purpose because sometimes
[34:22] we make heaven so high and so glorious
[34:27] now the common people can't walk into it
[34:30] I was in a missis meeting and they were
[34:33] talking about the simple salvation and
[34:37] I'll tell you a man that being in this
[34:40] message for over 30 years and I hear
[34:42] some ministers talk about salvation I
[34:45] wouldn't know what to go in there finish
[34:47] I wouldn't know what to do amen because
[34:51] they're so deep I don't understand what
[34:54] they're saying but the Bible said but by
[34:57] one spirit are we all baptized into one
[35:02] body Oh glory to God yes sir
[35:08] a man I'll tell you the truth amen
[35:12] you know we put such a standard a mean
[35:15] you know we dig so deep until we say it
[35:18] and we say that we say that and the
[35:20] children don't know what to do amen
[35:24] but the Bible it says believe on the
[35:27] Lord Jesus and you and your household
[35:31] shall be saved
[35:33] amen that I like is that right amen
[35:38] expectation 1950 paragraph 10 he said
[35:42] and the teachers here of the scripture
[35:44] will teach you these things that's 9

[36:21] rapture there be not one fever one among
[36:24] you who will we ever get there
[36:27] I tell you church divine healing is a
[36:30] minor but it's a harvest of your
[36:33] resurrection and if there's no divine
[36:36] healing there's no resurrection is a
[36:40] Roger although we said all yes I believe
[36:43] yes I believe now put your faith in

[52:07] that's your feet you take it until you
[52:09] die amen
[52:12] hallelujah somebody says you see people
[52:15] preaching about him and faith healing I
[52:18] tell them go prove it
[52:20] hey but I say it like this
[52:22] I will pray for the sick and I expect
[52:26] them to be healed and brother when our
[52:28] prayer
[52:29] if the sick not heal it's not my
[52:31] business the Bible said is there any
[52:34] sick among you let them call for the
[52:37] elders of the church let them anoint
[52:39] them with oil and the prayer of faith
[52:41] shall save this is that the scripture
[52:44] when I keep god's word i don't worry
[52:47] about that's God's business no amen
[52:50] but God will honor his own word but
[52:56] brother Branham said it doesn't matter
[52:58] how much i pray for you if you don't
[53:00] believe you'll never be healing here so
[53:07] do we quit preaching it because somebody
[53:09] don't believe i still preach it because
[53:12] God is a healer amen
[53:14] I just come up from Ghana hallelujah and
[53:17] two things that bother the people there

[53:26] problem hepatitis C I don't know what

[53:41] it's a brother kita
[53:43] the person is totally well I said that's
[53:46] the power of God you know brother
[53:53] Branham could go back and brother
[53:54] grandma say depression is a demon like a
[53:57] dark shadow and he said one was like
[54:00] aiming a turtle with curved legs and and
[54:03] all of that really listen I can't see
[54:05] all of that but I don't need to see the
[54:08] boy is and the Lord that healeth thee
[54:11] that's a New Testament church Alleluia
[54:17] and Brigitte Ottawa in first Corey gets
[54:21] to 13 but though I speak with the
[54:25] tongues of men and angels and have not
[54:27] charity I become a son in brass and a
[54:31] tinkling cymbal and though I give up my
[54:34] body to be burned
[54:36] and do I feed the poor and have not
[54:38] charity it profits me nothing amen
[54:42] hallelujah we're not saying this is a
[54:46] hallmark but I said the New Testament
[54:49] church was of the power of God amen
[54:53] hallelujah in the three witnesses 1951
[55:00] through 728 paragraph 10 now there's a
[55:05] body and in this body
[55:07] we're baptized by the Holy Ghost into
[55:11] this body and made partakers of God and
[55:14] of eternal life and that is the essence
[55:17] of it really we are made by the baptism
[55:20] of the Holy Ghost you're made partakers
[55:22] of God and of eternal life through the
[55:27] gift of God which is a free gift of God
[55:30] given to all so ever we'll let him come
[55:34] amen know that put us in the body and
[55:38] when we're in the body in that body is
[55:42] nine spiritual gifts or spiritual gift
[55:46] operating is a right and it will come
[55:49] upon one I better leave the subject
[55:53] alone let's see I never come here to
[55:56] teach I come here to talk to pray for
[55:58] the sick it might be a little against
[56:01] your theology theological teaching you
[56:03] see but anyhow God be with you and help
[56:07] you and bless you is my pearl alright
[56:11] amen hallelujah
[56:14] first Corinthians twelve by one Spirit
[56:18] we were all baptized into one body
[56:22] become members of that body hallelujah
[56:25] and brother Branson and in that body
[56:27] this nine spiritual gift in the early
[56:32] church here it was that the Bible said
[56:36] they had all things in common you see
[56:38] the attitude of the early church is that
[56:40] any day they were going to be taken in a
[56:42] rapture
[56:43] that's the attitude
[56:45] they were ready to go that they did not
[56:47] know that we would still be here
[56:49] no sir that table every day was tomorrow
[56:51] and so they they sell what they had
[56:54] Halloween they distributed that all may
[56:57] not all things in common and didn't
[57:00] command the people to do it but out of
[57:03] love people are doing that because the
[57:06] charge of the gospel had put an
[57:08] anointing over the people and Ananias
[57:12] and Sapphira they sold what they had but
[57:18] they didn't have the fit to do like
[57:21] others do and so they thought within
[57:24] themselves well you know I mean if
[57:26] anything happened and this thing will
[57:27] work out we want something to run back
[57:30] to it's like you're coming into a field
[57:33] marriage until you into a marriage like
[57:35] that it's going to feel you know when
[57:38] she says you know I'm gonna keep this
[57:40] because if the marriage will work out I
[57:43] want to have something to come back to
[57:45] and and if he says daddy leave my room
[57:48] they're vacant because if it don't work
[57:49] and I'm you're gonna go back to that
[57:51] room because you don't go in it with all
[57:53] your heart I'm not here to preach that
[57:56] I'm just saying this if there's a way
[58:02] out you're gonna find a way out amen
[58:04] when you come to crisis like a marriage
[58:07] and yell so here in an a sense of farah
[58:10] nobody tell them to do it but you see
[58:13] they did what they didn't you know he
[58:15] comes in to the apostles and he think
[58:18] that well this is just Pete and the rest
[58:20] of them and he said we were so little
[58:23] and this is all we got Peter said man
[58:28] why you lied to the Holy Ghost because
[58:31] he thought that when he comes to church
[58:34] it was Pastor Dan and pastor wind and
[58:38] pastor black and you know buzzer he
[58:41] thought it was just them II didn't
[58:43] realize catch the revelation that is the
[58:46] holy gloss that is leading the church
[58:50] so he thought that if I just say that
[58:54] everything is alright and right there in
[58:58] the presence of the Holy Ghost he
[59:01] dropped dead and they lift him and they
[59:04] take him out a church and his wife never
[59:06] realized what was happening you know she
[59:08] was checked chatting to the girls in the
[59:10] other side you know when the woman come
[59:11] to church what they do and so she now
[59:13] comes in and says hey you know you he's
[59:17] solely because that was a plan and
[59:18] there's all we got he said the same
[59:21] man's that carry out your husband
[59:24] they're gonna carry you out too because
[59:27] they lie not to the men of God but they
[59:31] lied to the Holy Ghost brethren when we
[59:35] realize that it's a Holy Ghost that
[59:37] operates the church then our action
[59:40] would be different amen cuz there's some
[59:43] people that love their pasta to debt and
[59:46] there's some people that heat is good
[59:48] because he preached a message one time
[59:50] and it stepped right on their tour and
[59:53] they'll never forget that hallelujah I
[59:57] tell you one thing people have to same
[59:58] anywhere you go on Wednesday night I was
[1:00:03] saying something in church and this
[1:00:04] morning I was in a dream and I was
[1:00:07] dreaming the same thing and Ron I was
[1:00:10] dreaming Frenchie wake me up and you
[1:00:13] know last week I was dreaming and he you
[1:00:17] know it's a wife and a husband the
[1:00:19] husband was in that dream and she woke
[1:00:21] me up and now the wife was in this dream
[1:00:22] and she woke me up this morning so mom
[1:00:25] what kind of woman is this but I was
[1:00:31] still in the church you know I remember
[1:00:33] two times were the way they had
[1:00:35] something to honor me as their pasta and
[1:00:38] you know it was fine that they did that
[1:00:39] or they even add that thought to do it
[1:00:41] really but I felt crushed inside and
[1:00:44] bliss is why I felt crushed
[1:00:46] it's not the people that are there that
[1:00:48] come to give you know say something nice
[1:00:51] about you is those that did not come
[1:00:55] because they think I mean why should we
[1:00:59] do this to our pasta your unibrow weird
[1:01:02] across your feelings laugh you
[1:01:03] you know they don't that somebody don't
[1:01:05] like me and it's not a thousand that
[1:01:07] like it's not one that show you that
[1:01:09] they really hate your guts and in the
[1:01:13] dream this morning I was telling the
[1:01:15] sister they hate your guts it's a
[1:01:18] pastor's wife but I was saying to her
[1:01:20] they eat your gut as a human you feel it
[1:01:23] but you gotta pray for them in here and
[1:01:25] she should walk you out of the sleep
[1:01:29] amen so I might as well tell you I don't
[1:01:32] know it might be for somebody here
[1:01:34] somebody's gonna hit your guts but you
[1:01:36] prefer them in here
[1:01:37] it's Christ in you the New Testament
[1:01:45] church had come into a body that there
[1:01:48] were a family together as one in the
[1:01:53] church there was no big I I know little
[1:01:56] you everybody had all things in common
[1:02:00] that the minister of the church becomes
[1:02:04] that they gave to those who did not have
[1:02:08] and the stronger support the weaker
[1:02:12] because there were a family together
[1:02:14] brethren that's what the church ought to
[1:02:17] be today but the church is not just a
[1:02:20] mechanical setting the church is a
[1:02:24] spiritual supernatural body moving with
[1:02:28] the impulse of Christ that brother
[1:02:31] Branham said if you say that I'm Jesus
[1:02:34] Christ
[1:02:35] he said that's pagan that's an hero but
[1:02:39] if you say that we want Jesus Christ and
[1:02:43] musasa
[1:02:44] he said you're perfectly right don't put
[1:02:50] it all in the past of the preacher the
[1:02:53] farfel ministry because the body of
[1:02:55] Christ is moving with the same impulse
[1:02:58] of Christ and what a day when we are so
[1:03:03] affected by the Word of God at the same
[1:03:07] time of the same amount of time the
[1:03:09] minister's fanta with God to bring you a
[1:03:13] message use
[1:03:14] spend the same amount of time in Perth
[1:03:18] and focus that God would speak to me
[1:03:23] when I get to the else of God what a
[1:03:27] church that is going to be and I say it
[1:03:32] would fit because that is where we're
[1:03:34] going we're going to get to a day when
[1:03:38] the skeptic obnoxious the unbeliever is
[1:03:41] gonna leave us
[1:03:43] you see yesterday we thought that the
[1:03:46] greater position of the message it's
[1:03:48] gonna be from way outside of the message
[1:03:51] today we realize the very core hello the
[1:03:57] very call the central call because God
[1:04:01] is saying to you and i trusting nothing
[1:04:04] but in my word the new testament church
[1:04:12] will not be an organization no sir no
[1:04:18] sometimes than the message we're in
[1:04:20] circles this is my little circle and we
[1:04:23] fellowship with this one and that one
[1:04:25] and that one over there and that one
[1:04:27] don't there and outside of that we don't
[1:04:29] finish with nobody you know brethren i
[1:04:33] don't agree with all men but I respect
[1:04:37] call me for that which God has given to
[1:04:39] them amen and even the man that you
[1:04:43] figured that you know he ain't got much
[1:04:45] to say that God has so anoint him that
[1:04:50] is able to edify the body of Jesus
[1:04:54] Christ because what we need in the
[1:04:57] Church of God today is not a Leawood no
[1:05:00] no no we don't need a preacher with a
[1:05:02] lot of fare a flair we need somebody
[1:05:05] that hears from God amen and if we can
[1:05:09] get somebody that hears from God then
[1:05:11] God is satisfied with what we do Amen
[1:05:16] hallelujah so we go back to the
[1:05:19] scripture first Corinthians chapter 12
[1:05:32] let me just take from verse 1 of 1st
[1:05:35] Corinthians chapter 12 now concerning
[1:05:38] spiritual gifts brethren I would not
[1:05:41] have you ignorant now here is the
[1:05:43] Apostle Paul speaking to the church in
[1:05:45] the first church amen to the Corinthians
[1:05:49] you know that you are Gentiles carried
[1:05:52] away with dumb idols even as you were
[1:05:55] lid where if I give you to understand
[1:05:57] that Norman speak by the Spirit of God
[1:06:00] called Jesus a curse and that no man can
[1:06:03] say that jesus is the lord but by the
[1:06:06] holy ghost in other words it's not just
[1:06:08] saying it out of your mouth but speaking
[1:06:11] by revelation that that's what it really
[1:06:14] means amen
[1:06:15] now there are diversities of gifts by
[1:06:19] the same spirit and there are
[1:06:22] differences of administration but the
[1:06:24] same Lord now brethren let me pause by
[1:06:28] saying this a lot of people think that
[1:06:30] this creature is no no longer applies to
[1:06:34] us they said with with pass this really
[1:06:39] well brethren let me tell you if the
[1:06:42] nine gifts of the Spirit kept that first
[1:06:44] clean back then then we certainly need
[1:06:47] it today amen and there divert and there
[1:06:53] are diversities of administration by the
[1:06:55] same Lord and their diversity ZUP of
[1:06:58] operation but it is the same God which
[1:07:01] work at all in all but the
[1:07:04] administration of the Spirit is given to
[1:07:06] every man to profit withal for by one is
[1:07:09] given the spirit of the word of wisdom
[1:07:11] to another the word of knowledge by the
[1:07:13] same spirit to another faith by the same
[1:07:16] spirit to another gifts of healing by
[1:07:19] the same spirit to another the working
[1:07:21] of miracles to another prophecy how will
[1:07:23] it work to another discerning of spirits
[1:07:26] to another divers kinds of tongues and
[1:07:29] to another the interpretation of tongue
[1:07:30] but all these worketh that one and the
[1:07:35] same cells
[1:07:36] spirit dividing to every man severally
[1:07:39] as he will and I believe that the New
[1:07:43] Testament church will still have the
[1:07:46] nine gifts of the Spirit amen
[1:07:49] I don't believe that that day's pass
[1:07:53] because I don't believe that the days of
[1:07:55] miracles pass I don't believe that the
[1:07:58] days of tongues has passed I don't
[1:08:00] believe that prophecy or interpretation
[1:08:02] is fast I believe we are still in the
[1:08:05] cycle of the New Testament church amen
[1:08:08] because how can we accept no verse 12
[1:08:12] but we don't accept everything that
[1:08:14] comes before that are you there with me
[1:08:16] for as the body is one and has many
[1:08:20] member and all the members of that one
[1:08:23] body being many are one body so also is
[1:08:28] Christ for by once for by one spirit are
[1:08:32] we all baptized into one body whether we
[1:08:37] be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond
[1:08:41] or free and have been all made to drink
[1:08:44] into that one spirit you see the Spirit
[1:08:49] of God therefore and brother Boyd is a
[1:08:52] same spirit of God in me and it's the
[1:08:55] same spirit of god in brother Terrence
[1:08:57] is the same spirit of god in brother
[1:09:00] kern what does that mean it means that
[1:09:04] our actions are the same are you there
[1:09:08] with me because it's the same spirit for
[1:09:14] the body is not one member but many
[1:09:17] members no hear me no here's my body
[1:09:20] with many members now if my hands start
[1:09:24] to take the operation of my feet that
[1:09:27] I'd be walking upside down but my hand
[1:09:31] is a certain work to do and my feet has
[1:09:35] got a sir so that the body is in unison
[1:09:39] operating positionally by the Spirit of
[1:09:43] God are you there with me
[1:09:45] hallelujah
[1:09:47] so you said well somebody said well then
[1:09:49] I believe that God poor is freed on
[1:09:51] everybody so everybody can have the same
[1:09:53] operation no no sir because the Word of
[1:09:58] God is true from Genesis to Revelation
[1:10:01] and God cannot say something in Genesis
[1:10:05] all it as a law and when you come to
[1:10:07] Revelation he changes mine
[1:10:10] no sir you see when Paul comes on the
[1:10:13] scene he said let the women keep silent
[1:10:16] in all the church for it's not permitted
[1:10:19] unto them to speak in other words they
[1:10:21] should not usurp authority over the men
[1:10:25] it was right there because of Genesis
[1:10:30] amen no how could the New Testament
[1:10:33] church be otherwise no because he said
[1:10:38] if the vibe put votes another branch it
[1:10:41] must be like the first Amen and if the
[1:10:47] foot shall say because I'm not the end I
[1:10:50] am NOT of the body
[1:10:53] you know I was just him and do you
[1:10:56] something back home you know sometimes
[1:10:58] people have respect of persons and in
[1:11:02] the church you know it's just normal as
[1:11:04] human being you know somebody's got a
[1:11:06] favorite person and you've got a
[1:11:08] favorite family and you know you love
[1:11:11] this child and him and it's my favorite
[1:11:13] challenge and that child so you know if
[1:11:16] you've got something in the church and
[1:11:17] you know you're gonna give give sir
[1:11:19] so you give a nice big one to this one
[1:11:21] and a little bitty one to that one and
[1:11:25] you know tomorrow Haman is this
[1:11:27] brother's birthday and you're glorifying
[1:11:29] you know you do things and then tomorrow
[1:11:31] there's another one in there or happy
[1:11:34] birthday and so somebody gets offended
[1:11:38] because we are human and so there's some
[1:11:41] things that we are not to do in the
[1:11:44] church because we've got to be sensitive
[1:11:46] that we don't come here to offend one
[1:11:48] another you know human beings will have
[1:11:51] favorites and you might have liked him
[1:11:53] for one movie alone oh but listen that's
[1:11:56] not the place for the church
[1:11:58] you know you know what it is to a child
[1:12:00] when you give your giving gifts to
[1:12:03] children and you give this one and you
[1:12:06] give this one you didn't give that one
[1:12:07] again that one you know this car that
[1:12:09] you put on that one and you'll never
[1:12:13] realize it but that child will take that
[1:12:16] for years and years and years and it
[1:12:19] means a complex and that's all will be
[1:12:21] deficient in some ways because there's
[1:12:24] something is car that you're putting
[1:12:26] that child really the New Testament
[1:12:30] church must be sensitive and being the
[1:12:32] Spirit of God that the things that cause
[1:12:35] offence among people we lay those things
[1:12:38] aside because when we come to the house
[1:12:41] of God they said at the foot of the
[1:12:43] cross
[1:12:44] everything is liver at the foot of the
[1:12:47] cross the same blood that you require is
[1:12:50] the same blood that I require are you
[1:12:53] there we may a man the same affection
[1:12:56] that you need is the same that I need
[1:12:58] you know if when one calls or that I'm
[1:13:00] sicker you know you go to Mauser when
[1:13:04] somebody else's sick you've got to go
[1:13:05] the same two miles are you there with me
[1:13:08] and brethren are Tewa you know the only
[1:13:10] way we can be that we've got to come to
[1:13:14] that place a lord love the body of
[1:13:16] christ screaming you get what I'm saying
[1:13:22] it's not my love Lord love them through
[1:13:26] me that you are not preachers realize
[1:13:29] that you've got a ministry that you are
[1:13:33] not following the leaders of the church
[1:13:34] you've got a ministry and where will
[1:13:37] that minister fall when you come to the
[1:13:40] position that your actions edify the
[1:13:43] body of Christ your actions is pulling
[1:13:48] down on the body of Christ something's
[1:13:51] wrong with your experience love one
[1:13:53] another by this shall all men know that
[1:13:56] you're my disciples because you have
[1:13:59] love one for the other
[1:14:01] hallelujah and in that ministry when the
[1:14:04] word go forth howl if something must
[1:14:06] happen you know
[1:14:10] I remember we had a visiting minister
[1:14:13] Annie preacher real powerful message
[1:14:16] that just energizes the church and at
[1:14:20] the end of his preaching
[1:14:22] you know the people got so anointed on
[1:14:26] the Spirit of God and a brother got so
[1:14:30] anointed he began to speak in tongues
[1:14:33] right there in the congregation and the
[1:14:35] brother dropped the mic and walk away
[1:14:37] from the pulpit and I know he was upset
[1:14:42] because you know they said if there's
[1:14:45] gifted one among you that was we let him
[1:14:47] take a room somewhere brethren I tell
[1:14:50] you this is the oath of God and the
[1:14:54] Spirit of God can't have Liberty in this
[1:14:56] house
[1:14:56] where will the Spirit of God of Liberty
[1:15:00] the wind blow where it lists and no man
[1:15:04] know when it comes or when it goes
[1:15:07] sometimes you feel real anointed
[1:15:10] sometimes you feel an inspiration and
[1:15:14] what are you supposed to do brother tell
[1:15:16] me
[1:15:16] wench that's freed of God and who'll
[1:15:20] yourself know the house of God must have
[1:15:24] Liberty in the Spirit of God and so the
[1:15:32] brother Carboni wants to come back I
[1:15:34] won't have him to come back no I won't I
[1:15:39] won't
[1:15:40] man you had one chance in you blow it
[1:15:42] because that's just the truth because
[1:15:47] brothers let me tell you if there's
[1:15:49] anything that must break the order of
[1:15:51] what you think is the Church of God let
[1:15:53] it be the power of Almighty God right in
[1:15:56] that presence we people are being healed
[1:16:00] people are being delivered you said I
[1:16:03] can't exercise myself then if I can't
[1:16:06] exercise myself in the period of God in
[1:16:08] church where should I do it
[1:16:13] it's not that we've got legalistic we
[1:16:16] just got so starchy hello hello
[1:16:23] and I'll so much form of godliness but
[1:16:27] we deny the power of Almighty God amen
[1:16:33] you know it is that people don't come
[1:16:35] out and they don't lay out and / no more
[1:16:38] because they don't see no need for it
[1:16:42] but you know what I believe brethren you
[1:16:45] know when there's sickness and the else
[1:16:47] of God we've got a responsibility
[1:16:49] because we can drive those demon back to
[1:16:53] the pit of hell I don't care what the
[1:16:56] doctor says and I love my doctor but
[1:17:00] he's not my healer amen I believe we
[1:17:04] need to get real serious about God and
[1:17:06] the things of God hello because brother
[1:17:10] Branham said when the word is restored
[1:17:12] the power is also restored to the church
[1:17:15] if I can tell you hallelujah
[1:17:19] the Revelation 10:1 his revelation 8:1
[1:17:23] the mighty angel come down that's Christ
[1:17:26] coming down there was silence in heaven
[1:17:28] for the space in half an hour
[1:17:30] because he was very stepped down and
[1:17:32] hurt because the word has been flashing
[1:17:34] you if I can tell you that revelation 10
[1:17:38] 7 is revelation 3:14 the angel to the
[1:17:42] church of little seer if I can tell you
[1:17:44] revelation 8 will tell ugliest 10 hate
[1:17:47] to 11 that's a bride in action feeding
[1:17:50] on the Word of God then where is the
[1:17:53] power of God in homage hello brethren
[1:17:57] we've got to become God's Word and that
[1:18:00] was what happen in the book of Acts when
[1:18:04] Peter and them were going to hallelujah
[1:18:06] to the temple of the home of pearl and
[1:18:08] the man beg for harm Peter said look at
[1:18:12] us and he looked as though he's going to
[1:18:15] receive something Peter said silver and
[1:18:17] gold have I none but such as I have I
[1:18:21] give it unto thee in the name of
[1:18:24] Jesus Christ rise up and walk that was
[1:18:27] their contention in Acts chapter 3 by
[1:18:30] what name or by what power
[1:18:34] Peter was and acts 4 I think that says
[1:18:38] whether it's right or wrong for there's
[1:18:42] no other name given am a man on the
[1:18:46] heaven whereby men must be saved but by
[1:18:49] the name of Jesus hallelujah and I still
[1:18:54] believe this powering that name today
[1:18:56] this boy in the name of Jesus to heal
[1:18:59] sickness this Paul in the name of Jesus
[1:19:01] to put marriages this power in the name
[1:19:04] of Jesus to heal sickness hello
[1:19:08] this power in the name of Jesus for
[1:19:11] salvation still to save the vilest of
[1:19:15] sinner do you believe believe us now
[1:19:18] this that is a New Testament church in
[1:19:22] action again hallelujah
[1:19:25] when salvation is no longer preached as
[1:19:30] though nobody can get safe when
[1:19:35] salvation is do you believe brother
[1:19:37] Branham is our prophet then you've got
[1:19:41] the Holy Ghost I don't believe that I
[1:19:44] really don't believe that I believe in
[1:19:47] an experience with God and in the book
[1:19:51] of Acts they had an experience with God
[1:19:54] amen and you wonder why your children
[1:19:57] are not interested you need to first get
[1:20:01] an experience with God and then let them
[1:20:03] get that experience that you've got with
[1:20:05] God because you can't tell them about an
[1:20:08] experience that you've never had
[1:20:11] sometimes we're just reformers you know
[1:20:14] we come up in the message we believe the
[1:20:16] message we walk with the message we
[1:20:18] believe brother Branham is a prophet we
[1:20:19] believe all the courts we study them we
[1:20:22] can put quotes the courts the courts and
[1:20:23] it sounds just right in the circle of
[1:20:26] message people but concern the power of
[1:20:28] God that was back then yesterday there's
[1:20:31] no more power today you know I remember
[1:20:35] some weeks ago
[1:20:37] we had a sister that came to church and
[1:20:40] you know when when she came the first
[1:20:42] time she was there and she was rejoicing
[1:20:44] and you know I didn't know who she was
[1:20:46] my sister telling me she said I know
[1:20:48] that woman she's a Jehovah's Witness I
[1:20:50] said certainly she's not anymore
[1:20:53] because the way she rejoice at the world
[1:20:56] and you know there might be another week
[1:20:59] or so
[1:21:00] she asks for a baptism in the name of
[1:21:01] the Lord Jesus and then I realized she
[1:21:04] had she was Jehovah's Witness she went
[1:21:06] to a trinitarian and somebody she met a
[1:21:08] backslider on the road he was driving a
[1:21:11] taxi a backslider from her church and
[1:21:13] she brought up religion and he set her
[1:21:16] straight and tell her where she ought to
[1:21:18] go for the true experience with God and
[1:21:21] so she left her church and she come to
[1:21:24] church and man she had an experience
[1:21:27] with God we baptize her in water in the
[1:21:29] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so you
[1:21:33] know I went away and I came back and I
[1:21:35] didn't see her and I asked the brother
[1:21:37] said oh she hasn't been in church for
[1:21:38] two weeks I got a number I call her she
[1:21:40] said oh sigh I have two boys and they're
[1:21:44] artistic and you know I can't manage
[1:21:47] them I said sister manatee that's what
[1:21:50] God wants bring them to church bring
[1:21:54] them to church I'll tell you the first
[1:21:57] time she came to church and she was
[1:21:59] paddling with these two little boys you
[1:22:01] know there's a hyperactive going
[1:22:02] everywhere and you know the sisters come
[1:22:04] it's good to have met your people in
[1:22:06] church one take this one that way one
[1:22:09] take the other one let her rejoice and
[1:22:11] Alleluia we will take the trouble while
[1:22:14] you hear the word of God and you know
[1:22:17] that service amen
[1:22:20] they brought them to the altar and my
[1:22:23] heart a little boys the brothers woman
[1:22:25] and they were just fighting to get away
[1:22:27] but we prayed over them the end of that
[1:22:31] week she said man she said they went to
[1:22:33] school and the first time she came back
[1:22:36] they came back from school singing the
[1:22:38] songs that they were teaching them in
[1:22:40] school she could not believe it blue
[1:22:42] Erma
[1:22:50] but we put a challenge we said God going
[1:22:54] take care of them and so another Sunday
[1:22:57] she coming I said where the boys she
[1:23:00] said I'll leave them like I said listen
[1:23:02] when you come to this house carry them
[1:23:04] because the Holy Ghost not done with
[1:23:06] them yet it's not right
[1:23:08] that's the challenge that we take has
[1:23:11] the body of Jesus Christ and watch God
[1:23:13] do it people said well what if you say
[1:23:16] all these things and God don't a
[1:23:17] challenger a challenger the God who I
[1:23:21] serve it keep his word and you know what
[1:23:28] God want he wants somebody that's stupid
[1:23:31] in us to take him at his word I would
[1:23:33] have been fooling I want to be childlike
[1:23:35] enough to take God at His Word he said
[1:23:39] it and that says brother branham's that
[1:23:41] God becomes guilty of his word until he
[1:23:44] brings it to pass and we're watching
[1:23:47] those boys coming to church and they're
[1:23:48] a little bit calmer and a little bit
[1:23:51] calm I said thank you lord thank you
[1:23:54] lord he's still working do you believe
[1:23:57] that this morning the New Testament
[1:24:03] church must be another book of Acts and
[1:24:08] so read the book of Acts and see where
[1:24:10] they were and look where you are and see
[1:24:14] if you've got the feet that they've got
[1:24:16] in the book of Acts because brethren the
[1:24:19] word is taking us back to the same place
[1:24:23] not in words only no but in power and
[1:24:28] demonstration of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:31] when the sick come to the outer to be
[1:24:34] prayed for then the elders come also
[1:24:37] that's what the Bible says when the sick
[1:24:41] comes to the altar to be prayed for the
[1:24:44] elders must come also the elders must
[1:24:48] anoint them with oil and pray for them
[1:24:51] because the Bible said is there any sick
[1:24:53] among you let them call for the elders
[1:24:56] of the
[1:24:57] Church let them anoint them with oil and
[1:24:59] the prayer of faith shall save the sick
[1:25:03] do you believe that that's what the
[1:25:06] Bible says God bless you this morning
[1:25:14] the musicians would come I'd love to
[1:25:23] sing but if I sing you wouldn't like it
[1:25:25] so somebody need to come and sing with
[1:25:26] me is there any sick among you this
[1:25:38] morning
[1:25:38] is there any troubled lives among you
[1:25:41] this morning God is still here amen
[1:25:51] he's got the power that he had 2,000
[1:25:54] years ago where he was in 1947 in 1958
[1:26:01] in 1965 God still got the power today
[1:26:05] and we thank God that we've had a
[1:26:08] prophet that turn us back to the Word of
[1:26:10] God not to theology therefore we don't
[1:26:13] have to understand it all we've got to
[1:26:16] do is to believe God's Word and if we
[1:26:20] believe God's Word then whatsoever we
[1:26:22] ask for believing God will grant it to
[1:26:25] us as we pray this morning hallelujah
[1:26:31] and it would like to be remembered you
[1:26:33] can lift your hand right where you are

[1:26:45] salvation of our soul we thank you Lord
