the lord amen in god worthy of all the praise amen it's a privilege being here among you again one more time certainly appreciate brother dale brother wade amen and just all the saints of god most of all we appreciate the lord jesus christ because in him we live and move and have our being amen if we have a need let's just go before the lord in prayer because he's at prayer answering god hallelujah amen if you want to acknowledge it to the lord you can do it by uplifted hand amen let's just pray lord jesus father you see the hands that are lifted to you lord but most of all lord you see our need lord yes and lord we have different desires lord but let our desires be according to your will father lord you would just touch that area father that we stand in spiritual need or maybe natural need lord and let it all coincide with what you have for us before the foundation of the world and lord we just want to move out of the way lord and let you speak to your creation lord and father help them to be receptive to the word of god for we know that there is power in the word and the word cannot be altered it cannot be changed but it must accomplish what you sent it out for lord so lord we just ask that we be yielded vessels today lord lord and father we'll be vessels of honor lord to house the spirit of the lord jesus christ father we pray to bless this church lord the ministry within lord the shepherd the deacons trustees lord lay members all those who are connected to this ministry father we pray you keep your hand upon us lord and keep us under your atoning blood in the wonderful name of jesus christ we pray church amen amen if you have your bibles uh let's go to luke chapter 8. luke saint luke chapter eight let's start reading that verse five luke chapter eight verse five a saw went out to sow his seed and as he sold some fell by the wayside and it was trodden down and the files of the air devoured it and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was spring as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture and some fell among thorns and they and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it right and others fell on good ground and sprang up and bear fruit a hundred fold and when he had said these things he cried he that have an ear to hear let him hear and his disciples asked him saying what might this parable be and he said unto and he and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god but to others in parables thus seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand now the parable is this the seed is the word of god amen let's go to jeremiah 32 and we want to um read verse 14. jeremiah 32 verse 14 the bible says thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel take these evidences this evidence of the purchase both which is sealed and this evidence which is open put them in earthen vessels that they may continue many days amen may the lord bless you of his word you can have your seats amen by the grace of god today i want to use for a subject the seed of promise the seed of promise you know as we see in the book of luke the soul went out the soul and as he began to sow you know let's just let's just get right into it the sword was sowing the word and as the word went forth it landed on certain kinds of grounds but to make this thing you know kind of a visual i want us to understand that the word it will do what it's supposed to do there's never a problem with the word if you stick exactly with the divine inspiration that was given to us you will get the promise of that seed you get the promise of that word see the word is not altered it can't fail it can't come up short whatever god says in his word will come to pass because god cannot tell a lie hallelujah god cannot tell a lie god cannot fail so when we think of the word of god we ought to think of it as god making his promise but the problem is the ground that the word falls on but even when the ground is messed up the word still tries to come forward hallelujah it fellow it fell on uh grounds among thorns it still came forward hallelujah so there's nothing wrong with the word there's a promise in that word you know it fell by the wayside but it still came forward that's right hallelujah you know the scripture says that they were they they received it with joy hallelujah with the word king but other situations based upon that ground stop the word from coming forward hallelujah in its fullness that's what we're talking about the word of god should come forth in its fullness but you got to be the right kind of ground hallelujah you know a lot of times we you you know it's it's it's funny to me that we have so many churches and so many doctrines and denominations and and everybody say they are christian everybody say they got the truth well why ain't everybody bringing forth this word because there is a manifestation of the seed hallelujah i i i didn't do it today but i like i think i left it in my car but if i was to buy a bag of seeds holly from from from columbia south carolina if i bring let's just say the apples holly if i bring those those seeds of apples up here to lulu georgia hallelujah there's a promise in those seeds there's a life in those seeds all i got to do in lula georgia is find good ground and the promise of that seed even though i bought it in south carolina it'll still come forward in georgia all i need is the right kind of ground because there's nothing wrong with the promise hallelujah and i want you to know hallelujah if you are a child of god and his seed is inside of you life has to come forward amen but the ground has to be prepared hallelujah the ground has to be found worthy hallelujah the word the foolish of the word will never come forward on ground that is not ready the one always the one that always gives me it said it was it was um it was soul and ground and and it was among thorns and the thrones choked it all right oh my people are getting choked out by just their surroundings by just the the thieves they fellowship with hallelujah the people in their family the people in their jobs the people in their schools there's nothing wrong with the words you're hearing in this church it's the grounds and what is the ground we are the ground hallelujah now hallelujah but if the seed of god is inside of us let's just look at this seed amen like i said apples you take pears you take peaches whatever you take it when that seed is planted there is a promise in it there's a promise that the life within it will come forth if it's in good ground but one thing i want you to understand your seed my seed there's an element that we all need and you know you people say all the time brother jesus we got the word we got the word we got the word praise god you know what your word needs to grow hallelujah the only way the seed will come forth is first it must be planted in dirt hallelujah hallelujah your seed has to be planted in dirt my seed has to be planted in dirt hallelujah we all got dirt in our lives [Music] y'all wasn't expecting that worship hallelujah i'm such a good christian you are dirt don't get offended hallelujah let's just look at it naturally i can pull a seed out right now holy i could pull an apple seed out hallelujah and lay it right here on this pulpit and preach the word of god it will never come forward hallelujah we can create atmospheres we can sing we can dance we can shout that season up here it will never come forward we are saying this is holy ground we can say uh uh uh uh songs of rejoicing we can sing amen it's already done that seed will never come forward but if i put it in some dirt i'll take that seed and put it in some dirt that dirt does something to it thank god for the dirt [Music] and you know sometimes we feel so self-righteous because we can hear and we can see hallelujah but you're nothing without the dirt yes hallelujah every seed has to come forth first by being planted in dirt you've never seen a peach tree all its roots sitting on top of the ground know what's holding it together dirt oh my god i wasn't expecting this i'm a christian he's telling me i'm dirty the earth was without form and void it was chaos what was it it was chaos then god spoke his word hallelujah and his word began to make everything come to life in the midst of all that chaos we all got chaos we all got troubles we all got problems but it takes the word of god to make that life come forward hallelujah it's a seed of promise and if i plant that seed the activation of that life coming forward first starts with me being laid in dirt and we know that this flesh is what dirt flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of god but it's this flesh on this side that's housing the spirit hallelujah oh my god but then you go from there hallelujah are you saying you know because you said brothers why are you hitting on this because i want you to see this morning that your sins your troubles your shortcomings that don't mean nothing to god hallelujah god knew hallelujah he was gonna come through dirt first and he still put the seed inside [Applause] god is so strong he's so powerful look what he did god let me and you all of us be born and sin first knowing that the siege was stronger than sin and it would come forth through all the dirt amen hallelujah oh my church think about it when it clicks what god has done for you hallelujah church he let us dance with the devil first that's how sure god is of his promise he let us have the nature of devils first knowing that when you hear the word everything else was gonna begin to be pushed away god is not worried god is not afraid about your issues that's what makes him god he's put inside of you a seed of promise hallelujah he said hell produce i got problems with pornography god is not worried he's like oh brother digs i just like boys god is not worried brother jesus i'm being chased by girls god is not worried he put a seed inside of you [Applause] and it's able hallelujah to come through the dirt [Applause] we up in the country now i hope y'all know what i'm talking about hallelujah if y'all y'all trying to get me some fruit that ain't never been in the dirt that's hybrid i don't want that hallelujah if you can give me a seed that if you give me some fruit that hasn't been in the dirt i'll tell you it ain't got no life in it he ain't got no nourishment in it he'll never be able to bring back life again is made by man but if you give me something hallelujah that spent this time in dark conditions spent this time when he couldn't see his way out but it felt the war for the sun and at a point in time he began to shoot out out of the dirt give me that that's what i want yes sir i want a young person who's come out of sin yes sir i want a church who knows what it's like to come through seeing hallelujah and can appreciate the blood of jesus [Applause] [Music] hallelujah that's what makes you who you are hallelujah think about it when we get to heavens the angels can't sing what you sing [Applause] they can't do this cause they don't know what it means to be delivered they don't know what it means to rejoice in the grace of god they never had to experience dirt [Applause] but we experienced it it made us who we are wow y'all if y'all catch this today the devil is done if you catch this however he fighting you he's done when i was a kid i used to like white watching wrestling holly and one of my favorite moves was the chokeslam put them up there with one arm hallelujah let everybody see what i'm about to do to you i want y'all to put the devil's neck around your hands this morning put them up real high let all these imps let all your problems all your trials and tribulations let you see what it's about to do through the blood of jesus i want everybody to get a problem with a chunk slam the devil needs a chokeslam and when we finish we need to all go whoa like rick flair wow [Applause] y'all don't know a scripture hallelujah look when you go in the bible joseph's brothers they hated him they hated him why because there was gifts in his life he was special in love of the father hallelujah but god let him go through some dirt god let him go through some some jealousy by his own brothers dirk that what was that dirt doing that dirt was putting him in position hallelujah one day his dad came and he gave him a coat of many colors and joe joseph not knowing no better he probably went out there in front of his brothers put that coat on and said y'all look what daddy gave me he probably spit around like rick flair [Music] and that jealousy turned into hatred and that hatred put him right in the will of god because they say you know what we gonna sell him into slavery he needed that dirt because there was a caravan that was gonna take him down to the throne yes sir there was a caravan coming that could take him where he was supposed to be yeah but god wasn't finished with the dirt there was more dirt hallelujah and powerful house he's working mind his business the gift of god everybody see that there's something about him hungry he got some more dirt powerful's wife lie with me joseph she was like nah okay check this out that wasn't just one time she was chasing that man let me tell you something if you're being chased hallelujah god know what it's like hallelujah you're not the only one that's been chased but there's a seed of promise god can bring you out of it [Music] then she lied on them threw more dirt on them then they threw him in the jailhouse more dirt god was just all put it in position thank god for the dirt [Music] thank god for the dirt you know i'm gonna read you something right quick holy something the prophet god said and i i pray it does for you what it did for me hallelujah look you know we talk about troubles and and trials and situations in our life all the different things that that we go through and and we experience you know i'll just paraphrase it holy he said why does he say why does god allows trouble to come he said he takes trouble put a bit in his mouth harnesses it and takes it where it needs to go that's what god does your trouble my trouble your dirt my dirt god get on top of it and god said okay all right now this is what we're gonna do hallelujah we need to get these spirits out of his life so what i got to do is i got to expose it hallelujah and then it rises up what happens when you see dirt you clean it up right that's right hallelujah so that's what god does he lets our troubles and different things come he clean it up why so then we can't experience the promise hallelujah but you take that seed church and that seed with a promise of life inside of it it'll never come through a manifestation except first it's planted in dirt and as i read don't get nervous i'm about to close [Laughter] some of y'all wasn't here last night so y'all don't know what's going on the church you take the scriptures and say that every different one of those seeds were planted in a certain ground a certain kind of dirt hallelujah but that word tried to come forth in his full strength it was the ground and the surroundings that stopped it from coming forward the bible said when jesus went back to nazareth he couldn't do many mighty works there because of the people's unbelief this was the god of glory this wasn't just a prophet this was god himself and unbelief hindered the supernatural that's right i hope you're not one of those people who are still discerning me i wonder where he's going with this heaven oh my god i never see somebody jump and shout and hollering scream get used to it heaven is gonna be full of this heaven is gonna be full of a bunch of streaming radical people brother dece that's just not my nature you better get rid of that nature cause i promise you let's make it real plain i promise you when we get to heaven ain't nobody going to be doing this that's right that's right ain't nobody look if you say it's it's just not my nature i'm calm i'm quiet by nature okay praise god all right you stay that way but let me tell you something when we get to heaven and the glory of god comes in the room now that's that's that's the next part the first part is when we all there in the vestibule of heaven and we're talking about what god did in our lives you tell me what god did for you hallelujah where they say oh you got covered in they know i don't oh you're gonna die but i'm still here

somebody who came out of age when the devil was at his full strength [Applause] when the devil was at his full stream with the devil without his full strength we made it up [Applause] [Music] that's how michael jordan used to look at people as he dunked on that's how mike tyson used to look at people as they knock them out church and that's how we need to look at the evil spirits of this day they're already knocked out because we have a promise of eternal life [Applause] amen peter james john timothy hey y'all guys come here luke come here hey man philly man hey y'all come in hey come here this guy right here he made it out of the ladder to see you when the things i was preaching to y'all about they experienced it hallelujah they saw satan in his fullness the river of euphrates was wide open and look at him he's in heaven oh they gonna start to rejoice [Applause] we made it out of the dirt when the dirt was its richest yes [Applause] [Music] now we testifying hallelujah y'all

wrong it's already done she wrote that song too in church she also wrote a song it'll take a stronger win than this hallelujah she's going to be with the lord now but church that song hallelujah struggle within this let me tell you the inspiration behind that song hallelujah she was in a house in west palm beach and there was a hurricane in miami and the hurricane was so strong he was shaking the house i know she was telling the truth because i've been down there doing a meeting with a hurricane king hurricane dennis his wheels about 150 miles per hour but you know what we still had church yes hallelujah and we prayed the devil hallelujah not come our way but he go another direction so he went out and get when we the hurricane was coming this way up miami to miami to west palm and after we prayed it went up the other side you can't tell me god doesn't ask a prayer our prayers are connected to the seed of promise church and as she was sitting in the house and the weeds and stuff was blowing the house inspiration started to fall on the dirt hallelujah inspiration started to fall if you know the song one of the first lines is strong winds are blowing with an unrelenting force hallelujah church in the midst of our trouble god began to give her inspiration in the midst of a storm god began to give her words of comfort it's going to take a stronger win than this to keep me from my promises it's going to take a stronger win than this to turn me around cause my feet are on solid ground can you imagine holly she also wrote the song little by little holly little by little he gave the victory harley church think about it we're up in heaven and people like her start to testify about what god did in their life hallelujah and we sitting there church how many got a testimony when you started to talk about what god has did for you don't get me started by testifying yes sir please don't get me started i remember one day i went i was i went to shop basketball and i

know if you ever pulled the elephant leg before but it's real heavy and you know i'm walking and pulling it and i said lord you gave me a word that by your stripes i'm healed so all i'm gonna do is repeat that promise so as i walk i said fire stripes i'm healed by a strike some heal about a block into it this leg started to get a little light but i strike some heels fire strike some heals buy stripes i'm healed [Applause] sing it bless it be the name of the lord [Applause] is [Applause] you say that man crazy yes i am but i'm happy like this church hallelujah think about it you know i was saying this in canada last week i said you guys you got to be careful because you got teachers that are teaching so deep they're teaching the emotion at the church and i know some of y'all thinking we don't need emotion if you ain't got no emotion you're dead [Music] that's a direct quote from william branham he said anything without emotion you need to bury it and put it in a cemetery because that means it's not alive hallelujah whether it's real or not is the life you live after you go through that hallelujah material i look i say where the camera wear the camera i walked right up to the camera i said you want me to be quiet in your church i'm sorry don't invite me because i had cancer in my brain yeah they told me i was gonna be a vegetable and i didn't take no chemo i didn't take no radiation i didn't take no pills all i took was isaiah 53 so if you want me to be quiet when we talking about the lord jesus christ don't invite me don't invite me i was created to worship [Applause] think about it ain't gonna be too much longer think about it we didn't fellowship we didn't talk you talking to your sisters from other ages you know i was like girl you made it out like girl god is good harley and you talking everybody talking have a good time with phyllis and we smiling then all of a sudden the doors open up and the light comes in yes sir now you know his presence when his presence come in everything is going to lighten up captain church when his presence comes in there are no more burdens when his presence comes in darkness has to scatter [Applause] hallelujah like can you imagine we in heaven and there's no more sin there's no more uh trouble there's no more acne and pain in the light the glory of god comes in and we're all doing this it's just my nature trust me when the glory of god comes in and you are thankful of what he does you ain't gonna be able to keep your composure you might want to throw that out the window you can better keep your composure when you think about church this would be greater than winning the powerball i know some of y'all probably got tickets in your car [Applause] probably got tickets in your car scratch off what's now i don't gamble but if you got one remember me [Applause] i ain't gonna turn down the blessing hallelujah what you think about it god comes in we ain't gonna be able to just sit there and be like hey praise god hallelujah no we're gonna think about all the promises that he fulfilled all the things god has brought us to church how we were once in dirt hallelujah and then that dirt you know what the dirt did the dirt began to break away hallelujah your shell so the real you could come out hallelujah that's what dirk does dirt hallelujah dries out the shell so the real life inside can come out and as that real seed begins to connect with the warmth of the sun while it's underground while it's underground it's connecting this kiss is it's inner atmosphere now you might say brothers i got troubles i got this don't worry god will give you an opportunity to connect hallelujah and as that seed is connecting with just the warmth of the sun it ain't even in the presence of it yet it's just connected with the warmth of the sun it gives strength hallelujah to come out of the dirt hallelujah and it's being drawn there's a power inside of it that energizes it to push itself out of trouble [Applause] and it doesn't stop until it's head gets out of the dirt but i'm before i go any further i want to say this your dirt my dirt is good dirt that's right good dirt somebody say good dirt we got good dirt because remember there was some dirt that when when the seed was planted it came forth a hundred fold hallelujah so every dirt ain't bad there someday there's good dirt hallelujah that's right amen in order for it to come forth it got to be good dirt you can't plant no garden in red clay that's dirt hallelujah you got to have the right kind of dirt you can't put you can't look to see an apple tree in golf sand it don't have the nourishments in it it's ideal for beauty but you give me real dirt with minerals and different things in it hallelujah that when life sits inside of it that dirt does what it's supposed to do wow hallelujah oh my church but you think about the glory of god come in when it comes in and we're up in heaven you say brothers i just don't feel like singing i just don't i don't feel like worshiping hey you better get on board now you better give god thanks now because you know what when we get to heaven ain't gonna be no more preaching you one of them people say oh just preach me the word look in heaven ain't gonna be no more preaching ain't gonna be no reason to we're gonna be with god we're gonna be standing right there in front of the word and every mystery and everything that we'll need to know we'll be knowing it hallelujah so the only thing we're going to be able to do up there is what worship might as well come aboard now [Applause] hallelujah i don't know about y'all but i think i'm gonna be standing on something i made it in the name of jesus i made it praise is to our god every hallelujah is to our god hallelujah [Music] i don't even know where they go i'll just put it back over there but church you think about it holly that seed has a promise inside of it there's a manifestation of every seed of a life coming out even though you don't see it there's a mystery within the seed see nobody really knows who bride is you don't know we all look like brides but the only way we're gonna know who's who is when that date happens hallelujah and no doubt you're going to see some people that you doubted you're going to see some people hallelujah that you look that you look down on you go see some people that have been called serpent seed you're gonna see oh obama by the way i'm gonna say something you gonna see some people that you thought left the message just because they ain't in your church that don't mean they holding on to the revelation the message is a revelation and to make it even more even more precise the message of the hour is a person hallelujah the message is not books and tapes the message is not cds the message is not a table the message is a body of believers the message is the person i'm the message you're the message [Applause] remember hallelujah he says in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word what happened to it the word became french [Music] hallelujah church if you don't believe it let's just look through the scripture remember in the old testament whenever they wanted to see god's presence it was a pill of fire or something it's a pill of fire by night a pillar cloud by day that was a representation of god they said the ark of the covenant was a reputation of god you know all the things behind the veil was a representation of god hallelujah but you notice hardly they had all these things going with them under that covenant but as the covenant began to change hallelujah y'all notice when jesus was born you never saw the pill of fire again because he was the vilifier you didn't have to see a rainbow you don't have to see none of that why because he was off hallelujah and as soon as he was crucified it appeared again in the book of acts to paul i hope you know your bible hallelujah amen that's what i love about the message it made the bible a new book as far as what we see not the letter of it what we see let's get it twisted it's not a nlv or uuv or lmnop no it's still the same word of god hello but look at all those times you never saw a pill of fire hallelujah as long as jesus was on the earth what no need for relics what no need for faith in those different sources and different things because he was there hallelujah and what once jesus was gone the pillar fire began to appear again the rainbow appeared again why because those things was a reflection they were a manifestation of who he was hallelujah hallelujah all of that was a part of the promise in church if we really we really dive into it we look at these things about the seed of promise when you take when you what's the manifestation of a tadpole a frog we are in a season of change holy what's the manifestation hallelujah of a caterpillar a butterfly it always goes into something else that he could never go back to amen what has god given us what is the potential of heaven what is the potential of the resurrection what is the potential of our body change now let's understand potential hallelujah the prophet of god said holy if you wanted an acorn tree you first start with what a acorn seed he said if you got that seed you potentially have the tree the seed hallelujah is a reflection of what's to come but the manifestation of that seed is the tree hallelujah so what is the potential of having for us what is the potential of the resurrection what is the potential of a body change for us it's the holy ghost when you get the holy ghost you are potentially resurrected hallelujah because it's a promise the prophet of god said it's the earnest what is earnest y'all know what earnest is let's make it real simple for those of you who own your own house before you bought that house they had a thing called earnest money right hallelujah you look at the house house it's beautiful you already got the loan they said but do you have any earnest money we want to see if you mean business you want to see if you really want this house so maybe the house was 200 000 or whatever it was you said they said can you put a thousand up can you put a thousand up just to you know to put on the house almost like a down payment so you willingly put that out because you want the house hold it so the earnest money is a guarantee that you can go forward with the deal as long as you didn't put something down in this house nobody else can write a contract on what's yours oh boy i felt that was in my shoulder now hallelujah oh my church hallelujah think about that once you have the earnest once you put the earnest down no matter whoever no matter whoever wants what you got another contract cannot be accepted until yours is done church the devil can't come and say well they did this they knew that god said no i already got the contract i already got the contract all i see is blood i got the contract all i see is joy and peace i got the contract all i see is divine healing hallelujah i already got to cut say you say no i think they see oh i'm sorry he said oh i'm sick he said no i got the contract fire strike by my shots he won't accept another deal and if somebody you know what you can do if you didn't put money down you got a contract and they accept somebody else's own over yours now you can sue some of y'all just sitting back just going through the motions you need to sue the devil take him to court because i want you to understand if you take the devil to court the judge hallelujah the jury and the prosecutor hallelujah is on your side [Applause] some of y'all sitting back you need to sue the devil he didn't try to take what's yours it's time to take it back yes sir he said brother ain't worthy he he ain't gonna be a little thing i can i can easily get that back they got something called small claims court preach i want it all back hallelujah hallelujah he said the holy ghost is the earnest of your inheritance that's why it's so important not just to be a good church member the seed has a promise of god's life hallelujah what is the earnest of the appleseed apples the earnest of an orange tree on sea oranges holly so what is the earnest hallelujah of a christian man god god status hallelujah oh my church and when we think about the seed and the manifestation of god and how he how it goes into the expression of what god is the expression of what he's done in different things church who who was the expression of john the baptist john's message holly john began to preach repentance and these things and ask john was he the messiah john said no i'm not the expression the expression is among you hallelujah his name was jesus jesus was the expression of john who was the expression of elijah elisha elisha was the expression of elijah hallelujah so amen so everybody don't get nervous listen so since we talked about the promised seed and they're coming forth and the expression of that seed who's the expression of william branham's message it ain't jeffersonville as far as the state that's right it ain't arizona as far as the state it ain't georgia or south carolina as far as the state you ain't got to move to the state that ain't the expression hallelujah the expression of this message is a people it's a person when you look around the message wouldn't even come forth if there was no you it's very clear you look at his commission behold i send elijah no it says behold i seen you what me you sent god the prophet to me yes he did and i heard the voice of god i saw the expression of god i saw the miracles of god you said your brother you went down no i wasn't there physically but i was there when he changed my life [Applause] that's how i witnessed this message i could easily we all could easily take the testimonies of the prophet and the caribou and all these things and talk about all that but people be looking at you like man what you talking about but when you started to tell him what this message did in your life when you start to witness about your change then the message comes alive they can't argue with that that's right hallelujah listen before we go any further oh my church he says god but his predestination see has brought his seed to life and it's pressing itself see coming to light see that's what happened with all of us church think about it i want you to see the seed of promise god would have never let a word come forth if there was not a people to make it live look at how he did it can you agree even if we just take history can you agree with martin luther separated from the catholic church there was a people to follow him there was a people to carry on that inspiration there was a people to show that revelation that the just shall live by faith hallelujah so god got a hold of martin luther and he began to preach his message but the people manifested the people may live the people showed the whole world what martin luther was talking about hallelujah but then god didn't settle god kept unveiling himself and then wesley harley looked at martin luther him he's uh that's all right but y'all still smoking and drinking i believe god is a holy god i'ma still walk by faith but i'm gonna clean my life up and you know what there was a people hallelujah that could make what he was saying come into a full expression there are people who stop smoking stop drinking and begin to live a sanctified life hallelujah that's what them people say don't it don't it don't take all that but you gotta do all that god know your heart god is within me well i agree with that to a certain extent he within you if your vessel clean because the bible says hallelujah god is so holy that the angels are unclean in his presence and they never did nothing wrong and you gonna sit up there with all that stuff going through your mind and all your past and all this god is within me it don't take all that i go back to columbia right quick what what we say what we say you just stop too what we say when somebody's talking nonsense time please you know what time please me right child please like me you lost your ain't no need to even talk about this no more that's like a little girl who ain't never been in the kitchen walking in and trying to tell her mama how to cook all right mama you need to do this mommy ain't never been in the kitchen ain't never did a mama look i was like chad please girl go and play with your child please that's what we need to say to the devil hello you trying to tell us that god is not a holy god that he doesn't want us to be clean living hallelujah when the enemy comes speaking that nonsense you need to tell him child please why you be saying this all this crazy the way you be saying this because if you don't catch anything you're gonna catch my parables then you're gonna start thinking why was each other saying child pleasers she said boy the child plea was so funny he's a chocolate chopper oh yeah holiness holiness yeah you see that you see what i did i connected child please to holiness so you be in the house you tell somebody time please you say you got to be holy man [Applause] hallelujah but look at it he says see come into light and now on top of all that it has overcome what does it mean to be an overcomer look before i get ready to get out of here we think about we just went through a season of easter right we just went through a season where everybody's celebrating the resurrection holly but i appreciate the rising of christ without that we have nothing but can i say that it was more to it than that it was more to it than just god rising hallelujah because in the process of rising he did something for us hallelujah hallelujah when he went down in the grave he took my problems your problems everybody's problems in here and he crucified it hallelujah we always talk about the resurrection but we never talk about when he went to hell [Applause] my god is awesome she go by the church hallelujah when he changed dimensions and he would end up in hell with all our problems on his shoulders and now he's in the garden of hell hallelujah amen and these rounds are garrisons of demons hallelujah and jesus looks around all the demons looking at him because they doubted his power now they looking at him hallelujah and jesus knew he had to get to satan hallelujah but you know you got to get through all this illness before you get to him hallelujah so now jesus in hell surrounded around demons and now he stands up and all the demons are looking at him and jesus makes a step hallelujah and maybe the demon of diabetes he says jesus say sit down the master is here maybe he takes another step and the spirit of alcoholism begins to talk he says shut up the master is here and he takes another step and maybe the demon of depression begins to say so he says i said sit down the master is here every drug every sickness every hurt every pain jesus took control of hell that was before he rose if you're going through something you need to tell satan you ain't got no power i'm gonna drop something on y'all this morning gonna shake your boots we say it all the time right away oh my boy i feel like i'm in hell it's so much hell on the earth well let me tell you something god is controlling hell now hell don't belong to the devil no more when jesus died he went down into hell and he took over hell hallelujah so god is controlling my hell he's controlling your hell he's controlling the hell that would bother any of us satan don't get no credit he went down he took the keys to death hell and the grace [Applause] i can't even die unless it's the will of god [Applause] and all the devils could do is just sit there and okay look some of y'all doing that's all you could do he couldn't say nothing he couldn't react because god came down and took over the house god did a renovation it's still hell but god controlling hell now god tell the devil who he can try who he can't try that's right hallelujah go back and read the book of job he told the devil what he could do he told him who to try and who he couldn't try god is controlling your hell so when you go and do things adjust your attitude [Music] just your attitude first thing we say a lot of times we go through stuff there ain't nothing better to do be careful be careful it could be god doing something hallelujah pharaoh was doing everything he could do to let the people go go back and read it he was doing everything he could do he died let him go later you know god turned his heart a little bit he said y'all ain't going no way probably went back in there and slapped himself what i'm saying what i don't know why i can't let these people go god was controlling him you might not believe it god controlling your boss he can only do what works out for your goods and if that's being a pain to you it's working for your good god trying to give you some temperance some self-control you know you we've always got to stand up and flex who we are something go through you don't know what i'm the bride freak if people look at you like man please try please church and i'd be the first one to say back when i was working full time it was a uh one of my friends on the job he was a hole in his brother and he made me feel real small because this man was so humble they tell him to do something he ain't remembering complain knowing it was wrong he ain't mommy ain't complaining he would he just go and do it they come to me in the name of jesus [Laughter] oh my god you gotta come back and convict me he said real powers let me do the work not you boss man came to me one day and told me he said you know you got the power i got the power to fire you boy you said the wrong thing lord have mercy lord have mercy i said well since you want to be pilot i'm going to be jesus only power you got is what my father gave to you then god told me you're wrong you wrong how you gonna win that man to christ and he was a deacon in the um uh denominational church he throw scriptures out of me i throw him pop pop power throw him back mine come back sharper though they cut golden cut coming back and god told me boy stop all that stuff this message ain't came for you to step on people's heads this message came to show what real grace is so you know what church let's stop flexing on people let's start spiritually flexing on people and let's just live a life before hallelujah i tell his testimony all the time my oldest girl has been married maybe two years three years now something like that but when she was about to get married when she first started dating a young man i was feeling like the fool because i ain't know him you know how we daddy's dude we protected so she's like daddy so and so he want to know about i don't care you can't well he won't know about no bible i don't know him send him to the pastor so they keep on they trying to just not say look i don't like him ain't gonna never like him i'm just being honest they know this we all laugh about it now i'll carry on terrible but then one day in my season of acting crazy god came to me and began to talk to me in my spirit he said look here cause you know what i'm looking at i'm looking at protection young girls don't get upset with your dads all they want is the best for you now now the way we go about it sometimes may be kind of wrong let me let let me rephrase that not counter on wrong but all we want you to know is that we love you and when you leave our house under our headship we don't want your life to go this way we want you to marry somebody that spiritually your life will grow naturally your life will grow okay when you leave daddy hallelujah you and your husband ain't coming back negotiating can we stay with you for about a year till we get our stuff together [Music] hallelujah church so anyway you know everybody all right either way church i uh god came to me began to speak to me in my spirit say look your daughter is 20 years old 20. she i think she's 20 something like that 20 21 something he said she's a grown woman she can go marry this guy without your consent and you not be a part of her life now would you rather let me take control of this you just be a good dad and a friend to her give her some guidance you then already raised her now trust what my word says raise them up in the way they should go and when they get older it won't depart from him yeah that was a rebuke he was rebuking me because i wasn't trusting him i'm trying to do it on my own and she wasn't the problem her husband was the one she was dating was the problem to me now god told me he gave me he gave me a new ministry give me a new ministry i'm gonna get i'm gonna get to i'm gonna get to y'all today this thing was so powerful and god showed me i was like man i should have been operating in this thing by the way this ministry so power you can use it in all kind of situation so it's almost like a new doctrine but it's been around forever god gave me a new ministry it's called the shut your mouth ministry [Laughter] anybody know what i'm talking about that's a real live ministry it can save you from a lot of heartache and pain if you would just shake your mouth and mind your business [Music] y'all know what what we do a lot we talk about people and things that they supposedly going through and all it is is what you heard you ain't never talk to the person about it you're just going off assumptions oh i saw i saw your eyes can lie to you some of us ain't got 20 20 vision [Music] so the best thing to do is just shut your mouth that's the ministry guard gave me a boy i just love that thing love that thing cause dinner ain't up to me it's up to god so you know that did i shut my mouth i loved my daughter like i supposed to i talked with my uh her who he was at the time we fellowship have a good time isn't that then all of a sudden he started coming to me and talking to me and then one day he came to me he said hey i want to marry your daughter he said but i ain't gonna do nothing unless i got your consent i was like oh oh god you're giving me my heart's desire let god do it church i say you know what i say what we want in this days i say look if you get my daughter by god's grace she didn't live pretty good y'all know as messy believers we spoil our kids cause we try to keep them from the world stop that stuff stop them them boys ain't gonna be boys they're gonna be mama's boys them girls ain't gonna be girls they're gonna be rebels stop spoiling these kids let them grow up hallelujah let them teach them responsibility hallelujah and stop marrying these kids off when they're not ready [Music] brother branham said mary young if you ready if you got the holy spirit so he comes to me he says i want your consent he said but you know they always say the father's blessing he said what is the father's blessing he said we don't know we just young men we don't know i said well look my point of view is look if my daughter leaves me and you supposed to marry her you're supposed to take her higher naturally and spiritually her life is not supposed to go backwards if i give you this head ship that's why it's up here that's why i give you this handship it ain't supposed to turn into a shoulder ship or a hip ship or a calf ship or ankleship some of them is a footship it's supposed to stay to a spiritual headship and it's supposed to go higher and higher that's what we daddy's want hallelujah so when i told him i said simple well all the plans you got do them try to do as much as you can hallelujah to be a stable man before you get married because anything you go through when you get married she gonna go through it with you so try to be as stable as you can so you can go through the marriage without all kind of pressures because precious burst pipes so you know what i did i left it alone we all continued fellowship and everything and after we had that talk my daughter came to church she was already going to church but this day she got up after i began to step back she got up after the man preached she was the only one went to the altar rededicated her life back to god and since that point she's never been the same it's a seed of promise the holy ghost is unto you and unto your children amen in church this is what blew me away i was walking out of the church by the way my pastor stopped me and he said you know what god told me to leave them alone i was like oh he told me the same thing so when y'all see things going on in church don't be questioning the pastor god is in control [Music] god is in control you might say i know they doing this i know they did that god is in control it's a seed of promise hallelujah the reason why hallelujah he ain't got you up there doing that because you ain't got the spirit of a pastor if it was me i so and so and so that's why it ain't you hallelujah god give us a promise church and every promise will come to pass and you know what now my son-in-law is we can take the in-law part off now he's like my son hallelujah and what blew me away he knew nothing about this message had about this background that that's why that was about to go off on him he knew nothing about his troop and i ain't telling you girls go out here and get some boy who don't know nothing about god stay with your family this was just my trial i heard my dick say daughter i got a word the boy you hear that that ain't what i said go out there and god let the devil make an example out of you no stay with don't be unequally yoked because i didn't know it but one day at the church he called me he said hey what can i do to get all of brother bruno's messages are they ah glory to god [Applause] he's like my son when he got questions he called and asked me i'm gonna make your daddy's trip out now when i got questions i call him as him i could easily call my daughter but i get hillary respect as the head so i call him hallelujah and sometimes my daughter get mad because we'll be talking too much it's for the church but i love it she told me the other day say why he come home he got to tell me every time he talked to you you go i talked to your daddy today he my dad i know you're my dad that's when god steps in so church let's remember no matter where the seed here is there's a promise inside of it and if the ground is right it will come forward hollywood you can't stop it hallelujah church you notice when the temperature gets right everything starts to change colors hallelujah when the temperature gets right everything starts to change colors hallelujah and as the rain comes and the sun shines the trees start to push out because the atmosphere has changed we are in that season where in this church young people will begin to push out [Applause] hallelujah adults will begin to push [Music] oh my church i give all glory to god because what you see i'm gonna brag on jesus right quick now and you know it's funny to me because you know some people may listen to this or listen to me preach and say he's just a pentecostal preacher he don't know this message and all i got to say to you is try me i know it live by it yeah but the only thing about it is holly i'm no good to you unless i'm me i can't be brother donna brother biscuit hallelujah yeah i got to be brother diggs and y'all know what i know this for a fact none of them can be me [Applause] when god created me he stumped on the mold broke it in half and threw it away there'll never be another you my son got the same name as me but he'll never be me we're here by the grace of god and just know that if you got the seed in you there's a promises and it will come forth as musicians come and i love this quote from the prophet he said when that tree is this big every bustle of fruit is already in it hallelujah oh my god with his yay high yeah every promise is already empty every barrel hollering how much that take to the market is already in it and i said that to you this morning if the seed the gene of god is inside of you every promise that has to be fulfilled by you is already in you hallelujah you don't have to have a special service or a special visitation it's already in you all you got to do is just make sure you're on the right ground hallelujah and i know we have troubles we make mistakes different things happen but church let's just trust god let's just believe god we're in a time now where like i say the fullness of the devil is ranting and raging all you can do is trust god the people of sodom and gomorrah they got more rights than we got hallelujah that's right we are here i almost wanted to preach on prophecy this morning church we're living in fulfillment of prophecy hallelujah before we leave i'm about to close i mean i got i got not made available plastic driving himself you know he was describing a tesla hallelujah and i've been in one it drives itself it stops at the stop sign stops at the red light holds itself in the right lane and when you come out of the restaurant from eating it will pick you up

cars are made of plastic and we go out and look at our cars again most of our cars got what kind of shape eggs we're in that prophecy we're in that vision hallelujah are you watching it's already out

young preachers that we got that that uh can bring the word of god uh we're fixing to have a baptismal service uh immediately after this uh we're gonna have we'll un unhook everything down there i've been having the heaters running so to keep it warm but for those of you that are gonna be baptized i want to read a scripture for it here and then we'll read a scripture there in saint matthew 28 19 jesus said go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you all way even unto the end of the world he gave us a commission to go and baptize but now remember he has a name and on the day of pentecost they asked him said oh my they were pricked in their heart they're like man what is going on when they heard this they were pricked in a heart and they said peter what are you talking about what must we do to be saved peter said you got to have a name but first he said you've got to repent that's right that's what i asked you yesterday all of us that's going to be baptized today please have you repented you said well i'm being re-baptized you know what i repent every day that's right gives you a good conscious god and you know what you believe he he took away your sins then you're sinless then peter said to him repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost shall receive a promise amen there's that seed of promises our brother's been talking about for the promises to whom you yes and to who your children and to them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call so we're heading to the water yes and i always tell them brother diggs
