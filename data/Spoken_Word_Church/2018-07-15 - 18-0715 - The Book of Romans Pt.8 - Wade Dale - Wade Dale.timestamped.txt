[0:00] I'm gonna read it out of them read it
[0:02] out of the textbook we've gone away over
[0:09] though I need to be alone here okay
[0:19] alrighty then I need to be back yeah
[0:23] good to be everybody's back now and
[0:25] we've got everybody over all the flavors
[0:30] are back home now they've been gone when
[0:32] all-star break now all started back so
[0:35] we got a got everybody together
[0:39] no thank you for holding it together
[0:41] while I was gone
[0:42] Bob and the rest of you don't Joe and
[0:50] Glen don't know okay all right let's go
[0:53] rolling for now remember we were talking
[0:56] about we've been in this study of Romans
[1:00] when circumcision in uncircumcision we
[1:03] know we do know for a fact that that
[1:07] doesn't mean anything of your
[1:10] spirituality or anything
[1:11] the the natural form of circle T okay is
[1:18] no bearing at all it was your mom and
[1:20] daddys fault if you would and out same
[1:23] way will they you know they your mama
[1:25] days you guys through the menu
[1:26] circumcised so it really doesn't matter
[1:27] it's the circumcision of the heart we
[1:30] know that it's the excess flesh that we
[1:34] live in something needs to be trimmed
[1:36] right the excess flesh that we live in
[1:39] what needs to be trimmed night and it's
[1:42] not the natural flesh
[1:43] you know it's all spiritual because why
[1:46] is this in Romans 4 we see that now now
[1:52] listen to you make it all sound good or
[1:56] to make it all in continuity back in the
[1:59] Old Testament there could be no
[2:01] circumcision of the heart because Jesus
[2:07] had done there was no Holy Ghost we go
[2:09] inside the person to cut them to cut the
[2:13] foreskin of your flesh and then so god I
[2:19] stand by this because I'm you know we're
[2:21] getting ready to go into the fifth seal
[2:22] and you see that God is a just God he's
[2:27] so just that he gives a group of people
[2:29] eternal life that didn't even want it he
[2:32] blinded their eyes so that we could come
[2:34] in so he had to be just and give them
[2:37] eternal life he had to do that or he
[2:40] would be a respective person they said
[2:42] well I just used you to get to you know
[2:47] the Gentile bride know which he did he
[2:51] blinded them purposely but he said I
[2:54] won't ever forgive them because in the
[2:55] Old Testament good for we see this set
[2:57] over they for him cannot forget a for
[2:59] him I cannot forget Moses cannot forget
[3:02] all these people in the Old Testament
[3:04] because you know what they lived a godly
[3:06] life without the Holy Ghost in their
[3:08] soul now the out of the morning and the
[3:10] anointing will come on they can be
[3:12] biblical people this is well like that
[3:14] you could they could be biblical people
[3:15] with the anointing on but they were just
[3:17] too common regular person when out
[3:19] anointing came off of it Moses could
[3:22] kill an Egyptian David could have
[3:24] relations with a woman named when
[3:26] supposed to write that was the human
[3:29] part but yet David could go into the not
[3:33] even to live here a court of the temple
[3:34] but he could go in the tech once I am
[3:36] circumcised dude
[3:37] so I'm okay and talking to one God got
[3:40] honor that he said okay I can't go any
[3:41] further
[3:42] now monitor what what you've done what
[3:45] do you done though he did an honor even
[3:48] honor
[3:48] Abraham circumcised in themself so much
[3:51] is that he honored Abraham's faith in
[3:54] what God said he honored his faith
[4:00] because watch you chapter four I'm going
[4:03] to read about eight verses and then I'm
[4:07] gonna read it in the in the die Glocke
[4:08] because man the die Glocke really in
[4:10] this part of this scripture brings out a
[4:12] lot to to make it more where you can
[4:15] understand what's going on
[4:17] so romans chapter 4 now if you've got a
[4:19] Scofield Bible it says this is
[4:23] justification by faith Illustrated which
[4:25] it is now see we're still in the seals
[4:27] we're still in justa me any time I hear
[4:29] the word justification I'm in the first
[4:32] seal okay I'm in the first seal because
[4:35] that's the seal to me that's the sealing
[4:37] justifications right right sang it seals
[4:41] a sylph sanctification third seal the
[4:42] seal of the Holy Ghost why go on
[4:44] and then the fourth seal is what God
[4:47] incarnate in human flesh Satan incarnate
[4:49] in human flesh that's what we're going
[4:50] to start with seal number four then seal
[4:53] number five is what grace the greatest
[4:55] grace you can have his dog give eternal
[4:57] life to somebody didn't want same way
[5:00] with us he gave me eternal life does we
[5:02] don't want it we didn't we were boring
[5:06] contrary okay all right so now let's
[5:09] look at this romans chapter 4 why I say
[5:12] once we see to me to me the thunders of
[5:18] once you got on the seal break and it's
[5:20] the seal that on this it's the seal on
[5:22] this scripture is what we need broke I
[5:24] kissed the still over our eyes the
[5:27] Satanists put out we're gonna we're
[5:29] gonna study this in the in this force
[5:32] field a lot in this force field that
[5:34] Satan blinded people's eyes by the
[5:37] billions all they'll do the church ages
[5:39] he blinded their eyes now God winked two
[5:41] thicknesses so they tried to believe
[5:44] they have faith and you can't go past
[5:47] the fake Nazi to see how faith have
[5:49] faith in me alright so we're going to
[5:52] see that though as
[5:53] see the seals progressed up further cuz
[5:57] remember in this fourth seal that's
[5:58] coming to up man it's a lot to go on
[6:01] save this destroyed the Dragons cast out
[6:05] of Satan's cast out of heaven the the
[6:10] Red Dragons test out this guy goes to
[6:14] Israel you and I become guard incarnate
[6:17] Staton is destroyed in our flesh so man
[6:20] at four steals pretty child because they
[6:22] are after taking place on the four seals
[6:23] so we're gone so everything's got a
[6:25] culminated in that for sale same way
[6:27] we'll safe everything's got a culminated
[6:29] in that fourth seal for him also
[6:31] well I seen Abraham though here we see
[6:33] that Abraham the faith of Abraham
[6:35] it wasn't even Hamill circumcised that
[6:38] was a outward sign just like you and I
[6:42] are baptized just like you and I are
[6:43] aware that what we wear and week we try
[6:46] our best at being different we don't
[6:49] want to be different we don't ever walk
[6:53] out in the world say I'm better than you
[6:54] right cause I don't cut my hair no wrong
[6:58] attitude it's just that I was thinking
[7:01] the other day though though let me tell
[7:04] you this sounds country though we are
[7:06] special group of people though we are a
[7:07] step aside group of people just like
[7:09] Israel that's why people hate Israel now
[7:12] because I said whoever blesses Israel
[7:15] I'll bless whoever curses Israel I'll
[7:17] curse and that still goes on today
[7:20] brother rod said already yesterday that
[7:23] the reason that God is not bringing
[7:25] judgment on the United States is because
[7:27] they are a friend of Israel and whoever
[7:30] is a friend of Israel the friend of died
[7:32] being that we have prostitutes on every
[7:34] corner that doesn't matter
[7:36] God said if you'll be good to Israel but
[7:39] now you see us now and the last
[7:42] administration and then this one they're
[7:43] turning well you know come trying to get
[7:45] back over there but anyway it was that
[7:47] separation of well we'll just let them
[7:50] alone and do what they want to do you
[7:52] know and you see how it's going to
[7:54] happen cuz we're going to turn away from
[7:55] Israel I'm guarantee because everybody
[7:57] is and everybody's gonna turn away
[8:00] what's God gonna do he's gonna send two
[8:03] prophets over there the world ain't
[8:05] never seen him before and they want to
[8:08] watch them do miracles like you never
[8:10] saw miracles number for me you and I are
[8:12] not gonna be there to see it we're gonna
[8:14] be out of here because of this faith
[8:16] that we have in the Word of God all
[8:19] right let's get started what shall we
[8:20] say to Romans chapter 4 like I said my
[8:23] iPad crash so we're gonna have to do it
[8:25] the old-fashioned way don't need I put
[8:27] better than hearing it still running no
[8:34] the only the only owner out buttons when
[8:36] you open it what shall we say then now
[8:40] remember we've been how my sermons even
[8:41] uncertainty
[8:42] what shall we save them that Abraham our
[8:45] Father has pertaining to the flag how
[8:48] family cuz remember Abraham according to
[8:51] the flesh has nothing to do with us we
[8:53] are not a descendant of Abraham but we
[8:58] are a descendant of the faith part of
[9:01] Abraham all right
[9:02] Abraham believed God and it was imputed
[9:04] for righteousness that's the same way
[9:06] with you and I listen to me that's the
[9:09] same way that God imputes righteousness
[9:11] to you is the did you believe we're
[9:14] gonna read the right here Paul asked the
[9:17] question what shall we say then that
[9:19] Abraham our Father as pertaining to the
[9:20] flesh hath found for if Abraham were
[9:23] justified by words in other words going
[9:26] behind the building and taking them
[9:27] taking the you know the knife and cut
[9:31] his foreskin off it if he was justified
[9:34] by that than man you can throw away what
[9:36] Christ did okay that's what's Paul
[9:39] trying to tell you can throw away Christ
[9:42] on the cross all you need to do males
[9:45] was gonna be circumcised and then you
[9:48] females according to the Old Testament
[9:49] were circumcised live a male not
[9:52] physically but you were circumcised when
[9:54] you marry and you have a hand your
[9:56] father that all come under certain
[9:58] season in the Old Testament now
[10:00] don't happen now all right you're not
[10:03] saying because your mama say you know
[10:05] I'm saving could you dance they run all
[10:07] right
[10:07] we're Baberaham were justified by works
[10:10] he hath we're born of glory but not
[10:15] before God
[10:15] you can't glory before God that did he
[10:18] listen in the condition we're in now it
[10:23] does it's not that God didn't care about
[10:24] circumcision because you really done you
[10:26] don't care whether you're physically
[10:28] circumcised your client he okay that's
[10:30] what he's saying here but how are you
[10:33] going to glory in something of works but
[10:37] how you going to play sure Abraham to
[10:39] glory at the moment and the Old
[10:41] Testament Abraham could say I am a
[10:45] circumcised person that's what they were
[10:49] getting into with the temple because in
[10:51] Jews man they hung on that circumcision
[10:55] walked in the temple and Timothy where
[10:57] one of them was not circumcised and
[10:59] they're like you're this pile in the
[11:00] temple well see that's what Paul is
[11:02] dealing with right here he's dealing
[11:04] with hey we know Abraham we know that he
[11:07] could show he was a do we know that you
[11:09] have this lineage but Christ has come
[11:13] God has come in the flesh then do away
[11:17] with all that flesh that a man and they
[11:20] go into the heart of the person doesn't
[11:23] either stop him and embrace it he said
[11:26] if you look on a woman to lust after now
[11:27] you've committed okay now in the Old
[11:29] Testament you long as you didn't touch
[11:32] him you can thank in your mind and have
[11:35] intercourse in your mind with them in
[11:37] other words and you know what it wasn't
[11:39] County but when Jesus come he said no no
[11:42] it's the inward man that we're talking
[11:44] about here okay it's - telling you they
[11:48] they really enjoy the winter cool in
[11:50] Oklahoma I'm talking about the the flesh
[11:53] because you know you you take the flesh
[11:56] out of this whole thing
[11:58] your flesh just manifest once on the
[12:01] inside period only it doesn't sin your
[12:06] flesh done saying don't forget about it
[12:08] no where am I trying to beat the flesh
[12:09] up
[12:10] let's go out and get the person inside
[12:12] right and the flesh will follow wherever
[12:17] Abraham were justified by works he hath
[12:21] whereof the glory but not before God the
[12:26] heck do you see what Paul did nothing
[12:27] but not before God
[12:28] hey grab the glory on the earth all the
[12:30] one two hey I'm with you around my
[12:32] circumcised person but gods like I'll
[12:36] accept that for the moment but that's
[12:38] not the whole deal evany when he knew he
[12:41] recognized Abraham's faith because watch
[12:44] for what's that the scripture alright
[12:48] pay for him believe God
[12:50] that's Genesis 3:20 we got you Scofield
[12:54] Bible abraham believed god and it was
[12:58] counted unto him for righteousness
[13:01] I reckoned are imputed are put to his
[13:04] account and what did count that he went
[13:06] die circumcised it was that he believed
[13:10] what God told him to do and he got up
[13:12] and did it and you know what there was
[13:14] no reservation in his heart to do it he
[13:17] just gotta do now to him that worketh is
[13:21] the reward not reckoned of grace but of
[13:26] dead like Auto just number I don't know
[13:31] to you with that he pay the day he did
[13:36] not owe I owe the dead I could not pay
[13:39] the debts on that so now to him that
[13:42] worketh is the reward not reckoned of
[13:45] grace but of debt in other words Abraham
[13:50] could not say and I don't believe
[13:52] Abraham did say alright done at ninety
[13:55] nine years old I went back here in the
[13:57] tent and I circumcised myself I went
[14:00] through all this pain and agony now you
[14:02] owe me something
[14:03] see that's not Abraham that wouldn't
[14:06] have been able him now that might have
[14:07] been a lot of other people that
[14:10] begrudgingly done that because remember
[14:12] Abraham circumcised his whole household
[14:16] and his kids were up
[14:18] you are Ishmael was anyway you
[14:21] understand one thing yeah so that was a
[14:22] little bit grudging maybe but Abraham I
[14:24] don't believe I believe what he believed
[14:26] in God and went done what he done
[14:27] without a dead God you owe me something
[14:30] now Abraham never in Scripture said God
[14:33] you owe me no and that's the way you
[14:36] better not be you know God I will live
[14:39] 40 years I went to church you owe me you
[14:41] don't owe you nothing all right so now
[14:46] see how the scripture is no look but to
[14:50] him that worketh not but what believeth
[14:54] on him that justifieth the ungodly it's
[15:01] not reason to justify love just yeah you
[15:05] don't justify just now you do now
[15:10] because the just and the justifier is
[15:12] the same this is after crisis come this
[15:15] is after we come under this evil
[15:17] anointing we see that we are just as
[15:20] righteous as God is all right now
[15:22] Abraham I don't believe he saw that
[15:24] because it wasn't really up to him that
[15:26] he was just as righteous and God we did
[15:28] he had a little different attitude okay
[15:30] but to him that worketh not but
[15:32] believeth on him that justifieth the
[15:35] ungodly watch , his faith is counted for
[15:40] righteousness not his works but his
[15:45] faith is counted for righteousness we
[15:49] got to believe things that we don't see
[15:52] we got to believe things before they
[15:55] come knowing that they're coming but you
[15:57] still gotta believe you still got
[15:59] ability we've got to believe all this do
[16:02] you believe that it's gonna be actually
[16:04] anyone come yeah not for us yeah but you
[16:08] know what we're part of it we're in the
[16:10] process
[16:14] and it's proved on that for sale if once
[16:17] they had a force field proves the
[16:18] rapture takes place hello just come off
[16:21] the earth alright look now watch verse
[16:26] six even as david also describeth the
[16:29] blessedness of the man unto whom god
[16:32] imputeth righteousness without works
[16:37] alright saying alright you got that
[16:43] saying blessed are they whose iniquities
[16:46] are forgiven and whose sins are covered
[16:52] blessed is the man to whom the Lord will
[16:55] not impute what's impute rechtin sin
[17:01] because look even david under the blood
[17:05] of bulls and goats because look around
[17:07] him whose sins are covered mine and your
[17:10] sins are covered on a daily basis but
[17:13] mine and your sins in the soul are not
[17:15] just covered they're gone but now that
[17:21] when Abraham see this all this proves
[17:22] that they didn't have the new birthing
[17:24] in the attempt in the Old Testament they
[17:25] couldn't get rid of the sin inside the
[17:28] soul
[17:28] there was no burner there was no works
[17:31] there was no circumcision that's what
[17:32] Paul meant there was no circumcision of
[17:35] the heart in the Old Testament it was
[17:40] just a fleshly outward works that God
[17:43] said okay I'll accept that from the
[17:46] moment but remember remember David was a
[17:52] man after God's own heart the end work
[17:56] partner David the flesh partner David
[17:59] was I would have shot him if I'd have
[18:03] been you arriving if I don't live
[18:04] through that battle and found out what
[18:06] he did to my wife and was gonna do to me
[18:08] I shot him if I was in the Old Testament
[18:10] I'd ask for forgiveness in the new
[18:13] like I said why would you write and I
[18:15] made it through that battle and somebody
[18:16] told me that David purposely was gonna
[18:18] have me merged he'd have been identity
[18:20] minute he invented anything I mean
[18:22] really I mean that's the way it was but
[18:24] he wasn't that way we know that because
[18:25] God knew David listen talk knew David
[18:28] was going to do this before the
[18:30] foundation of the world he mutant David
[18:32] was going to do that but he knew that
[18:34] David that struggle of the two people
[18:38] that struggle of the anointing of God
[18:41] being on David because he was a good guy
[18:43] God had already anointed him to be king
[18:45] so he couldn't take that away okay so
[18:50] that part was what saved him really when
[18:52] we know the property come in and spoke
[18:53] Greek same thing with all of us but it
[18:57] was truly what David that David was
[18:59] anointed to be king of Israel and they
[19:01] went unnoticed hopping you know yes yes
[19:08] because an anointing anointings
[19:10] following your spirit anointings don't
[19:13] following your salt if I understand that
[19:17] because anointed ones are black on the
[19:20] soul in the Soul
[19:22] they say it's it's Satan just saying
[19:26] Satan in the soul but anointed by the
[19:28] true Holy Ghost own their spirit
[19:31] I said anointed ones see to me anointed
[19:34] ones was what was in the Old Testament
[19:37] they were anointed ones they weren't
[19:40] bright they were anointed by God but
[19:44] their soul was still where they lost no
[19:47] see you gotta remember this go back to
[19:48] where the new birth he turned a lot of
[19:50] his to different things the new birth
[19:54] and eternal life two different things
[19:55] because the foolish virgin is not going
[19:57] to give you eternal life in their soul
[19:59] they're not going to be born again
[20:00] they're gonna be given eternal life at
[20:04] the white throne judgment Amen all right
[20:08] couple water my name so this is black as
[20:11] it can be just a whoremonger
[20:13] whoremongers but at the end God's going
[20:16] to give them eternal life well it's
[20:18] gotta be the soul it's gonna be the soul
[20:21] because it's the soul that senate that
[20:23] died of this but let's tell them in
[20:24] Barnesville
[20:25] it's that stole that we got to work on
[20:27] the soul of the person we can anoint the
[20:30] spirit we can clean the flesh of we can
[20:32] put all kind of stuff on it okay still
[20:35] black still black on the inside if you
[20:39] so I'm not born again then it's just a
[20:41] dark place is this abuse just alright
[20:44] say it's the dark horse
[20:45] you know it's basic black horse rider
[20:49] not just anoint you but now see when
[20:52] saving Superman towns God Superman came
[20:56] and it was God in human flesh and man
[20:59] when saying the Superman comes when we
[21:01] leave out here when Saint Superman come
[21:03] it will be Satan incarnate in human
[21:05] flesh you don't see that trumps nominee
[21:13] for Supreme Court just evening out he
[21:16] suggests you late yes he come from Notre
[21:20] Dame he was a gesture with freedom
[21:22] yeah so it's getting close folks is
[21:26] getting close
[21:27] it's getting close we got so many dude
[21:31] with so many Catholics I think there's
[21:32] only one Protestant on the Supreme Court
[21:34] now so we'll see you know what let them
[21:39] and let that let that be the way it is
[21:40] because it's nothing to me I can't stop
[21:44] it
[21:44] you came either it's for working around
[21:46] the hands of God you know but to him
[21:50] that worketh not that's what I want you
[21:52] to see that watch Paul Paul is
[21:55] separating the Old Testament from the
[21:57] New Testament he's separating because
[21:59] remember the the great maybe it's not a
[22:04] falling out between Paul and James
[22:06] but in commentaries and then people
[22:10] bring in the scripture they've always
[22:12] said Paul said you're saved by faith
[22:15] James says you saved by works and
[22:18] brother Branham preached works his faith
[22:20] expressed
[22:22] now when that flips it all right
[22:23] together Paul I'm not saying it's all my
[22:25] faith and it doesn't matter what you do
[22:27] James is not saying it's all my works
[22:30] and your soul can be black into the
[22:32] midnight no they meant James is saying
[22:36] if you've got faith this is what you'll
[22:39] do
[22:39] I think Paul st. Paul said if you got
[22:42] faith don't worry about circumcision
[22:44] then worry about being righteous it's
[22:46] the inside man that makes right to
[22:48] righteousness because what st. blessed
[22:51] are they whose iniquities are forgiven
[22:52] and whose sins are covered blessed is
[22:54] the man to whom the Lord will not impute
[22:56] sin now I'm going to read the dialogue
[22:58] and listen to this and if you got your
[23:01] Bible and read one through what I've
[23:03] read what we just read but I'm gonna
[23:05] read you what the die Glocke said this
[23:07] is this is really good
[23:08] why then shall we say of Abraham our
[23:11] forefather according to the flesh for
[23:15] Abraham was justified by works he has a
[23:19] ground of boasting but not before God
[23:23] all right for what say the scripture and
[23:27] abraham believed God and it was
[23:29] accounted to him for righteousness
[23:31] now to him who works the reward is not
[23:36] accounted as a favor but as a debt you
[23:40] see that everybody brings it out a lot
[23:42] clearer right there for to him who does
[23:45] not work but who believed on him who
[23:48] justifies the ungodly his faith is
[23:51] counted for righteousness all right that
[23:54] was verse 5 but to him who does not work
[23:56] but who believed on him was justified
[24:00] the ungodly his faith is come for us to
[24:02] even for 6 even as david also speaks of
[24:06] the blessing this of the man to knew God
[24:09] accounts righteousness apart from works
[24:11] that's the great I said that's the great
[24:15] dissertation that they go through when
[24:17] Paul said it's all by faith and don't
[24:19] worry about the words because you see
[24:21] that in denomination because you know
[24:23] what that's the basic for Baptist
[24:25] doctrine once saved always say
[24:28] regardless smoke cigarette you know do
[24:31] whatever drink the beers and cuts and
[24:33] all it what I got my letter and that's
[24:38] what they're saying and they have a
[24:41] valid point if you just read it like
[24:43] this
[24:44] I believe God save me that's what
[24:46] somebody's I believe God saved me well
[24:49] if you believe it but if God really did
[24:50] accept your faith then the works behind
[24:54] it will account for the faith that you
[24:57] have right verse 7 saying happier they
[25:03] whose iniquities are forgiven and whose
[25:05] sins are covered happy is the man
[25:09] thinking of the Lord went on accounts in
[25:11] alright let's go to verse 9 we've done
[25:15] okay everybody all right verse 9 cometh
[25:21] this blessedness then upon the
[25:23] circumcision only or upon the
[25:28] uncircumcision also for a we study that
[25:31] faith was reckoned to Abraham for
[25:33] righteousness coz watch listen Abraham's
[25:36] faith was reckoned before he was
[25:38] circumcised write in Genesis 12 when God
[25:43] said get up pay for him go to another
[25:45] country hey bruh ham gets up no see God
[25:49] started at County what's gonna count you
[25:51] build up things you know you put money
[25:53] in an account because it build that all
[25:55] right so if the count was building way
[25:58] before he was circumcised because when
[26:01] God called him he was in his seventies
[26:02] when he was circumcised he was in his
[26:05] nineties so he walked all in the air so
[26:07] you know that's why I say you can walk
[26:09] through justification and sanctification
[26:11] but you don't have the circumcision of
[26:13] the heart yet the Holy Ghost is don't
[26:16] think that he'll circumcise our do away
[26:18] with all that mind not only this this
[26:21] inside your soul right so he walked for
[26:24] years and God was accounting it for
[26:28] righteousness right
[26:33] and you know what the little the states
[26:37] along the way like I heard preachers
[26:39] that one time let's just recall Paul is
[26:41] looking back into the Old Testament
[26:44] through the cross with Grace and Sam
[26:48] Abraham was strong in faith never
[26:50] wavered and everything was fine and
[26:52] dandy now you go back over there and
[26:54] read he tried it with his handmade right
[26:59] Dinah smell taste miles down to Greer
[27:03] and give her away twice so you know you
[27:09] look at all that and you go and then
[27:11] Abraham laughs at God you see all that
[27:13] that's just human stuff that's like our
[27:16] all of our human stuff we're going to be
[27:17] really Bible says former things to be
[27:19] passed away all things become new we
[27:21] won't remember all the bad things and
[27:23] all the trials and tribulations that we
[27:25] went through it I don't believe them why
[27:28] would you want to believe why would you
[27:29] want why wouldn't you want to take that
[27:30] with you in eternity no no thank you but
[27:36] it's a five here though we have to fight
[27:37] it here it's got to be fought here when
[27:39] the bottle of one it's gonna be one
[27:40] right here no may want to have it's
[27:43] gonna be one right here that's what
[27:46] we're talking about here the battle then
[27:48] is an inward gopikas watching cometh the
[27:51] blessedness then upon the circumcision
[27:53] only or upon the uncircumcision also
[27:55] what we say that faith was renting to
[27:58] abraham for righteousness
[28:00] how was it directed if he went by
[28:04] certain thing to do when time serves in
[28:07] Newcombe at the flesh when he was in
[28:11] circumcisions are in uncircumcision not
[28:16] looks good look I just explained that I
[28:19] just explained this how was it then
[28:21] reckon when he was in circumcision or in
[28:24] uncertainty
[28:25] look not in circumcision by a
[28:27] circumcision because he walked a long
[28:29] time
[28:30] and uncircumcision right but God
[28:33] reckoned his faith in uncircumcision
[28:36] because remember those who he has
[28:39] justified
[28:40] he is already Lawrence I did not Abraham
[28:45] give him let me let me put this right
[28:48] now glorified body he got changed folks
[28:52] whether it was plank the flesh
[28:54] he went from ninety nine to twenty
[28:57] that's enough for me
[28:59] I wouldn't you couldn't keep me in a ten
[29:03] step Sara was in there I guess
[29:06] so anyway how was he randomly a watch
[29:09] never but look verse eleven here's the
[29:13] here's the whole thing and he received
[29:17] the sign of circumcision they seal
[29:22] grieve not the Holy Spirit of God will
[29:24] by your wife seal those come like the
[29:27] Holy Ghost his circumcision was a seal
[29:32] it got accepted his face what a seal of
[29:37] the righteousness of the faith which he
[29:40] had give me an uncircumcised because
[29:48] really your faith is reckoned to you
[29:52] when you go to the altar and saying God
[29:54] forgive me of my sins you have to have
[29:57] faith that somebody does away with them
[30:00] you got to have faith that you call him
[30:03] whatever you want to call him a lot of
[30:05] God or whatever but somebody has done
[30:07] away with your sin how could you be a
[30:10] Christian you could I mean you know sure
[30:13] you go back to bed and you got the same
[30:14] old nature and all that stuff we know
[30:16] that but God has done something if you
[30:18] never want the justification you should
[30:21] know exactly when you go
[30:22] I know exactly when I went through a man
[30:25] felt good and clean but still had the
[30:28] root of evil I have to go on to
[30:29] sanctification I had to go on to the
[30:31] baptism of all the go find my same with
[30:33] all of us a steal of the righteous is to
[30:36] faith which he had yet being
[30:39] uncircumcised that he might be the
[30:41] father of all them that believe not a
[30:47] father of all then they'd be circumcised
[30:49] he said that he may be the father of all
[30:52] them that believe though they be not
[30:56] circumcised that righteousness might be
[31:00] imputed unto them also let me read this
[31:04] one more and then we'll come in men and
[31:06] the father of circumcision to them who
[31:10] are not of the circumcision only but who
[31:13] also walk in the steps of that faith of
[31:18] our father Abraham which he had being
[31:21] yet uncircumcised because you know what
[31:23] the Jews were doing the Jews were going
[31:25] where Abraham seed where the faith seed
[31:30] of Abraham by natural lineage and he was
[31:33] circumcised then we were circumcised and
[31:35] that's what we depend on right
[31:38] they were boasting now you see what both
[31:41] they got over there you know you know I
[31:43] supposed to do that but they were
[31:44] boasting and they call hopes up in
[31:47] cities okay bring before a listless
[31:50] looking Genesis cuz you don't follow me
[31:52] the script he said bring that thing out
[31:54] here let's look at Genesis chapter 20
[31:56] was he circumcised no he went surfing
[31:59] well didn't he start his journey when
[32:04] God said get up
[32:05] get out of her chair of days and don't
[32:08] go and I'll tell you about and get up
[32:10] and you know and the Jesus is like hmm
[32:13] in other words we've never heard anybody
[32:15] tell us this before but see they later
[32:17] at all owned of Abraham was circumcised
[32:19] and he was the father of our
[32:20] circumcision then we serve besides the
[32:21] world cable god right right the Apollo
[32:25] comes along and says I think it was in
[32:28] people you know the faith
[32:30] talking about was reckoned to Abraham
[32:34] the day he got up and walked out why are
[32:38] you saying that was circumcision because
[32:39] he walked right here look verse 12 and
[32:42] the bottle turns into nibbling on all
[32:43] eternity but it will also walk in the
[32:45] steps of that faith of our father
[32:47] Abraham which he had being yet
[32:49] uncircumcised and boy that's one the
[32:52] Jews hated Paul that's why they killed
[32:54] him all right right because look let's
[33:00] read thirteen and we'll stop right there
[33:01] on 13 and then we'll read them died one
[33:05] for the promise now what is the promise
[33:07] that he should be the heir of the world
[33:11] member what did God tell Abraham forever
[33:14] the sole of your feet goes look up in
[33:17] the stars look down at the sand your
[33:22] seeds going to be counted now he's not
[33:24] talking about natural lineage God is
[33:27] talking about spiritual lineage
[33:29] what faith this whole thing is built on
[33:33] faith and whether you can believe or not
[33:35] right for the promise Calma
[33:40] that he should be the heir of the world
[33:42] comma was not to Abraham or to his seed
[33:46] through the law but through the
[33:53] righteousness of faith everything's got
[33:57] to be based on faith for if they which
[34:03] are of the law be heirs faith is made
[34:06] void in other words look all I got to do
[34:13] is I'm paying circumcised I'm talking to
[34:17] people let's go have a beer
[34:21] let's go get married before down look
[34:23] you see one thing yeah you can't do that
[34:25] though cuz what Paul you know what Paul
[34:27] was watching them Billy they were fair
[34:30] season you know which circumcised week
[34:33] we could link um in the temple you go in
[34:35] and out of God God's blessing us Paolo
[34:39] said your blessing is fixing to be done
[34:42] away with because when Christ came under
[34:47] the law he took away all that and it's
[34:51] gotta be by faith let me read let
[34:52] me go down to 16 and then we'll stop for
[34:56] when for him they which are of the law
[34:59] be haters faith as they boy write the
[35:05] natural lineage of Abraham if it was a
[35:07] natural the the Isaac and the Ishmael
[35:10] and the seven children he had after that
[35:11] they were natural descendants away from
[35:13] him if it was just a natural lineage
[35:15] then faith is made void you have to have
[35:17] no faith you just got to be married into
[35:18] the route mom and dad taught me you got
[35:20] to be born of the wrong under the right
[35:21] mom and a right all right and the
[35:26] promise made of none effect see that
[35:28] promise went totally away if it's all by
[35:30] lineage because they did hold to their
[35:32] lineage and they still helped to it
[35:35] Jesus had to deal with it now polity on
[35:37] the deal with you know because the law
[35:42] worketh wrath for where no law is there
[35:46] is no transgression therefore it is of
[35:49] faith then it might be by grace to the
[35:55] end the promise might be sure to all the
[35:58] seed now I circled that my Bible and I
[36:00] wrote what when I write on it Genesis
[36:04] 1:26 and 27 cuz that's the seed he's
[36:07] talking about Christ not to that only
[36:12] which is of the law but to that also
[36:14] which is of the faith of Abraham who is
[36:18] the father of us all all right let me
[36:20] read now I'm gonna read the dialogue
[36:23] listen to this verse 9 is this
[36:27] blessedness then on the circumcision
[36:29] question mark
[36:31] are also on their uncertainty for we
[36:34] affirm faith was accounted to him for
[36:37] righteousness
[36:38] how then was it accounting when he was
[36:43] in circumcision or uncircumcision not in
[36:46] circumcision but in uncircumcision and
[36:49] he received the symbol of circumcision
[36:53] as a seal of the righteousness of that
[36:57] faith which he had while in
[37:00] uncircumcision which means Abraham
[37:03] didn't just come up with this great
[37:04] faith after he was circumcised that's
[37:06] the whole point
[37:07] hey Graham tell him just because he come
[37:09] up one day and was circumcised maybe I'm
[37:11] just starting believing no that was
[37:13] really the end of his journey next year
[37:16] he had to bleed for the child but
[37:17] brother Graham said he believed the
[37:18] child first day God told it 25 years
[37:20] before that all right well we got to
[37:23] believe we got to believe not in hey if
[37:26] I'm gonna heaven if Hannah was sitting
[37:28] here today fill all the Holy Ghost and
[37:30] in turn there's no faith to that there's
[37:35] no faith to that she said but the faith
[37:39] is I don't see her
[37:40] maybe I'm didn't see the baby but he had
[37:43] counted God had counted his face and
[37:46] that's when the baby comes God is gonna
[37:47] count my faith that she's gonna be
[37:49] getting man and then you think the same
[37:52] same way don't matter 6 for 10 minutes
[37:56] and interact to take place or 10 minutes
[37:58] in the world you put whatever no matter
[38:00] a man in order that he might be the
[38:04] father of all uncircumcised believers
[38:08] this is in bold letters believers that
[38:12] the righteousness may be accounted to
[38:14] them so it's only kind of the believers
[38:16] alright verse 12 and a father of
[38:20] circumcision not only to those who are
[38:23] of circumcision but to those more tread
[38:26] in the footsteps of the faith of our
[38:28] father Abraham in other words
[38:30] anybody circumcised or uncircumcised if
[38:33] you've got the faith of Abraham you're
[38:35] walking in his footsteps which he had an
[38:38] uncertain future verse 13 for the
[38:39] promise to Abraham and to his seed that
[38:43] he should be an inheritor of a world I
[38:46] like that and the world is capital
[38:49] letter inheritor of a world was not
[38:53] through law but through the
[38:55] righteousness of faith for if those of
[38:59] the law are heirs the faith becomes
[39:02] useless and the promise abrogated I have
[39:06] not looked at word up now look at the
[39:08] Hamburg a baby ro G AED abrogated
[39:12] besides come up verse 15 the law works
[39:16] out wrath no where's the law as a
[39:18] destroyer
[39:19] look what happened let's look what how
[39:22] many Old Testament they destroyed people
[39:24] but where law is not there is no
[39:27] transgression all right
[39:29] verse 16 right here who finished right
[39:31] here on account of this it is from faith
[39:35] that it may be according to favor in
[39:39] order that the promise might be sure to
[39:42] all the seed not to that of the law only
[39:46] but to that of the faith of Abraham who
[39:49] is a father of us all to wait for him
[39:55] nothing by flesh he's our father by
[39:59] faith we take the same faith Abraham had
[40:02] and say God I'm just gonna go on what
[40:05] you told me you told me I would have
[40:09] children a lineage and we would have
[40:12] less in another world that's what it is
[40:15] maybe our faith was not of this world 99
[40:22] years old though they were doctor in the
[40:23] country and say I'm gonna have a baby in
[40:25] there you don't know this world
[40:29] and then what's your some worry yeah
[40:31] right so faith is not of this world this
[40:35] world is not built on faith this world
[40:37] is built don't do this don't do that do
[40:39] this don't do that y'all know that
[40:41] everything is reaction in or you know
[40:43] accident reactive nitrogen in a reaction
[40:45] Abram had no reaction everybody's
[40:49] telling things when he was 99 years old
[40:52] but he still said God you said this was
[40:56] gonna happen and I've got this Ishmael
[40:59] and he's wild child and he ain't even my
[41:01] household now remember he went away and
[41:04] you told man I had one in my household
[41:07] and then he comes one day he says okay
[41:09] in for him now I got you in the place
[41:11] you gonna have to do Serifos remember he
[41:12] never told he never told the whole story
[41:14] to Abraham he didn't say you and stare
[41:17] I'm gonna have this baby or he would
[41:18] have never had relations with issue with
[41:20] the Hagar but he said you're gonna have
[41:23] a child then he comes a little bit
[41:26] longer just like in your journey you
[41:28] don't give you all the revelation at one
[41:29] time mm-hmm he gives you pieces it gives
[41:32] you pieces of Revelation that you can
[41:34] handle at the time you need it maybe for
[41:36] him didn't need it at first but now God
[41:39] said okay mmm you and Sarah are gonna
[41:41] have this baby
[41:42] and Abraham been saying yeah sure he
[41:45] laughs but he had enough faith to stand
[41:48] up and go okay I can't do it so what
[41:52] happened was he had to meet God he met
[41:55] God in human flesh the son of man he met
[41:59] Darlene human flesh she told him all the
[42:01] things we've had a man come brother
[42:04] Brown will come what at least on a manly
[42:06] he was a son of man showing us the feast
[42:09] on the man was here what the program
[42:11] desert anything are one thing he
[42:17] did not desert as a human being one
[42:19] thing it was God I got it in here I read
[42:25] that the other day I can't remember
[42:27] they may be able to stay tuned he's
[42:29] talking about another dimension because
[42:30] he will be getting the fifth seal let's
[42:31] go beyond another dimension all right
[42:33] that happened all these other four seals
[42:35] happened in this dimension but still
[42:36] happened in another dimension but he
[42:38] said he said I go in another dimension
[42:42] so that's what a prophet does he does it
[42:44] and he can't do it self thought has to
[42:46] take him in the leg of me all right so
[42:48] let's go that word means unknown I know
[42:52] navigate that one
