[15:04] scriptures turn back where we've been
[15:06] reading in ephesians
[15:08] and then we're reading this morning from
[15:10] romans 8. ephesians 1
[15:12] romans 8.
[15:14] now remember the fellowship meeting this
[15:15] coming weekend
[15:17] and brother forney will be here
[15:18] preaching the lord willing for us
[15:20] and preaching it on the sunday services
[15:22] so keep these in mind
[15:24] and just come and have a good time with
[15:26] us our saturday for the fellowship
[15:28] meeting time
[15:30] and now also
[15:32] if anybody would like to have the
[15:35] cassette tapes
[15:36] downstairs of brother branham's message
[15:39] there's almost a whole complete set
[15:42] of cassettes on the wall down in wade
[15:45] sunday school room because we're
[15:46] planning on taking that down and redoing
[15:49] a little bit painting and fixing up
[15:51] and you can even have if anybody's
[15:53] already spoke for them now you get them
[15:55] but you know but
[15:57] if not if you can even have the racks
[15:59] that you go in
[16:01] because that'll be something you take
[16:02] and put them on your walls and put the
[16:04] tapes in but we need to find out if
[16:07] anybody wants them
[16:08] you know if they don't then we're going
[16:10] to we will try to find somebody else
[16:12] that would like to have them because
[16:14] we're basically using now the you know
[16:16] the mp3s and different things like that
[16:19] in the uh so we're not using those uh
[16:22] cassette tapes anymore so if anybody
[16:25] wants them you can have almost a
[16:27] complete set of rudder rounds tapes it's
[16:29] probably in the neighborhood of
[16:31] lever 1200 of them so you you're welcome
[16:34] to them and the boxes that goes with
[16:36] them
[16:37] as long as you want them so just you
[16:38] know and do it and if somebody wants to
[16:41] taste and somebody else wants the boxes
[16:42] that's all right too it is every which
[16:45] way you do it and they'll if you want
[16:47] them all right so remember that
[16:50] i think that's all the announcements of
[16:52] anything else
[16:54] you have anything we're missing
[16:56] all right okay ephesians 1 and romans 8.
[17:00] our heavenly father our lord our savior
[17:02] our redeemer or all in all and jesus
[17:05] lord is your name
[17:06] thank you for
[17:07] revealing yourself unto us and
[17:09] manifesting yourself among us in your
[17:11] loving grace and we look forward lord as
[17:14] the hour approaches that we're promised
[17:16] in thy word
[17:18] that as the enemy would come in like a
[17:20] flood the spirit of the lord would raise
[17:22] up a standard against him so we're
[17:24] dependent upon you we know within
[17:26] ourselves we are nothing but we know
[17:29] that with you inside of us then behold
[17:31] we
[17:32] are the bride of jesus christ we love
[17:34] you and we thank you and just bless each
[17:36] one be awaiting them today traveling the
[17:38] different ones lord that are not here
[17:40] just bless each one and just come and do
[17:43] as we sing open the eyes of our
[17:45] understanding lord that we may walk in
[17:47] you keep us and keep in and this let us
[17:51] be
[17:52] in you lord because that's what we want
[17:54] you said you sent your word and healed
[17:56] us so we believe you we thank you
[17:59] guide us now in jesus name
[18:01] amen
[18:06] ephesians 1 3
[18:08] blessed be the god and father of our
[18:09] lord jesus christ who hath blessed us
[18:11] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[18:14] places in christ jesus
[18:16] according as he had chosen us in him
[18:18] before the foundation of the world
[18:20] that we should be holding without blame
[18:22] before him in love
[18:23] having predestinated us unto the
[18:26] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[18:28] himself
[18:29] according to the good pleasure of his
[18:31] will
[18:32] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[18:35] wherein he hath made us accepted
[18:37] in the beloved now go back to romans
[18:41] 8
[18:43] verse 14
[18:45] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[18:47] god they are the sons of god for you
[18:49] have not received the spirit of bondage
[18:51] again to fear but you have received the
[18:53] spirit of adoption
[18:55] whereby we cry out by father
[18:59] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[19:00] our spirit that we are the children of
[19:03] god
[19:04] and if children then heirs heirs of god
[19:07] and join ours with christ it so be that
[19:10] we suffer with him that we may be also
[19:12] glorified together for i reckon that the
[19:15] sufferings of this present time are not
[19:16] worthy to be compared with the glory
[19:18] which shall be revealed in us
[19:20] for the earnest expectation of the
[19:22] creature wait us for the manifestation
[19:25] of the sons of god you may be seated
[19:27] lord that is blessing to the reading of
[19:30] the word
[19:35] as we've said we're trying to speak on
[19:38] adoption
[19:42] and trying to bring it out and we'll
[19:44] you know just thinking a while ago the
[19:46] lord willing i want to this coming
[19:47] wednesday in connection with this to to
[19:50] try to speak about the promises in the
[19:52] book that are promised to this end time
[19:56] you know
[19:56] and uh you know it's just kind of on my
[19:59] my mind so you know we'll try to deal
[20:02] with that a little bit the promise is
[20:04] specifically right down to where we're
[20:06] at because there's promises in the bible
[20:08] that cannot be fulfilled
[20:10] until this time
[20:12] this day this hour you know we thank god
[20:15] for that you know like i've told you the
[20:17] prophet has said you know that it's the
[20:19] word that's
[20:21] predestinated eternally so don't worry
[20:23] about it it's going to take place
[20:25] you and i have an option or a choice or
[20:27] whatever to call it to be able to be
[20:29] part of it if we desire it
[20:31] but god has said it and it will come to
[20:34] pass so we'll you know somebody can do
[20:36] it why can't we believe we're there
[20:39] right so we're here at the end time how
[20:41] much longer do you think we got don't
[20:42] worry about it
[20:44] i'm enjoying it where it is and uh
[20:46] everything and we will
[20:48] uh you know have a greater enjoyment
[20:50] later on all right
[20:52] now
[20:54] we were talking this morning about as i
[20:56] said we're on the adoption in three
[20:58] stages
[20:59] and uh
[21:00] you know we were talking about comparing
[21:02] it to the
[21:04] life and and journey of the lord jesus
[21:07] and i put this on kind of a little bit
[21:09] on each one where somebody hears it you
[21:12] know on tape or something they'll want
[21:14] to relate back to the other so bear with
[21:16] me that way kind of a little background
[21:18] but
[21:19] see
[21:20] then the lord jesus had a river jordan a
[21:22] baptismal time a time that the spirit
[21:25] came upon him right we believed those
[21:27] things because the scripture says it and
[21:29] the prophet says it and you know
[21:33] and then he had a time of
[21:35] that was his identification then he had
[21:37] a time of uh
[21:38] coming to authority
[21:41] on the mount of
[21:42] transfiguration not that he didn't have
[21:44] it before then but it was just like a
[21:47] time or a coming to a place or position
[21:50] you know there in the scriptures and
[21:52] then he truly had
[21:54] as we'll read later on to wit the
[21:56] redemption of our body to understand the
[21:58] redemption of our body and truly he had
[22:01] the understanding of what it was going
[22:03] to take place and he was going to make
[22:06] it manifest well then that compares
[22:08] with our journey
[22:10] because as i was saying this morning
[22:12] paul is not telling the people here in
[22:14] romans that we know you know all about
[22:17] the great adoptions and things like that
[22:20] so now all you got to do is just jump up
[22:21] here and take off no no
[22:24] he was just saying listen we're only
[22:27] using as brother branham would do we're
[22:29] only using the uh natural adoption
[22:33] to compare or to
[22:35] you know speak of as to type ever what
[22:38] you would want to use the wording there
[22:40] to see where you and i are at
[22:44] and what we're supposed to be doing and
[22:46] the things and that's why he would say
[22:48] to the romans are in verse 14
[22:51] that and going on into 15 that being the
[22:55] sons of god
[22:58] but yet we received in what the spirit
[23:00] of adoption
[23:02] all right and that's what i believe the
[23:04] new birth is
[23:05] the new birth is the spirit of adoption
[23:07] because you and i have to be brought
[23:09] into the family
[23:11] by the new birth
[23:13] before we can talk about the growth
[23:15] development the the statue of a perfect
[23:18] man the coming to manifestation of the
[23:21] sons and daughters of god and all it has
[23:24] to be through the basis of of the fact
[23:27] that we've got to first be born again
[23:29] all right see then that way then
[23:32] peter would come over and say being born
[23:34] again which means a process of
[23:36] development of going along you know so
[23:39] we we're staying in the scriptures
[23:42] but
[23:42] the prophet we kind of
[23:44] laid on pretty heavily this morning on
[23:47] what brother random said about that
[23:49] we're not getting the people to christ
[23:53] we're getting them to a doctrine or an
[23:55] idea
[23:56] we're getting them to a head knowledge
[23:58] that's what everybody wants in us to
[24:00] have a head knowledge and listen we must
[24:02] have the head knowledge before we can
[24:04] have a revealed holy ghost knowledge all
[24:06] right i'm the very one that hollers
[24:09] about head knowledge we need head
[24:11] knowledge i would to god that everybody
[24:14] in here me you and everybody in the
[24:16] world could quote everything brother
[24:17] around him say it and had a photographic
[24:20] memory to be able to call it back i
[24:22] would to god we had that would be
[24:24] wonderful but still that's not the
[24:27] revelation
[24:28] see
[24:29] that's that's not the revelation
[24:31] nicodemus truly had a head knowledge
[24:34] of the bible as far as what he was in
[24:37] the old testament
[24:38] but then he couldn't understand
[24:42] how that they would have to be a new
[24:45] right i mean that's what he couldn't
[24:47] understand that it was going to be a new
[24:48] testament a new covenant a new uh new
[24:51] kingdom
[24:52] the
[24:53] he thought just like they still thought
[24:55] over the disciples even were still
[24:57] thinking it in in acts 1 8 there and and
[25:00] the ascension of the lord jesus you know
[25:02] and they said will you restore the
[25:03] kingdom to israel now they still thought
[25:05] it was a natural kingdom
[25:07] but he was speaking of a spiritual
[25:09] kingdom of the baptism of the holy ghost
[25:11] that he would have to give his life and
[25:13] then come back to live in us and bring
[25:15] to you and i the tutor
[25:17] and put the tutor inside of us
[25:20] all right now bringing that inside of us
[25:23] see it's not a head knowledge
[25:25] now that doesn't mean everything you've
[25:27] got in your heads revealed
[25:30] i would regard everything i would regard
[25:32] and he'd reveal everything that i have
[25:34] in my human
[25:35] cranium cap i guess you call it brain my
[25:37] computer of the head you know
[25:40] but see he only reveals and don't ask me
[25:43] how he does it i don't know
[25:45] i don't understand that i don't uh
[25:48] understand how that he can quicken one
[25:50] thing to you and not quicken at all and
[25:52] you're studying the whole thing at one
[25:53] time
[25:54] but he's god and he he knows how to
[25:57] raise children right he knows how to
[25:59] reveal his word and when to reveal it
[26:01] all right but see then to be the
[26:03] children of god we must have the new
[26:05] birth not a head knowledge
[26:07] we must have the word revealed to us
[26:10] that is the verb
[26:12] it's the revelation
[26:14] of that me all right and the tutor being
[26:17] on the inside of us
[26:20] then he will only quicken what we bring
[26:23] into him
[26:25] in purity or cleanness or whatever you
[26:28] call it
[26:29] uh you know
[26:30] he can't quicken something that's not
[26:32] right
[26:33] people say oh i had a revelation of the
[26:35] trinity no you didn't have a revelation
[26:38] of the trinity there's no such thing as
[26:40] a trinity and there's no such thing as a
[26:42] revelation of the trinity
[26:44] because if there's a revelation of it
[26:47] that make it real well it's not real no
[26:49] it's a figurative or whatever you call
[26:51] it of some people's imagination
[26:54] that was brought into its way you know
[26:56] way on back all right
[26:58] but now see that the tudor the holy
[27:00] spirit then being
[27:02] the one who's in the inside of us
[27:05] he's waiting on us to br waiting on us
[27:07] to bring him the word the prophet would
[27:09] say
[27:10] to word that he can quicken it to us all
[27:12] right so we must make ourselves
[27:14] available to the word study the word
[27:16] pray read you know how it is you read
[27:20] something you read it again you read it
[27:22] again you know you read something
[27:24] through it four or four five six times
[27:26] all at once
[27:29] well that didn't even hardly seem like
[27:31] that read like that one of the last
[27:33] times i read it see it's called
[27:35] something happened to you that quickened
[27:37] that instead of it just being the
[27:38] natural all right amen see that holy
[27:41] spirit can only quicken
[27:43] the word and you see why it's so
[27:45] important to hear
[27:47] the word
[27:48] i'm talking about not to just hear about
[27:51] it right i'm talking about hearing
[27:53] someone preach the word
[27:56] who can preach it and and let the holy
[27:58] spirit keep it straight
[28:01] because he can't quicken it if it's not
[28:03] if it's not right
[28:05] that's one thing we want to get plain to
[28:07] ourselves you know that that he can't
[28:09] quicken something that's not right well
[28:11] i i got a revelation of you know like
[28:13] the man told wrote around and said i'd
[28:15] like to straighten you out on you on
[28:17] your your your god heads you know he
[28:19] said well we're ready to go now you know
[28:21] come on and and the man started telling
[28:23] him you know and he said well now you
[28:25] know what college did you come from
[28:28] you know he had it all it had this great
[28:30] trinity you know and he said well even
[28:32] the scholars can't understand he said i
[28:34] know that's
[28:35] got to be revealed all right so now
[28:37] that's the main thing that i'm trying to
[28:39] get me and you to look at because the
[28:41] only way we killed this morning the only
[28:43] way you could be born again is by a
[28:46] revelation because that's what the new
[28:48] birth is all right see then the holy
[28:50] spirit be in the spirit the spirit of
[28:53] god the tutor to come and live in us and
[28:55] that is
[28:57] the holy spirit that you you can't make
[28:59] the holy spirit one spirit and the
[29:01] father another spirit
[29:03] so then god gave us
[29:06] the greatest tutor that could ever be
[29:08] what he came to live in us amen
[29:11] now he's wanting us to grow up into his
[29:14] nature
[29:15] in his ways
[29:16] from that that's within us
[29:19] as we eat upon the word now remember
[29:21] sheep only eat sheep food
[29:24] you know some animals you give them uh
[29:26] certain things and and it would kill
[29:28] them you know so you have to feed them
[29:30] according to whatever they they have
[29:32] need of all right
[29:34] now here's what we want to get on to
[29:36] this afternoon
[29:38] why it has been so long
[29:40] in the time of the child training
[29:44] i want to make sure you get this
[29:46] the reason we've been around here 40
[29:48] what is it now just been 2011 somewhere
[29:51] in 44 years or something you know that
[29:54] we've been here since the prophet passed
[29:56] on
[29:57] all right
[29:58] now
[30:01] the reason we've been here
[30:03] i believe now just
[30:05] tell you what i believe you
[30:06] you do i believe that it's
[30:09] on the basis or has been because the
[30:13] people have not
[30:15] been
[30:15] preached
[30:17] the true word of god
[30:20] and you look around the message you can
[30:21] see it we're not talking about organized
[30:23] religion we're not out there in our
[30:24] denomination talking about them and what
[30:26] all they do or what this is or whatever
[30:28] we're talking about the people of this
[30:30] message
[30:31] the most mixed up group of people that
[30:34] seemingly have ever been in the world
[30:35] because a good baptist wouldn't come up
[30:38] with with the doctrines the people of
[30:40] this message come up with and say
[30:41] brother around and taught it polygamies
[30:43] and all the way down and all kind of
[30:46] things all right
[30:47] but see
[30:48] if the new birth is the birth of the
[30:50] word
[30:53] all right now if that's true
[30:55] if the new birth is a birth of the word
[30:58] then the holy spirit could only reveal
[31:01] the word
[31:02] and he can only feed on the word in the
[31:05] growth development process
[31:07] is that sensible
[31:09] see it would have to be the word all
[31:11] right now i see it this way we've had
[31:13] our own ideas we've had our thoughts and
[31:16] things brother adam would say we i i'm
[31:19] sure that we're not getting the people
[31:21] he wouldn't say you're not getting it
[31:23] i'm doing it but you're not getting see
[31:24] he said we're not getting the people to
[31:26] christ
[31:27] all right if we've had ideas of our own
[31:30] see we're not getting the people to
[31:31] christ
[31:33] all right and as human beings we do have
[31:35] those ideas
[31:36] you know most people oh bless god i've
[31:38] got to thus faith the lord will
[31:40] you know i've done the best i can do but
[31:43] still in all of that you wind up having
[31:45] problems as humans trying to express
[31:48] what you're talking about and i don't
[31:51] mind saying that we
[31:53] have tried in our own ways to get the
[31:55] people maybe to come to some place
[31:58] or whatever instead of preaching the
[32:01] word and just letting god bring it forth
[32:06] because it's proven around the world you
[32:08] know the country of the people of the
[32:09] message what they're trying to do and
[32:12] everything so that's enough to be said
[32:15] but as i said this morning you could you
[32:17] could preach the way that it's been
[32:19] preached by most people now for 40
[32:21] something years
[32:22] you could preach that another thousand
[32:24] years it would not bring to pass
[32:27] the things that you and i need
[32:29] all right now i'm just dishonest i'm
[32:31] sorry it's just as honest as i can be
[32:34] because it has not brought any different
[32:37] it's brought divisions and brought other
[32:39] things and brought doctrines and ideas
[32:42] and all instead of the truth now see i
[32:45] believe children are birthed by the word
[32:50] and the building of the body of jesus
[32:52] christ the house of god the statue of a
[32:55] perfect man whatever wording you want to
[32:57] use
[32:58] is
[32:59] will only come to pass by the revealing
[33:02] of the word
[33:04] now not just teaching the letter
[33:08] of the word
[33:09] and i don't mean i can reveal it to you
[33:11] i mean that we must preach it to where
[33:13] god can reveal it
[33:15] but if we don't preach it correctly god
[33:16] can't reveal it is that sensible
[33:19] that shouldn't need a a great big light
[33:22] bug turned on to understand that
[33:24] see
[33:25] and if we get any of our ideas or
[33:27] thoughts involved
[33:29] see then it's not the perfect word being
[33:31] brought because brother rather said a
[33:33] preacher all he does is just
[33:35] breaks the spell satan has over your
[33:37] eyes
[33:38] where he can speak to you
[33:42] that's all i try to do i try to speak to
[33:44] the inward part of you that's why i
[33:46] don't beat on the bodies like most
[33:47] preachers i believe in living right i
[33:50] believe in being christians and and
[33:52] doing right i believe that because we're
[33:54] trying to be christians
[33:56] but yet beating on the bodies will never
[33:58] do anything
[34:01] it will never produce anything if it did
[34:03] produce it it wouldn't be worth anything
[34:07] it would just be a good people you know
[34:10] and i thank god we would love to have a
[34:12] worth full of them you know i mean i
[34:14] could say i didn't drink i didn't do
[34:16] those things but that don't make me any
[34:18] different in god it just makes me
[34:20] different in a natural life
[34:22] but in god it makes no difference
[34:23] because i was a sinner
[34:26] and really i was chief this why because
[34:27] i i didn't do those things what paul to
[34:30] me was talking about when he said i'm
[34:31] cheapest of sinners because paul was
[34:33] very close right
[34:35] but he had the life he had everything he
[34:36] had to work
[34:38] right
[34:39] now he had the word of the day
[34:41] until
[34:44] jesus christ stood forth
[34:46] right
[34:47] paul had the word of the day until jesus
[34:49] christ came on the scene
[34:52] then more was required all right
[34:55] but you see why to me then
[34:58] we're talking about the adoption and
[34:59] stages you see why that it's not
[35:01] developed like it's it it should have
[35:05] because
[35:06] that we've not fed the people the word
[35:10] you know
[35:11] and i i keep saying i say wait because
[35:13] see if there's any thought i have
[35:16] i don't know of it but that's where i
[35:18] preach like i do i i preach i i keep no
[35:21] secrets
[35:23] you know i mean i don't try to
[35:25] play around and get you to hear
[35:27] something play around get you to believe
[35:28] something you know and then let you get
[35:30] a great thing you know because you can
[35:32] go to if you want to know what a
[35:33] preacher believes go ask his
[35:35] congregation
[35:37] most time he ain't gonna tell you
[35:39] but his congregation will tell you well
[35:41] i hope to god that somebody could come
[35:44] in and say something about it and and i
[35:46] remember a certain people one time went
[35:48] to a youth camp and and they were you
[35:50] know talking about you know
[35:52] group that they were discussing the
[35:54] message and and one person looked over
[35:56] and said i know where you go to church
[35:59] well
[36:01] you know
[36:02] i mean thank god
[36:04] you know
[36:05] i mean they were confounding the rest of
[36:07] them over what they knew about it the
[36:08] young child the kids you know they said
[36:11] i know where you go to church well
[36:12] i hope that you can tell the people what
[36:15] i'm believing
[36:16] you know
[36:17] because that's what i'm trying to get it
[36:18] instilled into you
[36:20] you know to where you can do that see
[36:23] see i've tried to feed you on the word
[36:26] and not man's ideas but i i i'm honest i
[36:30] don't mind saying it
[36:32] if that hinders you and offends you i'm
[36:34] sorry
[36:36] we can have just at least a little bit
[36:37] of our own ideas
[36:41] it's anything that's contrary to god
[36:44] it don't matter how big it is or how
[36:45] little it is
[36:47] if we have any thought or concept you
[36:50] know i mean you know i have my thoughts
[36:53] a man years ago most of you know about
[36:56] it he he got on to me about said my
[36:58] daughter wore these blue jean jackets
[37:00] so that's a man's jacket
[37:02] well i come to find out she got buttons
[37:04] on one side for the women's button on
[37:06] the other side of the men and all but
[37:08] you know
[37:09] i just i just couldn't comprehend
[37:13] why he would be saying that about it
[37:14] because i knew that basically most of
[37:17] his people in the church were
[37:19] those stylish stuff you know but anyhow
[37:22] he said well i just don't see how you
[37:24] could be that way
[37:25] well i just told him i said well you
[37:27] know i just
[37:29] maybe i don't know what these things are
[37:31] you know i mean you know i have to ask
[37:33] people about things because i'm not that
[37:36] type of a person to go around
[37:38] and keep up with too much of the world
[37:40] but i didn't even know until then i
[37:42] didn't know women's jackets had the
[37:44] buttons on one side to me and let them
[37:45] on the other one i didn't know it i had
[37:47] to ask somebody to find out because i
[37:49] don't go around looking to them
[37:51] buttons on the wrong side
[37:56] another brother he kept on about and i
[37:57] just finally told him i said listen
[37:58] brother
[38:00] if your son comes up with a silk shirt
[38:02] on i ain't going to make him
[38:04] you know a little bit strong
[38:09] well
[38:10] i really didn't think about it till
[38:11] later you know he wore a lot of silt
[38:13] church
[38:15] so the brother shut up about it but yeah
[38:18] all right but listen
[38:20] i'm just saying that we're human beings
[38:22] and in our human beings we can have our
[38:25] own concept
[38:28] which is not according to the word of
[38:29] god
[38:31] all right and we will hold that concept
[38:33] and thought until god reveals it
[38:36] right
[38:38] you say well i don't oh yes you do so
[38:40] don't worry about it all right
[38:42] now
[38:43] here's my point
[38:46] what i've listened to most people that
[38:48] i've even heard preach about adoption
[38:50] it seems to run into the realm of the
[38:53] bases that when you say
[38:55] manifestation of the sons of god
[38:59] all right
[39:00] now
[39:02] it seemingly always runs to signs and
[39:05] wonders not of you know what i've
[39:07] preached before about this so you you
[39:09] know where i'm going but
[39:11] wait on the others a little
[39:14] and listen there's no one in this
[39:16] building that believes in signs and
[39:17] wonders any more than this man you're
[39:18] looking at
[39:21] i mean
[39:22] i don't say things i tell you that i
[39:24] don't tell things because i don't want
[39:26] it built up on the basis of me
[39:29] i want it built up on the basis of what
[39:31] the prophet has said
[39:33] you know
[39:34] and and doings and i don't go around all
[39:36] the time talking about what's happened
[39:39] among us
[39:40] and i believe in signs and wonders
[39:43] see i i don't see how you could believe
[39:45] the word of god and not believe it
[39:48] i believe the schizophrenic signs shall
[39:49] follow them that believe i believe that
[39:52] you know
[39:53] i mean i believe in a living god a
[39:56] reality of a living god i've seen him
[39:59] i've met him i've talked with him you
[40:01] know he's directly in the word
[40:03] i believe
[40:05] in a reality of a real god
[40:08] not just thoughts of our mind or or some
[40:11] kind of a concept
[40:13] i believe in reality
[40:16] but i also believe in reality
[40:19] you know
[40:21] i believe in the reality of the facts of
[40:23] one thing
[40:25] that we can get in our mind what
[40:27] something has got to be
[40:29] and then we can totally miss
[40:35] come on now
[40:36] did nicodemus miss the bible
[40:43] now was not jesus the word
[40:46] was not he the promise
[40:48] that was to come was not he and he
[40:50] admitted openly
[40:52] you have to be from god because no man
[40:55] can do the things you've done
[40:57] unless it be of god
[40:59] but he missed the reality i i listened
[41:02] to that a lot on the church they were
[41:03] brought around talking about today they
[41:05] say oh if we can get the the bible in
[41:07] the original greek and the you know the
[41:10] things and know exactly what that says
[41:12] he said they knowed it back time
[41:16] and he said knowing it back there they
[41:18] missed jesus when he came
[41:21] so then you can know it to the letter
[41:25] but without the revelation that's a
[41:27] different thing
[41:28] so we can get our ideas set and it's got
[41:30] to be this oh people have said you know
[41:32] if we had if you have what you say you
[41:34] have brotherdale we'd see more signs and
[41:36] wonders well
[41:38] i think we still see a lot of signs and
[41:40] wonders
[41:42] don't worry about that i can stand here
[41:44] the rest of the evening talk about them
[41:45] but i'm just you know just just to go on
[41:48] with the point
[41:49] that we
[41:51] we want to make it some kind of signs
[41:53] and wonders and i believe in signs and
[41:54] wonders
[41:56] it's like brother brown said you know
[41:57] about he said we we have stillborn
[42:00] babies you know we know what they are
[42:02] they're dead
[42:04] i mean the baby comes in the world
[42:06] screaming and hollering
[42:08] you know they don't come forth for the
[42:10] wound and say
[42:12] i'm hungry
[42:13] i just took the dream no it's just
[42:16] screaming it's hard out
[42:18] well the only way i can get something to
[42:20] eat and all i can just keep screaming
[42:23] i believe in manifestation of god
[42:26] i believe in the reality of god
[42:36] no
[42:37] i believe it but now listen
[42:40] i wrote it like this and i got it
[42:42] underlined real good
[42:44] i know and believe
[42:46] that there has always been
[42:49] signs and wonders of the living god
[42:52] now i challenge that on the basis of the
[42:53] entire bible
[42:56] it's always throughout the bible
[42:58] ever worked
[42:59] and throughout the church ages all
[43:01] through each one of them
[43:03] there were signs and wonders in the
[43:05] prophet's ministry there were signs and
[43:06] wonders
[43:10] and then we're gonna get down here die
[43:13] no
[43:13] there's things taking place
[43:16] we just need to open our eyes but if we
[43:18] get set on one narrow path
[43:22] and say well now that's the way it's got
[43:24] to be
[43:26] see
[43:27] probably
[43:28] maybe kaifas or some of them
[43:31] they probably had a good you know their
[43:32] they had a concept of what they was
[43:34] expecting don't you think so
[43:37] and they probably had it figured out
[43:38] that one of these days they believed the
[43:41] messiah was coming right
[43:43] they believed in all that now they had
[43:44] that all in mind and they believed he'd
[43:46] be a prophet and they believe it'd be
[43:48] god in flesh but they had it figured out
[43:50] that well what'll happen one of these
[43:51] days he'll roll up there'll be something
[43:53] like maybe an announcement because they
[43:55] believe that even today the jews believe
[43:58] that elijah is the preceded to come in
[44:00] messiah
[44:01] and i heard today brother ray was
[44:03] talking about sitting making a movie now
[44:04] or have made one or doing something on
[44:06] showing elijah well i hope they do and
[44:09] bring it out like it really is you know
[44:12] but
[44:12] see they
[44:14] they believed that they could have
[44:15] believed certain if it had come their
[44:17] way
[44:19] you following me a carpet rolled out
[44:23] here come right down to the walking
[44:25] right up to coppers you know old
[44:27] catholics you stayed with the truth
[44:29] and here i am to you we'll see hold on
[44:31] everybody believed it
[44:33] but by coming the way it did
[44:36] which was coming exactly the way the
[44:39] bible said it would come you agree yes
[44:41] right all right but by coming the way
[44:44] the bible said it would come they didn't
[44:46] believe it
[44:48] you think they could argue about the
[44:50] ministry of the lord jesus
[44:53] the discernment was there the the signs
[44:56] and wonders was there but could they
[44:58] argue about the prophet's ministry in
[45:00] the last days
[45:02] no
[45:03] they said he was a man of god
[45:05] oh speak highly of it but we just don't
[45:09] believe his
[45:10] doctrine
[45:16] they just didn't believe the word right
[45:18] because don't you believe his doctrine
[45:19] was ordered
[45:22] but you see
[45:24] i believe in this day
[45:28] that there are ministries
[45:30] ministers around the world now i'm just
[45:33] saying it this way the way i write it
[45:35] they have tried to preach
[45:37] the word of god
[45:39] i believe that
[45:40] i believe there's a five-fold ministry
[45:42] in the land around the world
[45:44] i say that meaning it around the world
[45:47] different places around the world you
[45:48] know ministry five full ministry
[45:51] and they've really tried to preach the
[45:53] word
[45:55] i believe that
[45:56] all right
[45:57] but people are looking for
[46:00] signs and wonders
[46:03] and failing to
[46:05] to
[46:06] listen to the revealed word
[46:10] and in doing that
[46:12] it has brought a condition that you know
[46:14] people are
[46:17] blinded to the truth
[46:20] now and i'm going to make another
[46:21] statement which is real strong so listen
[46:24] all right
[46:25] god has allowed
[46:28] this to take place
[46:31] right
[46:33] now
[46:34] he said i didn't
[46:37] god said he sent prophets among you
[46:42] to try it
[46:43] now he's talking about false prophets
[46:46] right
[46:48] come and give him signs and wonders and
[46:49] different things he said they're trying
[46:53] to see whether you'll stay with the
[46:54] truth or not all right
[46:57] see
[46:58] now
[46:59] i'm putting it that way because i'm
[47:00] putting as strong as i can
[47:02] that
[47:03] god has
[47:05] he didn't make it work this way but he
[47:07] has allowed it to take place to try you
[47:10] and i
[47:11] and we've been 40 years and we caught it
[47:13] in the temptation of the wilderness all
[47:15] right to trash
[47:18] he took 40 years back there with the
[47:20] children of israel to try them to prove
[47:22] who was what and who would go into the
[47:25] land and who wasn't
[47:26] right
[47:27] all right
[47:29] see so
[47:31] everything right around and said there's
[47:32] nothing out of cater
[47:35] the united wants our caterer but see
[47:38] people looking for signs and wonders
[47:40] they won't follow the truth
[47:43] right
[47:44] because if somebody got something over
[47:45] here you watch them a young man come in
[47:47] the message you know especially young or
[47:49] something you know they'll do it and and
[47:51] the people maybe he's got a little
[47:53] ministry a little guilt or something
[47:54] people just flock after it just run
[47:56] after it just leave churches and just
[47:59] move and just jump up and go with this
[48:01] dude to follow some kind of a ministry
[48:06] well
[48:07] and i've always said leave them alone
[48:12] and people will say well destroy it
[48:13] brother rather than not just leave him
[48:14] alone
[48:16] because according to the bible
[48:18] you know if that be not of god it'll be
[48:21] made manifest but if it is of god it'll
[48:23] be made manifest right leave it alone
[48:26] my fussing argue about it just let them
[48:28] go home you know
[48:31] let them have their way
[48:32] all
[48:34] but now
[48:35] see people don't want to hear there's
[48:36] something to say right down on the word
[48:39] they had rather fellowship and and
[48:42] believe and listen and go here somebody
[48:44] that
[48:46] can can attract attention or even uh
[48:50] you know build you up emotionally and
[48:52] make you feel good about what they're
[48:54] saying and certain phrases or words that
[48:57] can be said to make you really build up
[48:59] to where you can say oh we've really
[49:01] been to church
[49:04] but what was preaching i don't know but
[49:05] we have a big time
[49:08] well
[49:09] you know
[49:11] now you know i'm not kidding
[49:13] and you know i'm telling it like it is
[49:16] so don't uh you know
[49:18] don't think brother dale's trying to
[49:20] make something no i'm just telling it
[49:21] like it is
[49:23] because you've seen it
[49:27] but see church
[49:31] i
[49:33] believe we need to see more of god
[49:38] all right we have sick among us we have
[49:41] things among right we need more of god i
[49:44] believe in that
[49:46] i want to see these bodies change
[49:49] i want to you know it'd be nice to be
[49:52] young again wouldn't it
[49:54] no
[49:56] but see i know that it has to come by
[49:59] the revealing of the word
[50:01] all right and i know too that we cannot
[50:06] we cannot
[50:09] even the ones that are trying we cannot
[50:12] reveal the word of god
[50:14] nobody can reveal the word of god god is
[50:16] the only revealer of the word
[50:18] the brother said the holy ghost is the
[50:20] only revealer
[50:21] but around can't reveal anything to you
[50:25] he can only tell you what god says
[50:30] jesus himself he said
[50:32] i do nothing until my father shows me
[50:38] all right
[50:39] now
[50:41] see we cannot make manifest
[50:44] the things that people are looking for
[50:46] and you know what god don't want it that
[50:48] way
[50:52] that's more signs and wonders out there
[50:55] and as a whole because there's not that
[50:56] many of us but you know as a whole you
[50:58] go out among organized religions you go
[51:00] out among the the people that you know
[51:02] the pentecostals etc and you go to the
[51:04] good the baptist now and i mean they're
[51:06] just having healing they're having all
[51:07] kind of things happen around the country
[51:14] but you see
[51:16] god is allowing that to take place
[51:20] but you see
[51:22] there's gonna come a day when all miles
[51:24] are gonna be
[51:25] but it'll only be for a short time
[51:28] it won't be no no no worldwide sweeping
[51:30] thing all right
[51:32] see
[51:35] and listen
[51:37] now i wrote this because
[51:39] i know what has happened
[51:42] the
[51:43] i try to explain things
[51:47] and i know people says oh you don't have
[51:48] to explain
[51:51] well
[51:52] it's all right
[51:54] but i try to explain things
[51:57] but in trying to explain things people
[51:59] automatically get the idea that you're
[52:01] trying to
[52:03] explain it away
[52:06] you know
[52:08] no i'm trying to explain it like it is
[52:11] not try to explain it away explain it
[52:13] like it is
[52:16] because see then in doing that to
[52:18] explain it like it is
[52:22] it leaves us
[52:24] you know a problem right
[52:26] because you get the idea you know well
[52:28] that's just a way of explaining it
[52:30] that's why i've been called an
[52:31] intellectual
[52:33] for the basis of where that you know you
[52:34] take that intellectual ability and you
[52:37] just break something down and you just
[52:38] stay on it and just explain it well
[52:42] it's all right
[52:43] if you knew my brain you
[52:45] you would never say that but that's why
[52:48] we get over there it'll be okay
[52:50] because you see my i got problems with
[52:52] mine
[52:53] you'd have to take my word on that
[52:56] intellectualism is not knowing and the
[52:58] ability to learn
[53:00] and to be able to quote
[53:02] that's not intellectualism that's why
[53:04] brother brown said intellectualism is a
[53:06] sign of satan
[53:07] right
[53:08] that's just his words all right
[53:11] but you see
[53:13] we try to explain things away
[53:18] and then blame me for trying to explain
[53:20] things
[53:22] i'm not propping up anything
[53:24] i don't have to profit it
[53:27] i can stand here you've witnessed it
[53:30] we've witnessed the works of god among
[53:31] us
[53:32] that we can stand here and talk this
[53:34] afternoon a good bit on the things god
[53:36] has done among us
[53:38] well that's true
[53:40] it's happened
[53:41] okay
[53:43] now
[53:44] so then it's not something to try to
[53:46] explain that we're really we're not
[53:47] looking for these big things no i'm
[53:48] looking for greater things every day
[53:52] greater and greater
[53:54] brother branham who was it talking about
[53:56] the uh he was talking about one of the
[53:57] churches messengers he said he wouldn't
[53:59] have it till all of his people in his
[54:00] church had the holy ghost it was full of
[54:02] the holy ghost and signs and wonders
[54:04] taking place every service
[54:07] now i'd love that
[54:10] but you can't explain it
[54:13] to people because when you start telling
[54:15] them this the flat truth about it
[54:19] then they start going haywire because
[54:20] they think you're trying to explain it
[54:22] away
[54:23] you know
[54:24] when i tell you say okay you know go to
[54:26] the doctor
[54:28] and let the doctor give you the medicine
[54:31] and we pray it's sanctify the medicine
[54:34] and we have operations and we do things
[54:36] like that well you just don't have the
[54:38] faith
[54:39] you had the faith you'd preach it to
[54:41] tell us not to do these things
[54:44] well
[54:44] i don't have to explain that you've been
[54:46] around most of you long enough to know
[54:48] that
[54:49] you know you can prop up things for a
[54:51] little while
[54:53] but after a while it's going to get you
[54:55] so go ahead you know i believe in a
[54:58] super duper faith yes
[55:01] i believe in a god that is super duper
[55:05] but i believe he also gave us doctors
[55:08] he gave us medicine he gave us things to
[55:10] do
[55:11] and told us things to help herself
[55:14] and i believe we'll do that
[55:16] you don't see me eating pork like crazy
[55:18] when i called pork going around your
[55:20] blood pressure i love it
[55:24] but i stay away from it that way so then
[55:26] i think we would be dissensible
[55:29] let my own christians were to be
[55:31] sensible but now the point of trying to
[55:33] get is what
[55:36] if we look at manifestation
[55:40] and if we can see things take place we
[55:42] think something is taking place
[55:47] that's what i want to do wednesday night
[55:48] to learn with it i want to try to bring
[55:49] the scriptures
[55:51] of
[55:52] like the promises
[55:54] in the book
[55:56] there's a lot of promises in the book
[55:57] that have been fulfilled right
[55:59] but you know there's a lot of promises
[56:01] for this day
[56:02] right now
[56:03] that has never been fulfilled
[56:06] and i'm looking forward to them being
[56:07] fulfilled changed the moment of
[56:09] twinkling
[56:10] right becoming the fullness of the
[56:11] godhead bodily all this happened the
[56:13] other prophet has said and the thing i'm
[56:15] looking forward to that
[56:17] but i know and realize my point is to
[56:20] what
[56:21] we've tried to make manifestation signs
[56:24] and wonders
[56:26] now i want a definition for that
[56:31] i want a definition for manifestation
[56:36] or manifest or manifesting
[56:38] and i want you to bring it in the bible
[56:40] i want you to bring it through the
[56:41] prophet's message
[56:44] where did he ever put signs and wonders
[56:47] ahead of the word
[56:53] signs and wonders were to vindicate the
[56:56] word
[56:58] not signs and wonders first
[57:01] it is the word first
[57:05] these signs shall follow them that
[57:08] believe
[57:11] believe in first signs and wonders
[57:13] followers show me in the message show me
[57:16] in the bible
[57:17] you on internet you're listening to it
[57:19] whatever
[57:21] send me
[57:23] your benefit your definition of
[57:24] manifestation
[57:28] well it's just make manifest just go out
[57:31] and do things where's it at
[57:33] your prophet said they'd never be in
[57:35] hospital
[57:39] he said i did
[57:40] but that don't mean you can't empty half
[57:42] of them
[57:43] or hide for the hospital
[57:45] right
[57:47] see we take those and people have
[57:48] justified them no i'm not doing that
[57:51] but you see i'd like for you to give me
[57:52] your definition of the word manifest our
[57:54] manifestation which is a you know
[57:57] manifested is the past tense and
[57:59] manifestation is the completion of
[58:01] manifest
[58:04] give me your definition of manifest
[58:08] as i said most you know i've preached
[58:09] this to you for so many years you know
[58:11] what i'm going to do and everything but
[58:13] some have not heard it and somebody
[58:15] there's not heard it maybe we need to
[58:16] think about it a little bit too
[58:18] webster says manifest
[58:24] webster now i didn't give you that now
[58:26] i'm not reading this thing we'll read
[58:27] what brother what
[58:29] the strong concordance has but webster
[58:32] says the word manifest means to
[58:35] readily
[58:36] perceived
[58:38] by the eye
[58:41] or the understanding
[58:46] now go on read your web
[58:49] readily perceived by the i
[58:54] or the understanding
[58:59] it means to
[59:01] apparent you
[59:02] know something clear
[59:05] plain
[59:06] you know
[59:08] apparent to the eye in other words
[59:09] something's seen by the eye
[59:11] all right
[59:12] now
[59:13] it means to prove
[59:15] now manifest means to prove
[59:18] put beyond doubt or question
[59:23] it means to reveal
[59:26] it means to disclose
[59:29] it means to make manifest
[59:32] you know
[59:34] all right
[59:35] now that's webster
[59:38] now i'm just playing language now
[59:42] i've done said what i've said about
[59:44] healings and signs and wonders and
[59:45] manifestations so if you go to sleep on
[59:47] me now and don't hear the rest of this
[59:49] and wake up and i'm drawing something
[59:50] else then you got a problem
[59:54] according to
[59:56] the strong's concordance the word
[59:58] manifestation
[1:00:00] which is taken during romans 8 and verse
[1:00:02] 19 we're talking about the manifestation
[1:00:05] of the sons of god
[1:00:07] i gave this to you we'll read them it's
[1:00:09] the number 601 which is strong's
[1:00:11] concordance i mean 602
[1:00:15] i can't pronounce these big words you
[1:00:16] know
[1:00:17] but
[1:00:19] i i surely like to read them
[1:00:22] and that word there means revelation now
[1:00:24] if you're reading it looking on number
[1:00:26] one of your notes the word manifestation
[1:00:29] means revelation
[1:00:31] be revealed
[1:00:33] to lighten
[1:00:35] you know that don't mean
[1:00:38] less weight you know that
[1:00:40] means turn the light on another word
[1:00:42] means manifestation
[1:00:44] means coming
[1:00:48] it means appearing
[1:00:52] at the appearing of our lord jesus
[1:00:53] christ
[1:00:54] at the manifestation of our lord jesus
[1:00:56] christ yeah you understand
[1:01:02] a lie laying anyway behind you bear
[1:01:07] laying something there you know
[1:01:12] making naked
[1:01:16] a disclosure of truth
[1:01:19] instructions
[1:01:21] concerning things before unknown
[1:01:28] used of events by which things are
[1:01:30] states or persons hitherto withdrawn
[1:01:33] from view are made visible to all
[1:01:36] manifestations
[1:01:39] it means appearance
[1:01:43] now
[1:01:46] the next one is the number 53
[1:01:49] 18 which is the word manifest
[1:01:52] you know which these things the
[1:01:54] scriptures say are made manifest right
[1:01:57] like luke 8 and 17 or
[1:02:01] matthew
[1:02:04] 6 and 4 is using the word openly is the
[1:02:06] same as manifest
[1:02:08] and it says in order to reward the
[1:02:10] openly things that are in secret shall
[1:02:12] reward the opening the word openly is
[1:02:14] the same as the word manifest okay
[1:02:16] or to make known
[1:02:18] right
[1:02:19] so then it is coming the word manifest
[1:02:21] is coming make the word manifest openly
[1:02:23] known abroad spread abroad outwardly
[1:02:27] outward appear
[1:02:29] apparent manifest evident known manifest
[1:02:32] in other words to be plainly recognized
[1:02:35] are
[1:02:36] known
[1:02:38] the word manifested
[1:02:42] which is used like mark
[1:02:44] 4 and
[1:02:45] 22.
[1:02:49] it is the word 5319 which is to make
[1:02:52] manifest appear manifest show to be
[1:02:54] manifest show oneself
[1:02:57] manifestly declare manifest
[1:03:00] forth to make manifest or visible are
[1:03:04] known what has been hidden or unknown
[1:03:08] to manifest whether by words or deeds or
[1:03:11] in any other way
[1:03:15] make actual and visible
[1:03:18] realized
[1:03:20] to make actual invisible realized
[1:03:23] to make known by teaching
[1:03:26] to become manifest
[1:03:27] be made known of a person
[1:03:31] to be known of a person who is exposed
[1:03:35] bring into view make manifest to show
[1:03:37] oneself appear to become known to be
[1:03:41] plainly recognized sterling understood
[1:03:44] who and what one is all right
[1:03:48] now
[1:03:50] so then it's not saying
[1:03:52] talking about
[1:03:55] this
[1:03:57] signs and wonders
[1:04:03] if you read that and listening
[1:04:05] it's talking about making known
[1:04:09] bringing something to an understanding
[1:04:13] bringing it in view making it plain
[1:04:16] something that has been previously
[1:04:18] unknown
[1:04:21] brought out to where you can see it or
[1:04:23] understand it or perceive it see all
[1:04:26] right
[1:04:27] and see in doing that now let's go ask
[1:04:29] brother branham brought around what is
[1:04:30] manifestation what are you talking about
[1:04:33] manifest
[1:04:35] all right number four in your notes go
[1:04:36] away jesus 1950 60
[1:04:39] 63 on 11 30 the evening service read all
[1:04:42] the way down just getting what we got on
[1:04:43] the line
[1:04:45] how they rest assured we are sure that
[1:04:48] they are the christ
[1:04:50] how could they because they sing the
[1:04:52] promised word vindicated
[1:04:56] and that's going to deal with signs and
[1:04:58] wonders
[1:04:59] right
[1:05:00] but it's not all of it see
[1:05:03] all right in other words make manifest
[1:05:06] make known
[1:05:08] you know they didn't have a bit of
[1:05:10] trouble about jesus healing the sick
[1:05:11] raising the dead right
[1:05:14] am i true is that right
[1:05:16] but when he began to make known
[1:05:20] the word
[1:05:22] so the living word of promise was made
[1:05:25] alive projected right through that body
[1:05:27] and they know that was god in him
[1:05:29] nicodemus said
[1:05:31] you have to be a man of god
[1:05:38] now watch
[1:05:40] message psylon 64
[1:05:42] 0-12
[1:05:46] he said i'm jesus jesus said i come from
[1:05:48] god and i go to god the same light has
[1:05:51] come to what
[1:05:52] manifest
[1:05:54] now that same light has come to do what
[1:05:56] manifest
[1:05:58] make known to the people
[1:06:00] the promises that he's made for this day
[1:06:03] manifested light of the day the darkness
[1:06:06] is darkened okay
[1:06:08] to make nothing
[1:06:13] all right
[1:06:15] i hold your point till we get where
[1:06:16] we're going but look at the next one
[1:06:17] manifested sons of god
[1:06:19] based in 1965-18 that'll be one of those
[1:06:22] one two three four
[1:06:23] of adoptions we've given you the
[1:06:25] definition
[1:06:26] 1965-18
[1:06:29] with earnest expectation
[1:06:32] the whole creation is waiting for the
[1:06:34] manifestation see
[1:06:36] the manifestation
[1:06:38] what is manifestation
[1:06:41] making known
[1:06:44] okay
[1:06:46] simple
[1:06:47] the world and what have it is under
[1:06:49] they're looking for it all around the
[1:06:51] world they're looking for
[1:06:52] where is these people we've had uh
[1:06:55] we've had the mighty russian wind
[1:06:59] we've had thunders and
[1:07:00] lightnings we've had oil and blood we've
[1:07:03] had all kind of things but we failed to
[1:07:05] hear that little still small voice that
[1:07:07] attracted the prophet
[1:07:09] that wrapped the robe around him and
[1:07:11] walked up and said here my
[1:07:12] lord now
[1:07:15] the next one is christ the mystery of
[1:07:16] god revealed wrote around and said
[1:07:18] webster says
[1:07:20] reveal is to make known
[1:07:23] to make known by something like a
[1:07:25] revelation to make known
[1:07:28] all right now
[1:07:30] well brother dale you're trying to
[1:07:31] explain away all that what we believe
[1:07:34] about the signs and wonders of
[1:07:35] manifestation no sir reno
[1:07:38] i'm trying to give you the definition of
[1:07:40] manifest or manifested or manifestation
[1:07:43] where we get in the right order what
[1:07:46] to make known first
[1:07:52] then signs and wonders follows the
[1:07:54] making known
[1:08:00] the making known the prophet would you
[1:08:02] know in his earlier ministry remember he
[1:08:04] used to let someone else preach
[1:08:06] and then he would just come out and and
[1:08:09] and pray for the sick
[1:08:10] well you know he quit that now you know
[1:08:12] your definition i don't know i never did
[1:08:14] ask him i don't know where anybody else
[1:08:16] ever asked him why he done that but i
[1:08:18] have my definition of why i believe he
[1:08:20] did
[1:08:21] because he didn't like to come out
[1:08:22] behind somebody didn't preach it right
[1:08:26] i mean i know what i would be
[1:08:29] if the man wasn't preaching it exactly
[1:08:31] the way brother branham wanted to preach
[1:08:32] because he was wanting the people built
[1:08:34] on the word
[1:08:36] then he walked out and god performed the
[1:08:39] word
[1:08:41] he didn't he quit letting anybody else
[1:08:43] preach and he preached himself then he
[1:08:45] come
[1:08:46] you know
[1:08:47] and what did he come to do
[1:08:51] to make gnome right
[1:08:53] what did brother brown try to do he
[1:08:54] tried his best to make god known right
[1:08:57] not rude around him right agreed he come
[1:09:00] to make god known now what did jesus
[1:09:01] come to
[1:09:05] he didn't do to make his own stuff known
[1:09:07] as that scripture we got a few written
[1:09:08] down in here you know
[1:09:11] he come to make the father known
[1:09:18] and he stood out there with that word
[1:09:19] and he would bring that word down and
[1:09:22] that great apostle paul would come
[1:09:24] through there and take those old
[1:09:25] testament scriptures and tie them
[1:09:26] together and bring it down and that's
[1:09:28] what got me you know because i knew
[1:09:29] that's what he was doing and then here
[1:09:31] would come brother branham and he'd go
[1:09:32] back there and get them old testament
[1:09:34] scripture he'd tie that together and not
[1:09:36] follow him down it's like following paul
[1:09:38] because i knew that's what paul done
[1:09:40] paul was trying to make god known
[1:09:44] you know what god made paul known
[1:09:47] jesus was trying his best to make the
[1:09:49] father known not his own self
[1:09:52] and as he made the father known the
[1:09:53] father made him known with signs and
[1:09:55] wonders to take place
[1:09:57] you want signs and wonders make the
[1:09:58] father known
[1:10:02] that's all i've ever done and he's made
[1:10:03] it known among us
[1:10:05] with signs and wonders
[1:10:09] okay
[1:10:11] i believe that and i don't have no
[1:10:12] problems i don't i'm just you know
[1:10:17] but the whole world is waiting on the
[1:10:19] manifestation
[1:10:21] of the sons and daughters of god
[1:10:25] now
[1:10:27] anointed ones are having great signs and
[1:10:29] wonders
[1:10:32] i believe that's god doing those things
[1:10:33] don't you
[1:10:34] because
[1:10:35] the devil can't heal
[1:10:40] but the little bride she has one desire
[1:10:43] in her heart
[1:10:44] i have one desire
[1:10:48] and that's to make my father known
[1:10:53] i've tried my best to make my father
[1:10:55] known to you
[1:10:58] 35 years of pastoring
[1:11:01] trying to make god known to you
[1:11:06] not to try to make brother dale known or
[1:11:08] anybody else known
[1:11:10] that's why we stood alone right
[1:11:13] they tried everything in the book to
[1:11:15] bring us into some of these doctrines
[1:11:16] and come around us and things like that
[1:11:18] and just
[1:11:19] i just couldn't go along with it
[1:11:21] yeah
[1:11:22] you know i just couldn't go along with
[1:11:24] it i mean that's just honest and i
[1:11:26] studied them because i'm a person that
[1:11:28] likes to study something out to make
[1:11:30] sure that i know what i'm talking about
[1:11:33] all right
[1:11:34] and that way then see
[1:11:36] it's not trying to make me and you know
[1:11:39] him
[1:11:40] here's where the trouble there's where
[1:11:41] people see like adoption they think the
[1:11:43] father's leaving the scene the sun's
[1:11:46] coming on the scene so then you see it
[1:11:49] and then see that they're trying to
[1:11:51] bring their cells out
[1:11:55] right
[1:11:57] they're wanting yourself seen look what
[1:11:59] i've done
[1:12:02] ain't none of us done nothing
[1:12:06] it's either god or it's not because it
[1:12:08] don't work
[1:12:10] but see
[1:12:11] the word manifest is to make known not
[1:12:14] it's if we make him known he'll make us
[1:12:16] known
[1:12:20] preach the word
[1:12:22] signs will follow the word
[1:12:25] you see you can take gifts and do things
[1:12:28] and have all kind of followings
[1:12:31] me
[1:12:34] i even told the brothers certain brother
[1:12:36] i told him i said
[1:12:38] i said i
[1:12:39] i've got four years ago that the lord
[1:12:42] would speak to me and i said i began to
[1:12:44] see what was taking place
[1:12:46] and i said
[1:12:47] i actually backed away from that
[1:12:49] ministry
[1:12:52] and
[1:12:53] he said you're not done it
[1:12:56] i said no
[1:12:59] i said because if i'd kept pressing it
[1:13:02] would have made it would have brought me
[1:13:03] out and people would begin to look at me
[1:13:05] and i said i don't want people looking
[1:13:07] at me i want the people to look to the
[1:13:08] word and to the god that's in you
[1:13:11] i said i want you to see the word
[1:13:14] and he said you order pressed on i said
[1:13:16] no something
[1:13:19] you because
[1:13:21] i don't want to be something to make me
[1:13:23] known i want god to be made known in you
[1:13:29] that's like your brother said you know
[1:13:30] when the when when the brother told it
[1:13:32] the pillar fire was up here
[1:13:34] you know and then it went down like that
[1:13:36] and started out and the brother you know
[1:13:38] immediately said well it's leaving we've
[1:13:39] got to do something to get it to come
[1:13:41] back and
[1:13:43] if it's leaving you can't get nothing to
[1:13:44] bring it back
[1:13:47] begging him back don't bring god back
[1:13:51] that's why i made my statement and i
[1:13:52] still stand on it i said he left him up
[1:13:54] here because that's what i wanted and he
[1:13:55] went right back there among you
[1:13:57] because his brother never said he went
[1:13:59] out the door
[1:14:01] he said he walked went down and started
[1:14:03] that way and that's exactly what i tried
[1:14:05] to do i tried to preach god from here to
[1:14:08] you
[1:14:11] whether you agree with that or not
[1:14:13] that's nothing to me because that was
[1:14:15] you'd say i wouldn't do that myself
[1:14:17] that's all right that's just brother
[1:14:19] dale i want to see god in your life
[1:14:23] i want to see god in your experience
[1:14:26] i love to hear people's experiences
[1:14:29] the word god would speak to him and tell
[1:14:31] them things i love that you know why
[1:14:33] because
[1:14:34] that's my god you're talking about
[1:14:37] that's my father
[1:14:41] i think that's what it is in the end
[1:14:43] time
[1:14:44] the end time is not to wind up with a
[1:14:45] preacher behind the pulpit that's what
[1:14:47] brother brown said they'd done in the
[1:14:48] early age
[1:14:50] he said they put it all on the preacher
[1:14:54] he said that wound up being the
[1:14:55] nicolaitan because they began to rule
[1:14:57] with those things right
[1:15:00] i want to see god in your life
[1:15:06] because the time keeps going on you know
[1:15:08] hey i brought in probably going to live
[1:15:09] very many more years i ain't talking
[1:15:11] about how many but i'm 71 and
[1:15:14] i'd sure love to see that if we're going
[1:15:16] to be around here 20 more years i don't
[1:15:17] think i'll be preaching i'm just honest
[1:15:19] i'm you know i'm going to believe it
[1:15:21] that way
[1:15:22] but
[1:15:23] i want to see some of you young people
[1:15:25] take over where i'm at
[1:15:27] and go home
[1:15:30] and carry this message on
[1:15:32] we're not told how long we're going to
[1:15:34] be here
[1:15:36] where's the other problem everybody
[1:15:38] thinks of this and that god don't have
[1:15:40] no time
[1:15:42] but he's got a word
[1:15:45] and if his word ain't fulfilled time
[1:15:47] will exist as long as god's word ain't
[1:15:50] fulfilled
[1:15:51] but when it's fulfilled forget about it
[1:15:53] time it over amen there's things in the
[1:15:55] bible we'll get to it wednesday that's
[1:15:57] not come to pass and if it's not come to
[1:15:59] pass then all right
[1:16:02] let's get on with trying to get to the
[1:16:03] bases to understand it
[1:16:07] because it doesn't even say down there
[1:16:08] about the
[1:16:09] where it says about the the uh you know
[1:16:13] to it the redemption of our body look up
[1:16:15] that word to it that means to understand
[1:16:18] right
[1:16:19] to understand the redemption of our body
[1:16:24] you could have everybody in the world
[1:16:26] adopted
[1:16:27] and that still wouldn't be a change
[1:16:31] it would still have to take something
[1:16:33] that god is going to do right there to
[1:16:35] make it change the body
[1:16:38] see
[1:16:39] we can everyone stand here ready
[1:16:42] but there's still something we're not
[1:16:44] running out of something to preach
[1:16:46] we just get to where we can preach
[1:16:51] but you see the word manifest
[1:16:53] is to declare
[1:16:58] or bring out in the open
[1:17:01] things that were hidden
[1:17:04] it means to to be made known by teaching
[1:17:12] you've got the definitions in front of
[1:17:14] you it means to expose it or to bring it
[1:17:17] into view or to thoroughly understand
[1:17:21] that's why i'm not down and out because
[1:17:23] we're here in the year 2011.
[1:17:29] but you know what it was when someone
[1:17:30] was talking about the other day you
[1:17:32] remember when 2000 come around
[1:17:35] everybody was scared to death
[1:17:37] oh we don't know what it's going to be
[1:17:40] someone said you don't have a watchdog
[1:17:41] service i said yeah
[1:17:43] well lots go out at 12 o'clock let's
[1:17:45] bring you a flight slot
[1:17:47] make sure your gas tank is full
[1:17:50] if you're doubting all of it just make
[1:17:51] sure you got a full tank of gas and
[1:17:53] that's a sensible thing to do anyway on
[1:17:55] a watch night service
[1:17:58] bring you a flashlight
[1:18:01] because you think the world's going to
[1:18:02] end because the lights go out
[1:18:06] no
[1:18:08] but you see it's just
[1:18:11] god's just letting it roll
[1:18:15] the longer he marched with the children
[1:18:17] of israel out there around that mountain
[1:18:18] something
[1:18:21] the more people died off
[1:18:24] right
[1:18:25] the old fighters died off
[1:18:28] there's only two
[1:18:30] of the original old fighters
[1:18:32] joshua and caleb
[1:18:35] now there's a group there that was 20
[1:18:36] years old when they come
[1:18:38] out they'd never been circumcised
[1:18:42] go
[1:18:44] round and round the land for 40 years
[1:18:47] but before they could go into the
[1:18:48] promised land they had to hold it
[1:18:51] and they had to have a circumcision and
[1:18:54] those that was born in the way
[1:18:56] because they didn't circumcise them no
[1:18:57] more after they left egypt rich obama
[1:19:00] so they had a stopping sign and you know
[1:19:03] time to stop a dispensation
[1:19:06] of circumcision
[1:19:09] a time that they had to wait until
[1:19:11] everything was right
[1:19:16] but you see church
[1:19:19] if we make him known he will make us
[1:19:22] known
[1:19:26] then read the rest of the quotes that i
[1:19:28] gave to you about people will come to a
[1:19:30] place that they'll speak the word
[1:19:32] and it'll create i believe that
[1:19:35] but it's like i told him when i first
[1:19:36] come in the message everybody then back
[1:19:38] in the 60s or 67
[1:19:42] well i'll be glad when we come to where
[1:19:43] we can speak the word i said you got to
[1:19:45] get it first
[1:19:50] you know i didn't understand why people
[1:19:51] didn't understand that point
[1:19:53] that's very simple to me
[1:19:58] well you had to get it first
[1:20:00] well
[1:20:01] we see everybody saw well what do you
[1:20:03] mean get it we got the prophet's message
[1:20:05] and then i'd quote things
[1:20:09] and i just got where i'd carry the books
[1:20:11] with me
[1:20:14] because i quote someone they'd say
[1:20:17] i didn't know he said that
[1:20:19] i said well i said so-and-so
[1:20:21] one brother one day he said i just
[1:20:22] listened to that tape
[1:20:24] and i didn't hear him say it
[1:20:31] read the book
[1:20:33] did you say it
[1:20:35] yeah
[1:20:36] well
[1:20:38] see
[1:20:40] but see that way you become a smart
[1:20:42] aleck
[1:20:44] i never have understood that
[1:20:47] i don't know what an alec is
[1:20:52] i'm sure he ain't smart
[1:20:56] but now listen
[1:21:01] the whole entire bible is pointing down
[1:21:04] to a group of people
[1:21:06] that can make god known
[1:21:10] the prophet of god said i've done the
[1:21:12] best i can do breaking this down
[1:21:14] to you
[1:21:16] i'll give it to you in big nuggets
[1:21:18] he said the fifo ministry will pick it
[1:21:20] up
[1:21:21] and they'll break it down to you
[1:21:24] well see i believe in a holy ghost
[1:21:25] living in everybody
[1:21:27] and you know what sisters i love to hear
[1:21:29] you talk about god
[1:21:33] like i said
[1:21:35] sister birds you know she
[1:21:37] she
[1:21:38] was very illiterate in their bases and
[1:21:40] she wouldn't mind me saying that because
[1:21:41] she couldn't even hardly write her own
[1:21:43] name
[1:21:44] and
[1:21:45] she wouldn't even buy we went to get her
[1:21:46] a stove one day and she wouldn't buy
[1:21:48] stove it had all the modern convenience
[1:21:49] she said all i wanted on and off
[1:21:54] that's true i'm not throwing off on her
[1:21:56] but you know i preached one night all i
[1:21:58] could preach you know but i'm just
[1:22:00] preaching on the godhead you know and
[1:22:01] the things like that he come from god
[1:22:03] and went to god and i told you about it
[1:22:05] on the way home that night she said
[1:22:06] brother i see what you talking about i
[1:22:08] said dear she's yeah said he come from
[1:22:10] god went to god said he's god all the
[1:22:12] whole time
[1:22:13] i said i wish i'd let you preach
[1:22:17] because i spent an hour and a half
[1:22:18] trying to explain that
[1:22:22] she brought it down in simple terms
[1:22:24] i love to hear you sisters talk about it
[1:22:29] why because you gotta have my wife's
[1:22:31] gotta have her own holy ghost
[1:22:34] she's gotta have her own change in the
[1:22:35] body
[1:22:39] see you sisters you know i love to hear
[1:22:41] you talk about the word that's why we
[1:22:43] have a good time on on a saturday night
[1:22:45] bible study
[1:22:47] we just sit down just talk and just eat
[1:22:49] popcorn and just sit there and talk
[1:22:51] about the
[1:22:52] the message
[1:22:53] you know
[1:22:54] have a good time at it
[1:22:56] and the sisters most of the time sisters
[1:22:58] will do a lot of the talking then
[1:23:00] because they'll they'll open up you know
[1:23:01] a little bit and i enjoy it
[1:23:04] but do you understand what i'm trying to
[1:23:05] say now folks
[1:23:07] we think manifestation is signs and
[1:23:09] wonders
[1:23:12] but get the word first
[1:23:14] and then signs and wonders will follow
[1:23:16] it
[1:23:19] but it's word first it's never been
[1:23:20] signs and wonders now you say what now
[1:23:23] wait just a minute now what about back
[1:23:24] there where the son of righteousness
[1:23:26] arising healing in his wings
[1:23:29] you better remember one thing
[1:23:31] while those signs and wonders was taking
[1:23:33] place
[1:23:36] there was a prophet being prepared
[1:23:40] in the word
[1:23:42] right
[1:23:45] that's what i talked about while ago he
[1:23:48] started out letting other people preach
[1:23:50] and he come behind him
[1:23:52] but he went long leasing that wasn't
[1:23:54] working
[1:23:55] he started preaching
[1:23:57] at the same time the signs and wonders
[1:23:59] were striking the world as a promise
[1:24:01] from god
[1:24:03] the prophet was being made ready in the
[1:24:05] word
[1:24:09] standing there in the word
[1:24:11] and that's what everybody else everybody
[1:24:12] said about him said
[1:24:14] you know you can't say anything about
[1:24:15] his life you can't say anything about
[1:24:17] all because it's all wonderful
[1:24:20] i said we just don't agree with what he
[1:24:21] said you know he's teaching
[1:24:24] well that's what he said
[1:24:26] i remember the man stood up and told it
[1:24:28] one day there and meeting you know and
[1:24:29] said
[1:24:30] did you believe brother brown while he's
[1:24:32] in the discernment and all i can say
[1:24:33] when he starts preaching said you know
[1:24:35] that word
[1:24:36] he walked out behind him you know and
[1:24:37] this sweet little homeboy
[1:24:41] he said you know somebody would say that
[1:24:42] there's really got to be something wrong
[1:24:46] because you see that's the sign of god
[1:24:50] is the revealing of his word
[1:24:53] and he to whom the son will reveal it
[1:24:57] the son came to make the father known
[1:25:01] and the son was made known
[1:25:03] by the father
[1:25:05] is not that the way that we're supposed
[1:25:07] to be
[1:25:09] so you see why did i preach the way i do
[1:25:11] and just keep on preaching and just keep
[1:25:13] going
[1:25:16] the lord's took care of us
[1:25:19] and he will
[1:25:23] but there is a word to be fulfilled
[1:25:26] thank god for it told me
[1:25:28] thank god for the word
[1:25:31] his word
[1:25:33] and then
[1:25:34] manifestation
[1:25:37] we make god known do you understand what
[1:25:39] i'm saying he'll make us known
[1:25:43] that goes for women children and all
[1:25:45] make god known
[1:25:46] what have i done here many times we'd be
[1:25:48] praying for somebody and i take a prayer
[1:25:50] cloth hand it back i said whatever
[1:25:51] person in here to pray over this men
[1:25:53] women and children
[1:25:56] right
[1:25:57] but i believe the children
[1:25:59] can trust god we're us old adults a lot
[1:26:02] of times done set too much and we
[1:26:04] have problems
[1:26:06] when young kids can believe
[1:26:10] i want to see god living in a church
[1:26:15] now this is not set to be one person
[1:26:18] it's said to be god living in the church
[1:26:21] manifesting himself
[1:26:26] and according to the bible it didn't say
[1:26:28] now and it will end it and then we'll
[1:26:30] pick up later
[1:26:31] it didn't say
[1:26:33] that the whole world was waiting on
[1:26:34] brother branham to come
[1:26:39] he said yes it does no it just says
[1:26:41] he'll come
[1:26:43] behold i send you a life to the pro
[1:26:47] but then when you get over in romans it
[1:26:49] says the whole world waiting on the
[1:26:50] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:26:58] brother branham done his job
[1:27:01] he brought us to
[1:27:02] work it's our job to get into the word
[1:27:05] now and to bring forth the dead to bring
[1:27:07] forth the things that happen and he's in
[1:27:09] the grave waiting on us
[1:27:11] whatever you believe to take place on
[1:27:13] down through there that's up to you and
[1:27:15] what's going to take place but you
[1:27:16] better remember one time the dead's
