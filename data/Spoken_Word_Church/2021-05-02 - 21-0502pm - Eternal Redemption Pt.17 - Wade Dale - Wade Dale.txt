it's important time to be here and to listen to you speak to the people now father today i pray that it'll be you that speaks to him lord not just a human being but lord use these lips of clay father

able to digest it and move on with you father we pray that you just sanctify us lord for this journey sanctify us lord as we get ready to take this communion and bless us now in jesus name as we do the ordinances of the church lord in your name we ask you amen amen everybody believes in the ordinance of the churches right we're believing the ordinance of the church i don't believe it ever got took out but christ being coming high priest through good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once until the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word we're gonna uh if anybody needs one of these charts we're gonna be uh um looking at the chart today and and hopefully not be too too long we got a few things we got to do this afternoon so let's go to first john 4 and read that we were talking last sunday and i want you to understand something we we know that in the end time there's a special group of people because if we continue on like we do and the denominational world uh they're doing an adequate job of of getting people to christ and but you know as well as i do the reason we congregate is not only that it's just as we were talking at brother ray's memorial service we know john 3 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten begotten son that who should believe in him shall not perish but have everlasting life but now remember that makes you a spirit-born babe in christ you've got to continue on with god you've not got to you can't stay a baby jesus christ didn't stay a baby and he doesn't want you to stay a baby or he wants you to grow up and then then all of a sudden he sends you in malachi 4 he says behold i send you elijah the prophet before the great and dreadful day of the lord so he he saved god almighty in human form saved your soul and then he sent you a prophet one of the seven stars that we were taught as we were talking about last night in a bible study one of the seven stars in the hand of god remember in revelations there one two and three he sent a messenger to each church age a lot of people don't have problems with paul because paul wrote 80 of the bible they don't have a problem with john wesley being a great prophet or or or martin luther being a great prophet but when you talk about a prophet in the end time and we call his name and we say william branham everybody just goes haywire well i don't understand why they do that because it's in the bible we're we were needed we needed a prophet to turn us back to the original faith or we're just going to continue going on as we are we're just going to live we're going to die we're going to do this you know you understand what i'm saying but there is an afterlife to this amen and we by the eye of being in the eagle age and being the prophetic people that we are god sent us a prophet not only just to send us somebody to tell us what to do but he gave us a gift and left that with us as brother dale's talking about this morning we all have a prophetic gift if we're under this age of prophetic gift all right we had an age in in uh columbus day that age was an ox age it was an age that labored in burdening just to say that jesus was your savior meant death right amen so we're not into that yet we we don't think but maybe maybe we'll come to that but that was the spirit of the age so each spirit had each spirit was connected to a certain age and this age was in revelations 3 14 which said at the beginning of the creation of god it talks about what i'll give you i sav in other words you're not seeing right you're naked and don't know it being neck is one thing but being naked and don't know it that's a deception and that's most of the world now if you walk outside they're naked and obviously they don't know it or they don't care but what it you know why because they got a familiar spirit and that familiar spirit is not familiar with the spirit that you got that makes you put your clothes on it's really interesting how that uh when jesus comes to gadara and he sees this man named legion that has thousands of demons in him and he's naked but when jesus pronounces the demons has left his body he put clothes on he didn't stay naked he put clothes on anywhere you see that somebody has been made whole they put their clothes on right man so you see now the day and time that we're living there must not be anybody being made whole because they're taking theirs off man so but we know we know that's going to be this because of revelations 3 14. they're naked and don't know it blind wretched miserable naked that's pretty rough all those all those blind rich and miserable and naked and don't know it that's the whole problem so that's why that we are a little different we are as i was telling the people at brother ray's funeral there were some uh unbelievers there and and others it's just there's more to god than just going to church there's more to god than just saying i was i was baptized there's more to god than just saying i was i was saved back in 19 and whatever it is and i'm just here no you got a purpose you're part of this plan and purpose that we're talking about and because of agape love god so loved the world now that love is not filial love that's agape love amen it wasn't filial love and filial love remember as our prophet went across the curtain of time and went into the place that the christians were being held there after their death here on earth because the christian can't die he just moved from one place to the other amen the dead in christ you were you died in christ when you got born again amen so we see that that filio love though doesn't go across the curtain of time because he met his first wife and she said my precious brother all right so that feel your love doesn't go over there but it's agape love and if you're born again today you have that agape love because watch what first john tells us that we have known and believed the love that god hath to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god now in not around him are known of god god knows everybody in this whole world but those only a few people that are in christ that we're going to read here in ephesians that we were we were accepted in christ or chosen in christ not of christ herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there's no fear in love but perfect love cast without fear because fear has torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love how many times have you seen the angels appear or even jesus appeared to the disciples what's the first thing he said fear not fear not why because something supernatural is fixing to happen that you're and that's why they call it supernatural it's not natural it's supernatural and when supernat when the supernatural happens people get all jittery right right especially if you don't have the same spirit of the person that you that approaches you hey man you get a little uncomfortable you get a little uh i don't i don't know that you know the spirits are not familiar uh you watch brother branham on the prayer lines he'll walk up and he said oh your spirit is familiar why because they both got the holy ghost and the holy ghost is connected to the holy ghost because there's only one god there's only one holy ghost amen but when he but when he doesn't say anything he and then he'll look at the person and say you need to get right with god well you know that they don't have the baptism of the holy ghost and he discerned that because that's where they were fit their fear how many times did he tell the the people in the prayer line he said oh don't fear that or don't fear the you're going through the change you're just nervous you're doing these things like that but look there's no fear and love but perfect love cat this out fear because fear has torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us now see we couldn't love him if he had not first loved us everybody got that say amen there is no way that we know how to love god unless he loved us first then what he done he projected that love into our soul by the baptism of the holy ghost so soul to soul we are jesus christ made manifest in another form and john says we love him because he first loved us in other words he taught he taught us how to love right and how did he do that he died on a cross and then came back on the day of pentecost and put his soul inside of me and you by the baptism of the holy ghost if man if a man says i love god and hateth his brother he's a liar but he that loveth not his brother whom he has seen how can he love god whom he has not seen now that's pretty uh elementary so let's go to ephesians one and let's read this real quick this is a favorite scripture of mine it should be yours because we've read it 17 times let's go to number verse four according as he has chosen us in him not of him judas was chosen of god adolf hitler was chosen of god anybody was is anybody in the world is chosen of god because they had to be before knowledge chosen to come to this earth as brother dale said because everybody's got a gift look at what he said about elvis presley and all the different ones that came up pentecostal and and was was great in the pentecostal realm and then sold his soul the prophet said for a fleet of cadillacs what he had an anointing that could just bring a whole house into just complete submission but what do you do he did it by twisting and turning and singing love songs and all that he took that gift that god gave him and he perverted it satan took the gift that god gave him god's right hand man he took that gift and perverted it same thing with me and you we've all been given a gift that's why we're going to talk about like said special singing and stuff that those gifts need to be exercised as we were talking about last night in a bible study exercise bodily exercise doesn't profit much but you need to exercise your gift right if you've got a gift and god's trying to get that gift he's going to use it through you he's going to use it through you he's not you don't want to use it through if you give it to donny you don't want to use it through brother dale he wants to use it through brother donnie because there's a certain characteristics of yourself that nobody else has sister alicia sang that song a few minutes ago and i've heard it 500 times on the radio i have never heard it like that but that had some meaning to it the girl that sings it she's a professional singer on the radio and she sings it different and i'd rather hear it that way amen because what it's a gift used with the spirit behind it the right spirit behind it elvis presley was a spirit but it wasn't the right one that he used to do what he used to totally mesmerize the beatles and all the different ones were given a gift and they totally mesmerized the people and the people fell under an anointing that should have been of god and should have been used of god that's why we tell our young people when we try to get our young people involved to get them involved in what we're doing that way that god can use the gift and not satan because satan's going to want to use it first because remember satan is right there with god he's not off somewhere on vacation he's right there with god and as soon as an anointing or god gets ready to give you a gift there's old diablo right there beside of him he's going to say okay i'll take that and i'll pervert it i'll make it for me me me me i eyes oh devil but according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world so we go back to romans 8 and we see that we're heirs and joint heirs with god join heirs with christ or whatever christ gets we get and that's that's the whole issue that i have with the world they want to say yes jesus died on the cross 2000 years ago and then he's my savior but they leave him on the cross or either they put him back on the cross remember what brother branham had to indict this generation for the second crucifixion of christ what they took christ and put it back on the cross they couldn't get him and put him in the heart you and i have got that same god that died on calvary we have him in our heart he came back on the day of pentecost to prove that he was god that he came back on the day of pentecost to what to get into the chosen ones the ones he had chosen before the foundation of the world right here it says before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us into the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself listen you can't adopt yourself someone has to do the adopting amen you can't walk up even in a court of law right now and you say look i want to adopt somebody they say you won't adopt me you can't do that it's funny but it makes a point you can't adopt yourself you have to be adopted what so satan doesn't want to adopt you he wants you to just be his but you got to transfer that adoption papers has got to transfer over into another family a different family has got to be brought into view so that other family is god almighty and he wants to adopt us right here look having predestinated us unto adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will now let's go down to verse 11. also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him that worketh all things after the council of his own will i'm just going to skip through some to be short today we obtained an inheritance how did we obtain inheritance there was a plan there was a plan and a purpose of god before the foundation of the world and the reason he did it before the foundation of the world is because being god almighty he knows all things he knew what was going to happen beforehand he knew adam was going to fall he knew eve was going to fall he knew satan was going to do what he did there has been no surprises ever in god's realm never in god's house never in god's dimension has there been a crisis i said his his dimension there's never been a crisis because god don't have crisis he knows what's going to happen he knew what was going to happen before he made satan and knew what was going to happen before he put adam and eve on earth right but now to be god he had to put him on earth and let them make a choice satan made a choice you make a choice adam made choice even made a choice we make choices every day right is that all right we make choices trying to back up a little bit for the for the ones that are here but we have obtained an inheritance now remember jesus didn't come to bring us that inheritance he didn't develop an inheritance when he was on earth now the inheritance was already before the foundation of the world the inheritance was in the father's mind because the father is the only one who can have children if you thought of that the father's the only one who can have children you say no no why well i think if you put the wife and the and the husband together they bring death man that's born of a woman is full of trouble dead born dead if you're born we all we all sitting here today we all were born the same way but see father god doesn't it doesn't take a sexual act for him to bring forth children it's the spoken word of god that brings forth children into like the genesis 1 26 man that we love so much that was a what a spoken word seed that was spoken cannot ever be done away with that is a part of god that satan can't touch he never has touched it and he never will touch it now listen god has not been able to use it like he wanted to use it because of satan bringing us into this domain bisexual desire instead of by the spoken word of god because how was jesus born jesus wasn't born by sex is our jesus wasn't born by no egg of a woman or no sperm of a man god i read you the other sunday god created the egg and created the germ that is god's own blood there was no dna of no man or no woman in the earth ever could trace yourself back to jesus christ so me and you listen that's why paul says we're not known by the flesh now we know jesus had to die but remember the soul is what he give the ransom right his body was a sacrifice reading uh what is it isaiah 52 he gave his soul a ransom so he could see his seed not his body his body his body was the healing part he took stripes on his body for me and you but that soul was where you and i were contacted at because if you're born again today you will have that same soul of god not a second person not a third person not a part of trinity it's one god and jesus christ is his name but you and i are part of that because of romans 8 tells us we're heirs and joint heirs listen whatever jesus has got you got do you believe that amen you better start believing it a lot more because that's what's going to change your body because it took him out of a grave now we know he had to die but he died for me and you but when he resurrected out of that tomb he had a glorified body and he's still in that glorified body amen so by foreign knowledge he knew all this so he made this plan and this plan never has you know god's pencil never has an eraser on it mine and yours we have white out by the gallons we have spell check we have all these other things to keep us lined up and keep us straight but god never had he never had white out he never had a a an eraser to say no i don't want to do it that way he knew what to do and he set this plan in motion now the whole situation is is he had to make it where you and i could accept that plan and it'd be the simplest thing as brother joe and i were talking this morning you take brother random you know he's all about he's a he's kentucky no but he don't he don't talk country like i thought country he said just no country boy but his dialect that he used think about it the dialect he used of course he said hate and tote and tater and all that other stuff but you could understand what he was saying because that was god talking to us through that language of that man that was a kentuckian or or what i believe you know he's born in like north kentucky so he was close to being in indiana so he he wasn't a complete southerner like we are but but god needed somebody like that because you know when god walked on the earth the bible says the common people heard him gladly common people the the the the commentary and all that you read about jesus is language it was a common language that was spoken by street people in other words it wasn't a high language that you couldn't understand like you know we have kings english and all you go to jamaica and you swear they're speaking in tongues but they're talking irregular english like me and you you just tell them slow down but they're speaking english but we're not understanding it because we don't speak like that but it is king's english so god spoke to us in the end time by a plain and common language but that was part of the plan this plan that we're going to look at today on it it's a common plan sure it has supernatural content in it but it's it's very simple it used people it used human fallen people to get this plan started and ended if you want to say ended to an eternal plan but not ended because remember a gentile i said the other day that the gentile plan of redemption ends it really does end for the gentiles but see remember it continues on to the jews continues on to the 144 000 i mean continues on to the fifth sealed jew continues on to the white throne judgment where the foolish virgin be given eternal life and a cup of water my name and then when we go live in a new city we're going to see nail scars in his hand we're going to know that there was a price paid for redemption amen but we had to be caught into this dimension we were caught into the first three light time and matter we went through and talked about the fourth dimension which is science or the tree of life or wi-fi or websites or whatever heights you want to call it and satan works through that realm and so does god oh yeah but now the fifth dimension is the place of holding and i want to clear something up too we had spoke it before but remember i read the quote where the prophet of god tells us and it's not it's not a burning hell hell is not burning at this time right if you look up the word hell show kahana whatever you want to call it it is a place of the damned or a place of holding it is a place where if you look in the bible and you read that lazarus was had died and went in the bosom of abraham and the rich young ruler had died and went to hell now he was in a place of torment and he said i wish somebody would come and put water on my tongue but in other words it wasn't a burning place because it doesn't burn up and it's not a place of judgment yet because that's reserved for the white throne judgment right everybody got that but now the bible tells us of a lake of fire now that lake of fire is where you're going if you're not born again you're going to that lake of fire and i don't care how long you're you're in that dimension or in that lake of fire you're going to one day just disappear you're going to just go out of existence because you came here for a temporary time to fill time and the prophet of god tells you that this cannon fodder ashes let's don't be ashes folks if you get the baptism by the holy ghost you won't be ashes you'll be an eternal being with god and that's what the sixth dimension is we know the sixth dimension is christ the saints the dead saints of the resting saints we read that the other day because we talked about paradise i'm trying to get to the place here we'll look at the chart for a minute let sister julie gonna come and do this for for me oh you got it all right oh well gary wasn't laughing for what you hiding for i wouldn't call you up here for nothing i'd have to call 9-1-1 but we know that paradise was a place that was made in this plan of redemption see god in this plan of redemption knew that everybody couldn't go into the sixth dimension because they're not born again in the old testament their their sins were covered or capoed by the blood or covered over because an animal blood can't save you actually the blood of jesus christ doesn't save you nope it keeps you safe the life that's in the blood is what came back on you on the day of pentecost the life that was in that blood but that life see i could give my life for my dad or he could give his life for me being son and father but there's no way that if i pass on that my spirit could subdivide myself and go back into him and make him a better person nobody got that right but now jesus christ the soul of souls the eternal one he can do that right he died on the cross one time went to hell went to paradise put him somewhere came back here stayed for a few days left come back on the day of pentecost into the believers the ones that were chosen in him before the foundation of the world and now he's living in the believer and he's the same in me as he is brother dale or brother donny any of you that's got the baptism of the holy ghost you don't have a different god in you than i do or we've got all kind of healing gods running around here amen so he can subdivide his soul like a piece of pie but it's not like a piece of pie that runs out is that one piece of pie you know is that widow woman reached down in that cruise and reached down in that flower after elijah said it won't run dry she dug that thing in with a cup and as soon as she pulled it up the cup just felt the spot just filled right back up that spot just filled right back up in the crew she would reach down and get a little cruiser all and she'd say oh i don't know i better not use a lot of them and she'll look back and it'll be full that's the way god is with me and you he's never going to run out but he's only going to have a certain amount of people in this plan because you know he knows how many people are going to accept him and how many people are not that's why i told you a long time i always wondered about predestination about people like adolf hitler and different ones i even think about uh you know kids and all that are that are um their life has been shortened and you know they were without god you wonder lord why but that's not a cruel god he just knows that that person is not gonna ever accept him see god knows that he knew adolf hitler if he give adolf hitler a million years that adolf hitler would never accept jesus christ so therefore he could let him live his life die commit suicide ever what it was be the be the heathen that he was and god tried to save him and he didn't want salvation same thing with all of us same way he gives all of us a chance and if we turn that chance down guess what we're lost we're done for him but there is grace glory there is the grace of god that continues on and on and on i know that god called me at 14 years old in different times and i gave my heart to the lord but i didn't give it all to him right anybody want to admit that i didn't give it all to him i kept some old husbands i didn't ask him to kill them all i just wanted to act a little religious every once in a while but you know come to find out is you stay in what we were talking the other day about the bible saying that a sinner will not be able to sit in the congregation of the righteous because once the word goes forth you see people fidgeting they get all fidgety you know why they're uncomfortable we used to see it a lot in the youth camps that when we were in alabama june and i were there for eight years so we watched a group of people grow up from youngins all the way up to the to you know teenagers and on up into getting married and you could just sit in the back of the congregation of course it'd be three four five hundred young people in there and you'd be sitting in the back and all of a sudden you didn't have to have discernment right aaron you really didn't you just watched them start fidgeting right you watch them start getting convicted and you watch them start trying to fight that thing and they're not really doing this fighting it they're fighting it on the inside all right and that's why that the brother gary always told us he said let him go the bathroom one time because what they were doing the first part of of the youth camp when we first started them in alabama you know we'd let people go in and out and well they would disappear well what would happen either they'd be out with a girl somewhere that happens and youth camp they'd be outside talking to a girl while the service is going on or they'd be walking back to their dorm to smoke them a cigarette or whatever they're going to do yeah it happens it still does because there's a devil there the devil gets there before you do and then he anoints the people so then all of a sudden gary said brother gary said no don't let him out he said if they go to the bathroom you go with them we had to escort jim where you at we had to escort if you went to the bathroom at a youth camp in alabama you had to literally escort that person to the bathroom why because like brother gary said and i love what what he said he said you know what he said we trust you it's the devil we don't trust so but you see what i mean about that you you look and see the familia familiar spirits and you see the unfamiliar spirit right and you don't have to have a lot of discernment because watch this let's read quote number 13 real quick and then we'll make a few comments at the end of new ones we've read all these before talking about perfect love but watching number 13 and brother branham says look you cannot love with your body you love with your spirit and see that's what when you have filial love for your wife or for your friends or for your children and even under that there's different types of love but that's not the love of god it says you can love even love god and still not be right because you love god with your outside emotion and feelings and all the different things that you let get these anointings get on you and you can love god but you can't love god with your body you love him with your spirit now remember you have a spirit and you have a soul your spirit is memory reason conscious effects and imagination your soul is either faith or doubt there is no emotion come on because it's either god or the devil that's the other that's the only emotion there is right so it's the anointed anointed with the real spirit the holy spirit can fall upon a man in his spirit but his soul is his germs his your soul is where you live that's the firing mechanism when your soul leaves your body your body quits functioning right there is no lights on there's nobody at the house your soul is either going to go in the fifth dimension of the sixth dimension and you're going to go one of the two places and you're going to wait till the judgment amen there is no in between there is no praying you out of purgatory there is no uh halfway house right not in god the holy spirit can fall upon a man in his spirit but his soul is his germ that german's the word and how i don't care how much you can preach how well you do this and how much you love that's just one in other words that's one of the inlets to the spirit you can't love with your body like i said before you don't sin with your body your body is the vehicle that the sin travels through because this same body that you see today drained beer said bad words and did a lot of things that he shouldn't have done but now i didn't have to replace this body and get me another one what the motivator inside is what left so it was this same guy right here but see and i still have the same memories and conscious effects and imagination but paul says turn your affections to christ because my affection was to other things whatever you want to you know you fill out your card i've done filled out mine i told you what it was so you fill out your laundry list or your card of whatever you did but you can even love god because you know it constrains us when you come to church you say oh man i just love god because i can feel it now that has nothing to do with it there's nothing to do with it but do you love god enough to come to church read your bible study pray get revelation from god and be happy about it and you really never run the owls you really never have to speak in tongues because i as brother dale's talking about those nine spiritual gifts those nine spiritual gifts they have to be judged as he said this morning by three witness two or three witnesses so all that has to be judged right but now like i said apostle prophet pastor of teaching evangelist that's not judged god judges those you don't judge them but we have to judge because why why do you why do you say that by the way because seeing nine spiritual gifts they can be imitated wisdom god satan's one of the most wisdom people in the world he's the most knowledgeable person in the world he's just eating off the wrong tree and he makes you and mead off the wrong tree right and all he was speaking in tongues brother brown said you know he said i've seen heathen speak in tongues and take a knife or a blade or something and slice this their skin and nothing come out or hang hooks on their why because see that's a spiritual part but it's not of god right it's a filial love and that word love we say it all the time but it's the most unused word because you know i love to deer hunt well connect that with any other love for any you know your wife or your family or anything no it doesn't work everybody got that and man i'm kind of backing up and kind of slowing down a little bit so we can uh get a point here but so god see where oh you can't love with your body you can love god and still not be right you can cast out devils and preach and do these things and still not be right jesus said so said many would come in that day remember we talked about the last part the word settles it because remember in the bible jesus told us i believe it's in matthew 12 or somewhere he said they'll come to me in that day and said lord lord have i not cast out devils have i not spoken tongues have i not done many mighty great works and jesus is going to say depart from me i never knew you in other words i never had i never had an intimate relationship with you as a person so they mixed filial love with agape love and it's two totally separate loves you can't you can't intertwine them filio love was given for you down here agape love is what you cannot like john said we can't love him until he loved us first so this great plan of redemption is that he loved us first he knew how many people were going to be saved he knew how many people were going to want him he knew who would use their gift in the right way and who wouldn't use their gift in the right way but he lets you continue on because you know what he's a good god but he's not greasy grace either i believe in grace but i don't believe in greasy grace you can't go past what the bible says amen now there's different things that you can in different levels that you you talk about as far as things that happen that go on in life but you have to go back to what the bible says you cannot deviate from this bible all right because see look this bible is full of grace already you don't have to manufacture another set of it's right here in the bible right but like i said before it's not greasy grace it's not going to allow judas to do what he did and be a believer right no no way judas was not judas was a believer but he was an unbeliever he was believing in something even the bible tells us that that the devil and the devil's angels believe in one god in tremble why because they've never seen but one there's not three people walking around in heaven there's one there's one god not two or three all right look let's read this number 15 because we've got to get it to jesus christ and then we'll look at the chart for a minute so i'll go to number 15 if you don't mind brothers under the law under the shadow they entered in under the shedding of the blood of goats and bulls which we went through which could not take away sin it was a life of an animal we just explained that i don't have to explain it again let's read the red that's why it never returns back and having anything to do with a human being it could not but god before the foundation of the world for ordained that jesus would come the perfect lamb of god into a perfect cell that god himself created to bring blood into the world to offer that blood so you can all the other blood had been offered as a substitute blood of bulls and goats blood of animals but listen there was no other human being that shed blood to give it back to another human being when you died you just went somewhere else but this man the perfect man jesus christ brought his own blood into the world because if it would not have been he wouldn't have been god he wouldn't have been virgin born because there would have been another blood injected in even with uh may you know some people believe that that mary produced the egg well see that you can't that's a connection to to the sexual part amen so god had to create egg and sperm and put it in the womb so she was an incubator to bring god into the world to bring blood into the world to what to offer that blood he died i mean he was born to die but he didn't was born he wasn't born to die for himself he was born to die for me and you amen amen so let's keep reading and if you can turn him down in this hour i love that the sinner that was in that blood cell with his love and the holy ghost himself after that offering of that man can come back and possess a believer he bought eternal redemption right now did you get that then how see it through the blood washing of the blood taking away separating of sin that the holy spirit would've the believer through the blood cleansing of the soul into the fellowship into this spirit life inside with christ shut out the world and the very nature of god is in you still subject to mistakes but god can't see it because it's covered by the blood god can't see through the blood every time he looks through the blood it looks white he looks through the blood it looks white now in number 16 in hebrews chapter 5 the prophet tells us look not to be redeemed today and then next week when the revival is over your redemption's over no we're talking about eternal redemption it goes all the way through now we have our problems we have our backslidings but watch go to the next one number 16. there you go got it not to be redeemed today and then next week when the revival starts be redeemed again and then oh we backslide and be redeemed again you're redeemed once forever but you better make sure that that is sure and right the first time because you can't be and i'm sure our lives do like this but your spirituality listen if you stand still in god you've backslid that's right if you just stand still you don't have to go backwards because all the other wave of christianity is going forward in front of you that makes you backslid are you not born again one other thing see you can't you look you can't backslide you can backslide and be born again but you can't it's not called backslid if you're not if you're lost because what are you sliding back from right if you're born again you can backslide brother brown said it backslides every day we do we do little things that's not that's contrary to god but we're talking about not you know go don't go back and and smoke and cuss and drink and i want to do this right right and i do a horrible job of it when i say this i want to preach the gospel i want to meet people i want to have a congregation that that we all are filled full of the holy ghost but i backslide from that because i forget about you sometimes i'm human so are you but that doesn't mean that i've that i'm lost because backslid means you had to come that you did come back but you can still go forward but listen if you just keep going backwards and keep doing the same thing over and over again you need to check your your new birth first find out you're born again you might can do that in denominational world you know you can go to church three or four times a year and and you know some people you know say a couple of hail marys and you're fine not in this not not the way we see god god is a moving god and god moves you need to move with him and that's the same way with all of us we need to do what the bible says for satan not assembling itself together and all those different things sometimes we forget that but not to be redeemed today this plan of redemption let me just put it simple this plan of redemption cannot be broken right right there's it can't be broken because it's an eternal plan of redemption how you gonna break something that's eternal it's gonna happen you've gotta make the choice though whether you want to attach yourself to it or not to where you wanna be that one that's chosen in him before the foundation of the world that god did send you a seventh church aged messenger to to take all the scruples and all the loose ends and put them together to where you can look and say aha that's what he meant not the 900 different ways the world thinks it's meant that's the way it meant that's the way it was supposed to be and when you look at it it's so plain of english and it's so plain you say how did i miss that well it wasn't your time yet maybe you were black backslid maybe you didn't have god in your life at all but you know once you get this eternal redemption no more redeem redeem redeem eternal redemption he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting light or eternal life and shall never come into the judgment but hath passed pass from death and to life because he is shook no because he was baptized a certain way question mark because he had blood in his hand because he had believed on the only begotten son of god that's how we have eternal redemption right all right let's look at number 17 who is this guy that we're going to talk about here in just a few minutes and then we'll close we've got a lot to do today prophet of god says look talk about a super sign see a lot of people think jesus just came on earth because he's the second person trinity and god god was up there talking to jesus and hey go down there and go down there and uh maybe somebody will feel sorry for you and and believe on you and and they'll get uh baptized and and they'll we'll take them to heaven now boy that sounds like a good plan doesn't it no that ain't an eternal plan of redemption now listen for god so loved the world he knew the world though was not all gonna love him but the part of the world that did love him god sent him for that and he didn't send a second person he went his south that's right amen god died in flesh you say oh god can't die i didn't say god died i said god died in flesh amen he gave up actually no man killed him read your bible the bible says he gave up the ghost he could have died anytime he was in full control everybody in the whole world thought that guy was so out of control man he's up there naked he's got yes jesus was naked on the cross we put a little thing around him just to make it modest in this time but he was they said he stripped the bible said they stripped his clothes off and he was hanging there naked before the world and had spit all over him but you know what he was in complete control he said into my hands thy hands i commend my spirit and the bible says he gave up the ghost no man killed him what a god but where did this guy start talk about a super sign he could have come an angel if he wanted to he could have come a full grown matured man but a baby over a pile of manure crying talk about a super son that's a real super sign a baby jehovah crying as a baby a super sign oh my then people say he's just a prophet oh my the super sign jehovah is a boy playing jehovah a man toiling in the comforter shop jehovah himself made flesh and dwelt among us stretched his tent right stretched his tent down here made himself a body to live in to have a blood cell that that blood cell could be broken hallelujah that was the lamb of god that was slain from the foundation of the world that brings us eternal redemption the bible said so here now he's referring to revelations 13 8 where the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world now that was in the mind of god but there had to be a literal happening down here listen we were all in the mind of god before the foundation world but not his people so we had to come down here as people to develop now jesus was before that right go to who's this melchizedek brother brown says look he knew all things now we know he there's a question in there but listen when jesus said before abraham was i am he wasn't talking about the flesh it was standing there at 30 something years old he was talking about that same person that was inside of him it's the same person that spoke to abraham it's the same person that walked in the garden with with adam and the same person it said let us make man in our own image or you've got two or three different gods running around it's the same god listen that's why he can keep his plan straight he didn't have a secretary that might have messed up something he came himself he's done all this by himself and where's he at today he's in you trying to get you to see the same thing it brought us eternal redemption we are purchased by the precious blood of jesus christ which has given us eternal life now we're going to look at the chart real quick but let's read these two scriptures and then we'll go to the chart isaiah 7 14. continue on therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel now we watch now we that's that's over there in isaiah but now let's go to matthew 1 verse 19. then joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example remember they got married and she was pregnant back then that meant death amen but thank god if you've ever thought of this before remember joseph was a widower joseph was an older man because he didn't touch her for nine months after they got married which he lawfully could have because it was his wife if everybody understands what i'm saying but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost so jesus daddy was who the holy ghost i thought he said the father was his daddy it must be the same people hmm pretty simple huh and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us not a second person god with us it had to be god it couldn't have been somebody else so that's where we're gonna and he is the let's just talk about that for a second and go and bring the chart up if you want to but in this eternal plan of redemption it all hinged on the plan number one being perfect which we know it was because he's the one that made it but it also required that he participate in it everybody got that because it says right here a virgin shall conceive somebody's going to come down here in human flesh and going to be almighty god and he's going to die and give his life for the human race so there has to be what a man that can do it and some people that'll be there that'll receive it so there's your plan i said before you can have the best football basketball you can have the best plan on your uh whatever you got going on in your life you can have a wonderful plan but if you don't number one execute it number two if there's nobody there to do it you got to have 11 people on the football field you can grow you can have a play that'll score a touchdown every time but you got 11 players that you've got to get that to first then you got to remember there's 11 players in opposition trying to keep you from doing that so that's the devil he's got a plan too to keep us from doing all this but thank god it's an eternal plan and it came from an eternal god the devil's not eternal hell is not eternal thank god luis did a wonderful job doing that the other night because that you know a lot of people hinge on hell being eternal well if hell is eternal then there's got to be eternal life in hell i just that's just really one plus one is two if you've got to have eternal if you're going to have an eternal place and there's only one form of eternal life there's only one eternal anything and that's god then he's going to have to be stuck in hell the whole time i don't think so no it's going to be done away with the devil and his angels are going to be put in the lake of fire all the other imps and all the other spirits and all the other people are going to be putting that lake of fire done away with right but remember too though watch that's way over here at the white throne judgment they've still those who turn god down this is the fifth dimension they're still there they still got a chance they still have an opportunity even though being right here in this fifth dimension they have an opportunity to state their case right over here amen the people in paradise they were put in a certain spot but when you come right here and we see that paradise was emptied up and it became the sixth dimension and that six dimension is only going to last until cathy what do you got on the back of your go in the back of your heart there sweetie first thessalonians what four well man i got it up here too mr kathy's got a little heart that says first thessalonians 4 16 what the dead in christ she'll rise first she's got a little bit of brother ray around her neck oh well that that was his mom and daddy's product the real brother raised over here under somewhere in another dimension waiting on us to get our work done but his life we know it is life light and matter this is the first three dimensions genesis 1 26 and 27 was not created it was not created on earth genesis 1 26 man was in glory genesis 1 26 man was back in eternity but we come down to genesis 2 16 and 17 adam and eve were put into flesh and according to genesis 3 1-10 that's where the fall happened and put us down into what time so this is the timeline right here this is time time started at the fall we have the quotes we know that and then time is going to end over here where it blends into eternity on the other side but we got to get to there first all right so god in the old testament he gave us as brother dale was talking about the two tables of stone we were talking about this last night somebody was talking about the ark the ark of the covenant was given in the old testament and the two tables of stone were put in that's all the word they had they didn't have seven church ages they didn't have jesus christ in human flesh to preach to them and for apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists to come and preach to them they had prophets moses brought the word to aaron aaron gave it to the people but god gave him two tables of stone and those two tables of stone were put inside that ark right there's one right here behind here that an art brother joe got and it's got the two tables of stone it's got the butt of aaron's rod too doesn't it if you want to look at it i mean it's back here behind but anyway it's a replica of that but as somebody asked a question last night and see look at the dispensational change everybody with me look at the dispensational change because right here this is the ark of the covenant this is what they depended on the high priest every year to go in behind the holy of holies the veil was shut he would take the blood of a bull and he would offer one time for all the sin of israel he would sprinkle it on the different corners and all the different things he had to go through right but he couldn't touch it he couldn't touch it it was untouchable because remember the ark was taken away and put over into some and i love the have you ever read the scripture where it the the ark of the covenant was taken to another country and was put into the same room where their god dagon or whatever it was was there and every time they'd walk in every morning that they got the their god would be laying face down on the ground and they'd pick the god back up and set it back up the next day they'd come back and god would be stuck and then finally the king of that country said get that thing out of here get that thing out of here so david brought it back and the question was last night is why in other words kind of what why was there was a boy remember they were bringing the art back on oxen which was wrong to begin with but this the thing's getting ready to fall and this man comes out of the crowd and puts his hands up on the ark to steady it to keep it from falling off and god kills him why because god can't change his word he said if you touch it you die he even said if i'm on this mountain and you touch it you die so he can't go and it was really david's fault yeah it never was told to put it on an ox cart and bring it anywhere it was to be carried by the priest it was to be carried by the fivefold ministry it was the word was to be carried by human beings and if they would have been carrying it that poor boy wouldn't have died see how serious this word is now you play with this word now it's the same thing that happened you'll spiritually die that's what we're talking about last night you'll spiritually die but now what does the bible tell us now because of him we're to go boldly behind this veil and just this thing right here is not over here anymore it's inside here that ark of the covenant yeah there's an a there's an actual ark because listen it was touchable after this man left right let me explain that real quick you couldn't touch this this was so holy and they had this ark of the covenant set in the holy of holies in the temple even when jesus was there remember the bible says when jesus was crucified that the the veil was rent from top to bottom showing that no man could do it because it's ever how many 40 or 50 feet high it was rent to show the veil and they had to walk backwards because you can't look at it they had to shut the thing back but that was god showing them that that veil that was not anymore god wasn't right here anymore he was right there and then on the day of pentecost 40 days later the book of acts he comes down he ascends and then comes back 10 days later with the baptism of the holy ghost according to acts 2 verse 1 and this thing sure it's over there somewhere because remember in 1870 titus destroyed the temple and took the ark the menorah and every piece of that of that tabernacle he was able to reach and get it with his with his unholy hands why because god wasn't there and they carried it back to rome it's sitting under the vatican somewhere because titus was a roman general and you carried all your booty or whatever you got you carried it back to wherever your country was so this thing is naturally there but at a time though there was a time and a dispensation that that meant something look to the ark who was the one in the belly of the whale jonah he turned god told him said if you'll just turn and look in that direction he said i'll save you but now what's he doing now he said if you turn and look in this direction i'll save you not no more wood and mortar not no more of a box i read that in the first scripture we read but he this was not eternal that's temporary you can have a hundred thousand of them sit in your house and be just as lost as adolf hitler but you can't have that man in your house and be lost amen so look this is a more sure the bible says a more sure word of testimony than this was this was a testimony there were many many many people were put in paradise because of this little box and then believing that that was jehovah god and that the blood of that animal covered their sin but there had to be one that took the sin away because the plan of redemption would have stopped right here because this thing got old oh yeah i mean it's a piece of wood it's not eternal but an eternal god had to come down here down across raise that back up a little bit if you don't mind now remember the seventh dimension goes continually across that way everybody got that that's the abode of god listen uh it's really not heaven you know the bible says heaven and earth will pass away so let's don't put all of our eggs in one basket and say i want to go to heaven i thought the bible said we're going to live here right right okay so there's the seventh dimension though that's where god is and that god had to come down and be birthed as a baby birth of jesus luke 2 7. he preached for 33 years he preached six seals we're going to you can put the dates in if you want to now go back down to here i mean up or down go that way there you go so you see able died was put in paradise all the different ones were put in paradise now when jesus died where'd he go he went all the way to hell man jesus went to hell and preached to the souls that were imprisoned and the long suffering of the days of noah what's the scripture there i read it the other day but remember death couldn't hold him he came back up we've already read these quotes that's where we're going to stop right here and start again on the dispensation of the gentiles in the seven church ages but all this paradise all this blood of animals covered these people's sin but when christ died he went down here picked up got a set of keys god said keys let's don't forget that he got a set of keys down here remember the keys of death and hell he comes back up here to paradise picks them up and takes them up some of them resurrected on the day that jesus resurrected took them on up into a place to hold there's no more paradise because that was people were older they stayed the same age remember we read that where samuel was an old man but in the sixth dimension there's no old people now they're all 20 years old brother joe's working on a thing and i'm just tickled to death to see that with all the people that's went on that we'll see that the dead in christ shall rise we'll never see we'll never see them old again ever what color was richard's hair when he was younger huh brown it was lighter brown though right okay but you see his picture downstairs well he had a hair anyway people that have hair on the head i know people have hair on their head i guess that's where it goes doesn't it i reckon but you'll never see now because of what christ did he died for the sin of the whole world but only a certain group of people is going to accept him we know the old testament has closed off there's no more old testament there's no more see that's what the problem is now is the problem is that israel believes the jews believe that jesus christ has not come yet right because they're trying to put this thing back together they're trying to get the temple they're trying to get the menorah they're trying to get all the and the sacrifice the red heifer and all that they're trying to get something back and we read it and we'll read it again in ezekiel because we're going to cover daniel 70 weeks again because in ezekiel or not ezekiel but jeremiah i believe it was or zechariah says that they'll mourn because they think that they're this is not come and then there's going to be 144 000 that's going to say where'd you get those scars in your hands he said in the house of my friends because he died right here but israel doesn't believe that he's the messiah so they're trying to go back into bible days and pick up all the blood of animals oh yeah but you know what they're looking for right they're looking for elijah to come because see they take hold behold i send you elijah before the great and dreadful day of the lord they think that hasn't come yet they missed that coming of elijah but i believe through the two prophets which one of them is the fifth coming of elijah is going to explain to them you missed that first coming you missed that coming of elijah in this seventh church age right here you missed that coming of elijah but god still has grace to save 144 000 of them and then continue on into the uh fifth seal jew and all those different ones so everybody kind of got what we're we're at jesus christ right now the plan of redemption is went through the old testament it didn't eradicate sin it only covered sin and pushed it to calvary right it pushed sin to calvary because the blood of animals only covers sin but when the blood of jesus christ when he died at calvary like i said before you could have pints of his blood and not be saved but you can have one speck of a speck of his spirit of his soul and you're you're saved amen but they're looking for natural things and here we are we you know and don't laugh at them listen they were blinded intentionally for me and you intentionally blinded because you know what they believe in one god they look over here and look at all these gentiles that believe all these different things and they go crazy people westerners they don't they don't know nothing about one god they don't know nothing about all this you know they're they're expecting something to come because what god done is god blinded their eyes right here to bring a gentile bride in that's all gentile in the bride church age and we'll get to it later he blinded it a whole nation for me and you he blinded a whole generation right for me and you he let them go through a dispersion and six and a half million of them were killed by eichmann and hitler just because their eyes were blinded from me and you so don't ever look down on those jews they paid a price for them rejecting the just like me and you gonna pay a price if we reject them but they're pl they're paying a literal price because remember this same man stood over here in eternity and he said i'll never forget israel i may have had to divorce her i know she's going to do this i know she's going to go after other gods i know she's going to be this i know she's going to do that but i can't she was my first love she was my first love i can't do away with her because you know what they tried david tried they all tried the best they could do but they never could by being covered by this animal blood take away what that man took away on the day of pentecost he took an old man named peter that cussed in all these different things and he took peter and he used him as a spokesman peter was his spokesman paul paul was a vile man folks saul sorry saul saul would make christians blaspheme he would go in and tear churches up but god said got a plan for that boy because i know when i give him my soul when i give him eternal life i know what he's going to do with it he's going to write 80 of the bible he's going to be my prophet for the first church age he's going to be the man that we're going to go to he's even going to be the man that the 7th angel messenger is going to look back and he said i preached exactly what that man preached if we'd have looked at paul saul we wouldn't have let him in the building he wouldn't let him in the building i mean he was well known he was so well known that when ananias god spoke down nights and said hey there's a man coming to see you whose name is saul and as soon as he said saul i'm sure ananias wouldn't lock yourself in the bathroom he said you kidding me that man that's destroying christianity making the people blaspheme lord we're hiding from this man and what god's saying he said oh don't worry he said in other words i've struck him down right i took him down a notch or two he's going to have a little different spirit when he walks in here but i want you to lay hands on him that he'll receive the baptism of the holy ghost so ann and i said okay since you said it that way i think i'll do it and i'm sure he probably watched paul saw the whole time he was there for three days he was kind of watching him to make sure he didn't but remember saul was incapacitated god had to make that jew incapacitated he couldn't see because he knew he was a staunch jew he knew he had he wanted to do what he wanted to do but when his eyes were open he opened them in a different world he looked at those people then as brothers and sisters not as the adversary same way with me and you let's stand to our feet we'll continue on with the plan of redemption i want to use some of jesus's life and show you some of the things that that he did that maybe the world kind of looked strange upon but i believe the more we understand this man the more we'll understand ourself right because being a christian you've got to be christ-like so you got to be what he was and what he still is so we won't sing a song if you don't mind we'll go ahead on the communion if you need listen we have literally seen people healed taking communion because it was a reverent time it was a prayerful time it was a time of reflection and a time of us coming to a place to where you're supposed to get these things out of your life uh talked to a preacher one time and a long time ago and he said i said how long how often do you take communion he said he said well we take communion when we think the people's ready i said well then we'd never take communion when we think we're ready i said we take it every month brother they'll make sure we're ready because we know we're gonna take every month so we need to be prayerful get these things out of the way because it's a solemn time and we have literally seen people speak in tongues and we've seen people now i've not seen speaking tones brother dale did with brother dean or one of you did but we've seen people heal literally by just taking communion right and it healed their body so if you've got a need today you take this communion and you take it in the order you're supposed to then you know what ask god to heal what you got take away anything that's in your life so let's read first corinthians 11 verse 23. wine and everything is ready for i have received of the lord that's what's also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you that's due in remembrance of me now we know many people think that that's a literal body and all these different things we know it's this is symbolic that's why we don't hold the bread over i will burn it before in the morning i'll burn it almost to a crisp where you can't ever use it again because we don't want to hold over as they did in the um going through the wilderness they held that manna over and it had it rotted the next day and had we had already got in other words there were worms in it all right so and same way with jesus christ we don't hold jesus christ's body over it's all fresh it's new manna every day it's a new revelation it's a new thing that we see so we take bread that's that's not bought in a store it's produced sister lisa makes it a godly sister makes it and it's made by holy hands and then the wine that we take is not grape juice watered down it is wine that my daddy makes and because wine is a stimulant and wine is never goes bad grape juice and all anything else would go bad but wine just gets better with age amen so now what the the body and blood of the lord gets better with age that's why i see that we don't do as other people do because sure it's a symbol but how close to that symbol we need to get because there's that body you're the body of god now and then we're covered by his blood amen so we're going to partake of this communion not just as as bread and wine we're going to take it because he said take eat this is my body which is broken for you that's due in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup which he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood so the bible tells us that without a new testament there has to be a death of a testator he's going to die the next day which made a new testament in my blood because the old testament was covered like we said under the blood of bulls and goats it wasn't you couldn't drink that kind of wine or anything to make a symbolics of that so he said this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily now you see that are in unworthy manner the bible says shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord so we need to clear everything out but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup it didn't say you didn't not take it he said get right to take it all right but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body now who is the lord's body we are the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep so that's pretty serious for if we would judge ourselves we should not be jud if we if for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world in other words our judgment's not the world judgment if we do the things we're supposed to do wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat terry one for another and if any man hunger lady meet at home that you come not together in the condemnation and the rest will i set an order when i come let's take about a minute you pray the prophet of god says you pray for your pastor but you pray for yourself to get yourself out of the way so that we can take this communion and it'll do something for us lord i pray that this would be not just an event but be an experience that will experience you more lord by taking this communion because it's really communing with you father and now we pray that you sanctify us for this journey bless us in the further melissa service in jesus name we pray amen the bible said he took bread and blessed it the heavenly father we ask that you bless this bread lord that's been made by holy hands and lord that it will be to each one person here lord knowing that your body was broken for us and that now by your stripes we are healed and if there be any infirmary or anything going on in the building or anybody that we even have a thought of lord may you heal them father because by your stripes we're healed lord by your broken body father we ask these things in jesus name amen how many people downstairs don't know you know the catholic church takes this and i don't know who they may buy it from somebody i don't know but they lay it on your tongue and said it's they turn it into the literal body of jesus and i just you see how people believe stuff like that why they've been taught they've never been taught any different they've been taught from their youth but we know different we know better this is symbolics this is to let number one let us know that this has been instituted by god and it's something we're supposed to do if we don't take if we don't take it it shows we got something wrong right and if you're not born again you shouldn't take it because if you take it unworthily you eat and drink damnation to yourself so the bible says that's why the bible says examine yourself because in our own humanity listen folks we're not worthy but i'm worthy because he's worthy because i was chosen in him whatever he had that's what i get right the heavenly father we pray lord that you would bless this wine lord as we partake of it lord may it just be something lord it stimulates not only our inside human self but lord that will stimulate our spirit father that during this week lord we'll come closer to you lord by this communion that we're about to take father forgive us of our sins and bless the congregation in jesus name amen you know some of you see brother mark used to do it brother donnie does it if these pieces of it flip out of the um the bread container when you're snapping it it falls out in different places we believe in making sure all of it gets burnt and there's none held over so that's why that they do what they're doing we appreciate what they do brother mark used to do it now brother donnie's doing it and that's why that we do it because we want to make sure it's all none of it's held over it's all burnt and it's all done away with because you know what tomorrow's a new day tomorrow's new a new opportunity to understand god a new opportunity to understand what god is to you if it's a journey then in a journey what is a journey a journey is an opportunity to learn something every day you're going on a journey since charlotte just got back from sedona in the grand canyon that was a journey and it's places you've never seen before right you can't say that now she's seen sedona she's seen the grand canyon i've been to sedona i've been to the grand canyon um i've been there part of my experience can't never say now that i've never been but it's a beautiful place so what more of god that we're going to take this communion and tomorrow we're going to continue on with god wednesday we're going to continue on with god next sunday we're going to continue on with god every day that we come closer that's why he's talking to sister trudy mcmillan she said you just turned 83 last saturday last saturday 24th whatever 24th is she turned 83 years young i told us you closer that new body than i am brother ray just graduated he is and it's not a new body we know that his ashes are here but his newness of life when he got born again that's what's over there in another dimension thank god for this plan folks i'm telling you there's no man can make this plan and make it work no human man there had to be a flaw somewhere there'd have to be a change that'd have to be an oops moment because you don't know all things but thank god we had a god that knows all things knew which way it was going to go which way as we say in sports which way the ball is going to bounce before you even threw the ball so you could be prepared and be ready and so god was prepared and ready before the foundation of the world for us to go through this and you know what fear not do i have no fear amen please don't fear let's don't fear this thing we call life now remember as soon as we get finished the uh song leaders ministers and deacons need to meet in my son's class please just for go over some things that we're going to change and try i'm trying to get everything back it's kind of normal again just keep praying for the ones we do have brothers and sisters in india that are that are having a hard time with it so and nepal talked to a brother from nepal the other night aaron had him on on facebook live and he he watches our sermons and he's what 10 hours 10 hours ahead of us so he's already into monday but he guarantee you wednesday night he'd watch service didn't he when's your last sunday wednesday 10 hours ahead of us he was already into the next day and he was watching the services so we don't know brother keith iii told us a long time ago he said brother dale he said you're not only preaching to your congregation right he said you're preaching to people all over the world and he's telling the truth so we just don't know how much how this little church impacts all over the world because that brother sure don't fall asleep during service i promise you that my goodness that guy was like a fireball but that's just the way they are when they when you know when the when the lord gets a hold of you you'll know it let's protect the communion thank you lord maybe we'll we'll um assess the situation and maybe next month we can get back to foot washing that'll put us all instituted everything back the bible study we got back again we were like i said there were 30 people there uh my room was full still wore a mask but we were good and we had a good time we were there for two hours usually we can't usually we're not sitting around not saying anything somebody's asking a question somebody's got a concern and we're able to air those out and and in an environment where you can say hold on what'd you just say what are you talking about will you say that one more time i wouldn't mind you do that here but it caused a lot of confusion maybe sometimes when people didn't understand then you'd have to hold the service up for a minute so let's let's set aside that time of bible study the first saturday of every month to do that between six and eight o'clock so god bless you we love you with the love of the lord thank you for all the smiling faces and and all the people that you prepared yourself for this day now we're gonna go um meet the devil monday and remember me tuesday also like i said it's just a exam i've never had before and being 61 you know how they want the they want you to uh make sure everything's okay so uh it'll be a routine examination and we'll uh but just still keep any prayer that everything goes everything goes well because they do have to knock you out so praise god so uh but remember richard richards richard roberts is like yep i'm so glad they do that knock you out so we pray that everything goes well and god bless you let's bow our heads dear lord thank you for this day that you give us we've instituted many things today titling offering singing special singing reading of scripture preaching of the word now we took communion lord now i pray that you just rejuvenate us lord for the rest of the week lord before we
