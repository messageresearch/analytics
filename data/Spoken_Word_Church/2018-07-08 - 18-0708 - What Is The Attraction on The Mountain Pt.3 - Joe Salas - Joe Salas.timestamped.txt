[2:10] it's our daily walk you know see we're
[2:14] not all I'm saying level everybody's in
[2:16] that different level you know but we

[2:57] in this book Exodus 3 chapter 3 and the
[3:02] start of it first one through 15
[3:09] [Applause]
[3:12] now Moses kept the clock jetrel Hispano
[3:18] the priests immediately made human
[3:21] priests
[3:22] so whatever the Moses wanted to do he
[3:26] would not push him or do what he let him
[3:28] do whatever whatever mostly wanted to do
[3:30] and he meant to fall to the back side of
[3:33] the desert and came to the mountain of
[3:36] God even to a barrel and the angel of
[3:39] the Lord appeared unto him and they find
[3:41] my father out of the midst of a bush and
[3:44] he looked and behold the bush farm with
[3:47] fire and the bush was not consumed and
[3:50] mother said I will not turn outside and
[3:53] see this great sight why the bush is not
[3:56] burning and when the North so that he
[4:00] turn aside to see God called him God
[4:03] called him I haven't messed with the
[4:06] butcher said Moses Moses and he said
[4:08] Here I am and he said growing up hither
[4:13] put up thy shoes from my feet for the
[4:16] place where the standard is holy ground
[4:20] moreover he said I am the God of the
[4:22] father the God of Abraham Isaac and
[4:25] Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was
[4:29] afraid to look upon God and the Lord
[4:32] said I had surely seen the affliction of
[4:35] my people to which I need you
[4:37] and have heard their cry because the
[4:39] reason of their taskmasters for northern
[4:42] sorrows and I come down to deliver them
[4:44] out of a Hanna Egyptian stick to bring
[4:47] them up out of the land into a good man
[4:51] and order into the land flowing with
[4:54] milk and honey unto the priests of the
[4:56] Canaanites and hypnotize MRIs and all

[5:05] the children of immigrants is come unto
[5:07] me I have also seen the oppression were
[5:10] the Egyptians oppress them come now
[5:13] therefore now the same being to parody
[5:15] them and bring forth my people but
[5:19] Israel out of Egypt and Moses said unto
[5:21] God Who am I that I should go unto
[5:24] Pharaoh and that I should bring for the
[5:27] children for it
[5:29] for the children of Israel out of Egypt
[5:32] and he said certainly I will be mean I
[5:37] show this should be a token of to be
[5:39] that have sandy point that has brought
[5:42] for the people either you should serve
[5:45] God upon this mountain we should serve
[5:48] God upon this mountain the mountain they
[5:51] were climbing and Moses said I've
[5:58] developed before when I commented
[5:59] children Israel I said unto them the god
[6:02] of your father's has sent me unto you
[6:05] and they shall said to me what is his
[6:07] name what shall stand to them and God
[6:09] said unto Moses I am that I am and he
[6:13] said thus shalt thou say unto the
[6:15] children of Israel I am hath sent me
[6:20] unto you and God said moreover unto
[6:24] Moses thus shalt thou say unto children
[6:30] Israel day nor that your father the God
[6:33] of Abraham the god
[6:34] and Jacob sent sent me unto you this is
[6:40] my name forever and this is my memorial
[6:42] unto all generation like I said before
[6:50] Moses father-in-law was a priest he then
[6:53] I pushed Moses into whatever you know it
[6:58] it's your daily walk do you a God Exodus
[7:03] 4:18 and most of my night and return to
[7:08] generous father mom said unto him let me
[7:11] go are Tralee and returned unto my
[7:14] brethren which I need to and see whether
[7:16] they be alive and gentle said up to
[7:19] Moses go in peace amen
[7:26] let's go to Exodus 19 three and four
[7:41] chapter xix three and multi went up and
[7:45] to God and the Lord called him a lot of
[7:47] the mountain saying does not shalt say
[7:50] unto the house of Jacob I tell the
[7:52] children of Israel you have seen what I
[7:54] did until Egyptians and how I bore you
[7:57] on eagle's wings and I brought you unto
[8:00] myself
[8:10] this sounds the 1:03 let's start with
[8:24] first one to 22 and then I'll read the
[8:28] first when you go to read the second one
[8:33] I need less than or to hold my soul and
[8:46] then I within me bless His Holy Name
[9:02] forgive all thine iniquities who healeth
[9:05] all thy diseases which says by that
[9:15] month with good things so that thy youth
[9:17] is renewed like the Eagles dessicated
[9:22] righteousness
[9:25] [Music]
[9:26] you mean all these ways unto Moses he's
[9:29] excellent to the children of Israel
[9:32] demerit older than gracious name amazing
[9:37] that mercy he will not always shy even
[9:41] keep peace anger forever for as the
[9:52] headlight is high above the earth so is
[9:55] bringing this mercy toward them that
[9:56] fear him and as far as the east is from
[10:00] the west so far has he removed our
[10:03] transgressions from us like a father
[10:08] pities his children so the Lord pities
[10:10] them they fear Him as for man his days
[10:19] are as crass as a flower of the field so
[10:22] he pours
[10:32] but the mercy of the Lord is from
[10:34] everlasting to everlasting upon them
[10:37] they fear him and his right side up to
[10:39] its children the Lord had prepared his
[10:51] tawny heaven and his keys words let's
[11:06] see the Lord only the horse you
[11:08] ministers of if that do displeasure the
[11:12] Lord always works not a place of instant
[11:16] I wrote a little people one time about
[11:34] Eagles say but the Eagle builds a nest
[11:45] 10,000 feet high on the cleft of the
[11:48] wall what is the price right which the
[11:52] type of Christian would either have an
[11:54] understanding the Jesus Christ is God in
[11:57] flashing upon this rock Jesus built his
[12:01] church
[12:05] now I said I think he both eight times
[12:08] more powerful than man they evil is car
[12:10] only to set up IVs once that is for
[12:14] fight and the other one injures to
[12:15] Friday they click into their son but not
[12:18] as many as complain in Palestine there
[12:22] are 40 types of evil and for centuries
[12:25] of evil have been recognized by many
[12:27] nations kingdoms and empires as a team
[12:30] approach the eagle is a sign of freedom
[12:33] strength immortality and authority man
[12:36] has reproduced an image of the evil and
[12:39] point and the skills and play the evil
[12:43] is a heavenly birth so what are we
[12:46] worried good
[12:47] we're not chicken
[12:53] you can fly see part of the under I know
[12:57] the other part the chicken is the verb
[12:59] justify evil who is but is it is an
[13:03] earthbound creature he can fluff and
[13:06] claw but it can scarcely get his feet
[13:08] off the ground and Peter said unto them
[13:10] repent and be baptized every one of you
[13:14] in the name of Jesus Christ but they
[13:15] were mention our sins and you shall
[13:17] receive that gift of the Holy Ghost

[13:35] did have it was one they fun is picking

[13:40] on him because they said he was an odd
[13:42] fellow when the Eagle is
[13:45] is one of his birth sir that was seen
[13:47] until they reached about that and then a
[13:49] month then they are one of the most
[13:52] beautiful birthday that ever seen they
[13:54] one day the mother Eagle look over the
[13:58] bar she looked down and she saw her

[32:21] of the amount of other is due to an
[32:23] earthquake and this is confirmed by the
[32:25] Isaiah 26 629 6 and revelation 6 being 9
[32:31] exactly what is the same prophet all of
[32:35] the first coming seeing his second
[32:37] coming
