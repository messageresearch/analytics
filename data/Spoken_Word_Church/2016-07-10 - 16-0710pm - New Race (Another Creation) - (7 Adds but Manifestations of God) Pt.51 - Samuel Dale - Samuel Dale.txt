«  48       †        In the days of--of Paul, the angel of the church at Ephesus, Paul, founding this church, being the messenger to it... Remember, Paul, founding the church at Ephesus, become the messenger to that church, and the Spirit was in the land at that time was a lion spirit. And the lion is the Lion of the tribe of Juda which is Christ, and Christ is the Word. Paul, with the Word of that age...
Thousands fell asleep in that age. That right? Then come the next age, and the--the time the church got settled down in--in dark age, the ox spirit went forth: work, labor, and sacrifice and give their lives. Thousands times thousands fell asleep under martyrdom and everything. They're waiting. See?

«  50       †        Then, and the next age come, the Lutheran, the reform age. There went the wise with the cunningness of man. If you notice, man went forth with that, and when he did, he added his own shrewdness. That's what married him into the other part. See, see? If he'd just stayed with God's wisdom, just reforming and pulling out... But what did he do? After that man that had the message, Luther, after the death of Luther, they had a Lutheran organization. After the death of Wesley, they had a Methodist organization. See? There... You keep going that way. It--it just... It does that.
    Now, I want you to--to--to notice this. See? Now, someone might ask about the Pentecostal, which was the--the third age.

«  52       †        You see, each one of those ages only taken a dip into the Holy Spirit. Justification is a work of the Holy Spirit; sanctification is a work of the Holy Spirit, but the baptism is the Holy Spirit.
    That's the reason it took a prophetic prophet to come down, no messenger to the age, 'cause the Holy Ghost came Himself in His fullness of the baptism. But at the end of the age, as it always ends upon the others, we find there then, the messenger sent; and all th...

generally forget something but enjoyed all of that singing you had that was real good all right Revelations 3:14 and 2 Peter 1 1-8 then let's pray before we read our scriptures father we thank you because we know and realize what the prophet has said no one has a right to open the book or to try to read off the pages of it until we've asked permission from the author so we we thank you Lord and we ask you to just come now open our understanding the word is already anointed we know that so we just want to be anointed to hear and anointed to speak so just have your way with each one as we listen and pay attention to you forgive our sins lead us by thy Grace and love and bless each one remember the sick ones Among Us you promised it we seen it there Wednesday night Lord when you came down right while brother Aaron was ministering and delivered in things and we look forward to that God it's always right there in your word we love you and we thank you have your way and guide us in Jesus name amen andto the angel of the Church of the lady oans WR these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God all right now we go over to Second Peter 1 Simon Peter servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto all things all things that pertain into life and godliness through the knowledge of him now watch it's through the knowledge or revelation of him that has called us to glory and virtue whereby are given to us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this besides escaping it besides coming into the body all beside this giv all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity or love for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now not to uh back up into this morning much but to um make sure you follow our thought pattern of what we're talking about so that it will go right on into uh this message this afternoon we were talking about looking at the Statue of a perfect man and looking at things and remember now your Prophet said it I didn't he said if you don't understand your mathematics of the Bible that you're missing it all right so he'll give the numbers three and he'll say that's like father son Holy Ghost is perfection you know think he'll even use seven is completion seven is perfection uh 12 is worship he said if you don't understand the mathematical parts of your Bible he said then you'll miss it and you'll get the wrong thing onto the wrong place so I'm not a mathematician but the the Bible is perfect in it being revealed that's right about the mathematics now not to just look at it and well I found this you know there's people that argue in the message you know over the fact of a number four being an antichrist number well that's true it is it's an antichrist number you know uh youve coming down to your uh false prophet and things you know and bees and come out to four but remember it's also a number for restoration justification sanation baptism Holy Ghost and reveal word see so it's whatever you're using it for and you're not using mathematics to just show how smart you are mathematically because you will miss it that way but to speak about the things of God to come out to the right numbers and all and I if you if you miss anything in the message remember one thing we cannot bring any thought through the word now listen you can't bring any thought through the word of God and stop on a number seven if that's as far as you can go is a number seven you do not have eternal life that you're talking about if you stop on the number seven right your Prophet said it's the Millennium is even still under time right the Millennium is still under the number seven am amen so then you know you can't do it you got to bring it to a number eight to bring it to Eternity to to break make it work sevens are great because they are for the time right all right but then you got to take it to a number eight for your understanding and all but remember now uh like Wade was bringing out on the the message there of the Daniel 70 week see Israel never celebrated the 50th Jubilee they didn't celebrate anything hardly because they were in captivity most of the time and they couldn't celebrate other than their own little household celebration but see there's got to be something for Israel to take her to that part all right now keep that in mind because that'll be the point want to be dealing with now remember what we were talking about this morning we were talking about the the pyramid and looking back at the pyramid and we we look at it and I asked you the question the other day why would brother brandham put Holy Spirit here when it doesn't list it that way in the Bible it says faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and love but yet he put the emphasis on it to bring it to show in the Holy Spirit and that's perfect it was right so you know he he was emphasizing to me the point of bringing it to a great Revelation and I hope you followed it this morning in our little drawing our little illustration and we'll read another quote or two so if you will Brothers pull up the one with the first one with the kind of dots in it and things and let's look at it because I as One True Believer I believe in the Seal of God Amen and I believe when you're born again at Faith at Faith you are sealed in right Amen to the body of Christ can never be taken out can't be removed there's no way nothing can remove the person that's sealed by the Holy Spirit that's right all right amen but then that doesn't give you everything into manifestation it doesn't give you anything to bring into life you know the point it gives you eternal life all right but yet it needs these things and we are required to have these virtues all right that is not my thoughts that's your Prophet these are required virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness all that is required of you and I now especially this age because this is the age that they're going to be very vital to understand these things about these virtues because the prophet of God said talking of the ages and he's talking about the messengers and the ages and the Seven Church ages that's in your uh statue of a perfect man and he said as he brings the church then he will bring bring the individuals or individual to bring the church all right and see then if he bring in the church you know as a whole a unit will come up and there will be a Rapture he said and he said with these things here in the ages it'll bring a church a bride to a Rapture and he said in these virtues you remember reading that these virtues brings the person to the place place to be raptured am all right now so then it's very vital to understand it's a necessity so you say what's going to be the Rapture brother Dale these virtues that's right now you tell me something else irregardless of what you want to count it to be of this or that or the other or whatever you want a call to go with it it would have to still come back to being these virtues brought in to an individual we'll bring that individual and count that individual off and that will be a living moving Idol of God or instrumentality of God all right and the church ages with these virtues would come to a place to bring it down to a change of the body all right so now the holy spirit is your seal but now notice brother Adam wrote Holy Spirit between there that you know that I remember thinking on that I preached this many many years ago and many many times so it's not a new thing or a thought but I remember when I first begin to look at those things and look at it and say well you know there's some reason there there's some reason why he would write Holy Spirit and draw it out that way because remember he's the prophet all and he would he made the draw in the way he wanted it all right and we can't question why he would make those things all right cuz come on listen look behind me and read it pull it back up on there where you can read it and and just you know where they can can see it you see look Faith virtue knowledge temper Fai God his brother kind Holy Spirit it doesn't list Holy Spirit in the Bible the prophet told you what it was he told you what's going to seal it what's going to seal these virtues is the Holy Spirit and he's not making two people out of it so in a minute we'll read it God coming down through Christ Holy Spirit seals these things into you that's right see he's right then he knew what was doing he was telling us what would bring us to eternal life all right see then you don't have to take that out because if you're counting you got one two 3 5 6 7 8 n you say well what no don't take it out just let this and this all be become one and let all of this become one as the Seal of God then you only have the eight things right see then you have faith knowledge temp Pati God and the love of God which is a whole thing all right so it's was emphasizing it when you use you get to New Birth see this line solid this is still J rip down there all right now bring it on up for another point to seal this one in see when he seal that in it's sealed in you say well brother brother I'm right up here well what about this down here I don't know about that but I'm up in here well now I wouldn't have want that said it you read it I've got them laying here or they're laying in the office brother Brandon says it'll crumble if it ain't sealed in it'll crumble so you say well I'm sealed in Brother D right up here is where I'm sealed in this is the individual this is not the age that's right all right see you say well I'm sealed in here and then you got problems in between here these could even be sealed in here but you got a problems in between that it can crumble amen so why not do it the way the prophet does just in the in the Bible does it add to your faith virtue it didn't say it into brotherly kindness and it says faith virtue knowledge each one coming up if you went down to a certain uh group of people today they call that a starcase lecture do you know that there's a a group that uses that right there and they call it a staircase lecture don't throw off on nobody they got some good points you but listen see as each one comes forth and sealed in there's no way to you take that out you might think you're up in here and crumble back but you're only going to go to where the seal is so let that seal keep coming up so just going up through there Brothers you got it see each one is just sealed in there's no way to take that out now sealed in but watch the point now that I didn't get to this morning bring it on up okay now you got that sealed in there's no way for any of this to be taken out but you do have one thing that's got to be done you got to finish this part up to where you can't take nothing out of it you know how you build up things and you bring it up and you leave little flange the prophet spoke of blasphemian n or rock box and then you set this top he said it's not just a platform cuz you set the platform across you can take out but once that top is set down on that church there's no way to get nothing out of here that is Christ amen the manifestation amen that is him living in you and me all we got to do is just not try to go up or down just fill in the sides with your rock box that your sister spoke of in her dream that would come up into here and go over and then this comes down into here and then you don't move them just leave them right there just draw in the sides line all right now we'll you say well is that true okay let's read it okay we're going back to this morning and get these two or three out of the way then we'll continue on cuz I know that I will will not complete this message this afternoon it will be have to be into Wednesday possibly even next Sunday but see here's the thing that I wanted the points I wanted to read go back to number I gave you those Brothers 1 2 3 4 go back to the number one okay which is paragraph 140 141 of the stature of a perfect man now look what he says that Big Stone come by picked it up that big maget Stone picked it up you remember now you remember this morning I quoted it brother BR says we got to be magnetized to The Headstone not just stuck or anything the cement not just the cement to put on something each one becomes vulcanized to the other one all right then when you do look what you got we got to be magnetized to that headstone that headstone is the Holy Ghost Christ and every one of us has got the magnetism of the Holy Spirit when that stone strikes the image the church will flee to it back into Glory she'll be taken up in the Rapture of the Saints When She Goes Forth through that day all right now we got to be magnetized to it all of it's got to be stuck together all of it's got to be the same material you don't add Rubber and metal you can't vulcanize that we know the old vulcanized patch we used to put on the tubes it was burnt together to you that don't know anything about it it was burnt together and then each the the tube and the patch would become bonded which meant they were of the same material and the heat just bonded them together well all the heat the devil can put on you and I all he's doing is just bonding us more to God that's right right let him pour it on brother R said the church always does better what under persecution but see you mention persecution well you think he going through the tribulation I didn't say that your Prophet has said we don't go through the tribulation but we do have persecution right all right now watch let's go on to the next one then this is from Blasphemous 's paragraph uh let's see what I may have give it to you on the opposite do it that's okay we'll use that this is three 20 39 329 okay said right in there listen watch him as he brings it forth right in here right in here you see I got it between all these Works in here he's talking about the virtues right and here are these little waves comes you remember the sister the water was washing down in the waves what is that the holy ghost coming down through Christ see Holy Spirit the holy spirit is above all this watch it no wonder he put it there the Holy Spirit read the quote now the holy spirit is above all this watch welding the together building a what you say well that's all of it it's just the Holy Ghost that's coming you didn't read building what a perfect church for the Capstone to cap it off now you see why you got Holy Spirit written in there see he's right holy spirit amen Christ coming down the holy ghost coming down through Christ on your pyramid one coming down through the other see but not being two Gods this is all magnetized remember I told you this morning we are all magnetized To The Head and the head is what's pulling you right ever born again believer ever born again believer is being pulled upward I read you're being pulled downward right right right ever born again believer it don't matter whether you think they're United to it or what it's pulling you the day you was born again it started pulling you upward right amen Christ leading us but look he's welding us to Holy Spirit welding it together a perfect church for the Capstone to cap it off he's not making it two different things love is the seal amen but the holy spirit is the seal Love Is The Virtue the holy spirit is not a virtue or it would have been listed as a virtue the prophet is showing you how it seals in now watch it love is a virtue what do you love is a virtue it is all the virtues are you with me the Capstone is all the virtues on a regular pyramid pull the pyramid up and you'll see what I'm talking about cuz we talked about this many many times before if it's draw correctly and built correctly that stone will fit right here right you understand what I said if it's drawn the way that it's built this Stone will fit right here it also fit right over there in this headstone is all the virtues of almighty God right because it's love and that's what he is right can't you see then what's pulling you yes am if all of the virtues are here all of these virtues would be up there pulling you but this is me and you coming up this way we got to come slow and gradual right but in him is everything all right now do you understand why I said it the way I did this morning then we're sealed in by the baptism of the Holy Ghost to give us a new birth but then as each virtue is brought forth and the Holy Spirit seals it in and remember he ain't going to seal it in until he knows it's right you right see that's why we with those yarded lines I had it so you can come up to here and you can get from up into here why would your Prophet come in the message and say godliness and said look said you come all this way until God expects you he don't expect you to be perfect till you come up to here you remember that the other week I read the stature of a perfect man study it amen think about it of what it's being said well I'm I'm in the message you ain't in the message if you don't know what the messenger talk what message you talking about the only way you can be in the message is for the message to be in you right but see then as each one of these is brought into US is tempering it together sealing it together just don't try to lower the headstone CU you'd be fitting right there that's right leave it where it's at right and let the Holy Ghost that's here in this part that we' call Christ just fill in the sides and join together let Christ and man become one that's right what did he say in blasphemia name he said no wonder the Holy Ghost has not been taught correctly he said right right but see when we and the Holy Ghost become one there's our problem we don't think that can ever be right well in a way now I guess you could say the Bride In Christ are one with that that ain't in the Bible that's right you got that out of gre's Almanac or somewhere off of Facebook you didn't get it reading the Bible you know what I mean Facebook somebody else is gabbing and get okay you know we're not perfect like I said the other day this book bumper sticker I'm not perfect I'm just forgiven if you're forgiven you never done it right come on in God if you're forgiven you never done it well if you never done it you can't be counted guilty you're perfect we better get down to studying how to make us be not guilty that's right now I only know one way to be not guilty because there ain't nobody and I ain't going to stand up here and tell you and I can read from Brother brandom anything you want on that very point where you're talking about be therefore perfect he said do we sin he said every day so now he's not saying if you ever notied one scripture and I know it's going to hit you hard but you know that Jesus was the one that said there's none good no not one come on he's the one who said it he said there's none good no not one you say are you trying to say Jesus were sinful no I'm saying he was a man I'm saying he was a man and that problems right come on Church get with it it's time to either get it or get out of it cuz we're running out of time right feely out of time okay but look now think about it all of these virtues then are of the same material right and they can be vulcanized together and they're are all the same that they can be magnetic you know magnetism we read it this morning all right that headstone is the Holy Ghost and every one of us that's got the magnetism of the Holy Spirit when that stone strikes the image the church will flee to it back into the glory we read it just a minute ago taken from what the 70th week of Daniel we got to be magnetized to The Headstone now how are you magnetized to The Headstone it's got to be the same material that's right so you can go through and figure out all these things everything else and you're going to miss the point of what because that's what people would do they sit and figure out everything while you're talking and they don't realize what you're saying they missed the whole point all right but listen if it's all the same material it can be vulcanized together so it's his faith his virtue his knowledge Temperance patience Godly brotherly kindness and love right It All Belongs to him given unto you amen and to bring you forth into what you're supposed to be the prophet said on the statute of a perfect man paragraph 142 have faith and be born again add to your faith virtue right add to your faith virtue y all right now I've been saying it over and over so you already to know what I'm going to say faith is not a virtue it doesn't say add Faith it's the prophet explains it that Peter is saying those of light precious Faith have faith and be born again there's your new birth there's your sealed in to the body of Christ all right because it's his faith all right but faith is not a virtue it is Christ himself that's right all right but then you add virture knowledge temper fa is godliness and when you do you come out to the right one cuz then you add to your faith virtue and The Virtue knowledge remember how it was and watch him now go ahead and pull this up cuz that's the point we're going to start from pull up number four which is paragraph 65 of blasphemian 9es first fundamentally excuse me first foundationally and he said is Faith second add to your faith virtue and your virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance from Temperance to patience patience to Godliness godliness Brotherly Love brotherly kindness and then love being the Capstone seven of those things are you reading he just named eight did you count it face secondly Fai he's not two fath now Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly love you're not repeating the thing and in love being in the hedone that's seven things he says why is it look at your pyramid draw the pyramid back up because it's easier to see this one than it is back in the corner 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 eight that's right well I don't think we need to know this you've been 50 years listening to blabber mouse that don't know what they're talking about that's right you could at least sit down and W listen just a little bit and say why what why are these things all right we haven't taken out the Holy Spirit we've made the Holy Spirit the whole thing so then it's not nine things by counting the holy spirit is eight things but what is the man talking about he goes on to the message the statue of perfect man and he's bringing down and naming these he said seven things Faith virtue knowledge Temperance then the love of God keep it down under there okay CU we're going to need that more than we need this part up here pull it back to the pyramid go remember now he says there's seven things seven what if faith is not an ad you got one add two add three add four five add six eight seven seven things go face not an ad you got seven ads well oh well let's just prove this pull it back to number six now we're going to flip-flop between those two so keep your finger on the button Brother Anderson look on the message God's only provided place of worship 1965 1128 and look what he says coming down but the headstone was rejected messenger John the Baptist introduc the king but the headstone was rejected and they don't know the stone of scrone or whatever it is they don't know where it's at because it's a rejected Stone but that's the stone that caps the whole thing that makes it the pyramid through the complete seven Church ages adding Grace adding this adding this and there are seven ads the last one is Christ so there's seven ads virtue faith is not an ad that's right that's a birth so you going to catch it in the minute why I said that while ago when you come to that headstone it's got everything in it but it's an ad why because it's never been here in nobody but two people the Lord Jesus had it I believe brother brandom had that headstone I don't believe he he could have told us about it if he didn't have it right right I believe that see I put it in the place that I believe it because Peter couldn't tell you how to come up the statue of perfect man if he didn't have it right amen you know what brother Brown said it took him to get to where he could preach statute for man 33 years and what did he say on that he said I just got the other the day how this ties in right here to something I was going to preach go back to the old message of this 56 uh intervail was the old title and look and see if he wasn't talking about a living moving instrumentality of God walking in you but he didn't know about these things here he said so he must have grow in Grace and knowledge but now he says there's seven ads and Christ being the seventh one so let's read one more cuz these two is vital to the point let's read number seven which is is this the sign of the end sir the the Holy Spirit kept off the individual and sealed it when we added to our faith righteousness and godliness faith and so forth and kept adding to it till we got seven things and the seventh one was love which is God all right this may not mean a thing in the world to you and the way some of your faces look it probably don't you wonder what in the world of man talking about talking about the Simple Plan of Redemption why would your Prophet say certain things if you have the revelation of what he said is there any problem with you saying it draw back to the pyramid now and you look at it and you see it love being the seventh the Bible says faith now you count them as we go up virtue knowledge temper godl you know patience God in his brotherly kindness and love that's seven things when I remember the story we started if all you can take is a number seven you've got your rest you got all your types your shadows enti our Bible is tied to a number seven which is completion now most of you that are read enough you remember on a little message called future home brother Brandon was tapping it as he was bringing it down tapping and coming down and he knew what they were thinking he said now you say right said what are you going to do now brother brandom because you run out of numbers you know why they were saying that because that's all the numbers mankind knew right that's all mankind could teach on a seven right he said no he said I hav't run out of numbers said I've got one more anyway to the number eight and he declared the number eight to represent eternity now we don't get this to be a number eight we're cutting ourselves short am CU if you're looking at the pyramid and now if you'll think sensible there's eight things but there's only seven ads right Peter's got eight things but he's only got seven ads because faith is not an ad it's not a virtue it's a birth you got to have the ver the birth before you can start right okay but there's eight things listed Seven is a number of completion as I said until brother brandham came mankind spoke of the number seven and that was the height of their understanding over in the Book of Revelations it mentions it three times it tells you in the Book of Revelations three times it talks about the seven spirits of God there's not seven spirits of God are they your Prophet said no he said it's the one Holy Spirit manifesting itself through seven Church a Messengers right he said this not seven spirits he said there's one Holy Spirit I've got these here if you need them it's off the message called a sardian church age yes the spirit is not not seven spirits but one it goes down to sardian church age that was uh 250 251 he covers it so we see that the seven spirits actually refer to the one spirit of God working out the will and word word of God in different Generations okay seven different times off the sardian church AG's message paragraphs 73 seven different times the Holy Spirit would anoint a messenger okay what about it so do you see what I'm trying to get you to look at ads R Run's right they seven ads Peter's is right and brother Brand's right there's eight manifestations then he said he brings a in the individual this is off the statue of perfect man right there he said he brings the individual and said the same way he brings the church that's right through seven Church ages now I said we're going to go so far I'm going to cut this deliberately and leave it because I cannot finish the message because it'll take too long if y'all want to stay till 5:00 we'll go ahead but now here's an individual that there's seven ads to that individual the Bible said I didn't add to your faith virtue knowledge temper those are virtues right the last one to be added is The Headstone right remember your disciples only got right here with the greatest they had of Paul and Peter and them cuz the headstone was rejected now may I quote brother brandom again he said it will come back in the end time it was rejected by there I've had arguments with people over this I these ain't no these saying arguments cuz there ain't no argument to it and I've had a lot of say you mean to Paul Paul didn't have the headstone I didn't say it brother random did right well I ain't found a quote no there's no quote that says Paul Never Had The Headstone y but you show me one where he did have it remember he got to right here that headstone was rejected back there you remember what I was saying this morning was you listening yes what is the headstone to the church the revealed word of God right whatever you want to call anything else it's a reveal word of God remember Jesus preached six in Matthew 24 and not one disciple understood what he was talking about amen not one disciple understood those were the seals of Matthew 24 to put in Revelation 6 not one disciple ever spoke of the son of man but the first thing brother brownon spoke when he started yeah that's right I've checked it out I haven't found it in 47 you got the computers you can run it and see when he first started but you know yourself that immediately in his ministry he started talking about the son of man right remember he had the sign of the son of man yep which was the sign of the Resurrection amen physically and spiritually brother R's the one that said The Headstone was rejected what was The Headstone what if those disciples we know it was the story it was meant to be but what if those disciples had have accepted all that Jesus said you and I wouldn't be here plain language amen he was d right we thank the word world is what turned him down them disciples never knew what he was talking about why because they did not have the Holy Spirit as a New Birth by not having it as a new birth they had no inside teacher that's right that's right there stood The Headstone you got to admit Christ is The Headstone you got to admit the Bible the stone that was rejected becomes the head of the corner that's right uh did it remind me that what it go brother dick used to talk about this long time ago headstone Cornerstone Sunstone it's just according to what you're using that's right this could not be put into the disciples why because it was rejected what was it put in the disciples the full understanding of the word of God amen if it had it been you wouldn't needed a prophit in the last days that's right I told you it'll be Wednesday I got to finish on you know brother Brown's message didn't begin y when he first started that's right man come on it's in the future I mean it's in the Rapture message I got the others laying on the desk okay I didn't bring them cuz I afraid I get started on it brother brother said not in years of preparation not in years when he began to S but said he went declared his message until 1963 brother random was doing a work of restoration that's right restoring back to the faith of the fathers 63 the sealed open his message went end eternal life we'll get to that Wednesday but I want you to think as the individual comes up so does the church come up right now we've declared the reason that the prophet would write Holy Spirit I forget I got it over here forget the reason that he would write this in would be to show us this Holy Spirit would seal all of this in this is the holy spirit this as well all of that would be the holy spirit it's his faith his is not given to you am okay everybody understand that so then when you take that Holy Spirit make it all you don't count it but you got seven ads and you got eight things to be dealt with right I didn't say eight virtues you only have seven virtues that's right that's the key to the whole thing you only have seven Church ages right you don't have eight Church ages there's no such thing as an eth Church age but some of you older ones remember there was a Doctrine back there called The Eighth Day that we're already living in the Eighth Day we're already in eternity no you're still under a seven physically we're under a seven physically people will be in the Millennium under a seven but the bride will be there Body Spirit and soul with eternal life already into the eth The Eighth Day don't come until the future home amen there a lot to be preached you think sometimes that I drag out I wish you'd see me like this morning I said No Need No need no need I can't bring that I feel the trash can up with quotes from R brandom because I'd never be able to bring it you think I'm slow now I'm just trying to get you to see something well I don't understand he got a 70 got an 80 got then you don't understand eternal life amen that's right when that Holy Ghost came into your soul it didn't put it in a seven that was only the types of the Old Testament of the rest not only spoke of the Holy Ghost the rest Jesus said come unto me all you ever heav L I'll give you a number eight into your soul that's see they thought seven seven seven seven it's all right then if faith is not an ad then you got seven ads that will bring the headstone to the church well brother Dale now you're facing something cuz you're facing a situation that you just said the prophet said as the individual is built so is the ages built so we got by virtue of being a part of God starting from we got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 we got it past completion Church ages now how are you going to bring that in the church ages I won't try to we'll just let brother brandham do it okay cuz they ain't got no sense to sense didn't figure it out either okay let's go to number 16 you'll see we jumped a long ways back before then to make sure you don't get lost on what I'm talking about he says the last quote we gave you from the sardian church age 1960 1209 that there's seven different times the Holy Spirit would anoint a messenger yep right now how many Messengers are they how many Church age angels does it list seven right right all right now we got to have seven Messengers that'll fit identically with the seven ads amen but we got to have eight manifestations or else I'm wrong so let's let brother brandom say it go to number 16 all we on it start off at 50 he talks about the martyrdoms and how they're waiting then in the next Age come the Lutheran the reformer age they went to wise with the cunningness and coming down they married and come on down after the death of Wesley they had a Methodist organization there you keep going that way it's just it does that and I want you to notice see that someone might ask about this Pentecostal which was the third age now you know what he's talking about Pentecostal is not the third age Pentecost to the seventh age right so now you know what he's talking about he's talking about the third age coming forth from the three of justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost everybody with me amen we got enough sense to know that he ain't messed up so justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost I give you another quote want it you can find it brother R said the last three messages of the last three ages completed the birth so now he's talking about the Pentecostals look you see each one of those ages only taking a dip into the Holy Spirit justification is the work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism is the holy spirit watch him now I didn't write the book you want to quit reading come on that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet to come down oh that's brother brandom finish reading right finish reading that ain't brother brandom that's right he says it I didn't that's right that's the reason it took a prophetic he's talking about ausa street right that's right Pentecostal ausa Street that's right 1906 right amen that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet to come down no Messenger to the age because the Holy Ghost came himself in his fullness of the baptism oh now you see why I have to lay aside a lot you realize what that would take hours to explain do you realize that most people you know that one big brother stood right here he's supposed to not be able to preach era and he said that Pentecost was false now we've got to takee we no we don't don't go he destroyed all the old I ain't worried about it cuz I heard him two times he said it right down at Lula Georgia I mean Gillsville Georgia as was eating supper and when he said that I said brother brandham said that the zeusa street at the baptism of the Holy Ghost just exactly like the day of Pentecost that's right amen yes sir he never took no correction he come right here and said ausa Street was false now brother random just said the Holy Ghost came on ausa Street in the fullness of the baptism that's right y you see what church you think I'm hateful you go ahead you think ofus Street didn't have nothing because brother so and so said he didn't have it well he ain't slept with the prophet I don't care I don't care if he's the son of the Prophet that's right if he said something contrary to the prophet that's right I'm going to take the prophet amen you can do what you want to but look you said well that was brother brand no read it that's right that's a readon it took a prophetic Prophet to come down no Messenger to the AG cuz the Holy Ghost came himself in his fullness of the baptism what but at the end of the age as it always ends upon the others we find in there the messenger sent and all these Scruples and things are to be placed in their places like then the Rapture comes from the church amen what age is brother brandham the pastor of according to I thank you go along brother BR in the church a book said this messenger Malachi 4 will do two things one turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers two reveal the Thunders which are the Revelation contain in the Seven Seals it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truth that literally turn the church back somebody find I had the number okay I'll hit it in a minute don't worry about it it's laying in there but it's true anyway amen that's right I'll be glad to do it you just anywhere in the world send me a notice I'll tell you where it's at but why don't you save yourself a time and look it up why hadn't you read it oh but we're in the message what message see brother brandham come at the End of the Age Now what age did he come at the end of okay remember that's questions and answers only the seals that I just read from preached in 1963 324 what it is the morning service questions and answers he just said that but I just can't see how zeusa Street was anything brother brandom said it was the restoration of the gifts and that's all people wants to take gifts he just called it the person of the Holy Ghost in the fullness of his baptism a prophetic Prophet you me zeusa street was a prophetic Prophet yes sir because it was the person of Jesus Christ no messenger now you're going to have to listen no Messenger to isusa Street you can't make it come out right you take the oneeyed black man and make him a messenger brother brandham says he was the messenger of isusa street now you got eight angels if you make the oneeyed man on the zeusa street that form of a messenger it was the Holy Ghost on ausa street I just read it that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet see but the baptism is the holy spirit that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet to come down you realize the Holy Ghost is the prophet do I need those quotes for you I remember the first time we were sitting in Jeffersonville Indiana it had to be 1968 there was an argument back then over who was going to take over who is going to be the leader who is going to be the Holy Ghost to lead us through Billy Paul got up and read a quote from Brother brandom Where the Holy Ghost is the messenger of this age if you think I'm doing the way with brother brandham you tell me I'm reading exactly what he says he's the one that's putting it in charge right putting it in its place watching just in case you keep on and want to run off with it brother brand on the questions and answers in 1963 324 pull number 18 up we're going to jump 17 and go to 18 and the man of the seventh angel messenger where's he going to come at the end of the lady oan age Elijah of Malachi 4 was to come at the end of the seventh Church age okay now before I get to it Wednesday night just remember all the messengers comes the end of the age that's right there's only seven angels but there's eight manifestations of God in those seven Church ages that's what I'm trying to get you to see there's only seven virtues to add the virtues but there eight manifestations in the person from Faith virtue knowledge temper patience godliness brother kindness and love turned out to be eight manifestations in your life the church ages is identical you have eight manifestations of God but only seven angels can you remember the quote we wrote up there can you remember that the Pentecostal isusa Street that it would be a prophetic Prophet would come down no Messenger to the age they wouldn't no Messenger to the zeusa street to name it as a messenger brother brandham gives credit to the oneeyed black man he said it like this one day he said a oneeyed m black man and a couple of bums you ever heard that one he said in a couple of bums started the work of missionary there if you remember the they were trinitarians that's right but that don't have anything to do with the West doctor never come to about 1912 folks so don't don't try to run me and say you're wrong oh they were a zeusa street with trinitarians right but that don't make no difference the Holy Ghost fell on the zeusa street remember that one I'll read this one and I'm quitting all right go back 17 now let's read if your Prophet Express something we shouldn't no that's 18 excuse me our 17 this is from the first seal now remember he covers the questions and answers no messenger of the age the Holy Ghost came himself the person in the fullness of the baptism well I just can't see them Pentecostal having anything now you listen to Too Much garbage that's right amen why can't you see that Martin Luther had the baptism with the Holy Ghost or what would God be doing dealing with him look paragraph 62 roll it back down so we'll start from the top then Along Came the Pentecostal age with the baptism of the Holy Spirit and they cabbaged down on that I want you and there cannot be no more ages that's all of it that's the Philadelphia or not the the lady of in age but we found in the study of the scripture that the messenger to the age come right at the end of the age the End of the Age every time Paul come at the End of the Age sure that's right where did he start pull the pyramid back up you got the nines back here behind you but you know you got Paul irenius Martin Columba Luther Wesley and allias to be Elijah right where did Paul come well brother Dale he come to end the age then how did he bring the message to the Ephesians he would have been bringing the message to the next age that's right come on sure that's right I don't know what you're saying listen did Paul come here or here what we need to know that far cuz you don't know it that's why you need to know it that way you don't deny anything brother Bram says that's right right y cuz you're going to deny if you don't know that fetch that's right amen right go back to the quote now number 17 Paul came at the End of the Age what age we find out that irenius come to End of the Age Martin at the End of the Age now listen to your Prophet that's Luther the end of the Catholic age Luther come at the end of the Catholic age that's right but you're not reading Luther the end of the Catholic Age and what Wesley at the end of the Lutheran age what Wesley at the end of the Lutheran age remember we'll get to it Wednesday a messenger comes on the scene he rebukes what's back behind right and he brings his message Paul rebuked them you'll get it Wednesday you already fit it here Paul rebuked the people from getting away from Pentecost that's right and brought the age to Ephesus I mean brought the message to Ephesus read it Wesley at the end of the Lutheran and Pentecost at the end of sanctification and who's that Wesley through the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that the same quote we on minute ago what and at the end of the Pentecostal age we are supposed to receive according to to the word as the God help me tonight to show you through here that we are to receive a messenger that will take all of those loose ends out there and reveal the whole Secret Of God for the rapturing of the church that's right okay no Messenger to you want to quote or to hold lot these things let you just go home and talk and let you call each other y all you want to brother randoms makes a quote something to this I got laid on my death he said if you make me a Pentecostal you make me a Lady of sin well brother random was a message to Lady OFA I thought they wasn't a messenger to L see you didn't you're not remembering what you just read there was no Messenger to the age cuz the Holy Ghost came himself who is the messenger to the started the message on the Zeus stre the baptism of the Holy Ghost another great prophet amen you just at I you're Prophet we're reading him you want to talk with me anytime about these things for 50 years I had worried about it because it ain't been tore down yet that's right so then church you got an amazing thing if the messenger come at the End of the Age then Paul came right here the age of a Pentecost irenius here Martin here columia here Luther Wesley zeusa Street Pentecost and Elijah coming right there so you've got seven Church ages and eight manifestations of almighty God that's right just as in the pyramid you got seven ads with the Seven Virtues but eight manifestations because he puts it to you at Faith and he turned out to be the eighth which is love which is eternal life amen Zeus's Street no Messenger to the age the Holy Ghost came himself and he says another great prophet but R had no trouble calling the Holy Ghost a prophet because the Holy Ghost is the prophet remember brother randam said what I am not the son of man I only come to introduce the son of man brother brandham was what what did he say he was he said I'm a prophet said he is the prophet now we got it right it just took a little time to express that there's eight manifestations of God throughout seven Church ages and we wind up at the last just right there under the head the love and a prophet to bring a message you realize now that we're just now stepping back into the Bible that's right I didn't make the statement brother random did 1977 be the 70th Jubilee since the beginning of jubilees from According to Leviticus 258 258 deals with the 77s of 49 which is the seven Church ages you realize brother brandham came in the seventh age ending it up but his message spoke of eternal life I ask you church this one thing go home and do it I know you ain't done it I've asked you over and over to do it and it would give you a shock to go home and get the little book that list the tapes the messages of brother brandom right cuz probably a lot of them don't even have it cuz you ain't concerned with it I would like for you to read the titles of the sermons after the seals just read the title of the sermons after the seals and every one of them deals with eternal life things that ought to be who is this mesic marriage and divorce invisible Union the future home ever met message even the titles of the sermons after the seals broke shows you the prophet's message that's right not in years he said a preparation we'll get to this Wednesday we said when he begins to sound see he spent 30 something years coming up to the fact of trying to preach the statue of a perfect man Return of the faith of the fathers back to the church then the seals broke then everybody in the message was what you want to turn on the computer and let you read some of the doctrines they have that in 1963 the Lord Jesus came to Earth in the form of William brandham where are we that's right but I've concluded that part if you can't understand it I'm sorry pray about it there's seven ads to the pyramid but there's eight manifestations of God because it starts at Faith and goes to love there's seven Church ages but there's no Messenger to isusa Street the Holy Ghost came himself so he's not counted a prophet he is the messenger of each age he come to make way for brother randam to step on the scene the prophet made way for the prophet to bring his message what a wonderful thought to think about we're standing on the brims of Eternity on the edges of Eternity looking at eternal life you come to the Millennium see the Millennium is to the Jews it is still under the seven Church age goes all the way to to the uh if I'm quing it correctly the seven Church age goes into the uh White Throne Millennium is still under a seven amen but we're there with eternal life amen then a future home will come into being and I'll say this this one so you musicians get ready see then you say but it's 77s is 49 now what your point and you're right but you're not totally right 77s is 49 so you go 77s is 49 the first year of the next 49 you're counting that to 50 but it's not they never reached a 50 they never celebrated a 50 come on that's what you think I know it I've talked with some of you 77 is 49 the first year of the next is a 50 no it's not it's just starting back over it's a one you say that represents eternal life it represents eternal life but it is not eternal life the future home is a 50 the Millennium is still a seven 7 sevens is 49 the future home will be the first 50 that has really ever been celebrated by total mankind of Body Spirit and soul is the future home yeah but it's just 7749 and first than that you're not going to a 50 you're going back to a one comes back over again we're not supposed to go to a one and come back over and I said you're right because as long as we're in time it will be 7749 and the first year of the next will start the next 49 that's right right but now get the whole story is got to be a 50 you said there ain't no 50 yes there's got to be a 50 cuz if there's not a 50 the Millennium is all going to end everything the Millennium don't end it there is a future home a future home that's a number eight matches exactly this messenger was to bring us a message of eternal life he is to stand between us and Eternity and declare it amen Leviticus 258 77 is 49 but Leviticus 2510 is a 50 read your Bible under the 49 under the sevens there is no Rapture no type of a Rapture because a person worked for seven years and he went for went free in the seventh year and that's the way the Bible said in the seventh year they go so really didn't work for six years so you go free in the seventh if you went into bondage with a wife read your Bible you'll come out of bondage with a wife but if your master gave you a wife she remains in bondage right if a master gives you children or a wife would she has children they remain in bondage but read Leviticus 2510 everything thing goes free It's a Wonderful Story come on musicians sorry being a little bit late but I want you to get the point we'll start Wednesday we'll talk about the messenger come at the End of the Age I hope it's enough for you to understand and think about it am but we'll read what the brother brandom has to say and see how that messenger comes out there amen and stand in the overlap to bring his message there's an overlap between the ages there's no abrupt end each age overlaps the same as the stature of a perfect man that each age recognizes to I mean each person The Virtue recognizes to it each Church ages that church Age come for with the Holy Ghost it's sealed in right the next Agee lock back in to prove it it's sealed in and goes into the next age now now you know some of what I believe what you got
