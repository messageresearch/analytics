[0:02] no hmm gonna be here today couldn't have
[0:06] another Sunday doesn't have any Janet
[0:07] wanting to here with us yeah looking for
[0:09] a good day in the Lord we we got some
[0:12] good wonderful weather outside the sun's
[0:15] out the signs up and here Bob still
[0:24] cultivate what Bob said Wednesday not
[0:26] letting it plant that seed let you have
[0:30] cultivated you gotta get you that's
[0:32] right
[0:33] you gotta get you a little shovel a
[0:34] running start get weeds up you tell us
[0:39] Gardens these all right so we were in
[0:46] Revelation chapter 3 and we're we went
[0:49] through Martin Luther's time John
[0:52] Wesley's time and now we're getting into
[0:56] the layout of Stanton church age we've
[1:00] talked about this last Sonny behold I
[1:02] come quickly hold fast that which now
[1:03] past that no man take my crown and one
[1:08] of give me I've been reading in that
[1:14] against Genesis Exodus Leviticus
[1:15] Deuteronomy and it brought back to my
[1:19] memory that you see what it says hold
[1:23] fast which thou hath and then you're
[1:25] going up here a little bit further says
[1:27] you got a name that you called but you
[1:28] didn't you got all these different
[1:29] things that but God said I'll not forget
[1:31] you you know him that overcometh won't
[1:33] make a pillar temple monk another words
[1:35] what I'm saying is mm-hmm
[1:37] Martin Luther John Wesley and the
[1:41] Pentecostal age all had the baptism of
[1:43] the Holy Ghost for their time but it was
[1:46] not like what we getting that's the same
[1:48] Holy Ghost but Martin Luther was the
[1:51] just shall live by faith yet he did all
[1:53] these other things that wasn't excuse me
[1:56] not pleasing to God God's not pleased
[1:59] with the Trinitarian doctrine but he
[2:00] does allow that and weakened their
[2:02] ignorance because Martin Luther had one
[2:06] message each one of these have one
[2:07] message
[2:08] Martin Luther just reeling buffet mark I
[2:11] mean John Wesley sanctification live
[2:13] right have a method of worship have a
[2:16] method of church that's one that collect
[2:18] Methodist because this a method and like
[2:22] I said before if you ever in a Methodist
[2:23] Church look at their songbook
[2:25] the whole front of it tells you exact
[2:27] and they do if you go to an
[2:28] old-fashioned Methodist Church like the
[2:30] white church up there the white building
[2:33] church up there and guiltily on the side
[2:35] for we've to live there Midway you go in
[2:38] and it's just you but that was what God
[2:42] was pleased because that brought back
[2:44] into instead of just coming in and
[2:45] talking in yeah kidding and as they did
[2:48] down in these other ages it's come in
[2:49] have communion that meant just eating
[2:51] drinking and all that stuff well there
[2:52] was a form of worship came back into
[2:54] into being so holdfast what you have I
[2:58] was thinking about this and and I
[3:02] started reading it out it is wonderful
[3:04] that we got a prophet but you'll go back
[3:06] in the Old Testament
[3:07] and you'll see that there was two tribes
[3:11] and a half tribe I believe it was Reuben
[3:16] GAD and half tribe of Manasses now
[3:19] remember what was the promised land
[3:20] Canaan was the promised land so here's I
[3:23] was going to show you this this is kind
[3:25] of the real animal dish God give us all
[3:27] this and sent the message you've gotten
[3:29] it this is the promised land
[3:31] this is Canaan see in Cana our promised
[3:38] land all right then you got the Jordan
[3:42] River all right then over here you've
[3:47] got these were the other lands they come
[3:50] up from Egypt into here and God told
[3:52] them the gold ran to the promised land
[3:54] now we know the promised lands are
[3:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost don't break up
[3:57] that but there are degrees that each
[4:02] person gets of the baptism of the Holy
[4:05] Ghost and you you are the one that by
[4:08] your free moral agency you decide when
[4:10] you want to go further with
[4:12] because God's happy and they were happy
[4:14] but you had two tribes and a half drive
[4:20] this thing we would like to have our
[4:23] possession over here the other nine and
[4:27] a half drive went over we're in the
[4:30] promised land with Hood Joshua being a
[4:32] cop of the Holy Ghost right right her
[4:34] Christ job saving some ninety I hope
[4:39] everybody got that that's really neat
[4:40] vision he was a son he had no father on
[4:42] earth so Jesus Christ had no father now
[4:45] we know that Heavenly Father but Joshua
[4:47] was the son of nun
[4:48] he was the son so I have to be in a type
[4:50] of Christ Christ expanding say I I don't
[4:52] have a father bounty of my father's up
[4:54] you know in heaven I'm just a little not
[4:59] a playable words God put them in there
[5:00] for some reason yeah maybe for us to see
[5:03] that so you've got your two and a half
[5:05] tribes Reuben GAD and half tribal of an
[5:09] asset but now what did Joshua tell them
[5:12] to do Joshua will see you can have this
[5:15] don't remember Joshua was commissioned
[5:16] to place them in the land Moses brought
[5:19] them to right here then Joshua was
[5:23] wanted took them over into the Promised
[5:24] Land what is the Promised Land to me the
[5:26] Promised Land for now today is not just
[5:28] the baptism in the Holy Ghost but the
[5:30] full promised land body spirit so nobody
[5:34] got that right but now these were happy
[5:37] enough
[5:37] Reuben Gavin have traveled my Nessman
[5:39] Isis they they were okay but now what
[5:42] did Joshua say Joshua said okay you can
[5:45] have this land I'm gonna make it a point
[5:48] you you can have this land but you're
[5:51] gonna have to go over Jordan into the
[5:54] Promised Land help us fight yeah but
[5:58] you're placing is going to be by a hair
[6:01] yeah they're gonna we're gonna fight as
[6:05] twelve tribes you're gonna help us clean
[6:07] this land of all these i'ts
[6:10] so Joshua can positionally place these
[6:13] now these have already been positionally
[6:15] placed not making them any less right
[6:18] because they all went over and fought
[6:20] and all of a sudden when they got all
[6:22] the
[6:22] and Joshua which is a type of adoption
[6:26] where you get this and placing and you
[6:28] get this and you get you get a judgment
[6:30] coming faith virtue knowledge
[6:31] implication when you get in this land so
[6:34] these two and a half tribes went back to
[6:37] cross Jordan and occupied it not out of
[6:42] the full promised land that they got the
[6:44] promise to go across but they come back
[6:48] and same time brother Branham gave us
[6:50] some wonderful type of that being being
[6:53] Luther Wesley and Pentecost
[6:56] man you said what's the difference the
[6:59] difference is is they didn't go all the
[7:00] way they had so much hold fast which
[7:05] thou hast they went across and got and
[7:09] tight the Holy Ghost in the promised
[7:11] land but instead of going on and being
[7:13] placed in the promised land they decided
[7:16] they decided to come back out here and
[7:19] we'll find a peaceful here yeah but then
[7:22] wearing the promised land
[7:23] you say well how that helping mate
[7:26] Luther Wesley enter and Pentecost got
[7:29] the baptism the Holy Ghost but they
[7:31] didn't get full adoption they didn't get
[7:33] the full plan of redemption to go on
[7:37] with God in the promised land and what
[7:39] have rest be settled them right they
[7:41] come back out here rule them again half
[7:44] travel Manassas typing brother Brown
[7:46] said thank God for a prophet who would
[7:47] you do whatever say that right but then
[7:49] you look at brother brown when you say
[7:51] oh that's that's uh that time its
[7:54] justification st. and baptism of the
[7:56] holy go okay not saying they didn't get
[8:00] your Carter they got a portion they even
[8:02] went across in the promised land they
[8:03] got the whole ego but they didn't go on
[8:06] with God same thing with Luther little
[8:07] bit got the baptism I Holy Ghost but he
[8:10] what
[8:10] he comes back out in denominations we're
[8:12] going to see that today in Ruth because
[8:16] Orpha cotton denominational Church she
[8:20] went so far with with Naomi but she went
[8:25] right back into where she from back in
[8:26] the bowl at brother I'm tell listen many
[8:31] times the tactics the phenomena
[8:32] Church they didn't go on the gun they
[8:35] didn't go on with Naomi to get into the
[8:37] promised land they went so hard any went
[8:39] back now they did these dick over in
[8:42] pumps land they got something but they
[8:44] didn't get a land possession right this
[8:47] land they got a promise okay but they
[8:52] didn't get the full prompt they come
[8:54] back out as lucre steps into the baptism
[8:58] of the holy ghost but he turns and tries
[9:00] to bring some of the Catholic ideas
[9:02] doctrines with him which is not the
[9:05] promised land not the full promised land
[9:07] same way we with Martin Luther same way
[9:10] with John Wesley he comes out of
[9:12] whatever reform that is in Martin
[9:14] Luther's age and he said that's okay but
[9:16] there's more yes and then God tells him
[9:19] hold fast what you got what you got okay
[9:23] what behalf he went into the Promised
[9:24] Land that's just that sanctification you
[9:28] got the baptism of the Holy go but he
[9:31] comes back out and he's still got
[9:33] Trinitarian doctrine he still got water
[9:35] baptism name father-son photo he's still
[9:37] hanging on to a lot of these things at
[9:39] work that's not even his promptly nobody
[9:41] got that same thing with same thing with
[9:44] the hash table which is Pentecost went
[9:47] over the promised land bought the land
[9:49] fall with the people but what they did
[9:52] tones is the evidence they had right
[9:55] back out to the outside don't get the
[9:57] full promise they got the whole ego just
[9:59] like you got the whole ego but I only
[10:02] ghost tells us by the prophet and bottle
[10:04] message of the hour and even Bible Bible
[10:06] the clarity of the Bible that it's not
[10:11] just speaking in tongues is the evidence
[10:13] of the Holy Ghost
[10:13] it's not just that you do this it's
[10:16] whether you agree with the word and the
[10:18] word try today it's full possession
[10:20] placing right all right we get into the
[10:25] placing we should not we can't bring I'm
[10:28] telling you this we can't bring those
[10:31] old doctrines back across the river with
[10:36] us and we can't go back because we've
[10:40] already been took in the promised land
[10:42] by a prophet right okay
[10:45] now most didn't basically take them in
[10:47] but Moses let me put it this way Moses
[10:50] doctrine was in Joshua yeah
[10:54] because God said as I was with Moses so
[10:56] I'll be with you so everything Moses
[10:58] died Joshua got Caleb being a cop of the
[11:02] believers so you got to you've got
[11:04] [Music]
[11:06] you've got I would come at the penguin
[11:11] so you've got all this happening out
[11:14] here so wanting brother brother brother
[11:15] brother come and say look here's where
[11:17] we need to be this is not all of our
[11:21] promised land yeah
[11:23] getting the baptism the Holy Ghost you
[11:25] Pentecostals that's good but let's go on
[11:27] let's go on the end of the promised land
[11:30] which is this land not to land this on
[11:33] the inside yes and look they were still
[11:36] the crimes of Israel they didn't lose
[11:39] anything but position okay they include
[11:43] they came over here saw Pentecost
[11:49] thought it out they talked about is when
[11:52] the whole goes for their day but what do
[11:53] they did they go back and grab the
[11:56] Trinitarian doctrine they go back and
[11:58] grab the father sent the Trinitarian
[12:00] idea wonder about all the things that
[12:02] the previous ones had God they went back
[12:05] out God so God is telling them hold fast
[12:09] that that you have that no man take your
[12:12] crown they're not gonna take your crown
[12:13] is just it they weren't Wesley was not
[12:19] predestinated Pentecost was not
[12:20] predestinate to take forward because you
[12:23] got a hand we're going to talk about
[12:24] today you've got your three works of
[12:27] grace which gives you the Holy Ghost
[12:28] just
[12:29] baptism the Holy Ghost but then what
[12:31] would rather have to bring in the word
[12:33] our adoption well no that's not on this
[12:36] side right of Jordan all this this
[12:41] adoption and all this placing took place
[12:44] on the other side of door yeah the
[12:46] property God gave us the word to take us
[12:49] a cross and then he left the scene just
[12:53] like Moses did yeah but who came on the
[12:56] scene Christ came on the scene in the
[12:58] bride of the day now today the fivefold
[13:02] ministry and the prophets message
[13:06] placing each person in their proper
[13:10] position in the land they're back out
[13:14] there so that's to me that's a beautiful
[13:16] picture so there's really only three
[13:20] works of grace because you can't take
[13:23] those fries now but you got a four for
[13:26] is restoration cuz for bug the four bugs
[13:29] that ate it
[13:30] gotta put everybody back this way the
[13:34] caterpillar think you are Tom Warren all
[13:36] look for eat the tree down from where
[13:39] from down here
[13:40] but brother Brad talks about a bride
[13:42] trees starting back so on this side you
[13:44] have to shoot you haven't stopped you
[13:48] got the tassel but the full grain is
[13:50] what went over in the full grant is what
[13:53] this was the promised land to begin with
[13:55] they got out of the Promised Land got
[13:57] out of the will of God we'll see the
[13:59] same thing with Naomi Naomi was in this
[14:02] Bethlehem Judea Promised Land
[14:04] she goes the mobile app which is way
[14:07] over here and Moab began by the son that
[14:11] was born from Daddy and a woman daddy
[14:14] and his daughter getting together and
[14:15] having a baby which was it's always been
[14:19] looked at brother Graham said the hair
[14:20] and the biscuit so you know you yeah
[14:23] anything he said which in this day in
[14:25] Thomas against the wall but back then I
[14:27] guess it had to be a time there had to
[14:29] be a type somewhere to show us that
[14:35] there had to be an orphan there had to
[14:37] be a Ruth there had to be a Naomi they
[14:40] had to be able ass
[14:42] so there's your four yes they only root
[14:45] or foe both aspect that gets everybody
[14:49] in there and then this type remember
[14:50] we're going to stick the devil in there
[14:52] too because he was a near kinsman
[14:54] because of this guy that's why he that's
[14:57] why they stayed over here on this side
[14:59] and didn't go all the way to the full
[15:01] restoration of the work which will come
[15:03] in the way out of C interphase because
[15:05] he promises right here at the beginning
[15:09] my starting until the Angel of the
[15:13] Church of the loudest and write these
[15:16] things that D Amen the faithful true
[15:19] witness the beginning of the creation of
[15:21] God and the beginning of creation God
[15:23] began here but the who is the beginning
[15:28] of the creation have done the Lord Jesus
[15:30] Christ
[15:31] that was the beginning that should have
[15:32] been and they're not gonna fall it would
[15:35] have been no sex that would have been
[15:37] spoken were children just like Jesus was
[15:39] spoken into the womb of Mary that's the
[15:41] way that's the beginning of the creation
[15:42] of God you say well the God no that
[15:45] can't be created it's the beginning of
[15:48] the unfolding is there has to be a part
[15:50] in us there has to be a beginning of we
[15:52] are time creatures right God's not but
[15:56] he knows we are so we have to know that
[15:59] there's a time everything's got an order
[16:02] you start in the kindergarten then you
[16:04] go for first grade then you go to second
[16:06] grade well it's all building on
[16:08] education all the way up to go build you
[16:10] guys in college you're still building on
[16:13] what you learn back then the one plus
[16:16] one is two going to school on time
[16:18] saying yes ma'am no ma'am doing all the
[16:20] things that spoke you see when a man's
[16:22] child training so that's the way God
[16:24] knew we were going to grow up so that's
[16:26] the way he decided to grow up yes being
[16:30] in the womb that because remember that
[16:31] like we're talking the other day milk
[16:33] acetate was guarding human flesh but he
[16:35] wasn't our kinsman if we're gonna talk
[16:37] about today Boas had to be a close near
[16:40] kinsman to Naomi
[16:42] yes or he couldn't do the right of
[16:45] redemption he could not redeem what
[16:47] and because of the laws in the Old
[16:49] Testament thank god we've got these
[16:50] examples that we can look at in a profit
[16:52] that gives us clarity so in this trkage
[16:55] is the beginning of the creation of God
[16:58] starting with what the baptism of the
[17:00] Holy Ghost when one day of Pentecost
[17:02] 1906 Azusa Street the Holy Ghost came
[17:04] and was the messenger to that part of
[17:06] the age he's the angel of the church of
[17:09] the laodiceans write these things saith
[17:11] the Amen the faithful and true witness
[17:14] nothing is false but when you get a
[17:17] tuning fork it's not wrong but when you
[17:21] hit it you get a true sound that's the
[17:23] same MO because you get a true witness
[17:25] the beginning of the creation of God you
[17:27] know one that says true witness now in
[17:29] Christ there's been a true witness the
[17:31] whole time
[17:32] but these people open vent over here in
[17:34] that has some denominational ideas that
[17:37] were contrary to God they weren't a true
[17:40] witness now they were a true witness in
[17:42] saying we're Christians we believe God
[17:44] died for our sins and all that but we
[17:47] wants you to be baptized man father son
[17:48] Holy Ghost cuz we believe there's a
[17:50] Trinitarian three persons to the Godhead
[17:52] that's not a true witness right so now
[17:55] we have a true witness we have the right
[17:57] tuning fork we have the right person on
[17:59] the scene we got the right messenger
[18:01] all right the beginning of the creation
[18:03] of God but now watch what happens being
[18:07] that that is so true God has got to do
[18:09] what he's got separated
[18:11] he didn't separate it over here he
[18:16] allowed them to have their ideas of
[18:18] Trinity of the all the things that are
[18:21] false now that we see that that the
[18:25] denominations have started didn't start
[18:27] back 200 years ago it started 2,000
[18:30] years ago
[18:30] when God came on the scene in flesh and
[18:32] Satan came on the scene and here we over
[18:35] the dad denominational ideas back then
[18:37] he says I know that works that thou art
[18:40] neither cold nor hot I would have to
[18:44] tell a cold or hot what you lukewarm
[18:47] you're you're out here you're saying you
[18:51] got all this and you really don't have
[18:53] it all you got some of it but you don't
[18:54] have all of it
[18:57] and I will spew thee out of my mouth
[18:59] because there are blue
[19:01] warm kasi they were on fire for God
[19:04] don't get me wrong in the three Church
[19:06] ages private here keep their pages but
[19:10] Glocks finally said I've had enough
[19:11] I want a true witness and this is the
[19:14] way I wanted it to begin with so I don't
[19:18] want you lukewarm I don't want you see
[19:20] this is lukewarm
[19:21] let me put an Aries on both sides
[19:23] flip-flopping in and out in and out no
[19:25] no this is God move forward wait all
[19:30] this behind if you guys about give them
[19:34] the Holy Ghost you gotta go on I'm going
[19:37] to require that now or I'm gonna spew
[19:39] you out of my mouth which he does was
[19:41] the denominational like the orifice of
[19:43] the world they head on back to the come
[19:47] on the church so then because thou art
[19:49] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will
[19:51] spew thee out of my mouth so in other
[19:55] words I'm not going to deal with you now
[19:58] I'll give you enough word through all
[20:00] this coming of them of them of the
[20:03] Prophet and all these different things
[20:04] in the end time I'll give you enough
[20:06] word now you don't need to be over here
[20:08] yeah this is where you need to be right
[20:12] because they'll say I am rich and
[20:14] increased with Goods I'm okay I'm
[20:19] alright brother brown says it's okay
[20:22] you Pentecostals you got the baptism the
[20:24] Holy Ghost but don't cabbage down on it
[20:26] you drew a big line and you've not gone
[20:30] past it anymore he said now you guys say
[20:32] plus now plus God is moving on remember
[20:35] God is continually moving excuse me then
[20:40] but you're saying I'm saying I am Rick
[20:43] and I am increased with Goods and I have
[20:47] need of nothing go tell them go tell
[20:50] somebody and grounded in a
[20:52] denominational idea they'll tell you
