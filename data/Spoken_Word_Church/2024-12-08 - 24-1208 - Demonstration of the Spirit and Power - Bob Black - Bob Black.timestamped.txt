[0:02] well let's get right into
[0:04] um 1 Corinthians chapter 2 we finished 1
[0:08] Corinthians chapter 1 and we're moving
[0:11] on to chapter two let's bow our heads
[0:13] and go to the Lord we're so thankful
[0:14] Lord for your word we ask Lord that
[0:16] you'll bless today uh uh prepare our
[0:19] hearts and Minds Lord to receive what
[0:21] you have in store for us I pray God that
[0:23] you'll bless the day of fellowship and
[0:25] bless our time together bless the word
[0:28] now as we uh as you help us navigate
[0:31] through these scriptures Quicken it to
[0:33] us and make it real to us give us the
[0:35] real essence of the meaning Lord we pray
[0:37] in your name
[0:41] amen so uh 1 Corinthians chapter 1 uh um
[0:46] just maybe to recap best I can from my
[0:49] memory uh I I don't have any slides
[0:52] today so just it it'll just be just be
[0:55] talking uh and if you can open open up
[0:58] your Bible of 1 Corinthians chapter to
[1:00] and just kind of go along with us but in
[1:02] 1 Corinthians chapter 1 Paul's kind of
[1:04] started off talking about how we need to
[1:06] the word of the word of God is the power
[1:08] of God and and we're not to um base our
[1:12] identity on a man like Paul or Apollos
[1:14] or Peter because we were uh we sit under
[1:17] a particular kind of teaching or
[1:19] anything but our our identity comes from
[1:20] the word and then when we uh Paul will
[1:23] reiterate that when you go over to 1
[1:25] Corinthians chapter 3 he'll start doing
[1:27] that again because he's it's so
[1:30] important for the Corinthians to get
[1:31] that see he he really hits it in chapter
[1:33] one then he hits it in chapter 3 and
[1:35] then the and and then uh uh you know he
[1:39] he's he's talking in in chapter one
[1:41] about the power of God is is the word
[1:43] and so you when you get over in chapter
[1:44] two he kind of kind of continues on with
[1:47] with some of those themes talking again
[1:49] about U uh that that he's got he he's
[1:54] sharing some some wisdom wisdom that's
[1:57] different than the wisdom that you get
[1:59] from carnal understanding or teaching or
[2:01] all the Greek wisdom and so forth so
[2:03] just to kind of um give a give a quick
[2:06] overview of what chapter 2
[2:08] is Paul's going to talk about what real
[2:10] preaching
[2:12] is so he's going to remind the
[2:14] Corinthians that when he came to share
[2:15] the gospel he didn't use fancy words or
[2:17] human wisdom but he's focusing on Jesus
[2:21] Christ and his
[2:23] crucifixion and then he's going to talk
[2:24] about this hidden
[2:26] wisdom that's that's different from the
[2:29] wisdom that the Greeks and the the Jews
[2:32] and all of the what's called quote smart
[2:35] people of the day had this hidden
[2:38] wisdom and then he's going to conclude
[2:41] with contrasting human understanding
[2:43] with spiritual understanding so that
[2:46] that kind of um and and he's going to
[2:49] talk about you know how only a person's
[2:50] own Spirit knows their thoughts and only
[2:52] God's spirit knows the things of God so
[2:54] if you really want to know about God
[2:55] you've got to have his Spirit dwelling
[2:57] in you so that that uh that kind of sets
[3:00] the stage for some of these things are
[3:03] um maybe a little bit difficult to
[3:05] really frame up in our mind so we really
[3:08] to we want to frame up before we dive
[3:10] into this that Paul's what he's really
[3:12] talking about when he talks about what
[3:13] true preaching and wisdom and so forth
[3:15] he's contrasting that human intellect
[3:18] with a revelation that you you know you
[3:21] can and and really before we get into
[3:23] this um think about where Paul came from
[3:26] that he sat under the feet of galeal and
[3:29] who um I I like that little that little
[3:31] series that they put out the chosen that
[3:33] that really makes when you if you if you
[3:35] watch that they they make galeal seem
[3:39] like wow you know that all these they've
[3:41] got all these different teachers but
[3:43] then Galeo comes on the scene like Galeo
[3:45] knows what he's talking about so if you
[3:47] sat under
[3:48] gal then you got some real good teaching
[3:52] but yet galio couldn't preach a present
[3:55] tense understanding in other words like
[3:57] Paul's saying I I I I come with not just
[4:00] a bunch of uh information but I come to
[4:03] you with a present tense revelation of
[4:05] who Jesus Christ and his crucifixion is
[4:08] and and that's what I'm trying to relate
[4:09] to you is not just some carnal
[4:11] understanding and not just something
[4:12] that I'm parting that somebody else G
[4:15] gave me some information but I've got
[4:17] I've got wisdom that can only be
[4:19] imparted by a Divine Supernatural
[4:22] relationship with a supernatural God so
[4:24] that's what he's talking about so he
[4:26] says and if you follow along in in verse
[4:29] one he he says and I Brethren when I
[4:32] came to you came not with Excellency of
[4:36] speech or of wisdom declaring unto you
[4:39] the testimony of
[4:41] God now now again think about you know
[4:45] gelu I'm sure was a great teacher a
[4:47] great speaker a great orator just like
[4:50] many other Greek philosophers you'd sit
[4:52] under the sit under the feet of Socrates
[4:55] or Plato and and boy they could frame
[4:58] things out in a way that wow that's
[4:59] really good and you get out like your
[5:02] little Almanac or whatever and read
[5:03] things and but he's he's he's framing up
[5:06] I I've come with something else but I
[5:09] determine not to know anything among you
[5:12] save Jesus Christ and him crucified so
[5:17] he's pointing everything back to Jesus
[5:19] Christ back to the word not not to some
[5:22] things that we we're just understanding
[5:24] in our head but not head knowledge but
[5:27] heart knowledge right and I and he look
[5:30] he says and I was with you in weakness
[5:33] he he was he didn't come relying on his
[5:35] own strength or his own courage or his
[5:37] own background that he had set up under
[5:39] galio he it wasn't relying on his own
[5:42] brain power he wasn't relying on his own
[5:45] carinal understanding but I was with you
[5:47] in weakness and in fear and in much
[5:49] trembling and if you really are are
[5:51] looking at U the scripture right and our
[5:56] responsibility right this goes for a
[5:58] minister Deacon any anybody that's got a
[6:00] role in the body of Christ you're going
[6:03] to approach it with fear and trembling
[6:06] recognizing the responsibility and all
[6:07] that goes with that so Paul is trusting
[6:11] he's he's relying and not on his own
[6:14] power or his own ability but he's
[6:16] trusting entirely in the power of God
[6:20] which is what he says in the next verse
[6:21] he says and my speech and my preaching
[6:25] now here's where we lay down what
[6:27] preaching really is my speech and my
[6:30] preaching was not with enticing words of
[6:33] man's Wisdom it wasn't even though he
[6:36] might have said under Galeo and learned
[6:38] a lot of things and had a lot of
[6:40] information packed in and and and Gia
[6:43] was actually teaching him the word but
[6:46] yet that won't do you any good unless
[6:48] you've got a real Revelation for
[6:49] yourself to lay everything together and
[6:51] put everything together and give the
[6:53] real essence of what it is and that's
[6:55] why he said I came not to you with
[6:57] enticing words of man's Wisdom
[7:00] but in
[7:01] demonstration of the spirit and of
[7:05] power that your faith should not stand
[7:08] in the wisdom of men now there is Zeo in
[7:11] that that that theme again that he he
[7:13] said in in chapter one and he's going to
[7:15] say in chapter three again our our faith
[7:18] our confidence is not that we set under
[7:21] Gia or something but it's in the power
[7:24] of
[7:25] God so in other words a present tense re
[7:29] revelation will produce Supernatural
[7:33] Works it'll produce healing it'll
[7:36] produce prophetic Insight it'll produce
[7:38] a ministry that's actually speaking to
[7:40] your present tent situation it'll
[7:42] produce the transformative power of
[7:45] God's word in your life I we were coming
[7:47] over this morning and we were listening
[7:48] to a message preacher sharing a
[7:51] testimony of how he was preaching in a
[7:54] service and and and the Holy Ghost
[7:56] struck this young person in this in the
[7:58] meeting and and they begin to think
[8:00] within themselves I want to I want that
[8:03] Holy Ghost and they didn't know nothing
[8:05] they they were just visiting the church
[8:07] and I thought it was an astounding
[8:09] testimony because they were just they
[8:11] they didn't really know anything about
[8:12] the message but they got to meditating
[8:14] on what the preacher was saying and all
[8:16] of a sudden the spirit fell on them and
[8:17] they begin to jump up right in the
[8:19] middle of the service and speak in
[8:21] tongues and and I I I just got me
[8:23] thinking as we were coming over this
[8:25] morning that that a real present tense
[8:28] revelation will do something in our
[8:31] lives when it's not just something uh
[8:34] relaying information or relaying putting
[8:36] things together by carnal understanding
[8:38] but a present tense revelation will do
[8:42] something in our lives it will I I I
[8:44] don't want to get away from every
[8:45] believing that God will still heals I
[8:47] don't want to ever get away from
[8:49] expecting that God will do Miracles
[8:51] because God is still the same yesterday
[8:53] today and forever now now look at what
[8:56] brother brandham said about these
[8:57] scriptures he said oh what a preacher
[8:59] that's great great man who he sought God
[9:00] and he said he said God I am weak and I
[9:04] don't know what to do I just pray you
[9:06] God to strengthen me take my infirmities
[9:08] away from me in these things so I can be
[9:12] stronger and God spoke back to him and
[9:14] said Paul my strength is made perfect in
[9:17] your weakness and so he's he's saying uh
[9:19] you know Paul said and I was with you in
[9:21] weakness and in fear and much trembling
[9:23] so he's getting away from all of the uh
[9:26] just the intellectual the head knowledge
[9:28] part of it and and and and relying on
[9:31] God quickening that to give him a true
[9:34] understanding of what the scripture is
[9:37] saying he brother R would say listen to
[9:39] this man who was a warrior and stripped
[9:42] himself if there's anything that our
[9:44] schools needs today if it's anything our
[9:47] churches needs today is a stripping of
[9:49] themselves of your own thoughts and your
[9:51] own abilities strip yourselves before
[9:54] God unless you would try to do something
[9:57] within
[9:58] yourselves that's see what when when
[10:00] when when you study this out what Paul's
[10:01] really trying to say I didn't come to
[10:03] you with words of wisdom but I came to
[10:05] you with a power and demonstration I
[10:07] came to you he's coming with a present
[10:09] tense Revelation and that's where
[10:12] brother renold will make these
[10:13] statements about how we we don't need
[10:16] education see we don't need that side
[10:18] leaning toward galeal we need we need a
[10:22] present tense revelation of Jesus Christ
[10:24] we don't need theology we need a present
[10:28] tense reality so let's look at what
[10:30] brother Ram said he said today is too
[10:32] bad he said we kind of look to a well-
[10:33] Tred scholar or
[10:35] something that's who we think we find
[10:37] Christ in we go to schools we send our
[10:40] boys and off to school to seminaries
[10:42] which is all right but we find out they
[10:43] learn how to speak eloquent speeches and
[10:46] they make great talks and they're fine
[10:48] men there's no doubt and thousands of
[10:50] them and they know how to put the
[10:51] program over they know how to stand on
[10:53] the platform they know how to introduce
[10:55] Christ to the people but you come to
[10:57] find out most of that a lot of it too
[10:59] much of it is just that man not being
[11:03] exactly a representative of Christ but a
[11:07] leure see know he he's trained to give
[11:10] lecture you could ask him to give a talk
[11:13] that would actually Astound the people
[11:15] from his eloquence of speech and how he
[11:18] could hold himself and how he could hold
[11:19] the people Spellbound and but we find
[11:22] out he learned that in a seminary
[11:24] somewhere somewhere where they trained
[11:26] him how to do how different it was from
[11:29] St
[11:30] Paul when he said I never come to you
[11:33] with the Excellency of speech or with
[11:35] wisdom of the world but in the power of
[11:38] the holy spirit that your faith would
[11:41] not be in the wisdom of man and his
[11:43] culture but in the power of the Holy
[11:46] Spirit and that same message later on
[11:49] brother brand would ask the question are
[11:50] you lecturing but Jesus never said go
[11:53] into all the world and teach this or
[11:55] teach that he said go into all the world
[11:57] and preach the gospel
[11:59] now you really let's unpack that for a
[12:01] second cuz he's not saying we don't need
[12:03] the five-fold ministry that office of
[12:05] teacher he's saying that in all those
[12:08] fivefold Ministry offices you're
[12:09] bringing something not from your head
[12:11] but you're bringing it from your heart
[12:13] and that's what real preaching is real
[12:15] preaching is when it elevates it off the
[12:17] page and puts the real Essence in in in
[12:20] mind in view so that you're it it it
[12:22] takes it from just a Theology and brings
[12:24] it together unpacks it so you can sit
[12:26] there and like that young man say I want
[12:29] that Holy Ghost and it becomes a living
[12:31] reality to you so he said preach is to
[12:35] demonstrate the power of the holy spirit
[12:37] so preaching is being moved by the Holy
[12:39] Ghost to to uh to it's it's being
[12:44] speaking speaking the words that are
[12:46] laying there on the Page by inspiration
[12:48] that God can put everything together and
[12:51] then then he said these signs shall
[12:53] follow them it don't come by lecture
[12:55] that's right see that believe it doesn't
[12:57] come by lectures it comes by the
[12:59] presence of the Living God moving among
[13:02] in human flesh proving
[13:05] himself that he's the same yesterday
[13:08] today and forever that's right he never
[13:10] fails to be the same it comes so simple
[13:13] the Simplicity of it is what drives the
[13:16] intellectual mind away from it now what
[13:20] what you know so we're contrasting
[13:22] Paul's talking about I didn't come to
[13:24] you with that that wisdom of my head but
[13:27] the wisdom of my heart and brother R
[13:30] would say that he he'd make this these
[13:33] uh what really what it is
[13:37] is you know you know when you read you
[13:39] you start studying things out you get
[13:42] educated you're going to get educated
[13:44] first sitting here now you're being
[13:46] educated but then the Holy Spirit when
[13:49] he quickens it to you he makes it he he
[13:52] it's like the the picture of the cow
[13:53] that brother random always talked about
[13:55] the cow you don't have all the P the
[13:57] parts put together but the holy spirit
[14:00] will put it together right like like for
[14:03] example the Seven Seals there's a lot of
[14:05] different parts and symbols and things
[14:06] that you learn you learn separately the
[14:09] line and what what what is and and you
[14:12] start learning and years and years go by
[14:14] it seems like and you're learning things
[14:16] but then all at once the holy spirit
[14:18] will put it together and and you you see
[14:21] it you see the Revelation and then maybe
[14:24] you'll see like part of the first seal
[14:26] and then boom the whole picture comes
[14:28] into view and you're not looking at
[14:30] something some theology that you can
[14:32] pair it because somebody else told it to
[14:34] you but you're looking at a picture that
[14:36] God framed up in your mind and you can
[14:39] see it so that's that's the difference
[14:41] between just a lecture a lecture would
[14:43] be just relaying to you the information
[14:45] of with the background of what this the
[14:48] line is and going on and that kind of
[14:50] thing but the preaching is actually to
[14:52] put it together so you see what it is
[14:55] and you see how it relates to your life
[14:57] and you see what you can do with it and
[14:58] it builds your faith and your confidence
[15:01] so a lecture would be just some kind of
[15:03] like a formal in it's a form of
[15:06] intellectual instruction plan and
[15:07] structured and focused on providing
[15:10] information analysis and persuasive
[15:12] reasoning formal education or training
[15:15] but preaching is by Revelation inspired
[15:18] by the Holy Ghost now you know we get in
[15:21] our mind though that preaching is PR
[15:22] preaching is like an evangelist or
[15:24] somebody a camp meeting no preaching is
[15:26] every Office of the five-fold ministry
[15:29] is preaching is bringing something by a
[15:31] revelation I I I like I I I totally
[15:34] agree with what brother Chris Long said
[15:36] that time he said we've got to get to a
[15:38] place to where we're preaching the Seven
[15:40] Seals to where we understand it so fully
[15:43] until we can just sling it and and and
[15:46] the true Essence will sit will rest in
[15:49] the believer's heart and and it's not
[15:51] just we're trying to probe and and
[15:53] trying to study things out but we know
[15:55] it so good until we can preach it now
[15:57] that's preaching preach ing is where you
[15:59] the the true Essence is unveiled so
[16:02] that's why brother Brown we make these
[16:04] statements he said what we need is not
[16:06] education we need the power and
[16:08] demonstration of the Holy Ghost back in
[16:10] the church to demonstrate the power amen
[16:13] Jesus never said go into all the world
[16:15] and teach he said he never said go into
[16:18] all the world and do he said go into all
[16:20] the world and preach the gospel and the
[16:22] gospel is to demonstrate the power of
[16:25] the Holy Ghost the resurrection so if
[16:28] well really to frame it up like this
[16:30] education has little to do with where
[16:32] you're sitting like School versus church
[16:36] it's not University versus church that's
[16:38] not what it is but it's more to do with
[16:42] where it's coming from your head or your
[16:45] heart is it coming from your head that's
[16:48] education is it coming from your heart
[16:51] it's Revelation
[16:53] amen and see many times it comes from
[16:55] our head it's it's going to come from
[16:58] your head when you're sitting there
[16:59] receiving it but when it's behind the
[17:01] pulpit it better come from the heart
[17:04] that's the point that's the point Paul
[17:05] Paul's trying to make that's right and
[17:07] the greater than Solomon is here he said
[17:09] as I made a remark last night I felt it
[17:11] sweep over the audience it kind of had a
[17:13] funny feeling when it returned but when
[17:15] I said education he listen he said this
[17:18] and it he felt a funny feeling come back
[17:20] from the people cuz they resisted when
[17:22] he said it he said education has been
[17:25] the mark of antichrist All Through the
[17:28] Ages
[17:30] education is the worst enemy The Gospel
[17:33] ever had and see he's not talking about
[17:36] math at school he's talking about
[17:38] education in the church he's not talking
[17:41] about in your University he's talking
[17:43] about education in the church and
[17:45] brother R in in leading of the spirit of
[17:47] God he said as soon as education comes
[17:50] in now this is what Paul's getting at I
[17:53] come to you not to you with a wisdom
[17:54] head knowledge but I come to you
[17:57] preaching the power and demonstration of
[17:59] the spirit and brother Brandon would say
[18:01] as soon as education comes in the
[18:03] phenomenon leaves the church Christ
[18:06] leaves he can't stand it they get so
[18:09] smart they know more than he does so the
[18:11] scripture is not given by education it's
[18:14] given by Revelation not education
[18:18] Revelation so as soon as education takes
[18:22] your pulpit and but he would say again
[18:25] further on in that message he said when
[18:26] Jesus come the Pharisees and Sadducees
[18:28] and Educators look where they were at
[18:30] religious oh holy my you couldn't put a
[18:33] finger on their life but you see they
[18:35] were
[18:36] unbelievers anything that doubts one
[18:39] punctuation of God's word is an
[18:41] unbeliever I don't care how religious
[18:43] you are Satan's religious too you've got
[18:45] to believe the word and if you got the
[18:48] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will punctuate
[18:50] every word with a sentence with an amen
[18:52] See it'll never take from it it'll
[18:55] believe it now now I know I'm believer
[18:58] in the point a little bit but this is if
[19:00] you keep reading on through chapter 2
[19:01] this is where Paul's getting to that I'm
[19:03] I'm not coming to you with man's Wisdom
[19:06] my head I'm coming to you with something
[19:09] that can only this hidden Mystery that
[19:11] only comes by Supernatural
[19:19] Revelation I'm I'm try to skip through
[19:21] some of these
[19:24] things so comparing gel Paul learning
[19:28] from from
[19:29] gum with Paul learning from Jesus Christ
[19:32] after he met him compare Moses sitting
[19:36] at Mama's feet and learning that's
[19:38] education but then at the burning bush
[19:41] he met God and he got an education from
[19:44] God not education but
[19:46] Revelation and then then he could go
[19:49] down and preach so education is just
[19:52] carnal wisdom but Revelation is the
[19:55] wisdom of God Revelation is the wisdom
[19:58] of God so in verse six if we keep
[20:02] reading on that's why Paul says how be
[20:04] it we speak
[20:06] wisdom we're preaching wisdom among them
[20:09] that are perfect yet not the wisdom of
[20:13] this world nor of the princes of this
[20:16] world that come to
[20:17] not now you you think what he's saying
[20:20] here he's saying I'm I'm speaking a
[20:22] present tense Revelation I'm giving you
[20:25] wisdom from God that can only come from
[20:27] God it can't come from some Greek philos
[20:28] oer or from the Jewish
[20:31] Scholars and he's speaking it to people
[20:34] that God has made perfect how how can
[20:36] you be perfect brother R would say I'm a
[20:37] stinker I'm a renegade every one of us
[20:39] are but before God we are perfect be ye
[20:43] therefore perfect even as your father in
[20:45] Heaven is perfect how can you be because
[20:48] a perfect one represents us there that
[20:51] Fountain is there every day fresh not
[20:54] some stagnated something but fresh every
[20:57] day that washes away all my sins he is
[21:00] that Fountain so wisdom we find out
[21:02] wisdom is a wisdom is that thing that
[21:05] it's Christ Living in us to make us
[21:07] perfect then because he's given you his
[21:10] that Supernatural understanding you
[21:12] begin to realize that you're perfect and
[21:14] what he's done to you what justification
[21:16] does so wisdom is a Divine gift from God
[21:20] it's not something just derived from
[21:22] Human intellect or worldly education but
[21:26] true wisdom is revealed by God God and
[21:29] it surpasses Earthly
[21:31] thinking what what what's wisdom W
[21:34] wisdom really is you know you got a lot
[21:35] of information that's knowledge but
[21:38] wisdom tells you what to do with that
[21:40] knowledge so WIS wisdom gives you
[21:43] practical understanding that guides your
[21:45] life in righteousness and truth it it it
[21:48] gives you Solutions it promotes humility
[21:50] and it leads to peace in other words it
[21:52] tells you what to do when situations
[21:54] arrive in your life how to deal with
[21:56] your family how to deal with your
[21:57] children how to deal with situations how
[22:00] how to how to talk to somebody that's a
[22:02] sinner it's it's wisdom because it's
[22:05] divine Supernatural
[22:07] Revelation like James said in chapter 3
[22:10] James chapter 3 the wisdom that is from
[22:12] above is first pure then Peaceable
[22:16] gentle and easy to be
[22:19] intreated full of mercy and good fruits
[22:22] without partiality and without hypoc
[22:25] hypocrisy so wisdom is a whole lot more
[22:27] than just knowledge your cleverness it's
[22:29] the Practical outworking of
[22:32] understanding that aligns with God's
[22:34] word nurtured by humility and fear of
[22:38] the
[22:38] Lord and is free as James said if any of
[22:42] you lack wisdom let him ask of God that
[22:45] giveth to all men liberally and abrath
[22:47] not and it shall be given
[22:50] him so Paul could say in in chapter 2: 7
[22:55] of 1 Corinthians but we speak the Wis
[22:58] wisdom of God in a
[23:01] mystery even the hidden wisdom which God
[23:05] ordained before the world unto our Glory
[23:09] now now that's why this wisdom he's
[23:11] talking about is not something that you
[23:13] get from intellectual knowledge but he's
[23:15] talking about a present tense
[23:19] reality that that's really important for
[23:22] us to grasp because you know you could
[23:24] you could say from a a a studious
[23:26] standpoint you could repeat the words of
[23:28] Martin Luther repeat the words of John
[23:31] Wesley but there's a mystery that's to
[23:34] be revealed in this day this present
[23:36] tense day the mysteries of the son of
[23:39] man and all of those things so you know
[23:41] that's really what a mystery is is where
[23:43] something begins to be slowly unveiled
[23:46] but there's there's more to know and it
[23:48] keeps unveiling it keeps unveiling and
[23:50] it keeps unveiling and so Paul explains
[23:52] in
[23:53] Colossians that what a mystery is this
[23:56] mystery is that he's preaching
[23:58] is really can be boiled down to Christ
[24:01] in us to Christ in you the hope of glory
[24:05] even the mystery which has been hid from
[24:07] ages and from Generations but now is
[24:09] made manifest to his Saints to whom God
[24:12] will make known what is the riches of
[24:14] the glory of this mystery among the
[24:16] Gentiles which is Christ and you the
[24:18] hope of
[24:19] glory you can see what a mystery is too
[24:21] when you start thinking about that
[24:23] there's a mystery of how you're born
[24:25] again a mystery of how you grow and a
[24:27] mystery of coming to maturity the
[24:29] mystery of what the Son of God is versus
[24:31] the son of man the mystery of adoption
[24:33] and all these things that and this is
[24:35] what Paul's talking about when he's
[24:37] preaching we speak to you the wisdom of
[24:40] God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom
[24:44] this mystery that he's
[24:46] preaching in 1 Corinthians chapter 2
[24:50] verses 8 to 10 he goes on to say and
[24:53] I'll I'll be closing in just a moment
[24:55] here which none of the princes of this
[24:57] world knew
[24:59] for had they known it they would not
[25:00] have crucified the Lord Of
[25:02] Glory but as it is written I hath Not
[25:05] Seen Nor Ear heard neither have entered
[25:08] into the heart of man the things which
[25:10] God hath pref prepared for them that
[25:12] love him but God hath revealed them unto
[25:15] us by his spirit for the spirit
[25:18] searcheth all things yay the Deep things
[25:21] of God so there he's talking about as he
[25:24] as he's closing out this chapter he's
[25:27] talking about revelation
[25:29] it it that this is such a beautiful
[25:31] these two scriptures I hath Not Seen Nor
[25:33] Ear heard in other words the Hidden
[25:35] Truths of God that previously were
[25:38] inaccessible gel didn't have any way of
[25:41] understanding or unveiled through the
[25:44] holy spirit that all these things that
[25:45] are so mysterious because we've got
[25:48] access by the Holy Ghost he can he will
[25:50] teach us and make these things plain to
[25:53] us so then we can take we we can learn
[25:56] from that that there is no aspect
[25:59] of divine knowledge that is beyond the
[26:01] spirit's
[26:03] reach you know if you really meditate on
[26:05] what this is saying he says as it is
[26:07] written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard
[26:10] neither have entered into the heart of
[26:12] man the things which God hath prepared
[26:13] for them that love him so if you stop
[26:15] right there there's no way of knowing
[26:18] these things but you keep reading on and
[26:20] he says but God hath revealed him unto
[26:22] us by his spirit for the spirit
[26:25] searcheth all things yay the Deep things
[26:28] of God you think that God is slowly he's
[26:31] unfolding his mystery to us where things
[26:33] that seem unreachable at first the
[26:37] spirit keeps unfolding it until it
[26:39] becomes more and more plain until we
[26:41] know what the future home's going to be
[26:44] like we start getting glimpses of things
[26:46] that are to be it's it keeps unfolding
[26:49] until we can see it more and more
[26:51] plainly and that's why brother Brandon
[26:53] would say in a hidden life he said and
[26:55] I'll close on this as the musicians come
[26:56] now when the Brethren receive the baptis
[26:58] AP ISM of the Holy Ghost they said this
[27:00] is the summit this is all of it but
[27:01] Brethren that's wrong there is no Summit
[27:05] to God's
[27:06] power we move on and on and on it's the
[27:10] unlimited resources of God has never
[27:12] been tapped yet blessings and powers
[27:15] that we know nothing about it's never
[27:17] been even revealed to archangels as
[27:19] laying just ahead for his church that we
[27:21] believe for Eye Has Not Seen Ear Has Not
[27:24] Heard neither has it entered the hearts
[27:26] of men what God has for them and store
[27:28] that love him now here's the clencher so
[27:31] let's move up and claim our rights when
[27:34] you start thinking that you can't
[27:36] understand and you've hit the wall no
[27:38] that ain't what the scripture is saying
[27:40] that ain't what Paul's saying it's time
[27:42] to take a hold of God's word move up and
[27:45] claim our
[27:46] rights and we'll stop right there and
[27:48] continue on next time with what man
[27:50] knoweth the things of a man save the
[27:53] spirit of man which is in
[27:55] him we're not educated into the Body of
[27:58] Christ but God reveals himself to us by
[28:01] his Spirit God bless you Saints amen
