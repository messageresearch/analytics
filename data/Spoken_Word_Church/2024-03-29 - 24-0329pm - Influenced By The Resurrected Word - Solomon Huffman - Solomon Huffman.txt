as our brother comes and speaks for US Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you oh I want to see [Applause] you oh the Eyes of My [Music] Heart Open the Eyes of My Heart I to I want to see [Music] you see you high and lift up shining in the light of your glory Glory pour out your power and love holy holy holy I you lift it shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love holy holy [Music] holy amen holy holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see you amen is that your heart's desire tonight amen uh just reading the the prophet in a certain area up at the top all right and the prophet told us he said if we had a desire for God to see us or for us to see God rather that he would make a way for us to be able to see him and I believe if we desire that and we look for it that God will make a way that we can see him and uh more than anything in my life I want to see him in his power and His glory and the power of his resurrection and I believe that God is able to make a way that we can see him amen and we certainly didn't come here just to see one another as much as we love that and we love to fellowship with one another and see familiar faces and friends but more than anything we want to see him amen and I believe that if we have that desire and expectation the prophet taught us that God would never disappoint us and so we believe that with all of our hearts we just just want to go to the Lord in a word of prayer and before we look to the word if you have a need upon your heart why don't you just lift your hand up to the Lord and ask him to remember you and speak to you and uh I believe with all my heart that God still answers prayer and God still moves he still restores he still refills and uh the limit is what our faith is and so I believe our faith should raise to the occasion so let's just bow our hearts together father Lord we love you with all of our hearts tonight Lord and we're so honored and prived to be assembled together Lord on this side of Eternity one more time and Lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy and for the opportunity to stand in your presence and Lord what a wonderful presence as we just feel like one great big family here tonight Lord and we know it's because we're United under the greatest message that struck the face of this Earth since the time of Christ and Lord we believe we're all Lord here gathered together under one common cause and that's to see you Lord and the power of your Resurrection Lord as we're celebrating such a wonderful time lord as you rose from the dead and Lord you ascended upon high and gave gifts unto men Lord because of all the P the price that you paid you made a way that we could be here and Lord we just want to thank you for that and we believe with all of our hearts here today Lord that you're not in a tomb buried somewhere in Jerusalem but Lord you're here in the power of your spirit and the power of your word and we believe that with all of our hearts tonight Lord we just invite you into this building we pray Lord that you would Minister to your children may you encourage the discourage Lord may you bind up the broken hearted may you heal the sick and The Afflicted Lord all of these things are in your word and we know your word is your will so Lord we just ask you to help us to get out of your way as we look to your word Lord may you just anoint our hearts and our ears to hear and receive what you have for us and Lord when we leave this place may we have the testimony that did not our hearts burn within us as you spoke with us along the way bless us now Lord as we look to your word we humbly pray these things in The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ amen and the church said amen if you have your Bibles we'll go straight into the scripture in the Book of John and the 20th chapter we'll begin reading at the 19th verse and you pray for my voice we've been uh ministering the past two nights in a row and I just somehow worked out we were night after night after night so uh you pray that the Lord will help me and uh I believe that he will and we just greet you tonight in the name of the Lord and certainly count of a great honor and privilege to be here and speak to you and we've heard so many wonderful things about this church my first time being here but I believe we're all part of the family of God and uh some of these brothers here I know brother Aaron and brother uh Louise and brother Bob and many of you people I don't know but I believe that in eternity we'll all have a lot of time to get to know one another and uh we all have the same father and we all love this message with all of our hearts and we're United under it and I believe that with all of my heart and so we just say God bless you uh tonight and we want to read here uh in in John 20 and 19 the Bible this would be what we would call a post-resurrection scripture it is after the Lord uh has risen from the dead here in John 20 and 19 the Bible would read this then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you now we know that the prophet took a message out of that in Shalom and said that was the message to the bride uh that it was Shalom amen a message of peace and when he had so said he showed unto them his hands and his side and then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord amen you ever been there before when you when you see the Lord and causes you to be glad and then Jesus said to them peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost amen Mark 16 let's read the 14th verse down to the 19th this is also after Jesus is resurrected afterward he appeared unto the 11 as they sat at me and I braided them with their unbelief and Hardness of Heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go ye unto all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature we know that was the commission that Christ started and Christ has not took away that commission but that's still our commission in this in time is to go to the world and preach the gospel and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned very simple scripture and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils and they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into into heaven and sat on the right hand of God we just pray that God would bless his word as you can be seated I don't know if this is a monitor here if you can help me any way on the monitors would help my voice a lot but we want to speak to you uh tonight on uh if it would title I want to speak to you on influenced by the resurrection amen influenced by the resurrection as we read that scripture there in John 20 a very very powerful scripture and I believe we can see prophecy uh that lays within that scripture there in John 20 then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you so I want you to notice it was at the evening time that the Lord came to them and was shut in with the disciples and begin to uh reveal to them who he was and we know that that happened in the evening time and the prophet here in the message evidence of the Resurrection very powerful message he said here and notice all through the day he had been bringing the word but no signs when he got them inside and shut the door and sat down oh brother that's when he revealed his resurrection amen when they got them inside and shut the door he revealed his resurrection no time from the morning when he met them until the going down of the son did he do it he never did one thing that he did in life only just the word but notice at the evening time it was at the evening time that's when he proved his resurrection amen at the evening time is when he proved his resurrection so we know uh that the Lord did not prove his resurrection a as soon as he res resurrected from the dead he did not prove his resurrection as soon as he uh came out of the Tomb there but he proved his resurrection at the evening of that same day he did not do it in the morning and just to just to stop here we know that the Lord did not prove his resurrection there in the Ephesian Church age or or all throughout the other Church ages but God uh again has proved his resurrection in this evening time Amen in this ly and church age there has been a return of the resurrected Christ upon the face of the Earth in the form of his word amen and he has proved himself again in this end time to be alive and to be well we know the prophet taught us that he said that that all throughout the church ages they've been bringing the word we know that God sent a major prophet there at the beginning of the church ages in the Ephesian Church age and he sent a prophet at the end of it and all through between that would be reformers that would try to reform back to the word but we know at that very end age at the evening time is when God would come and would perform that Messiah sign again and we know that that Messiah sign would be a proof of the resurrected Lord Jesus and uh here in the true Easter SE brother R would say this he said now for some 19900 years or maybe I'll say 14 or 1500 years he said why the church has had him sealed away the church has had him sealed away but he said it shall come to pass in the last days saith God and the prophet said see there's nothing going to stop it that there will be light in the evening time and the works that I do shall you do also it shall be light in the evening time and notice this he said I don't care how many seals you try to put over God he will break every seal he broke the Seal of the Tomb he broke the Seal of hell he broke the Seal of death he broke the Seal of the grave and arose forever more and tried outfit over the grave over death over hell over tombs and over every manmade thing that there was to show that he was God and cannot be sealed away from the people anymore now listen friends amen the church wanted to keep Jesus in the Tomb they they're fine as long as he's lord they're fine as long as he's Messiah they're fine as long as he's savior but but you don't let him be ruler and don't let him be Supreme Lord over my life and listen friends amen the Church world out there has tried to put him in the Tomb and we know what the prophet taught us he said what has the church world done today that they had put them back on a cross he said what they do they took and denominational Roman Creed nails and they crucified him back on the cross they they did not want that resurrected Lord in their church but listen friends what a difference the bride of Christ has from the nominal Church World brother if the Lord ain't here we don't want to be here if he's not here in the power of his resurrection we don't want to be here either amen what a difference we say Amen don't put him back on a cross he only had to do that one time amen let him be here in the power of His might he said there's nothing they could do to seal him in the Amen in that tomb anymore nothing could hold him I just love this he said my the grave could not be du deep enough hell could not be hot enough and nothing could hold him him he broke every seal with that great amen with that great Easter seal that he was sealed with amen how they tried to seal them away we know there in the scripture that they set a watch and they they tried to seal them there they they tried to stop that Resurrection from happening but I tell you friends I'm so glad to know that there's not a power Amen in Hell upon the face of this Earth that was able to hold him and keep him in that tomb and there's still not a power on this Earth today that can hold our Lord down and that can keep him from moving in the power of His might and I believe that with all my heart and as you read that scripture it was at the evening of the same day and my the evening time is just a special time isn't it amen the evening time that there's so many scriptures you can go into amen but as you look there in that scripture at the evening time that he breathed on them the breath of the Holy Ghost at the evening time is when he revealed himself to cleopas and his friend it was at the evening time that he he did something you say what was he doing he was trying to influence their faith he he was trying to in amen isn't it powerful that when he resurrected from the dead he didn't go to Pontius pilot and go to see and go to all the kings of that world Amen he didn't go to all the Earth and say look at me I'm the one you put on the cross and I'm the one you did he didn't reveal himself to everybody he was not worried about having influence on them but the people that he did go to he he went to a a man by the name of Peter that was a discouraged fisherman and that was down and out and said they they put my Lord in a tomb and who did Jesus go to he went to Peter and he and he went to his disciples and what was he doing he was influencing their faith by the power of the Resurrection he was influencing them to tell them hey I'm not in a tomb no longer but I am alive forever more you say what did he do he went to deliver them from their discouragement and he went to deliver them from any unbelief they would have and listen friends the same Lord Jesus wants to do the same thing in the evening time in this church hey I'm not serving a different Lord Jesus if he came to Peter in a time of discouragement surely he's the same God and he could come to us in our time time of discouragement and do a familiar thing amen ain't that powerful you look at those two that was on the road to and there they're sh in you know the scripture says they constrained him to come in they constrained him to come in amen and Jesus is there teaching to them brother Wade we know the scripture says that he was there teaching them all the way from the book of Moses and said the Lord your God shall raise a prophet like unto me and he started at Moses and all throughout the day Christ had been bringing the word and bringing the word and they still didn't know him they still didn't know this was the Lord in his resurrected form but when they got shut in amen Jesus did something that was familiar we don't know exactly what he did but he did something familiar and their eyes come open and they knew him and listen Church in this evening time we have seen the we have seen the side of the m and we have recognized there that's the same thing that happened with the woman at the well that's the same thing happened amen when philli called Nathaniel and said come see this man and he said Phillip oh he said Nathaniel before Phillip called Mee I saw you and you was under the Fig Tree amen friends that was all they needed they realize this is Messiah and I tell you what friends TR amen for the True Body of Christ when the Lord begins to amen sweep down into the church and begins to move in the power of a spirit the preacher don't have to tell you he's here amen the amen your neighbor don't have to tell you he's here you'll see him in the power of His glory amen and you'll say I'm glad that I saw the Lord I'm glad that I saw him move in his Sanctuary amen you'll have a revelation that's none other than the Lord when they saw him they were glad they were sad when they saw him they were glad they they weren't unhappy you you take a Believer friends when they when they see the Lord moving in power and moving in anointing they are glad when they see that they're they're happy let me just say this there is nothing like the presence of the Lord there ain't no there ain't no higher high than when you get in the presence of God Almighty there's no better peace than when you get in that presence there's no better life amen outside of living in the presence of the king amen it's amazing when you study the ministry of Christ those 33 years he was upon the Earth and you would think being the very Messiah everybody would know him everybody would recognize him but you realize the prophet taught us something he said he only came to those who were looking for him amen he only came and revealed himself to those who were looking for him Amen in Awakening Jesus the prophet says it this way he said now remember it won't go to everybody when Jesus was on the earth not over onethird of the Jewish race ever knew he was on the earth amen but he says this he said you know that he come to the elected he come to the elected and they received it amen listen it ain't a coincidence you came across this message amen it ain't a coincidence you come across the truth amen because you're elected of God Almighty that is the reason the truth has crossed your path and you recognized it because you was elected to recognize it he come to his elected and he revealed himself that as elected amen as great as he was yet he only revealed himself to a small class of people he could have went to all the Earth he could have went to all the nations but he did not do that amen I've heard but now I see the prophet in another place he said just the elected understood who he was just think about it amen the elected understood who he was maybe 3 million people 3 million Jews on Earth but maybe only onethird of them knew who he was he said see he revealed himself to those who were waiting he revealed himself to those who were waiting to those who were looking for him and I I be to study in some of these areas and it took me back there to the three mag eyes there in the New Testament and we know the prophet taught very powerful things about those three mag eyes he said those three mag eyes they were constantly looking up into the stars now I'll come back around to my text here in a minute but they were constantly looking up into the Stars how many knows that God had three Bibles the prophet taught us he had one in the stars and one in the pyramids and his written bible that was God's three Bibles and those three M eyes were they were they had their eyes fastened upon the stars and they knew when this star lines up with this star and this star lines up with this star that means that Messiah is on the face of the earth when God's Bible in the heavens lines up in this manner it means that Messiah is on the face of the Earth and brother their eyes were fixed upon that star and it influenced them amen it influenced them and as they look to the Stars it led them to where the Messiah was are you hearing me tonight amen it led them to where the Messiah was and when they came to the Messiah what did they say they said we have seen his star and we have come to worship Him and oh my it's the same exact thing in this evening time amen God has sent a star on the face of this Earth amen he was the Earthly messenger he was the Earthly star and he has influenced us back to Christ the word and listen we did not come looking for William Brandon but we came and the star has led us back to Christ you cannot separate this message in Christ you can not separate this message and the Bible it is the unfailing revelation of this Bible you can't separate it brother sister amen we have seen the star and it's led us to where he is is that right let me tell you friends amen the prophet in our in our generation he didn't come to lead us to a church he he didn't come to influence us to his ministry or or to a denomination or or to this or to that he come the influence us to turn our hearts back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers that's exactly what he came to do he come to put the influence where it needed to be it was the message of restoration and I say my heart has been turned amen my heart has been restored unto the faith of Jesus Christ amen they saw that star friends and it led them to where he was Hallelujah you ever want to amen you ever want to get led to where Christ is just look to the star amen listen friends the prophet taught us he said look at all them Pharisees in the days of Jesus they were looking for him he said but they was looking in all the wrong places they was looking for the corridors of Heaven to open up but the prophet said they missed him because he came in a way they did not think he would come and their eyes did not see him because they were looking in the wrong place and let me say this friend [Music] be the only one calling all the shots I don't think God he should be the only I think what is it it's that Spirit of the devil I I don't think that God should be the one doing all this I want to be like him I want to be like the most high and what did he do he came to all of the angels and begin to preach to them we know the prophet taught us these thing he be to preach to a third of the angels and said listen guys let me let me give you a most beautiful sermon we know the devil's a good preacher isn't he all he has to do was give you 99% truth with just 1% falseness and I'll have you whipped completely right there that's exactly right it was just one word in the Garden of Eden that threw the whole human race into the fall that's exactly true and Lucifer is up there in the heavens and he he begins to preach into the angels and we know the Bible in the Book of Revelation said that by the tail of the serpent that he drew a third of the angels with him and we know I think God for this message don't you he said it was not the tail of the serpent it was the t a l e that he said and he was such a good preacher that he had so much influence to them and the Bible said he deceived a third of the angels in heaven so don't you ever tell me the devil ain't a smart devil he is don't you tell me he's not a good preacher he is a very good preacher if he could preach such a good sermon that he could deceive a third of the Angels what do you think he's doing on the Earth today he's going out to deceive that's exactly the truth and he came in and broke the influence that was there and we can see this Spirit you you know the prophet taught these things and it's so amazing to see that trail of the serpent throughout the Bible amen I'm just going to stop right here and put this in here amen y'all know the prophet talked about how he wanted to go home and preach that that sermon the chur of the serpent I I you may call me crazy but I believe he has been throughout all these messages he's been preaching that trail of the serpent he he showed you he showed you how the Revival would produce twins and he showed you Cain in the beginning and and going bring him all the way through amen Nimrod and the Tower of Babylon all of these different things amen the prophet I believe without taking a sermon and preaching to us that trail of the serpent he had been preaching the tra of the serpent the whole entire time constantly exposing the enemy and exposing how he works and I'm so glad tonight we're not here ignorant of how the devil works but we know his devices and we know how he works according to the message of the hour amen watch that serpent there in the Garden of Eden he comes to Adam and Eve or he comes to Eve there and begins to influence her begins to tell her well you know I I I don't think it's too big of a deal if you do this or if you just take a amen if if you just disobey the word of God just a little bit it's not that big of a deal what is he trying to do he's trying to break confidence in the word of God she should have always stayed right with that word is that right she should have always kept close to that word she should have always said you know what God Said the day I eat thereof that day I shall surely die and what the devil say one word he said Thou shalt not surely die and just one word threw her amen threw her into depression thre her into death through her into sadness so don't think we can get by with just something really small we know the Bible teaches us it's the little foxes that spoil the vine it was just a little variation from that word and the victory was out of their lives and Revival was out of their lives listen friends to get off the word in one ioda is to get off the word in its entirety but listen this bride will not be a bride that is off of the word she will be a bride that's in the middle of the road and she will be a bride that is obeying every single word of God listen friends the devil was a good preacher he was a powerful preacher and he had a lot of influence and he came to Eve and one over her trust is that right she said hey I've gotten a man from the Lord amen she amen her trust have been amen uh gained by the serpent there listen friends that's exactly what the devil wants to do to you and I he wants you to give a little ear under his lie he wants you to give a little ear under his reasoning that's exactly the devil for you just give a little ear unto reasoning give a little ear unto an opinion about the message or an opinion about the word that's exactly what the devil wants to do but listen friends I'm so glad there's been a word of Prophecy that has been spoken over this bride he said what was that word of Prophecy amen the prophet of God prophesied over this bride and said how that first Eve she had the capacity to fail but the second Eve in this end time he says she cannot fail she is made in such a way that she's not able to fail amen if I was you I'd look at devil in the face tonight and say devil I am made with a word of Prophecy over my life and you will not influence me unto your lies you will not influence me to your deceit I am made with the prophecy over my life and I'm not able to fail you say how can you say something like that because the prophet of God prophesied that word over this body no matter your disappointments and no matter what the devil tries to put on you you are made with the ability to not be able to Fe and the devil says you're going to fail the devil says this and the devil says that I amen I tell that devil devil I'm made in a way that I cannot fail amen I made with a word of Prophecy over my life listen friends listen there there's a prophecy over this bride there is an influence over this bride listen I believe I'm looking at people here tonight that has been influenced by the message of the hour you have been influenced by a perfect word and I tell you this when you come under influence of a perfect word it will influence you to be a perfect bride if you only had partial word then you might be a partial bride but you don't have partial word today you've got perfect word and it will cause a Perfect Bride that's exactly righten I thank God we live in an age that God has sent us the word he he has restored the influence of the original word amen the message influence the prophet says it this way he said I want you to be influenced by Jesus Christ and his word he said he is the word amen listen friends I believe that we have the Living Word with living power living anointing this word's alive can you can you say Amen to that this word is a Living Word I I I don't serve a dead letter God I I don't serve a god with dead word and listen friends this message is not no dead message this Bible is not no dead letter and no dead word this is the most powerful word you can read it's got the power to change your body it's got the power to change your attitude it's got the power to change your family oh God this word is a powerful word amen and it will influence you if you'll let it I said this word will influence the church if you I say it's time that the church let the message begin to influence him Amen Let the message influence him you say what will it influence us to it will influence the power of God back into the church it will influence worship to be back in the church it will influence the victory of God to be restored back into the church that's exactly right y'all know the prophet preached that message influence seven times amen one time he would title it their influence of another I thought that was amazing by the way seven times the prophets speaking on influence I thought on that you know amen it's a perfect influence and that's what God is looking for he's looking for somebody that will be perfectly influenced by the word because God's looking for a Perfect Bride is he not he's looking for a Perfect Bride and the only way God will have a perfect bride is if she comes under perfect influence of the perfect word which is the message of the hour am me listen I make no apology for that th this message is a per perfect message this message is a a message of perfection he said you you're making William Brandon God you're making him perfect to the blood he was perfect I understand he had fought some failures but this message is a perfect message and it will produce perfect results every time I think it's time you try amen why don't you just try it for a minute why don't you why don't you be influenced by the tapes and be influenced by the message I'll tell you this it will change your home it will change the atmosphere in your home and you will let it influence you that's exactly right I tell you this this message ain't going to influence you to be some dead church member amen this influence don't amen listen friends I know men has made things that it was not but this message never took the worship out of the church it never took the shout out of the church it never took the victory out of the church you said who was it that did that it was the influence of the devil that got on men and made quote say something they didn't say that's exactly right made the scriptures say something it didn't say but if you'll take it the way the prophet said it brother you will have a church that's a repeat of Pentecost you'll have a church that they'll write another book of Acts behind it you'll have a church that the power of God is moving in freedom and liberty in the house of God at the message of the hour influences the church it will cause us to be the exact bride God is looking for that's exactly right amen we're here influenced by the resurrected word not by a dead word not by a dead letter but by a living word amen you take somebody you y'all know these simple things that the prophet would bring out but but we know God was hidden in Simplicity and revealed in the same manner amen but the prophet would talk about influence and and how things influence people and Spirits Influence People he he would talk about if you take the spirit of John Dillinger and you put it in the man he'd act just like him and you take the spirit of Beethoven put it in the man he composed music just like him I said if you put the spirit of Christ in a human vessel amen she will be influenced exactly like Christ and the life that he Liv will will come forth through the branches I say it's time we get plugged back into the vine and let the life of that Vine show forth through the branches that's what God is looking for he is looking for somebody that will pull from the life of that vine amen if you're if you're there in the life of the vine it will energize through the branches that's exactly right amen the prophet told us there in the church age book he said not for one minute do I bring a message to the people that they would follow me or join my church or start some fellowship or do this I've never done that and never will do that I have no interest in those things but he said I want to accomplish one thing and I'll be satisfied it's to see and the establish true spiritual relationship amen I say what to influence the prophet was trying to bring back to the church amen establish a true relationship between God and man wherein men become a new creation in Christ a new creation in Christ fill with the spirit and live a according to his word what was the prophet trying to do he was not trying to influence you to be like the preacher or to be like him or to be like the church he was trying to point you to Christ that Christ may be a supreme influence over your life amen I believe that with all my heart I I believe that the prophet has influenced us to the word he promoted the word amen with all of his heart this message is here to get us ready amen is that right amen this message is here to get us ready you say What's it here to get us ready for it's here to get us ready for the change of our bodies listen friend God is not coming looking for your message books God is not coming looking for the churches book he's coming and looking for a people that the books are not only on the books but the books are in your life God is not coming the Rapture some message books one day he is coming the Rapture the bride off the face of this Earth that they were not just influence amen by the world and by the things of the world but they were so influenced by this word and her and the word had a uniting time and the Word was the bride that's exactly right you'll find that the devil is trying so hard to stop the influence of this message and of this word is that correct he did the same thing with Jesus and that ain't that right he did the same exact thing with Christ said well he's be elub and he's a fortune teller and he's this and he's that you'll find that scarecrows are always round us something valuable ain't that right amen scarecrows are only around some and brother that's why I hope it's okay amen but that's why I it don't bother me when people are attacking this message you don't bother me when people Heen I think oh dumb devil look at you trying to do these things the only reason you're attacking it it's because you know it's the truth you wouldn't waste your time with it if it was a lie and old church amen the devil would not waste his time on you if you were one of his children Hallelujah he would not waste his time trying to discourage you and trying to make you lose the victory if you was not a child of God the devil will leave you alone amen what a rejoicing moment we ought to have to say devil the fact that you're battling me it's a revelation that I'm not your child and I'm not your son but I'm a son of God and the only reason you're attacking me and my family and my marriage and my home is because you know I am a son of listen friends amen the devil sees something in you that you may not even see the devil amen that Maniac of gadera right he came to Jesus said why are you come to torment me before my time he recognized he looked in those eyes brother Bob he looked in those eyes of Christ and said why why have you come to do this to me and he saw God living behind those eyes of the Lord Jesus and listen friends you may not feel it you may not see it sometimes but the same devil when he looks in brother Bob's eyes he sees that same purifier amen that was trapped in the body of Christ and he says oh no not a son of God not a true daughter of God why have you come to torment me before my time I say devil if you thought I torment you you just go ahead and keep waiting hallelujah amen you just keep waiting because you've not seen anything yet I tell you what amen it's time you start tormenting that devil that Devil's been running you around and been doing this to your home and this to your amen why don't you why don't you tell that devil boo devil amen boo devil amen who are you anyhow you're a son and daughter of almighty God that has been influenced by the perfect word I tell you what we need to do is get influenced amen get some spiritual stimulation or Revelation and let that revelation of the word take over your being you get somebody that's really influence you got a dangerous person on your hands that's exactly right why do you think the devil surrounding Jesus and he's beyb he's this he's this because he knew this man's got a powerful influence ain't they right this man's got a powerful influence when Peter was there going into the streets they have the testimony aren't you one of the disciples you you you talk like that man you you act like that man but they took note that Peter had been with Jesus I think I think our co-workers ought to be able to take note we've been with Jesus I think our I think our family ought to be able to take note that man has been in prayer that man has been with Jesus he has been influenced by a supernatural being that's exactly what the devil was trying to stop he was trying to he was trying to break confidence in Christ so re realize this friends if the devil can break confidence in the word the the the the influence of the word leaves Al together if he can break your confidence in this message the message will no longer have an influence over you I'm just going to gohe and preach here for a moment if the devil can break the the the the confidence of your pastor here here he'll have no influence over you say well that's just brother Wade being brother Wade that's just brother Wade act just brother but listen when he steps behind this pull pit anointed by the holy spirit that is the holy spirit speaking to you and dealing with you you may think it's just a man but it's man under inspiration of the spirit of God and you ought to respect it and you ought to obey what God is trying to bring to you but listen let's let the proper influence come back in the house of God let's let the word amen truly influence our lives I say granted Lord amen Matthew 4:4 the Bible tells us here but he answered and said un them it's written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word you'll live by every word not die by every word you will live by every word and when you search that word what's it mean to live it means to be fresh ship means to be strong it means to be powerful it means having vital power you will live by every word of God listen this word is going to produce a powerful church this word is going to produce a powerful believer listen friends power has been restored back into the hands of the Bride is that right I'm not here without no power I'm not here and we know our power is in our Authority is that right amen we're not here some weak powerless church but you're the most powerful people on the face of this planet that's exactly what the Bible has said and is trying to influence you to a life of power we shall live by every word of God by the word of God we shall be Lively we shall enjoy life we shall be fresh and be strong and be powerful amen you find Jesus after his resurrection we'll turn the corner here you find Jesus after his resurrection he comes to them and tells them go on to all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature amen isn't it amazing that the word is coming to bring influence to those lives and he's putting the church into a state of action he's putting the church into a state of action amen Jesus don't come to them and say go into all the world and just go play tapes go into all the world and you let brother bandham do all the preaching and all the you go into the world and preach the gospel listen friends God Amen when he came back he he gave them a message of action I've just been studying some of these things and the prophet talked about Isaiah and he talked about them cherubims that was around the throne he said them cherubims had they or them serams rather the the Angels there he said with those wings that they covered their eyes and covered their feet he said what was it it was shity and reverence he said and those angels were flying around the throne he said they was in a state of action and the prophet said that's what the church ought to be we ought to be clothed in humility and clothed and reverence and we ought to be about the father's business and we ought to be in a state of as listen I can show you as the prophet said where God started a book of Acts church and you show me where God ever stopped it is that right amen how many believes our Prophet was under the influence of the word amen how many folks in here believe that he was under the influence of this word amen we'll just keep on going a little bit deeper amen he was under the influence of the perfect word amen you look at him up there on Colorado Hill as that storm is up there and fixing the cover over the mountain and the Lord spoke to him and told him amen you speak unto it and it'll be what you say is that right amen you speak unto it and it'll be what you say and the prophet is there and he told that storm he said you go away for three days that's exactly right you go away for 3 Days amen and and exactly what the prophet said to that storm up on Colorado Hill it is exactly what happened you said what Ena the prophet to to be listen friends I don't believe it was just a one man Ministry I don't believe the power of the third pool was just in one man I don't believe the power to speak the word and God perform it was just for the prophet but I believe if we'll get influenced by the same word that the prophet influence brother you will speak over that storm and you will speak over cancer and you'll speak over any demon power that is trying to hold you bound and the same God that did it for the prophet is the same God that will do it for the bride that's exactly the truth if it influenced the prophet in such a way that he's here speaking a squirrel into existence you give me one place where the Prophet ever said that's just for me I challenge you to do it he never taught it that way you give me one place where the Prophet said now listen folks this is just the oneman Min he never taught it that way he's constantly putting it out to the church and putting it out to the bride you say what's the prophet doing he he's trying to show you there is a standard that you can live to there is a power that you can live to listen friends I don't know about you all here tonight but I feel the tug in my heart I feel that deep calling in My Heart Lord there is more power out there there is more anointing out there there is more Victory out there there is more joy for me to have amen and I'm a simple preacher on these things and the prophet told me if there is a deep calling in you that means God has a deep to be able to respond to that listen friends if you're here tonight and you want more than the holy ghost that means there is more of the Holy Ghost for you to have if you want more Revival in your home that means there is more Revival for you to be able to have but you've got to grab on to and say Lord this is for me amen the power of the spoken word is for me it was not just for the prophet it's not just for a man but it is for the bride of Christ he say preacher you preaching like that you'll put a pressure on the people now it's not putting the pressure on the people it's telling you what's for them is that right it's telling you what's for them brother the Bob if something is for me I want to know it's for me amen if the power of the spoken word is for me I want to know it's for me ien if overcome and all to see and the God of this evil age and every temptation of this age if that is for me then I want to know it is for me he say why do you want to know it's for me me because I want to know what I can obtain through the grace of almighty God hallelujah well brother time the church just it just ain't that way no more we we don't have the power of the spirit we don't have these things and we don't have I say let's let the influence of this word come back to our lives amen if you're here defeated tonight what what's been influencing you if you're here with no Victory and no joy in serving God Amen let you didn't get that out of this this Bible and you didn't get that out of this message you got it from the voice of your adversary that is trying to rob the joy out of serving God he's trying to rob your peace he's trying to rob your Victory you are letting the wrong thing influence you but I say oh God May May the proper influence return to the Church of the Living God that we may be exactly what you want us to be Hallelujah amen I believe that the church will have a perfect influence underneath the perfect word you you believe that amen the way Christ started this church is the way he's going to end this church amen he started it with the power of the spirit amen amen a people that's there casting out devils and and laying hands on the that's the way God started it amen we know the prophet taught us that Pentecost was the pattern is that right I said let's let this word influence us let let's let this message influence our lives and it will create exactly what God intended for it amen listen friends God Did It for a purpose that right amen God sent us this message for a purpose he sent it to influence us he sent it to restore us he he sent it to restore our hearts back to the faith of the fathers I say it's going to it's going to happen amen what this message was sent to do is going to accomplish what was sent to do it will not return to God void but it's going to accomplish exactly what it was sent to do we believe that with all of our hearts we'll turn a corner here and bring it to a close shortly amen how many is thankful for the influence of this word how many is thankful for the influence of this message amen how many's thankful that God has restored the influence back to the Church of the Living God brother we we used to think it was just Pentecostal to to lift up our hands and the worship God and to shout his Praises we we used to put away amen and the prophet put all that stuff in its balance is that right he never pushed us to do it he said you just be who you are amen all things have been restored in their proper place and the influence has been restored that's exactly right amen all the influence has been restored sometimes God does things to influence our faith you believe that and mean God speaks a word over our life to influence our faith to influence our life we know the prophet is there and many times in the sermon people would come up to him and he' begin to discern now he would say now sir you've got more faith than you thought you had he said you was unconscious of it and then the prophet would go back into their life this Messiah sign perfectly he would go back into their life and say sir I see you at the doctor and this happened and this happened you say what's the prophet doing when he does that he's trying to influence their faith he said sir you've already got faith we know it's perfectly in the scripture God gives to a man a Measure of Faith ain't that right God gives to a man a measure of faith God has given you Faith but sometimes God does things to energize that faith and to Quicken that faith and I'll tell these men and these sisters here sister you've got more faith than you thought you had and then he'll go and say sister I see a vision and this is going to happen and this is going to happen and says sister you believe that don't you and she says yes I believe that and said it's going to happen exactly how you believe it what's the prophet doing he's influencing the faith of that person is that right he'll tell them a vision and it will so influence their faith that it will cause such a victory to come over their lives and they would leave that church service never the same person now and you all know that testimony brother where I'm told about sister Georgie Carter amen I'm sure many of you know that testimony but the sister there I believe had been uh raped by her uncle or something along those lines and she got this infection in her body and she began to lose all this weight and then she amen became just bedridden and sister George is there bed written and there amen she's there amen believing in Divine Healing and believing that God is able to raise her up and her family's a bunch of unbelievers said God don't do that no more God don't heal that no more and they were actually praying by the way they they were actually praying God keep these preachers away from our daughter they're giving her false hope and giving her false belief and and giving her but there was something in Sister Georgie that she believed that God was a Jehovah of Miracles she believed that God could still raise you up from a death bed and she believed that with all of her heart amen she had heard of the brandom campaigns and heard about what God had been doing and and people coming off the stretchers and coming out of wheelchairs and she believed that with all of her heart amen and the prophets there praying about going to pray for sister Georgie and we know the prophet goes there and he's there in the woods and he's praying and trying to find the will of God it's so beautiful he's praying and trying to find the will of God and the Lord shows him a vision of sister Georgie and she's up and she's walking and and she's there perfectly healed and then the prophet goes there and meanwhile God is dealing with sister George and she's here in a amen a vision or a dream or something along those lines and what she sees she sees the Lord Jesus walking to her amen and then by that time brother Brandon was actually there and he comes up to the door and opens the door and where it was the Lord Jesus here comes brother brand opening the door and comes to her and says sister Georgie I want you to know I saw a vision Hallelujah I saw a vision and in that Vision you was up and you was walking what was the prophet doing spoken word amen what was the prophet doing he was influencing her faith to rise to the occasion and said sister Georgie I saw you walking and brother said out of nowhere Here Comes such an anointing down upon her and sister Georgie that hadn't been able to walk she got up and be to walk but say I didn't know how she had strength to do it but somehow she received the supernatural strength to be able to walk and he says Sister George he got up and worshiping God and began praising God and she went outside and blessed the grass and blessed the tree he said preacher what are you trying to say that that's all good for sister Georgie well let me tell you about another Vision little bride amen the same prophet he had a vision of the preview of the bride and she was an Ephesian bride or she was an Ephesus bride and she was there in line with the word walking in line with the word is that right and then saw a preview of another bride and she was a worldly bride right and she was walking into the step of the world but then there was another Voice

brother a good hand you know I remember brother J everybody in here knows brother J forny J for told us a story a long time ago he said you know he said back when he was growing up of course he's my age and he was growing up during segregation you know and and the you know the blacks and the whites didn't didn't uh Jive too well the way he said it together he said but you let a white man get drunk and you let a black man get drunk that's right he said they'll slobber all over each other they'll tell them they love each other they go places to together cuz we're under the influence somebody say amen amen you get under the influence you get drunk with the Holy Ghost it won't matter you'll lose all Prestige you that's the way we're supposed to love each other only brother J forny could tell that story but good good to be good to be here tonight it's just good it's an influence it started and it's not going to stop it's going to keep going amen because the word won't term void and our brother just I believe he he he started the the um move of the meeting this weekend and and I was thinking while he was while he was preaching I thought man you'll quit doing that at 64 but you you'll slow down I hope you're not here when you're 64 that mean I'll be 154 so but our brother poured his heart out we sure appreciate that we we appreciate the hey I like that feror I like that that Zeal that's wonderful to have and but I thinking I said you know as we were talking about the at this time right now Jesus's body's getting cold his natural body's getting cold it's it's 8:50 let's just say we're back 2,000 years ago body's in the Tomb it's laying there brother Brown said cold dead in a grave he said the word was cold dead in the grave cuz that word was a word body right but where was Jesus talk about theophany where were we this time 2 years ago no we weren't born we weren't born natural we were inside of somebody that's right we were in King theophany in his mind where's he at right now he's not called in the grave no he go he's in hell he went down to talk to the devil that's right right and we went with him right that's why if we put ourself in Christ I've said you many times before I put you put yourself in Christ you already been to Hell you already been to Hell you got the Keys of the Kingdom now you got the king keys to the devil's house if you're in that same theophany that he was he wasn't in flesh he was in theophany amen went to hell that's right winess to the devil yes sir ain't that what we just did tonight witness to the devil that we're Gods little Gods we were inside that man and then he came up and when he remember when he resurrected we resurrected you believe that you believe that absolutely so you ain't got to go to hell no more you already been one time you ain't got to go twice you just got to go one time that's it so we already been to Hell we know what it's like down there and it's not hot cuz Jesus was down there it didn't bother him n it didn't bother him at all but you know what he did he come back back up and he picked up a group of people right he picked up a group of people and he opened the door and I love brother R could only one could tell a story like that opened the door and said said he knocked on the door and said Abraham opened the door said Sarah that's the man we fed a calf to that's right said Ezekiel was looking over his shoulder said that's a wheel and a m the wheel and they all knew him in the Revelation that they had but he was a man standing there in theophany that was Jesus that we got inside out of us tonight all right it's say 52 I ain't preaching amen but it just it just gives you it just gives us hope that's right and and Faith to know that that all that's already been done oh that's already been done like you said you know he saw hell brother Brown did he saw hell thank God he didn't see us there that's right right he saw his converts in The Other Place amen his converts were in The Other Place converts weren't in Hell amen amen so that's that's that's my whole I I don't put my faith on brother brandham I put my faith on what he preached to me that I can see amen cuz if I can see it I'm looking through the same eyes if he called us little Messiahs yes sir I've always believed this he didn't take it with him that prophetic brother R said it would take a prophetic people to understand this messag so where's what prophetic Prophet there's a prophet in there somewhere so there's a prophetic group of people and I believe they're standing here receiving the message as you said receiving it by the influence listen the world influences us enough out here that's right but we've already won if you'll just believe that we're sitting in Heavenly places our soul is in another dimension yes sir it's faster than whatever your Mom and Daddy brought to the earth I promise you that cuz this part till here but we're in Heavenly places brother Ram said he said that's the believer's position yes sir he didn't say the unbelievers he said the believer's position in Christ yes sir so we've been resurrected already we just like you said this is got to catch up with it amen my dad preached a sermon many many years ago called matching pieces he said what matches God's mind what it matches down here what was in his mind we're gone so we're heading toward that matching part we match we're going there nothing will stop it cuz he's already seen it and we believe in this church that God does not make a mistake amen we believe in this church I don't know if y'all believe in your church but I have to stop every once while y'all believe God don't make a mistake that's right and we say Amen cuz we know he doesn't everything he does is calculated perfect and he knows what he's doing and he put you in a good place buddy we appreciate your ministry that that was good let's give him another hand you just keep that fire going big guy and then us older people
