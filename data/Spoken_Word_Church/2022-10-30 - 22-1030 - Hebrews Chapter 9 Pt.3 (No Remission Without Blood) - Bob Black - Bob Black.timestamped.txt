[0:00] blessing to Sayer be with us sick
[0:02] brother Mike
[0:03] also brother collie down in his back
[0:06] lord and all the ones Lord to have
[0:08] unspoken requests we all have needs and
[0:10] we're just coming down and bless us
[0:11] today forgive us for all of our sins
[0:12] Jesus name we pray amen amen
[0:27] God bless you thanks good to be in the
[0:29] house of the Lord
[0:30] beautiful day I love this fall weather
[0:36] it's good to be a Christian
[0:41] oh God we're so grateful to be able to
[0:43] gather together with you today Lord and
[0:45] we just ask the Lord that you'll come in
[0:46] Among Us this morning Lord Jesus and
[0:48] open up these scriptures Lord as we
[0:49] study these things out Lord bless us
[0:51] bless brother Wade as he's prepared and
[0:53] bless our hearts Lord Jesus and help us
[0:55] Lord to be prepared to receive Lord in
[0:58] your name amen
[1:00] in Hebrews where where uh I keep saying
[1:03] we're almost to chapter 10. we really
[1:06] are
[1:07] um we're uh so Hebrews chapter 9 verse
[1:09] 21 just to kind of to talk about that
[1:12] for a few moments this morning it says
[1:15] moreover he sprinkled with blood both a
[1:18] tabernacle and all the vessels of the
[1:19] ministry almost all things are by the
[1:22] law purged with blood and without
[1:24] shedding of blood there's no remission
[1:27] you can't have remission without blood
[1:30] brother Brown would say and the law of
[1:33] having a shadow back in 1954 he said if
[1:35] a man lives good enough
[1:37] if a man lives good enough
[1:40] he'd be God himself if he could live
[1:41] good enough
[1:43] I said look life lies in the blood cell
[1:45] and without the shedding of blood
[1:47] there's no remission of sin innocent
[1:49] substitute has to take a guilty Sinner's
[1:51] place
[1:52] oh I want you to get this now notice an
[1:54] innocent substitute must take the guilty
[1:56] one's place
[1:58] and it happened in Eden that same way
[2:00] that when Adam sinned he cut off his
[2:02] fellowship with God the father and when
[2:03] he had sinned before he could stand
[2:05] before God God had to kill some sheep
[2:07] perhaps whatever it was and make it
[2:10] covering
[2:11] blood had to be offered in substance
[2:13] because the Bloods were life laid and
[2:16] God required life as Sin
[2:18] so it ain't how good you live is how
[2:21] good God Lives God is the one
[2:24] that it's God's life that paid the price
[2:26] and the water of Separation in 1955
[2:29] brother and said now God telling Moses
[2:31] and Aaron as he was the prophet and
[2:33] priest Moses the prophet Heir and the
[2:35] priest he said now I want you to go out
[2:36] and get a heifer a young heifer which is
[2:39] all one color one complete color red
[2:43] we always think looks of the red is
[2:45] danger red does signify danger or a life
[2:48] or so forth but red in the scripture
[2:49] signifies Redemption through the blood
[2:52] Rahab which he put the Scarlet streak
[2:54] down and all through the Bible is the
[2:56] Scarlet Street Redemption comes through
[2:58] red to the shedding of the blood and
[3:00] without the shedding of blood there's no
[3:02] remission of sin and how that God said
[3:05] go get this heifer this red all over not
[3:08] one spot of anything else but perfectly
[3:10] red for God looked through red and you
[3:13] know what color red is looking through
[3:15] red red through red makes white try it
[3:17] one time red through red produces White
[3:20] so when God looks through the blood of
[3:22] Jesus Christ
[3:23] to we who are Scarlet Red with sin and
[3:26] covered by the blood he sees us white as
[3:28] snow
[3:29] though your sins be red like Crimson
[3:32] they shall be white like snow
[3:36] in the water of Separation he said God
[3:38] looking through the blood he doesn't see
[3:40] you no more as a sinner he sees you
[3:42] redeemed you're redeemed because he's
[3:45] always sees you through Christ that's
[3:47] the reason we can be perfect
[3:50] not perfect in the sense of sinless
[3:53] we're perfect in the eyes of God when
[3:55] we're in Christ
[3:56] not not perfect in the sense if you're
[3:58] not going to make any mistakes through
[4:00] your your Christian Journey but perfect
[4:02] in the sense that God's looking through
[4:03] at you through his blood now
[4:05] foreign
[4:07] that's the reason he said be therefore
[4:09] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[4:11] perfect
[4:12] Paul in the 10th chapter of Hebrews
[4:14] trying to explain the law having a
[4:16] shadow of good things to come not the
[4:17] very image of the things can never make
[4:19] the come around too perfect because God
[4:21] was looking through animal blood but now
[4:24] he looks through the blood of his son
[4:26] Perfection come by Jesus Christ
[4:31] and the message Fellowship brother Brown
[4:32] said then that's Eleazar after killing
[4:34] the heifer burning her while she was
[4:36] bleeding he made a public testimony
[4:39] dipping his fingers and striping seven
[4:41] times over the door that's seven times
[4:44] if we had time to go into it represents
[4:46] the seven Church Ages Every age every
[4:50] person every time must recognize the
[4:52] blood for without the shedding of blood
[4:55] there's no remission of sin
[4:57] then before you could come into
[4:58] Fellowship he had to look up and
[5:00] recognize that something died in his
[5:02] Stead and went on before him
[5:06] he said in the message Fellowship every
[5:08] man today no matter how many churches
[5:10] you join how many pages you turn you've
[5:13] got to recognize that Christ died in
[5:15] your stead and went on before you making
[5:17] a way and through his blood you are a
[5:19] Sanctified vessel unto the Lord not your
[5:22] sanctification not laying in something
[5:24] you did but his sanctification through
[5:27] him who gave himself for us died in our
[5:29] stead let that Faith go to work down in
[5:31] the heart one time and watch what takes
[5:33] place
[5:34] now there's there's something to
[5:35] meditate on let that go to work in your
[5:37] heart one time and watch what takes
[5:39] place that it's not something you have
[5:40] to do but just believe in Jesus Christ
[5:43] that he's looking at you through the
[5:45] blood
[5:46] all of you you don't have to take some
[5:48] man's Theory you got the word
[5:50] that's right now in the Bible if we if
[5:53] we kind of meditate on this further if
[5:55] we go back in a little bit because
[5:56] chapter four
[5:58] and in Leviticus chapter four is where
[6:00] if you want to study that out a little
[6:01] bit further is where over and over he
[6:03] repeats the process if the priest has
[6:04] done anything wrong if the whole
[6:05] congregation has done anything wrong if
[6:07] the individual has done anything wrong
[6:08] if they've committed a sin of ignorance
[6:10] then blood will be offered and it goes
[6:12] through how that the sacrifice is
[6:14] offered and they you lay your hands on
[6:15] that sacrifice
[6:17] when the blood is sprinkled seven times
[6:20] because you're you're having confidence
[6:22] in faith that you're you're trans and
[6:24] what you're actually doing is
[6:25] transferring your sin to that animal to
[6:28] that innocent animal
[6:29] and you're taking the innocence of that
[6:31] animal and transferring it to you and
[6:34] now in the New Testament you're taking
[6:35] your your sin and transferring it to
[6:37] Christ and his innocence is transferred
[6:40] back to you
[6:41] know you think how powerful that is
[6:43] that's that's something real
[6:45] now Leviticus chapter 4 if we just
[6:47] meditate on this scripture and go back
[6:48] and it says in the Lord spake unto Moses
[6:50] saying Speak unto the children of Israel
[6:51] saying if a soul shall sin through
[6:54] ignorance against any of The
[6:56] Commandments of the Lord you know you
[6:59] think about our sin of ignorance
[7:00] you didn't know nothing you were
[7:02] ignorant about the gospel until you
[7:03] heard the word preached and even
[7:05] sometimes you hear you hear the word
[7:06] priest wrong and and so you're ignorant
[7:08] of the way that it's really preached but
[7:10] then your eyes have been light your eyes
[7:12] become enlightened and open and you
[7:13] realize that you've done you've done
[7:15] something wrong and you were ignorant
[7:17] before but now you realize your guilt is
[7:19] and and plain plainly displayed before
[7:22] you and so you come you come with your
[7:24] sacrifice like they did in the Old
[7:26] Testament you come and you lay your
[7:28] hands on that sacrifice because you were
[7:30] ignorant before but now you realize what
[7:33] what what position you're in
[7:35] if a soul shall sin through ignorance
[7:37] against any of The Commandments of the
[7:39] Lord concerning things which ought not
[7:40] to be done and shall do against any of
[7:43] them if the priest that is Anointed due
[7:45] sin according to the sin of the people
[7:47] then let him bring for his sin which he
[7:48] hath sinned a young bullet without
[7:50] blemish unto the Lord for a sin offering
[7:53] it's got to be without blemish but
[7:54] because he's you're he's transferring
[7:56] his innocence to you
[7:58] and he shall bring the Bullock under the
[8:00] door of the Tabernacle of the
[8:02] congregation before the Lord and shall
[8:03] lay his hand upon the Bullock's head and
[8:05] kill the bullet before the Lord and the
[8:08] priest that is Anointed shall take of
[8:09] the Bullock's blood and bring it to the
[8:11] Tabernacle of the congregation and the
[8:12] priest shall dip his finger in the blood
[8:14] and sprinkle of the blood seven times
[8:16] before the Lord and before the veil of
[8:18] the sanctuary
[8:19] seven times because speaking now just
[8:22] like every everything in the Old
[8:23] Testament is a type many things of the
[8:25] in the Old Testament are a type of the
[8:27] of the reality that we're living under
[8:28] now that now we're living under each
[8:31] Church age is sprinkled under the blood
[8:33] of Christ and every everyone that comes
[8:36] to Christ has to come but with faith and
[8:38] what Christ has done for us by shedding
[8:40] his blood
[8:42] and if you go down to Leviticus chapter
[8:45] 4 4 he he talks about the congregation
[8:48] of the whole Congregation of the with
[8:51] the whole Congregation of Israel's sin
[8:52] through ignorance and the thing be hid
[8:54] from the eyes of the assembly and they
[8:56] have done to see if it's hidden from you
[8:58] you don't know but when the gospel is
[9:00] preached when the message is preached
[9:01] then your ignorance is taken away and
[9:03] you realize and they have done somewhat
[9:05] against any of The Commandments of the
[9:07] Lord concerning things which should not
[9:08] be done and are guilty when the sin
[9:10] which they have sinned against it is
[9:11] known then the congregation shall offer
[9:14] a young bullet for the sin and bring him
[9:15] before the Tabernacle of the
[9:17] congregation
[9:18] and the Elders of the congregation shall
[9:20] lay their hands upon the head of the
[9:21] Bullock before the Lord you've got to be
[9:23] identified with it you gotta you put
[9:25] your hands on it
[9:27] except you put your hands on it
[9:30] except that that and sacrifice is dying
[9:33] for you that it's not just some ritual
[9:35] or something but that you're involved in
[9:37] it and the Bullock shall be killed
[9:39] before the Lord and the priest that is
[9:41] Anointed shall bring of the Bullock's
[9:42] blood to the Tabernacle of the
[9:43] congregation and the priest shall dip
[9:45] his finger and some of the blood and
[9:47] sprinkle it seven times before the Lord
[9:49] even before the Veil
[9:50] and and the priest shall dip his finger
[9:53] and some of the blood and sprinkle it
[9:54] seven times before the Lord even before
[9:56] the veil and he shall put some of the
[9:57] blood upon the horns of the altar which
[9:59] is before the Lord
[10:01] that is in the Tabernacle of the
[10:02] congregation
[10:03] and shall pour out all the blood at the
[10:05] bottom of the altar of the burnt
[10:07] offering which is at the door of the
[10:08] Tabernacle of the congregation
[10:12] you know many times they they stumble at
[10:13] what the horns of the altar meant they
[10:15] did they couldn't find it until one day
[10:16] they they uncovered a an altar that had
[10:19] been buried or or lost for a while and
[10:21] there was these things on the on the
[10:23] corner and you know that in the
[10:24] scripture talks about many times they
[10:25] would grab old to the horns of the altar
[10:27] when they got desperate you ever get
[10:29] into a place like that where you really
[10:31] get desperate that God would forgive you
[10:33] and that God would change change your
[10:35] life he put something on the altar you
[10:37] can grab onto and he shall take all his
[10:40] fat from him and burn it upon the Altar
[10:42] and he shall do with the Bullock as he
[10:43] did with the Bullock for a sin offering
[10:45] so shall he do with this and the priest
[10:47] shall make an atonement for them now
[10:49] here's the main the main punch line the
[10:51] main kicker and it shall be forgiven
[10:53] them when you come and you've done
[10:55] everything that God's required and you
[10:57] put your faith do you put your put your
[10:59] faith towards he is atoning sacrifice
[11:02] your sins are forgiven they're gone and
[11:05] you don't have to you thank God this
[11:06] morning you don't have to come drag a
[11:08] lamb into the church this morning or
[11:10] kill it outside but all you've got to do
[11:13] is put Faith put your faith in in Jesus
[11:15] Christ accepting that he died for you
[11:19] so John first in first John chapter one
[11:21] he said this then is the message which
[11:23] we have heard of him and declare unto
[11:25] you that God is light and in him is no
[11:27] Darkness at all if we say that we have
[11:29] fellowship with him and walk in darkness
[11:30] we lie and do not the truth but if we
[11:32] walk in the light as he is in the light
[11:34] we have Fellowship one with another and
[11:37] the blood of Jesus Christ his son
[11:39] cleanse us from all sin
[11:42] now there's a scripture that you can
[11:44] hang on to because that means he
[11:46] cleanses you from every sin no matter
[11:48] what you've done no matter what and and
[11:51] we'll you could unroll The Scroll of all
[11:53] the most heinous crimes murderer
[11:55] molester whatever it is all covered in
[11:59] this scripture that he cleanses you from
[12:01] all sin he can take all of that sin away
[12:03] all the if you've murdered your brother
[12:05] if you if you if you back talked if you
[12:08] if you've gossiped if you if you've lied
[12:10] if you lie to your parents if you lie to
[12:12] your children confess it to Jesus Christ
[12:14] and it'll all be taken care of because
[12:16] his blood
[12:17] you gotta you gotta go through the the
[12:20] the process though you can't just just
[12:22] say ignore it you got to put your hands
[12:25] on that put your hands on that sacrifice
[12:27] accept what Christ has done
[12:30] and that's what uh Charles Spurgeon was
[12:32] saying when he preached the sermon he
[12:33] said has it suddenly come to the
[12:34] knowledge
[12:36] the knowledge of your sin of ignorance
[12:38] the knowledge of any person here that he
[12:40] has sinned as he thought he had not
[12:42] sinned
[12:43] as some fresh Light broken in upon you
[12:45] and revealed to you your Darkness did
[12:48] you come to this house depressed in
[12:49] spirit because you have discovered that
[12:51] you are guilty and must perish unless
[12:53] the mercy of God prevent you then Come
[12:55] Ye common people
[12:57] who have discovered your sin and bring
[13:00] your sacrifice
[13:02] and they get us here already for you
[13:04] come and accept the sacrifice which God
[13:07] provides and let your sin be forever put
[13:10] away
[13:13] brother I'm sitting and identify with
[13:15] Christ he said in the Old Testament when
[13:16] a man wants to be identified at the
[13:18] house of God he took the most innocent
[13:20] thing he could find a lamb and he know
[13:22] the lamb was free from sin because it
[13:24] know no sin and he went and took the
[13:26] lamb and put his hand upon his head and
[13:28] confessed his sin and by faith he
[13:30] transferred his sins on the lamb and the
[13:33] innocence of the Lamb back on him
[13:36] now there's there's kind of the gist of
[13:38] this now to think about this is to
[13:40] meditate on this morning that you can
[13:42] your sins will be true everything you've
[13:44] done all of your past will be
[13:46] transferred to Christ and his innocence
[13:48] will be transferred back to you if you
[13:50] believe it
[13:51] and then the lamb died because it was a
[13:53] sinner and the man lived by an Act of
[13:56] Faith of obeying what God Said but what
[13:58] did he do we went right back out of the
[14:00] temple with the same desire he had when
[14:02] he come in because when that blood cell
[14:05] is broken which the Life Starts in one
[14:07] blood cell and when that blood cell was
[14:09] broken the life of the Lamb would not
[14:11] coincide or come back into the human
[14:13] life because it was an animal life
[14:16] the man went out with the same desire he
[14:19] had so therefore he committed sins
[14:21] continually all the time again but there
[14:24] come a time when God made us an example
[14:27] and he gave us the Lord Jesus and when a
[14:30] sinner puts his hands upon his precious
[14:32] head and confesses his sins and his sin
[14:34] is transformed or transferred from The
[14:37] Sinner to Jesus and the innocence of
[14:40] Jesus is transferred by the Holy Ghost
[14:41] back into that person
[14:43] he's a new creature in Christ Jesus
[14:46] that's where I want to be identified the
[14:49] Bible said he knowing no sin was made
[14:51] sin for us the reason he suffered was
[14:54] for our sins and it's no more than what
[14:56] is right no more than our duties to look
[14:58] at these things and see that these
[15:00] desires that we have that God put in us
[15:03] to create in us to make us to want to be
[15:06] like him
[15:07] yeah I I hope maybe this this morning as
[15:10] you as we meditate on these scriptures
[15:11] you can see the effect of the blood that
[15:14] the effect of the blood as it takes away
[15:16] the sin curse it will take it blots out
[15:19] all of your past but it also will
[15:21] transform your life to make you have new
[15:24] desires to make you want to be more like
[15:26] Christ to make you begin to walk in his
[15:28] footsteps so that that same life is
[15:30] Manifest in you so that the essence of
[15:33] the Old Testament law is fulfilled in
[15:35] your life because you're changed
[15:38] no you got that you got that that blood
[15:40] covering where Christ when you make a
[15:42] mistake you get back up again because
[15:44] Christ is looking at you through the
[15:46] blood but it's changing your life all
[15:48] the while
[15:49] and if God be with us then where is all
[15:51] the Miracles that brother said he was
[15:53] God of the Old Testament he was God of
[15:54] the New Testament he's the same God
[15:57] today yesterday today and forever and
[15:59] you know then down in your heart that a
[16:01] supernatural work has been done by a
[16:04] supernatural being
[16:06] when you once drank and smoked and lied
[16:09] and you women loved the world so much
[16:11] you kept wearing your makeup and your
[16:13] long or short hair and doing other
[16:15] things you did and you find out that
[16:17] something happens
[16:18] and all the devils in Hell couldn't make
[16:21] you do it again
[16:23] something happened a miracle was
[16:25] performed what did he do changed your
[16:28] vile heart changed your desires changed
[16:31] your nature a supernatural word by
[16:34] Supernatural God made a creature of time
[16:37] to a creature of Eternity took the world
[16:40] out of you and put Christ in you the
[16:42] hope of glory and you're filled with his
[16:44] spirit and ready to meet him
[16:49] so that's what Paul is talking about
[16:51] when he said it was therefore necessary
[16:53] that the patterns of things in the
[16:55] heavens should be purified with these
[17:01] I made a change last night and it's not
[17:03] here
[17:04] anyway what was that mean it was
[17:07] therefore necessary that the patterns of
[17:08] things in the heavens should be purified
[17:10] with these
[17:11] sometimes it's a little bit hard to
[17:12] understand what Paul's point is with
[17:14] these These Old Testament sacrifices of
[17:17] an animal but the Heavenly things
[17:18] themselves with better sacrifices than
[17:20] these with the sacrifice of Christ
[17:22] himself
[17:23] these are purified with these but these
[17:26] These are purified with the sacrifice of
[17:29] Christ for Christ is not entered into
[17:31] the holy Place made with hands
[17:34] which other figures of the true but into
[17:36] heaven itself now to appear in the
[17:38] presence of God for us
[17:43] nor yet that he should offer himself
[17:45] often as the high priest entered into
[17:46] entereth into the holy place every year
[17:48] with blood of others for then must he
[17:51] often have suffered since the foundation
[17:52] of the world but now once in the end of
[17:55] the world have he appeared to put away
[17:57] sin by the sacrifice of himself and as
[18:00] it is appointed unto man wants to die
[18:02] but after this the Judgment so Christ
[18:04] was once offered to Bear the sins of
[18:06] many
[18:07] and unto them that look for him shall he
[18:09] appear the second time without sin unto
[18:12] salvation
[18:13] you notice how how everything that Paul
[18:16] says is just packed it's like a little
[18:17] sermon unto itself could you imagine
[18:19] listening to to Paul speak these words
[18:22] and I'm sure many of them pondered about
[18:24] what what do you mean shall he appear
[18:26] the second time and now we can look
[18:28] plainly back back through time and and
[18:30] understand these things now if we if we
[18:33] kind of break this down in all the
[18:34] different Bible translations the Aramaic
[18:36] Bible in plain English says
[18:39] in this way also the Messiah was offered
[18:42] one time and he slaughtered in his
[18:43] person the sins of the many but the
[18:46] second time he appears without our sins
[18:47] for the life of those who expect him so
[18:50] the first time Christ comes and is
[18:52] manifested in the flesh this is the son
[18:53] of man he come to pay for the price for
[18:56] our sins but the next time he's coming
[18:58] to get you and to bring you to himself
[19:02] in the way my new testament it says so
[19:04] the Christ also having been once offered
[19:06] and sacrificed in order that he might
[19:07] bear the sins of many will appear a
[19:10] second time separated from sin to those
[19:13] who are eagerly expecting him to make
[19:15] their salvation complete to make their
[19:18] salvation complete in other words not to
[19:20] just die for your sins and and to and to
[19:23] put into the mouths of the disciples the
[19:25] ability to preach the salvation of your
[19:27] soul but to bring full Redemption when
[19:30] Christ comes the second time he's gonna
[19:32] he's gonna make your salvation complete
[19:35] so that you can take a body change a new
[19:37] revised standard version that says so
[19:39] Christ having been offered wants to Bear
[19:40] the sins of many will appear a second
[19:42] time not to deal with sin but to save
[19:45] those who are eagerly waiting for him
[19:48] but let's go back to what Paul said so
[19:49] Christ was once offered to Bear their
[19:51] sins of many and unto them that looked
[19:52] for him shall he appear the second time
[19:54] without sin unto salvation
[19:57] and brother man will say
[19:59] who's he going to appear to those that
[20:00] are looking for him he said now why
[20:02] didn't he said why didn't he do those
[20:04] signs for the Gentiles it never was
[20:06] performed for him by him why Gentiles
[20:09] wasn't looking for no Messiah
[20:11] they were heathens we were our people
[20:14] Romans and so forth back there with a
[20:16] club on their back worshiping Idols they
[20:17] wasn't looking for no Messiah and
[20:19] Messiah only comes to those who are
[20:21] looking for him that's the only way to
[20:24] them that look for him will he appear
[20:25] the second time
[20:27] just those who are looking for him
[20:29] not just to who pertaining but those who
[20:32] are really looking for him and notice he
[20:34] never come to Gentile that that miracle
[20:37] was never performed before Gentile and
[20:39] the unchangeable God now we've had 2 000
[20:43] years of scholarship and all kinds of
[20:45] things and now it's come evening time
[20:48] and now the Gentiles are looking for a
[20:51] coming Messiah
[20:52] so before it was the Jews looking for
[20:54] looking for him
[20:56] and so he came to them and they rejected
[20:58] him but now the Gentiles are looking for
[21:01] him and so those are the ones that he
[21:03] comes to now if he's the same he
[21:06] appeared the same then to them two
[21:07] tribes he's got to appear the same way
[21:10] there and promise though
[21:13] and it is I Be not Afraid brotherbraham
[21:15] said now when Jesus was on Earth he
[21:17] declared himself to be the Messiah and
[21:20] John declared there was a messiah sign
[21:22] following him and the Old Testament
[21:24] claimed there be a messiah sign and he
[21:26] proved that Messiah signed to the people
[21:28] that he was the Messiah
[21:30] how they know he was a god prophet
[21:33] Moses the one that they had followed
[21:35] said the Lord your God shall raise up a
[21:38] prophet like and unto me we know that
[21:40] we're aware of that and amongst the Jews
[21:42] and Samaritans she showed this sign
[21:45] but of course he never amongst the
[21:47] Gentiles because we were heathens in
[21:49] those days our people were Gentiles
[21:51] Romans we wasn't looking for no Messiah
[21:54] and Messiah only appears to those
[21:57] looking for him that's the way those who
[21:59] wait for him he will appear the second
[22:01] time so it would behoove us tonight to
[22:05] be waiting for him and watching for him
[22:07] that we do not miss it when he comes
[22:12] and what was the Holy Ghost given for
[22:14] brother said I can hear the water splash
[22:16] Yonder on the Ohio River when I was a
[22:19] little boy oh boy preacher about 22
[22:21] years old singing that there and I heard
[22:23] looked up above me and I Heard a Voice
[22:24] said look up here comes that big light
[22:27] hanging right Yonder Come moving down
[22:29] over me and said as John the Baptist was
[22:31] sent to forerun the first coming of
[22:32] Christ you'll have a message that'll
[22:35] forerun the second coming of Christ all
[22:37] right so now we know we know what we're
[22:39] looking for that as John the Baptist
[22:41] four ran the first coming of Christ to
[22:44] die for our sins there would be another
[22:46] Forerunner to come to prepare the way
[22:49] for the second coming of Christ
[22:52] oh how could I believe it but it
[22:54] happened just the same and tonight
[22:55] Revival fires I love this court I used
[22:57] to read this quote when I was when I was
[22:58] young this is this is amazing tonight
[23:01] Revival fires are burning around and
[23:03] around the world the great Ransom Church
[23:06] of God lifted herself out of that place
[23:08] and great campaigns of healing and signs
[23:11] and wonders and miracles showing forth
[23:14] the coming and so you'll see his coming
[23:16] you'll see him if you're looking for him
[23:19] the second time
[23:21] so we can see now I know I know for a
[23:23] lot of us sitting here this morning this
[23:25] maybe this is a is is dialing things way
[23:28] back going back to the very Foundation
[23:29] but sometimes you know you never know
[23:33] who who who doesn't quite uh see see
[23:36] things so um
[23:37] we're we're just kind of go slowing down
[23:39] a little bit to tackle this
[23:41] now you look at this pattern now John
[23:43] the Baptist John the Baptist went out
[23:45] and and he he identified Jesus there in
[23:48] the water that's the coming of the son
[23:50] of man baptizing this is the one I'm not
[23:52] even murdered the unlatch his shoe and
[23:54] those kind of things here he's coming
[23:56] I'm going to baptize him and and that
[23:58] conversation when Jesus there in the
[23:59] water to introduce the son of man and
[24:01] then you've got brother Branham there in
[24:03] the water baptizing as as the voice says
[24:07] your message is going to full run just
[24:09] like John the Baptist did now you see
[24:11] that pattern is repeating so now now you
[24:14] know we've there's been a lot of
[24:15] confusion all down through the years of
[24:17] what we should be looking for and the
[24:18] people got their eyes on the messenger
[24:20] instead of the one that's coming but now
[24:22] I think we can see plainly if you're
[24:25] looking at what you're looking for
[24:26] you're looking for that for that gospel
[24:29] message to be preached that introduced
[24:31] that reveals this the son of man that
[24:33] reveals Christ in flesh again
[24:37] so John in chapter chapter 3 he said
[24:39] they came to John and said uh unto him
[24:42] Rabbi he that was with thee Beyond
[24:44] Jordan to whom thou embarrassed witness
[24:46] behold the same baptizes and all men
[24:48] come to him John answered and said a man
[24:50] can receive nothing except to be given
[24:52] him from Heaven ye yourselves bear me
[24:55] witnessed that I said I am not the cross
[24:56] but I am sent before him he that hath
[24:59] the bride is the bridegroom but the
[25:01] friend of the bridegroom would standeth
[25:03] and heareth him rejoiceth greatly
[25:05] because the bridegroom's voice this my
[25:08] joy therefore is fulfilled and it's in
[25:11] the in that same in the same way we're
[25:13] rejoicing at the bridegroom's voice
[25:15] that's even why you know they call it
[25:17] the voice of God the voice of God
[25:19] Recordings because we're hearing not the
[25:22] voice of a man but we're hearing the
[25:24] voice of God the message that we're
[25:25] hearing did not come from some man's
[25:27] idea but it's come straight from the
[25:29] Throne of God and we know that because
[25:31] it actually uh
[25:32] illuminates these scriptures that we've
[25:35] pondered at for so many years about
[25:36] Malachi 4 and and Luke 17 and Revelation
[25:41] 10 and and all of these scriptures that
[25:43] have been probed at in Ephesians 4 and
[25:46] 2nd Peter 1 and things that that even
[25:49] the nominations cannot can only can only
[25:51] can can just probe it so John said he
[25:55] must increase but I must decrease
[25:58] what's increasing increase the
[26:00] revelation of Jesus Christ in that day
[26:02] the revelation of Jesus Christ in this
[26:04] day as the messenger decreased the
[26:07] understanding the word the manifestation
[26:10] of Christ in the midst of his people
[26:11] increased
[26:13] so Jesus Jesus said in Matthew chapter
[26:16] 17 as the musicians come and we'll close
[26:18] on this I had a few more slides I was
[26:20] going to show you the uh how the Jews
[26:23] are looking for Elijah and Elijah Elijah
[26:25] always uh he he coincides what they're
[26:29] looking when they look for the Messiah
[26:31] the Jews are looking for Elijah too
[26:32] because they know when Elijah is going
[26:34] to come Messiah is coming
[26:36] so Matthew chapter 17 Jesus said when
[26:39] they had lifted up their eyes they saw
[26:40] no man say Jesus only and as they came
[26:43] down from the mountain Jesus charged
[26:45] them saying tell the vision to no man
[26:47] until the son of man be risen again from
[26:49] the dead
[26:50] the second time
[26:52] and his disciples asked him saying why
[26:54] then say the scribes that Elias must
[26:56] first come and Jesus answered and said
[26:58] unto them Elias truly shall first come
[27:00] and restore all things but I say unto
[27:03] you that Elias has come already that
[27:04] seems like a perplexing thing to say
[27:06] that he's come already but he's going to
[27:09] come he's come already but he's looked
[27:11] for him to come and they knew him not
[27:13] but have done unto him whatsoever they
[27:15] listed likewise shall also the son of
[27:17] man suffer of them then the disciples
[27:20] understood that he spake unto them of
[27:22] John the Baptist
[27:27] but he's speaking of this twofold coming
[27:30] of Elijah that's spoken of in Malachi
[27:32] 456 behold I will send you Elijah the
[27:34] prophet before the coming of the great
[27:37] and Dreadful day of the Lord now John
[27:39] the Baptist didn't come before a great
[27:41] and Dreadful day of the Lord not like
[27:42] that great and Dreadful means like the
[27:45] world is going to burn with a fervoth
[27:47] heat and he shall turn the heart of the
[27:49] fathers to the children now here we got
[27:50] a two-fold coming of Elijah he shall
[27:53] turn the heart of the father in both of
[27:55] these he's got a the the the the the the
[27:57] understanding of the people had to be
[27:59] changed and I'm right at times so that
[28:02] they can be prepared for Christ to come
[28:04] on the scene he shall turn the heart of
[28:06] the fathers to the children the Old
[28:08] Testament fathers back to the new to the
[28:11] understanding of the to to receive
[28:13] Christ to the Pentecostal children in
[28:15] the heart of the children back to the
[28:17] original faith of the Pentecostal
[28:18] fathers lest he come and smite the Earth
[28:20] with a curse and I'm right at time so I
[28:23] gotta stop
[28:24] God bless you
