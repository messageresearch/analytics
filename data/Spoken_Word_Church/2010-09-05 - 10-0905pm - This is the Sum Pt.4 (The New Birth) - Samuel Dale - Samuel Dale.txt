afternoon amen amen we read in the Bible of lay to see you and oh how sad to see Christ outside the church door knocking saying please open to me oh Jerusalem Jerusalem that stone is my Prophet Nerf kill those I've seen to thee how of would I gather my children together but you would have none of me know you would have none of me now there there are those faithful elected and chosen and they live by faith in God's word they're standing outside the church door with Jesus they've had ears to hear and heard oh Jerusalem Jerusalem that stone is my prophets NE kill those I've see to thee how of would I gather my children together but you would have none of me know you would have none of me oh Jerusalem Jerusalem that stone is my prophet and have killed those I've sinen to thee how of would I gather my children together but you would have none of Me no you would have none of me I don't mean to change anything but I just wanted to tell you um you know many times you know you pray about things and you try to work things out in your life and you think you've got it all planned out you know and I I had in mind you know with my small business and the job at Keller Williams you know I had this plan that I had exactly what was going to work out and I was the last two months I've been saying Lord just help me work it out do what do I need to do something's got to happen I'm working so many hours something's got to happen well in my mind I hadn't worked out exactly what was going to happen so you know it was going to work out that the business was going to go take off I going to leave Keller Williams is going to be the business and poof there we go you know I'm fine it didn't work that way I lost one of my biggest clients and uh the business has gone way down but guess what the whole thing of the whole prayer was that I had more time for family I don't see my husband much as it is I see him a lot more um you know being there with Rebecca and being at home and doing all that but it wasn't the way I wanted it to happen but you know things just turn around usually it's not the way you think it's going to do you know but I thank the Lord that he does answer prayers and you know takes totally opposite track of what you're planning but that's the way it's supposed to go you know it doesn't matter you know that's the way it's supposed to work and um I just appreciate all he does for us I'm sure that just about everybody in here has experienced something like that maybe it's not as big sometime what have you but Lord have mercy I think feel like we need to we need to Worship in amen let's try this one right here amen 593 amen amen in the spiral book uh we've been didn't want to say anything about this or not but we've been I guess you know we've been uh videoing the services from the very get-go and uh we got a phone call yesterday about something you know guy really enjoyed what was going on around here and he wanted some information and what haveen like that so you know when you when you're worshiping you just think uh uh it's it's going out over the internet and it's going to India and it's going to Africa and uh somebody hear a name called and they'll say I like that name Lord you just go and touch the person that carries that name and that very prayer might be one that needs to the healing to come in I thank God for what he's doing today

because of what the Lord has done for us and now let the weak say I am strong let the poor say I am R because of What the Lord Has Done amen and this uh song that we're using now to bring the preacher out the minister out uh I don't know where I found it just heard it or what have you then I brought it up here and then he called on and there's people comes through here and they hear it and they take it you know but it's out there on the air you know but anyhow I just thank God that he's given us the eyes in our heart Open the Eyes of My Heart Open the Eyes of Open the Eyes of My heart Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see I want to see how do you want to see to see you high and lift up shining in the light of your glory pour out your power in love as we sing holy holy holy I am lifted up shining in the light of the morning pour out your power in love sing Holy Holy he's worthy isn't he holy holy Hool holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see amen and how do you see him you see him through the reveal word amen the only way you'll see God is through the reveal word right good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn back where we've been reading from Hebrews 81 and Ecclesia as 12 and remember the announcements we made we try to make them ever service where nobody can miss it and then it's out there uh on the internet to the people that way that can hear it and whatever so there will be a ministers meeting at brother Bill Yachts uh up in Tennessee and be this coming weekend I'll waiting I'll be leaving probably about 6:00 in the morning if any ministers wants to go with us be glad for you to do it then there'll be a fellowship meeting on the 18th in uh ohat Alabama at 3:30 and if you want to go along with us let us know be glad for you to travel with us um then we have two uh we also have two baptisms this afternoon so we've got two now if anybody else want to be baptized we truly want to you to be satisfied about it we uh we don't pull no bones we baptize according to what we believe in the Bible and can prove it in the Bible that nobody was ever baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost until the Catholic Church changed it about 3:25 ad and they kept it that way until the end time and then the word was to be revealed and restored we believe in the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and that's why you'll hear me say at the baptism to fulfill what Jesus said to bapt in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost I baptize thee my brother in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ cuz that way you can't argue about what I said cuz I tie together all what's in there so that's what we we believe it and we thank God for it all right so let's just you know remember that I'm trying to see if there's anything else I don't remember any Hebrews 8 Ecclesiastes 12 dear Lord Jesus author and finisher of our faith our Lord Our Savior Our Redeemer our all in all we thank you for the revelation of that great name that has ever kneel help to bow to the name of Jesus we know and love you father we thank you we ask you now that you would just come and speak to our hearts this afternoon as we talk about you as we read your word you speak to the hearts of the individual people we commit everything into your hands knowing that you are The Great I Am and thank you Father come down and touch the sick among us and just have your way we love you in Jesus name amen okay Hebrews 81 we read these same scriptures every time because we want to keep one thought on your mind what now of the things which we have spoken this is the PM in other words all he said for seven chapters he now sums it up in what we have such a high priest that is set on the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty in the heavens okay Ecclesiastes 12 verse 13 let us hear the conclusion of the matter all that Ecclesiastes has said is coming to a conclusion what is that conclusion fear God and keep his commands Commandments for this is the whole duty of man you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now if sister Brenda don't mind I may try to if I leave out some out of what happened you you let me know but uh we'll try to get the point across I asked her to you know sister Kathy was asking her to get up and tell it today something happened and and we want to just make sure you know and give God the glory for everything amen cuz we believe it and if I miss part of it then she can tell you about it but our sister was having a lot of trouble with her back and been praying that the Lord would touch her and and everything and you know to deliver her from the problem she was having and uh so she goes to the chiropractor well there was some way they was two different chiropractors or two different room things and the one that she was to go into she wound up that it was a uh empty you know they were out or something late or something some way and she goes into the room though and there's a man sitting in the room there and you know just one man by himself and the man gets up comes over to her and says you're having back trouble do you mind if I pray for you she said no of course not and I wish you would he prayed for her but she couldn't see the chiropractor right then so she left to go eat I think she was doing and she got over to realize I'm Healed she was totally healed of her problem with her back trouble thank God you send an Angel by to pray for you yeah amen he'll send somebody to pray for you so we thank God that he is on the same all right now what have we been doing taking and try to cover a whole scope of anything you know and that way then you know you can't say well we you leave out this you leave out that whatever and U you know to try to start in the beginning with something I love to do that and then be able to carry it all the way through and like I've always said to you you know uh you people will just say well I got this scripture I got this one I take this I'll take that or whatever they do and that's their business that's not mine I've just never been that way and I've always been to the bases that it's a carnal illustration but if if you see something in Genesis and you don't see the same thing in the Book of Revelation something happened somewhere you you know something changed because that's and you know God doesn't change according to uh um third what is it Malachi 3 I'm God and I change not all right so if you see something in Genesis and you start with one God in Genesis and then you wind up in the Book of Revelations with a trinity or something you you've got a problem see cuz you've gotten away from the truth all right see whatever you start with you must finish with that point but finish with it in the highest order or our portion that it can be you know amen see because it it'll just keep getting greater and greater and greater and greater and greater and that's the way I study the word of God that's the that's just always been my my thought of it I always make the carnal illustration a lot of people start off with a white dog and their Doctrine and Genesis and in the middle of it they get a speckled dog in the end of it they wind up with a black dog and they think man I got it I lined a dog all the way up through the Bible well that's what you done you lined a dog all the way up through the Bible you you didn't have the Bible right cuz it doesn't do that whatever you start with if it's a white dog you better wind up with a white dog not a pale dog or a pink dog or whatever you better wind up with the same thing you know and that way you can know for assurity you know uh of what's going on but I just want to ask you the question and then we'll get into the point of it of what is the new birth now we done this just recently at brother Boyd's at a we were having Bible study and some way another we all pretty well forgot what the topic was supposed to be and one brother had asked for the topic to be there but he was not able to be there that day had to take his mother and Daddy back to the airport so we just got to talking about the new birth you know well brother Joseph said well brother Dale I wish you would sometime just do that where we could we didn't have no tape insistency and he said I wish you'd do that sometime where we could get it on tape you know and everything and we'd have it now I'm not the final Authority I've never claimed to be but I believe that we serve a god that is the final Authority and I believe his word is and as I say in this morning that he has he sent us a prophet in the end time to bring us the message message you know so then we can ask the prophet to answer the things that we have need of and then we don't believe him as I said to be God or anything no he was Immortal just like any of the rest of us needed salvation just like any the rest of it had to be born again just like any of the rest of us had to face God had to have his own Rapture and Faith right all the things it has to be it's not because of you're specially gifted for something those gifts have a problem you know but now what I want to do is just go back though and this is way I like to cover anything you know and you say well now uh and you just go ahead and turn to John 3 and let's read that and we'll we'll get on to the point and uh then you'll see what we're trying to cover but it's always been in man from the beginning to try to find a way of Salvation And you remember we won't turn over to there but you remember over in the book of Acts that they asked the disciples the people that were there that had heard and they said men and Brethren what must we do to be saved it's always been within man's mind and his thinking is some way to be saved the rich young ruler asked Jesus you know as I was bringing out this morning you know what can I do to be saved all right because that's that's the point we want to be saved right that's the you know we want to we want to know that we're saved and and not wait and try to to uh put something on a basis that one of these days down the road uh somebody else going to take care of it for us maybe or something you know I I I believe in everything personal all right but look what happened here this great me man now he is the teacher now you say well verse 10 says he's a teacher but if you look at your little circle if you got a Scofield bible it reference you right back to the middle the original translation says Thou Art the teacher of Israel right that is the original translation see so then you may wonder about that when you're reading it and what we say now to be the teacher of Israel mean he was the greatest of all the teachers yes all of the teachers of Israel was honored to be able to sit down with him and to talk with him you know because he was the top knot teacher all right so he comes to Jesus and watch now verse one there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher now look at his confession we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou Hast done except God be with him that's right now that's a great confession right amen and watch when we get to it in a minute about it you say well all I got to do is confess well Nicodemus was doing quite a job confessing that he was a teacher sent from God now the way I like it is you look at the scriptures and it doesn't always jump out on you you know to understand what's taking place but brother random says on 141 of the church age book that Jesus said I am not the teacher I'm not a teacher that's what Jesus said he said but the Holy Ghost will be the teacher right all right so what was Jesus going to tell Nicodemus what he needed right he said I didn't come to be the teacher in other words I had come to explain it to you the Holy Ghost is going to explain it to you cuz that's where it's got to be with all of us so now look what he said Jesus said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be bornn again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he's old can he enter the second time into his mother's wound and be born in other words can I go back if you say I was born wrong would it change anything if I had another birth you know that some way I could go back into my mother's wom and I could come out again and see Jesus in other words is not written in there but Jesus bling the tell said well you just be twofold you know if you could do that but said that won't work see but he was concerned can he enter the second time into his mother's wom and be born Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I say unto thee you must be born again now that was the first doctrine of the Lord Jesus Christ as he was beginning his ministry and doing that was his first Doctrine what to speak to Nicodemus and said you must be born again you see Nicodemus was a very smart educated man that knew the Scrolls the scriptures he knew everything about what could be said about the Messiah he knew all of the promises he knew that the Messiah was promised to come out of Judah not to come out of the tribe of Levi when it looked like if he was going to be a high priest or anything he would have had to come from the tribe of levite cuz all of the high priest were chosen from the tribe of Levi right but Jesus was not from the tribe of Levi he was from the tribe of Judah and see Nicodemus could have went through a great hours and and it's not written there I'm sure they were discussing things it was not just a 15minute walk in hey you know Jesus said you must be born again you know God walks in the door you no no there's probably a lot not even written that we we you know we didn't need to know but the text of it the sum of it was that this man finally says now how can I go back into my mother's womb and be born again and see we say cuz we're on this side of that you know looking back to what we think is hindsight you know but we can say all Nicodemus had to do is believe well he must have been a pretty good believer because he did put his whole life on the line right cuz they caught him over there he sure been in trouble right even though he was the chief teacher right you know and he even witnessed as I said a moment ago that we know you're a teacher we know you're sent from God cuz no man can do the things you've done L it be of God pretty good witness so you say well all we got to do is just believe right that's a good point that's a good start yes but he didn't tell Nicodemus Nicodemus said I believe the message of the hour cuz he did he believed the message of the hour he confessed that Jesus was something great he had a pretty good understanding but yet when Jesus said you must be born again he said said I don't understand all right after 2,000 years there's been a lot said about the New Birth a lot said about what happens what takes place you know one group says you do this you're born again another group says you do this another group you know this just just all kind of any kind of a thing that you want to to to uh fit in what you believe you can go find it and there'll be somebody that will tell you if nothing else they'll tell you if you bend over and kiss their toe or ring or something that you'll be saved because there people that believe those things you know because that's so you give so much money to the church you do this that or the other but what is the new birth now first let's approach it from this side why do you need it why do you need to do birth see because you was born wrong that's right because of the sin in the garden every person in the world outside of the Lord Jesus Christ that's has needed a new birth that's right that's right whether it would be brother brandom or who it was you would have to have the new birth right right because we were all born in sin the pist says said in sin did my mother conceive me right now those Pharisees those Pharisees they knew the story of the Fall I believe and I've always since I mean you know since I heard the prophet and explain I believe those Pharisees knew what happened in the garden right I mean I believe they knew what that it was a sex act that happened in the garden that he wouldn't eat no apple amen right I believe they did go why would they tell Jesus they said we wern't born a fornication like you right they but our lineage is perfect blessing and they believe that that uh circumcision done away with their serpent Seed doctrine as we'd call are the fact of what happened in the garden they believe that literally took it away all right but see we must be born again because no matter what you think about what happened in the garden you would realize that we we were lost right right see and if if you're lost then you must be born again all right and there was no way in the Old Testament that they could have the new birth right now I didn't say they wouldn't wonderful people I didn't say they wouldn't great things taking place but yet still they needed to be born again right now the first proof that I would go to or the major one I gave you some quotes about some parts of it later but I gave you one that's on the back of your notes that really fits with me is to prove that you must be born again is the fact that in the animal life the animal life that was sacrificed in the place of the people of the Old Testament that animal life had no soul right right right so it could not come back upon the believer right it would cover sin right you know be a capo is the word is used it would cover sin but it would not eradicate right that's why Jesus the Bible says died once far off amen then you say well now I I believe those people back there had the new birth will show me how they got it right exactly am I mean it's just that's just honest how did he get it that's right right well he got it Believing on the Lord now you better back off that a whole lot because the devil believed right now he believed in one God right the Bible says and trembled about about what he believed that's right life to death us taught us a trinity but see what is the new birth he was born wrong there was no way back there that it could be David brother Rand gave you a quote where David he had God's word in his heart right that he wouldn't sin against him but there was no rain you know rain or a i n there was no reign of the spirit of God that could come to David to change his nature right he would go and offer a lamb for what he done wrong but he would go right back out and do the same thing right he go back and sin the same way cuz he had no way to take care of it he had nothing to change his nature amen right his nature was the same right so then down through there now you see God in what he's planning on doing because you can go back in Genesis in the the uh even in the creation of the world like we were talking about the other day there at the Bible study you go back and study the creation of the world and you'll see even in that that God was laying down what he was planning on doing right until he comes out to brings man into his image in his likeness in Genesis 1 but that's not Adam in a physical extent right CU Genesis 2 then Adam has created a human being right and what was in Genesis 1 was placed in Genesis 2 right you had a wonderful situation but yet he listened to his wife now what was the difference you say in the eternal life of Adam and what we talk about eternal life by the new birth Adam was by impartation he never had to go through right the stages of justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost to come out to claim a new birth right of course now a lot of people in the message today they don't believe you have to go through them things right it's just believing it's just the new birth is to believe the message you know just accept the message that's evidence ain't it that's not exactly what your Prophet said he said the evidence of the Holy Ghost was whether or not the spirit in you amen agrees with the word if it don't agree with it it doesn't bring a new birth you see you start off with a man in a fallen condition and the best he could do do was be like David as I said this morning with a an honest and a contrite heart in a man that he wanted to do right he didn't want to go out and do those things because for a human being to to be as he is and to be the difference between him and an animal see the animal has no uh Consciousness about him as to be able to you build his house the same way oh I know now they're getting into it yeah they're getting dogs that can talk and birds that can do but it's because somebody trained them it's not because now they're getting a soul because the animal life if there is a human if there is an animal that had a soul that animal would have been found and taken in our place exactly right that's right so he doesn't have that sure he has a Consciousness about him to a degree he has the things about about him that can be uh amazing yes almost looking human and sometimes probably smarter than Some Humans but not always right that's right cuz they can't reason out things they can't figure it out the way that it needs to be done you say well they got them now they'll PA yeah because they've been told you PA four times you get a piece of you get a dog biscuit yeah yeah that's just the way it goes but now listen that animal as I said had no soul so that individual person all he could do was have that believing part of him and God would use those things and man would be in you know he would do great things right there would be a lot of things happened but still it was not the new birth why because they had not been the death of the testator right right according to the scripture now before you can have a new testament you must have the Deb of the testat right amen we are the only people of the world of any religious form that demanded that our God had to die right you think about it right Muslim who you know whatever doesn't matter whatever religion you think of it doesn't demand that their their God die right but our religion demanded because no man could die for the other one that's right there's no way to do it sure we could die protect them from a bullet or something like that but we couldn't save their soul right so then man had to die be covered God would have to wait and would have to come himself amen but I don't believe Jesus was anything other than God Almighty I believe that he wasn't a second person or a third person he was not even the first person because if they was a first person there'd be a possibility of a second person and I'm quoting brother random right see so he was the person yes amen and you say well what happened did God die well you explain it that's right but the rest way for me to explain it was that all mankind was waiting upon and realizing they were Sinners right and waiting for a savior and one day God came himself in human flesh right you said what happened at Calvary then did God die the spirit left the body that's right the soul of that individual left the body because the way I believe in one true and living God see Jesus was almighty God he was born Lord the Christ according to the Bible right which means that what the body was the only thing that had anything to do with the human element right it was a creation right you better be careful how you bring that creation right go don't pick up a handful of dirt out here that's already corroded and rotten and St up in the A and let a body come out of it that's right no you better not do that you better do what your Prophet did that he took a message called Master peace and he took Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph and laid a foundation and then he took the prophets and build a body cuz Hebrews 105 said a body thou Hast prepared me and in doing that he buildt a body to step into right who was that standing on the shores of Galilee almighty God Soul and Spirit of God God dwelling in a human vessel that we call Jesus amen outside of that you're trinitarian come on are you're in the day where they've got the two Lords and you got the doctrine of the River Jordan people and what we call it that cuz that's just the way they believe Jesus wasn't god Till The River Jordan well if he wasn't god Till The River Jordan he become God then God left him who's he where's he at that's all I asked where's he at now all right that's just as simple I'm just I'm simple-minded and that's the way I think and I talk slow most of the time because I am slow you I think over what I'm going to say bless see where I can speak it and then you won't right trap me in my words but do you understand what I'm saying yes in the Old Testament there was no new birth right there was no way to be born again right if there was why didn't Jesus tell Nicodemus why didn't he say Nicodemus you're a good believer you really stayed with it all your life you're born again no he told the man that had stayed with it a man that had no sin no Mark of sin whatsoever connected to him or they'd kill him right he told me he said you must be born again what would he do if he's standing here today he'd say You must be born again but if you're not born again he said you can't understand you can't see the kingdom is what Jesus said all right so in that Old Testament there was no way for salvation to come to anyone right and in the New Testament you say we're in the New Testament now how'd you get in it blessing that's right I'm asking you a simple question well 2,000 years ago we started a new testament now you bless you got to have as I said and I'm quoting scripture you must have the death of the testator right before you can have the Testament right so Jesus Christ had to die to give his life that you and I could receive that life right see there's no other way than than coming that form because where would it come from and see he had to make a way for you and I to be born again he had to die that you and I could accept him as our savior and accept his life to come into us but outside of that we're still lost right you say as I said this morning ear last night was talking I ask most people you know I say okay turn to the first book of the New Testament right where's people going to turn Matthew that's not the first book of the New Testament Jesus was under the law he came to redeem them that were under the law that's why when he healed the people he said go offer the sacrifice of Moses right that he was still under the law the law was in existence until Calvary right then you say to me turn to the first book of the New Testament I'm won't turn automatically to the book of act right cuz that's where the Holy Ghost came but you see he had not been crucified let's read a couple of scriptures go to John 7 to just make the point but you see I believe you must be born again amen and that's not to just take a new idea that's not to join a church we've had all kind of doctrines to talk about what you could do to be saved but now that you know we've got to come to the right place right John 7:38 37 in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if a man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water right verse 39 but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive right for the Holy Ghost was not yet given right because that Jesus was not yet glorified right right right and see there was nobody then could receive eternal life until the day of Pentecost right there was no possibility of receiving it why because the testator hadn't died right right that's Hebrews 9:1 15-6 about the death of the testator so when Jesus Christ come and died he released his life 120 in the upper room receive that same life right dire Begins the New Testament amen because he was the beginning according to Revelations 3:14 Jesus Christ was the beginning of the creation of God right and on the day of Pentecost the creation of God came into being as Sons and Daughters right all right bringing the new birth see then they could receive the new birth there at Pentecost then 3,000 outside then they asked those 3,000 men and brother you know that's the ones that asked was the 3,00 are the people there among them men and brother what must we do to be saved said repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you see shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost right for the promis is unto you and your children and to them that are far off and many as our Lord are shall call right so then that begun the New Testament The Life of Christ amen they've argued over and over about Jesus when he said the kingdom is within right they've argued over whether he meant in him or in them or where was it at right it was in him right he was the king and the kingdom and he had to give his own life right where that Soul as I said about that animal that couldn't do it right right that soul and this individual could come back now my soul can't come back on you that's right right we don't believe it that way no amen but his soul came back on the day of Pentecost the prophet said in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost right H and every person that's ever been born again is born again the same right now I I know they come up with all of this um artificial insemination what that big words are uh all of these great things that they've done to bring children and all and thank God for it but still all babies are born the same right it takes a mama and a daddy to get one and it takes a birth to bring one right they haven't figured out yet how they can take the egg and the sperm and put it over in a tube and bring a baby they have to put it in a mother right right cuz it won't it won't produce over there right it's got to have some other way all right but now see I believe all new birs are the same right but now brother Dale I spoke in tongues and maybe brother dick cried and maybe sister Gail harded Hallelujah maybe Aaron screamed maybe this happened or that happened I didn't ask you what happened right I ain't talking about what happened what happened is according to your nature right brother randam even said one day he said if you're born again under an emotional atmosphere you'll be emotional he said if you're born again under more of a milder atmosphere he said you'll be a milder atmosphere because it's R but all birth is the same right all natural births are the same right see all spiritual verse yeah but this one group believe this one group believe that one I didn't say nothing about that you said I shouted I spoke in tongue all babies cry right right but the baby crying is not to birth right the baby crying is after the birth right see you're talking about the same thing I was this morning that drinking gambling smoking running around is not sin it's an attribute of unbelief you do them because you're an unbeliever you cry speak in tongue shout Glory Hallelujah See Vision why because you're a human being born into a real to where God can deal with you come on brother so get away from this the well I I got the evidence cuz I believe the message that has been the evidence in every age that's right amen right right every age the new birth was the same and every age the the proof was the same to believe the message of the age so don't go around and say well now they had one here and they had one here and we got this here and like I told you about in the water baptism people in this message has said we take acts 23 for our baptism but the denominations take Matthew 28:19 now I differ with you totally that's impossible that's incorrect if the denominations would take Matthew 28:19 and get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right that would be the thing was it's all the same am see do you understand what I'm trying to make a point yes but you see I know what them brains are sitting there looking at me you know why cuz if I was out there I'd be looking at me too you know what their brains is doing they're sitting there thinking but he don't understand I spoke in tongues when I was born again and so and so he done so and so when he's born again you didn't listen that's right wake up right right right the baby cries after it gets in the world right the new birth is a birth get the birth right right then start talking about what's going to take place right you I mean this it's amazing I was reading the other day even to show you how animals will do if you heard this one that just recently happened where this uh little uh donkey uh zebra it's half zebra and half donkey was just born and you know parts of it looks like a donkey parts of it looks like a zebra and it's so amazing until a donkey itself just lays flat down when it falls down goes to sleep a zebra lays down with his legs to where can watch cuz he scared right and you know the little baby lays like a zebra looks like a donkey sure we in all kind of things like that but that don't change nothing it took a a sperm and a egg to bring whatever was brought that's right right right and see that's the way it is in the new birth amen right all right now do you understand what I believe whether you believe it or not I believe the new birth is the same for everybody amen whatever age you in it's the same y amen the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost is the same holy ghost that gives you the new birth today now you show me some other way that's not right it's got to be that new birth all right if it's that new birth then every Born Again believer has the same New Birth just as every natural baby has the same natural birth right now I know they going into the cians and I just but I said natural birth amen okay right all natural births are natural but now listen so Jesus said to Nicodemus well Nicodemus all you got to do is believe the message oh all you got to do is shout speaking tongues and and Nicodemus would have looked at him and said we've been through all of that stuff right that wouldn't what I ask you right I asked you what are you talking about you said I need to be born again I want to know what you mean right I said okay I'll explain what what I mean you got to be born again right and if you'll look in original translation the original translation says You must be born from above where was Jesus born from am come on where did Jesus get his natural birth from sure wasn't Joseph and Mary right and it sure wasn't Mary and the Holy Ghost got together right cuz that's what the denominations think they think Mary produced The Egg and God produced the sperm to put it in there and that would make mankind being sinful because it would be coming from Eve that was sinful so it's not God created egg and sperm both and brought a natural birth into being and that was the birth of the word right right because I thought my Bible we read it says in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God and then we jump over and quot quote verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us we beheld it as only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen I thought we believe that his birth was the worth of the word right right I thought we believe like the prophet spoken words re the seed he said there was 120 Little Seeds laying in that upper room waiting on the Holy Ghost to fall right but you say but what about those in the life of Jesus that accepted him and the Bible even says and they believed on him right that's true you can believe on him too and never be saved that's right you said but all I got to do is accept him but when did he accept you now I'm quoting brother brandham now right okay amen when did he accept you you know those disciples walked with Jesus for three and 1/2 years right heard him preach all these doctrines and right at the last they wound up saying you know we're about a halfway getting to where we can understand what you're talking about he said now do you finally believe well you know that didn't make them saved that's right they still had to go to the upper room amen right like the the brother R said about the Catholics we don't thr off on them but you know Mary the one they Glory so much in she had to go to the upper room to receive the new birth right didn't set her aside just because she bed the body and didn't have anything to do with it but you see then what we're trying to get to Nicodemus he couldn't comprehend Nicodemus all you got to do is believe you know just believe well he's doing a whole lot more than we do believing and you say well I've accepted him as my savior but has he accepted you you say what but now brother D all Abraham could do was believe Abraham believed it was counted done to him for righteousness I'll agree with you but what God do to Abraham God gave Abraham the sign of circumcision right right he gave him that as a sign he had accepted him has God given you anything to show on that you've been accepted right well I I don't know what the new birth is well read what your Prophet said it is and it should be enough to what we've already preached but let's just read a little bit I gave you these today I don't you give I give notes every once in a while but I give you these I for a message called inspir spiritual inspiration U paragraph which is e 4956 128 see a Fell's coming around he saiding I do this and I do that I don't do this and I don't do these things well I go to church sure I believe in God I believe Jesus is the son of God now listen to it every devil in hell believes the same thing as I said the devil believed in one God and trembled about it taught us a trinity and laughed like everything at us made fun of it he knows there's just one God like we talking about last night he could handle every one of those angels CU Daniel go to the Book of Daniel and you'll find that Daniel was hindered 21 days that he could not come Gabriel was hindered 21 days he couldn't come to Daniel right he said until your prince came Michael so Michael come in took over and says you go ahead I'll take care of this old boy you know why cuz he cast that old boy out of heaven in the beginning Satan never could understand about Michael right right like I was telling him last night here stands God and and the devil is the anointed sherub that stands beside the Lord in his creation and he looks down and he sees Gabriel and wormwood this one and that one and that one and all he I'm number one and all at once a little Halo of light just goes out like that right and he begins to say Let There Be and that was Christ which was Michael and Satan never did understand that but you know what he knew one thing for certain that was the guy that Dred him out of heaven right but he's been trying all the time to get enough force and power I told him last night you ought not let your kids watch these movies of what's called Mortal Combat and stuff like that because they believe in that they made it look so real until they believe that if I like if I was battling Aaron that if I kill him his soul comes to me and gives me more power oh my see that's what the devil thinks devil thinks that the more power he gets by getting people the more people he gets and the life thing they for all idiot does is wind up in the resurrection trying to draw everybody back up there to help him fight it ain't going to take but one man to get rid of him and that's Christ amen that's the guy okay let me get out of that all right every devil in hell believes the same thing that's right I wish you people come to church as much as the devil does that hurts don't it he never misses that's right that's right that's right watch every devil in hell believes the same thing now you talking about the devil's in hell they publicly confess it come on watch that's right the devil said we know who you are the Holy One Of God publicly before thousands confessing him to be the Son of God they wasn't saved I'm still reading conversion is an experience Born Again notice how glorious what a wonderful thing yep yeah see them demons when they was cast out there they said right the legions and things y why don't you come to torment us before you time see the Devils confessed that he was the son of God mankind said you are Bells right those Pharisees and Sadducees says you're bsub the devil said you're of God cuz they knew that's right so what is the new birth next message number two on you note E1 Corinthians book of Correction 57 uh 0414 and how it must be there's not another way for a man to ever be saved without being born again y God willing he said I want to preach on that because it's materializing in my heart brother randam what is the new birth okay let's read it 1963 728 which is Christ The Mystery of God revealed look Christ in you makes him the center of the life of the Revelation right look what it does Christ in you makes you the center of the life of the Revelation see Christ's life in you makes him the center of the Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible a complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing right see what God's trying to do what is the new birth then you say well brother brandom what is the new birth it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you right and what see not you joined a church you shook a hand you done something different you set a Creed you promised to live by code of rules but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place is Christ Pastor priest whatever it might be is Christ in you then is a the Revelation that the church was built upon is that what Jesus and Matthew was right you know was talking I mean there in in Peter and Matthew right th art the Christ the son of the Living God what is the new birth brother R it's revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you now where's he talking about all these shouting and crying and everything everybody says and proof of the message or whatever where where is all of that brother R say it's revelation of Jesus Christ right now he said a revelation of Jesus Christ so we're going to read a little bit more about that but he said the Revelation you say well now if it's that way Brother D I just read my way into it it's got to be revealed amen you can memorize every scripture in the Bible and that don't mean you're saved that means you got a good memory but you can have a revelation of one thing and be saved it's in the same message I think it's page 4 five Christ my God revealed I believe that's right where he said it's Jesus Christ revealed in the most illiterate person amen right oh so it sure ain't no education is it in the most illiterate person brother Dale you mean you believe in the illiterate person can be saved yes and so ises your Prophet cuz he said it amen I believe God can make himself simple enough until can save the most illiterate cuz Hey folks you don't know what's going on in that little mind you know yourself there's a lot of intelligent people that cannot even speak or say anything right but they're very very super intelligent that's right but he said the most illiterate person could be saved amen cuz all they got to do except Jesus Christ and watch going down to the next one PMA Vision that be 60 1204 the evening service paragraph 71 now ask God while we're talking on Revelations because he was in The Book of Revelation ask him to give you a revelation of this for it can only be known by Revelation now remember no man can call Jesus the Christ except it be by the Holy Ghost that's exactly right no man can call Jesus Christ except it be by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen Butz other than that you're saying what somebody else say yes so now what do we say it for it can only be known by Revelation and you can only be saved by Revelation right I don't need no Revelation well you can't be saved then right cuz watch he's using the scripture but you can't be saved until it's revealed to you and we'll let me go back you can only be saved by Revelation you have a knowledge of it intellectually but you can't be saved until it's revealed to you no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost that's what the Bible says no man can say Jesus is Christ until he has received the Holy Ghost he might say the Pastor said so the Bible said so them are true the church said so that is true but you don't know yourself until the Holy Ghost has revealed it to you and he's become in you no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost not by knowledge not by intellectual the next one what does he say he says you cannot be saved without faith that's in the message perfect Faith 1963 8:25 you can't be saved without a revelation you can't be saved without faith the Bible said he that cometh to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of them that diligently seek him all right so the only way you can be saved is by Revelation for God to speak to you and tell you that you're saved it's not what somebody else tells you right I've heard people say when brother randam comes back one of these days Under the Tent I'll get under that tent and he'll tell me I got the Holy Ghost well that's all right if you got it but if you ain't got it where you going to get it you know I mean if it took you all these years you ain't got it yet is he going to do a magic trick and give it to you no see the new birth is the revealed word that's the whole thing of the Book of Matthew Mark Luke and John I wish you would read that over over over and over and see how that the seed that the so was to sow the so was the son of man which was the Lord Jesus Christ he s De seed into that 120 or into more right because there was over three over 500 brethen see him after his resurrection but only 120 held on right so if you'll notice he gets in there and says about The Parables the soord went forth to S it fell on Stony ground fell on this fell on but one of them says they took the word and held it what was the difference in the 120 in the upper room and the 500 that saw Jesus after his resurrection the Bible says 500 right Brethren saw him after his resurrect where was the other 380 y right they didn't believe it right well now brother Dale don't make it so bad probably Joe had to go to a funeral well let's get into The Parables then one says I married a wife have me excuse mother said I've done this I bought some cows and I got to go look at them don't be silly about it they didn't make it to the upper room the most important thing that could have ever happened in a human mortal right but till some way got into that upper room right and waited on the Holy Ghost to follow right but yet they didn't count it worthy right that's why I said read Matthew Mark Luke and John you'll see the story all the way through there shows you they never got to a really believ in condition seeing the sick heal the dead raise all kind of things happening the same thing said but yet they never did get saved right only that 120 now some of the others could come on later I come on right but listen what is the new birth brother random it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally you right well brother D I believe the message well that's wonderful that's just being able to read you want to go to the Token message and let me quote from that the prophet of God said that's just being able to read you believe Jesus was the Christ the devil says you're the one sent from God yeah did it save him you say well now then what do I do brother Dale one thing you need to remember the Bible says no man sought God so you think all the time in your life you've been seeking God no it's not it's God seeking you because you're totally in you're you're you're opposite you haven't been seeking God it's God been seeking you why don't you just slow down long enough for him to catch up with you amen you know we've tried to save ourselves Al until we got out of the saving business to work that it doesn't even work anymore that's right because we tried to save ourselves what good thing can you do that you might have eternal life was not that a question ask the Lord Jesus what good thing what reason do you think that God saved you you know what you get out of a lot of people of course they ain't going to bring it out in front of me cuz they know what I've already said so you won't say it but a lot of people says well I didn't drink reason God saved me I never smoked or chew or run around women that's why God saved me and you know you can even quote brother brandom cuz remember Brother brandom 13 14 years old when he was dying going down you know you remember what he said he said the only thing I can say Lord I never committed adultery who he goes back the other way that wasn't what brought him back right yes but I just I I just wouldn't like brother Donnie I just don't really see how God could save him oh Lord he don't need it that's why I said it here right sure I didn't drink I smoked as a kid throw it away cuz I didn't care nothing about it never even got a habit out of it or anything like that I never did like to cuss cuz I like my teeth to stay where they was at and I saw a lot of people that use vulgar words got them knocked out right I'm just sensible but you know that didn't save me right I can understand why the great Apostle Paul would stand there that a man that was a Pharisee of the Pharisees a Hebrew of the Hebrews concerning the law he said blameless y but did that save him no right no didn't save him he said I'm the chiefest of Sinners right you know what the chiefest of Sinners is that's a guy that don't sin so don't think how goody goody you was that made it to where God saved you because the chiefest of Sinners is the guy closest that don't sin come on somebody give me a definition is that right right chiefest means you're the top means you didn't sin it is mean chiefest of Sinners did he Sinn the most well see Paul found out he's lost have you ever really found out you was lost I've been in the message I born in the message yeah they don't mean a thing to God that's right means a great wonderful thing of Life yes very important yes he raised good amen cuz I don't believe what the Bible says that Paul said then you saying that let us sin that Grace May abound I don't believe in going out living like the devil where God can save me don't you worry about it you was lost I was lost amen we didn't need to be dirty to get God to save us that's right right we need to die ourselves and accept him as our savior amen and ask him to come and live in our heart right brother Gary back there he can tell you about a battle he had with it we called it the Battle of I20 cuz he's riding I20 going to Alabama and back and he'd call me and he'd say Brother D I'm doing pretty good I said well great one day he called me rest area on I20 he said it's over with now brother Dale God has just come right here and give me the new birth Hallelujah I said Thank You Lord hallelujah amen cuz it's a person amen a person that comes to you amen a person like another person like you know like something don't be silly ain't no way to take another person and put another person down inside of you that's right it's not that way it's a spiritual condition right it's the life of God that comes in to convert the nature of the individual person amen right that's what the new birth is that's why they couldn't have it in the Old Testament right amen as great as they were they could not be that as great as those Pharisees and Sadducees were they were not born again right they had to die to their own self and get born again you said look at all them good people that's right hell will be full of good people that thought they were going to heaven right because of something they done or didn't do that's right you said no brother Dale Hey listen I come through them enough I understand we used to have a homosexual that he loved to paint the church well I'm sure when they died they painted him into heaven cuz he painted the church right why that brother paved the parking lot don't tell me he ain't in heaven well what that got to do with it right I like the way old U the guy that owned laterno years ago up at tcoa he was really a multi-millionaire guy and he said he said I started giving 10% of my salary right from my company and everything and he said you know what I kept increasing it he said I wound up giving 90% right of the income and I couldn't spend the 10% right that God was giving me to live off of right right that's the kind of person I like I like the story of JC Penney youve heard it where the JC Penny started off with little small things kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger and finally got where he couldn't go to church cuz he didn't have no time one old preacher went to see him one day and he said now miss pennies he said you've been missing a lot we worried about you and he said yeah I've got to work this my business is so big everything is so great well I don't have time to go to church old preacher said well let's pray and then I'll leave he got down right beside old JC Penn and he said Lord he said Mr Penis has got too busy he said so why don't you burn turn down his buildings take away all of these things away from him see he felt a hand holding him said hold it you don't have to go no further he got the point right Rebecca got the point while ago right Hallelujah sometimes we don't get things exactly like we think we want them amen but we get what God wants that's right right but you understand what the new birth is it's simply accepting Jesus Christ as your savior amen and sometimes you have to wait now I I don't believe in taring I don't believe in none of that I I'm not preaching that way I'm preaching the truth when I come in this message I was a Baptist deacon at 23 years of age I was converted when I was 18 years old at 23 years of age I was already a bapti Deacon I was teaching adult Sunday School classes of the deacons and elders and their wives That's what I was doing when I quit left but when I come in this message I begin to read about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I read it from a set of eyes that was different than the old glces I used to read of thinking I had everything when I believe course I never did believe it that way I always argued with them I said why does the Bible say he that believeth cuz they didn't like me anyway told you about the time we s in the deacons meeting the old deacons in the Baptist Church this is no joke the Baptist Church of deacons believe that they have the full authority of the church and that if the preacher gets off with the Baptist Doctrine you are to walk up take his Bible away from him and dismiss the congregation and send him home and then you vote him out I was there I knowed all about it you know what I told him in a deacons meeting one day I said all I ever found in the Bible that the Deacon is supposed to do is wait on tables right right they didn't like it but it was the truth but you see there was something dealing with me back there that I can tell you experiences after experiences 11 years old seeing God standing in a church but you see I didn't have nobody to be able to get me to that God right I used to talk to them people about it and they just look at me right and the Baptist one of them fin one day he said you need to go to a Pentecostal Church you know because they believed in more of those things but you see when brother brand when I heard when brother Mo begin to explain the things about it he began to tell me about the dead being raised the sick being healed I said wait just a minute I said all right you saw it he said you know Robert Tatum I know brother Tatum all life M too he said he was there and saw all these things I said that's wonderful but I said that don't convince me at all right but I said you tell me what the man taught put what the man taught in the Bible and I'll know by that whether or not he was a prophet right he said boy I'm glad of that I'm glad I've run into a man that could quote 3/4 of the New Testament the old one together he began to show me the scriptures and tied together I told you about it where it back there that that I believe they would be two comings of Elijah before the end into the world cuz I could read Malachi 3 and Malachi 4 I said explain that he said brother R Malachi 3 John the Baptist Malachi 4 he went through a simple illustration it tied on I was in the word but you see two years I saw God reading six books as much as six books in one day and listen to two takes one going to work and one coming home believe in this prophet's message but you see there's still something wrong I had accepted God but he had not accepted me for two years I sought him crying and praying and one day it happened and a little old altar when the brother told me he said quit trying to find anything to be what it is I said you know I don't even know what I'm seeking for cuz I'm not seeking for nothing he said because God is a person when he said that there was the new birth right what'd you do brother Dale I fell over the floor naturally one way my wife received it the same identical time I did she fell the other way that was fine but you know what happened to me ENT I had a whole lot more desire to read I had a whole lot more desire to search after God and you know that's never ended if it ever ends that I don't have a desire in my heart to study God's word I pray every day every day day in and day out I pray God opened the word so I can preach to them people where they can see you amen where they can see you the way I see you let me explain it that way cuz he's real it's not just your thoughts the new birth is real it's the birth of the word so what are you going to do keep studying the word what do you do pray and read your Bible read the message of the hour someday God will jump off in pages right into your heart right amen and it'll be at time of what he wants to do right you won't make him force it it'll be on his time right but when it come don't you worry about it you'll know it right you'll know when it's come cuz that is the New Birth the birth of the word amen then disciples heard that word for three and a half years that's right and look what Peter had to say about it he said I was up on a mountain over there and I saw Jesus glorified you remember Matthew 17 but he gets over later in his later in his writings and what does he say he said I was on the mountain with Jesus he said but I have a more sure word that's right a prophecy amen that's right amen see he was just looking at things there but then he had Jesus in his heart right he said I have a more sure word of Prophecy greater than being on the mountain God in your heart we're going to have the communion let's just stand together we'll never want to have a service without giving an opportunity for prayer for salvation for anything you need of so let's just saying I love him anybody that has a need come forth and let's be prayed for because we always believe in that the main things we believe in Salvation amen seek God until speaks to you and don't you worry about it when you find him you're not going to quit seeking for him anymore you're going to want him so bad until you just want to live with him all the time and you realize he does live with you all the time but brother Dale I'm just not you I'm not a preacher I sought God for I was a preacher all them years I was seeking God I wasn't no preacher I still don't count myself one because I can't explain what I'm talking about but I believe God I believe he can speak to you if I keep talking long enough and he can bring it to your heart cuz I can't put it in your heart anyway brother randam can't put it in your heart the Lord Jesus said my own life did not reveal that unto thee takes the Holy Ghost to reveal the word amen I I love you I anybody else our sisters want a prayer clause for the grandchild you know he's like every kid doing great but he won't be quite out in the hallway all right that

Father our brother's asking for wisdom cuz he's got to go talk to somebody Lord and we ask you to just be with him Lord let him remember you in this let him speak Lord as you would have him to speak to the person to try to get him to straighten up and do what's right we thank you Father and just be with our brother let your comfort be there in Jesus name of we come to the communion time now we don't have a close communion our the communion is forever Born Again believer am that's the qualification of taking communion it's not whether or not you go to this church or whatever it is and it's just means for ever born again believer you know and so then you make up your mind as to whether or not you're born again and that would determine whether or not you're capable of receiving the communion because that's that's the way we believe it so let's just read our scriptures and if there's anything that anybody has any need of getting rid of anything or whatever uh just do it now during the time that we read the Bible and talk to God for yourself and uh you know so let's go to First Corinthians 11th chapter 23rd verse for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the new Testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do you in other words you show the Lord's death till he come that's the purpose of us take it he wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord see so you got to get rid of your own self and CLE you know repent but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup see examine yourself to see whether you're a Christian or not and then repent for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged now this scripture I love but when we are judged in other words we do wrong and we repent listen to what it says when we are judged we are chastened to the Lord that we should should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if any man in hunger let him eat at home and you come not together under condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come amen the Bible says that they had a time and they T so let's just bow our heads and just pray silently to the Lord and you know make sure everything's right in your own life and say Lord I'm sorry I repent I want to be worthy to be able to take these things just have your way now in Jesus name the Bible said he took bread and blessed it father we thank you for this bread it was made this day for this purpose not not to be just a meal or anything but to be made to be set aside to work that we could take the part that we call the communion so we thank you we ask you now that we know this is the bread is not the body it is only in representation of your body because we don't believe that it has anything to do within the power of being natural but it is all in the spiritual understanding that we're to eat the word of God until we become that word we ask you to sanctify this bread and to partake in the name of Jesus Christ amen see the Bread is made we don't believe like a lot of churches do a lot of churches just we used to when we was in the Baptist we' order our our bread and it didn't matter who made it where it come from it come from an order house we keep it for 3 months cuz we didn't took communion about every 3 months and and we'd keep it and and we'd just take it back home and and we just put it in the freezer you know and we'd freeze it up because you got a pretty good sizable bag of it and we just keep it and then we just have communion when we got ready we see then we found out the truth by coming into the message that that's not right so we The Bread is made that day and will be destroyed what is left over will be destroyed before the end or as early as we can to destroy it because it is like being it was like it was in the wilderness when they were eating the Mana that the Mana was fine but if they tried to keep it over it became stagnated so it wouldn't work and we don't try to hold over we're trying to say Lord give us our daily bread father we thank you for this wine as went through the process and now it's the hour where that it gets better each day we ask you to sanctify it because it t it is an example of thy blood that was shed for each one of us it is not your blood it is an example of that blood that was given now as we will partake of the bread and eat it and then we drink this little sip of wine tomorrow that will be actually blood cells in our body and making us able to live we thank you that you died that we might live now let us die to ourselves that you can live with each one of us in US Lord we ask you now to forgive our sins and just bless us together sanctify the wine and the partakers in Jesus name amen I know it was your blood I know it was
