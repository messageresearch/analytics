[12:55] having live in the building so what
[12:58] we're having a good speaking crowd that
[13:01] keeps increasing but that's one way of
[13:03] not having to build on your building
[13:05] and just let them stay our edition
[13:07] anybody wants to listen they can listen
[13:09] to you out there weeks a good evening
[13:11] and pray for us all right revelations we
[13:16] read revelation 1 on down through but I
[13:19] just want to jump the end tonight where
[13:21] we will pick up the part we're trying to
[13:23] bring and will drop down to verse 7 of
[13:27] Revelations 12 and there was war in
[13:32] heaven Michael and his angels fought
[13:34] against the Dragon and the dragon fought
[13:37] and his angels and prevailed not neither
[13:39] was their place found any more in heaven
[13:43] noticed neither was their other pets the
[13:46] Angels the the people had fallen there
[13:48] were no place left for in heaven right
[13:50] and the Great Dragon was cast out that
[13:53] old serpent called the devil and Satan
[13:55] which deceiveth the whole world he was
[13:58] cast out into the earth and his angels
[13:59] were cast out with him and I heard a
[14:02] loud voice saying in heaven now is come
[14:05] salvation and strength and the Kingdom
[14:08] of our God and I am the power of his
[14:11] Christ for the accuser of our brethren
[14:14] is cast down which accuses them before
[14:17] our God day and night and I told you
[14:20] when we get back to it that we will pick
[14:23] up a little further on this revelations
[14:26] 12 have you noticed it's not just one
[14:30] thing right Satan and was cast out back
[14:33] there all right and then you got all of
[14:36] this time and all of the taking place
[14:39] well then he's going to be cast out of
[14:42] heaven in the last days yep all right
[14:46] that's right no he's not going to be
[14:49] cast out of the territory right
[14:53] the place of heaven because he's done
[14:58] they cast out of it but are you going to
[15:01] be cashed out at heavenly places and you
[15:04] and I'm got a lot to do with that i
[15:05] matter so we got a lot to do when we get
[15:07] to it and try to come to that scripture
[15:10] okay so just hold on to that so that
[15:12] you'll know what I'm talking about okay
[15:14] John 3 and 18 just for one verse he that
[15:19] believeth on him is not condemned but he
[15:23] that believeth not is condemned already
[15:26] won why is he condemned already because
[15:28] he had not believed in the name of the
[15:32] only begotten Son of God you may be
[15:35] seated or that his blessing to the
[15:38] reading of the word now we've been
[15:42] talking for some time about heaven and
[15:46] how real it is and how real gaudiest and
[15:50] you know I hope that it's been a help to
[15:54] you to try to understand things I know
[15:58] we all say we believe in a heaven but
[16:01] we're finding out a few things maybe
[16:03] that is a very much of an interest it
[16:06] has been to me anyway to try to speak on
[16:10] it and now we were talking her Sunday
[16:14] that sin did not originate on earth that
[16:20] sin originated in heaven right on
[16:24] because that was the first thing was
[16:25] seeing the angels were created God
[16:28] created the angels and it could have
[16:31] been billions of years and he let him
[16:33] stay iron and they was having a
[16:34] wonderful time but as we'll see then
[16:37] Satan begin to get exalted in you know
[16:41] and that's worth seeing originated so
[16:44] then you know it's not looking at it
[16:46] then I hope it takes away the thought
[16:49] from our mind we say well what is sin
[16:54] people will say smoking drinking
[16:56] around women and then we say we'll
[17:00] program said that's not so that is
[17:04] unbelief well how do we understand that
[17:08] I'm hoping that it will help us to
[17:11] understand it those angels had no way of
[17:14] sinning as we looked at sin are used to
[17:18] believe seeing what we used to believe
[17:20] sin with what we done or didn't do right
[17:25] that was our thoughts because that's
[17:27] what we've been told all of her life all
[17:29] right but then the Prophet I noticed one
[17:31] time in looking at it today that he said
[17:35] that this is going to really caused a
[17:36] great stir you know anyone simply
[17:40] talking about that sin was not smoking
[17:44] and drinking and gambling and stuff like
[17:46] that and he said it would cause a great
[17:48] stir what for people and finally realize
[17:50] that that's not what it is will it see
[17:53] original in heaven and the angel sitting
[17:57] have any ability to drink smoke to run
[18:01] around whatever you want to call it you
[18:03] know then we ought to get that out of
[18:05] her mind and get down to the truth of it
[18:09] of what is sin seeing is to disbelieve
[18:14] God's Word now watch that as we go along
[18:17] tonight and I've got a lot of notes
[18:21] written and jump about so forgive me if
[18:24] I do but I want you to get a point from
[18:29] it that what is sin so whatever happened
[18:34] in the garden remember it was what
[18:39] happened in heaven
[18:42] the sin that was in the garden was the
[18:44] same sin that was in heaven right that's
[18:48] where we think we look at no no no no
[18:50] that was adultery Eve committed adultery
[18:52] that was the attribute or display of her
[18:57] unbelief number around said she doubted
[19:01] Hebrews 13 8 no limit I mean that's
[19:06] simple enough but now if you don't get
[19:10] nothing here's the point draw it across
[19:14] whatever was the sin in heaven would be
[19:17] the same in the garden all right right
[19:20] man now so then whatever would be the
[19:24] sin that was in heaven that would be the
[19:25] same in the garden will be the end times
[19:28] sin because this is alpha and omega that
[19:35] this is the beginning and the ending
[19:38] right all right so whatever it was in
[19:41] heaven is the same thing it is right
[19:43] here tonight and so it wasn't be that
[19:48] things that we do those are the
[19:51] attributes he said you smoke because you
[19:55] don't believe he says you drink because
[19:58] you don't believe he said you run around
[20:01] because you don't believe so that has
[20:06] nothing to do with sin you're not going
[20:11] a serious condemn the Prophet set on a
[20:14] higher level you didn't believe it's not
[20:18] as we said it's condemned already
[20:19] senators condemned on a higher level if
[20:22] not record kept of in life right God
[20:25] doesn't have to keep a record to bring
[20:27] into judgment now if necessary he wants
[20:30] to argue about it sure it'll be fine
[20:32] right but it won't be necessary but run
[20:35] said the center will turn his head and
[20:37] walk away and go to hell and never even
[20:40] look because he'll know
[20:45] that god is just so let's get it out of
[20:50] the way of trying to get these little
[20:52] things and let's get one more thing
[20:55] heavily out of the way you sold see mr.
[21:01] disbelief God now do you believe that
[21:06] those angels didn't believe now the
[21:10] Angels did they not believe that God was
[21:14] real no they knew it was rehabbing he
[21:21] created him right amen so there's no
[21:25] argument that they were not believing in
[21:29] God right all right now so when we come
[21:34] to the garden the prophet of God said if
[21:39] this eve believed ninety-nine percent
[21:43] maybe even he said none for domino's at
[21:46] ninety-nine percent of what God said she
[21:54] didn't say that wouldn't he got right
[21:58] there was no thought whatsoever involved
[22:01] that it wasn't the god now so that your
[22:07] mind leave then we we need to find out
[22:10] then what is the original sin and we'll
[22:15] see that that original sin will come all
[22:19] the way down through the Bible and come
[22:22] down to where we are here today now
[22:30] there cannot be a falling away unless
[22:37] there is a truth to fall from all right
[22:44] so now you see where I'm hated we're not
[22:47] talking about the denomination's when I
[22:50] talking about the center of the world
[22:52] the prostitutes the different things nah
[22:57] we're talking about sin we are the only
[23:03] people that can bring forth sin into the
[23:09] way that it would be the same as was in
[23:14] heaven you agree because it was a time
[23:20] that Martin Luther would would smoke a
[23:22] pipe and drag him here you know he said
[23:25] in a hug you know a liquor joint and
[23:28] talk about the Bible he was a child of
[23:31] God right god never condemn him but yet
[23:42] we come along and we fight will well
[23:45] sure we know what's in this but what
[23:52] happened in heaven that made Satan turn
[23:58] into be a sinner could not be interfaces
[24:04] and he wouldn't say there is no God race
[24:07] that it could not be attributes or
[24:12] displacement things or actions in his
[24:16] life that he was turning out to be a
[24:18] mean guy right no you want to see that
[24:23] after he gets here that's the attributes
[24:26] display once he reaches here alright but
[24:31] now if you don't get nothing else
[24:38] to disbelieve the revealed Word is sin
[24:51] then okay now let's make a 2011 you know
[24:59] version of that all the cooks old people
[25:04] believe that everybody else is in sin
[25:07] yep always have another person people
[25:13] believe everybody else is insane but
[25:16] then all the River Jordan G the Peru
[25:20] sears the the doctrines of the message
[25:26] they believe that everybody else is in
[25:30] sin and they can quote they went out
[25:34] from us cuz it was not Elvis cuz had
[25:39] they been of us they would have remained
[25:46] do you can see where we ended up this
[25:49] scratching the surface surface just a
[25:51] little Sunday and we want to take up
[25:55] right there and it will be on number six
[25:58] brother Joe on the notes and to be
[26:03] paragraph 62 the greatest battle ever
[26:07] fought and look like the prophet of God
[26:12] head and say you somebody a great battle
[26:19] this man great first now that was ever
[26:23] fought begin in heaven when Michael and
[26:26] his angels fought against Lucifer in his
[26:28] angels it first started the first battle
[26:33] was in heaven so sin did not originate
[26:35] on earth it originated in heaven now out
[26:39] of all of your theological understanding
[26:43] show me one of them the
[26:45] total debt they will break everything
[26:49] down here as they go to get going
[26:52] because they think it's impossible for
[26:54] sin to have originated in the portion
[26:58] that are the thing that we call heaven
[27:00] right so it did was thrown down from
[27:05] heaven cast out of heaven to the earth
[27:07] and fellow human the end of the battle
[27:09] for mangoes become human battles all
[27:12] right now so sin originated in heaven
[27:17] not on earth all right you said well we
[27:21] believe that all right now we'll pick up
[27:23] a little bit in a minute and watch these
[27:25] phrases as they begin to appear that the
[27:29] prophet of God said Satan wanted a
[27:34] denomination
[27:39] huh
[27:43] to Satan in his pride
[27:54] he wanted to build a more beautiful
[27:56] Kingdom yep but better class of people
[28:04] he was very jealous of Michael right
[28:14] hmm
[28:16] you might not even i would understand
[28:18] Michael because he knew he could have
[28:21] all the other angels but he couldn't
[28:25] handle Michael so now watch this as we
[28:30] go along to Satan cannot create you
[28:36] agree so he perverts what God has
[28:45] created okay what's that so just follow
[28:55] along with me number seven paragraph 2
[28:58] 25 the unveiling realities of the Living
[29:00] God 1960 remember SYM didn't begin on
[29:07] earth CN begin in heaven when Lucifer
[29:12] Lucifer taken and made him he said I
[29:15] wanted the nomination make a great big
[29:19] thing went on the north country and set
[29:23] up a bigger thing than Michael had and
[29:26] he was kicked out of heaven now the
[29:29] northern side of heaven was known as the
[29:31] worship team and Satan is the worship
[29:35] angel that's why he loves worship he
[29:40] loves to go to church he loves worship
[29:45] because he's the number one guy of
[29:48] worship that was his job that was his
[29:54] part yeah but he wanted a development a
[29:59] denomination right
[30:05] he wanted something bigger than model
[30:14] now
[30:17] why would he be like that the first off
[30:22] he was not created Lucifer he was
[30:26] created the anointed turabath and he
[30:30] stood beside the Lord we could the
[30:32] minute he stood by his right hand mmm he
[30:37] was not created wrong God cannot create
[30:40] anything wrong so now watch the very
[30:48] simplicity of it and then what as we try
[30:53] to bring it down into the message people
[30:58] because whatever start is not an end now
[31:06] so what would me it was or what did take
[31:10] place now we gave you number 8 paragraph
[31:16] 33 34 of why 1960 03 09 that the prophet
[31:23] of God tells you that there's only one
[31:27] Sam that's unbelief now it's not
[31:31] drinking ailment smoke in C read down
[31:33] through sin is not smoking cigarettes no
[31:37] different things you can read it but
[31:40] watch what he says there's only one sin
[31:44] that's unbelief any man if Helios as
[31:49] Holy and past and as good as he could be
[31:52] and yet say that the days of miracles is
[31:56] past and then I the Scriptures saying
[32:00] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[32:02] and forever that man is a sinner because
[32:06] he's an unbeliever now no matter how
[32:13] good
[32:14] a pasar wonderful a person see then so
[32:23] you can see the end that when run around
[32:24] when we get to in a minute work with
[32:26] quote that Eve distally one thing in
[32:29] that was even was 30 nights you can see
[32:31] what he's bringing it to now you go out
[32:36] today anywhere you want to go and you
[32:39] ask anybody denominational people this
[32:42] message people order are you an
[32:44] unbeliever of course not no we're
[32:50] believers I believe everything right
[32:55] around saying
[33:03] then our lives if they don't match to
[33:08] that point of what we're saying what is
[33:11] it I believe everything he says but now
[33:17] and they certain things that I don't
[33:19] want to fool with there are certain
[33:26] things are that we we leave alone
[33:28] because we don't know we're afraid to
[33:34] venture into those things you know what
[33:40] that makes is an unbeliever right an
[33:46] unbeliever I'm not afraid of anything
[33:50] that God told in the Bible that and they
[33:54] brought to us by the prophet of God why
[33:56] would I be afraid of evening our vini
[33:58] buddy coming to me talking to him amen
[34:01] that's right I don't quite know all the
[34:04] answers but you know my statement is it
[34:06] I wouldn't find somebody that does
[34:09] happen so we don't worry about it so
[34:16] what happened I'm trying to pick up the
[34:19] one work and get down to it but we will
[34:22] read it in a minute the brother said
[34:24] Satan cannot create so when he saw
[34:29] Michael be able to create the world than
[34:35] the things
[34:40] he got upset because he thought it was
[34:45] supposed to come through him right
[34:50] mmm
[34:53] you got all tied up in he begin to
[34:59] reason why was not joke
[35:10] why wasn't I the one that could create
[35:17] but he ought to know that there was no
[35:22] angel ever given the ability to create
[35:29] right he can't be done only God can
[35:34] create right so then his problem was not
[35:39] doubting that now let's be Trinitarian
[35:42] for me huh here's God sitting on a
[35:46] throne he goes up every day of worship
[35:48] singing praises in 24 hours seven days a
[35:52] week on this going on ain't no time so
[35:57] that's not his problem his problem
[36:01] didn't come we'll call it with the the
[36:05] head man his problem came was the one
[36:11] that he couldn't understand which was
[36:17] michael brun rinses Michaels crotch so
[36:23] Michael be in Christ was the low-cost
[36:25] the ethnic center etc all of those big
[36:28] words we talked about using the word of
[36:32] God so he wasn't trying to in the way to
[36:40] at that point to be able to conquer God
[36:48] he just didn't like this time am i right
[36:51] yep give it are you thinking
[36:59] he's saying if I'm the right hand man
[37:04] who's this guy see so he's doubting who
[37:11] it is are you listening right Sophie's
[37:18] daddy who it is worse yet he's an
[37:21] unbelief ms like I've always told you if
[37:28] you don't have enough holy ghost inside
[37:29] of you to be able to figure out whether
[37:32] or not brother Dale stretching the truth
[37:34] you better start seeking the Holy though
[37:40] simple man yeah it's okay now road at
[37:45] least don't break yourself into it
[37:46] tonight
[37:53] but you see what started out as a
[37:55] smallest thing which would be just not
[38:03] wanting to understand who this would
[38:09] come on jealousy i push you to the place
[38:12] that you don't want to understand pride
[38:18] will put you into a place that the Bible
[38:20] says pride goes before following so
[38:27] Lucifer he couldn't understand who
[38:35] Michael would and he didn't want to
[38:40] understand he wanted to some way be able
[38:48] to remove him from the office he was in
[38:56] are you listening don't you will make it
[38:59] as simple as we can you might not agree
[39:03] with it that's all right what is sin
[39:08] we've taken out is all of these big
[39:11] things and everybody thanks it if those
[39:12] are attributes of unbeliever you still
[39:14] believe if you go get em son Jesus I saw
[39:16] was that no problem
[39:24] but Satan the said he couldn't
[39:29] understand it I'm the right-hand man but
[39:40] yet there's someone closer to God than I
[39:45] am the only way I can get to my place
[39:52] that I want is to try to remove him now
[40:02] saying cannot create but he could
[40:05] pervert what God creates so there in the
[40:12] beginning as the angels were worshiping
[40:16] God and all of this is unfolding could
[40:21] you not see that heaven was full of the
[40:24] attributes of God love joy peace
[40:32] goodness meekness right
[40:39] whenever would not that being what God
[40:42] could create a ring into means he is
[40:44] framed in the beans what create means
[40:49] same so he couldn't do that so we
[40:55] started perverting it
[41:02] he started to bring himself up into a
[41:06] room that he wanted to take over now if
[41:19] he wanted to take over what do you want
[41:21] to take over what he thought was his
[41:26] rightful position to stand with the Lord
[41:34] it was a dirty vulgar things that you
[41:38] see none of this was in heaven angels
[41:42] can't do those things so Satan would
[41:49] have to take love and perverted to make
[41:54] something vulgar to appear
[42:05] now did he want to do away as I said did
[42:08] he want to do away with God no he just
[42:16] wants to be worshipped his daughter he
[42:26] thinks that if he gets enough people on
[42:29] his side that he can defeat God now
[42:40] they're not a bad dummy it's our to call
[42:43] him at the thing that God created him
[42:48] and he thinks he can in one way someday
[42:50] he'd be able to take over because that's
[42:57] what it starts out in Genesis cuz he
[43:00] tells the eve says you'll be half God
[43:04] knowing good and evil jumps on over in
[43:08] the Isaiah any talks about you know like
[43:15] in the place over or whatever you want
[43:16] to call it their knives they're 14 but
[43:19] then he gets over in 2 Thessalonians it
[43:24] shows himself to be answered on them so
[43:30] there is this trick gives many angels as
[43:35] you could get to believe his life deal i
[43:39] remember the prophet said the same one
[43:42] he's always told what is the lie that
[43:46] Satan has always told it is not going
[43:51] that way so far do you can't see it it
[43:54] is so close to the truth the only a holy
[43:58] ghost filled person can divide between
[44:02] whether it's a lie of Satan or the truth
[44:08] that's why that no man is a match the
[44:12] Bible says for Satan
[44:15] but Christ is so we don't have to worry
[44:19] about it he can take care of it but look
[44:24] as we go along going down that brother
[44:26] joked about number 10 which is the 21
[44:31] mark of the beast and the seal of God
[44:34] 1961 look what happens we find that he
[44:42] was the first murderer he was the first
[44:45] one to how jealousy and you think it's
[44:51] dead murdered and that he is that's fine
[44:53] you bring it down you down here you one
[44:55] down with it that's all right look what
[44:56] he said and Lucifer got jealous of
[44:59] Michael wrote it right down to earth and
[45:02] transferred it into man Lucifer got
[45:09] jealous of Michael now I gave an
[45:18] illustration the other day to you maybe
[45:22] you didn't believe but I'd like your
[45:24] definition that how could all of this
[45:30] have happened in heaven and God not know
[45:35] doll about what was going right
[45:42] I mean he's God is omniscient omniscient
[45:45] omnipotent eat right how is it that this
[45:50] could have took place I gave you my
[45:55] definition do what you want to bless
[45:58] your earth you realize my Michael
[46:03] stepped over to create Michael became
[46:08] the Christ the protector of st. let you
[46:19] think you tell me how it would
[46:27] so there's some way the great eternal
[46:30] God in his form of Ella himself existing
[46:33] know he has the ability to turn away
[46:38] from seeing sin but he's always got to
[46:45] be something standing that or someone is
[46:51] a better way of saving so we know that
[46:54] in the garden when it came down that in
[47:00] the garden having each sin and God came
[47:08] down and said Adam where art thou and
[47:15] Adam over in the bushes with his church
[47:18] then he was going on brother Brown
[47:19] cities do little denomination he's
[47:21] making notice his words he said they was
[47:24] in the garden had in church with in fig
[47:29] leaves I kept God from destroying Adam
[47:34] and Eve ma'am sealing the presence of
[47:40] God one second is annihilation what kept
[47:45] me from happening in heaven what kept me
[47:50] from happening in the garden so you
[47:52] don't say will it bring them you don't
[47:53] know how long and what I don't care how
[47:55] long it was in the garden if it was two
[47:57] seconds from the time out of and he see
[48:01] him that God stepped on the scene still
[48:04] he would have had to kill them
[48:10] would you see in order to have
[48:14] substitute now the animal had been slain
[48:20] God slew the animal bactrim a Venetian
[48:24] and gave them to Adam and Eve the skins
[48:26] to put on right that's easier to see
[48:29] Toma Toma but what kept you from being
[48:33] destroyed now go there you've got me
[48:40] confused thank God maybe you can do
[48:43] something about it maybe you're praying
[48:48] that's God to reveal it to you because
[48:52] you know you can't argue with what I'm
[48:54] saying so in the garden we've got
[48:59] scripture to go back to the Jesus Christ
[49:02] according to Revelation 13 8 the jesus
[49:05] christ dude is a lamb slain before the
[49:07] foundation of the world God was not
[49:10] looking at what they were doing in the
[49:12] garden right he was looking at the
[49:18] sacrifice that he had already made but
[49:23] you better recover that away on back
[49:25] because you've gotta cover Satan that's
[49:28] what I say about the poor old boy and
[49:31] about me to you
[49:36] then we could be have the audacity to
[49:39] stand in this last days in the presence
[49:44] of the revealed Word and still want to
[49:49] carry our own ideas and thongs yep
[49:59] he said how you making it to claim 1 you
[50:05] know I'm still glad for that at home
[50:07] never I'm still glad they was an
[50:11] atonement made before the world happen
[50:13] it could take care of me and you have it
[50:16] right and that does it now yeah but are
[50:23] you listening should we talk about that
[50:27] he got jealous number 11 e 17 see you of
[50:33] the Antichrist 55 3 over 1 or 3 11 he
[50:39] said was pity look what he says about
[50:42] the guard you talking about the
[50:46] Antichrist and now the closeness that it
[50:48] works together did you know that it asks
[50:52] heaven that the devil was not driving
[50:54] him man in the beginning that Lucifer
[50:57] the son of the morning with given power
[50:59] and the reason that he brought sin into
[51:03] the world listen he was able to take
[51:08] something they telling you the city bro
[51:11] he was able to take something that got
[51:14] it created and pervert it back into an
[51:18] evil thing who started all of this
[51:22] trouble in the beginning then gone back
[51:25] before the foundation the world they
[51:27] were laid when he seen what safe had
[51:29] done in his pride pride
[51:37] maybe pride goes before follow he said
[51:42] brother Dale you're talking about me if
[51:45] you think I'm talking about you then you
[51:48] know you're in see what's on that Prop a
[51:52] friend who won't Batman too late too
[51:57] late to back down on anything if you
[52:00] think I'm talking about you you're
[52:01] exactly what I'm talking about whether
[52:05] it be my children my life my grandkid or
[52:08] anybody else it in here see because
[52:15] Lucifer being God's right hand man he
[52:22] just couldn't understand how anybody
[52:25] else could be how many use his pride in
[52:33] himself for what the job he thought he
[52:36] was chosen to do and it was chosen for a
[52:41] wonderful job he was given gifts and all
[52:47] sigh all kind of things regrets that he
[52:51] has that supernatural gifts all the time
[52:53] you arguing him about it I only thought
[52:56] God could give out yet so that's the way
[52:58] I used to think it through a prophet
[52:59] said so now I say Satan could pass up
[53:03] supernatural gifts will grow there like
[53:05] that gives that me I'd say look what
[53:08] happened in my life i've done this i
[53:10] seen that i've been here i've done that
[53:12] i preached i'll cast out devils i raised
[53:15] the day pride
[53:20] pride
[53:27] Satan in his pride
[53:33] he became very jealous number 12 her
[53:38] drive 190 questions of entry he broods
[53:43] 157 929 the right-hand man of Almighty
[53:50] God with Lucifer son of the morning the
[53:53] first God granted him almost co-workers
[53:56] with him he was a co-worker partly equal
[54:02] with him only Satan cannot create god is
[54:09] he only create order but Satan took
[54:11] something that God created it perverted
[54:13] back into something else evil and I
[54:16] noticed when Cain and Abel a beautiful
[54:18] picture he was this prefiguring Judas
[54:21] and Jesus it was coming home
[54:30] coworker yep I hope you get the picture
[54:38] how would you like to me vice president

[56:02] good times will come I'm not today
[56:04] becoming to be hard to quit a job today
[56:06] goes of the economy but you know what
[56:10] would happen in ninety percent of the
[56:11] cases my kid the vice president would
[56:14] quit if he found out he had no charge
[56:17] whatsoever to do and couldn't handle
[56:20] things like he thought he spoke to him
[56:22] like he said well they don't need me Ben

[57:06] all right I may be President but i
[57:11] shorten depend on device and all the
[57:13] others down underneath okay listen now
[57:17] I've got just got the bait seen up to
[57:19] this that Lucifer in heaven tried 2x all
[57:22] this thick and even be a little bit
[57:25] higher than his boss okay and he
[57:30] betrayed Michael and made himself a
[57:31] great Kingdom in the north come down now
[57:35] he and his angels were cast out and as
[57:38] he said the person has to the thing you
[57:40] know he sets the kingdom going down he
[57:44] talks about how how Satan control
[57:46] whatever nation there is in the world
[57:48] United States ever kingdom everything is
[57:51] controlled by saying a man to his
[57:54] British morning but yet he didn't like
[57:58] his balls right now like the way Brett
[58:03] around brains it see he didn't like
[58:06] Michael
[58:14] you're reading it brother Brad said that
[58:16] Jesus never argued with Satan when he
[58:19] offered him ever kingdom of the world
[58:21] now I don't to ring back about one-half
[58:24] of a message to go that when Satan would
[58:31] finally the world had already been
[58:33] created but it was in darkness and chaos
[58:35] we haven't got to the world yet it was
[58:39] in darkness and chaos and Satan was cast
[58:41] out and this is his domain that belongs
[58:48] to him don't worry about it things will
[58:52] be made right we lift an excellent
[58:56] number 15 let your light shine before me
[59:03] in 60 1903 you wanted a better class of
[59:07] people got kicked out of heaven because
[59:14] you wanted a better class of people now
[59:17] what's wrong with a better class of
[59:18] people
[59:22] right what's wrong with a better class
[59:25] of people what happened back there at
[59:31] the times when Constantine at them and
[59:35] all the things was happening what
[59:36] happened that the Prophet said he said
[59:40] they began to say now listen they will
[59:42] slow down here and won't we won't this
[59:44] worship God so much and with this kind
[59:46] of control things you know we dress a
[59:49] little different we can better get a
[59:50] better class of people do we get to
[59:53] mayor you know we get many people they
[1:00:04] never all big people if they're born
[1:00:06] again no problems with doctors lawyers
[1:00:10] or are they are if they're born again I
[1:00:15] guess this one's always just been a
[1:00:17] problem around here we sit here in an
[1:00:21] old building that is comfortable enough
[1:00:23] for us and God will it's enough from all
[1:00:25] we need but we could have had a build it
[1:00:32] causes me constant millions of dollars
[1:00:36] had I taken the money and put it to that
[1:00:40] use instead of giving it to to you and
[1:00:43] giving it to the missionaries
[1:00:50] he
[1:00:53] sure looks like we don't want no better
[1:00:55] class now i'm not against a better class
[1:00:57] i hope you understand I mean it's um dr.
[1:01:01] Lal you're here is he under be better
[1:01:03] understand what I'm dumb bout I want to
[1:01:04] hold the goats feel longer we need them
[1:01:07] I want a holy ghost filled doctor I mean
[1:01:09] I just don't want nobody whether he's an
[1:01:13] idiot or an educated idiot to come in to
[1:01:16] try to tell us a better way to serve God
[1:01:20] it's just that way I'm sorry maybe I'm
[1:01:23] arrogant and hateful but I'm the boss
[1:01:29] man so we either do it this away or you
[1:01:32] go some out and i'm not against
[1:01:35] anybody so well no problems but look he
[1:01:41] wanted a better class of people you
[1:01:42] wanted to exalt himself go down to the
[1:01:45] neck which is Christ the mystery of God
[1:01:46] reveal paragraph I guess 543 said he
[1:01:53] wanted to separate fellowship yeah
[1:01:59] Lucifer and the last days is doing as he
[1:02:02] did at first hey why did listen renew
[1:02:08] the first thing that loose were done to
[1:02:10] separate the fellowship oh god man he
[1:02:13] wanted to build him a united kingdom a
[1:02:15] greater splendor and seemingly more
[1:02:17] cultured a greater kingdom and Michael
[1:02:19] Christ head hmm Lucifer at the beginning
[1:02:23] his purpose in heart was to achieve a
[1:02:25] brighter and greater thing in heaven
[1:02:28] then cross that is that right by
[1:02:31] seemingly a more cultured more beautiful
[1:02:34] more slender new kingdom of Christ I
[1:02:39] like the rest of you think with our Lord
[1:02:41] will be able two things at the
[1:02:42] Millennium another haul it away it's not
[1:02:45] any part of this but you want to
[1:02:47] separate fellowship call right back up
[1:02:51] there in the realms of heaven and what
[1:02:57] Satan be ended it
[1:03:01] separate a fellowship yeah Kate oh
[1:03:09] with everybody that's one thing you
[1:03:14] can't say about this man are you oh you
[1:03:17] won't do it I'll shake your hand never
[1:03:21] service unless you run off and I have to
[1:03:26] pull away from people that want to talk
[1:03:28] to me because they'll come by and want
[1:03:31] to talk about the word and I have to put
[1:03:33] away you know why because i'm not going
[1:03:37] to separate fellowship will talk about
[1:03:39] the word you call me we talk about any
[1:03:41] time but i'm going to fellowship with
[1:03:43] the people but how many of you is
[1:03:47] shaking hands with people in this
[1:03:49] building
[1:03:57] little group little things pulling
[1:04:00] separating fellowship just little things
[1:04:06] you say would that see him well I
[1:04:09] thought that's what we were reading the
[1:04:12] prostate was talking about that I'm not
[1:04:15] the theologian yeah we brother they live
[1:04:23] I won't talk with me why I'm first sure

[1:04:35] a certainty that they don't have that
[1:04:36] against you trying to get you the life
[1:04:39] get you away from the Sun business you
[1:04:43] know what I'm saying right the Bible
[1:04:46] says and I remember winning sister
[1:04:49] Margaret died in order to open that
[1:04:50] scripture to me it says to have friends
[1:04:55] you must be friendly
[1:05:04] money for everybody right well then you
[1:05:10] got to be friendly how many somebody
[1:05:17] come by shaking him look at you move on
[1:05:19] i'm cathy from the hail storm or
[1:05:21] something you man is on the
[1:05:25] fellowship with that don't tell me you

[1:06:01] that every tenth week come on
[1:06:09] what did you dine people no separate to
[1:06:17] fellowship now let me cover something
[1:06:23] while I'm thinking man don't you think
[1:06:27] that God dwells in beauty that's right
[1:06:33] you see here is where the difference is
[1:06:37] beauties of God can be a rolling he'll
[1:06:41] of grace that he could sit down in and
[1:06:43] look all around him and be happy God's
[1:06:52] in beauty right why does it emphasized
[1:06:56] then that Satan you don't a checkup is
[1:07:00] in BP yep my brother tell me guys both
[1:07:04] were no range eggs both were no watches
[1:07:06] cause the Bible said Satan is in the
[1:07:09] stones I said I agree with you I don't
[1:07:13] my wife for him by the church looking
[1:07:15] like a dime store I don't think it's

[1:07:50] snake around my neck and having that
[1:07:52] time around I agree we cut a lot of it
[1:07:56] let's hide restrict what you see we get
[1:08:03] into some little something and ask that
[1:08:06] brother s my brother would you answer me
[1:08:08] one question who say Satan is in Beauty
[1:08:12] and all of the stones i said would you
[1:08:15] mind describing that future home over
[1:08:19] the book of Revelation I said it
[1:08:24] described all those beautiful diamonds
[1:08:26] in Rose sapphire I only know what L
[1:08:31] harbor royalty they were like I don't
[1:08:33] know nothing about it go into a stored
[1:08:36] so i could sell me a chuckle wouldn't
[1:08:38] say that I'm i take it on a Watson look
[1:08:40] at the diamond I vote for you cuz I
[1:08:42] don't know nothing about
[1:08:47] you see is what we think God is in
[1:08:55] beauty God loves a beautiful place he
[1:09:04] came down when they improved it when
[1:09:05] they got one ready for my man you think
[1:09:09] about all the stuff that was in the
[1:09:10] night and how a lot of that stuff was
[1:09:13] overlaid with cold all of those diamonds
[1:09:17] and pearls and rubies and things he
[1:09:23] cannot down the so what does it
[1:09:26] mean that Satan wants to be beauty when
[1:09:32] we realized God is beauty what you see
[1:09:36] Satan can't sit down and just be happy
[1:09:40] is the prophet of God would say what you
[1:09:43] ask people say what do you want in
[1:09:45] heaven I want this beautiful I hit

[1:09:52] said just build me a little cabin that
[1:09:55] in the corner of glory lane team in what
[1:10:01] he said didn't he proved it cuz he could
[1:10:04] have been a millionaire easily he
[1:10:08] rejected it spin it for the people
[1:10:12] proven what he was but you see those
[1:10:17] people are not taught anymore oath
[1:10:19] because you think the government thought
[1:10:21] anymore over man that was that honest no
[1:10:25] they don't ever trick in the book to try
[1:10:29] to hang him with three hundred and seven
[1:10:31] thousand dollars of debt that he had
[1:10:35] nothing to do with he would just sign
[1:10:37] his name and he didn't know never put
[1:10:40] in a bank they said when you sign it it
[1:10:43] was yours he wound up having to pay
[1:10:45] accountant taxes and and all kind of
[1:10:48] things all his 40-some thousand dollars
[1:10:51] man is making 100 hours a week she see
[1:10:59] Satan wants everything beautiful
[1:11:07] look around this message the brothers
[1:11:13] had came out when I came out and look at
[1:11:19] your church using their time never
[1:11:22] brother day I don't know they gotta have
[1:11:24] four or five hundred seats and I made me
[1:11:32] no problem to the show building being
[1:11:36] old church and put a pageant seasoning
[1:11:40] and it wouldn't be a big old mansion of
[1:11:42] the time but no then we're gonna do that
[1:11:44] now that's their business I'm just
[1:11:46] telling you Gobert on my season you said
[1:11:49] to see him to do that you want to go
[1:11:55] further you think it's a sin it takes
[1:11:59] God's money I do whether you do it hon
[1:12:04] where these creatures doing up I think
[1:12:07] it's a sin for me to sit in a big old
[1:12:09] fancy of Hajj and my people living in
[1:12:13] shacks and me murdered them to death for
[1:12:15] their money
[1:12:23] want to live the double-wide trailer but
[1:12:27] you want to come see it no one like one

[1:12:31] conversion and doesn't look like it and
[1:12:33] I'm happy I have a habit yet you say

[1:13:12] well around was a nice guy he is I like
[1:13:16] this one
[1:13:23] let's just read the first battle that
[1:13:25] was ever fought was not fall to earth on
[1:13:28] the earth it was fought in heaven
[1:13:29] Michael Michael and his angels against
[1:13:32] Lucifer and they were kicked out of
[1:13:34] heaven and that great army of the devil
[1:13:36] and all his what is it young he may got
[1:13:46] a definition of an amp but that's what
[1:13:54] we said they were never glad you make a
[1:13:58] mad you follow me up when I'm not make
[1:14:02] the mad you tell me what if he isn't any
[1:14:03] human wouldn't be making a mad you
[1:14:11] understand what I'm getting that
[1:14:15] what is seen what is seeing run around
[1:14:28] to turn your back on the truth and these
[1:14:33] will be put up on the screen macys
[1:14:39] divine Haven 54 620 in the church what
[1:14:45] is seeing I believe he that will turn
[1:14:47] his back on truth when it's presented to
[1:14:51] him now listen there remaineth no more
[1:14:55] sacrifice for sin
[1:15:04] now muchly personal
[1:15:10] run today we just don't know where to
[1:15:12] believe we wait wait wait wait we
[1:15:14] believe what you read to us do we don't
[1:15:21] know whether you're right
[1:15:29] ok
[1:15:33] what does the word say it's all I've
[1:15:35] ever asked anybody anybody ever leaves
[1:15:38] you're asking one question we're off the
[1:15:41] word well I would stay tell you but your
[1:15:45] throat out hey we wouldn't believe it
[1:15:48] anyway you probably run but you could
[1:15:55] give me a challenge
[1:16:00] did you ever read it he they disbelieves
[1:16:04] willfully after Cruz has been presented
[1:16:08] to him because his church believes
[1:16:11] different that's when you crossed the
[1:16:16] line he that sims willfully after he has
[1:16:21] received the knowledge of the truth I
[1:16:23] remaineth no more sacrifice brother I
[1:16:28] just can't understand you some messages
[1:16:31] are okay but you just Saudi your soul is
[1:16:37] it what brother branham say
[1:16:50] now I don't like the cool blood random
[1:16:52] with everything you know what when I get
[1:16:59] back yeah yeah now you were no better
[1:17:02] than that you know the reason I don't
[1:17:06] like to call it everything he says
[1:17:14] because if you call it everything he
[1:17:16] says you're in trouble
[1:17:24] and I don't do it a lot of times to you
[1:17:28] like I say about with Nash people that
[1:17:31] left here show me where them off the
[1:17:33] word I don't like them at this quote
[1:17:39] rather adam says you are wrong if you
[1:17:42] leave a church unless they're off the
[1:17:49] word this is you're wrong nice antigen
[1:17:58] wife 19 Nancy naked yeah
[1:18:07] if the truth comes to you in such a way
[1:18:10] that you have a knowledge of it and then
[1:18:16] refuse to receive it now remains no more
[1:18:21] sacrifice for sin
[1:18:27] you remember the Lord Jesus the random
[1:18:30] said one of the school script the
[1:18:32] scripture said he said if I hadn't come
[1:18:36] and spoke to you now paraphrasing the
[1:18:39] scripture Sofia my watch he said if I
[1:18:42] hadn't come and spoke to prove to you he
[1:18:45] said you had a covering that's creepy
[1:18:50] national brilliantly her go start
[1:18:53] fooling anyone would you find it she
[1:18:54] come home what you see
[1:19:03] that makes its in to the little woman
[1:19:09] caught in adultery he said go and sin no
[1:19:11] more or less a work shirt fine come upon
[1:19:14] you but a random in saying it in a
[1:19:17] message he said I listen to it he said
[1:19:22] for you to stand here tonight and see
[1:19:26] God come down and heal the sick and
[1:19:30] deliver the people and all of the things
[1:19:33] and he said for you to walk away there
[1:19:36] is no more sacrifice for you you will
[1:19:41] get he said for you to see the word in
[1:19:53] action and you to walk away he said
[1:19:56] there's no more sacrifice
[1:20:03] hmm
[1:20:05] sin is initial form is to reject the
[1:20:11] revealed Word of God our will of God
[1:20:18] when God has revealed something as he
[1:20:22] will and to reject that is to bless
[1:20:25] thing or to reject God for a serious
[1:20:36] very serious blessed God I don't have to
[1:20:41] listen to you I'm greedy but you're
[1:20:46] guilty of what you've heard yep what do
[1:20:52] you can do that what you heard I just go
[1:20:56] somewhere that let me quote you and some
[1:21:01] of these its layout let me quote them
[1:21:03] brother dale has nowhere else to go
[1:21:15] you say you're going awful brother so it
[1:21:17] soaks onto itself no sir cut it all out
[1:21:21] of her body right and I want everybody
[1:21:24] saved because I've been preached to you
[1:21:28] the message because there is no
[1:21:32] sacrifice for Seattle only the life of
[1:21:41] Jesus Christ coming in you there is no
[1:21:44] animal number is no good deeds no
[1:21:47] thoughts whatever only Jesus Christ
[1:21:49] coming and living in you is a sacrifice
[1:21:52] for sin right that's why I said he
[1:22:01] descends will flash receiving the
[1:22:02] knowledge of the truth but arrested you
[1:22:04] will even willfully sin but arouse said
[1:22:08] only Christians have sins now where
[1:22:14] we're going to do with that
[1:22:21] but against a holy ghost feel Christian
[1:22:23] no he did when I believe brother Ram was
[1:22:28] a holy ghost filled Christian run around
[1:22:31] to you soon he said every day now what's
[1:22:34] he talking about we've annihilated the
[1:22:38] situation or should from the fact that
[1:22:40] we're looking at a man like rudder
[1:22:42] random that didn't go out and get caught
[1:22:44] up into the world adult reason all of
[1:22:47] these things a man who said he live so
[1:22:51] close to God and do it forced to gift
[1:22:53] even work I don't claim to be that way I
[1:23:00] never hang out but I claim a lot of
[1:23:08] repentance okay cuz see I've been
[1:23:13] preached to you know the message man he
[1:23:15] did send will actually receive the
[1:23:17] knowledge is true there remains no more
[1:23:18] sacrifice there's not any more sacrifice
[1:23:20] for that you got a repeat of Christian a
[1:23:23] Christian a born-again Christian if they
[1:23:26] don't repent their sins who have to give
[1:23:28] it a council work not at the white
[1:23:30] throne judgment no but a judgment of the
[1:23:33] deed done in the body whether good or
[1:23:35] bad we have will be judged accordingly
[1:23:37] not to society eternal life I've been
[1:23:40] preached on that tree but to turn that
[1:23:44] in the word seeing as an initial form is
[1:23:50] to reject the revealed Word of God
[1:23:56] saying anything this enticement to leave
[1:24:00] that God said that but he didn't mean it
[1:24:07] see he wat worst the word breezy the one
[1:24:16] watch the word you come in my office and
[1:24:21] sit down and you talk to me and you tell
[1:24:25] me your problems and think I'll make it
[1:24:26] your honest to judgment as I can but
[1:24:29] I've never told anybody that you all
[1:24:32] right
[1:24:34] not there you go within what's done I'm
[1:24:40] taking all right i'll take you go repent
[1:24:45] well because you retain that's the
[1:24:48] covering for right that's the
[1:24:53] company what is seen in unbelief no
[1:24:59] matter how polished you are if you try
[1:25:02] to put place the days of miracles in the
[1:25:05] pious and there's no such a thing and
[1:25:09] explain it away there's only one word
[1:25:12] for you brother you're an unbeliever
[1:25:18] original sin is only what's the original
[1:25:23] scene in the end time people we don't
[1:25:27] know who believe that was what they were
[1:25:31] say it when I came in this message he
[1:25:35] says we don't know who believe
[1:25:40] I said what I thought you supposed to
[1:25:41] believe the prophet yeah well we got hot
[1:25:44] Sun I can follow we don't know who to
[1:25:46] follow I said I thought wish to follow
[1:25:50] the prophets message you don't have to
[1:25:57] change sits in
[1:26:04] what is sin Santa John belief unbelief
[1:26:08] in what the word I'm belief in God which
[1:26:15] is the word
[1:26:25] see a man how care who he is a dumb
[1:26:27] donkey tell you the truth you better
[1:26:32] believe there is no justification in the
[1:26:39] line of thinking what I don't have to do
[1:26:42] this or have to do that because you're a
[1:26:44] man and I'm a man that's what brought
[1:26:45] around said he said it's hard to get one
[1:26:48] man to believe another I'll come here to
[1:26:55] you many many times and told you that
[1:26:57] God reveals something to me and I invite
[1:27:05] you to come and tell me if it's wrong
[1:27:07] how many pastors would do that
[1:27:15] I invite you to come and show me where
[1:27:17] Trump no one cuz I'm will be right the
[1:27:24] original sin in heaven with when Satan
[1:27:28] got to the point that he believed he was
[1:27:33] a greater more powerful force more
[1:27:36] beautiful and all things greater than
[1:27:41] Michael
[1:27:46] he was cashed out
[1:27:51] in the end time I'll preach on this
[1:27:53] later when they get back in the end time
[1:27:58] according to what we've been reading the
[1:28:00] revelations 12 Michael and Lucifer will
[1:28:03] meet again in the Battle of Armageddon
[1:28:14] they'll be idiot then that ties together
[1:28:18] the Jews because that is Armageddon will
[1:28:21] be where the Jews are in but when Brett
[1:28:25] around got on the fourth seal I'd invite
[1:28:27] you to go read the message he preached
[1:28:29] the Battle of Armageddon and he never
[1:28:32] fired a shot he never said Russia was
[1:28:35] coming down China was coming down this
[1:28:37] was coming down that was coming down no
[1:28:40] fighting go read it show me
[1:28:49] he said it's Protestants and Catholics
[1:28:55] meeting again
[1:29:01] and listen
[1:29:04] if you and I can't win this battle over
[1:29:07] sin find out what it is and win the
[1:29:12] battle you might worry about whether
[1:29:17] there's an Armageddon to the Jews or not
[1:29:21] but you know I've done read the book I
[1:29:25] didn't know the story somebody is going
[1:29:31] to take God's Word and believe it in the
[1:29:36] face of all doubts and skepticism the
[1:29:38] hints hints preachers around the message
[1:29:50] somebody's going to stand on the word
[1:29:52] and walk off the earth I tried and it
[1:29:58] won't be beautiful but to God you'd be
[1:30:03] the most beautiful thing that could ever
[1:30:04] be you know what's real God more than
[1:30:08] anything you know what Brett around said
[1:30:12] one day he said if I was God and they
[1:30:16] wouldn't take my word he said I'd tell
[1:30:20] him to forget it but said he's not that
[1:30:25] away said he keeps coming down to help
[1:30:29] us
[1:30:31] and Michael is still refining for us
[1:30:38] Michael which is Christ the only way we
[1:30:43] could be the word that is not unbelief
[1:30:45] is to get got on the inside of us we're
[1:30:48] a very product of unbelief body spirit
[1:30:50] soul everything when we must be born
[1:30:53] again so you must believe this message
[1:31:03] oh brother Davis all right but if you
[1:31:06] have what you talked about when he got
[1:31:08] back at you do you're not a doctor
[1:31:18] because if marco was who he and God was
[1:31:21] who he was why did Michael have to take
[1:31:24] care of the situation
[1:31:31] you see when that comes out on black
[1:31:39] why didn't Michael destroy it Lucifer
[1:31:41] the first entity because his father had
[1:31:48] already told him the plan of salvation
[1:31:55] right Michael knew the plan of salvation
[1:32:02] and he knew that Lucifer had to go
[1:32:04] through these things and they need have
[1:32:06] to face him and cast him out and he dr.
[1:32:08] facing here you have to face him in the
[1:32:10] end time inside of you and I he knew
[1:32:13] that so how do you know that he knew the
[1:32:22] plan of salvation was because I was
[1:32:25] backed up with him according to joel you
[1:32:28] know according to joe the other week the
[1:32:33] message you know I was back never in him
[1:32:36] and I heard the plan of salvation and I
[1:32:43] knew my father would have to turn his
[1:32:45] back to allow sin to appear and it would
[1:32:52] have to keep that back tournament until
[1:32:55] you and I become one with the atonement
[1:32:59] come on Jesus
[1:33:02] I cone these things what is sin to not
[1:33:08] believe God's Word you want to work the
[1:33:15] works of God
[1:33:23] you know what the Bible says the Bible
[1:33:26] says to work the works of God is to do
[1:33:28] what leave on them that God has sent you
[1:33:36] might not like me in my ways and that's
[1:33:38] all right I'm sorry I wouldn't be Who I
[1:33:43] am if I was who you are but what is the
[1:33:52] word say
[1:33:56] you mean brother Dale at little Georgia
