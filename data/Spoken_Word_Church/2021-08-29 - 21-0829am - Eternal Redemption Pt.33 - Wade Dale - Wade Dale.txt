you once we get started it'll it'll probably run as long or longer than the regular service does amen so i just thought in my heart to do that and it keeps coming back so we're going to do it on the 12th uh because brother louise and sister christine is going to be gone the next weekend so we didn't change it just for them but we changed it so we could all be here and that we could um gather together and worship amen also remember on september the 25th brother andrew glover will be here that weekend with us that will be our youth service we'll be getting that together since it will be september on wednesday all right also uh it was it was spoken of a brother royale now he ha he does not have coven anymore he's he's coveted free amen but he's been there so long the dialysis is but it's all working and his heart's held up good and we're just praying that the lord will wean him off all that other but he is coveted free there is no covet he has got through all that and he doesn't have covet anymore but it has it has wracked his body so much until um but hey if god take him through that he'll take him through all the others amen also i want to thank you for your prayers for friday and saturday i was in the hospital there for a couple of days was something that happened i know you all prayed for me i know you all did everybody did but i was getting ready to do a stress test and i get two little pictures text to me one of them was the bonnet girls standing up for me and one was little zoe yorego played me a song on the piano now i know i i no not belittling anybody's prayer but those two touched me more than anything because that's god's kids and for them to be able to do that and i want you to pray because i want to read you this quote because i don't know if you knew if you all know this or not but i've been struggling for a while for different from different things but it's like it's been moving around and it's kind of like they're shooting at it with a shotgun and uh so when they put me in the hospital friday i said look don't want to go home until we find out everything from nose to toes and i'll tell y'all one more time i do have a brain it's it's documented and i do have a heart it's documented okay so i just want to get that out of the way so don't call me heartless and brainless anymore but they put me through every test saturday stress test nuclear um when i tell you what ekg what was it echocard what was the one where they do the the echo echocardiogram they did echo at four o'clock four o'clock saturday morning they did every test and they all came back fine hey man but but when i walked out of the hospital i had the same symptoms when i walked in i was just about ten thousand dollars later in money that puts a lot of stress now the insurance will pay for most of that but but still going through all that two days and then you walk out with the same symptoms it just makes you think about things you know and and like i said there's nothing wrong with me as far as i know internally they did ct scan from here down they did one up here the other day i did the stress test i stayed on the treadmill for eight and a half minutes on an incline and i did fine didn't fall out and they checked my heart and it was fine oh i want to tell you something before we get started i did talk to the cardiologist and here's my um wait a minute i'm on my soapbox now he said the worst problem that he is having is with young people coming into that place and having their heart checked and the walls of their heart are thinning out and their heart is enlarging because of i'm going to hurt your feelings monster red bull all those energy drinks he said they're killing our young people now i'm just telling you what he said he said it's enlarging their heart beforehand and he said if you have any children he said and deanna drinks them every once in a while too so i'm gonna get on with her but you need to stop drinking those energy drinks i mean why would you drink something with a monster with a claw on the side of it i thought we was trying to get away from the market i made the beast i'm drinking a monster to help me i'm just telling you what the doctor said he said their heart's enlarging because it's eating the um the muscles on the inside of the heart because of all that caffeine and all that stuff and he said whatever was in that he said 30 years ago fda took it off the market because it was some kind of something that was killing people because they were doing it for diet you know it's revving them up whatever that chemical is he said they just a few years later they just run it right back in under a different name and put it in the red bull and all that other stuff so be careful be careful i mean listen we we do need my point is we need to god's going to take care of us but let's just try to take care of some things our own self that's you know like we all need to eat a little better and going to die maybe a little bit so i'm going to read you this quote though because this is this is something i i was thinking about yesterday because when that lady came in i know i'm holding you up for a minute but you know what you stand up you don't fall asleep amen so the lady walked in and she said well she said i guess i got good news i said what do you mean you guess you got good news she said well there's nothing wrong with your heart she said but if you're still having no symptoms we don't know what it is because i mean they checked me all the way i mean you can see my blood work blood works fine i did get a cough but i did get a covet test and it was negative so thank god for that one listen to this quote the kind heavenly father as this woman is seeking to have life and to be rid of this misery standing before this audience tonight i pray for our lord with all my heart and your service the doctors has tried to relieve her of this but has failed to do it but thou will not fail we still believe that god's alive right amen thou will not fail your god and you can't fail and now satan to you that's bound this woman you've hid it from the doctors but you can't hide it from god come out of this woman in the name of jesus christ that's the discernment we need to look for sure we lean on doctors but satan can try to hide all he wants to but i was talking to richard douglas yesterday and he said man he said you wouldn't believe at all the sicknesses and and covet and all that the uh that the fivefold ministry is going around the world being afflicted by it so we must be doing something right but i need to find out what this is going on in my body because i feel just the same as i did ten thousand dollars ago but now the doctors did what they said they was gonna do they said you're you're fine there's nothing there no abnormalities no you know nothing's enlarged and but you just pray not just for my health you just pray that god will show that thing and i can get rid of it because i'm tired of it i'm tired and i'm tired of it amen so brother bob is going to preach this afternoon and just uh pray for us and like i said let's pray that that prayer you can talk to satan he talks to you all the time don't he hello he talks to you probably more than god does right so let's let's talk to satan and say look buddy time for you to leave i want him to be uncomfortable listen i want him to be uncomfortable in this thing this is where i want him to be uncomfortable i want him to be uncomfortable in this thing first and then everything else will take care of itself but you just keep us in prayer we'll all do the best we can i'm not gonna nobody's gonna stop lord of mercy why in the world when we stop we got too much to do all right let's go to the eternal plan of redemption part 32 let's bow our hands dear heavenly father thank you for this day that you give us we appreciate the time that we have lord to speak to your bride now we pray lord that you sanctify us for this journey lord you said you would equip us with everything we needed and lord i pray that we'll pick up the sword and pick up the shield and take the armor and lord will take as the prophet said one time we'll take it to the heart of the enemy and take care of him lord and lord we pray that you'd be with each one around the world lord that it does seem like the little bride's being beat up by satan and all these different diseases and anxieties and cares of life but you promised we'd make it you promised you would equip a bride to make it in the end time so lord we must come under that come under that holy come into that holy of holies to where nothing else can be there except for me and you are the bride and you lord that's what we're looking at father because we're talking about a millennium now in just a minute where we're going to sit with you and rule and reign a thousand years and we're going to be able to talk to you lord we're going to be able to do as the old as the old man said told brother adam said i don't care about anything else just let me look at him for a thousand years just let me look at him for that whole thousand years so lord i want to see you now and your people i want to see you now and your word made manifest through the people and father we pray that you'll be with each one take care of us and sanctify us for this journey lord in jesus name we pray amen sorry i usually don't boohoo hebrews 9 11 but christ being coming high priests with good things to come by a greater more perfect tabernacle that is to say not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the brother of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered once in the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us revelations 11 3 and i will give power to my two witnesses and they will prophesy a thousand two hundred three score days closing sackcloth and isaiah 65 17. i'll try to get to that today for behold i create new heavens now we know it's not going to be an annihilation and a creation he's going to do just like he did you he didn't annihilate you he just burnt you off by the holy ghost and fire burnt the old you out and put the holy ghost inside well that's what he's going to do he's going to i was reading a quote a minute ago brother brown said we won't need the holy ghost in the millennium we need it now we don't need it over there because we will be the holy ghost we will be anointing to the temple we won't need the holy ghost to lead us and guide us we'll be in perfection there with the lord jesus but behold i create new heavens and a new earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind you may be seated in the lord at his blessing to reading the word and so we'll just fly through this real quick god bless you for being here today you know we we've struggled for a long time all of us we've all been through battles but it'll be over pretty soon amen it'll be over matthew 16 verse 15 now we were talking about and i hope you can that you see this simon says thou art to christ the son of the living god and jesus said unto him blessed art thou simon bar jonah for flesh and blood have not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church a revelation of the son of god that he's going to come back on the day of pentecost he's going to indwell a group of people and they're going to be little jesuses for 2000 years everybody got that say amen all right and the gates of hell which we know the gates of hell's right here shall not prevail against it so we need to we need to truly understand and we'll get into it a little bit further as we finish this we'll get into the son of man and see uh see what the son of man is we'll start back uh aaron and different ones have been talking about it but we're gonna start back in the old testament and bring that son of man all the way into the new testament and we're right here because this is where this is the age of the son of man as brother claude was talking about the age of aquarius which is the water boy which is the only man in the zodiac right with the water pot amen so son of man is what we're gonna we're not gonna deal with today but that's what's got to come before we take a rapture the revelation of the son of man has got to come before we take a rapture and we'll we already talked about that a little bit but let's go to revelations 4 1 because after that comes up we're going to be caught up come up hither and i'll show you things which being here after and immediately i was in the spirit and behold the throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne now that's our rapture now remember the time periods the time periods are going to be the first two thousand years was from adam to the flood everybody got there the first two thousand years was adam to the flood then from the flood to christ from christ to um 2000 or now the 2000 church ages and then there's going to be a millennial reign that's going to happen later on after that so you've got all these dispensations you and i are in what we're in the bride are the gentile dispensation and we're waiting now for the son of man and then not waiting but you know for the full manifestation that everything will come to pass and that we will take a body change we which are alive and remain me and brother rush were talking about this yesterday he's still really hung on that because see that's a promise that if you now if you and i don't see that promise we're not gonna make it we which are alive and remain that's us we shall not sleep behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep that's what you've got somebody's got to stand up and say that's me amen so now as we do that and we go and take a rapture then we know what's going to happen the tribulation according to matthew 24 21 for then shall be great tribulations such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no ever shall be listen the tribute we think this is this is just nothing compared to what's going to happen nothing compared to what's going to happen okay what's going to happen is is we're going to absolutely get out of here and then it's going to be the wrath of god poured out on a sinless nation amen and a sinless world and then we know in just a few minutes what happens to that god goes to israel and begins excuse me speaking to them to do what bring their dispensation into being the three and a half years that they get of the calling out of the 144 000 matthew 24 says for there should be great tribulation such as not since the time of the world of this time nor ever shall be now revelations 2 verse 20 there is a time in that 2000 years because this is the church ages there's a time in that 2000 years that god's going to give the church because the woman jezebel that's a church he's going to give the church time to repent behold i will cast her into bed and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repented their deeds and they did not they did not they took those deeds and made them doctrines as you'll see in the church ages if you'll study your church ages like we always have that it goes saying deed doctrine they met a doctrine on all those deeds and then and what was it trinity three unclean spirits like frogs all the different things like that that's what we're living or they are living under not us now revelation 13 4 and they worship the dragon which gave power to the beast now see we're not going to be here we're going to be gone we're going to see this but this is going to happen because it says they worship the dragon which gave power to the beast now we're talking about the united states and and the different ones giving power to rome or to the to the beast and they worship the beast say who is likened to the beast who is able to make war with him like i told you before he's going to do some miracles he's going to be allowed to do some miracles that's going to turn the whole world toward this one man but it's going to be the most godless person that ever ever stepped foot on the earth it's going to be the antichrist the epitome of the antichrist that was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue three and a half years or 42 months and he opened his mouth and blasphemed against god to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle them that dwell in heaven and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and overcome them power's given him all kin look at the power that was given this guy kindred tongues and nations look and all that dwell on the earth and all that dwell on the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life with lamb slain from the foundation of the world if you have the baptism of the holy ghost today you can't be deceived now you can you can be confused but you can't be deceived if you've got the true baptism of the holy ghost today you can't be deceived you can like i said before you can be confused or you can have questions or you can have these things in your mind or in your heart but you can't be deceived because what's deceiving the world out there now that doctrine of the water baptism all the different doctrines like brother bob was talking about the cutting of the hair i mean you go out there and they're just they're just taking what they want in the world they're pulling out what bible parts they want and putting in parts that they that don't need to be there and and they're just what so they're worshiping satan thinking they're worshiping god what a deception in this end time that really makes you shivers run down your spine because you know what you were caught up in that system before you got born again you and i were caught up in that very system before you were born again and if you're not born again you're still caught up in that system it doesn't matter where you sit make a difference where you're sitting at today if you're not born again you're in that system because all all that dwell on the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world let's go to revelations 11 3. now this after the gentile dispensation's over he's going to give power to two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred three score days now who is that two witnesses they're gonna prophesy what they're gonna three and a half year message to israel that's all they're to get that's all they promised to get and they're to pull out 144 000 and they've got all kinds of power too if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of the mouth now listen fire's not going to come out of their mouth it's going to be the word that they speak amen so it's the word that comes out of their mouth that they're speaking just like me and you you've got to believe that that your word has power if you're speaking the word of god and you've got the baptism the holy ghost there's mechanics and dynamics everybody says we're waiting on you know we got mechanics we're waiting on dynamics if you got the new birth you got the dynamic the mechanics is this the dynamics is what you read of it and believe it and have faith in it and know that it's right regardless of whatever happens regardless if your best friend or your neighbor quits a message or your or this and there your pastor quits the message and whatever you want to call it you stay with the message you stay with the message of the hour because that's what's going to carry us through and then that same anointing is going to go after this dispensation's over where is it going it's going right over to the jews for three and a half years and they're going to preach the power that you and i get at the end they're going it's just going to carry right over into the jews and they're going to have see look you say well this is only to them well listen for us to get out of here we got to have some miracles happen too we need some miracles right now i was reading quotes brother brown i'm talking about two people asking about the millennium said and dad's quoted it many times brother brown says they said we need sons of god in the millennium he said we don't need sons of god in the millennium he said we need him now he said we don't need healing in the millennium he said we need healing now so we need this now that we can that fire can proceed out of our mouth and what we say is going to come to pass you just keep speaking it and let god take care of the rest okay because listen you can't make it happen but you can be available when it happens when god wants it to happen you put yourself available and god will use your vessel and make whatever xyz that you want to put in there that'll make it happen just to get through life a lot of times that way so daniel 9 24 let's go to the real quick i want to try to get the millennium 70 weeks remember it takes 490 years now remember i was thinking about this today take 490 years so because it's 70 weeks times 7 7 7 is 49. so 490 years for them to come to redemption now to me and you that's no dates or times we come to redemption as gentiles as individuals they're coming as a nation they're coming as a nation as a people and as a city all right that's how god deals with the jews that's always how he wanted to deal with the jews everybody got that so 70 weeks what 70 times seven 490 years because that remember seven sevens keeps you in church ages if i understand that the millennium will be the golden jubilee it will be after the 490 years is over with it'll be one extra day it'll put us in the millennium which will be the jubilee year now see we get a jubilee year but spiritually our release to go free is when our bodies change and we go up in a rapture but over there in israel though their 70 weeks are determined upon thy people in thy holy city to do those six things what to restore israel back to bring them back to redemption and bring a city into view all right everybody got that so 70 weeks 7 7 is 490 years 483 has already been taken care of to calvary then there's one week left after the rapture and when that week is over that's the end of the 490 that's still the seven sevens then you go into the golden jubilee which is a millennium and that's what they're going to that's why it's not to us it's to the jews it's not to us okay let's read jeremiah because they're going to have listen they're going to have to pay for their sins even you and me as christians we are going to have to pay for our sins the ones we don't confess everybody got that that's why you want to pray without ceasing and ask god to forgive you every day of the little things that you do because look but that great day that none is like it it's even the time of jacob's trouble but he shall be saved out of it for it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord of hosts and i will break his yoke from off of the neck and will burst our bonds listen they've been bound for two thousand years when he when they rejected christ at the cross and said let his blood be on us and our children then all the generations during the gentile age that we just talked about the jews are being persecuted we talk about the six and a half million because that's the ones we read about but go back way back to 80 70 when they were dispersed a lot of them went to russia and they persecuted them in russia put them in a thing called the ghetto everybody know where that ghetto is you know that's the word we we get old well the ghetto didn't come from where you think it came from it came from russia taking the jews and sticking them into a piece of the city and kind of building a wall around them and said that's where you go that's your ghetto that's where you go and they were living in poverty and all these different things so they were they've been persecuted everywhere they went but like i said before even scofield realizes that even though a jew is an outcast to us everywhere they go that nation prospers because god's going to take those nations though here in just a minute we'll read it god's going to take those nations that he dispersed them into he's going to destroy every one of them he's going to destroy every one of those nations foreign shall come to pass in that day saith the lord that i will break his yoke from off thy neck and i will burst my bonds and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him see strangers listen we're dogs remember to to the jews but they've been serving us for 2 thousand years because they're not back now look now they're back in the homeland now they're a nation now they've got their own this and that and the other now they've got their own and they're back inside the jerusalem the homeland so what's god doing he's bringing them back wherever he dispersed them from he's bringing them back look but they shall serve the lord their god and david their king whom i will raise up unto them now remember it's not it's not david the person it's the son of david which is jesus christ that he promised would sit on the throne during the millennium all right and david their king who i will raise up up unto them therefore fear thou not owe my servant jacob and who is jacob israel neither be this made o israel for lo i will save thee from afar and thy seed from the land of their captivity russia united states germany wherever they've been dispersed to and then god's going to do what destroy those nations the battle of armageddon is going to be all the nations that are destroyed thy seed from the land of their captivity and jacob shall return and shall be in rest he's talking about the millennium and be quiet because look they're not resting over there now even though they're in their homeland i mean they're dropping read about it you don't really read about it over here but they drop 20 30 bombs a day over there they just keep throwing them at each other all the time so there's the sirens going off and planes going over and there's no rest but they will have a rest in the millennium i promise you that amen because listen we entered into our arrest by the baptism of the holy ghost and then we get a new body because of the baptism of the holy ghost that's our rest and then we go to a wedding supper and then we were resting then when we come back to the millennium we're resting still because why would you want your wife new wife what brother brown said one time why would you want your new wife to go out and work in the yard and build vineyards and build houses and i know we've done it before but god is not going to do that to you jacob shall return and shall be in rest and be quiet and none shall make him afraid for i am with he saith the lord to save thee according to daniel 70 weeks though i make a full end of look of all nations whether i have scattered these so he's like i said before he's going to make all those ten kingdoms and all those things it lets the battle of armageddon's going to do away with every one of them because they persecuted the jews everywhere they've been they've been persecuted even the united states at one time they've been persecuted all right do i make a full end of all nations whether i have scattered thee yet will i not make a full end of thee he's making him a promise he's not going to destroy them he's going to bring him back in the homeland but now look but i will correct then measure they did something back there that god can't forget they put him on a cross but he made eternal redemption for them because they're part of this plan of eternal redemption so thank god for that and i will not leave thee altogether unpunished he's going to punish him but he's not going to punish him like he's going to punish this world revelation 6 verse 12 and i beheld when he had opened the sixth seal although there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sack cloth of hair the moon became his blood stars of heaven fell upon the earth even as a fig tree casted their own timely figs when she is shaking of a mighty wind and the heavens departed as a scroll when it was rolled together and every mountain and island were moved out of their places now listen we're not here so don't worry about it if you're watching in tonight you live on an island don't worry about it if you're born again you're not going to be there but that island is going to crash into the sea sometime after that we get out of here and before the battle of armageddon or somewhere around that time i was reading too where brother brown was talking about laodicea do you know laodicea what was allowed to see it destroyed by the writ the literal town city in asia minor was destroyed by a series of earthquakes it just fell right over into the sea he said so will happen at the end of this age a series of earthquakes will just break this place to pieces so this is going to happen worse though because we're not going to be here we might go through a few earthquakes and and lord we need to pray for those people in new orleans i don't know what's going on but that was one of the biggest hurricanes they said that ever hit the hit the um that area down there in new orleans so just pray for the people and the kings of the earth and the great men the rich men and chief captains mighty men every bottom and every free man hid themselves in dens and the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand well look nobody's going to be able to stand no one's going to be able to stand that all right everybody got that say amen all right now the seventh seal let's read this quote notice there's a whole earth to be purged there will be such a thing that the moon stars and all nature will be purged you see what it is the earth is renewing herself being purged getting ready for the millennium the millennium's coming up and see everything has got any felt on it is to be purged during that sixth seal now what time what time element is that under the two prophets they open the sixth seal so the two prophets open these happenings before the millennium takes place all right so now let's go to revelation 7 1. try to get through this and get to the millennium now after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds water winds wars that the wind would not blow on the earth nor on the sea and on any tree and i saw another angel ascending from east having the seal of the living god and he cried with a loud voice of the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and see saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants now brother brown said that's not bride we're not servants we're bride but the 144 thousand are servants because they lost their position when they put jesus on a cross until we have sealed the servants of our god in their forehead i heard the number of them which were sealed now see remember under the gentile dispensation it's many tongues nations you can't even count them but you can count these and i heard the number of them which were sealed and there were sealed 140 and 4 000 of all the tribes of the children of israel now what's going to happen is daniel 9 27 when that ceiling is over the satan the antichrist whatever you want the beast he's going to confirm the covenant with many for one week this is right after we leave but in the midst of that wheat so after three and a half years of that preaching that's over with he's going to break the covenant he's going to step on the scene and he's going to say i'm god worship me i'm god well god's not going to be able to stand for that in revelations 11 verse 7 even as we see that when they had finished their testimony the beast descended out of the bottomless pit to make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them and they're going to lay in the street but what's going to happen they're going to take a rapture they're going to be raised from the dead then the 144 000 and they're going to take a rapture now let's go to number two in the 70th week of daniel all right now let me stop here just a minute as you might know beyond one shouted out i just wouldn't take that one place i can take it through the entire scripture prove to me that seven days set one week is seven years in the bible i just did it in revelations the 13th chapter or 11th chapter all right look them prophets will prophesy excuse me one thousand two hundred and three score days which is in the midst of the last week of the jews then they're cut off and armageddon sets in so the two witnesses leave the 144 000 leave he breaks that covenant with the listen he didn't break the covenant with with 144 thousand just like me and you we never were in a church age if you're born again you were called out of the church age they got born again they got called out of that whatever that age is and they're going to be gone before the battle of armageddon sets in all right trying to get to order it down here now number three and when he gets the money all that under control then he'll break this covenant with the jews as daniel said he would do i missed the last half of the 70th week of daniel then brother what will he do he'll have all the world's trade the commerce pack with the world listen he's going to have everything under his control everything and during that time the two prophets will rise on the scene and call 144 000 then what will take place then the mark of the beast of revelations will set in because he holds all the commerce trading everything in the world what will take place then the mark of the beast will come and that no man can buy or sell except him that has the mark of the beast so they're all going listen before you got born again listen before you got born again what was your whole life centered around making money and finding how to make more money and how to have more stuff amen well that's what these people do because they're not born again they want stuff so they go to the person that's got the stuff and they really don't care what they got to do they say okay we'll do whatever we need to do just we need to buy ourselves some of this gold or whatever it is but look thank god the church will be enjoying a great three and a half years in glory we don't have to go through that thank god we don't have to go through that all right let's go to revelations 19 6. the bible says for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready now this is where in the rapture we're caught up said blessed is he that's called up to the mad supper of the lamb so we're going to a mad supper like i said before it does not matter how long we're going to be there because we're not going to be in time okay but we know that a time element has got to be on earth of three and a half years of the preaching of of the two witnesses so that's how we know that all right now let's go to revelation 16 13. this is where i see saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon now the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet for they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world see we think the president's powerful he's just a puppet to this guy every other nation is just a puppet to this guy even now all that's working folks it's not just one day they're going to walk up and go oh this great beast no they're working on it right now it's all working on right now and listen i believe the 144 thousands over in israel and those two witnesses may be over there too because we're so close to getting out of here they got to be raised up they can't be little children they got to be over there so look everything's in place all the actors are here we're just getting ready to what do forward the play as far as what we're talking about brother brown says acts of a play and that's what we're doing we're playing out what the world what the bible told us that we're going to play out who was that to gather them to the battle of that great day of god almighty why are they going to do that they're going to gather together in a place called armageddon so when they do that they're going to be fighting for control of the whole world all right they think they're fighting for it now but they're going to really be fighting for it then so let's go to number four did we get through this yeah we'll not read it y'all know what that is the great battle of armament it'll finally wind up that'll be the last of it when she comes to the battle of armageddon that'll sell the whole thing just before the great millennium armageddon is to clean off the earth she repurifies herself with this atomic blowing so it's going to be an atomic battle it's not going to kill demons it's not going to kill spirits they're just going to be suppressed for a while we'll read that in a minute and the volcanic ash and things sink this soaked blood of men and upon the earth and sin and crime she sinks beneath the earth and the volcanic breathes out again and renews cleans the earth for the great millennium so now let's go to ezekiel 40. this is when the millennium temple is going to be built and the vision of god now who's ezekiel a prophet to israel not a prophet to the gentiles the prophet to israel all right so his prophecy is to israel and the vision of god brought him into the land of israel and set me upon a very high mountain by which was as the frame of a city on the south in other words what did he do he showed him the whole dimensions of this city because remember it's got to be to thy people and the holy city city's got to be built that city's got to be restored according to daniel 9 24. and it's got to be it's got to be done within that 490 years that's why they can't just be three and a half years after the rapture to finish daniel 70 weeks there's got to be one week because the battle of armageddon starts in the middle of it it's not going to be a one-day battle and then they're going to come down and build i'm just telling you what the bible says they're going to come down and build this temple because you and i what we're not getting any calluses on our fingers no we're done why do they call it rest come to me all year labor and heavy lady and i'll give you rest brother brown said that was the baptism of the holy ghost oh yeah we fight for every inch of ground even with the holy ghost but listen if you got the baptism in the holy ghost think of all the rest that you're going to have later on oh my listen you can't fathom because number one we're time creatures number two we hurt an ache all over the place we're getting older but that's going to totally reverse one day and the former things will be passed away behold what all things will be made new yeah son of man behold with thine eyes and hear without ears and set that heart upon all that i should show thee so there's an intention for him doing this for to the intent that i might show them unto thee are thou brought hither declare all that thou seest to the house of israel not to me and you we don't build temples we don't build cities listen our future home is still not showed up yet and we don't build it at all brother brown said he builds it according to your desire amen so you don't have to build any of that because once reading this we must realize that when we read these scriptures brother brown says some of these scriptures you can overlay them for the millennium and the future home but some you cannot you have to separate them because it says they'll build houses and inhabit all this stuff that's not a future home john says i saw the holy city come down out of heaven as a bride a dorm for a husband so there's your difference so now let's read number five the sixth full purpose there will be an anointing when the most holy place will be anointed so they're gonna build the temple but now remember they're servants they're not bride so they're going to build the temple and be servants in the temple but who's going to be the anointing listen it only took a prophet to tell us this that the secret of this whole thing is is that you're the anointing to the temple that you and jesus christ are so much one to your husband and wife husband and wife is way more one than husband and servant or wife and servant your husband and wife are one that's that's what's been given to me and you so you and i listen by the baptism of the holy ghost we are the holy of holies there's not a building over there we got to go find the holy of holies you walk around with the holy of holies inside of you every day amen every day listen if you'll think about that if you'll think about that we'll quit acting the way we acting when you say that that thing was so revered and so precious that if if one thing was off the priest died one little thing god said do this do this do this do this do this if one thing was off it meant his life me and you walk in that every day amen every day come boldly to the throne the holy of holies has been opened up what and let the world see who it is thank god for the old testament to give the types and shadows and see that's what's blind to the jews though folks they think they got to get back to that temple literal temple literal sacrifices and when 144 000 walk up and say sorry i'm the temple of the holy ghost they're going to hate them they're not going to like them at all they're going to be persecuted by their own people amen there will be anointing when the most holy place will be anointed the holy holiest of holy is the most holy the most holy place is a sanctuary where god lived between the cherubims and this time christ will sit in the most holy place with the anointing upon him now who is the anointing me and you you and i are the anointing to that temple according to what the prophet said so we ride back according to revelations 19. let's read that real quick now remember we read revelations 19 first of it said the bride or wife has made herself ready then there's all that singing and praising and then all of a sudden we show back up again in the end of revelations 11 through 16 and i saw heaven open behold a white horse and he that set upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he does judge him at war as israel's flame of fire and on his head was many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and rolled it on up and his name is called the word of god in the beginning was the word where with god the word was god and the word was made flesh and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed and fined linen white and clean and out of his mouth go with a sharp sword what not a sword a word that with it he should smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth the wine press a wine press of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god he had on his vesture on his thy name written look capital letters king of kings and lord of lords the people that are behind him have become him there's no lesser elves or no lesser k's they've all become one when we write back in the millennium listen the whole world will know who we are the whole world that's going to be raised up the whole world that's the 144 thousand all those people whoever is going to be in the millennium is going to know that you and i are mrs jesus christ not another person not a different person but the same person made manifest in another form called his bride all right so now let's start this is starting the millennium right here real quick it's just 11 30. all right let's go we'll read the chart just go because you know these things what was it let's read this right here oh we got two to read what is it his people had just crowned him king of kings and lord of lords remember he had many crowns coming back to his holy temple anointed with the presence of god to live and reign through the millennium with his church bride the appearing with the mighty kings to take her place at his side the new royal anointed temple i like that now look now look what he says down here below that scroll down up please now the sixth full purpose of revelation 6 1 to revelations 19 21 is fulfilled revelation 6 1 to 1921 is fulfilled why the bride has come back with the groom they've they've been they've the world's been wiped off a temple has been built they're getting ready for that jubilee year that thousand years that nobody's going to do anything but just rest and what's going to happen is we're going to come right into that temple and we're going to walk into that holy of holies and the six-fold purpose of revelation 6 1-19 21 will be fulfilled can't be fulfilled until me and you go in that temple let's read number seven now notice that's where we've seen her coming back to the millennial temple her her her bride her back to the millennial temple over here at the end of the jewish age what is the end of the jewish age the end of the 490 years right everybody got that it's the end of that of the 70 times 7. here he comes riding on a white horse those followed him on white horses horses powers dressed in white blood or vesture dipped in blood wrote on him the word of god he cometh the mighty conqueror yes sir to set up what to set up the millennium coming to the temple glory there he meets because see remember the 144 000 don't go to the marriage supper they're not bribed they're down here building the temple and once they get it built here we come back to meet the 144 thousand and they see us walking in and they go so this is what it's all about we've been we've been building this waiting on them to get here our great king david now why do we have to have a millennium we covered it a little bit but now remember i want you to think about this the millennium and the future home is different in one major point one major way everybody wake up a minute bob you gonna have trouble this afternoon buddy unless they take an unsleeping pill i don't know if you ever make one of those don't drink a monster i don't care if you fall asleep don't drink a monster stop drinking them things rebuke you right from the pulpit you either good job michael i wanted him to confess that it's okay you're all right okay we good i lost my whole train of thought what was i talking about people being asleep no listen i got it i know what i'm talking about the millennium is a time element so everything that happens in the millennium will have an end to it everything all right now future home is eternal and nothing will happen into it everybody got that because between the millennium and the thousand years you got a battle of gog and magog that's going to destroy the world again but this time it's going to destroy the demons it's going to destroy the beast and the false prophet then there's going to be a new city that'll never see there'll never be a change anymore after that that's the one that me and you now see that's where you and i we've waited that whole time because that's our city john topped the bride right john saw the city coming down out of heaven so it's coming from heaven from another dimension jesus said what behold i go prepare what place for you that where i am you will be there also that's not the millennium now see you can take that double it is talking about the millennium or you can take it a triple meaning he's with you now and then we go to the millennium but that's remember honeymoon but we're looking past that thousand years to that one home that he promised he'd build not me and you build he'll build it for us by what by your desires and we'll read that later on but as we read this remember the millennium is a time element it is in the old seventh day rest god created the world in six thousand years or six days and he rested on the seventh that is the millennium to the people so everybody got that so as we go through this be careful how you put this in because remember the new heavens and new earth that's coming down out from john is a different city than the city we're going to live in in the millennium remember the city in the millennium that we're going to live in was made by the jews the 144 thousand and it will be destroyed again because we won't need a temple didn't know what the bible says we'll get into that later on revelation says it won't need a light won't need a temple when we go to that new city there won't be any temples like that amen all right let's go to a second peter why do we have to have a thousand years ladies letting on front row why we have to have a thousand years okay i'm going to tell you but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is where the lord is a thousand years and a thousand years is one day boy got you off the hook on that one didn't i all right let's go to the next scripture that tells us what this is all about look but of the tree of the of the knowledge of good and evil thou shall not eat now did they eat of that tree yes they did right and they died methuselah lived how long how much 969 he got close to a thousand adam was 900 methuselah all the different lamination all those different ones was 900 and can you imagine living 900 years brother dardy you imagine living 900 he said about 80 is about good enough for you right for the day look for in the day now remember the day that they partook in the garden they did not die physically right they died spiritually because of this thing not in their soul but this thing fell all right for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die so they did partake of the tree of life they did eat from it and they never lived a thousand years anybody got that but to show that the sin curse is gone and that now a new eden has been restored man's going to live a thousand years so somebody's going to live a literal thousand calendar 360 day year so let's go to isaiah 65 verse 17. for behold i create new heavens and a new earth there's not going to be a bunch of earths there are going to be a bunch of heavens but there's only one earth well behold that's what the bible says behold i will create new heavens and a new earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind but be you glad and rejoice forever in that which i create for behold i create jerusalem rejoicing and her people enjoy now that's not jews i mean that's jews that's not gentiles so the millennium is to the jews i create jerusalem majority rejoice in our people joy listen you and i are going to be in eternal bodies no time element at all not going to matter to us how many days and weeks and months and years that we were there amen but what a paradox though because we're going to come down into the time element again we left the time element took a body change left the time element brought that body but listen what did jesus do what did jesus do he left time went to eternity come back down to time walked through a wall spent 30 40 days with him and ascended back up and he didn't get finished he'd come right back down again on the day of pentecost in the baptism of the holy ghost amen and i will rejoice in jerusalem and my joy and my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more hurt listen this promise in her nor the voice of crying there should be no more that's an infant of days nor an old man that has not filled his days now this part i'm telling you i'm just honest i don't understand where this fits in maybe some of you do and you can help me out with it i'll be sure appreciative of it for the child shall die 100 years old i don't brother brown said we don't die in the millennium so um but the center being 100 years old shall be accursed and they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them they shall not build in another inhabit in other words give it to another generation they shall not plant and another eat for as the days of a tree are the days of my people and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth for trouble for they are the seed of the blessed of the lord and their offspring with them look and it shall come to pass that before they call i will answer while they are yet speaking i will hear the wolf and the lamb shall feed together in the line shall eat straw like the bullet and dust shall be the serpent's meat man we got rid of them in the millennium i thought we could get rhythm snakes i just thought snakes wouldn't be there i don't like snakes i do i like them in two pieces they shall not hurt nor destroy and all my holy mountain saith the lord he's restoring it back now let's go to isaiah 66 22 for as the new heavens there it is again and the new earth which i will make shall remain before me saith the lord so shall your seed and your name remain and it shall come to pass it from one new moon to another now look that's got to be time okay that's got to be time because you got new moons and you've got so what is a new moon it's a month it's 30 days you know what i'm talking about which i will make shall remain before me saith the lord so shall your seed and your name remain and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one sabbath to another look shall all flesh come to worship before me saith the lord and they shall go forth and look upon the carcass of the men that have transgressed against me for the worm shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh now the only thing i can tell you this i'm just going to stick this in is that if it's a nuclear war there's still going to be people laying around i'm that's but i mean you look said used to look on the carcass of the men that have transgressed against me that's the only way you can place it in there because it's not going to kill it i mean it's going to kill everybody but it's not there's going to be a lot of things left as far as i'm concerned if it's an atomic explosion it's not going to level the whole world there's going to be stuff still here because they got to build that millennium temple with something okay so let's go to jeremiah 33 verse 10. thus saith the lord again there shall be heard in this place now watch this right here which ye say shall be desolate without man and beast even in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem that are desolate without man without inhabitant and without beast now that's got to be after the battle of armageddon when the streets are empty but what's going to happen they're going to come back watch the voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride that's me and you that is not israel amen the voice of them that shall say praise the lord of host for the lord is good for his mercy endureth forever and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the lord for i will cause to return look the captivity of the land that's that 50th jubilee everything's turned back for i will cause to return the captivity of the land as at the first saith the lord all right thus saith the lord of hosts again in this place which is desolate without man without beasts and all the cities shall be inhabitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down wow in the cities of the mountains and in the cities of the vale look cities there's going to be an economy we're not just going to have one city that's where mew and i are going to be but there'll be other places because they're going to build houses and in the cities of the south in the land of benjamin and in the places about jerusalem and in the cities of judah shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them saith the lord behold the day comes saith the lord that i will perform that good thing which i have promised unto the house of israel listen they hold to those promises because that's all they got in the old testament they have no new testament promise they don't even believe in the new testament so they have to go back to the old testament and look at all these promises that god's going to raise them up one day all right i will perform that good thing which i have promised unto the house of israel and to the house of judah in those days and at that time will i cause the branch of righteousness to grow up unto david and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land in those days shall judah be saved and jerusalem shall dwell safely and this is the name wherewith she shall be called the lord our righteousness for thus saith the lord david shall never want a man to sin upon the throne of the house of israel god thought so much of david that he was called the son of david and he was promised that he would sit as david on the throne ruling what 12 tribes of israel he's not ruling over us right he's not ruling no rush he's ruling over the 12 tribes of israel now let's go to the chart just for a second if you'll pull that up and then we'll be then we'll stop right here because we'll talk about david next next week because that's some really good stuff about israel as a nation the time of the millennium but just keep this in mind as we go any further if you hear anything of time it's in the millennium and some of it's going to end some of it's going to be blown up again some of it's going to go away now the future home once it sits on the earth it's done for for eternity there's nothing going to happen different everybody got that all right so now where are we blow that up right here please come this way no i'm sorry this way there you go so now you've got the battle of armageddon revelations 19 battle of armageddon purging of the earth revelations 21-7 this is going to be the 1000 years of millennial reign two prophets 144 000 and us are going to live before the battle of gog and magog everybody got that so that's the position that we're in so let's read this real quick revelations 20 verse one and then we'll stop right here give him a second to get back to it revelations 20 verse 1. and i saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand so something's got to happen when we start coming down when i say down you know i don't mean we're up on a platform somewhere i mean when we come out of this dimen another dimension into this dimension slower or faster we're going to come in like this and come into that temple somewhere though satan's going to have to be bound because remember he had a lot to do with the battle of armageddon because he's actually the only one that hadn't had to do with the battle of armageddon and man it was his forces against his forces bless his heart he can't even win he's fighting against himself amen and that's good because he's going to lose i saw an angel come down from heaven having the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and satan now look that's not three people or four that's one and bound him a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled after that he must be loosed a low season and i saw thrones and they just sat on them and judgment was given we'll get into that next week because then you got the battle of gog and magog and then you've got the judgment and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their forehead or in their hands and they lived and reigned with christ one thousand years but the rest of the dead if you don't get born again and you pass away you will not be seen in that thousand years everybody got that you're not coming up as anything the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection blessed and holy as he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power what's the second death god's going to kill your soul it may be millions of years and billions of years but one day your soul is just going to be nothing it will be void of god never to be remembered again and you decide whether you want to take that path or not because god doesn't want to he don't want you to take that path blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him one thousand years one thousand years he shall reign musicians come ruling rain for 1 000 years we don't have to prove it but boy think about let's stand think about watching this come into being think about watching all this you know we're sitting there on the throne and and and we're able to i don't think we're going to listen i don't think we're going to sit on the throne for for a thousand years and not move okay don't get that because we always say we'll sit in the room and rain no we'll be all over the world travel like a thought travel like a thought anytime we want to travel somewhere we'll travel like a talk all right so we'll do that but we're going to have fun because you know what we're going to do this is right here this is going to be ingrained in our being because we're going to be the complete bible right and we'll know that when these things start happening we'll know what part of the bible that is fulfilling we fulfilled our part only part we got to fulfill is walk into that new jerusalem the one built by god that's the only thing we get we're waiting on is that let's sing a song god bless you monica sunscreen class needs to practice at 12 40. don't forget that and pray for brother bob this
