TRANSCRIPT
========================================
all right here we go we're live Sunday morning good morning so brother Wade's traveling Nanny's not feeling well um let's just let's just start off with a little prayer real quick just to pray for everybody Lord Jesus thank you God for this day that we can we can come around your word on this Resurrection morning remembering what you the price that you paid for us yes I pray Lord that you'll be with us today and during the service God remember the ones that aren't here with us today or bro Wade sister June that you'll be with him and bless him and help them help them away this morning as he ministers and remember Sister Nanny Lord that you would uh minister to her knees Lord and give her healing mercies Lord and be with her Lord granted Lord that you'll open the word through our hearts in your in your name we pray amen all right now I wanted to uh read from First Corinthians chapter 13. this is just a little chapter and just kind of talk about some things that might pertain to this um Easter morning foreign you know there's a uh you think about that Christ has Rose he rose 2000 years ago but what's the proof of that how do you how do you know now you could say uh let's get on the internet and look at this picture of a tune uh across the sea that um we're kind of almost speculating that that is the actual tune and uh we can look at different things that people say and and do but what what is the real evidence of what the resurrection is and uh I think that's kind of what First Corinthians chapter 13 was talking about now first first Corinthians chapter 12 you know Paul was he was laying down to the church uh kind of getting things in order telling them what the non-spiritual gifts are to to quicken in our in our lives to cause us to realize that God is in our midst the nine spiritual gifts are the gift of Prophecy when somebody raises up and start starts speaking in tongues or um or prophesying or the gift of wisdom comes up and starts telling people things that uh in their lives and different things like with Solomon then it causes us to realize that God amen amen but in the at the first verse the last verse of chapter 12 Paul said now now those are all good things the nine spiritual gifts those are wonderful things but covert earnestly the best gifts and yet show I unto you a more excellent way now come on up with me a little bit higher I want to show you something that you can really base your Christian experience on that well you can that that proves the resurrection that proves the resurrection in you know I speak let's start at verse one of chapter 13. though I speak with the tongues of men in the rains and have not charity I've become a sounding brass or a tingling symbol now we know that there's there's so many different ways you can go with each one of these little scriptures that you can take this though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels now he just got through going through the nine spiritual gifts and and laying out how the God gives a gift of speaking in tongues in the church and how we you know that's the the early Pentecostals put all their faith in that that that that is that is my evidence that I've got the new birth is because I speak in tongues and it began to cause impersonations and things you know uh somebody somebody here was telling me of a Pentecostal Church they went to where everybody was slain in the spirit and uh the the minister went around laid on hands and everybody fell out on the floor under the uh under the anointing and and then one of the people on the floor feet to see if everybody else had gotten up see it causes uh because it wasn't genuine something and you know brother Branham said that if that's what you need if you need to uh if you if if that's what you're you're kind of basing your experience on that to speak in tongues and he will actually let you speak in tongues so that you can you can rank hang on that but uh Paul's saying let's let's go up a little bit higher I'll show you more excellent way that you can base your experience on and uh that what Paul is talking about here is charity and I'll we'll get it in a second what what charity really is and it really is given to the poor though I speak with the tongues of meaning of angels now brother Brandon I was listening to a sermon he spoke on about um uh the Corinthians the book of Correction the the book that uh uh that sets everything in order right because the little Corinthian Church needed to be they had a lot of problems you know they had that uh that brother that was um living with his father's wife and but you know in second Corinthians chapter seven it tells it everything ended up all right he he was restored to the faith and lots of other things in in First Corinthians that Paul is just trying to correct and um and you know brother Brandon got talking about how he was on he was listening on the radio to uh somebody talking about uh that this this uh this fellas got started talking about the book of Psalms and he was reading these scriptures and it just sounded so wonderful now now keep in contacts they'll all speak with the tongues of men and of angels that's what that's what I'm talking about and uh it sounded so wonderful what he was bringing and everything was true but this was a it turned out to be uh I never heard of this fella Jimmy Osborne who was a rock singer back in the day so uh his his life didn't match up you could you can talk but talk but if you're not walking the walk that's that's uh that's what this chapter is about I am become a sounding brass or tinkling symbol and that's what that fill ended up being on the radio he was just he was just uh rattling his gums so to speak it it uh he could um he could read the scripture and uh say what somebody else was saying but when it came down to him to to the life being made manifest in him it wasn't happening and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge now there's a big one if I can understand all Mysteries now now uh uh last Sunday we're kind of looking at a few Mysteries Mysteries that are open up like like Paul started looking up the mystery that the Gentiles would be part of the church what about the mystery of who God's name is the mystery that is there's just one God instead of three the mystery of water baptism all these Mysteries that are opened up and you can understand all these Mysteries and repeat after somebody but if if God's not living in you then then uh you don't have that surety of the Resurrection on this Easter morning though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge I was reading about how that uh that there used to be two thousand years ago there used to be this library in Alexandria that had all of the books for the ancient world and they had uh and when that that Library caught on fire and it burned down and uh you know all these historians and Scholars were so upset because all this ancient knowledge was lost and we kind of think uh well that's that's how my Christian experience should be I should have this whole library of knowledge inside of me but what about God living inside of you manifesting himself you can have that you can understand it all these books have all these books on your on the bookshelf of your mind but if it doesn't drop down in your heart and become manifest and live out through you then if it doesn't um that sorry sister back I don't mean to be staring at you I'm just picking somebody out oh so uh so uh not not just talking talking to talk but but living the life and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor now this is a good one because because that's what most people think that charity is about going out and going to the soup kitchen and and uh feeding the poor and it is it is given to the poor let's let's look at that for a second that's a second later it's not it's not going out and doing good deeds it's not uh um you're trying to do a work like the well not to throw all of them but the Catholics you know they believe that uh that you teach that if you push a penny with your nose for a certain distance or walk up these steps on your knees and and or or in the Philippines you know how they'll Thrive until they're uh believing that that that is what their salvation is based on though I give my body to be burned I was I saw in the news the other day there was a fella in overseas a Buddhist monk that went out in the street because he was uh he uh he was fighting for but it was so important to him that he went out the street and dashed himself for gasoline and set himself on fire now that's an admirable thing to do that's that's wonderful but and I you know many many stories of people that have given their lives for a call they're giving their lives for I was reading a story last week about how these when the Chernobyl nuclear disaster there was three Engineers that gave their lives they Dove down into the nuclear waste and and to open up a valve so that the whole city would not be destroyed but they gave their lives for it but um now if you don't have something that's that's wonderful and those are wonderful Deeds but we we want to have an assurance the only assurance of of uh we need an eternal Insurance what this chapter is about they'll always throw all my goodness to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing now what are all those people that swung down at the bottom of the yes sister you skip who I have all faith I had a question on that yeah yeah I'm gonna get to that because the last verse is is faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity why why is Charity the greatest so hold on a second it profits me nothing all right now charity suffered alone now let's hold on a sec before we uh keep moving I want to talk about what charity is and read a few scriptures now now some some say that you know love is is uh you know brother random told us that charity was love and and that it is the baptism of the Holy Ghost God living inside of you um and and you know some people look at love charity is is uh universalism like it doesn't matter really what you do but um that you all should be we should embrace you and just pull you into the fold and that's that's actually where the World Council of churches is gonna end up everybody's we can all take Community together everything's it's all good uh just coming together in our circle of Fellowship but but real love it looks to satisfy God's requirements because real love only comes from God because that's what in the beginning God was a fountain of love he was he was the Fountain of love and if that same Fountain of Love is in you then it will try it will match up with his requirements and your desire will be according to his desire and um so it's not you can't have that kind of love and say what uh everybody come on in I I'll agree with whatever kind of of trash is rolling by um now when you say well well love should be real sweet and that is true but now you know Paul actually he named names and I was looking through some of the names that he named in first Timothy 2 20 he named hymenius and Alexander of philitus and he said you know how many is this how many US is denying the resurrection he said uh uh these people are leading you astray and what I means was doing this was he was preaching up this is this kind of ties into this Resurrection morning he was preaching that that uh when you get the new birth then then that is the resurrection now that is true in a way but uh we're looking for we're looking for a resurrection when the dead and Christ will rise and we go we go in to be with to be with Jesus where these these uh what the faith that we're looking for is made is made perfect it's swallowed up in Victory and uh and Paul named you know well you say well he named uh these unbelievers hymenius Alexander in philitus but then in uh Galatians chapter two I'm not I'm not advocating naming names or anything I'm just saying that what we what we might think of Love is is maybe not uh love is corrective and uh so Paul name in Galatians Chapter 2 he named Peter and Barnabas because you know Peter Peter was sitting Peter was sitting with the uh the Jews and and kind of making a little uh ostracizing the other believers trying to trying to put on theirs and say well I'm a I'm a Jew and going to sit down with with them instead of the the others and then he led Barnabas along with him so he he was leading Barnabas Along by his air and Paul corrected that um so what is love let's turn over to Matthew chapter 10 verse 8. actually let's start by about verse five and read down to verse 8. these 12 . yeah these two LG's are set forth and commanded them saying go not into the way of the Gentiles and into any city of the Samaritans enter you not and we're talking about charity now what is charity but go rather to the lost sheep of the House of Israel and as you go preach saying the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the Dead cast out devils freely ye have received free to give so it is giving it's giving to the poor giving to the ones that don't have anything spiritually it's not given a soup kitchen but now to have charity to give charity you first got to have it you gotta have it before you can give it out and and uh you so uh and you know you remember the in the Old Testament uh or let's see in when when the Paul and Silas were going to the gate beautiful they got there and said they said uh the baker was asking for money it didn't have any money but he said what I they said what I what we have will give to you what they had was the power of God being made manifest in their life not just a bunch of words not like in the verse verse one where he said though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels you can have all the words in in the world and speak but if the power of God is not living in your life that's that's what this is talking about charity and then when the power of God is in your life then you can give it out verse 4 charity suffereth alone in his kind now maybe a different way of reading this instead of reading charity is to put in the word Jesus Jesus suffers along and it's kind Jesus doesn't Envy he vulnerth not himself it is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in aniquely but rejoices in the truth and and then now if you have charity you can put your name in here that you suffer a long time now all of these all these attributes of Charity are are descriptive of you know when you when you read through the Bible and look at kind of uh from like almost a theological perspective of placing different things um that's wonderful but then when it really gets down when the rubber hits the road and you have to live it that's uh eat eat the book that's what becomes bitter when you got to live it now you can sit in your little study you know and well like I I said in my little my little prayer clause and and pray over and things to pray for things that I'm reading but then when you step your foot out of your house right that's when that's when things really become known see it charity suffereth long and it's kind charity envious not now think about these when you're dealing with your brothers and sisters and how how first how first God dealt with you that he suffered a long time with you while you were uh running around disbelieving his word and and then you can take his grace that he showed you and apply that to others you can now you got that charity and you can give it out charity suffereth along in his kind and chair doesn't envy and charity and phone with the knot itself is not puffed up like all these other things that Paul was talking about about knowledge out with man look out how much I've got all this library of information I've got look at look at all this thing all these things that I know and you know Paul even struggled with that he said because of the abundance of Revelation that I have God actually you know it was a great blessing that he gave me my thoughts because if he hadn't given him a thorn in the flesh then he might have uh uh gotten real big headed and everything because of all he knew but God knows how to deal with charity vote with the knot itself is not puffed up doesn't not behave itself unseen it knows how to act you know but we're going to talk about the people that would fall uh smitten in the spirit in in the Pentecostal meetings and then their dresses would fly up and things now God don't act that way God God knows how to say he's a gentleman he's very polite you know that's why uh in the church service you have to be very careful because God the holy spirit is so Meek that he won't come to a place that he's Uninvited so uh you know you definitely don't let our kids run around any sanctuary and uh you know eating bologna sandwiches in the back or uh just different things you know you have to be very respectful because think about those angels that uh cry holy holy holy in the temple now that and then somebody go running and do a cartwheel down through there those angels crying holy so we want to create an atmosphere not do anything unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil Rejoice is not an iniquity now that was what I was talking about with if the spirit of God is in you you're going to line up with a word you're not gonna uh well we can uh it'll be all right if we you know do a little a little bad thing or or get it get away away from the what we should be doing just for a little bit but Rejoice within the truth to beareth all things believeth all things hope with all things endureth all things now that's an odd way of Paul for Paul's saying but to sum up uh those four beareth all things believeth off they believe all things does that mean if somebody tells you alive you're just supposed to believe hope with all things endureth all things let me sum this up for you a Believer is an optimist that's what they're saying you look at somebody that's uh uh you know just hard to Bear but that that that spirit in you just the Bears with them and keeps on patience believeth all things somebody you know you you trust one another you know if brother Danny told me something I I'd believe him if you told me a fish was you caught was that big I'd you know I do my best to believe it hope with all things uh because hope is an expectation you're hoping you're looking at one another maybe uh somebody one of your family members that uh is is struggling to believe you're hoping you're expecting that one day they'll come to the to the knowledge that they'll they'll accept it you're hoping and and the same thing with us we're hoping we're expecting that one day we'll see him as he is face to face endureth all things charity never fail us but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether they be tongues they shall see whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away now this is why true is it better than all these other things because if you put your faith in Prophecy or in in a gift of knowledge or a gift of wisdom those things could all pass away if you don't have that assurance and you that the the charity which is which is God in you charity never faileth but whether there be a problem they might they they shall fail to be tongues they shall cease but uh whether there be knowledge you shall banish your wife or we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect he's come then that which is in part shall be done away now he's comparing these these gifts with a new birth and he's comparing where we are now in our spiritual journey with where we'll end up when we when we when we arrive in heaven all of these things that we see in part will be done away and we'll see everything in in profession but when that was just perfect just come to that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I speak as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkling but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known now the you know how the scripture says that the word of God isn't like a mirror that you can look in and examine your own life we look into this mirror of God's word and see all these representations in the Old Testament you know where they were well they went through the uh when they were eating the lamb and the before they took their Journey Through the Wilderness they probably didn't realize what was happening and so they were looking at looking into the glass Darkly they couldn't really perceive exactly what those representations meant what this showbread meant what The Mercy Seat meant all these different things but now things have become more clear and and even now we're still looking at things a little bit dark you know that we can't we can't fully comprehend the things that will comprehend when we get over there for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as I is also I am known and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity and the greatest of these is Charity because Faith and Hope are looking for something faith is is a you know brother random always or in the all in the in the Bible faith hope and charity were always grouped together uh when uh when uh Jesus went to pray for jairus's daughter he told everybody get out except for Faith open charity Peter James and John because Peter James and John represent Faith open charity now he could you can believe for something faith and you can expect something to come but when charity comes it's there the charity is the love of God it's it's right there is that help answer I have all Faith so that I can I could remove mountains and it made me think of the denomination some people there they do have faith sure and then I got to thinking is that Faith any different from the faith we speak of over here because if they start right well now this is faith that comes from the new birth that's right that is our foundation based on a new birth you know that you can have faith for a time until you get that New Birth that that is the foundation stone so you know brother Brown talked about how you could have faith in your pocket knife would show up in your pocket and he said a lot of magicians and things will actually can actually do that they can believe that that you know a spoon will bend or different things they can and it will actually be in that's a type of thing because you know he said uh in prayer lines when a little girl with cross-eyed cross eyes would come up before him he said now my faith can uncross her eyes and he would say he would believe and her eyes wouldn't cross but then he would say now now her eyes will cross back but now watch when he comes on the scene her eyes will stay crossed uncrossed and God would come on the scene and uncross uncrossed out but by his faith he could move Ah that's that's uh that's pretty deep in this yeah that's pretty amazing and uh you know according to what she said it does say even though I have faith to the mountains which is another a person who does not have the new birth I think exactly right and uh you know we uh there was a testimony about a sister overseas that um that there was a mountain in the way of a school you know and they prayed and the bulldozers came and removed the mountain and uh now that's that takes Faith to believe that something will happen to that mountain but you can have that faith that justification sanctification but when you have that that Foundation Faith then then the uh you believe you begin to believe God's word everything against be put into place and you when you have that Faith you can't say well uh you know uh I'm not sure this Prophet was a you know what I'm saying like that I'm not sure that God really sent a prophet and different things like that I hope that's his requirements yeah you're right you'll meet his requirements now um I want to read one more let me find this this was really weird just to finish up foreign John chapter 21. because the the word of the shoes for charity and in First Corinthians 13 is agape which um you know uh brother Wade and different ones have brought out all the different Greek translations of the Greek word for love and there's agapo which is God's love and Ophelia which is the Earth is kind of love and I think this just kind of really this little conversation between Jesus and Peter just really drives home the difference now agapa was an eternal kind of love that you know by someone I can slap you in the face but it doesn't matter because that agape love is not conditional you could um it doesn't matter whether somebody returns that love or not that Agape of Love is giving so filio love is the love that it's just a natural Earthly Love Now verse 15 so when they had died Jesus saith to Simon Peter Simon son of Jonas love us without me more than these and the word he uses loveth not me is agape and the Greek he's saying Agape Agape Simon son of Jonas love us love me more than these he saith unto me a lord thou knowest that I love thee but Philip uses the word filio filioce y'all know us that I love it he says unto him feed my Lambs he saith to him again the second time Simon says you almost love us thou me agapeless mate he said Lord thou knowest that I love thee he saith unto him feed my sheep now he's asked him two times do you Agape do you love me with that love that's unconditional it doesn't matter whether I love you back or whether somebody treats you just right and Peter keeps responding with the feeling of he said to him again the second time Simon son of Jonas loveth tell me say the name of yea Lord thou knowest that I love thee but he's not saying it the right way they say it unto him feed my sheep he's saying unto him the third time now this third time uh you can't see it in the English but in the Greek Jesus drops it down to feel him do you even love me with filio love Simon son of Jonas love us without me Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time love us thou me philia with filio love and he said unto him the Lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that I love thee Jesus saith unto him feed my sheep so now when you have a real charity you know uh brother round told that little story about how your um your wife can meet you at the door when you come home and give you a kiss but is it just a kiss or is it is there something behind it is there a connection behind it and and he kind of talked about how that that's how the real charity love should be we we don't love God we don't take it set aside time uh to pray and and read our Bible and set aside time with him just to meet a requirement that maybe a deacon has said or something but because you really love God and that's what real charity is agape love not and Peter Peter couldn't Peter wasn't grasp on what Jesus was asking and uh maybe sometimes we don't quite grasp either but God wants us to love unconditionally with that Agape that only God can give by the new birth and let's stop right there thank you foreign
