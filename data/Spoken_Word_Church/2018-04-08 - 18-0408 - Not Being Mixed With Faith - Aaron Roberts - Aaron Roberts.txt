TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Applause] always one more comes in god bless you this morning they said we'll look in Hebrews chapter forward I wanna thank everybody for prayers feeling better don't look however LF you learned the oldest thing in the belt I went to a fight and the hockey game broke out I thought it was basketball turning to football and I realized I was ill-prepared for that I tried not to leave an hour playing basketball and I tried to fall on top everyone jumping over him and my upper body was how fast my feet I couldn't keep my balance I'm calling sir said I should just fell only by he's younger he'd recover quicker we just thank the Lord for His healing power all the prayers still got a little bit but every day I go to work kind of work the soreness out everything getting better anyway Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 1 says let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it language have believed to enter arrest as he said as I have sworn my wrath if they shall enter in my wrath into my wrists although the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he spake in a certain place on the seventh day on this wise and God did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest sing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief again he limited a certain day saying in David today after so long a time as it is said today if they will if you will hear his voice harden not your hearts for if Jesus had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day there remaineth therefore they rest to the people of God for he meant is entered into his rest he also has ceased from his own works as God did from his let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so just we'll take a little quote from verse 2 but this whole whole section of scripture here hmm it's very good but I had written some things down and I've been looking at some things and I thought brother weeks Dunham I want I called him and told him I I know he doesn't wonderful and that was that was probably the more the best that I've ever heard him minister that's almost very time for you and well over some of the things that I have looked at and I had had little thought in my mind and one of the one of the things that come to me well brother Lewis was preaching was you know brother brems said she can't ever help anybody unless you have a burden for and you know you have to have a burden and you know I guess brother Lewis spent a lot of time talking about the young people talk about young people and one of the things that come to me because I was speaking to a young man who spent some time back but the the reason I want to talk about this this morning was I was speaking to a young man and you know this young man that had walked in in the light that he saw he said it was in the message so don't get that wrong but you know he went to the altar you know it gave his heart to God and you know you've been baptized but you know he'd never come to a place where he was at rest and the one thing that when we were talking was he told makes it he said I he said I could never take communion and because one of the things is because of the ministry and this is another thing that I'm gonna I'm gonna talk about this morning I'm so but you know he had been under such because of the preaching of the gospel and you know you have to have a balance in things because you know they have been preached so much that they've been under such condemnation that he said I'd never take communion because he said I'm not going to eat and drink damnation to myself can I talk my said well if you if you look at it that way I said none of us are perfect none of us are ever going to reach that place I said but it takes the grace of God but see that's the thing if weak as run they'll been preaching about you know the new birth brings a rest and you know we have to come to that place and you know that's what I talked about there was a in the scripture he lays out place there's a place of rest to come to that you can rest in that because you have to have that type post fit down you have to come to a place where you drive a stake down and said I know that I know that I know because it ain't never we're never gonna be perfect in this life you know I mean if we're looking for sinless perfection it will come you know because we're all we're always gonna have to fight this flesh but I thought you know brother Brown tells the story and there's many places but you know he pickups about the story about the mule the old brokedown wheel and it was you know he was born but he had a birthright and you know he said it didn't matter how the broke down the meal was or what condition the mule was in sitting on a lamb and said the priests never looked at the meal to look at his faults and failures but he looked at the that lamb the priests had to look at the lamb the lamb had to be part the Bible said the lamb and to be without blemish and I said if we look at ourselves we're always going to find fault the devil's always going to happen that's all the devil what you look at is look at you but I said if we come to a place that you have to come to a place and if we if we spend all our time and that's what I was trying to share with this young man you know if we can spend all our time looking at our faults and figures and what we can get in a get in a rut and you know the devil can beat on us and we'd never get anywhere but you know thing is this it's not how many times you fall down it's how we came to get up but you know the same word that brings condemnation also brings because the you know he talks about living in in condemnation but you know one of the things that I thought myself well the Bible says in Romans 8 it says there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus I said you know there is a condemnation and if we don't live right and inward and if we don't commit ourselves to God then yes there is condemnation and if we eat and drink unworthily at the lord's table then yes we can drink them nation to ourselves but the scripture tells us the scripture gives us the antidote he says but if we're judged of the Lord then we're chasing double as if we examine ourselves see that we don't go unworthily brother Bentham said in the message deserting the body of the Lord he said he makes us worthy we'll never be worthy if it wasn't for him he makes us worthy to do that and you know you know we see so many young people and you know you know that they're in this and this battle you know right sometimes we forget I've got one that's getting ready turn 13 this year but you know you you know it it becomes a battle and sometimes you know we forget what it was like to be teenagers because I see and you know it's a little different for boys and a little bit different you know for girls you know Sarah asked me sometimes she's but she's like she asked me about Lima because you know she didn't her little I mean her brothers are a lot older so she didn't grow up with teenage boys and I see Levi the things he does and the way he acts was like that was me that's me as I you know why don't you know whether you like it or not they're your children and they do the same things that you do whether you like it or not you know we try to stop them from and guess what it's just nature it comes out yes but you know he acts certain legs and does certain things and he's mom shakes or shakes their hand and he tries to figure out gr13 a Kansan that's way they let's talk about you earlier done a good job both sigh sidebar on this you know George Washington crossed a certain River he said Potomac Wednesday night it was actually the Delaware I talked about the weeks on the phone when I said I say don't know if you ever heard the story about the news editor man called and told about all the mistakes that was found in the newspaper the editor was unfazed then he called he said well you know what we try to fix something in our paper on everybody that's what we like to do so we're the land of Jing Fung has haven't found something in the paper that you enjoyed was finding the falls you know we always you know we always say things got a messed up on but if you're in the in the scripture you know it says that there was a promise left to us here brother Brent insists you know it's not that there wasn't a promise left us he said there was a promise left us he said but the next thing he said don't come short of it that was a promise promised to us in the work that we come to this rest you know it's not just not just the that's not just coming to rest but you know every divine promise of God in the scripture it's before us and we can come short of any of those you know he said the right mental attitude to any divine promise of God will bring it to pass the other thing is us we have to look at it the way that God looks at it because you know all through that all through the scripture you know when he's speaking speaking of the children of Israel and all the things that the children's well done you know God kept dealing with he kept pointing them out and telling them it's time to go it's time to go listen let's move on and you know they they didn't believe you know they've been when God told Abraham you know your your descendants your offspring them sojourn in a strange land and they'll be in bondage but you said I will bring an uncle come bring a deliverer and bring him out and you know they went down in there and they had got into that mindset of being in bondage for so long that you know that was their problem brother I said you know they couldn't get that mindset they were in bondage what was ever brought out they're still in bondage and didn't realize they were still in bondage and when he when he problem I'll chill brother I'm sitting was grace you know grace provided him a prophet and you know he said grace was what provided water from a rock and then that rock followed them all the way through the pillar of fire the cloud Monday you know the quail the man on all the different things that they've received and they couldn't see that the grace of God was following of all the mistakes they made of all the disbelieve all the murmurings all the complaining you know what God kept telling come on I've got a place for you here they here they were when even even when they were there and all of the things that they had to go through even even when you know when they all the murmurings and complainings and the fiery serpents come on and kill them and you know the brazen serpent God told told Moses to raise up the brazen serpent you know and said if they look on and believe they'd be healed of all the things they saw God do and even when they got to the promised land and they were ready to go in they sent the spies in to bring back the evidence and you know all the things God how many times could God prove to them it was continuous he was proven exactly what he said it this he never broke his covenant with them they broke their covenant with him and you know every single time he would go back and he would prove to them that he was true that he wanted to bless them and he everything that he had promised them was exactly that way and when the women despised when he came back they had the same report that God had told and said it's exactly the way God told us it's exactly the same way and now we can go in but you know they were the ones that said they they never said that the Giants in the land look at us as grasshoppers the scripture says we are to them as grasshoppers that was their mindset their thought was that they were thinking they saw themselves has some all that silly it's insignificant that they could believe that God would take them to that place but you know Joshua and Caleb Thompson were more the night but they did not go in they could not believe and you know the scripture says that there he said in numbers because that and your children that you said would be a pray that they would be preyed upon they would be the ones destroyed he said they'll be the ones that going him but he said your carcasses will rot in the wilderness he'd spent all that time trying to prove to him that he was real that that exactly what he was trying to give was right and you know the there's a song that I don't know if you greater vision sings I'm with y'all but with all these many miracles I don't know if y'all know that song you know they talks about all the things that God done you know God tries to prove it and you know and when we think sometimes in our mind the you know God's not going to do this what God's done it before sometimes we act like God can't heal but we struggle with our healing sometimes because it's worse than before or it's long but you know if God's done it before if he's healed us once know what stopping us from being healed again it's the same thing that we had to be healed one time competing the same faith yes and if and if if we have a need we struggle with things in our life sometimes when we wonder why we can't overcome well you know what we've overcome things before it's been the grace of God this led us this far that we overcome with things that we struggle with and then we find other things in we and we have unbelief yeah we struggle with these things what but he's the one that's proof to us that he's faithful and true and just to us up to this point yeah but see we think well we don't know what's gonna happen in the future we don't know what's gonna take place but you know what the same one he knows the end from the beginning the same one that led you this far will lead you all the way if he started a good work in you now then he'll finish the that work he'll continue to do it because you know that you know growing up you know growing up as a child you I never went you know with my dad yo I never had to doubt my dad's work I never I never doubted it because you know if my dad ever promised me anything he done this dead-level best to do it now humanly we're not able to do everything but you know what at least my dad tried because you know I always always tell everybody you know if my dad ever said he was gonna get a hold of us if he's gonna do something I can't I can't ever remember a time in my life when he said we've had it that he didn't give it my dad did my dad just didn't make out of words if my dad said he was gonna knock us in the middle of next week he done his dead-level best to do that yeah but you know that but you know that's the way God is God don't make out of words he said his word wouldn't return to Him void it's not going to return back but it'll go out and it'll do exactly what it set out to accomplish but the thing is is it's human I have other ones that have to believe that we have to be the ones to accept the word because here in the scripture it talks about the gospel was preached the good news was preached to those all through the scripture we find that the good news was preached to the people and the children of Israel they heard the good news all all through the scripture they heard the prophets came and preached the word tool but he said they did not receive they did not believe because it was not mixed with faith and that's that's the thing brethren said in the message community he said it takes the body and the blood which was the spirit the word he said mix with faith brings eternal life say if you don't take it with faith it doesn't matter he said it doesn't matter how much the spirit is here how much the word is preached how much you hear he said if you don't take it by faith it doesn't do you any good and you know that's what I was I was trying to share with this young man you know it takes faith we have we all had to take it by faith everything we've ever received from God has come by faith you know the thing is is we we look at our we look at our faults and our failures but you know we have to we have to put that in to see if forgetfulness to you know because if we if we go before God and we and we ask for forgiveness you know our past is put under the blood then you know what God doesn't see that anymore God doesn't remember that anymore and you know we can meet we can stand before it because brother s it he sees us through the wood if he sees us through the blood then later is perfect as we can be that's the reason why it says that we should come boldly before the throne of grace so you know being a father I got two boys you know we're all a lot of us are parents in here I guess everyone is but you know the thing is is you know when you have kids you don't look at what you know will give and I understand you got to correct them you got to make them but see the thing is is it's the love that you have for you know you don't withhold a good thing from Jesus said you know if your son asks the stone you know for bread what you giving my stone they said if one asked for a fish would you give him a certain thing and he said no and he said well how much more he said that you being evil asked the Heavenly Father will he not you in one place he said he'd give you the Holy Ghost when he not give you these things if you believe so we've put all these things behind us but see it's what the devil brings up and what we all love the devil to put before us that he holds us back but we can step into something and receive from God you know there's there's many people that are hindered by many things they they're hindered by their by their past and you know they'll devil out the devil to hinder them in many different ways right and you see these people one of the things I want to talk about you know there was a I was reading on Facebook you know you find anything you all know on Facebook and you know some people ought to not just the best thing to do is like they don't put nothing on their offensive pictures on their once in a while but you have some people put a lot of thoughts on there oh this is not too bad but you know what was the old saying it's better to be thought of food open your mouth and remove all down but you know some people write you know and it's in it say it and you know not not being disparaging anybody or whatever but you know people get on there and it's so amazing that the scripture perfectly lays out a fivefold ministry there's a there's a you know and and that's the what God was gonna use to speak to man he's always used that from the beginning he's always used man the scripture says that he was the foolishness of preaching he would use this and you know people are so against the fivefold ministry and this man he just he would just he just said some just some really bad things about the about the faithful ministry it was like listen where they were--they you know even if you take what brother Brennan said brother Brennan was wasn't still preaching the gospel even if you're just going to sit and listen to tapes you still had to listen to a man and ceiling is it's the same Holy Ghost that spoke through brother Branham that rode in the scripture that that would be a prophet in our day that would come and speak and you and speak the word it still is simple same Holy Ghost it's still the same mind of God that spoke then if that's true then guess what there's a fivefold ministry made up of apostles prophets evangelists teachers and pastors and you know what they still have the same mind of God and they still are under the same Holy Ghost anointing to speak the mind of God now there might be scarecrows out there but you know the thing is is one of the one of the blessings that we have by receiving the new birth is the power and the spirit of discernment see that's one thing brother Brent said you know you need to find your past and get behind me because he's ordained of God to lead you through but he said if your pastor doesn't preach the word if he gets off if he if he's contrary to the scripture he said you are obligated to leave me and find somebody else now that's the scripture whether we like it or not then you know God didn't God put that in the Bible but you came to find any place where I ever took it out so there is a there is a ministry and you know you know the thing is is I can truck but if by showing that I can trust God because I can trust his vessels the the ministry the instrumentality that he uses but see the thing is it takes the same spirit that we now have to be have the same spirit but if but if we don't get in and I'm sorry people can talk about you know and enough they don't I don't want to say anything but listen it takes the same Holy Ghost yeah and you know enemy maybe maybe I'm wrong enough I'm sorry baby I have a hard time with somebody talking about you know having the Holy Ghost and then denying the word how I mean how does that work I mean I have our time with that if you can't accept the if you can't accept what the scripture says then how then how does the word deny the word and you know what it just breaks my heart really I mean it just you know it just something just rises up inside of me up but you know it's so hard to say these people do this and it's just you know and it's it's not that you get angry at people you can't get angry at people you know there's there's some people that you know you know you know sometimes you think well I just get a hold of news but you know that they know one thing you'll find out is you know if you get a hold you could you could meet somebody all day long and the only thing you get is tired you're not going to change them but see the thing is is you know I think I'm thankful that I have a past and I thought my god I have the passenger that I do but you know people people are well you know they want to shun all that and then all of the other ones that I thought was interesting was this man he listened he was he's like what do they have the powerful ministry have to quote brother branham all the time that quote brother branham all the time and I was like well what we didn't think I told my said hey yeah if the thought come to my mind you know what we ought to do is then if we want to get really talented and we don't only use the brother drowned in the the message will quote brother drowned hey let's not quote the Bible either we're just preach and then we're not doing nothing we could have real skill then yeah and this is like that only makes sense it's like do people actually listen you know do they actually read what they're putting up you know really worth or talking about so how is it that we're not if you know well I guess Paul should've done well hey good how was the one that was talking about took the Old Testament was preaching out the Old Testament showed what the types and everything I mean there's so many in the Old Testament that Brad Brown said that the Prophet said came they took they took what was said prior to them and they they were looking back to those prophets Daniel was there and he said you know I understood by books he was looking back to what was already written all the ones that were looking back brother Branham you know one of the things that lots of times you'll find brother Brennan and I think is interesting that in certain messages you'll notice that brother Brown goes back to the old testament you know Paul when he preached Paul took the Old Testament and brought it into the New Testament but lots of times you'll see brother Brown he'll go back to the Old Testament and then he'll bring it right into the New Testament show you exactly the way Paul was bringing things and then you'll bring it into our day bringing tying it all together but you know some people say well you know they don't want they don't want to quote brother Randall that's like well what do we poke you know what we use it I mean it's not the preaching is not just to get up and just quote brother Randall more read brother Branham you know but you know that's the basis for what we believed we're not if we're not gonna use the Bible if we're not going to use the message of what are we gonna use we're just gonna use our own minds well we oh well we all have our own Mazda all have our own opinions some place that you're going to have a top post to put down and then show what you believe and actually from where you believe in start front but you know we all have to have that place that we come to we all have to have a at our post you come to a replacement yeah for me that you know leave the scripture we find coming coming to that rest and your brother Brown was speaking this is from the the queen of the south and brother Browns speaking of gentleman you know he was talking about Jonah being in a bad ship in bed he said he was in critical shape they said there's nobody here in this tabernacle that bad off tonight he was in the belly of the whale and he said if you look this way it was Wells belly everywhere he looked it was well the belly he said they are lying Vanity's he said once more while I look to your holy temple he said for he know that when Solomon dedicated the temple when he prayed he said lord if thought people would be in trouble anywhere and look toward this holy temple and pray then you hear from heaven and he believed the prayer of Solomon when he answered so God made that sick fish turn right around and taking Jonah to the landing now if Jonah under those circumstances could look to a temple that was built by a man Solomon that later Baxley the earthly temple and a prayer of an ordinary man and God could do a miracle like that for him how much more can he do for you and I when we refuse to look at our condition and once more while I look to the Holy Temple where Jesus sits at the right hand of the Majesty on high making intercession upon our confession amen how can we look at a symptom I look at Jesus not what this looks like but what that said look at Calvary look what a price was paid for person comes in I'm too low down brother Brent Oh God never saved me don't look how bad you are look how good he is don't ever look at yourself look at him he said the priest never did see the one that the sacrifice was made for you know and of all the things you know that earthly tabernacle that Solomon built you know they could turn toward that but you how much more perfect distant temple the sacrifice that was made for us how much perfect how perfect it is you know that we can turn to it and not look at our symptoms but we can look at look to him and receive what we have neato because he's there to receive you know for us what we have need of but the thing is is do we allow him to have access brother Ellis was speaking here he was speaking of the lamb and the dove he said you know the dove wants to come and the dove is to be the one that leads he said but if you try to go your own way if you try to do your own thing he said the double departs but he said the dope comes and stays if you allow him to leave if you don't try to go your own way if you allow him to do the leading then he can lead you and guide you where you need to be were you ought to be and so he's there and we will allow him to do what he wants to do for us if we get out of if we get out of the way you know it's you know we hear a lot of ministers and even even I've said it you you know there's a gift in your life but the gift is to get out of the way and let God speak well you know that's also the same way in receiving it's us to get out of the way so God can speak to us you know rather endless was coconut in the message door and doors and door to the heart you know he talks about inviting somebody you know if you'd open the door to invite somebody in your brother man refers to and they says you know if you invited me into your house you know they said you know I don't kick my shoes off I'm getting the refrigerator get me something to eat you know have a seat drink drink a soft drink or whatever you don't they make myself at home and you know and just and just have freedom well you know what the Holy Spirit can't do anything if we don't allow him that free you know you know brother Graham said you know how many people would be welcome to your house if you know you just tell you come in the house but stand right next to you guys stay right here by the front door don't go move from this bump right here you know that's ridiculous you know if you had somebody come in they just stood right beside your front door they never went anywhere else they just stood right there and you know they start moving around stay right there but if we allow if we don't allow the Holy Spirit to freedom to move and do what needs to be done and sometimes sometimes you know maybe maybe sometimes in our lives we don't realize that we have things up that's in our lives that become a problem here sometimes it takes as well always with bigger weights they're not about praying you know we want to do the talking when we when we pray but prater having a prayer life is really having communion it's you know you know it's not having a time where you have somebody do all the talkin you know and there's people and I'm like I might get in trouble for saying this but my mom wouldn't want I'll talk about my mom she's really good about asking a question but you don't get in time to answer the question because you asked the question and she'll keep on talking and then shall I ask you the question again well if you ever give somebody the chance to answer it's kind of hard to hear didn't you like flat you know she asks the question again it's like well if you don't pause it's kind of hard for me to get in there dancing the question if sometimes you know when we talk to God you know make it trouble for that because that's all take them that's all right I've been in trouble before but you know if we don't we won't talk to God but if we don't pause to let God talk to us that how do we know what God's trying to say that is you know it's kind of funny means they're not we were I had to work late study how we do making Turks well we were at the house and we were watching the service and there were things that brother beau Lewis was saying and it was so funny because we were pointing at each other me and Sarah the boys brought us in their home near say certain things who lives life but you know sometimes when we hear those things it's not that's pointing the fingers over butts that's free Hebrew no space for us because you know that's God speaking to us are we do we allow him that time you know sometimes I always was saying you know wait there's some you know for a lot of people get all this you know the song was written sweet hour of prayer is like well maybe if we add up all the time in the week we might be preached an hour you know they might take ten weeks I don't know but you know if we don't if we won't speak to God that it takes communion not just praying because lots of times people think praying is just we're speaking to God well then you know the problem is you got to wait for a response right you go wait for him to talk back to you give me time sometimes it's it's best to just go and just sit there and not say things or fake things but just you know ask though or what what is it that he wants us to say you know sometimes I'll make a meal and I brother Brazil says you know sometimes when God waits you ever know or not he wants to talk to you sometimes in the middle of night when I wake up you know sometimes that's what I do I sit there lord do you wake me up because you won't talk to me and I sitting there and you know I've I've had there's been times when I've been there and you just I'm just laying in bed awake as I'll order you you want to speak to me and you know there's been times when people have come on my mind to pray floor and I start praying for and then some in time in the in the future you know within a week or whatever sometimes you hear about that person and they have a need and then you know you realize that God was speaking to you because you were to pray for that person because they have a need here sometimes I go you know sometimes we fail to realize it and I've had the opportunity I go through things I'm all option you know you get down you get beat up you're getting despondent whatever and you know the thought that's coming to my mind you people are praying for me [Music] and you know that it's like you know what I've got people interceding for me you know even sometimes you feel like you can't MC for yourself but you know there's people out there to pray for you that love you and you know they it's really good I think God well somebody sends you a text message or whatever unless you know how I've been thinking about you and praying for you hope everything's going good or when you're sick and they find out that you're sick or whatever people call and let you know that they're praying for you sometimes you know we don't realize how blessed we are right we miss out because we're now available to block us and hindrance but you know we're overcomers god bless you this one [Music] well this sums 37 verse 1 says frettin up thyself because of evildoers neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity for they shall soon be cut down like the grass and wither as the green artery trust in the Lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land then verily thou shalt be fed delight thyself also in the Lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart commit my way unto the Lord Trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass [Music]
