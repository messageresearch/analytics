[0:00] be seated
[0:09] right
[0:14] God bless you all this morning
[0:18] amen if the brothers can go to get that
[0:20] pulled up and
[0:21] we'll start with a word of Prayer
[0:24] precious Lord Jesus we thank you Father

[0:35] certainly speak to our hearts Lord Jesus
[0:37] and Lord I pray you just um meet every
[0:39] need Lord bless your people this morning
[0:41] Lord help me and just guide me Lord to
[0:43] get what you'd have me to get across
[0:45] Lord I pray we commit the rest of the
[0:47] service into your hands in Jesus
[0:48] Christ's name amen
[0:50] praise the Lord
[0:52] amen so Financial Jubilee Port part five
[0:57] we're on our way
[0:58] and um amen hopefully you're making
[1:01] progress by the grace of the Lord Jesus
[1:05] and the thought this morning just
[1:07] fighting to believe you know and this
[1:09] has been just on my heart
[1:11] you know fighting to believe
[1:13] Brotherton go to the next one
[1:16] and um Every Time I Think of financial
[1:19] Jubilee and the word Jubilee it says um
[1:22] the Year of Jubilee that when all slaves
[1:24] and prisoners as they were been taken
[1:26] and they were in bondage no matter how
[1:28] long they've been in bondage or long or
[1:30] how long they were supposed to stay
[1:32] there when the year come of Jubilee when
[1:34] the trumpet sounded every man could go
[1:36] free if he wanted to go free
[1:39] amen and certainly that Jubilee has
[1:42] sounded that trumpet I think the word of
[1:44] God we know that word of God is that
[1:46] Jubilee and that has sounded long time
[1:48] ago long time ago you know this word of
[1:52] course has been around for we know uh
[1:55] centuries you know way before our birth
[1:57] God sent a prophet before my birth so
[2:00] that Jubilee trumpet has sounded and of
[2:02] course when we talk about financial
[2:03] Jubilee to me it's just a little model
[2:05] it's like a map that we can all use but
[2:08] again we want to apply that to all areas
[2:09] of our life but it's just a little map
[2:11] that you can bring up and kind of say
[2:13] okay what am I doing in this area you
[2:16] know and then again apply that
[2:17] spiritually so everything we talk about
[2:19] can be applied spiritually and again we
[2:22] got the word we got this trumpet I mean
[2:25] in the bible you know it's so many
[2:27] things on finances that's been there and
[2:29] like I said you know when I lost all
[2:31] that money years ago trying to do
[2:32] business trying to do all this stuff and
[2:34] I was like I said I was paying my tithes
[2:36] and I started saying Lord God what's
[2:38] going on what is happening I think I'm
[2:40] doing everything right and I just didn't
[2:43] know within that word it was so much
[2:45] that was there before I was born and
[2:48] guess what that word was there before
[2:49] anyone was born in this room so it's
[2:52] been here so the question we got to say
[2:54] you know if if we got this trumpet that
[2:56] sounded and we can go free and again
[2:58] again apply this spiritually as well we
[3:00] got these promises all these things that
[3:02] are here we got a prophet that has come
[3:04] and gone
[3:05] why is it a challenge for us to go free
[3:08] why is it a challenge for us our
[3:10] families our children to be free let's
[3:12] say financially
[3:14] and then think spiritually as well but
[3:16] why so I you know the question would be
[3:18] why is it hard to go free why would a
[3:20] slave if a jubilee trumpet sound
[3:24] they would be difficult for them to go
[3:26] free
[3:27] well if I would ask okay if we were in
[3:29] slavery let's say for example and we
[3:31] said okay the trumpet saying you can go
[3:32] free but why is there a if if
[3:35] well a couple things will come to mind
[3:38] and say well obviously we could be too
[3:39] comfortable
[3:40] like hey you know what
[3:43] mass is doing a pretty good job taking
[3:44] care of me
[3:46] you know MasterCard let's throw that out
[3:48] there doing a pretty good job taking
[3:49] care of me you know what I mean
[3:52] I it does good
[3:54] when I need something it gives me
[3:56] something
[3:57] you know what I'm saying so you got that
[3:59] it's too comfortable I don't want to go
[4:01] out there on my own and really work for
[4:03] it and really save and do all those
[4:06] things it's just so easy to go in and
[4:08] get what provision they're giving me
[4:10] could be too hard
[4:12] because it's too much or you could also
[4:15] just not believe that you're free you
[4:17] know I just it's just too difficult
[4:19] so some of that come to it you get
[4:22] scared you know you and you really come
[4:24] down to it as I said fighting to believe
[4:26] sometimes you just don't want to fight
[4:28] too comfortable and you just don't want
[4:29] to fight for it you don't want to fight
[4:30] we don't want to fight for these
[4:32] promises and fight for this word fight
[4:34] to be financially free again these
[4:36] promises all these things have been here
[4:37] before my birth
[4:39] but they're there
[4:41] so you know when I look at all these
[4:42] deep things that we talk about you know
[4:44] and as I said before is this you know
[4:45] money to me is a shallow shallow area of
[4:49] course it's shallow but it can get very
[4:51] deep
[4:52] but you know we have a lot of shallow
[4:54] water problems you know in our families
[4:56] you know in our situations you know and
[4:59] even in the Deep even if you go into the
[5:01] deep you know this came in my heart this
[5:03] morning our Prophet you know he went
[5:05] into the deep and he was in the deep but
[5:07] he had to come back down and sell his
[5:09] boat through those shallow Waters
[5:10] dealing with his kids for example Billy
[5:12] Paul smoking cigarettes I mean he had to
[5:15] come right down his son running out
[5:16] there and getting married and all these
[5:18] things that he had to deal with his
[5:19] daughter up there playing rock and roll
[5:21] music his wife having a hard time with
[5:23] Joseph at home you know and she slams
[5:25] the door you know and he said I can
[5:27] handle that ain't no problem to me God
[5:28] said no no you need to go take care of
[5:30] some things so it's like he was deep but
[5:33] he had to go right back and sail through
[5:35] those things and come back out and then
[5:36] come back out and see demons and all
[5:38] kinds of things deep Waters
[5:40] so my so if he had to go through that
[5:43] and we are facing things like that then
[5:45] we have to know how to navigate in these
[5:47] shallow Waters and not get stuck
[5:51] go to the next slide
[5:53] he says now you take on a stream like
[5:55] the stream of life and plenty of
[5:58] Driftwood hanging up in every trash pile
[6:00] and yet the boat comes along made out of
[6:03] wood too but if you notice the wood is
[6:06] made and shaped out by a master who has
[6:08] built the boat not only is it shaped out
[6:11] but it is Guided by the master and is
[6:14] pushed by a power and if this certain
[6:16] little craft that's been made different
[6:18] and been crafted out by the Master's
[6:20] Hand should ever get ever stick in some
[6:23] weeds along and shallow Waters there is
[6:26] a power behind it a little bolt that the
[6:28] master can turn on and push us out into
[6:30] the deep Waters again amen so I just saw
[6:33] that you know that shallow Waters and I
[6:35] think that's what happens in our journey
[6:36] you know we get stuck in these weeds
[6:39] along in Shallow waters you know and
[6:41] those things impact Our Lives as I said
[6:43] last time knowing you know song service
[6:44] and thinking about my parents and you
[6:47] know we were raised in a Christian home
[6:48] and hey we didn't have a TV we had
[6:51] devotions we had Bible time you know
[6:53] know we had that at night our family had
[6:55] a lot of potential let me tell you we
[6:57] had a lot of potential but it still did
[7:00] not go according to plan you know my mom
[7:03] and dad as you know they ended up
[7:04] getting separated and divorced and a lot
[7:06] of things and all of us kids just went
[7:07] it happened you know and I look at that
[7:11] and I said my goodness what happened and
[7:13] I applied it to my own life and that's
[7:14] why Financial Jubilee means so much to
[7:16] me because I said wow I I didn't know
[7:17] some things and then I figured out some
[7:19] things by the grace of God in his word
[7:21] marriage is in this Bible all these
[7:23] things are there to help us in these
[7:25] shallow Waters so we don't get stuck but
[7:28] there's something that we're missing and
[7:30] I believe that falls to fighting to
[7:33] believe and I think you'll see that as
[7:34] we we go through this
[7:36] go to the next slide
[7:39] and that's the way it is with human life
[7:41] you can't play the rules of the game of
[7:42] Life wrong and expect to win
[7:45] you gotta play according to God's word
[7:47] and the purpose that you were brought
[7:49] here for man that alone says a whole lot
[7:52] you know you can't play this game in
[7:54] your marriage in your home in your
[7:57] finances and everything and certainly
[7:59] not in these deep promises that we have
[8:01] how we're going to win you we can't win
[8:04] if we don't play according to the rules
[8:06] and certainly The Game of Life is a
[8:08] wonderful game I love playing it you
[8:10] know and every time we bring it out I
[8:12] gotta get the rules out and decide okay
[8:14] how much money they get you know um and
[8:17] they have some choices you know we got
[8:19] to make first when you first start off
[8:20] with like do you go to college or do you
[8:23] go and get a job and start and that's
[8:25] how the Game of Life played and then
[8:26] along the road you pick up kids and all
[8:28] kind of things
[8:29] and that certainly is what happened we
[8:30] got a marriage today a wonderful couple
[8:33] that's starting out that Journey you
[8:35] know and um but the only way they're
[8:37] going to win they got to play according
[8:39] to the rules and the only way we're
[8:40] going to win you know and I figured out
[8:42] I said my goodness you know when is my
[8:43] marriage at a point that is sealed I
[8:45] realize until I get out of here
[8:48] it's a lifetime Journey
[8:50] I'm not gonna take it for granted you
[8:53] know and I know until we get out of here
[8:55] we're on that Journey so I don't take my
[8:57] wife for granted I'm always working and
[9:00] trying my best to get better to learn to
[9:02] grow to fight for it to fight for it you
[9:06] know and I certainly I look at my
[9:07] parents and those some of the things
[9:08] that they they didn't know how to fight
[9:09] the rules were there they were there
[9:11] they had plans they had Playbook and
[9:13] that's why we have to stay in the word
[9:14] every day read your Bible pray stay in
[9:17] it apply it to the areas of your life
[9:19] that you're going through you know if
[9:21] you need certain vegetables certain
[9:22] vitamins you take those certain things
[9:23] in the same way you know if you've got
[9:25] financial problems you got money
[9:27] problems you got marriage problems you
[9:28] got word problem you got understanding
[9:29] problems hey look for that vitamin that
[9:31] word and apply it to your life amen
[9:35] so certainly and now there are so many
[9:37] people that doesn't seem to have any
[9:38] kind of purpose in life especially in
[9:40] this day that we now and people just
[9:41] seem to think that they can all they
[9:44] have to do is keep up with someone else
[9:45] with the Fashions of this world with the
[9:47] enticements of this world
[9:49] that the world has given to them and oh
[9:51] my the devil he has that laid out for us
[9:53] for sure you know just all we can just
[9:55] keep up with the next person even in the
[9:57] church anywhere we sometimes set our
[10:00] Target just for that person well I'm
[10:01] doing a little bit better than them you
[10:03] know I got some money in the bank and I
[10:04] got some debt so I think I'm all right
[10:06] I'm better than that person who only has
[10:07] debt you know I'm doing pretty good you
[10:10] know we tell ourselves that you know and
[10:12] all these influences and things like
[10:14] that that there to to trap us to pull us
[10:17] you know I mean you can't even talk
[10:20] nowadays without thinking about the the
[10:21] impact of social media on us and our
[10:24] children our families it's just really
[10:26] devastating but all it does is set that
[10:28] Mark to okay if I could just keep up
[10:30] with someone else if I'm doing a little
[10:31] bit better than them a little bit more
[10:32] exciting than them then I'm doing all
[10:35] right that's not the marker it's the
[10:37] rule book this is what we have to do we
[10:40] got to play it according to this
[10:42] so we're going to run real quick through
[10:43] some of the principles again that's in
[10:45] this Playbook that's in this plan that's
[10:47] been here
[10:49] go to the next slide
[10:50] so some of the principles that's in the
[10:52] word God owns it all remember that it's
[10:55] all his so he's given you what he wants
[10:58] to give you he can give you more if you
[11:00] want to and give you less if he wants to
[11:02] he's given you all that he wants to give
[11:04] you
[11:05] 10 is his and a 90 it's his he just
[11:08] wants to see how you're going to manage
[11:10] that
[11:11] you got to be diligent that's period
[11:14] it's not your resources is his now
[11:17] diligent you've got to be organized and
[11:19] that's in the way you can be organized
[11:21] write things down write it down on a
[11:23] napkin a plate whatever you do whatever
[11:26] you have to do it just write some things
[11:28] down get a little bit organized if you
[11:30] got debt lists those things from the
[11:32] smallest to the largest just list them
[11:34] put something on your fridge okay I got
[11:36] to take care of this try just keep
[11:38] moving in that direction
[11:40] the Bible says the hand of the diligent
[11:42] shall bear rule the hand of the diligent
[11:45] if we're going to rule in these great
[11:46] things and have speaking power and all
[11:49] this stuff that we're promised
[11:51] man we got to be able to rule a dollar
[11:52] we have to be able to rule that thing
[11:55] by the grace of God money is your time
[11:58] you purchase stuff with your time
[12:00] learning to wait again that's very
[12:03] important we'll spend a little time on
[12:04] that as well learning to wait that is uh
[12:07] more than important especially for our
[12:10] younger generation it's extremely
[12:11] strange extremely difficult difficult
[12:13] for us older ones as well but certainly
[12:15] for the younger generation it is it is
[12:18] detrimental it's just um the devil knows
[12:20] what to do to make it almost impossible
[12:22] to to wait
[12:23] the next
[12:25] principle number five avoid debt
[12:27] remember the blessings of the Lord that
[12:29] maketh the rich he had is no sorrow to
[12:31] it you remember in the word of God God
[12:33] promised the the Israelites he said hey
[12:36] blessings and curse if you obey God's
[12:39] word he said look you won't be borrowing
[12:42] from anybody that's what he told them
[12:44] naturally that's what he told him he
[12:46] said you're going to be the one lending
[12:47] you won't need to borrow from these
[12:49] Heathen Nations around you that's what
[12:51] he told him is it different for us
[12:53] is it well that's the question it can
[12:57] seem challenging it can seem like well
[12:58] maybe that is a little different for us
[13:00] but is it
[13:01] very important
[13:03] but we know God discourages debt we know
[13:05] that's in the word
[13:07] save a little
[13:08] you're going to get older just apply
[13:11] these things directly to my life my
[13:13] father's 84 years old he was the hardest
[13:15] working man I knew in my life my dad
[13:17] never slept in ever I never see my dad
[13:20] sleeping
[13:21] four o'clock five o'clock he was up out
[13:24] the door gone to work every single day
[13:28] but he didn't know how to save
[13:29] you know he told me early on when he
[13:31] started finding out that I could save he
[13:33] knew about some of my money problems and
[13:35] a little bit after that I started saving
[13:36] he said my John you know I had a cousin
[13:39] that could save I didn't know how to
[13:40] save
[13:41] wow dad man I didn't know that either
[13:44] but I see the impact it had on his life
[13:47] you know he's not that young man anymore
[13:48] so it's a lot of struggles a lot of
[13:51] challenges when if he could have put a
[13:53] little bit away when he was younger he
[13:55] would have reached this stage a little
[13:56] bit different
[13:57] so save a little bit
[13:59] the best principle giving we know that
[14:02] given to the kingdom of God managing
[14:04] your resources to a point that you can
[14:05] give it's more blessed to give than
[14:07] receive and learning to be content we
[14:09] talked about that last time as well
[14:11] contentment
[14:12] next quote
[14:14] this very every time I talk about
[14:15] financial Jubilee this just pops in my
[14:17] heart it just is just a challenge to all
[14:20] of us again we got the word we got the
[14:22] prophet now notice what he said this is
[14:24] 1965. many of you probably were younger
[14:26] some of you weren't born but he's saying
[14:29] this clean your lives up pay your debts
[14:32] oh no man Jesus said get all things off
[14:35] your hands get everything right Make
[14:38] Ready Get Ready remember in the name of
[14:42] the Lord something is fixing to happen
[14:45] my my this was 1965.
[14:49] so many of you again were younger I was
[14:52] born after this time but this has been
[14:54] here our Prophet that God sent to us
[14:57] said get everything right clean up your
[14:59] lives make ready
[15:01] are we ready
[15:03] you know so we asked the question why is
[15:05] our lives not cleaned up to that point
[15:07] is everything right
[15:09] well by God's grace we're striving we're
[15:11] striving No Doubt but certainly take
[15:13] that to heart and remember that our
[15:15] Prophet had brought that to us and now
[15:17] we can take that and apply that he's
[15:20] telling you pay your debts off oh no man
[15:23] get all these things off of your hand
[15:26] Make Ready Get Ready
[15:29] so we got all these precious promises
[15:31] but we have to be ready by the grace of
[15:33] almighty God
[15:36] now we're going to see what what what is
[15:38] going on you know why just think about
[15:41] money why is it so hard to say I have
[15:44] good conversations at home of course
[15:45] with younger kids and an adult child
[15:47] coming along and the whole mind they
[15:51] know so much now with the internet they
[15:52] can Google you know what I mean like hey
[15:55] is it a way you can do this or that and
[15:58] this and Daddy's old school trying to
[16:00] bring it slow and it's like man dead you
[16:03] know but
[16:04] if you do this daddy you can do that
[16:08] and we just have these good
[16:09] conversations at the point I'm like all
[16:11] right
[16:12] you're an adult child
[16:13] [Laughter]
[16:15] let's watch
[16:18] and then that is really key you know and
[16:20] sometimes us parents were trying to say
[16:22] these things but I was talking to her
[16:24] brother in the parking lot the other day
[16:25] you know I said hey John it's it's not
[16:26] me it's not daddy's opinion it's God's
[16:30] word it is not what I'm saying man if
[16:32] I'm I'm like you John I would be doing
[16:34] this or that too but God's word The
[16:37] Playbook The Playbook
[16:40] so we look at Israel we look at them and
[16:42] what our prophecy said God gave them go
[16:45] to the next slide Brothers
[16:46] he said um now remember God gave them
[16:50] the land down in Egypt said the land is
[16:52] yours every bit of it now the people
[16:55] today are expecting now watch that word
[16:57] expecting God to reach down get them by
[17:00] the neck and say yes that's right you
[17:02] bring me out clean me up heal me and
[17:04] I'll believe you God doesn't do his
[17:06] business that way he gives you the
[17:09] promise but you have got to fight for
[17:12] every inch of ground that you possess
[17:15] period that is set in the tone that's
[17:18] why fighting to believe he's telling you
[17:21] hey God give you all these promises oh
[17:24] debt Freedom Financial Jubilee precious
[17:27] promises all these great promises but
[17:31] he's saying God don't run his business
[17:33] that way he's not going to just hand it
[17:35] to you you're gonna have to fight for it
[17:37] our kids are going to have to fight
[17:39] you're going to have to fight you're
[17:40] going to have to be prayerful in
[17:42] fighting this thing through you're gonna
[17:43] have to fight for your marriage you're
[17:45] gonna have to fight for your finances
[17:46] you're gonna have to fight for this word
[17:47] you're gonna have to fight for these
[17:49] precious promises but we got to believe
[17:51] because he already said it's ours he
[17:53] said it as we know II Peter which we
[17:56] know here by the grace of God we many
[17:58] times we're born whereby are given unto
[18:01] us exceeding great and precious promises
[18:03] I put that exactly what brother Brenham
[18:06] said he gives a promise but you have got
[18:09] to fight for it amen that we can be
[18:12] partakers of the divine nature have an
[18:14] escape the corruption that is in the
[18:16] world through lust so we see right there
[18:18] we got to fight I wish it was not that
[18:21] but it is that that means it's not
[18:24] coming to us easy my brothers and
[18:26] sisters none of this but we got the
[18:28] promise we can start there Lord you got
[18:31] the promise so Lord I'm gonna take that
[18:33] and that's where I'm going to start I
[18:35] can have a blessed home I can have a
[18:36] blessed marriage I can be financially
[18:38] free I can take on these promises and
[18:40] have enough character to possess them by
[18:43] the grace of the Lord Jesus go to the
[18:45] next slide
[18:46] so I want to just kind of look back a
[18:47] little bit on Joshua and Caleb versus
[18:49] the 10 spies because they were given
[18:52] these promises of that promised land
[18:54] okay and we see we got two sides we got
[18:57] two people that's standing up you know
[18:59] one person is saying hey as Caleb Still
[19:01] the people and said let us go now we can
[19:02] go this is ours we can possess it it's
[19:05] what we are well able to overcome so I
[19:09] can stand here financially free and say
[19:10] hey we are well able to take Financial
[19:13] Jubilee same thing applied to the
[19:15] promises we're well able we're more than
[19:18] able it's not even a question of whether
[19:20] we're able or not we're more than able
[19:22] but the next verse but but the men that
[19:27] went up with him said we be not able to
[19:30] go up against the people for they are
[19:32] stronger than we
[19:33] yeah they're like no it's impossible you
[19:37] know when I stood there and I'm taken
[19:38] into context everything we talk about
[19:39] you know we think well those ten no we
[19:42] are in ourselves all of that within our
[19:45] soul we get we're born again we have the
[19:47] Joshua and Caleb the Holy Spirit there
[19:50] but in that Spirit brim see taste feel
[19:53] smelling here that's those 10 spies that
[19:55] come right back along
[19:57] you started saving but it's not this is
[19:59] too hard
[20:00] I ain't gonna never reach it I can't do
[20:03] it you know what I mean them Giants too
[20:05] big
[20:05] if I want that car for 30 000 I just
[20:08] it's just that's how our kids feel I
[20:10] know I talked to my son he believe me
[20:12] you feel like it no that's a big giant
[20:14] dad
[20:15] um
[20:16] it's impossible no it's not no it's not
[20:20] impossible by the grace of God and
[20:22] that's anything and all these promises
[20:23] that we have here as well it's not
[20:25] impossible for us to possess all of
[20:27] these characteristics all of these
[20:29] virtues about the grace of the Lord
[20:31] amen but we have to be willing to to
[20:34] fight through that and you know during
[20:37] that fight it was something I mean those
[20:39] 10 spies they got the people all messed
[20:42] up is the Bible says they cried all
[20:44] night The People cried all night like uh
[20:48] what are they talking about it's
[20:49] impossible uh you know got to the point
[20:52] that they wanted to Stone Joshua and
[20:54] Caleb so you think about the Battle we
[20:56] can have in our own selves your soul and
[20:58] that Spirit realm telling you you can't
[20:59] that Soul saying you can do this we
[21:01] can't overcome that Spirit man like no
[21:04] is impossible and that can put you where
[21:06] you're crying all night crying all night
[21:08] over the problems the issues and the
[21:10] things that we're facing as if we don't
[21:12] have precious promises
[21:15] my my mind go to the next
[21:18] so we're going to spend a little time
[21:19] with Joshua because I think this kind of
[21:21] sets the tone of these promises that we
[21:24] have financially spiritually in every
[21:27] Factor God promised them he said every
[21:29] place that the soul of your foot will
[21:31] thread will tread I have given it to you
[21:33] as I said to Moses no man shall be able
[21:35] to stand before you all the days of your
[21:37] life as I was with Moses so I will be
[21:39] with you I will not leave you nor
[21:41] forsake you my mama and do we believe we
[21:44] have those same promises amen go to the
[21:47] next
[21:48] now this way it starts changing it up on
[21:51] a little bit now that's like me inviting
[21:52] you to my house and like I got so many
[21:54] things for y'all y'all come over I got
[21:56] whoa y'all gonna be so excited I'm Gonna

[21:59] Life

[22:02] when I'm gonna come I'm gonna come to
[22:04] this weekend I'm gonna be there
[22:05] and then I start saying but be strong
[22:11] and you'll be like well
[22:13] and make sure you have some good courage
[22:16] well next week not gonna work brother
[22:17] John um
[22:19] yeah
[22:21] so you see he started to say yeah you
[22:23] got all these promises but um all of a
[22:27] sudden
[22:27] now yeah you got this inheritance of the
[22:30] land and I swear to your fathers to give
[22:32] you and here he goes again yeah come on
[22:35] over
[22:35] only be strong and very courageous
[22:39] she's like John what
[22:41] what you giving me brother
[22:43] I thought it was a gift you know that
[22:46] ain't that sounded very worrisome
[22:49] that I may be able to do all according
[22:52] to the law which Moses my servant gave
[22:53] commanded you that's okay that's okay
[22:55] come on in
[22:57] sorry it's all right do not turn from
[23:00] the right hand or to the left hand that
[23:02] you may Prosper whether you go now he's
[23:04] setting some some plan go to the next
[23:05] slide and we'll try to wrap up or wrap
[23:07] it up pretty close the book of the law
[23:09] shall not depart from your mouth but you
[23:10] shall meditate it day and night that you
[23:12] may observe to do according to all
[23:14] that's written in for then will you make
[23:16] your way prosperous have I not I
[23:18] commanded you be strong and of good
[23:19] courage look how you're just putting
[23:20] that in do not be afraid do norbitus
[23:23] made Mama those are some strong words
[23:26] that word dismayed I looked that up and
[23:28] it just means my don't be shocked things
[23:30] are not going to work out the way you
[23:31] expect don't be shocked and stunned and
[23:34] Frozen and like oh what happened Oh my
[23:36] he said don't be dismayed because that's
[23:39] what's going to be on the journey you're
[23:40] going to run into some obstacles they're
[23:42] going to be some things that will shock
[23:43] you and make you say well my are these
[23:45] promises really true is it really true
[23:49] so those are the things we got to watch
[23:50] out not to be dismayed and we can be in
[23:52] dismayed for a long period of time
[23:54] believe me not knowing why is this not
[23:56] working out the way I thought maybe it's
[23:58] not true uh all these things and that
[24:00] happens to us
[24:02] so don't be dismayed go to the next
[24:06] so key as we're wrapping up it's fight
[24:09] fight fight brothers and sisters that's
[24:10] what it is it's fight fight fight but
[24:13] Josh Moses and Joshua the Israelite had
[24:15] to fight for every inch of ground they
[24:17] got and every promise in the book is
[24:19] yours but God will never give it to you
[24:22] and you lay back on your bed of ease
[24:24] you'll fight for every inch you get
[24:27] that's it fight for every inch my look
[24:31] at this quote he lays out things is
[24:32] handed to you that's what the matter
[24:34] with the American people tonight you got
[24:35] everything handed to you well fed
[24:37] fattened clothed and everything else so
[24:39] I know the devil's job boy if he can get
[24:41] us to a point where we don't know how to
[24:42] fight
[24:43] we don't want to fight then he'll do
[24:46] that he'll set that in you can't hold on
[24:49] so we're not seeing God work in these
[24:51] shallow areas of our life to get enough
[24:55] training inspiration
[24:58] experience to look at these big things
[25:00] and say Yes Lord I can conquer them
[25:03] so that fighting my brothers and sisters
[25:05] is so strategic it's so God is prayerful
[25:10] it's everything that we know but you
[25:13] gotta fight it's not going to be handed
[25:15] to us it's not
[25:17] but I know for sure you know if we can
[25:19] stand by the grace of God and just
[25:21] practice that's why I think Jubilee is
[25:22] just Financial Jubilee it's just an area
[25:24] to practice it's little weights that you
[25:25] can just practice hold out if you don't
[25:27] have the money hold out hold out a
[25:29] little bit ask God to help me Lord this
[25:31] is what I desire you promise to give me
[25:33] my desires Lord but I don't want my
[25:35] master to have it give it to me
[25:37] Lord God if I have to maybe you know not
[25:40] eat those extra cheeseburgers or get you
[25:42] know small size fries this time you know
[25:44] what I mean or get this smaller Meal
[25:45] instead of spend ten dollars I'm gonna
[25:47] spend five dollars or because I'm
[25:48] working on this plan and watch God come
[25:51] in and start working as you're working
[25:53] you get experience from that like wow he
[25:55] did Supply he did Supply so then when we
[25:58] hit these harder promises these higher
[26:01] things we can say yes God I remember you
[26:03] did this for me didn't David do that he
[26:06] said but bear you know a lion Lord I so
[26:09] who is Goliath who is Goliath Lord if I
[26:13] wanted something great Lord I believe
[26:14] you can supply my need
[26:16] but you know if I need that so I'm going
[26:18] to you first Lord is that something for
[26:19] me or do you want that not to be for me
[26:21] because you will give me the desires of
[26:23] my heart if I'm delighting your word
[26:25] so I'm leave you with these couple tips
[26:27] on fighting just in that same scripture
[26:28] and then we'll call it
[26:30] the musicians can get ready to come up
[26:32] so fighting this is what he laid out be
[26:36] strong and of good courage now courage
[26:38] oh my good courage you did probably
[26:40] didn't pause the thing why did he say
[26:42] good courage because there's bad courage
[26:43] you can be courageous like you know what
[26:45] I am going to go talk to that loan
[26:47] officer I'm gonna do it I'm courageous

[27:34] according to the rules play according to
[27:36] the rules stay in the word meditate it
[27:39] day and night you gotta know to play
