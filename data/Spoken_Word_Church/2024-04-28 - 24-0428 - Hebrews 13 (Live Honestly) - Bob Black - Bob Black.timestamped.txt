[0:00] could be in the house of the
[0:02] Lord and missed y all we had a good time
[0:06] traveling over the last few days let's
[0:09] see get
[0:15] this hopefully we can get that up on the
[0:18] screen let's just go the Lord in prayer
[0:20] Lord God we're so grateful to be able to
[0:21] gather together today Lord around your
[0:23] word Lord bless us Lord as we walk
[0:25] through these scriptures Lord Jesus make
[0:27] them alive and real to us be with us
[0:28] today Lord bless our worship and our
[0:31] fellowship together we pray in your name
[0:35] amen so we're we're uh I'm I'm going see
[0:39] if I can wrap up the book of Hebrews
[0:41] today we will see I'm optimistic
[0:45] um Proverbs so what we're getting toward
[0:48] is is where Paul's talking about um that
[0:50] we trust we have a good conscience and
[0:52] in all things willing to live honestly
[0:54] and I just kind of been meditating on
[0:56] honesty and what that means and in
[0:58] Proverbs 286 there's that scripture that
[1:01] says better is the poor that walketh in
[1:03] his uprightness than he that is perverse
[1:05] in his ways though he be rich so really
[1:09] what uh the scripture is saying here in
[1:11] this case is that uh to to live a life
[1:14] of integrity and honesty where people
[1:17] are can trust you and can trust your
[1:19] word is more important more it's it's
[1:21] like more precious than than uh than
[1:25] having a lot of money or really anything
[1:27] else um to be able to be Trust trusted
[1:31] what a what a blessing in life that
[1:32] would be to to look back and and and and
[1:35] have confidence that people can trust
[1:36] you and and to trust others now look
[1:39] what so we'll we'll take a quick step
[1:41] back before in in verse 13 17 before we
[1:44] go to verse 18 so Paul says here and all
[1:48] through that chapter in Hebrews 13 He
[1:50] just reiterates over and over remember
[1:53] those that are trying to help you with
[1:54] the word he so he's saying obey them
[1:56] that have the rule over you and we we
[1:59] labor that point the rule the word that
[2:01] the word is actually the thing that
[2:02] captures you and submit yourselves for
[2:06] they watch for your souls as they that
[2:09] must give
[2:10] account I was thinking about how God
[2:12] puts this like a almost like a hierarchy
[2:15] the man is always going to have to give
[2:17] an account for the woman so in a
[2:19] relationship he's got to give an account
[2:21] for the the woman the woman the wife is
[2:24] never going to have to give an account
[2:25] for the man's behavior but the man one
[2:27] day will have to give an account for the
[2:29] woman
[2:30] and you keep going up and and there's uh
[2:33] you take you're taking a huge
[2:35] responsibility as a minister because
[2:37] you're actually watching over people's
[2:39] souls and it matters whether you're
[2:41] preaching the truth or whether you're
[2:43] preaching something that ain't because
[2:45] you will have to give an account for
[2:47] that and you are responsible where
[2:49] that's why brother R just said well just
[2:51] say what I said don't uh I was listening
[2:54] to brother Wayne preaching at the
[2:55] Virginia meetings and he was like I
[2:57] don't know he said he was I'm going to
[3:00] it's odd to kind of quote another
[3:01] Minister but he was it was good he was
[3:03] saying that um if you're not just saying
[3:06] what brother brandom said you're in
[3:08] bondage and you're in in you're you're
[3:10] bound and I I thought that was excellent
[3:14] it matters what we're preaching so he's
[3:16] saying uh obey them that have the rule
[3:18] over you submit yourselves for they
[3:20] watch for your souls as they that must
[3:21] give account that they may do it with
[3:23] joy and not with grief for that is
[3:26] unprofitable for you so in verse 18 Paul
[3:30] says pray for
[3:32] us for We Trust we have a good
[3:36] conscience so this morning I want to
[3:37] just kind of labor on what that means
[3:39] what is your conscience what does it
[3:41] mean to have a good conscience and why
[3:43] would that be important we trust we have
[3:46] a good conscience in all things willing
[3:48] to live honestly so what what what is a
[3:51] good conscience in 1 Peter chapter 3: 21
[3:54] it says uh the light figure where unto
[3:57] even baptism so when you go to the water
[4:01] baptism do also now save us not the
[4:03] putting away of the filth of the flesh
[4:05] but the answer of a good conscience
[4:07] toward God so when you start your
[4:10] Christian Journey going down in the
[4:13] water that signifies that you've got a
[4:16] good conscience that your conscience is
[4:19] right that the path is cleared you know
[4:22] what you're supposed to be doing and
[4:24] you're acting in accordance with what
[4:26] that little voice on the inside is
[4:29] telling you you need to do by the
[4:31] resurrection of Jesus Christ so what is
[4:34] cons conscience is is your is your sense
[4:38] of right and wrong so you can kind of
[4:40] see where we're going if you've got a
[4:41] good conscience there's that little some
[4:44] that innate sense down in your heart
[4:46] that everybody's kind of you you you're
[4:49] you've got that to tell you you
[4:51] shouldn't be doing that right or you
[4:53] should be doing it or whatever and if
[4:55] you're acting in accordance with that
[4:58] then you got a good conscience
[5:00] conscience is a person's sense of right
[5:02] and wrong acting as a guide to one's
[5:04] behavior and y'all know we're not using
[5:06] Hollywood that ex said an example but
[5:08] that little Pinocchio that they Disney
[5:12] made their little Jiminy Cricket to be
[5:14] something you could look at as an
[5:15] example of what conscience is Jiminy
[5:17] Cricket sitting there chirping away
[5:19] saying you're not Pinocchio you're not
[5:21] supposed to be doing that or whatever
[5:23] but it's it it's an inner we ain't got a
[5:25] cricket but it's a gift of God that's
[5:27] that's God has given to us to so that we
[5:30] and we'll look at some things that Paul
[5:32] said here in a minute that everybody
[5:33] everybody's got that little kind of
[5:35] notion like I I shouldn't be taking that
[5:39] cookie from the cookie jar I shouldn't
[5:40] be doing it it's an inner feeling or
[5:43] voice that provides Direction and makes
[5:45] you feel guilty when you do something
[5:48] wrong it makes you and oh we we we want
[5:52] to live a life if if you've got a good
[5:54] conscience then you're living a life in
[5:57] peace because you're not behaving in a a
[5:59] way that makes you feel guilty or if you
[6:01] or it's your it's your conscience that
[6:03] makes you feel guilty so if you feel
[6:04] guilty go get it straightened up and
[6:06] then you can have peace so and uh in
[6:10] first Timothy Paul's telling us now the
[6:12] spirit speaketh expressly that in the
[6:15] latter times some shall depart from the
[6:18] faith giving heed to seducing spirits
[6:21] and doctrines of devils so you start
[6:24] ignoring that conscience you're
[6:25] listening to the LIE of the devil and
[6:27] these false preachers and listening to
[6:29] the h would and everything every other
[6:30] voice contrary to the word of God and
[6:33] he's saying speaking lies and hypocrisy
[6:36] having their conscience seared with a
[6:38] hot iron so you start ignoring that
[6:41] conscience ignoring that voice and after
[6:43] a while what's a hot iron do you know in
[6:47] the Civil War somebody get their arm cut
[6:49] off or something and they take the to
[6:51] stop the blood flow they take a big hot
[6:53] iron and and stick it on that to stop
[6:55] the blood and what would it do it would
[6:57] stop the feeling so you don't feel that
[6:59] nub that's got the nerve endings it's
[7:02] now now you done you seared it so you
[7:04] don't feel anymore and so that's that
[7:07] hot iron if you just stop listening to
[7:09] your conscience it's like you just don't
[7:10] you don't really care anymore and and
[7:13] that's that's the state I think brother
[7:15] Ryan touched on that in the in his last
[7:17] Sunday school message that you can keep
[7:19] going and going and going until you get
[7:20] to a place where you the word of God
[7:22] doesn't really have any effect on your
[7:24] on your heart it doesn't really you've
[7:27] just gone so far that it's seared and
[7:29] now that's what Paul was saying in the
[7:31] latter times that that's how the world
[7:33] would get the state the spiritual state
[7:36] would get to where just people just
[7:38] don't care anymore their conscience is
[7:41] seared and brother Rand will saying the
[7:43] God of this evil
[7:45] age children of Disobedience and the
[7:48] children of obedience has nothing in
[7:50] common one is of the day of light the
[7:53] other one of night and darkness evil age
[7:55] this evil age of Darkness nightclubs
[7:57] dances yet belong to church it's it's
[7:59] okay with their God they don't have any
[8:01] condemnation about it nothing bothers
[8:03] them why I don't condemn me to cut my
[8:06] hair a woman said don't hurt my
[8:09] conscience she's got no more conscience
[8:11] than a snake has got
[8:14] heels I love the way he puts things
[8:17] that's right certainly not she don't
[8:18] know what a conscience is it has been so
[8:21] seared it has been seared so hard till
[8:24] she don't even know what it is that's
[8:26] right walking around over the word of
[8:28] God saying while that's some old fogy
[8:31] don't go up there that's just a bunch of
[8:33] noise and carry on anyhow know no more
[8:36] about God than a hotton top would know
[8:38] about an Egyptian
[8:40] KN another place he'd say in the Oneness
[8:43] of unity he said when that spirit is in
[8:45] there it takes hold of God's Eternal
[8:47] Word and it calls everything contrary to
[8:50] it as though it wasn't no matter what it
[8:54] takes place what the world says what
[8:56] anything else says if God has made the
[8:58] promise the a man that's endued with
[9:00] that spirit will hold on to the promise
[9:02] of God because there's nothing else in
[9:04] his way the church is pure the church is
[9:09] purged by the Holy Spirit their
[9:12] conscience is seared of doubt and
[9:15] unbelief is taken away I thought that
[9:19] was an interesting kind of comparison
[9:21] that the church has been seed of doubt
[9:24] in our conscience now look at like that
[9:27] progression that he's taken us down your
[9:29] cons ience that he can take your
[9:31] conscience your soul the thing that
[9:33] guides you the the thing that you don't
[9:36] even realize as there a lot of time it's
[9:38] it's pulling you from one direction to
[9:39] the other and he can purify your
[9:41] conscience and Purge it so that your
[9:44] your motives and your objectives and
[9:46] your desire is correct but then still in
[9:49] your spirit realm you're battling out
[9:51] you got that battle the constant white
[9:53] dog black dog Battle of battling out
[9:55] whether things are right and true and
[9:56] everything so there's things that are
[9:58] working in different levels MH that God
[10:00] and your soul can can Purge your
[10:02] conscience so that your your
[10:05] desire is is correct now let's let's
[10:08] keep let's keep moving on in Romans chap
[10:11] 2:14-15 he said for when
[10:13] Gentiles who do not have the law by
[10:16] Nature do what the law
[10:18] requires they are a law to themselves
[10:22] even though they do not have the
[10:25] law they show that the work of the law
[10:28] is written on on their hearts while
[10:30] their conscience also Bears witness and
[10:33] their conflicting thoughts accuse or
[10:36] even excuse them so look at that that
[10:39] he's showing that even somebody that's
[10:42] doesn't know anything about scripture
[10:45] has an innate sense of what's right and
[10:47] wrong within
[10:50] them their conscience Bears witness now
[10:53] Charles Spurgeon would say that
[10:54] conscience is the voice of God in the
[10:56] soul and he said again is the best
[11:00] friend that any man can have it will be
[11:02] the truest Monitor and the most
[11:05] impartial judge but but so many times we
[11:09] don't listen to that there that
[11:11] conscious is that voice it's like I'm
[11:13] something's wrong something's wrong in
[11:15] my life I I need something we'll call it
[11:18] maybe thirst too that thirst that God
[11:21] has given to every man woman boy girl
[11:25] that you know you need something
[11:31] and uh CS Lewis says conscience is a
[11:33] messenger of God speaking his truth in
[11:37] our inward parts and we just read where
[11:39] Paul said everybody's got that
[11:41] conscience Gentiles who don't even have
[11:44] the law but by Nature do what the law
[11:47] requires they are a law to themselves
[11:50] even though they don't have the law so
[11:53] what's a good
[11:55] conscience in Hebrews
[11:58] 10:2 he said because that the
[12:00] worshippers once purged should have had
[12:01] no more conscience of sins and brother
[12:04] Bram said in the law having a shadow he
[12:05] said notice the worshipper once purged
[12:10] has no more desire of sin all right so
[12:13] now we're dealing down in the in the
[12:15] soul right no more conscience the word
[12:18] conscience is desire look and see if
[12:21] that ain't right conscience is what's in
[12:23] it in there making your desires and
[12:26] that's why you can see in the scripture
[12:28] if you love The world and the things of
[12:30] the world the love of the the father is
[12:32] not even in you because your desire that
[12:35] God could change your conscience that
[12:37] thing down on the inside that makes you
[12:38] want things of the world and can change
[12:40] that Purge it so that you don't want to
[12:43] look at things you you shouldn't and you
[12:45] don't want all of those things that a
[12:47] sinner wants your conscience is to do it
[12:51] and your conscience is not to do it it's
[12:54] your desire right and I've got a little
[12:57] picture of of a heart that's got some
[13:01] eternal life eternal fire that's kind of
[13:03] driving it now thank God this morning
[13:06] that God can take a heart and can change
[13:08] it now this is what this is speaking of
[13:11] that can change your desire so that you
[13:13] want the word of God so that you
[13:16] recognize that thing that will satisfy
[13:18] that thirst in you and you start wanting
[13:21] that instead of the things of the world
[13:23] that God can change and you that then
[13:25] you have no more conscience of sins you
[13:27] don't want that anymore more you've been
[13:30] changed and the law having a shadow he
[13:32] said a Believer once coming into Christ
[13:35] and by one Spirit baptized into that
[13:38] body he has perfected forever those that
[13:41] are in Christ Jesus then the things of
[13:44] the world see and the worshipper once
[13:47] purged has no more conscience or the
[13:49] right interpretation of that has no more
[13:51] desire of sin for the worshipper once
[13:54] purged has no more desire or conscience
[13:57] of sin he doesn't even want to sin he he
[14:00] will do things wrong and as soon as he
[14:02] does it he will confess his sins right
[14:05] there and say God forgive me I didn't
[14:08] mean to do that you know it father God
[14:11] never sees it but he has an advocate he
[14:13] has a confession and he makes it now
[14:16] that that all that you know you do
[14:19] something wrong and it really Grieves
[14:21] you it just bothers you that that shows
[14:24] that something's H happening in your
[14:25] heart you just can't get away from it
[14:28] you're just and mess you know you it
[14:30] just bothers you when something you know
[14:32] you say something hurtful to somebody or
[14:34] you uh you know a long list of all the
[14:37] things that could grieve you get grieved
[14:39] down in your heart because you've been
[14:41] changed something's Something's Happened
[14:45] and brother Brown said and he was to
[14:47] pass that way he said I know you
[14:49] prospered your business has been great
[14:52] but won't you take Jesus with you this
[14:54] morning won't you let him go with you
[14:55] he's come for you he's revealing to you
[14:57] now who you are making you know here's
[15:00] here's where he's speaking to that
[15:01] little conscience down on in the heart
[15:03] making you know that little crooked deal
[15:06] that you did the other day that little
[15:08] bad word that you spoke that little
[15:10] smart elic thing you said to that woman
[15:12] or that man he knows it he speaking to
[15:15] you as him talking to your conscience
[15:19] aren't you ashamed of
[15:21] yourself now look look what we're let's
[15:24] not lose sight of the lesson we're we're
[15:26] talking about today that Paul was trying
[15:27] to express we need to live honestly yes
[15:30] and with a good conscience cuz that's
[15:32] how you end up with peace that's how you
[15:34] can go to bed at night and lay your head
[15:36] on your pillow and sleep well if you're
[15:38] doing if you're acting in accordance
[15:40] with what you know what you know is
[15:42] right and you're you're communicating
[15:44] honestly to people that you fellowship
[15:47] with and and and you're you're behaving
[15:50] it's our Behavior it's our character
[15:52] that God's evaluating testing as we're
[15:54] moving up the sture for perfect man how
[15:56] are we acting how are we behaving and
[15:59] we've got to we've got to behave right
[16:00] so that the tutor can go back and say
[16:02] he's acting just like just like
[16:05] Daddy and the uncertain sound brother R
[16:08] said the first time she grieved it back
[16:10] there when she started out running
[16:11] around on her husband he's talking about
[16:13] grieving the conscience and going too
[16:14] far he said there's a separating line
[16:16] there that if it ever crosses it'll
[16:19] never cross back again it'll never come
[16:22] again now that's going back to searing
[16:24] your conscience with that hot iron
[16:26] searing it where there's no feeling you
[16:28] just don't don't care anymore and oh my
[16:31] if there's if there's anybody here this
[16:32] morning that's that's uh putting off
[16:36] responding or just just you know letting
[16:39] things grow cold don't don't do that
[16:42] because you don't want to lose the
[16:44] feeling you don't want to lose the
[16:46] feeling of what's right and wrong where
[16:48] it just doesn't touch you
[16:51] anymore the world wants you to make
[16:53] think that makes you want to think that
[16:55] men ain't supposed to cry and all that
[16:56] kind of stuff but you don't want to lose
[16:58] the feeling where you're
[17:00] touched then the Soul the conscience
[17:02] that once condemns you brother R said
[17:04] isn't there anymore and you've gone all
[17:06] together into intellectual you go join
[17:09] some old cold formal church that don't
[17:12] believe in those things on out into hog
[17:14] eat hog and the first thing you know the
[17:17] soul that condemns you for the first
[17:18] time you told a lie the first time you
[17:21] put on those short clothes the first
[17:24] time you did immoral acts will become so
[17:28] dead to you
[17:29] you won't feel it anymore on and on
[17:32] you'll go and after a while death will
[17:36] catch up with you now that's terrible
[17:38] ain't
[17:40] it so what's of good conscience 1 Peter
[17:43] 3:16 Peter said having a good conscience
[17:47] so that when you are slandered those who
[17:50] revile your good behavior in Christ may
[17:52] be put to shame so a good conscience is
[17:56] it results from living in a manner
[17:58] consistent with one's faith in Jesus
[18:03] Christ that that seems real simple but
[18:06] it's it's something that we all struggle
[18:07] with you know down in your heart you
[18:10] know something's right you know you know
[18:11] how you're supposed to live but then if
[18:13] outside you behaving a little bit
[18:16] differently if you that's where you
[18:19] won't have a good
[18:20] conscience it it's almost getting into
[18:22] territory of like a hypocrite I was I
[18:24] was seeing uh I was just looking at what
[18:27] a hypocrite was and one a good EX
[18:28] example is the um I was looking at
[18:30] Stanley Williams was the leader of the
[18:33] Crips gang and during the day back in
[18:37] the 1970s he would lead a little youth
[18:40] meeting that was anti- gangs and he
[18:43] would tell people you don't need to join
[18:45] a gang we're not going to and he during
[18:47] the day that was his his role but at
[18:50] night he was the leader of the Crips and
[18:53] he would go kill the other gang members
[18:55] of the Bloods and you talk about a a a
[18:58] example of what a hypocrite is and see
[19:01] you're never going to be able to have a
[19:02] good conscience if you're in the daytime
[19:05] acting one way and in the night time
[19:06] acting a different way at work you're
[19:09] acting one way and then at church you're
[19:11] acting another way then see it there's
[19:14] something at odds you you come to church
[19:16] and you're trying to put on a show and
[19:18] then you go to work and you're not
[19:20] really you you can't really present
[19:22] you're not presenting the gospel to your
[19:25] to the people that you work with and
[19:27] things and and you're not you're never
[19:29] have there will always be something
[19:30] that's at odds something inside you know
[19:34] something's true but outside you know
[19:36] you're acting contrary to
[19:40] that in Revelation chapter 4 brother R
[19:43] said some people
[19:45] say did I already read this I don't
[19:49] think I did it don't condemn me to wear
[19:51] short hair the women it don't condemn me
[19:54] to wear manicure or makeups or whatever
[19:56] it is it don't condemn me to go to
[19:57] dances it don't condemn me to tell a
[20:00] little white lie it don't condemn me to
[20:02] play bridge in my bridge party you know
[20:05] why you ain't got nothing to condemn
[20:08] that don't hurt my conscience you got no
[20:10] more conscience than a snake has hips I
[20:13] did already read that I read that well
[20:16] well I need you to read it
[20:21] so we needed to hear that twice so what
[20:24] are some good signs of a good conscience
[20:27] you strive to do the right thing you
[20:30] consistently make an effort to do what
[20:32] you believe is right even when it's
[20:34] difficult or unpopular now see that that
[20:37] leader of the Crips he ain't during the
[20:40] daytime he's doing what would have an
[20:42] appearance as real good but at night
[20:43] he's not he's not consistent you feel at
[20:46] peace with your
[20:48] decisions when you make choices that
[20:51] align with your conscience with what you
[20:53] know down in your heart's right then you
[20:55] can lay your head on your pillow at
[20:57] night and you can have peace
[20:59] peace and you are honest and truthful
[21:03] you value honesty and strive to be
[21:05] truthful in your interactions with
[21:07] others even when it might be easier to
[21:10] lie or withhold information now that's
[21:13] why Paul's saying in Hebrews 138 pray
[21:15] for
[21:16] us pray for us pray for us at church
[21:19] that we can we can meet this standard
[21:21] that God's laid out you know why it's so
[21:23] important to be honest as a Christian
[21:25] because we're trying to win souls and
[21:27] how are you going to win Souls if
[21:29] somebody can't have the utmost
[21:31] confidence in you I want my children
[21:34] that's why sometimes you know you you
[21:36] you say things I'd ATT turn with your
[21:37] kids and everything and I'd go to them
[21:39] at night and like I've gone to Zach
[21:41] before and get down beside his bed and
[21:44] kneel beside him and say look I'm sorry
[21:47] and apologize for things that you said
[21:51] the way that you've acted why because
[21:53] you want people to be able to trust you
[21:56] I want my children to be able to trust
[21:58] me
[21:59] trust and honesty is of Paramount
[22:01] importance it's more important than
[22:04] silver and gold pray for us for We Trust
[22:08] we have a good conscience in all things
[22:11] willing to live honestly in everything
[22:15] so what is honesty
[22:17] truthfulness conveying information that
[22:19] is factual factual accurate and free
[22:23] from lies or
[22:25] misrepresentation now a lie is what got
[22:27] us into this mess
[22:29] a lie there in the Garden of Eden is
[22:31] just Twisted just a little
[22:33] bit sincerity expressing your authentic
[22:36] thoughts exactly how you feel just being
[22:40] honest and transparent your feelings and
[22:43] intentions without pretense or any
[22:45] ulterior motives straightforwardness
[22:48] communicating clearly and directly
[22:51] avoiding evasiveness or misleading
[22:54] statements and y'all have heard me say
[22:56] that many times I think the way that the
[22:58] devil can get in and Inter and mess with
[23:01] your family with relationships with the
[23:03] church body and everything it's all down
[23:06] to communication communication is where
[23:09] things Begin to Fall Apart in your
[23:11] family people just don't understand one
[23:13] another I told I thought you were going
[23:15] to take the trash out what it's all down
[23:17] to communication Proverbs 12:22 says
[23:20] lying lips are Abomination to the Lord
[23:22] but they that deal truly are his Delight
[23:25] Colossians 3:9-10 says lie not to one to
[23:29] another seeing that you have put off the
[23:31] old man with his deeds and have put on
[23:34] the new man which is renewed and
[23:36] knowledge after the image of him that
[23:39] created him why why is honesty so so
[23:42] important because if in life in life if
[23:45] you got something that's a lie the devil
[23:48] will bring in a lie that will cause a
[23:50] relationship or a situation in your life
[23:53] but the only thing that will bust up
[23:56] that lie like an adab bomb is is the
[23:59] truth you you maybe you have like a
[24:01] family situation I'm I'm winding down
[24:03] here the last couple of minutes you got
[24:05] a family situation where a lie has come
[24:07] in and some maybe there's infidelity or
[24:09] something the only thing that'll
[24:11] straighten that out is the truth the
[24:14] only thing that can set things right is
[24:16] the truth and the truth is like a atam
[24:18] bomb you can drop it on the line and it
[24:20] will blow it away it will it will set
[24:23] everything in
[24:25] order that's
[24:27] why that's why
[24:29] the gospel is represented by truth Jesus
[24:31] is the truth yes and pilot standing
[24:34] there talking to with with the truth
[24:36] right right in front of him and he he
[24:38] didn't recognize it what is truth was
[24:40] his question and Truth was right there
[24:42] truth is what will set us free it will
[24:45] set everything in order the
[24:48] truth and I don't have time to look at
[24:51] some of these other things so we'll just
[24:53] stop there and God bless you and bless
[24:56] the rest of the day amen than
