[1:57] go
[1:57] third seal let's read chapter six
[2:01] excuse me verse five
[2:09] now let me just make a few comments the
[2:12] first seal on the second seal we took a
[2:13] kind of a long time we're gonna try to
[2:16] not take such a long time i don't know
[2:18] if somebody may be getting bored with it
[2:20] or what but you know we we
[2:22] i just want to try to get the highlights
[2:24] and the thoughts because when we finish
[2:26] the seals we're going to come back
[2:29] let's think about this the other day
[2:30] we're going to come back
[2:32] and we're going to go through the
[2:33] justification part the sanctification
[2:35] part
[2:36] the holy ghost part the the the grace
[2:38] the
[2:39] the love the um the many things that
[2:42] that
[2:42] that we're not really you know digging
[2:45] into we're just getting more the symbols
[2:48] we can start now because our
[2:52] foreign sisters are here i had a long
[2:56] way to travel
[2:57] maybe you should have not set your clock
[3:01] you'd have been here an hour ago
[3:05] yeah one come from trinidad and the
[3:07] other one from zimbabwe
[3:13] they really had to roll their car
[3:15] windows up tight when they got to the
[3:16] coast
[3:19] well they made it yeah and they both
[3:22] wore red
[3:22] so that group over there has been
[3:25] covered by the blood over there now
[3:29] but we covered the first seal on the
[3:31] second seal kind of fast we're going to
[3:33] cover the third seal with the cymbals
[3:34] and all these other things
[3:36] and then when we do that we are going to
[3:40] back up
[3:58] nobody's getting in nothing
[4:10] don't worry sister these other ones are
[4:13] they were like that
[4:16] but listen but we covered the first two
[4:18] seals kind of took a long time let's
[4:20] just don't take a long time on that
[4:22] on the third seal on through it's not
[4:24] that it's not important
[4:25] but i don't want you to lose our thought
[4:27] that it's not all
[4:29] uh white horse riders and red horse
[4:31] riders and
[4:33] you understand those are symbols symbols
[4:37] somewhere under that symbol is a meaning
[4:41] right john didn't get the meaning john
[4:43] john was just commissioned to write
[4:45] down what he what so not what he thought
[4:48] he wrote down what he saw it was for an
[4:51] end time bride
[4:52] to pick the thoughts up of god about
[4:55] that one horse rider red horse rider of
[4:57] dark horse rider
[4:58] all right but underneath that is the
[5:01] revelation that's what brother branham
[5:02] come to bring us
[5:03] the big nugget and then even inside that
[5:06] big nugget is little bitty nuggets
[5:09] that supposedly that we are supposed to
[5:11] in the end time
[5:12] i say supposedly we're supposed to see
[5:15] that they're open and we're supposed to
[5:16] explain it to the people best of our
[5:18] ability and then what does that do that
[5:20] opens your
[5:21] eyes up so that god can speak to you
[5:24] because this is an individual affair
[5:25] with god
[5:27] somebody me and brother uh soriano was
[5:29] speaking wednesday night out at the car
[5:32] and he said well brother he said the
[5:35] seals are open and he said somebody you
[5:39] know said well the seal
[5:40] wasn't open um
[5:43] i'm getting taller again so the seals
[5:46] were
[5:47] were not open somebody in the
[5:48] philippines he said oh brother i told
[5:50] them yes they are i said i looked at him
[5:52] i said
[5:53] you're right and he's right
[5:59] yeah i mean really you know you're not
[6:00] supposed to say but really
[6:03] it is open to the ones that get the
[6:05] revelation right
[6:06] because the ones that don't get to
[6:07] revelation it never opened it's still
[6:09] hunting broke
[6:11] if we don't have the revelation it's
[6:12] still not broke to us
[6:15] so brother brown could say salmon seal's
[6:17] not here yet salmon seal's not broken
[6:19] well
[6:20] guess what it wasn't to those people
[6:23] but it was to him right so he knew see
[6:25] this is what i believe the prophet knew
[6:26] he believed that if god
[6:28] showed it to him then he could show it
[6:31] to the people
[6:32] and somebody would catch it because he
[6:33] said it's not for you it's not for this
[6:35] generation in other words it wasn't for
[6:37] the people sitting in the congregation
[6:39] he said but right around the coming of
[6:40] the lord somebody pick up these things
[6:42] and sweep them onto the coming of the
[6:43] lord
[6:44] which that's what we're doing now i
[6:45] believe we're taking these things and
[6:47] and opening them up and and you know
[6:49] somebody sitting beside of you may not
[6:51] see them and somebody
[6:52] sitting inside of you may see them so to
[6:54] this person is closed
[6:57] so this person is open all right so when
[6:59] somebody say the seventh seal is not
[7:01] open you can say
[7:02] maybe not to you
[7:06] but it is to me if it's true that's true
[7:10] or you can confess like i confess lord
[7:12] if i can't see the seventh seal open
[7:15] let me open myself up up enough to see
[7:18] it
[7:18] yes all right now i just see the symbols
[7:20] i don't want to be like john
[7:22] i don't want to just write what i see no
[7:24] i want the revelation
[7:25] all right which was only supposed to
[7:27] come in the end time so this is the time
[7:29] that we're supposed to get these things
[7:30] all right
[7:31] no other time luther didn't sit see
[7:34] we're coming up in the age of man now
[7:35] we're luke and wesley
[7:37] they never they never caught the
[7:40] revelation of the seals
[7:42] it was just to them symbols symbols
[7:44] symbols people probed at it but no
[7:47] we're not probing at it now we have had
[7:49] those things
[7:50] given to us all right so the third seal
[7:53] here we go
[7:56] and when he had opened the third seal i
[7:58] heard the third beast say
[8:00] come and see and i beheld and lo
[8:03] a black horse and he that sat on him had
[8:06] a pair of balances
[8:08] in his hand and i heard a voice
[8:12] in the midst of the four beasts saying
[8:13] now look
[8:15] brother brown says that was the lamb
[8:19] you've not heard much from the anything
[8:21] from the lamb speaking
[8:25] when i watch from the midst of the four
[8:28] beasts in other words the lineups man
[8:29] and eagle
[8:31] god is going to make sure that
[8:32] something's going to happen
[8:34] all right now listen and heard a voice
[8:36] in the midst of the four beasts say
[8:38] a measure of wheat for a penny and three
[8:40] measures of barley for a penny
[8:42] and see thou hurt not the oil
[8:46] and the wine all right now what is wheat
[8:49] and what is barley
[8:50] sustaining life bread that's what you
[8:53] make bread out of
[8:54] wheat and barley that's what makes bread
[8:57] all right
[8:58] so it says a measure of wheat for a
[9:00] penny and three measures of barley for a
[9:01] penny
[9:02] and see thou hurt not the oil now what
[9:04] did the oil in the wine represent
[9:06] the holy spirit so what what are we
[9:08] dealing with here
[9:14] third seal let's go through some of the
[9:16] symbols
[9:18] i was given to this person sitting on a
[9:22] black horse the symbols were what pair
[9:24] of balances
[9:25] one wheat and barley was another and oil
[9:28] and wine was another so there's a few
[9:29] extra symbols here on this one but the
[9:31] black horse
[9:32] now remember he's not called death until
[9:35] the fourth
[9:36] pale but this is the beginning of death
[9:42] now every bit of its death but we're
[9:45] beginning to see
[9:46] that what came about in this time of the
[9:49] fifth and sixth church age
[9:50] which is the church age that this is
[9:52] covering parallel
[9:54] all right combat beast is man what we're
[9:57] now in the intelligence
[9:59] right justification
[10:02] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[10:05] we went from what
[10:07] lion ox
[10:11] man you can see a little further but the
[10:14] eagle can see further than all of them
[10:16] the line can only see past the grass the
[10:18] ox is a little bit taller and he can see
[10:20] a little further man stands upright and
[10:22] you can see a little bit further
[10:23] we've now come up into the intelligence
[10:25] of man
[10:26] but the intelligence of man took these
[10:30] not this took these and made that
[10:35] made a denomination lutheran wesley did
[10:38] not denominate they were the true seed
[10:40] of the ages right
[10:41] they didn't denominate you'll hear
[10:43] brother brown say luke are denominated
[10:45] not lutheran luther's people then you'll
[10:49] hear him say
[10:49] after luther's death the people come in
[10:52] and denominated
[10:53] lucas message all right
[10:56] but the reason that this is a wicked
[10:59] time
[11:00] is why the wicked one comes in and puts
[11:02] denominational ideas in people's head
[11:05] so we're going to deal with this as
[11:07] denomination we're going to deal with
[11:09] death a little bit
[11:10] i'm not going to write this one up till
[11:11] we get to a certain point
[11:13] but just keep these things in mind pair
[11:15] of balances wheat and barley
[11:17] all in wine denomination
[11:21] luther lutheran church
[11:24] wesley wesleyan church or
[11:28] what we call the methodists okay
[11:32] those were set up during this time of
[11:34] this rider going out of the black horse
[11:38] and i got that so we got our symbols
[11:40] kind of down we're going to kind of like
[11:41] say we're going to go through
[11:43] just a little bit quick more quick now
[11:45] let's go back to matthew
[11:49] we're just going to set a foundation
[11:50] today and then we'll go back to matthew
[11:56] matthew 24.
[12:06] matthew 24
[12:11] verse 7
[12:16] for the nation shall rise against nation
[12:18] remember we read this at the end last
[12:19] west sunday nations shall rise against
[12:23] nation
[12:25] look at that that can't be natural
[12:28] you know why look at the writing
[12:32] it's not nations
[12:37] there's never anybody you say well the
[12:39] civil war no
[12:40] the french helped us in the civil war
[12:43] the germans helped this one help
[12:47] there's not just one nation against one
[12:49] nation
[12:51] tell me show me anywhere that we've had
[12:54] a war
[12:54] a war less internally
[12:57] but even internally like the civil war
[13:00] the french helped us
[13:02] the italians helped the north the
[13:04] germans helped the north
[13:06] so it's not just see this would say
[13:08] nations
[13:10] it's not nations nation shall rise
[13:13] against
[13:14] nation so i believe it's talking more
[13:17] god's talking more spiritual because
[13:20] look at the next one kingdom against
[13:22] kingdom singular remember we said last
[13:23] sunday
[13:24] kingdom one satan against kingdom
[13:28] the second one god because satan and god
[13:31] remember brother brown said the greatest
[13:33] battle ever falls in your mind
[13:35] it's not with warfare that's right but
[13:38] it's god's kingdom
[13:39] and satan's kingdom and satan's kingdom
[13:41] trying to get in and god's kingdom
[13:42] either residing
[13:46] or trying to get in that's right in
[13:49] church
[13:50] that's exactly what it is nation shall
[13:52] rise against nato look up the word
[13:53] nation we'll look at that up a little
[13:54] bit later but just
[13:55] just for a key look up nation and
[13:57] kingdom and maybe it'll help you
[13:59] and there shall be famines famines what
[14:03] sure there's famines all over the world
[14:06] but the worst famine is the famine for
[14:08] the word of god
[14:09] all right and pestilences and
[14:11] earthquakes in divers places now we know
[14:13] this is a natural happening this is
[14:14] going to happen
[14:16] all right but the spiritual aspects but
[14:20] look
[14:20] all these are the beginning of sorrows
[14:25] all right now it's according which
[14:28] kingdom you're part of
[14:30] right you're part of god's kingdom
[14:33] you're going to have natural sorrow
[14:35] ups and downs ends are now but god's
[14:38] kingdom is a
[14:39] established kingdom satan's kingdom he
[14:42] don't even know what he's got he
[14:44] takes the world here and he'll take this
[14:46] because look
[14:50] power was given in other words it comes
[14:53] from a central location it was given to
[14:55] him to use
[14:57] remember brother branham said that satan
[14:58] really was a squatter
[15:00] memory has rights on the earth that's
[15:02] right because
[15:03] when god said i curse the ground
[15:07] satan moved right in because he's satan
[15:09] is a curse
[15:10] he moved right in in the garden and said
[15:11] hi okay i got this earth
[15:15] it's mine i was kicked out of heaven
[15:19] that's what he wanted first i was kicked
[15:22] out of heaven now he's
[15:23] now he's giving me the earth because if
[15:26] it's cursed
[15:26] it's mine so what did he curse he cursed
[15:30] the ball
[15:31] yeah but what comes out of the ball of
[15:33] earth me and you
[15:35] this right here satan had it dipped on
[15:38] moses body
[15:39] remember he disputed with michael they
[15:41] hid moses's body somewhere
[15:43] what the prophet said but satan was
[15:46] trying to find it because he said hey
[15:48] someone that's mine because he told the
[15:51] serpent he said thus shall you eat the
[15:52] rest of your life
[15:54] serpents don't eat dust natural
[15:58] he eats your dust because he told adam
[16:01] he said from dust thou came
[16:04] thus shalt thou return he told the
[16:06] serpent he said from this day forward
[16:07] you'll be eating dust
[16:09] so what you've been doing he's been
[16:10] eating our flesh that's why that we got
[16:13] to destroy that guy
[16:14] you say well i've never been a part of
[16:15] denomination
[16:17] any idea of this message
[16:21] apart from the truth is a denomination
[16:25] the highest form of denomination because
[16:27] you're deceived
[16:30] if a roman catholic church can deceive
[16:32] you you are ready to see
[16:34] if a baptist doctrine can deceive you
[16:36] you're already deceived
[16:37] if a methodist doctrine can deceive you
[16:39] you're already deceived you're not even
[16:41] in this kingdom that we're talking about
[16:42] okay
[16:46] that's why it's it's good to know that
[16:48] you're born again that god can talk to
[16:50] you
[16:50] sure he can talk to you before you're
[16:52] born again but boyfriend you're boring
[16:53] and he really can't talk to him
[16:55] and really it's hard but he will i mean
[16:59] he he promised he would
[17:01] he promised he'd send a comforter he
[17:02] promised he's sending somebody to tell
[17:04] us
[17:05] show you things to come that's what
[17:07] we're doing now
[17:08] because this is in the future really the
[17:10] natural happening
[17:11] natural happening is in the future all
[17:14] right
[17:15] we see that nation is rising against
[17:17] nation in the end time with the way the
[17:19] things are going the kingdom against
[17:21] kingdom
[17:22] but this third seal though watch it's
[17:25] talking about nations and kingdoms it's
[17:27] talking about what
[17:28] what's the first thing jesus preached
[17:32] the kingdom of heaven is at hand
[17:36] right right now the new birth because
[17:38] that's the kingdom of heaven the kingdom
[17:40] of heaven is the new birth
[17:41] right so you've got satan's kingdom and
[17:44] god's kingdom
[17:46] jesus was standing there trying to tell
[17:48] him hey
[17:50] i come to establish a kingdom remember
[17:51] that's what he told pilate that's right
[17:54] pilot said you come down and take over
[17:55] he said i was going to take over i
[17:57] already took over in other words and he
[17:59] was telling him he said but
[18:00] i know and that's why pilate let him go
[18:04] he wasn't a threat that's right you know
[18:06] if you brought somebody to me like
[18:08] brother mark to me and you know
[18:09] brother mark says well i'm gonna take
[18:10] over i'm gonna do like him four old guys
[18:12] up in the coal the other day you know
[18:14] they're gonna get a militia together
[18:16] and they're gonna they're gonna just
[18:17] destroy the world
[18:19] well if if i look at him and there's
[18:21] nobody with him and
[18:24] he said well my kingdom's not of this
[18:27] world
[18:28] i don't even have subjects if i had
[18:30] stuff decided they'd fight and he said
[18:31] but
[18:32] i'm not even i'm not in other words he
[18:34] told pilate he said
[18:35] don't worry i'm not here to take over
[18:37] your kingdom
[18:38] that's why pilate let him go because the
[18:40] peter stood up and said well bless god
[18:41] i'm going to take over your kingdom and
[18:42] i'm going to do this and i'm going to do
[18:44] that pilate would've had him killed
[18:45] right now but pilate said i find no
[18:47] fault in this man in other words he's no
[18:49] harm to me
[18:51] because what he was talking about a
[18:52] spiritual kingdom that's right
[18:54] that pilot didn't know anything else so
[18:56] if pilate didn't know anything of that
[18:58] that's right he just said turning blue
[19:00] he's no threat to me
[19:02] but the jews knew that man was doing
[19:05] something besides just being a person
[19:07] walking around
[19:08] there was a there was those two kingdoms
[19:11] fighting against each other
[19:12] all right because remember they fought
[19:14] in the beginning
[19:16] they fought in the middle of the bible
[19:18] and they fight in the end time
[19:20] right and who always loses satan
[19:25] always loses all right but all these are
[19:27] the beginning of sorrows
[19:30] now listen this seal
[19:34] this third seal is
[19:37] showing us just kind of slow down man
[19:41] this seal is showing us
[19:44] what the natural world's going to do
[19:46] because what happened was remember
[19:48] brother brown
[19:49] we'll read it next sunday morning today
[19:51] or a few sundays
[19:52] from now that there was a man on the
[19:54] horse and he had a pair of balances in
[19:56] other words he was
[19:58] weighing the gold in the world and the
[20:00] things of the world
[20:02] you understand because he start now
[20:05] charging and what
[20:06] happened during this time the catholic
[20:07] church
[20:09] from that dark ages they come out and
[20:11] what was luther protesting those 95
[20:13] thesis boy's talking about it in the
[20:15] same school now
[20:16] those 95 theses were against what
[20:20] happened if you watched the movie
[20:21] martin luther before luther became
[20:26] filled with the holy ghost i would say
[20:27] and and started his message
[20:29] he was in the catholic church right he
[20:32] was doing the things of the catholic
[20:33] remember he would lay down across
[20:35] uh stones and say god he'd beat his head
[20:38] against the wall and say why is satan
[20:39] bombarding my mind because what he was
[20:43] taught by the catholic church was that
[20:44] if you'll pay so much penance if you'll
[20:46] get on your knees and walk up
[20:48] walk up a flight of stairs toward the
[20:50] virgin mary i'm just making a point
[20:52] or do something sister anna can probably
[20:54] tell you the things that they do but
[20:55] they actually
[20:56] tormented their own human flesh
[20:59] to try to do penance wheat and barley
[21:03] it started charging the people
[21:06] if you ever saw the movie the novenas is
[21:09] actually
[21:10] it's almost like a menu in a restaurant
[21:16] yeah that's what it is if you kill
[21:19] somebody right here's a line you know if
[21:20] you want steak and potatoes it cost you
[21:22] 2.99 or
[21:24] lord mercy 14 tonight
[21:28] all right i wish i hopefully wishful
[21:31] thinking
[21:32] i'm thinking about that murphy's
[21:34] statement
[21:37] you've never had it see you don't know
[21:38] what i'm talking about
[21:40] yep you know what i'm talking about i
[21:42] mean you never had it you don't know
[21:43] about me danny's had it and he knows
[21:44] what i'm talking about
[21:46] jim's had it she knows what i'm talking
[21:47] about
[21:49] sorry anyway but you got
[21:53] you know steak and potatoes 14.99 then
[21:55] you got sweet tea a dollar fifty cents
[21:57] and then you got if you want french
[21:58] fries with that you know you
[21:59] if you want a salad with that and well
[22:02] that's what a novena was
[22:03] it was something the catholic church
[22:05] made up to make money
[22:07] to make money so they took this sweet
[22:09] and barley which was the life
[22:10] life-sustaining
[22:13] food which was their doctrine
[22:17] they took that doctrine and started
[22:19] charging because it says right here says
[22:21] what a measure a measure of wheat for a
[22:24] penny
[22:25] and a measure of barley for a penny
[22:27] those novenas were actually that it was
[22:29] a piece of paper that the priest would
[22:30] come out in the community and he'd roll
[22:32] it down
[22:33] and he would say if you have committed
[22:35] murder
[22:36] pay so many that's why the catholic
[22:39] church is rich now
[22:40] people they got all the gold back then
[22:42] in the 1400s and
[22:44] 1300s and 1500s and 1600s they started
[22:47] charging people
[22:49] and the people had nothing to fight it
[22:51] with nothing
[22:54] well the catholic church must be the the
[22:56] one
[22:58] there's nothing else that's why luther
[23:00] come out protested that
[23:02] god finally revealed to him that the
[23:03] just shall live by faith not by a menu
[23:08] okay not by menu the just shall live by
[23:10] faith
[23:12] and you're gonna have problems and
[23:13] you're gonna have trials and troubles
[23:15] and
[23:15] satan's gonna bombard your mind because
[23:17] one time the movie shows luther in his
[23:20] room and he's like beating his head
[23:21] against the wall why he was talking he
[23:23] was saying satan get those thoughts i
[23:25] want you to get away from me get away
[23:26] from me get away from me
[23:28] well why didn't you have nothing to
[23:29] battle it with but see when he comes to
[23:32] the realization then you see him in the
[23:33] church he starts preaching the just
[23:34] shall live by faith
[23:36] he it just becomes so calm to him
[23:38] everything but see everybody around him
[23:40] though you still see the priest in the
[23:42] background they stand up in the
[23:44] in the middle of the street and they
[23:45] roll that scroll out and say okay if
[23:47] you've committed sin you'd pay
[23:48] 14 pence and you know if you committed
[23:52] this or if you committed adultery
[23:54] they got to where it was just like a
[23:55] menu you walked up and said hey i
[23:56] committed adultery yesterday well
[23:58] that'll be five dollars
[24:01] see that's why they charged for what
[24:03] should have been free
[24:05] wheat and barley is bread jesus said i'm
[24:07] the bread that come down out of heaven i
[24:08] believe luther caught that revelation i
[24:10] just believe he did
[24:11] that jesus was the bread jesus was the
[24:13] one that paid the price
[24:15] he paid for the wheat in the barley you
[24:17] know all the wine and everything
[24:18] but see the catholic church says no you
[24:21] we're interpreting this for you
[24:24] okay that's what they're saying we're
[24:26] interpreting this for you so this is
[24:28] what it means
[24:29] you pay us so much see that's where
[24:32] purgatory same thing with purgatory now
[24:34] i know a lot of you may not know this
[24:35] but purgatory
[24:37] is a place between like uh heaven hell
[24:40] and earth and somewhere in there
[24:42] that you go from earth you don't go to
[24:43] hell or you don't go to heaven you go to
[24:45] purgatory
[24:46] and guess what the priest goes
[24:50] well and i'm just making light of it
[24:53] because it's stupid i mean it's just
[24:54] it's a fault doctrine i wouldn't do this
[24:56] if it was real but it's like
[24:58] well he weighed 250 pounds so it's going
[25:00] to cost you a little bit more
[25:02] to get him out of purgatory than it
[25:04] would be somebody weighed 150 pounds
[25:06] because that was their mentality they
[25:09] did that with john kennedy
[25:12] on television when he was assassinated
[25:16] they preached him out of purgatory i
[25:19] remember the clip now i was a little boy
[25:21] but i remember later on in school we
[25:23] used to watch it
[25:24] and we could see where the priests were
[25:26] praying and doing their things and their
[25:28] and their fog and all that stuff what
[25:31] they were praying john kennedy out of
[25:33] purgatory and i'm sure the kennedys
[25:40] what
[25:43] a pair of balances they were weighing
[25:45] his sins
[25:48] against what they could do for him yeah
[25:50] and then paying him out of purgatory it
[25:52] balanced his sin
[25:54] so you know what that does that makes
[25:56] people say well it really doesn't matter
[25:57] what i do here
[25:59] see how they can see how that's how they
[26:01] do listen
[26:02] yeah you know why the mob
[26:06] are all catholics right but they want to
[26:10] they know they're going to go take a hit
[26:12] out on somebody they're going to go
[26:14] father forgive me forever seeing them
[26:15] listen i'm going to kill somebody
[26:17] tomorrow the priest goes well pay five
[26:18] dollars and you'll be okay
[26:20] or he'll say okay when you get to
[26:22] purgatory
[26:23] we'll pay you out or we'll make sure you
[26:26] get paid out
[26:27] if your boss has got enough money but
[26:30] you see how silly that is
[26:32] you we think that's silly and we laugh
[26:33] about it
[26:35] but to them people it was serious
[26:38] right it was real to those people they
[26:40] hung their soul that's why
[26:43] that blackness was the worst blackness
[26:46] that ever came on the face of the earth
[26:49] now let's take that over though and when
[26:52] these two became a denomination when it
[26:53] became luther
[26:54] luther lutheranism or lutheran doctrine
[26:58] or lupine church
[27:00] it was worse because it had went higher
[27:03] they'd done away with the novenas they
[27:05] had done away with all these things
[27:07] but they had come to a place and say
[27:09] well
[27:10] it doesn't matter what we do luther
[27:13] could
[27:14] smoke a pipe and drink a beer and he was
[27:16] all right so we can too but when wesley
[27:18] came along
[27:20] see and started preaching sanctification
[27:24] hey we need to quit doing those things
[27:27] well they denominated into a that's why
[27:30] the word
[27:30] methodist the word methodist come from
[27:33] the word method
[27:35] have you ever have you ever ever read or
[27:37] looked at a west um
[27:39] a methodist songbook
[27:42] you open the first few pages and it's
[27:44] all a method you do this
[27:46] you do this you sing this song you take
[27:49] up the offering you do this right here
[27:50] you sing this song why wesley
[27:54] in sanctification the part he was to
[27:56] preach
[27:58] said okay we got to clear our mind and
[27:59] he gave a clear order on how to do
[28:02] a song service and then how to do
[28:04] because charles was his brother
[28:05] he wrote songs so he was a good song
[28:07] leader so they got together but you know
[28:09] what god was happy with that
[28:11] you know what it done it took the people
[28:12] out of the pub took the people out of
[28:14] smoking
[28:14] took the people out of doing adulteries
[28:16] and committing you know cleaning the
[28:17] people up
[28:19] getting ready for what pentecost baptism
[28:22] of the holy ghost
[28:23] getting ready to clean the very inside
[28:24] person out completely
[28:26] all right but let's not get to that but
[28:28] see this now
[28:31] excuse me the wicked one didn't say oh
[28:34] i'm defeated
[28:36] he just went from catholicism to
[28:39] lutheranism
[28:41] from catholicism to wesleyanism
[28:45] for wesleyanism pentecostalism
[28:47] pentecostalism to branhamide-ism
[28:51] and all the other isms and schisms
[28:54] so satan is not he's defeated
[28:58] but he's got a final battle god's a good
[29:01] god he's going to give me one more shot
[29:03] all right but what's he doing now
[29:07] if he killed the people in that dark age
[29:09] remember we told there were so many
[29:11] millions 68 million protestants put to
[29:13] death
[29:14] by the catholic church on their record
[29:16] that many alone that they killed
[29:18] physically
[29:20] brother brown said remember i wrote like
[29:22] untold
[29:23] billions by their doctrine
[29:26] well see that doctrine carried right on
[29:28] over to lutheran wesley
[29:30] now listen when let me get this straight
[29:32] people on tape too
[29:34] when luther came out and preached the
[29:35] just shall live by faith and god
[29:37] revealed that to him and people become
[29:39] become converted out of that catholic
[29:40] church they're born again bride just
[29:43] like you are
[29:44] let me get there's no little holy ghost
[29:46] in big holy ghost right
[29:48] the problem with them was and god winked
[29:51] at their ignorance the prophet said but
[29:53] just like my story
[29:54] about the the the hole
[29:57] see i can point at sister mary and look
[29:59] with both eyes and
[30:00] and that's true i see her
[30:04] but see there's this whole room full of
[30:05] people but i don't know that because i
[30:06] just see mary
[30:08] kathy got marry on my mind
[30:12] kathy bless her heart she's smiling
[30:15] today
[30:18] she didn't get a two-week vacation
[30:20] though like he did honeymoon my kid
[30:21] brother ray did
[30:24] man that's unreal two weeks quit smiling
[30:29] he came out of that church yesterday he
[30:31] did
[30:49] but anyway all right look this is god
[30:53] i'll allow this because this is true
[30:56] this is the truth
[30:56] luther just shall live by faith but now
[31:00] god's got all these other
[31:02] things for people to see
[31:06] duck
[31:10] but now right now in the lutheran age i
[31:11] only see kathy but she's real
[31:14] the word of god you understand what i'm
[31:16] saying the word of god was there
[31:18] they just started putting the bible
[31:19] together in luther's time all right
[31:21] so they can start reading put scripture
[31:23] together
[31:24] all right but they could only see paul
[31:26] even says we should see through a glass
[31:28] darkly
[31:29] all right so luther saw through a glass
[31:31] darker he only saw one thing that joshua
[31:33] left my faith god said
[31:34] i agree with that that's the way it's
[31:37] supposed to be that's my man and those
[31:38] are my people
[31:40] that he brings in that's the new birth
[31:42] for the age
[31:43] but now that doesn't mean god's finished
[31:45] right because there's more of the
[31:46] picture
[31:47] wesley panned out and got oh i see three
[31:51] people
[31:52] sanctification we got to clean this
[31:55] place up we got to clean this man
[31:56] up but the holy ghost is still
[32:01] pleased to dwell
[32:04] wesley's people are going to be right
[32:06] there with us
[32:09] their bride they are sons and daughters
[32:12] of god just like we are
[32:14] all right i want that to be clear these
[32:16] people in the mentions don't believe
[32:17] that
[32:18] even though they were reformers
[32:21] even though they were reformers i say
[32:24] this is my quote
[32:25] they started restoration
[32:29] because the four life messengers bring
[32:31] it back four eat it down
[32:33] four bring it back right just in case
[32:36] the same case baptism holy ghost in the
[32:37] word
[32:38] luther wesley pentecost end time message
[32:42] okay so if four eat it down cankerworm
[32:44] palmer
[32:45] worm locust caterpillar if they afford
[32:48] it now ford's got to bring it back up
[32:49] all right so it was luther true wesley
[32:53] true pentecost was even true for their
[32:55] time
[32:55] but what did god do the lutheran people
[32:59] they stayed like this god moved on
[33:04] god said no no no there's this they said
[33:07] no
[33:07] no this is all so god moved away from
[33:10] that
[33:11] to more revelation then god moved away
[33:14] from
[33:15] wesley said this is it and it was for
[33:18] the day
[33:18] but the people said this is all we're
[33:21] going to do right here
[33:23] brother brown said they cabbage down set
[33:25] down on it god what god just kept moving
[33:27] because there was more to reveal same
[33:29] way with pentecost
[33:31] speaking in tongues bringing back the
[33:33] gifts
[33:34] see i've always said that this is my
[33:36] last comment lutheran wesley
[33:38] if it would have been luther wesley
[33:40] listen people god knows we're human
[33:42] he knows what our mental mind can accept
[33:45] and reject
[33:47] if he would have went from luther to
[33:48] wesley which was staunch you do it this
[33:51] way
[33:51] and then brother branham came on the
[33:52] scene
[33:54] think of the conflict
[33:58] but brother but see you had luther
[33:59] wesley pentecost
[34:01] gifts speaking in tongues healing the
[34:02] sick casting out devils
[34:05] having a shout in hallelujah time will
[34:06] see brother brown could come right in
[34:08] and just fit right in with that group
[34:10] and then you and i wouldn't have a
[34:11] problem but see with wesley
[34:14] it was more of a method way of doing
[34:15] things and brother brown wouldn't fit in
[34:17] there
[34:18] so god knew that he put that pentecostal
[34:20] revival in there to
[34:22] raise everybody up and then he brought a
[34:24] prophet on the scene
[34:25] so see they'll they'll accept prophets
[34:27] methodists don't no
[34:30] they don't even hardly accept john
[34:31] wesley right now remember brother
[34:33] branham's first
[34:34] experience with pentecostals he was
[34:35] talking about that lady
[34:37] sure and then he said he found he was
[34:38] tapping right he said then he found out
[34:40] he said
[34:41] after a while he said i was running
[34:42] right behind her so you know he
[34:44] he he went with god knows how that you
[34:47] and i can take things
[34:49] that's the same thing with these seals
[34:50] you said well maybe i didn't get all the
[34:52] one and two i didn't understand what
[34:53] you're talking about
[34:54] just hang on that's right just hang on
[34:57] to what you did
[34:59] that's what brother don again said last
[35:01] sunday please pray for him he just he's
[35:04] he's got his mind but not his body and
[35:06] that's worse than
[35:07] the opposite yeah i gotta lose my mind
[35:10] and have my body
[35:11] yeah you know at least somebody lead me
[35:12] around but uh
[35:16] yes i know but but anyway he said
[35:19] he said i'm at the end of my role that's
[35:22] what he said he said i'm at the end of
[35:24] my rope you know what i told him i said
[35:25] brother don
[35:26] i said when you're at the end of your
[35:27] rope i said time not
[35:30] hang on because god's fixing to do
[35:32] something
[35:34] remember the story about the guy that
[35:36] that come off the mountain he was
[35:37] repelling and he
[35:38] got down to the to the bottom and he was
[35:41] holding on and god
[35:42] kept selling say let go let go
[35:46] just let go and trust me let go it's
[35:48] dark god couldn't see anything
[35:50] and the next morning they found him dead
[35:53] froze on the rope
[35:55] and he was this far from the ground
[36:00] let go you let go yeah
[36:03] or do like the guy said if you get to
[36:05] the end of your rope try not hang on
[36:06] because god will be on the way
[36:08] all right just don't ever let go of that
[36:09] don't ever let go of anything that god's
[36:11] given you
[36:13] it's not immaterial to him nothing is
[36:15] immaterial
[36:17] sometimes he'll ask me some questions
[36:18] and i'll say oh tim you shouldn't know
[36:19] that or he asked me something and i'll
[36:20] get on to him but that's okay
[36:22] it's all right it's a learning
[36:23] experience right it's a learning
[36:25] experience
[36:27] for all of us just don't
[36:31] go backwards god never goes back
[36:34] he progressed from luther wesley
[36:36] pentecost to the end of the age
[36:38] and then we're going to progress on to
[36:39] the coming of the lord don't ever stop
[36:42] okay all right lord bless you keep that
[36:44] with you pray for us as we
[36:48] travel
