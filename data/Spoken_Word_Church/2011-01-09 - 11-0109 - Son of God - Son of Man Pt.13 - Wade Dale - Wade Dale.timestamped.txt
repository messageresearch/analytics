[0:01] Hebrews chapter 2. Morning everyone.
[0:06] Hebrews chapter
[0:09] 2. The sound's not off this morning.
[0:12] Just my voice.
[0:16] But it'll be okay.
[0:22] Mr. G me some coding so I can sleep
[0:24] through
[0:28] service. some kind of co. Well, I
[0:31] couldn't sleep this morning, so I'll
[0:32] probably now that I'm in charge.
[0:39] The way it works. Yeah. All right.
[0:41] Hebrews chapter 2. And what we're going
[0:43] to finish up today with is we're going
[0:46] to look at uh there's only one mention
[0:50] of the son of
[0:51] man in this aspect by Paul. Paul being
[0:55] the prophet of the age
[0:58] would have had
[0:59] a better understanding. I would assume
[1:03] that uh Who's our visitor?
[1:07] Who's our visitor? Oh, that's my sister,
[1:09] Gloria. Hello, my sister. Hi, Gloria.
[1:13] I say it's your younger sister, that's
[1:15] for sure.
[1:20] You're so sweet.
[1:24] Okay. But she's taller, so she's older,
[1:27] right, Kevin?
[1:32] You always thought was older than me.
[1:38] She thought was older than me cuz we're
[1:40] taller.
[1:45] But we come to the time of Paul.
[1:49] God has already come on earth in human
[1:51] flesh as the son of
[1:53] man. He's already um died. The son of
[1:58] man died. The son of God cannot die. So
[2:01] the son of man
[2:03] died. Jesus asked Peter said, "Peter,
[2:07] who do you say I did I the son of man
[2:09] am?" And Peter said, "Thou art the
[2:10] Christ, son of the living God." In other
[2:12] words, the creator god. That's not the
[2:14] son of man. Son of man is not the
[2:15] creator God. The son of God is the
[2:17] creator God.
[2:19] So Jesus, he didn't, you know, he didn't
[2:22] answer the question, right? But Jesus
[2:24] says, "Okay, in other words, I'll build
[2:25] my church on that, on your revelation
[2:28] that I am the creator God, the son of
[2:31] God." But you're not going to really
[2:33] understand this man that's standing
[2:35] here, the son of man, until the end
[2:38] time. Because in Matthew 17, we read it
[2:42] a while back where Jesus coming off the
[2:44] mountain and television to no man till
[2:46] the son of man be risen again. Now see,
[2:48] the son of man rose the first time here
[2:51] in the Bible. Son of man's going to
[2:53] raise the second time in his people in
[2:55] an end time bride. All
[2:58] right? So he rose the first
[3:00] time and now he's risen again from the
[3:04] dead. In other words, brother Rom said
[3:06] dead works. And that's exactly what it
[3:08] is.
[3:09] So the the son of God, most
[3:14] people, it's like we were talking
[3:16] somebody the other day that most people
[3:18] will
[3:19] see
[3:21] that Jesus was almighty God, but they'll
[3:23] make him a second
[3:25] person. Okay? All your denominations,
[3:28] they cannot figure out that that was
[3:30] Almighty God himself. Like Aaron was
[3:33] saying Wednesday night, the very essence
[3:35] of
[3:37] God. They only see that Jesus died for
[3:41] their
[3:44] sins. There's a man came on earth that
[3:47] God
[3:48] indwelled and that man
[3:50] died so that he can save the world from
[3:53] the sins. for John 3:16, for God so
[3:56] loved the world that he gave his only
[3:57] begotten son that that whosoever
[3:59] believeth in him should not perish but
[4:00] have eternal life or everlasting life.
[4:03] And they hold on to
[4:05] that, but it's a requirement in this day
[4:08] and that's enough to get you in the body
[4:10] of Christ and enough to get people into
[4:13] these into the church ages and get them
[4:15] born again under the ministry of the
[4:16] age. But there's no other age past this
[4:19] age we're in right now.
[4:21] So there's a requirement. Not that we
[4:23] still believe in the son of God and and
[4:26] then that becomes eroded and then
[4:28] there's another messenger going to pick
[4:30] that up and raise it up again. That's
[4:32] not what's going to happen because what
[4:34] happened in the church ages, Paul's
[4:36] message came. He came at the end of the
[4:38] Pentecostal age and he brought his
[4:39] message to Ephesus. At the end of
[4:42] Ephesus, they started getting away from
[4:44] Paul's teaching. So God sent Irenus. God
[4:47] sent Irene. And then when I come to the
[4:50] Samaran age, Irenus died, went off the
[4:54] scene, his people picked the message up
[4:56] and then they started eroding the
[4:57] message and then God send sent Martin to
[5:00] raise it back up again. So you see how
[5:02] it goes up and down. But now in the end
[5:06] time after this Pentecostal age come the
[5:10] word got eat down so fast and so hard
[5:13] till brother Ram come on the scene to
[5:15] restore the church back to the book of
[5:18] Ephesus or the Ephesian church age. But
[5:21] that wasn't all because he wasn't
[5:23] depending on another messenger a human
[5:26] messenger because there's only seven and
[5:28] he was seven. So there's only
[5:30] seven to bring
[5:33] about the revelation of the son of god.
[5:37] So brother random like brother Dale said
[5:38] the other day had to do two things. He
[5:40] had to restore the faith of the fathers
[5:42] which is what Paul had restore her back
[5:45] to
[5:46] that. Then he preached his message from
[5:48] 63 to 65. He preached a message that God
[5:52] gave him to preach to take the church on
[5:55] to the revelation of the son of man that
[5:57] God would be back in human flesh again.
[5:59] God showing that he would use a flesh
[6:02] like William Brandom. use that flesh to
[6:05] come on the scene and to tell the people
[6:07] the thoughts and intents of their heart
[6:09] to um tell them about their sin and then
[6:12] to open up the word of God like it had
[6:15] never been opened
[6:17] before cuz Jesus said he said tell the
[6:19] vision to no one till the son of man be
[6:21] risen again. I know we've read it and
[6:24] y'all all know where it's at, but let's
[6:27] just read it for some of you that maybe
[6:28] maybe are new. Let's uh let's read that.
[6:33] Matthew
[6:39] 17 cuz this is the way you have to read
[6:41] the Bible. Can't read the Bible like a
[6:47] newspaper. Roll the hidden nuggets in
[6:49] there like we were talking about last
[6:50] night when Ryan was talking about the
[6:52] trees in the
[6:54] garden. Jesus uh God said you can eat of
[6:56] all the trees of the fruit of the
[6:58] garden.
[7:00] The tree in the midst of the garden of
[7:02] good and evil you're not supposed to eat
[7:03] from. That's in the same verse. Well,
[7:05] that tree of knowledge of good and evil
[7:07] was not a little tree that grew up out
[7:08] of the ground.
[7:11] It was Satan,
[7:12] right? So, he wasn't talking about
[7:15] natural trees cuz you go on a little bit
[7:17] further in the chapter and he says of
[7:19] all the trees you can eat and like daddy
[7:22] said, he did say you couldn't eat from
[7:23] the tree of life. He said you couldn't
[7:25] eat from the tree of knowledge of good
[7:26] and evil, which was the person, right?
[7:29] Because in the book of Psalms in a
[7:31] metaphor, it talks about people being as
[7:34] trees. All
[7:36] right. Now, chapter
[7:39] 17, Jesus goes up on the mountain. He's
[7:41] transfigured. He He comes to his
[7:44] adoption. He's glorified. Moses and
[7:46] Elijah comes and talks to
[7:48] him. And then God speaks out of the
[7:51] cloud, "Hear ye him." Now, verse eight,
[7:54] when they lifted up their eyes, they saw
[7:56] no man save Jesus only.
[7:59] And they came down from the mountain.
[8:00] Jesus charged him,
[8:03] saying, "Tell the vision to no man until
[8:08] the son of man," not the son of God,
[8:10] "till the son of man be risen again."
[8:14] What is the son of man? The word made
[8:16] flesh. The son of God is the creator
[8:19] God, the spirit God, the Holy Ghost, the
[8:22] Christ, all those things you want to
[8:24] say. That's what the son of God is. But
[8:26] the son of man is that same son of God
[8:30] in human flesh.
[8:32] And his disciple was on television to no
[8:35] man until the son of man be risen again
[8:39] from the dead. And on the rising of the
[8:41] sun, brother Ram says that happens at
[8:43] the end time. Right? And his disciples
[8:46] asked him saying, why then say the
[8:49] scribes did Elias or Elijah? They knew
[8:51] it. They even know now the Jews are
[8:53] looking for Elijah to come back. They
[8:56] know Elijah has to come before Jesus
[8:59] Christ or before, sorry, know Jesus
[9:01] before the Messiah comes, their Messiah,
[9:04] right? They have no clue until Elijah
[9:07] comes. Even when they do all the things,
[9:08] remember we went through the feast days.
[9:10] They set a cup for Elijah and they set a
[9:12] door open for Elijah. They actually go
[9:14] out the door and look for Elijah to come
[9:15] in. So, they know when he comes in and
[9:17] sets down that the Messiah is coming.
[9:19] Well, see, they're going to miss. They
[9:20] missed that first part. Elijah is going
[9:23] to come. M the Elijah and the two
[9:26] prophets is going to come over there.
[9:28] That's how it's going to be so easy for
[9:30] three and a half years for them to
[9:31] accept that cuz man, there's their two
[9:33] pro biggest prophets.
[9:36] When we were in Israel, you know, I
[9:38] never nobody ever told me that Elijah
[9:41] had to come because I never read it or
[9:42] whatever. But our guide, he said he
[9:45] believed brother Brandham was that
[9:47] Elijah that had to come to the Jews.
[9:49] Now, he didn't believe what he said or
[9:51] anything, right? But he believed because
[9:54] he said that Elijah for must come first.
[9:58] He said that could possibly be brother
[10:00] Brown, right? He just missed that part
[10:03] because he didn't believe in a Messiah
[10:05] that brother Brandon was preaching.
[10:06] That's why he didn't couldn't believe
[10:07] what he said. If he believed what he
[10:09] said, he have to be Jesus Messiah and
[10:11] they missed him. They wouldn't be,
[10:12] right?
[10:15] And Jesus answered and said unto them,
[10:17] verse 11, "Elots truly shall first come
[10:21] and restore all things."
[10:24] Period. Now, let's back up. And his
[10:26] disciples asked him, saying, "Why
[10:29] then say the scribes that Elias must
[10:32] first come?" And Jesus answered unto
[10:34] them, "A Elias truly shall." What is
[10:37] shall a future event?
[10:41] Okay. The snow shall come tomorrow.
[10:46] Future event.
[10:48] I gota try to get word.
[10:52] Elijah truly shall first come
[10:55] and restore all things. And that's what
[10:57] did did John the Baptist do that? No.
[11:01] John the Baptist did not restore
[11:02] anything except the faith of the Old
[11:05] Testament fathers to the New Testament
[11:08] children. So that's what Malachi 4 is.
[11:12] But then Paul John says, "I'm the voice
[11:15] of one crying in the wilderness." So
[11:16] they if they were to read the scripture
[11:18] in the Old Testament, they'd assume that
[11:19] John had come before Jesus first coming.
[11:22] So when Elijah has to come before Jesus
[11:24] the second coming, they just missed the
[11:25] first coming. So they're going to get
[11:27] the second coming, which will be the
[11:29] first coming to them. Kind of confusing,
[11:32] but the Jews missed him the first time.
[11:35] They're going to actually get him the
[11:36] second time. All right? because that's
[11:38] over in Ezekiel and places like that in
[11:41] Jeremiah because they say, "Where did
[11:42] you get those scars?" They're going to
[11:44] see Jesus Christ through Elijah and
[11:47] Moses through two prophets in
[11:50] Israel, they're going to see Jesus so
[11:52] plain then till till they're going to
[11:55] know they missed him. Cuz just like
[11:56] Reuben, if that Elijah shows up on the
[11:59] scene and they start doing signs and
[12:00] wonders and miracles, they know one
[12:02] thing's for sure, the Messiah's coming.
[12:04] But when they turn and tell them, say,
[12:06] "Look, you missed that Messiah and start
[12:09] opening the word up to them," then
[12:12] they're going to, that's why they're
[12:13] going to go in their homes and weep and
[12:15] whail cuz they'll know that they're in
[12:16] trouble, right? But he's going to say,
[12:19] "No, I'm sorry. I mean, I, you know,
[12:22] don't be sorrow. Don't be
[12:24] sorrowful. I've come back to get you."
[12:26] In other words, cuz I'll never forget
[12:28] Israel. He said, he said, "I'll never
[12:29] forget them. Doesn't matter what they
[12:30] do. I'm going to save 144,000 regardless
[12:33] of whether they want me or not, but I'm
[12:35] gonna send two prophets and they're
[12:36] going to accept me. But they're going to
[12:39] show them. That's why the other Jews are
[12:42] going to be so mad at that 144,000.
[12:45] Mhm. Cuz maybe they'll see Elijah
[12:47] standing there and they said, "Well, we
[12:49] got the Messiah coming and they're going
[12:50] to start turn and look at them and say,
[12:52] "You missed it. He's already come and
[12:55] you didn't know what you know, you
[12:56] didn't know what he what he was doing
[12:58] when he got there.
[13:01] I love that verse because if anybody has
[13:03] a tiny desire to learn about the truth
[13:06] in the scripture, this points to brother
[13:09] Brown's message. Sure. Oh, absolutely.
[13:11] You know, right? And it said, "Restore
[13:13] all things." See, brother Ram's message
[13:16] restored all things. get restored back
[13:18] to that son of man. Cuz Jesus knew after
[13:21] he saw from Moses and Elijah about his
[13:24] his coming, his, you know, his death,
[13:26] burial, resurrection, and his second
[13:29] coming. He knew then that that Elijah
[13:33] that was standing there in John the
[13:35] Baptist was not going to be the next,
[13:38] you know, he was just going, the son of
[13:39] man was going to die, but he wasn't
[13:41] going to die again right there and and
[13:43] John the Baptist be there both because
[13:44] John the Baptist was already dead. So he
[13:47] knew there had to be another. Elias
[13:49] truly shall first come and restore all
[13:52] things. So he was pointing to a future
[13:54] event. But now if you read this just
[13:57] with a newspaper knowledge, let's just
[14:00] read it with a newspaper knowledge. And
[14:02] Jesus answer said to me, Elijah truly
[14:03] shall first come restore all things. But
[14:05] I say to you that Elijah has come
[14:07] already.
[14:12] If I'm standing there listening to him
[14:13] and didn't have just to read back over
[14:15] again or the Holy Ghost to reveal that,
[14:17] I'd say, well, he's talking about John.
[14:20] But he said that Elias is come
[14:24] already. Capital letter that Elias,
[14:27] right? What in John the Baptist had come
[14:32] already, and they knew him not, but have
[14:34] done unto him whatsoever they listed.
[14:36] Likewise shall also the son of man
[14:38] suffer of them.
[14:41] Now the the son of man was not
[14:43] physically killed the second time. He
[14:46] was spiritually killed the second time
[14:49] cuz you didn't you know Jesus when he
[14:50] went and ascended and sent the Holy
[14:52] Ghost back. He didn't come back in human
[14:55] flesh. He won't be back in human flesh
[14:56] until the millennium. But what happened
[14:58] down through the church ages? He was
[15:01] spiritually. It was spiritual death that
[15:02] came over the people. That's why the son
[15:04] of man rose one time physically.
[15:07] He's rising the second time physically
[15:09] in me and you. But it's a spiritual
[15:11] application because Jesus told him, he
[15:13] said, "You won't see me no
[15:15] more. But I'll be with you even in you
[15:17] till the end of the world." So, so the
[15:19] world's going to see Jesus Christ, but
[15:20] they're going to see him through
[15:22] us. Then the disciples understood that
[15:25] he spake unto them of John the Baptist.
[15:26] Now, if you read that just like a story,
[15:29] just like a newspaper, you think, "Well,
[15:32] man, that whole scripture is about John
[15:33] the Baptist." But it's not. Truly Elias
[15:36] shall come and restore all things.
[15:38] Period. That thought's done. Right?
[15:41] Talking about a future event. Then he
[15:44] backs up. But I say unto you that Elias
[15:46] has come already. What? The spirit and
[15:48] power of Elijah.
[15:50] The five times he's coming. Elijah,
[15:52] Elisha, John the Baptist, brother
[15:54] Brandham, and the one going to the Jews.
[15:56] That's the five
[15:57] times. And he knew that John the Baptist
[16:00] was already gone. So the son of man
[16:03] risen again in the end time. Mhm.
[16:06] Right. Not doing away with the son of
[16:09] God, but the son of God is going to have
[16:12] to do a work just like he did it with
[16:15] that son of man.
[16:17] Cuz I go back to the scripture, all
[16:19] power in heaven and earth been given
[16:20] unto me. What was it? It was a man
[16:22] standing in human flesh that had all the
[16:25] power of the universe in his body.
[16:27] Right?
[16:28] In that body of flesh. Because that was
[16:31] after the resurrection when he said
[16:32] that. Then he was seen of of 500
[16:35] brethren. He was seen for 30, 40 days.
[16:38] He walked through wall, but yet he could
[16:39] eat fish and it wouldn't, you know, it
[16:42] wasn't like Casper the friendly ghost.
[16:44] You know, he had material you could you
[16:47] could touch him cuz remember Thomas
[16:49] Thomas touched him touched my So he
[16:52] touch when he touched when Thomas
[16:53] touched him his hand didn't go through
[16:55] him. He was showing them one thing that
[16:58] he had come back in his full power,
[17:00] right? Because remember, they saw him as
[17:03] the son of man walking on the earth with
[17:06] a lot of problems.
[17:08] A lot of heartaches and trials. Couldn't
[17:10] even heal people in his own city. That's
[17:13] what the scripture says. Said he had to
[17:15] go outside the city to heal the people
[17:17] cuz people inside thought he was just
[17:18] Jesus, that old carpenter boy, Joseph's
[17:21] illegitimate son. and and sure he might
[17:24] have a little bit of an anointing on him
[17:26] because remember what Galia said? He
[17:28] said, "Don't you remember that guy that
[17:29] walked through here and got 400 people
[17:30] and took him out in the desert?" He
[17:32] said, "We never heard no more from him."
[17:34] He said, he said it was the Messiah. He
[17:36] said, "Well, if if he be the same man,"
[17:38] he said, "It's not going to hurt us." He
[17:40] said, "But if that man be of God,"
[17:41] that's why brother Brown said, "Go be
[17:43] given eternal life." It's because Gia
[17:45] said, "If that be God, we shouldn't
[17:48] fight against him." Right? So he said if
[17:50] that be the man that walks out there in
[17:52] the desert, let him go. He didn't bother
[17:54] us to start with. But if that man's the
[17:56] son of God, we're in trouble. In other
[17:58] words, if we if we go against that man.
[18:02] So that's what Kai I mean not Kyus, but
[18:06] Gia did to
[18:08] uh stand up for the Lord. But now let's
[18:11] go to
[18:17] uh where Hebrews
[18:23] 2 cuz nobody really got the revelation
[18:26] of the son of man. And listen, it's a
[18:29] fine line, folks, because it was God in
[18:31] human flesh all down through the church
[18:33] age.
[18:35] God, the son of God, was born again into
[18:38] a a man named Martin. And he did great
[18:41] signs and wonders. That was the son of
[18:45] man doing a work through a person named
[18:48] Martin. But the full word wasn't
[18:50] restored. Remember Jesus said all things
[18:53] had to be restored by this Elijah. So
[18:56] there was no way through these church
[18:58] ages until this Elijah come. There was
[19:00] no way just for what because of what
[19:03] Jesus said. There was no way that all
[19:06] things could be
[19:07] restored because see when Elijah
[19:09] restores all things in the end time
[19:11] there's no more church age. What did
[19:13] Martin and Luther and Columba and all
[19:15] those people what they do? They restored
[19:16] the people to a degree from the
[19:19] Catholicism of the Catholic Church.
[19:21] Luther raised them up to the just shall
[19:22] live by faith and still smoke the pipe
[19:25] and drank
[19:27] beer. Wesley comes along and says
[19:29] there's got to be more to it than that.
[19:32] Let's do away with the beer and the
[19:35] cigarettes. In other words, modern time.
[19:38] And let's raise it up to a sanctified
[19:39] condition where God's going to clean.
[19:41] Well, that was the Holy Ghost for their
[19:42] time. But it didn't do it didn't still
[19:44] didn't do a lot for this body. Then the
[19:46] Holy Ghost comes in and on the Isuza
[19:48] Street and baptizes the people with the
[19:50] Holy Ghost. Brings the gifts back into
[19:52] the church to get the church
[19:54] straightened out to a degree.
[19:57] But from
[19:59] 1906 to 19 and
[20:03] 33 when brother random when on the Ohio
[20:05] River when the angel came down says as
[20:08] your as John the Baptist message for the
[20:10] first coming your message the forun
[20:11] second coming from there to 1933 brother
[20:14] Random said they fell off real fast. He
[20:16] remember he told them in about middle
[20:18] 50s he said you Pentecostals he said
[20:20] another 20 years he said it took the
[20:22] Catholic church 2,000 years to get this
[20:23] bad. He said you'll be that bad in 20
[20:25] years and they are now. You can't tell a
[20:27] Pentecostal from a from a street walker
[20:29] most of the time. And that's what
[20:31] happened when you turn the word down.
[20:33] But but they didn't turn the word down
[20:35] to the degree you think where they all
[20:37] just well it was all false and they all
[20:39] went to hell. No, they was true truly FF
[20:43] Bosworth and all those people that come
[20:44] up during that time. They were born
[20:46] again believers but they were still
[20:48] carrying the trin trinitarian doctrine.
[20:51] They were still being baptized in name,
[20:52] father, son, holy ghost. Their word had
[20:54] not been fully restored. The son of man
[20:56] can't come back until that word was
[20:59] fully restored back to where Jesus was
[21:01] standing at that day coming off the
[21:04] mount. Okay? Cuz he said Elish truly
[21:07] must come and restore all things.
[21:10] Telling them that the son of man will be
[21:12] risen again when that man comes on the
[21:14] scene and restores all things. Brother
[21:17] Brandham was not the embodiment of the
[21:19] son of man. He was a son of man
[21:21] revealing the son of man which was the
[21:23] Lord Jesus Christ.
[21:26] But he came so much in that body till he
[21:28] spoke out one day and said, "This is not
[21:30] William Brandon's voice." But yet it
[21:31] was. You can't tell the difference in
[21:34] that tape, was it? You know, it didn't
[21:35] come out like God's voice. Everybody
[21:36] thinks it's some booming, you know, like
[21:38] a big old man's voice, you know, like uh
[21:41] James Earl Jones or something, you know.
[21:43] No, it was William Brham's voice. He he
[21:45] was just speaking speaking speaking. All
[21:47] of a sudden, he said, "This is not the
[21:49] voice of William Brandon. I'm just using
[21:51] his voice, in other words, to speak to
[21:53] you." But it was still brother Brandham
[21:55] talking the whole time. And brother
[21:58] Random said the I was reading it the
[21:59] other day. He said, "I just yield myself
[22:01] and get out of the way." He comes down
[22:03] and he speak. Well, now you can't tell
[22:05] the difference
[22:06] when the anointing hits him. And when
[22:08] he's telling those people who they are
[22:09] and what they've been doing, and then it
[22:12] won't be 10 seconds later he'll say, "I
[22:14] don't know what I said, but whatever I
[22:16] said was the truth because it was him."
[22:19] Well, now on the tape, it was brother
[22:20] Ram's literal voice. It wasn't You
[22:22] understand? You understand what I'm
[22:24] saying?
[22:25] Cuz people in schizophrenics and pain
[22:27] people like that, they have different
[22:29] identities, personalities. They talk
[22:31] different. You know, they act different.
[22:32] The devil makes them act different. But
[22:34] now God is so much with this human part
[22:37] that we are
[22:39] now that like brother Dale today will be
[22:43] speaking the word of God. If we believe
[22:44] that's the word of God, then that's God
[22:46] speaking to us personally. That but he's
[22:47] using a a vessel to talk through, but
[22:50] he's not going to talk different. Right.
[22:52] Right. Exactly. He's not going to talk
[22:54] different. He's going to talk just like
[22:56] we talk.
[22:59] That's the son of man be truly risen
[23:01] again. Cuz see, everybody's looking for
[23:03] something out here. Denominations,
[23:04] they're they truly like brother Ram
[23:07] said, and I really didn't understand it
[23:08] till just a little while ago. But
[23:11] brother Ram said, the denominations
[23:12] can't get Jesus off the cross. And
[23:14] that's what they do. They know that
[23:15] Jesus died for their sins. They know he
[23:17] was up there on that cross. They know
[23:18] that they nailed him up there. They
[23:20] can't deny that because that's the basis
[23:21] of all Christianity.
[23:25] And then they say, "Okay, he died for
[23:27] our sin, but we're still going to live
[23:29] like this."
[23:32] So they can't get him off there into
[23:34] here. And they say, "Oh yeah, Jesus
[23:35] lives in my heart." But what are they
[23:36] depended on? They're dependent on that
[23:38] cross that he died. And sure, some of
[23:41] them, you know, you'd be given eternal
[23:44] life maybe for that stand. But to be a
[23:47] child of God or a son and daughter of
[23:49] God, you can't keep him on the cross. It
[23:51] never becomes real up there either. No.
[23:54] Well, it's just a it's just a story.
[23:56] It's a good story. Just a good story.
[23:59] Get people emotional.
[24:01] That's what Satan wants to do. He wants
[24:03] to get people emotional and sing and
[24:05] shout and worship and forget about the
[24:07] word of God. What the word of God said.
[24:09] What came to mind is um there's nothing
[24:12] new under the sun. the the preacher
[24:15] said,
[24:16] "And we Gentiles, we end up making the
[24:20] same mistakes that the Jewish people
[24:22] made. They couldn't take it that g that
[24:25] God was in Jesus, the flesh." And that's
[24:28] the same thing happening today. Sure.
[24:30] That Christ is the mystery of God
[24:32] revealed. That's right. In us and we'll
[24:35] end up making the same mistake and it's
[24:37] in us. Yeah. That's the biggest stumble,
[24:40] right? All right. Let's read what Paul
[24:42] said, brother. I'm sorry. I said the
[24:45] bride is the mystery of Christ now.
[24:46] Exactly. That's right. That's why Jesus
[24:49] said, "The world will see me no more."
[24:51] In other words, after this day, the
[24:54] world will never see my face until
[24:56] judgment.
[24:58] That's what he was saying. Though this
[25:01] world that you're living in will not see
[25:03] me in this form, right, until the day of
[25:08] judgment. But now you'll see me
[25:11] for I'll be with you even in you and see
[25:15] see means to understand. See don't mean
[25:17] to literally look at something as so
[25:20] much but it is but still see means to
[25:22] understand that man and nobody really
[25:25] understood that man. Even the Apostle
[25:27] Paul didn't truly understand all of God
[25:30] because look, chapter
[25:33] 2, verse, let's just read the whole
[25:36] thing down to about
[25:38] level. Therefore, we ought to give the
[25:40] more earnest heed to the things which we
[25:42] have heard, lest at any time we should
[25:45] let them slip. For if the word spoken by
[25:48] angels was steadfast, and every
[25:50] transgression and disobedience received
[25:52] a just recompense of reward, how shall
[25:54] we escape if we neglect so great
[25:58] salvation which at the first began to be
[26:01] spoken by the Lord and was confirmed
[26:02] unto us by them that heard him. Because
[26:05] remember, Apostle Paul didn't hear it
[26:06] literally hear Jesus speak. But Paul
[26:09] saying he heard it through Peter and
[26:11] Paul I mean Peter and and James and John
[26:13] and all those people.
[26:16] God also bearing them witness both with
[26:18] signs and wonders and with many miracles
[26:20] and gifts of the Holy Ghost according to
[26:22] his own will. He asked him the question,
[26:24] "How shall we escape if we neglect so
[26:26] great a salvation? For unto the angels
[26:29] hath he not put in subjection the world
[26:31] to
[26:32] come, whereof we
[26:35] speak." But one in a certain place
[26:38] testified, saying, "What is man that
[26:40] thou art mindful of him?" Now that's in
[26:43] Psalms 84-6. So that was David. What is
[26:47] man that thou mindful of him? Are the
[26:49] son of man that thou visitth
[26:52] him? Thou mst him a little lower than
[26:55] the angel. Thou crownest him with glory
[26:57] and honor and didest set him over the
[26:59] works of thy hand. Thou hast put all
[27:02] things in subjection under his
[27:06] feet. Who? Son of
[27:08] man. For in that he put all in
[27:11] subjection under him, he left nothing
[27:13] that was not put under him. Matthew told
[27:16] him, I would say, I'm just going to
[27:18] assume that Matthew said, I heard Jesus
[27:21] say, "All power in heaven and earth has
[27:22] been given unto me at the resurrection."
[27:24] Cuz that's what Matthew wrote down,
[27:27] right? But now we see not yet all things
[27:31] put under him.
[27:36] Now, we see death put under his feet
[27:38] because of what he done. But we don't
[27:40] see all things put under him. It's not
[27:42] that God got less. God stayed where he
[27:44] was at. God's never changed. Remember
[27:47] what we've been trying to say. It's us
[27:49] looking to God and him revealing what he
[27:53] is, not what he's going to be or the
[27:56] thoughts of our mind. Right? He left
[27:59] nothing that is not put under him.
[28:02] But now we
[28:05] see not yet all things put under him
[28:08] because Paul was still looking at people
[28:10] dying. So we knew that all things were
[28:14] were put under Jesus's feet, but we
[28:16] don't see all things put under his feet.
[28:18] Okay, everybody understand that? We I
[28:20] underlined that word we. Now we see not
[28:24] yet all things put under his feet. But
[28:26] now what did he say being a prophet in
[28:28] verse 9? But we see Jesus.
[28:32] See, he knew to look toward that
[28:35] man who was made a little lower than the
[28:37] angels for the suffering of death,
[28:39] crowned with glory and honor, that he
[28:41] may by the grace of God should taste
[28:43] death for every man. For it became him
[28:46] for whom are all things and by whom are
[28:49] all things, and bringing many sons unto
[28:52] glory, talking about himself, and all
[28:53] the sons and daughters of God, to make
[28:56] the captain of their salvation perfect
[28:58] through suffering.
[29:00] That's what happened to Jesus because
[29:02] what? Look at the next thing he says.
[29:05] For both he that sanctifith and they who
[29:08] are sanctified are all of one.
[29:12] Paul knew that man was a human being
[29:15] that God had come down in human flesh
[29:18] some way and become a
[29:20] man. And I say some way just to give you
[29:23] because Paul probably had a better
[29:25] understanding. But we got to look back
[29:26] to what Paul was looking at. He said we
[29:29] He said Jesus we know was everything put
[29:31] under but we don't see all things put
[29:32] under cuz he look around see people
[29:34] dying. He'd look around see people sick
[29:37] but he knew that the power of the
[29:38] resurrection was inside of them cuz they
[29:41] were going about doing signs and wonders
[29:42] like he said over here in verse three or
[29:45] four. For both he that sanctifith and
[29:48] they that are sanctified are all of one.
[29:51] For which cause he is not ashamed to
[29:54] call them brethren.
[29:59] And you can keep reading on down a
[30:01] little
[30:03] further. Verse 16 sums it all up. He
[30:05] took on him the seed of Abraham. That
[30:07] was the promised
[30:09] son. So Paul is looking at this
[30:14] man, not understanding the
[30:18] complete whole part of the son of man.
[30:21] I'm sure Paul had gifts in his life. Uh
[30:24] we saw where he rebuked people and he
[30:26] would cast out devils and do the things
[30:28] like that. But I don't know that
[30:31] Paul had the ministry like brother
[30:33] Brandham as far as the discerning of the
[30:35] thoughts and intents of the heart. Cuz
[30:36] that's left for for Jesus did that.
[30:39] Remember he said Simon. He said uh um
[30:41] who was it? One of them said where did
[30:43] you see me? He said well I saw you
[30:45] before you know Nathaniel around side of
[30:48] the mountain. You were all praying over
[30:49] there
[30:50] Philip. I don't know. And I just in my
[30:53] own personal
[30:55] ability, there's no way Paul had the
[30:58] same revelation that Brother Brandham
[31:00] did. Now, there's people in the message,
[31:02] I've heard him preach it, that Paul had
[31:04] the same revelation that Brother
[31:05] Brandham had. He just didn't give it
[31:07] out. I just don't I just don't believe
[31:09] that. I believe that even in the book of
[31:13] Daniel, God told him to seal those
[31:15] things up until the time of the end.
[31:18] Now, Paul was not the time of the end.
[31:20] Paul was the beginning. That's right.
[31:22] Now, we know the alpha and omega's got
[31:24] to be the same. But see, Paul had a had
[31:27] a had a position down through the church
[31:29] ages. They held it for a little while,
[31:31] but then it went down. And then Luther
[31:33] and Wesley brought it back up to about
[31:35] right here. So, Brother Brandham had to
[31:36] bring it to where it was right here.
[31:38] Well, that was 47 to 62 or somewhere in
[31:41] there, right? Correct. Because he had
[31:43] the faith of the fathers, right? So,
[31:44] brother Brandham brought it back to
[31:46] that. Well, if he would have stayed at
[31:47] that, then it would have just people
[31:48] just kept on dying. That's why Paul says
[31:50] we don't see all things but we see
[31:51] Jesus. In other words, we see people
[31:53] dying. But when brother Brandham came to
[31:54] right here and the revelation of those
[31:56] seals came, brother Brandham's
[31:58] revelation came up to here. The
[31:59] revelation of the son of man. Paul did
[32:02] not have the revelation of the son of
[32:04] man. Now he knew this man was in human
[32:06] flesh doing the good works and being,
[32:09] you know, being the one the captain of
[32:10] our salvation.
[32:12] But I just don't believe Paul had a
[32:14] ministry like brother Bham did. I just
[32:17] Brother Ram had to go beyond that. He
[32:19] saw through a glass dark but committed
[32:22] that. Sure. And I believe maybe Paul
[32:24] maybe looked down through time as a
[32:26] prophet. He would go up and look cuz he
[32:29] went to the third heaven. So So he was
[32:31] able to go into another dimension. But I
[32:34] don't think he I'm like you. I think he
[32:36] looked down through the church ages and
[32:38] it just got kind of blurry down at the
[32:40] end. He said, "I looked through the last
[32:42] darkling." But see when brother Brandham
[32:45] come all things were made clear cuz what
[32:48] he was standing in that age that Paul
[32:50] saw from right here
[32:52] you know your eyes are real blurry until
[32:54] you get close and then you you know see
[32:55] things but u that's the whole part I
[32:59] want to end with and then maybe we'll
[33:01] pick something
[33:03] up. We may start in the
[33:05] seal and do it in a simple form, not in
[33:08] a not be
[33:10] so I guess like brother Jordan so
[33:13] technical about it, but we'll be kind of
[33:15] simple about it
[33:16] because Paul's here. Brother Brandham
[33:19] was here when he brought the faithful
[33:20] fathers back up to 62 somewhere in
[33:23] there. But see, brother Brandon brought
[33:25] a message that we've got to understand.
[33:28] Understanding Paul's message will get
[33:30] you in heaven, but it won't get you in a
[33:32] body chain. But this message up here
[33:35] will get you in a life change. Right? So
[33:37] we'll start that next week.
