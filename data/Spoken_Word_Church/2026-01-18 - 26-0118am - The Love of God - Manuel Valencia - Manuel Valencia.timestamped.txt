[0:00] Good morning, saints. God bless you.
[0:01] Praise the Lord.
[0:04] I have one opening scriptures if you can
[0:05] go to. It's Romans 5:5.
[0:09] While I get set up here.
[0:31] Need some help here with brothers? Cuz I
[0:32] think set
[0:37] need some help, brother. I think it has
[0:38] a different kind of connection here.
[0:42] Let's bow our heads as we're uh getting
[0:44] situated here. If you can help me out. I
[0:45] think it has a different extension this
[0:47] time.
[0:50] Heavenly Father, we're so grateful this
[0:52] morning, Lord, that you've given us such
[0:54] a precious truth, such a precious life,
[0:56] such a precious revelation, such a
[0:58] precious faith and in the love of God
[1:01] that shed about our hearts. Lord God, we
[1:03] ask that this morning you would set this
[1:05] time the time aside, Father, that you
[1:06] would um come speak to us, encourage us
[1:09] in in your Father, in your word.
[1:11] Encourage us in u as we pray for one
[1:13] another and encourage us, Lord God, as
[1:15] we um as we read these pages of Life
[1:18] Eternal. And I want to ask, Father, for
[1:20] a special song this morning, for a
[1:23] special continuation, Father, of the
[1:25] meetings that we've been having. And I
[1:27] pray that you will enign us eternally
[1:30] with your word as we turn these uh
[1:32] precious words of life in the name of
[1:33] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:37] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. So in Romans 5:5
[1:41] we have
[1:42] &gt;&gt; use this one.
[1:42] &gt;&gt; Can I use that one? Oh, it was just un
[1:45] unhook. There you go. Thank you,
[1:47] brother.
[1:49] We'll get to Appreciate it.
[1:53] Got number two there.
[1:59] And then
[2:01] I'm I'm at number two now. So we should
[2:03] be going.
[2:05] &gt;&gt; Okay. Very good.
[2:07] &gt;&gt; I think it's cuz the uh
[2:08] &gt;&gt; your display settings just keep
[2:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, just hang tight so we can uh
[2:13] go over the notes better.
[2:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. Went on. So in
[2:25] Romans 5:5 it says, "And hope maketh not
[2:28] ashamed because the love of God is shed
[2:32] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
[2:34] which is given unto us." And the title
[2:37] of this Sunday school lesson was going
[2:39] to be the the love of God. Amen. And
[2:42] particularly
[2:43] looking at uh in here it says that it
[2:45] was the love of God that's shed about on
[2:47] our hearts, but it is something that's
[2:49] given to us, right? And it is by the
[2:51] Holy Ghost. And that that's what gives
[2:53] us that hope that we that make it not
[2:55] ashamed. Amen. And we will look at
[2:57] topics such as the love of God towards
[2:59] us. And then we'll look at topics such
[3:01] as how we're commanded to love one
[3:04] another. And then we'll look also at um
[3:07] the wrong kind of love or erroneous
[3:09] love, a warning actually against the
[3:10] warning uh of the erroneous love. And
[3:13] then um and then uh a special subtopic
[3:17] about how faith that workketh by love.
[3:21] This one.
[3:22] &gt;&gt; It's this one, sir. Yeah. Got me set up.
[3:25] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[3:26] &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you very much.
[3:31] All righty. Thank you very much. So,
[3:38] we read that scripture. And here's what
[3:40] I said we were going to talk about is
[3:41] God loves towards us. God loves us. We
[3:43] love God. A warning against erroneous
[3:46] love. And how we are commanded to love
[3:48] one another. And then how faith that
[3:50] workketh by love. So that's what we'll
[3:52] be talking about
[3:53] when it comes to God's love towards us.
[3:55] Um I have a question. There's a question
[3:57] here. Behold, what manner of love? You
[4:00] know, just think about it. God is God,
[4:01] right? Like if you're an owner of
[4:04] something, if you're an owner of a store
[4:05] or landlord, you can be the owner of
[4:07] something, but it doesn't mean you have
[4:08] to love, right? You you could be the
[4:11] owner of something. So he could have
[4:13] been the owner of this universe or
[4:14] creator, right? In theory. But let's say
[4:18] that he didn't have love. So just think
[4:20] about it that way, right? Just think
[4:23] about, you know, how deep love goes and
[4:25] and how foundational it is that it
[4:28] starts with him and then he's given it
[4:30] to us first before he commens it. Right?
[4:32] So think about that question. What
[4:34] manner of love the father has bestowed
[4:38] upon us. It says here that we should be
[4:40] called the sons of God. So don't take it
[4:44] for granted that you're called the son
[4:46] of God because this is actually actually
[4:48] asking it in a connotation of do you
[4:51] know how much love you are when you are
[4:53] taken in as a son when you're taken in
[4:55] as a daughter. It's typifying there
[4:58] something.
[4:59] Therefore the world knoweth us not the
[5:02] believer because it knew him not. You
[5:06] see it takes it back to the first time
[5:08] the word love was mentioned in the Bible
[5:09] and that is in Genesis 22 verse two.
[5:13] And he said, "Take now thy son, thine
[5:16] only son Isaac, whom thou lovest." The
[5:19] first time the word love was mentioned.
[5:21] But you know what? That's typifying,
[5:22] right? And get thee into the land of
[5:25] Mariah, the mountain. Remember, and
[5:27] offer him therefore a burnt offering
[5:30] upon one of the mountains which I will
[5:33] tell thee of. A very selective mountain,
[5:35] right? But look here, right? For God so
[5:38] loved,
[5:40] right? So he he's the one we know that
[5:42] we took. So that that was a type, right?
[5:45] So Isaac loved I mean um Abraham Li
[5:48] loved Isaac, right? And that was a type.
[5:50] But we said about what manner of love is
[5:52] this? Well, that's the manner of love.
[5:53] It was
[5:55] for God. So he loved it so much is what
[5:58] that means that if he would have done an
[6:01] an act of love that would have been more
[6:03] worthy of saying I love you, he would
[6:05] have done it.
[6:06] &gt;&gt; So think about how much love that is.
[6:08] You know be called son. But another
[6:10] thing is to give your only begotten son.
[6:12] And I'll summarize some of the
[6:13] scriptures because I got plenty of them.
[6:15] In 1 John 3:16, pretty much a parallel
[6:18] there. See John 3:16, but here's 1 John
[6:20] 3:16 as well. It says, "Here I perceive
[6:23] we the love of God because he laid down
[6:27] his life for us."
[6:29] &gt;&gt; Same thing. And we ought to lay down our
[6:32] lives for the brethren. So, it's gonna
[6:35] get deep here shortly. So, buckle your
[6:36] seat belt on that. See 1 John 4:9 it
[6:39] says, "In this was manifested the love
[6:42] of God towards us because that God sent
[6:46] his only begotten son into the world
[6:48] that we might live through him again."
[6:52] So just manifestation of that love.
[6:53] Brother Brandham preached a few um
[6:57] messages on love. I think it was upward
[6:58] of nine if you search the word love and
[7:01] message titles and one of them was
[7:03] literally called love. Another one was
[7:04] called the projection of love and
[7:06] another one when divine love is
[7:07] projected
[7:09] &gt;&gt; right and we'll see them here in a
[7:10] little bit and there's another portion
[7:12] of that title but you see that is how
[7:15] God showed us that he loved us right and
[7:18] it's through the Bible in Proverbs 3:12
[7:20] says for whom the Lord loveth he
[7:22] correcteth even as a father the son you
[7:25] see the type here father son I Abraham
[7:27] loved Isaac in whom he delightth again
[7:30] as the father hath loved me so I love
[7:33] you continue ye in my love. That's 1
[7:37] John 15. Jesus speaking. Now speaking a
[7:40] little bit about wisdom in Proverbs
[7:42] particularly and we'll see later in
[7:43] Proverbs 8. Um that chapter is full of I
[7:46] call it the chapter of wisdom where
[7:47] wisdom itself is speaking like in the
[7:48] eye in the first person. And here's what
[7:51] it says. Get wisdom in in chapter 4
[7:53] Proverbs. Get understanding. Forget it
[7:56] not. Neither decline from the words of
[7:58] my mouth. Forsake her not. And she shall
[8:01] perserve thee. love her wisdom and she
[8:05] shall keep thee. And here it says now
[8:09] wisdom is speaking by me princes rule
[8:11] and nobles even all judges of the earth
[8:14] I love them that love me and those that
[8:17] seek me early shall find me riches and
[8:20] honor are with me. Yeah, durable riches
[8:23] and righteousness.
[8:25] And then on this one, John 14, Jesus
[8:27] spoke it. It this reminds me so much. My
[8:30] um my wife would tell his brother, "Do
[8:32] you love me, brother?" And he says,
[8:34] "Yeah." And he was like, "Keep my
[8:35] commandments."
[8:38] Kind of stuck to me. But, you know, it
[8:40] it makes you think, you know, it's a
[8:41] very strange thing. You know, you love
[8:42] me. Okay. Well, keep my commandments,
[8:44] right? But then, think about it though.
[8:46] He commanded his love towards us. And
[8:48] think about it. He commanded us to love,
[8:50] but he loved us first. So, he he he's
[8:52] he's being fair, right? He's not saying
[8:54] I'm going to challenge you to do
[8:56] something that you cannot do. Truly, we
[8:58] cannot do it without him. Right? But of
[9:00] course, it is the love of God. Right?
[9:02] That's the title of the message. In
[9:04] Proverbs 19, it says, "He that getth
[9:06] wisdom loveth his own soul. He that
[9:09] keepeth understanding shall find good."
[9:12] And we have here, "Who shall separate us
[9:14] from the love of Christ?" It's a portion
[9:16] of u the whole paragraph, right? It's
[9:19] only one verse. shall tribulation or
[9:20] distress, persecution or famine or naked
[9:22] or peril or sword. And it goes on to say
[9:24] life, death, angels, things be and
[9:26] things that were right. So, it's a
[9:30] pretty destined love. It's a pretty
[9:32] elected love. It's a love that, you
[9:34] know, has a purpose behind it. It it it
[9:37] accomplishes much as we'll see here
[9:39] through the scriptures here. And it is a
[9:41] fruit of the spirit, by the way. And you
[9:43] know what's something about it? You
[9:44] cannot put love in jail. Actually, it
[9:46] says here against these fruits, there's
[9:50] no law. So, it's not illegal to be to
[9:54] have joy, to have peace, longsuffering,
[9:57] gentleness, goodness, and faith. We'll
[9:59] see how faith and love work together
[10:01] here. Meekness, temperance, the fruits
[10:04] of the spirit. Against
[10:06] such there's no law. And that's a sermon
[10:09] in of itself there. It's just you can't
[10:11] you can't come against it. You may want
[10:13] to, but it's it's not going to it's not
[10:16] going to, you know, win in a court of
[10:17] law, right? Ephesians 1:4, according as
[10:21] he hath chosen us.
[10:25] So, see, love does this too. In him
[10:28] before the foundation of the world, that
[10:30] we should be holy and without blame
[10:32] before him in love. He chose us in love
[10:35] before the foundation of the world. In
[10:37] other words, in first second Timothy, we
[10:39] have for God hath not given us the
[10:41] spirit of fear. And we'll see right now
[10:43] a little bit about love and faith
[10:45] working and how, you know, fear has no
[10:48] space, but of power and of love. So,
[10:51] think about it. It's actually a spirit,
[10:53] right? You know, God is love. We know
[10:55] God's a spirit. So, you know, it's the
[10:57] fruit of the spirit.
[10:59] So, it's the spirit of love. It's God's
[11:02] spirit of love in you. And of a sound
[11:05] mind. Don't take that for granted in
[11:07] this day and age, right? I mean, in your
[11:10] human life, you may have things going
[11:12] many directions like that depiction that
[11:14] brother Luis showed, right, with a
[11:16] straight line, how people perceive their
[11:18] year is going to go and what the reality
[11:19] is and then how most people perceive
[11:21] what it is and then what it really is.
[11:23] One thing I like about this little
[11:25] diagram is that he had all kinds of
[11:26] arrows going every which way. But
[11:27] towards the end, he did have one over in
[11:29] the middle that did sneak out at the
[11:31] end. So, and they called it success, and
[11:33] that's reality. So you know with God's
[11:36] help right uh but having a sound mind
[11:39] having a you know a mind that can be
[11:42] settled on the things of God right and
[11:44] in Hebrews 126 it says for whom the Lord
[11:47] loveth he chasenneth and scores
[11:50] scorgeorgeth every son whom he receiveth
[11:54] right you know I heard it said many
[11:56] times you know when people say oh you
[11:57] know god doesn't correct you know bride
[11:58] or whatever you know but you're still a
[12:00] son of god we're a portion collectively
[12:02] of the bride of god So let's not use
[12:04] that as an excuse, right? I mean, we get
[12:07] corrected, right? And and it's out of
[12:09] love and you know it, right? And you
[12:11] know, and and we all know the statement,
[12:12] love is correct, right? But I think
[12:14] sometimes it can get overused in the
[12:17] with the hatred way, right? But of
[12:18] course, it's corrective, right? I mean,
[12:20] we correct our children. We correct each
[12:21] others, you know, as brothers, humans,
[12:24] and husbands, wives. But the idea here
[12:26] is that it it it has the right motive,
[12:29] especially when it's founded on the word
[12:31] of God. In Romans 5:6, I found these two
[12:33] verses are in parallel. And typically,
[12:34] the one at Romans 5'8 is very well well
[12:37] known, but I hadn't seen the parallel
[12:39] with two verses before that where it
[12:41] says, I'll read the 58 first. But God
[12:44] commandeth his love. Remember, he
[12:45] commanded it towards us. So, it's it's a
[12:48] commandment that he loves us too, not
[12:50] just you love too. I love you. He made
[12:53] his own commandment. He loves us in that
[12:56] while we were yet sinners, Christ died
[12:58] for us, right? Very familiar scripture.
[12:59] But look at the one above verse 6 same
[13:02] chapter. For when we were yet without
[13:05] strength. See how it correlates that
[13:08] being a sinner is you have no strength
[13:10] to live this walk. Right? In due time
[13:12] Christ died for the ungodly. Right? So
[13:16] see it's a very parallel scripture
[13:17] there. And I just thought it was very
[13:19] interesting how in other words he's
[13:21] shown us a love even we had no strength.
[13:23] Even when we were sinners Christ died
[13:25] for the ungodly. Christ died for the
[13:27] sinner. Right? predestined to before the
[13:30] foundation of the world. In Ephesians
[13:32] 2:4 to5, it says, "But God who is rich
[13:35] in mercy," and by the way, the word
[13:36] mercy, loving kindness, you know, we
[13:39] know there in charity, that's parallel
[13:40] to love in many cases. And you know,
[13:43] there's deeper words of agapea love,
[13:44] we'll go here in a little bit, but for
[13:47] his great love wherewith he loved. So
[13:49] that love with which he loved us even
[13:53] when we were dead again another parallel
[13:55] scriptures in sins hath quickened us
[13:57] together with Christ by grace you are
[14:00] saved. So three parallel scriptures
[14:02] right but all related to love as you see
[14:04] there in the word speaking on the love
[14:06] of God brother says revelations 3:19 as
[14:08] many as I love I rebuke and I and
[14:11] chasten be sellers therefore and repent
[14:13] but you see the purpose here it's not
[14:15] just meaningless correction or it's not
[14:17] meaningless rebuke
[14:19] you know if it's it's like the
[14:21] difference between a butcher right and
[14:22] the difference between a a surgeon you
[14:24] know they both cut they both cut flesh
[14:28] you know but one one cuts it just to cut
[14:30] and kill And but one caus it to to
[14:33] remove something a hindering and to
[14:34] heal, right? To allow God's healing
[14:37] process. And as we know in one places it
[14:40] says that it's a good thing to a
[14:43] righteous man will receive a rebuke.
[14:46] As many as I love, I rebuke and chasen
[14:48] two things. Besell therefore, and
[14:49] repent. That's the purpose is get right.
[14:52] 1 John 4:16. And we have known and
[14:55] believed. So that's the word, the word
[14:56] believe. That's faith, right? The love
[14:58] of God.
[15:00] that God hath to us. So we we believe
[15:03] that God that loved us, he loved us with
[15:05] God is love and he that dwelleth in love
[15:08] dwelleth in God and God in him. Amen. So
[15:12] now let's talk about us loving God.
[15:14] Scriptures that talk about us loving
[15:16] God. In Deuteronomy 6 five is where the
[15:19] commandment starts, right? Where it
[15:20] says, "And thou shalt love the Lord thy
[15:23] God with all thine heart, with all thy
[15:26] soul, and with all thy might." Right? So
[15:28] it's a commandment that he gave us
[15:30] remember but he showed his love towards
[15:32] us first and and in here I'll skip a few
[15:36] scriptures here it says that because so
[15:38] he hath set his love upon me therefore
[15:41] will I deliver him I will set him on
[15:44] high because he hath known my name and
[15:47] other places it says to those that love
[15:48] my name you know God loves a lot of
[15:51] things he says I love a cheerful giver
[15:53] he says uh Esau I hated but Jacob I
[15:55] loved amen so there's there's a lot
[15:58] things that we can see. He loves
[15:59] righteousness. He loves justice. I was
[16:02] reading scriptures as such. And um God
[16:04] loves um a lot of well he loves those
[16:06] that love him. He loves a believer. You
[16:08] know, in some places he said he loved
[16:09] the world, right? And in some places he
[16:12] says he loved us and Christ died for us
[16:13] even while we were sinners. Of course,
[16:15] because he knew what was going to come
[16:16] out of it, right? Before the foundation
[16:17] of the world. And it says Psalm 119.
[16:21] There's actually a lot of uh parallels
[16:22] here in the word love. And and I there's
[16:25] a lot of places of course in the Song of
[16:26] Songs, there's like love being mentioned
[16:29] 30 times there. Of course, the top love
[16:31] between the the the groom and the the
[16:34] bride there. It says, "Great peace have
[16:36] they which love thy law and nothing
[16:39] shall offend them." That's a good test
[16:41] right there, right? I mean, there's a
[16:43] lot of things that could offend
[16:44] sometimes, right? So um may but that
[16:48] says that love thy law you know may the
[16:50] Lord help us in the in Psalm 119 it
[16:52] talks a lot about thy precepts thy
[16:53] testimony thy word a standard you know
[16:56] all referring to God's word
[16:59] so love one another right let love be
[17:01] without dissimilation think about that
[17:04] don't love in secret in other words your
[17:06] brothers it says here let love be
[17:08] without assimilation abore that which is
[17:10] evil cleave to that which is good so
[17:14] don't Love one another, right, with
[17:16] dissimilation, right? In other words,
[17:18] love freely because as we'll see right
[17:20] now, there's a proverb that kind of hits
[17:22] it on the nail. Proverbs say a lot with
[17:24] just saying very little and it talks
[17:26] about that better is something else than
[17:28] love in secret. So, it's like really, I
[17:31] mean, love is good, right? But it's like
[17:33] there's something to that. It says here,
[17:38] love in Romans workketh no ill.
[17:41] Help us, Lord, right?
[17:44] to his neighbor.
[17:46] I think we all need help here. It says,
[17:48] "Therefore, love is the fulfilling of
[17:50] the law." This is a high standard, very
[17:53] high standard here. And it says in 2
[17:56] Timothy 4:8, "Henceforth there is laid
[17:59] up for me a crown of righteousness,
[18:02] which the Lord, the righteous judge,
[18:04] shall give me, and at the day, and not
[18:07] to me only, but unto all them that also
[18:11] love his appearing." Think about love
[18:13] his appearing.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; We've been we have a message, brothers,
[18:16] about his appearing. I think it and and
[18:20] God has given us the faith and the love,
[18:22] right? We love his appearing. We love
[18:24] what he's doing in this last age. We
[18:25] love what he's doing through all ages.
[18:27] But here we are now. And we love him
[18:29] because he first loved us. you know,
[18:30] when I first read this scripture, you
[18:32] know, fresh cold turkey coming out of u
[18:34] not, you know, living 20ome years
[18:36] without, you know, reading scriptures,
[18:40] it um it's one of those where like your
[18:42] flesh takes a little offense of that,
[18:44] right? Sometimes you want to be like,
[18:45] "No, I'm the one that see God. No, I'm
[18:47] the one that love God first." You know,
[18:50] it's like I'm the center of the
[18:51] universe. You know, things revolve
[18:54] around me. But
[18:58] that's how it is. We love him because he
[19:00] first loved us. And that that that says
[19:03] a lot right there, right? In other
[19:04] words, we're not even capable of loving
[19:07] him the way he loved us because it's
[19:08] it's a different kind of love as we
[19:10] know.
[19:11] &gt;&gt; 1 John 5:3, for this is the love of God.
[19:14] Pretty descriptive, right? Pretty
[19:15] definitive that we keep his
[19:17] commandments. And you know what? After
[19:18] all, his commandments are they're not
[19:20] grievious
[19:21] &gt;&gt; when you receive this Holy Spiven
[19:27] unto us. Yeah. So otherwise you don't
[19:29] get that love and and they're not
[19:31] grievious then the commandments, right?
[19:34] I mean if anything it's it's it's
[19:36] healing for you to surrender and to know
[19:39] that something wasn't right and the
[19:41] word, you know, the commandment of God
[19:43] um
[19:45] brought you to repentance. You know,
[19:46] there's a scripture that says that the
[19:47] love of God leads you to repentance. And
[19:49] in the King James, it it uses another
[19:51] word for the word love there. But uh
[19:54] many other translations, it says the
[19:56] love of God that leads us to repentance,
[19:58] right? And it says Jude 21, keep
[20:00] yourselves in the love of God, looking
[20:02] for the mercy and for the Lord Jesus
[20:05] Christ unto eternal life. So keep
[20:07] yourselves in the love of God. And you
[20:10] think about it is just
[20:13] it's you got to remember too, there's
[20:14] growth in the love of God. There's keep
[20:16] yourself. And there's some of the
[20:17] scriptures that you feel like, well,
[20:18] does that mean I don't love God? Well, I
[20:20] mean, it does say, you know, that it
[20:23] does say certain things about you have
[20:24] to see what it's saying, right? It's not
[20:26] saying you're going to hell, right? It's
[20:27] just saying that if you're not abiding,
[20:29] for example, right, in his love, then
[20:31] you may not get this. It don't mean you
[20:33] never love God or God never loved you
[20:34] and gave you, you know, the Holy Spirit.
[20:36] But it it just it's a remember those
[20:38] that I chasen and rebuke, you know, you
[20:40] know, I correct, those are the that are
[20:42] son of God, those that I love. Amen. So,
[20:45] warnings about erroneous love. Just take
[20:46] a little quick detour here about uh the
[20:49] erroneous love and then we'll start
[20:50] wrapping it up. So, Psalm 42, oh ye sons
[20:53] of men, how long will ye turn my glory
[20:56] into shame? How long will ye love
[20:58] vanity? So, it's obviously not the love
[21:00] of God, right?
[21:01] &gt;&gt; And seek after leasing, deceitful
[21:03] falsehood. Salah. First Timothy, it
[21:06] says, "For the love of money is the root
[21:09] of of all evil." And you know one one
[21:12] time a preacher stopping me because he
[21:14] says you know money is not the rule of
[21:15] all evil. And I'm like let me point you
[21:18] to the scripture brother you know as we
[21:20] know it says the love of money right and
[21:22] it's the love that's supposed to take
[21:24] God's place right as we'll see in
[21:25] another scripture which you can't serve
[21:27] two masters and it compares God and
[21:28] mammon. So which while some coveted
[21:31] after see it was not the right kind of
[21:32] love I think it got exposed there is
[21:35] covet they have ered from the faith. So
[21:40] see it's erroneous love and pierce
[21:42] themselves
[21:44] &gt;&gt; with many sorrows and help us. You know,
[21:46] there's things that happen to us in
[21:47] life, but there's things that we inflict
[21:48] upon ourselves.
[21:49] &gt;&gt; Right? And and again, it that's not
[21:52] saying you can't have, you know, we all
[21:54] need to have our means, but what that
[21:55] means is just don't love them above God.
[21:57] Right?
[21:58] &gt;&gt; And it says, "And he asked, see, there's
[22:00] three scriptures I bring about that
[22:01] little subtopic here 510, he that loveth
[22:05] silver shall not be satisfied with
[22:07] silver." See, because silver cannot
[22:09] satisfy what God's supposed to satisfy,
[22:12] nor he that loveth abundance with
[22:14] increase. So that that's one big term
[22:16] there. This is also vanity.
[22:18] &gt;&gt; So that's where he says that no man can
[22:20] serve two masters for either he will
[22:22] hate the one and love the other or else
[22:25] he will hold to the one and despise the
[22:28] other. See what happens. Ye cannot serve
[22:31] God and mammon and the flesh does not
[22:33] like that. I mean every time I read that
[22:35] scripture I just feel like right because
[22:37] I think you know it's
[22:39] &gt;&gt; it cuts. I mean
[22:41] &gt;&gt; it cuts.
[22:43] So it's the word of God is still true.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; In Psalm 52 3-4, thou love is evil. So
[22:49] the wrong kind of love we talk about
[22:51] more than good. So you know it says more
[22:53] than good. So there's a little bit of fo
[22:55] whatever what you want to call it love
[22:57] right of good and lying rather than
[22:59] speak righteousness. Sellah thou lovest
[23:03] all devouring words and thou deceitful
[23:06] tongue. It's talking about the tongue
[23:07] the evil tongue on this one. And
[23:09] concerning the wicked men it says as he
[23:10] loved cursing. Pretty strong words. So
[23:13] let it come unto him. So he delighted
[23:15] not on blessing. So let let it be far
[23:18] from him. The blessing. See, now of
[23:20] course that word love, you know,
[23:21] cursing, that's not agile love, right? A
[23:23] gopple of uh cursing, right? It's it's a
[23:25] heav. And there's many other words that
[23:27] are used for the word love. So in
[23:29] Proverbs 1, it says, "How long, ye
[23:31] simple ones, will ye love simplicity,
[23:33] and the scorners delight in their
[23:35] scorning, and fools hate knowledge and
[23:38] wisdom." Here talking about wisdom. But
[23:40] he that sinnth against me, wisdom
[23:42] speaking in the first person, wrongeth
[23:44] his own soul. Remember it says, he that
[23:46] loveth love me loveth his own soul. But
[23:49] here's the opposite. All they that hate
[23:51] me love death. This can't serve to
[23:54] masters.
[23:56] &gt;&gt; And here it's talking about that it's
[23:57] better to have a dinner with herbs. He
[24:00] imagines like, "Hey, I trade you a
[24:01] little bit of my spare money. Can I get
[24:04] some ro Romero here?" Yeah,
[24:07] &gt;&gt; have a dinner like that where love is
[24:09] then stalled ox where hatred they're
[24:11] with, right? And we all know that. I
[24:13] think we experienced that. Traitors,
[24:15] heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure
[24:17] more again than lovers of God. So, this
[24:20] is the the proverb I was talking about.
[24:22] Sometimes just like little hits it on
[24:24] the nail. Open rebuke
[24:26] is better than secret love. Can you
[24:28] imagine that? It's better to get rebuked
[24:31] openly than to be loved in secret.
[24:34] Meditate on that. Think about it. I have
[24:36] not wrapped my mind around that one. My
[24:38] goodness. I I just read it like cold
[24:40] turkey like you know it some they stand
[24:42] for themselves some of these proper
[24:43] verses a little some of them have a
[24:45] little bit of content like what it was
[24:46] talking about but some of them are just
[24:47] by themselves because it's just saying
[24:50] this and that it's giving you a
[24:51] contrast. So can you imagine like love
[24:54] talking about love so I'm just saying
[24:56] you know there's there's some warnings
[24:58] about certain loves you love in secret.
[25:03] Why why in secret? Maybe he's exposing
[25:06] something there,
[25:07] &gt;&gt; right? And it's saying that it's
[25:09] actually just put that aside. It's
[25:10] actually better for you to rebuke
[25:11] openly.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; That that's something, brothers. All
[25:15] right, Jeremiah. I want to put it up
[25:16] here. The Lord hated the that um the
[25:19] Lord, excuse me, hath appeared of old
[25:21] unto me, saying, "Yep, I'll love thee
[25:24] with an everlasting love." Pretty sure.
[25:27] Therefore, with loving kindness have I
[25:29] drawn thee. Love not the world, neither
[25:32] the things that. So that scripture there
[25:33] was just giving you a contrast of you
[25:35] know there's a wrong kind of love and
[25:36] then there's the elective love but love
[25:38] not the world. So you know of course not
[25:40] the right world neither the things of
[25:41] the world if any man love the world the
[25:43] love of the father is not in him.
[25:45] Another cutter here right and this is
[25:48] the condemnation right that man love the
[25:50] darkness but the light because they
[25:52] didn't want their evils to their their
[25:54] their works to be exposed the evil
[25:56] works. And um in here it says, "For all
[25:59] that is in the world, right, the lust of
[26:01] the flesh, the pride of life, the is not
[26:03] of the father, it's of the world and
[26:05] passes away. The lust thereof, but he
[26:09] that doeth the will of God abideth
[26:12] forever."
[26:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:13] &gt;&gt; So just love one another. Here it says
[26:15] um a new commandment, love one another.
[26:17] Love one another. Of course, it's all
[26:18] throughout the scripture. Let brotherly
[26:20] love continue. Right?
[26:22] &gt;&gt; We have that here. And it says, "Love
[26:24] one another because love is of God.
[26:26] loveth you he that loveth is born of God
[26:28] and knoweth God and he that loveth not
[26:31] knoweth not God for God is love right
[26:33] he's the source of it I mean God himself
[26:35] is love for this is the message that we
[26:37] have heard from the beginning that we
[26:38] should love one another right so it's
[26:40] clear but look at this for the for he
[26:43] that will love life
[26:46] and see good days let him refrain his
[26:48] tongue I need help from evil and his
[26:53] lips that they speak no
[26:56] I mean, I love life. I want to see good
[26:58] days. So, let's take the recipe there.
[27:01] We know that we have passed from death
[27:02] onto life because we love the brethren.
[27:06] &gt;&gt; We He that loveth not his brethren
[27:08] abideth in dead. Here, just wrapping up
[27:10] here. Husbands, love your wives.
[27:13] Very familiar scripture. But look at
[27:15] this. And be not bitter
[27:18] against them. I think we need help with
[27:20] this, brothers. Now, it also says, you
[27:22] know, love one another as Christ loved
[27:25] the church. In another place, as Christ
[27:26] loved us in another place, too. I'm
[27:29] gonna read this one quote. The children
[27:30] of Israel, brother Brandham speaking. He
[27:32] says in 47, very early on, friends, when
[27:34] you miss the love of God in your hearts,
[27:37] you miss everything. No matter what
[27:39] you're done,
[27:41] where there's tongues, they shall cease.
[27:43] Where there's prophecies, it shall
[27:45] vanish. But where there is charity,
[27:48] love, it lasts forever. I'd rather my
[27:51] wife would love me than be afraid of me.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you? Sure. You love God, the
[27:59] love of God in your heart. You know
[28:01] what, brothers? It takes more to lead
[28:03] life a family by love than to lead him
[28:07] by fear.
[28:09] &gt;&gt; It's the default thing of of the flesh,
[28:12] right? But I'm saying it takes more. I
[28:15] know sometimes we default to like, you
[28:16] know, because I said so on and
[28:17] everything, but it really takes more.
[28:19] Great love hath had no man. So there's
[28:20] no greater love than this than this that
[28:23] a man lay down his life for his friends.
[28:26] So this is my commandment that you love
[28:28] one another as I love you. See does the
[28:30] husband and wife also commending the
[28:32] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[28:34] loved the church and he gave himself for
[28:36] it. So it's sacrificial love agapa love
[28:40] right. No man has seen God at any time.
[28:43] If we love one another God dwelt within
[28:44] us and his love is perfected in us. So
[28:47] there's growth, maturity, and the last
[28:49] scriptures here, faith that workketh
[28:50] with love. For in Jesus Christ, neither
[28:52] circumcision availth anything for in
[28:54] circum nor in circumcision, but this
[28:57] scripture is tremendous foundational
[28:59] because but faith which workketh by
[29:02] love, that's what availth.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; So can you imagine? So faith is
[29:06] accompanied with love because everything
[29:07] we've been talking about, it has that
[29:09] that purpose. It has that elective love.
[29:11] It has that well intention behind it. So
[29:15] faith comes out of that. you faith you
[29:17] know motivates I mean love motivates
[29:19] faith it helps operate that faith
[29:22] because there's love may love be in this
[29:24] building here as we get ministered on
[29:25] later on here and wherefore I also after
[29:28] I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus
[29:30] I love and the love unto all the saints
[29:33] so there's four salutations where it
[29:35] says faith and love what I heard after
[29:36] faith and love here in Colossians Paul
[29:38] faith and love faith and love see love
[29:40] and faith see look at this faith and
[29:43] charity Paul's speaking to them after I
[29:45] heard about all this So just just just
[29:47] that's how love and faith work together.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Hold fast the form of sound words which
[29:52] thou hast heard of me in faith and love.
[29:55] You see? So now the end of the
[29:58] commandment is charity out of a pure
[30:00] heart and of a good conscience and faith
[30:02] unfaint. See love faith. Love faith.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; And the question is does love cast out
[30:07] fear? Nope. It's but close. Perfect love
[30:10] cast out all fear.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; Right. And here we have you. No there's
[30:13] no fear in love. Perfect love cast off
[30:15] fear. Fear has torment and fear is not
[30:18] he that fear is not made perfected. And
[30:20] last I'll leave you with this. I was u
[30:23] hearing brother uh Tim Puit preach and
[30:27] as I was studying about a month ago and
[30:30] then he just said this statement. It
[30:31] just is one of those that wake you up
[30:33] and it says fear is faith turned inside
[30:35] out. It's the opposite of faith. It
[30:38] believes more in Satan's power to harm
[30:41] than God's power to deliver.
[30:44] So let your faith triumph over your
[30:47] fear.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you
[30:50] brothers. Uh we had all the scriptures
[30:52] here that says above all these things
[30:54] put on charity which is the perfect
[30:56] which is the bond of perfection and let
[30:58] all your things be done in charity.
[31:00] Amen. God bless you brothers. Have a
[31:02] wonderful service. Praise the Lord.
