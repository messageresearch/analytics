[18:20] that show like kind love I love them all
[18:24] of them the entire family from the least
[18:27] to
[18:33] here I so
[18:41] my well I like to say something you know
[18:45] I I've I've come a long ways since God
[18:48] saved me and I remember when I first
[18:50] started going to church in Thomason
[18:52] Georgia my pastor was Clinton Gibby my
[18:55] brother and uh most of the time time my
[18:58] wife and I we would go to church we
[19:00] drive down there and we'd come home her
[19:02] crying and i' I'd go right to Monday
[19:04] morning I'd go right there and didn't
[19:07] realize that Sam was already my pastor
[19:09] because he'd preached to me all week and
[19:12] then on the weekend I'd go down there
[19:14] and I talked to Sam about it and he'd
[19:16] tell me to go this is just the kind of
[19:19] I'm saying this to show you what God
[19:21] does in a human being that the Christ
[19:24] the Myster God revealed tells us that
[19:27] we're to be the very expression of God
[19:30] the very manifestation of the word of
[19:32] God flowing through our vessels and I
[19:35] would tell him and he say go brother
[19:37] Dean it's the only chance they have and
[19:40] then of course I I went to I couldn't go
[19:42] anymore and then I had to come back but
[19:44] he never asked me to come to Lula
[19:46] Georgie H he made me he as much as I
[19:50] talked to him he told me that I had to
[19:53] hear the word wherever I was at I must
[19:55] hear the word and I've heard the word
[19:57] God spoke spoke to me one night as my
[20:00] wife and I went to bed and I've tried to
[20:02] say this many times and I just I never
[20:05] could get it out I'm going to try again
[20:08] now God said to me as I sat there on the
[20:11] side of my bed he showed me a Ministry
[20:15] and he showed me a Ministry of Moses he
[20:18] said now he didn't show me Moses he
[20:20] showed me a leadership of the holy ghost
[20:23] in a person he showed me that a Ministry
[20:25] would be built and I would be part of
[20:27] this this word that was to be built he
[20:30] showed me that I would be there and I
[20:32] would be built upon the word of God and
[20:34] not a sensation not a feeling but I
[20:37] would be built completely and totally
[20:39] upon the word of God God led me up that
[20:42] Highway and put me in the place that I
[20:45] am and I I appreciate brother Dale I
[20:49] appreciate what God has done through
[20:50] brother Dale I appreciate what God has
[20:52] done through the other Ministries and
[20:54] what God has done through you because
[20:56] each and every one of you has met
[20:59] words can't express what you mean to me
[21:02] and what God he God has shown me through
[21:04] each of you with the Holy Spirit God has
[21:06] helped me I have talked to each and
[21:09] every one of you and God has helped me
[21:11] through each every one of you and
[21:13] there's been messages give to me to give
[21:15] back to you by what you said to me so
[21:18] then how could I do anything but love
[21:20] you and I love you with all my heart I
[21:23] know that I love God because of the love
[21:26] I have for you because the way I love
[21:28] you is the way I love God and I want I
[21:31] just take this one moment just to tell
[21:34] you with all my heart I love you I love
[21:38] each and every one of you through your
[21:40] faes through your mountains and through
[21:42] your valleys I love you God showed me
[21:45] more of that this week than any time in
[21:48] my Christian Life he showed me that the
[21:50] grace that brother Dale spoke of this
[21:52] morning the love that he is he said I'm
[21:55] God and I change not and I said say amen
[21:58] that's the truth and I believe that each
[22:00] and every one of you can say the same
[22:02] thing you say I've watched God do so
[22:04] much this year that it's absolutely
[22:06] astounding I saw him do exactly what he
[22:09] said he would do through the message I
[22:11] watched him do it and I put my finger on
[22:14] it for most of you I've watched them do
[22:15] it and I believe that now that God's
[22:18] people is starting to move forward in
[22:19] that and I don't believe we're going to
[22:21] be here much longer and I tell you the
[22:23] leadership of the Holy Ghost is here and
[22:25] he's here Among Us and he's doing it and
[22:27] we recognizing what God is doing and
[22:29] there ain't one way to go and that's
[22:31] keep moving up all and God's going to do
[22:33] that I love you I appreciate you
[22:52] church I'm grateful I gu more than most
[22:56] of us in need
[23:01] but I thank God for a
[23:04] message being the message to bring us
[23:07] and to take us where we to go amen and
[23:11] I'm grateful to brother Dale for being a
[23:13] pastor God gave us
[23:16] pastor we need Pastor we need a
[23:20] pastor and I thank God for Brother D
[23:24] what he stand for and for the gospel in
[23:27] preach since I've known preaching I was
[23:31] nearly 3
[23:33] years and I can really appreciate I can
[23:37] love him I can have compassion for him
[23:41] as being a pastor because he has a great
[23:44] burden on you and as brother Harris was
[23:48] saying he takes time out to minister us
[23:52] individually as we have needs and that's
[23:55] a p and you are pray for me and I love
[23:59] all the brothers at Lula they all have
[24:01] been a great inspiration to me you all
[24:03] have and I guess I'm one in a lot of
[24:06] ways do not show the love that I have
[24:10] for you but I do love you and if I can
[24:14] at any time ever be a Min service you
[24:18] know just call me and you're brothers
[24:20] and sisters me you're my spiritual
[24:22] family I look forward to you all more so
[24:25] than I knew my own natural family and I
[24:28] was thinking with brother Dale when
[24:30] I lost my mother he was a pastor to me
[24:34] in more ways than I've ever had and I
[24:37] love him for that and I appreciate him
[24:38] for that so Brother D you I have my
[24:41] prayers whenever I pray so you
[24:56] all
[24:59] I like that I appreciate all Church
[25:03] brothers and sisters all they've done I

[25:24] we live and the life that we live he
[25:26] precious none of us
[25:28] to change to fit the word or to fit but
[25:32] he believed he let us live the life that
[25:35] we believe and tried to show us the way
[25:38] through the gospel that he Liv the
[25:41] gospel that he sees and for years many
[25:44] times I I fail in life and did things
[25:47] but he's still there he never tried to
[25:51] condemn anybody for the life that they
[25:54] live for the wrongs that they have did
[25:56] for ways that they do do things even
[25:59] when he said do it one way and we do it
[26:01] another we still don't come down on
[26:04] condemn for doing it but he continue try
[26:07] to show us through the gospel how that

[29:14] you know back when I used to do a lot of
[29:16] fighting in karate fighting everybody in
[29:19] sight also uh Tom used to we came
[29:22] together I don't even remember when I
[29:24] didn't know Tom that's how we came
[29:25] together so close but you know Tom would
[29:27] tell me he used to call them things War
[29:29] Stories you know he'd read the Bible to
[29:31] me you know and I would just I would
[29:33] kind of I would always try to respect
[29:35] him but I was kind of glad when he hurry
[29:37] up and get it over so I could tell him
[29:38] about some of the things I did but you
[29:40] know he never stopped he all he always
[29:44] he was consistent with that and then one
[29:46] night one morning I came in I said
[29:49] brother Tom I said you know I was
[29:50] baptized last night in a Baptist Church
[29:54] well I I I knew it was wrong you know I
[29:56] didn't know I didn't understand you know
[29:58] being baptized name of Father Son and
[29:59] the Holy Ghost I didn't understand I
[30:01] just knew that it was wrong it was
[30:02] something wrong there so what Tom did
[30:05] Tom went and bought me my first Bible he
[30:08] brought me I still got it I still got my
[30:09] little black Bible that he brought me
[30:12] but he means so much to me I've got
[30:15] memories that no one can take away from
[30:18] no matter what happens I have memories
[30:20] with each one of you brother colie he
[30:22] killed a deer this year I helped him
[30:25] bring it out and I told him I said
[30:27] brother colie I wouldn't miss this for
[30:29] nothing in the world because I've got
[30:31] memories now I said I've got memories

[30:39] this point right now that's why I know
[30:42] that I believe with all my heart that
[30:43] he's a true Son of God I've watched him
[30:46] in him over the hours and over the weeks
[30:48] and over the months and over the years
[30:51] that I would talk to him about God I'd
[30:52] take those tables at work and I'd have
[30:55] my pencil and I'd wore pencil after
