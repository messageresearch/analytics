wonderful to see the missing faces cuz some of them are in glory today but very sad for us I believe a message yes I believe God in his great love said my people will need me and I will send them a message to straighten out the difficulties because the times truly will wax worse and worse God would send a message by a prophet that Prophet would get people back to the center of the word of God that message would prepare people for a Rapture because the times were going to get horrible before the message I didn't even know what love was Sir and now we know what love is we are also learning what true evil is where the world is getting so evil that everything good will be speaking evil against and everything bad will be justified and spoken well about we're in the days of the end time message amen we should not be surprised it would come in so sneaky so horrible to try to destroy the very work of God hold tight to the word of God this is our hour this is the time when we stand this is the time when we uh display Jesus Christ in Hearts amen and the times will grow worse yes and some of us maybe here even right will be arrested for this word we're already scorned we're already set aside like we are odd but it's the days of the message amen God would send a messenger a prophet yes sir God would also send a five-fold Ministry for the finishing work of the prophet's message God would also send sermons and make sure that they were taped yes the same God who sent a Bible and made sure it was in printed form and then he would have a people that would live those words that would live the written and the spoken word I believe this message I did not learn this message online come on brother I learned it on my knees amen glory yes sir one day we'll just be gone we'll just simply be gone and then they get to stay and argue Doctrine we are the living Doctrine now is the time for parents to watch over their children amen now is the time for children to watch over your siblings amen Now's the Time for children to act like kings and queens this is the time Hallelujah and for those who endure until the end a great crown awaits us a great time of reunion and and and fellowship with the great ones that have gone on amen amen the church in Sweetwater greets you and we're fighting our battle and the message still lives there's still people that hear the word yes that's and are called out isn't there that's right they hear that word and know that they want more of that the true Mana from Heaven amen I love you all just God bless you for coming I'm so grateful for these meetings to be back I'm tired of the devil covid was just one more test right I would like to say that this will be our last test that's right it won't amen but the same God who brought you to the Lord will keep you in the Lord and will keep you to the end and I just want to say a great honor and respect her brother Samuel Dale amen who right to the end you know he may have lost his memory but he didn't lose his mind he never ever lost his testimony of believing this message let this mind be in you yes which was in brother Samuel Dale and in our Lord Jesus Christ am cuz it'll take you through even if we lose our minds the mind of Christ will do the trick we'll do it honor amen God bless you we have some singers and and uh two three songs if that's okay we'll make them real fast God

adoption papers turn with me to the Book of John chapter 4 your adoption papers your Bible come on now you say brother Joel I didn't bring my do what are you talking about talking about the word of God your identity huh amen St John chapter 4 amen that came off of me didn't I'll never forget I remember years ago brother Fred Mullins was up home and if any of you all know brother Fred you know how Wild he gets sometimes and he jerked this thing off and here he was he just had it up like this preaching so St John chapter 4 we're going to read verses 7 and verse 29 just as a a basis of inspiration uh for what the lord has laid upon my heart to bring to you today and how many loves the word of God Amen amen and I pray that there will be something said today that will uh Quicken a little more uh within us cuz it's about time to get out of here Saints and the reality is this we're still here because that last one is not in now what if what what if what if that last one was here hallelujah in this service Hallelujah because my my purpose and and my perspective and and my uh in Iration my motivation for doing what I do in Christ is to find that last one you know the prophet talked about how uh that if there was only one in Jeffersonville going it was going to be him huh so I just borrowed that inspiration and carried it over into looking for that last one if the last one is going to be found guess who's going to find that last one amen so I may not be called across the sea or whatever go somewhere where but where I am effective and where I traits and way the where I go and do I want to shed some light on Everybody by the way that's not just up for the ministers that's up for that's in and for everybody young old male female short fat white black yellow whatever you are in this realm your calling is to be a light and a witness sir amen St John 4: 7 simply reads there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus said unto her give me to drink right verse 29 verse 28 actually the woman then left her water pot and went her way into the City and saith to the men come see a man which told me all things that ever I did is not this the Christ amen let us bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you for our place in the building today amen we thank you for a calling Upon Our Lives and when we hear that word Lord we immediately think of the ministry the calling but Lord we've all been called into this walk we've all been called into this way and sure there are different offices and different uh uh obligations and and callings respectfully and and particularly but in in the general sense of or in the broad sense of Father we've all been called and so we thank you for calling us into this place this church this building this Tabernacle this Sanctuary that that was dedicated for the indwelling of your presence and this place that was dedicated this place that was built Lord brick and mortar and and and all the things the wood and the timber all of these things that go the shingles all these things that go into construction Lord it was all for the Saints to be able to have a place to bring their lick of fire in order that that lick of fire can start a bigger fire so Lord that's why we're here today oh God to assemble in this place to to do our part to to say an amen to clap our hands to to to to give you praise to give you glory to show forth to Dying World that you are still alive and that you are still doing if you raised from the dead if you Rose like you said that you would and we know that you did then you will be continuing to do what you have always done so therefore there has to be somebody to get a hold of that understanding to get a hold of that reality and make it live until you return until you come back for us so father we're gathered here our place in the building our licks of fire and we're here to raise hands we're here to worship you and we're here to say sick him sick that old devil and and run him out of our Lives we're here to see chains are broken today yes we're here for a youth service we're here for a gathering and and Lord humanity is such that as time goes on Lord we may have received the victory last Sunday or the last service that we were gathered Wednesday night po possibly but here we are once again on a Saturday and Lord we need you once again amen we've encountered some things in this old realm of time that Lord that that make us feel dirty that make us feel filthy that that's bombarding our minds and Lord we need deliverance we need Victory and I pray oh God with all that's within Me Oh Lord that you would just use me as an instrument of that power oh God that you'd come down and you would strike these old lips of clay that you come down and you touch these old ears oh God granted oh God so the hearer can be blessed together with the speaker oh God and we can say within our souls within the depths of who we are did not our hearts burn within us as you came and talked to us along the way so get your glory father God just reporting the service one more time who knows this very well may be my last time this might be our last time to gather here so Lord may we not miss it may we not miss our opportunity to lay hold on to eternal life and it's in Jesus Christ we pray and ask these things amen amen you may be seated oh isn't he good isn't he good we are presented with today a very familiar scripture by the way I often laugh when I even say that and hear it a familiar your scripture they should all be familiar but we're we're here with a story and quite frankly this is one of my uh most inspiring one one of one of them in in the scripture because it speaks of a situation where as I was just saying there a moment ago the the the the calling the purpose the the desire that we should have to spread light because this little girl this woman here at the well that day she did not know that she was an eternal creature right but yet she was reled religious she had an experience that that that that let her know enough that well I I I believe the message or we can say all say it that way I I believe I believe God sent a prophet all of these things but do you realize that you are an eternal creature I'm thoroughly convinced that if we really knew who we were then we would be doing those Greater Works that he spoke about we would be seeing more done Among Us but my thought today just if you if you'll travel with me just for a moment and and for those that care I'm looking at my watch that I'm conscious of my time and for those that care I took my jacket off so you think well he's either going to preach long or he's not so I'll take care of all of you amen you know in a time like this too that you know the prophet says there's three types of Believers in every service so I've got a lot of work to do today is that right y'all listen fast and we might preach fast but but actually in that why are we here anyway who is rushing the preacher who are you don't rush the preacher this is eternal life amen amen you can rush me if you want to but you know what I got breakes on this model I might camp out for a little while around I better not feel that so I give you permission to go now if you need to go go but just a little thought again I can only be me brother the way leaving things behind leaving things behind John 4 and3 says he left Judea and departed again unto Galilee just to give a little back uh uh backstory just to to to gather my thoughts just a little bit but he Jesus he takes out on this journey and he doesn't take the route that most Jews would take if you just let me for a moment I'm going to speak of him as being a Jew we know he's not a gene or he was neither Jew nor Gentile but in in this instance he he didn't take the route that that typically a Jew would take because there were typically two routes that the Jews would take in order to prevent from going through Samaria sikar which was a word and and of reproach but they would they would either looking at a map of the area there they would either uh go up uh along the the the the western side of the coast along the Mediterranean they' travel that way or they would go up on the Eastern side they would go up the Jordan River which would lead them into the Sea of Galilee all for the Ben even though it was longer it took them longer to go that way all for the benefit of not going through Samaria those people look funny they they smell funny they act different huh God put it on your heart maybe that that that beggar out on the street literally standing on the corner God put it on your heart yes to go give them a little bit of food a little bit of money or to go witness to them well I don't want to because they smell funny H I don't care what you look like I don't care what you've done I don't care what you are going to do to me I want to show forth Jesus Christ Wherever I Go amen are we not called to be Jesus Christ or are we not called to be Jesus Christ and Jesus himself embodied love and I say this everywhere I go because this is simply who I am Jesus embodied love and if we're not being that to everybody if we're not being loved to everybody then we're missing it forget about William brandom forget about Malachi for in the sense of that message that he brought if you're not being loved forget all of that but they would not go through Samaria because to them the Samar an were considered ethnically and religiously unclean right hear me now now now in looking at it and studying it out the the the the distance is about a 70 mile period And depending on what type of traveler you are or or or or how long whatever you take with you or who you're traveling with the this this journey this distance would take anywhere from from two two and a half days up to two weeks now to the Natural Observer being that this was H the halfway point between what the on his journey the halfway point of the journey it makes sense looking at it from a natural observation it makes sense that Jesus would be stopping to take a rest because even in verse six there in John tells us it even says that he was wearied with the journey how many weary Journey folk do we have today getting wearied along the way doing what God has called you to do but you get weary sometimes now I like the cute folk y'all probably if you heard me preach you heard me say this many times the cute folk they don't get weary I like those cute folk yeah amen getting wearied with his journey here the the the master of it all the creator of everything was weary and if he got weari in what he was doing so shall we but we're still called we still got a purpose so St John 4 introduces us to a woman and we don't even know what her name was scripture don't even name her she she was she was uname she was a nobody she was a friends dweller and maybe you're here today maybe maybe you feel like that little woman in the sense that you you think that you're just a nobody why because somebody in churches treated you bad right if you're here today and feel that way I'm letting you know that you are somebody in Christ and if you are the person that's made that person feel bad you better find out who you are in Christ because this word will make you there's a power there's a power in this word that will cause you to live the right kind of life I'm not talking about a form I'm not talking about a tradition I'm not talking about all of these things I'm talking about a genuine in life in Christ you said brother Joel That's mighty simple well it's simply going to get us out of here one day my a fringe dweller I begin to think about these things being been invited to a youth service the youth today as well as as even the adults but the youth today they're being bombarded with so much so many things amen there has to be somebody surrounding them in their life Mom Dad don't give up on your young I don't care where they are I don't care where they they they what they've done you still go out in love you remember the prodigal son that that Daddy that father he saw him from afar he didn't write him off he didn't dismiss him why because he loved that boy that's your heritage that's a part of your promise to the Natural eye this was a chance encounter to the critical eye he should not have been where he was at that particular time there's somebody somewhere always up in your business yes sir somebody always meddling you just might be meddling in the Divine Providence of God right so get your little bony scny finger put it in your pocket is that all right because Divine leadership is never fully understood it's never understood fully huh people are not going to understand why you live the way that you live it's not up to them to understand that it's up to them to understand the Christ that's in show them Christ show them the manifestation of what love really is faith wants delivered to the Saints the prophet says it this way and there there a visible light in the shape of a dove what a faith he had talking about him him being weary on his journey here and and or or tying in that way walked about calmly could you think of the weight many times I think of this the the weight and the and the strain that that was on Jesus the man the body the boy the weight that was on him but the prophet says it this way he walked about calmly his persecutors on every side making fun of him blast fer babbler his own received him not but he walked steady knowing just exactly that God was in him ordaining his destination God is in you ordaining your destination you say I don't understand what I'm going through it's not important that you understand what you're going through it's important that you understand where you're on your way too if you understand where you're going it'll help you a little bit of understanding where you are now there you are every person that's born of the spirit of God that knows that holy spirit's in you rests assured God knows your destination walk calmly before him leaving things behind we'll get there shortly so the Jews they resented and despised the Samaritans and guess what the Samaritans rented resented and despised the Jews that like the devil they don't ain't going to shake my hand I ain't going to shake theirs they didn't invite me to dinner I ain't going to invite them to dinner you inviting them to dinner may be what breaks that devil huh where can I hide so these two strangers they begin to have a conversation we're we're familiar with the story I know but but it was his dress and it was his speech was all that she needed listen to this it was all that she needed to know not so much who he was but rather what he was right the way he's dressed and the way that he spoke and and and and it that was all that she needed to formulate an opinion she was satisfied with what he was but she needed to know who amen he was right amen now I I wonder often wonder how many how many Jews she she had encountered in her past and in her her goings about in life that had berated her that had belittled her that considered her nothing amen hear me now Jews religious people treating somebody as though they're beneath them in fact I heard brother juel fory say this this is stuck with me was years ago he was speaking about this very this very encounter and he said that when Jesus went out and began his public Ministry which we know that he identified who he truly was through this woman or or at the what at this time but he said the first Spirit the first Spirit he encountered was racism that's a real one how you know brother Joel it's real it is real so here she was and no doubt that this man she was thinking this that no doubt this Jew this man she began because of she knew who he was and where he was from no doubt she was bracing herself for slander bracing herself for ridicule another battle to be battled another opportunity to be belittled maybe you come to church and you think well well here I'm I'm going to go to church again and nobody's going to be free me nobody's going to shake my hand nobody's going to treat me kind but you came anyway you're here to receive something from the Lord and sure enough as expected this stranger this Jew speaks to her as though she is nothing more than a servant right the first words out of his mouth to this woman was give me something to drink right right let me tell you something brother who in the world do you think you are do you not know I'm the bride of Christ you know I've been called I'm Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost really acting like that huh give me the drink what does she say why why are you asking me to get you something to drink y'all don't have anything to do with us Samaritans remember attitude that's a devil if you got it it's time to go it's time to get rid of the attitudes this this is a word that's changing us Saints sweeping through the gates that New Jerusalem that new city we think I'm I'm going to go I'm going to make it in yes you might but guess what that attitude that nasty indifference that you have when you treat and encounter other people that's not going yes sir and you want to take it and you want to baby it and you you want to hold it close to you get rid of that thing today you said well my mama was that way I don't care I ain't talking about your mama your mama's going to be lost if she don't don't get rid of it you're going to be lost if you don't get rid of it amen amen amen give me the drink here she meets him responds with an attitude this is not looking too good is it it's not looking very good cuz the way you respond to the word will determine exactly what you get we recall in the scriptures Matthew 15 the story of the woman from Canan who comes to Jesus her her her daughter is is demon-possessed Matthew 15:25 the Bible tells us that with her having this need 15:25 Matthew she says that she worshiped him now watch this she worshiped him and that word worship here in this particular instance meaning to kiss the hand like a dog licking his Master's Hand so she comes up to him she begins to worship she begins to worship so it's not so much that she has her hands up and she's praising or she's prostrated she is at the master close enough to kiss his hand like a dog licking his Master's Hand and she's saying Lord help me help me she's worshiping him and what does he do watch this he meets her in the condition that she meets him in come on he he responds to her in the way that she responded to him you think you're a dog hear this I'm not called to your race I'm not called to give you dogs food huh she came at him in that way so he presents a word to her to see what she's going to do and we know the prophet says that that even Jesus himself could not run her off that's right in that condition in her low state in her time of need he responds in a way that that that should have been okay your daughter's going to be saved your daughter's going to be but he's responds in a way that would cause her seemingly humanly looking at it to shrink back even further fine if that's what he's going to be if that's how he's going to be I don't want to follow him that's right when I when I realize this begin to look at that I realize that sometimes we don't get anything out of God simply because of the way that we come at god well I'm not worthy and we're not but that Spirit needs to be broken off of you because you are worthy you've been called God's called you to a place in a position that's higher than any position that this world can ever give you so you never receive anything from God because you're coming at God as though you're not worthy huh just as this woman did when she came at him like a dog well fine I'm going to treat you I'm going to give you some word that's fitting for a dog and so even when we come that way and we we've been praying about something and well I'm not worthy and I I guess the healing is not for me and but we're still praying and you stay sick and you stay in that condition you stay trapped in your mind and all of these all of these things that's going on in your life only because you need to change your language change your attitude change your perspective change your [Applause] words to get something from the Lord because you know how we are in this age we're so soft we don't want anybody to talk bad about us anybody say anything negative huh go pout somewhere off in a corner and well where's brother so and so brother sister so and so she had been to church well I think something I said the other night brother Wade but think something that I said across the pool but I made him upset you better get back in the house of God this is your livelihood this is not just church this is who you are so the woman her her preconceptions prevented her from fully experiencing her experience did you catch that I know that's simple you say well that ain't too profound yes it is her preconceptions prevented her from experiencing her experience it it was her day her moment her time her Traditions her religious Traditions prevented her from fully experiencing her experience here she was quoting the word to the word like she had some some greater revelation of the word but yet she presented her religious oity to him yeah wait I'm tired I'm tired go weary people rallying around and saying God sent a prophet well what are you doing with that word amen how is it changing you how is it impacting your life is it causing you to to to to to be a true example when you're walking through Walmart I hate mentioning Walmart when I preach cuz I hate that place but it's a it's a common everybody knows about Walmart everybody goes to Walmart but even when you're there when you're pushing that little buggy grabbing those items off the shelf you can be a light and a witness so don't miss your opportunity today brother sister don't miss it don't turn it away Redemption Redemption incompleteness the prophet says it this way there was a woman come out out from Samaria one time she was discouraged she was sinful and had a lot of things hanging on her life amen no doubt I'm looking at some saints today that you're discouraged you got a lot of things hanging on your life perhaps and she was discouraged she went to Jacob's Well for Relief and watch what she does and she'd go back she went to to Jacob's Well for Relief and she'd go back she'd go to the well and then she'd go back and one day one day one day she set the water pot [Music] down and was standing there discouraged and there stood The Rock standing by her she spake to that rock he gave her a great gusher in her soul all he wants you to do is talk with him communion with him don't let the preacher just preach don't let the brother just sing don't let the Saints around you just sing and Worship You worship you talk to the master you talk to the Rock because you're weary you're discouraged it's your day it's your opportunity to receive why because you're laying some things behind you're laying them down amen amen she spake to that rock he gave her a great gusher in her soul and I pray to God that's what happens today to to to someone just but one that a great gusher would spring forth in your very Soul she ran into the city she never come to draw anymore she had life she said come see a man that told me everything and I ever done isn't this the Christ she spake to the Rock and The Rock brought forth its water speak to him amen speak to him today are you discouraged Ed do you have a lot of things hanging on to you of Life the trappings of Life maybe family strains this is real saints this is real people walking through life thinking well I'll be okay no you're not okay why because you haven't called out for help Lord help me that thing hanging on to you that depression state that all that depression that that weariness that gloominess that gets around you even sick itself how are you approaching the master how are you coming to him and when he responds are you still going to say be it unto me or yes Lord I'll hang on to that word I don't understand it but I'm hanging on to it so here we have the longest single discourse that Jesus had with any one individual in all of the Bible was with this woman a prostitute a Loosely living woman that the master of the universe chose to come to her and we say we're the bride of Christ and we can't lay hold onto this word and make it act and do like it did in the days of old the M here you him I hear the prophet say it now he said we must be inspired by the word of God that'll make him come to that Worden that that your inspiration will bring God to that word and then blend them together and make it act and do like it did in the days of old so we must first have to be inspired otherwise it's just a book with some words in it otherwise it's just a message that a that a man spoke but if we're not inspired by it it's just going to be dead and all that we're going to do is go through the motions of of churchianity and all the the religiousness that's associated with all these things we'll go to this camp and this camp this meeting this special service and we we'll just go and people will say well I saw you last week I saw you last month last year good to see you again and have no amount of victory in your life at all that's what I'm weary about that's what I'm growing tired of seeing I want to see Victorious children of God if we are the Queen of Heaven then we need to start acting like it to hold our head high in dignity Amen in fact Malachi 4 God identified me before he even identified William Brown you say That's mighty bold brother Joel that's just the word of God right he says behold I send you sir Elijah huh take that and do whatever you want to with it but it's still the Bible so if he's getting my attention he has something for me to hear amen so if God got my attention and he telling me he said to me Elijah then I want to hear what Elijah has to say because God God's wanting me to do something with what Elijah had to say Amen the first words that Jesus speaks to her is about his need you ever think about that right right when they have this encounter the very first thing he says to her is about what he has need of his need he met her where she was in her condition he's here today he has stepped and filled this room to meet you where you are amen you say brother Joel you don't know my condition you don't know how low I've been you don't you don't know all of the the the the trappings that that are holding me bound but I don't need to know but I'm here to let you know those things don't have to hold you any longer a prisoner in your mind there's some chains I believe are going to be broken today he met her where she was in her condition and in his Humanity he matched her condition think about that in his Humanity he matched her condition because he could have just swooped in did all this Great Mighty thing and the wind begin to swirl and all these things and music Celestial music begin to play no that would have scared the liver out of that girl God will meet you where you are God will speak to you in a way that you are familiar with amen [Music] you know it's his voice so he met her where she was he was discouraged she was discouraged he was weary she was weary he was tired she was tired he was alone she was alone she he was carrying a burden and a weight and so was she carrying a burden and a weight these two seemingly opposite individuals going through the same thing and what does the devil want to do sometimes to make you think that you're the only one you're the only one that's struggling with this thing you're the only one that was violated by an uncle or a brother or a father or whoever there's others that's struggling with that same thing today and God is here to set you free from that thing leaving things behind discouraged weary tired alone carrying a burden why Romans 8 and3 says it this way for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh so Jesus the body the the the boy the man the flesh condemn sin in the flesh so that's letting me know brother way that I too in my body in my flesh can condemn sin I don't so much need the hands laid on me and that's good and we believe in that we'll do that but God says that we can stand in our humanity and condemn the very works and hes of the devil amen I believe this Saints you can float out in the stratosphere if you want to and get out in the Deep things and I love the Deep things believe the Deep things live the Deep things but it's the simple things it's right down where we live cuz see I can hide behind the seal I can hide behind the Deep mystery and say Amen to it but it gets a little squeaky when you get down on where I live that's what I want I want some preaching I want I want a word that's going to scour me out I remember growing up washing my momma on the old Wash Tub she get those old clothes and that old wash and they wash up and she just go to that washing board and just scrub and scrub and scrub getting the clothes clean getting all the dirt every all the filth everything out so that's what I want to do today is take this word and just scrub scrub get all the dirt get all the filth get all the trash Hebrews 4 and 15 says for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities the feeling of just that not even speaking anything by the way but not not even saying a word but with a an inward cry God please take this thing from me nobody knows the hurt that I'm going through Nobody Knows the scars that I couldn't tell anybody what I'm going through and what happened to me but God Can Be Touched By The Very feeling of your infirmity and many times when we think of infirmity we think of in the body and that's true he can be touched by those but also that inward groaning that inward part that spirit that has been wounded that soul that has been scarred that that that Spirit that's been diverted yes on Sir science will tell you psychology will tell you that when a person experiences a traumatic event maybe it's sexual abuse or physical abuse or something along those lines maybe just three four five 10 years old at that moment there's a part of your brain that shuts off you don't develop and grow any further in that part and anytime there's another trauma another bump your mind will take you back to that event to that moment and see that's what the devil want you stuck in is the past Moses said who who do I tell them sent me he says tell them I am that I am and anybody that knows the English language knows that I am am is a present tense verb so therefore if you capture God in the present tense he will always be present amen but if you're laying hold on to a god of the past well God sent a prophet yes he did but you know what that message that he sent is still going on today why because it's living in me I keep Malachi for present I keep Malachi for alive yes that's bold yes that's true my for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin Hebrews 11:6 says but without faith we know this it is impossible to please him for he for for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him diligently giving some attention to it putting a little work into it amen well I read my Bible and I prayed today I read you know no Dil ently seeking God where are you as we know in the Garden of Eden that day it was God crying out for Adam Adam where are you he was looking for Adam even though he knew where he was amen God knows exactly where you are and in what you're going through but he's waiting for you to call on him amen I think of that old song if you call on Jesus he will answer a prayer old Pentecostal song just over and over if you call on Jesus he will answer prayer he will do that very thing we got to call on him from before the foundation of the earth God's purpose was to share his eternal life with Humanity from before the world was even formed he had a desire he had a purpose he had an intention and that was he wanted to share his deity with you amen amen that you can walk upright even though you've been knocked down that you can walk upright even though you've been scarred and wounded you can still carry yourself with a royal air not with your nose stuck up in the air but with a royal air dignity huh people a curious wonderment Divine Healing the message 1954 I I go way back by the way I I go I go all the way back I don't just stick around the seals and go from there I go all the way back cuz the message is the message is the message and by the way the message is the message did you get my message you understand what I said because see this word he either meant what he said or he did not and my part in that is I either Believe it or I don't amen huh pretty simple that's how I live brother you ought to be the happiest person in the world to know that you're sitting here as a Believer on the Lord Jesus you ought to be the happiest person on the face of the Earth if anybody out of Jeffersonville is going it's going to be me if anybody's going out of Lula Georgia while I'm here you better watch out because it's going to be me so we should be the happiest person on the face of the world think about it if everybody just that one thought if everybody lived that way think about how Victorious things would be think about how the services would be think about how God would just open up those windows and pour these things out but what do we do we close the window oh it's a little Breezy in here I don't like a bigger draft and God's wanted to blow through your life and blow all of this smut all of this stuff out all of this religiousness all this messages out of you cuz by the way the message is not a belief system the message is aive it's not a system of dos and don'ts it's a life and once you get captivated by it you will live that life because as I said there's there's power in this word that will cause that's what the prophet said there's power in this word that will cause you to live the right kind of life you're sitting here as a Believer yes sir but you don't realize or a sinner doesn't know what it means that when almighty God knocks on his heart why there's nothing like it nowhere nothing like it no paycheck no fany car no big fine house no job nothing like it you you could search and comb the heavens and you couldn't find anything equal to that that how a holy infinite God would come down lock watch what watch how the prophet places this that a holy infinite God would come down and knock at the heart of a sinner's door and want to live buddies with him God wants to be your buddy not just your friend he wants to be your buddy amen the prophet says it ought to make us break loose everybody now brother Joel I've heard that quote before and it didn't move you last time either but I read it anyway amen God is good Ephesians 1 Ephesians 1:4 according as he ha chosen Us in him from before the foundation of the world I hate this thing sometimes it gets gets to tripping on me and I I hit it too quickly amen praise the Lord I lost my page amen somebody say amen amen according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the word somebody say page 12 okay y'all help me if I call on you I'm going counting on you if I lose my place I'll go back to 12 start there before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love holy and Without Blame holy and without blame his word says we can be holy and Without Blame so therefore we can be what guess what we can be holy and Without Blame even though the devil's pointing his finger see you remember what you did you remember what you looked at you remember what you said yes I remember all that but I'm holy and I'm Without Blame because there was a man that went to a cross there was a man that that before he got to that cross he was beaten so badly he took some wounds he took some Stripes to the point where he was unrecognizable oh my oh my brother Joseph I'm convinced that we're missing we're forgetting the true vision of Calvary amen we're forgetting exactly what he did and exactly I'll go so far as to say what he looked like for you that you don't have to fight this thing anymore this battle is not yours it's the [Music] Lord he took Stripes so you could be free you said brother Joel I'm I'm going through this thing over and over and over well today is your day to be loose from this thing you say well how do I do it you just look to him and live you just worship him as the sisters was singing the song no matter what's going on when you're down when you're up you're still worshiping when there's no money to pay the bills you're still worshiping when there's no food you're still worshiping when that person comes at you again to violate you in some way ah you can still look to him and live Ephesians 1:6 to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted Amen in the Beloved except word accepted means be highly favored amen praise the Lord it doesn't matter what I look like cuz what I look like is not important it's who I look like it's who the identity that I'm taking on it's who I am becoming amen accepted that word means to be highly favored to make graceful for example Charming lovely agreeable to pursue with Grace compass with favor to honor with blessings now we know that that women they're they're they're more moved by things that they hear and as the bride of Christ this should be some pleasant things to the wife's ear these will be things that will cause her to to to be uh more susceptable to being loved is that right listen to this listen to this sis highly favored I'm talking about sis the bride of Christ the highly favored to make graceful you're charming you're lovely you're agreeable you're you're you're you're able to pursue Grace huh to Compass favor to honor with blessings amen Church age book The Ephesian age oh yes I'm reading out of the church age book amen and guess what I don't care if you don't want to hear it it's my turn this was a part of his eternal and predestinated purpose y'all blame it on brother Wade if you have any problem with anything he was the one that called he was the one that extended the invitation to it's his fault this plan was to be to the praise of the glory of his grace listen to this let me tell you how special you are through the words of the prophet of the messenger of this day it was the Plan of Redemption it was the Plan of Salvation now listen closely God being a savior it was necessary that he predestinate a man who would require salvation don't just stop right there it gets great it gets better right who would require salvation in order in order to give himself reason and purpose Pur of being so your Victory today gives him reason and purpose to be you are the reason that he hung there on that cross you are the very reason if it was just you he would have taken those stripes he would have taken those those whippings those those he would have heard those words he would have taken that spit on his face what is your view of Calvary what does Calvary look like to you oh right I think sometimes we forget we got to realize that there was blood there that day huh there was a life that was expired but that life got up amen so that lets us know when we get down to our lowest point where we can't go any further if we are in him we can't get back up amen St John 4:28 the woman then left her water pot and went her way into the city now the Bible doesn't record and I couldn't find maybe you could but I I didn't find anything that that that she ever returned for that water pot she didn't come back to the Altar and pick it up right when she stood when she knelt down at the altar that day and and was crying out in Blood and and or or snot and everything tears running down Dr to the a mess looked awful but she said Lord I'm laying it at your altar and what did she do before she went back to her Pew she picked it back up but the Bible does not say that she ever returned for that water pot why because she had left it amen behind amen so we were able to conclude that it may have been something that wasn't that significant to her after all but then again it was much like her life this water pot that she carried to the well that day it was brought to the well empty you said brother Joel I'm empty I'm spent I'm done I don't know what what else to do I've come to church I'm empty I'm so weary I'm so tired I'm tired of fighting this battle I'm tired of fighting this thing I I I I want it gone but so like her coming to the well that day here you are in this service this youth this Fellowship service weary tired I don't care how old you are you say you might young trying to be telling me what to do this is the word huh this is the word it's here to help anybody amen the old old the young the in the out the indifferent everybody brother the intention the purpose The Habit the routine for her going to the well was to what was to fill with it with water once she got to the well that was her routine that was her habit that was her purpose come to church sing this song we're going to sing that song then we're going to sing this we do that we know the routine right but I'm tired of coming in a routine way I want something fresh I want to bring my water pot and I want to leave it I don't want to pick it back up and take it back with me huh cuz that's why she was there to fill her water pot here's my cup Lord I Lift It Up Lord huh fill it up Redemption incompleteness I want to read it again there was a woman come out from Samaria one time she was discouraged she was sin and had a lot of things hanging on her life what's hanging on your life today oh yes what's hanging what's dangling out there huh that the devil wants to lower the God wants to lower the boom on that thing to get rid of it once and for all and she was discouraged she went to Jacob's Well for Relief and she go back she go to Jacob's Well and go back in one day she set the water pot down set down your water pot sis set your water pot down brother today the day here's your opportunity to leave these things behind she set it down and there she was discouraged and there stood The Rock standing by her she spake to that rock amen amen see a man that told me everything that ever had done isn't this the Christ she spake to the Rock and The Rock brought forth his water so here she was doing what she always did so here you are doing what you always do when you come the church you may be visiting such as me but still there's a certain routine that you're used to but God's here to shake us up without that thing today it's time to leave some things behind Saints so here she was doing what she was always doing and not realizing she had no clue that the answers to her deepest desire was about to be met you had no clue when you came into the house of God today that there was going to be some questions answered for youen that spark of Eternity has been ignited around the illumination of this word has expanded itself around you and with the illumination and the power of this word it's time to grow up it's time to grow it's time to grow a little higher in Christ so what did the woman do she left her water pot teaching on Moses this is for the the the the the youth aspect of the service teaching on Moses 1956 Here We Go Again way back there yep now boys and girls you know what there's a lot of things in the world that's real valuable and one of those things is you have it with you today let me let me back up boys and girls men and women brothers and sisters you know what there's a lot of things in the world that's real valuable in one of those things is you have it with you today and it's the soul that's inside of that body that's what the devil's after he may be buffeting you with cancer or this sickness this disease or that that weariness in your brain but really what he's after is your soul his intent is to take you down he wants that soul and that's the most valuable thing in the world to you is that right mother say Amen mother say amen and the most valuable thing that you got is your soul now if you keep your soul then you're going to lose it this to me is probably one of the most simplest things in the message but yet it's profound to the point where if we get a hold to that one thing if we sometimes we have things in our life that we want to hold on to what did Abraham do he took ishmail he raised him up before the Lord this is my little ish oh I love him so much that's my that's my baby I've had this thing all my life my mama was that way you got to you got to let go of that it's time for ish to go the most valuable thing that you got is your soul now if you keep your soul then you're going to lose it and if you lose your soul then you're going to save it if you lose your soul to Jesus see in other words if you believe on Jesus you become his disciples and then if you give your life to Jesus when you're young like this then you're you're he's going to save it to everlasting life but if you want to keep it you're going to lose it yes if you keep that devil you're going to lose everything bud let go of that thing let it's it's just that simple that thing dangling on you that'll torment you at night when you're in bed alone and there that thing just coming at you maybe when you're by yourself or maybe even when you come to church it's still there it's time to Let It Go yes sir now you remember that now that it's the most valuable thing in the world is your little soul and if you keep it you'll lose it if you give it to Jesus you save it give that thing to Jesus concerned and convinced when I had a little vision I don't want to call it a translation I never had a vision like that I was standing up there looking at it looking back at myself here recently many of you read in the magazines and things friends you you can't afford to miss that you can't afford to whatever you do don't miss it to prophet now there's somewhere there I was there just as I am here looking back at myself and I've had Visions I know what Visions are it was it was a vision it was the strangest one I ever had and I seen the people the ones that's gone on I seen them there the old was young and they were standing there human beings just like I am beyond the curtain of time only without sin my what a place amen that alone I don't don't care about a new body just let me be somewhere there's no sin I care about my new body y'all know what I was saying I'm going to get that too but if I could go just where there be no sin that that' be great that'd be wonderful it was beyond Perfection Sublime you just couldn't mention what it was and when I knew that I had to return back there's only one thing that I would return to try to persuade people yes so that's what I'm doing here today is trying to persuade you trying to let you know that there is a life that's beyond this life life and everything in this life that's holding you here you got to let it go you got to leave it behind whatever you do the prophet says don't miss it he says it again don't miss it and guess what he says it again don't miss it you can't afford to miss it he says it three times for the Father the Son the Holy Ghost right for the Lord Jesus Christ so we would catch it don't miss it you can't afford to miss it everything else let everything else go but make ready for that whatever you do if Mama don't go I'll Journey on if the preacher don't go it's not going to hinder me because why I'm on my way to canaan's land leaving things behind Brethren Philippians 3:13 I count not myself to have apprehended amen but this one thing I do the musicians would come this one thing I do what are you going to do Paul forgetting those things which are behind I'm not going to go back and pick up that water pot I have no more need for that water pot because I found a new pot in which to hold all the Living Waters of Eternity amen because she would go and she'd get this water and she'd have to come back and get more he would run out she' have to go and get more but drink from this well this Fountain of Life for forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before that word forgetting means to forget somebody say forget forget simply forget neglecting no longer caring for goodbye word I'll be no longer with you is that right no longer caring for forgotten given over to Oblivion if we would forget these things that are trapping us here amen they're going to be sent to Oblivion anyway and guess what if we are still attached to that thing guess where we're going to be found in Oblivion we're not promised Oblivion we're promised eternity a land Without End a land that had no beginning am Paul goes on to say in verse 14 I press I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus that word pressed means to run swiftly in order to catch a person or a thing to run after figuratively it means of one who in a race runs swiftly to reach the goal am to pursue in a hostile manner it ain't no time to be cute it ain't no time to be pretty this thing that's holding you has to be pressed against in a hostile manner his brother David was singing the song devil we are over no more and when they sing that song they get that little growl and it ain't no pretty little it ain't no pretty little Sunday school song it's got some up to it it's got some power behind it because we're pressing toward this thing and we're letting all of these things go leaving things behind woman comes to the well that day and she leaves her water pot metaphorically that word means to pursue to seek after eagerly earnestly Endeavor to acquire leaving things behind what is it in your life what is it that's holding you that's trapping you that's that that's causing you to to pull back just a little bit this this this this eternal thing this quality that that we've been given this this life that we've been promised do you not realize the value in it do you real realize the depths of it it's like you know they talking about the little fish in the ocean I'm just going to drink a little bit because I don't want to drink at all no there there's there's a vast amount more you're not going to exhaust this thing there's a lot more to this there's a lot more to God than you realize there's a lot more to God than what you have now I guarantee you that I promise you that because why there's a hunger and desire for more of God and if that hunger and desire is there then that means there's more of God to be have amen cuz if you listen to the devil long enough you will eventually forget your testimony if you listen to him long enough if you stay around and listen what what was her name Nelly Sanders the little dance Queen the prophet called her yeah huh she come to the service and she she gave her life to the Lord and she was Victorious and she thought she got over that demon she got over past all of that but she found herself outside the dance hall one night and because that was familiar to her and she thought she could still attach herself to that when God had already delivered her she stayed just for a little bit to listen cuz that's my jam huh and it caught her attention and there's nothing more that the devil wants than to bring a familiar Jam your way right to get you to pause just for a moment and the prophet goes on to say that before she realized what was happening she was in that dance hall on on the dance floor that's right and not just in the dance hall on the dance floor but she was in the arms of some man who's the man brother Joel The Devil he's wanting you to pause young people listen to me he's wanting you to pause just a little bit here I stand at 54 years old I and I knew a life of sin I knew a life of living out in the world not a lot but it was enough to know that ain't nothing out there that's right sir let me tell you something young people there is not one thing that the devil can give to you that's going to be greater than the things that are in this [Applause] world because the prophet has told us that he is after your soul he don't give one ounce about your body see taste feel smell here Avenues through which we've been given we've been given these these things to to contact this realm so everything that's going to lead you by sight sound touch that's the devil huh well it feels good I better do it no that's what the devil says forgive me you're going to end up with some social disease siroo amen you hear me huh this is real saints the devil wants nothing more than to drag you into hell this world is about to be obliterated everything in time is about to be no more the only thing that shall stand when there will be no time is those things that are of Eternal quality those things that are fulfilling an eternal purpose now the evidence of the Resurrection is in me amen the power of the in fact it's going to be my voice it's going to be your voice it's going to be the voice of the Bride that calls him back just as it was with the children of Israel what did God say I have surely heard your moans I've heard your cries and I've come down to deliver you I've come for your words Hallelujah so what are the words that you're just giving to the atmosphere that you're just giving to that circumstance what are those words well devil maybe I am no I'm here to let you know you are not you are more than that amen amen you're more than that straighten yourself up get away from that girl get away from that boy he ain't no good she ain't no good because listen there's been plenty message boys that's ruined a lot of message girls there's another side to that statement H there's been plenty message girls that's ruined a lot of message boys one thing that that that's always I don't want to say baffled but I just kind of sort of wondered you know within the the the the the depths of the message and everything that's in there you know and I know it was his commission his calling but the the angel of the Lord told the prophet says don't smoke drink or defile your body you don't hear that preached much huh it's just as good for me it's just as good for you as it was for the prophet the devil wants nothing more than to tear you down yeah you look fine Brother po looking good she sees you uhhuh you can take all the Selfies you want to that picture is going to lead you to a path of Hell take it down take it off amen huh yeah s you look cute the prophet says preer what's these splits doing by the way they're coming back what's up with Dad I shut up I should have did that in the first part huh but leaving things behind that's what we have to do she came the the Bible says and upon this came his disciples and marveled that he talked with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou or why talkest thou with her and the woman then left her water pot and went her way into the City and we know I just want to share this and I'll close I promise but if in looking at at this this occurrence in the scriptures we find out that when the discip when she leaves and the disciples begin to inquire and he begins to talk to them and and he begins to tell them he says that say not ye there are yet four months and then cometh Harvest now this woman has just left their company and she's gone into the city to go tell what had just happened to her I don't know the time frame how long it took but the evidence of what she had received and then what she shared came so quickly because Jesus begins to talk to the disciples about the harvest season he says then four months and then cometh the Harvest and and so it took four months genuinely or typically for when you plant something for you begin to see evidence four months four months but this is just a discourse between Jesus and the disciples so that when he's talking to them he he's telling them this in four months but he says behold I say unto you lift up your eyes look coming from the city of Samaria and look on the fields lift up your eyes and look on the fields for they are white already to harvest and we find out that the people of Samaria typically their Garb their dress was white they wore white garments so the power of what this woman received the power of her words the evidence of her Revelations was so magnanimous and it took effect so quickly that Jesus was able to point the disciples immediately to the evidence of what he was bringing so don't back down from this word don't don't don't don't ever take this word and feel ashamed of this word you share this word you live this word you become this word because the word is coming to the word oh yes and as I said it's going to be our voice it calls him back huh oh my father how does the scriptures close out even so come amen come let us bow our heads stand with me Heavenly Father we love you we honor you we adore you oh God we thank you Lord for your word we thank you for your presence we thank you for coming and and and being in this place today oh God we thank you for the evidence and the realities of Malachi 4 and Lord it's not just trapped in the life of a prophet lord it's within me it's in Believers around the world upon every continent upon the face of this earth oh God I believe your word is is is is there that's being propagated it's being lived it's being manifested and oh God I'm longing for to see you I want to see you Lord but father until we get rid of everything that's Earthly until we get rid of everything that's holy us here you're not coming back so Lord you know my purpose you know my unction oh God to illuminate a life just as you did that day the woman at the well she had no idea that she was an eternal creature yet she was religious so God if there would be some here today the Lord that hasn't understood or come to to realize their true worth their true value May the illumination of this word oh God as this overshadowed them as it's crossed their path may they rise up in the new newness of who they are in you oh God granted Lord we love you we thank you Lord for the Simplicity of your gospel the Simplicity of your life it wasn't a simple thing that you did but Lord you gave everything that you had so Lord why should not I why should not we as Believers oh God we're we're we're we're further we're years we're decades oh God into this thing called the message even since the prophet has been called off the scene but Lord where are our lives where is the god of Elijah I want to see you on the scene once again oh God I want to see you doing the things that you did in the days of old through me through my brothers and my sisters because people Lord we need help there are people that's trapped in all kinds of situations many things that they have no control over but oh God the devil has them trapped in that moment in that season in that event in that time lord and they can't get away from it they can't get free from it oh God all of these things pornography Lord stap the minds of both males and females oh God may you just loose them from these things oh Lord we honor you we love you we adore you we thank you for what you're going to do from this service oh God it may not be today but it may be tomorrow if it's not tomorrow it'll be next week because your word says that your word would not return unto you boy oh God we love you we honor you we adore you we thank you oh god oh Lamb of God we thank you for everything that you've done forgive us of our old sinful ways the weariness that we get into sometimes oh God may we be reminded oh Lord the value of Calvary may we still see the blood streaming down from you oh God and we believe oh God that when we see it in that way it will cause us to live a different life Lord but Lord even there at Calvary there's a life on the other side of Calvary there's yet another another thing to do we've got more work to do until you come oh God we thank you we love you we honor you we adore you may we leave things behind may we realize what exactly it is that we need to leave behind it's weighing us down father it's weighing us down we want to get out of here we we want to see you Lord we want you to come may you just come we need you father God we need you every hour every moment every waking moment every sleeping moment oh God we need you the young people need you more now than ever before father I pray Lord if there's a young person here and their mom and dad is not living right and lord they're doing all that they can in that home but Lord may you give them strength to stand oh God may you give them strength to live this life to live this word maybe there's a wavered child a mom and dad longing and aching for their son their daughter oh God may they not give up may they continue to pray and believe go after that young man oh God go after that young lady father Grant it lord they're part of our heritage they're front of our promise may we not give up may we keep the love going projecting forth through their way granted Lord we love you we thank you we thank you for this time we thank you for this opportunity once again Lord we just give you all glory honor and praise and it's in Jesus Christ's name we

10,000 reasons to hate me in my life and he still loves me think about that yes I've given him 10,000 reasons to hate me yes he still loves me just as much as he did when he said let us make man in our own image amen I'm going to have a family I'm going to put him on Earth I'm going to display him I'm going to take them off the Earth I'm going to wipe this thing off and I'm going to bring them back down on the earth and we're going to live there forever amen God bless you we love you but um remember visitors go first and U eat all you want and beat be careful going home um I don't the storm
