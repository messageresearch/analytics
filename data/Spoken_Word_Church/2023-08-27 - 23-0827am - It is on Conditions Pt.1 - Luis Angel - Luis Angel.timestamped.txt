[9:11] you may be seated
[9:15] and is the commentary
[9:19] present Army before we continue with the
[9:21] message I'd like to just quickly present
[9:23] myself
[9:25] uh brother Wade has already mentioned my
[9:28] name
[9:30] my name is
[9:37] a country that's located in South
[9:40] America is
[9:46] we're preaching the Gospel of Jesus
[9:48] Christ a northern part of the capital of
[9:51] of Peru which is Lima
[9:56] and we've been there
[9:59] working about 25 years
[10:03] we've been working in the mission fields
[10:09] and for years as well we've helped also
[10:13] translate the further Brandon's message
[10:15] into Spanish
[10:18] you know that that work hasn't really
[10:21] ended yet
[10:23] it hasn't ended
[10:27] there's still a lot to correct within
[10:29] those messages
[10:33] do you know that there's not 100 percent
[10:36] good translations but
[10:39] we have I said do all that we can
[10:43] material to
[10:46] be able to transmit the character
[10:51] of God's spirit that he left in those
[10:54] messages
[10:56] and it's a very delicate
[11:02] we continue to look over each one of
[11:05] those translations
[11:09] that he would continue to help us
[11:14] in that work
[11:42] the human ways don't really they're not
[11:45] really worth worth it you know compared
[11:48] to Eternal things
[11:56] I'm dedicating myself full time to what
[11:59] to the word of God
[12:00] [Music]
[12:05] he would just provide for each one of us
[12:09] let us continue
[12:12] English
[12:15] in the scriptures that we just read
[12:23] we look at a very important declaration
[12:27] here
[12:28] Pablo Paul esta
[12:32] La personas he's telling the people
[12:35] there in Corinthians the Corinthians
[12:42] the reason why he has changed his
[12:46] decision why he's of his visit
[12:54] you know the people in Corinthians they
[12:57] were up here spiritually
[12:59] so just apparently they seem like they
[13:02] were up here
[13:18] we'll stay at seven you know
[13:20] brother Brandon said
[13:23] that the message that he preached they
[13:25] said it's the same message
[13:27] that Paul preached it's a mean woman it
[13:31] says the same one
[13:35] many people don't identify that it's the
[13:38] exact message
[13:40] because they don't they don't understand
[13:44] what's written in this old book
[13:47] said
[14:30] how many have read all the Bible the
[14:33] whole Bible
[14:35] good
[14:37] muy bien great
[14:39] it's wonderful
[14:45] you know I I haven't received that
[14:48] feedback
[14:51] there's places where Nobody Has Lifted
[14:54] their hand no one wow
[14:58] and not even the pasture
[15:00] that's incredible it's very incredible
[15:09] elements
[15:13] I've had the opportunity to travel other
[15:16] countries
[15:19] Spanish-speaking countries
[15:21] and also English-speaking countries
[15:25] and I've had the opportunity they're
[15:28] starting services
[15:30] to be in question and answer services
[15:33] for ministers
[15:36] and this question always comes up
[16:01] if you are not sure
[16:04] the Holy Spirit
[16:05] [Music]
[16:06] um
[16:09] supposedly
[16:11] that knows and reads
[16:14] and that he had that he has the holy
[16:16] ghosts
[16:19] you remember that faith comes by here
[16:22] and in here and by the word of God
[16:26] it's something that's very incredible
[16:30] America they're not just in Latin
[16:32] America
[16:33] but even here in the United States
[16:36] we receive those types of testimonies
[16:42] it's time to get serious
[16:49] and we have people out here
[16:52] walking on four legs
[16:56] they're saying that they call it they're
[16:58] saying that they're horses
[17:00] literally he's meaning literally
[17:03] it's out here in America
[17:06] in another place
[17:10] it's incredible amen
[17:19] in California many of these things they
[17:22] come from California
[17:25] La marijuana marijuana
[17:29] and these the things with the with the
[17:33] uh um about the gender yeah gender yeah
[17:43] comes from out west
[17:47] California and do you know what's
[17:49] happening in California California
[17:54] in the last 10 years acresido has grown
[17:58] in this
[18:01] the the the the the uneducated uh the
[18:06] uneducated have has grown
[18:09] in California people in California don't
[18:12] read
[18:24] so where did you get those statistics
[18:27] they're in your statistics
[18:31] the ones who sell uh books in California
[18:35] they don't sell as much books in
[18:37] California
[18:38] dinero not because the people don't have
[18:41] money
[18:42] they have a lot of money
[18:44] but they don't know how to read
[18:46] and because they don't know how to read
[18:48] no laying they don't read and because
[18:51] they don't read
[18:53] we have all those things that are coming
[18:56] from there
[19:01] and you know where a lot of the strange
[19:04] things in the message come from
[19:06] people that don't know don't don't read
[19:09] the word
[19:11] amen
[19:16] the Bible condemns polygamy foreign for
[19:21] example
[19:23] is doodle it's difficult
[19:27] it's something difficult to say and to
[19:31] recognize
[19:32] but it's time for us to confront those
[19:35] things
[19:39] we're about 60 years since the seals
[19:42] have been opened
[19:47] we're supposed to be walking in Heavenly
[19:49] places in Christ Jesus
[19:54] we're supposed to be walking in eternity
[20:04] it's finished
[20:08] 60 years
[20:12] and we still have those things happening
[20:15] amongst us
[20:17] bringing stumbling blocks you know
[20:20] amongst the camp
[20:49] we have to go through the filter of the
[20:51] word
[21:05] there are many people today that baptize
[21:07] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[21:11] it's true
[21:13] we're not the only ones
[21:16] in James it says do you believe that God
[21:20] is
[21:22] the same thing
[21:40] the thing is they they can't live the
[21:42] word
[21:46] we are called to live the world
[21:49] man
[21:54] the the spoken word does not gossip
[22:01] the spoken word does not fornicate
[22:05] doesn't commit adultery
[22:10] the spoken word
[22:13] will never deny the word
[22:25] in this verse he's telling us
[22:29] that if it's true
[22:34] he has changed his decision to not visit
[22:36] Corinthians
[22:39] but it brings us a reality
[22:43] that the promises of God
[22:52] are in Jesus Christ see yay
[23:01] he fulfilled all the conditions
[23:07] that he made so that the work could be
[23:09] fulfilled
[23:11] you know God has made given us promises
[23:15] but we need to unite the conditions
[23:19] that he has made
[23:21] not that church has made
[23:24] or that the pastors have made
[23:27] he has made the conditions
[23:30] Jesus United all the conditions
[23:34] he came to be the word made flesh
[23:38] all the promises of God were fulfilled
[23:42] so we can say Amen to those
[23:48] but that's only if you know what those
[23:50] promises are are in in Jesus
[23:54] it's very important to know the
[23:56] scriptures
[23:58] we're not going to understand the
[24:00] message
[24:03] there's a brother
[24:08] a couple of years ago he left this
[24:11] message
[24:13] and he he did an interview on on a
[24:18] Portuguese television uh Network and he
[24:22] said okay
[24:25] that he had not made had the opportunity
[24:28] to study the word because
[24:33] of the messages fault
[24:40] and this is the message the voice of the
[24:42] sign
[24:43] look what he says
[24:47] the Bible says
[24:51] the Bible says
[24:59] I don't know how you can say that you
[25:02] can use that as an excuse
[25:04] that's studying the message
[25:08] and it prevents you from studying the
[25:10] Bible
[25:12] because the same
[25:15] propheti says the Bible says
[25:19] when brother Brandon breaks the Seven
[25:21] Seals
[25:28] contrary to description
[25:31] even if the angel himself told them
[25:34] because for him it was important
[25:37] that all his ministries were they
[25:41] scriptural
[25:43] amen
[25:50] is
[25:52] I've been speaking to other brothers uh
[25:55] older brothers in the message
[25:58] brothers from the first days for the
[26:02] first times when the message was
[26:04] introduced
[26:07] and you know I'm not I'm not old I'm not
[26:10] that old is
[26:16] and I thought that all of this was just
[26:18] a garden of Eternity
[26:22] [Laughter]
[26:25] pero but
[26:27] okay
[26:30] India but you see all those things that
[26:33] we see nowadays song espiritus they're
[26:36] just Spirits
[26:38] Spirits don't die
[26:41] the person to the other one generation
[26:44] to the other
[26:48] so that that doesn't touch us
[26:51] remember the church needs to Be watchful
[26:55] not just the pastor
[26:57] the church all of us
[27:02] you you you the pastor watches over you
[27:05] you watch over the pasture
[27:08] amen
[27:11] the prophet of God says
[27:14] that when the word when the when man
[27:16] leaves the word when man leaves the word
[27:21] you just leave the man
[27:23] is that correct
[27:26] because when you leave the word
[27:31] that's the reason why all these things
[27:33] strange things that we see coming up
[27:38] you know fornication isn't necessarily
[27:40] the physical act
[27:42] you first have to corrupt the word you
[27:46] first had to corrupt the truth
[27:47] when you corrupt the truth about them
[27:50] Romans
[27:53] then you see the the that's the fruits
[27:56] of that
[27:58] that's right you leave your your pizza
[28:01] to pizza to pizza
[28:03] your Pizza Company
[28:07] you leave your pizza outside
[28:11] okay if you leave a pizza or a piece of
[28:13] food outside the thing
[28:16] exposed to to the elements it's going to
[28:18] start corrupting yeah
[28:24] if you need to keep it you need to put
[28:27] it in the refrigerator you know if you
[28:28] need to keep it longer
[28:30] this is the Fountain of Life
[28:33] this is going to Keep Us Alive
[28:38] and while you're covered more and more
[28:41] with the word
[28:47] you're going to be able to prevent more
[28:49] and more of these things more and more
[28:52] of these attacks
[28:55] you know in the days of Jesus
[28:58] the people were forgetting or forgot
[29:01] what was going to happen
[29:04] what they had at that time was their own
[29:06] interpretation
[29:08] or their own ideas
[29:12] because they had forgotten this
[29:16] you go to the Book of Judges
[29:20] how does the Book of Judges start
[29:24] the people in that day did what was good
[29:27] in their eyes
[29:30] the ones who have read the Book of
[29:33] Judges know what that says
[29:36] just as if there was no word
[29:39] just as if they were no they were not
[29:42] Israelites
[29:48] they worshiped the gods of other nations
[29:52] but they were now worshiping the true
[29:53] Living God
[29:54] they knew about Baal
[29:59] they knew about astronauts
[30:03] they knew all about the other gods
[30:07] they did not know about the true Living
[30:10] God
[30:12] and in the Book of Judges chapter 19
[30:15] verses 20 and 21. you know what happened
[30:18] there
[30:21] some some are looking or shaking their
[30:24] head some are not sure
[30:27] the benjamites Casio foreign
[30:51] because of fornication
[30:56] they raped a woman almost killing her
[31:00] right
[31:01] and do you know how that happened
[31:05] the Levi or the husband of that woman
[31:09] she he cut her up in pieces
[31:12] and sent the pieces
[31:15] each one of the leaders of the tribes of
[31:18] Israel
[31:20] the leaders of the tribe said
[31:26] have we seen something like that
[31:28] happened before and do you know what
[31:30] they did
[31:32] he said we're just gonna go they said
[31:34] that we're gonna just gonna kill them
[31:35] all
[31:36] all right
[31:42] and they had to eradicate evil
[31:45] we're not going to kill anybody nowadays
[31:51] we should describe the situations
[31:57] you know many people they confuse you
[32:01] describing the situation with speaking
[32:04] badly
[32:05] but understand
[32:09] one thing is to speak badly
[32:12] but it's another thing is to describe
[32:15] the situation
[32:18] and it's what Paul is teaching us
[32:22] Paul gives names
[32:25] he speaks of certain things that had
[32:27] happened
[32:28] telling the people the personas of
[32:32] people
[32:33] of things that are happening in their
[32:36] midst
[32:37] so that they would not be deceived
[32:43] you know it doesn't it doesn't deal with
[32:46] it's not about well it's your problem so
[32:49] you move on with that
[33:04] say something
[33:06] have you have you read that or have you
[33:08] seen that
[33:10] is
[33:11] and sometimes we just stay quiet about
[33:14] things
[33:15] in the message
[33:21] let's continue
[33:24] are we still okay
[33:32] um
[33:38] we're gonna read a couple of quotes here
[33:42] in the message influence
[33:48] and preached in January 12 1963.
[33:53] you know for me it's important for me to
[33:56] say that is
[33:59] I've heard many people say that brother
[34:02] Brown said
[34:05] and when you look back and see what
[34:07] supposedly brother Branham said yeah and
[34:10] it's not there
[34:15] so it's important that when you quote
[34:17] the prophet is
[34:20] a word where it's at
[34:24] because many false doctrines
[34:29] have risen because of supposed quotes of
[34:33] the prophet
[34:35] and look what it says here
[34:41] we're told in Revelation 10 that there
[34:43] will be a messenger in the last day I
[34:45] mean
[34:48] we'll gather up these little ends and
[34:51] we'll bring them together
[34:56] and then the mystery of God would be
[34:59] finished
[35:00] Revelations 10 7.
[35:06] at the sounding of this Angel which was
[35:08] a messenger of the Earth
[35:10] all that is history
[35:12] it's history
[35:14] Todo Los Cabos
[35:17] all of the all of the the Loose Ends
[35:21] have been have been taught together
[35:23] and the Mystery of God has been finished
[35:28] that you understand it that's another
[35:31] thing yeah
[35:32] or that has or that has been revealed to
[35:36] you that's a that's a different thing
[35:39] you know Revelations 10 1-7 that's the
[35:42] messenger right
[35:48] that's you and me
[35:51] and Don says
[35:53] so that has to come progressively
[35:56] amen
[35:58] Legos
[36:05] then then one came down from heaven with
[36:07] his hands up rainbow over his head and
[36:10] swore that there would be time no more
[36:13] an angel taken an oath
[36:18] and when we see this thing is
[36:20] materializing
[36:23] let us pause here for just a moment
[36:27] do you see the order
[36:30] he first he first uh spoke about the the
[36:34] terrestrial messenger or the illegal
[36:39] he speaks of the angel that descended
[36:41] from Heaven
[36:44] you and me know what the order of that
[36:46] is in the scriptures
[36:50] we're not going to initiate a new
[36:52] doctrine saying that this one comes
[36:53] first or this one comes second
[36:56] that's in in the in the preaching yeah
[37:03] sometimes people say oh well no this is
[37:06] the order of the scripture but no no no
[37:08] no no no
[37:09] but we have to we have to know the
[37:11] scriptures
[37:12] and we see how that works
[37:18] when all these see these things
[37:20] materialize
[37:21] in 1963
[37:24] materialism when we see this thing
[37:27] materializing it's Historia that's
[37:29] that's history yes that has happened
[37:32] right
[37:33] it's materialized look what it says
[37:39] how sincere
[37:41] we should be
[37:44] how many are sincere
[38:19] of knowledge
[38:26] he said those
[38:28] all Promises of God are true
[38:31] but they're they're unconditioned
[38:35] one condition
[38:38] all every promise has its condition
[38:42] the Bible says that we're they were
[38:44] healed
[38:46] but it has a condition
[38:52] no matter how fundamentally right we are
[38:55] the names
[38:57] we've got to approach it in the right
[39:00] way
[39:02] we've got to approach it in the right
[39:04] way
[39:06] fundamentally now man can be
[39:09] fundamentally right
[39:12] and still not receive the blessings
[39:18] because it's approached in the wrong way
[39:22] it goes upon conditions
[39:27] we have to bring the conditions together
[39:31] seek ye first the kingdom of God
[39:34] and his righteousness
[39:38] and all these other things shall be
[39:40] added unto you
[39:42] we have to seek the kingdom of God
[39:46] you want to see the things of the word
[39:48] happen in your life
[39:52] surround yourself with the word
[39:55] surround yourself with the word
[39:59] El Domingo only just on Sunday
[40:03] only just on Wednesday oh Los alvados or
[40:07] just on Saturday
[40:19] and at night
[40:23] every time every day
[40:28] I was speaking to a pastor here one time
[40:31] North America from here from America
[40:40] and I was talking to him I was asking
[40:43] him why him and his people don't read
[40:45] the Bible
[40:47] and he told me well we just don't have
[40:49] time
[40:53] but they have Netflix app on their cell
[40:56] phone
[41:01] a small series there on Netflix see a
[41:06] small series there on Netflix how long
[41:08] does that last yeah
[41:19] [Laughter]
[41:23] the Deacon is looking at me so he's
[41:26] writing down
[41:28] writing things down
[41:39] the video side of Amazon
[41:44] and yet they don't have time
[41:49] we have people today that preach
[41:55] they'll go to the table app
[42:01] they'll say they'll think I'm going to
[42:03] talk about speak about love
[42:05] they'll put love in there
[42:08] and they'll find all the quotes about
[42:11] love
[42:12] search
[42:14] they'll decide on a few quotes
[42:17] and they'll look in the Bible
[42:20] in their in their app
[42:24] and they'll put love in there and
[42:27] they'll search
[42:29] they'll search they'll select a few
[42:31] scriptures there
[42:34] they'll put them on a word
[42:36] and that's the message
[42:41] and if you ask them something that's not
[42:44] in their notes they don't know
[42:50] if you ask him a little something more
[42:52] about more in depth about that scripture
[42:55] they just read they can't explain it to
[42:58] you
[43:00] God help us
[43:07] if I ask you about your Farms that you
[43:10] have here
[43:14] you're going to tell me Well a
[43:16] Gainesville over there is the capital is
[43:18] the chicken capital of the of the world
[43:21] and you're going to describe to me
[43:23] everything that's there
[43:24] even though you don't work there
[43:27] you know all about Gainesville
[43:30] what about the word
[43:35] we should know the word
[43:39] amen amen
[43:41] the word of God is not something that's
[43:44] antiquated
[43:45] is something that should be present yes
[43:49] it should be something present it should
[43:52] be future
[43:54] yeah amen
[43:59] even Paul says
[44:01] if an angel from heaven
[44:04] speak something even this contrary to
[44:07] this word
[44:08] that you should not hear it
[44:13] let it be a curse yeah
[44:21] I'm trying to soften things up a little
[44:22] bit
[44:24] check this pasta
[44:33] you know we've seen those that mistake
[44:35] before
[44:38] the word of God says
[44:41] that this word is
[44:44] it's in the book of Psalms is
[44:48] useful for the child
[44:50] for the young person
[44:54] and for the Elder
[45:06] I dedicated myself to read the
[45:09] scriptures with all the brethren in our
[45:11] church literally
[45:14] contotos with all of them
[45:17] none of them escaped
[45:20] there's a few Rebels there but
[45:25] in 2023 comments
[45:30] we started the year with more people
[45:34] that now knew the scriptures more
[45:35] services our services are different now
[45:41] the people they react towards what they
[45:44] they know
[45:46] because they know that
[45:48] do you know what an amen means
[45:52] it means that's correct let it be so
[45:56] nothing they know
[45:58] yeah
[46:02] I don't need to say well if you don't
[46:05] jump up you're not part of the bride of
[46:07] Christ
[46:12] we're not we're not professional
[46:14] animators
[46:18] the people react to the word
[46:23] if they don't react to the words because
[46:25] they're not in that same channel of the
[46:26] word
[46:33] and Paul didn't say that we're going to
[46:36] preach just because depending on the
[46:38] amens that you get
[46:44] we understand that the spirit of God
[46:47] works depending on your need
[46:49] it's true that is true
[46:55] but remember it's it it's a deep
[46:57] clemando Colin
[47:00] another deep respondent
[47:03] S
[47:05] I don't believe that I'm saying these
[47:08] things just because I want to yeah
[47:11] I believe maybe there was a need for
[47:13] that to say this you're reacting to that
[47:17] I don't know you
[47:20] humanly but he knows us
[47:30] some of this is off the cuff
[47:33] but he's the one who is the leader
[47:37] God help us
[47:40] and
[47:41] so all these things
[47:44] it takes us to this point
[47:47] all the promises of God is with us
[47:50] they're they're true
[47:54] our promises of God are true but their
[47:56] own condition
[47:59] S
[48:01] no matter how fundamentally right we are
[48:07] we've got to approach it in the right
[48:09] way
[48:11] all right we're going to continue a
[48:13] little further for example says for
[48:16] instance
[48:19] when Ahab and Jehoshaphat were together
[48:24] you know who Ahab was right
[48:28] the majority good job good brother good
[48:36] the pastor might be saying okay you're
[48:39] wearing me now brother
[48:42] no no no no no no no not about here
[48:49] he means like wait a second they don't
[48:51] know who Ahab was
[48:54] [Laughter]
[49:00] for instance when a heaven Jehoshaphat
[49:02] were together
[49:07] really belong to Israel
[49:09] Israel
[49:31] with the food that should be given to
[49:33] Israel
[49:34] fundamentals
[49:37] fundamentally Ahab was right yes
[49:41] and that's the reason 400 Hebrew
[49:43] prophets
[49:45] with one Accord we're prophesied
[49:48] go on up to raymith
[49:51] in other words
[49:53] it's ours
[49:56] okay all right
[49:58] but there was a condition
[50:05] so fundamentally they were right
[50:12] wasn't right himself
[50:15] he was a pagan he was a a a wicked one
[50:22] he was he was departed from the Lord
[50:28] episode
[50:30] and when this one little man stood up by
[50:34] the name of Micah the son of imla
[50:37] unavision and saw a vision
[50:40] now one now one man's Vision
[50:45] against 400 trained prophets
[50:49] but the man's Vision
[50:53] compared with the word
[51:09] we must be sure
[51:12] amen
[51:16] Brethren it's important
[51:19] that we know all these things
[51:22] all those details God help us God help
[51:27] us
[51:31] let's go to another quote real quick
[51:37] time is our worst enemy
[51:49] you know when when I need to teach in my
[51:52] church
[51:54] we give it you know more time
[52:00] but I understand the limitation here so
[52:03] later this afternoon we'll continue
[52:05] look what the prophet of God said
[52:09] in the message God keeps his word
[52:12] someone would say
[52:15] but that's from 1957.
[52:19] what's the problem with that
[52:25] no no no
[52:27] there's people that say oh from 63 on up
[52:30] and that's all
[52:31] no no no no
[52:35] it was called to his Commission in 1946.
[52:46] the angel tell them you know store the
[52:49] food
[52:50] where they go and look foreign
[53:25] you
[53:28] have over 1200 sermons
[53:36] some of you here have have lived many
[53:39] decades now in many years knowing this
[53:42] message
[53:43] corrector is that true is that true
[53:49] have you read all the messages right
[53:54] absolutely no no
[53:59] you are you are responding
[54:04] don't worry
[54:08] we have a great responsibility
[54:12] we have a great responsibility
[54:16] God will will will demand of us
[54:23] of all these things that we're saying
[54:25] the evil around
[54:28] and we're speaking against Spirits
[54:33] we're speaking against powers
[54:39] we're fighting against those things
[54:45] all the demons are against the bride
[54:48] right
[54:50] he is for us amen
[54:56] says Doctrine
[55:00] experience can't be based upon some
[55:03] experience
[55:24] excuse me Doctrine is based on God's
[55:27] word
[55:28] and God help us God help us
[55:32] let's just pause there for a moment and
[55:36] we will continue later this afternoon
[55:37] you pray for me
[55:41] that I would be able to bring these
[55:44] things together
[55:46] not that I'm not doing it well

[55:52] much as possible
[55:54] so that we could be blessed

[56:24] days of Jesus
[56:25] the scripture tells us
[56:28] that he would teach the word foreign
[57:15] and you know many many North Americans
[57:18] think that salvation is by works
[57:21] so what their dollars can do yeah
[57:25] we need the holy spirit of God
[57:29] working through us
