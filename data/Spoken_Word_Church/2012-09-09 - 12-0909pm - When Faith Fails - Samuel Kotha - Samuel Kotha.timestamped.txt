[20:41] i would like to read words 31 and 32.
[20:47] saint luke chapter 22
[20:50] verse 31 and 32.
[21:06] and the lord said
[21:09] simon simon behold
[21:13] satan has desired to have you
[21:17] that you may sift you as sweet
[21:20] but i have prayed for thee
[21:24] that thy faith failed not
[21:26] and then thou art converted strengthened
[21:28] thy brethren
[21:30] may the lord had a blessing to the
[21:32] reading of his word
[21:34] thank you very much you all made me sick
[21:38] this morning we were
[21:40] talking about
[21:42] undisputed value
[21:45] undisputed value of faith right amen
[21:48] this afternoon the lord willing i would
[21:50] like to speak on
[21:59] i'd like to speak
[22:00] on
[22:02] when faith fails
[22:07] i the lord was dealing with my heart i
[22:10] woke up this morning and i wanted to
[22:12] because i asked yesterday brothers dale
[22:15] and i said
[22:16] uh brother daley would like to take the
[22:18] morning service
[22:20] because i knew there was a visitor
[22:22] wednesday and he said no no you're going
[22:25] to have both the service
[22:26] yeah i said okay
[22:29] so
[22:30] i wake up four o'clock maybe because of
[22:32] the fear or
[22:34] you know how it is you know to preach to
[22:36] services
[22:38] and i began to pray and ask the lord to
[22:40] lead me
[22:41] and the lord laid on my heart and
[22:44] i believe
[22:45] um he will bless us one more time
[22:49] amen and i would like to go on the
[22:51] positive side it may looks like a
[22:54] negative title
[22:56] for the subject when faith fails
[22:59] but i would like to go on the positive
[23:01] side of it
[23:02] and see that our faith doesn't fail
[23:05] right
[23:06] and we saw this morning that the faith
[23:08] will bring results
[23:10] fear has no value right right right
[23:13] he has no value right now but faith can
[23:16] bring results right amen faith can move
[23:19] mountains
[23:21] but when that faith fails
[23:24] then we are in deep trouble
[23:26] i like to just show few certain things
[23:29] what the prophet has said
[23:31] you know about faith when
[23:33] faith fails
[23:34] and this particular scripture
[23:37] we look at uh peter yeah we spoke little
[23:40] about peter this morning but peter
[23:43] was a key man
[23:45] peter had the revelation
[23:47] right he had the right revelation
[23:50] and the revelation was confirmed by the
[23:52] lord jesus christ
[23:54] because jesus said peter flesh and blood
[23:57] had not revealed it unto you
[23:59] but my father which is in heaven had
[24:01] revealed it unto you
[24:03] so he had the right revelation he had it
[24:06] from the right source
[24:08] and the revelation was right and being
[24:10] confirmed
[24:11] by the lord himself right amen
[24:13] what a blessed thing that was right
[24:16] and nobody had revelation about jesus
[24:18] christ
[24:19] he wasn't he was a preacher peter was a
[24:22] preacher
[24:23] peter had received the
[24:25] the power
[24:27] on demons to cast away right
[24:30] and he had the
[24:32] power to heal sickness
[24:34] sick people were healed through his
[24:36] ministry
[24:38] but um a man of this caliber a man of
[24:42] this cattle
[24:44] when you think about peter you know
[24:46] having the keys of the kingdom of god
[24:49] right having the authority keys means
[24:51] the power the authority right
[24:53] and having the authority of the kingdom
[24:56] of god you know heaven and the doors
[24:58] being you know he he could unlose it and
[25:02] he can bind it he can close it he could
[25:04] shed it he had the power in his hand
[25:06] that's the reason you know when he was
[25:08] filled with the holy ghost he was the
[25:10] first one to stand up right and to speak
[25:13] what he was doing he was unlocking the
[25:15] doors of him
[25:17] he was unlocking the doors of heaven so
[25:19] that the bride of jesus christ could
[25:21] enter in exactly you know he was a great
[25:24] man he was an important man
[25:26] but you know devil desired him to heaven
[25:31] and heaven and not only that and he was
[25:34] sitting him like wheat
[25:36] i don't know whether he you know about
[25:38] it not because this country is a country
[25:41] of technology with machines but you know
[25:43] when we in india when we go through the
[25:46] field and have our harvest uh complete
[25:49] you know that's the time
[25:51] some of the people who are poor doesn't
[25:53] have machines to do we got good tractors
[25:56] now we got good uh uh you know harvest
[25:58] machines and that can separate the wheat
[26:01] and the ch and the chaff but you know in
[26:03] the india when i was a little boy or in
[26:06] my young age um
[26:08] of course i'm not old now
[26:11] i'm still a young man according to your
[26:13] american standard i'm just a kid right
[26:15] right so you know
[26:17] so you know when i was growing up in my
[26:20] tens i i've seen people you know taking
[26:23] the the the harvest and trying to you
[26:26] know put it spread it and and the oxen
[26:30] will will walk upon them right you know
[26:33] and and that will bring the grain out of
[26:35] the shaft but sometimes the grain had
[26:37] the uh shaft over it so what they used
[26:40] to do you know they used to beat upon
[26:42] the upon the thing and then they take a
[26:44] uh take uh
[26:47] a fan you know
[26:49] we got a certain
[26:51] certain way we have it that we put the
[26:53] seeds in it grains in it and you know
[26:55] people begin to
[26:57] to sift
[26:58] you know when when they save because of
[27:00] the wind you know the shaft used to fly
[27:02] away and the wheat stays in the in the
[27:08] you know the devil
[27:09] is a cheat he's a liar we know that
[27:12] right we know that the devil has no
[27:14] authority over us
[27:16] but we should be very careful he has an
[27:18] access right
[27:20] anywhere he want to that's what the
[27:22] prophet said right right you know there
[27:24] was a meeting going on conference going
[27:26] on one time in heaven when the sons of
[27:28] god came to to their father to the
[27:31] heavenly father and they were talking
[27:33] and and then slowly you know this guy
[27:35] guys
[27:37] sneaked in right he came inside and you
[27:39] know the lord saw him they said hi
[27:42] friend how are you said i'm flying he
[27:44] said where are you going from where are
[27:45] you coming he said who i'm from
[27:49] you know all over the world
[27:50] so he has access all over the world
[27:53] whether you are indian african american
[27:55] australian chinese or japanese whatever
[27:58] he access he have an access every place
[28:01] every continent on this place of this
[28:03] earth but he also has access into the
[28:05] presence of god
[28:07] now that's what the scripture is
[28:08] teaching us right
[28:09] and if he has an access into the kingdom
[28:11] of god then he has access over in our
[28:14] homes
[28:15] to come inside of our homes he has
[28:17] access to us he can come and talk to us
[28:20] he can come and whisper to us and that's
[28:23] the time we can you know be an ignorant
[28:26] we can be a little bit foolish in our
[28:28] thinking and we can be a little
[28:29] discouraged or you know broken sometimes
[28:32] because of our situation and we can fall
[28:35] into the trap of the devil right and he
[28:37] can have us and he can have us and he
[28:39] can move us and he can you know you can
[28:42] he can do whatever he wants to do
[28:44] but you know brother sister that's what
[28:46] was happening to peter
[28:48] because jesus being god in flesh the
[28:52] word became flesh he knew what was going
[28:54] to happen in the future in the near
[28:57] future when he was about to be caught by
[28:59] the by the roman people and and he was
[29:02] to be crucified and he knew what was
[29:04] exactly happening you know in few days
[29:07] later time and and he knew that peter
[29:10] would just deny him right
[29:13] he knew what was the situation peter was
[29:15] to go and you know but thank god that
[29:18] god saw his future god saw what is going
[29:22] to happen in the near future and what
[29:25] did jesus do he just not let him go but
[29:27] he prayed for him right oh i'm so
[29:30] thankful to the lord my lord because he
[29:32] prayed for peter
[29:34] and i believe my brother my sister my
[29:36] brother my my bible tells me he not only
[29:40] prayed for peter but he prayed for us
[29:42] too
[29:44] he plainly says that he doesn't pray for
[29:47] the people of the world but he prays for
[29:49] the people who have given to me amen
[29:52] praise
[29:52] we believe we are his children we are
[29:54] these people and the prayer has been
[29:57] made all right all right aren't you glad
[29:59] for that right
[30:01] i would like to just talk to this little
[30:03] young man young sisters and young
[30:05] brothers you know sometimes you are
[30:07] mischievous sometimes you are naughty
[30:08] sometimes you are disobedient i'm not

[30:13] this is what i came through that
[30:15] i was naughty i will mischievous you
[30:17] know not bad but a good one
[30:20] you know every
[30:27] we give hard times to our father and
[30:28] mother
[30:30] you know sometimes we are grown up
[30:31] people like this and sometimes we give
[30:33] out time to the pastor
[30:38] my sister we give hard time we're human
[30:40] beings you know sometimes we become
[30:42] mischievous sometimes we become naughty
[30:44] but let me tell you one thing you know
[30:47] somebody is praying for us right
[30:57] fastly you know it is not them it is the
[30:59] spirit in them that rides the automobile
[31:03] see but you know nothing happens to us
[31:05] why yeah
[31:08] we break the law sometimes nothing
[31:09] happens to us
[31:11] sometimes we are close to an accident
[31:13] but nothing happens to us why because
[31:16] somebody your father or your mother is
[31:19] praying for you amen
[31:21] are you listening to me
[31:24] somebody's praying amen remember your
[31:26] pastor is praying for your dear man amen
[31:29] ah every time he thinks about you he
[31:31] prays for you because he cares for you
[31:34] he loves you
[31:35] he cares for yourself right
[31:38] thank god that jesus prayed for peter
[31:41] amen that's right i want to read
[31:43] something very astounding you will be i
[31:46] i know you might have uh you might have
[31:48] read that you know i don't say you
[31:50] didn't read or didn't hear but i would
[31:52] like to tell you uh brother branham
[31:54] speaking about about peter and he said
[31:57] when jesus prayed for peter said i will
[32:00] pray that your faith fail not listen to
[32:03] me very carefully this is the words of
[32:05] the prophet he said
[32:06] i will pray that your faith fail not
[32:10] not is more else
[32:11] because they did yeah yeah
[32:14] think about it right
[32:17] jesus was concerned about his faith
[32:20] more than anything am i glory right and
[32:23] according to the statement the prophet
[32:25] meant he did fail in his mortals
[32:28] that's what peter yeah i'm sure amen
[32:31] with such a great
[32:33] ministry
[32:35] such a great power
[32:37] operating in his ministry healing the
[32:39] sea casting out demons you know raising
[32:41] the dead raising the lamb laying in all
[32:44] kinds of things
[32:47] but
[32:49] jesus was praying
[32:51] for his faith
[32:54] peter let not your faith fail right amen
[32:57] because that's the dangerous thing you
[32:59] can you can think of
[33:01] the prophet of god says remember as long
[33:05] as the fate lasts
[33:07] as long as when your faith is lasting
[33:10] when your faith fails then your
[33:13] experience is gone
[33:17] your experience with god is finished
[33:19] right
[33:20] it's based that way simply upon the
[33:23] finished words of
[33:25] christ at calvary
[33:27] you know we need to keep up our faith
[33:30] because once your faith is failing your
[33:34] experience with god fails
[33:36] your healing will fail right right amen
[33:40] your joy will fail right
[33:43] your stability in christian life will
[33:45] fail right
[33:47] your whole thing fails right because
[33:49] faith is the foundation right
[33:52] now brother sam has come here from india
[33:55] and trying to teach us abc
[33:57] yeah yeah
[33:58] but brother sister sometimes abc is very
[34:00] good
[34:02] you know it sounds funny it sounds you
[34:04] know hey this is we have learned in uh
[34:06] kindergarten which is good yeah but
[34:09] sometimes you know when you do
[34:10] mathematics you know you you have to
[34:13] look for a formula which you learned in
[34:15] second third class
[34:17] sometimes if you forget that formula you
[34:20] cannot finish this uh this uh problem
[34:23] right whatever you call you know if you
[34:25] lose that formula right right so
[34:27] sometimes we think this formula is too
[34:29] basic but brother sister you know faith
[34:32] is the foundation where we stand right
[34:34] and the faith we have is of god and the
[34:36] faith is victorious faith can bring
[34:38] results faith can change a situation
[34:41] faith can remove mountains you know
[34:43] faith is the greatest thing by faith
[34:46] we can counter everything we can have
[34:48] everything by faith but when this faith
[34:51] fails
[34:52] man we are in great trouble
[34:55] look what he says uh sometimes you know
[34:57] a weak person weak in faith came to the
[35:00] prophet of god and and he he began to
[35:03] talk to brother branham and he said you
[35:05] know what i think
[35:07] i don't have enough faith because i
[35:09] cannot keep my healing you know and and
[35:12] he was discouraged that brother reno was
[35:14] talking about that man and he was
[35:15] discouraged and he began to say you know
[35:18] you know what the basis of divine
[35:20] healing is not on the same level as on
[35:23] salvation right think about that but
[35:25] salvation when you receive jesus christ
[35:28] you are born again and you are you are
[35:30] you have an immortal life that cannot
[35:32] perish or get old it can never die right
[35:35] okay it's just finished forever when
[35:38] you're born of the spirit of god but he
[35:40] said this body it gets sick it becomes
[35:43] weak god helps us heals us we get sick
[35:46] again
[35:48] and it's just temporarily until the
[35:50] journey is finished but salvation is
[35:53] permanent right forever
[35:55] amen that doesn't fail right so
[35:58] salvation is totally different right
[36:01] sometimes we become discouraged because
[36:04] we are sick again
[36:06] the sickness doesn't lean and this man
[36:08] came to the prophet and he said you know
[36:10] what being disconnected he said i don't
[36:12] think i've got enough faith you know
[36:14] because i lost my healing and then the
[36:16] prophet goes forward and he says you
[36:18] cannot lose your healing right
[36:22] because jesus protested right it is
[36:26] yours
[36:27] the only thing we like is we don't claim
[36:31] it just like our sister was testifying
[36:33] he she claims
[36:36] she claims her brother whosoever it is
[36:39] she claims him right and brother sister
[36:41] you know we need to have enough faith
[36:44] first for ourselves
[36:48] and we apply token for ourselves
[36:50] if we have faith we apply the token and
[36:53] then we can apply the token
[36:56] by the same faith we have for ourselves
[36:59] what our loved ones
[37:01] that's what person is talking about
[37:03] we can apply the token against their
[37:07] wish right
[37:08] absolutely amen
[37:10] sure
[37:11] what a blessing
[37:13] what a blessedness
[37:15] we can apply the token
[37:18] against their wish of they hate this
[37:20] message you can still apply
[37:23] amen you can still apply the token
[37:25] but they hate this church you can still
[37:28] apply the token but they hate this
[37:30] bastard you can still apply the token
[37:33] brother sister it
[37:35] way it is not our life it is not our
[37:37] doings it is not our goodness it is not
[37:40] our righteousness but the faith we have
[37:43] today glory if the faith has saved us
[37:47] it can't save anything
[37:52] and you can claim your loved ones
[37:56] you can clean your logo that's right i
[37:58] will tell you one thing my wife
[38:01] she cries for her for her brother
[38:05] her brother is the only brother she got
[38:08] and she always cries for him because he
[38:10] doesn't go to church
[38:12] because he doesn't serve the lord
[38:14] her mother was praying she's going to be
[38:16] with the lord a very good believer but
[38:19] she's going to be with the lord but she
[38:21] always prayed day and night oh god i
[38:24] pray for my son i pray for my son lord
[38:27] bring him lord save his soul
[38:29] and you know sometimes they cry and the
[38:32] family meets they cry and they're
[38:34] discouraged you know and they're broken
[38:36] and one day i came i said you know what
[38:38] i would like to tell you one thing you
[38:40] people are praying but i don't think you
[38:41] got enough faith because i feel you're
[38:44] discouraged your hearts are being broken
[38:46] and you think there is no hope but let
[38:48] me tell you your prayers are not going
[38:51] away
[38:53] no prayers will not go anywhere right if
[38:56] you want to see that exactly go to
[38:58] revelation chapter 5
[39:00] you can see god pouring out learning you
[39:03] know from the russian right now and he
[39:05] said that's the prayers of the same
[39:07] right brother sister someday your prayer
[39:10] will catch amen we'll catch that person
[39:14] that prayer will help that person that
[39:17] prayer will take hold of that soul one
[39:20] day brother your prayer will not go
[39:23] anywhere amen
[39:25] but the question is are you praying
[39:27] right right come on brother the question
[39:29] is are we praying
[39:31] the bible says pray without ceasing amen
[39:34] the bible says let the men raise their
[39:36] holy hands right and pray amen
[39:39] hallelujah like we need
[39:44] you you don't you don't take this thing
[39:46] as is right if you want to see a revival
[39:49] in this tabernacle rather sister only
[39:52] prayer can bring if you can if you want
[39:54] to see victory in our people's life
[39:57] brother only prayer can bring victory
[39:59] you want to see the move of god in our
[40:02] midst only prayer can do that if you
[40:05] want to see the signs and wonders only
[40:08] pray again but if you want to see the
[40:10] blessings of god only pray again if you
[40:14] want to see the power of god in your
[40:16] life only prayer
[40:26] we can preach what hours
[40:28] we can study for hours days together
[40:30] months together
[40:32] we can do anything we want to
[40:34] but brother sister what we need today is
[40:36] prayer life and the prophet of god said
[40:39] without the holy ghost no man can pray
[40:42] all right amen
[40:44] have you ever thought about this
[40:47] preaching doesn't need the holy ghost
[40:48] you can read five books
[40:50] ten books
[41:04] preaching doesn't need the holy ghost
[41:05] that's right you can have a bunch of
[41:07] papers and your notes like this you can
[41:09] come and if you cannot preach under the
[41:11] inspiration of the anointing you can
[41:13] give a good lecture
[41:30] amen brother sister he preached the
[41:32] first second sermon to mrs eve
[41:37] and see what he did
[41:39] and here you see on the other hand our
[41:40] brother noah preached for 100 years
[41:43] solid 100 years
[41:45] he could hardly win one soul
[41:52] amen
[41:54] just think about it
[41:56] so preaching doesn't need the holy ghost
[41:58] action
[41:59] he came to preach to jesus also and he
[42:02] began to say it is written it is written
[42:04] it is written
[42:05] that's what he told jesus
[42:07] when he was when he found that he was
[42:09] weak he fasted and prayed
[42:12] but brother sister
[42:14] jesus was the word amen and he said
[42:17] satan it is also written right it is
[42:20] also written
[42:21] his body was weak but his faith was
[42:24] strong
[42:28] we may be weak in our bodies we may have
[42:32] different sickness we may have you know
[42:34] disabilities in ourselves we may have
[42:37] you know don't have solid strong
[42:39] capabilities but we may be weak
[42:41] according to the physical situation but
[42:43] let me tell you our faith has got
[42:46] nothing to do with the situation in
[42:48] ourselves
[42:51] our faith must be strong that's right
[42:54] amen
[42:55] hallelujah
[42:56] oh that's wonderful amen you know to
[42:59] keep up this weight
[43:01] lord jesus tells peter he said i have
[43:03] prayed for thee thank god amen that he
[43:06] has prayed
[43:07] that thy faith failed not and when thou
[43:10] converted strengthened thy brethren
[43:12] when you repent of sin right when you
[43:14] are getting ready to be baptized in the
[43:16] name of the lord jesus christ
[43:18] it is just coming near
[43:21] you're just putting few steps
[43:23] you know to be to repent and to you know
[43:27] that's a process actually but the real
[43:29] conversion comes when the holy ghost
[43:32] comes into our lives
[43:34] when we are filled with the holy ghost
[43:36] right glory when our souls are sealed
[43:39] with the holy ghost praise the lord then
[43:41] the conversion comes
[43:43] why could peter lie why could peter do
[43:46] the things he did because he was not
[43:48] converted
[43:50] brother branham says
[43:51] in the message i forgot to write it's a
[43:53] question and answer in 64 he said you
[43:56] are not converted until you receive the
[43:58] holy ghost remember that you are only
[44:01] potentially converted see
[44:04] exactly any person that's not being
[44:06] filled with the holy ghost
[44:08] and claims himself to be a christian
[44:10] because he has repented of his sin yes
[44:12] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[44:14] christ and not being filled with the
[44:16] holy ghost he's potentially saved amen
[44:19] praise
[44:21] but the real conversion comes when he's
[44:24] con when he's filled with the holy ghost
[44:26] and that's the reason church my friends
[44:29] were brothers and sisters we need to be
[44:32] filled with the holy ghost
[44:34] we need to make sure yes sir that we
[44:36] have the holy ghost right
[44:38] right many people talk about just
[44:40] believing yeah just believing believe
[44:43] the message believe the message bring
[44:44] the message
[44:45] if only believing is is okay then we got
[44:49] a good believer right yeah
[44:51] mr dell
[44:52] yeah
[44:53] he believes he's right
[44:57] this is the only god he believes that
[44:59] this is the only true god
[45:01] he believes and he travels
[45:03] now we don't have that much fear
[45:06] sometimes we you know we are relaxed we
[45:08] think that oh are we
[45:09] we are saved we are the bride of jesus
[45:11] christ we are the wife of christ you
[45:13] know we are resting we are
[45:15] all israel
[45:16] and we don't even fear right
[45:19] we don't even fear his about his
[45:21] presence we don't fear when his word has
[45:23] been treated we just relax we just take
[45:25] things for granted you know but that man
[45:27] he he feels and he not only fails but he
[45:29] travels all right
[45:31] the bible says it right right but
[45:33] brother sister just imagine
[45:35] if it is just believing that mr devil
[45:38] will be in the rapture right but that is
[45:40] not so right it's not true right
[45:43] believing is something and being sealed
[45:45] with the holy ghost is something right
[45:47] right right just like brother branham
[45:49] was speaking to a person one day an
[45:51] intellectual ban and he talked about the
[45:53] religion he believed he said what can
[45:55] religion produce he said man i have read
[45:58] about god his love his goodness his
[46:00] power is his mighty words and his
[46:03] righteousness but you know one day i met
[46:05] him
[46:07] that's what the prophet said yeah so one
[46:09] day i met him he said when i met him
[46:11] reading was something else but when i
[46:14] met him it changed me
[46:16] when i met that person that's right
[46:18] about whom it was written
[46:20] it changed my life
[46:22] i'm no more the same person right
[46:24] hallelujah right that's what we need
[46:26] today man
[46:27] we need to meet that person right
[46:30] personally right so that we would be
[46:32] changed amen and then we can strengthen
[46:34] our brothers right amen but praise god
[46:37] peter he was being prayed for
[46:40] and i heard i don't know brother sam
[46:42] dale whether he knows or not i don't
[46:44] know must be he must be annoying but he
[46:46] he's a senior man in the message someone
[46:48] told me he said whenever the prayer uh
[46:51] you know all the call was made brother
[46:54] brennan was the first one to run and and
[46:56] and he started praying
[46:58] he was the first one to run to the altar
[47:00] that's what some
[47:01] a good good
[47:03] you know seasoned minister told me yeah
[47:06] and then i began to think about that
[47:08] brother branham needed prayer yeah
[47:11] how much more i know
[47:12] how much we honor
[47:14] praise allah amen brother sister just
[47:17] just see you know peter with such a
[47:20] great
[47:21] blessings in his life spiritually
[47:24] speaking
[47:25] having the revelation having that great
[47:27] ministry having signs and wonders
[47:28] following him
[47:30] look about the judas
[47:33] they came all excited happy junky so the
[47:36] devils have been you know we have seen
[47:38] devils being cast out and you know oh it
[47:41] is so mighty jesus said don't be happy
[47:44] because your names are written right
[47:46] right
[47:47] praise the lord right that's that's the
[47:49] thing what we need today right but you
[47:51] know to keep up this faith
[47:53] what we have to do first peter chapter
[47:55] five eight and ten eight through ten be
[47:58] sober be vigilant because your adversary
[48:01] the devil has a ruling lion rocket about
[48:04] seeking whom he made
[48:10] we resist that devil
[48:12] with faith
[48:14] steadfast fast in faith knowing that the
[48:17] same affliction are accomplished in your
[48:19] brethren that are in the world but the
[48:21] great god of all grace who hath called
[48:24] us unto his eternal glory by christ
[48:26] jesus after that he has suffered a while
[48:29] make you perfect
[48:30] establish strength
[48:36] the god of all grace right who have
[48:39] called us amen unto his eternal glory by
[48:42] christ jesus that after that he have
[48:45] suffered a little while
[48:48] praise the lord amen make you perfect
[48:51] establish
[48:53] strengthen and settle
[48:56] oh when you go through the suffering
[48:59] that is coming to strengthen us right oh
[49:01] yeah that is coming to establish us
[49:04] to make us perfect
[49:06] and settle us right amen so you know we
[49:10] should have a right attitude right
[49:13] towards the things we are suffering
[49:15] today exactly right
[49:17] and and with the right attitude if we
[49:19] can have and say lord jesus i want you
[49:21] to whip me more all right amen
[49:24] amen
[49:25] thank you for this suffering yes thank
[49:27] you for this disease
[49:29] thank you for the sickness
[49:31] thank you lord for this problem
[49:33] thank you lord for these issues in my
[49:35] life thank you lord for the shock
[49:37] comings thank you lord for the for the
[49:39] circumstances i'm going through
[49:54] you know we have the gold and and you
[49:56] know what does the goldsmith do he takes
[49:58] the gold and he beats
[50:00] he beats the gold and the character or
[50:03] the or the
[50:04] the quality of the gold it doesn't break
[50:07] right right it stretches himself
[50:09] the gold began to you know uh
[50:12] what's the right word brother
[50:14] spread out yeah it doesn't break into
[50:16] pieces the more the smith hits the more
[50:20] it spread and the more it's spelled the
[50:22] grass is going out
[50:24] and as the grass grows out the more
[50:27] shining it becomes he said he will beat
[50:30] the gold until he could see his own face
[50:33] in it and he was he will be able to
[50:35] shave his own face
[50:37] that's what the prophet said amen so if
[50:40] we are believers today our attitude be
[50:42] lord let it come i'm ready amen lord
[50:45] you've ripped me more right right yes
[50:48] lord yeah right come on with me
[50:51] make me perfect right
[50:55] establish me in my life help me to
[50:58] settle down amen give me the steadiness
[51:00] give me the firmness right lord
[51:03] establish my feet
[51:05] that's what david prayed one day he said
[51:08] i was saying i was in a horrible place
[51:10] right and i cried unto the lord and the
[51:12] lord hated me amen brother we cry out
[51:16] when we are in the pit yeah we cry out
[51:19] that is our tendency yeah right
[51:25] when the house is full the kitchen is
[51:27] full all the jars are full we don't need
[51:30] god we don't cry
[51:31] we don't pray
[51:33] because everything what we have at our
[51:35] fingertips
[51:36] everything we have come on bro but
[51:38] brother when the band gets empty
[51:41] let the pockets become empty
[51:44] when the jars in the kitchen room gets
[51:46] empty right that's the
[51:49] lord i will come today
[51:52] i will come to the hills room that's
[51:53] come with my help my come my heart
[51:56] coming from the lord amen that's why
[51:58] sometimes our banks are empty
[52:00] that's why sometimes our jars are empty
[52:17] sometimes the faith fails
[52:20] and that faith is a mental fight
[52:23] we don't want to have that mental faith
[52:26] we don't want to have the faith that
[52:27] comes by money when it is full in the
[52:29] bank
[52:30] because
[52:34] you know
[52:35] there's nothing to withdraw right
[52:37] exactly
[52:38] then we begin to stagger when we begin
[52:40] to feel bad yeah he said oh man what's
[52:42] happening what's happening you don't
[52:44] have a deposit there right
[52:47] but you don't have a deposit right the
[52:49] prophet of god said you've got nothing
[52:51] to to withdraw
[52:53] you'll have the atm debit card
[52:55] international debit card in you i'm not
[52:58] talking about the credit card that's
[53:00] right we are talking about the debit
[53:02] card
[53:03] it may be an international debit card
[53:05] but brother sister if you don't deposit
[53:07] anything you have nothing to withdraw
[53:14] you can go back to the message and see
[53:15] what brother branham says about deposits
[53:17] yes sir he speaks about our prayer life
[53:19] right
[53:20] right yes sir amen
[53:24] that's the reason we need to pray right
[53:27] keep on depositing keep on depositing
[53:29] keep on depositing right every time
[53:31] every time every time you know just keep
[53:34] on depositing put it in the heavens bank
[53:37] put it in the heavens bank keep on
[53:38] depositing and whenever you have me just
[53:41] go to the bank put the aid here press
[53:43] your phone digit number password and
[53:45] your money is in your head right you got
[53:47] 50 you you have 15 years if you're 100
[53:50] they spend 100 in there you need
[53:52] thousands there's thousand in your head
[53:54] why because you got deposits all right
[53:56] right
[53:57] try it amen try it brother right amen
[54:00] many times we don't deposit and we keep
[54:03] on we want to keep on taking drugs how
[54:05] long you can do that my brothers my
[54:07] sister it's just a simple logic here
[54:09] right of course we are not discussing
[54:11] logic here
[54:12] but you know it's a practice of playing
[54:13] truth right if you don't deposit right
[54:16] you got nothing to withdraw
[54:18] exactly amen
[54:20] and here we stand
[54:23] as a fantasy self-righteous pharisee
[54:25] said oh god doesn't listen to me anymore
[54:30] i'm not going to church yeah come on
[54:32] brother i've done what i can
[54:35] we talk like that sometimes is it
[54:37] i don't know about you you find people
[54:40] but i find people in my church
[54:45] i'm talking about my church there
[54:48] oh brother sister
[54:50] god doesn't listen to me yeah
[54:54] come on that's why god said be sober be
[54:56] vigilant right right that's why god said
[54:59] to be straightforward in faith
[55:01] that's why god of all grace calls you
[55:04] right
[55:05] he's trying to tell you he's trying to
[55:06] teach us all right
[55:08] he's trying to let us know
[55:10] that he has called us to his eternal
[55:12] glory amen hallelujah
[55:15] and this suffering comes suffering
[55:17] suffering comes sometimes for the glory
[55:18] of god right sometimes it comes because
[55:21] of our foolishness
[55:23] many year time it comes because of our
[55:25] foolishness
[55:27] that's right amen
[55:29] amen
[55:30] but thank god in all these situations he
[55:34] knows we'll have these ups and downs
[55:36] he knows we will go through these things
[55:38] right he knows and john 17 verse 9 it
[55:41] says i pray for them i pray not for the
[55:44] world
[55:45] he doesn't pray he didn't pray for the
[55:47] worldly people but for them which god
[55:49] has given me for they are dying right
[55:52] and all mine are dying and dying are
[55:54] mine and i'm glorified in them praise
[55:57] god amen hallelujah sometimes we work in
[56:00] the perfect will of god sometimes we
[56:01] don't work in the perfect will of god we
[56:04] work in the permissible of god and the
[56:06] prophet said god will let you do that
[56:09] even though it is a permissive will he
[56:11] will let you do that
[56:12] but out of it
[56:14] the only problem is we will reap what we
[56:17] have sold right right but he will get
[56:19] all the glow
[56:21] right right all right but the thing is
[56:24] we cannot change the law of reproduction
[56:27] if you sow wheat you will request right
[56:32] if you saw rice you will be you'll reap

[1:00:54] right hallelujah he says don't lose that
[1:00:56] faith
[1:00:59] our failure

[1:18:46] i want to show something about jesus in
[1:18:48] the message door of the door in 57
[1:18:50] brother branham speaks there said when
[1:18:52] jesus was on the earth he knew that the
[1:18:54] scriptures pretend to him when he said
[1:18:56] you destroyed his body i will raise it
[1:18:58] up in three days
[1:18:59] he knew the prophet spoke about him
[1:19:01] right david spoke about him moses spoke
[1:19:03] about him and all the prophets in the
[1:19:05] old testament spoke about him and he
[1:19:07] knew the scripture was pretending to him
[1:19:10] and that's the reason he took that word
[1:19:12] and he said you destroy this temple i
[1:19:14] will raise it up in three days
[1:19:16] and he did it because he took that word
[1:19:19] which pretends to him right amen
[1:19:22] right he had faith in the word of god
[1:19:25] brother branham goes further and he says
[1:19:27] if your faith
[1:19:29] will put you in position to know that
[1:19:31] every divine promise
[1:19:34] of god's bible is for you
[1:19:38] just assure that pretend to him right
[1:19:41] every promise pretends to you right
[1:19:44] every promise is ours
[1:19:47] if we can make it personal every promise
[1:19:49] in the book is mine amen
[1:19:52] your healing your salvation your freedom
[1:19:54] from sin your selfishness from your
[1:19:56] indifferences right it says the little
[1:19:58] turtle chill you you pull yourself into
[1:20:00] christ want to come in right right he
[1:20:03] wants to be your lord
[1:20:05] a ruler set you free from all these
[1:20:07] things
[1:20:08] but we won't do it yeah
[1:20:11] but we all do it
[1:20:13] it's to fulfill the scripture that they
[1:20:15] would be lukewarm and
[1:20:30] we don't want to fulfill the word in the
[1:20:33] negative
[1:20:34] perspective yeah
[1:20:35] right
[1:20:38] we don't want to live in that lukewarm
[1:20:39] condition right right we don't want to
[1:20:40] believe in that situation right
[1:20:43] miserable right overall my life is
[1:20:45] measurable you don't have to right
[1:20:48] you can come up right right just by
[1:20:50] putting your faith in action
[1:20:52] and saying lord be my lord right if he
[1:20:55] becomes our lord yes sir
[1:21:00] not saving he's on healer amen
[1:21:02] but for many they don't want him to be
[1:21:04] the life that's right they don't want
[1:21:06] him
[1:21:07] to be their director right right or they
[1:21:09] die yeah and that's the problem he's
[1:21:11] like
[1:21:12] if we can make him our lord
[1:21:15] ruler
[1:21:16] said you'll rule my life lord and the
[1:21:18] whole thing is different right the whole
[1:21:21] thing has changed all right amen

[1:21:36] you know and and
[1:21:38] and let us ask god
[1:21:40] rather brown speaking about an absolute
[1:21:42] he said there are many you know what's
[1:21:44] the matter in the christian faith today
[1:21:46] we've got too many traffic jams right
[1:21:49] right yeah that's right
[1:21:52] he's speaking about traffic death
[1:21:55] now he's speaking about 1963

[1:22:00] traffic jams
[1:22:03] oh my brother
[1:22:04] right
[1:22:05] we got too many too too many yeah
[1:22:08] everybody making their own absolute
[1:22:10] when we have got one absolute and that's
[1:22:12] the word of the living god that settles
[1:22:15] it forever no matter what anyone else
[1:22:16] says
[1:22:17] it's almost gotten to a place like it
[1:22:19] was in the days of judges right said
[1:22:21] everybody has their own absolute but all
[1:22:24] it will all fail right
[1:22:26] in the last thing god's
[1:22:29] absolute is his word right right he
[1:22:32] gives it and heaven and earth will pass
[1:22:34] away but it will never pass your life
[1:22:43] yes right
[1:22:44] this word was brother branham's
[1:22:45] absolutely right this word was paul's
[1:22:48] absolute right this word i was absolute
[1:22:50] to all the disciples of jesus christ now
[1:22:53] the old testament was an absolute to the
[1:22:55] to the old testament prophets they just
[1:22:57] took the word of god and they acted upon
[1:22:59] the word of god right
[1:23:01] and what we have to do today take the
[1:23:02] word of god
[1:23:04] and act upon right right if god did
[1:23:06] there
[1:23:07] in them yeah he will do it in our lives
[1:23:10] you know i missed you
[1:23:11] amen
[1:23:13] oh this is the time they said the word
[1:23:15] and the and the bride is the church is
[1:23:17] getting united
[1:23:19] the word and the people of god are
[1:23:20] becoming one and he said god promised in
[1:23:23] the last days
[1:23:24] god promised in the last days i'm
[1:23:26] talking about the uniting time and sign
[1:23:29] in 63 paragraph 96 according to what i
[1:23:32] have on my printout and god promised in
[1:23:34] the last days that the faith of the
[1:23:36] fathers would be restored back to the
[1:23:38] bride again right that would be this
[1:23:41] this way and it couldn't be no other
[1:23:43] time but this time
[1:23:45] he promised
[1:23:48] they were so
[1:23:50] full
[1:23:50] of faith
[1:23:54] now jesus told them he said you need to
[1:23:56] wait in jerusalem
[1:23:58] until you receive the power
[1:23:59] and we know the bible says they waited
[1:24:01] for 10 days
[1:24:03] how much time can we wait right

[1:50:51] i foreign well we both were reviewed the
[1:50:53] other day our chiropractors they're
[1:50:56] really good bags people
[1:50:58] so
[1:50:59] the secretary came out of the weight
[1:51:01] room she said i want y'all to pray for
[1:51:04] my son and his wife are separating
[1:51:06] whatever and someone said well here's
[1:51:09] the prayer clock said just give it to
[1:51:10] her
[1:51:12] so she said okay which they're baptist i
[1:51:14] don't even know that they know what
[1:51:15] prayer claws like
[1:51:17] well
[1:51:18] she said now to pray for this business
[1:51:20] said we're not doing bad but
[1:51:23] they went up on the rent and all that
[1:51:25] and medicare has cut them down but they
[1:51:27] can't charge so much
[1:51:29] sam said well here's prayer cloth for
[1:51:31] that
[1:51:32] she said okay so i'll put it up
[1:51:35] so she said i'm going to put it over the
[1:51:37] doors she took the tacky pen and put it
[1:51:40] over the door
[1:51:41] so that was two weeks ago so we went
[1:51:43] friday and she was demolished
[1:51:54] she said we have had more patience than
[1:51:57] a two-week period than we have in 10
[1:52:00] years
[1:52:15] and she said
[1:52:17] do you realize having paid me patience
[1:52:20] we've had this two weeks
[1:52:23] and said you know why he said well god
[1:52:26] knows we've got
[1:52:27] bills to pay she said no that's her club
[1:52:33] amen so when we both went in and he
[1:52:36] thanked us for the problem
[1:52:38] you know they believe in franklin but i
[1:52:40] i got reviewed because a baptist could
[1:52:43] leave that prayer cloth and bring
[1:52:45] uh more money into the business
[1:52:48] and you know we can't even believe for
[1:52:50] anything we are believers they're just
[1:52:52] bad right
[1:52:54] i hope everybody can hear that good
[1:52:56] enough
[1:52:59] chiropractor he said thank you for the
[1:53:01] prayer cloth
[1:53:03] thank you for bringing it into it i
[1:53:05] really get to talk to him a lot about
[1:53:07] the lord a lot of things so
[1:53:09] just pray for him we want
[1:53:12] you know and everything and actually
[1:53:13] they're the family matters that they
[1:53:15] were asking for us to pray about it was
[1:53:17] beginning to change absolutely and we
[1:53:19] told them to just keep believing it amen
[1:53:21] well i believe it
[1:53:23] don't believe it don't you
[1:53:25] i believe he's regal

[1:54:04] don't don't wait until the last moment
[1:54:07] and just say well you know we we've
[1:54:09] decided to go because that puts a strain
[1:54:12] on the people that have made
[1:54:13] arrangements and things getting
[1:54:15] everything ready you know
[1:54:16] and all because it's 200 miles and you
[1:54:19] have to make arrangements and get
[1:54:20] everything but we really have a good
[1:54:23] time some people don't agree with
[1:54:24] fellowship meetings but you know they
[1:54:26] fellowship with a lot of people
[1:54:30] themselves
[1:54:32] that i probably wouldn't fellowship with
[1:54:36] but then they're against us for
[1:54:38] fellowship meetings
[1:54:39] you know and they're going to be with
[1:54:41] people we've been doing for 20 something
[1:54:43] years
