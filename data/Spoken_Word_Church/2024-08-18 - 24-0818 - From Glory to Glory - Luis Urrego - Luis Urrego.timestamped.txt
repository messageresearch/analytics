[1:44] say greetings to all our visitors God
[1:46] bless you and appreciate you being here
[1:49] with us all right I want to talk about
[1:50] this morning about from glory to glory
[1:52] and
[1:54] um uh we'll just read here in Exodus um
[1:59] here's the there's a problem we got ads
[2:03] all right and and it's
[2:07] uh you know what I'm just going to zoom
[2:09] in
[2:11] here I can can you zoom in
[2:15] here I guess not all right Exodus 34:
[2:19] 27-29 and the Lord said unto
[2:22] Moses write down uh write these words
[2:27] for after the tenor of these words I
[2:28] have made a covenant with with thee and
[2:30] with Israel and he was there with the
[2:32] Lord 40 days and 40 nights and he did
[2:36] neither eat bread nor drink water and he
[2:39] wrote upon the tables of the words uh of
[2:42] the Covenant The Ten
[2:48] Commandments and it came to pass when
[2:50] Moses came down from Mount Si with the
[2:53] two tables of testimony in moses' hand
[2:56] when he came down from the mount that
[2:58] Moses wi not that the the skin of his
[3:01] face Shone while he talked with him so
[3:04] this is what I want to uh I want to
[3:06] concentrate on that Moses's um as Moses
[3:11] was in the in the in the mountain of
[3:13] with with the Lord receiving the word of
[3:16] God or the Commandments the glory was so
[3:19] strong that Moses came down with his
[3:22] face shining before the uh and and he
[3:26] did not know that his face was shining
[3:28] that's how much uh he was in the
[3:30] presence of God and and so we could say
[3:34] that he was in The Presence of Jehovah
[3:36] right amen Mo and there's a there's an
[3:39] image right there of of Moses uh face
[3:42] coming down and that is that is like
[3:46] like you and I Saints you know when we
[3:48] are in The Presence of Jehovah when we
[3:50] are truly receiving from the word of God
[3:53] Amen the world may not have known what
[3:55] has happened to us they just see what's
[3:57] happening on the outside amen that we
[3:59] have had an experience with God and that
[4:02] God God is working in in our in our
[4:05] lives amen and so this was what was
[4:08] happening with Moses as Moses was
[4:10] receiving the word not for just for
[4:13] himself but for the people amen and he
[4:16] was he was man God's chosen man for for
[4:19] that hour and um in verse 30 it says and
[4:22] when Aaron and all the children of
[4:24] Israel saw Moses behold the skin of his
[4:27] face Shone and and they were afraid to
[4:31] come nigh to him amen and we know that
[4:34] the world Amen they're they're only
[4:35] comfortable with their own they're not
[4:38] comfortable that's why they're they get
[4:40] uncomfortable around you and and I
[4:42] because we have a a a a different a
[4:45] different perspective of of things we
[4:47] have we we live differently we we are a
[4:49] condemnation into their lives amen uh if
[4:52] a worldly person likes to be around you
[4:55] uh then you must be acting probably like
[4:58] them uh that's how the only way that
[5:00] they feel comfortable around you is that
[5:03] you partake of the things that they do
[5:06] or that you speak the speech that they
[5:08] that they give but Moses when he came
[5:10] down from the mountain you could tell
[5:12] that he had been with God Amen and the
[5:14] people amen knew that that there was
[5:16] something different about Moses
[5:18] something something was was was
[5:20] different and in so much and that he had
[5:23] to uh he had to Veil his
[5:26] face because the glory was so strong
[5:29] upon on his face that he had to Veil his
[5:31] face in 2 Corinthians it tells us that
[5:34] the light uh um in 2 Corinthians 4:3 it
[5:38] says but if our gospel be hid it is hid
[5:41] to them that are lost in whom the God of
[5:44] this world hath blinded the minds of
[5:46] them which believe not lest the light of
[5:49] the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the
[5:52] image of God should shine unto them
[5:56] amen what of the time amen I remember
[5:58] when I when I became became a a
[6:00] Christian and when I was truly wanting
[6:03] to serve the Lord back when I was in
[6:05] high school just finished 12th grade and
[6:08] I said you know what this life that that
[6:10] I'm living I just want to give it up and
[6:13] I got to Ser I want to serve the Lord
[6:15] you know and I just felt that whole tug
[6:17] all throughout high school but I never I
[6:19] never wanted to listen to it just
[6:20] because I wanted to hang out with the
[6:22] with the popular crowd and do what they
[6:24] wanted wanted to do and finally I I said
[6:28] Lord I I can't live this way anymore and
[6:30] I've I've told the the the the the
[6:32] testimony here uh when you are truly
[6:35] living for God Amen you don't have to
[6:38] leave your friends your friends will
[6:39] automatically leave you your so-called
[6:41] friends you know they will automatically
[6:45] uh uh uh take different routes because
[6:47] why they they can't stand to be around
[6:49] where where where where where the word
[6:52] is working amen and so the children of
[6:54] Israel amen where the word was working
[6:57] with Moses they couldn't they couldn't
[6:58] take it they it was too strong they had
[7:01] not been in that presence like Moses had
[7:04] amen and I believe that Moses in this in
[7:06] in this scripture is almost like the
[7:08] type of the believer in in in this our
[7:10] day amen a Believer with Revelation is
[7:14] too strong and is too rich for the world
[7:17] they can't handle it they can't accept
[7:19] it it's it's just too strong and and
[7:22] sometimes when you even talk to nominal
[7:24] people and and you bring forth certain
[7:26] things that we believe in this message
[7:28] amen it's it's in the word right we
[7:31] don't believe the message unless it was
[7:33] in the word but even when you bring it
[7:35] out to them in certain angles they've
[7:37] never seen it that way or they can't
[7:39] accept it that way because it's just too
[7:41] rich for them not that they hate God and
[7:44] not that they hate uh uh uh the the word
[7:48] amen but but that it's too rich for them
[7:50] in other words it's too bright for them
[7:52] amen and that's the work that God has
[7:54] done in in in in you and in our lives
[7:57] amen and we appreciate that
[8:00] and Moses called unto them and Aaron and
[8:03] all the rulers of the congregation
[8:05] returned unto him and Moses talked with
[8:07] them and afterward all the children of
[8:09] Israel came nigh and he gave them
[8:12] Commandments I guess I should be
[8:13] scrolling this too and he gave them
[8:16] commandment in commandment all that the
[8:18] Lord had spoken with him in Mount
[8:20] Si until
[8:23] Moses until Moses had done speaking with
[8:26] them he put a veil on his face so he had
[8:29] that Veil on his face while he was
[8:32] speaking to the children of Israel
[8:34] giving them the word that he had
[8:36] received from but when he would leave
[8:38] their presence and get back in the
[8:39] presence of God that Veil would come
[8:41] right off Amen in other words it was
[8:44] face to face with God Amen it was it was
[8:47] it was a it was a an experience with God
[8:50] nothing to
[8:51] hide nothing to hide you can't hide
[8:53] anything when you're in the presence of
[8:55] God that's right amen when you're truly
[8:57] in the presence of God Amen there's
[8:58] nothing that hi God God God knows your
[9:01] heart God God knows exactly what's going
[9:04] on in your life praise the Lord amen
[9:07] amen now brother brandham says here in
[9:10] the message the unveiling of God he he
[9:12] says something PEC here he says that
[9:14] Moses became the word Moses had the word
[9:17] now remember after the word was made
[9:18] manifest Moses was Moses again see but
[9:22] while that word was in him to be give
[9:24] out he was God and the Bible says said
[9:27] that that he would be God to uh to Aaron
[9:30] and Aaron would be uh see yeah he would
[9:34] be God to Aaron and Aaron would be the
[9:35] prophet to to to the people for he
[9:38] wasn't Moses no more he had the word of
[9:40] the Lord for that age nothing could
[9:43] touch him till that was over had that
[9:45] word with him so therefore when he come
[9:47] the people turned their heads they
[9:49] couldn't understand he had been changed
[9:52] he was a different fellow he come with
[9:54] that word and he put a veil the Bible
[9:57] said over his face for he had the word
[9:59] word and he was the word to them amen so
[10:03] that is what we are to the to the people
[10:06] we are the word amen we are the word of
[10:09] God whom the word of the Lord has come
[10:11] to you are the word you're the living
[10:13] walking breathing word in this hour it's
[10:16] the only Jesus that that this world is
[10:18] going to see amen is you and I amen if
[10:22] Christ is is is really in us but when
[10:25] Moses went in before the Lord to speak
[10:27] with him he took the the veil off until
[10:30] he came out and he came out and spake
[10:33] unto the children of Israel that which
[10:36] he was commanded now in that presence of
[10:39] the Lord amen Moses could be free praise
[10:42] God he was a free man you know and and
[10:45] and we think about um amen the the the
[10:49] high priest amen when he would go behind
[10:50] the veil Amen in the holy of holies
[10:54] praise God he could be free in there
[10:56] amen there was there was no condemnation
[10:59] if he had done everything exactly
[11:02] according to the word of God there is no
[11:04] condemnation to those that are in Christ
[11:07] Jesus amen that's why when condemnation
[11:11] strikes your life and you're wondering
[11:13] well why am I receiving this
[11:14] condemnation why am I being condemned
[11:16] why do I feel condemned when I have not
[11:19] done anything I do not need to make
[11:21] anything right with anybody amen you can
[11:24] bet amen that's nothing but Satan trying
[11:27] to hinder your life trying to stop you
[11:29] from continuing your walk with God Amen
[11:32] but when you are in that presence of God
[11:34] Amen when you are behind the veil amen
[11:37] of that holy of holies Mo uh the the
[11:40] high priest Aaron amen he could partake
[11:42] freely partake of the Mana that was in
[11:44] there of the word amen he could go back
[11:48] and look at the tablets the word amen
[11:51] word on top of word amen and could see
[11:54] Miracles even in that presence because
[11:57] Aaron's broad was in there a dry old
[11:59] stick amen was budding in that presence
[12:02] amen and that stick was not even
[12:05] attached to a tree yet it was budding
[12:07] and giving off
[12:08] almonds but as I always said he it was
[12:11] attached to a tree cuz the tree of life
[12:13] was back in there amen so so so so he
[12:17] was free to partake of anything amen we
[12:19] are free amen if the word of God is in
[12:22] us we are free to partake of any of the
[12:25] blessings any of the promises of God the
[12:28] problem is is that some sometimes we are
[12:29] afraid because we have that Tunis
[12:32] mentality God is up there and I'm down
[12:35] here and it's not that way we are in him
[12:39] and him in US amen we are one unit the
[12:42] bride amen and the bridegroom are one
[12:44] unit amen we are heirs and Joint heirs
[12:47] and the joint air gets exactly what the
[12:50] what the heir gets praise God right amen
[12:52] my wife gets exactly what what what I
[12:55] get because we are married amen nothing
[12:58] the the the dining room table is not is
[13:01] not mine and and and she gets just
[13:03] something else amen and everything in in
[13:06] the house is is mine and and hers amen
[13:09] and she could partake freely of
[13:11] everything in that home amen and that's
[13:13] what God wants us to do right but but
[13:16] but but you know we have to we have to
[13:19] keep in mind that that that God wants us
[13:21] to think of him that way not him up
[13:25] there and us down here we're like like
[13:28] as if we're separate units like like the
[13:31] way most American couples live today
[13:36] supposed to be
[13:37] married your finances over there my
[13:39] finances here this over here this over
[13:42] here no it's supposed to be joined amen
[13:45] it's supposed to be all together right
[13:48] right there's no unity in that there's
[13:50] just opportunities to hide things from
[13:53] one another is what that
[13:55] is amen so second Corinthians 3:16 tells
[14:00] us um nevertheless when it shall turn to
[14:03] the Lord the veil shall be taken away
[14:05] now the Lord is that spirit and where
[14:06] the spirit of the Lord is there
[14:09] is Liberty amen I'm sorry I I you can't
[14:14] see that I thought that maybe we could
[14:16] zoom this in
[14:18] but all right so when you are sealed in
[14:21] Christ and Christ is sealed in you there
[14:23] is Liberty amen praise the Lord Jesus
[14:26] and the children
[14:30] and the children of Israel saw the face
[14:32] of Moses that the skin of Moses face
[14:34] Shone and Moses put the veil upon his
[14:37] face again until he went in to speak
[14:40] with him amen the glory on moses' face
[14:42] would wear off whenever he was not in
[14:45] the presence of God Amen that Mo that
[14:48] that glory amen that that that that
[14:51] Glory that he would receive he'd come
[14:53] down he'd come down shining because he
[14:55] had just been in the presence but
[14:57] eventually That Glory would fade we
[14:59] would fade off and he'd have to go back
[15:01] and speak to God for in order for that
[15:04] glory amen to come back amen and and in
[15:07] 2 Corinthians 3:7 which we're about to
[15:09] read here in just a moment that it says
[15:11] which Glory was to be done away amen
[15:14] which Glory was to be done away now we
[15:17] can look here real quickly in Mount at
[15:20] Mount Transfiguration Jesus came and
[15:23] invited James John and uh uh Peter there
[15:28] at the at the mount
[15:29] and um they all it's interesting that
[15:32] they all have part of the word amen they
[15:35] have books written in the Bible uh uh
[15:39] uh in the word amen so that's kind of
[15:42] interesting but here comes Jesus doing
[15:45] the same thing that Moses was was was
[15:48] doing but with Moses it was just the
[15:51] face amen with Jesus it was the whole
[15:55] his whole his whole Glory face and and
[15:58] the rest of his body amen and and so
[16:01] showing us amen that here comes a new
[16:03] ministration amen this new ministration
[16:06] coming in which you are part of that
[16:08] body amen you and I were in him amen you
[16:12] and I are the body of Christ amen praise
[16:16] the Lord he is the head so not just his
[16:19] head shining now because as we read here
[16:21] he says and after six days Jesus taketh
[16:24] Peter James and John his brother and
[16:26] bringeth them up in into an high
[16:28] mountain ofart and was transfigured
[16:30] before them and his face did shine as
[16:33] the sun and his reignment was white as
[16:37] the light that's that's some that's some
[16:40] bright bright lights amen when you're
[16:43] shining as bright as the sun and uh so
[16:47] here's here's this image of of of Moses
[16:50] and Elijah right there with Jesus and
[16:52] Peter and James and John right there
[16:54] afraid not ex not want not you know what
[16:58] what would you do if you were in that
[17:00] situation amen praise God and behold
[17:03] there appeared unto them Moses and Elias
[17:05] talking with him then answered Peter and
[17:06] said unto Jesus Lord is good for us to
[17:08] be let's skip down to verse 5 while he
[17:11] yet spake Behold a bright Cloud
[17:12] overshadow D and behold a voice out of
[17:14] the cloud which said this is my beloved
[17:17] Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye
[17:20] him amen so now the administration goes
[17:23] from the law amen it comes to Jesus
[17:26] Christ amen who is the full word amen
[17:28] man in this hour who is the the who is
[17:32] Grace praise the Lord you realize that
[17:35] God from the beginning is what he wanted
[17:37] to display was Grace to the people of
[17:39] God to the children of Israel but
[17:42] because they wanted law he gave them
[17:45] what they what what they wanted and and
[17:47] God Amen he is whatever you want amen
[17:50] that's what he'll give
[17:52] you he's he's he's a gentleman and he's
[17:55] not going to force you Amen to live
[17:57] closer to God have your walk closer to
[18:00] him or or or or or or not amen it it's
[18:03] your choice if you want to grow in Him
[18:05] Praise the Lord amen I believe a true
[18:08] Christian does want to grow in Christ
[18:11] amen I believe a Christian does want to
[18:13] grow in the stature of a perfect man and
[18:15] not not not be stale and not wondering
[18:18] what's going on Amen not not thinking
[18:21] well cuz I go to to a message church
[18:23] that that that's all I need no you you
[18:25] you will find a way amen how can I grow
[18:28] in the Statue of a perfect man amen and
[18:31] part of growing in the Statue of a
[18:33] perfect man is through trials and
[18:35] tribulations I wholeheartedly believe
[18:37] that that's part of the Christian
[18:38] Journey you must suffer as I said last
[18:41] time amen So when you say you're a
[18:43] Christian amen you just get ready to
[18:46] suffer suffer suffer away because that's
[18:49] what's going to mold your character
[18:50] that's what's going to mold you into
[18:52] this into this image as the word as
[18:55] you're feeding and eating the word amen
[18:57] you're also suffering uing amen for him
[19:00] praise the Lord Jesus because the more
[19:02] is given to you the more you're
[19:04] responsible for you remember that think
[19:07] about that the more word and the more
[19:10] Revelation that is given to you the more
[19:11] is going to be asked of
[19:13] you so the more challenge will and more
[19:17] trials will come to you as you're
[19:19] feeding it's not about just let me get
[19:21] all this head knowledge and me not
[19:23] suffer anything in life no doesn't work
[19:26] that way Amen Let Me obtain this
[19:28] knowledge amen that I may apply it in my
[19:31] life and Lord I will suffer for you in
[19:33] order to see that knowledge that I have
[19:36] obtained that word that I have obtained
[19:38] to display now I can display patience
[19:41] when patience is needed now I can I can
[19:44] display amen mercy and Grace to someone
[19:48] when mercy and Grace is needed amen
[19:50] because it's in you and it was molded in
[19:53] you praise God Amen so just as Moses was
[19:58] the man man of the hour for his
[20:02] day um Jesus was the man of the hour not
[20:05] just them but for all of the ages to
[20:07] come through his people amen praise God
[20:12] and I like what that after the the
[20:13] disciples amen when they when Jesus went
[20:15] away amen they didn't see any other man
[20:17] there but only Jesus amen there at the
[20:20] mount Transfiguration praise God now in
[20:24] 2 Corinthians and uh you go back and
[20:27] read 2 Corinthians chap 3 we're not
[20:29] going to have time to read it uh but
[20:31] read 2 Corinthians chapter 3 because
[20:34] Paul in that chapter talks about exactly
[20:38] what had happened there in on Mount on
[20:41] the mountain with Moses and his face
[20:43] shineing and and he and he and he brings
[20:46] it down to the point of that you and I
[20:50] are now that word is not in two tablets
[20:52] anymore but now that word is written in
[20:55] the tablets of our heart praise God and
[20:58] that we are now written Epistles read of
[21:01] all men praise God so what is what is
[21:04] what is what what is the world reading
[21:06] what are the people reading they're
[21:07] reading your life amen they're not they
[21:10] don't have to read tablets of stone
[21:12] anymore just as Moses had to come down
[21:15] praise God but now they are reading your
[21:17] life amen and and as I said you know the
[21:21] people who don't understand just like
[21:23] the children of Israel they didn't
[21:25] understand what Moses had been through
[21:27] amen so because Moses became the word to
[21:30] them as he as he came down to them to
[21:32] give them the word still to this day the
[21:35] true Jews amen because there are those
[21:38] fake Jews out there but they true Jews
[21:41] amen who really amen are seeking God
[21:44] Amen that they don't understand this
[21:47] word that Veil Paul talks about that
[21:49] Veil still over their face right amen
[21:53] because why they are veiled to the word
[21:56] and what was Moses to them when he came
[21:58] down from the mountain as brother Brown
[21:59] said he was the word to them so that
[22:01] word is still veiled to them praise God
[22:05] and so and so Paul Paul talks about that
[22:08] that if the ministration of death
[22:09] written and engraven in Stones was
[22:11] glorious in other words if that was
[22:14] glorious and that had Glory attached to
[22:16] it bright lights and everything how much
[22:19] more the ministration of life amen
[22:21] praise God the ministration of Grace in
[22:24] this hour amen how shall the
[22:26] ministration of the spirit be rather
[22:28] glorious as Paul says it's even more
[22:31] glorious amen the grace that you and I
[22:34] can partake of in this hour for if the
[22:36] ministration of condemnation because
[22:39] that's what the law did it would just
[22:40] condemn you it would send you to jail
[22:43] hey if you didn't do exactly amen then
[22:45] there was punishment amen and it's the
[22:48] same today amen but there's Grace
[22:51] attached to it praise God there is a
[22:54] there is Grace amen that only Jesus
[22:56] could provide amen when he came on on
[22:58] the scene it says for if the
[23:00] ministration of condemnation be glory
[23:02] much more do the ministration of
[23:04] righteousness exceed in glory praise
[23:08] God and U for even that which was made
[23:11] glorious had no glory in this Respect by
[23:13] reason of the glory that excelth the the
[23:15] New Living Translation says it this way
[23:16] in fact that first Glory was not
[23:19] glorious at all compared with the
[23:20] overwhelming glory of the new way for if
[23:24] that which is done away was glorious
[23:26] much more that which remaineth is
[23:27] glorious seeing then that we have such
[23:30] hope we use great plainness of speech in
[23:34] New Living test translation says since
[23:35] this new way gives us such confidence we
[23:38] can be very
[23:39] bold amen we can be very gold so bold so
[23:43] so because
[23:45] amen what Jesus Christ amen he's fully
[23:48] shining now amen shining in a group of
[23:51] people amen call the bride in this hour
[23:54] praise God that tra that that that Glory
[23:56] has been transferred over now I'm I'm
[23:58] just going quickly I uh trying to finish
[24:01] up here and and he says here uh that's
[24:05] why I encourage you to read the whole
[24:06] chapter uh it's only 18 verses so I
[24:10] think you can do that but we we we all
[24:13] with open face beholding as in a glass
[24:15] the glory of the Lord are CH are changed
[24:17] into the same image from glory to glory
[24:20] even as by the spirit of the Lord and in
[24:23] the New Living Translation says it like
[24:25] this so all of us who have had the that
[24:28] Veil removed can see and reflect the
[24:31] glory of the
[24:32] Lord amen when was Moses uh face shining
[24:36] when he'd go up back in the mountain
[24:38] Amen to talk to God and receive the word
[24:41] he'd remove the veil right yes therefore
[24:43] he could receive that glory amen we have
[24:48] a veil that's been removed the veil of
[24:49] the world the veil of of of not
[24:52] understanding the word amen that has
[24:54] been removed amen and so we have the
[24:56] opportunity in this hour to sh the glory
[24:59] of the of the word amen and to the
[25:02] people and the Lord who is the spirit
[25:04] makes us more and more like him as we
[25:07] are changed into his glorious image
[25:10] praise the Lord amen now real quick
[25:15] Jesus wanted to share that Glory with us
[25:18] amen and and and in John 17 he prays and
[25:21] he says uh that all that may be one as
[25:24] thou father are in me and I in thee that
[25:26] they also may be one in US that the
[25:29] world may believe that thou has sent me
[25:31] amen and the glory which thou gavest me
[25:34] I have given them amen that they may be
[25:38] one even as we are one praise the Lord
[25:43] that's what God wants Amen to share his
[25:46] glory with us that's why Paul was saying
[25:49] that this this this this uh this change
[25:53] amen is changing us from Glory back to
[25:57] Glory
[25:58] from the original Glory back to that
[26:00] original glory and it's just like the
[26:02] seed amen the word of God who what who
[26:05] is the seed which is the seed amen this
[26:08] seed when it comes in us it's glorious
[26:11] it's got to go back to the seed praise
[26:13] God so it's changing us from glory to
[26:16] glory amen amen and you can read you can
[26:20] read this here and now this glory is
[26:22] changing
[26:23] now because we're part of him amen the
[26:27] Bride of Jesus Christ she gets the exact
[26:30] same Glory that he got amen and that
[26:33] Moses got amen That Glory is is in the
[26:37] bride of Christ amen and she's made up
[26:40] of millions of people amen praise the
[26:44] Lord throughout all the ages now I'll
[26:45] finish with this the Mighty God unveiled
[26:47] before us the seed come backs to its
[26:50] original Glory look the old Badger skins
[26:53] we find out behind it was inside of
[26:56] there was the word a amen praise God in
[26:59] the Tabernacle amen of Moses the word
[27:02] was in that Tabernacle praise God there
[27:04] also was the showbread it's interesting
[27:06] brother Brandon was talking about these
[27:08] things in the message that that the that
[27:10] they were playing just right before we
[27:12] started the ark was sprinkled and what
[27:15] was it the shika Glory was in there amen
[27:18] now the word is a seed and it cannot
[27:20] bring forth until the sun strikes it the
[27:24] sun's got to be upon the seed to make it
[27:26] be to make it come forth amen and that's
[27:30] the only way you take the word take the
[27:33] word of God in your heart and walk into
[27:35] the shakana glory and when you do it'll
[27:39] bring showbread Mana that that's only
[27:42] give for a separated people amen this
[27:46] word is going to separate you amen the
[27:49] only thing that can eat it that's
[27:51] permitted to eat it is just the people
[27:53] who are permitted and notice Paul said
[27:55] here changing from glory to glory you
[27:58] see finally it comes to its back to its
[28:01] original Glory it's just like a seed of
[28:03] a morning glory praise the Lord
