Romans 8 28. and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are thee called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called then he also justified in whom he justified them he and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things what could be said to all of that if God be for us who can be against us amen let's go over to Revelations 3 and verse 14. and at the angel of the Church of the lady of sin that's this age this is the last age this is the number seven anybody order no because the lady of SIA means people's rights so you ought to know that but however things going around the world today you know of everybody and what they're doing but it said unto the angel of the Church of the lady of sins right these things say at the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God you may be seated the Lord have his and his Blessing to the word now we've been studying for quite a while on the thought of how does God predestinate and we've seen that he predestinates by foreknowledge he desired that everybody be saved but we know everybody won't be saved and when he could say you know Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated even before they were ever born it's got to be dependent upon some reason for saying it that away and we know that God then can look down through time and see everything and that way he could set a destiny and and that Destiny would be a time on Earth remember what foreknowledge is foreknowledge is knowledge before of an event to transpire amen you know some were basically what we would call on Earth all right then predestination is not a bad word because it's not like we were taught back in the ages and the times of of the calvinistics and then over into the Presbyterians and into the Baptist Churches as they were bringing it out of of a predetermined Factor and they'd put it down there and they'd say well and you they'd say even in the the old primitive Baptists would say that there's no need of having a Revival he said because maybe somebody might get saved that God didn't want to get saved now that's that's no joke that was a Doctrine and that's why they didn't like the missionary baptist when they came on in to that form because you know there was no need of having missionary work if God was going to save him anyway but we found out that that's not true it's by foreknowledge of what you and I desire amen if we desire to be saved then God Will Make A Way for us to be saved correct so then it's based on foreknowledge of what we desire amen amen all right then that way Jacob we know would be the way he would be but Esau would be the way he would be and God could look down and see what they would do in life and if he's not that kind of a god what kind of a god do we serve you know that's right I mean he got a peanut brain like we've got that we can change our mind every two seconds you know now his first decision is perfect and he can never change his mind right he's not like you and I to where he could just say well I thought I was right yesterday over today I'm Different you know no what kind of a god do we serve if he's not that kind of a God I don't care anything about serving him because he's just like I am you know he just messed up his message I messed up if that's all he can do but if he could sit back and be an infinite the word infinite come into the basis of being the word that he could sit back and see all things before they would take place and you know then that way he could write it down he could make the The Book of Life before the foundation of the world learns Revelations 13 8 I think it is he could do all those things back there because he was infinite all right see then we saw that and I told you I don't want to be a part of just the thoughts of God because he thought of everybody he thought of Judas his Garrett just as much as he'd think of you and I Amen in his thoughts because that way he would see you know what would transpire coming down through time all right then I've tried my best to tell you for about 40 years now I want to be a part of the Thinker himself I want the the life of God to be dwelling in me amen amen and I believe we must receive that as what we call the new birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost that came on a day of Pentecost into the church and I believe it comes into every believer as the new birth to bring us eternal life all right then in bringing that eternal life which is God's own life there's not no two or three forms of eternal life there's only one form and that's the word Zoe which means God's own life all right and see that way that's why we don't believe hell to be eternal right because it had a beginning the Bible says it'll have an end one day death and hell will be cast into the Lake of Fire to be destroyed so it doesn't have a beginning I mean it had a beginning so it cannot be eternal anything that has a beginning as we use the terminologies of beginning it means it started somewhere all right and as it's doing it then see you would have to have God's own life if you lived eternally in hell God's life's not going to be in hell he just went there for you and I but he came back out right there was no way hell could keep him remember he descended to the spirits in prison they were disobedient in the long suffering of days of Noah he preached to them he came back up picked up the Old Testament Saints all right see then believing it that away we could look at it and see that God could look down and see he knew exactly who would be at church tonight but he knew who wouldn't be here tonight and see because he knew that before the world he said well then then it's all set so I can't change all set on what why don't you quit breathing all right I just grab your nose in your mouth just quit breathing because of it all presets you're going to live anyway right no we ain't gonna do that right We're Not Gonna We're not gonna stop breathing we're going to keep on breathing well like that's the way it is in God see he's given us the opportunity to serve him here as Christians in our lives to where the others can see Christ in US and seeing through the revealed word to find out what we believe and what we're doing all right so then it would be put on the basis of what you and I desire if we desire it God will have it for us he's a wonderful God I love it when the prophet of God said one day he said in all the dirty things Israel done said the great Jehovah God came down and went right along with them you know ten times the Bible says they sinned from the coming out of of Egypt over to Katie's barnia and each time sure he would punish him for it but to bulk part of the Israelites was on their way to the promised land and because he was still going to keep his word he told him he'd take him in he did all right because I that's why I love him so much because he'll keep his word all right now we've got up to a point to where that we were talking about uh there in the scripture where it says the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy and we could see that that was in God's mind before the foundation of the world all right now being in his mind means a wonderful thing unless in his mind he's seen us doing wrong and remember his mind is is not like you and I it's an amazing thing now that they can actually tap into your telephone line you know and they can actually hear conversations you made a month ago you explain that how can that be but they can do it I know and see then knowing that away then we we know that those are just man's ways of doing things the Bible says nothing is withholden from man the imagination of man's mind is continually evil and look what he's doing you know you can't trust nobody no more right there's just no way why because it's just it's this mankind falling apart every country is trying their best to survive and and we're doing the big buddy thing trying to help all of them survive and what are we doing just losing a lot of people to do all of those things but yet still we want freedom don't we and freedom is a cost but now think about the last few comments we made I said where it says the morning Stars saying together morning stars are the Angels or cherubims and the sons of God shouted for joy then you know that would have to be somewhere down through time just like it says as we're quoting there a moment ago Revelation 13 8 said these students are lamb slain before the foundation of the world all right you know what that meant if God saw that in his mind it meant that Jesus Christ would have to die on a cross there was no way to bypass it was no way to stop it why because God already saw it he said well if mankind had just believed him well he done so they wouldn't believe him there's any problem with that if he's infinite all right we'll see then it would have to be a point somewhere you and I would be shouting in our Salvation that was the point of trying to get across to you that we ought to be the most shoutness people that there is in the world and shouting people to me doesn't mean you have to be running owls and screaming and hollering shouting to me as a is a joy within your heart happiness about right the Salvation you have been given and then to know of what he's done for you and me he paid the price but you and I could be saved all right now and then we come on over into the last message and we were talking about that God knew that we were going to fall by his infinite wisdom and then he knew by us falling that he would have to come into being and dwell upon Earth and through the body of Jesus Christ almighty God himself stepped down in that body and lived upon Earth amen amen he told the Fire season thing he said unless you believe that I am he you'll die in your sins you know what they didn't believe him you know what they died in their sins but he told him he said if you've seen me you've seen the father but they couldn't accept that why because remember what we had in the that we've dealt with a few times the ego of mankind won't allow mankind to believe what another person says right that's right hardest thing in the world to get one person believe another one right I mean it used to be if we come up with a deal in the old days you know we just shake hands that was it you can't do that today the best thing to do if you're going into business is I don't care if your brothers or sisters or husband and wife the best thing to do is get a contract and sign the thing because at least you got something to deal with might not be worth a whole lot but it's that's what we've come to we used to we didn't lock our doors all we had I remember was just a string to pull and the little latch went up and he went on out he wanted to come in you just pulled a string most of the time the door is left open because it didn't make no difference in on a window no screens on the windows it didn't matter where you close the doors or not but you see we're living in a different time so nowadays you have to put things in a different way but see God is the same if he saved one man by the blood he has to save Everybody by the blood he doesn't make a way to say you and I just because how smart we are it's through the blood of Jesus Christ so that meant God had to come down himself and dwell in human flesh the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness whether godhead bodily all right he was almighty God dwelling on the Earth are the biggest fate that's ever been amen amen see and that's what we believe we believe that part because our dependence is upon him and what he says all right see then think about it what was the last thoughts we had when you think about a creation and creator remember God didn't create eggs and let them hatch the old argument which come first the chicken or the egg that's stupidity he said well he could have laid the eggs out there well why do that when he could create a chicken he only got one egg you got a chicken you had a whole lot of eggs right Lobby Grace has got two little ducks and they found out one of them was a male and one of them's a female well they thought they were going to have them about 10 or 12 because they asked me how many eggs did it take for a set and I said well it's somewhere around 12 13. you know maybe a little more very that okay I've done late about 20 something eggs and ain't none of them hatched yet well if you had all that that still wouldn't be worth nothing but why not have that good old hen there you know so when God creates anything he doesn't create it in a baby form when he created the world it was perfect when he created the animals it was perfect it created the moon the stars the thing everything was perfect and in order still running today just like it was set your clock on it I can go back and tell you exactly where this world was setting a thousand years ago you know in what rotation where exactly of a time of day one because it's running so perfect but he could do all of that and then we think that he couldn't know all about our doings in our life right but yet we've got to get it down to evasive of believing it within the life we were talking about how God created his first creation is full grown amen amen all right now I know he was born as a baby come into life come through but you know what he came to full grown so it has to be a full grown thing that's why we read during the in Genesis I mean in Revelation where it says he's the beginning of the creation of God now that word creation there is not the same word or the beginning words you'd say in the beginning that's not the same word to say you know the beginning of the creation because it looked like something started don't just think about that it's not something started if something was brought into view that we could understand because see he if he was the beginning of the creation of God that would look like he started something but why not go back to where it says in John 1. in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God that's not a beginning like the word we think of oh start of something it just means it's something coming forth into from what was originally invisible no way to comprehend it because God never had a beginning we're going to read some quotes that sounds odd but then we're going to talk about them a little God never had a beginning he was eternal amen amen now the body of Jesus Christ it had a beginning that's Hebrews 10 5 a body thou has prepared me but in that body was the soul and the spirit of almighty God that's why it called in the fullness of the godhead bodily that's why we believe in one true and living God but yet we don't believe in Oneness because Oneness is like your finger and it just stops it doesn't go yeah Trinity goes over the other way he's got our Father Son and Holy Ghost when it takes Father Son and Holy Ghost to make one God your father you're a human you're a child I mean a son or a daughter but how many people are they of you there's only one that's why the Bible says even the Eternal godhead can be understood by the things that we see if we just think sensible but to try to get our big educational wording but watch even with the educational wording I love to read it because they can keep things pretty straight all right what you see then I asked a question years ago I said when would be the first time you would talk about son of God well basically everybody was saying when he came on Earth you know some 2000 years ago I told you I said but the scholars no that that one that created all things in the beginning that said let there be that that was called a son of God and just like I've told you many times to try to emphasize when Nebuchadnezzar throw those three Hebrew children in that fiery furnace the next day he looked down in there and he said didn't we throw three in we said this four down there now and said that fourth one is like the son of God that King had a great understanding because he knew that if he knew ever who that fourth one was was keeping the other you know Shadrach Meshach and Abednego given them from being destroyed and he knew if that would be right it would have to be God because the only one it could do because remember they heated it seven times it said hotter than it ever been before and it even killed the people that throw them in so he said that must be the son of God he knew that it would have to be almighty God to protect them but he also knew that if he could see some form that he would be dealing with the Eternal God he'd be dealing with what form he was showing himself in right see then that way we can look at it and see that God has done a marvelous thing to open her eyes for us to be able to follow the word and to see the truth of understanding of one true and living God he said but I've been taught all my life it was God the Father God the son God the Holy Ghost I want one scripture for that I want one scripture I'll give you ten thousand dollars if you want that much if you bring me a scripture that says God the Father God the son and God the Holy Ghost see you can't produce it so you go back to to your thinking well you just lost to ten thousand dollars because I ain't gonna give you that if you're thinking because I don't care about your thinking I don't care about my thinking it's what God's word says but that's just how sure when you know what you're talking about you can stand there and say with her and he is right see in that then you have to understand one God to be able to follow throughout the Bible because you know the Bible you know what it is it's a written words to mankind to express to mankind by the writers of the word what that God meant to each one of them right and it was compiled together and brought into our form see then when we go back now to think about something God had never had a beginning it could never have an ending but there was a time that he wasn't called God because that's our English word in the scholars you can take your Scofield bible and read it the word is Elohim Elohim Elohim is the way you want to pronounce it just in case but it means self-existing amen amen so then there was a time God existed alone he was self-existing well he never had a beginning but then as he began to what's a better way of saying it condescend to were human beings could comprehend him so as he would begin to condescend downward to you and I he would begin to unveil himself to allow himself to be comprehended by mankind now why did they kill Jesus they said you're a man making yourself God I mean that's scripture right when it was really god making himself a man God had created a body Emmanuel God With Us and in doing that then we can see that he wants to reveal himself if we are as Paul said in Acts there to them on Mars Hill he said to that unknown God you have a little inscription there just in case you know they had forgotten one maybe he left them out they had God's all over the place but they had a little place left or something in it they said to the unknown God just in case they missed one of them you know big toes hands eyes whatever animals cats dogs they had all kind of Gods in India alone they got over three million gods and goddesses that's three million doctrines but think about it Paul said I want to talk to you about that gun the one you're said the unknown God and he said you've said it before yourselves he said you said that we are his offspring and said that's exactly what we are we are the children of God even Mankind in his lost estate look what he's done in science look what he's wound up and doing like right around him said he said the Bible said in the last days men's heart would fail for fear now specifically in this day heart attacks you know by pieces all kind of things right and he said you know God knew that we'd need it he said he had them to come up with the ability to make a little old bitty pill what is it natural glycerin and you just put one under your tongue see he knew we'd need that that's how great of a God he is you know what that only affects that certain valve or whatever it is in your heart it's nothing else for anything else it goes to that one spot to open it up because he knew we'd need it thank God for doctors good ones quacks I don't care for them I don't care for quack preachers either I have more against quack preachers than I have against quack Gods I mean doctors I can put up with doctors I just walk away I told one one day I said but you believe that God healed my blood pressure I said I got the proof he's laying in front of you that they run at Dart General Motors for quite a few weeks my blood pressure was like 180 over 110. and I said we prayed at the church and got him and you believe it he said nope I got to walk out until my wife was called another doctor I ain't going to him why he's an unbeliever you go fool with an unbeliever in the world but he ain't got no common sense either he can't understand me when I tell him I said doc my wife gets on to him and I go and they say how you doing I said I'm doing wonderful I said what do you think I'm supposed to be 73 years old she said well what are you going to the doctor for so you don't want to go in now I'm going outside okay hey Doc how you doing he's down I said I'm doing wonderful that's got one problem I got a caulk something into my throat that's messed me up give me something for that but other than that I'm doing wonderful when they told me that I had leukemia I just life and said so what supposed to be the kind you don't die of but you die with I'm going to internet doctor he said I said do what you want to do I ain't going to take you chemo I ain't got nothing against anybody else taking it I said you're on that side of it I'm on this side of it you know what it does and I know what it does but I said go ahead I go in there now and he says how you doing I said I'm doing wonderful this guy sees cancer patients all day long chemo treatments all day long he said I'd love for you to come in we just sit down live talk he'd want to listen around on me the other day and I told you about it he was thumping around on my stomach you know I said what are you doing kind of man he's a doctor he you know he's a specialist well he's a human being I said what are you doing he said well I'm checking your spleen to see if it's all right I said Oh I thought she's just stopping me to make us think you know that you knew what she was doing he just alive that's the way I talked to the dog why because they're they're human beings they're not all healer when that doctor cut that bland off and they found it that started with leukemia Florida in there in the body they just told me way before then at my house white blood count was Rising but when they took a gland off the doctor he said can I pray for you I said I sure hope you do yeah yeah he said no I mean we don't pray he said I want to pray right now I said Woo I want you to pray that's the kind of doctors I like and we love doctors we love dog we do everything yet God is the Healer I told him I said doc you can cut all you want to but you can't put it back together it takes God to grow that thing back together cut you wide open there and spread you out like that and work on your heart put you all back together it all grows back yeah okay listen I'm trying to get you to see that we love God is the main thing God is the Healer all right mankind he can do anything he can and they can do amazing things today almost to it's almost to an infinite stage you know if they could just send messages around the world right now this service tonight is overseas that's just something isn't it when he used to you you had to holler to the next door neighbor that's not a way you could get it we kids used to take a string you know and put have you ever done that put a tin can of string and hold it and then to talk into the tin can you know and the other guy on the other end all around hey can you hear me well sure could hear me hear me without the tin can but now my goodness they just do anything they want to because they have broken into God's Laboratory to be able to see and he's allowed these things to happen but I'm trying to get you to see that we believe in an eternal infinite God all wisdom all-knowing all things then that way we know he can predestinate by his foreknowledge and that way he doesn't have to worry about all of the things but now let's get to the point and I said God always begins everything in a a full-grown form even when the Holy Ghost fell on a day of Pentecost it fell on those had been tutored for three and a half years agree right they've been told her they had to live with the Lord Jesus for three and a half years and then the Holy Ghost fail and it put them to where you're looking at the pyramid where it says holy spirit and we know the love of God hadn't come down in The Headstone that was to come in the end time that's according to the scripture amen all right but yet it was a full-grown Church to start off because he doesn't start off anything he never used a novice to write the Bible right he used members of those who were there in the beginning or either like Paul who had received that understanding and God had led him out into the deserts and and opened his eyes to the word see then in that he begins everything in the point that is full grown so then it's something that's full grown now here's the whole here's the whole thing I'm trying to prove and show all right if he begins it in full grown form Adam wasn't a baby and then growed up he's a full-grown man then Eve was taken from Adam full grown not a baby but if you don't get anything out of the message at all get one thing God begins everything in a full-grown form because that's his pattern that's what is supposed to be by everybody Adam was as I said there Sunday Adam was God's pattern God wants every child to be like Adam had control of the animals who lived there in the garden everything was beautiful until sin entered the picture all right then thinking about beginning in a full grown then there's no beginning of a full grown yeah I'm trying to lay down something because when you read there where it says the beginning of the creation of God hunt the prophet of God said that makes most people think that God created Jesus and Jesus created everything else because see it's the beginning of a creation the Bible says all things were made by him Hebrews 1 John 1. James like three and six or six and three where he says Jesus Christ created all things Jesus the flesh man never he wasn't back there right but it was the Christ amen the Christ was the Creator God but and he had a beginning but now not a beginning like something that started that's the purpose of me trying to prove that he begins it with full grown see if we we hold a word beginning we would have it as a baby right come on are are you you're following my point you would have to put it a baby and let it grow up because you'd be starting from a beginning but if you can start something from full grown then you're getting away from a thoughts of an idea of a beginning now you're getting to where it says there in John 1 as we were quoting in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God now you're going back to the eternal to see how the Eternal come into being because remember him being Eternal there was no way we could comprehend him right the Bible says the only begotten of the father hath declared him amen Jesus Christ was the only begotten Adam was created but Jesus was begotten amen amen the body had a beginning but the n-word part of that man soul in spirit had no beginning you can't have an ending all right so then when we talk about in the beginning of the creation and I try to get into the message in a minute we have time and don't think about something that started that's my whole point if you're going to start something you got to start it as a baby that's sensible isn't it none of us got here full grown I don't think we did if you did you beat the rest of us Mom and Daddy got us here and we had a beginning but what about this eternal God that we're talking about who never had a beginning you read of him over in Hebrews about five six seven right through there especially seven where he's talking about Melchizedek and said it had no beginning of days and no ending in life well yet he met he met Abraham and Abraham very archive go back and read your Bible he was able to sit down and eat and everything else but yet Abraham said that he was Lord God made manifest in the flesh that inside had no beginning that flesh he just created it stepped into it and came down all he had to do was speak it right back out and go but see Melchizedek in that way could never die for you and I so God's plan and purpose could never be fulfilled because his plan and purpose was to be a father right to be a savior to be a Healer to be a redeemer he said well how do you know that so sure because I've experienced it amen haven't you haven't you received him as your savior don't you know him as your father and surely you've seen him in healing if you hadn't just look around somebody else has maybe you can look at but you know what I think about that a lot you just think of all the things who was it uh Stonewall Jackson is that the one he said I never take a drink of water without thanking God for it now he was a man right he put all his dependence upon God and you see if we could believe it that way you better sanctify everything you eat drink sister up in Virginia up there just walked by a place one day and some smoke came up they never didn't know what it was I don't know where she's still living or not but I know for many many say 20 years or more than that her lungs and everything was just gone why because there's something she through the air we better thank God every day I trust my wife I love her but she don't know what's in that food she's preparing for me I don't worry about her putting no uh uh arsenic or stuff into it I don't worry about that there's come on folks you got people sitting here that knows the truth every chicken you've ever ate got salmonella in it ever to your chicken's got salmonella not just a few everyone is alive and you eat it eat it it's got salmonella let's go you're gonna quit eating chicken huh I love it but you see church that's why you need to pray over it that's why I've told you inside our medicine cabinet you open the door and right there sticking on that right where all the medicine is at my time you know I stick in there a prayer cloth can right there why ask God to sanctify that medicine sometime and see if it don't change the effects to you why not there's death and all of that amen what do you understanding me now so God begins everything in a full grown form all right we may call it a son that's no problem we're Sons and Daughters of a living God right but the Son and Daughter of a living God mean we're a little bit of kids and well in God we are you have a question you know ain't none of us bigger for nothing we ain't big enough to put on our own shoes let alone I spiritually speak it Einstein couldn't even tell he is he's so smart but we're so dumb quit listen Church when he begun that church on the day of Pentecost he had tutored them for three and a half years and then the Holy Ghost fell right don't you think it would be great today to get back to the book of Acts where they said Silver and Gold Have I None but in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk you think I'm long-winded Paul preached All Night One Night right Feller fell out of window broke his neck right because of Paul's long-winded preacher Well we'd say well what they want Paul you ain't gonna preach that way tomorrow night or he's in all let's preach all night and all day you know why because Paul went down to lady's body up on that boy and the boy was raised back to life he just got up and went on about eating breakfast bad God moving among the church that are in the book of Acts and I long to see that don't you I believe we have signs and wonders among us we've seen the dead Rays we've seen that sick of yield we don't have to talk about it we've seen it it's not bragging the facts are there all right we've seen God bring rain we've seen him take away rain we've seen him do I've seen everything in the world but blinded eyes opened I'm still praying about that but listen Church when he begins something he begins it in a full-grown form so it's not the word beginning when it says the beginning of the creation of God it's stipulating who that is you know whatever the word would be used I don't have the education but he's designating who this is and he he never done it until this age he didn't write of it in any other age but in his age because this is the age of when science would come to Great understanding as we've been talking about right but the only reason they come to Greater understanding is to because God has opened his word if they just had any sense at all the word of God says that there's a day missing in space time and the only way they could ever find it was go back to the Bible and read it right all the scientific equipment they had they couldn't figure it out because they had a day missing if they'd just read the Bible because they finally said well is anybody around here got any hopes whatsoever about this 24 hours that we're missing and God said well in the Bible it speaks of a Time they got their Bible and read it but when they run their calculation systems back to that day and don't you think they can't do it that's what I said they can show you right where this world was at 2 000 years ago because they had to do that to get all the spaceships and things out into orbit because they'd run into each other so they went back and they said well couldn't you find it the man read it to him in the Bible and they said you have to do something wrong because we got about a 20-minute span that we're missing the man says well I do remember another time and then when they read the scripture carefully it doesn't say there when it was speaking of the son standing still you remember Joshua and the son standing still it doesn't say a day it says about a day read your Bible it says about a day and they could prove it was like 20 minutes missing they said was any other thing in there that you could figure out to help us with this he said well there was a time when a man was going to die you remember there in one of the Kings I think and they figured out man this man was going to die until he asked God and he asked him for a sign he said it would be easy for it to go forward but said let it run backwards he ran back so many ever what they were calculating from at that time how much he did you know it went degrees and you know what it wound up being the other 20 minutes they needed if they just read the Bible they could approved right where everything was at from the Bible all right but see God didn't send us a Bible that was written by babies the Bible is the word of God it's written by God himself appearing to mankind amen amen you'd have to agree because how could it be so perfect show me a contradiction in it I want to see it he said well I think don't tell me what you think I want to see it in the word don't give a hoot what you think but listen Church when he begins anything it's not a beginning like you know at one time this was a tree at one time that had a beginning and a seed you know but in God when he's talking about a beginning he's not talking about a beginning like a starting point because how would it be when he said in the beginning was the word right because if he took it that way see you'd say in the beginning a word started the word didn't start you're always there it's God it's why it says in the beginning was the word the word was with God we said well I when you're standing here that's two people but you keep on reading and he said and the Word was God read your Bible all right then anything that we talk about a beginning like that on the death Pentecost when that Holy Ghost fail that was the beginning of the Gentile dispensation of Christ to the church it just simply meant a time that it would come into being because it already prophesied throughout the word all the way down and it just finally come into being so think about that when we think of trying to get into the in the beginning it's not something to start but something that where you can begin to comprehend it right right you remember the story told of the old man when they was telling him that one of these days he'd heard this lecture and he said one of these days said man I'll be just flying all over the world he got up he said that's the biggest bunch of Hypocrites that's ever been so there's no way that man can fly said come on Harvard Wilbur let's go he got his two boys and went home they were the two guys that started the flying they just didn't listen to Daddy right man would you see Church God knew what he was going to do that's what I've been trying to get you to see he had a plan and a purpose to let himself come into manifestation that you and I would have some way of comprehending him we wouldn't be like a person that you know people said but God brother there God is a spirit I know the Bible what is that John 5 24 and John 5 24 God is a spirit and data where it's been much worse been spirit and Truth all right if we can worship any worship Him in spirit and in truth we find out what kind of a God he is see we want to read the part God is The Spirit Well he just floating around I just float around he said Heaven's my throne and Earth is my foot still he said what building to Moses what building could you be make me sure we want to design it and want to do this but what about when Jesus was there on Mount of transfiguration and there was Moses and Elijah talking to Jesus and Peter James and John saw it read your Bible a little Peter said well he was great he said when he's finally saw Jesus in a minute he saw no man but Jesus only he said Lord let's build three Tabernacles one for you one for Moses one for Elijah right but what did God say he said shut up talking about buildings I don't need any I'm the one that surprised all things but this is my beloved Son and whom I'm pleased to dwell in right not just satisfied with him but pleased to dwell in him because what he was almighty God or as I said while ago Jesus was the busy biggest fate that's ever been or either he was almighty God no no brother Dale he wouldn't he he wasn't almighty God he's a second person second person of what give me a trinity word out of the Bible anywhere I'll give you another ten thousand to get that one to find a trinity in the Bible I'll be broke in a little while if somebody produced it but they can't do it well great Scholars say nobody can understand about God we just got to believe believe what you can't believe something that you don't know about so what the Bible says I want to know the Bible said they that no they're God she'll do exploits see the beginning of the creation then what happened there what happened there that we could comprehend remember the purpose the purpose of God in the way he would descend would be able to reveal himself to mankind now come on folks if here's God think a little bit I know that's hypothetical and stupid I guess but if you as God wouldn't you want to be wouldn't you want to reveal yourself to your people wouldn't you want your people to be made known I have no secrets that I keep from my children come on I want them to know about me they got a key to everything at the house they know where everything's at listen Church we have spent all these years trying to make ourselves known to our children what do you think about a God that spent six thousand years making himself known to mankind amen right and he's revealing himself so there when it starts he said well how do you know there's a simple answer to that or a question how do you know I ain't right all right I'm talking to brother the other day I said what gets me these people to say brother Dale I don't agree with you on what you teach I said okay tell me the truth about it well I don't know the truth but I don't agree with you I've had them to openly say that you listen to him well if you can't prove me wrong it's about time to start believing right if you can prove me wrong then come on I'm open for understanding and sure won't correction because I can be helped but don't come and talk to me on silly things well brother Dale don't you believe that that there's a a father son and a holy ghost yes I do but not no three persons come on we've done been through all of that enough hadn't we God injury persons Blessed Trinity where's it at what is the Trinity Doctrine God in three persons Blessed Trinity co-equal and co-eternal that the doctor father son the Holy Ghost now how can the son be co-equal how can it be Eternal if he's a son that's open right that's just as much as I can say a lot of you got children uh any kids ever got as old as you are yet right and even if he died they can't get as old as you are because in a wrong time frame part of it sensible just talk about it that's where I love to talk about God because that's what I do that's the way I see him I see him in everything that I look at you know see another way I don't have to go around try to find him he said I'll be with you hallway he didn't say always because always would mean he is right now sometimes he gets to leave me why because I get into trouble I do things that are not right and he pulls away from me he gives me a little strike and he said light up boy right what do you see what I'm trying to get you to to the point when you say a son of God what do you mean a son of God see Jesus was called a son of God but he wouldn't call God the son that's saying I want to go now he wouldn't call that he was called a son of God all right Nebuchadnezzar looked down in there and said like a son of God Peter one day he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God what did I say it a moment ago why did they kill Jesus they believed they were Sons and Daughters of God come on those Pharisees and Sadducees no matter how sad you want to get on the Sadducees he still believes that he was a child of God he believed he was the son of God they show you the sign of circumcision to prove it showing that their lineage coming from Abraham they believed in the son of God and they knew that Jesus was not saying the way they were saying that they were Sons and Daughters of God the way he said it he said unless you believe that I am he you will die in your sins that was not just saying I am a son they said you're a man making yourself God they knew that what he was saying was that he was the Messiah and you know the Jews today are looking for the Messiah to come right right and they believed the Messiah will be a man go get your Jew and talk to him they have people every so often that they believed to be the Messiah but they're looking for the Messiah to come that's what I told it Israeli God I said you're looking for the coming of Messiah I said but we believe the messiah's already come amen and what he was he was had a rash all over him he was itchy and he said I take two or three baths every night and hot water trying my best to to be able to just exist in the days with y'all I said Reuben you're looking for the coming to Messiah he said yes I said we believe Jesus Christ was that Messiah I said he told us that we lay hands on the sick they shall recover would you mind if Brother Dean was there I said would you mind if we pray for you he said no I wish you would we prayed for her the next morning he got up he's ain't having no more trouble but you know what never converted him what see we talk a lot about Elijah to come into the last days cool times you're a Jew and ask him come on go find your Jew and ask him what's going to happen he believes Elijah is going to come first that's right the four run to Messiah go talk to your Jew and you'll find out a lot of things they believe in the coming of Elijah they believe Elijah is going to show them exactly where to build a temple right to the spot all other things well we just believe Elijah's to come to the Gentiles in the fifth time he's going to go to the Jews that's the only difference but you understand anything's got a beginning has an end to it but if God had no beginning then he'll never have an ending and we've done been through all of the points of showing you the body the human body had a beginning our bodies are not eternal right we got enough sense to look around and know that if you don't believe it come up here and I'll hit you on the big toe you'll find out you're still just a no mortal person but see Jesus was that God made manifest in flesh called the son of God that was the first time the word was used Adam was called a son of God read your Bible Son of God right he was the beginning of mankind as mortal people you agree and he didn't begin as a baby he began as a full-grown man but you see that's what we want to get into the point of thinking about the first creation would always be the example but what we're going to talk about for a minute is just just a few minutes I'll lay down the background we'll get back to this Sunday way to be preaching Sunday afternoon Lord willing we've got a fellowship meeting to go to Saturday so you ain't gonna be gone think about it the best you can do is to read about the scholars or the things and brother Branham was highly read upon those things and he used a lot of Scofield's footnotes and things and I do too as long as I can see it right and those dollars and things they say that the first form of God that could be comprehended in any way would be called the logos which means speech and that's why we were talking about holy ghost that Jesus Christ created all things Hebrews 1. John 1. it says that Jesus Christ created all things not Jesus the flesh no no no come on the Christ the Christ the logos they call it they call it another word they call it theophany the word theophany comes from the basis of being the body of a deity is the best way to define it it's a body Moses saw the back part of a man you remember that in the Bible he kept saying God I'd like to see you what about a man that talked to God face to face lip to lip near to ear come on he had right can he read your Bible it said he talked to him lift the ear Moses one day he said God I'd love to see you he said you can't see me right now because I'm not through with the doings he said I'm going to tell you what you do is you go stand in the cliff to The Rock you remember how the cliff got in the rock that's where Moses was told to go Smite to rock and the water came out for all Israel right not a little trickle of water two million people and all their cattle in their donkeys and horses and all of their animals and camels and things and enough water was running out of one stream there to supply every bit of it and the Bible says the water followed them so everywhere they went it was just right along with them all right you said well that's impossible well you don't believe the Bible they can prove it from the sky now they can go up in the sky and shoot back down and they can follow where that River Run come on I read a little science too I love to read things like that it shows me that the word of God is true yeah we were there riding down through on the on the Dead Sea Shores and looked out there and for half a mile across one side of the road for miles down through there was a prettiest growing fruits and vegetables and the Reuben the God he said Sam we can grow anything that can be grown in the world right alongside the Dead Sea remember the Dead Sea there's no living organism in the Dead Sea you can't even sink in it you can't drown in the Dead Sea you can just lay out on the top of it and it'll hold you up quite so much consistency of salts and minerals I looked around there and I looked turn around look this away and that turns this the desert of a different thing they had just nothing back that way I looked at George Smith and I said brother George the Bible says that the deserts will Blossom like a rose I said look out across there and you know what was all around those trees salt now you explain to me how they how they stop that salt consistency now they're getting back into playing a little bit with it you can get some fertilizer from Jacob that comes out of the ocean it's edible come on you can eat it you can feed it to the deer she put it on the ground it fertilizes it still learning a lot of things but listen to look and see God in his reality and to see that God created all of this he made Mountains for people like mountains he made Flat Lands for people that like to him he made all kinds of things where you could just travel around and here in America the Most Blessed I've been just a little bit in other countries not much enough to see just a little but if you want to see uh if you want to go out and see uh Arizona and not do that away just just go over to uh you know where brother George Quinn is at in Ireland and it looks just like it it's beautiful but you think God made all of that just you and I farage that we could live on he thought that much about us he didn't make it all flat he'd make it all mount why because he he thinks about us amen all right but see this this world was a time that it didn't exist you agree even science says that it was once all together in one big ball burning like the sun and it was some Big Bang Theory they call it that an explosion took place and it swung off clinkers and things out through the space and all those became the Stars the Earth the the different things I don't have no problem with that because I got to come somewhere pretty good point I just don't like the big bang see I believe God just stood there and said let there be let there be let there be because he had in his mind what he wanted he wanted the world you and I could live on they say we're not the center of the universe I'll argue with them scripturally spiritually because this is where God's going to live one day why it's not just the center of the universe he's going to live here because the Bible says he saw the city coming down on the earth well he's going to be here all right but listen a beginning of a creation is a point I'm trying to make don't think of it being like starting points think of it as an expression of something that you know there was a time I was not a father right there was a beginning of being a father but yet within me was all of those abilities before then I just needed a wife I needed somebody to help me to bring forth children well see God he just he didn't need another person well why can't you think about it not another God went out the scholars will tell you that the logos the theophany the son of God it's just another form of God a form called in the Greek Scholars terminology it's called in morphe e-n-m-o-r-p-h-e I guess it in morphe it's taken from a like a stage act or play or that one person plays many parts but you got to go back and change your clothing see and then you can be one character and then you go change your closing you're another character you just keep changing clothing and you know decorations you become looking like another person and that's what the word comes from right and see God then begin to condescend downward that you and I could encounter could comprehend him as he did we come to Genesis 1. said in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth that meant that not in the beginning like a time but a Time the Earth came into being see it's not in the beginning of it of doing it's in the beginning of a Time coming into being Earth huh well see back before then there was a time that he was self-existing he existed alone but in him he had these great thoughts these attributes of him he wanted to be a savior A Healer a father he wanted those things he could create angels and they could worship Him that would make him the word god but he wouldn't have any children angels are not children that's why they can only sing it was saying in job where the morning star sang together but then the sons of God shouted for joy all right then he could say Let There Be that's understandable to bring a world into being but yet we can back up into an understanding and see that God began to unveil himself to let you and I understand him as he did he began to think about what he was going to do and he didn't have to think it out like we think and change your mind well I better not do that I better do it this way better do it that way no no no he's first thought is perfect amen he said I'm going to bring into being mankind I'm gonna give that mankind free moral agency which is a right to choose God won't override your free moral agency to make you be saved if you don't want to be saved he won't save you he won't do it he's a great God but if you desire to be saved he'll have it ready for you so he said I'll just create man I know he's going to fall all I got to do is give him three more agency you remember we went over service after service that he can't create us wrong like my brother said as a Methodist preacher 12 years College you know what he said he said God made him wrong he said God can't judge me for being wrong I said you're wrong that's what I told him if you're wrong God didn't make you the Way You Are I said when you reach the age of accountability you had a choice you could desire to serve God or you could play around and now you went to your Highly Educated forum and you can't understand God never made you wrong where could God get anything to make anything wrong from agreed how could he make anything wrong when there's nothing for him to make it wrong so he made it right amen amen Adam and Eve were perfect standing there not Eternal and flesh no but the greatest he could make them but he knew they'd go wrong well see then you back up before then and you understand that that great God would begin to comprehend what he's going to do he's going to allow me and you to come into being knowing we would fall hey let's don't blame Adam and Eve come on it's like I say about the kids today what do they say you brought us into the world if your fault but we can take you out it's on the internet and the world can hear it but that's true right no no they wouldn't ever one of my kids ever said you brought me into the world so you're responsible for them I wouldn't have killed him might have beat him after that but I wouldn't have given them but the Bible does say be the child that won't die and I got scripture but listen God began to condescend downward to where you and I could understand him and then the terminologies would come up like logos theophany meaning something that cannot be seen is beginning to come into being to work and be seen right then you can understand that he's now fulfilling his plan because I finished the Plan of Redemption he's fulfilling his plan all right then knowing that all of these things would come into view there's no problem with me saying like this what was the first creation see now I've laid down all this time to say creation to get this one point to you okay now remember creation beginning is not our human terminologies when you're speaking in spiritual terms our human terminologies of beginning and creation means a starting time all right but in Bible terminologies it doesn't mean that it means something that was here that was invisible could not be seen by any form of I shot or anything and then it slowly begins to come into view and as it does the spiritual eye first catches see before it could come into view and then it becomes to unfolding down to where we can understand him and to see that the first creation was God himself he said well boy you strapped no eyes the whole message on lining up to that now not a beginning not a starting point Jesus was not a starting point for God Jesus loves God Amen amen amen amen amen the only begotten the Bible said hath declared him declared means bring him out into the orphan where he can be seen amen Jesus said if you've seen me you've seen the father see if we quit looking at our own natural thoughts and and take the Bible terminologies of what we're thinking about the beginning is not a starting point then a beginning is a basis of when something becomes into view see then God who never had a beginning starts condescending and there was a beginning to his condescending a beginning to the basis he's going to reveal himself the prophet of God explains it one day like this he said when that back there to where it said let there be he said it was like a child playing before the father's door what there's no problem using Son of God there speech oh gosh speak it let there be and it was see we see all of these things come into being and we understand to see that God as he unfolds himself to reveal himself not just for being think with me suppose in some way that you could be pulled away from your family or something when you were were you know a baby was born and and you went somewhere and what would you do to that child to get that child to understand who you are come on you can produce paperwork all you want to child don't care about paperwork but what would be the thing that you could do you could begin to relate your life to that child and let that child just understand what you went through in life and that child begins to comprehend well you know that's what has happened to me I've been through this also now we have something that daddy and son can talk about he said my dad died when I was four I never had an opportunity to comprehend it but I'd beg Boris steel or whatever I could do for one moment for my daddy to be sitting right there listening to me preach about God you see some of you haven't had an opportunity to have your father mother with you for a long time praise that and thank God for it you know what it's kind of an odd to think about I'm just trying to close it and you see a little old child and like I said in the story he hadn't been around daddy very long he's been gone off and maybe when he gets to be eight or ten years old they get back together and he said you're my daddy well you know what ain't an odd that that you look around at your kids sometimes and and you start walking and you've got a certain way you walk do and and then you just turn around and watch your kid for a while you know what he walked just like you maybe I ain't seen you but how come it's just a nature it's a makeup the way you act the way you life the way you do and what you cut up and do the way you perform around them will let them know more than anything in the world that you're their parents see that's the way God wants right he wants his offspring his children to love him for what he is he died did you and I could have eternal life you said what you've been talking about an eternal God dying can't but the Eternal God an eternal God can't die I agree with you 100 percent see that's why he had to create that vessel and then stepped into that vessel and lived in that vessel for 33 years but one day on the cross he exited out of that vessel God didn't die the flesh man died but you know what he's so pleased with that until about three days later he picks it up and makes it eternal right and you know what he looks like today that same God it walked ashore to Galilee she'll get a different idea or thought about beginnings and Creations and it'll help us to comprehend what's going on because you see there was a day that you and I began as natural but the eternal life that you have in you makes you a new creature in Christ Jesus is that what Paul said we're a new creature in Christ Jesus I had a beginning time lies I'll have an end the flesh you're looking at but the god that lives inside of me had no beginning and had no end something happens one day and I have to die no problems that eternal life will just exit out of this body it'll take my soul and it'll be beyond the curtain of time waiting for a time to finish it all up because I believe in eternal life I believe you must be born again that's what he told Nicodemus not just a new thought or A New Concept come on brother but you must be born again the original translation if you'll go look it up it says You must be born from above I love to look at the original translation sometimes to comprehend see what it's meaning because that's what it says is you must be born from above you know why because that's where Jesus come from right he came from above because you must be born from above you must be born again to do that would make us a new creature but it wouldn't have a beginning the part that come into you and I is an eternal life had no beginning has no end to it let's stand what do we got 22 in the spiral book Victory in Jesus amen anybody have a knee the altar's open I heard an old ER gave his line on Calvary to save them I was precious you believe it oh Victory in Jesus I knew him and all my love is to him he punched me to Victory evening love I heard about his healing of his cleansing power revealing in the name of Jesus Christ Our Sister is asking for somebody else is in bad shape looks like he's no hope whatsoever yet we believe in a god in Jesus My Savior foreign Jesus my Savior forever and all my love this beauty lunch meat to Victory he beneath the cleansing flood okay father you heard our brother he just wants for you to have your way in his life and the ones around our Lord and all the concern father we know that you're working or this person wouldn't have called when they're doing so we just believe you you're working on both ends and make it all work out in Jesus name anybody else and just have a need punch me to Victory beat me amen you love him see I love him because I know he loves me because he's revealed himself to me that's the way that I know her for sure where I stand I believe his word he's made himself known to us through the opening of the word because that was the way it's supposed to be and just think on these things beginning doesn't mean a starting point like we think it means a time when something can't be comprehended then it can be comprehended you're a new creature in Christ Jesus that's according to the scripture that doesn't mean you as another person that means God has come down into you to give you eternal life so then you have a creation but not a starting point God is eternal father we thank you and we just commit everything to you and We Praise Your Great Name we lord honor you for your word and thanking you now we ask you to just go with us as we go home go about our separate ways and what bless each one you said you'd sense your word and healed us and we believe you now just God and take care of everybody on the way home give everybody a safe journey remember all the sick among us Lord just touch each one in Jesus name you dismissed there is power power one apart there is would you be free from your burden of sin there's power in the blood there's wonderful Power in the Blood there is
