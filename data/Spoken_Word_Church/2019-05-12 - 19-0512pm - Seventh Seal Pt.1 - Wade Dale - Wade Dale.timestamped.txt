[23:13] just keep us in your prayers
[23:14] all right there buddy good let's turn
[23:17] the revelations 8 let's begin today on
[23:20] the Seventh Seal we need we need your
[23:30] prayers that we can get through this
[23:32] this is a and I want to admonish
[23:36] everybody and even myself also there's a
[23:38] brother we were discussing on the phone
[23:41] the other day he said he's you know when
[23:43] brother Branham preached all that six
[23:44] seals he preached it was like some big
[23:46] you know like a concert like it comes to
[23:48] a crescendo you know it comes to a great
[23:50] thing you know something fixing to
[23:52] happen something fixing to happen
[23:53] something things didn't happen and then
[23:56] it don't happen I mean look at brother
[24:01] Branham on the Seventh Seal you watch
[24:02] him will read not today but will read
[24:04] some of the quotes where he's he's not
[24:06] fumbling around but he's not it's the
[24:08] greatest thing that ever happened it's a
[24:10] secret but he's trying to find something
[24:13] to say he goes back and talks about
[24:15] Israel and talks about the first one
[24:16] thing another finally begins to talk
[24:17] about itself but he wasn't satisfied
[24:20] remember he he he mates the tape the
[24:23] next day he's not satisfied he goes back
[24:25] into a motel room with brother fred
[24:27] sauceman if you're reading your book
[24:29] you'll see that brother Fred Salomon and
[24:30] I think of Jean Norman one of them and
[24:34] they retake part of the Seventh Seal he
[24:37] wasn't satisfied with what he preached
[24:39] that Sunday so and we'll get more into
[24:42] that but I want you to see that that
[24:44] this may be kind of a brother Bram
[24:46] talking about being a resting time or a
[24:48] time that's just just kind of you know
[24:49] even the interval that we're gonna
[24:51] discuss in just a minute back over again
[24:53] it's kind of a time of rest it's time
[24:55] it's kind of a time to get your brain
[24:57] kind of locked back into what you know
[24:59] what's going on so just keep us in your
[25:01] prayers and that's if we don't if this
[25:04] if this seal doesn't open we don't go in
[25:06] the rapture if this still doesn't open
[25:08] we don't take a body change all right
[25:09] all the other ones were good six cells
[25:11] finishes redemption that's wonderful and
[25:13] that's great and that's exactly the
[25:14] truth but if the seventh seal doesn't
[25:16] come and reveal itself then then it's
[25:20] all in vain
[25:21] I mean well sure we'll have a you know
[25:23] what but still do funerals and things
[25:25] like that and all that and one day God
[25:26] is gonna come but that's not
[25:27] it's going to happen somebody's got to
[25:29] come to that spot to wear that seal
[25:32] opens to you so revelations 8 verse 1
[25:34] let's bow our heads before we get
[25:36] started
[25:37] dear Lord Jesus we pray today that you
[25:40] would be the one that does the speaking
[25:45] be the one that does the revealing
[25:47] because only you can do that Lord we
[25:50] pray that should be with us Lord give us
[25:51] supernatural strength for this journey
[25:54] and as you're setting the word those who
[25:56] endure to the end shall be saved so
[25:58] we've coming up here to the Seventh Seal
[25:59] the great number seven the end of all
[26:02] things that's come upon us Lord we pray
[26:05] that you would help us through this
[26:06] journey and and number one to never
[26:09] forget you live a real good Christian
[26:12] life Lord and then take these things and
[26:14] as we were talking downstairs in the
[26:15] Sunday School class Lord you don't want
[26:18] us to stay babies he wants to grow up
[26:21] you want us to do adult things you want
[26:24] us to come to a place that we are more
[26:25] mature that you can speak Lord to us and
[26:29] we will truly have the mind of Christ to
[26:31] be able to to speak it back out into
[26:34] this dark world that we're living in or
[26:40] we pray that you just sanctifies for the
[26:42] journey be with the sick Lord be with
[26:43] the ones that are not here the ones that
[26:45] are with their mothers lord thank you
[26:47] for all the mothers that are here Lord
[26:48] and the ones that have even have passed
[26:50] on Lord we we thank God for them as
[26:53] brother John was talking about Lord they
[26:56] they truly they truly are the cream of
[27:00] the crop a true mother they'll take care
[27:03] of the children and take care of the
[27:04] home take four or five boxes of anything
[27:08] you make a meal out of it take many
[27:10] different things and just to make
[27:11] miracles to a mother of that is Lord now
[27:14] I pray this should be with us Lord and
[27:15] let the mother of the word sink down
[27:17] into our heart today Lord that you will
[27:19] take us Lord to a higher level a higher
[27:22] plane someplace Lord that that she
[27:24] wanted man to be I truly believe it was
[27:27] it's the atmosphere that you had with
[27:30] Adam when you were in the Garden of Eden
[27:31] before the fall that there was an
[27:33] atmosphere of fellowship and and worship
[27:36] there between two omnipotence I pray
[27:40] Lord that that's what
[27:41] comes back to now if we're to
[27:43] omnipotence meet Lord we can look face
[27:46] to face in our creators eyes and say
[27:49] father and you look and say well done my
[27:53] son
[27:53] I praise that you'd just be with us now
[27:56] take care of us and lead us guide us in
[27:57] this journey bless the missionaries in
[28:00] the foreign fields lure brother Ernie
[28:01] sent us all that email yesterday showing
[28:04] many pictures of him being over there
[28:06] and just having a good time boy he
[28:07] looked really good with this smile and
[28:09] and the people smiling around him Lord
[28:12] they were glad to see him father just
[28:13] give him supernatural strength and
[28:15] blessed him and take care of him Lord to
[28:16] sanctify us in Jesus name Amen
[28:19] did y'all get that brother any job or
[28:21] just look so he looked so happy to be
[28:24] there so it'd been 14 years since he had
[28:26] been to been to the Philippines so let's
[28:29] just keep him in her prayers and I think
[28:30] he's still over there doing some doing
[28:32] some preaching revelations 8:1 and we
[28:34] need opened the Seventh Seal There was
[28:36] silence in heaven about the space of a
[28:39] half an hour now let's go to John 19 and
[28:41] read the scripture like we were talking
[28:42] last week John 19:30 says when Jesus
[28:46] therefore had received the vinegar he
[28:47] said it is finished and he bowed his
[28:51] head and gave up the ghost let's read
[28:53] one more Ephesians 4:30 and grieve not
[28:58] the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are
[29:00] sealed unto the day of redemption you
[29:04] may be seated in the Lord at his
[29:05] blessing to the reading of the word so
[29:07] now we we're going to do a little
[29:10] something today that we may not be here
[29:11] very long but I want we're gonna when we
[29:14] get finished with with this part this is
[29:17] going to be the seal this is when the
[29:18] the seal is is 8:1 when that still
[29:22] opened there was silence in heaven about
[29:24] the space of a half an hour so there's
[29:26] like we were saying before Jesus when he
[29:30] said it is finished he had finished the
[29:32] part that he had done to that moment he
[29:35] wasn't finished it wasn't the end but it
[29:38] was the end of what he had to do in hit
[29:41] plan of redemption as hanging on the
[29:43] cross but now remember on the surface it
[29:47] looked like nothing was going on I mean
[29:50] here they put this man in a tomb and
[29:52] they'd put the seal in there and then
[29:54] they just went on
[29:55] the next day was their Sabbath day so
[29:56] they were just they were having a day of
[29:58] rest and it was a high Sabbath because
[30:00] the Passover and Sabbath came together
[30:02] on that day because they had to kill the
[30:04] lamb so the natural lamb was killed on
[30:08] the Saturday but the spiritual lamb was
[30:11] killed the day before was on the
[30:13] Passover evening all right and so that
[30:15] showed that that was Christ was the lamb
[30:18] the Passover lamb but when they put him
[30:20] in that tomb he wasn't finished as far
[30:22] as that goes he actually went to work he
[30:25] went to hell and preached to the souls
[30:27] that were in prison he went to paradise
[30:29] and emptied up paradise and brought them
[30:31] up with him brought up a resurrection
[30:33] with him and then when he come out of
[30:35] that tomb he didn't have to roll the
[30:37] stone away I mean he just didn't
[30:39] physically have to do it he just moved
[30:41] the stone out of the way of his own will
[30:43] and walked out and then he said all
[30:44] power and heaven earth been given unto
[30:46] me so there was the seventh seal on
[30:49] display the man had done his work and
[30:53] brother branham said one tenth of one
[30:56] one tenth of 100% he got way down there
[30:59] didn't even know Christ was on the earth
[31:01] at the time hey man so that's the way
[31:03] it's going to be now you and I are are a
[31:05] strange group of people we are we are
[31:09] not normal and some of the kids might
[31:12] want to say amen to that but I'm not
[31:14] talking about that kind of abnormal I'm
[31:15] talking about spiritually abnormal
[31:17] alright but it but you know what Jesus
[31:20] Christ was that way they didn't he
[31:22] wasn't a normal God they didn't come the
[31:23] way they thought he was gonna come but
[31:26] remember when we talked about this
[31:27] sealed keep some part this thing in the
[31:29] back of your mind that the seal the seal
[31:34] was very on the surface uneventful
[31:38] cuz listen listen when the first shell
[31:40] open you had one activity you had a
[31:42] white horse you had a bowl you had this
[31:44] and second seal you had a red horse that
[31:47] you could look at and you could see this
[31:48] guy riding with you know I had one of
[31:50] them had balances and then this one
[31:51] happened to this and in the fifth seal
[31:53] you look you see souls under the altar
[31:54] sixth seal you look at all my heavens
[31:57] the tribulations are going on in that
[31:58] sixth seal I mean the whole worlds in
[32:00] chaos so there's things going then you
[32:02] come up to the seventh seal that's why I
[32:03] said it's kind of it's not a letdown at
[32:06] all but it is on the surface
[32:08] being human beings you read that ceiling
[32:10] you go where do we go from here because
[32:15] that's hidden that seal hides everything
[32:18] that seal is the most powerful seal
[32:21] that's why I read Ephesians 4:30 and we
[32:24] were talking about this in the
[32:25] Philippines there's only one seal grieve
[32:28] not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye
[32:30] are sealed unto the day of redemption
[32:31] all right now don't forget that word
[32:34] Redemption because remember when we come
[32:37] to this seventh seal Redemption is over
[32:40] but now we also got to remember that
[32:42] that seal see here's the whole situation
[32:45] we we wait we'll get to it a little bit
[32:49] later we wait we go one two three four
[32:51] five six seven and then something's
[32:53] gonna happen well nothing happened
[32:56] I mean sit here for 30 minutes and don't
[33:01] move and don't just don't say don't say
[33:02] Amen turn everything off
[33:04] no music of course most of you do that
[33:08] anyway and fall asleep but but still you
[33:11] may be out thirty minutes of silence
[33:13] wouldn't be so bad but we have you just
[33:16] try this but it's boring to an
[33:20] individual but once we see the
[33:21] underneath the Thunder what that seal
[33:24] really is it's the greatest seal that
[33:26] ever was to open because remember he
[33:28] didn't open all the way over here when
[33:30] the prophet of God stood out there the
[33:32] first day and said here stands a limb
[33:34] with the book in his hand there goes a
[33:35] white horse rider well the Seventh Seal
[33:37] is the lamb the lamb is the seventh seal
[33:40] so the seventh seal showed up on the
[33:43] first seal to open that first seal they
[33:46] couldn't open without Jesus Christ being
[33:50] on the scene telling the Prophet and
[33:52] we're going to read it next Sunday I
[33:54] didn't bring it with me this time but
[33:55] like brother Dale was talking about this
[33:56] morning there's two times in the seventh
[33:59] seal where brother Branham says this was
[34:02] way away from my thinking I was going on
[34:05] my old notes I was going to preach this
[34:07] right here and it was totally opposite
[34:11] to what I was preaching formerly because
[34:15] he had had his thought many times that
[34:17] the fifth seal Jew was the martyred
[34:20] Church age right
[34:22] the first seal he preached was the Holy
[34:24] Ghost and all these different things so
[34:26] all that was turned away from what he
[34:29] was thinking but to me and see that was
[34:32] the seventh seal working there was
[34:35] silence there but it was he was working
[34:37] in a profit he Jesus Christ and then
[34:40] even on the even on the questions and
[34:43] answers on the seals brother Branham
[34:46] answers a question wrong
[34:49] revelations five somebody asked him who
[34:51] is these people they say oh that's
[34:52] brother Branson no that's not the that I
[34:55] said is that the bride needs to know
[34:56] that's not the bride and then he goes on
[34:58] and he starts answering the next
[34:59] question and he said stop something's
[35:01] wrong
[35:03] okay stop something's wrong somebody
[35:05] need to be prayed for he didn't even
[35:07] know itself and then brother Ned I was
[35:09] in which was sitting behind him said
[35:11] read your scripture again now there were
[35:13] several people in that building they
[35:14] knew what that scripture meant but
[35:17] brother Branham said he said thank God
[35:19] for Christ being on the scene to show
[35:22] what he didn't want he wasn't gonna let
[35:24] him make any mistakes anymore seventh
[35:28] seal there's no mistake in it now six
[35:30] seal you can have these different types
[35:31] and shadows but the seventh seal is one
[35:33] person and that's Jesus Christ all right
[35:36] there is no imitation you show oh no no
[35:39] there's no imitation when that seventh
[35:42] seal is not Christ in the Antichrist
[35:44] no it's Christ it's the headstone it's
[35:47] that head right up there all right I
[35:49] mean like we were talking about in the
[35:51] interval the period between the two
[35:54] events we're talking about the the other
[35:56] day we'll talk about the six seals then
[35:58] there's a gap remember that about three
[36:01] or four Sundays ago there's a gap or an
[36:02] interval in between the two events
[36:05] between the sixth seal and the seventh
[36:07] seal between the sixth trumpet in the
[36:09] seventh trumpet between the six vial of
[36:11] seventh vial between all the churches
[36:14] everything there's an interval from the
[36:16] sixth to the seventh and it's a time of
[36:19] resting a pause a gap you want to pull
[36:20] it up and it was what I missed you gonna
[36:26] pull that up there there was one I
[36:28] missed and I'm glad the Lord showed me
[36:29] that because you guys see all your types
[36:31] because what happened with remember we
[36:34] even showed that who
[36:35] came on the scene after every in the
[36:37] interval there was the holy ghost coming
[36:40] same way with the seals what happened
[36:43] with the seals you got six seals then
[36:45] you've got revelation seven which is God
[36:47] the holy ghost going to to prop through
[36:50] two prophets to take Israel out and then
[36:53] the seventh seal produces itself he
[36:56] comes back to earth
[36:57] and fights for Israel and that's what
[36:59] the Bible says now he doesn't come back
[37:00] in a physical form we know that but
[37:02] still it talks about in Daniel it talks
[37:04] about the Christ coming and fighting for
[37:06] Israel alright so watch and then we then
[37:09] what does he do 144,000 people 144,000
[37:12] are saved and then they're caught up
[37:14] then on the trumpets you've got trumpet
[37:17] one two three four five six then you got
[37:18] to get which is revelations ten one
[37:22] there by right there at ten one and
[37:24] that's the mighty angel that's Christ
[37:27] that's the lamb that's the Holy Ghost
[37:29] that's the person of God coming down the
[37:31] mighty angel coming down right and then
[37:35] we see the vials was the same way the
[37:37] three unclean spirits like frogs and to
[37:40] have the three unclean spirits like
[37:41] frogs there had God had to reveal what
[37:43] that was the Holy Ghost God revealed
[37:46] that that was the Trinitarian doctrine
[37:48] all right and then Christ and the Holy
[37:50] Ghost is present to reveal we see that
[37:53] that's what it is so now we see if we've
[37:56] now come to the sixth seal and we're
[37:58] finished with the sixth seal then God's
[38:00] the one that's going to have to reveal
[38:01] all this to us it can't be just me or
[38:03] brother Dale or anybody else but I
[38:05] missed one when we look at our types and
[38:08] our shadows we have to make it all fit
[38:11] between the sixth and seventh church age
[38:13] now in the Bible there's not an interval
[38:17] but when brother Branham comes on the
[38:20] scene everybody with me and he and he's
[38:25] talking about the church ages and then
[38:29] we went through it remember no messenger
[38:35] to the aged between the six churches in
[38:39] the seven churches no messenger to the
[38:42] aged the Holy Ghost comes himself in the
[38:45] fullness of the baptism so there's your
[38:47] another interval for the seventh seal to
[38:50] come on the scene there has to be the
[38:51] holy ghost here and not just in partial
[38:53] not just impartial word because look the
[38:56] holy ghost has been here the whole time
[38:58] our problem is is we just not let him
[39:01] work the way he wants to work that's our
[39:05] problem we've not let him work the way
[39:08] he's supposed to work because we've had
[39:09] these scruples and we've had these
[39:11] rabbit trails that we go down and we've
[39:13] had these things that we've had in our
[39:15] mind that that our tradition remember
[39:17] the tradition we were talking about the
[39:19] other day about you know Mama's walking
[39:21] on the streets to go with that with
[39:22] Jesus right now well that's not true
[39:24] there's not even a Bible for that but
[39:27] it's been told so many times down
[39:28] through the ages of tradition that
[39:30] everybody believes that same way with
[39:32] like brother Branham was talking I was
[39:33] reading it yesterday brother Branham
[39:35] said the Catholic Church deals with
[39:36] dogma
[39:37] now Dogma is something that the Catholic
[39:39] Church comes up with it's not biblical
[39:42] now part of it is but now remember in
[39:46] this 7th seal brother Brown said Satan
[39:48] cannot interpret this he cannot
[39:51] impersonate this right we'll read those
[39:54] quotes a little bit later on
[39:56] but we have been in a gap or at pause or
[39:59] a space or rest or a breach or an
[40:01] interlude like we were talking about the
[40:03] other day in the acts of a play now
[40:05] we're in I believe we're in the seventh
[40:08] act of this play that we're in and then
[40:12] the curtain when the curtain closes
[40:13] God's gonna take us out of here all
[40:15] right we're gonna be gone there's not
[40:18] gonna be any bride left amen but you and
[40:27] I are gonna have to come to a place that
[40:29] we've never been before that's why I
[40:34] read you that scripture about Joshua
[40:36] Joshua when they got ready to go over he
[40:38] said you got to leave an interval leave
[40:40] a space because you never went this way
[40:41] before we're gonna let the priest go
[40:43] ahead we're gonna let the word go ahead
[40:45] and then you're gonna follow right
[40:46] behind but not right up close to them
[40:48] because you might stumble you may
[40:50] stumble into something to stumble on
[40:51] something but you watch those priests
[40:53] and you watch the man with them with the
[40:55] ark on his back and once they get about
[40:58] a thousand meters and he starts walking
[40:59] if he makes a little
[41:01] this way you got to make that turn once
[41:02] you get there that's the same way with
[41:04] you and I it's really the analogy
[41:07] brother branham used about a prophet
[41:09] you know anybody and really honestly I
[41:12] can build a straight wall
[41:14] I just cannot make that corner thingy
[41:17] that daddy makes I can't make that well
[41:20] it takes a prophet it takes somebody
[41:22] that knows what they're doing to turn
[41:23] that corner of the building and it's
[41:26] really nothing that's the same 2x4 is it
[41:28] she huge going down the wall you just
[41:30] put them together a little bit different
[41:32] all right make a corner all right so
[41:34] that's what the Prophet did what we're
[41:36] trying to explain this morning thank God
[41:39] you know that brother branham can be you
[41:41] call it giving them all kind of titles
[41:42] but I just know one thing's for sure if
[41:45] it had not been for him we would not be
[41:47] where we're at today in the Word of God
[41:51] so God knew that and sent us a prophet
[41:53] so we would be where we are in the word
[41:56] today the Word of God what he preached
[41:59] is now living inside of us doing the
[42:03] work amen choice so who is it it's the
[42:06] Holy Ghost and then brother Branham on
[42:08] the seals he says Christ the lamb the
[42:10] Holy Ghost self same person so we're not
[42:13] going by three or four different people
[42:14] we're talking about one person and if it
[42:18] says grieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[42:20] whereby you are sealed unto the day of
[42:23] redemption now is that a different
[42:26] Christ inside of you than the one that
[42:30] did the redeeming how can you be
[42:32] redeemed you gotta become the Redeemer
[42:34] amen like I told you in Revelations 5
[42:38] that book that God that that the lamb
[42:41] takes is you and if he took the book you
[42:48] got to be worthy or you wouldn't take
[42:50] the book that's not a book of the living
[42:54] that's not the book that's over there in
[42:56] the Book of Revelations it talks about
[42:58] the white throne judgment that's not
[43:00] that book that book is a book of the
[43:03] names of the redeemed that is the sons
[43:05] and daughters of Almighty God that is
[43:08] not just every person in the world why
[43:10] because they're not worthy but you and I
[43:13] are worthy because
[43:14] the way you look in these seals and if
[43:16] you'll look and see how that God moved
[43:18] up through their way even with brother
[43:20] branham and he said I've never worked in
[43:21] a realm like this before
[43:23] he said I've seen healings and I've seen
[43:25] all these things going on he said but
[43:26] this right here he said in other words
[43:28] this is the apex of my ministry and it
[43:33] didn't seem like nothing was going on as
[43:35] far as what we think is going to go on
[43:37] you know as far as the healings and the
[43:40] signs and the wonders and many different
[43:41] things
[43:42] if you'll notice even when he had a when
[43:44] he had the prayer line in the six the
[43:47] questions and answers on the seals it
[43:50] was just they come through the line and
[43:51] he said receive your healing in the name
[43:53] of Jesus receive your healing it was
[43:54] just a it was just a normal prayer line
[43:56] it wasn't very much supernatural going
[43:58] on he didn't call many people out I
[44:00] don't think you called anybody out so
[44:02] you see what I mean it's coming to a
[44:04] place to where wait saying brother way
[44:07] all right you got to have a personal
[44:09] experience yourself you got to know that
[44:11] you know that you know now that I know
[44:13] that brother mark knows not that I know
[44:15] the brother Dale knows you got to know
[44:18] that you know that you know that that
[44:19] seventh seal has been revealed to you
[44:22] you personally it started as a personal
[44:26] relationship and it's got an end as a
[44:28] personal relationship hey man so you and
[44:31] I have got to come to a place but we
[44:33] have to go through that little journey
[44:35] called Redemption because to redeem
[44:39] there is things you have to do remember
[44:42] what did what did Boaz have to do Boaz a
[44:46] type of Christ what did he have to do he
[44:48] had to not only take the shoe off he had
[44:51] to go to the near kinsman say hey are
[44:56] you gonna do this we know that what the
[44:58] story is that's type of the devil he had
[45:01] to go to the devil first right he had to
[45:05] go to the near kinsman and he said yeah
[45:07] I'll do it and then Boaz god almighty
[45:10] just he just turns this thing around on
[45:12] the devil and he says okay said you got
[45:14] to have a baby with her and you got to
[45:15] raise the fat baby in your name he said
[45:17] whoa
[45:18] well you go ahead because he's Satan
[45:21] don't want to Mar his name that's what
[45:22] st. don't want amar that beautiful name
[45:24] that he's got I'll take Christian any
[45:27] day
[45:28] but so bo laughs what do you do though
[45:30] to do to do the right of redemption
[45:32] though he and just say okay over with no
[45:35] he had to go stand out in a public place
[45:37] you see what I'm talking about their
[45:38] scenes here he had to go out in a public
[45:40] place you had to take his shoe off and
[45:42] he had to hand it to somebody I don't
[45:43] remember who it was but he hadn't had it
[45:45] and say I read to him everything that
[45:47] neoman has lost then in redeeming
[45:50] everything that Naomi had lost he gets
[45:52] Ruth and then of course we know the
[45:55] story they have a child and they give
[45:56] the child back to the mother and a
[45:58] perfect type of us giving the message
[45:59] back to Israel when the baby is born we
[46:04] take the baby back to Naomi and say
[46:06] here's Jesus Christ and that's what goes
[46:09] to through the 144,000 all right so
[46:12] let's read just a couple of quotes here
[46:13] and then we'll I kind of figured we
[46:15] would be on be on resting mode today so
[46:20] I got us a little something we're gonna
[46:22] look at about the number seven because
[46:24] we're number seven is you say some good
[46:27] things in there alright let's look at
[46:30] the first quote let me read this again
[46:32] cuz I want you to see now we come to the
[46:34] seventh seal and we say oh well the
[46:36] seventh seal something different no it's
[46:37] still the plan of redemption it is the
[46:40] ending it is the total it is the total
[46:43] summation of from when Adam fell in the
[46:46] Garden of Eden to today all right now
[46:50] our kinsman has handed the seven sealed
[46:52] book of redemption from the original
[46:53] owner this just revelations five it's
[46:56] what he's talking about Revelation
[46:57] chapter 5 when we lost it in the Garden
[47:00] of Eden through Adam it went back to the
[47:03] original owner but there's been a poster
[47:05] on the land a squatter that Satan he
[47:07] came over he's a poacher and now
[47:08] remember he's the one that's riding
[47:10] through the church ages
[47:11] he's one that's missing all this up this
[47:13] earth don't belong to him belongs to God
[47:16] but he's a poacher a squadron man how I
[47:18] could say something right now but I
[47:19] better not is the title deed of our
[47:21] Redemption this seventh seal book he's
[47:23] not asking a question he's telling us
[47:26] the title deed the redemption is this
[47:28] seventh seal book it's the title deed
[47:31] you wait till we get into the seals he
[47:32] breaks the seals reveals gives us his
[47:37] inheritance to his people all right so
[47:40] the seventh seal has two
[47:41] be the lamb God Almighty Christ Jesus
[47:45] Christ it came down and paid the price
[47:48] he's the one that breaks the seal
[47:50] because remember the lamb breaks the
[47:52] seal not the Father we know it's the
[47:55] same person but we got a position we got
[47:58] to look at the the father is on the
[48:01] throne and gives the book or actually
[48:03] the lamb takes the book and the lamb
[48:06] breaks the seal that's why it's a book
[48:08] of redemption the lamb is always the
[48:12] redemption it's the system it's the
[48:14] sacrifice he breaks the seals reveals
[48:19] gives us his inheritance to his people
[48:22] now what did he inherit while he was
[48:25] here on earth he inherited eternal life
[48:27] in his body he didn't need eternal life
[48:31] in the soil didn't eternal life in his
[48:33] spirit he needed eternal life in his
[48:35] body and that's the inheritance that he
[48:37] received by breaking the seals now
[48:40] listen breaking the seals means that you
[48:43] got something to do with him
[48:45] he didn't just break it and throw the
[48:47] book away no he broke it open the book
[48:51] and says here comes Regina here comes
[48:53] sister Peggy here comes sister Charlotte
[48:56] here comes sister brother he opened the
[49:00] book to reveal you to reveal you not him
[49:05] we know who he is he's been written all
[49:07] down through the Bible but he's the
[49:09] Muslim misunderstood person there is in
[49:11] the Bible so are you going to be any
[49:13] different no they're not gonna they're
[49:15] gonna be same way with you they're not
[49:16] gonna understand who you are I've told
[49:18] you many times that one mystery in
[49:21] Revelation is 10 7 is you the mystery of
[49:26] God should be finished amen he breaks
[49:31] the seals reveals gives us his
[49:34] inheritance to his people he gives the
[49:37] inheritance that he inherited becoming
[49:39] kinsman redeemer and freely gives it out
[49:43] to us it all belonged to him he was the
[49:46] one who redeemed but instead of keeping
[49:47] it himself he gives it back to the
[49:49] people all right so you and I are
[49:51] recipients of this that's his love for
[49:54] us
[49:55] see Satan wouldn't have that kind of
[49:57] love if you gave Satan eternal life he
[49:59] had been built he'd be the most selfish
[50:00] person in the world that's just his
[50:05] attitude
[50:06] all right let's read number 2 the breach
[50:09] now when we go to break these seals
[50:12] you're going to see it goes plumb back
[50:14] in the scriptures all the way back now
[50:16] listen what he's saying and when we go
[50:18] to breaking these seals you're going to
[50:20] see it goes plumb back in the scripture
[50:22] all the way back for each one of these
[50:25] seals the whole thing together the whole
[50:27] mystery lays right here in these seals
[50:32] every mystery of the Bible lays in these
[50:35] seals in the seals cannot be broken
[50:37] until that time I'll prove it here in
[50:39] just a minute notice now the book
[50:41] remember is sealed here's one here's
[50:43] this seal then another one remember this
[50:46] is what he's doing he's twisting it up
[50:48] like this because remember it's not in a
[50:49] book form it's in a scroll form all
[50:51] right another one wrapped the seal it's
[50:53] a book of redemption and the whole thing
[50:54] together makes the book and it's sealed
[50:57] with seven seals and being us on the
[50:59] backside is because just wound up the
[51:02] seal mystery is on the inside he's just
[51:05] telling you right there the sealed
[51:06] mysteries on the inside this is the seal
[51:10] mystery that the seal the seal sure that
[51:12] was number one mystery that the seal
[51:14] part was but once it was tore off you
[51:18] don't have to rehash listen once brother
[51:20] Graham preached that the wild horse
[51:21] rider was Antichrist I believe most
[51:23] people was like well we should have seen
[51:26] that because of the way it presents
[51:29] itself now we don't have to go back and
[51:32] rehash that it's broke but now what's
[51:36] inside of it we do over and over and
[51:38] over again we have to go to church we
[51:40] have to read their Bible and we have to
[51:42] see that the part that we didn't see
[51:43] that now we can see is that seventh
[51:46] sealed book of redemption it's a book of
[51:49] redemption and the whole thing together
[51:52] makes the book and it's sealed with
[51:53] seven seals being on the backside still
[51:55] just wound up the sealed mysteries on
[51:57] the inside now where's your mystery
[52:00] where's your mystery your mysteries on
[52:04] the inside because you know what I see
[52:07] you just like I did 20 years ago
[52:09] years ago 50 years ago well most we had
[52:13] more hair than that and it was darker
[52:15] but anyway but now well what I'm saying
[52:20] is we all change but we're not changed
[52:23] in so we got changed one time inside and
[52:25] that's the mystery is that gods inside
[52:27] they're doing the work and we're getting
[52:29] older and older and older and really
[52:31] over a lot older really old earth that's
[52:38] a mystery the seals the mystery seals on
[52:40] the ant mysteries on the inside and it
[52:42] only says white horse rider black horse
[52:44] rider what more on the outside see but
[52:46] the mystery of the whole book is in them
[52:48] fields from Genesis to revelations a
[52:50] complete plan of redemption is revealed
[52:52] in these seven seals oh it's the
[52:55] important time now look we've read the
[52:58] quote many many times that six seals
[53:01] finishes Redemption now he's telling us
[53:02] that seven seals has two holds the whole
[53:04] plan of redemption they're bad news
[53:07] everybody with me everybody with me we
[53:10] know six seals finishes redemption
[53:12] because there's nothing seven seals just
[53:14] a silence in heaven so that ought to
[53:16] prove to you that number seven had to be
[53:19] at number one had to be at number two
[53:22] had to be at number three had to be four
[53:24] had to be five had to be at number six
[53:25] the seventh seal had to be on the scene
[53:28] revealing all these other seals then
[53:31] when you get to number seven he's going
[53:34] to give you that inheritance that he
[53:35] inherited which is what eternal life in
[53:37] your body well it was don't excited son
[53:47] but I guess it doesn't stop son all
[53:51] right number three it is the rising of
[53:52] the Sun well actually number yeah look
[53:58] what we've seen in this day the
[54:00] quickening power has come to us to open
[54:01] the seven seals now look we think like
[54:06] brother Dale saying this morning that's
[54:07] thinking about it while he's freezing
[54:09] you go back to your old idea that you
[54:12] gotta have an emotion you got to have a
[54:14] cry you got to have a cloud or a you got
[54:18] to have a guy have a wallet
[54:24] if the quickening power came and opened
[54:26] the seals during that week brother
[54:28] branham said that was the greatest week
[54:30] he'd ever been in they didn't many
[54:32] people get healed they went no they
[54:34] wasn't a great shining light come down
[54:36] in the tabernacle you understand what
[54:39] I'm saying then you get on the Seventh
[54:41] Seal and he acts like you don't know
[54:43] what he really don't know where to go
[54:44] how to go what's going on we're gonna
[54:46] take this right now this is all we got
[54:48] to go on but the quickening power was
[54:51] the Seventh Seal that would not let
[54:53] brother Branham make a mistake no more
[54:56] mistakes the whole week God was
[54:58] orchestrating that whole week worth of
[55:02] services and he was there doing the work
[55:06] but he was doing it for me and you
[55:08] so the quickening power has come to us
[55:11] to open the seven seals because remember
[55:14] look it's not how many people let me try
[55:18] to get this right brother Ram didn't
[55:20] have to heal 850 people raised 14 from
[55:24] the dead you understand he didn't have
[55:25] to get a resume he didn't have to get a
[55:29] resume so that God could speak to him so
[55:32] he could open the seals no he came to a
[55:34] position in the Word of God he came to a
[55:38] position in the Word of God now we all
[55:40] that other is extra stuff that's
[55:42] manifestations around signs follow the
[55:45] believer but what happened was God was
[55:47] opening the word up to the Prophet and
[55:49] here he was and all these things going
[55:51] on but look the quickening power what
[55:56] was it the intelligence of a man know
[56:00] the quickening power of God that he
[56:03] could stand on that platform and know
[56:05] that he could not make a mistake from
[56:09] there to the time he left he could not
[56:12] make a mistake
[56:13] God wented all of our ignorance but
[56:15] they've come a time now to where look
[56:17] Jesus Christ never made a mistake never
[56:23] made a mistake we only have three and a
[56:26] half years
[56:27] remember the silent years we don't know
[56:29] anything about much but that three and a
[56:31] half year message that man walked in
[56:33] human flesh and never made one mistake
[56:36] now you say well he yeah he might have
[56:38] got lost one day and when he was a kid
[56:40] you know you understand what I mean when
[56:42] he spoke it was God speaking that was
[56:45] the seventh seal producing itself
[56:47] because when he spoke things happen all
[56:49] right same thing with you and I what was
[56:51] it the intelligence of a man no the
[56:53] quickening power of God see the
[56:55] quickening power of God foretold this
[56:57] would take place see the quickening
[57:00] power of God made the world testify to
[57:02] it he's talking about the angel down in
[57:04] Arizona it's the truth the angel of the
[57:07] Lord I told you was around in a pillar
[57:10] fire now there's nobody brother Ram told
[57:13] him on the seventh ceiling on the sixth
[57:14] Hill he said there's something going on
[57:16] this whole week and said I was hoping
[57:19] somebody wouldn't would figure it out or
[57:21] would come and nobody did there's
[57:25] something going on all week what the
[57:27] angel of God the pillar of fire was in
[57:29] that building every single service and
[57:32] nobody saw it that's what he said
[57:35] I'm to see the quickening power God made
[57:37] the whole world testifying that's out in
[57:38] Arizona the angel of the Lord I told you
[57:40] was around in a pillar of fire
[57:42] quickening power let the world testify
[57:45] that it's the truth and in that they
[57:48] didn't know what it was and we knew just
[57:52] look this away and it's our Lord up
[57:54] there you see he's talking about turning
[57:55] just like that he's he's showing it
[57:59] right there he's the one who opened
[58:02] those seals
[58:03] he is those seals so if he's the seventh
[58:07] seal then he's the first one second one
[58:09] third of them four of them fit to
[58:10] encephalon because no one brother
[58:12] branham could not open those seals he
[58:15] tried he preached them before he he went
[58:18] through many many times preached him
[58:20] several times preached one series on and
[58:23] preached to all 71 one service but he
[58:27] never saw this part until when he got to
[58:30] that he's the one who opened those seals
[58:33] he is those seals for the whole Word of
[58:37] God is Christ and Christ is the seals
[58:40] that was opened I thought it was the
[58:42] Antichrist and I thought it was the air
[58:44] tell this in the Anti Christ is the
[58:48] seals
[58:49] that was open what is the opening of
[58:52] seals then revealing Christ's glory now
[58:58] let's take the scripture Christ in you
[59:02] the hope of glory that's what I said
[59:04] folks these seals we've put them there
[59:06] in a book form we've listened to tape
[59:08] but what's on this page right here does
[59:11] us no good but if we become what that is
[59:14] if you become what that is then you're a
[59:17] walking seal yourself that's why I read
[59:19] the scripture grieve not the Holy Spirit
[59:20] of God whereby you are seven sealed
[59:24] because you're sealed with those seven
[59:26] seals
[59:27] you are the seal that's what I'm trying
[59:29] to get you to see but I just think
[59:30] getting anywhere you don't think about
[59:33] taking ice cream or something on them
[59:35] number four will turn down to the eighth
[59:39] chapter or the one first verse I mean of
[59:44] the eighth chapter revelations eight I
[59:46] know you're tired now just try to listen
[59:48] for a few minutes and God of heaven help
[59:50] us is my prayer now here he's reading it
[59:51] we must remember that the seventh seal
[59:54] is the end of time of all things I'm
[59:58] gonna read this and then we'll break it
[1:00:00] down later I just want to tell you what
[1:00:01] the seal is but watch what this is we
[1:00:04] must remember that this seventh seal is
[1:00:06] the end of time of all things that's
[1:00:08] right the things written in the seven
[1:00:11] sealed book sealed up of the plan of
[1:00:15] redemption from before the foundation of
[1:00:17] the world it every bit ends it is the
[1:00:22] end it is the end of the struggling
[1:00:25] world it is the end of struggling nature
[1:00:29] it's the end of everything and there is
[1:00:32] the end of the trumpets because remember
[1:00:34] all trumpets sound on the sixth seal
[1:00:35] right that's the end of the vowels go
[1:00:39] see what he's talking about we're fixing
[1:00:41] handed in the Millennium seven seals got
[1:00:43] to be on the only earth to get us out of
[1:00:46] here so that we can make it to the
[1:00:48] Millennium okay all right it's the end
[1:00:51] of everything comes remember look seven
[1:00:53] is still in time redemption happens in
[1:00:57] time redemption cannot happen in
[1:00:59] eternity redemption has to happen in
[1:01:01] time that's why the moon
[1:01:03] it's not a seven it's an a we're still
[1:01:06] under the Seventh Seal in the millennium
[1:01:10] color still in time
[1:01:11] that's Redemption still going on listen
[1:01:14] redemption happens all the way up to the
[1:01:15] white throne judgment the man and there
[1:01:18] is the end of everything and there's the
[1:01:20] end of the trumpets into the vials into
[1:01:21] the earth it's even the end of time time
[1:01:24] runs out the Bible says immense
[1:01:27] revelations 10 chapter 1 through 7 time
[1:01:30] runs out the angel said time will be no
[1:01:32] more when what in the days of this great
[1:01:34] thing to happen everything runs out in
[1:01:36] this time the end of the EV the at the
[1:01:40] end of this seventh seal notice it's the
[1:01:43] end of the church age it's the end of
[1:01:45] the seven seals it's the end of the
[1:01:48] trumpets it's the end of the vials even
[1:01:50] ends the ushering in of the Millennium
[1:01:52] right because remember that seventh seal
[1:01:56] is going to come back into the
[1:01:57] Millennium with a bride to rule and
[1:02:01] reign on the earth for a thousand years
[1:02:03] in time in read em still in Redemption
[1:02:07] that's on the seventh seal everybody got
[1:02:10] that say man
[1:02:11] alright so now let's read number five
[1:02:19] this is what we're going to call this
[1:02:21] seal in just a minute brother branham
[1:02:22] named it and it's the meaning of canyon
[1:02:25] he said this is the third Pole and
[1:02:27] there's three great things that goes
[1:02:28] with it and one unfolded today we're
[1:02:30] gonna get into all that later because of
[1:02:33] the sixth seal open in three parts the
[1:02:38] seventh seal opened in three parts
[1:02:39] everybody got that
[1:02:40] all right cuz three is perfection but
[1:02:43] we're gonna get into this number seven
[1:02:44] in a minute the other one unfolded today
[1:02:46] and there's one that I cannot interpret
[1:02:48] because it's in an unknown language but
[1:02:50] I was standing right there and looked
[1:02:51] right straight at it this is the third
[1:02:52] pole coming up now what is the third
[1:02:54] pole the opening of the word you can say
[1:02:56] it's this day or the other but it's the
[1:02:57] opening of the word this is the third
[1:03:00] pole coming up and the Holy Spirit of
[1:03:02] God oh my that's the reason all heaven
[1:03:04] was silent oh my just shows it's from
[1:03:09] God I see what he's telling he sound
[1:03:10] this is it wasn't it his other eleven
[1:03:13] hundred and fifty something sermons
[1:03:15] wasn't from God
[1:03:16] but this is what's his job this was what
[1:03:19] he was sent to do this was his job
[1:03:22] revelation 10 7 - take this and open
[1:03:25] these mysteries of these seven seals all
[1:03:27] right it fits exactly in the promises of
[1:03:31] God from the end of the message you
[1:03:34] notice now now notice now for the end of
[1:03:37] time message this seal
[1:03:41] after all he's revealed all the six
[1:03:44] seals but it don't say nothing about the
[1:03:47] seventh and the end time seal that's
[1:03:52] what the Seventh Seal is it's the end
[1:03:54] time seal no one else has had to deal
[1:03:58] with the seal like you and I are dealing
[1:04:01] with them now no one has had to produce
[1:04:04] Christ in human flesh like we're gonna
[1:04:08] have to all right but they don't say
[1:04:10] nothing about the seventh and the end
[1:04:12] time seal when it starts will be
[1:04:17] absolutely a total secret according to
[1:04:20] the Bible so see now everybody's going
[1:04:23] to put they put a it's on this it's on
[1:04:29] this it's on this what do you say it
[1:04:35] will be absolutely a total secret
[1:04:38] according to the Bible listen folks
[1:04:42] we're going to leave this world and
[1:04:43] nobody's gonna know we're going this
[1:04:46] whole world you know what this world's
[1:04:48] just gonna keep on going this ain't this
[1:04:49] is not like the movie was left behind
[1:04:55] everybody see everybody knows that was
[1:04:57] left behind I mean you know what they
[1:05:00] have the first scene you know in cars
[1:05:01] are all banging together and airplanes
[1:05:04] are falling out of the sky because
[1:05:05] everybody's going into rapture oh yes
[1:05:07] all but pieces of them all the parts of
[1:05:08] them but yes it's not it's gonna be a
[1:05:10] total secret even though even the
[1:05:13] resurrection is going to be a total
[1:05:14] secret we're the only ones that's going
[1:05:18] to know what's going on there's your
[1:05:21] seal is that it's sealed to the world
[1:05:23] but open to you hey man it your
[1:05:27] you're sealed up as an individual you're
[1:05:29] sealed until the day of your Redemption
[1:05:31] all right so this is now the end time
[1:05:35] seal when it starts will be absolutely a
[1:05:39] total secret according to the Bible it
[1:05:43] says at the end of the seventh angels
[1:05:45] message all the mysteries will be known
[1:05:46] we're at the end time the opening of the
[1:05:50] seventh seal so so you see what I'm
[1:05:52] saying the seventh seal is not some
[1:05:53] event brother Ram could just step out
[1:05:55] and say all right this is what it is he
[1:05:58] didn't show me read the whole Seventh
[1:06:00] Seal book he never said this is what it
[1:06:02] is there's a few times in there that
[1:06:04] we're gonna deal with that brother
[1:06:05] branham said it's not open it's not
[1:06:11] revealed itself yet he says right here
[1:06:13] if it's the endtime seal when it starts
[1:06:15] will be absolutely a total secret
[1:06:18] according to the Bible thereby okay with
[1:06:21] that amen
[1:06:23] it will be a total secret and it says
[1:06:26] it's opened in a three-fold manner and
[1:06:29] he spoke of a fold of it so we're gonna
[1:06:31] get into all that later I just wanted
[1:06:33] you to see what to see was this seal is
[1:06:35] probably the most uneventful seal in all
[1:06:38] the seal series because number one
[1:06:41] everybody's you can draw you know horses
[1:06:43] and hey look we can take that my book my
[1:06:45] thing up here you can put horse one two
[1:06:47] three four five once it's before then
[1:06:49] five and six and you can draw all these
[1:06:51] things but what would be on this board
[1:06:55] if I read what the double seal was it'd
[1:07:00] be empty it'd be empty there'd be
[1:07:05] nothing to go on except a redemption of
[1:07:08] Israel and that's not our seventh seal
[1:07:10] that's not what we need to be talking
[1:07:12] about we got to get out of here before
[1:07:14] he can go to Israel but that board would
[1:07:17] be completely blank but you know as that
[1:07:21] board is completely blank you're sitting
[1:07:24] here today with a life that you've lived
[1:07:27] in God forever how many years it doesn't
[1:07:28] matter if it's one or fifty and you have
[1:07:32] a story to tell you have a story to tell
[1:07:35] but you know what I can't write it on
[1:07:37] that board you're gonna have to come up
[1:07:39] here and write it on that board
[1:07:41] you're gonna have to come up here and
[1:07:43] ride it on this board I can't ride it so
[1:07:45] for you you're gonna have to ride it for
[1:07:47] yourself maybe that'll help you in a
[1:07:50] little while we'll understand something
[1:07:51] about this that my seal so now as I was
[1:07:56] sitting yesterday thinking about some
[1:07:58] things I thought you know what there's
[1:08:01] all kind of numerology in the Bible so I
[1:08:04] just started looking up the number seven
[1:08:06] so let's see what brother Brown says
[1:08:08] about the number seven and then we'll
[1:08:10] look at it
[1:08:11] some of you can pull it up online but I
[1:08:13] got it over there for you I'm gonna hand
[1:08:14] it out you know reason I didn't hand it
[1:08:15] out to you a few minutes ago or an hour
[1:08:17] ago because you'd be sitting there
[1:08:19] reading it and you wouldn't be listen to
[1:08:20] what I was saying so anyway I probably
[1:08:23] should to give it out so you kept you
[1:08:24] awake
[1:08:28] alright let's read these quotes from
[1:08:30] brother Branham we know brother Brown
[1:08:31] said the seventh that number seven is
[1:08:34] what number seven is completely say
[1:08:38] hello won't y'all be in the message
[1:08:42] how long y'all be in the message seven
[1:08:46] is the number of completion okay okay
[1:08:52] now watch pull this one up let's just
[1:08:55] see how significant this number seven is
[1:08:57] let's just go to the first one right
[1:08:59] here watch this is what I was telling
[1:09:00] you about this morning cuz we were
[1:09:01] reading downstairs for brother Brown was
[1:09:03] talking about and I have also said about
[1:09:05] laying on of hands we should get away
[1:09:08] from that Paul says we should get away
[1:09:09] from it let's read this round here
[1:09:12] mister organ Brian said to me that
[1:09:14] number seven was already healed while I
[1:09:17] was preaching Oh huh number seven was
[1:09:23] he's calling a Prayer Line you know
[1:09:25] that's kind of strange that that bit
[1:09:27] that that audio you were listening to a
[1:09:29] few minutes ago was a prayer line I
[1:09:33] didn't orchestrate that God did brother
[1:09:38] Branham was calling numbers for a prayer
[1:09:39] line that's what he's doing around here
[1:09:41] I just cut it off because he was calling
[1:09:43] one two three four five six and brother
[1:09:46] organ Brite turns and says number seven
[1:09:48] says they've already been healed was
[1:09:52] already healed while I was preaching
[1:09:53] praise the Lord that's good that's the
[1:09:56] original way
[1:09:57] I wish Tommy Osborne if he had to come
[1:10:01] tonight that's his way of doing it Lord
[1:10:04] taught me augs Bert's doing it and we're
[1:10:06] not preaching the word and that's the
[1:10:10] way to do it preaching the word and to
[1:10:14] get healed by preaching God sent His
[1:10:18] Word and what did it do heal them that's
[1:10:20] right that's good all right so look and
[1:10:22] it's kind of strange it was number seven
[1:10:24] I don't think it was very strange but I
[1:10:27] think that's I'm just telling you what
[1:10:28] brother Branham said already healed
[1:10:30] while I was preaching now what a great
[1:10:32] thing brother Branham you know what
[1:10:33] would have thrilled him more than
[1:10:34] anything if he'd said okay number five
[1:10:37] oh you've already been healed
[1:10:39] number six oh you've already been healed
[1:10:41] number seven oh you weren't number eight
[1:10:43] you've already been healed that was what
[1:10:45] he was looking for not having the hands
[1:10:51] laid on all right now look go to the
[1:10:53] very next quote seven God's perfect
[1:10:58] number
[1:10:59] so now seven is God's perfect numbers
[1:11:02] everybody got that say ma'am alright
[1:11:04] just right down the road one two three
[1:11:06] four five six seven now let's go to the
[1:11:08] number light number these let's go to
[1:11:11] countdown now ten is a bad number but
[1:11:16] man always counts backwards next on my
[1:11:18] countdown 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 zero
[1:11:21] why does God do he starts with his
[1:11:25] number 7 that's God's number watch him 7
[1:11:29] he counts ahead starting with 1 he
[1:11:32] starts with his first church change

[1:11:56] things that we're going to look at this
[1:11:57] commentary here in just a second but 7

[1:14:07] variations that 654 now they some other
[1:14:09] people come up with other ones look at
[1:14:11] the first one seven days of creation God

[1:14:49] seven years for leah seven years for
[1:14:51] Rachel and then he worked seven more
[1:14:53] years he loved him women a lot when
[1:14:56] Jacob went to meet his brother he saw he
[1:14:58] about seven times Pharaoh had a dream

[1:15:22] their land they Sabbath everyone seven
[1:15:25] years the golden lampstand are the
[1:15:29] menorah had white seven lamps all right
[1:15:32] then you can keep reading on down
[1:15:34] through there after having a male child
[1:15:36] a woman was unclean for seven days Aaron
[1:15:38] and his sons were consecrated for seven
[1:15:40] days the day of atonement held on the
[1:15:43] seventh month you know what seventh

[1:15:47] everybody got them seventh months not
[1:15:49] July seventh month in the Jewish
[1:15:51] calendar is October because their first
[1:15:54] month is April which you say March April
[1:15:57] all right everybody got that it took
[1:15:59] seven years for Solomon to build his
[1:16:00] temple Samson had seven locks of hair

[1:16:21] the tribulation will last seven years
[1:16:24] when he'd instruct that one out
[1:16:26] proverbs mentions seven things that are
[1:16:28] abomination to God there are seven
[1:16:31] things that Jesus said one
[1:16:32] on the cross jesus healed seven times on
[1:16:35] the Sabbath Jesus fed 4000 men down at
[1:16:39] the bottom of the page with seven loaves
[1:16:40] of bread and a few fishes and after
[1:16:42] everyone ate there was seven baskets
[1:16:44] full left over Jesus said to forgive
[1:16:48] seventy times seven Mary Magdalene had
[1:16:52] seven demons and it was made seven years
[1:16:55] when her husband died
[1:16:56] finally the Book of Revelations contains
[1:16:59] the most use of the number seven in the
[1:17:02] New Testament 53 times in here let's
[1:17:05] read them right here churches there were
[1:17:07] seven churches seven spirits seven
[1:17:09] golden candlesticks seven stars seven
[1:17:12] lamps you know what the world this guy
[1:17:14] right here the world does not know the
[1:17:18] significance of this but we do we know
[1:17:23] exactly who them churches are we know
[1:17:26] exactly who those seven spirits are we
[1:17:29] know exactly what the candlesticks mean
[1:17:31] we know what the Stars are that the
[1:17:34] messengers and we've even got their name
[1:17:37] Paul Iranians Martin club of Luther
[1:17:40] Wesley brother Brett right this man
[1:17:44] doesn't he's just telling you they're
[1:17:46] seven in the Bible and what I'm telling
[1:17:48] you is since you're the mystery
[1:17:51] you're looking at these sevens going I
[1:17:53] know what that is I know what that type
[1:17:55] is have you not been doing that if
[1:17:56] you've not been doing that you didn't go
[1:17:58] back read again
[1:17:59] if you've not done it go back and read
[1:18:00] again said man I know what that types I
[1:18:02] remember what brother Brahm said about
[1:18:03] this I remember this I remember this see
[1:18:06] folks that's the seal that you're sealed
[1:18:08] with you're sealed with this message
[1:18:10] knowing all these mysteries and it's
[1:18:14] coming from your brain
[1:18:15] oh yeah somebody's got to stand up here
[1:18:17] and spark your memory but look there's
[1:18:19] seven seals seven horns seven eyes we
[1:18:23] know Brooke we know exactly what that is
[1:18:25] the horns in the eyes angels trumpets
[1:18:30] thunders seven heads seven Crown's seven
[1:18:33] plagues seven vials seven mountains we
[1:18:36] know who's sitting on that one and seven
[1:18:38] kings let's go to the next one meaning
[1:18:41] of the number seven it's used 735 times
[1:18:45] 54 times
[1:18:46] the book of Revelation alone the number
[1:18:49] seven is the foundation of God's Word if
[1:18:52] we include the one where it says
[1:18:53] Sevenfold and seventh its 860 references
[1:18:57] to the number seven all right seven is
[1:19:02] the number of completeness and
[1:19:03] perfection have you ever thought about
[1:19:05] this look at me
[1:19:08] seven is what four plus three the number
[1:19:15] of redemption and the number of
[1:19:18] perfection add it together make seven
[1:19:22] anyway
[1:19:24] seven is the number of completeness and
[1:19:26] perfection both physical and spiritual
[1:19:29] it derives much of its meaning from
[1:19:32] being tied directly to God's creation of
[1:19:34] all things and look look at this you
[1:19:37] read a little bit further the Bible as a
[1:19:39] whole was originally divided into seven
[1:19:41] divisions law prophets writings or some
[1:19:45] the Gospels in acts the general epistle
[1:19:48] the Epistle of Paul and the book of
[1:19:50] revelations the total number of original
[1:19:52] inspired books was 49 or seven times
[1:19:55] seven demonstrating the absolute
[1:19:57] perfection of God's Word I just keep on
[1:20:00] going then I'm just giving over this so
[1:20:02] we'll take up so much time we can go
[1:20:03] home in the book of Hebrews written by
[1:20:06] the Apostle Paul he uses seven titles to
[1:20:08] refer to Christ heir of all things
[1:20:10] captain of our salvation apostle author
[1:20:12] of salvation for runner high priest and
[1:20:14] the author and finisher of our faith
[1:20:16] pretty neat huh
[1:20:17] in Matthew 2:13 Jesus is quoted as
[1:20:20] giving 7 parables 7 psalms are ascribed
[1:20:23] to David in the New Testament in the
[1:20:25] Book of Revelations there are 7 church
[1:20:27] age of seven seals he goes over the
[1:20:29] scene same thing but look this huh how
[1:20:31] about the number 7 with God's annual
[1:20:33] feast days how many feast days are they
[1:20:35] seven there's not eight six five four
[1:20:38] there's seven seven feast days beginning
[1:20:42] with Passover now what does the seventh
[1:20:44] feast days do the seven feast days are
[1:20:49] the redemption of Israel those seven
[1:20:53] feast days takes them from what all the
[1:20:55] way to atone through atonement right
[1:20:58] into what Tabernacles it's taking them
[1:21:00] type
[1:21:01] Redemption their seven annual holy days
[1:21:03] beginning with Passover and ending with
[1:21:05] the last great day you know that's what
[1:21:07] that last that last number seven is
[1:21:10] called the last great day that's what
[1:21:14] we're in the last great day the cycle of
[1:21:18] the holy days is completed in three
[1:21:20] festival sessions seasons by the seventh
[1:21:24] month of the sacred calendar which is
[1:21:26] october bob was on this the other day
[1:21:28] Passover and unleavened bread the first
[1:21:30] month Pentecost the third month trumpets
[1:21:32] and atonement Tabernacles and last day
[1:21:34] is in the seventh month all right now
[1:21:38] Jesus performed all those miracles well
[1:21:39] I wanted to go get old over here and
[1:21:41] look at this this woman's got the big
[1:21:43] writing so all of you can read this this
[1:21:46] guy's not a Christian he's some kind of
[1:21:49] methodologist or something so he brings
[1:21:52] a little different view but I want you
[1:21:55] to read this but he starts off with the
[1:21:57] Bible seven appears fifty-four times
[1:22:00] within Revelations the final book of the
[1:22:02] Bible but the ground told us 7:30
[1:22:03] finally that's the same way as the other
[1:22:06] ones an example of this would be God
[1:22:08] resting on the seventh day after
[1:22:10] creating everything within the universe
[1:22:12] as we explore the Bible there were seven
[1:22:14] main sections the law the prophets we've
[1:22:16] read that before gospel journal pistol
[1:22:18] epistle Paul finally the book revelation
[1:22:20] the Apostle John gave Jesus seven titles
[1:22:22] and Jesus himself gave seven parables in
[1:22:25] Matthew 13 and perform seven miracles on
[1:22:27] the Sabbath day keep going on down a
[1:22:30] little bit further the reference to
[1:22:33] seven don't stop there there are seven
[1:22:35] holy days and of course there's no
[1:22:36] there's no forgetting the seven deadly
[1:22:38] sins this one's interesting the Star of
[1:22:42] David we call it the six point Star of
[1:22:44] David but in their tradition it's a six
[1:22:47] point Star of David but there is a
[1:22:49] center court that represents the
[1:22:54] spiritual dimension we're what somebody
[1:22:59] talking about an air core this morning
[1:23:00] okay alright so the star contains seven
[1:23:05] areas within itself some Kabbalah strap
[1:23:07] long strands of red string around the
[1:23:09] tomb of Rachel seven times before
[1:23:11] cutting it into bracelets for protection
[1:23:14] other faiths in the meaning of number
[1:23:16] seven the number seven meaning is it
[1:23:18] limits Li limited solely to the Bible
[1:23:20] for example if you take a look at
[1:23:21] Buddhism as the mother of Buddha died
[1:23:25] seven days after giving birth to her son
[1:23:27] there was also seven factors of the
[1:23:29] enlightenment and seven universal mental
[1:23:31] constant constituents within the Baha'i
[1:23:34] faith which originated and Iran is most
[1:23:36] puffery within the Middle East there are
[1:23:38] the Seven Valleys which are the seven
[1:23:39] spirits of development that one must
[1:23:42] travel through in order to reach God
[1:23:43] keep turning it over if we set separate
[1:23:47] faiths this one's neat I like this one
[1:23:48] if we separate faith in history for a
[1:23:50] moment we can find burying references to
[1:23:53] this number throughout the world for
[1:23:54] starters there are seven seas there are
[1:23:57] seven continents there are seven wonders
[1:24:00] of the world there are seven nobles will
[1:24:03] execute it in the tower green green and
[1:24:06] Tyrell I don't even know what it is but
[1:24:07] if there are seven numbers there's only
[1:24:09] seven numbers that Brett takes up the
[1:24:11] whole Roman numeral see it IV xlc DM
[1:24:16] that constitutes the whole what the end
[1:24:19] of the Roman numeral and there's also
[1:24:23] seven notes in the diatonic scale
[1:24:26] everybody know what dr. Scalea say man I
[1:24:29] didn't think you'd say Amen with
[1:24:31] somebody wait a minute who studied who
[1:24:33] studied it's the notes the diatonic
[1:24:39] scales the notes look reed FC g da e and
[1:24:44] b there's only seven notes now there's
[1:24:46] variations and I read up on this there
[1:24:49] are five whole tones or steps and there
[1:24:53] are two half steps ah about that happy
[1:25:01] Oh daddy pretty smart
[1:25:02] I knew Richard would know that of course
[1:25:06] it's not just the past that seven makes
[1:25:08] and the parents look I want you to see
[1:25:10] this so what the seven mean turned over
[1:25:12] within science mail them well the
[1:25:14] meteorological phenomenon whereby light
[1:25:17] is reflected refracted and dispersed
[1:25:20] through droplets of water also known as
[1:25:23] a rainbow that's the scientific thing
[1:25:25] that's just not just God just didn't
[1:25:27] throw that up there
[1:25:28] that's scientific create seven colors
[1:25:31] red orange yellow green blue purple and
[1:25:33] paint seven is also now this is
[1:25:36] interesting seven is also the primary
[1:25:37] number within Miller's law and then
[1:25:39] Miller was a psychologist which is an
[1:25:44] idea proposed by psychologist George
[1:25:46] Miller related to the idea that our
[1:25:48] working memory on average can hold seven
[1:25:52] plus or minus
[1:25:54] objects the original telephone number
[1:25:57] was only seven note seven digits that's
[1:26:01] why it was seven digits I looked that up
[1:26:03] again
[1:26:04] I googled it because that you didn't use
[1:26:08] area codes then you didn't have to y'all
[1:26:10] have so many older ones remember you
[1:26:11] just really just dialed the last four
[1:26:13] numbers one time right well then you had
[1:26:16] to start dialing six seven seven four
[1:26:17] six nine one why because your brain can
[1:26:20] remember up to seven items at a time hmm
[1:26:25] hmm there are seven celestial beings
[1:26:27] that are visible in space with the naked
[1:26:29] eye Mars Venus Mercury Venus Mars Venus
[1:26:31] Mercury Venus how do you do that Saturn
[1:26:34] and Sun in the moon so what does the
[1:26:36] number seven mean arguably it could be
[1:26:38] the number of power which is why appears
[1:26:40] so many times throughout history however
[1:26:43] it is also possible that number seven
[1:26:44] has significance due to how often it is
[1:26:46] mentioned within religious texts symbol
[1:26:49] of completion and perfection in every
[1:26:51] tradition angel number seven refers to
[1:26:54] the whole planetary order the whole
[1:26:55] celestial dwelling and the whole
[1:26:57] spiritual energy you know how many
[1:26:58] dimensions are there hmm Wow
[1:27:04] all right look at this this is what
[1:27:06] mm-hmm this is what he does obtaining
[1:27:09] when add adding three a celestial symbol
[1:27:12] of Trinity which we know that's not true
[1:27:13] but we know three is what brother Graham
[1:27:15] said three is what perfection God is
[1:27:19] perfected in Father Son Holy Ghost he's
[1:27:20] not he's not divided okay and then the
[1:27:24] four cardinal points are terrestrial
[1:27:26] material materiality which is what our
[1:27:28] Redemption the number seven is also the
[1:27:31] symbol of the union between the sky and
[1:27:32] the earth consequently it is omnipresent
[1:27:36] in your life there are seven days in a
[1:27:39] week there are seven colors in there
[1:27:42] seven numbers in the night on a scale
[1:27:44] there are seven seer centers of energy
[1:27:46] and yoga there are seven planets and
[1:27:49] traditional astrology and also one I
[1:27:51] want to give you there are seven cycles
[1:27:54] there are seven year cycles in your life
[1:28:00] that's how important it seven is you
[1:28:02] look right these numbers that well just
[1:28:04] look when you turn seven think about
[1:28:07] things that happen the next one's 14 now
[1:28:12] think about this change in your life 21
[1:28:16] 28 35 42 I've lost a lot of you there 49
[1:28:28] 56 I'm getting close mine's gonna be in
[1:28:32] sick at 63 so 63 there's 56 63 70 77
[1:28:37] dad's missed his by two years mama this
[1:28:40] is yours
[1:28:41] you'd be 77 huh whoa this would be mom's
[1:28:45] mom 7 7 7 7 goodness and 84 but there
[1:28:50] are servants there are seven-year cycles
[1:28:52] in your life so that's number 7 the
[1:28:54] reason I read all this is to give you an
[1:28:56] idea that that's why God that's why
[1:28:57] there's seven seals closest the number 7
[1:29:01] is important the 7 number 7 is
[1:29:03] completion and it also refers if you'll
[1:29:06] keep reading to the heavens there are 7
[1:29:08] heavens where the Angelica order resides
[1:29:10] and where the Archangels are Prince's
[1:29:12] there are seven is the embodiment of
[1:29:15] divine perfection isn't the world was
[1:29:17] created in seven days now this one right
[1:29:20] here we're going to end on this now we
[1:29:23] know that number seven is always
[1:29:25] considered a lucky number in the world
[1:29:28] you know you hit the jackpot seven seven
[1:29:32] seven right okay but now watch this when
[1:29:36] taking a closer look the number seven
[1:29:37] quickly becomes initiation number a
[1:29:41] mysterious number here's an example and
[1:29:45] there is a couple of examples of math
[1:29:46] that's some kind of a primary number
[1:29:48] that you can't I didn't get in left
[1:29:50] here's an example each lunar cycle that
[1:29:53] ladies we know what that 28-day cycle is
[1:29:55] but
[1:29:55] we know the moon cycle is also it every
[1:29:58] 28 days the moon goes from full to dark
[1:30:01] but did you know they were if that was
[1:30:03] four sevens four sevens is 28 now to
[1:30:10] become initiated and open the door to
[1:30:12] the mystery add 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4
[1:30:17] plus 5 plus 6 and plus 7 you get 28 when
[1:30:24] you add one two three four five six
[1:30:26] seven together to each other you get 28
[1:30:31] strange huh that's what the guy said
[1:30:33] strength no it's not strange that number
[1:30:35] seven is a perfect number and it but you
[1:30:38] know you say it's an odd number because
[1:30:40] it's seven you know it's seven but seven
[1:30:43] is our whole life was evolved around
[1:30:45] seven you got seven days in a week the
[1:30:48] reason we come to church today because
[1:30:50] it's the first day of the week yesterday
[1:30:52] was the seventh all the Seventh day
[1:30:55] Adventists went to church that day but
[1:30:58] the Seventh Seal then is what it's very
[1:31:02] important that number seven is
[1:31:03] completeness and perfection together it
[1:31:06] is intertwined with the number three and
[1:31:09] the number four as we were looking at
[1:31:11] the four horse riders and we were
[1:31:13] looking at what lion ox man and eagle
[1:31:16] we're looking at redemption and
[1:31:18] perfection so we're going to be
[1:31:20] perfected that number seven is going to
[1:31:22] give us a lot of meaning let's stand to
[1:31:25] our feet as we go further I just want
[1:31:30] you to see what just and you might have
[1:31:33] some other things you can look online at
[1:31:35] with just a few things I picked up last
[1:31:36] night about the number seven God loves
[1:31:43] the number seven so we should love the
[1:31:46] number seven but now remember we as
[1:31:53] Christians we passed that we live in an
[1:31:59] eight
[1:32:01] but we're in a seven we're in this
[1:32:05] cycles of seven sevens and sevens and
[1:32:08] sevens but we are in the eighth day
[1:32:11] spiritually we're in the eighth day
[1:32:13] spiritually but we it takes those seven
[1:32:16] seals it takes those seals to put us in
[1:32:19] the future home which is the eighth day
[1:32:23] all the other all the other y'all gonna

[1:32:51] silence in heaven for the space of a
[1:32:54] half an hour

[1:37:44] Christ that we're talking about the

[1:38:11] he delivered it to us and then he left
[1:38:15] Moses delivered it to Joshua and he left
[1:38:18] God delivered it to us and he left but
[1:38:23] remember he didn't leave he came right
[1:38:26] back and went inside of you so that we
[1:38:29] can understand this message not the
[1:38:33] print not the print the live message
[1:38:38] that to me that's what that Seventh Seal
[1:38:40] is gonna do it's gonna take us from
[1:38:42] looking at events

[1:38:49] silence in heaven nothing moved no event
[1:38:54] but it's the greatest event that ever
[1:38:56] was in the world is that God's dealing
