[0:42] patience we're talking about patient
[0:44] but uh like i said we i was kind of
[0:46] meditating yesterday on uh
[0:48] on thoughts so let's get through here
[0:50] second peter 1 3
[0:52] according as his divine power has given
[0:54] unto us all things that pertain to life
[0:56] and godliness
[0:57] through the knowledge of him that have
[0:58] called us to glory and virtue
[1:01] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:03] great and precious promises that by
[1:05] these you might be partakers of the
[1:07] divine nature having escaped the
[1:08] corruption that is in the world through
[1:10] lust
[1:11] and besides this in other words besides
[1:13] your new birth
[1:16] right well that's what it says having
[1:17] the divine nature so besides having a
[1:19] new birth
[1:20] giving all diligence add these things to
[1:23] your new birth all right
[1:25] add to your faith virtue and divert your
[1:26] knowledge knowledge temperance
[1:28] temperance patience we've already been
[1:29] through those
[1:31] into patience godliness now we'll stop
[1:33] there
[1:34] and we're talking about patience
[1:37] and the bible says in patience possess
[1:39] you your soul and we'll read in just a
[1:41] few minutes but remember the word
[1:42] patient means enduring
[1:45] perseverance
[1:47] in other words it's not something that's
[1:48] going to come quickly
[1:50] it's something that's going to come over
[1:52] time and god's going to test us and test
[1:54] us and test us but how is he going to
[1:56] test us he's going to test us through
[1:58] the devil or through his little minions
[2:00] or through his little
[2:02] i was thinking yesterday i thought
[2:04] and this is no
[2:05] this
[2:06] this should not be something that we
[2:08] talk about in the message
[2:10] but
[2:11] you know to be an overcomer
[2:13] brother brown said coming to church
[2:15] you're an overcomer
[2:16] so if you don't come to church you're
[2:17] not an overcomer
[2:19] he said well i'm going to stay home and
[2:20] watch because i
[2:22] because i had a long day you're not an
[2:24] overcomer an overcomer is somebody to
[2:26] those that overcome in the book of
[2:27] revelation that's one thing about in the
[2:29] book of revelations to those that
[2:31] overcome your give these but if you're
[2:33] but not
[2:34] if you're not you're not going to get
[2:35] that right
[2:38] you say well i can overcome at home say
[2:40] no
[2:41] no you can't overcome at home
[2:43] you overcome by the things you overcome
[2:46] to get here
[2:47] i don't have no gas money ain't got no
[2:49] time i ain't got this right now the
[2:52] bible didn't stipulate
[2:54] did it
[2:56] it says for satan not to assembling
[2:57] yourself together and the bible says and
[3:00] more as you see the day approaching the
[3:02] problem is a lot of y'all
[3:05] and people in the message must not see
[3:07] the day approaching
[3:08] because do you come to church more than
[3:10] you used to if you don't you're part of
[3:12] that group
[3:14] i'm sorry
[3:15] but to overcome
[3:17] overcoming means you get here
[3:20] and you persevere that's what we're
[3:22] talking about patience
[3:24] we're persevering oh i can't do this
[3:26] look at bob he works till five o'clock
[3:28] in the afternoon in downtown atlanta
[3:32] now if anybody's got an excuse he does
[3:34] and sometimes maybe the things don't run
[3:36] right and and all that but i'm talking
[3:38] about sometimes
[3:40] i'm talking about i ain't talking about
[3:41] something i'm coming all the time
[3:43] see we got you know people can't make it
[3:45] on wednesday night why i got work i got
[3:48] bob comes from downtown atlanta
[3:50] at five o'clock
[3:52] gets on a bus
[3:54] rides it to marta
[3:56] gets on the marta bus
[3:58] meets monica somewhere at the marta
[4:00] station
[4:01] she fixes his lunch or supper he eats it
[4:05] on the way up here
[4:06] see that's overcoming you know what
[4:08] god's gonna bless him but some of you
[4:09] live eight and ten miles from here can't
[4:11] get a church on wednesday night what's
[4:12] your problem
[4:14] what's your problem
[4:17] sorry
[4:18] come on sunday morning we got people to
[4:20] get filled up on sunday morning now they
[4:21] just become denominational message
[4:24] believers
[4:25] sorry
[4:27] because the bible says impatience
[4:29] possess you your soul
[4:31] impatience
[4:33] right that's right
[4:34] impatience bob is patient because he
[4:37] knows at five o'clock he's going to get
[4:38] off he's not going to be nervous about
[4:40] it sure he wants to try to get to church
[4:42] but remember brother brown i'm told that
[4:44] guy said he said you had a i saw you had
[4:46] a real rough time getting to service do
[4:47] you have a fight from a time
[4:49] and the guy said i just got in the car
[4:51] and come to church
[4:52] but it was all the external things that
[4:54] maybe the guy had to handle before he
[4:56] went out the door
[4:58] or the devils that was trying to you
[4:59] know do this or do that i've always said
[5:02] that
[5:02] that we must prepare perseverance means
[5:05] to if i got to get him go to work every
[5:07] morning
[5:09] as far as i know i've never been late
[5:10] for work
[5:11] because i get up before i'm supposed to
[5:13] get up
[5:15] but i see that and you say well that's
[5:16] not your nature no i had to train myself
[5:19] to do that
[5:20] i had to be an overcomer
[5:24] on saturday sometimes i sleep till eight
[5:25] o'clock and that to me that's
[5:27] a wasted day
[5:30] isn't it jim tell them i mean i'm uh way
[5:32] before she gets up or stirs or whatever
[5:34] but that's okay
[5:36] she needs her rest for dealing with me
[5:38] all week
[5:39] so that's a rest time
[5:41] but
[5:43] impatience possess you your soul
[5:47] so you've got to do it
[5:49] you've got to decide i don't care how i
[5:51] feel i'm coming to church
[5:53] i don't care if
[5:54] i don't have enough gas money god will
[5:56] provide gas money that's right
[5:58] but you know what he's not he's not
[6:00] obligated for you to sit home
[6:02] and worry about the gas money get up and
[6:04] do something get up and go get up and
[6:06] yeah hey how many of you really felt
[6:09] like getting up and coming to church
[6:10] this morning
[6:12] one or two or three
[6:14] but not everybody
[6:20] how you gonna overcome
[6:22] you overcame something by getting up and
[6:24] coming to church
[6:25] and you've dedicated this day to the
[6:27] lord i hope you do that i hope you
[6:28] dedicate this day to the lord not that
[6:30] you just gotta come to church because
[6:31] brother dale's gonna tell you if you
[6:32] don't come to church you're going to
[6:33] hell right that's right you understand
[6:35] what i mean
[6:37] and brother i'm not going to tell you
[6:38] that but
[6:40] that love letter between the lines will
[6:41] tell you if you don't come to church
[6:42] what are you
[6:45] you're not patient you're not
[6:46] persevering that's word here sustaining
[6:51] i come to church every wednesday night
[6:54] how many of you know i missed one
[6:56] in 14 years one wednesday night
[6:59] something happened at work and i had to
[7:00] leave and go and i couldn't didn't get
[7:02] here but you know what i came here after
[7:03] i got finished one sunday morning i
[7:05] didn't get here to a service starting
[7:07] that's two times in 15 years now that
[7:09] that's life
[7:11] stuff's going to happen in life two
[7:12] times in 15 years
[7:14] but 15 times in a month
[7:18] we got a problem
[7:21] right
[7:22] 15 times in a month we got a problem oh
[7:24] yeah
[7:28] but look if we don't have
[7:31] these virtues
[7:33] you're not going to take a body change
[7:36] and it starts with the simplicity
[7:38] of being born again
[7:40] and
[7:42] persevering
[7:44] persevering be of a long spirit and i
[7:46] haven't read some of these be of a long
[7:48] spirit not to lose heart that's our
[7:51] problem we lose heart we we by tuesday
[7:54] we say you start preparing not to come
[7:56] on wednesday why you lose heart you you
[7:59] don't listen you don't believe god's
[8:01] going to meet you
[8:02] how many times have i told you i've been
[8:03] preaching i said look god tells you when
[8:05] he's going to be here
[8:08] he's going to be here at 10 and at 2 on
[8:09] sunday he's going to be here at 7 00 on
[8:11] wednesday night
[8:12] remember what he said we're two or three
[8:14] or gathered in my name there i'll be in
[8:15] the midst so you know god's going to be
[8:16] here if there's two or three people here
[8:18] if you miss that
[8:20] you've missed the visitation of god
[8:23] that's how i feel about church
[8:25] and i'm not dog and i am dogmatic about
[8:27] going to church christians don't brother
[8:28] brown said christians go to church
[8:31] can't wait for the doors to open
[8:33] to get to church all right and i know
[8:35] there's life and i know this thing's
[8:37] happening i'm talking about it in the
[8:38] long run have long patience bear long
[8:41] suffer long be long suffering
[8:44] patiently endure
[8:46] to persevere patiently and bravely
[8:50] in enduring misfortunes and troubles
[8:52] that's how your patience is going to be
[8:54] tried right
[8:56] that you don't have gas money to get
[8:58] here that your car won't work or you got
[9:00] to get another car
[9:01] or or you did have to work till 5 15
[9:04] instead of 5 o'clock
[9:06] and you got to rush to get here
[9:08] and i know some people say well i had
[9:10] such a bad spirit i didn't want to come
[9:11] to church now you're going to take that
[9:12] bad spirit home with you and you're
[9:14] going to sleep with it
[9:16] this is where you're going to get
[9:17] delivered from that bad amen
[9:19] that's right i'm going to preach this
[9:20] morning
[9:21] amen
[9:22] this is where you get rid of that stuff
[9:25] you get rid of that bad spirit here if
[9:26] you get a bad spirit say well i'm not
[9:28] coming to church guess what that bad
[9:29] spirit guess what it's done
[9:32] that's right
[9:33] i've done my job
[9:35] and satan gives him a
[9:38] flame of fire or some coal or something
[9:40] i don't know give him something
[9:44] to persevere patiently be patient and
[9:47] burying the offenses and injuries of
[9:50] others
[9:54] to be mild and slow to punish
[9:59] now let's go to luke 24 let's read some
[10:01] of these scriptures again because
[10:02] there's one i want to talk on this
[10:04] morning besides the one that says in
[10:06] your patience possess you your soul
[10:08] now listen your soul is what we're
[10:10] talking about
[10:13] right it starts in the soul
[10:16] if the soul has a desire the body's
[10:18] going to walk right into that desire is
[10:20] that correct
[10:21] all right
[10:22] luke 21 17.
[10:25] sorry i didn't have it up on the screen
[10:26] y'all have to do the old-fashioned way
[10:28] luke 21-17
[10:32] 21-17
[10:35] and you shall be hated of all men for my
[10:37] name's sake but there shall not a hair
[10:40] of your head perish
[10:42] in your patience possess you your soul
[10:46] all right
[10:48] in your patience patience is very
[10:51] important
[10:53] therefore be romans 5. now let's go to
[10:55] romans 5 1.
[10:59] we're going to talk about one here but
[11:00] probably stop in just a minute talk
[11:02] about it
[11:03] all right
[11:08] but think about that over go read those
[11:10] overcomers i'm i'm working on something
[11:12] in my head i haven't got it on paper yet
[11:15] with these overcomings tied to
[11:17] the statue of a perfect man and tied to
[11:19] the seal so
[11:22] remember there's eight overcomings did
[11:23] everybody know that
[11:25] he said now there's only seven church
[11:26] agents go to revelations 21.
[11:29] there's one more
[11:30] he that'll overcome it
[11:32] because that says all things
[11:34] all right
[11:35] okay
[11:36] so we're in revelations when the city
[11:38] comes down you know john sees the holy
[11:39] city and everything's done and locked in
[11:42] and he says to them that overcome us
[11:45] number eight there's seven in the church
[11:46] ages but there's one more just saying
[11:48] here one two three four five six seven
[11:51] eight
[11:52] that's eight overcomings right there
[11:55] faith virtue faith virtue knowledge
[11:57] temperance patience godliness brotherly
[11:59] kindness and love
[12:02] that's eight hates the number of what
[12:04] eternity
[12:05] all right so we are we are creatures if
[12:07] you were in a bible study last night i
[12:09] hope you understood what we were talking
[12:10] about
[12:11] there is a
[12:14] there's not a difference but there's a
[12:15] difference
[12:16] between this church age and all the
[12:18] other churches yes
[12:19] okay all the other church ages had the
[12:22] holy ghost they had the token they have
[12:23] the new bark they had some of these
[12:25] virtues working in their life but when
[12:27] brother brown says the end time message
[12:29] is a token and the token only came in
[12:31] the end time a lot of people think well
[12:32] nobody had a new birth from now no it's
[12:34] just that we have the fullness
[12:37] of the new birth
[12:38] so brother branham come brother brown
[12:40] never came on this earth to change the
[12:42] new birth
[12:44] you get the new birth the same way
[12:45] martin luther got the new birth
[12:47] yes
[12:48] brother brown didn't come to change the
[12:50] new birth he didn't come to change the
[12:51] bible right
[12:53] but he came to take what was laying on
[12:54] that pages of the bible that martin
[12:56] luther read many times probably in in
[12:58] peter about add to your faith virtue and
[13:00] all his temper but see it didn't it it
[13:03] didn't come alive to him it wasn't
[13:04] quitting to him
[13:06] or he wouldn't smoke a pot and drink a
[13:08] beer in a pub
[13:10] but the just shall live by faith is what
[13:11] god wanted for that time that's what the
[13:13] people could understand for that time so
[13:15] now here we are to where the brotherhood
[13:17] says the token only came in the end time
[13:19] the token to get us the body chain
[13:21] that's right to get us out of here the
[13:23] full
[13:24] course meal which is eight
[13:26] manifestations of god like brother dale
[13:28] and and i've been preached for many many
[13:30] years on the eight manifestations of god
[13:33] and you know what i that's a a pretty
[13:35] popular sermon that i preach out in the
[13:37] out in when i go preach and
[13:40] and a lot of people understand it a lot
[13:41] of people don't
[13:43] but uh i've been speaking on it for
[13:45] years but if you don't see the eight
[13:46] manifestations of god
[13:48] then you will die and go by the grave
[13:50] because seven is completion but seven is
[13:53] not eternity seven you're still in time
[13:56] time doesn't take a rapture
[14:00] eternity takes a rapture
[14:02] so we have to have the eight
[14:03] manifestations of god here working in
[14:06] our life before we take a body change
[14:09] all right
[14:10] so romans five verse one so when we uh
[14:13] when brother dale preaches he preaches
[14:15] two levels
[14:17] everybody needs the new birth we got
[14:19] young people everybody needs a new birth
[14:20] so the new birth has got to be prevalent
[14:22] on your mind but the ones that have the
[14:24] new birth need to add to
[14:27] add
[14:28] two what you already have add two
[14:34] everybody understand what i'm saying
[14:35] brother brown's the same way he'll tell
[14:37] you he'll say he'll say luther had a dip
[14:39] of the holy ghost
[14:40] well hey
[14:42] then he goes to the not at that time but
[14:44] he goes to
[14:45] another illustration and he says if you
[14:47] take a dip out of the ocean
[14:50] it's a very minute piece of the ocean a
[14:52] teaspoon out of billions and billions of
[14:54] gallons but it has the same substance
[14:57] that's right of the ocean so if you've
[15:00] got a teaspoon of the new birth or a
[15:02] spot of the new birth it's the same new
[15:03] birth
[15:05] they come on the day of pentecost okay
[15:07] now you have to understand the day of
[15:09] pentecost there was two comings of the
[15:10] new birth
[15:13] 120 in the upper room had been tutored
[15:15] by jesus he was the word he he spoke the
[15:18] word to him they remembered what he said
[15:20] they took what he said so peter could
[15:22] say add to your faith virtue but now
[15:24] when peter goes outside and speaks to
[15:26] the 3000 downstairs they're just babies
[15:29] that's right they're just going what
[15:30] must be do we do to be saved
[15:33] peter said repent that's right and be
[15:35] baptized in the name of jesus christ and
[15:37] you shall receive the gift of the holy
[15:38] ghost and the bible says three thousand
[15:39] souls were added well they didn't have
[15:41] virtue knowledge temperatures godless
[15:43] brother and kindness
[15:46] they were beginning to develop into that
[15:49] but they didn't have it like the 120 in
[15:51] the upper room because the 120th like i
[15:54] said had been tutored by the word
[15:55] himself so that's you and i
[15:57] we become babies downstairs down at the
[16:00] bottom
[16:01] the 3000 that's how we all started
[16:04] right
[16:05] because we only get birth by the word
[16:07] that we hear
[16:09] that's why i said these ads are a birth
[16:12] as you hear more of word you get more
[16:15] virtue as you hear more word you get
[16:17] more knowledge you get more temperaments
[16:19] you get more patience
[16:20] um we read the scripture i think last
[16:23] night about the young sister but there's
[16:25] a there's a i was reading somewhere i
[16:27] believe it was in
[16:28] galatians or philippians or timothy or
[16:30] somewhere where he's talking about the
[16:32] bishop people like that
[16:34] he's talking about the younger ones
[16:36] don't don't give the word to a novice in
[16:38] other words don't don't don't don't take
[16:41] a deacon that's
[16:42] uh say that brother danny just been born
[16:44] again a week ago and he's excited and
[16:46] he's got you know he gets born again but
[16:49] don't make him a deacon yet right
[16:52] he's not seasoned he's got to be
[16:54] seasoned a little bit he
[16:55] you know after about three or four years
[16:58] you have to judge that
[16:59] well see
[17:00] that's why god same way with patience we
[17:02] must have patients
[17:04] even with the babbling babies
[17:07] babies make mistakes
[17:09] babies fall but listen everybody sitting
[17:11] in this room right here ain't babies
[17:13] that's right
[17:14] you've been in this thing a while so if
[17:16] you make a mistake there's two things
[17:18] you either lost or you backslid one to
[17:20] two okay okay that's right you be born
[17:23] again and be backslidden
[17:25] don't let that bother you you can
[17:27] because brother brown said we backslide
[17:28] every day
[17:30] and i ask god every night
[17:32] i said god forgive me for backsliding
[17:34] and i don't exactly say backsliding
[17:35] sometimes but forgive me for for the
[17:37] things i do against you
[17:40] because just being this is contrary to
[17:42] god that's right i mean i don't
[17:43] apologize for being human he knows that
[17:46] but i apologize for my human ways
[17:48] that my reactions and my actions and
[17:50] reactions so we're not going to get
[17:51] finished with this romans 5 1 therefore
[17:53] being justified by faith we have peace
[17:56] with god now peace is patience
[18:01] peace is patience
[18:02] okay
[18:03] you understand that that's what peace is
[18:05] patience
[18:06] if you're all jittery and nervous now is
[18:08] that peaceful no
[18:09] peaceful is knowing that like when god
[18:12] shows you something
[18:13] like dad did about me or dad did about
[18:15] the other night you know he talked last
[18:17] night about that scripture in in
[18:19] deuteronomy once you get a revelation
[18:21] and once that cog kind of clicks over
[18:23] into that place
[18:26] well that's not a devil in hell gonna
[18:27] drive you away from it now they're gonna
[18:29] come and try to that's right
[18:31] punch that
[18:33] but when you have peace
[18:35] that means you got patience
[18:37] okay
[18:38] these peace accords and he's trying to
[18:39] get peace
[18:40] what was jimmy carter trying to do he's
[18:42] trying to get look be patient be patient
[18:44] with each other let's come together and
[18:46] shake i know we've got differences but
[18:47] let's shake that's peace so watch
[18:50] therefore being justified by faith we
[18:51] have peace with god through our lord
[18:54] jesus christ by whom also we have access
[18:57] by faith
[18:59] bottom of the pyramid
[19:00] into this grace wherein we stand
[19:03] a statue of a perfect man and rejoice in
[19:06] hope of the glory of god
[19:08] and not only also
[19:11] but with glory and tribulation also
[19:14] good side bad side it's going to be
[19:16] tribulation but watch knowing the
[19:18] tribulation work at patience
[19:20] all right and patience
[19:22] experience and experience hope look at
[19:25] the three things patience experience and
[19:27] hope all right so now let's go to
[19:29] hebrews 6.
[19:32] because i want to get to something
[19:36] here hebrews 6 11.
[19:46] and we desire that every one of you do
[19:48] show the same diligence and what
[19:51] patience
[19:52] diligence what is diligence
[19:55] going to the end
[19:56] be diligent
[19:58] to the full assurance of hope and to the
[20:00] end
[20:00] they be not slow for just what i was
[20:03] talking about
[20:04] but followers of them who through faith
[20:06] and patience inherit the promise
[20:10] and joshua had a promise
[20:12] he said cross jordan god did and said
[20:15] possess the land now joshua didn't just
[20:17] walk over jordan and people just fell
[20:19] over dead
[20:22] he fought for every inch of ground
[20:23] that's right now sure he didn't lose the
[20:25] man until then came into camp but still
[20:27] he had five that's right he had to
[20:29] prepare his army he had put him in
[20:30] position he had to say go get these ice
[20:32] go get this side go get that ice all
[20:34] right
[20:35] so you and i have a
[20:37] have a uh
[20:38] a part to play in this through patience
[20:40] inherit the promises
[20:42] for when god made promise to abraham
[20:45] because he could swear by no greater he
[20:47] swear by himself saying surely blessing
[20:49] i will bless thee and multiply and i'll
[20:51] multiply thee so after
[20:56] after he had patiently endured now god
[20:59] knew what he was going to do god had
[21:00] already given the promise
[21:04] remember i told him that
[21:06] brother gerald's last weekend
[21:10] this is not written for god
[21:13] he knows what's going to happen this is
[21:16] written for our admonition because we
[21:18] don't know what tomorrow's going to be
[21:20] so this is not pulling anything over on
[21:23] god this is not some new thing to god
[21:25] he wrote this before the foundation of
[21:27] the world amen he always had it here he
[21:29] was just waiting for us to develop
[21:31] patience

[22:02] he could swear by no greater swear by
[22:04] himself
[22:05] saying surely blessing i will bless thee
[22:07] and multiply i'll multiply thee and so
[22:10] after he had patiently endured he

[24:25] be patient therefore brethren well right
[24:27] there he starts
[24:29] be patient
[24:31] unto the coming of the lord behold the
[24:33] husbandman waiteth for the precious
[24:34] fruit of the earth in other words he's
[24:36] waiting on us who's the husbandman
[24:38] christ
[24:39] right right watch the fruit of the earth
[24:44] us um
[24:46] so
[24:47] christ is waiting on us
[24:49] that's right and have long patience for
[24:52] it
[24:53] until receive the early and latter rain
[24:55] now what's the form of rain
[25:00] what's the latter rain
[25:02] harvest
[25:03] all right former is teaching
[25:06] or planting
[25:07] the latter rain is the rain in october
[25:09] before the harvest
[25:11] time comes all right
[25:13] you have a plant man and a harvest moon
[25:14] and all things work together in nature
[25:17] but it's also the same way with you and
[25:18] i right but look have long patience for
[25:22] it until he receive the early and latter
[25:25] rain there's a promise to you that if
[25:27] you're patient
[25:28] you're going to see you're going to get
[25:30] the word sewn down but it's not going to
[25:32] be that the word's just sewn down
[25:35] he's going to harvest
[25:37] what's in your field
[25:40] now the harvest is what the rapture is
[25:42] right
[25:43] but you only rapture or you only harvest
[25:47] mature grain
[25:49] like dad's been preaching to the the
[25:51] corn of wheat or or the wheat comes up
[25:54] like this
[25:55] you go out to your garden and you say
[25:56] man i got i got wheat let's just go and
[25:58] harvest it
[26:00] no you're going to get just two little
[26:01] wilted leaves
[26:03] then you get a stock that comes up well
[26:05] boy there it is no that's not there yet
[26:07] but it is got life in it that's right it
[26:10] has the life in it right but when that
[26:12] thing comes out to the grain and you see
[26:14] the grain you say oh that's the grain no
[26:16] that's not the grain that's the shot
[26:17] okay all right
[26:19] that's the shuck
[26:21] got life in it because what's inside of
[26:23] that is it's nurturing what's inside of
[26:26] it
[26:27] then the shuck pulls away and there's
[26:30] your grain again well now that grain's
[26:32] got to dry it's got to lay before the
[26:34] presence of the sun you've got to have
[26:35] patience but right here at this to me
[26:37] this is a
[26:39] this is the promise until he received
[26:41] the former and latter rain let me say it
[26:43] that way
[26:45] or the teaching
[26:46] rain or the sowing of the rent or the
[26:48] sowing rain or and the harvest rain so
[26:50] this patience is going to carry us from
[26:52] our new birth right to our body change
[26:54] or to the rapture be ye also patient
[26:59] establish your hearts for the coming of
[27:01] the lord draweth nine now that was two
[27:02] thousand years ago
[27:04] how much more now is the lord drawing
[27:06] now
[27:08] so like i said for saying not assembling
[27:10] yourself together
[27:12] and much more as you see the day
[27:14] approaches
[27:16] some people just can't see that they
[27:17] approach them
[27:18] be ye also patient
[27:21] establish your hearts in other words
[27:23] grounded
[27:24] settled
[27:26] don't be swept away in other words by
[27:28] every wind or doctrine for the coming of
[27:29] the lord draweth now grudge not one
[27:31] against another brethren lest ye be
[27:33] condemned
[27:34] behold with judge standeth before the
[27:36] door
[27:37] take my brethren the prophets who have
[27:39] spoken in the name of the lord for an
[27:40] example of suffering affliction and a
[27:42] patience look at isaiah isaiah was a
[27:45] young man
[27:46] he was a prophet
[27:48] what happened to isaiah they took him
[27:50] out and saw the dude to pieces
[27:53] saw him while he was alive
[27:56] saw him in two
[27:59] look at all the other ones
[28:01] that were stoned
[28:03] even jesus said you you stoned the
[28:04] prophets and you you in other words you
[28:07] you clean the tombs and you garnish the
[28:09] tombs of the prophets and you're the one
[28:11] to put them in there
[28:12] don't let that happen to us right
[28:16] we don't the physical killing parts over
[28:18] i think i hope we're not murderers but
[28:20] you can murder somebody with your
[28:21] actions in your mouth
[28:22] thank my brother and the prophets who
[28:24] have spoken in the name of the lord for
[28:25] an example of suffering affliction and
[28:28] of patience now look they had patience
[28:31] but they didn't have new birth patients
[28:34] they didn't have any birth
[28:36] they could have new birth patients they
[28:38] had an anointing patients right
[28:40] which was temporary
[28:44] we count them happy which endure
[28:48] like i told you before to have happiness
[28:51] you got to have song
[28:53] sorrow is a part of happiness right
[28:56] you got to be in one position
[28:59] to be real happy when you get to this
[29:01] position or you're a bunch listen we're
[29:03] spoiled brats if we do if
[29:05] if we do that if god just pours
[29:06] everything on us all the time all right
[29:08] yes yes yes yes yes yes no sometimes he
[29:11] says no
[29:12] and remember his nose were better than
[29:14] all of our yeses
[29:15] behold we count them happy which endure
[29:19] now do we believe the bible or not
[29:22] you have heard of the patience of job
[29:25] and have seen the end of the lord that
[29:27] the lord is very pitiful and of tender
[29:30] mercy
[29:31] we've got to start believing this yes
[29:33] that the trial of our faith
[29:36] which is much more precious than gold
[29:38] this world runs by gold right yes
[29:41] but the trial of your faith if we
[29:43] believe the bible is much more precious
[29:45] than that goal
[29:47] and it said that perishes because your
[29:49] faith is not going to perish
[29:52] we'll walk on the streets of gold gold's
[29:54] not going to mean nothing to us we're
[29:55] not going to need gold to run the
[29:57] economy
[29:58] you know who we're going to need to run
[29:59] the economy
[30:01] us that's right
[30:04] people in the city
[30:06] because i believe outside the city
[30:07] they're going to plant they're going to
[30:08] grow and they're going to harvest and
[30:10] they're going to do this and they're
[30:10] going to do that
[30:12] and i think i might brother clog they're
[30:14] going to bring a tenth of their tithe in
[30:17] and bring it into us and we're going to
[30:18] eat it
[30:20] a scripture in it
[30:22] we're the levitical priests we're the
[30:24] priesthood right we're the kings and
[30:26] priests
[30:27] the ones outside are going to harvest
[30:28] and bring us attempt of everything in
[30:31] and you know what you don't worry about
[30:32] getting hungry
[30:35] because there's going to be billions
[30:36] more outside the city than they are
[30:38] inside we're probably going to have to
[30:39] rebuild the town to get all the stuff in
[30:42] it and i'm just making a point but don't
[30:44] worry about that but i do believe that
[30:46] that we've come to a position
[30:49] that we don't we're not seeing the
[30:51] position that god wants us to be in if
[30:54] and i'll get back to it in my last part
[30:56] i think of of the genesis 1 26 man
[31:11] that's okay baby he's all right
[31:14] i lost my thoughts
[31:18] somebody say something this is 126 man
[31:22] and the part that if adam had this
[31:25] working
[31:27] the whole genesis 126 because that was
[31:29] ma that was man not mankind you
[31:31] understand that's when you borrow it
[31:33] but all those characteristics that i was
[31:35] speaking about in the first part about
[31:37] having the replenishing and multiplying
[31:39] all those things
[31:40] we got to come back to that while we're
[31:42] here that's right
[31:44] adam's got to come back in power here
[31:48] not in the millennium
[31:50] now
[31:51] that's how we're going to make it out of
[31:52] here we may have to speak a storm out of
[31:55] existence we may have to speak a car off
[31:57] the road we may have to speak a car to
[31:58] get to church but if you don't have it
[32:04] you're going to sit home and die
[32:07] not physically but spiritually you're
[32:08] going to sit home and die all right
[32:10] let's go
[32:11] we'll see you in two weeks sir bob be
[32:13] next sunday
[32:14] and
[32:17] ryan you got the next one coming up
