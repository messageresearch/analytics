everybody have the purpose in life whether it be to be just a a person that sits in a in a Pew and praise and goes to work pays their time um The Widow's might was worth more than all the gold that that any of the Pharisees ever give because you give with a True Heart right she gave all she had with a true heart she didn't go up there and go well I see these guys looking at me I'm gonna put to put all my money in so they'll think of me no she went up there with an open heart and say God this is all I got and he blessed her I would sure he blessed her abundantly if it didn't bless her on this side to give her eternal life so that's a big enough blessing to me you have all the money in the world swept the grid this morning posted even without charity whether you can have all the uh gifts and we could have healings and and uh we could have Mighty meetings and people be saved and healed but without charity without love true love one for the other not just not a not a makeup love but a true love one for the other if you got your Bible let's go ahead and turn to Joel too that's what we were trying to head to this morning I hope you enjoyed this morning service later man really enjoyed the uh you being here to listen to it because you couldn't say you enjoyed it if you weren't here two things I need to ask you a question um Jen's taking some of the kids Junior brother boys and Sister Janet I think Joyce is going to the Youth Camp next next Friday to Rutherfordton also next Saturday is the fellowship meeting so we're going to have bus conflicts or band conflicts we're either gonna let them go in the van which is there's eight or nine of them going let them have the white van and then us just go in regular cars to the fellowship meeting I think my Brown Band I can hold seven in it but I need to kind of know tentatively you don't have to raise your hand but just kind of letting know today if you're going to the fellowship meeting we know for a given who's going to the to the youth so I'd just like to know if there's not a whole bunch of us going to fellowship meeting then we can just do it in cars and don't don't not go just because we don't have room we'll make room for somebody if you want to go on Saturday pay your gas or or do something to get you to get you over there we're not trying to bribe you into going by no means but we will pay for you gas if you if you want to drive your own car if we have to use and them have the others I think Charlotte Richard's going to go for sure June uh it's going to be gone so I will probably be on the of ground and going to associate meeting so if anybody else wants to go I know Mom and Dad will be going so just let us know after service either tell June or I won if you're going to go to the fellowship meeting or if you're even thinking about going so we can kind of get all this together we only have one White Band and if there's eight or nine of those going to the Youth Camp I'd rather them drive yet but uh uh well let's just try to work that out if you don't mind so Joel two we're going to start at verse 21. and you can title this former latter rain let's buy our heads before we get started do you Heavenly Father we pray Lord that again you would come Among Us in a special way Lord that you would bind our hearts together in you not of our own self or anything we've done or anything special about any one Lord but it's you we were chosen in you before the foundation of the world Lord and we know now that we're realizing what's going on and why we were put in this age and while we were put in this hour and what we're supposed to do while we're here father we pray Lord that you will just now come and and bless us your words already blessed but Lord just Quicken it to our hearts Quicken it to our minds Lord that we may have the mind of Christ Lord may you come Lord not in a partial way but Lord in the fullness perfect Lord the perfect realization of the end time that we're your people and we're put on this Earth Lord to to do a work like no other work that's been done before father we pray now that we realize that take it and hold it nurture it let that seed grow into a mighty mighty oak tree father forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes and Lord the things we do wrong bless the missionaries on the foreign field bless each one that's not with us Lord the ones that are traveling the ones that will be coming back Mom and Dad coming back to Martin each one of them Richard and Anna and and brother Aaron and Sister Sarah just bless their families be with them Father just take care of us lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit we ask you things in the name of Jesus Christ amen y'all too all right now keep in your mind what we were talking about this morning and then let's just kind of break this down a little bit and see what we can uh see what we can come up with Joel 2 verse 21 now we're going to come back and read again because this is talking to Israel but it's also talking to us because the Joel is telling this in response of Deliverance to Israel but listen fear not a land be glad to Rejoice verse 21. for the Lord will do great things be not afraid ye beast of the field for the pastors of the Wilderness do spring for the tree Beth or fruit the Fig Tree and the vine do yield their strength be glad then you children of Zion who's that right okay and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the Locust has eaten the canker worm caterpillar Plum worm my great Army which I sin among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed you may be seated in the Lord as blessings reading the word also if you want to turn to James 5 verse 7 brother John I'm having up here now be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the Lord that's our great behold the husbandman waited for the precious fruit of the Earth what is he saying who's the husband Jesus what's he waiting on he's waiting on the precious fruit of the Earth but he knows he planted the seed all right he knows he planted the seed he's just waiting for it to him a tour and have long patience for it until he received the early and let it rain all right so the Lord adds a blessing to that now what we were talking about this morning was partial to perfect and I think everybody's kind of got a pretty good understanding about partial and perfect there's nothing wrong with partial if you can get away from it or if you can move from partial to perfect okay if you move from partial to perfect that's okay you stay impartial you say well is that not okay well what did we just read right here be patient therefore Brethren until the coming of the Lord behold the husband I'm waiting for the precious fruit of the Earth what you and I just waiting for us to mature because you do not Harvest like we were talking about this morning you don't go out and harvest they told me not to stand over there I'm gonna put the pulpit over here is that better thank you they say the glare on my top of my bowl look my bald spots whiten out the uh picture so anyway you know I told him the other day I said you know the Bible doesn't say anything about men not wearing makeup so I think we're gonna start wearing a little makeup you know it's only the women you don't scare you to dance if you saw some of these people like news announcers and stuff you see them on television they got they like their faces all powdered up well they'd be horrible to look at them you know before that but but since we're on TV now we've got to look like that but anyway if I say I don't care it'd be okay be patient until we receive the early and Ladder rain now perfect realization will bring a rapture so that's what we need to look at all right latter rain or partial I mean partial and former it's Foundation let me clear that up from this morning I thought I didn't say that partial is a foundation perfect is the fruit thereof see he's waiting for what he's waiting for the precious fruit he wasn't waiting on Luther's little little two shoes he wasn't waiting on Wesley's little stalk sure they were bragged they had their place but God is waiting on a mature bride to mature into fruit you don't get fruit off of this you don't get fruit off of a stalk when you get fruit out of mature plants only produce fruit only produce fruit all right Joy's waiting for the precious fruit of the what Earth this guy right here and have long patience for it he's waited six thousand years to get enough word to us for us to understand and to restore us back to where we should have been had there not been a fall is that correct so but God in his in his great wisdom God has give it to us a little at a time right you don't plant the seed two days later you gotta Harvest no right like I said you get a spring rain and it rains real good and then it stops raining for a little while it's kind of dry like throwing peas at a dry cowhide you know same way with God sometimes than us he speaks to us every once in a while used to when we were growing up in their baby form of our new birth he would speak to us a lot he rained on us a lot because the rain is the Holy Ghost does everybody understand the rain is a holy ghost all right that's what comes down from God out of Heaven that's what brings us to maturity without the Holy Ghost you're not even a plant that's right without the Holy Ghost you might be a weed plant but I'm not talking about the plant that we're talking about today you're not even a plant if you're not born again that's right all right because you've got to be in the family of God to be in the family of God you must be born again all right so we're going to read that the rain falls on the just in the end yes which is sure and that's what's happening in this day unless we can see let's break this down former and louder all right we read there in Joel that when he brought the former rain and then the latter rain now we're going to cover also that he brought those in the first month showing there would be a quick work to the daughters of Zion because there is absolutely no way you can plant something on January I mean on March the 1st and harvested on March the 31st or 30th no way physics I'm talking about naturally there's no natural way you can plant a uh tomato I don't care what it is 30 days can't happen but with God everything's possible and God is going to send us the daughters of Zion he's going to send us a short quick work he's going to bring the former Reign which is the teaching rain if you bring that up now brother Bob which is the teaching ring and will bring the latter rain on that on in the same month 30 days from now wake up brother Bob there you go all right here is the Hebrew Lexington now brother Braden we're going to read quotes in just a minute but Strong's number 4175 is where brother Brown gets the word Moray m-o-r-e-h pronounced Moray which is the early reign or the teacher all right now pull up number two please the Vicky number two this is this is a I guess you might say a root word off of it cool go back down number two I like this when you control stuff but look what it's doing look at the ones to cast to point out show to direct teach or instruct to be watered everybody kind of got a visual former reign which is a the former means first the first ring that falls everybody understand and that means also the cast or to point out show to direct teacher instruct now go number three which is Ladder later range spring rain the March and April rains which mature the crops of Palestine now go number four to glean gather take the aftermath take everything I like that dude to spoil gather everything from our strip but to glean gather take the aftermath or take everything of what of what you planted in the former all right go out and plant your crop just like we was talking about this morning we're gonna go out maybe this later part of the week when it starts raining we're going to take some crop C and we're going to go over to the Hunt Club we're going to show those on the ground I know for sure that they're not going to be up and matured in a month but I know one day that if we planted something like corn one day we'll get a harvest from that is that correct right so God listen everything God does he does in stages he does not do that for him he does that for us because we don't understand and if he dumped everything on us we'd go crazy all right our crazy art so he gives us a form of rain now I want you to listen I'm going to read you a few quotes and I want you to listen to a prophet this may be hard for you to swallow when brother Branham preached that the white horse rider was the mighty conqueror preached him as the Holy Ghost in 1959 and actually some in 1960 he was preaching out of partial revelation correct but it was all he saw for the time but now listen God didn't like that in that he allowed Luther and all them the reformers to preach that the Holy Ghost and all these things were certain others you know father-son Holy Ghost baptism and hell was eternal and all these things like that and eating fruit in the garden but remember there was another age to come that could take that and and bring it higher everybody got that I'm being slow but I want you to be slow too okay listen all right then God took Wesley what was in Wesley's age and over into the Pentecostal age he brought a higher form of that same Holy Ghost Luther had the Holy Ghost Right Wesley at the Holy Ghost right boom was it different no it wasn't different but to them they only saw this much of light Luther Wesley saw this much Pentecost saw this much but God was not happy until he had perfect hair so brother Branham was preaching that white horse rider was the was the Holy Ghost and The Mighty conqueror and some on the church age book and also listen to a prophet we're going to bring up the first quote and look at the dates 1948 now 1948 brother Brown was speaking on the former ladder reign I'm gonna break it down to you pretty slow so just just bear with me now God promised that he was going to send a former Reign and a lettering and he promised a former and latter rain in the latter rain don't get confused just stay where you at in other words a double portion now what he's talking about is the former lettering coming in the same month everybody got that now former ladder rain coming in the same month all right a double portion in other words you're gonna get former ladder in 30 days right everybody got that say Amen all right so that's what he's saying in other words a double portion like the Garment of Elisha when Elijah dropped it Elisha picked up and had a double portion and remember Elisha is a type of the church and Elijah is a type of Christ right Christ was taken up in the same spirit that was upon Christ is on the church tonight the Holy Ghost and you know what I was thinking the other day when Elisha struck the Jordan with the mantle of Elijah what did he say he said where be the god of Elijah he didn't say where to be Elijah that's our problem people I start problem in the message we're looking for Elijah Elisha knew that Elijah went off the scene that's right so I'll Asha knew that he wasn't looking for Elijah to do what he was supposed to do he was looking for the same God that was in that Elijah to do what was needed to be done so he said where be the god of Elijah I say to you today we'll be the god of Elijah Elijah's gone but where be the god of Elijah because remember Elisha Elisha did twice as many miracles as Elijah did double portion right right I think Elijah did eight he did 16 something like that that's me and you that's right right that's you and I that sounds right Josh turn it down a little bit I'm loud enough but Elisha said where be the god of Elijah Christ was taken up so now if he was taken up gone off the scene then guess what happened a bride stepped on the scene in the end time I mean in the during the church ages now brother around him is this 1948 go to the next one here's a prophet in partial realization because this is gonna sound contrave when I read you a quote in about four or five more quotes you're going to see something different but this is Brother Brown speaking about Divine Healing he's talking about all these other things and blue screens on the computer is not good no signal if you guys went to lunch I told him it was like two air traffic controllers back there over there trying to do this and do that he's on the railroad but look now this and he promised the former Atlanta Reign now we're living now have been for years under the latter rain that's not true as far as when we bring him up in 1962 to the spoken words Original Seed and then Holy Spirit said pick up your pen and write he said you say latter rain later rain he said you haven't got the former yet but watch the prophet talking about he's not wrong in what he's saying go to the next one in the beginning when Pentecost fell it fell on the Jews and the Jewish Church died and the Gentile Church come in now you're picking up his thought of course there's not the same message but you're looking at this thought and what brother Brown's talking about and a gentile Church come in and then all signs and wonders ceased now notice that was the former reign then the church the Jewish church is returning just in the latter rain when the Holy Spirit is just being poured out again and the Jews now returning by the Thousand back to Palestine what am I trying to say if you read you what I try to do sometimes it's like brother Dale does I try to find a quote that looks contrary because one day you're going to come across it one day you're going to be reading the book you're going to say brother Brown said the former letter of English already over or that we're in the latter rain and it's 1950. and then you go reach Pokemon's Original Seed which says you don't even have a ladder rain yet former range just now falling but now look let's go from partial to perfect in partial realization the when Pentecost fell what did it fall on it fell on what Jesus showed in the disciples okay 120 in the upper room the Holy Ghost fell on what was already planted in their field that was former Reign teaching rain you're going to see that when brother Branham he didn't go back and try to repreach all this because this was really a foundation right all right you gonna find out we I threw this one away to keep from having so many quotes but he said John the Baptist so the form of rain then Jesus was the latter rain see so you can't just say what I'm trying to say today is you can't just say well former rain is just teaching it is or it's just this no I want to bring you back to the to the 48s to the 50s we're gonna go to the 60s and then we're going to go to 2011. because the former Reign has always been teaching because a lot of rain cannot fall just like I told you about the hunting club if I didn't plant no seed over there it wouldn't matter if it rained a thousand times all right he ain't gonna come up that's right because there's nothing in that field to come up so there had to be something planted there was something planted in those disciples and in beginning when Pentecost fell it fell on the Jews right with that 120 in the upper room why did it fall on it felt on it fell on the former ring or the teaching rain because what did God do God is we say well Harvest Harvest is a Rapture I know that but when Stephen died he was the first one martyred right Stephen back in back in the in the Old Testament I mean New Testament well that's really nice really the Old Testament but back in in uh in the book of Acts what happened to Stephen that wasn't the New Testament because he was born again um he was the first one harvested remember the song Stephen was the first one to die for this Holy Ghost plan he was the first one harvested partial Harvest this may be confusing you may have to do this again remember Luther had to Holy Ghost all the Holy Ghost he'll ever have and it's the same Holy Ghost you got today yeah it was impartial that's right all right so the Holy Ghost fell on their Pentecost in power and manifestation signs and wonders but they died it was partial right so they died part they played their part and then they went off the scene and God what God harvested his fruit because you're going to see one thing's for sure God is pleased to do that but that's not all that's not the perfect that God wants the perfect that God wants is is for you and I this fruit to walk off this Earth without death amen all right so now this is all impartial everything listen let me just put it this is plain everything from right where we're standing today back is partial right think about that except for Jesus except for Jesus he was perfect I'm talking about after he death burial Resurrection ascension come back under that Pentecost from Pentecostal now has been partial partial realization but that which is perfect that's why I ran this morning that which is perfect has come now we know God's the perfect one but he had to have a group of people to put that perfect in amen right man and they weren't sown yet because you're going to realize one thing's for sure brother Branham could see where he pulled up the next quote all right listen let's read this one now this is the church age book Church age book remember he preached the church a series in 1960 but he didn't he didn't compile the church age book until like 64 or 60 right in that 64 right so he's already preached spoken words Original Seed listen to what he's saying now this age started just after the turn of the 20th century as it was to be the age in which the true church not that they were all false right true mature the mature Church everybody all right with that you say true then that's where people go well are they amongst the rest of them have been false no in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost we know that there must be necessant necessity be a return of dynamic power the believer sensed this in the spirit began crying to God for a new outpouring such as within the first century what seemed to me the answer came as many began to speak in tongues of manifestation manifest gifts of the Spirit it was then believe that this was indeed a long-awaited restoration now I couldn't get a quote to interject in that but if you'll look back and I can't remember it but you can pull it up on a computer brother Branham starts talking about a latter rain movement there was a group of people come out Assemblies of God come out in a ladder rain movement they started prophesying and he said well they he said they said they were all prophets he said they weren't all prophets he said they began to prophesize well therefore they called them prophets he said but they were not loud rain he said they really didn't know what they were talking about but see that's what he's talking about right here what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest gifts of the Spirit it was then believed that this was indeed the long-await of restoration it was not for the latter rain can come only after the former Reign which is the spring or teaching reign the latter rain then is the Harvest rain how could this be the real thing when the teaching rain had not come excuse me the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people who's he talking about himself that's right the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back and Pentecostal fathers had not yet come thus that was thought to be the restoration and found quickening until the Rapture had not come unto the Rapture had not come and it was a mixture of the unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessings and manifestations of the Holy Spirit we're going to read one quote maybe in a minute if I didn't cut it out I had to cut some of these out for time but brother Brown said you plan a denominational seed and the Holy Ghost fell so you're going to in other words you're going to harvest your nominational right Harvest all right that's why that's why that that brother Brandon when I say brother Brown had to come it was Jesus Christ in in brother Brown you know that because he was the prophet the Lord Jesus Christ come back through the messenger speaking to us to get us back in line let's go to the next one we're still in the church age book we'll read Joel in a minute go down to the to the yellow the Lutheran age did not restore the church they started a Reformation the Wesleyan age did not restore this one we read this morning or close to it the Pentecostal age did not restore but God has to restore for he cannot deny his word this is not the resurrection of the church it is the restoration God will take the church right back to Pentecost of the beginning now down at the bottom he is doing it and stated in verse 23 by the teaching or former Reign next will come to harvest rain or rap drink fade so now go to the next one let's see what it is excuse me here's how we're going to put it all together right here 1963 once more New York each one becomes a latter rain to the other for preaching on the church age brother around talk to the leftover right that you didn't have just an age end and the age begin if you really draw those circles they would be like almost you know they would be a small amount over to the other well that's kind of what's happened with the former rain and lateran look what it says each one becomes a ladder range to the other Luther was a ladder Reign to the Catholic he took Catholic teaching come over into his message God quickened the part that he needed the just shall lived by faith but he still had a lot of the Catholic ideas is that correct yes right all right so that was a lap over just like in the church ages and John Wesley was the lateran to Luther he took Luther's teaching didn't stay on Luther's teaching he built on Luther's teaching that stair step that comes up that stair step comes up and the next level of stairs sits right down on top of the bottom one same way with with this so brother Brown could be right he is right I didn't I didn't mean to say it was wrong but he was right when he said that the former lettering was falling it fell all down Through the Ages Luther's message gave over to Wesley Wesley was a ladder rain actually was the latter rain to Luther so what Luther was the former teaching Wesley was the latter the Harvest all right because he had leftovers in the ages and God harvested what he harvested Luther's Doctrine he harvested what Luther what was quickened to Luther the good harvested that group of people the Pentecost was the latter rain to the denomination in other words John Wesley now the Pentecostals are organized now what's going to happen CCC listen to this next one I didn't have it highlighted but I read it back there in the back and I think I read it the children of God never drove their state tents down so tight that what they couldn't pull it up remember when the pillar fire move they got up moved with it right what happened was Luther God was pleased with Luther pleased with his teaching and there was a harvest of that age but they cabbage down and become a denomination and God said I'm moving right what they've done is they put their states down too far in the ground and didn't move right the children of Israel never put their Stakes down too far because remember when that pillow fire moved they had a certain length of time they didn't have 14 to 15 days or even two three days as soon as that pillar fire got ready to move they moved with it amen right and the pillow fire moves right out it leaves them sitting there just goes right on they're so straight down so they can't move but then there's many fine-hearted people they got caught in the nomination you and I got caught into nomination all right now let's go to the next one we'll get some right here real quick and then I'll make some more comments I said latter rain I said Ms McPherson you know who he's talking about Amy simple McPherson of the Foursquare Church was Lata rain too she was she was the latter of rain to the assemblies she was the Harvest of what the assemblies had planted she became come out of it became a harvest of that Luther was a later in the Catholic Baptist was Atlanta Reign to Luther Methodist was a lot of rain to them the Pentecostals the latter rain to the Nazarene ladder rain later rain what is it when the church gets organized and sit down home and just a big bunch of cold statues then the Holy Ghost moves out and starts a lot of rain what is it a movement or a harvest rain all right go number seven now watch here's where on the Pokemon's original seat this is where we need to get to so far that was pretty quick I'm sorry but former rain is teaching right later rain is the Harvest of that teaching range pretty simple what Luther talk what Luther planted in those people God harvested all right under Wesley the same way everybody so there's been even up to Amy simple McPherson and um trying to think of some of the other ones back during that time but those people had heart had had a former are teaching reign but now watch in 1962 just my belief uh do you believe if you want to or study it out when brother Brown preached the statue of a perfect man in 1961 he really began to start preaching his message we know his message came into seals in 1963 but as any message there is a former our teaching right you and I could not understand 63 to 65 if we don't have 47 to 63 so don't start that uh well we only need 1963 and above uh but I don't think so that's right because you got to have the former rain the teaching reign now watch now remember the word Mori which we pulled it up means teaching the the form of rain it says the more a rain the teaching rain teaching rain went forth Billy Graham has struck the world teaching Pentecostal struck the world what their Doctrine and the word has struck the world God had showed him he was preaching the message now watch the matter now she is now waiting for the latter rain that's when she produces her fruit oh I hope you get her all right go to 7A this is in 1962 after he preached spoken words Regional seat I just thought I'd put this in because watch this if you notice that word there in the Hebrew former and latter rain former Ray means a sowing rain teaching and sewing is the same thing what do you do when you teach the word of God you're sowing a seed I'm sowing a seed right now some of it's falling on dry ground some of it's falling on sleepy ground and then when the spirit Falls it falls on the just and the unjust what you talking about now the latter rain something's going to fall all right if we've so denominational seeds we just reap the denominational Harvest that's what we've done the Baptist took a million more 44 and hard tell what they are now after the great Evangelist Billy Graham and many of them had slept look at our Pentecost through the war robbers Tommy Osmond and great men like that they had a teaching or form of rain and then there was a harvest all right let's just stop right there for a second so so far brother Branham has has been teaching in a partial application that's hard to say because many say well well he was he was perfect he was no he was partial his partial teaching was 47-63. that was his partial and frankly if we don't get 63 to 65 that's the partial it's actually left up to you and me to decide which one is which that's my whole point today we can take this thing on to the to the god brother Nick said I agree 100 percent why not until my last breath I'm going to be the one in live in a minute that's alive and remain but you're not just going to be there because you're standing in little church right you're not going to be there because you've read 24 books a day or you memorize the Bible yes yes or you're good I tell you what you think I'm hard sometimes never read Jesus when he went into the temple I've never called anybody hypocrite to their faith but he sure did he call them snakes he told him he said you're not like my daddy we're from a whole different family now buddy walk in a message church and tell somebody like that say hey my daddy and your daddy ain't the same you're a hypocrite but you think I'm bad Jesus told them all he said your generation is dead eternally separated from God and that what he said he said it they said well we we got Abraham we got Moses we got this quotebook they did they had the Torah the five you know first five books of the Bible That's Moses cookbook you know we carry quote books all around with us lamb Moses quote book he said yeah and he said here of your father the devil and the ones in that age are all dead and eternally separated from me when are we going to get down to where we get down to that that's when I think you're going to see people walk out the door denominational Harvest that's what brother Brown was dealing with let me be honest with you the way I see it up until that's why 1977 was a very important place and I'm just going to stick this in and I'll leave it 1977 was a dispensational change up until 1977 even brother Branham with the great ones like Billy Graham or Robert even FF Bosworth called him the father of our faith in this time he still took father son Holy Ghost he couldn't see the message never saw the message that I know of as far as the way we see the message but he was born in that age he got the former Reign for whoever he got it from and then God harvested that latter rain of what he had took in God quickened everything that FF Bosworth knew now brother Brown said if Bosworth could tie you up in notch on faith and Divine Healing that was his purpose Smith Wigglesworth never met William Branham but he's a born-again believer actually he died and the next day brother Brown the angel met brother Brown in 1947 Smith woofworth died the day before so she has always got somebody on the scene he's always got somebody doing the work but now you can't say what Smith what was worth was was wrong but it was partial Billy Graham was partial Oral Roberts was partial Joshua I don't understand about Billy Graham and Oral Roberts they never saw the message in the hour but brother Brown said they were two prophets to Sodom to call out a people and condemn that age right said Billy Graham had the Holy Ghost but they never accepted brother Reynolds message why you said well a denominationalism will take you straight to hell be careful guys that's right be careful be real careful amen all right but now I want to tell you something's for sure though after 1977 God don't wink at a lot of ignorance like he used to all right right after 1977 something did change the dispensation of the Gentile of this bride people got to digging in this message and we got to really get in the real Harvest out of this thing all right so God went to our ignorance there's always a lap over all right brother random was preaching partial realization but you know what we're supposed to do we're supposed to glean the perfect out of all of it right but take it on yeah exactly see he come and brought this right here and the quotes from 47 to 63 a lot of people in the message don't even read them but inside brother Brown didn't say it in the books and tapes after 63 lives Rapture and Faith he said in these books and tapes lies rapturing Faith so from 47 to 63 somewhere in there out of that partial God's gonna bring a perfect down to that partial right okay former Reign we got the teaching there's no more teaching to come there's no more different message to come all right he's got to come out of what we've already got it that's why we do it that's why I think it's wonderful we don't have to look for anything else to come that's right it's already come it's already here rapturing Faith lives in abortion tapes are what the Harvest of what this Prophet brought us from a partial understanding to a perfect understanding all right and in your journey like I said this morning in our journey you're going to start it partially and some people are going to stay at partial but somebody's going to come to perfect realization somebody's gonna why because there's a lot of rain to fall in the end times right old Daughters of Zion in other words perk your ears up because I'm talking to you I'm not talking to Israel I'm talking to you I'm not talking to the Baptist I'm not talking to the Methodist I'm talking to you right now pull up the next one please now this is back on spoken words Regional sea this is what brother random is doing now and what they're trying to do they're trying to manufacture a lot of rain nonsense you can't manufacture right rain have we ever as smart as we are and as advanced as we are Manchester never made rain man can't make rain man can't make this spiritual rain sure they try nonsense why the latter rain will sweep the world brother been a former range showing words showing words if that word's not quickened though with that line of rain you're not gonna have a harvest we just become let me put that in there um been a former range throwing words but if there's not a ladder ain't on that it's just words right quotes Moses's quote book that's right now you'll see what the latter rain produces you'll find out they'll be on affiliation the Pentecostals and all the groups will come together and they'll shut the doors on them guys that won't listen to it you won't even be allowed to open your mouth right that's when he'll come that's when he'll show that's when you'll see a rain oh my lay still be quiet uh-huh Let It Go oh know the next one here he's praying spoken words originally see the same message he's praying gracious Heavenly Father we're not trying to bring the meat into a close this was actually the first message remember everybody came back about two or three o'clock for the second message it was about six hour sermon now we pray father that these seeds that sown will be laying waiting for the latter rain to fall waiting they that wait upon the Lord they shall renew their strength God may we not run ahead of the word state with the word Granite Lord that's what the problem is some have run way ahead and not waited on God but now what's happening brother Brown has preached and sewed the word down all right let's go to number nine well this is what the Holy Spirit told him right here listen God has promised be careful God has promised Malachi 4 for the last day and Malachi 4 has not yet has been fulfilled but it must be fulfilled for it is a dramatized word of God spoken through Malachi of the Prophet Jesus referred to it it is to be just before the coming of Christ the second coming listen close now all scripture that has not been fulfilled must be before that time the Bible is to be finished to be finished the Gentile dispensation is to be finished with the church age when this anointed messenger arrives of course he will plant the seed of the entire Bible that was Luther's problem he didn't show the word of the entire Bible he showed the word just shall live by faith Wesley sowed sanctification cleansing set aside for service of course he will plant the seed of the entire Bible Plum from the serpent to the messenger in the former reign then he will be rejected by the denominational people as his forefather John and Elijah as was spoken by our Lord people as Elijah was the first time to ahab's time it will happen here in this country as this country is a type of Israel all right go to Lemon still on the spoken Orange Regional seed he said I'm going to visit you know where's that is in Sarah he's at the he's at close to the body chain I'm going to visit you I the personal pronoun I'm going to visit you according to the time of life oh and you're going to have that baby that you've waited on the latter rain is fixing to fall you've held that seed in there long enough now on believing On Believing I mean the the one this morning we were talking about was uh was uh partial and it was doubt now when I'm saying Abraham had that baby if they had doubted I don't think so the latter rain is fixing to fall you've held that seed in there long enough now on believing and you're looking for a coming son and he's coming amen that's the real church today see that elected seed you've been looking for him I'm going to send him to you amen what said that who was it the word which was who Melchizedek a preacher a priest a priest Melchizedek brought the word to Abram or Abraham he's told him you know he changed his name all right let's go to the name let's get the quotes out of the way same way spoken word is reasonable seed this is where brother Brown the holy spirit said pick up your pen right so at this time in this country that that person will appear for its in scripture and it's thus saith the Lord then in the latter rain they will come forth a Mount Carmel Showdown Bible fulfilled to the letter John the Baptist his messenger before his face in Malachi 3 planted a former Reign and was rejected by the churches the denominations the Pharisees and said the season is dead Jesus came and had Mount Transfiguration Showdown this Forerunner of the last day was so for the former Reign now what's that teaching in other words he's going to sow the word so that we can understand it so that when the latter rain comes that's what John done John and Malachi 3 see that's not brother Brown that's John the Baptist Malachi 3 sowed the seed so that Jesus could come all right the Holy Ghost himself right not not another person the Holy Ghost themselves all right Planet a former Reign was rejected by the churches which was who John the Baptist Jesus came and had a mount Transfiguration Showdown this Forerunner the last day well so for the former Reign Jesus Will Be The Showdown now he didn't say to the messenger only one true Messenger will point you to that man right to you right he'll never point you to himself he'll point you to Christ every time Jesus will be the showdown between denominations and Creeds which is his word when he comes a showdown the Rapture of his pride the first was Mount Carmel now what was Mount Carmel what happened on Mount Carmel a bunch of preachers got killed I think we could get into that but we're not but 200 and some preachers got killed that day and Elijah 400 and Elijah was on the mountain he said it God be God right yeah let Fire Fall yes if it not be the god then of course they you know what they've done but that was the first Showdown it was the Elijah Minnesota first Elijah the denominations of that day they had a what a showdown Jesus came and had a mount Transfiguration Showdown that was not physical where he killed a bunch of preachers but what did he do he was transfigured he was glorified and Jesus was adopted on map Transfiguration all right so you've got you've got Elijah had to deal with the denomination you got Jesus was dealing with I mean yeah we got um sorry we got Elijah dealing with the denominations and having a physical killing all right you've got the you got Jesus now dealing with a spiritual aspect on Mount Transfiguration where God showed and said this is my beloved Son and whom I'm pleased to dwell hear ye him now this Forerunner the last day he's gonna have to do all these he had death denominations he had the he had the form he had this one the second was Mount Transfiguration he didn't get changed but he's showing us how to get chains and the third would be Mount Zion who's the daughters of Zion and brother Brown said that would be the change of the body oh actually that's what we're looking at now in this latter rain that we're supposed to say um come or is coming but it says then in the latter rain that will come forth a Mount Carmel a showdown form of rain let's break it down then we'll be done former rain is a teaching rain that's what you when you become a Christian you started in partial realization and you begun to what listen to the word of God as the word of God became a part of your life that took you from partial heading toward Perfect all right when the Holy Ghost fell into that Pentecost it fell on a group of people then the perfect realization in their in their time for their time but it was partial realization for all that God's talking about in the Bible everybody understand that say Amen tell me some of you are asleep all right but down through the church ages it was partial realization for Paul but what he preached was perfect right that's right what Luther had was partial but what he preached for his time was perfect God harvested that that was his latter rain right got it yeah comes to God harvested he took he took he took the you know I I've always said the Bible says we plant them in corruption and that's what we have to do the reason of the Fall brother Benny the reason the fall reason we're burying people God didn't curse Adam he cursed the Earth that's right so you got the Earth our bodies come out of that Earth from thus Thou Art dust you shall return so we're planting them in corruption but they'll that seed that's been planted if it's a true sea of God not true like we're talking about that true is going to take alive and remain but they were a true seed of God for their time we planted him in the Earth but you'll never see that again that plant or that seed that was planted many years ago as an as a new birth it grew in that man it just never went to a perfect realization but now when he comes back the next time we see him the reason of all the teaching and the purpose of all the teaching was that the next time we see Tom far Bush he's going to be in young plant that's right he's going to be a young person he's going to be Eternal Body Spirit and soul the last time we saw brother Tom we saw a partial we saw a man that was broken down we saw a man that was getting old couldn't hear couldn't see because that Earth has been cursed but now people in the end time the change of the body is not so far that we can't get to it that's right because we've come to realize that the third stage of adoption is not the change of the body is to understand that's right that's right the change in the body and when you understand something guess what that takes out doubt Joe Parker was gone we're into perfect now see so whatever you have the word of God if you're sitting here today and you thought well I don't know what form of rain means that's partial but if you understand now that now I can read and if brother Brown says this and this and this you say well well that was partial understanding Luther partial understanding but perfect for his time right when you're born again partial realization but perfect first time right but we the problem is is we don't we can't go and throw it to another age we can't throw it to tomorrow I am let's go to Joel pull that up and we'll if you don't have to go to it we're going to read this we always read Joel 2 22-26 let's see what God's really listen to this I want you to put this in in your words blow the trumpet enzyme so where is he where's Zion always speaks to the bride daughter's design whatever you want to call it but that comes in time below the trumpet enzymes sanctify fast call a solemn assembly gather the people sanctify the light we had that this morning another boy came up here right and said what was on his heart I hope that did that to the congregation gather the people sanctify the congregation assemble the elders gather the children and those that suck the breast let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber and to brine out of her closet what was I talking about this morning the actress watch them they're all moving toward the play they're all moving toward the stage let the priests the Ministers of the Altar and let him them say that's what I say before I leave any Minister's office and come and speak to you or anybody else around this country I lift my hands and I say Lord the lobby of Castaway and you throw me into hell say something through me and help somebody here and I and I mean that the idea Castaway though God never used me again that's what the minister say spare thy people O Lord and give not the inheritage to reproach that means live a clean life that the heathens should rule over them what what's heathen this thing right here is heathen so watch how he's building this thing up wherefore should they say among the people where is their God then will the Lord be jealous of his land and pity his people yea the Lord will answer and say unto his people behold I will send you mature fruit what's wine and oil Holy Ghost and you shall be satisfied therewith and I will no more make you a reproach among the healing look at all these eyes but I will remove far off from you the northern Army and will drive him into a land Barren and desolate with his face toward the EC and his hinder part toward the utmost sea and his stink shall come up and his ill savior shall come up because he hath done great things fear not a land be glad and rejoice for the Lord will do great things Be not Afraid you Beasts of the field for the pastors of the Wilderness do spring Harvest Time right for the tree beareth her fruit the Fig Tree and the vine do yield their strength be glad then you children of zine and rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former Reign moderately that means a lot of teaching and he will cause to come down for you the rain the Holy Ghost the former rain and the latter rain in the first month so in other words it's not going to take seven Church ages to get this bride ready the word's going to come and the Holy Ghost is going to Quicken that word in the same month in the same time like dad's always said he said you get what you get today as a former Reign what you get today is a is a foundation and then when God quickens it he harvests that part and you get the increase you get look at what he's saying that's what he's saying and the floor shall be full of wheat the fat shall overflow overflow with wine and all and I will restore to you the years that the locusts of these and the canker worm caterpillar pom worm my great Army which I stand among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied that's the second time he said satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondersly with you and my people shall never be ashamed former Reign teaching you might have a lot of questions you might have a lot of things that's on your heart you might have a lot of doubt but God has got to harvest rain that if you'll stay there long enough go through the dry spell you're going to go through the dry spells you're going to go through a lot of hot sun but watch that hot sun doing that hot sun is making that planet grow and then at the end time it's going to be a harvest now this Harvest is different from the rest because this Harvest God is going to take the whole plant with it not just a little kernel of corn right he's taking the whole unit so he the former in latter rain in the end time is going to be like this and it's going to come together where what word we get today is quickened today we don't have to see Luther in their time to just shall live by faith they had to wait years and years and years and years and years and they finally they didn't get all of it and they were left in doubt they went into denominationalism and all those things and Wesley comes and he said man everybody's like wow that's great man now now let's just don't drink tea because it's not it has no value you know let's let's uh go to church you know he started the mess of this church and I know some of you know what Methodist means it means method Right Wesley gave him a method of worship if you're if you'll read a Methodist songbook it'll tell you at the front everything you need to do some of you shaking your head because you read it I went to a message to church one time and actually opened the book and read the thing and John Wesley it's got his name on it the things that he wrote do this worship this way do this that was a method but God was trying to teach people what just like I was talking about this morning don't let your kids run around outside don't let your kids run in church don't let your kids uh choose chewing gum or or you know throw papers or hey we don't throw papers anymore right now say tax yeah so you're not looking for this anymore you'll be looking for this and I know what goes on because I see it but anyway God's got to change it I can't do that everything's got to be positive because there's no negative in God now this part is the negative that God that God gave us through Mom and Daddy right here we didn't get into negative and positive I hope you understood that negative and positive is the same as partial and perfect all right the negative is I don't know why I can do it or not trying to see that shadow see that shadow that's negative but what is it a negative of what's real right man there has to be something real there before that shadow but when you do this what happens the shadow in the hand becomes one and that's what happened in the ages they looked through a glass Darkly they saw they saw Paul saw Jesus Peter saw Jesus they all saw him in the way they saw him Luther Wesley and all those but in the end time like we read the quotes the prophet preached the unadulterated word of God now every answer in the Bible somewhere can be answered every question I mean can be answered there's not a there's not something that you know we wonder about little things like what we're going to eat at the future home and the Millennium what we're gonna let's just worry about getting there right let's just worry about getting if we have tablecloths we have napkins who cares you're not going to worry about it because if you start worrying about those kind of things guess what Satan's going to do he's going to run your own mind all the way that way and you're going to miss what the preacher's talking about all right save them do that now I know he will be that way I'll be thinking about planting seed and I'll be going over here planting seed in the in the food plot somewhere instead of talking acting about it instead of realizing what the preacher's talking about that's what Satan's job is that's right but read Joel 2 please this week read it just one time read that whole chapter and just think of God talking to you not talking to Israel not talking to uh there were uh Zion Zion was a place had people in it but they're all gone they're all dead they can't read we're the only ones alive and remaining that's right foreign latter rain in the end time is going to come together to where it's going to be like popping popcorn you're going to get revelation after revelation after Revelation if you don't get in Revelation now people you need to be in the Altar and pray you need to go to your own closet your own Altar and pray if you're not getting a revelation I'm not saying every day I'm not saying every hour but brother Brown said if you come to church you'll never leave the same musicians come you'll never leave the same you'll either leave better or worse you want me to explain that brother Boyd walked in the door the other day and he had some wrong things that he was bringing with him can I use you for example that's okay I'm sure he has some wrong things that he brought into this church not wrong as far as dirty and the things that he needed to get rid of right so he came in a certain way right he came in a certain way this is the way that you were right then what happened he sits down and do you know if he stood up and at the end of that service if he turned and walked out the door what would have happened he would have been 10 times worse than he walked in the first time because he took what he was needed to get rid of he took it out with him right then he got back out in that world and got out and all that junk I know this one not what happened but that's what could have happened but what did he do he laid it all down and he left a different person so you're either going to leave today better or worse you can leave better by saying God you've given me a little bit of teaching today now add to that so that I can get this under subjection to the one I can't see inside but you know what we live with both of them it's a battle brother brother fought right it's a battle I mean just to be honest we don't want to say this but we are two separate people if you're born again now if you're not born again you're not but if you're born again you're really kind of two separate people right right look white dog black dog right okay and which one did the old Chief which one do you say one one that he fed the most let's stand the one he's whatever you feed them that's which one that's what's gonna happen but I think we've come to the place to where now that it should be that we should be taking what's coming across and we we should be letting that you know just mull around let well do like I do you know you don't have to do like I do right that's me but anytime I get along and cut grass or or you know on the lawn mower or uh I'd be walking in a house somewhere and I'll see something that'll spark something I've been thinking but in that room now remember rain a former word had to be planted I had to hear then what did God do God honored that brother Brown said you want God to come on the scene he said start thinking about him anyway Sam start thinking about him he said if you think about him and get serious he'll come on the scene so let's start thinking about God bring him on the scene because when I was doing those food place you know what I was doing I was out there for thirty dollars worth of diesel fuel because I bought thirty dollars worth of diesel fuel and I run it all out of the motor it was about 11 hours on that tractor so I preached about three or four Sherman but you know what I was doing I was saying God what do these people need then you start thinking about well I'm out here planting I mean I'm out here cutting and I'm gonna plant I'm going to talk on forming a lot of rain see you know what so God comes to that amen I had zero notes written this morning zero I walked in that room and shut the door I said God I need something quick and I got for this morning and when I walked in there at 115 or about 1 30 today 115 I didn't have a note rope not one not one I had some quotes are not good without something to back it up but I'm like Dad you know I trust that gift amen because I'm sincere and honestly if I'm just the biggest scoundrel in the world if I if if if if God just decides to cast me away I want you people to make it I want you to make it I really really feel for every part I want you to make it I want you to make it whether I make it or not but you know what I'm just like kind of like what brother didn't said you know and you come to the realization that that you've seen so much of God to where if you did walk up and he said cast into the pits of hell I'd have to say God thank you for letting me at least see I can read your Bible with my natural eyes I can see that there's somebody in the end time that's so much different than anybody else that's ever walked the face of the earth besides you Jesus I said I'm glad you let me meet some of us I'm glad you let me walk among their life and I'm honest with that with my hand up I'm just glad brother gave that I got to know you whether I don't make it or not a good journey I'd rather you make it sir been a good job yes sir been a good journey if this is not it let's keep this until that gets there if this is farmer and ladders coming which that's the truth I mean look at what we've look at what we got but look at what's coming not like coming we're prophesying that it's coming to somebody else let's don't do that but you can prophesy you die let's quit putting it off that's right when that which is perfect is come that which is in part in other words we'll be put back here as a foundation when that which we know in part and we prophesy in part but that which is perfect has come that which is in part it's not going to be done away like we think of no it's just going to be there's no way this could be here without this there's no way you can have the love of God and not have every one of those virtues working in your life let's sing a song mountain is no longer on me and say God bless you foreign Straight Talk on the streets of Glory lives entire thing for eign you look at all these songs that we sing they talk about dying and all this stuff I know it's okay but you know that was partial understanding that was a partial understanding they were gonna die when I die Hallelujah that was partial that's all they understood that's all they could see but see that when it which is perfect this come we don't do away with those songs but that's for them it's not for us as far as the dying part there's no way that you're gonna make it if you say I can't make it that's right you just cut yourself off right there you said I can't do it then guess what you're your worst enemy because God never said you couldn't do it you just said you couldn't do just wearing them for 25 between us on on all right brother for this cam I don't mind me telling it but it's just human beings and I said well she said well she can't get over stuff like that a lot you know instantly and I said well I can I said I have to I have to get over stuff like that I don't dwell on you know Jen and I had a argument over money if you lost a hundred dollars we were having a family discussion and brother Daryl Hughes called Gerald Hughes Hall and of course he's the great emancipator he's the great orator and he said hello brother wait how you doing I said I'm doing great and he just he was prophesying I think he said well let me ask the boss and see how you're doing and I said oh she just left the room and she did she just left the room I didn't want her to talk to him because she would have told him what we were doing but you know the Lord sent that by but you know we got all I mean we 've done it was and I snapped too quick sometimes and some other that don't I don't think about that tomorrow tomorrow don't go now Susan said oh and she's a no I want you so old to be right right that's it human beings we are human beings we are going to be different thank God but we have the same purpose the same goals we should have the same goals we might pick on each other by doing this and doing that but look when it comes down to the word of God we all have one thing in common if you're born again that word of God's important to your life right and if you've got a problem talk to me brother Dale some deacons talk to somebody Elders doesn't matter don't let things Fester all right don't let things don't let things you know don't don't let the sun go down your wrath you know what the Bible said Don't Let the Sun Go Down your Wrath do not do that because tomorrow it'll factor into something a whole lot worse and it's really not nothing that's right I mean she lost a hundred dollars and money's tied around my house and but you know what so the special offering today no you know what and I'm gonna give you a testimony and then we're gonna quit attemption I didn't know when to when to quit a service I'll quit right at four o'clock um but you know I'll let you know my background about what I've done is when I quit work you know I lost about 400 plus my insurance on my four dollars a week worth of salary and you know what Gina we missed it they set that hundred dollars but we really really God's been good he took care of us he supplied our he supplied our knee Supply I ever need right okay so you just trust God for what you need and I promise you he'll give it to you because you know what he said he would that's right let's say another song yes sir okay every time it will never never I can't believe it's a journey somewhere from where we're at now I see foreign foreign
