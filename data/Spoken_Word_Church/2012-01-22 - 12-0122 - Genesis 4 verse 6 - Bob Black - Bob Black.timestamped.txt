[0:01] so last time we were I think we were at
[0:04] Genesis 4 verse 7.
[0:09] but I'm gonna hop back to Genesis 4
[0:12] verse 6.
[0:17] before I I I don't think we were at
[0:19] first Cinema we were at the first where
[0:21] uh
[0:22] we were talking about what Abel said to
[0:25] Kane
[0:27] let's go back to verse six
[0:31] which says in the Lord said unto Cain
[0:34] wire thouroth and why is that counting
[0:37] Us Falling
[0:38] if thou do us well shall thou not be
[0:41] accepted
[0:42] and the founder was not well send life
[0:44] at the door
[0:45] and unto thee shall be his desire
[0:48] and thou shalt rule over him
[0:50] I want to spend a little time talking
[0:52] about that because
[0:56] I think it's plain to me to see that God
[1:00] gave Cain a promise
[1:03] that if he would do like Abel he would
[1:06] be accepted and
[1:09] um
[1:10] when I was seeking the Holy Ghost
[1:13] Satan came to me and uh
[1:16] he told me first the first thing he
[1:18] started off with was there's no God and
[1:21] that was the first the first problem
[1:23] they presented to me
[1:25] so after I overcame that hurdle then he
[1:28] the next thing that he told me was
[1:31] well you've gone too far and you've
[1:33] glassed him the Holy Ghost you've uh
[1:35] you've crossed the line
[1:37] but we knew the sign of crossing the
[1:39] line is the desire and uh
[1:42] if you have a desire then there's
[1:45] something to fill at his eye in it you
[1:47] can you can come and receive it if you
[1:51] can believe it you can receive it and uh
[1:55] the next thing he told me
[1:58] after I had overcome those two hurdles
[2:01] was
[2:02] what if
[2:04] you are descended from Cain from the
[2:07] lineage of Cain
[2:09] so there's got to be a Bible answer
[2:11] so that's why I want what I want to talk
[2:13] about and we know uh
[2:16] Titus 3-9 Paul warns us to avoid foolish
[2:20] questions and genealogies and contention
[2:22] since Friday is about the lawful they
[2:23] are unprofitable in vain
[2:25] and then these are just what good would
[2:28] it do if you could if you could go all
[2:30] the way back and prove that Adam was
[2:33] your ancestor because all of the
[2:35] children of Israel out of all of them
[2:37] only Joshua and cable believed that's
[2:40] right and we're going to look at Kayla
[2:43] and to find something interesting about
[2:45] him in a minute but uh
[2:47] in Romans 9 8 it says that is they which
[2:51] are the children of the flesh these are
[2:53] not the children of God but the children
[2:55] of the promise are counted for the sea
[2:58] so uh let's just for that point sake of
[3:01] argument let's strip away everything
[3:03] else
[3:04] AAA
[3:05] uh take a look at the moment in your
[3:08] life when there's nothing else but your
[3:11] genealogy and that's before you reach
[3:13] the age of accountability
[3:15] so let's see what brother Brown said
[3:16] about that and there's the teaching that
[3:19] says this is an enticing experience
[3:21] paragraph 12 and there's the teaching
[3:23] that says if the baby's born of a Holy
[3:25] Ghost parents well the baby will go to
[3:28] heaven
[3:29] but if it isn't
[3:30] it there's no more to it the baby is
[3:32] just no more that's strictly an error
[3:35] what difference does it make whether
[3:36] it's the Holy Ghost parent
[3:38] it's all sexual desire and the baby's
[3:40] born the same way so it's all born in
[3:43] sin shaped in iniquity come to the world
[3:45] speaking lies that's the scriptural
[3:47] terms of it so in and then the blood of
[3:50] Jesus Christ cleanses and makes an
[3:52] atonement for that job if it dies he
[3:54] perfectly goes right into the presence
[3:56] of God and if it was born from the most
[3:59] sinful parents in the world until it's
[4:01] the age of accountability where it knows
[4:03] right and wrong and then what it does
[4:05] from then it's got to be forgiven for
[4:07] that it's got to ask his own opinion
[4:09] from then on but while it's a baby
[4:12] and then marriage and divorce he says in
[4:15] paragraph 60 you could take that onerous
[4:18] woman in the town the worst man if they
[4:21] had a baby it would have to come from
[4:22] the Lord because God has a law set
[4:25] together and these laws like the sun to
[4:28] raise you put a cockerborough in a good
[4:30] field it'll grow and it has to grow
[4:31] because it's God God's law
[4:34] when seed is planted it must grow when
[4:36] nothing can grow life of God because it
[4:39] operates under his laws therefore when
[4:41] the evil seed was planted in the womb of
[4:43] Eve it had to bring forth because it's
[4:46] God's law and production
[4:48] and it could do nothing else but bring
[4:49] it and it had to come from God
[4:51] that's the reason that people say little
[4:53] babies sometimes it's not born with
[4:55] Christian parents are lost
[4:57] Jesus Christ blood atones for the child
[5:00] I don't care how much it was born and
[5:02] how evil it was born he is the Lamb of
[5:04] God it takes away the sin of the world
[5:06] the little child cannot repent because
[5:08] it has nothing to repent for and that
[5:11] was the sin of the world which was taken
[5:13] away by the blood of Christ babies go to
[5:15] heaven no matter where your answers what
[5:18] your ancestry is and and I don't have
[5:21] this quote brother Benham talked about
[5:22] how after after the baby the child
[5:25] reaches the age of accountability the
[5:27] reason they don't come straight to
[5:29] Christ is because Satan is right there
[5:31] to put things in their mind and and
[5:34] interfere with them coming to God
[5:42] let me just read another quote it shall
[5:43] be even as it was told me
[5:45] I'll say this by the authority of God's
[5:47] word every baby that's under the age of
[5:49] accountability dies it goes to glory yes
[5:52] sir Christ died to take away the sin of
[5:54] the world and when you come to the age
[5:56] of accountability we are all born in sin
[5:58] and when he died he taken away the sin
[6:00] and when you come to the age of
[6:02] accountability then you're responsible
[6:04] from then on see it isn't you're not
[6:06] responsible for something you did not do
[6:08] crossed and died to save you to take
[6:11] away the sin that Adam calls but when
[6:13] you're sin you have to confess your sins
[6:15] first you have to confess it but the
[6:18] baby's done no sin if it if it's not
[6:20] accountable for what it does and Christ
[6:22] died to free that baby and if it's one
[6:25] of a parent drunkard or whatever they
[6:26] might be that baby goes to heaven I
[6:29] believe it and I believe it'll come to
[6:30] recognition of the Cross when it gets
[6:32] there to know that Christ died for me I
[6:34] believe that yes sir
[6:37] now
[6:39] this is the scripture the lord gave me
[6:41] when I was battling the devil and uh
[6:45] it's the scripture in uh it's the same
[6:48] one in Luke Luke chapter 3 and verse 7
[6:51] and 8 and Matthew chapter 3 verse seven
[6:53] and eight I think it's interesting
[6:54] that's exact same chapter and verse but
[6:57] then said in Luke chapter 3 verse 7 and
[6:59] 8 then said he
[7:03] to the multitude that came forth to be
[7:06] baptized with him
[7:07] old Generation of Vipers who informed
[7:11] you to flee from the Wrath to come
[7:13] bring forth therefore fruits worthy of
[7:15] repentance
[7:16] I begin not to say within yourself we
[7:18] have Abraham to our father
[7:20] for I say unto you that God is able to
[7:22] eat stones to raise up children unto
[7:24] Abraham
[7:25] and we know brother when brother Brandon
[7:27] talks about he talks about how if if you
[7:30] won't believe it he'll
[7:32] if the children of Abraham won't believe
[7:34] it he'll raise up somebody to believe it
[7:36] the stones don't have any life and we're
[7:39] you know uh
[7:42] I I I wish I had brought some quotes
[7:44] about her brother Brandon said about the
[7:46] Anglo-Saxon how Anglo-Saxons that's what
[7:48] we are the the white people come from
[7:50] Europe we have no lineage or uh
[7:54] nothing to post to
[7:57] God hiding himself in Simplicity he was
[7:59] talking about the time when the little
[8:01] opossum came to be healed and he said
[8:04] God's evil will be stones to race
[8:06] children of Abraham because I was able
[8:07] to heal Apostle or a fish or anything if
[8:10] he'll bring his message forth and the
[8:12] people won't believe it God can raise up
[8:13] an apostle to believe it Hallelujah God
[8:16] can raise a dead fish you can raise a
[8:18] dead opossum he can do anything he wants
[8:20] to do
[8:21] you know we were trying to trap a bobcat
[8:24] in our backyard and we ended up trapping
[8:26] an impossible and if you ever been up
[8:28] close them upon some of those nasty
[8:29] things
[8:31] you know I'm just I'm thankful I don't
[8:34] know why he saved me but I'm thankful
[8:37] that okay we don't have any lineage or
[8:39] anything to boost up but he calls and
[8:42] saved us
[8:43] the guys uh let's read Exodus chapter 12
[8:48] verse 47 and to 49.
[8:51] and this is God's promise to the
[8:53] strength
[8:55] Exodus chapter 12
[8:58] 47-49.
[9:08] okay
[9:13] he's talking about the um
[9:15] the Passover
[9:17] verse 48 and when a stranger uh 47 all
[9:21] the congregation of Israel should keep
[9:23] it
[9:26] When a Stranger with he and we'll keep
[9:29] the Passover to the Lord let all his
[9:30] males be circumcised and then let him
[9:32] come near and keep it and he shall be
[9:35] the one that is born in the land
[9:37] for no uncircumcised people should
[9:39] person shall eat their uh one law shall
[9:42] be to him that is home born and unto the
[9:44] stranger that sojourneth among you
[9:46] so the stranger that comes and takes the
[9:48] Passover is just like someone that's
[9:50] born in the land
[9:51] Isaiah 56.
[10:14] Isaiah 56 verse 3.
[10:18] neither let the son of the stranger that
[10:20] had joined himself to the Lord's speech
[10:22] saying the Lord hath utterly separated
[10:24] me from his people
[10:26] there's no reason for you to say that
[10:28] the Lord hath others has separated me
[10:29] from his people if you've joined
[10:30] yourself to the Lord
[10:32] neither let the eunuch say behold I'm a
[10:34] dry tree
[10:35] well let's see if the Lord unto the
[10:37] units to keep my Sabbath and choose the
[10:38] things that please me and take hold of
[10:40] my Covenant even of them unto them will
[10:41] I give in my house and within my walls
[10:43] police in a name better than a Sons and
[10:46] Daughters I will give them an
[10:47] everlasting name that shall not be cut
[10:49] off
[10:50] also the sons of the stranger that join
[10:52] themselves to the Lord to serve him and
[10:54] to love the name of the Lord to be his
[10:56] servants everyone that keepeth the
[10:57] Sabbath for polluting it and taketh hold
[10:59] of my Covenant even then will I bring to
[11:01] my Holy Mountain and make them joyful In
[11:03] My House of Prayer their burnt offerings
[11:05] and their sacrifices shall be accepted
[11:07] upon my altar from my house shall be
[11:09] called in House of Prayer for all people
[11:11] now
[11:17] now let's take a look
[11:19] we know that uh
[11:21] when the children of Israel came to
[11:23] qadesh Barnett
[11:25] everyone uh
[11:28] everyone agreed that there was no way
[11:30] that they could take the land of the
[11:31] promises who God were not true
[11:34] except for two men Joshua and Caleb and
[11:37] I believe it was copper Caleb that
[11:39] represented the Bible they they say
[11:41] whoever to represent the tribe of Judah
[11:42] I believe that's right
[11:44] um
[11:45] so let's take a second to look at Caleb
[11:47] and see what his genealogy looked like
[11:51] in Genesis 15 18 19 God uh
[11:56] I'm going to be reading a lot of
[11:58] scriptures so if y'all built on
[12:01] what we do okay
[12:04] yes hey that's okay you okay
[12:19] in the same day this is God's promise to
[12:21] Abraham that in the same day the Lord
[12:23] made a covenant with Abram saying unto
[12:25] thy seed have I given this land from the
[12:27] river of Egypt unto the Great River the
[12:29] river Euphrates the kinites and the
[12:31] Kennedy's and the cabinets we'll just
[12:33] stop right there remember the kennesaws
[12:35] because God is saying you're gonna
[12:38] you're gonna be conquerors of these
[12:41] people
[12:42] the numbers 14 6.
[12:46] numbers 14 6.
[12:53] you know Ben you can finish next time
[12:57] I'm open on Netflix
[12:59] how are you really thinking
[13:04] I'll be at Dutch College next week
[13:08] and uh number 14 6 and Joshua the son of
[13:12] none
[13:13] but then Caleb the son of jafuna which
[13:16] one of them that search the land rent
[13:18] their clothes
[13:19] the son of jafana who is this
[13:21] number 32 verse 12.
[13:36] save
[13:41] and Joshua the son of nun for they have
[13:44] holy followed the Lord
[13:46] they have Holy Father the Lord
[13:49] that's uh numbers 32 verse 22.
[13:54] so Caleb the son of jafana the Kennedy
[13:57] now uh First Chronicles 4 does not where
[14:00] it lists don't turn there but at least
[14:03] the ancestry of jafuna and Caleb but
[14:06] it's broken it doesn't tell the whole
[14:08] story somewhere along the line he came
[14:10] from someone called uh he was born of
[14:13] jafana called uh from from who was a
[14:17] Kennedy
[14:18] uh now a lot of people if you read what
[14:21] they say about the Kinesis they uh
[14:23] connect them with Esau's grandson canaz
[14:26] who was one of his 12 to 12 uh
[14:30] Lords of Edom and they they connect that
[14:33] I I can't find anywhere to connect that
[14:35] but we know that
[14:37] calo's ancestry is
[14:40] it doesn't have a direct line background
[14:43] anyone
[14:46] everyone impressive let's drive that way
[14:50] but and uh
[14:53] Deuteronomy 135 36.
[14:59] Deuteronomy chapter one
[15:02] one
[15:05] verse 35 and 36.
[15:18] then we get God's promise
[15:21] which is surely there shall not one of
[15:23] these men of this evil generation see
[15:25] that good land which I swear to give
[15:26] unto your father save Caleb and Son of
[15:29] father he shall see it that's him will I
[15:31] give the land that he hath trotted upon
[15:33] and to his children because he hath holy
[15:36] followed the Lord not because of his
[15:37] ancestry or anything he had to boast of
[15:39] who calls he hath holy followed the Lord
[15:43] now Rahab everybody's familiar with the
[15:46] scripture where the Canaanites came from
[15:48] and Genesis 9 25 I said cursed be Canaan
[15:51] a servant of servant shall he be unto
[15:53] his brother right and we were talking
[15:55] last time about how Rahab saw all the
[15:57] children of Israel coming through and
[15:59] she uh
[16:01] saw the pillar of fire and the Ark of
[16:03] the Covenant and signs with the signs
[16:05] and wonders in their midst and she knew
[16:07] that these people had something that she
[16:09] wanted
[16:10] and this is her testimony and Joshua
[16:13] Joshua the second chapter
[16:16] verses 9 to 13. and she said unto the
[16:20] men
[16:21] I know that the Lord hath given you the
[16:23] land and that your Terror has fallen
[16:25] upon us
[16:26] at that all the inhabitants of the land
[16:28] faint because of you for we have heard
[16:30] how the Lord dried up the water of the
[16:32] Red Sea for you when you came out of
[16:34] Egypt and what you did unto the two
[16:36] kings of the amorites that were on the
[16:38] other side of Jordan cyphon and all whom
[16:40] he utterly destroyed and as soon as we
[16:42] had heard these things our hearts didn't
[16:44] melt neither did they remain any more
[16:45] courage than any man because of you for
[16:47] the Lord your God he is God in heaven
[16:50] above and in Earth beneath
[16:53] she knew that was God now therefore I
[16:56] pray you swear unto me by the Lord since
[16:58] I showed you kindness that you will also
[17:01] show kindness into my father's house
[17:03] and give me a true token and that you'll
[17:07] save me alive save a lie of my father
[17:08] and my mother and my brother and my
[17:10] sisters and all that they have and
[17:11] deliver our lives and death
[17:14] so Rahab
[17:17] now think about this
[17:19] all of the Canaanites perished and they
[17:22] had a mandate from God the Israelites
[17:24] did to go into the land and destroy all
[17:26] the Canaanites the walls from Jericho
[17:29] came down around her but she was the
[17:31] only one saved not just out of Jericho
[17:32] but out of the whole land because she
[17:35] looked and she said that those people
[17:37] have something that I want
[17:39] not because of her genealogy but because
[17:41] she believed
[17:42] but watch
[17:45] watch how God injected her into the
[17:47] genealogy because look at who she and
[17:50] the Israeli General produced exactly I
[17:54] know
[17:54] because David come from that woman
[17:57] exactly I'm getting there
[18:04] right yeah yeah and uh so all right so
[18:09] Rahab married a man in uh Joshua's Army
[18:12] named salmon and they had a little boy
[18:14] named Boaz yep
[18:17] and we'll get into that let's turn to
[18:18] Deuteronomy 23 verse 3.
[18:24] now up to this point we don't have any
[18:26] scripture that says because geniality
[18:29] you can't come into the congregation of
[18:31] the Lord but
[18:33] now we do Deuteronomy 23 3.
[18:38] and ammonite or moabite shall not enter
[18:41] into the congregation
[18:43] even to their 10th Generation shall they
[18:45] not enter into the congregation of the
[18:47] Lord
[18:47] forever
[18:49] well that presents the problem because
[18:51] our roof is a robot
[18:54] now
[18:55] a lot of people if you look at what
[18:58] Scholars and whatnot say that the
[19:00] congregation of the Lord they say that
[19:02] that's just uh like a Judicial part of
[19:06] the uh part of Israel and
[19:08] um that only men can be part of it and
[19:11] whatnot let's see what brother Randolph
[19:12] said about the congregation of the Lord
[19:14] and if you go up to uh
[19:17] could you read the verse try before that
[19:20] verse one dude uh the second verse that
[19:22] talks about a bachelor born child
[19:24] a bastard shot enter into the
[19:26] congregation of the Lord even to his
[19:28] 10th Generation shall he not enter into
[19:30] the congregation of the Lord
[19:33] let's see what brother REM said about
[19:35] that
[19:37] uh it wasn't so from the beginning e48
[19:40] and hybriding was such a horrible thing
[19:42] in the Old Testament
[19:44] he said a bastard child shall not enter
[19:46] into the congregation of the Lord for 10
[19:48] Generations
[19:49] there's nothing to breed him out only
[19:51] that sin think 10 Generations 400 years
[19:54] before legitimate child could ever come
[19:56] into the kingdom of God there was no
[20:00] serum to take care of him he had to just
[20:02] breed it out through the family 400
[20:04] years for an element child could come
[20:06] into the congregation of the lord well I
[20:08] got to make sure I read this part but
[20:10] today
[20:11] says the blood of the Jesus Christ has
[20:14] been shed and you've been interbred by
[20:16] all different kinds of ideas the holy
[20:18] spirit is here this morning to read you
[20:20] back to the original bring you back to
[20:22] Pentecost bring you back and we sit
[20:24] together
[20:25] this morning in Heavenly places in
[20:27] Christ Jesus letting the Holy Spirit
[20:28] work what does circumcising cutting off
[20:31] all the hybrid the Surplus the things of
[20:34] the world the things of the church age
[20:36] bringing us back to Pentecost like it
[20:38] was at the beginning
[20:43] praise the Lord
[20:45] amen
[20:48] now let's uh look at Ruth's confession
[20:51] Ruth chapter 1 verse 15 to 18.
[20:56] what was the sermon that was from
[21:00] that was from uh it wasn't so from the
[21:03] beginning
[21:09] that's also in the 10 verses in the 144
[21:13] 000 Jews paragraph 41 I didn't read that
[21:17] thank you
[21:21] Ruth chapter 1 verse 15 18.
[21:27] foreign
[21:51] this is like the whole uh Genesis 4
[21:54] story all over again you've got someone
[21:56] that's going to believe and someone that
[21:58] won't believe
[21:59] even though they could see the truth
[22:01] right in front of them
[22:03] and unto her God's return now after thy
[22:05] sister-in-law
[22:06] and Ruth said and treat me not to leave
[22:08] you'll return from following after thee
[22:11] for withered thou go a star will go
[22:13] and where thou largest hour Lodge
[22:16] thy people shall be my people
[22:20] and thy God my God
[22:22] no that's it where thou dice will I die
[22:27] and there will I be buried the Lord do
[22:29] so to me and more also if off but death
[22:32] death party in me
[22:34] when she saw that she was steadfastly
[22:36] minded to go with her and then she left
[22:38] speaking under her and now think back to
[22:40] the scripture I read in Exodus about
[22:43] all right and you come in and take
[22:44] communion you are as one born in the
[22:47] land and the Ruth made her confession
[22:49] that your people will be my people so
[22:52] she's counted as one of the Israelites
[22:55] and uh you say well wait Boaz has to
[22:58] Redeemer everything but Ruth chapter 2
[23:00] verse 11 and 12.
[23:05] and Boaz answered
[23:07] it has fully been shown me all that thou
[23:10] has done unto my mother thy
[23:11] mother-in-law since the death of thine
[23:13] husband and how Halal has left thy
[23:15] father and thy mother in the land of the
[23:17] Nativity and not coming to a people
[23:19] which I knew is not here before
[23:21] the Lord recompense thy Work and a full
[23:24] reward beginning of the Lord God of
[23:26] Israel under whose wings thou I come to
[23:29] trust
[23:30] and come to trust the Lord
[23:33] and uh
[23:36] you know think about
[23:38] you know brother Branham talked about
[23:39] his mobile preachers
[23:42] because they they're still in Moab
[23:44] they're still part of that they're uh if
[23:47] you think about are you
[23:49] what's your nationality are you still an
[23:51] American are you still aware of you came
[23:54] from my wife came from Romania is she
[23:57] still Romanian let's see what brother
[23:58] Randall said about that did you ever
[24:00] chase that word down he didn't believeth
[24:02] on me has everyone has eternal life
[24:05] if you'll take that out of the Greek
[24:06] it's the word Zoe which means God's own
[24:08] life and you you are no longer yourself
[24:10] but you're a child of God here a few
[24:12] weeks ago my wife sitting right there
[24:14] back there she and I was going to a
[24:15] grocery store to get some groceries and
[24:17] I was amazed to find one lady with a
[24:19] skirt on and I said maybe what about
[24:21] that she said what I'm asking you Bill
[24:23] said you come back from overseas you say
[24:26] they do this in France they do that in
[24:27] England they do this in another place is
[24:30] this what they do in America I said
[24:32] that's the spirit of me I said aren't we
[24:34] Americans I said no she said what are we
[24:38] German I said no what are we I said we
[24:41] are pilgrims and strainers I said that's
[24:44] the reason that American Spirit is on
[24:46] our women they don't do those things on
[24:48] our men they don't drink I'm Brethren
[24:50] and things like that the American Spirit
[24:52] drinks that's a national Spirit every
[24:55] nation is governed by the devil the
[24:57] Bible says so if Satan said these
[24:59] kingdoms are my I'll do with them
[25:01] whatever I want to
[25:04] now I wanted to talk quickly too just
[25:07] briefly about the Samaritans because the
[25:10] Samaritans are another people that have
[25:13] a horrible genealogy in the Jews
[25:15] actually to this day uh treat them
[25:19] very poorly uh at the Jews and during
[25:23] Jesus time were
[25:25] the Samaritans were almost like it was
[25:27] like a
[25:31] let me go back and talk a little bit
[25:33] about whether Samaritans came from the
[25:34] Samaritans came from the when the Syrian
[25:36] came and conquered uh some cities in
[25:38] Israel they uh sent a lot of their
[25:42] people to live in the in the cities that
[25:44] they had conquered and so over time it
[25:47] became a mixture like they became
[25:48] hybrids so they were parked Jews and
[25:51] part uh Assyrians and other other
[25:54] nations that lived there and so over
[25:56] time they still believed God they
[25:59] believed the same Jehovah that the Jews
[26:01] believed and kept many of the same
[26:03] beliefs but uh because of their
[26:06] miscellaneous the Jews just began to
[26:09] despise them and um
[26:13] at the time by the time of Jesus they
[26:16] were it was like a
[26:19] the early uh part of this the last
[26:21] century where in America where you know
[26:23] the blacks and the whites didn't talk to
[26:25] one another that was the same thing
[26:28] what's going on then like uh the woman
[26:32] at the well was a Samaritan when she
[26:34] came to Jesus she said it's not
[26:35] customary for a Jew to talk to a
[26:38] Samaritan because it was such a it was
[26:41] like a racial divide there's Samaritans
[26:43] were treated as dirty
[26:45] they don't have any kind of lineage with
[26:47] us
[26:48] so think about all the Samaritans when
[26:50] when they said Jesus tell us about what
[26:52] a neighbor is
[26:54] he kind of threw it back in their face
[26:55] now let me I'll tell you what a neighbor
[26:57] is and he told him the story of that
[26:58] good samaritan
[27:00] the the only leper of the ten lepers
[27:03] that were healed the remember only one
[27:05] return and it was a Samaritan
[27:08] so those think about that how that God
[27:11] it's just beautiful how the people that
[27:14] were despised he used them to show his
[27:18] grace amen
[27:26] and that's all I have on that
[27:28] I guess next time we'll
[27:31] move on to the next verse from Genesis
[27:33] of course
[27:35] and such the word pilgrim who are
[27:38] pilgrims appeal green is somebody who's
[27:41] left their country that has not arrived
[27:43] where they're going they're in the
[27:45] middle
[27:47] thank you we haven't arrived yet
[27:54] thank you
