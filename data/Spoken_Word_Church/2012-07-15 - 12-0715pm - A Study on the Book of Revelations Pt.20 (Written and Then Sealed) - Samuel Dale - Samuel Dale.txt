we had a real good time yesterday at the ministers meeting very useful I think to help understand some of the things and all and the brothers were all speaking very nicely about the situations and all like that of what people are believing now blood around them you know uh was hunting on the wrong dates and stuff like that and you know it's just I don't know it's just the devil in this hour trying to break down everything he can that's right you know and if that's all he can attack right it's something like that then you know I praise the Lord amen that's all you know and my brother used to trying to pick on me one time and he couldn't find a tickle on me about it he started on my family so I said well okay you know the Lord take care of that but let's just read her let's pray and read her scripture and get right into her thought and carry on and be much in prayer for Brother Bill and image or traveling and the next uh Minister's meeting will be there brother Billy Ocean a couple of months and it will be on one of my favorite topics it will be on annual 70 weeks and we've used to come and wait a night to speak you know they let you speak like 45 minutes or an hour and then uh go

scene and speak to each one of our hearts and life that's really Tim and brother yes build our Lord as you're traveling giving them a safe journey Lord home let all be well we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 1-3 and into first Peter the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said and signified it by his Angel and to his servant John who by record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep watching that keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand all right now we'll go over to first Peter one and nine receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls of which salvation and Prophets have inquired and searched diligently who prophesy out of the grace that should come unto you search in what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they administer the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you by the Holy Ghost sit down from heaven which things the Angels desire to look into wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word trying to speak on the revelation of Jesus Christ because that's what the whole book is we're speaking on your book and trying to you know bring some things out and get some understanding opponent and uh now we we spent some time this past uh Wednesday night talking about kinsman redeemer and we didn't finish that we just brought it up into a point to put your minds to thinking and we will get to that later more of the kingsman the Redeemer and talk about that but what are we saying now we went through chapter four you know you know four chapter of Revelations and saw all of the things and the symbols and the understandings and the things and then uh we have come now to the fifth chapter and uh dealing then with this fifth chapter we uh are trying to look and see more about where we're at and what we're doing so if you will brother go ahead and pull up the revelations 5 and we'll read that we want to speak on more on it but it's just something struck me and I've I've got to try to cover this to be able to get on to another but in Revelations 5 1 it says and I saw in the right hand of him that said on my Throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals right and then you go through a strong Angel proclaiming and and the different things but the main part is to get to where it says in one of the elders verse 5 saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof now I don't know we talk about this past Wednesday you know that the that there was a throne when sitting on the Drone and then there was a book in the right hand of the one that was sitting upon the throne and we covered giving brother Branham a paragraph 116-118 of the breach I wish you would read the breach over and over you know and and look at it and see what he's talking about and read if you get a change or listen to the tape of Revelations chapter 4 and chapter 5 preached back about 61. and and it would really help you to understand the things I'm trying to bring out but we saw that that book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne was the abstract titled deed to eternal life and the Earth and all of the things you know and it was uh it was the book of redemption all right and we saw then as we went along we got to paragraph 267 of the church age book our sardines in ages where it's really that it found that there was only names written in that book all right but then we spent the time trying to bring it down as we read them from the prophet where he said there were only names written in the book and then he said it was the Bible all right then we were trying to bring out to to get us to understand that the Bible then would be the Book of Life and that would have in that book of life a record of that name that was in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation world and in the hand of the one on the throne that the Bible then would be bringing it down to show the life or the what's going on in the world and and things while that name would be here you know that would be just the book of names all right and see then it would be the Bible in the Bible then it would be the Book of Life all right and it would have two sections to it which would be the Eternal section which is the Lamb's Book of Life you know Eternal section and then it would be the book of life which is a record upon Earth of our lives and what's going on so then you can call it the Bible and that's fine because that's that's what it is it's that do it but we found then we got down to just a hit and misses the last and run around and said on paragraph 75 of the breach he said now that book is sealed and said you're sealed with a book all right all right now this is something that I've been driving at so I want you to pay close attention for a few minutes of what that I'm speaking then to break the seals I know it reveals what has been what is and what shall come and reveals the whole plan reveal to all of the because it's in the Bible the whole Plan of Redemption everything coming forth but you think about it if the book is sealed and you're sealed in the book what is he talking about you're sealed with the book the book be in the Bible or the book being the the book of redemption all right and see it's sealed right all right and you're sealed with a book amen right so then to break the seals that I've tried my best to express to you for 40-something years in early 40 years at least that the seals is not the revealing of the Antichrist amen the seals is a revealing of Jesus Christ amen it doesn't even read in Revelations 1 you know where it says that the Revelation that God gives of Jesus of the Antichrist and it doesn't even speak of that that's what everybody's trying to find or see or what it is me and they're trying to make the seals and the things being the revealing of the Antichrist well that's not true it's revealing of Jesus Christ amen amen all right see then if if it's true what the prophet had to say that the brightest part of the book the price of Mr God revealed and she's to be revealed amen and he's not complete without you I still got some of these things to bring a little in a later message remember I said to God he is not complete without you all right in that book that's there is a book of names through your name is in the book all right now we know it's not Samuel Dale written out because that's not the name that I had before the foundation in the world that was the name My Mother and Daddy gave me Samuel coming from my daddy's Named Sam and Dale being your family name you know right we see the book The Prophet said it's not Arman Neville it is but it's what's going on my arm and Neville is upon the Earth he said then that means your name is in the book all right now and that name being in the book see then if if you're sealed with a book then why would people have trouble with me trying to explain that the the seals is not the reveal in the Antichrist it's a reveal of Jesus Christ and to break the seals doesn't reveal the devil right it revealed Jesus Christ and where he's at amen that's right and what's important I was trying to get across Wednesday night you're sealed with the book all right so to take the seals off the book then it would be revealing you amen it's revealing your name right that's right that's right right he said no no it's just revealing Jesus Christ well that's exactly right because we are Jesus Christ made manifest yes George Paul says Christ in you the hope of glory amen all right so then the bride being part of the book me choose to be revealed so then we're looking at the Book of Revelation to find ourselves right right it's the revelation of Jesus Christ but it's the revelation of Jesus Christ now where he's at right well they gave you the quote what around said it's not just a revealing of Jesus Christ as being God is it but it's the revealing of Jesus Christ in you right amen so you see ourselves and who we are all right yeah in doing that being there's something I want to get across tonight don't worry about the kinsman redeemer now we will get back to that more when we come to the lamb part of it all right but I want to think a little more about that book you know about these things now this may be and sound odd and simple but yet think on it why is it that the book was not taken in the days of Luther Wesley or Pentecost or whatever are you listening amen so I like to ask questions in that way you're thinking see it's because the book wasn't finished right right see our age was not finished now so the lamb can't take the book until the book is finished that's why I asked you the other day you know these people would say oh in 1963 oh the seals broke to the prophet Redemption was over well then most of us are lost yeah that's right right but see then to think that the reason that it was not finished let your snake with me in 1963 our part your part my part of the book was not finished right amen do you agree yeah keep watching the book that's written about you wasn't written yeah right right so the book wasn't finished see that's why I asked you was Redemption over back then see because as quick as redemption's over then the lamb leaves The Mercy Seat becomes that takes that book and loosens the seals we see the books got to be finished before it can be taken she put it around and was being shown the complete Plan of Redemption past present and future right amen the lamb that leave The Mercy Seat in 63. all right gee if you believe Redemption is still here then the lamb hasn't left the mercy seats yet amen amen but I'd like to put that back in your life you're like yeah not to be sarcastic or hateful but let you think about it amen if he was able to the land left the mercy seat back there in 63. now if he did you're lost because Redemption was over when he leaves The Mercy Seat redemption's over right you agree with that amen right all right keep in the book has got to be completed before the lamb can take the book that's what I'm asking you to read to preach and you'll read these things the prophet would say it like this the book is finished then he said the writing inside then is finished and he said then it's sealed up read the bridge did I say that like that and then I know that a lot of you don't do it because you think you're so smart now some some are just too smart to say that well that's not that's going to read that I don't have time well then there's another group that comes in the middle and says well if I ever do get time I'll read it and the others get well I've done Rich many times don't need to read no more and you won't go home and read it well all right then you want to understand that the prophet is saying the things that I'm saying that's right right amen but see you can't the Kinsmen Redeemer the lamb he can't leave that mercy seat right until the last person that's right it's to be saved comes into the body of Christ that's right keep in the book cannot be taken until it's finished right all right now we read in mark this is Mark what we're off Brothers I don't want to go man Aaron was talking they wrote it at Mark 4 and 28. Jesus is talking about the ear the corner he said and the full corn in the ear now Jesus Christ never went to his death premature right you agree yes yes he was the fully matured seed amen it you agree with that all right see that's why he couldn't be killed when he was in his early Ministry couldn't be touched why because he was not matured all right see it was a fully mature seed that hung on Calvary the word amen all right now so thinking about that think on this point that the book wasn't finished in 63 so how could he take my name in your name had not come forth and some of you may claim Redemption before 63 so you know what I'm talking about I'm talking about as a whole group that most of us came along after 63 to claim our Redemption you know the time of receiving the new birth Etc would be after the 63. but you see then brother Brown is reading the book and being able to look by Revelation into the book and see what will take place he's not telling you what took place in 63. he's telling you what the book says about it just like I was trying to express see then he can tell us what happened in the garden right yep six thousand years ago but he was not back there to see that see the book has got to be completed the last name has got to come in right man before the lamb can leave The Mercy Seat all right see then you see what you're what you're dealing with so I would get away with my ideas or what I used to think because you're saying Redemption was over in 63. then most of the people that would even be listening to what I'm talking about would admit you've got your salvation night for 63 so you'd be saying right and get saved amen that's right you see the book's not complete yet right it was written back there in the Bible that when the towers fall then the light of the moon will be the light of the light in the Moon being the light in the Sun and you'll be it's going to be seven times see then there was no way for the world to come you know the Gentile dispensation as we talk about her situation to come to an end until that took place right right right then you had a Watergate that they stood before the Watergate and read the word wordings right out of the Bible that couldn't be until you know I mean it had to come to buy stuff on the Earth right right right put in the book wasn't complete until that happened Larry are you listening I mean are you paying attention to what I'm trying to say keep in until the book is completed all names are brought in then the lamb can leave The Mercy Seat amen but if they one name today that's not brought into the body of Christ the lamb is still on the Versace scene that's right we see something else have to happen yep if something else has to happen if the book is sealed and the prophet's right when he said the book is sealed and you're sealed with the book well see then the breaking of the seals would be revealing your name right your time upon Earth but the book listen the book has to be completed and then it's sealed right that's how the book winds up sealed if when the life's Redemptive name comes in then the book is sealed you remember how we tried to go through Jeremiah join it when it would go down into bondage and they take the Earthly vessels and they would put the Deeds you would call them today down in there the the thing that would describe the property and they would wind up then when they came back out of captivity they could take out those Scrolls you know in those those paperwork out of the the Earth and vessels and read who owns what property right and then we talked about where the prophet of God said that that was held in an Earthly vessel that was once made flesh amen right right man it was once made flesh and came upon the Earth all right now if that be true then the prophet would be right in what he says he said when he walked the shores of Galilee we was in him come on now we was in him back there or we never will be in him right that's right all right so then all in the Plan of Redemption was sealed up in Jesus Christ amen so then you and I were still up in Jesus Christ amen not these bodies you're looking at the eternal life of those Genesis 1 26 and 27 beings are Galatians 3 16. the being which is the crisis set in Galatians 3 16. so then when Jesus walked the shores of Galilee we were in him not his people right but the eternal life that he had trouble and that was sealed up in that vessel all right now then once it was sealed up see then you had to get it out of there right right sure if we was in him things are ought to be I run said we was in him yep and if it was Jesus was the fullness of the godhead of God excuse me fullness of God manifested he was the fullness of the godhead bodily now listen to it therefore when he came to the Earth and was manifested in flesh you were here in him then because he was the word in the beginning was the word word with God when he walked here we were in him we suffered when we died all right no we see we were sealed up nice wording we were not there as people we were part of that eternal life that was living within him all right but see there was a little a little more connection than just talking about it because of the next statements your Prophet makes go ahead to number two brother which is questions and answers book 1 1964 8 23. God opened up the side of Jesus at Calvary and took out the bride yes and when Jesus died at Calvary remember the bride was taken from the body excuse me and the bride was not taken from the body until the body was dead right so we were already redeemed in him huh I don't want him to get into that part wanting to get into the part of talking about that we were sealed up in him you agree that he was John 1 1. right the beginning was to work Word was God in the word verse 14 which made flesh and dwell among us we bailed him as the only begotten of the father he was made flesh but around said he is those seals you remember we gave it to you the other day the boat was sealed that's why they couldn't understand him when he was here on Earth she was sealed away from the people that they couldn't comprehend the Darian or Earthly vessel was almighty God and the complete Plan of Redemption could dwell in that human vessel run around and said everything Adam lost Jesus Christ redeemed amen right but she to get us out you had to break the seal and it appears to the side of the Lord Jesus amen for the bride to be able to come forth amen amen right yeah right now he was the complete word yes right then he could be sealed up he was the complete ear of corn right the fully maturity or corn he was a seed that went into the ground and quoted scriptures right and he was sealed up because nobody couldn't see him that's right they couldn't see God was sealed up inside of a man he could tell him who he was unless you believe that I am he they couldn't see it all right so then when the bus was finished they couldn't touch him until it was done and yeah but the work was done the word was finished he had fulfilled all the words and then he paid the price the bride was in him at that time right right and she was released from his body that she could come forth then in a what in a mini-membered body he stood and said Lester corn of wheat Falls died into the ground you know he'll abide alone that's right now you don't plant immature corn right you go down to the grocery store and you look there on the shelf and it's got four for a dollar and you got corn there boy you shook that off man that's delicious but don't try to plant it right yes that's right that's right it's not in the stage yet that's right see go to the corner weed had to die and go into the ground before he could come forth in a multiple form then the word that he had gave them at Pentecost for them to understand I ain't got time to explain that point anybody don't tell you what it's happened borrow the point Didn't that that fully material word went into the ground at and I see a council but when Luther came forth it was only two little shoots got it you can't gather it when it's two little shoots thank you ain't much hard to eat then he found a shark you go out and look at the show oh I got corn oh even when you go out there and see a full ear it's ready to eat you can't plant it that's right that's why Jesus said to four horn in the ear do you have to be mature before he could be crucified the book of him and his life had to be written within him he was the word then he could be sealed all right now then what about you and I you see why this thing could never happen until the end time look there was two little shoots come up that's right that's not fully mature Wesley was the title to different things you know that's not fully material Pentecost Azusa Street Pentecost was the ship that shelters the corn and at that stage the prophet said you could go down in that wheat and look at it and he said they're in that wheat there's a little bitty bud or if you were talking about it your corn he said don't even look but then you got to wait until it comes on over into around here or see in this part of the country it's long and about October November and you can gather the corn but still even if you're not real careful you've got to take the corn off the stalk before it matures enough to be able to make cornmeal you can't just go out there and look and see it on the stalk and say well that looks good that's that's going to look like it's dried up it still has a certain greenness to it right right we don't pull it right then take it down to the cornmeal make you gotta wait until it's fully dried so now you understand it that's why the lamb can't take the book until the word is fully matured even though all members could be in even though salvation could be there and coming to a close you still know how the dryness of the Corn are you listening you gotta have the fully material to your corn right before you can even talk about it sealed and what did we read in Revelations 5 1. a book in his hand and the book was what sealed so you got to wait until he comes to a full maturity and run around said that's where our problem is he said we gotta lay in the presence of the Sun to get out all of the witness another word that's right we were over in the Philippines and I thought it kind of odd but you know they got kind of like we have maybe a five foot section on the sides of the roads that you know it's kind of paved or asphalt on it we were going down through there I was looking like when you done went by and seen all these big granaries where they were you know doing just tons and tons of wheat because they do a lot of wheat there in the Philippines I look alongside the road you know what they were out there on the side of the road right where the car is driving right by because every day they were allowed to take home a certain amount that was their pay a lot of them didn't get money they could take wheat home with them but see the wheat even though it'd been gathered it was still not matured to make bread right so you know what they would do they'd live right down the side of the road and you just drive my and on both sides of the road it's just wheat let on that like a little five foot section on each side of the road I looked down I said what are they doing said they're drying the wheat the that's their pay for the day and sit there drying the wheat to where they can grind it in to make flour because I always wondered how it worked out you know when they got all that stuff going out there you've ever seen where they're doing a lot of it and especially in in the graineries or something they got an old Ox pulling the thing going around and just crushing it in paint well now you know what that dogs does ever once in a while right well he's at your dinner will that work yeah all right wake you up okay but you see the weights got to be fully matured even when it's gathered it is still not at the point the word that you can replant it right then go to the heaven and drive enough now I know a lot of you thinking oh I just seen the kitchen I've seen that my brother howl and us can talk about it he's back there he knows I know exactly what I'm saying because you don't go out there when you take the corn off at the end of the year you know and take it and say boy I got it ready to plant no it has to lay through the winter dries out then it gets bigger the next year you're capable of planting right are you listening amen Jesus was the fully matured seed all right now he was promised to come from Genesis to be the seed of the woman like and become a fully mature she but at the same time there was a promise back there I brought around and said that the word would return this is in the first seal third seal basically more that starts in the first but it's basically in the third because you see Church if you and I you see what's putting this thing off you see what the trouble is not laying in the presence of the sun to wrap it we're running with things and trying to keep everything alive and going I should but I want the maturity amen then when the maturity comes you don't want to shout but you know how to shout then you know what you're shouting about wonderful me like I told Brother Bill there today is you know what I've told you that I've been in a Revival ever since I've been in this message but for two years now I've been praying for God to send a Revival in this church right here that's not a worldwide sweeping Revival is it I'm not looking for something like that yeah run around and said he'd take those seven unknown Thunders to wake up the bride for a Revival you see why it's took so long to preach the word is to try to put the word in to get it every bit into exactly the place it's supposed to be right and to realize that Luther Wesley and MC was partial realization for their days right yes amen the bride must come forth yes and the purity of the word that she could be the word because when we go into rapture it would be capable of taking what's in going in the Rapture you know taking us up like that in a change that part that's coming to the last would be capable of being replanted amen because it's going to be fully matured word but it won't be because we're going up all right amen see we had to be taken then out of his side the calvary because we're the seed s right we we we're the ones that's going into the ground right the Holy Ghost never went the ground right right it's the word or seed that was going to go into the ground in the Dark Ages and then come forward but see a promise the word would come to full maturity again gee when the book is completed then it's sealed that's right then the lamb can take it and break the seal yes come on okay right well it's just too much to think about why I'll give you the pulpit women anybody could let you explain it come on now I'm not sarcastic not hateful it's just truthful that's right I've studied for 40 something years about a message been ridiculed of all forms of trying to preach the word and keep it word word word word and not far after all of these garbage can doctrines just went around the message and try to stay with the word and been ridiculed and very unpopular around the people of the message for being the fact that I've tried to stay with the word when you write a document you know you're writing a story doing whatever you're writing the document and then you seal it right you know it's not rolled it up but it's a seal it's a segment a signature once you're finishing up with you know the book is finished you write your name to it you're sealing the book that book is not supposed to be used by anyone else it's a copyrighted and all of those words that you put with it amen you know until this book is completely written it can't be single that's right and until it's sealed it can't be unsealed you see why it wouldn't have worked in the days of Lutheran Wesleyan Pentecost yes and we're not fully material words they had the word of the rage thank God they're part of the Bride but this end time Friday's got to come back to the pure word unadulterated your Prophet would say from any Creed man look at number three she's taken from the Easter seal right at 119. you talking about the ceiling the carbox and all of the different things and then it sealed to its destination any seal is a is finished work when you write a document then it's sealed at the end never sealed until it's finished you need a document this is a document this is the Bible this is the word of God the next one evening messenger look what he says you talk about each age having a messenger and all coming down look what he says but it was sealed on the back side of the book the Seven Seals was on the backside of the book and actually before the ceiling broke remember this is 11 16 and 63. they opened in in uh March all right January you know this is January but to see what's broken and Mark that's right now watch what he said the seven seal thrown on the backside of the book after the book is written all right now is that what I've been saying all right amen after the book is written and it's sealed back there were seven seals and no one knows what they are see but in the days of the voice of the Seven Angels right but the book has got to be written ready to breach it's got to be written then it's sealed see that's one that you're looking at this and so I didn't know the book was sealed up why I've been able to read it ever since I was in the Baptist Church well I got four gold stars for reading in one year huh I didn't know it was sealed you know your Prophet didn't know it was sealed I didn't bring that one but you ought to know it he thought he preached it in the in the 50s there and up in the early 60s of the Seven Seals yeah you want to imagine sure supplies where he said I didn't even know the books and nobody knew the book was was a single book right we thought Jesus at Calvary paid the price opened the book we can read all of it right right now is that not to come the comprehension that you get of most people in the message and where they are that's nice you talk about a seal book why do you need to see a book The book's been open what bro did don't you understand it was opening profit in 63. boo can't see on no more I'm sorry I know that I'm hateful about the things but telling me whether it's the truth or not just because that Prophet preached it in 63 you hadn't even heard it until 85 or 90. and yet the book was opened it's only open to the prophet right right he was talking about it last night it got over there at the end of it run around and said said don't give me questions on anything he said I won't question on the seals only he got his questions and he was looking at the questions there was one question asked about the seals the man of sin sitting in the temple of God showing himself to be as God was at the first seal and he said yes the rest of it should we wear pantyhose or what about water baptism or what about this you know and that's what he'd come out and said you know what he said it's gone from you he saw his wife said last night he saw the questions it would ask so he knew it was gone from the people said run around the company with the Lord but she did we know when we was an organized religion that there was a sealed book even though we could read there were seven seals right but we didn't know the book was sealed and we definitely didn't know we were sealed with the book right Oh you mean that's making too much out the bush and my brother Bill said this morning ain't making a knife all right amen amen right that's right amen I'll see you on the book it's got to be completed before it can be sealed all the names had to be made manifest on Earth I'm quoting from the breach if you'll read it you'll hear it all the names had to be made manifest before the lamb could take the book so then it says one name left is not redeemed today but lamb ain't left The Mercy Seat that's right amen how close will that be that's right I quoted last night the brother questioned me about it so I said Hey brother Joe how about running it up guys remember I said I don't know how many be saved in that last moment to Rapture the church you can run it up brother Joe bring it on out if you can I know we can find it in the flash but he found it last night for me I appreciate these brothers that are sitting around making this that's right better run said I don't know how many you'll be saved we say Oh No Redemption is going to be over and then all these things are going to happen where did she get all those things from it's because you're already in and you ain't worried about nobody else but if you don't get nothing out of the message don't get one thing the book has got to be completed every name has got to be make manifest and redeemed before the the book can be sealed up now to be a complete book before it can be sealed up then it comes it's got to be sealed up before it can be unsealed that's right even if you want to leave off the ceiling of the book you got you know one plain common sense the book has got to be complete every name has got to be there before it can be taken sure absolutely even if you don't like my other ways of bringing punishments you know it can't be taken until every name is made to manifest that's right well then why are we looking at it thinking order maybe the Redemption was Lord see that scares people and that makes people say well I don't know where to try or not you see why I'm against those things so much people say well I don't know where to try or not I don't know where to see God or not Redemption was over at 63. mother you know Brothers know all the people pleasing yeah not like we've coming in the back door here to church one time this brother you good old brother but we're gonna have communion that day and I'm gonna back back here you know on our deal you got it let me get with my won't forget he's coming in the door this brother I had brought out the cups you know the individual cups I know that there are a lot of people in like that's all right we'll take it either way you want it this church folks that one cup well one cup folks how many well how many no problem but the brother he said brother Dale all the Believers in the message just have one cup well Boy you know you could spend well when I get through this because it I knew brother mulchman was dying brother Thomas and then was there they took communion and Tabernacle with many cups I knew all of that I could argue but the man that was saying it to me had been to the Tabernacle you burn around him personally but he said all the Believers use one cup I just opened the door and let him go on in I said we believe a little bit of it around here I wasn't going to argue with him about nothing because it wouldn't be no need of it but look what he says this is the message Christ The Mystery of God revealed 1963 7.8 after the seals broke after this all of the people said Redemption is over and there's nothing here look what he says paragraph 227. I don't say there's going to be ex-olds today now I don't get that all wrong I never said that I don't know how many is to be going to be saved in that that that's the the last moment to Rapture that little group you'll be a small group you say you mean you still think Redemption is for people amen that's right amen why would I preach salvation if I didn't that's right believe it right but get the point now it's not the book it's got to be completed before the lamb can take the book it's got to be the fully matured word and you and I are gonna have to give birth to that all right let's get into the message look at number five brother putting Bobby back there I think with it presuming 62-16 morning service Mondays we get a bunch of denominations this time out of this revival we sold denominational seed what we need today brother you can say what you want to about it we need the gospel pure holy unadulterated word of God song and when this light comes on it it'll bring forth that church God's predestinated amen don't presume about nothing take God's word and move right on he promised he'd be here he's here amen yep if that ain't shown down in the bride where are we going look at the next one paragraph four 12 of Christ the mystery God revealed Revelation is not known by denomination he is known by Revelation excuse me revelation God is not known by denomination he's known by Revelation look God in his body Christ and Christ in his body the bride oh my God God made manifest in Christ Christ made manifest in the bride and as God took from the body of Adam the woman she failed then God has took from the body of Christ his flesh his body which is his word and is bringing a bride out of that that won't call for denominational Creed no sir but she's coming back with a pure unadulterated word of God being manifested amen that's what's up for me and you did amen amen right right these are for me and you to do okay I'm right excuse number seven a lot of these are some deferred single except you go read it the third seed will be 963 1963 320. all right about 97. now but God full of Mercy made a way to redeem that woman and now he promised her telling her that sometime in the future the true word would come to her again the true word will be made known to her now remember that because he promised Christ through the woman and Christ is the word all right so now Jesus Christ a fulfillment of the promise great to come right but that's not all the promise now just keep on going number eight she owned the third seal now we noticed that God told Eve and after so long a Time the word is coming back to you now how did she fall I want my class to say it what did she fall from what did he fall from the word is that right the word and God said he'd make a way to redeem her back to the word again all right after so long a Time the word would be known to her again the word would come for that purpose that's Jesus Christ right right come on down to the next one still on the third seal hold tight now what I'm saying the word would come for her for one purpose that was for Redemption all right but until until then she had a substitute now what's that word that would would work that would work until the time arrived for the original word now the substitute with the blood of bulls and goats right right but now remember you're gonna come over to church age in just a minute you told her the word would come to her again but until that times he gave her a substitute until that time arrived so he gave her an offering to make a substitute for that blood now the blood of Bloods and goats like but it didn't take away her sin all right other than that foreign times that he would or the word would come back to her again now remember you remember that what she lost from it could be restored because there's only one thing and restore and that's the word we're going to the next just getting them lined up let's see here's what we got to do now to save the time in between I'll be glad to show you these but if you'll read the third seal you'll find it you see Luther and Wesley had partial realization of the word right all right Luther Wesley Pinnacle they had a substitute okay not a substitute like substituting this for that the Old Testament was not substituting uh uh garbage cans and then the blood of Jesus Christ it was the blood of the animal and then Jesus Christ was the blood of a human right so when the church ages it was a substitute the word for the age was substitute because it was not in its fullness it was not a fully matured word or seed so it couldn't go into the ground but then it's got to come back in the end time to be the fully matured seed in you and I until here's what we've got to do now what are we to do that's to make sure God revealed what but she's coming back with a pure unadulterated word of God being manifested who's coming back today going to the next you must be born again 61 12 31 see what he knew you might know the false teachers will bring false birth true prophets will bring the word the birth of the word Christ false prophets will bring false birth the birth of churches the birth of Creeds the birth of denominations and things that's what they bring look at the next one word is written on 6 62 312 now for the birth of the word is Christ not a polluted with denominations the early church no denomination just the word of God and spirit irrigated brother that God laid the word down like that and the Holy Spirit irrigated and there she went she brought forth children certainly what do we got a house come on today birth pains 65 124. now her messenger is promised in Malachi in the fourth chapter he's promised to do it and the message is to bring back the word bring the people back to the word right birth to be is to be choose to be delivered of a new birth from According to Malachi 4. amen as you're in our job somebody's got to give birth to the seed amen before the book can be sealed and the book ain't sealed it can't be opened all right that's the same one as the paragraph of this same message um birthday the word must deliver the word right Church this progress 178 coming on down for where we would the church has got to be delivered out of her a bride for Christ then that fell asleep in all ages will make up that rides that come out on the word that they come out on like from your feet coming to your head she gets gets greater and the more you have to have and so forth as the body grows up so the body of Christ grow up and then finally the head will come to hit the head will be what it's linked to the Head we got to be capped off sorry another random quote said after the door of the Gentile church is closed God willing on a church he will do in one year what theologist is trying to do in 2000 he's doing it now he said do you and I have got to become the word amen right amen it ain't a choice it ain't a thought or a maybe or a we've got to become the fully matured work we've got to lay in the presence of the sun to write we can't just keep playing around with it let the seed nut put the next one he's not out with a shook 65 to 18. Pentecost stop speaking in tongues what they denied the birth of the word what was the pentecostal's denying his message right okay come on oh it's Pentecostals tonight is this a street Pentecost is when the message comes forth they denied the birth of the word right because it's so down in our denomination that's exactly what it did it'll take so much of it but don't take the rest of it it denied the birth of the word just like Mary did once there will not be any more organizations after this all right look what he goes on to say there in that message Murray was not the seed she was a carrier remember she had the baby inside of her she was a carrier she was not the seed Mary was not what was Mary she was a shuck yep great D's get the message see he's not an hour to show there's two of them priests in jail for no one wanted to know so he's not there with a Shook and get the message Masterpiece you think I'm so slow see we could spend three months preaching on this this part here and maybe I need to but we don't have time get the message masterpiece run around why would he say Mary is not the word or the seed because she wasn't the seed was in her that's right amen Street Pentecost was not the fully matured seed it was a carrier going to the next one really you may have it up there already because we started out on burger at 97. if you can't get it off of what's on the message you never will understand it so let me just preach a minute see when this thing coming forth Lutheran Wesley and them they were the right of their age they were the people of the age zester Street was the Bride of the age but Azusa Street type Mary right Mary was a carrier of the word right the seed was inside of Mary she gave birth to the seed that's what the people in the Macy's think we've got to give birth to the seed the message that's fine that's true but where's the seed coming from right what do you mean Brothers we give birth to Jesus Christ what was Jesus Christ amen you give birth to the word I preached on these things many times to you we must give birth to the word yes that's fine but then we must become the word because there's no carriers nice Mary right that's right Mary was the last carrier she carried the seed and gave birth to it Azusa Street your Prophet said yes they gave birth to Jesus Christ right yes but it would just be a baby form see you and I you and I must become that word and it must be completed right and once the book is completed then it'll be sealed right yes don't nobody nobody will be able to understand it and once it's sealed it can be broken yes it'll only be broken to the bride you looked her name couldn't stand up here and try to find their name they couldn't find the Plan of Redemption to get this body because they believed in getting a new one yes we don't believe in getting a new body to it we believe this body is redeemed we see you and I the book has got to be complete now if you listen to the whole message I'll review a second see then the book has got to be completed every name that would ever be in the book has got to be made manifest on Earth but not just manifest on Earth as a person but manifest in by the new birth in that person there is your name in the book are you with me there's your name in the book yes and the book has got to be completed then the lamb can take the book and loose the seals because we're the book now did I end up Wednesday night was that one of them do you see why then when we leave out of here in a rapture those two Prophets will take this message amen and deliver it to Israel amen I've read Around coming back and do it now Moses and Elijah they'll take this message going to see a book right over in the last of it read the prophet said they'll tell them you missed it right you turned down the opportunity to be the bride of Christ the children of God blessed the Gentiles has received it now they've gone in a Rapture and you are in a tribulation period amen because of that to be purged amen do you think that we're not going to be made known to Israel sure see I am not in a garbage can with others it's instead one brother said that he'd be a gentile bride and a gentile Prophet that would go to Israel that'd be the two witnesses and I told him no sir I'm sorry I just put around and said it'd be two Jews you don't believe me against all Brian is just our promising no sir right but that's all right I just said it I believe it amen what you see they're going to tell them Jews you know like we all sit around and tell you know there's Burgers stores ever since I've been in the message because you know Paul and Peter and him one day when we'll get there and they'll say uh you know Chris what age did you come out of I come out a lady you'll see you I took a change of the body like a brother said right now it was built when somebody was saying it weighed one they'll say sit down right here beside me I need about five million years to talk to you about what you went through amen because all I had to do was just take a stand and give my life but you had to take a stand and live in a world that would organize religion to every core and everything fighting you and you become the word and we were waiting on you to do the heaven see they without us cannot do you understand what I'm getting here which everybody thinks Redemption over 63 because of lamb left emergency and they'll tell you for sure they'll say no I don't believe rejection was over now in 63 but that's when the lamb left emergency now you showed me that right if what I said is right then the lamb is still on The Mercy Seat amen yes sir not because of my family or anything like that or something private maybe a cause of the word lamb will stay on that Mercy Seat until Redemption is over and then he can take you the sealed book the word of God and show you the Israel amen as the people of God that's right we got to be sealed up before we can be broke the book's got to be complete for it to be sealed the mystery of redemption well I thought existing up here that's what we've all thought you know otherwise don't say that I said to lamb left the mercy and see he missed the lamb left of Mercy Seat it was no longer Mercy the minute the lamb leaves of Mercy Seat it becomes judgment seat right right amen that's why John was told when he asked for a Kinsmen he said the line of the tribe of Judah has prevailed to loose the Seven Seals because the line is judgment nice but when he saw it it was a lamb because Redemption wasn't over right amen and one day redemption will be over and he'll be the lion of the tribe of Judah and then you and I walk off the shirt amen right see the book has got to be sealed it's working me open it can be written before it can be sealed keep repeating that because that in your mind your mind go home what did he say you know your mind just don't comprehend a lot of times I said something last night to one brother and I said it about four times and he still quoting back to me every time wrong I finally told him I said hold it say what I'm saying you know and he said oh okay his mind was saying one thing my mind was saying another thing he thought he was saying that word every word I was saying but he wouldn't do it hmm what do you understand yes the book in the hand of the one sitting on the throne it's a book of names and I killed all those names don't manifest on Earth this book has the record already written about us before we got here but it tells the day and the hour We're living right and the problems that's going on then it'll be sealed up yep then the lamb can take the book and show the complete Plan of Redemption or in other words brother Reynolds said when the lamb takes the book said he'll claim his right of redemption my words claim you and I all right Mustang so are you sealed that's why I've always tried to get you to see the Holy Spirit is the seal and you're sealed by the holy spirit amen people look at you sisters especially as like walking down through Walmarts or town or something they see with the long dress and long hair and no makeup they look at you and they say them poor old people yep or open they don't know that they're looking at a sealed word they're looking at a word to see what up in the heart it's causing you to act that way if it's not you're just doing it because your husband wants you to or whatever but when you can really see it the book is sealed we're sealed with a book right what we got right let's try 246 and up in the uh sorry book 246 246. 246. do you know my Jesus do you have a need and we must believe I must see another word foreign foreign understand there you go you know our name it's coming much I like the way brother bill says it he said just a simple prayer you know I've seen him in years past when he had he had a whole lot more emotion than you saw today whatsoever and yeah right I'm sure he'd still be that way in some ways but he settled down don't worry he's just praying and speaking the word right I believe that because I believe the word okay thank God for his word let's say one more before we go where do we go what about everything everything foreign guide each one remember the needs of each one and have your way with all of us forgive our sins take care of everybody on the highway and make sure you follow somebody or know where you're going to where we can go over and dedicate our brother and sister's home and a woman foreign foreign
