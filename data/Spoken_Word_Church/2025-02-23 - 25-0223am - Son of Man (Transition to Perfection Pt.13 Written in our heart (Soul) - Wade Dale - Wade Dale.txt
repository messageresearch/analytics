us and uh we sure appre appreciate the Lord letting us do that for one more year so all right so now we're up everybody with me now all right today we're going to continue on the son of man the transition to Perfection because what I was listen to brother Donnie this Reagan this morning and Luther had some light Wesley had some light but they didn't have all the light they were reformers we know that he said but you and I say you and I this is our time brother brandham planted the pure seed word of God but there has to be somebody for that rain to fall on to produce something all right what if we took brother John what if brother Brandon preached from 1947 to 1965 and it was never taped it was just hearsay it was just well I heard brother B say this I heard him say that no we have 1100 sermons that God preserved for us to listen to All right we know brother randam is not God but I'm going to tell you something without his message you are confused I'm sorry without that message of the hour you that's what's going on with the world now they turned it down so they're confused they don't know what to do do we do this do we do that do we believe in this do we believe in that I think we should have today and we're going to get into this a little bit later we should already have that stake put down amen that this is real that this is it there is no other I'm sorry you say well well I God requires one thing live his word not man's opinion that you can do whatever you want to like the Methodist they sprinkle now John Wesley didn't sprinkle John Wesley baptized so who brought that up the founder somebody else during that time said well I think I don't want to get wet today so I'll just get a garden hose I'm sorry and we'll just sprinkle you well that's false that's wrong Jesus wasn't sprinkled if Jesus had to be baptized so do I put me in the water watery grave kill me kill the old me everybody with me so today we're going to talk about written in our heart now when the Bible tells us this we're going to read this when the Bible tells us heart it's not this red thing right here that's pumping blood it's the very core the very center of you so where is this word written it's supposed to be written in your soul that's how you got born again folk if you're not born if you're not born again it's not written in your soul you might have a you might have an outside emotion you might have a feeling you might say I believe this but do you really believe it Allen someone said one time take care of your inner spiritual being or beauty that will reflect in your face everybody with me I see some fat sad sad sad people in this world real sad why because they're Soul you know we sing that song It Is Well with our soul now not be might not be well with your spirit but it's well should be well with your soul and that's what we're going to talk about a little bit today so let's bow our heads and we'll read the scripture thank you Lord for the ones among us today well Lord uh you knew who would be here Lord you knew that that we would turn this a little bit Lord in a little bit different way and father I pray that it'll not return void but it'll accomplish everything that it said it would accomplish I believe your word Lord and I think I'm standing in front of a bunch of Believers that that believe in your word and Lord as it goes forth Lord may you as the prophet of God was telling us that the rain is falling now the rain is falling own seed and the seed's coming up into maturity father so that you can come and get a mature bride a mature wheat plant but father we've got to come to church and do the things and and have the conduct and the order and the doctrine those things Lord are are done truly from our heart that we love you so much that you died for us you didn't have to but you died to save my stinking soul and Lord my gift back to you is to try our best to live what you said father just forgive us Lord of our many mistakes and our faults bless us now come down in this congregation Lord and you speak to the people and father may we get something from you today Lord and may this all be done for your honor and Glory bless the sick Lord the ones that are not with us father touch them be with brother Bob and brother Lis as they're off ministering Lord I pray that you'd give them Lord fruit for their labor and get them back home safe father just bless us now in Jesus name amen everybody say amen amen I want you to practice that about every three sentences okay I got you didn't I 1 Corinthians 2 verse 9 but as it is written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard now watch I hath not seen ear hath not heard neither have entered into the heart soul of man the things which God had prepared for them what that love him that Agape him not felo him filo love is is the love you have is conditional the love of God is Not unconditional the love of God can't change if he ever loved you before the foundation of the world you're going to come to that realization somewhere on this Earth that God loved you before you were even you weren't even lovable but he saw you'd be here he saw you would do as we're going to talk about just in a minute well we're going to get the devil on the run today if that's all right that okay he ain't got much room to sit here because we got a house full but uh he's here and he's real if you don't think he is I'm going to give you some of mine but God hath revealed them unto us not by letter now remember I we're going to speak on written Epistles not written with an ink pen not written with a ball or or or a pencil but written in our heart with blood that Jesus on the cross he wrote it in blood and then he told us he said look you got to Worship in spirit and truth you can't worship by the letter but God had to reveal them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches look all things ye the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man sa the spirit of man which is in him right we're all controlled today by a spirit absolutely that's why me and brother brother was talking uh the other day um cuz God changes his mind a lot in this message but he doesn't everywhere else cuz people say God told me to do this and then three months later they're going somewhere else if God tells you something he ain't going to back off he ain't going to change his mind you might change yours and I'm like brother Burley we both agreed God may have told them to do that but what God are they talking to what God are they listening to there's a God of this evil age that's so close it could deceive the very so you better know what God you're listening to you say oh there's only one God there's only one Lord Jesus Christ who is God but there's many gods come on people God is an object of worship you can love your car that could be your God some people's jobs is their God Amen now we have received not the spirit of the world now praise God we've been we've been brought out we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God one more time and you'll be seated for 2 Corinthians 3 says ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men now that Ro word written means to engrave or inscribe or record today you're recording what's going on today in your heart your soul is responding to what's going on right it's got to right you can't help it that's why brother B said you're either better or worse when you leave this place you going to keep the demons you brought in or you going to get rid of them one of the two and you can only do it by the word of God so you are our epistle written in our hearts and read of all men for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the epistle what's the epistle it's one to send a message like I said before brother Aaron if we didn't have 1100 sermons if we just if it was just hearsay from a prophet we could preach whatever we wanted to but we got quoes that fit the Bible amen amen but you and I that message is nothing without a group sitting here standing here today it's just words what Paul saying the letter kth in other words he's telling the people you're living Moses letter letter but you're not catching the spirit behind the letter all right everybody with me on that as such trust have we through Christ to God not that we are sufficient of ourselves none of us are to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God so if I put my sufficiency I'm going to put it in God who also hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament that's why you're not going to get to sit at home and listen you got to come and listen to his Minister I'm sorry that's the way we decided not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life you may be seated in the Lord as his Blessing to the reading word the letter kth you can read this Bible and it will kill you or you can read this Bible and it'll give you life it's your choice it's not my choice today it's your choice everybody with me John 6 verse 63 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I I speak unto you this is Jesus they are Spirit he didn't say they are they are a written word he said they are spirit and they are life now that's what I want I want his spirit and his life if I have his spirit and his life I'm good sir then I don't have to build a kingdom down here my kingdom is already built up there yes sir amen is everybody with me amen yes Matthew 11: 25 wherea just keep pointing because Christine's not here so we've got interpretation going on in the room and I get a little bit out of hand so at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee father now watch this is Jesus talking amen at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent but or and has revealed them unto babes all right so that's what we are we're we're newborn babies in Christ when we become a Christian we are newborn babies sometimes we don't get everything but we got to keep growing we got to keep coming we got to keep doing what the things of God not the things of the world right I'm just going to interject this right here instead of waiting the Bible tells us to resist the devil and he'll flee from you right that word resist means to withstand the action are effect of you got to do that refrain from doing something resist the devil you say I'm nothing all right you ready let me tell you how you whipped him today you ready you're ready some of y'all are not are you ready well that works some of you met that don't get up devil this morning yeah I'm going to preach it and you resisted him wait a minute I got a bunch on that one go ahead all right the I don't feel good devil got up when you did you resisted that didn't you came to church oh wait a minute the kids are fighting devil you resisted that one didn't you boy talk about Overcomers oh wait a minute the too far to drive devil said too far to drive but you can take a vacation preach now you defeated those Devils I want to tell you you defeat those Devils were real cuz if you'll raise your hand I've done hit most of y'all down to about number four I've got 12 to go [Laughter] they ain't got no gas devil or I forgot to fill up devil well they're open 24/7 Lord yeah Danny just hold on don't do that you left that devil at home that Devil's not here if you're sitting in this building that Devil's gone now I'm going to preach stay here for a second I was going to put this in the end of the sermon but I'm going to do it now goad you ain't got no money devil said man it's going to cost you to go to church it's going to cost you not to go if you need gas money my dad's give gas money for years true I ain't ashame to give you no gas money and don't be ashamed to ask for it if you need everybody everybody go through a rough patch every once in a while once in the morning and while in the afternoon okay uhoh me and my spouse are fighting devil on the way to church you walked in that door you better got it you better got it fixed okay cuz you're sitting beside of them and you're sitting pretty close so maybe it got over with oh well but now you made it to church and then you walk in the door somebody got my seat [Laughter] devil somebody got me you don't think this is real whatever's talking to you contrary to God is a devil a devil he has many many demons he's not just he's the head demon but he's got many Little Devils pray for me somebody got my seat devil you get a little rise up a little bit and go you better get rid of that if you did if you sat somewhere else and you're happy you've overcome that devil am I getting somewhere yes sir the I don't understand devil hits oh boy he don't understand that's why he's the devil you tell him that you said I may not understand but you don't understand either but I know the person that can get rid of you cuz I'm going to sit here and listen today I have a problem devil and there's many of them but you're sitting here today and you may have a problem but you're getting rid of it and then the de one the excuses demon come here with you right if you're sitting here today and you're breathing air and you're not sleep yet you've overcome that devil that's 11 demons 11 that you've defeated today just by coming to church but now if you would have sat home you still had them Liv demons what I was me and brother Bley was talking about as you walk through that door that's why it's important to come to church I I that's what I see cuz I got all these demons on me I don't know about you but I know every one of these I said y'all either smile or respond to so you got them same little suckers in your house too set on your shoulder permanent fixture but he can only do what you let him do resist or withstand that temptation to stay in the bed you try that at work you won't be working long but what about God what about the word of God you say I'm not an overcomer you're sitting here today you're an overcomer you have withstood at least 11 demons you have withstood and put them in their place by sitting here today and you ask me why I am so adamant about you coming to church you defeat demons when you come to church and if you do have one Hanging On by the by the by the uh coattail or by one thread or two let's get rid of him before we leave if we get rid him with him with him before we leave you won't have to deal with that one again but when we go home remember Satan don't go on vacation that's right he's right back at you the next Sunday the next Wednesday the next service the next whatever but that don't get up devil as you get older he gets a little bit bigger well praise the Lord pray for me but remember there's one thing one thing that's not a demon and that's the Holy Ghost he's a ghost but he's holy he come from God he is God he has defeated every one of those demons if you'll let him right and as you sit here today just know one thing for sure you have on the whole armor of God you have defeated the Devil by just walking in the door you remember brother Ram told that brother said said you fought your whole way to get to church and they said brother what happened he said I just got up put my clothes on and come to church well he don't know how many demons he slayed during that time that was trying to get him to no don't do that don't listen to that man don't go over here don't go over there but let's don't sit at home let's I I'll get to it in just a minute but there's a there's a new commandment or a new way that we're looking at it here because we're transitioning to Perfection well transitioning to Perfection is the transition is there was some demons there that hinder us keep us from doing things now those demons are being shed it'd be just like you shedding everything off right before you come into that door you got layers of of whatever Pride don't get up I don't feel good kids are fighting you start throwing that off and you walk through that door and you say God I'm here I just believe God will meet you here that's why the Bible says forsake not this s together that's what I believe cuz I get a refreshing when I come here I may get it when I go back out the door but I get a refreshing when I come here and see smiling faces see people worship that's another demon oh demon you don't the old you don't need to raise your hands demon well that's okay when you get in heaven you going to be bound like you wouldn't believe and you're going to be an oddball cuz I believe for an eternity we're going to have our hands raised we're going to be praising God absolutely sister we're going to be praising God well why not let's practice here cuz what tells you to not lift your hands a demon what tells you not to listen a devil let's put it where it's supposed to be all right now let's go let's sing let's let's let's get in a sermon now let's see if we can get rid of some of them list of demons y'all got a bunch of them all out of the way you're sitting here today Matthew 13:1 Jesus answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom or Kingdom of Heaven but to them it is not given Jesus spoke in Parables no one understood him until after he left and came back on the day of Pentecost you know what if God would have come he Brother Joseph he would have come and he would have hung on a cross died for us and he said sianara see you later no he said I'm coming right back and I'm coming back not as one individual with flesh I'm going to come back as a spirit and I'm going to indwell many flesh I'm going to be the final voice to the final age in the end time I'm going to be in a bride that sometimes don't look well I'm going to preach now they don't look well they don't feel well they don't maybe sometimes act well but listen this is it yes there's nothing else left that's right you can put everything you got on everything else but God and you will fail you will fail every time they get to talking about stuff at work and and they're all into that uh and it's okay to invest and it's okay to have money put up but they're checking every three or four days well I made $200 I made $300 my you know my through the post office they have a weird way of doing things but they post it every couple days how much you made or lost according to the stock market or whatever and they said I need well man look at this I made this I said show me the money yeah I only know well I don't have a bold with me I ain't got I'm bold but show me the money they said what do you mean I said that could be gone in a second that's why the Bible tells us that even your life is just vapor it's nothing if you don't have God but if you have God in your soul I promise you it's worth more than listen to this it's worth more than the Creator creating 10,000 more worlds just like this one your one soul is worth more than that it's what you feed that soul with is what gets you here or gets you there keeps you here or gets you there so Jesus spoke in parable so everybody's not going to get this this is going to be puzzling to the world all the world when we trans even the one that are nominal Christians that we're going to transition to Perfection they can't be perfected by an imperfect word all right show me one person in the Bible ever baptized other than the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or Jesus Christ in the Bible yet somewhere somebody it wasn't God somebody says it's okay to be baptized in titled of father son Holy Ghost God didn't say that the devil did you say oh no I can read where Jesus said baptize in the name father's not a name son's not a name spirit's not a name we have somebody that we can stick a name to his name is the Lord Jesus Christ and he's the one that the bride should be married to not a father or not a son oh by the way you hear the pope is not doing very well folks this thing is coming down to a point real quick we get a pope like like brother Brown said we get a pope out or either close to the United States or in the United States between him and all this other government stuff and I ain't no politician well I guess I am but um I'm a mayor of a city okay A little bitty town I don't dwell in politics there's only one thing that's going to get only side I want to be on is Jesus's side I don't want to be on none of them other sides okay Hallelujah but remember though we have tomorrow's news today we know because God sent us a prophet we know what's going to happen we know whatever this one does or that does it's going to end up in Rome the mother of harlots and her children that's plain Bible but thank God he sent us the prophet to tell us and show us exactly where that's coming from so bring it on this kingdom is not my home I don't want this to be my home I do later on when all the sin and Junk's gone out of it it's like that I wouldn't bring you back for nothing into this world but he's coming back in his Perfection and then you and I are going to be changed you say I don't believe that you then become an unbeliever amen I believe means a lot I believe means a lot if you believe what I said about those Devils you whiiing those Devils then you are an overcomer if you don't you still got them what Paul say there's a weight that so easily besets us what is it it's demons it's demonology it's the outside world that influences this world he was delivering a package yesterday to a to a customer and and her van was parked in the yard and I looked on I said oh my word the whole back window said don't make a witch mad oh so I gently laid her package down on her on her stoop there and I eased around I ain't worried about that I ain't no more scared of that or nothing if you're scared of witches then sorry about that like I said I got a ghost but it's holy I ain't worried about them other ghost but that's just the world's thoughts it doesn't matter anymore there's no line of of even morality Romans 16:25 unto them that is of power to establish you according to my gospel Paul says and the preaching of Jesus Christ that's what we're doing today according to the revelation of the mystery so there is a revelation there's a mystery and there's a revelation of that Myst mystery all right like I said before if God would have just took it all with him when he left we couldn't even be sitting here today right if brother Brown just took it all with him we wouldn't be sitting here today but you and I are what written Epistles yes known and read of all men the people in my community they know kind of how we believe cuz we believed it for 50 years it ain't that up down and all the way around and get in the back and hit that take a hammer and hit yourself in the head with it you start cussing like a sailor you say oh Lord Heal My diseases and walk going keep going forward now the himm that is a power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery now watch which was Kept Secret since the world began right since the world began cuz you know what I was watching CNN had a C-SPAN or whatever it is so they were having a uh they were in Congress and they were having a discussion about factchecking fact got it fact F A factchecking they're fact checking everything Trump did the fact checking all this the fact checking all that the older Kennedy stood up and he said I think one time there was a man in the Bible named Noah and he had a whole lot of fact Checkers it's going to rain it ain't never never rain I'm going to build a boat and save the world you're an idiot we have facts that says you can't do that you know what the end you know what you know what Kennedy said after that he said they all died so listen they can fact check this message all they want to they can dig up garbage against brother randam he was a man we know he was a man he told us his fault he told us where he was wrong he told us when he was in error he told us when he did something against God hello somebody amen amen but those fact Checkers they're the ones that leave that's right and as it happened now didn't the Bible tell us as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the son of man you can fact check brother R them all you want to I don't care he was a prophet sent from God Vindicated I believe it because it Sparks my heart every time I hear him say a word and it will you too if you'll get the Holy Ghost in your soul other than that you'll what you'll fact check it that's what's happening people are factchecking everything go online sometime see if they they're just a bunch of fat Checkers but they all died in the flood Noah was the only one that made it and his seven CH or six children that was it the fact Checkers have said there's no rain up there no they saw rain one day and they tried to get in that Ark God closed the door of the Ark and that's what we're going to talk about a little bit later on because when we come down to this message at the end we're at the end now amen right but that third pole message that brother Ram had he said Jesus had it and even Noah had it it was to the totally lost the people that the door had already been shut and you can't get in I hate to say that but that's what it is God is going to be what longsuffering is long as he can but there's a time when you got to what get off and On You' got to figure out if you want this or you don't want it cuz listen God's going to shut the door I'm not going to stand here and go now none of y'all can get saved anymore no you just keep preaching Jesus kept preaching Noah kept preaching that's right listen Noah had a revelation they W only going to be but a few people going to get on that boat cuz they ain't big enough for everybody amen plus animals so he had a revelation but you know what he did he didn't stop in about half of the half 50 years of the 120 he said ain't n y'all going to make it no he preached until the door was shut even when the door shut even when the door shut he still said Lord more like like like Abraham said Lord if there's 50 in Sodom will you will you will you spare it he said yes sir if there's 50 he got down to 10 he said if you can find 10 will you save it yes well there was only lot his wife two daughters if he' have said four God would have saved Sodom cuz Abraham was his son at the time Abraham was the one that he was the prophet that spoke but when he got to 10 he stopped and he couldn't find 10 righteous so he destroyed he's going to destroy this world folks you can believe it if you want to this world is in for it and the United States number one cuz you know what God sent a prophet to us in our language in our day and we turned him down but now it's made manifest in how in you and me and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the Commandment of the Everlasting God made known to All Nations for The Obedience of Faith this message has went now to pretty much every country that we know of and that's fulfilling the scripture where Jesus said go into all the world preach the gospel all the world this message have been when it get when it hits Every Nation that's it it never got into China till just several years ago never got into Japan till now few years ago as a message church or two you said boy y'all say it too much on this message message it is the message of eternal life period there is nothing outside this message and now you say well you boy you this message is Jesus Christ now listen now the Greek word for Revelation is apocalypse which means unveiling this unveiling is perfectly described in the example of a sculptor unveiling his work of Statuary exposing it to the onlooker it is an uncovering revealing what was previously hid am that's what a prophet does he gets the mind of God he it's not the mind of God to two or three other people and into to him no it's the mind of God to him that's how a prophet Works read it in the Bible he said I'll do nothing Amos 2 and N right I'll do nothing till I reveal it to my servants the prophets so he's not going to do anything you might think you're one prove it like I said before well can have long hair like Jesus did if you'll act like Jesus you can have it number one you wouldn't born virgin so that mean you're out so I just covered that real quick Lord it is an uncovering revealing what was previously hidden now remember John wrote this in about 8096 somewhere in there right the Book of Revelations he was given the he was given the vision and then he wrote it all right now we're living it here everybody with me now the uncovering is not only the revelation of the person of Christ now watch but it's the revelation of his future work in the oncoming bride Church ages all right everybody with me now Bob read this Wednesday night and I've read it several times before going read it again I mentioned it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation listen you're going to fight this message if you don't have the Holy Ghost because it's contrary it's contrary to everything out there but it's proven by the Bible then I mentioned it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation yes sir or it or we will fail to get it I got to slow down a little bit sorry bringing these two thoughts together you'll see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real now remember the whole pretense today is is there is no written Book on a piece of paper and pen that describes the word of God more than him inside of you that's the way he wanted it he wanted it re he listen he even wrote the Scrolls and put them in clay vessels written Epistles known and read of all men as I we' were preaching last Sunday the unwritten part you and I are the unwritten part they didn't put John DED in there or or or um boy Helm your name's not in the Bible mine is I'm Samuel so y'all all just forget it no your name is in there by what Association to what you believe I believe there was a seventh angel messenger cuz God told us in Malachi he's going to send us one before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord right so if brother bram's not it we're going to have to find one before God destroys this world or God's a liar did Brother Brown say you take God back to the word and he said if he don't do exactly what he said you can call him a liar that's how much the word of God we know that's never going to happen because God never changes his mind he knew what we needed he knew what we needed in this end time he knew we'd have demons that we had to navigate that others didn't have that's right come on internet cell phones it's a fight to keep them things clean come on somebody there's a pool there and it's a web for a reason a worldwide web everybody's caught in it listen I'm using the internet now okay we're using the internet to get the message out but boot devil you might have created it but we're using it God's been Wi-Fi ever since the foundation of the world he never needed a cable to hook into nothing he's been giving it to us by what Wi-Fi all he's doing it right now amen it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that's why brother R said the most important thing is to make sure that you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul not an anointing in your soul because your soul will verify what I'm talking about if I tell you the truth by an amen or an OM me one of the two that's right that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people amen that's us it will take one with prophetic Insight in other words we had to have a Prophet come to open the word up so that we could step into that same prophecy come on somebody and we grab the mind of God just like he did amen I've always believed when brother said let's go back in the back part of God's mind there in Christ mystery G reveal it didn't close when he left the mind of God he brought that mind and give it to each and every one of us and you and I have access to the very mind of God the very thoughts of God right it will require the ability to hear from God it will require Supernatural instruction not just a student can BR verse with verse though that's good listen sometimes it's good to go to school all right but you got to what apply what that teacher's teaching you or like brother John said it does us no good to sit and listen and listen unless it what comes back this way or shows up in your life somewhere that's right but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit didn't say word written the teaching of the word by the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God to lay oursel open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know Isaiah 28:9 Whom Shall he teach knowledge now we want the knowledge of God right we the knowledge of the world's okay listen folks kids go to school right get a degree you'll struggle if you don't don't think you can figure this thing out cuz in the age we're living in you got to have something above your high school education or you're going to struggle all your life right but remember when I was growing up Janet different ones Jo pulling kids out at 16 years old cuz brother Ram said education was of the devil well that was the devil telling him that because brother R never said that he said education was of the if we lean to that education that's of the devil cuz his kids went to school they went to college but see there's those fact checkers that's all they did when the flood came I promise you you open your mouth underwater you going drown praise the Lord that's pretty good one and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine now who them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast in other words you're not still on Mama right now folks if you're over about 10 12 Liv n I'm just going somewhere but all of us know what that means we're eating food today I like a little milk had some yesterday but I also had some real nice pork chops that Jun made man they were good but that was meat cuz we're meat eaters we're we're Eagles we love fresh meat we don't like meat that's been held over so it's a requirement that we have Apostles prophets pastors teachers and EV angelist I am not here to promote my office God promoted our office if we're God called people God said this is how you're going to get it I didn't and some people get mad at brother brandom they say well he well the Bible said it way before he even was born that's right God inspired a man named Paul to write that in about ad50 something way a long time ago way before anybody was born here in the room oh I was going back to that fact Checkers you know Noah how was he when the flood happened he was in his hundreds right right he he died at like 600 or something like that they were people that I'm sure they went up to Noah and said Noah I'm 800 years old this ain't never happened everybody with me I mean there's a lot of people that that live way back years years 6 700 years Noah this has not ever been taught but he was right and what he said came to pass so who was the naysayer him or them this thing's going to come down to where if you don't have the Holy Ghost you're going to be deceived yes and you'll go off into a deception and you'll never be able to get back I'm sorry right go to God of this evil Age and and uh anointed ones at the end time when you read sir what is the time that's right what is it for is for perfecting of all of us I have to have a five-fold Ministry so do y'all I love it when people like brother Burley brings wisdom like he did Sunday and walked right down some people's path that he didn't know one word you know I told him I told him um brother K I said you know people are they really we really get surprised at the supernatural we should not be we should not be surprised as Supernatural we're Supernatural people if you got a problem you had talked to me about it you had talk to the preacher about it and he comes right here and runs right down your aisle and tells you your problem and tells you how to fix it now that ain't the devil cuz he wants you to keep it that ain't the preacher cuz he didn't know that was God almighty that came that day to help everything that you needed you say I've never been close to God you'll never be no closer to God than we gives you a revelation or gives you a way to get out of some situation that's a God I serve he's not somewhere up there he's right here you brought him with you for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ right till we all come to the unity of the Faith so we got to keep preaching till everybody comes to Perfection all right or completion you say well you ain't perfect I ain't perfect I'm not but I serve a perfect God that lives inside of me so he can't become imperfect as he's coming into me huh he's still perfect and this transition that we're transitioning is to let him out and let him do his work cuz that's the only way we're going to get out of here is to let him do his work through to us there's not some Supernatural spaceship going to come and bring us something get us out of here right we got to understand what we're talking about now spaceship will come pick us up that's all right with me but you better be ready to go cuz if you ain't have a body change you'll die right till we all come to the unity of faith of the knowledge of the Son of God into a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro what devil list toss to and fro you got rid of them today you ain't tossed you see I got a problem now tell God say hey I know you're here I want to get rid of this you know what you don't have to have this great aura you don't have to have like fireworks going off um you just believe God cuz remember this thing is a secret it's an end individual affair with God now you're going to show it as I read that where if you got God in your soul you're going to let It Shine by your face that's our problem sometimes is we don't have God in our soul and we can't smile right we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by what by the slight of preachers right by the slight of false Doctrine cunning craftiness is taking you away from from God whereby they lie and wait to deceive you know the Bible tells us that in the end time that there will be wolves come to you and sheep's clothing right do you know there had to be a lamb die before they could do that and they're professing that that lamb died for them but I'm going to tell you something you hang around that joker long enough wolves don't smell like sheep wolves don't talk like sheep wolves are wolves sooner or later the stench is going to come out and you'll know who they are because everything's going to be exposed here in the end time we know that hey hello but speaking the truth what in love in love okay by speaking the truth in love it woke some of them up by somebody sat their alarm for 5 minutes from now not a bad idea Brother Anderson put that up put that on the uh speaker I haven't said wake up in a long time have I have I done that I done a long time I should have but by speaking speaking the truth and love may grow up into him so you got to hear the gospel to grow all right eagle food you got to eat Eagle food now listen the eagle stayed in the barnyard for a little while but remember he still was an eagle and he when he heard the Cry of the mama Eagle he knew her cry not the cluck so that's what's happening to you and I now this is What dra us not to Lula church but this is what Drew you to the message you heard from Mama Eagle you heard from something that was different than anybody else or I did but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ and brother Brown tells us it's a requirement yes these wasn't required what these were required but he brought his church up the same way his church up the same way he's bringing his people up all right what through justification sanctification and baptism Holy Ghost then Peter said give you the Seven Virtues the Holy Ghost Christ in the person of the Holy and the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you get all these virtues sealed in you these here behind we we believe in growth development and that's the only way to get it all right then God lives in a tabernacle call the building not this building here this building here call the building the living Tabernacle of the living God's Dwelling Place when a man possesses these kind I want to be possessed amen amen you know we get away from people that say I'm possessed or like that woman that had to don't make a witch mad if she was possessed I don't want that kind of possession that's right but I do want to be possessed of the Holy Ghost possessed with these virtues brother rown said when a man possesses these kind of things now watch then the Holy Ghost comes upon him now watch navigates listen to me a minute he he helps you to navigate there's two things and I'm going to try to weave this into the to the sermon that we're going to do in in a few weeks at Methodist Church but remember when you become a Christian you're still going to have problems probably even more because you're going to be persecuted you going to have to change your ways but what a change it is it will take me to my body chain if you don't change it's going to take you to a grave and it's going to take you into hell sorry we still believe in Hell okay but if you're a Christian today you will know how to navigate through that problem if you're B listen if you're born again Holy Ghost filled God is obligated to help you than you Lord obligated to help you help you through that amen so you're going to have problems Christians new Christians you're going have problems but you're going to know where to get your information where to get rid of about 11 of them demons every day for you or every Sunday right everybody with me if you look at it that way folks it's not an obligation to come to church it's a have to I have to get here if I don't get here I still got them and I hate Mundy there's a mondy demon in there too and I didn't put him in there he's too big for that piece of paper what I said I hope to brother Jim I hope the Rapture takes place 7:00 Monday morning for those of us at work just whip the Old Devil to death we ain't got to go to work on Monday morning that's my worst day at the post office cuz they've got two do what yeah between brother R said between 600 and 9 so I mean that's about time we getting ready to go to work you don't even have to call in who they going to find than they may call you neighbor you seen waiting Jun the cars are there I hear the dog barking no we're going to take the dog with us and the cats and the cats sorry Jun they'll be perfected we won't have to clean after after them listen folks I'm telling you a reality one day I Promise You by the word of the Lord you will disappear we'll be gone in a moment in the Twin of an eye and they will not even know where we are we heard that that was going to happen we heard that they were talking about one day they were going to disappear that's right and then the old Devil's going to say well they probably off on vacation somewhere yeah fat Checkers but both cars are still going to be in the parking lot cuz I ain't going to need one no car Hallelujah no Mondays in eternity you say you're crazy I look at those little things I look at those little things cuz I know what beats me up right you know what beats you up but we can get rid of a lot of them won't you make your own little list one day and just right put I just put don't get up devil see that you get that don't get up devil I don't feel good devil you get the kids are fighting devil well just start Xing them off you say you're crazy absolutely lost my mind about 24 years ago hopefully tried to get the mind of Christ it'll make you talk different act different look at things different it just make you different listen when Jesus himself was on Earth they thought he was crazy they called him the chief of demons they said you're a wine bibber you eat too much you hang around Sinners and prostitutes what's your problem Oh and listen you don't wash your hands before you eat either well I don't always but Jesus didn't man he was only known after the day of Pentecost the way he was supposed to be known even Peter J all them they were standing there looking at where you going to restore the kingdom hey you come back down here you're not finished they missed it all right but praise God those two angels that stood there and said look that same Jesus that same Jesus that you see going away in a cloud he's going to come back in a cloud and he's going to come to a group of people and he's going to inhabit that group of people and then he's going to take them home praise God I just believe that 100% or I wouldn't be standing here today I'm heading out to go to Kentucky to do a little Coy hunting I I just leave right now here let's go no I'm compelled to finish what I'm going to say am but until these virtues here get into you you're still off the real true foundation of Faith all Christianity is based on faith folks listen we believe to see we don't have to see to believe nobody sitting here saw Jesus hanging on the cross nobody here saw him Ascend nobody saw him here come back but I see him every day and every person that has the Holy Ghost right amen right so that makes me a Believer and I believe he's coming back for a group of people he's not going to leave us he even told us he said I'm not going to leave you comfortless I'm going to send you a comforter that's right but he didn't stop there he said I'm going to send you a comforter is going to what tell you things to come amen but when these virtues grow in you and you add that to that then you're a living Monument you're a living moving Idol you know everybody everybody in the whole Bible even Noah had a flaw he died a drunk okay Abraham gave his wife away twice laughed at God Samson had women problems Rahab was a harlot she knew about everybody mail in in the whole city of Jericho hello somebody but yet God chose to come right through that to get here come on look at Paul Paul was having Christians killed but he was getting ready to be the most powerful agent that God used to begin the church ages Peter would you pick him as a poster boy for Christianity a naked Fisher that cured that's what he was right he denied God lied had a temper but God used him to tell us about these virtues because you know what when they got birthed inside of him he knew it and when him him knowing it listen the only thing I can tell you today is what I know I'd just be presuming as a prophet of God said I'd be presuming if I didn't he knew where he was that he knew when no seals broke and we're going to look at it later on he knew when no seals broke that was it that was man had never seen that before we'll get to that in just a second cuz remember we talked about we talked about the White Rock and to some people it's going to be a little bit strange but we'll work up to it so now look remembering the Lord 1963 this is after he preached the tatue perfect man let's remember what he required not what we think we ought to have remember I told you what's your biggest problem when you start a conversation that says I thought you lose every time it's not what you thought it's what he said amen that's why I'm not standing up here trying to beat people to come to church God told you to come you can you can throw it off on Old me if you want to but God told you to come to church God through a prophet made sure you got here 30 minutes before service oh we don't believe that but we believe he open the seals if he believe he open the seals then you'll do that oh don't get quiet the truth that's what I said about there's a purpose behind everything to shed those demons get here pray read your Bible get your mind on God get it off that you had that fight when you came up here with the kids or came up here with your husband I know ain't one of y'all ever done that sister Jessica what you smiled about it was this morning she said no I'm just kidding they both they both have stop sign faces they're red I'm sorry but it does happen though you it does every well Chris going yeah brother Chris said yeah I might give brother Chris a rose he's grown more than than than then a lot of people come to the church he has grown in in the Lord and I sure do appreciate him appreciate the family and if I didn't if I have known he was going to maybe when if I said this a year ago or so when they started coming he probably would have fell out but you grow up a little bit but we've all had that sit every situation I gave you every one of you's been through that so now you know how to handle it work your way through it come on to church June and I we've had arguments before or more but I put my hand up on that thing where it says at the top you remember who preached that sermon brother Daryl Warden many many years ago he went into the Tennessee football stadium and they let him go into the back and there's a there's a thing like that door with double doors and it and then they slapped it and went out to the ball field it says today I give my all to Tennessee football well why in the world can't we give our All to Jesus Christ if you didn't notice that it's on the back side of that door and one other demon leaves is when my shoulder gets sore I just reach up and touch up and come on in this room you say you're crazy preacher amen I'm crazy I just believe the demons are real but God's more real than they are he created them jokers and they the one that turned him down Satan can't create remember God created those angels they just listen to a lie are we all right let's remember that he required not what we think we ought to have but what he said we've got to have see we got to have it that way the way that he said it amen if it's your opinion then it's your opinion but opinions like noses what everybody's got one so let's look at this new conduct this new ministry cuz brother random is getting ready to enter in to a new ministry everybody with me this is where I was going to stop and do this so that's how far down the road I was if demonology go read those books those small books demonology books brother R explains a lot what goes on in another realm you know what we're not alone we're not alone when man says there's flying saucers and all that stuff that's okay fine with me they just don't know brother R says they're investigating Angels that's right why don't we have technology that can keep up with them you can't have technology of God we do cuz remember we're going to travel like a thought right right so this new conduct this new ministry this transition from from imperfection to Perfection or from partial understanding to per perfect understanding number one we got to do is and I think brother Chris preached this a long time ago you got to know who your enemy is that's right study his tactics don't get involved with him but study his tactics his tactics was is what I just said how many times has he said you really don't have to go to church today you just Mash a button and watch it online well God don't God ain't into buttons God's into Overcomers every time you overcome that's one Mark against the devil that's right have you ever come to church and had a bad time I'm looking you ever come to church and had a bad time W you ought to try it sometime now watch brother random now look he's going into a new ministry what did the angel tell him that was going to be this new purpose or this new ministry how to get there all right everybody with me just a few minutes right how'd he tell him if you'll continue to be sincere and humble can y'all read that it'll grow greater and greater and now this ministry is going to step higher now into another realm where it'll be far beyond what it is now do you believe that amen I believe that transition to Perfection started in 19 58 different he started in 56 said he was going to have a new ministry but like I said before he thought it was going to be something great through a prayer line cuz he had the vision of the tent and all that everybody with me I ain't getting into the tent Vision but if you're waiting on the tent you going you going to be here long long longer than I am praise sorry but he saw the prayer line going through and people were healed or are restored okay you can make it whatever you want to but I don't need a tent I don't need a physical tent to get healed the Bible did not tell us to get in a tent to get healed it didn't say get in a tent and be saved it said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved the only T I'm worried about is this one and you better be worried about your tent if you'll continue to be sincere and humble that's my prayer and this new part that we're coming to more sincere and humble than ever before we don't have to pay for it don't cost you a dime what it does it requires you to overcome what you did before brother brandom be more sincere and humble that was the most humble sincere man ever walked to face of the Earth but but but God knew there was a part of him that wasn't oh come on somebody he was human he was not God he had human emotions human problems just like we do but like I said before we know why I handle it and also I forgot to tell you the second one the second one is as I've told you many times before and I wrote in my Bible right here tragedy defines a Christian does it destroy him so if you have a tragedy in your life and you're not a Christian it will destroy your life I've seen it happen but Christians know how to handle it they know where to go to they know the power of God they know they can go to God they know they've got a support group right here and they know they're not lonely so it defines who you are did job we had never known about Job brother Alex if he hadn't went through problems cuz there was billions of people on earth at that time oh yeah God just happened to say have you considered my servant job hey devil devil said I can't even get close to him it's like a hot poker over there you got this Holy Ghost um Veil around that man and I can't touch him God said well you know what God could have said he said yeah you got that right buddy leave me alone that's not what he said he said okay I'm just going to lift that off of him a man that had millions of dollars come on people he had houses he had children he had land he had cattle that you couldn't number he had a good wife and he was Sting back pretty and God is the one that put the devil on him he said take everything he's got but don't take his life oh praise God he can do that to me and you cuz Satan can never take your life God's the only one that can take your life he's the only one who can give it he's the only one who can take it I just believe that 100% Satan can do whatever he wants to to any of us he can't kill us not until God's finished with us and when he's finished with a Christian he takes him over in a good place praise God for that I'm glad God sent Paul and the prophet across the curtain of town to tell us what's over there cuz man has probed it all these different things down oh they're at the feet of Jesus No Nonsense they're floating on a cloud playing a heart or a cello it'd be hard to get on the cloud I told her I said why don't you play something small when she rolls that thing it's like rolling a person in you've seen the case but we don't do that we know we're not going to play a heart we know we're not we're not there listen those people in the sixth Dimension are not even at the feet of Jesus right right right brother Brown said he said where's Jesus and angel said a little higher what he's in another dimension but this Dimension is fine stay right here brother BR said whatever you do don't miss that he didn't say don't miss my next sermon he said don't miss that that's what you don't want to miss and I'm telling you today that you don't want to miss now watch you we're talking about new it'll be in a new ministry this Min now watch this ministry will never cease the ministry that we've been under will never cease God is not an Indian giver he doesn't give you something and take it back where God gives gifts he never takes gifts away your gifts remain but if you be honest with what you got God will take other talents and just keep pouring them on I like that he'll keep pouring them on if you just keep climbing on he's always done it like in Luther Wesley the Pentecost on and on there's no limit to it everybody all right so brother Bown said oh this new ministry it's not in zerma so he's getting he's getting a revelation that it's not going to be greater in the prayer line cuz he's already telling them the thoughts and intents of the heart I mean you used to hold them by the hand remember and the hand would have bumps on it right then he would say let's pray and then he said sister you still got it let's pray again he said sister you don't have it cuz look at my hand my hand's fine right but he came to a place to where he looked at him and he said look he said I see you I see you w what about that I see you in a doctor's office now they ain't but the doctor and that person in that office back then they wasn't hidden cameras well there was called God but uh cuz he knows everything but he said I see he's got on a a a blue coat he's got a a tablet in his hand he's wearing glasses I mean he just sees this thing so vivid then you see that one girl this one was one that that really got me is how your life influences you remember what brother R said he told that one sister he he she couldn't get over something she couldn't get over something she kept going she go to psychiatrist she go to the doctor she go everywhere she came to brother brandom brother Bram said oh I see when you were I see when you were a little child you got scared by a dog come on somebody you got scared by a dog and that makes you nervous now around anything like that he drug that right out of her and he said demon you can leave now and that demon left and the girl was okay but she'd went to all kind of doctors well they they probably she probably didn't even tell them that she got scared by a dog when she was a little girl remember what a mighty God we serve what we got in this day folks people since the dawn of time have wanted to see this day right here all the prophets in the Old Testament wanted to see their word become manifest and you and I are seeing it today so the new ministry the second Ministry is leaving the third is entering in so I'm glad about it so what is the what is the third part of his ministry it's going to be the opening of The Seven Seals something that man has never seen before now watch I remember brother Jackson we'll be done in just a second he is usually with us brother Junior Jackson the Methodist was a Methodist Minister here he is sitting here now he had a dream everybody with me be with me just for a second wake up maybe we need to start sprinkling a little bit maybe we deacons get some ice water ready so he had a dream now remember brother randam tells us being a prophet he doesn't inter a dream until he sees it see you can tell me a dream and say what do you think I'll just tell you what I think cuz I wasn't there but brother Brandon God showed him the exact Vision or the dream that the person had right that way they don't leave anything out they don't leave a part that they didn't want to talk about it's everything so he saw this Vision now watch then some more Brethren came up they had similar dreams now the Lord is been real good to me and I have never take you to record this morning have I ever told you a wrong interpretation of a dream because I'll not speak of it till I see it over again all right and know what he says about it then I'll tell you so watch he told me the dream like in Indiana there was a long great grassy Hill the water had washed all the soil off the the top and it became a rock like a ball top on the mountain kind of like a pyramid and then in this rock there was funny writing okay everybody with me shake yourself just for a second and said I was standing there with all the Brethren around the church interpreting this writing now that's brother brandom interpreting what's on the outside everybody with me interpreting the outside what's written on the outsides like you would see that on the outside of this pyramid Rock there was inscribed words and he was interpreting that to the brothers everybody with me and I was standing there with all the Brethren around the church interpreting this writing in other words giving us to right correct water baptism giving us no eternal hell and all those different doctrines that we're supposed to build on but then go to something else all right or go higher not something else and then when it come to the time I got all of it interpreted all right then somehow or another if I understand the dream right I got a hold of something like a crowbar or an angle bar or something or not an angle bar I me a pry bar everybody knows what a pry bar is it's got a hook on it and you pry the thing off and just cut the top of that mountain out and lifted it up now watch and on the inside of it was White Rock something on the order of granite or something on that side some White Rock that wasn't written on now watch hang on a minute that wasn't written on and I said to the Brethren stay here and look on this this now remember there was nothing for them to see hold on and while they were looking I slipped out from among them and started going west and brother Jackson said that he saw me going over one Hill another Hill getting smaller and smaller going west you remember that now we find out I told you the interpretation on the Rock and the rock is Christ and that was in the brother's dream and that's the Bible and for all these years the Bible has been interpreted what till we've absolutely got it the the ecclesiastical interpretation through right all right in other words the truths are being known they've been known through his message but that's not all of his message and the last gift being added in the loudest in age which is here which is the seventh Angel's time to preach in the loudest in age at that time that there would be a lot of things that was misconstrued down Through the Ages like Luther preaching justification but he let it run wild CU he didn't live long enough they organized it Luther never organized it after Luther Wesley did the same thing John Smith for the Baptist Alexander Campbell but they were reformers they didn't live long enough to get it all together a lot of these Loose Ends we know what loose ends are that's false interpretation of the word of God all right water baptism he goes through all that and now after the Bible had been interpreted completely now watch then you notice it opened at the top of the pyramid like rock everybody with [Music] me not pyramid teaching now that's a bunch of garbage and I know it is too I know nothing about it it was the shape of a pyramid but the cap on the pyramid was never put on I've been in Egypt and the cap was never on it because it was a Cornerstone this was a headstone Cornerstone when you get started that's right down here you Foundation you get your foundation started right here then you build up and you that thing is actually this right here that's holding the thing up everybody with me just for a second Don't Lose Yourself now watch in the church it was the Cornerstone the church all right the church back in the ages it was the Cornerstone you know there's couple of Christian singers got a couple of songs out now and they talk about the Cornerstone they never talk about The Headstone cuz they don't have him it's it's not to the natural world they know Jesus come and they know je there was a Jesus died on the cross that's but they don't know that he can come back and get inside of that person so they know of him but they don't know him like you and I know him so in the church it was a Cornerstone in the full Church all right you ready in the full church it was a headstone so it never did come it was rejected Christ and it will come and I then I believe that when it's coming that the church WIll shape up into a place from justification sanctification Pentecostal message will bring the church to such a minority not full buildings minority and a ministry will be among those people till it be exact same Ministry that Jesus Christ did that'll bring Jesus and catch the whole thing away all right just a few more cuz I want I want to ask you a question here in just a minute now this is the dream again a different version and notice the next thing now you say what a different version listen Matthew Mark Luke and John there's four different versions of thing of what happened everybody with me four different angles of the same it didn't change the message didn't change Jesus one of them saw two Blind Men one of them saw one they just wrote it down all right now listen just a few minutes I took some kind of a bar cut it off now watch and on the inside was White Rock now watch again he said that had nothing wrote on it you with me had nothing wrote on it why did he pull the top off if it was nothing inside and at that time I started to the West remember he had to go west for this to happen and for him to come back to open the seals and I told them all I said don't go out west stay here and look on this till I return right in other words look on what I've taught you already until I come back stay here and look on this till I return went West for the blast returned back to the east with the Holy Spirit interpreting this Unwritten word now if that is a perfectly the God Almighty I want you to know what is I want you to know what is what am I trying to say this for friends is to show you we're at the end time all right brother Bram what is the vision he talks about the Lord he talks about the Third P but I want to ask you a question let's get on over here we talk about the three pulls a little bit later on but here the art real quick but when he begins to declare his message what was his message the unwritten part everybody with me it wasn't a it wasn't writing a new Bible but it was an Unwritten word just like the love letter all right be everybody with me the first pull was healing prayer line Second pull he was bringing everything all the Loose Ends back he was prophesying about what they had in the first church age he was bringing it back to this church a everybody with me so the third pull the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed all right which was what the unwritten part the White Rock that was nothing written on but there had to be something or he'd have never pull that top off all right everybody with me cuz I'm getting somewhere real quick and then we'll close now here's a u brother Leo and and brother Jee Mercer one of them had another dream it's a different but watch what happens when the young fellow came to me with a dream that he had of a pyramid so this is a pyramid again standing up in this pyramid and he climbed up to where I was at and I was standing out on a SA or a plate or something like a light he said brother brandham how you get up there I said brother Leo God has to put a person in this position up here I'm saying today Lula Church God's got to put you in a position just like that separated from everything else I said now that you've seen now that you've seen return back to the people and tell them that you believe it's of God all right so I want to ask you a question musicians come on where does your Revelation put you does your Revelation put you on the outside where anybody can read and interpret the word of God I thought we were a special class of people I thought I thought we had to have prophetic Insight I thought we had to be the unwritten part so what does your real where does it put you on the outside of the pyramid or on the inside of the pyramid now listen souls in prison second pull was the discernment of the spirits the prophecy first was healing the second was the prophecy that went forth and know the secrets of your thoughts when the word itself was made manifest which that's Grace but but remember the seventh is to finish now watch Jesus's Ministry cons consisted of three polls did you know that notice and be sincere if he ever was in your life now for a minute his first pull was Healing The Sick he became a very popular man all people love signs and wonders but the devil can pass out Supernatural gifts so he can get involved in this hello he is involved in this everybody believed him seemed like is that right when he went forth Healing The Sick everybody wanted him in their church but one day he turned around and started prophesying for he was the word and he was the prophet that Moses spoke of and when he went to tell them tell them how they were living and the things they were doing he became very unpopular that was his second pull wonder if that types right back just a minute the first was healing the second oh it could be Jesus only it could be Bel Same Spirit living in the same kind of people condemning or condemned people that can never be saved because they were condemned before like Judas born the son of predition first pull second pull third pull let's stand our feet you all have that same journey to take amen and it's a requirement to hear the word of God you can't get it for yourself you can get pieces amen you can get certain things but you can't get it all by I can't get it all by myself but even brother Brown said Jesus had a third pool Ministry Noah had a third pool Ministry all people have a third pull if you look at them in your life even you say well man what about the first pull well the first pull is justification that's when you come to a sin that you're healed remember that was a healing campaign the greatest healing was your soul not your body right and then you come through sanctification which is what sanctification cleans you out in other words takes those demons out of you now you might let them back in but God takes them out and then the Holy Ghost is the third pull listen if you get born again today you can't get unborn again praise God for that I'm glad he's not an Indian Giver you can't get unborn again that ought to make you happy so what is a third pole it's preaching to the totally lost if you're born again the people that not born again they're lost sorry you said well I'm not a preacher you're a LIF liver right you're a LIF liver though you live your life in front of people that is the greatest sermon that could ever be but I want to ask you one more time can you read we can all read the outside of the book cuz that was where brother ran restored all everything back to the faith of the fathers like in the first church Age first two three Church ages but can you not just read that Unwritten part be it be that Unwritten part can you can you do that job said oh that my words were now written oh that they were printed in a book that they were Graven with an iron pin and led in the rock forever all that led him to one thing a revelation that his Redeemer lived yes for I know that my redeemer liveth and he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I'll see God Matthew 5:8 blessed are the pure in heart for they shall understand God or see God whom I shall see for myself and mine eyes Shall Behold and not another this is back to job though my Reigns be consumed within me Malachi 4 Malachi 3 sorry then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written WR before him for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name his name know who he was know where he's at so I have one more question what part of you have you have you took yourself to say Lord I know the I know what went on I know that from 1943 to 19 1947 to 1963 you were restoring everything back like it was back in the first church age but then you gave a man a vision and that Vision was all that was written on the outside so that man could see it cuz you're written Epistles remember I went back to you are written Epistles known and read of all men they read your life whatever what's the statement I read you like a I can read you like a book why cuz that's what you are you are a book but are you has it been revealed to you that you not only see the unwritten part but you are the Unwritten part brother brandham in The Sixth Seal he said it's gone from you it's not for you it's not for you to understand but it is for us amen they didn't get that Unwritten part you and I did sure brother brandham gave us the message but it laid there dormant for years oh yeah there were people getting saved getting full of the Holy Ghost no no no problem with that but I'm talking about a body Chang people a people that the unwritten part who in the world where in the Bible is it written that Abraham and Sarah took a body chain I'm waiting nowhere but if you read it with Revelation that's exactly what happened but it took a prophet to tell us that brother John or we would kept reading it kept reading it said well they were just old and had a bunch of kids no they got turned back young they had a body change that was the unwritten part you and I at the end time we're that Unwritten part we have a part to play and you're part of it if you want to be you can get inside that pyramid and you can read what man has never ever even looked on before listen even your life even your life reflects it the world can't live the Bible they can cuss and still be a Christian women can wear their pants and still be a Christian that ain't what the Bible says we have that Unwritten part and we're living that Unwritten part that's what I want you to get today you are the unwritten part that no man on the Earth is going to understand except the Bride of Jesus Christ in the end time no one's going to understand it except brother Brown said a special good people and I believe you're it I believe we're here for a purpose we're not here just to be taking up space but if you don't know God today you better hurry up the doors is getting closed and when and God's going to close them listen if he left up to all of us um we would we would we would go on and on till till we try to get everybody saved but remember God knows that he could have give somebody a million years he could have give Adolf Hitler a million years to live and he'd have never come to a day of repent God knows that cuz he's infinite you and I don't we keep preaching hoping that everybody's going to come in but so did Noah but all of a sudden God said get in the ark Noah you're finished with your message get in the ark and he got in the ark and he didn't want to shut the door God shut the door that's what the third pull is folks we are not going to be a foolish group of people in the end time we're going to know what God wants we're going to know when he wants it we're going to know what to do with it everybody with me let's sing a song God bless you what do you see in this message [Music] in they were what they weren't playing cards they were praying they weren't sleeping they were they predicament they need to get out

think sometimes we do we try to figure things out that's going on in our life yes he said cast your burdens on me he didn't say you try to figure them out yourself he said You cast those burd on me and I'll take care of them for you I believe this message is the only truth there is and I'd physically fight somebody if they want to fight about it remember that brother that brother R said he was going to have hold a meeting and he was in there uh getting the building ready who was that I don't believe it was but he yeah he told the he told a story you know the brothers the brothers rinse his place out you know and he's he's wiping stuff down and he's getting everything ready and and the book bully of the the bully of the Town walked in the guy that thought he knew everything and he said who told you you could have this building he said so and so he said well I'm the so and so and so and so and my name's so and so and you can't rent that building until you fight me he said the man just got down off the ladder and laid his paintbrush down he didn't pray what did he say he said every time I hit that man's face he said I must fight that I may win I must fight that I may win and I believe that's the one of the meetings that somebody either Dwight moody or somebody got saved in because that man stood up to that bully well the devil's the only bully you got to worry about the devil's not a bully I mean God's not a bully I must fight that I may win you got to say that everything you go through I got to fight that I may win cuz we're Overcomers hallelujah thank it's not easy folks you know that you just been in a Christian way for a while you know it's not but listen what little bit of discomfort we have CU all the world says it's comfortable we can drink we can smoke we can you know we don't have to go to church if we don't want to there's an eternity facing every one of us today yes sir eternity not time not just just an era not just a time of life there's eternity facing each one of us today and you going to bet on this world which is only temporal I look in the other day you uh there's a house over on my route and a lady died and nobody took it over she had lived in in probably 10 years and I've been delivering that route about 10 years and brother Danny that house has just sit there nobody's done anything to it but that house has gradually collapsed just sitting there just because of age Brother Gary saying I know just because of age and time and a man told me one time he said the reason that happens is there's no life in that house you think about that in your spiritual walk if you're devoid of God your house is crumbling but if you got life in your house don't worry he'll take care of us all that's not a promise from me I can't promise you that that's a promise from the word of God that says we're going to make it let's just be the house of God let God live in our house it's his anyway you have to crawl over the cross to get to hell you know hell was not created for us or or the world it was created for for the devil and his angels we just decided some people just going to decide to go there and be devoid of God there will be nothing Eternal listen that's another thing hell hell's not Eternal if hell's Eternal they got eternal life how simple is that of a doctrine that boy now the Catholics and everybody else will say yeah you're going to burn eternally no you're not going to burn eternally you're just going to go away you're just going to go away you won't even be sorry I can't be forgotten amen is everybody listening to me I can't be forgotten if you're born again today you can for an eternity not be forgotten Hall cuz the Bible says I'm engraved in the palms of that man's hand and that's eternal life that's what I put my whole future on there's a lot of things people put their future on please start putting it on Jesus Christ and his healing his Deliverance his power whatever ever you got he'll take it away
