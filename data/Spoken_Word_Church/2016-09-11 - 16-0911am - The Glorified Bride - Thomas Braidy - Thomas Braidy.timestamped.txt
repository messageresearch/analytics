[15:03] like everybody said and all you know it
[15:05] was one year to the day from the time
[15:07] Brother Gary Atkins passed away that
[15:10] that Brother Richard passed away so it

[16:04] together as one in in the Lord and all
[16:06] is good to to be there so what we're
[16:10] going to do is just have a few moments
[16:12] of Silent prayer this morning in honor
[16:14] of our brother as he's has passed on and
[16:18] uh you know to his reward and I'm really
[16:21] jealous of him in the basis that I don't
[16:23] have mine yet and uh you know and but I
[16:26] like that way of going if he's going to
[16:27] go if I have to go I want to go real
[16:29] fast and I've I've always said to my
[16:32] wife you know just take me out throw me
[16:34] on the side of the road it doesn't make
[16:36] no difference cuz a there ain't nothing
[16:38] there to that she says you ain't going
[16:40] to get to tell nobody what to do when
[16:42] that comes we'll take care of it okay
[16:45] all right but you know we are
[16:48] uh death is not horrible to a
[16:52] Christian it's a departing yes but it's
[16:54] not a horrible thing it's it's it's a
[16:57] good thing you know to do good to see
[16:59] brother Kern there with us and you know
[17:01] let's just take just a few moments and
[17:04] just have a a little silent prayer and

[1:23:11] right and so I could tell a little of
[1:23:14] what I see or what I
[1:23:18] learn even how get there
[1:23:23] but brand was going to
[1:23:25] England and it spreads
[1:23:29] around right and if you
[1:23:32] read B told about it when this

[1:23:57] meeting and on the
[1:23:59] way they try to get
[1:24:04] her to England to be prayed
[1:24:08] for and the story starts like
[1:24:14] that there
[1:24:18] is a man from Canada lives in
[1:24:23] Ireland re race
[1:24:27] horses that's the part of
[1:24:30] it
[1:24:32] okay and uh he buys race
[1:24:37] horses for the queen Queen have a lot of
[1:24:42] resources and so
[1:24:45] forth and that man would come yearly
[1:24:48] also to stay in the house for a month or
[1:24:53] so and this one that works for the queen
[1:24:57] in
[1:24:59] England right he was sent to the what
[1:25:03] you call it
[1:25:05] Derby he here down there that's where
[1:25:08] you get your best arst to buy and things
[1:25:12] like that so he's supposed to go down
[1:25:16] there and by house is for the
[1:25:20] queen and so
[1:25:23] he stopped by maybe they don't know that
[1:25:27] and the same man would stop at the house
[1:25:31] where this man from Ireland he's from
[1:25:32] Canada he lives there yeah and would buy
[1:25:35] race
[1:25:36] horses also so he sto for two or 3 days
[1:25:40] and he would shoot
[1:25:43] there okay if you follow me a little bit
[1:25:47] and so that's
[1:25:48] how it comes
[1:25:51] up
[1:25:53] right so he knew
[1:25:55] somebody in um
[1:25:59] Texas right and they were talking how
[1:26:03] the king is sick and in

[1:26:11] other it starts right there and you know
[1:26:16] and I know the English people don't
[1:26:18] believe in the American
[1:26:20] religion okay they mock the preachers
[1:26:23] and things like that but somehow they
[1:26:26] were just
[1:26:27] talking right so he met with that one
[1:26:30] down
[1:26:32] there right and he was just
[1:26:35] talking and the one in Texas I found it
[1:26:39] in my wife's diary cuz she get
