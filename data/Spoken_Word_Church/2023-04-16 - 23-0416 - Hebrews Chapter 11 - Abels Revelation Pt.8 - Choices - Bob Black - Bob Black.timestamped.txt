[0:00] God bless you and good morning
[0:06] we battled it out this morning we drove
[0:09] and we're here and we made a choice to
[0:12] come and and Worship the Lord
[0:15] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[0:16] this morning isn't it
[0:21] see if we can get this on there we go
[0:23] um this first one's a little bit small
[0:25] so just hang in there with me
[0:28] and I'll read it and we'll just kind of
[0:30] get this started I wanted to read this
[0:32] quote um as we continue on our study of
[0:35] Cain and Abel because really the whole
[0:39] story of what happened in in Genesis is
[0:42] a story about choice and uh this this
[0:45] might be kind of something to set the
[0:47] set the tone for this little Sunday
[0:49] school lesson this morning
[0:51] um brother Branham and thy loving
[0:52] kindness was he was he was having an
[0:54] altar call and he asked everybody to
[0:56] raise their hands if they wanted to give
[0:57] their life to the Lord and then then he
[0:59] asked them you know those that Rose your
[1:00] hands come on up to the front come on up
[1:02] and he was surprised as he was preaching
[1:05] that a lot of people that raised their
[1:06] hands wouldn't come up so he was he
[1:09] began to talk to them like hey like I'm
[1:11] are you really sincere about it did you
[1:14] know you raised your hands but then you
[1:15] don't want to come up
[1:16] you don't want to make a move unless
[1:19] let's see what he said now he said I
[1:21] want you people to look here
[1:22] I want you ministers
[1:24] can you see what tear tears the heart of
[1:27] a Preacher can you see what tears the
[1:29] Holy Spirit when people will raise their
[1:31] hands that they'll do that and then
[1:32] we'll sit there and won't move what's
[1:34] left but judgment you'll cry someday
[1:37] when I'm gone you remember that I speak
[1:39] in the name of Jesus Christ you'll long
[1:41] to hear these things and we'll never
[1:42] hear them come on come on now I invite
[1:45] you in Christ's name
[1:47] was you ashamed you raised your hand
[1:50] then you wouldn't make a good Christian
[1:51] to begin with that's awful rude but
[1:53] brother it's time that the gospel let us
[1:55] take take off the kid gloves and tell
[1:57] the truth Christ is here he's raised
[2:00] from the dead he's present that's the
[2:01] reason we do the way that we do
[2:04] come on now that's right raise up if
[2:07] Mama says sit down say mama you go with
[2:10] me if husband says you can't go or I'll
[2:12] leave you say goodbye come on we're
[2:14] going
[2:15] that's right that's the way to do it
[2:17] walk right up here and give your
[2:19] personal testimony come down out of the
[2:21] balcony you'd have been backslid you
[2:23] that's done wrong and want to make it
[2:25] right with God these are coming for
[2:28] testimony for healing we're going to
[2:30] have a little Revival started here as
[2:31] soon as you get to your feet and do
[2:33] something about it
[2:35] and now here's the main thing that I
[2:37] just want to kind of belabor this
[2:40] morning God is never going to pull you
[2:42] up in there you're going to walk under
[2:45] your own free will
[2:47] Now isn't that a wonderful thing to
[2:49] think about this morning that that when
[2:51] you believe God is not because somebody
[2:53] beats you into it or forced you or
[2:54] dragged you up to the altar or something
[2:56] because you made a choice that you
[2:59] wanted to accept God into your heart
[3:01] so let's just think about that as we as
[3:03] we kind of study on verse 4 that by
[3:06] faith Abel offered unto God a more
[3:08] excellent sacrifice than King by which
[3:11] he obtained witness that he was
[3:12] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[3:14] and body being dead yes speaketh
[3:16] Lord God we're so grateful to be able to
[3:18] gather around your word this morning
[3:20] Lord as we come Lord Jesus that people
[3:22] out and come Lord because they this
[3:24] morning because they were forced to come
[3:25] to church because they wanted to hear
[3:27] from you and Lord they've come with
[3:29] hungry Hearts this morning we just ask
[3:30] that you'll bless them Lord Jesus says
[3:32] As we study these things out and dive
[3:34] into your word Lord God and help us Lord
[3:37] that our hearts will be in the right
[3:38] place Lord God for the word that you've
[3:40] got in store for us today blessed
[3:42] brother Wade is he stood in Lord Jesus
[3:43] and bless all the people Lord God of
[3:45] gathered here today that you'll feed him
[3:47] Lord are we ask in your name amen now
[3:50] you think about that by faith Abel
[3:52] offered unto God a more excellent
[3:54] sacrifice than Cain and Abel made a
[3:57] choice that he was going to obey the
[3:59] revelation of God that he had heard this
[4:02] whole story from Adam and Eve is is
[4:04] about choice that Eve had a choice to go
[4:07] this way or that way and Adam had a
[4:09] choice to go this way or that way and I
[4:12] think really that that to know that to
[4:15] kind of give us Liberty this morning to
[4:16] think about now God the greatest example
[4:19] of a parent I think about this a great
[4:22] example of a parent step back and let
[4:25] his kids make a choice
[4:28] oh
[4:30] you gotta you gotta oh you think how it
[4:34] just messes everything up it messes
[4:36] everything up if like a minister put
[4:37] somebody in a headlock and says you're
[4:38] going to be a Christian it messes
[4:40] everything up if a parent just grabs her
[4:43] kid and said you're going to do what I
[4:44] tell you you're going to be a CR you
[4:46] can't you can't be a Christian that way
[4:47] you can't you can't be a good you can't
[4:50] be a good citizen that way
[4:52] if you just made to do things you know I
[4:55] was I was thinking of um you know uh as
[4:58] my kids leave and go go a different way
[5:00] it just would mess everything up if I
[5:03] just grabbed them by the nape of their
[5:04] neck and said you're going to come to
[5:06] this church do you see if they got to
[5:08] make their own choice they got to make
[5:10] their own way and and God you think
[5:12] about God the greatest example of a
[5:14] parent pulled himself back and said
[5:15] there I'm gonna watch and see what they
[5:18] do and now you the reason I say it
[5:21] should give us Liberty this morning is
[5:23] like a lot of times you know parents
[5:24] they'll you'll feel guilty about the way
[5:27] things turned out and stuff but you know
[5:29] if that was a pretty bad situation that
[5:32] happened in the Garden of Eden and you
[5:33] can't get a better parent than God
[5:35] sometimes you do the very best you can
[5:37] and because everybody has to make their
[5:40] own choice
[5:41] sometimes your kids will make a choice
[5:44] that that you didn't really want them to
[5:46] make but you see it's not necessary
[5:48] sometimes we make mistakes and things
[5:50] but you know when you've done the very
[5:52] best you can you can't you you can and
[5:54] they just they they're gonna they're
[5:56] gonna make their own choice because they
[5:58] have a soul they have a soul and and
[6:01] they're gonna do what they're gonna do
[6:02] and you pray for them and and you you
[6:05] trust that God will bring them back
[6:06] around but ultimately I'm trying to but
[6:10] let's be be freed of your guilt I've
[6:13] heard so many sermons you know coming up
[6:15] and things about people say well it's
[6:17] your fault the way that your kids turned
[6:19] out how about have a little bit of
[6:21] Liberty and trust that even if you made
[6:23] a mistake that God will bring them back
[6:25] around how about have a little bit of
[6:27] Liberty and just trust it even when
[6:29] you've done the best you can that
[6:31] sometimes sometimes they they're gonna
[6:33] because they have their own soul they're
[6:35] gonna do they're going to go their own
[6:37] path in life
[6:38] and it's maybe not your fault
[6:41] sometimes this stuff happens
[6:44] I I I I see I believe the gospel is an
[6:48] encouraging gospel I believe the gospel
[6:50] is a gospel to lift you up and look at
[6:52] this situation and gain gain
[6:54] encouragement from it the situation of
[6:56] this this story that you can look at in
[6:57] the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve had a
[7:00] choice and they had their own their
[7:02] ability to go this way or that way Cain
[7:05] and Abel had a choice they had an
[7:07] ability to with the same uh Cain and
[7:12] Abel had heard the same gospel the same
[7:14] stories and they both had the same
[7:16] opportunity to accept or reject
[7:20] and the serpent of seed brother Brown
[7:21] said but by spiritual Revelation Abel
[7:24] knew it was blood so he brought a lamb
[7:27] hacked its throat and it died and God
[7:29] said that's right that's what done it it
[7:32] was blood and you know what blood I'm
[7:34] talking about all right it was blood
[7:36] that did it now watch now all you think
[7:39] Abel coming up realizing that he was in
[7:42] a he was in a situation
[7:44] and he needed a redeemer he needed
[7:46] something to take he needed something to
[7:48] die for him if we could all realize if
[7:51] we could realize that we need a savior
[7:53] that we were like David said I was
[7:55] shaping and iniquity and his sanded my
[7:57] mother can see we could realize that
[7:59] that our our soul was we were born
[8:02] carnal our spirit was carnal our flesh
[8:05] was carnal everything about us with
[8:08] carnal our thoughts are carnal our whole
[8:10] makeup is perverted by our natural birth
[8:13] and we needed something what we needed
[8:16] was a redeemer to come and die for us
[8:18] and give his own blood his life so that
[8:21] that life could come and Tabernacle back
[8:24] in our lives and burn out all the
[8:27] carnality with the Holy Ghost and Fire
[8:29] and see that's what Christ came to die
[8:31] on the cross for us to pay the price for
[8:34] everything that the serpent did
[8:36] and get rid of it right and overcome it
[8:39] oh you see when you're born again that's
[8:41] what that process starts that God is
[8:43] slowly overtake it overcoming your life
[8:47] claiming you and taking you over and
[8:50] burning out every bit of carnality in
[8:53] your life so you think different you
[8:54] walk different you act different
[8:56] like in Ephesians 2 3 it says among whom
[8:59] we all all had in our conversation in
[9:01] time passed in the lust of Flesh
[9:03] fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and
[9:05] of the mind and we're by nature of the
[9:06] children of Wrath even as others by
[9:10] Nature by your natural birth you just
[9:13] everything was was messed up
[9:15] that's why in John chapter 3 he said as
[9:18] Moses lifted up the serpent in the
[9:19] wilderness even so must the son of man
[9:22] be lifted up that whosoever believeth in
[9:24] him should not perish and and I want to
[9:27] continue to belabor that point that we
[9:29] believe whosoever whoever wants to has
[9:33] an opportunity
[9:34] not as some say uh you know that that
[9:37] there's only a certain group of people
[9:39] that even has the opportunity no
[9:41] everybody's got the opportunity and
[9:43] we'll see we'll we'll dive into what God
[9:45] told Cain there why don't you do like
[9:47] your brother
[9:49] sin lies at the door and you're going to
[9:52] have you gotta if you've got a rule over
[9:55] it I ought to think this morning that
[9:57] you have an opportunity through what
[9:59] Christ did for you to rule over sin to
[10:03] rule over sin in your life that you
[10:06] don't have to continue being subject to
[10:09] pornography to Instagram addictions to
[10:12] all the stuff that you see on the
[10:13] internet that the smoking and the
[10:16] alcohol and and uh addicted to the lust
[10:19] of the Flesh and the pride of life
[10:21] addicted to your carnality that you can
[10:23] overcome those things by just believing
[10:26] and Lord Jesus Christ
[10:31] for Gods who love the world that he gave
[10:33] his only begotten son that whosoever
[10:35] believeth in him should not perish but
[10:37] have everlasting life
[10:39] that's what he died on the cross for
[10:40] right an invisible Union the bride of
[10:43] Christ brother Brown said life is a
[10:45] sacred thing to God and it's recorded in
[10:48] a book God is the author of Life do you
[10:51] believe that our natural life here we
[10:52] have is just to perversion
[10:55] because it started in the garden of ede
[10:57] it all got perverted it really should be
[10:59] the right life to begin with but it's
[11:01] perverted by the natural birth
[11:04] oh you say well not me yeah I come
[11:06] straight from Adam no it's it's
[11:09] perverted it was perverted by the by Eve
[11:11] taking the wrong thought in her mind
[11:13] every Everybody every person that was
[11:15] ever born was born perverted because
[11:17] ever because Eve's womb was perverted
[11:20] right every person in the world was
[11:23] perverted and came perverted because the
[11:25] in the in the flesh you got all twisted
[11:28] up with all the lines and everything all
[11:29] the lineage it's all perverted and
[11:32] that's why you need a savior
[11:34] the first life or your first Union you
[11:37] were joined in at Birth by Nature a
[11:38] natural act a natural human being
[11:41] associated man and woman together
[11:42] Associated together in sexual Affair
[11:45] which brought your first life here
[11:47] and that's associated with sin and death
[11:50] how can you miss seeing the serpent seat
[11:54] and from that time brother Brown said
[11:55] it's a perverted birth
[11:57] but when the new birth comes in it
[12:00] corrects that perverted birth
[12:04] and gives the eternal life through the
[12:06] father Jesus Christ yes all to think
[12:09] about what you think what what is the
[12:10] what does the new birth do the new birth
[12:13] corrects your life well we you can't get
[12:17] along with yourself and God gives you
[12:19] the new birth and and it begins to
[12:22] change you that's why we believe in this
[12:24] church that the new birth will change
[12:25] you you know you know all the
[12:28] denominational world says you come to
[12:29] come come as you are come to church we
[12:31] want you to come to church as you are
[12:33] but you ain't going to stay that way
[12:35] you're going to be changed because
[12:37] that's what the new birth is for to
[12:39] correct your carnal nature and change
[12:42] you from the creature that you once were
[12:43] to something new
[12:45] to be like Jesus Christ so what did the
[12:48] serpent seed do as the seed of the woman
[12:50] was literally God reproducing himself in
[12:53] human flesh an Ephesian Church age
[12:55] brother Adam said so the seed of the
[12:57] serpent is the literal way
[13:00] that Satan found he was able to open the
[13:02] door to himself into the human race it
[13:05] was impossible for Satan for he is only
[13:07] a created spirit being to reproduce
[13:10] himself in the manner which God
[13:11] reproduced himself
[13:13] so the Genesis account tells how he
[13:15] produced his seed and entered introduced
[13:18] or injected himself into the human race
[13:22] I also recall that Satan is called the
[13:24] serpent it is his seed or injection into
[13:28] the human race that we are speaking of
[13:32] so let me I just read a selection of
[13:35] quotes that I found about what brother
[13:36] Randall said how can you believe
[13:38] how can you believe somebody that's born
[13:40] from their carnal natural birth how can
[13:42] you believe
[13:43] when there's nothing there to believe
[13:45] with
[13:46] what you got just a carnal mind
[13:49] through mental conception you can't do
[13:52] it
[13:53] to the world and the next quote it's
[13:56] carnal mind it's foolishness but to them
[13:58] that believe it's everlasting life
[14:00] that's why you got to get born again you
[14:02] got to be born again so you can even
[14:04] believe what is being born being born
[14:06] again positions you to believe because
[14:09] now you got the believer the one that
[14:11] wrote the word living inside of you and
[14:14] now when you read the word he's there to
[14:15] interpret the word to you now you can
[14:17] believe it you you can't even believe
[14:20] until you're born again you're believing
[14:22] with your own faith trying to get to a
[14:24] place and but when God puts his life in
[14:27] you now you can read the Bible that's
[14:29] why the Bible the Bible isn't even for
[14:31] the unbeliever
[14:32] maybe we'll bring you to a knowledge
[14:34] that you need salvation but when you're
[14:36] filled with the Holy Ghost then you can
[14:37] read the Bible and understand it a
[14:40] Christian Spirit Bears record with
[14:42] Christ's Spirit brother said see and
[14:44] you'll call everything of God Gods but
[14:47] if you're carnal minded
[14:49] you'll make fun and laugh at the Holy
[14:51] Ghost the spiritual man has a spiritual
[14:54] soul that can never die and the carnal
[14:56] man has a religious atmosphere around
[14:58] him and wants to worship and so forth
[15:00] but his carnal not an unbeliever but a
[15:04] carnal believer and it's the kind was
[15:06] rejected he said you don't know what
[15:08] pleasure is
[15:10] till you really get those carnal Roots
[15:12] out of your heart and get God in there
[15:15] where you can fellowship and worship God
[15:18] and rejoice and sing in the spirit and
[15:21] wash his feet like a real lady or
[15:23] gentleman house under control and your
[15:26] children all obedient say what is
[15:28] Satan's injection do injecting carnality
[15:31] what is the life of God do it overcomes
[15:34] all that carnality it uproots it it gets
[15:37] it out of you
[15:39] that's why he said in a blushing prophet
[15:41] he said bring us back to God not with an
[15:44] injection of Education
[15:46] not with an injection of religious
[15:48] Reformation not in the injection of some
[15:52] kind of man-made theology but an
[15:54] old-fashioned baptism of the Holy Ghost
[15:57] sent down from God out of heaven and a
[16:00] Pentecostal experience of burning out
[16:03] the carnality and replacing in there the
[16:05] jewel that's calling there of a son and
[16:08] daughter of God
[16:09] until we do that brothers and sisters we
[16:12] will still have Bob here make up on sexy
[16:15] looking women and men drinking smoking
[16:17] and calling themselves Christians
[16:18] because they don't know no better and in
[16:22] their heart that very root of carnality
[16:24] lays there
[16:26] now I got this picture of the fire of
[16:29] the holy ghost in a in a new believer's
[16:31] heart burning burning out that carnality
[16:34] what's this got to do with the story of
[16:36] Abel because when Abel come with his
[16:39] faith we're bringing that blood offering
[16:42] his faith was accepted by God how was it
[16:45] accepted and we're gonna if we're kind
[16:48] of running out of time here so I just
[16:49] want to I just want to lay this out it
[16:51] was accepted by fire that God came down
[16:54] and consumed that sacrifice just like he
[16:57] consumed so many other sacrifices when
[17:00] they were offered Moses sacrificed and
[17:01] Gideon's sacrificing Solomon the
[17:03] sacrifice at the temple and brother
[17:05] Branham said he accepted Abel's
[17:06] Sacrifice by consuming it he came down
[17:09] with fire and that's how he'll accept
[17:11] your sacrifice your sacrifice where you
[17:13] lay down all the all of your carnality
[17:15] and say I don't want it anymore I don't
[17:17] want my old life anymore I want to die
[17:19] to myself and you come and lay yourself
[17:21] on the altar of self-sacrifice and lay
[17:24] yourself down and God will accept that
[17:27] sacrifice and fill you with the Holy
[17:29] Ghost and Fire to burn out every bit of
[17:31] carnality in your life
[17:33] that's right
[17:36] but around said in Ministry explained he
[17:39] said what is sin
[17:40] what is sin not drinking not smoking not
[17:43] gambling not rejecting Church sin is
[17:47] unbelief
[17:48] is that right he that believeth not is
[17:50] condemned already
[17:52] see you're not you did not you're not
[17:53] destroyed or separated from God because
[17:56] you're a sinner you're separated to God
[17:58] from God because you refuse to walk with
[18:01] him to walk in his provided way
[18:05] you got death and life before you just
[18:08] like Adam and Eve Every Man's a free
[18:12] moral agent and sitting here this
[18:14] morning you've got a choice you gotta
[18:17] whatever condition your life is if
[18:19] you're a sinner needing a savior if
[18:20] you're if you're been born again and
[18:22] you're needing the Capstone if you're at
[18:24] the Capstone and you're needing that
[18:26] body change you got a choice you're
[18:28] sitting there you had a choice this
[18:30] morning whether or not to come to church
[18:31] you might have been laying there and in
[18:33] your pains and your aches and stuff but
[18:35] you made a choice to come whether or not
[18:37] you like the preachers or not whether or
[18:39] not you like the choice that the church
[18:41] you had a choice whether or not to get
[18:44] up and come and and and you see that's
[18:46] what brother Brown looks is playing in
[18:48] here everybody is a free moral agent
[18:50] that you have a choice whether to accept
[18:53] or reject
[18:55] just like Adam and Eve every man that
[18:58] means Cain had a choice everybody that
[19:01] had a little bit of King's DNA has a
[19:03] choice because listen listen it's not
[19:05] the flesh that determines whether or not
[19:08] you can make a choice or not it's
[19:09] whether or not you got a soul and I
[19:12] wanted to believe her that point this
[19:13] morning that Cain had a soul even though
[19:16] in his flesh he was you know he had come
[19:19] from maybe that weird lineage and
[19:20] everything and had all something
[19:22] something just to be carnal a little bit
[19:24] something looked like one come from one
[19:26] of them talk shows you know where
[19:27] they're like let's
[19:29] now let's bring out the real father
[19:33] you know in that messed up situation but
[19:36] yeah he had a choice
[19:38] because he had a soul and every man
[19:41] woman and child in this building this
[19:43] morning has a has yeah I I see you
[19:46] laughing I'll give you something to
[19:47] laugh at this morning but it's you've
[19:49] got a you've got a choice because you
[19:52] have a soul the soul is what allows you
[19:55] to make a choice
[19:59] and the tree of life and tree of death
[20:01] is before us all you can take either one
[20:03] you wish to it depends on what tree you
[20:06] eat off of is what you are that's right
[20:09] and God as God created you a free moral
[20:12] agent to do whatever you want to do
[20:15] about it he can't make you love him and
[20:18] he don't force you to love him
[20:21] he can't make you love him
[20:24] oh you see that's why sometimes Ministry
[20:26] we're preaching when we preach we're
[20:27] really preaching from our experience I I
[20:30] never gave my heart to the Lord because
[20:31] somebody forced me into it I gave my
[20:34] heart to the Lord because one day I
[20:35] heard God calling me and it wasn't like
[20:38] a all of a voice but I felt that tug in
[20:40] my heart as you see it's not
[20:43] you know it's
[20:46] I'll just keep reading
[20:49] and the unity of one God and the one
[20:51] Church Brothers said did you think that
[20:54] in this Russia they have got a false
[20:55] Pentecost they are that's the work of
[20:57] the devil they're trying to force all
[20:59] men into communism wherever man has
[21:01] everything commonly
[21:03] do you know that see what the problem
[21:04] with Communism was the problem with
[21:06] Augustine was he was trying to force
[21:08] somebody to believe it but you can't be
[21:10] forced into doing it
[21:12] right they're trying to force all men
[21:13] into communism wherever man has
[21:15] everything commonly do you know that was
[21:17] the condition of the church under the
[21:19] Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost of
[21:21] the people sold their possessions and
[21:23] lay them at the feet of the disciples
[21:24] and they distributed them to every man
[21:26] as they had need and now the devil's
[21:29] come around and got into the world and
[21:30] made a political power to force man to
[21:33] do that
[21:34] God does not force man to do anything
[21:36] you do it on your own free will that's
[21:41] what that when brother Brown was
[21:42] witnessing to that that man with the The
[21:44] Apple Tree the Infidel and and he was he
[21:46] was that he you threw that back in
[21:48] brother around his face he said y'all
[21:50] y'all are constantly trying to pull for
[21:52] money trying to get people but brother
[21:54] I'm said but that we do live off
[21:56] people's Free Will offering but we're
[21:59] not forcing them to do that you you see
[22:02] what it would be a mess up if you if you
[22:04] were just forcing people to give money
[22:06] or forcing people to do but we're not
[22:08] forced to do anything we come of our own
[22:10] free will we do of our own free will
[22:13] because we've heard of from God
[22:15] and the God of this evil ladies brother
[22:16] said the outside man is a physical being
[22:19] which is controlled by six senses
[22:21] where five senses rather the Inside Man
[22:23] is a spirit man which is controlled by
[22:25] five senses conscience and love and so
[22:28] forth the outside man see taste feels
[22:31] smell and hear but the inside of that
[22:34] spirit is a soul and it's controlled by
[22:37] one thing your free will
[22:40] you can accept what the devil says or
[22:43] accept What God Says and that'll
[22:45] determine what spirit is in there if
[22:48] it's the spirit of God it'll feed on the
[22:50] things of God and it won't feed on
[22:52] anything of the world Jesus said if you
[22:55] love the world of the things of the
[22:57] world it's because the love of God has
[22:59] not even entered this inner part Satan
[23:02] has deceived you and man shall not live
[23:05] by bread alone but by every word that
[23:07] proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[23:11] my brother Adam said in the unity of one
[23:13] God and now I've just got two slides and
[23:15] then we'll stop there he said there's so
[23:17] many people today who says that the holy
[23:19] spirit is not real today while tens of
[23:22] thousands of them and millions are
[23:23] saying it's not so there's that many
[23:25] enjoying the blessings of it and we'll
[23:28] just skip down to the end it says he
[23:30] fills you with power he fills you with
[23:32] the spirit he fills you with his own
[23:34] divine nature and he changes your carnal
[23:37] nature into his nature then in this you
[23:41] become a new creature in Christ
[23:45] and that's why Abel brought a lamb
[23:47] because he knew he needed a way back
[23:50] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[23:54] excellent sacrifice than Cain by which
[23:56] he obtained witness that he was
[23:58] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[24:01] and by it being dead yet speaketh
[24:04] brother Randall said here come a little
[24:06] old Abel pulling that Lamb with a
[24:08] spiritual Revelation that he know that
[24:10] it wasn't fruit that brought them out of
[24:12] the Garden of Eden he knowed it was
[24:14] blood and life don't lay in Plants it
[24:18] lay in blood
[24:21] that's why what did he have a revelation
[24:22] of life he knew he was dead he was dying
[24:26] and he needed life
[24:28] here he come with a little string
[24:30] wrapped around a grapevine wrapped
[24:32] around that little lamb throwed him up
[24:34] there and said this is it lore now
[24:39] that's what faith is Faith is a
[24:42] revelation personally to you and we'll
[24:44] stop on the stop on this thought oh yeah
[24:46] I was thinking this morning of all the
[24:48] times that people have told me that I
[24:50] was my Doctrine was wrong and the things
[24:52] that I believe was wrong now look look
[24:54] back in your own I'm not trying to just
[24:55] make a flipping statement but people
[24:57] will tell you that you're believing
[24:59] wrong or whatever but faith when you can
[25:02] tie it back into every type in the Bible
[25:03] and run through the Bible and know that
[25:05] God has given you a spiritual Revelation
[25:07] that's something that you can hang on to
[25:10] brother Brandon said faith is the will
[25:13] of God and when God gives you a
[25:15] revelation you have the will of God and
[25:18] that is something that you can stand in
[25:20] with his Surety knowing that you know
[25:22] what direction you should go you know
[25:25] what you should do and you know the God
[25:28] that you serve and what church you
[25:30] should go to and where you should work
[25:31] and what the will of God and purpose for
[25:34] God is in your life and that is faith
[25:37] and we'll stop there God bless you
[25:39] [Applause]
