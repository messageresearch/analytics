[7:28] good to be here on a Friday night
[7:32] you're not thinking
[7:35] sometimes you get in trouble when you
[7:36] think but I was thinking
[7:40] you know about this time 2000 years ago
[7:45] he was dead
[7:47] up
[7:48] they'd already took him off the cross
[7:51] they'd already put him in a tomb
[7:53] it was over
[7:55] their man
[7:57] of the hour had died yeah that's right
[8:02] and every devil in hell thought they'd
[8:04] silenced him that's right even the Devil
[8:06] Himself
[8:09] Caiaphas was probably shining his shoes
[8:12] getting ready for
[8:13] the Sabbath
[8:16] and everything is going to continue on
[8:19] like it is
[8:20] we've got rid of this
[8:22] guy that causes so much problems and and
[8:26] we've silenced him
[8:28] we've took him away
[8:30] we've done our job
[8:33] glory to Jehovah
[8:35] they just didn't realize
[8:38] amen all right
[8:40] that's right
[8:40] [Applause]
[8:45] something had to die
[8:47] Our God had to die
[8:50] so that we could live
[8:51] and tonight let's not be dead
[8:54] right we died
[8:56] if you're born again tonight you're dead
[8:58] already
[8:59] hey man
[9:00] don't want any of me to be alive because
[9:02] that's when I get in troubles when me
[9:04] pops up amen
[9:07] but remember
[9:09] he might have been dead and cold in the
[9:11] grave the prophet said
[9:13] but he was still working that's right
[9:16] he was still preaching even when he was
[9:18] dead
[9:19] amen he was still preaching he went down
[9:22] and preached to the souls in hell that
[9:24] didn't have a chance but he told him
[9:25] anyway he said I'm the one you missed
[9:27] that's right let's don't let that happen
[9:30] to us amen amen let's get ourselves
[9:34] straight now and we won't have to worry
[9:36] about that
[9:37] we'll have to worry about God coming and
[9:39] knocking on our door and said you should
[9:40] have right I came to you and you turned
[9:44] me down
[9:46] because that's what they did and he went
[9:48] down to witness well you know what he
[9:50] came back up
[9:51] yes sir he came back up
[9:55] and he told us we could walk in newness
[9:57] of life
[9:59] so tonight
[10:00] something had to die amen so that
[10:03] something had to live and man what you

[22:10] amen
[22:12] again a little bit of a lengthy reading
[22:14] here tonight I'm going to read Saint
[22:15] Matthew chapter 27.
[22:17] amen and we're going to go down
[22:19] let's just start at verse 30 33. and
[22:23] then we'll we'll read down a ways from
[22:25] there
[22:26] so the scripture says here and when they
[22:28] were common to the place called Golgotha
[22:30] that is to say a place of a skull
[22:33] they gave him vinegar to drink mingled
[22:36] with gall and when he had tasted thereof
[22:38] he would not dream
[22:40] and they crucified him and parted his
[22:42] garments casting lots that it might be
[22:45] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[22:46] prophet they parted my garments among
[22:49] them and upon my Vester did they cast
[22:51] lots
[22:52] and sitting down that watched him there
[22:55] they sat down and watched it you know
[22:57] why
[22:59] set up over his head his accusation
[23:01] written this is Jesus the king of the
[23:04] Jews
[23:06] and then there were two thieves
[23:07] crucified with him one on the right hand
[23:09] and another on the left and they that
[23:12] passed by reviled him wagging their
[23:14] heads and saying thou that destroy us
[23:17] the temple and build us to in three days
[23:19] save thyself if thou be the Son of God
[23:23] come down from the cross
[23:26] likewise also the chief priest smoking
[23:28] and with the scribes and Elders said he
[23:30] saved others himself he cannot save if
[23:34] he be the king of Israel let him come
[23:35] let him now come down from the cross and
[23:37] we will believe him
[23:39] he trusted in God let him deliver him
[23:41] now
[23:43] as you talk about just the arrogance
[23:45] amen
[23:48] if he will he said he trusted in God let
[23:50] him deliver him now if he will have him
[23:53] for he said I am the son of God
[23:56] the thieves also which were crucified
[23:58] with them cast the same in his teeth
[24:01] and now from the sixth hour there was
[24:03] Darkness over all the land unto the
[24:04] ninth hour and about the ninth hour
[24:06] Jesus cried with a loud voice saying Eli
[24:09] Eli Lamas that is to say my God my God
[24:12] why hast Thou forsaken me
[24:15] some of them that stood there when they
[24:17] had heard that said This Man Called for
[24:19] Elias
[24:20] straightway one of them ran and took a
[24:22] sponge and filled it with vinegar and
[24:24] put it on a reed and gave him the drink
[24:25] and the rest said let be let us see
[24:28] whether Elias will come to save him
[24:31] Jesus when he cried again with the loud
[24:33] voice yielded up The Ghost and behold
[24:35] the veil of the temple was rent and
[24:36] Twain From the top to the bottom and the
[24:38] Earth did quake and the Rocks rent
[24:41] the graves were open to many bodies of
[24:43] the Saints which slept arose and came
[24:46] out of the graves after his resurrection
[24:48] and went into the holy city and appeared
[24:50] unto many
[24:52] and now on the Centurion and them that
[24:54] were and they that were with him
[24:55] watching Jesus saw the earthquake and
[24:58] those things that were done they feared
[25:00] greatly
[25:01] saying truly
[25:03] this was the sun god
[25:06] this was the son of God I think you know
[25:09] if they really had a revelation they
[25:10] would say this is the Son of God right
[25:12] truly this is the Son of God God bless
[25:15] you may be seated here tonight amen
[25:19] yes
[25:22] let's just start this off right and get
[25:24] some water right amen
[25:26] that we're trying to pump amen
[25:30] brother wait I did I couldn't hear that
[25:35] brother Wade took notice of my tile when
[25:37] I came in the door tonight and I said
[25:38] when I get you know hot or whatever I'm
[25:40] just taking I'm gonna throw it to you
[25:42] say here by the way
[25:43] my wife says no you can't do that so
[25:47] amen we'll let them fight it out or
[25:48] whatever but
[25:50] all right we're gonna we're gonna do a
[25:52] little time traveling this evening is
[25:53] that all right amen and uh as much as I
[25:57] have on my plate here tonight or on my
[25:59] laptop here tonight I should say we're
[26:01] going to need to do some time traveling
[26:03] to get done so I'm gonna hurry just as
[26:04] fast as I can so I'm gonna pray and
[26:08] preach and you pray and pull yeah yes
[26:10] and we'll see how we can do with this
[26:12] amen and what I don't get done with
[26:14] we'll just leave it to brother Chris and
[26:15] he can do a much better job at it anyway
[26:17] so so here we'll go with this so anyways
[26:20] yeah I wanna I wanna go back in time
[26:22] tonight and uh
[26:23] not forward right now we're going to go
[26:25] back
[26:26] do you know Einstein and and the physics
[26:30] actually have proven that it is possible
[26:32] to travel forward in time mathematically
[26:36] it is possible to travel forward in time
[26:39] some have even posited that that that we
[26:43] all do a second or one point something
[26:45] seconds at times have you ever gone and
[26:47] you just feel like something is you know
[26:49] you just and they say that actually
[26:50] possibly possibly mathematically could
[26:54] be the human
[26:56] traveling forward his Consciousness
[26:58] traveling forward in time now I don't
[27:00] understand that and I don't know that I
[27:02] really believe that
[27:03] but math is something ain't it
[27:06] but now they say that the traveling back
[27:09] in time back into the past is an
[27:11] impossibility that is impossible
[27:14] Einstein said and the the physics say
[27:17] mathematically speaking they say it is
[27:20] impossible to erase the past to go back
[27:23] into change the past come on
[27:26] well now that might be true
[27:28] mathematically right
[27:30] but through the blood of our Lord Jesus
[27:33] right amen amen through the blood of
[27:35] Jesus we didn't do it in the first place
[27:38] we didn't do it in the first place what
[27:41] sins are you talking about right right I
[27:44] don't remember them no more
[27:47] they're thrown into the sea of God's
[27:49] forgetfulness
[27:50] and they're erased they're erased they
[27:53] said it's impossible not with my God all
[27:56] things are possible with my God right
[27:58] praise the Lord Jesus so we can we we
[28:01] can through through the the the
[28:03] supernatural DNA that we have within
[28:05] ourselves and I'm not talking about
[28:07] physically here tonight but but
[28:09] spiritually speaking we have God's DNA
[28:11] running through our veins and and making
[28:14] who we are and making this child of God
[28:17] up and everything else and and part of
[28:19] that spiritual DNA DNA that we have that
[28:22] that spiritual deity that we have he has
[28:25] he has formed eyes right his formed eyes
[28:29] I don't think it's with without
[28:31] coincidence I don't think it's
[28:32] coincidence that the prophet to this age
[28:35] would come to a little girl who is blind
[28:37] a little girl right would come and she
[28:39] was blind and didn't even have eyes but
[28:41] through the power of God he prayed a
[28:44] prayer and God formed eyes in her
[28:47] sockets right right and in the middle of
[28:49] it in the middle of he stops oh I forgot
[28:51] to ask you what color eyes do you want
[28:53] right what color eyes do you want she
[28:56] wanted blue if I remember right right
[28:58] the prettiest blue eyes you ever saw
[29:00] damn it come on man I I I I know they
[29:04] must have been if God formed those eyes
[29:06] amen right they they had to be somewhere
[29:09] set of eyes amen I would like to have
[29:10] seen a picture of that little girl when
[29:12] she grew up I bet those eyes were still
[29:14] just beautiful blue eyes
[29:16] but you think of the eyes that God has
[29:18] given you tonight that's right not these
[29:21] natural eyes not these natural eyes but
[29:24] the but a spiritual set about evil eyes
[29:26] right thing about an eagle
[29:29] come on oh look you gotta you got a hook
[29:31] right there that's pretty neat oh my
[29:34] God I'm easily impressed
[29:37] where's the cup holder
[29:39] no cup holder Brother come on that's
[29:42] coming okay
[29:46] God has given us eagle eyes
[29:50] there's just something about those eagle
[29:51] eyes right
[29:53] and through those eagle eyes that we've
[29:55] been given
[29:57] we're able to we're able to to see amen
[30:01] we can see ahead yep but we could also
[30:04] see back right you know the prophet made
[30:06] this statement talking about Adam and
[30:08] Eve and he said they drew Eve and your
[30:10] painter is this ugly little
[30:12] ugly looking thing right he said oh just
[30:14] awful just hoard what she looked like
[30:17] he said but no I believe that she was
[30:18] the just a beautiful that's right
[30:21] perfect specimen of a woman right she
[30:24] was exactly exactly he said she was
[30:27] blonde-headed right he said she was the
[30:30] perfect specimen the most beautiful
[30:32] woman in in the perfect statue and
[30:35] everything else and you and and and God
[30:37] you know allowed that Prophet to look
[30:39] back yes sir in time well I believe we
[30:42] can do the same thing not that we're
[30:43] prophets amen not that we're prophets
[30:46] don't get me wrong but I believe Through
[30:48] The Eyes of a prophet we can do that
[30:49] yeah and I believe Through The Eyes of
[30:52] Faith tonight we can do the same thing
[30:53] that's right brother and that's kind of
[30:55] what I want to try to do tonight yeah go
[30:57] ahead brother it's pretty bad I ain't
[30:58] even got started and I'm already
[31:00] unbutting in here
[31:03] so we're not bound by time tonight amen
[31:05] so so looking through these Supernatural
[31:07] eyes and
[31:09] these eyes that we get from our
[31:11] Supernatural father we look and we can
[31:13] travel back in time and we go back and
[31:15] back and back and all the way back
[31:18] we'll roll that calendar back and roll
[31:20] that clock back and now the date that
[31:22] I'm going to land on of course is April
[31:24] the 2nd
[31:25] I know today's April the 7th I didn't
[31:27] mistake that that's all right it's April
[31:30] the 2nd
[31:31] or as the Jewish calendar would call it
[31:34] the second day of this Nissan I think
[31:37] it's called I probably didn't pronounce
[31:38] that right
[31:40] which is the first month of the year for
[31:42] them right
[31:44] and the year is
[31:46] 33 A.D
[31:48] so if you go back to Good Friday they
[31:50] didn't even call it good Friday at that
[31:52] time they didn't know what was taking
[31:53] place but but if you go if you were to
[31:55] roll the calendars back all the way back
[31:57] 1990 years ago a good Friday lands on
[32:00] April the 2nd right an 80 30. wow that's
[32:04] ad33 not not two zero two three right 80
[32:08] 33.
[32:10] and and then actually if you go back
[32:13] here
[32:14] yeah oh I made a miscalculation good
[32:17] Friday lines on lands on April 3rd I
[32:20] want to go to April 2nd actually I'm
[32:23] gonna back up this a bit more there you
[32:25] go
[32:25] if you go back to April the second here
[32:27] the day before
[32:30] this day is called if you know you you
[32:32] look at it and if you you follow certain
[32:34] things brother Brown referred to the
[32:36] Holy Week in a couple of different
[32:37] places he never said the the they never
[32:40] said the passion week he said the Holy
[32:42] Week right now I do believe it was a
[32:43] passionate week I believe Jesus had
[32:45] plenty of passion for that week right
[32:47] amen but if we go back now to the
[32:50] Thursday before the Good Friday that day
[32:52] is actually called by by many by some of
[32:55] the Monday Thursday
[32:57] Monday Thursday is the day which com
[32:59] commemorates the last supper and the
[33:01] foot washing that immediately followed
[33:03] the Last Supper there amen and Monday is
[33:06] from the Latin word it means uh I think
[33:09] the word is is
[33:12] not Latin I can't say that
[33:15] close enough
[33:16] yeah it means commandment
[33:19] brother Bob could probably pronounce
[33:21] that just perfectly I can't do it
[33:24] but it means commandment and of course
[33:25] the Lord left us these Commandments
[33:27] right brother Brandon said that we have
[33:29] three Earthly Commandments that the Lord
[33:31] left us amen water baptism in the name
[33:33] of the Lord Jesus Christ right and then
[33:35] communion in football
[33:36] and on this day Monday Thursday there we
[33:39] were given two Commandments from the
[33:40] Lord to do this in remembrance of me
[33:43] right so it's Monday Thursday and so I'm
[33:46] going to go back I'm here now Monday
[33:48] Thursday
[33:50] and I want to be you know I'm going to
[33:51] be just an observer I'm going to use my
[33:52] eagle eyes a little bit tonight and I'm
[33:54] going to look at some things here and
[33:55] we're just an observer here for the
[33:57] purpose of this sermon here tonight so
[33:58] we're on April 2nd A.D 33 and then our
[34:02] observation Point we've got to have some
[34:03] place that we're looking at it from some
[34:05] point of perspective and the point of
[34:07] perspective that I'm taking here tonight
[34:08] is actually Perch Way up on top of the
[34:11] temple in Jerusalem so if you could kind
[34:13] of just fix it in your head tonight
[34:15] you're sitting on top of the Temple
[34:18] in Jerusalem
[34:20] on Nissan
[34:22] two
[34:24] 80 33.
[34:27] they didn't even know the days that they
[34:28] were still going you know the Jewish
[34:30] calendar still went by a whole different
[34:31] accounting system than that and
[34:34] but we're sitting up on top of the
[34:36] temple and the Temple's Dimensions here
[34:38] were given to us by Solomon and were
[34:40] given to Solomon and Solomon began to
[34:42] build it and he lays it out and he says
[34:43] it's 20 cubits wide by 60 cubits long
[34:46] and 30 cubits high right and and the
[34:49] Cubit Dimension is anywhere it's
[34:51] somewhere between 18 to 24 inches long
[34:54] now I'm not really good at math in a lot
[34:56] of ways don't tell the for my surveyor
[34:59] friends that but I'm not the best at
[35:00] math so I'm going to say my wife can
[35:02] attest to that I'm gonna I'm gonna take
[35:04] the 24 inch and say a good two foot so
[35:06] if you go two foot that means this thing
[35:08] is 40 foot wide right 120 feet long
[35:11] right and 60 feet high yes that's right
[35:14] now
[35:15] when you get up about 60 feet high you
[35:18] can see a long ways
[35:19] and a lot of the things that happened
[35:23] on this night April the second I'll say
[35:26] it easier April the 2nd 1833 a lot of
[35:28] the things that happened were within a
[35:31] relatively short distance that's right
[35:33] of each other really yeah and and so
[35:36] we've got we've got a pretty good
[35:37] Vantage Point sitting up on the sitting
[35:39] up on top of the Tabernacle and and
[35:41] we're we can you know you can Orient
[35:43] yourself that way you can look and he
[35:44] said okay there's the East right over
[35:46] here is the East right and then there's
[35:48] the West there's the north there's the
[35:50] South
[35:52] and we can look at these things and we
[35:54] can just start saying oh my look at this
[35:56] look at that
[35:59] and a lot of things have have happened
[36:01] here
[36:02] a lot of things have happened God has
[36:04] you know to be able to come to this time
[36:08] history even in time time and time to be
[36:11] able to get here there's a lot of things
[36:13] that God did to bring us to this point I
[36:16] mean you can you can go all the way back
[36:18] and the things that God had to put in
[36:20] place and orchestrate and make happen
[36:22] even you go back to Rahab the Harlot and
[36:24] you go and your boys and all the
[36:26] different things that would go through
[36:27] it and Ruth and Naomi and all the things
[36:29] that had to be orchestrated to bring it
[36:31] to this point when the son of David
[36:33] could be could come and and be here at
[36:36] this precise moment in time yeah right
[36:39] come on I mean we don't know the half of
[36:41] it we don't know the 90 we don't know
[36:43] 99.9 percent of all the things that God
[36:45] did to bring us even to this point right
[36:48] here amen
[36:51] but there was a lot that has led up to
[36:52] this time in fact everything has led up
[36:54] to this time all the way from the
[36:56] beginning when there was a lamb of God
[36:57] slain before the foundation of the world
[37:01] God had this in his mind before the
[37:03] foundation of the world
[37:05] right and we realized that in the
[37:07] beginning even oh let's go even but
[37:08] beyond that even at the beginning when
[37:10] God made heavens and earth yes
[37:14] and and as is true with his whole
[37:16] creation they were created to show and
[37:19] express the glory of God Amen I'm out
[37:22] right yes
[37:24] in fact the Old Testament Believers such
[37:26] as job and Enoch
[37:29] many of the others many many of the
[37:31] others they all look to the stars and
[37:32] creation as ways to
[37:34] understand God that's right yeah you
[37:37] know science used to do that the Natural
[37:38] Sciences they used to do that that's
[37:40] right up until about the 1700s science
[37:42] was used as a way to prove the things of
[37:45] God right and about the seven earliest
[37:48] middle 1700s forgive me I forget the
[37:50] year and the name of the the different
[37:51] ones that were coming forth and they
[37:52] began to you know atheists begin to come
[37:55] up and satanists began to come up and
[37:57] begin to use science and twists in ways
[37:59] to try to disprove the word of God and
[38:02] that brought us all the way to we where
[38:04] we are right now right amen amen 200 300
[38:08] years now down the road and look what
[38:09] we've got out there now men can be women
[38:11] and women could be men and my all the
[38:14] different just the junk that's out there
[38:16] now right amen
[38:18] amen but they would look to the Stars
[38:21] let's focus on the stars for a moment
[38:22] they would look to the Stars
[38:25] to to understand
[38:28] god dude for the word because we realize
[38:31] the word you know the god wrote his
[38:33] first Bible in the Stars right brother
[38:35] Branham says this in in the message show
[38:38] us the father and it'll satisfy us
[38:42] he said then the first thing you know I
[38:44] hear him say let there be light
[38:46] and when he did
[38:48] Adam broke Yonder hey
[38:50] now now that's something that's very
[38:52] significant yeah pick a little funny you
[38:56] know as it were one time in a and there
[38:58] was a there was a man there was a
[38:59] scientist an atheist or I don't know if
[39:00] he's an atheist because he was talking
[39:02] to God but he's talking God said yo we
[39:03] you're irrelevant now we don't need you
[39:05] anymore come on we can do everything you
[39:08] can do we can even create our own man
[39:10] now come on he said oh you can he said
[39:13] yeah we can create our own man he said
[39:15] okay you go first right right
[39:17] and the scientist reaches down to get
[39:19] something he said oh yeah that's right
[39:21] that's my dirt you got to get your own
[39:25] you got to get your own right when you
[39:27] can bring an atom out of nothing
[39:30] when you can can you can do you can
[39:33] bring bring all that we see out here now
[39:35] out of nothing
[39:37] if you can even get to a place where you
[39:39] could explain that they can explain
[39:40] listen they can explain science can
[39:43] explain it all the way back to the Big
[39:45] Bang they can go all the way back and
[39:47] explain how everything got here by their
[39:49] powers of observation they've been able
[39:50] to do that you know what I believe they
[39:52] got a lot of it right but when they get
[39:54] there they say what happened what was
[39:56] before that well you know I think it
[39:58] just probably always was we don't know
[39:59] we can't see back that far
[40:01] that's right yeah come on Mercy
[40:06] so brother Brandon says again and then
[40:08] the first thing you know I hear him say
[40:09] let there be light heaven
[40:10] and when he did in Adam broke Yonder and
[40:12] the son came into existence and I
[40:14] watched that sun burn for millions of
[40:16] years
[40:18] I think he just sat there and watched
[40:20] that thing
[40:21] ball of light out there those eagle eyes
[40:24] yes I watched that certain that
[40:27] sunburned for millions of years and the
[40:29] first thing you know brother Brandon
[40:31] illustrates there and he said and there
[40:34] there goes a clinker there went a
[40:36] clinker and and he stood and watched it
[40:39] in it and it flew yeah and it fell for a
[40:43] million years
[40:44] and he stopped it yeah right yes and
[40:48] then another one flew
[40:51] and he stopped it yes
[40:53] what he said what he said he was putting
[40:57] the solar system he was running his
[41:00] first Bible that's right and the first
[41:03] Bible that was written in the skies man
[41:06] looked up
[41:08] knowing that God was above that's right
[41:11] they couldn't deny it when they looked
[41:13] up into the stars and in the heavens
[41:15] they saw the majesty and not just the
[41:17] beauty but they saw a they saw an
[41:19] organization up there you know we look
[41:21] up sometimes and if you don't know what
[41:22] you're looking at it's just a bunch of
[41:23] blinking lights up there right
[41:25] you know is that a star or is that a
[41:28] planet is that a star is that or is that
[41:30] one of Elon musk's satellites going
[41:32] across the way over there I don't know
[41:35] but you know for the men of old they
[41:36] looked and and they understood these
[41:38] things right they understood the the the
[41:40] Rhythm and the patterns and they
[41:42] understood the organization of it and
[41:44] they said that didn't just happen that's
[41:46] right
[41:47] amen praise the Lord yeah yeah somebody
[41:49] had to do that
[41:52] my goodness you look at the trees and
[41:54] everything else there and you know even
[41:55] the way A Tree Grows you can they talk
[41:58] they call it the thumbprint of God you
[42:00] can pick up a pine comb and look at a
[42:02] pine cone and there's a swirl in the
[42:04] bottom of where all the things come
[42:05] together right and that that that's I
[42:08] can never pronounce it what it's called
[42:10] it's a it's a
[42:12] come on
[42:13] I can't pronounce the word I'm not even
[42:15] going to try it but it's a certain it's
[42:16] there and you can take that same that
[42:18] same swirl and if you could raise up
[42:20] above the Earth like in the
[42:22] International Space Station you look
[42:23] down on a look down on a a hurricane
[42:25] forming a whole weather pattern it's
[42:28] that same swirl and if you look at a
[42:30] tree you go look at a tree and you might
[42:32] not even see the tree the swirl of the
[42:34] tree you just look up and you see limbs
[42:35] those limbs are spaced and twisted at
[42:40] that same swirl all the way up it's
[42:42] called the Golden Ratio right and it
[42:45] works on the same pattern all the way
[42:48] through you can flush your toilet yeah
[42:52] and that water will swirl
[42:55] in a certain it is you know again the
[42:57] shape has a little bit to do with it but
[42:59] that same swirl is a Whirlpool makes it
[43:02] it's that same pattern they call it the
[43:04] thumbprint of God that don't just happen
[43:06] they say oh that just happens that's
[43:08] gravity and that's this and that's
[43:09] everything else well then you can take
[43:11] it out into the Galaxy and the galaxies
[43:13] swirl around each other in that same
[43:17] swirl amen it's too organized right it's
[43:22] two there's something in control
[43:24] right there's something in control and
[43:27] I'm so glad I know the creator of
[43:29] everything that there is amen hallelujah
[43:33] praise the Lord let there be light and
[43:35] then there's light
[43:38] oh my
[43:40] man looked up at all this and he knew
[43:42] that God was above
[43:45] man looked up and it's the word of God
[43:47] written in the stars and he knew that
[43:50] God was there God was speaking from
[43:52] those Stars
[43:54] you know we have a word of God in this
[43:56] day too right amen and we can look to
[43:58] this Bible we can look to this Bible and
[44:01] we can say that God is in his word amen
[44:04] God is in his word there's something
[44:06] moving in that word as many times I
[44:08] can't see it but I know it's there I can
[44:10] feel it's there there's something behind
[44:12] the curtain and I know that there's
[44:13] something there and then there's times
[44:14] when he pulls the curtain back and I say
[44:16] oh praise God I see it right amen yes
[44:19] God in his word
[44:22] but even more than that for the
[44:24] born-again believer we can look to the
[44:25] Living Word living in us and say that
[44:28] God is right here
[44:30] God is right here right yeah
[44:34] he is not just God above us although he
[44:36] is he's omnipresent amen by his
[44:38] omniscience he's omnipresent and he's
[44:41] not just God With Us which we most
[44:43] assurely know that God's with us oh how
[44:45] comforting that is to know that God's
[44:46] with me right amen but it's not just
[44:48] that but it's God in us tonight
[44:52] that's another thing for Good Friday is
[44:54] God in us tonight the word of God born
[44:56] down in our souls and living through us
[44:58] tonight Flesh and Blood Jesus Christ
[45:01] walk in the earth once more amen
[45:04] hallelujah that body that lays on the on
[45:08] the throne of sacrifice that that body
[45:10] that lays on the alternate he can't he
[45:11] can't put his feet on this Earth amen
[45:13] but I tell you what he can inhabit a
[45:15] body a broad body down here and he can
[45:18] walk upon the face of this Earth amen
[45:20] and he does
[45:22] he does that's right he walks into
[45:24] church yeah hey
[45:27] he walks into houses
[45:28] he walks into Walmart yeah
[45:33] I used to preach a lot about the Walmart
[45:34] cashiers
[45:36] and that devil even took that away from
[45:38] me
[45:41] and he even took that away from him
[45:46] brother Branham goes on to say
[45:48] if the Walmart cashier was my catch-all
[45:50] for everything when I was when I started
[45:51] preaching that was that was my source of
[45:54] aggravation that was my source I'd be
[45:56] happy and even in spite of the Walmart
[45:58] cashier amen do all these different
[46:00] things like that and then he takes that
[46:01] away
[46:02] Brooke Brown goes on to say this talking
[46:04] about the Stars
[46:06] he goes on to say now look at the zodiac
[46:09] starts off with the Virgin ends up with
[46:11] Leo the Lion
[46:13] the first coming and second coming of
[46:15] Christ everything in the heavens declare
[46:17] him everything in the earth declares him
[46:19] everything around declares him his
[46:22] people declares him his power declares
[46:24] himself amen his son declared him right
[46:27] amen everything declares Our God Amen
[46:31] you just have eyes to see with right why
[46:35] is it good Friday my goodness is a
[46:37] clearing God like never before amen amen
[46:39] there has to be a death before there can
[46:41] be a resurrection praise the Lord Jesus
[46:43] if there had been no cross there would
[46:44] be no Resurrection if there had been no
[46:46] Resurrection I tell you what I would be
[46:48] among all men most miserable but God
[46:50] knew how to make me happy
[46:53] praise the Lord and God being God
[46:57] and knowing all these things he knows
[46:59] exactly
[47:00] where every Star is at at any moment any
[47:03] split moment of time he knows exactly
[47:05] where those stars are he knew exactly
[47:07] where those Stars would be sitting on
[47:09] the second day of Nissan
[47:11] ad33
[47:14] when he when he first slung those slung
[47:17] those Clunkers out of that great light
[47:20] in the beginning of time
[47:23] he knew where those Stars would be
[47:25] when Jesus was walking to the Garden of
[47:27] Gethsemane amen yeah
[47:31] astrologers talk about the the big bang
[47:33] and they can use their math and their
[47:35] understanding
[47:36] and deduce
[47:38] that the universe is expanding and
[47:40] twisting and it's expanding and moving
[47:43] outward yes sir so it's it's in a spiral
[47:47] right they can observe this they can see
[47:50] this and they measure this I mean you
[47:51] know Einstein used to when we talk about
[47:53] Einstein the smartest man they ever
[47:54] lived is not exactly but he was real
[47:56] close Solomon was very smart right yeah
[48:00] but Einstein in his in his General the
[48:03] first the general relativity I can't
[48:05] pronounce all the names and everything
[48:06] else forgive me I'm just Plum dumb but
[48:08] when he goes out when he first puts out
[48:10] there he looked at the universe and he
[48:12] said that it was he said it was just a
[48:14] constant it's just constant yep and and
[48:17] it just that's how everything was and
[48:18] there's a movement there but it was a
[48:20] constant there but but there was another
[48:22] man by the name of Hubble you might have
[48:24] heard the Hubble satellite well Hubble
[48:25] was actually a an astrologer back in the
[48:28] 30s I believe it was and Hubble what
[48:30] Hubble found through his observation and
[48:32] looking through a telescope Einstein
[48:34] didn't have Hubble's telescope so as he
[48:36] looks through there Hubble was able to
[48:38] to to see that these stars and
[48:40] everything was moving away from him
[48:41] right at a certain rate
[48:44] and that they were expanding they were
[48:46] going out they were getting wider away
[48:47] from each other he was able to observe
[48:49] this in the 30s and he and he put this
[48:52] thing down Einstein when he tried to
[48:54] make his his theory of relativity I
[48:56] believe it was when he tried to make all
[48:58] that work he actually there was one
[49:00] number that would never work right so he
[49:01] fudged it yep
[49:03] Einstein fudged it he came up with a
[49:06] number that made his calculations work
[49:09] yep
[49:12] Einstein does I did that in school a
[49:14] couple times it didn't work so good for
[49:15] me
[49:16] come on man but Einstein did that and
[49:20] then he ran into Hubble
[49:21] and he said I got to see this for myself
[49:23] so he travels I believe in Hawaii if I'm
[49:25] not mistaken he travels all the way to
[49:27] Hawaii and he goes down to Hubble's
[49:29] telescope he looks up there and he says
[49:31] you know what he's an honest enough man
[49:32] he says you're right
[49:34] yeah I got to redo something yeah I got
[49:37] to redo something because the universe
[49:39] is not stagnant our God is Not stagnant
[49:42] right amen and he says so he goes and he
[49:46] puts it out there and he says he looks
[49:47] and he sees these numbers he reworks his
[49:49] numbers and they all work amen and they
[49:51] say the universe now they say it's
[49:52] expanding at a certain rate in a certain
[49:55] you know Direction a certain speed I
[49:56] think it's 163
[49:58] 000 miles an hour that it's moving away
[50:00] from us it's expanding I should say
[50:02] right 163
[50:04] 000 miles an hour booth just like this
[50:06] and they and they can measure that right
[50:08] and they said well well if we can
[50:10] measure it that way we can reverse our
[50:12] calculations and we can go back this way
[50:15] and we can find where it all converges
[50:18] at and when it all comes in converts
[50:20] we'll know that's the beginning yeah
[50:22] yeah and they've actually been able to I
[50:24] don't know the time but they've actually
[50:25] been able to age it and time it and say
[50:27] this is the beginning and they call that
[50:29] the singularity yeah wow right right and
[50:33] it's when everything all all the matter
[50:35] of the universe
[50:37] come on we're not even a speck of dust
[50:40] man we're like a we're a speck of a
[50:42] speck of a speck of a shadow I don't
[50:44] even know how to even begin to describe
[50:45] what we are on Earth
[50:47] but oh it's a matter of the whole
[50:49] universe
[50:52] yeah
[50:54] comes back down
[50:56] into a pinhead come on a smaller
[51:01] and the the mass
[51:03] of all the the all the creation the mass
[51:06] of that
[51:07] is in the space of a pinhead come on and
[51:11] they call it Infinity that's right
[51:14] because the way the mass is in in
[51:17] fantastic it's almost an infinitesimal
[51:19] that's the wrong side it's it's Infinity
[51:21] you can't you can't measure it right
[51:25] that's right thank you Lord
[51:28] yeah hey we're out beginning with him
[51:29] and God said boom
[51:32] and it all goes yeah and you say what in
[51:35] the world does this have to do with Good
[51:36] Friday hold on
[51:38] I'm getting there you're good you're
[51:40] getting it
[51:41] brother Wade gets up I'll know I I miss
[51:44] my getting there come on so so you you
[51:46] look and and all these things they come
[51:48] back down and they can tell us exactly
[51:49] where all these things are but no oh no
[51:51] and he said well what's on the other
[51:52] side of that as I said what's on the
[51:53] other side of that and and some will say
[51:55] God well then they're just ridiculed and
[51:57] pushed out you can't say God
[51:59] come on I've always I've heard others
[52:01] say aliens it's funny it is the most
[52:03] hilarious thing to me that they will go
[52:05] so far as they say aliens but not God
[52:09] all right then tell me what created
[52:11] aliens come on now right on they say
[52:14] we're living in a computer program well
[52:17] then tell me who created the computer
[52:18] program somehow another at some point
[52:21] another you got to get down and say
[52:22] there's an infinite God there is an
[52:24] eternal God there is a creator of all
[52:26] things and he cannot be denied amen yes
[52:30] sir praise the Lord they can tell you
[52:33] where that ball of infinite Mass where
[52:35] it all comes to but they cannot tell you
[52:36] what was before it amen right right but
[52:39] God said let there be let there be yes
[52:43] sir and time matter and space all came
[52:47] into existence at the same time the
[52:49] Bible says in the beginning there's time
[52:51] God created Heavens there's space and
[52:54] the Earth and there's matter and it all
[52:57] came into place it all came up there and
[52:58] God began to cry aren't you so thankful
[53:01] that you know the creator of God they
[53:04] could put all these things in order yeah
[53:06] I'm going a long ways to get there but
[53:07] all these things in order and bring it
[53:10] to a place to where we say God you are
[53:12] in control in the darkest days of my
[53:14] life you are in control when Jesus died
[53:17] upon the cross you were in control
[53:20] Hallelujah you never lost control not
[53:23] one moment right amen
[53:25] amen and when he was writing that first
[53:28] Bible across the skies he was in control
[53:31] amen and when he stretched out his arm
[53:34] to stop one there and one there and one
[53:36] there and one there amen he was in
[53:39] control he was writing his Bible in the
[53:43] Stars amen
[53:44] yeah praise the Lord he's writing his
[53:48] eternal word in the Stars rotting out
[53:50] this great word that's right amen and
[53:52] foretelling exactly what was going to
[53:53] happen
[53:55] and what was it all for right
[53:58] come on come on now I've heard others it
[54:00] would come other scientists in different
[54:02] wines and they say well they are they
[54:04] call them uh intelligent design that's
[54:06] right and under intelligent design they
[54:09] would say by just reason their sheer
[54:11] reasoning Powers they say somebody had
[54:13] to do this that's right the Lord but a
[54:16] lot of them will not say that Jesus
[54:18] Christ created everything right they
[54:20] will not speak the name of Jesus that's
[54:22] right they will not do that right they
[54:23] will not do that
[54:25] but but here but God looking ahead in
[54:27] time
[54:28] when the only begotten Son of God Amen
[54:31] the beginning of the creation of God
[54:33] Amen the vessel that God would create in
[54:37] a virgin womb and would step down into
[54:39] this natural creation for the greatest
[54:41] battle that was ever fought that God
[54:44] that God right there he knew exactly
[54:46] what he was doing come on now as
[54:50] spiritual scientists we can look back
[54:52] now tonight we can look at all these
[54:53] things and say God is amen God is amen
[54:57] you can you can yeah I found all sorts
[55:00] of people saying oh I believe in God
[55:03] right sure I can find you all kinds of
[55:06] denominations and everything else it's
[55:07] not even the dominations now yeah come
[55:09] on now it's all the ones that got Angels
[55:11] sitting on the Shelf at home but they
[55:13] you know some of the you listen to what
[55:14] they say it's like oh my goodness
[55:15] gracious
[55:17] it's an angel I believe in God
[55:20] [Music]
[55:21] I saw a Methodist it was either Luther
[55:24] or Methodist preacher the other day
[55:27] they were on there and they were talking
[55:28] about
[55:31] they were talking about transgender
[55:33] things yeah
[55:35] she was it was he was it was whatever
[55:38] was dressed as a woman
[55:40] come on the thought that God was a woman
[55:42] great brother I thought God was a woman
[55:45] yeah
[55:46] yeah and I thought how in the world can
[55:48] you do that I said well I know how you
[55:49] do that you you remove yourself from the
[55:51] Bible you you can look up and by your
[55:53] reasoning you can see this and just by
[55:56] the hunger of the heart brother Brown
[55:57] said Man was created to worship and man
[55:59] will worship something right it used to
[56:02] be that you know somebody didn't go to
[56:03] church the old man didn't go to church
[56:04] or whatever he'd sat there and polish
[56:06] his cars wouldn't he oh man and he'd
[56:08] worship that car I got a 65 Mustang
[56:10] buddy this thing is sharp I got a 70
[56:13] Chevelle yeah come on I got an old ugly
[56:16] boxy 78 Scout International that's
[56:18] sitting in about a thousand different
[56:20] pieces
[56:21] and they could sit there and oh I don't
[56:22] got time to go to church Sunday's my day
[56:24] of rest and they went out there and
[56:25] they'll turn wrenches and they'll sweat
[56:26] and they'll do it they're going to
[56:27] worship something amen all right brother
[56:29] hey man come on
[56:30] Joe just for the past few years though
[56:32] the the atheists started getting
[56:34] together and having Church
[56:36] foreign
[56:37] they actually did they do yeah and now
[56:40] they've applied for a religious
[56:41] religious whatever in school so that
[56:44] they have equal opportunities and they
[56:46] have their you're going to have a
[56:47] Christian this or whatever but they've
[56:48] got their satanists this and that and
[56:50] they say the kids are joining in droves
[56:52] oh I'm sure
[56:54] there right sure they are
[57:01] yeah man look at all these things that
[57:02] take place here
[57:04] man can look up brother Brown said man
[57:06] we'll look up and see that God was up
[57:09] there amen
[57:11] and the child of God will always be able
[57:13] to look yes and see yeah what God's
[57:16] doing because he's got eyes to see with
[57:18] right right and he can put a name to it
[57:21] and God as you know or us as spiritual
[57:25] Christian Scientists so to speak we can
[57:27] look back and we can see there and God
[57:30] has allowed us the means to put a name
[57:33] to to God right and we can look back and
[57:36] see all the things that happen and say
[57:37] that's God yeah right and his name is
[57:39] Jesus Amen brother and his name is Jesus
[57:42] so here we are standing atop his Temple
[57:44] I've gone a long ways around there went
[57:46] further than I wanted to go but here we
[57:48] are standing on top of the temple on the
[57:50] on April the second
[57:52] AED 33 I keep want to say 1933 just
[57:55] don't work that way amen and we're up
[57:57] here in all Jerusalem is laid out around
[57:59] us all Jerusalem is laid out around us
[58:01] here and and a little we'll we'll just
[58:04] try to orient
[58:06] Orient ourselves here I'm I'm out I
[58:08] don't have the surveyor's magnet in my
[58:10] brain I can't tell you which I've had my
[58:12] phone I'd pull it up
[58:13] the compass up which way is east east
[58:15] come on there's East right all right so
[58:18] if that's East that's North I was fixing
[58:20] to say North but it's just for the point
[58:21] of the door not because I knew anything
[58:23] foreign
[58:24] West South
[58:27] and I'm sitting about 60 feet off the
[58:29] top of the ground maybe a little bit
[58:30] higher depending on what the outside was
[58:32] I don't know
[58:33] I'm sitting up here and and a little bit
[58:36] so so there's there's East North West
[58:39] South so so over here
[58:43] to the Southwest
[58:44] come on a little under a half a mile
[58:47] they say it's about 800 meters when I
[58:49] looked it up which is 0.49 something
[58:51] something or another so a little under a
[58:53] half a mile
[58:55] to the Southwest
[58:58] of the temple where I'm sitting or where
[59:01] we're sitting right there's a group of
[59:04] men
[59:06] a group of 12.
[59:09] coming out of a upper room wow come on
[59:12] yeah
[59:14] coming out of a little place where
[59:15] they're going to have supper
[59:19] where they'd washed each other's feet
[59:21] yes now if we'd been if I hadn't took so
[59:23] long in my talking and all the stuff
[59:25] around there we might have seen a man
[59:27] walk out a little bit earlier yes
[59:30] leaving in a hurry maybe he had a hood
[59:34] over his body of his robe pulled up over
[59:36] his head and you can see he's kind of
[59:38] darting back and forth looking around
[59:39] he's trying to obscure his obscure his
[59:41] identity maybe his his little darting
[59:43] eyes but he had a purpose burning in
[59:46] those eyes and he had a direction that
[59:48] he was going and he's walking briskly on
[59:52] purpose with purpose yeah and he's going
[59:55] to meet the chief priest right
[59:58] right to betray our Lord wow
[1:00:02] he doesn't have far to go and the deed
[1:00:04] doesn't take long that's right that's
[1:00:05] right
[1:00:07] that was earlier
[1:00:10] this is now
[1:00:12] and it's evening time
[1:00:17] and the Lord and the 11 remaining
[1:00:19] disciples are leaving the house
[1:00:22] heading off in a winding
[1:00:25] and generally Northwestern
[1:00:29] or Northeastern
[1:00:32] I think it's Northeastern actually
[1:00:35] northeasterly Direction
[1:00:40] going past the Great temple again so the
[1:00:43] temples here they're less than a half
[1:00:44] mile over there having to go through the
[1:00:46] streets of different things so they're
[1:00:47] winding their way in a generally
[1:00:49] Northeastern Direction they go past the
[1:00:51] temple where just a few days before
[1:00:53] Jesus had planted a planted his Whip and
[1:00:56] and ran the money changers out because
[1:00:58] they didn't have a have the right Heart
[1:00:59] Right amen they were they were trying to
[1:01:01] find an easy gospel you know that's what
[1:01:03] people do they try to find easy gospel I
[1:01:05] don't want the easy gospel
[1:01:07] I can say that because the Lord does not
[1:01:09] give me an easy gospel amen things are
[1:01:12] not easy things are hard people get sick
[1:01:15] I get sick we have family issues we have
[1:01:18] things that just turn us on our heads
[1:01:19] our hearts are rich from our bodies we
[1:01:21] don't have an easy gospel
[1:01:24] that's right amen
[1:01:26] my phone's sitting in there right now
[1:01:28] right before I came out I couldn't
[1:01:29] answer the text sitting there on my
[1:01:30] phone from a from a young man that said
[1:01:32] you told me if I prayed
[1:01:35] and I didn't even answer I didn't even
[1:01:36] open it all the way up because I didn't
[1:01:38] I don't want it to show red right yeah
[1:01:40] I'm fixing to go to the pulpit
[1:01:43] you told me if I prayed
[1:01:48] let me tell you what my experience with
[1:01:50] praying is a lot of times I pray and it
[1:01:51] gets worse
[1:01:53] I pray and it seemed like the exact
[1:01:56] opposite of what I prayed happens right
[1:01:58] that's right I knew you could relate to
[1:02:00] that because we're all in this we're not
[1:02:02] in in for an easy gospel that's right
[1:02:05] but we're in for the true gospel
[1:02:08] and it is good news that's right because
[1:02:10] he wins in the end he wins right amen so
[1:02:15] they're going by the temple where
[1:02:16] they're where you know again just a few
[1:02:18] days before he'd ran the money changers
[1:02:19] out you think about that the money
[1:02:21] changers in one way it looked like a
[1:02:23] good service I mean not everybody could
[1:02:25] had access perhaps they didn't have room
[1:02:27] to have their own sheep or their own
[1:02:29] turtle doves or whatever they didn't
[1:02:30] have the access to these things and and
[1:02:32] they couldn't exactly and maybe they
[1:02:33] were in a hurry they worked six days
[1:02:35] last week and the boss was really hard
[1:02:38] on them and and so you know I I don't
[1:02:40] have time to I'll just go buy one I'll
[1:02:43] get one they've got one there in the
[1:02:44] temple I can go and and there's a nice
[1:02:46] man there that raises the best the best
[1:02:50] sheep you ever saw brother Wade I mean
[1:02:52] they're the best sheep right
[1:02:55] I mean he makes sure that there's no
[1:02:57] spots on him he won't bring a bad one he
[1:03:00] only brings his best
[1:03:02] and I'll just go buy one from there
[1:03:05] come on
[1:03:06] sounds like a pretty good service to do
[1:03:08] right I'm you're helping the church out
[1:03:11] wow no
[1:03:12] bring it
[1:03:14] God wants sacrifice that's right
[1:03:18] and you God will sacrifice
[1:03:21] he wants us to sweat on our brow
[1:03:24] amen I mean when you think of the links
[1:03:26] that he went to for you right brother I
[1:03:29] should be able to do the same for him I
[1:03:32] could never do the same for him but I
[1:03:33] should give my all right amen I should
[1:03:35] give my all
[1:03:37] right so here they are and they're
[1:03:38] walking past this the Grace Temple
[1:03:40] because again this southwesterly is the
[1:03:42] it is
[1:03:43] is the place where they were having the
[1:03:45] last summer Last Summer the last supper
[1:03:48] and then the and then you come up and
[1:03:50] I'm thinking I'm hot that's what it is
[1:03:51] see and then and then there and then
[1:03:52] they go up and they've got to go they're
[1:03:54] going this way and Jesus is leading them
[1:03:55] down a northeasterly direction and he's
[1:03:57] carrying them to the Garden right yep
[1:04:01] he's carrying him to the guard now
[1:04:02] they've got just a little bit over a
[1:04:03] mile they said it's something probably
[1:04:05] somewhere around a mile and a and a
[1:04:07] quarter
[1:04:08] 1.25 miles that they probably had to
[1:04:10] walk because it wasn't really that long
[1:04:12] straight distance but they had to go
[1:04:13] through the streets and the wind and
[1:04:14] everything else to get there they had to
[1:04:16] go through Gates they had to go through
[1:04:18] it's because it's outside the city
[1:04:20] proper so they had to go through the
[1:04:21] gates and all these things and it's
[1:04:23] evening time and they're making their
[1:04:24] way out here uh-huh
[1:04:29] here I am just sitting here just
[1:04:30] watching it
[1:04:34] and I said there's my Lord
[1:04:37] there's my Lord
[1:04:40] just a few days before
[1:04:43] he's entering on the
[1:04:45] back of the cult the fall of an ass
[1:04:49] right sir they're waving their their
[1:04:51] Palm their palm branches
[1:04:53] which is a sign of victory that was the
[1:04:55] Victorious King coming right back they
[1:04:58] knew they knew who that was right
[1:04:59] because because Isaiah had said and
[1:05:02] Ezekiel would say and Zechariah had said
[1:05:04] and
[1:05:05] low he's coming your king is coming
[1:05:07] right amen lowly humble
[1:05:10] right riding on an ass the cult the fold
[1:05:14] an ass yeah
[1:05:16] they knew that
[1:05:18] and they received they received him
[1:05:20] triumphantly
[1:05:21] right and they they call that hosanna
[1:05:24] would they say hosanna to the king yeah
[1:05:26] I hit this I hit this Sunday Hosanna the
[1:05:29] word Hosanna we think of you know
[1:05:31] Hosanna Blessed Be The Rock Blessed Be
[1:05:35] The Rock right and it's worshiping and
[1:05:37] jumping and shouting everything else and
[1:05:38] it's true it is true but when you go
[1:05:40] back and you look at that word Hosanna
[1:05:42] it's not just that it actually means
[1:05:44] pleading it's a it's a compound Greek
[1:05:47] word come on
[1:05:48] and the Greek word is hosanna it's one
[1:05:50] of those words like hallelujah it's the
[1:05:52] same in all the all the languages but
[1:05:54] it's a two-part and one part is pleading
[1:05:56] yeah yeah and the other part has to do
[1:05:58] with deliverance and salvation and and
[1:06:01] Liberty amen yeah so literally what
[1:06:04] they're doing they're pleading with the
[1:06:05] Lord as he comes in they're waving you
[1:06:07] are the king you are the Victor you are
[1:06:10] the one and we're bound and we're we're
[1:06:13] in subjugation and we're all these
[1:06:15] things and we're hurting and we need to
[1:06:17] deliver and we need a king and we need
[1:06:19] this and we need that and that's what
[1:06:21] they were doing when he was coming to
[1:06:22] the city they were looking to God and
[1:06:24] you've got to look to Jesus
[1:06:28] they're looking to Jesus for what they
[1:06:30] need
[1:06:31] problem today is people don't know what
[1:06:32] they need that's right
[1:06:34] brother man let me get my phone out I'll
[1:06:35] look on Amazon
[1:06:37] ah
[1:06:39] they knew they needed Jesus yes or they
[1:06:42] they knew they needed
[1:06:44] that image
[1:06:46] that they had in their mind anyways
[1:06:47] which is another problem that people
[1:06:48] have they get an image of Jesus
[1:06:51] whether it's the cool Jesus
[1:06:53] the Church of Jesus the unchurched Jesus
[1:06:57] right
[1:06:59] they know they need a God
[1:07:01] what they need is the god of the Bible
[1:07:03] amen all right amen
[1:07:05] all right brother
[1:07:08] I could look down though I look down and
[1:07:09] I see it I said there's there's my Lord
[1:07:11] that's the one I need yeah right now
[1:07:14] that's the one I gotta have
[1:07:18] so as he's as this group of 12 they make
[1:07:20] their way through they're going through
[1:07:21] the through the city and then out the
[1:07:23] gates and eventually they make it the
[1:07:24] way to the to the Garden which is about
[1:07:26] a half a mile or maybe a little bit over
[1:07:28] from from the temple where we sit yeah
[1:07:30] so again you got almost half a mile
[1:07:31] there and a little over half a mile here
[1:07:33] you got just a little over a mile and
[1:07:34] they make it there to the to the Garden
[1:07:36] of Gethsemane The Garden of Gethsemane
[1:07:39] of course is a place of solitude yeah
[1:07:41] yeah yes sir this is a place where the
[1:07:43] Lord would would resort to at times to
[1:07:45] get a loan to go to pray and to and to
[1:07:48] refresh himself right right he'd go to
[1:07:51] get away from the things of this natural
[1:07:52] world that are so good at drowning out
[1:07:55] that still Small Voice and let me tell
[1:07:57] you something hearing that still Small
[1:07:58] Voice is so vitally important yes sir
[1:08:03] Jesus would go there to commune with his
[1:08:05] father and he had to keep this channel
[1:08:07] of communication open because remember
[1:08:10] he said I can do nothing but what my
[1:08:12] father shows me he had to keep a a
[1:08:15] Channel of communication open between
[1:08:17] him and and his father right come on the
[1:08:20] spirit yes
[1:08:21] well it's the same for you and me we
[1:08:23] have to keep that channel of inspiration
[1:08:25] that channel open where that still Small
[1:08:28] Voice can can get there and to do that
[1:08:30] we've got to be able to shut out the
[1:08:32] things of the world is so hard
[1:08:36] well the Wade said we're having dinner
[1:08:38] we'll meet at Cracker Barrel about 4 30.
[1:08:42] you told me that last night or this
[1:08:43] morning
[1:08:45] did you tell me that last night or this
[1:08:46] morning
[1:08:47] this morning
[1:08:48] yeah I worked till 10 30 last night I
[1:08:51] was I had said I told I I text the main
[1:08:54] office I said I'm done at 10 30 I said
[1:08:56] I'm done I'm out I'm gone
[1:08:59] and then the phone rang right that's
[1:09:02] right and at 10 30 last night I threw up
[1:09:03] my hands and said I quit
[1:09:05] right come on so so you know everything
[1:09:08] and that's the way it works and Satan
[1:09:11] knows that he knows that if he can get
[1:09:13] that if he can stop that communication
[1:09:15] if he can kind of make it hard to hear
[1:09:17] that still small voice
[1:09:20] Jesus said I can do nothing but what my
[1:09:22] father shows me
[1:09:24] and listen we're the sons of God and the
[1:09:27] sons of God are LED of the spirit of God
[1:09:29] and you've got to be where you can hear
[1:09:31] the spirit of God it's very important we
[1:09:34] must keep this Supernatural Lifeline
[1:09:36] open we must be led of the Lord amen
[1:09:39] amen so now as we
[1:09:41] look to the east
[1:09:44] for my perch on top of the Temple
[1:09:48] we see we see Jesus and the leaven
[1:09:50] entering into the garden
[1:09:54] and and we may be using our eagle eyes
[1:09:56] for real now here a little bit here
[1:09:58] because they're there at the time there
[1:09:59] were walls and things that were kind of
[1:10:01] in the way but but with our with the air
[1:10:03] the supernatural eyes of our heart we
[1:10:06] can see through those things right and
[1:10:08] and let's just let's just imagine or
[1:10:10] just think that we see Jesus as he's
[1:10:12] entering into the Garden or getting
[1:10:13] closer to the garden and he just seems
[1:10:15] to be carrying a heavier load
[1:10:19] than usual come on
[1:10:21] perhaps his feet are slowing
[1:10:25] the closer he gets
[1:10:27] his shoulders
[1:10:30] those precious shoulders are kind of
[1:10:32] hunching over they're beginning to slump
[1:10:34] yep
[1:10:37] his back is beginning to bend as if
[1:10:39] under a heavy lobe
[1:10:43] and it is a heaviness man
[1:10:46] burdens are not lighting you just carry
[1:10:48] your burden could you imagine carrying
[1:10:49] everybody's Burger come on
[1:10:52] you just carry your brother and your
[1:10:54] your burden's in the maybe the onesie
[1:10:56] too your little group that you pray for
[1:10:59] and then your pastor has your pastors
[1:11:01] have have their burdens that they carry
[1:11:03] plus the whole church and their group
[1:11:05] that they're associated with and they've
[1:11:07] got those burdens and they're heavy
[1:11:10] you'll know how heavy those burdens are
[1:11:15] baby you think oh when you're fighting
[1:11:16] the worst battles you've ever fought and
[1:11:18] then the phone rings and somebody else
[1:11:19] and they're oblivious
[1:11:21] to the battles that you're fighting
[1:11:24] oblivious
[1:11:26] and he doesn't say a thing
[1:11:28] because he don't want to add to your
[1:11:30] problems right I know your problems are
[1:11:33] bad too we've all we're all in this
[1:11:35] battle together
[1:11:36] so you just kind of shoulder up and take
[1:11:39] another burden right man
[1:11:42] here's Jesus
[1:11:44] he wasn't just carrying the Lord of one
[1:11:46] man no or 12 disciples
[1:11:49] or or a hundred people or whatever he's
[1:11:52] carrying the burdens of the whole world
[1:11:55] right oh and not just the whole world is
[1:11:58] in what was presently there I forget
[1:12:00] what the population of the of the world
[1:12:02] was at that time
[1:12:04] but we're talking about all that had
[1:12:06] come since Adam
[1:12:08] that's right and all who would be from
[1:12:11] 33 all the way through 223 and whatever
[1:12:13] whatever time it will be when the when
[1:12:16] the when the Rapture takes place he's
[1:12:18] he's carrying all those or at least
[1:12:21] they're they're descending he's he's
[1:12:23] starting to feel the weight of this
[1:12:24] thing there's a reason that he was
[1:12:26] beginning to to to to kind of to to cry
[1:12:28] and to begin to try to prepare the
[1:12:30] disciples as he was getting closer
[1:12:32] because he was he knew what was coming
[1:12:35] it's expedient that I go away he knew
[1:12:38] what he was he knew what was coming he
[1:12:40] knew what kind of going away it was
[1:12:42] going to be that's right the son of man
[1:12:43] they shall do with him as they as they
[1:12:46] want to do and I'm going to be crucified
[1:12:48] and die and all these things and perhaps
[1:12:50] his disciples they didn't understand it
[1:12:52] and they were just thinking oh you know
[1:12:53] he's he's he's he's having a hard time
[1:12:55] or whatever
[1:13:00] they didn't understand
[1:13:02] but he knew
[1:13:03] he sure did he knew
[1:13:06] and it's a heaviness that descends on
[1:13:09] his heart he knows what's just ahead and
[1:13:13] perhaps with their eyes we could just
[1:13:14] kind of catch a glimpse of our precious
[1:13:16] Lord is he maybe he glanced up just a
[1:13:18] little bit
[1:13:20] his brows are drawn together and yep
[1:13:24] we think you know well there's there's
[1:13:26] the mighty king
[1:13:29] if we've gone back in time we we know we
[1:13:31] know the outcome right yeah there's a
[1:13:33] conquering King yeah yeah oh Hallelujah
[1:13:36] but remember
[1:13:39] before he conquered
[1:13:42] he had to go through the greatest battle
[1:13:44] that had ever been found
[1:13:49] Gethsemane the word Gethsemane literally
[1:13:51] means all press and this story to say
[1:13:53] this probably perhaps an oil press that
[1:13:56] was there at one time so they named it
[1:13:58] Gethsemane and everything else there may
[1:13:59] have been but I don't think that's why
[1:14:01] it was named that I think God knew
[1:14:02] exactly what he was doing when he
[1:14:04] inspired somebody to answer it or to
[1:14:06] name it that because he knew that when
[1:14:08] he was going to go to that place he was
[1:14:10] going to be pressed
[1:14:12] he's going to be pressed
[1:14:16] and and then through the pressing father
[1:14:19] if it be thy will
[1:14:21] let this cup pass from me right right
[1:14:24] we're talking about this 100 man but 100
[1:14:27] God at this time he's the fullness of
[1:14:30] the godhead bodily still within him at
[1:14:32] this time he is the fullness of the
[1:14:34] godhead bodily 100 man but the flesh
[1:14:37] still had it was still being pressed and
[1:14:40] he's still to the point knowing what was
[1:14:42] coming knowing all these things he still
[1:14:44] Cried Out Lord father if it be thy will
[1:14:48] amen saying that the flesh was kind of
[1:14:52] not real sure if it was his will or not
[1:14:54] now he knew he only wanted the will of
[1:14:57] the father
[1:14:59] right but if the pressures were so great
[1:15:01] on Jesus yeah
[1:15:03] don't let that devil tell you
[1:15:06] that just because you might have had
[1:15:07] second thoughts or doubts come on now
[1:15:11] that's right or a hesitancy about things
[1:15:14] don't let that don't let that devil tell
[1:15:16] you well see you're not a child of God a
[1:15:18] child of God wouldn't ever think that
[1:15:20] way a child of God wouldn't ever feel
[1:15:22] those things he'd be all the way going
[1:15:25] listen if Jesus could cry out father if
[1:15:28] it be thy will let this cup pass for me
[1:15:30] oh my what would this weaker vessel do
[1:15:34] praise the Lord
[1:15:38] Heaven and Hell
[1:15:39] are gathering over this spot
[1:15:42] and they're about to come together
[1:15:45] with a great Clash yes the battle's
[1:15:48] about to be engaged they're going to
[1:15:50] come together with a great crash a great
[1:15:53] cataclysm on the the Earth on the earth
[1:15:57] and in a man called Jesus and if we
[1:16:01] didn't have faith if we didn't see
[1:16:03] through our eagle eyes into the future
[1:16:06] and know that Jesus had won the victory
[1:16:08] there and Gethsemane brother Brown said
[1:16:10] he won the victory there before he ever
[1:16:13] made it to the Cross if it had not been
[1:16:15] for Gethsemane he would not have been
[1:16:17] able to make it to the Cross think about
[1:16:19] that if it not been for our gethsemanes
[1:16:21] over and over and over again we never
[1:16:24] come to the ability to stay on that

[1:16:48] crucified

[1:17:54] fine but people have watched it many
[1:17:55] times over and then and it's something

[1:20:57] conquered the gates of the Grave he rose
[1:20:59] up on the third day for our
[1:21:00] justification and now we are more than

[1:21:11] walk right into it that almost makes it

[1:26:54] he faced
[1:26:56] we go through our own little portion of
[1:26:58] hell and all the demons that go with
[1:27:00] that but he faced them all come on yes
[1:27:02] sir I gotta climb back up on my perch
[1:27:05] here
[1:27:08] I'm about there one more hour I'll be
[1:27:10] done okay all right
[1:27:12] you heard him just kidding I'm not
[1:27:16] all right well I can just see him
[1:27:18] through my again through the the eyes of
[1:27:20] the eagle here through this this this
[1:27:22] Vision that we have looking back this
[1:27:24] time travel whatever you want to call it
[1:27:25] I can just see him as he's walking up to
[1:27:27] to Gethsemane here and the disciples are
[1:27:31] following him just as clueless as
[1:27:33] clueless could be tired sleepy listen
[1:27:36] this is night time they've already
[1:27:38] they've already had a Last Supper you
[1:27:40] know how it is when you have supper you
[1:27:41] get sleepy afterwards right they've
[1:27:43] already they've already had their feet
[1:27:44] washed right
[1:27:47] they've already went through the strain
[1:27:48] when Jesus is sitting there and they're
[1:27:50] saying you know he said one of you will
[1:27:51] betray me and and judah's sitting there
[1:27:54] and every one of them not one of them
[1:27:56] looked at Judas and said I knew it all
[1:27:59] the time that's right so we do sometimes
[1:28:01] I knew that was that brother I knew it
[1:28:04] right that ain't what they did what did
[1:28:06] they say almost and with one Accord they
[1:28:07] all said is it me Lord
[1:28:09] is it me all right that's right
[1:28:14] they knew they had something there was
[1:28:16] something there that made them doubt
[1:28:17] themselves right right Jesus said he it
[1:28:21] is
[1:28:21] it's the one who dips his sock right
[1:28:26] in the Bowl yesterday
[1:28:28] I don't understand that terminology but
[1:28:30] that's okay because Judas did it
[1:28:32] and he said do what you got to do
[1:28:34] man and he went out yep hi
[1:28:39] and the disciples had no clue
[1:28:41] they knew something was going on
[1:28:44] they'd heard the words that he'd spoken
[1:28:46] and all these things they perhaps had
[1:28:47] felt his mood change I'm sure his mood
[1:28:49] had changed perhaps he was becoming more
[1:28:51] withdrawn wow all the as all the Demons
[1:28:54] of hell were beginning to gather around
[1:28:56] him the atmospheres were changing around
[1:28:58] him you can feel things that other can't
[1:29:00] feel right right the atmospheres begin
[1:29:02] to grow heavy demons were were coming
[1:29:05] together they were coalescing they were
[1:29:07] con they were condensing they were they
[1:29:10] were drawing closer and closer and
[1:29:12] closer they were being drawn by that
[1:29:14] life that dwelled inside that precious
[1:29:16] and Sacred Heart oh my and we wonder
[1:29:19] sometimes why the devil just seemed to
[1:29:22] zero in on us brother Brandon makes a
[1:29:24] statement that you can live so close to
[1:29:26] to Christ that the devil can't even find
[1:29:28] you and you think man he found me
[1:29:33] amen well he found this he didn't find
[1:29:35] me right praise the Lord amen he didn't
[1:29:39] find the Christ inside of me he didn't
[1:29:40] find the real me there you go but we
[1:29:42] wonder why do these things happen well
[1:29:44] this is why because they recognize that
[1:29:46] life that's inside of you
[1:29:49] they recognize the life of their enemy
[1:29:52] living in you and they hate that life
[1:29:56] when God said at the beginning that he
[1:29:58] would put enmity between the two seeds
[1:30:01] yes that word enmity means a hatred
[1:30:04] that's right a hatred a conflict between
[1:30:08] mortal enemies right they hate you
[1:30:11] that's okay devil I hate you too
[1:30:14] I can't say that about my brother about
[1:30:17] my people around there I hate you don't
[1:30:18] tell even if you don't like them but
[1:30:20] don't don't say you hate them but I hate
[1:30:22] that devil right
[1:30:24] come on that's the truth they're drawn
[1:30:28] to their life like a bug to the light
[1:30:31] and they recognize that life of their
[1:30:33] enemy inside of you and as all the
[1:30:35] Demons of Hell begin to gather and press
[1:30:37] against Jesus as he climbs climbs up to
[1:30:40] the garden
[1:30:42] yeah
[1:30:44] and in the heavens
[1:30:47] in the heavens
[1:30:50] Jesus looks up
[1:30:53] and the stars are starting to line up oh
[1:30:55] my
[1:30:56] can I go there just for a minute
[1:30:59] and the Stars
[1:31:02] are lining up now I'm not a astrologer
[1:31:08] and I don't go through the papers and
[1:31:10] read my my signs
[1:31:14] it's crazy how those things line up
[1:31:15] sometimes though ain't it
[1:31:19] but I know what the prophet said and we
[1:31:20] don't go by all that stuff right we
[1:31:22] don't we're reading our horoscopes and
[1:31:23] all like that but what I do know I do
[1:31:26] know because I can I can do research on
[1:31:29] the computer now right they've got these
[1:31:30] wonderful little programs apps on your
[1:31:33] iPad and everything else and they'll
[1:31:34] show you where the stars are and where
[1:31:36] the constellations are
[1:31:38] for any date in history
[1:31:42] you see that's how well everything is in
[1:31:44] control by God that's right it runs it
[1:31:46] runs on such a such a time that they can
[1:31:48] literally go back at any date in history
[1:31:50] and tell you where the the stars were at
[1:31:53] that time factoring in the wobble of the
[1:31:56] earth and everything else
[1:31:58] yes so yeah I'm not an astrologer but I
[1:32:01] can I can flip an iPad buddy
[1:32:05] oh
[1:32:08] and I don't know all those things but I
[1:32:10] do know of the three major
[1:32:11] constellations that were in play on this
[1:32:13] Passover week in 1990 years ago and if
[1:32:15] you'll bear with me just a minute I want
[1:32:17] to go through this and we'll we'll close
[1:32:18] here
[1:32:19] and we'll just trust the Lord to bring
[1:32:21] it to a crescendo and we'll we'll have a
[1:32:22] wonderful time but now I do know this I
[1:32:25] do know that God wrote his word in the
[1:32:26] Stars right
[1:32:28] and in the southwestern
[1:32:31] the southwestern sky
[1:32:34] as we're standing in the temple
[1:32:36] Standing On Top of the temple now and
[1:32:39] hanging over the upper room it's amazing
[1:32:41] it was over it's in the sky there over
[1:32:44] and behind the upper room the
[1:32:46] southwestern sky
[1:32:48] Justice Judas just as Judas is about to
[1:32:51] dip his sop in the bowl and go out to
[1:32:54] deliver Jesus up to the to the chief
[1:32:56] priest in the southwestern sky
[1:32:59] there's a scorpion Rising
[1:33:03] with its stinger poised just cocked back
[1:33:07] yeah and ready to strike
[1:33:11] we call this constellation Scorpio
[1:33:14] that's right it's the Scorpion yes
[1:33:18] and I believe that Jesus could look to
[1:33:20] the Stars seeing as how he was the one
[1:33:22] that created him he knew what was going
[1:33:23] on right
[1:33:25] the same stars that
[1:33:27] that the father had reached out there
[1:33:29] and stopped in certain places and put
[1:33:31] them there and wrote the the word across
[1:33:33] the skies to foretell the day that he
[1:33:35] was living in right there Jesus could
[1:33:37] look up and he could see that enemy
[1:33:39] climbing the star steps of Heaven that's
[1:33:41] right
[1:33:42] and he knew what was coming
[1:33:45] he knew what was coming
[1:33:47] as he's walking the Gethsemane he's
[1:33:49] seeing that I just kind of think he must
[1:33:51] have he knows all things right the
[1:33:54] father knows all things and Jesus knows
[1:33:56] what's coming and maybe perhaps he he
[1:33:58] understood I know he could he understood
[1:33:59] that part too and he knew what was
[1:34:01] coming in there and there's the enemy
[1:34:03] ready to strike
[1:34:08] yes sir
[1:34:10] the word declared victory
[1:34:13] and Jesus believed the word he'd already
[1:34:16] testified to the word declaring his
[1:34:18] faith there he said tear down this
[1:34:19] temple in three days I'll raise it up
[1:34:21] again and I have the power to lay my
[1:34:22] down my life and I had the power to
[1:34:24] raise it back up again right yes sir
[1:34:26] Hallelujah Jesus Jesus knew what was
[1:34:28] coming and what the end would be but
[1:34:30] that still didn't make it easy when he
[1:34:32] looks back and he sees that enemy there
[1:34:34] right yes sir and as the greatest battle
[1:34:36] that's ever been fought came together in
[1:34:38] the Garden of Gethsemane he bows his
[1:34:41] head in prayer and he begins to pray
[1:34:43] father if it be thy will let this cup
[1:34:46] pass for me amen father if it be thy
[1:34:49] will let this cup pass from me but it
[1:34:53] wasn't the father's will right
[1:34:56] come on
[1:34:58] and the Scorpion climbed higher
[1:35:03] and again sometimes it feels that way
[1:35:05] when we pray
[1:35:07] Lord get me out of this situation
[1:35:10] Lord I feel awful
[1:35:12] Lord Heal Me yeah right
[1:35:15] Lord bring my kids back in amen come on
[1:35:18] right his flesh was crying out
[1:35:22] if it be thy will
[1:35:24] let this cup pass from me
[1:35:27] his flesh knew what was ahead there and
[1:35:30] even though in his spirit
[1:35:33] he wanted the father's will
[1:35:35] that flesh still cried out that's right
[1:35:41] but Escape
[1:35:44] wasn't the father's will oh
[1:35:49] for the word of God had something so so
[1:35:51] much greater in store
[1:35:54] for Jesus amen
[1:35:56] praise the Lord
[1:35:57] uh-huh
[1:35:59] don't give up when Deliverance is long
[1:36:01] and coming right
[1:36:03] right when it seems we have been
[1:36:04] abandoned and our prayers
[1:36:08] have not just been turned down but just
[1:36:11] turned upside down or worse it seems
[1:36:14] like they fall on deaf ears listen God
[1:36:16] is not deaf amen God hears you
[1:36:20] we have this confidence that he hears us
[1:36:22] when we pray that's right
[1:36:25] God knows what he's doing and if God
[1:36:27] says no
[1:36:29] I will not remove this suffering oh my
[1:36:32] come on now
[1:36:33] he knows it's because there's a greater
[1:36:35] Victory coming
[1:36:38] greatest Victory I know is when we walk
[1:36:40] up that Glory way in a new body
[1:36:42] character this form character is just
[1:36:45] like his character Hallelujah right
[1:36:47] that's right there's a victory coming
[1:36:49] much greater Victory coming my goodness
[1:36:51] when we stand for him over everything
[1:36:53] else of the world our our friends turn
[1:36:55] us down our family turns us down or this
[1:36:58] one turns us down everything else but
[1:36:59] Lord I'll stand for you
[1:37:03] he knows he knows
[1:37:07] Jesus looks back and he sees the
[1:37:09] Scorpion raising up over there
[1:37:12] and he goes in he begins to pray and as
[1:37:14] he begins to pray and that devil begins
[1:37:16] to berate him and all the forces come
[1:37:18] together and and those devils are coming
[1:37:19] there you think you're able do you think
[1:37:21] you're worthy you think you're this you
[1:37:23] think you're that or if you really were
[1:37:24] who you said you were and all these
[1:37:27] things and you've got to take he knew he
[1:37:28] had he was a sacrificial lamb for the
[1:37:30] world he knew why he had come into the
[1:37:32] world he had to take every bit of it so
[1:37:34] Jesus looks around he says I'll take
[1:37:36] that one I'll take that one I'll take
[1:37:37] that one I'll take his sin I'll take her
[1:37:39] sin I'll take that one and he went down
[1:37:41] the list somehow or another he went down
[1:37:44] the list from everybody from Adam and
[1:37:46] Eve all the way down to the last seed
[1:37:48] that comes in Hallelujah everyone that
[1:37:51] the blood of Jesus will cover the sin
[1:37:53] for he took it there in the in the in
[1:37:55] Gethsemane amen right Satan says you
[1:37:59] think you're able he said I'm more than
[1:38:01] able Hallelujah
[1:38:02] [Applause]
[1:38:06] pass from me but nevertheless
[1:38:11] nevertheless
[1:38:13] not my will
[1:38:15] thy will be done
[1:38:17] I'll stand for you
[1:38:20] I'll take it yeah
[1:38:22] perhaps he could turn around as he stood
[1:38:24] up to go back to the disciples for the
[1:38:25] second time and say it's enough get up
[1:38:28] let's go
[1:38:31] perhaps he looks back over there at that
[1:38:33] constellation of the Scorpion
[1:38:36] and rising up just above the Scorpion
[1:38:40] is another constellation
[1:38:42] another constellation
[1:38:45] the Scorpion represents the seed of the
[1:38:48] serpent
[1:38:50] but just above the Scorpion in the sky
[1:38:52] there was a man standing up too
[1:38:56] come on come on there was a man standing
[1:38:59] up yeah
[1:39:00] praise God Amen he's not left us alone
[1:39:05] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:39:07] he'll raise up a standard right he'll
[1:39:10] raise up a standard and there was a man
[1:39:12] standing up in the heavens and this man
[1:39:15] had a serpent in his hand
[1:39:18] glory to God yeah
[1:39:20] to the Greeks this this this
[1:39:22] constellation this man that it
[1:39:25] represents is is
[1:39:27] I'll not this will not be right I know
[1:39:29] but it's
[1:39:30] officus nope that's not right it's
[1:39:32] something like that anyways but what it
[1:39:34] means is serpent Bearer yeah amen
[1:39:38] serpent bear that's what that name that
[1:39:40] I can't pronounce that's what it means
[1:39:42] serpent Bearer
[1:39:43] so as a scorpion is ready to strike and
[1:39:46] Jesus comes to the place where he's
[1:39:47] saying not my will but thy will be done
[1:39:49] he looks and there's the man standing
[1:39:51] there with a serpent firmly in his room
[1:39:54] now there's a struggle going on because
[1:39:56] the serpent is also twined around his
[1:39:58] leg and he's standing there in the Stars
[1:40:00] God writing out the struggle in the
[1:40:03] Stars there's a scorpion but here's the
[1:40:05] man the conflict's taking place and
[1:40:07] Jesus says I'm more than able because
[1:40:09] it's written in the stars it's written
[1:40:12] in the word that the man will stand
[1:40:14] Hallelujah and he'll grab that serpent
[1:40:16] by the by the head Hallelujah the Bible
[1:40:19] said that that serpent will bruise your
[1:40:22] heel but you will cross his head
[1:40:25] you will cross his head and that's
[1:40:28] exactly what he had going on he was in
[1:40:31] the process
[1:40:32] of crushing that head Hallelujah
[1:40:37] Hallelujah
[1:40:39] they cast Officer says some mythological
[1:40:43] figure that wrestled with snakes or
[1:40:45] something I didn't have time to go into
[1:40:47] all the back story of that forgive me
[1:40:48] for that but but this ain't some Greek
[1:40:51] mythology that we're talking about here
[1:40:52] this is the word of God Written in the
[1:40:55] Stars amen when God first began to
[1:40:57] express himself in word form when he
[1:41:00] said let there be light I don't
[1:41:01] Hallelujah he was already standing he
[1:41:04] was the Lamb of God slain before the
[1:41:05] foundation of the world
[1:41:07] glory to God Amen yeah
[1:41:11] the Greeks
[1:41:13] and the fortune tellers
[1:41:14] don't own the Stars God does God does
[1:41:19] amen amen and again I know we don't
[1:41:22] govern Our Lives by reading the
[1:41:24] horoscopes and all the different things
[1:41:25] and reading those signs but there's
[1:41:26] truth in them brother Brandon pointed
[1:41:28] all that out you know that's right he
[1:41:31] did sure did I don't know why I feel
[1:41:32] like I have to say that and give that
[1:41:34] disclaimer every time I talk about that
[1:41:35] but brother Brown said so right yeah
[1:41:39] so as a scorpion with this deadly
[1:41:41] Stinger is rising there and about to
[1:41:43] strike so was the serpent Bearer The Man
[1:41:46] Who wrestles with the serpent and as
[1:41:49] Jesus struggles in the garden he lays
[1:41:51] hands on those demons he lays hands on
[1:41:55] those demons and he grabs them there and
[1:41:57] in the heavens in the spiritual Realms
[1:42:00] there must have been such a blast that
[1:42:02] went out that shook everything amen when
[1:42:06] those two forces came together and Jesus
[1:42:08] Christ the Messiah the word of God made
[1:42:11] flesh and blood and Satan that great Arc
[1:42:13] enemy of God and all that is Godly and
[1:42:16] all the Demons of hell they just ran
[1:42:19] full speed full speed into each other in
[1:42:22] the garden and the angels of God stood
[1:42:25] off
[1:42:26] speechless
[1:42:29] and watching
[1:42:31] because they could not join The Fray
[1:42:34] they were sidelined by God himself
[1:42:38] you heard the story brother Branham said
[1:42:40] you just hold on
[1:42:42] Gabriel said I'll go and I think he was
[1:42:45] talking about the three Hebrew children
[1:42:46] at the time but right I'd say pretty
[1:42:47] much applies here too yeah
[1:42:50] absolutely Gabriel says I'll go no no no
[1:42:52] no no
[1:42:53] wormwood said I'll go I'll pour out the
[1:42:55] flood and I'll wash that fire out
[1:42:58] I'll take them Devils out of that Garden
[1:43:00] God said you hold on
[1:43:03] this is a god-site that's right that's
[1:43:05] right this is a god-sized job yep
[1:43:07] Hallelujah
[1:43:10] Jesus knew that he had to do this alone
[1:43:12] he was the man who must deal with the
[1:43:14] serpent amen and God had prophesied
[1:43:17] thousands of years ago when the first
[1:43:19] man and woman fell there in the garden
[1:43:22] and were being cast out of the Garden of
[1:43:24] Eden God says wait wait don't nothing to
[1:43:28] hold on
[1:43:29] I'm not going to cast you all for good
[1:43:31] yeah because you see I love you you're
[1:43:34] the apple of my eye I can't do without
[1:43:36] you you know we think sometimes with the
[1:43:38] different ones if they do us wrong we're
[1:43:39] going to cast them out and be done with
[1:43:40] it that's not the spirit of God we think
[1:43:43] if our family does this or that that's
[1:43:44] not the spirit of God God says wait
[1:43:48] and we'll fix this I'll Make A Way man
[1:43:51] couldn't make a way but I'll Make A Way
[1:43:53] brother Brown said he put Adam and them
[1:43:55] on the Covenant they said if you do this
[1:43:57] I'll do that he said but man couldn't do
[1:43:59] that so he came back by his love he come
[1:44:01] back through Abraham and he said I'll do
[1:44:04] it
[1:44:05] unconditional right I'll do it praise
[1:44:08] the Lord Jesus Hallelujah and he did
[1:44:13] he did yes sir amen praise the Lord
[1:44:16] Jesus
[1:44:17] I'll come myself as the woman's seed yes
[1:44:20] yes and I will prevail
[1:44:22] Oh Glory to God
[1:44:25] praise His name
[1:44:27] Hallelujah
[1:44:29] all those things amen
[1:44:31] and God came as the man
[1:44:34] the seed of the woman and the serpent
[1:44:36] Bearer yep right and this in the stars
[1:44:39] the man grabs the serpent
[1:44:43] and the Scorpion still Waits with his
[1:44:46] deadly singer
[1:44:47] and hold the battle that presses and
[1:44:49] pushes and rages through the Flesh of
[1:44:52] Jesus his brow drought ground is
[1:44:54] crunched together in the great distress
[1:44:56] great drops of sweater farming and
[1:44:58] running down his face those riblets of
[1:45:01] sweat began to turn crimson red as the
[1:45:04] cells the blood cells began to burst
[1:45:06] under the pressure that he's under this
[1:45:08] time the strain of his being and what
[1:45:10] he's doing at this time and oh the
[1:45:12] battle that's raging amen and then Jesus
[1:45:15] begins to get up he gets up he rises up
[1:45:19] with the battle still raging inside of
[1:45:21] him because now he's got all the Devils
[1:45:24] of hell
[1:45:26] firmly
[1:45:27] firmly locked in him
[1:45:31] and we've not even come to Calvary yet
[1:45:34] you see why he said it's the greatest
[1:45:36] battle ever fought
[1:45:38] I can see him maybe perhaps the flesh
[1:45:42] struggling to rise to his feet those
[1:45:44] precious feet with all the Devils of
[1:45:47] Hell riding and digging into his flesh
[1:45:49] there were sugar diabetes riding in that
[1:45:52] flesh that's right right there was heart
[1:45:55] issues riding in that flesh there was
[1:45:57] cancer eating in that flesh that's right
[1:46:00] there was mental battles riding in that
[1:46:03] flesh there was depression there was
[1:46:05] anxiety there was all the different all
[1:46:07] the Devils of hell were riding and
[1:46:09] tormenting that flesh he was taking them
[1:46:12] every one and they're beginning to take
[1:46:14] hold with every disease and attack that
[1:46:17] Satan can mount and as Jesus rises in
[1:46:20] those great drops of sweat and blood
[1:46:22] that begin to fall I want you to know
[1:46:24] this I want you to listen to me as Jesus
[1:46:27] got to his feet those Devils didn't have
[1:46:30] him he had them
[1:46:32] [Applause]
[1:46:35] he had them right Hallelujah
[1:46:41] he had them firmly in his grip I can
[1:46:43] imagine so we got him now
[1:46:45] and also one of those Devils goes oh
[1:46:50] I'm feeling kind of constrained here
[1:46:52] come on what in the world give me some
[1:46:55] room yeah
[1:46:57] Jesus has them firmly in his grip amen
[1:47:00] glory to God yes sir that little body
[1:47:03] that little frail body oh my the iron
[1:47:05] that must have been flowing through them
[1:47:07] veins at that time and they were just
[1:47:09] locked on those devils
[1:47:12] Hallelujah and the man holds the serpent
[1:47:16] riding over the side over the over the
[1:47:18] Scorpion
[1:47:20] and then Jesus is captured he's taken
[1:47:23] into pilate's Hall he's taken before
[1:47:25] Herod and Oh my he had to be brought all
[1:47:28] the way back from Gethsemane all the way
[1:47:31] back to the other side of the temple
[1:47:33] just above where the upper room or the
[1:47:35] room where they were saying that just
[1:47:36] above that room is where herod's herod's
[1:47:39] Palace was he's carried all the way back
[1:47:41] over there
[1:47:42] and man and put in front of pilot and
[1:47:44] and when we know the story how pilate we
[1:47:46] didn't want to crucify him but but not
[1:47:48] really believing either so so he tries
[1:47:50] to wash his hands of it all and I think
[1:47:52] of the many folks today who try to do
[1:47:54] the same thing with this message and and
[1:47:56] we've spoke many times of those who've
[1:47:57] come against the message selling out in
[1:47:59] a Judas kind of manner they do but but
[1:48:01] what about the many who stand judging
[1:48:03] the message and don't say anything they
[1:48:05] don't want to say bad things about it
[1:48:07] just in case it's really true
[1:48:10] but yet they'll not fully commit to this
[1:48:12] message either and Believe on the Lord
[1:48:14] Jesus Christ and the word for their day
[1:48:16] amen so they try to wash their hands of
[1:48:19] it all and walk away but it's impossible
[1:48:22] to walk away from it
[1:48:26] listen don't think you can stand in
[1:48:28] Judgment of this word
[1:48:30] deciding what is right and what is wrong
[1:48:33] picking and choosing what to take and
[1:48:35] what not to preaching don't think we can
[1:48:37] stand judging and get off scot-free all
[1:48:40] right Jesus is crucified afresh like
[1:48:43] that that's right amen but God does the
[1:48:46] final judging amen
[1:48:47] and it did not end well with pilot
[1:48:52] the male the man held on to the serpent
[1:48:57] perhaps Jesus looked to the heavens and
[1:48:59] he saw the battle raging
[1:49:02] and as they beat him and they scourged
[1:49:04] him
[1:49:04] they tore chunks of Flesh from his body
[1:49:08] and he'd look and the man was still
[1:49:09] standing yep so he still stood yeah
[1:49:12] that's right and they would Mock and
[1:49:15] they would do this and they would do
[1:49:16] that and they'd all slap him and spit on
[1:49:18] him and he'd look and that man was still
[1:49:20] standing yeah
[1:49:21] [Music]
[1:49:23] and as the sun rose on
[1:49:25] Friday Nissan 3 April the 3rd
[1:49:29] they let our Lord off to Calvary
[1:49:32] yeah now we come to Good Friday
[1:49:34] in the last five minutes
[1:49:38] and they nailed our Lord to that cruel
[1:49:40] Roman Tree
[1:49:42] and as you hung there with the weight of
[1:49:44] the world upon his shoulders
[1:49:46] with the Scorpion still ready to strike
[1:49:48] at any moment remember death had to
[1:49:50] plunge its stinger right
[1:49:53] but as he hangs there on that cross
[1:49:55] perhaps he could look there and he could
[1:49:56] see that scorpion ready to strike
[1:49:58] but then there was another sign
[1:50:01] rising in the southwestern Skies
[1:50:04] and if you were to stand on top of the
[1:50:06] Temple
[1:50:07] in Jerusalem
[1:50:09] and you looked West
[1:50:14] you would be facing Golgotha
[1:50:17] and also the tomb of a certain rich man
[1:50:19] named Joseph of Arimathea yep
[1:50:22] and on April 3rd 33 A.D there was
[1:50:25] another Heavenly sign
[1:50:27] and the Bible said that the son refused
[1:50:29] to shine from the sixth hour until the
[1:50:32] ninth hour
[1:50:33] right that's a three-hour blackout right
[1:50:35] right some say that the Stars themselves
[1:50:38] blacked out
[1:50:40] some say it was a solar eclipse
[1:50:42] but it couldn't have been a solar
[1:50:44] eclipse because it was a full moon at
[1:50:45] the time
[1:50:46] solar eclipses only happened in the new
[1:50:48] moon
[1:50:50] which was two weeks prior to that wow so
[1:50:52] we're half a month off it couldn't have
[1:50:54] been a solar eclipse and and the the
[1:50:56] astrologers can they've gone back and
[1:50:58] they can tell you no there was no solar
[1:51:00] eclipse on that day
[1:51:02] and they talk about brother Brown and
[1:51:04] missing his dates yeah wow
[1:51:07] and during a solar eclipse the other
[1:51:09] stars don't go out in fact they almost
[1:51:11] look brighter in a way
[1:51:13] but here they all went black
[1:51:16] here's what I think happened come on
[1:51:19] I'm not making a Doctrine out of this or
[1:51:21] anything else but
[1:51:22] but I think what what happened the
[1:51:24] Angels were literally turning their back
[1:51:28] come on the angels
[1:51:31] in one place he told pilot or he told
[1:51:36] the priest he told him forgive me my
[1:51:38] mind is totally blank he told him there
[1:51:39] he said do you not think that I can call
[1:51:41] more the 12 Legions of angels all right
[1:51:44] right yeah you have no power over me but
[1:51:47] what God gives me that's right where God
[1:51:49] gives you right I could call 12 more
[1:51:50] than 12 Legions amen a legion
[1:51:54] a legion was up to is a very number of
[1:51:56] was up to six six thousand six thousand
[1:52:00] one hundred and eighty two I believe it
[1:52:01] was
[1:52:03] foot soldiers
[1:52:05] and then there were 726 Calvary
[1:52:09] at the highest number
[1:52:11] so you had at that time you had over 6
[1:52:14] 800 angels
[1:52:17] that he could have called
[1:52:19] where were they at right
[1:52:22] well he didn't call him we know he
[1:52:23] didn't call him
[1:52:26] but I guarantee you they were there yeah
[1:52:28] yeah they were there just waiting on it
[1:52:30] just give us the sign move your pinky do
[1:52:34] something right
[1:52:36] right but he couldn't do it because if
[1:52:38] he had done that
[1:52:42] where would we be
[1:52:44] right where would we be
[1:52:47] so instead I think they had to turn
[1:52:48] their backs
[1:52:51] not in rejection
[1:52:54] but in grief
[1:52:58] yeah they turned their backs on Jesus as
[1:53:00] he hung there on the cross
[1:53:02] out of sadness
[1:53:04] they couldn't bear to watch as he hung
[1:53:06] there and God himself forsook him
[1:53:09] and about the ninth hour he cried out my
[1:53:11] God my God
[1:53:13] why is thou forsaken me
[1:53:17] he cried it's finished
[1:53:20] and he gave up the ghost
[1:53:24] the Bible says also that the moon would
[1:53:26] not give her light
[1:53:28] there wasn't a solar eclipse but there
[1:53:30] was actually a lunar eclipse that
[1:53:31] happened on April the 3rd A.D 33. wow
[1:53:35] and and actually the main proof that
[1:53:37] many and that's actually the main proof
[1:53:39] that many hold for saying that Jesus was
[1:53:40] born on zero some say he was born on
[1:53:43] four A.D others say he was born in zero
[1:53:46] but this is one of the things that they
[1:53:47] they give us a sign that said no he's
[1:53:49] born he's born zero that was the ending
[1:53:51] of BC and the starting of A.D right and
[1:53:54] and they and he died in in 33 and they
[1:53:57] look at the sky charts or whatever you
[1:53:59] call them and they say that there was a
[1:54:01] total there was a lunar eclipse on that
[1:54:03] day and the Bible said that the moon
[1:54:06] didn't shine and some say it would have
[1:54:08] actually been when it when it come back
[1:54:09] and all the the routing up and
[1:54:10] everything else it would have been a
[1:54:11] blood moon
[1:54:14] it had been a blood moon with the Moon
[1:54:15] turning red yeah yeah and oh my as the
[1:54:18] Lord was hanging his head and his Spirit
[1:54:20] was leaving his body as the blood was
[1:54:22] emptying out upon the Earth the moon was
[1:54:24] turning blood it was turning red it was
[1:54:26] turning to blood and bread and another
[1:54:29] sign the moon had become had come it had
[1:54:32] moved over and it was literally they run
[1:54:34] the charts the moon was literally
[1:54:36] hanging over the head of the serpent of
[1:54:40] the Scorpion amen and Jesus could look
[1:54:43] and he could see that scorpion there and
[1:54:45] there's a Blood Moon Hallelujah there's
[1:54:48] a blood riding over the head amen
[1:54:51] hallelujah and that's not all that you
[1:54:54] know that constellation was was riding
[1:54:56] low the Scorpion as it comes up and it's
[1:54:57] riding low to the Earth and the moon is
[1:54:59] riding low and turning to blood covered
[1:55:01] over the Scorpion's head but then again
[1:55:03] demand don't forget the man because the
[1:55:05] man during this whole time the man is
[1:55:07] still standing there with a serpent in
[1:55:09] his hands
[1:55:10] damn it it's wrapped around his legs
[1:55:13] don't sometimes it feels like the
[1:55:14] serpent like Satan has us all wrapped up
[1:55:15] but never never never at any point does
[1:55:19] the snake wrap up the man the man always
[1:55:21] has the serpent firmly in his hands he's
[1:55:24] got him in control Jesus was not
[1:55:26] defeated and Drug away to a devil's hell
