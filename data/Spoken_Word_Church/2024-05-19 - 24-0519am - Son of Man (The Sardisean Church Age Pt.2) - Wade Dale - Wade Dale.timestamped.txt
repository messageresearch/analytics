[0:59] their conscience
[1:00] I've had a bad conscience all my life it

[1:06] but I thought I had it all until the
[1:08] real one came and said
[1:10] hey you know better and you just back up
[1:14] and leave it alone and uh you know
[1:17] sometimes I think for me I Take God for
[1:19] granted do you ever do that all of you I
[1:22] mean really you stop and think you take
[1:24] God for granted you asked him to do
[1:26] something I was working on a little
[1:28] thing down at the shop I found a little
[1:29] little toy of all the things I got to do
[1:32] in my life I found this little
[1:36] toy give me a minute here anyway it had
[1:39] a piece missing and I couldn't find it
[1:41] it was a little tricycle brother Mark
[1:43] had it and the wheels were gone on it
[1:45] and everything and wanding through all
[1:46] my junk I found a set of wheels to put
[1:48] on it I took a break and I missed one of
[1:50] the little pedals was about as big as my
[1:52] thumb and I couldn't find it and I had a
[1:53] little bicycle working real good it took
[1:55] me about an hour to put it all back
[1:56] together and I couldn't find that pedal
[1:58] nowhere and I would have had made one
[2:00] and you can't make them exactly the same
[2:03] so I just said simply Lord you know
[2:05] where it is if you want me to have it
[2:07] you'll show it to me and you'll find it
[2:10] for me and I just said that prayer and
[2:14] just walked away when on about my

[25:19] Lord we come with expectation Lord to
[25:21] hear from you father through the
[25:23] foolishness of preaching father this is
[25:25] what you you ordained before the
[25:27] foundation the the world for us to come
[25:29] to Perfection is through the Sunday
[25:32] schools and the teachers and all the
[25:34] different things Lord the preachers and
[25:36] evangelists and pastors and Prophets You
[25:39] You ordained that whole group of people
[25:40] to bring a a group of people to
[25:42] Perfection and father we pray that you
[25:45] would help us today Lord be with the
[25:47] ones that are sick the ones that are not
[25:49] here Lord that are traveling maybe we
[25:50] pray that you'd just be with them Father
[25:52] forgive us of our sins and our mistakes
[25:54] that we make Lord against you just
[25:56] cleanse us from all unri in Jesus name
[26:00] amen jardian Church age this is part two
[26:04] we'll get to all that in just a second
[26:05] and we'll go over one more thing on the
[26:08] U tharan Church age that I'm I'm missed
[26:11] I want to talk about it just a second so
[26:12] I was in the spirit on the Lord's day
[26:14] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[26:16] a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega
[26:18] the first and the last now remember the
[26:21] alpha bride we already been through the
[26:22] alpha bride right right all right but we
[26:25] haven't been through the Omega bride
[26:26] because that's you right
[26:29] you are the Omega bride the alpha
[26:31] bride's already gone on they've already
[26:33] done their job they've done what they
[26:35] supposed to do then that that same Alpha
[26:37] bride anointing is supposed to come back
[26:39] in the end time as the Omega bride
[26:42] everybody with me all right so that's
[26:44] what we're into right now but we want to
[26:47] see what happened here but now when we
[26:49] come to these middle Church ages that's
[26:51] all become eroded man's ideas Creeds
[26:54] doctrines and then remember God said I'm
[26:56] going to kill him with death all right
[26:59] with doctrines because Doctrine is what
[27:01] kills
[27:03] us but here God says I am Alpha and
[27:05] Omega the first and the last what thou
[27:07] see us write in the book and send it to
[27:09] these seven Church ages Ephesus Smyrna
[27:11] pergamus thara Sardis Philadelphia and L
[27:14] to see and I turned to see the voice
[27:16] that spake with me and being turned I
[27:18] saw seven golden candlesticks and in the
[27:20] midst of the seven candlesticks one
[27:22] liken to the son of man clothed with a
[27:24] garment down to the foot and G about to
[27:26] paps with a golden girdle you may be
[27:28] seated and I'll read Revelations 3:1
[27:31] we're now in Revelations chap 3 and unto
[27:34] the angel of the church in Sardis right
[27:36] these things sayith he that hath the
[27:37] seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars
[27:41] God is telling us in every age that he's
[27:43] got it he starts off and say look I got
[27:47] it I got it handled I know what I'm
[27:49] doing I've got the stars in my hand I've
[27:52] got the churches in my hand and I know
[27:55] what I'm doing then he
[27:57] goes I Know Thy
[27:59] works that thou H has a name that thou
[28:01] livest and are dead now remember before
[28:05] the Dark Ages there was no such thing as
[28:07] a
[28:09] denomination by
[28:11] name Baptist Methodist Pentecostal there
[28:13] was not a name until we get to this ttir
[28:16] age when we come out of that into Sardis
[28:18] when we come into the sardian church age
[28:21] there's a name comes out that you
[28:22] liveing by but you're dead all right Be
[28:26] watchful and strengthen the things which
[28:28] remain they are ready to die for I have
[28:30] not found thy works perfect before God
[28:34] this is a statement that God's telling
[28:35] us remember therefore how thou Hast
[28:38] received and heard and hold fast and
[28:40] repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch
[28:43] I will come on thee as a thief and thou
[28:45] shalt not know what hour I will come
[28:47] unto thee or upon thee thou Hast a few
[28:50] names even in Sardis which have not
[28:52] defile their garments and they shall
[28:53] walk with me in white for they are
[28:55] worthy thank God he comes to a place and
[28:57] he says I got a group that's worthy all
[29:00] right and I'm going to work on them and
[29:01] I'm going to work through them because
[29:02] remember as God goes he's fluid through
[29:05] the church ages he he doesn't stop
[29:07] remember he just continues going on so
[29:09] he's got to bring an anointing to these
[29:11] sardian people that are a little bit
[29:13] different but I want you to realize one
[29:15] thing I was thinking about this
[29:16] yesterday as we build foundations to
[29:19] build a building on all that is
[29:22] something that you and I are standing on
[29:24] today all right we've all if you've been
[29:26] born again or you just started in your
[29:28] journey if you've been Justified you
[29:30] were justified by the same justification
[29:32] that Luther had hello all
[29:35] right cuz that was his Revelation but
[29:38] now God put him in the body in that
[29:39] Revelation but we come up to the
[29:41] Revelation now and we see that I'm going
[29:45] to do a a sermon a little bit later on
[29:48] after we get finished with
[29:49] this cuz you got to understand that when
[29:53] when Martin Luther he had the same Holy
[29:55] Ghost you did right God's not de
[29:58] different he don't give different Holy
[30:00] Ghost but a holy the Holy Ghost only
[30:03] works by what words you
[30:05] have so Martin Luther had a had the Holy
[30:08] Ghost he didn't have the fullness now
[30:10] you'll hear Brother R say they had part
[30:12] well listen if you got part of the Holy
[30:14] Ghost you got the Holy Ghost right okay
[30:16] he had the Holy Ghost in his soul he's
[30:18] very
[30:19] important right but there was a lot of
[30:22] things Luther did we were talking about
[30:23] yesterday he caused a lot of problems
[30:26] being a human being but brother I'll
[30:28] read it to you in a few minutes brother
[30:29] R said Jonah had a lot of problems too
[30:31] but he was a prophet all right so we
[30:33] have to take the prophetic part that
[30:35] that Lu or had that is your very
[30:37] Foundation to start your Christian
[30:39] Journey everybody with me we can't do
[30:42] away with that then same way with John
[30:44] Wesley we can't do away with that we got
[30:45] to come to sanctification then we got to
[30:48] come to the new birth but when you plant
[30:51] a garden as Zach's planted and found out
[30:54] the deer eat his too that when you plant
[30:57] a garden and you look out through there
[30:58] there's nothing and all of a sudden
[30:59] there's two little green shoots pop up
[31:02] that's what the deer like the two shoots
[31:05] pop up well that's important that's not
[31:08] corn but it's identifying itself from
[31:11] the life that's in it that this is going
[31:12] to be corn if you let it mature and keep
[31:15] the devil dear off of it you'll be able
[31:18] to grow all right I told you it happened
[31:21] thou Hast a few names even in Sardis
[31:23] which have not defiled their garments
[31:25] and they shall walk with me in white for
[31:27] they are worthy worth y he that
[31:28] overcometh shall be clothed in white
[31:30] rment see that that group of people
[31:33] coming out of the Dark Ages we can't we
[31:36] can't negate that they that they were a
[31:38] powerful church cuz anybody with the
[31:40] Holy Ghost is powerful but like I said
[31:41] before I'm trying to formulate a a
[31:44] sermon by the help of the Lord that'll
[31:46] show you why that you've got the Holy
[31:48] Ghost
[31:49] today it it feeds on the word for your
[31:52] day Martin Luther had the Holy Ghost
[31:55] Columba had the Holy Ghost for their day
[31:58] and it fed on what word they had all
[32:01] right but it it makes them different to
[32:03] a degree but remember the Holy Ghost is
[32:06] an individual a timid person brother
[32:08] Brown said right he's very timid so in
[32:12] other words if you're going to read the
[32:13] word a a different way come on Martin
[32:16] Luther read that just shall live by
[32:18] faith God said that's it but he moved
[32:21] over and said we're still going to
[32:22] baptize father Son and Holy Ghost we
[32:23] still believe in eternal hell now
[32:25] remember God don't move over that way
[32:29] that's man's ideas but he winked I thank
[32:32] God that brother brandham was a a
[32:33] southerner he said God winked at their
[32:35] ignorance like they're coming you know
[32:38] they they're my people and I'm going to
[32:39] read you a quote here in just a few
[32:40] minutes where brother Brown said God was
[32:42] happy with that age see we may not be
[32:45] happy with that age cuz they drank beer
[32:47] and they smoked the pipe and and Martin
[32:49] Luther caused some problems in his in
[32:51] his personal life and different things
[32:53] but he had a message to bring and then
[32:56] you and I know then now that the
[32:58] importance of the message that we have
[33:00] that he brought the fullness back though
[33:03] not not the not the in between not the
[33:05] reformers but he brought the alpha
[33:07] message back to us in the end
[33:13] time he that overcome the saint shall be
[33:15] clothed in white rment and I will not
[33:17] blot his name out of the book of life
[33:20] because you can have that done you know
[33:21] that but I will confess his name before
[33:23] my father and before his angels He that
[33:25] ha an ear let him hear what the spirit
[33:27] say the churches so we've coming out of
[33:30] the th tyan age which is the Dark Age it
[33:32] was 900 years of persecution and
[33:36] listen they set up a
[33:38] hierarchy they set up a hierarchy that
[33:40] was so strong that even Martin Luther
[33:43] got caught up in it he came out but
[33:45] remember and I didn't bring the quote
[33:47] brother Ry said that that he came out
[33:49] but he didn't come all the way out he
[33:50] tried to bring some of the things with
[33:52] him to from the Catholic Church into
[33:55] into what he was doing
[33:57] because he was a reformer now remember
[34:00] he reformed now listen when you reform
[34:03] somebody you send them to AA you send
[34:05] them to different place that's
[34:06] Reformation you try to reform them amen
[34:09] but restoration is get them with the
[34:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost in This day
[34:14] and time and they won't drink a drop of
[34:15] beer ever in their entire life I don't
[34:17] care if they've been a drunk ever since
[34:18] they was a baby all right so that's the
[34:21] difference in
[34:23] reformation and restoring or restoration
[34:27] all right
[34:28] he's restoring us back to the faith of
[34:30] the Fathers as we'll get to in the other
[34:33] Church in the church age that we're
[34:34] living in and we'll spend a pretty good
[34:36] bit of time in that in our church age
[34:38] kind of pulling apart what has been
[34:40] going on and most of you are living it
[34:42] today you're living this church age but
[34:46] remember we get all the blessings and
[34:47] the curses of the other one remember I
[34:49] read just quote not long ago where
[34:51] brother R said whatever evil was in that
[34:53] age it's going to be evil in this age it
[34:55] started out with woman worship over here
[34:57] with Dina in Ephesus and it comes up
[35:00] with this person right here in saara and
[35:02] it's going to actually end up in a
[35:05] building a church
[35:08] building the
[35:10] Vatican but she had daughters too but
[35:13] they're all
[35:14] dead we'll look at it just a second so
[35:17] the th age lasted
[35:19] 900 years and Columba wasn't even in
[35:22] that age so there was a group of people
[35:23] that took his message caught the
[35:25] Revelation and come on in and brought
[35:28] that message to a group of people wasn't
[35:30] a very big group of people but they were
[35:32] there and it was the ARX anointing which
[35:34] is
[35:35] laboring like I said continual sacrifice
[35:38] you sacri oxs were
[35:39] sacrificed so but the meaning of that
[35:41] thyre means dominating female so it
[35:43] begin to be that you look in the day and
[35:46] time that we're living in now it's
[35:48] pretty much controlled by women or it's
[35:51] controlled by a woman at woman's
[35:53] attitude or a woman's um uh brother
[35:56] Brown said it was a woman's Nation we
[35:57] were 13 you know 13 Nations so it's a
[36:00] woman's nation and why would we say that
[36:04] is because when we come under
[36:07] Reformation we see that you're reformed
[36:10] to a place
[36:12] but you continue to wear I'm not saying
[36:16] you but you continue to wear what the
[36:18] world wears you continue it you not come
[36:20] all the way out but see once you become
[36:23] fully restored once you receive the
[36:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost for your day
[36:27] you you quit wearing pants you'll quit
[36:29] you'll quit doing the things that you
[36:30] did before all right where we'll see
[36:32] here in a minute where he talking about
[36:34] works works is Faith expressed we know
[36:37] brother Brian preached that sermon and
[36:38] we'll read something he he said off of
[36:40] there but you got to remember that not
[36:42] only just works is not going to do it
[36:45] and not only is just Faith going to do
[36:48] it I'll show you my faith by my works
[36:52] all right I Know Thy works and charity
[36:56] and service and faith and patience and
[36:58] thy Works he says this four times says
[37:00] it three times then he says his works
[37:02] and the last be more than the first not
[37:05] with standing I have a few things
[37:06] against you they still suffered or they
[37:09] still allowed and that was our their
[37:12] problem and our problem we
[37:14] allow hello somebody we allow that's
[37:19] brother Bob was talking about conscience
[37:21] we allow that Spirit to come Among Us
[37:25] and if we don't get rid of it it
[37:27] captivates Ates us cuz what does a woman
[37:29] do a beautiful woman captivates you
[37:32] hello somebody John was at John was in
[37:34] The Book of Revelations and he saw that
[37:36] church that woman and he admired it
[37:38] right that means he looked on it and he
[37:41] thought man that's pretty but remember
[37:43] it was full of death we know that which
[37:47] calleth herself a prophetess to teach
[37:48] and seduce my servants to commit
[37:50] fornication and to eat things sacrificed
[37:53] un Idols I gave her space to repent look
[37:55] how many times it says repent I gave her
[37:58] space to repent and she repented not
[38:01] behold I will cast her into a bed and
[38:02] them that commit adultery with her into
[38:04] great Tri now this is God
[38:06] speaking all right this is God speaking
[38:09] this is red letter in your Bible if
[38:11] you'll read it this is this is Jesus
[38:13] Christ talking to John and John's
[38:15] writing it down all right so this is not
[38:17] hear say this is what God's going to do
[38:19] to this group of people all right I will
[38:22] cast her into a bed and them that commit
[38:24] adultery with her into Great Tribulation
[38:26] except they repent of their deeds and I
[38:29] will kill her children with death all
[38:33] right and all the churches cuz remember
[38:35] you get a child and thank god brother
[38:37] Anderson's in the back I guess he found
[38:40] that book CH kids are like wet cement
[38:43] kids are wet cement from Amazon and I
[38:45] got it the other day and I've been
[38:46] reading it you take a
[38:49] child and you formulate in that child
[38:52] you can formulate anything you want to
[38:53] just about it if you just keep
[38:55] bombarding with a certain thing right
[38:58] and they'll grow up being what the same
[39:00] thing remember brother BR said mama was
[39:02] a flapper come on down all the way H
[39:05] okay all right and I will kill her
[39:07] children with death cuz cuz God's not
[39:10] going to kill them physically he's going
[39:12] to kill them
[39:13] spiritually all right and then they're
[39:15] going to die the death and come up at
[39:17] the second resurrection and who the
[39:19] second death that's where you if you
[39:21] come up in the Resurrection the second
[39:22] Resurrection you got to stand before the
[39:24] white Throne
[39:26] judgment we don't want to do that we
[39:28] want to come up in the first
[39:29] resurrection we want to have the new
[39:31] birth we want to have the Holy Ghost in
[39:32] our soul and know that all right and
[39:35] then that works will show and all the
[39:38] church shall know that I am he which
[39:39] searches the Reigns and hearts I will
[39:41] give unto every one of you according to
[39:43] your works all right now watch but unto
[39:46] you I say unto the rest in thara as many
[39:48] as have not this Doctrine and which have
[39:50] not known the depths of Satan as they
[39:52] speak I will put upon you none other
[39:54] burden so he's not going to put any more
[39:56] on them but what is required and that's
[39:58] to get through that age be a Christian
[40:00] and get through that church age all
[40:02] right see you and I have a different
[40:07] burden you and I have a bigger burden we
[40:10] have a let's get out of here burden we
[40:13] have a let's get the Saints out of the
[40:14] ground burden we have a body change
[40:16] burden that they didn't have we do all
[40:19] right and that's our desire that that's
[40:21] our call in this church age is to come
[40:24] to Perfection they weren't required to
[40:26] come to per Perfection Martin Luther
[40:28] wasn't required to come to Perfection
[40:30] like we come to Perfection all right
[40:32] everybody with me but that which you
[40:34] have already hold fast till I
[40:36] come I was thinking this morning listen
[40:39] if it's just a thread hold on to it amen
[40:42] if it's just a thread of Hope hang on to
[40:44] it hang on to your kids as brother
[40:47] Donnie was praying hang on to them
[40:49] doesn't matter how far they go hang on
[40:51] to them all right live the life before
[40:56] him that'll probably help but that which
[40:59] you have already hold fast till I come
[41:02] and he that overcometh and keepeth look
[41:04] my works so now he's come to your Works
[41:07] your Works your Works my
[41:10] works until the end to him will I give
[41:13] power over the Nations and remember this
[41:15] age is the ox age it's an age of works
[41:18] and here's James 2:1 17 and I'm going to
[41:21] read you a quote brother BR that I
[41:22] hadn't read before and it's really
[41:24] outstanding it'll explain to you because
[41:26] there is not a fight in a message but
[41:28] there always been well works and Faith
[41:31] Works well I'm going to work work work
[41:33] work work don't have to have a whole
[41:34] they work together all right thank God
[41:37] for a prophet even so faith if it hath
[41:40] not works is
[41:41] dead being alone yeah a man may say thou
[41:45] Hast faith and I have Works show me thy
[41:47] faith without thy works and I will show
[41:49] thee my faith by my works there's no way
[41:52] for you to have faith in God and not
[41:54] show works right that's right totally
[41:58] different than the works that you showed
[42:00] out there in the world cuz they show
[42:02] works out there too you
[42:04] know for as the body without the spirit
[42:06] is dead so faith without works is dead
[42:11] also brother BR says here says I Know
[42:14] Thy works the Son of God himself believe
[42:16] me for the very Works he put an emphasis
[42:18] on his own Works while on Earth The
[42:20] Works that he did were ordained of God
[42:21] to inspire faith in him it was a great
[42:24] part of his ministry His Holy Spirit and
[42:26] the apostle Paul said for we are his
[42:28] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[42:31] what good works but now it's created by
[42:35] the workmanship that you're in Christ
[42:37] Jesus is why you come to that good works
[42:40] CU really it's not your works anymore if
[42:42] you have faith if you have truly the
[42:45] faith of God it's not your
[42:47] works it's God working through
[42:50] you working his Works through you that
[42:54] that's a revelation is his Works you're
[42:56] you're not well bless no you're going to
[42:58] do it because of the works that the
[43:02] Bible has already written you're just
[43:05] taking it out and making it live that's
[43:08] what you're
[43:09] doing now look created in Christ Jesus
[43:12] unto good works which God hath ordained
[43:15] that we should walk in them so it's
[43:16] ordained by God that we walk in them
[43:18] that we show Works Ephesians
[43:20] 2:1 these Works were to inspire faith in
[43:23] him as they would show forth that
[43:25] relationship to him that Paul described
[43:28] as created in him in this verse he is
[43:31] commending his children because they
[43:32] were living changed lives their Works
[43:35] testify to a new spirit within does
[43:40] yours does your Works testify to a new
[43:43] spirit within men saw their good works
[43:46] and glorified God yes sir if you are a
[43:48] Christian you're going to do what is
[43:50] right like brother Bob was talking about
[43:53] conscience you may do something wrong
[43:56] but quickly
[43:57] quickly oh God that was that was me that
[44:01] that was me that wasn't that I got
[44:05] caught oh go ahead and get silent I'll
[44:07] just preach on me
[44:12] today your Works will show that your
[44:14] heart is right and it won't be something
[44:17] that you put on for you will do his will
[44:19] when no one but God sees you and you
[44:21] will do his will even if it cost you
[44:24] your life amen now here's around the
[44:27] quote that I wanted to read and I want
[44:28] to bring these two together now the two
[44:31] men that were talking on faith is
[44:35] Paul all right cuz he talks about unmar
[44:38] favor he talks about Abraham all right
[44:42] believe God and it was imputed unto him
[44:44] for righteousness all right so I'm going
[44:45] to back up just a second M James
[44:48] testified though Abraham by what man saw
[44:52] in Abraham he produced a child he walked
[44:55] with God he had God around him all the
[44:57] time Paul Justified Abraham by what God
[45:00] saw in Abraham see that's why Paul's a
[45:03] prophet Paul was a prophet that could
[45:05] look and see and and know that that he
[45:08] picks up the mind of God that you and I
[45:09] are the same way we're
[45:14] justified by what what by what God saw
[45:18] but when we're Justified and Sanctified
[45:20] filled with the Holy Ghost man's going
[45:21] to be able to see
[45:22] that if people can't see a change in
[45:25] your life
[45:27] right you need to get the Holy
[45:30] Ghost now see now James says he's
[45:33] justified by his Works Paul said he's
[45:35] justified by faith but see Abraham
[45:38] believed God that's what God saw in him
[45:43] all right put your name in there it's
[45:45] not Abraham anymore okay don't he
[45:49] believe God that's what God saw in him
[45:52] he believed it but then when he went to
[45:55] acting as it were already done that's
[45:58] what man saw in him all
[46:01] right people around Abraham thought he
[46:04] was crazy he was 100 years old we're
[46:06] going to have a kid any any moment
[46:09] now but one day he walked out of that
[46:12] tent with a baby in his hand now let me
[46:15] tell you something that's the the
[46:17] culmination that's his faith was
[46:20] expressed by that work that he brought
[46:23] out that baby same way with me and you
[46:26] does your words exp express your faith
[46:29] your
[46:30] works right that's why we come to church
[46:33] I know it's hard hard to get
[46:38] up but it's what you do as a Christian I
[46:40] wouldn't want to do anything
[46:42] else there was no option some people
[46:45] have options on Sunday well I don't have
[46:48] an option on Sunday we don't have an
[46:50] option on Sunday you can if you want to
[46:53] but I you know I just
[46:57] you know we'll come to church and I'll
[46:59] preach when I
[47:00] can and uh see you later uh I think I'll
[47:04] just stop right now it's time to go home
[47:05] I need to go to the
[47:10] bathroom and if I fell asleep it'd
[47:13] really be it' really be something
[47:14] wouldn't
[47:16] it where was I because our works Express
[47:19] what faith we have now watch a prophet
[47:22] our wordss Express what faith we have
[47:25] not Faith we're getting
[47:27] faith that we have all right but if
[47:30] we're afraid to act on what we
[47:33] believe then we don't believe it that's
[47:35] right that's what I want to bring you
[47:37] right there if we are afraid to act on
[47:40] what we
[47:42] believe then we don't believe
[47:45] it see you got to believe
[47:49] it all
[47:51] right he said I Know Thy works and the
[47:53] last to be more than the first this is
[47:55] certainly remarkable as the darkness of
[47:57] the age increased as the honor rooll of
[47:59] the martyrs grew lengthier day by day
[48:02] they worked all the harder they served
[48:04] all the more as I was telling you before
[48:06] that's
[48:07] strange I have a tooth a lord now make
[48:10] two of them
[48:13] hurt y'all don't pray that
[48:16] right okay well as they were more
[48:22] persecuted they said pour it
[48:25] on they worked
[48:27] harder look they worked all the harder
[48:30] they served all the more and their faith
[48:33] increased amen that's the key for me and
[48:36] you our faith has got to increase it
[48:38] cannot Wan or it cannot get weaker if it
[48:42] gets weaker let's go back to the other
[48:44] quote you don't believe
[48:46] it go back and start to working on the
[48:49] believing
[48:50] part they worked all the harder they
[48:52] served all the more and their faith
[48:54] increased let the enemy attempt to
[48:56] thwart our service to the Lord our reply
[48:59] is increased
[49:01] service right when the faint are crying
[49:05] in fear that is the time to shout the
[49:08] victory that's totally contrary to your
[49:10] nature though totally contrary to the
[49:12] human nature is is to say pour it on I
[49:15] heard give me
[49:16] two amen but I thought we were supposed
[49:19] to
[49:20] overcome and it's not what it's how we
[49:23] overcome by what believing and having
[49:26] faith just like Abraham well I don't see
[49:28] nothing Abraham didn't say God I don't
[49:30] see
[49:32] nothing he just kept walking just kept
[49:35] walking kept walking and look to the
[49:38] world or to the let's just put it this
[49:40] way to the doctors it looked more
[49:42] impossible every day he went further
[49:45] from the 75 years old that he did have a
[49:47] kid by everybody with me he did have him
[49:50] and Hagar did have a child so at 70
[49:52] something years old so he could produce
[49:55] but now he had to keep getting f and
[49:56] further away from that to where he can
[49:58] say God I'm
[50:00] dead I can't do it no more and God said
[50:03] that's exactly where I wanted you at
[50:05] that's the same way with me and you he
[50:07] wants us
[50:08] dead too much eye going
[50:11] on brother R said look I want to give a
[50:14] warning right here it says concerning
[50:16] the last days that because of abounding
[50:18] iniquity the love of many will wax cold
[50:22] and the layout to see in her last days
[50:24] selflove and love for material things
[50:27] will take the place of the true love of
[50:28] God we need to guard against the power
[50:30] of sin in these last days so many are
[50:33] getting so hard because they haven't
[50:34] realize the effects of this last day
[50:36] Spirit that's why we preach so hard
[50:38] about spirits and and all these
[50:40] different things about even the little
[50:42] foxes this SP Divine it's the little
[50:44] things that we have to deal with it's
[50:46] time to draw nigh to God and let him
[50:47] fill our lives with his love or we will
[50:49] F the coldness of the last day church
[50:53] and reject the truth of God which alone
[50:56] is able to help us as we said many times
[50:59] many times many times before when you
[51:00] get in
[51:01] trouble you
[51:03] disappear this is the place you should
[51:05] be you show me another place you should
[51:09] be home having a py
[51:13] party right home having a pity party oh
[51:18] whoo is
[51:19] me me me
[51:23] me okay we'll get off of that bless let
[51:26] try to reverse this thing let's try to
[51:28] reverse it if we start if we start
[51:30] feeling
[51:31] bad and and we think that
[51:34] remember as I said the quote I read to
[51:37] you Sunday or Wednesday I think it was
[51:40] where the man said look he said I have
[51:43] given God a million reasons to hate
[51:47] me and he still ain't changed his mind
[51:49] about
[51:50] me that's pretty cool cuz God remember
[51:54] God can't change his mind all
[51:57] right let's just start realizing we're
[51:59] in the mind of God we are the mind of
[52:02] God we're a piece of God's mind that
[52:03] back part that brother R was talking
[52:05] about so this church age is is just full
[52:08] of church everything's everybody's going
[52:10] to these big Cathedrals now they got
[52:12] these great big um um Mo mosque and all
[52:16] those different things that that man has
[52:18] built they put church and state together
[52:21] and the female is starting to dominate
[52:22] or the church is starting to dominate
[52:24] not the true church false church right
[52:26] all right it started in Ephesus as Diana
[52:29] worship of a woman thara was the
[52:31] prophetess on a three-legged stool and
[52:34] then our age is the great and her
[52:35] daughters and we'll get to that as we go
[52:37] a little bit further cuz
[52:41] remember why did he say come out of her
[52:44] my
[52:45] people her the church the church ideas
[52:50] come out of her my people not come out
[52:53] not he didn't even say come out of the
[52:55] world he said come out of her he pointed
[52:58] exactly where to come out of come out of
[53:01] that and I will kill her children with
[53:04] death and all the churches shall know
[53:05] that I am he which searches the Reigns
[53:07] and hearts and I will give unto every
[53:09] one of you according to your Works 1
[53:12] Timothy 5:6 but she that liveth in
[53:16] she she back to the church again but she
[53:20] that liveth in pleasure is dead while
[53:22] she liveth and listen we appreciate all
[53:25] the programs and all the things things
[53:27] that that the Baptist do and the
[53:30] Methodist and Pentecostals and all that
[53:31] but remember if they don't come back to
[53:33] the true word of God that's all God's
[53:35] worried
[53:35] about
[53:37] am it's his word amen all right his word
[53:41] will not return void somebody will take
[53:43] it and somebody will produce what the
[53:45] word amen not produce bigger churches
[53:49] not produce you know programs and and
[53:52] all this stuff that and we appreciate
[53:55] them doing that the food F Banks and all
[53:57] those different things and as Regina
[53:59] said taking the taking the clothes to
[54:00] the homeless I mean that's and that's a
[54:02] Ministry people need
[54:06] help but where do you first need help
[54:09] at right
[54:12] here and that's your house right here's
[54:15] where you need help
[54:17] first June always says and I appreciate
[54:21] every time we get on a plane I start
[54:24] chuckling the when they tell you that
[54:26] you're losing cabin pressure and this
[54:28] oxygen thing's going to fall down out of
[54:30] the sky and you better really start
[54:32] praying when that thing falls out you
[54:35] when that thing falls out what do they
[54:37] tell you to do put yours on
[54:41] first not your neighbors put your mask
[54:45] on first cuz without your mask you can't
[54:48] help your neighbor hello somebody so
[54:50] without the new birth and without
[54:52] Shoring yourself up and getting your
[54:54] oxygen right you're not going to be able
[54:57] to help you'll pass
[54:59] out and then you're both going to pass
[55:01] out and
[55:03] die it's a good analogy CU if you look
[55:06] at and and and when you counsel people
[55:10] you you look at the different things and
[55:13] and they
[55:14] always well if my if my aunt suie was
[55:18] good I'd be good if if if my mama quit
[55:21] being so mean to me it's always pushing
[55:24] it outward
[55:27] put your mask on
[55:29] first if you want to have a successful
[55:31] marriage put your mask on
[55:34] first start working on
[55:38] you
[55:44] finger
[55:47] amen that's right Regina you are the
[55:50] problem you are your own problem
[55:54] though but she that liveth in pleasure
[55:56] look at the world they got everything in
[55:59] the world now that you to pleasure
[56:01] yourself with I mean games and you can
[56:03] you can be sitting somewhere and playing
[56:05] video games and you can be sitting on
[56:07] the internet there all the different
[56:08] things that that just blows your mind up
[56:10] with all this information and we got
[56:12] Google and we got Yahoo and we got all
[56:14] these different things that we can look
[56:16] up stuff and and I enjoy it because I
[56:18] like to go into Wikipedia and look at
[56:20] some of like I did with Martin Luther
[56:22] and do some research you can really use
[56:25] Satan's tool if you'll use it right
[56:27] everybody with me you can use that
[56:29] technology if you use it right you can
[56:30] get some good information and it's
[56:32] pretty quick but remember all that
[56:34] pleasuring that's going on out in the
[56:36] world is
[56:37] dead it's dead and you know what dead
[56:41] means let me show you what dead means
[56:44] and I'll get back to it it's a
[56:46] separation or that separation whether
[56:49] natural or violent of the soul and the
[56:51] body by which the life on Earth is
[56:54] ended that's why you're dead while you
[56:57] living if you're not born again your
[57:00] life you may be breathing you may be
[57:02] sucking air you may be thinking
[57:05] right you may be acting you or doing
[57:08] something but you're
[57:11] dead and I hate to see that I hate to
[57:14] say that but all the preachers that are
[57:16] not preaching the true word of God
[57:17] they're dead
[57:19] amen right you can amen if you want to
[57:22] but that's what brother Ram he condemned
[57:23] that whole system out there and I want
[57:26] to bring it back in there out
[57:28] here condemn everything that's
[57:35] off but remember condemn it with Grace
[57:40] yes cuz you were condemned at one time
[57:43] yourself I was reading some quotes back
[57:46] here where brother Brown and I know he
[57:47] said it he said it about three times he
[57:49] said my whole makeup is
[57:51] Grace my whole makeup is Grace you St
[57:56] brother Rand a man he just cut their
[57:58] heads off and sliced them up and spit
[58:00] them out but it was Grace it was Grace
[58:02] to the people that God come to me and
[58:04] you and said hey I got a message
[58:07] here I'm in a I I'm in a I'm in a pickle
[58:11] here and God says uh I'm going to change
[58:13] your cucumber into a pickle I'm going to
[58:17] take you pickle and make a pickle out of
[58:18] you remember what the pickling process
[58:20] is baptismo baptismo it makes you a
[58:23] pickle can't be a cucumber you may look
[58:25] like one but you're not going to taste
[58:27] like one or you're not going to act like
[58:29] one all right so what will be the
[58:31] punishment of the Harlot and her
[58:32] children now watch the Harlot and her
[58:34] children so it's going to be
[58:38] people that get put in hell it's not
[58:41] buildings right okay first he said I
[58:45] will cast her into a bed according to
[58:46] the last part of verse 22 it will be a
[58:48] bed of tribulation or or the Great
[58:50] Tribulation that is what will come upon
[58:52] the Harlot and her daughters secondly it
[58:55] says says that he will kill them excuse
[58:58] me with death or as a literal
[59:00] translation says let them be put to
[59:03] death with death and we're going to
[59:05] explain that just a second we did before
[59:07] we're going to back up explain it just
[59:08] for a minute this is a strange saying we
[59:11] might say let a man be put to death by
[59:13] hanging or by elocution or some other
[59:16] way but this says let them be put to
[59:18] death by death death itself is the cause
[59:22] of their
[59:23] death cuz they're dead while they're
[59:26] living listen you and I were born
[59:29] dead death reigned I'm quoting scripture
[59:32] death rained in our
[59:34] members naturally and physically if the
[59:37] Rapture don't take place we're going to
[59:39] die naturally but that's just this thing
[59:42] going
[59:43] away if we die out and take Christ then
[59:47] we don't have to die again we may fall
[59:50] asleep in this right but we're alive in
[59:53] Jesus Christ we're alive in that sixth
[59:55] dimension More Alive now than ever
[59:58] before we just don't realize that
[1:00:02] though we want to hang on sure because
[1:00:05] we have a threat of Hope or we have
[1:00:07] humanity is in our heart for the people
[1:00:10] but my if somebody's suffering like you
[1:00:12] wouldn't believe it's better to let them
[1:00:15] go let them go and go over in that
[1:00:17] another dimension and and hide away from
[1:00:19] the the world and hide away from uh
[1:00:22] arthritis and cancer and all listen
[1:00:25] there ain't no cancer in the sixth
[1:00:26] Dimension there ain't no diabetes in the
[1:00:28] sixth Dimension it all stays
[1:00:31] here devil you're stand here you can't
[1:00:36] even crawl around in that sixth
[1:00:37] Dimension you can't even get your hands
[1:00:39] on anybody in that sixth Dimension
[1:00:41] that's how much God really believes that
[1:00:43] he is going to do it through
[1:00:46] you and when they come back here you
[1:00:48] think a look on the devil's
[1:00:51] face oh I I I put them in the ground I
[1:00:54] give them cancer and I give them
[1:00:56] diabetes and heart attacks and and
[1:01:00] they're gone I I don't know where
[1:01:01] they're at that their body's laying here
[1:01:03] in the grave I see that but I can't find
[1:01:05] their soul you know why cuz it's in the
[1:01:07] six
[1:01:08] Dimension but they're going to
[1:01:10] absolutely come out of that sixth
[1:01:12] Dimension and they're going to walk into
[1:01:13] this
[1:01:15] one and they going to pick up their body
[1:01:18] that the devil
[1:01:19] killed hello
[1:01:22] somebody and then the devil's going to
[1:01:24] have a real bad look on his face he's
[1:01:27] going to say how did that
[1:01:28] happen well it happened for me and you
[1:01:32] it happened for us believing and having
[1:01:35] faith in what we've already got and then
[1:01:37] build on that Faith like they did in
[1:01:39] that fourth dimension keep building on
[1:01:41] that Faith keep building on that Faith
[1:01:43] because remember there was a there was
[1:01:46] come on there was a new birth coming
[1:01:48] right that that fourth dimension we're
[1:01:50] talking about it had to die it had to go
[1:01:53] in the ground amen according to the
[1:01:55] Bible the corn of wheat had to go in the
[1:01:57] ground the word had to go in the ground
[1:02:00] but it had life in it pra and even if
[1:02:03] it's just two shoot that without them
[1:02:05] you cut them off you don't get no
[1:02:08] corn but then it goes to the stock those
[1:02:11] two shoots die come to the stock stock
[1:02:14] has a tassel every bit of it comes from
[1:02:16] that life it's in that one
[1:02:18] seed you watch that corn man that corn
[1:02:20] is it's wrapped up it's in that thing it
[1:02:23] goes up you know it's got the leaves
[1:02:24] that go off like this and you'll watch
[1:02:26] it if you watch it you know a day or two
[1:02:28] you'll see it doing
[1:02:30] this it don't get it from somewhere else
[1:02:33] it get it from the life is down in the
[1:02:35] roots from that Original
[1:02:38] Seed and then it opens up like this and
[1:02:42] then you see a ear of corn coming out
[1:02:43] like this real
[1:02:45] small don't want to eat it then can't
[1:02:48] plant it either but once that pollen
[1:02:51] comes down and hits that hits those do
[1:02:54] you know why there's a Shu the shook
[1:02:57] protects the corn right but you know the
[1:02:59] tassel that comes out that stuff that
[1:03:00] comes out that you have to scrape off
[1:03:03] every one of them is connected to one
[1:03:06] seed in that corn
[1:03:08] kernel every one of them so they've got
[1:03:12] to be pollinated to grow I hope
[1:03:15] somebody's getting something out of that
[1:03:18] they got to be pollinated by the word of
[1:03:20] God to grow if you listen if you don't
[1:03:23] for some reason that it that it's hid
[1:03:25] and and the um and I meant to tell D
[1:03:28] that you got to leave a room enough to
[1:03:29] where the wind will blow that will blow
[1:03:32] that uh
[1:03:34] tassel it'll blow it on to that U corn
[1:03:38] and when the thing's hanging off like
[1:03:40] this it's got to attach itself to it but
[1:03:43] if you put it in a different situation
[1:03:45] that's why you get ears of corn it don't
[1:03:46] have like you whole one side don't have
[1:03:48] any right you've seen them before and
[1:03:51] they're all not fully developed somebody
[1:03:53] with me with this I hope you get the
[1:03:55] spiritual part of this okay you're not
[1:03:57] fully developed okay and you look kind
[1:04:00] of ugly okay so that's why because you
[1:04:04] didn't get truly correctly
[1:04:10] pollinated go back and read the spoken
[1:04:12] words Original Seed and you'll get all
[1:04:13] that the minute the First Church of Rome
[1:04:16] organized it died the minute that the
[1:04:19] Lutheran organized death came in and
[1:04:22] they died the Pentecostals came along
[1:04:25] last and they organized the spirit left
[1:04:28] though they don't believe it oh they
[1:04:30] were sitting right there while he was
[1:04:31] preaching it but he did that marriage
[1:04:35] brought death then the light of the
[1:04:37] Oneness of the godhead came they
[1:04:38] organized they died too then after the
[1:04:41] fire of God fell on Ohio oh he's talking
[1:04:42] about himself now after the fire of God
[1:04:45] fell on Ohio River 1933 a healing
[1:04:47] Revival swept the world but it's never
[1:04:49] come through any organization God went
[1:04:52] outside the Pentecostal group outside of
[1:04:54] organization
[1:04:56] and what he's going to do in the future
[1:04:57] is going to be outside organization
[1:04:59] because remember it's got to be the
[1:05:00] alpha bride it's got to be the same as
[1:05:02] Omega so the alpha bride came out from
[1:05:04] they had no organization Paul had to
[1:05:06] come out of Pharisees Sadducees he had
[1:05:10] to come out of that cuz he was a
[1:05:12] Pharisee of the Pharisees said he had to
[1:05:13] come out of that forget everything and
[1:05:16] then what go on with his message well
[1:05:18] same thing with brother randam he had to
[1:05:19] come out of that church he was in the
[1:05:21] Baptist then he come to the Pentecostal
[1:05:24] people who accepted him for a Time until
[1:05:26] he start talking about
[1:05:27] them God can't work through the
[1:05:31] dead he can only work through the living
[1:05:34] members those living members are outside
[1:05:36] of Babylon the world so you see death
[1:05:40] organization came and the church died or
[1:05:43] to make it pler death became a resident
[1:05:47] wherein shortly before only life
[1:05:50] reigned as the original Eve brought
[1:05:53] death to mankind so now organization has
[1:05:55] brought death for organization is the
[1:05:58] product of the double corruptors nanism
[1:06:01] and bism propagated by a propheus
[1:06:05] jezebel so there's a your definition of
[1:06:09] death that separation natural violent of
[1:06:12] the soul and the body by which the life
[1:06:14] on Earth is ended now that's the way we
[1:06:16] see death if some we say somebody's
[1:06:18] passed away or died which means that
[1:06:20] there's a shell there and the Soul's
[1:06:23] gone right all right but now what about
[1:06:26] being dead though while you're living
[1:06:28] while you're still breathing while
[1:06:30] you're still standing up while you're
[1:06:32] still going to
[1:06:34] church you have no life in you so if you
[1:06:37] have no life in you there's a separation
[1:06:39] and your life on Earth is
[1:06:42] ended even though you have
[1:06:45] pleasure you're dead while you're
[1:06:51] living Matthew 6: 211 say therefore
[1:06:54] where your treasure is there will heart
[1:06:55] be also the Light of the body is the eye
[1:06:58] if therefore thine eye be single thy
[1:07:00] whole body shall be full of light but if
[1:07:03] thine eye be evil thy whole body shall
[1:07:06] be full of Darkness if therefore the
[1:07:09] light that is in thee be
[1:07:12] Darkness how
[1:07:13] great is that Darkness or how great is
[1:07:16] that
[1:07:18] death so under the law we were talking
[1:07:20] about the other day real quick under the
[1:07:22] law in Exodus and all the different ones
[1:07:24] Leviticus listen if you did something
[1:07:26] you didn't go to court you
[1:07:29] died okay keep Sabbath
[1:07:33] day some people wouldn't live in the
[1:07:35] message very
[1:07:38] long everyone that defileth it in other
[1:07:40] words don't come to church shall surely
[1:07:42] be put to death for whosoever doeth any
[1:07:45] work therein that Soul shall be cut off
[1:07:47] from among his people that's how
[1:07:48] reverent they were under the
[1:07:52] law six days May word be done but in the
[1:07:54] seventh is the Sabbath of rest holy to
[1:07:56] the Lord whosoever doeth any work in the
[1:07:58] in the Sabbath day he shall surely be
[1:08:01] put to death natural death I'm talking
[1:08:03] about Soul separated from the body
[1:08:06] usually it was by stoning which was very
[1:08:09] horrible cuz it wasn't a quick
[1:08:11] death Proverbs
[1:08:14] 14:1 The House of the wicked shall be
[1:08:16] overthrown but the Tabernacle of the up
[1:08:18] upright that us the Tabernacle of the
[1:08:20] upright shall flourish there is a way
[1:08:23] which seeth right unto man everybody
[1:08:25] that goes to church today wherever
[1:08:27] Church they're going to thinks they're
[1:08:32] right thinks they sitting in the right
[1:08:34] place they they everything's cool and
[1:08:36] we're good and XYZ well we're fine but
[1:08:41] the end thereof are the ways of
[1:08:44] death and listen folks you ain't got to
[1:08:47] sit in a Baptist Church to die you can
[1:08:48] sit in a message church and die you can
[1:08:51] actually die quicker because there's the
[1:08:53] death by Death
[1:08:55] everybody with me put you to death by
[1:08:58] the death that comes inside of
[1:09:01] you but now we got here now we're over
[1:09:03] into the New Testament and Jesus tells
[1:09:05] us if a man keeps my saying he shall
[1:09:08] never see death and then the Jews said
[1:09:11] now we know you got a devil you're
[1:09:13] speaking really something we don't
[1:09:16] understand Abraham is dead and the
[1:09:18] prophets and thou sayest if a man keep
[1:09:19] my sayings he shall never taste of death
[1:09:22] what was Jesus telling
[1:09:23] them die here get born again
[1:09:28] here you get born again here you'll
[1:09:30] never see the second
[1:09:32] death amen that's the one you better
[1:09:35] worry
[1:09:38] about now Paul walks up and he says look
[1:09:41] I
[1:09:41] persecuted this way unto the death he
[1:09:44] caused people to blaspheme he caused
[1:09:46] people to die by what he said now listen
[1:09:49] you talk about Grace cuz if he would
[1:09:51] have been under the
[1:09:53] law well he was under the law but look
[1:09:56] what he done to the law he perverted it
[1:09:58] turned it around cuz remember he said
[1:10:00] one time he said what I thought was life
[1:10:02] is now death amen all right what I
[1:10:05] thought was life the light in me that I
[1:10:07] thought was light has now become
[1:10:10] Darkness cuz in Romans 6:8 said now if
[1:10:13] we be dead with Christ we believe that
[1:10:14] we shall also live with him knowing that
[1:10:16] Christ being raised from the dead dieth
[1:10:18] no more death hath no more dominion over
[1:10:22] him listen death the separation of soul
[1:10:25] and body should have no dominion over
[1:10:30] you but we still
[1:10:33] do I mean who of you today would say
[1:10:36] okay if I got to die I'll die right
[1:10:38] now nobody's going to do that right but
[1:10:42] you ought to be able to you ought to be
[1:10:45] able to not scar be not scared of it
[1:10:47] right right if you are then let's go
[1:10:50] back to the believing let's go back and
[1:10:51] read the quotes in the scripture back
[1:10:53] over here that you need to start
[1:10:54] believing that what you got is going to
[1:10:57] be greater than
[1:10:58] death for in that he died he died under
[1:11:01] sin once but in that he liveth he liveth
[1:11:03] under God likewise now he's talking
[1:11:05] about us now likewise reckon you also
[1:11:07] yourselves to be dead indeed under sin
[1:11:11] but alive unto God through Jesus Christ
[1:11:13] Our Lord that's the alive we want to see
[1:11:15] and that's the dead we want to see we
[1:11:18] want to be dead
[1:11:20] Christians dead and
[1:11:23] Christians let not sin therefore reign
[1:11:26] in your mortal body that you should obey
[1:11:27] it in the lust thereof neither yield you
[1:11:30] your members as instruments of
[1:11:31] unrighteousness Unto sin but yield
[1:11:33] yourself unto God as those that are
[1:11:36] alive from the dead and your members as
[1:11:39] instruments of righteousness unto God
[1:11:41] for sin shall not have dominion over you
[1:11:44] who believes
[1:11:48] that if you look at
[1:11:51] job job was not a bride he wasn't bride
[1:11:55] material right that's right he didn't
[1:11:58] have a new birth in his soul
[1:12:01] right but God said okay Satan you do
[1:12:04] whatever you want to do but don't touch
[1:12:06] his soul his soul stays in his body you
[1:12:09] can do whatever you want to to his body
[1:12:11] but you can't you can't kill it
[1:12:14] right but go ahead and you see what
[1:12:18] happened I think Satan still scratching
[1:12:20] his head just over job for sin shall not
[1:12:23] have dominion over you for you are not
[1:12:24] under under the law now look under the
[1:12:26] law you're now under
[1:12:28] grace What then shall we sin because we
[1:12:30] are not under the law now that's what I
[1:12:33] said before there is no Greece in
[1:12:36] Grace no Greece none at all but grace is
[1:12:40] sufficient there is a thing called
[1:12:42] Grace or it wouldn't be here several
[1:12:45] hundred times and brother B wouldn't say
[1:12:46] that my whole makeup is Grace What then
[1:12:48] shall we sin because we are not under
[1:12:50] the law but under grace in other words
[1:12:52] the law says you got to go to church or
[1:12:54] you die well under
[1:12:57] grace you still got to come to church
[1:12:59] but they're not going to take you out
[1:13:00] and kill you you're going to die
[1:13:02] spiritually anyway if you don't start if
[1:13:04] you don't come to
[1:13:05] church I'm going to amen that anyway
[1:13:08] because it's the
[1:13:10] truth know you not that to whom you
[1:13:12] yield yourself servants to obey his
[1:13:15] servants ye are to whom you obey whether
[1:13:19] of sin under death or of
[1:13:21] obedience under righteousness Romans 6
[1:13:25] verse 21 say what fruit had ye then in
[1:13:28] those things where you now ashamed for
[1:13:30] the end of those things is death in
[1:13:31] other words what's fruitful to you now
[1:13:33] that if you like to go to the Beer Joint
[1:13:35] if you like to go to the the different
[1:13:37] things in the world what fruit is that
[1:13:39] that you should be ashamed of
[1:13:42] that you should be ashamed of those
[1:13:44] things you did and we are
[1:13:46] ashamed for the end of those things is
[1:13:49] death but now being made free from sin
[1:13:53] and become servants to God you have your
[1:13:56] fruit under Holiness and the end
[1:13:58] everlasting life for the wages of sin is
[1:14:01] death but the gift of God is eternal
[1:14:03] life through Jesus Christ Our Lord and
[1:14:05] we know that sin is not smoking drinking
[1:14:08] cussing sin is unbelief it's it's go
[1:14:10] back over here you got to start
[1:14:13] believing believe who you are you say
[1:14:16] well I don't feel it now I nobody said a
[1:14:18] word about you feeling
[1:14:20] it but now
[1:14:22] remember if you take a stand right here
[1:14:25] your works is going to produce what
[1:14:26] you're standing on all right your works
[1:14:29] is going to produce it you can't go off
[1:14:32] somewhere like he said he said can we
[1:14:34] now this is what Paul's saying Paul's
[1:14:36] saying well now you're telling us we're
[1:14:37] not under the law so we can sin anytime
[1:14:40] we want
[1:14:41] to that's what he was saying he said God
[1:14:44] forbid God forbid you can't do that
[1:14:48] that's your whole totally terrible
[1:14:50] attitude you can't do that you got to
[1:14:52] come under righteousness and as Bob said
[1:14:54] you you got to have a conscience now
[1:14:56] your conscious listen I want to tell you
[1:14:58] something real quick I'm going to stop
[1:14:59] right here we'll get to it next
[1:15:03] week I've been to a couple of
[1:15:06] battlefields um never been to get his
[1:15:08] bird but you go to these battlefields
[1:15:10] now you come on in different ones it's
[1:15:12] so
[1:15:14] pristine it's so beautiful you can see
[1:15:17] the bull works or you can see the
[1:15:19] trenches that they trenched out and the
[1:15:21] little bitty cannons them ain't real the
[1:15:23] little bitty cannons
[1:15:25] and you can listen to the guy tell you
[1:15:28] that so and so was over here if you want
[1:15:29] to know ask George Quinn he'll tell you
[1:15:31] everything about the Civil War they'll
[1:15:33] tell you ever where they were supposed
[1:15:34] to be or should have been or was way
[1:15:37] more than I ever knew about it but you
[1:15:40] can see all that and it looks so pretty
[1:15:42] right they've got the grass growing up
[1:15:43] and they've got it you know at
[1:15:45] Gettysburg they say they got all the
[1:15:46] monuments and they got the hedges around
[1:15:48] it and they got everything trimmed up
[1:15:50] that's not the way it
[1:15:53] looked no at one point in time there
[1:15:56] were holes in that ground at one point
[1:15:59] in time there was men's guts on that
[1:16:01] ground there was men's blood there was
[1:16:04] awful cannons and there was awful guns
[1:16:06] and when the battle was over if you look
[1:16:08] at some of the pictures the trees where
[1:16:10] they shot so many cannons the trees have
[1:16:12] fell
[1:16:13] over they broken limbs look on look
[1:16:17] online and you'll see after the battle
[1:16:20] look what's going
[1:16:21] on well that's the way I want us to be I
[1:16:24] don't want to us to see the pristine
[1:16:26] part yet though because remember brother
[1:16:28] R told us he said that the greatest
[1:16:31] battle ever been fought is in your
[1:16:34] mind is
[1:16:37] Satan bombarding you with his
[1:16:40] doctrines God is still bombarding you
[1:16:43] with his cuz it's a Battleground it was
[1:16:46] two opposing forces everywhere there's a
[1:16:49] Battleground it wasn't Confederate
[1:16:51] fighting Confederate or or or Americans
[1:16:54] F or you know North fighting to North it
[1:16:57] was two opposing ideas came together to
[1:17:01] one place and didn't make it pretty
[1:17:04] right they made it
[1:17:06] ugly I I can't remember there was uh
[1:17:10] 20,000 men di to get hisb or something
[1:17:13] it was a huge amount talk about people
[1:17:15] just laying
[1:17:17] dead in all forms of deadness you know
[1:17:19] understand what I mean but see that was
[1:17:21] a battlefield that's what I want I don't
[1:17:23] want us to see we going to get to pretin
[1:17:26] part we're going to get the part to
[1:17:28] where say hey that was a
[1:17:30] battle that was a battle when on right
[1:17:33] here but look I've
[1:17:35] overcome I won that battle and now I'm
[1:17:37] standing on my ground I'm standing in a
[1:17:41] pristine place that's beautiful it's
[1:17:43] called Christianity it's called going to
[1:17:45] heaven but the greatest battle ever
[1:17:47] fought is
[1:17:49] ugly it's in your mind right now some
[1:17:52] are saying shut up some are saying keep
[1:17:54] going
[1:17:57] believe it
[1:18:02] will but we don't want to be caught up
[1:18:05] in look what was on that Battlefield
[1:18:09] life at first it
[1:18:11] was but when it was over the only thing
[1:18:15] left lay on the ground was dead men dead
[1:18:19] horses amen after that battle was over
[1:18:23] there was just nothing but AG laying in
[1:18:25] those
[1:18:26] fields that
[1:18:30] death is a separation of the soul and
[1:18:32] the
[1:18:33] body all right but what about your
[1:18:37] Battlefield what's dying in you right
[1:18:41] what you going to leave on the
[1:18:42] battlefield
[1:18:44] today what are you going to leave out
[1:18:46] there I hope you
[1:18:49] leave the defeated
[1:18:53] one and become the ones that take over
[1:18:56] the
[1:18:58] field and it's only by Jesus Christ
[1:19:00] because if you're
[1:19:02] not now you take these an analogy here
[1:19:05] death by death so if you take some of
[1:19:06] those soldiers that are just they were
[1:19:08] ranked Sinners they died two deaths that
[1:19:11] day they died
[1:19:13] naturally and then they didn't die die
[1:19:16] spiritually their Spirit went over into
[1:19:18] or soul went over in another place and
[1:19:19] it's going to have to die that's the
[1:19:21] second death but you got a group of
[1:19:24] people like brother R talks about uh
[1:19:26] Stonewall Jackson and different ones
[1:19:27] that were true Christian men they died
[1:19:30] that day he didn't die get hisb but he
[1:19:33] actually got shot by one of his own
[1:19:35] men but he died and if he was a
[1:19:37] Christian he only died one
[1:19:40] time so what we see is
[1:19:44] defeat was his
[1:19:46] victory that's what I want to tell you
[1:19:48] and I today you look at your
[1:19:51] Battlefield look at what you're fighting
[1:19:54] because it is a battle everything we do
[1:19:58] is a battle if it's not a battle it's
[1:20:01] like I was telling them in
[1:20:04] Ohio
[1:20:07] chief how you doing
[1:20:11] today
[1:20:13] Chief who said that Ellie hey
[1:20:20] baby Chief and they have at their Church
[1:20:22] they have a figurine of a white dog and
[1:20:25] a black
[1:20:27] dog but when but when Chief was not born
[1:20:31] again cuz remember Chief said after I
[1:20:33] got
[1:20:34] saved after I got saved in me now is
[1:20:39] white dog black dog all right because at
[1:20:43] first it was just black
[1:20:45] dog amen till you get born again it's
[1:20:49] Blackness it's death by death you're
[1:20:51] dying and you're still alive but once
[1:20:53] you get born again again there's a we
[1:20:56] don't want to call God a dog but brother
[1:20:58] Brown did he said now there's two dogs
[1:21:01] in me a white one which has got to be
[1:21:03] the Holy Ghost and then that black one
[1:21:06] is still there the battlefield is still
[1:21:08] still there he said well Chief which one
[1:21:12] wins he said the one I feed the
[1:21:16] most let's stand to our feet the one I
[1:21:18] feed the most listen let's let do like
[1:21:21] brother Ernie said let's hack them smack
[1:21:24] them kill them drill them and if we lose
[1:21:27] our teeth we'll gum the devil till he
[1:21:32] dies but it's a battle that battle in
[1:21:34] that church at Fourth Church age that
[1:21:36] battle was to stay alive physically but
[1:21:39] they were alive spiritually by the word
[1:21:41] of God that they held in their heart
[1:21:43] then we'll see the sardian church age we
[1:21:45] didn't get to it we'll get to it next
[1:21:46] week where they were called The Escape
[1:21:49] ones that's what Sardis means the Escape
[1:21:51] ones they escaped out of
[1:21:53] that and Luther came out of that all
[1:21:56] right he came out of that but remember
[1:21:59] when he came out he came out as a
[1:22:01] reformer we do not and cannot listen we
[1:22:04] cannot stay in
[1:22:07] Reformation you will always fall back in
[1:22:11] this age you go fall backwards you got
[1:22:13] to be full restoration which means
[1:22:16] restore the dead you back to
[1:22:20] life then you can be alive though you
[1:22:22] may be laying on your physical deathbed
[1:22:25] you are more alive than you have ever
[1:22:27] been in your entire life if you're born
[1:22:30] again and you're getting ready to step
[1:22:32] over into another dimension where you're
[1:22:33] not going to carry all that junk with
[1:22:36] you that's to me you just just lay that
[1:22:38] on the table that's just Christianity to
[1:22:41] me you got life after
[1:22:46] death and it's
[1:22:50] Eternal see it was a great thing when
[1:22:52] Lazarus was
[1:22:55] called that back out of the dead right
[1:22:58] Jesus said come forth Lazarus now
[1:23:02] remember probably 30 or 40 years after
[1:23:04] that Lazarus died
[1:23:06] again but I
[1:23:09] believe I hope that he was born again I
[1:23:12] hope he stayed and went to Pentecost or
[1:23:14] or or was one of the 500 I hope he was
[1:23:17] around because you know he was kind of
[1:23:20] attached to the to the maker you know
[1:23:23] and um he didn't have to die again
[1:23:25] though in his soul he's still alive
[1:23:28] we'll see him I will'll see
[1:23:30] Lazarus what a blessing it'll
[1:23:33] be when his face I'll see you love the
[1:23:37] Lord these people died to give us what
[1:23:39] we got as I told y'all before we'll talk
[1:23:42] about later on tendale brought us a
[1:23:45] Bible and they hated him so bad they
[1:23:48] drugged him through a street and killed
[1:23:49] him just for putting the just for doing
[1:23:53] this putting this
[1:23:55] together and giving the people some
[1:23:57] knowledge that's what when when they
[1:23:58] come out of that Catholic Church that
[1:24:00] Catholic Church was like no no no no no
[1:24:03] no uhuh you're not teaching these people
[1:24:05] this that was the battle and then when
[1:24:08] Luther stood out I believe God protected
[1:24:10] Luther because Luther said hey the just
[1:24:12] shall live by faith we don't have to do
[1:24:14] that I'm G to put my 95 thesis
[1:24:18] up and he did exactly what God said he
[1:24:20] said he came out of
[1:24:22] her my people and he brought a group of
[1:24:25] people with him have have you been
[1:24:26] brought completely out have you been
[1:24:28] reformed are we just reformed or have we
[1:24:31] been restored let's sing a song God
