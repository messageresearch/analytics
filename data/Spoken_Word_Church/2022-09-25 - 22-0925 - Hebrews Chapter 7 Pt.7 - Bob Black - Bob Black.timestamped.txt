[1:09] them Lord and we just we just ask this
[1:11] blessing upon these knees in your name
[1:14] amen you can be
[1:28] seated
[1:31] sure appreciate the brothers and sisters
[1:33] in the back for getting uh all this in
[1:36] working
[1:40] order I think I think it helps to have
[1:42] it on the screen a little bit
[1:45] so so we made it uh we we made it
[1:48] through Hebrews chapter 7 and we're on
[1:51] Hebrews chapter 8 which just kind of
[1:53] continues that same thought but we want
[1:55] to kind of Jump Ahead like what like
[1:57] we've been doing to kind of set the
[1:58] theme of what we're talking talking
[2:00] about that that the that where Paul says
[2:02] the law having a shadow of good things
[2:04] to come the law that Old Testament law
[2:06] all those things that you see you read
[2:08] about in the Old Testament where shadow
[2:11] of the coming of eternal life that God
[2:14] put could put his life into the heart of
[2:16] the believer and not the very image of
[2:18] the things can ever with those
[2:19] sacrifices which they offered yearby
[2:21] year continually make the comers there
[2:23] unto perfect but now we've got something
[2:25] that can make us perfect that can change
[2:27] our life change our way of thinking
[2:29] change everything about
[2:31] us so just to kind of summarize some of
[2:34] those things that we talked about last
[2:35] time that the shadow many things that
[2:37] were shadowed in the Old Testament Jonah
[2:39] in the Jonah in the belly of the whale
[2:42] the bronze serpent the Mana that fell in
[2:43] the wilderness the rock that the
[2:45] Israelites drank from the Tabernacle in
[2:47] the wilderness all all these things were
[2:49] a shadow of Christ coming and dying for
[2:52] us that a shadow of Jesus Christ the the
[2:55] first Adam compared to the second Adam
[2:57] the Passover Lamb the Cities of Refuge
[3:00] the temple veil torn compared to Jesus's
[3:02] body Isaac the promised son and on and
[3:05] on I mean you could list out uh probably
[3:08] take take a whole day to just list out
[3:10] all the the types and shadows in the Old
[3:13] Testament that were that were speaking
[3:14] of the coming of
[3:17] Christ so it's a shadow of good things
[3:19] to come the law the law shows what God
[3:22] demanded and Calvary shows what God
[3:25] provided to meet that demand so you know
[3:28] we kind of set set and you're thinking
[3:31] last time we were speaking of what what
[3:32] if you could just take all of those take
[3:34] those Ten Commandments that Moses
[3:36] brought down from the from the uh from
[3:39] the mountain and and if you could put
[3:41] those into the believer's heart so now
[3:43] it wasn't something that you can read
[3:44] off a page and and say well I got to do
[3:47] this and I got to do that but put it
[3:48] into a believer's heart where it could
[3:50] just be lived um if you know the the
[3:54] Torah is is a the Jews call it the Torah
[3:57] it's a list of all the 613 Comm
[3:59] Commandments if you go reading those I I
[4:01] got to reading those the other day and
[4:03] it's um it's really good to just kind of
[4:06] meditate on all of the things that God
[4:08] wants us to do about how to conduct
[4:10] ourselves with one another and how to
[4:12] make good judgments and be uh make good
[4:15] uh decisions about uh you know when
[4:18] something somebody comes to court what's
[4:19] right and wrong and you you put all of
[4:21] that put all of those things into a
[4:23] believer's heart so that it just becomes
[4:25] natural that you treat one another right
[4:28] and so that's that's what I'm going to
[4:30] maybe we'll we'll take a brief uh aide
[4:33] go on a rabbit Trail this morning and
[4:35] kind of look at what how the law is
[4:36] fulfilled in
[4:38] you so in Hebrews chapter 8 Paul begins
[4:41] to speak about he said now the things we
[4:43] have spoken this is the son now he's
[4:45] going to sum sum everything up we've got
[4:48] an high priest who is set on the right
[4:50] hand of the throne in the ma of the
[4:52] Majesty in the heavens a minister of the
[4:54] sanctuary and of the true Tabernacle
[4:56] which the Lord pitched and not man so
[4:58] what's he what's he setting in our mind
[4:59] mind he's said in the Old Testament you
[5:01] could see that Tabernacle that you could
[5:03] walk through that only the high priest
[5:04] could go into the holy of holies and all
[5:07] the different Furnitures and things that
[5:08] went into it but that was a shadow of
[5:11] something that's real so now we've got
[5:13] access to the real what what is the real
[5:15] that God could come and dwell in the
[5:17] heart of the
[5:18] believer in Hebrews 9 chapter 9 he said
[5:21] for Christ has not entered into the holy
[5:23] places made with hands so we're not
[5:25] talking about something that just you
[5:27] can touch anymore but now God has
[5:28] entered into the of the believer which
[5:30] are the figures of the true but into
[5:31] heaven itself now to appear in the
[5:34] presence of God for us and doesn't
[5:36] doesn't the bible say that you're seated
[5:38] in Heavenly places with Christ if you're
[5:40] filled with the Holy Ghost you're seated
[5:42] in Heavenly places because now you're
[5:44] United with that eternal life so in
[5:47] Exodus chapter 25 it says and the tongue
[5:49] and the tongues are speaking of the how
[5:51] the temple was made cuz Paul's he's is
[5:53] about to start talking about the pattern
[5:55] in the mountain he said and the tongues
[5:57] thereof and the snuff dishes thereof
[5:59] shall be of pure gold of a Talon of pure
[6:01] gold shall he make it with all these
[6:03] vessels and look that thou uh God's
[6:06] instructions to Moses look that thou
[6:08] make them after their pattern which will
[6:10] show thee in the mount what's the
[6:12] pattern that God doesn't want to just
[6:14] dwell in in a a building made with hands
[6:17] or a building Made of Stone but God
[6:20] wants to dwell in your heart he wants to
[6:22] dwell in
[6:24] you so in Hebrews 8:3 says for every
[6:28] high priest is ordained to offer gifts
[6:30] and sacrifices whereof it is of
[6:32] necessity that this man have somewhat
[6:34] also to offer for if he were on Earth he
[6:37] should not be a priest seeing that there
[6:39] are priests that offer gifts according
[6:41] to the law who serve unto the example
[6:43] and Shadow of heavenly things as Moses
[6:46] was admonished of God when he was about
[6:48] to make the Tabernacle for see saith he
[6:50] that thou make all things according to
[6:52] the pattern showed to thee in the mount
[6:54] so he's he's comparing the the natural
[6:56] things that the Old Testament priests
[6:58] did where they would they would kill
[7:00] animals and and they would offer gifts
[7:02] for the people but now he's taking it
[7:04] over to a spiritual form that this this
[7:06] is spir something spiritual is happening
[7:09] what's the spiritual gift is the gift of
[7:10] the Holy Ghost the gift of the Holy
[7:12] Ghost in your life and now this is
[7:14] something spiritual
[7:16] happening in verse six he says but now
[7:19] hath he obtained a more excellent
[7:20] Ministry by how much also he is the
[7:22] mediator of a better Covenant which was
[7:25] established upon better promises for if
[7:28] that first Covenant had been faultless
[7:30] there then should no place have been
[7:31] sought for the second if that first
[7:34] Covenant was fine then you wouldn't need
[7:36] a you wouldn't need a second Covenant
[7:37] you wouldn't need a a different kind of
[7:39] priesthood an eternal priesthood you
[7:42] wouldn't need you wouldn't need the gift
[7:43] of the Holy Ghost you wouldn't need
[7:45] eternal life if that first Covenant was
[7:47] not lacking for finding fault with him
[7:50] he saith behold the days come sayith the
[7:53] Lord when I will make a New Covenant
[7:54] with the house of Israel and with the
[7:56] house of Judah and what's that new
[7:59] Covenant that Jeremiah talked about that
[8:02] that God's life that he would he would
[8:04] break just like melkisedek did he he
[8:06] broke bread and and and and served wine
[8:09] and Jesus was a which was a type of
[8:12] Jesus his flesh being torn and his life
[8:15] being poured out so that life could come
[8:17] back into the believer for this is the
[8:19] my blood of the new testament which is
[8:21] shed for many of the remission of sins
[8:23] is what Jesus said there in the upper
[8:24] room so in Jeremiah if we if we go back
[8:27] and read what that that prophecy of that
[8:29] new covenant
[8:30] is he said in in Jeremiah verse 31 of
[8:34] chapter 31 behold the days come sayth
[8:37] the Lord that I will make a New Covenant
[8:39] with the house of Israel and with the
[8:41] house of Judah not according to the
[8:44] Covenant that I made with their fathers
[8:45] in the day that I took them by the hand
[8:47] to bring them out of the land of Egypt
[8:49] which my Covenant they break although I
[8:51] was in husband unto them sayith the Lord
[8:53] but this shall be the Covenant that I
[8:55] will make with the house of Israel after
[8:57] those days sayith the Lord I I will put
[8:59] my law in their inward parts and write
[9:02] it in their hearts and will be their God
[9:04] and they shall be my people now that's a
[9:07] covenant now when God can take all of
[9:09] those 613 Commandments all those law all
[9:12] that Torah all the things that God came
[9:14] down off the mountain with and put it
[9:15] into your heart so that you can love
[9:17] your neighbor so that now you've got
[9:20] power to forgive somebody when they do
[9:22] something wrong to you because you've
[9:24] got the love of God in your heart that
[9:26] now you're actually fulfilling the
[9:28] essence of what the law is because the
[9:31] lawgiver is in your heart and it's not a
[9:33] book of rules but God is living it out
[9:35] in your life and they shall teach no
[9:37] more every man his neighbor and every
[9:39] man is brother saying know the Lord for
[9:42] they shall all know me from the least of
[9:43] them un the greatest of them sayith the
[9:45] Lord for I will forgive their iniquity
[9:47] and I will remember their sin no more
[9:49] you think about what a blessing it is
[9:51] that you can turn to your neighbor in
[9:52] church and when you walk out the doors
[9:54] that every holy ghost filled believer
[9:57] has got those Commandments in their
[9:59] heart and got the ability the power of
[10:01] God in their life to live those live
[10:03] those things out to to where the rest of
[10:06] the world can't love their neighbor but
[10:07] you can love your neighbor you can love
[10:09] somebody that smites you on your cheek
[10:11] and spits in your face because that's
[10:13] what the life of God gives you the power
[10:16] of God in the heart of the believer to
[10:18] fulfill the essence of the
[10:21] Commandment so in verse 8 and of of
[10:24] Hebrews 8 he says for finding fault with
[10:26] him he saith behold the days come sayith
[10:28] the Lord Lord when I will make a New
[10:30] Covenant with the house of Israel and
[10:32] and with the house of Judah not
[10:34] according to the Covenant that I made
[10:35] with their fathers in the day when I
[10:37] took them uh I I I I put this slide in
[10:41] here because I want to compare how Paul
[10:43] Paul what's he doing he's actually
[10:44] quoting what we just read in Jeremiah
[10:47] but I I I wanted to kind of call out cu
[10:50] you know sometimes people get a little
[10:52] bit critical and say well we're not
[10:53] quoting exactly but look how look how uh
[10:56] Paul he adds so he interpolates a little
[10:58] bit he adds his own little thought into
[11:00] his reading of Jeremiah and this is what
[11:02] I was talking about I was listening to
[11:04] to a rabbi and he really blasted Paul
[11:07] for doing this and saying he he said all
[11:09] kinds of but you know what Paul's doing
[11:11] is he's bringing forth the essence of
[11:13] what Jeremiah's saying he he's he's he's
[11:16] he's a he's he's elaborate he's putting
[11:18] his own words and things but the essence
[11:20] is the same as he quotes and he says not
[11:23] according to the so and right there in
[11:25] yell is is some of the things that Paul
[11:26] kind of he he throws in there as he's
[11:29] quoting Jeremiah not according to the
[11:31] Covenant that I made with their fathers
[11:32] in the day when I took them by the hand
[11:34] to lead them out of the land of Egypt
[11:36] because they continue not in my Covenant
[11:38] and I regard them not sayith the Lord
[11:42] for this is the Covenant that I will
[11:43] make with the house of Israel after
[11:44] those days sayith the Lord I will put my
[11:46] laws into their mind and write them in
[11:48] their hearts and I will be to them a God
[11:49] and they shall be to me a people and
[11:51] they shall not teach every man his
[11:52] neighbor and every man his brother
[11:53] saying know the Lord For All Shall know
[11:55] me from the least to the greatest for I
[11:58] will be merciful to their
[11:59] unrighteousness and their sins and their
[12:01] iniquities will I remember no more now
[12:04] if you really study out the way that
[12:06] that the the uh New Testament preachers
[12:08] quot of the Old Testament they do this a
[12:11] lot when they're when they're preaching
[12:12] they'll take a scripture over here and
[12:14] scripture over there and they'll put it
[12:15] together and they'll add they'll add and
[12:17] they'll what what are they doing they're
[12:19] preaching now they're preaching from a
[12:20] revelation that it's not just something
[12:23] that just like uh they they're
[12:25] understanding the the meaning of what is
[12:27] needs to be communicated
[12:30] amen so brother Ram said you can't no
[12:32] matter what you do you quit drinking
[12:35] quit smoking quit telling lies go to
[12:37] church and try to do this and try to do
[12:39] that you're still carnal that's just law
[12:41] the law makes nothing perfect but what
[12:44] makes perfect Christ I might quit
[12:47] stealing quit quit lying quit stealing
[12:49] quit committing adultery quit chewing
[12:51] quit all the things and I'm still carnal
[12:54] God don't receive it because I have
[12:56] nothing to offer him in propitiation but
[12:58] the minute that I lay my hands upon the
[12:59] Blessed head of the Lord Jesus and say
[13:02] Lord I'm no good will you take me as
[13:04] your servant and God kisses away my sin
[13:07] I stand perfect in the sight of God
[13:10] that's right I'm not standing on my own
[13:13] Merit I'm standing on his and he has
[13:16] perfected us through his suffering and
[13:18] his blood you you think about now I got
[13:20] this picture of the cross the shadow of
[13:22] the Cross Laying across the scripture
[13:24] all of that that the that the Old
[13:25] Testament required all of that was
[13:28] fulfilled Christ that when he died on
[13:30] the cross if you're in Christ then the
[13:32] then the requirement has been met that
[13:34] the requirement has been satisfied
[13:36] because his blood paid the price for
[13:39] that but now I want to kind of get into
[13:42] something that's a little bit difficult
[13:43] to express is that is that there is no
[13:46] requirement to come to the Cross but
[13:48] after you come to the cross and you're
[13:49] in him then it changes your life there's
[13:52] a before and after before there's no
[13:54] requirement to come to the Cross but
[13:56] after you come to the cross and get it
[13:57] him it will change your life
[14:01] so Paul in in verse 13 He says in that
[14:04] he saith a New Covenant he hath made the
[14:06] first old now that which decayeth and
[14:08] waxeth old is ready to vanish away so I
[14:12] got these bullet points here Christ
[14:14] sacrifice met every requirement of the
[14:17] law if you are in Christ every
[14:21] requirement has already been met there's
[14:24] no requirement for you to do anything
[14:26] it's not how much you pray or how much
[14:29] you push a penny with your nose or all
[14:31] you have to do is believe on the Lord
[14:33] Jesus Christ to receive your salvation
[14:36] but the Life of Christ and the believer
[14:40] will become a living manifestation of
[14:43] the essence of the law and it begins to
[14:45] express outward in you so there's no way
[14:48] there's no requirement for you to come
[14:50] to Christ but when you come to Christ
[14:52] you become the the word manifest on two
[14:55] feet now now so so Jesus said and in
[14:58] chap Mark 12 he said and Jesus answered
[15:00] in the first of all the Commandments
[15:02] says here oh Israel the Lord our God is
[15:04] one Lord he's he's kind of summon
[15:06] everything up all the Ten Commandments
[15:08] all the law everything the Lord here oh
[15:10] Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and
[15:12] thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
[15:14] all thy heart and with all thy soul and
[15:16] with all thy mind and with all thy
[15:17] strength this is the first commandment
[15:19] you put the you put the life of God into
[15:21] a Believer and now they can fulfill that
[15:24] because they love God in the way that
[15:27] they should the way that the Old
[15:29] Testament was was laid out now it's not
[15:31] a commandment anymore now you love God
[15:34] and the second is like namely this Thou
[15:36] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there
[15:39] is none other commandment greater than
[15:40] these now after after you're born again
[15:43] now you can love you're fulfilling that
[15:46] that law the law becomes manifest in you
[15:50] so that's why Romans chapter 8 says what
[15:52] for what the law could not do and that
[15:54] it was weak through the flesh God
[15:56] sending his own son in the likeness of
[15:58] sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in
[16:01] the flesh that the righteousness of the
[16:04] law might be fulfilled in us who walk
[16:07] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[16:10] you're not walking after the dos and
[16:11] don'ts anymore but you're walking after
[16:14] after a new law a law of love for they
[16:18] that are after The Flesh do mind the
[16:20] things of the flesh but they that are
[16:21] after the spirit the things of the
[16:23] spirit for to be carnally minded is
[16:25] death but to be spiritually minded is
[16:27] life and peace peace because the carnal
[16:30] mind is enmity against God for it is not
[16:32] subject to the law of God so if you're
[16:37] spiritually minded you become subject to
[16:40] the law of God neither and inde can be
[16:42] so then they that are in the flesh
[16:44] cannot please God but ye are not in the
[16:46] flesh but in the spirit if so be that
[16:48] the spirit of God dwell in you now if
[16:50] any man have not the spirit of Christ he
[16:53] is none of his now also in Romans
[16:56] chapter 13 it says owe no man anything
[16:58] but what to love one another for he that
[17:03] loveth
[17:04] another hath fulfilled the law you get
[17:09] the eternal life that life of God in you
[17:11] and you're able to express the love of
[17:14] God then you actually are fulfilling the
[17:17] law that's what the Bible says for this
[17:21] Thou shalt not commit adulter Thou shalt
[17:23] not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt
[17:24] not bear false witness Thou shalt not
[17:26] covet and if there be any other
[17:28] commandment is briefly comprehended in
[17:30] this saying it's all summed up and this
[17:33] Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[17:37] see the reason people commit adultery is
[17:39] because they don't love they don't love
[17:40] the the person that they're that they're
[17:42] they're talking to they don't love that
[17:43] girl that they're lusting after they
[17:45] don't I mean I don't mean like love like
[17:47] you want to get married to them they
[17:48] don't they they don't love them and as
[17:50] as part of like wanting to see them
[17:51] saved want to want to see their soul
[17:54] want them to see salvation the reason
[17:56] people kill is because they don't love
[17:58] love the reason people steal is because
[18:00] they don't love the the reason you know
[18:03] you talk about that sometimes the kids
[18:04] will go to camps and stuff and that
[18:06] somebody will steal their iPhone or
[18:07] steal something that was in their
[18:08] pocketbook the reason somebody does that
[18:10] is because they don't love they don't as
[18:11] a person as a Humanity they don't want
[18:13] to see them save they don't want the
[18:15] good for them they they they they don't
[18:18] uh you know they don't value them as in
[18:20] their
[18:20] Humanity Thou shalt not bear false
[18:23] witness that's the reason people lie is
[18:25] because they don't love thou shalt not
[18:27] covet covet to compare you know people
[18:30] say there's that saying that uh
[18:32] comparison is the is the thief of Joy
[18:35] when you covet something somebody else
[18:37] has got then your your joy is actually
[18:39] robbed and the the reason that people
[18:41] covet the reason you want the car that
[18:43] the neighbor's driving or something that
[18:44] somebody else has is because you don't
[18:46] love that's what I'm talking about
[18:48] that's what the the new birth gives you
[18:50] is love love to be able to love somebody
[18:53] else and when you love the the way that
[18:56] that that Paul is talking about here in
[18:58] Romans moments you are fulfilling the
[19:00] essence of the law love worketh no ill
[19:03] to his neighbor therefore love is the
[19:07] fulfilling of the
[19:09] law so in Galatians he says for Brethren
[19:12] ye have been called un Liberty only use
[19:14] not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh
[19:16] but by love serve one another for all
[19:20] the law all the
[19:22] law all that essence of the Old
[19:24] Testament law is fulfilled in this new
[19:27] covenant when Christ's life is put into
[19:30] the heart of the believer and you can
[19:32] love the way that God wanted you to from
[19:35] the beginning all the law is fulfilled
[19:37] in one word even in this Thou shalt love
[19:41] thy neighbor as
[19:43] thyself you know you know when you
[19:45] really think if you meditate on what
[19:47] that means that when somebody's going
[19:49] through a trial and maybe they slip up
[19:51] and fall you look at them with different
[19:53] eyes because you know I'm a human too
[19:54] and I'm going through stuff and I want
[19:56] somebody to give me Grace amen when you
[19:59] look at somebody and you because you
[20:01] love them you give them you give them a
[20:03] little more grace you give them you
[20:05] treat them a little bit differently
[20:07] because you realize we're we're all
[20:09] humans and we're all trying to get to
[20:10] the same goal if you fulfill the Royal
[20:13] law James said according to the
[20:15] scripture Thou shalt if you fulfill the
[20:17] Royal
[20:18] law Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[20:22] thyself ye do
[20:25] well oh you see you see how so that's
[20:29] difficult to express there's no
[20:30] requirement to come to Christ there's
[20:32] nothing you have to do to work yourself
[20:34] up or something to come to Christ but
[20:35] after you come to Christ after you get
[20:37] in him it's going there's going to be
[20:40] something work out from your members
[20:42] it's going what's what's put on display
[20:45] love the love of God and first John said
[20:49] hereby perceive we the love of God
[20:51] because he laid down his life for us and
[20:53] we ought to lay down our lives for the
[20:55] Brethren but who so hath this world's
[20:57] good and seeth his brother have need and
[20:59] shutteth up his bowels of compassion
[21:01] from him how dwelleth the love of God in
[21:05] him my little children let us not love
[21:08] in word neither in tongue but in deed
[21:10] and
[21:11] Truth in first John again John so many
[21:16] so much of what he talked about was
[21:18] about based on love because he loved
[21:20] Jesus Christ whosoever believeth that
[21:23] Jesus is the Christ is born of God and
[21:25] everyone that loveth him that begat
[21:29] loveth him also that is begotten so if
[21:33] you love The Giver you going to love
[21:36] those that received eternal life if you
[21:39] love Jesus Christ you can't help but
[21:40] love
[21:43] me and you can't help but love one
[21:46] another because if you love Jesus you
[21:48] can't help but love those that have
[21:50] received him oh by that should change
[21:53] our our attitudes this
[21:55] morning when you think about you know
[21:58] know everybody in this building and
[21:59] maybe streaming it
[22:01] online loves God loves Jesus Christ and
[22:05] if you've received him you can't help
[22:07] but love one another amen by this we
[22:11] know that we love the children of God
[22:15] when we love God and keep his
[22:17] Commandments for this is the love of God
[22:20] that we keep his Commandments and his
[22:22] Commandments are not Grievous what what
[22:25] Commandments the 613 Commandments in the
[22:28] Old Testament that if you go back and
[22:30] read They're talking about how to be
[22:32] just to one another how to make good
[22:34] decisions they're not Grievous there
[22:36] they things that that uh you know just
[22:39] naturally we should just do to one
[22:41] another and when you got the eternal
[22:43] life of God living in you it will become
[22:45] natural because as you eat the word you
[22:47] become the word and you you're actually
[22:49] becoming what God wanted you to
[22:52] be love is the fulfilling of the law
[22:55] brother brand said in the brass serpent
[22:57] he said God has a law and that law is
[23:00] love God can't work against himself then
[23:03] if I love God correctly then I'm going
[23:05] to testify the truth about God if I'm in
[23:07] in love with him I've got a wife here's
[23:09] in the building God knows I love her
[23:10] well you know everything good and
[23:12] everything is going to be for my wife
[23:13] you know that sure just like your
[23:15] husband would be to you well now if we
[23:17] love God then my confidence becomes
[23:20] perfect in him as I love him now he
[23:23] can't break that law of Love see because
[23:27] it's in my heart now you think about on
[23:30] the left there I got what what is love
[23:32] in 1 Corinthians uh 13 will tell you so
[23:35] you know right there at the top of the
[23:37] list we of course we know brother R said
[23:38] love is corrective love is corrective
[23:40] because when you're doing wrong love
[23:42] will what love will straighten you out
[23:44] but love suffers long it's
[23:46] longsuffering maybe sometimes you got
[23:48] children out in the world and and you
[23:50] realize what long suffering is cu but
[23:53] you're patient love love love will wait
[23:56] a while cuz it's love love is kind love
[23:59] is not always putting somebody down and
[24:01] saying well you ain't worth nothing see
[24:03] I don't I don't like bullying and and
[24:05] putting down CU love love will lift you
[24:08] up love envieth not vth not itself is
[24:13] not puffed
[24:14] up CU love what's love trying to do
[24:17] prefer your brother does not behave
[24:20] itself unseemly seeketh not her own is
[24:23] not easily
[24:25] provoked you can poke somebody with love
[24:28] but they won't slap you back because
[24:31] they love you thinketh no evil rejoiceth
[24:35] not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the
[24:38] truth beareth all things believeth all
[24:41] things hopeth all things endureth all
[24:45] things and never fails love will never
[24:50] fail that brother man said what love
[24:53] cast out Devils love what CU love is the
[24:57] light I'm talking about real love agapy
[25:00] love love is the life of God that Zoey
[25:03] life that life will cast out Devils when
[25:07] you come in come home and your your kids
[25:09] are all running around act uh uh you
[25:12] know your wife's in a tizzy and and
[25:15] everything brother BR said you just come
[25:16] home and you just start straightening
[25:19] things up and and showing a little bit
[25:21] love and and that's I think that's a
[25:24] lesson for all of
[25:26] us uh myself included because
[25:30] love uh a hand slapped up against the
[25:33] face or strong words many times fail but
[25:36] love will always win the day
[25:41] amen so Paul said in Hebrews chapter 9
[25:45] what are we talking about we talking
[25:46] about the law take that Old Testament
[25:49] law and putting it into the heart of the
[25:51] believer in a New Covenant that that law
[25:56] can be lived out in you
[25:58] and verily the first Covenant had also
[26:00] ordinances of divine service in a
[26:02] worldly Sanctuary for there was a
[26:04] tabernacle made the first wherein was
[26:06] the Candlestick and the table and the
[26:08] showbread which is called The
[26:10] Sanctuary he he's he's he making a point
[26:13] you could see all these things in the
[26:14] natural but now we're talking about
[26:17] something
[26:18] spiritual and after the second Veil The
[26:21] Tabernacle which is called the holiest
[26:22] of all which had the golden censor and
[26:25] the Ark of the Covenant overlaid
[26:26] roundabout with gold wherein was the
[26:28] golden pot that had mana and Aaron's raw
[26:30] that budded in the tables of the
[26:31] Covenant and over it the cherums of gold
[26:34] shouted on The Mercy Seat of which we
[26:35] cannot now speak
[26:38] particularly all of those things
[26:40] represented something what do they
[26:42] represent like like brother Louise and
[26:43] brother Wade have been breaking down the
[26:45] the rod that budded all all these things
[26:47] are speaking of the life of God and the
[26:50] believer that now you can eat of that
[26:52] Mana that they that they that only the
[26:54] high priest can eat of now now you can
[26:56] you can enter in and eat of that now now
[26:59] you can have that eternal life with that
[27:01] rod budded and and and you now those
[27:04] tables of stone are in the believer's
[27:06] heart now all of those things that we're
[27:08] just Shadows of now we've got the
[27:10] reality of it in our
[27:12] lives in Hebrews chapter
[27:15] 9 now when these things were thus
[27:17] ordained in verse 6 he said now the
[27:19] priest went always into the first
[27:21] Tabernacle accomplishing the service of
[27:23] God but into the second went the high
[27:25] priest alone once every year not without
[27:27] blood which he offered for himself and
[27:29] for The Heirs of the people the Holy
[27:32] Ghost is signifying it's about the Holy
[27:35] Ghost that the way into the holiest of
[27:38] all was not yet made manifest while as
[27:41] the first Tabernacle was yet standing
[27:44] which was a figure for the time then
[27:45] present in which we were offered both
[27:47] gifts and sacrifices that could not make
[27:50] him that did the service perfect as
[27:52] pertaining to the conscience if the
[27:54] musicians will go ahead and come forward
[27:57] which stood only in meats and drinks and
[28:00] diverse Washings and carnal ordinances
[28:03] imposed on them until the time of
[28:05] reformation but we've got something that
[28:07] can change our conscience change our
[28:10] thinking but Christ being coming high
[28:12] priest of good things to come by a
[28:14] greater and more perfect Tabernacle not
[28:16] made with hands that is to say not of
[28:19] this building neither by the blood of
[28:21] goats and calves calves but by his own
[28:24] blood he entered in once into the holy
[28:27] place
[28:28] having obtained Eternal Redemption for
[28:31] us what holy Place into your heart and
[28:35] we'll stop right there God bless you
[28:38] let's meditate on these things as we
[28:40] prepare for the
[28:42] [Applause]
[28:44] service
