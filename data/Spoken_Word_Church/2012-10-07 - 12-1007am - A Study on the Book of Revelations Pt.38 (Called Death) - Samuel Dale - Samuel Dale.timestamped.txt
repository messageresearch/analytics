[7:29] so so let's just pray before we read our
[7:31] scripture Heavenly Father we thank you
[7:33] this this day for your love and your
[7:35] grace unto us thank you for the hour
[7:36] that we're living the time Lord that
[7:39] that we can actually just be able to
[7:42] look around and see that's prophecy made
[7:45] known amen by seeing life and seeing the
[7:48] way it is and to see your word and see
[7:51] it how it's unfolding to us amen and we
[7:55] just thank you for all things and we ask
[7:56] you now that you would just come and
[7:58] speak to our heart as we read your word
[8:00] this morning that you would bless each
[8:02] and every one remember those that are
[8:04] not here and remember the sick among us
[8:06] because you said you would that you
[8:08] would come Among Us and give us your
[8:10] word and heal us and Deliver Us from
[8:12] destruction so have your way now forgive
[8:14] our sins guide us now in Jesus name amen
[8:19] we've only got one on the pole back
[8:21] there this morning so if things gets to
[8:24] running a little slow brother brother um
[8:28] Anderson is on the pole by himself all
[8:31] the others are out visiting so we'll
[8:34] make sure not to try to overload him too
[8:36] fast and call out things that you know
[8:39] it's slowly off but Revelations
[8:43] 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[8:46] God gave unto him to show unto his
[8:48] servants things which must shortly come
[8:50] to pass and he sent and signified it by
[8:53] his Angel and to his servant John who by
[8:56] record of the word of God and the
[8:58] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[9:00] things that he saw blessed is he that
[9:03] readeth and they that hear the words of
[9:05] this prophecy and keep those things
[9:07] which are written therein for the time
[9:10] is at hand what is it time to understand
[9:14] now Revelation 6 verse 7 and 8 and when
[9:18] he had opened the fourth seal I heard
[9:20] the voice of the fourth Beast say come
[9:22] and see and I looked and behold a Pale
[9:25] Horse and his name that said on him was
[9:28] death and Hell Followed With Him and
[9:32] power was given unto them over the
[9:33] fourth part of the earth to kill with
[9:36] sword and with hunger and with death and
[9:38] with the Peace of the earth amen you may
[9:41] be seated I'm glad to have Matthew and
[9:45] BV and Rel with us this
[9:48] morning that the Lord would bless right
[9:51] now we've been trying
[9:53] to uh lay down a pattern or a
[9:57] thought and I keep bringing it back to
[10:00] you because I want it to dwell in your
[10:02] mind you know of what we're doing and
[10:05] all and then you be able to follow after
[10:10] the understanding but we've been now in
[10:13] the uh opening of the seals and uh you
[10:16] know starting on through and a study on
[10:19] on the Book of
[10:20] Revelations and we've been getting a
[10:22] good bit of response off the internet
[10:24] Lord people connecting in amen and we
[10:26] pray that the Lord will bless you out
[10:28] there amen as you hear and uh check it
[10:32] out and if it's not right then send me
[10:35] an email and show me where I missed it
[10:37] out cuz I want to be right I want to I
[10:41] want it to be right all right
[10:44] now we read here that this fourth one
[10:47] remember we went through the seals the
[10:48] first one was a white horse then the
[10:51] next one was a red horse the next one
[10:53] was a black horse and now we come to a
[10:56] Pale Horse which when you mix all of
[10:58] those black white you know and red
[11:02] together you're going to come out with a
[11:03] Pale Horse but remember now that what
[11:06] our thought has being the rider is the
[11:09] same on each horse right CU it's
[11:13] exposing Satan right the Bible doesn't
[11:16] reveal now get the words you know you
[11:19] can use the word reveal that's fine it's
[11:21] not no problems and all but my point is
[11:24] to try to emphasize that we're trying to
[11:28] expose Satan
[11:29] not to reveal him because we're
[11:31] revealing trying to reveal Jesus
[11:35] Christ because the Bible is not the
[11:37] revelation of the devil right that's
[11:40] what people are trying to do they're
[11:41] trying to reveal the devil in his ways
[11:43] right when that's no good at all is to
[11:46] reveal Jesus
[11:48] Christ and then when we see Jesus Christ
[11:50] we'll automatically see the devil in his
[11:52] ways because that'll be doing so we're
[11:55] we're trying to expose him for what he
[11:57] is and what he's being and always has
[12:00] been you know Satan himself am and how
[12:03] that he comes down
[12:05] through the time upon the Earth he
[12:08] started out the prophet said there in
[12:11] Genesis said these
[12:12] seals open up down through time he said
[12:16] especially the seventh seal amen and uh
[12:20] doing that then we can look back there
[12:22] and see where everything started from
[12:24] right but our emphasis has been to the
[12:26] point to try to get you to see that we
[12:30] are not here when the literal seal
[12:32] itself opens amen cuz surely we don't
[12:35] want to be around here when Armageddon
[12:37] takes place we don't want to be here in
[12:39] the tribulation we don't want to be here
[12:41] under the sick seal and those different
[12:42] things you know but we look at it and
[12:45] see it unfold right I keep emphasizing
[12:49] that what I've always tried to get you
[12:51] to see that the Book of Revelation is
[12:53] the bride's book if you want to see
[12:55] yourself go in the Book of Revelations
[12:58] see now the symbols are broke amen the
[13:01] prophet tells us the symbols so now we
[13:03] can read the book of Revelation that's
[13:06] our book because the others was writing
[13:09] about of the times they were on the
[13:11] earth and things and even the apostles
[13:14] and the the writings but see we're down
[13:16] here where that the book is being
[13:19] unveiled or
[13:21] revealed opened brought into being to
[13:25] where the we can see Who We Are Amen in
[13:29] our day and time amen then like I've
[13:32] always said to you you know we think
[13:34] well boy it would have been something to
[13:35] been back there when Jesus was here or
[13:38] Moses was here or whatever you know but
[13:43] this is the greatest of all amen that's
[13:45] this is the ending up of all things amen
[13:47] the prophet said I'd rather be here than
[13:49] anywhere right why because we're going
[13:51] to be here to see amen prophecy is
[13:55] unveiling itself every day right in our
[13:58] eyes you know in the where that that we
[14:01] can can see what's taking place you know
[14:04] they even brother was telling me a
[14:06] minute ago they even got a movie out now
[14:08] predicting where the certain person gets
[14:11] president what it's going to be boy
[14:13] that's something ain't it and we'll get
[14:16] down to it after a while which this
[14:18] evening really would the prophet would
[14:20] say that the seal would be un would
[14:23] unfold or you know look forward and see
[14:27] it as it would would happen in our day
[14:30] and say it would be foretold unto
[14:33] us well sure you know like you say they
[14:36] got this they got that well what if they
[14:38] miss
[14:40] it that's what I've always tried to tell
[14:42] the people about the message you know
[14:45] that it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[14:46] that I'm looking at it's not whether
[14:49] certain certain person president who's
[14:51] president or what takes place or what
[14:54] happens in the world or the Mayan
[14:56] calendar you know it's supposed to run
[14:57] out this year and according to them they
[15:00] don't have anything left right well I'm
[15:03] not worried you know I just have them to
[15:06] write a few more days put in the
[15:07] calendar as far as I'm concerned and
[15:09] they can go right on doing what they
[15:11] want to but see it's not the revealing
[15:14] of
[15:16] Satan it's the revealing of Jesus Christ
[15:19] right then you can see Satan in his
[15:22] tactics and his ways and what he's doing
[15:25] you can follow him because you follow
[15:27] Jesus Christ through the word it's got
[15:29] to be a revelation that's the main thing
[15:32] all right see then exposing
[15:35] Satan to where that we can see
[15:39] him all right see his ways and his
[15:43] actions what is the main thing that
[15:46] Satan tries to do you so what he kills
[15:48] he does this no he's discrediting God's
[15:52] word right if he can get you to doubt
[15:55] God's
[15:56] word he's got you defeated right
[15:59] right look at what they're doing now
[16:01] they certainly didn't do it when the
[16:03] prophet was here you remember yeah them
[16:07] that was when he was here they kept
[16:09] their mouth shut didn't they right oh
[16:11] yeah they blowed up a little bit but
[16:13] then when he walked up and said come up
[16:16] here with me right they had enough sense
[16:18] to shut up right and be quiet but now
[16:22] see oh he's not
[16:25] here so now it's not the world that's
[16:29] attacking this message right yeah right
[16:32] and they've left us alone right
[16:36] right it's the people in the
[16:40] message that's attacking the message
[16:43] well you know what I'm trying to do
[16:45] expose that is being
[16:47] Satan now wait a minute brother them a
[16:49] good brothers and sisters I didn't say
[16:51] nothing about that you remember in the
[16:54] Bible one time there a certain man
[16:56] standing there and the Lord Jesus said
[16:59] get behind me
[17:01] Satan right now was he calling Peter the
[17:04] devil no no no right what was anointing
[17:09] him at that time was the devil and he
[17:12] said get behind me well I'm not against
[17:15] anybody because I've always told you if
[17:18] God hadn't revealed what he has to you
[17:21] and I we couldn't be able to stand where
[17:23] we stand so it's all what he's revealing
[17:26] unto us all right
[17:29] but we see
[17:31] him we see him down through
[17:34] time we follow the devil and his
[17:37] tactics but now he's
[17:40] attacking the one
[17:44] thing that is the only thing that can
[17:47] defeat
[17:48] him right is the word that's
[17:51] right Jesus is not here in Corporal body
[17:55] that's right the prophet is not here to
[17:57] challenge the world right
[18:01] right but the word is still here am
[18:04] we'll get to that the end the word still
[18:06] here don't worry about it but
[18:09] everything's right on
[18:10] time nothing out of care it's all
[18:14] working just for God's plan amen
[18:18] right but if we'll just stay with the
[18:20] word you'll bring us through amen right
[18:24] all right now you'll see at the end of
[18:26] it the prophet said nothing can't def
[18:28] feat the word that's
[18:33] right but now remember what he says he
[18:36] say as long is laying on the pages of
[18:38] the Bible the
[18:40] book he said it can be questioned
[18:43] right right right but when it's revealed
[18:47] in your heart right and you become one
[18:51] with the word you can't be questioned
[18:54] anymore just leave them alone because
[18:57] you know they nothing done and that's
[18:58] what I'm saying about the the what
[19:00] Satan's tactics cuz you see what he's
[19:03] doing throughout the people of the
[19:04] message if they can't attack what he's
[19:08] what he
[19:10] taught they'll attack something in his
[19:14] life right
[19:17] y but don't they realize that's the
[19:19] devil right amen you
[19:22] know no I I know no I'm just exposing
[19:26] error
[19:29] what do you mean are you the prophet
[19:32] yeah
[19:34] right I I thought we just had
[19:37] one but you get what I'm saying see then
[19:40] that way we're trying to just stay with
[19:42] the word just hammer it down
[19:45] right to where we can see Jesus Christ
[19:48] amen revealed in the
[19:51] word and then we'll see Satan riding off
[19:54] right they go ahead and do all of his
[19:56] tricks and doings and all we just right
[19:59] on Amen you know believing it wonderful
[20:02] brothers out there that their thoughts
[20:04] and ideas of their own thoughts and
[20:06] ideas what does the word say Amen is the
[20:10] main thing all right now let's get on to
[20:12] the point do we see that the same Rider
[20:15] each time it's not a Red Rider and a
[20:18] white Rider and a Black Rider and a pale
[20:21] rider you know it's the same old
[20:24] devil the horse is what changes color
[20:27] right
[20:29] and in the changing of the color of the
[20:31] horse it shows what's taking
[20:34] place that we've been through it you
[20:36] know the the White Horse and the the
[20:39] Antichrist and the deceptive is going
[20:41] but remember now the rider gets off of
[20:44] the horse gets on another horse the
[20:46] horse keeps riding right it just keeps
[20:49] right on going amen it's still here when
[20:52] it got off the red got on to the black
[20:54] red one just keeps riding right right
[20:57] the horse don't stop
[20:59] right cuz that's the power and the
[21:00] things of Satan as he's working through
[21:03] the church
[21:06] system but brother there don't you think
[21:08] anybody's got anything I only know of
[21:11] one person that's got the baptism of the
[21:13] Holy Ghost
[21:15] right that's me
[21:19] right right I'm
[21:23] sorry now it's no good for you to say I
[21:25] believe brother Dale's got it they won't
[21:27] do no good it's not that right remember
[21:30] if there only one going you got to
[21:32] believe you're the one you're the only
[21:35] one that knows whether you're born again
[21:37] or
[21:38] not I can't tell
[21:40] you you said well we follow the
[21:43] word everybody claims to follow the word
[21:48] you want to go across the street and
[21:50] listen to the man will he say we're not
[21:52] following the word here no he won't say
[21:54] that will
[21:55] he everybody believes they fall in the
[21:58] word what are we going to do
[22:00] right I'm just going to keep right on
[22:02] going down the road and when we walk off
[22:04] the earth this will all be settled and
[22:06] all be finished up amen but now think
[22:08] about
[22:10] it the four stages of the
[22:13] Antichrist which is
[22:15] Antichrist false
[22:18] prophet then he becomes a viker or a
[22:24] pope and then he'll become the Beast y
[22:29] but you
[22:31] know I I love the points the prophet was
[22:34] making he can't be that Beast until we
[22:37] get out of here right that's
[22:41] right now he's the man of
[22:44] sinh he's the false prophet right he's
[22:48] the
[22:50] Antichrist but he can't be that
[22:54] incarnate false prophet of the Beast
[22:58] until we get out of
[23:00] here see if that bores you for me to
[23:02] keep emphasizing that then I'll tell you
[23:05] you don't understand that if it bores
[23:08] you because you know I still love to
[23:11] hear Brother Ram explain water baptism
[23:13] don't
[23:15] you you know right I don't get bored
[23:18] because of him explaining something
[23:19] simple amen I believe it and go on all
[23:22] right but think about
[23:25] it exposing Satan for what he
[23:34] is he's a devil
[23:37] right he's a demon he's all of the
[23:41] things that the Bible calls
[23:44] him the red dragon the different
[23:47] things and seeing him and seeing what
[23:50] happens to it
[23:53] right that he's defeated amen that's why
[23:57] I said there the other day today talking
[23:59] about it and when it comes down to that
[24:01] Pale
[24:04] Horse remember that's how God is
[24:06] describing him right
[24:09] right he's describing him as a Pale
[24:11] Horse amen we'll read in a minute sickly
[24:14] looking thing
[24:16] y oh sure Satan's got every government
[24:19] in the world under his
[24:22] control but they're blowing each other
[24:25] apart that's right amen yeah
[24:29] right every country is against the other
[24:31] country all them ruled by the same
[24:35] devil that's hard to understand isn't
[24:38] it but like some of them give up and got
[24:40] to give him no right demons won't do
[24:43] that n right no they all want to be the
[24:47] head man
[24:50] righten but think about
[24:53] it all the governments of the world are
[24:55] controlled by the devil Y show me one
[24:58] that's not right oh we're an American
[25:02] we're Christians H
[25:08] yeah but listen
[25:11] church it's not to see what's out there
[25:16] right
[25:17] right all right it's to see what's in
[25:21] here am that's right brother amen to see
[25:25] everybody in the world's lost ain't
[25:28] going to save you no right
[25:30] Amen to see you're
[25:34] lost yeah have a bless I've been in the
[25:36] message 20
[25:39] years let me quote one of the brothers
[25:42] in the
[25:45] message have you received the gift of
[25:47] the Holy Ghost since you believe right
[25:49] amen who said that that was the Apostle
[25:52] Paul right yep that was the Apostle Paul
[25:57] that made that statement right
[26:00] all see to find out we're lost is one
[26:03] great thing because that's what we're
[26:05] going to deal with we get over to it
[26:06] death
[26:09] right death is not going to the
[26:11] Undertaker and being put in the ground
[26:13] right that Soul leaves that body and
[26:16] lives
[26:18] on what is death only the eagle knew
[26:22] what it was we'll get to that in a
[26:24] minute only he knew what real true death
[26:28] was
[26:29] right and he seen it and tried to preach
[26:32] it unto us okay let's get on with it see
[26:37] brother Anderson let's just jump over 1
[26:40] 2 3 and four and let me just quote it
[26:44] you can bring up number five in a minute
[26:46] but
[26:48] remember what are we
[26:50] covering that the SE is not to you and I
[26:54] right the literal happening right that's
[26:56] right but we see the Prophet said on the
[26:59] the paragraph 87 of the fifth seal the
[27:02] seals reveal what was what is and what
[27:05] shall be
[27:06] right the whole Plan of Redemption is
[27:09] revealed in no seals yes amen and
[27:13] therefore far us I hope you don't
[27:15] misunderstand my wording the seals is
[27:17] revealed to you and
[27:19] I we see them actually
[27:22] greater now listen right we see the
[27:26] opening of the by the opening of seals
[27:27] by way of the we see it greater than it
[27:30] will actually be when it literally comes
[27:35] right I I'd rather be years seeing it
[27:38] now than to be there when it literally
[27:40] takes place
[27:43] amen because we can see it more
[27:47] right why because this Prophet was able
[27:50] to go into the mind of God and bring out
[27:53] of there the Revelation to you and I
[27:56] that's why I encourage you to read to
[27:58] seal
[28:01] book I've emphasized over 40 something
[28:04] years to read it yes but read it to see
[28:07] what it's saying to you amen that's
[28:09] right when I finally read the seal book
[28:13] when I first came into the
[28:15] message I enjoyed a lot of what I read
[28:19] right you know what I done I put the
[28:21] seal back down because I seen I wasn't
[28:24] understanding and I went back to the
[28:25] church age book and begin to read and
[28:29] study
[28:32] that because I realized I wasn't getting
[28:34] what he was
[28:38] saying
[28:40] because as I was reading the seal book
[28:42] what I was getting was
[28:45] seemingly a man's
[28:51] Revelation right even though he would
[28:53] prove it by
[28:56] history I was listening to what's
[28:58] somebody say it
[29:00] right that's wonderful don't
[29:02] misunderstand this point that was
[29:05] wonderful
[29:09] right and when he said that the Bible
[29:11] had become a new
[29:14] book that was
[29:17] wonderful but I've seen people been in
[29:20] the message two or 3 months and say well
[29:22] it's something ain't it that the Bible's
[29:23] a brand new
[29:25] book well they didn't even know what the
[29:28] and
[29:29] said little Al to think about what a new
[29:32] book
[29:34] was see I admit I didn't see the new
[29:38] book right I seen a lot in the book that
[29:42] I didn't understand
[29:43] before right but I went back to the
[29:46] church ages and stayed on that for quite
[29:49] a while
[29:50] studying because of the doctrinal issues
[29:53] of the one God the the different things
[29:55] of serpent seed the the things that I
[29:57] knew that I
[30:00] needed but then one day I began to read
[30:02] the seal
[30:04] book as I begin to read the seal book I
[30:07] begin to see this man's not he's not
[30:09] talking about
[30:11] himself although you got to admit going
[30:15] through the seal book it seemingly that
[30:16] he's talking about
[30:18] himself but he said no I'm talking about
[30:22] the word right I'm talking about the
[30:26] Believers in the book right yes Father I
[30:29] begin to see that he was talking about
[30:32] me
[30:34] right
[30:36] right then I begin to enjoy the book
[30:38] amen then it begin to become a what new
[30:41] book a new book
[30:44] amen cuz I seen myself you know yourself
[30:48] that most of all what's preached about
[30:49] the people this message is to try to get
[30:51] you to see brother brandom that's
[30:53] wonderful that's a stage in your
[30:55] development that's got to be there and
[30:57] without that where would we all be
[31:00] nowhere right but when are we going to
[31:02] begin to see
[31:05] ourselves y right when are we going to
[31:08] see
[31:11] ourselves in the
[31:14] book and get away
[31:16] from not looking for somebody else right
[31:21] but to find ourselves right amen right
[31:23] in the word right and realize
[31:28] this is the bride's
[31:30] book the Bible is the bride's book The
[31:34] Book of Revelations is a
[31:36] special position
[31:38] thought or idea cuz it's finishing
[31:41] everything up amen
[31:44] right but you see those seals when they
[31:46] literally break we're not there right CU
[31:49] we gave you the quotes over and over and
[31:51] over and
[31:54] over that this is not in our day right
[31:57] the R would say on paragraph 194 the for
[32:00] seal this is not in our
[32:03] day to where he would go through and say
[32:06] the bride goes up in Revelations
[32:09] 4:1 not seen till
[32:13] 1921 well when are we going to believe
[32:16] that right irregardless of whether we
[32:18] can explain
[32:21] it I can't explain how
[32:24] that a cow eats great GRE
[32:30] grass and give us white
[32:33] milk can
[32:36] you and you turn the
[32:38] milk it turned into butter and it's
[32:43] yellow can you explain
[32:46] that well you don't quit drinking milk
[32:48] do you
[32:51] no well that's what I've always tried to
[32:53] get the people to see see these things
[32:55] that we're on now of these seals they're
[32:58] not even in our day
[33:00] right they're after we leave out of here
[33:02] amen right but we see the
[33:06] Revelation how much greater could it be
[33:09] that's right the revelation of the
[33:11] opening of the word after the church is
[33:14] done gone home the prophet
[33:18] said that we see these
[33:22] things we can look back and see these
[33:24] things unfold
[33:29] I remember when I first was listening to
[33:32] kind of some thoughts on the prophet and
[33:34] what he
[33:35] said you know why that he did not want
[33:39] the children of Israel to have a literal
[33:48] King he said because they start bowing
[33:51] down before him that's
[33:53] right okay
[33:58] right he would demand their uh respect
[34:02] but it would go too
[34:08] far and they would have a oneman idea or
[34:11] thought right that's right when he
[34:12] wanted to deal with everybody am amen
[34:15] but mainly he didn't want them bowing
[34:18] down that's why he was so much against
[34:20] them bowing before Idols
[34:23] right cuz that would put something else
[34:25] between the people and God
[34:28] right he said what do you want a king
[34:34] for I'm your King
[34:37] right you want somebody to fight your
[34:39] battles I fight them all for you
[34:44] right but you see they still wanted a
[34:47] king yeah right that's right and they
[34:50] begin to bow
[34:52] down and they begin to honor man yep
[34:56] instead of God right
[34:58] well and good to honor man but make sure
[35:01] your worship first is to God
[35:04] Amen not to a man right why because
[35:07] that's what went on during the ages as
[35:10] we went through that it went from
[35:13] what
[35:14] Antichrist false
[35:17] prophet then incarnate false prophet our
[35:20] Pope or Vier as we gave you there
[35:22] paragraph 160 of the of the uh
[35:26] seal and then turn out to be a beast
[35:32] right same devil in his ways of getting
[35:35] everything done then brother Brown said
[35:38] I was going to preach a message called
[35:39] beast at the beginning and beast at the
[35:44] end cuz it was a beast in the garden
[35:47] right
[35:48] righten the serpent was the most subtle
[35:51] of all Beast right amen there beast in
[35:55] the End Amen right when Satan will
[35:58] become
[36:01] incarnate in that false prophet that is
[36:04] the man of sin sitting in the temple of
[36:06] God showing himself to be as God and
[36:08] then when he
[36:10] does he will take over
[36:13] completely
[36:14] yep right
[36:17] MH not just a demon but Satan himself
[36:23] right you see Satan he's not a man he's
[36:27] not going to down in any form he can't
[36:28] create a body and come and live in it so
[36:31] he's got to use somebody
[36:34] else and he
[36:37] will but it started so
[36:40] easy so
[36:44] small and it's still today the
[36:47] same but brother Dale those are good
[36:50] Brothers you're throwing all
[36:53] on you
[36:55] know had a brother tell me when time he
[36:57] said well that's the way he sees it I
[37:02] said no no no no forget it now hold on a
[37:04] minute yeah the man I give him the book
[37:07] back I said he didn't say that's the way
[37:09] he sees it he said that's the way
[37:11] brother randam taught
[37:12] it ain't no problems when you say this
[37:15] is the way I see it that's no
[37:17] problem you can say I believe it this
[37:20] way that's no problem with me I'm not
[37:23] going to argue with you because you got
[37:24] a right by the Constitution to have that
[37:29] but when you say brother Brandon said
[37:32] it sorry he didn't say that right well
[37:37] yes he did well show it to me
[37:41] right well so and so told me they read
[37:45] it one time we were in the days of the
[37:47] computer when the so and so is out the
[37:49] door
[37:51] right what we used to think he said
[37:54] right is not exactly right anymore
[37:57] sometimes because your computer will
[38:00] show you up and you know what I mean by
[38:01] that we've been able to handle all of
[38:03] the things bring it all down to a
[38:07] message but listen
[38:09] Church these things are not in our
[38:16] day this where we're at talking about
[38:18] the
[38:20] foreal it's not in our
[38:23] day it's going to be later on when we
[38:26] get out of here right well then what do
[38:28] we need to know about it for because
[38:30] it's the Plan of Redemption amen yes
[38:33] sir right amen the seals are the Plan of
[38:37] Redemption we need to know the Plan of
[38:39] Redemption don't
[38:42] we well I'm not a Jew it don't matter to
[38:44] me what they do well then next goes to
[38:46] show you don't know what in the world
[38:48] you're talking
[38:51] about that Devil's done got you by his
[38:53] deceptive point and some false prophet
[38:57] preacher done got in the pull pit and
[38:59] prophesied you brother R said right into
[39:01] it right
[39:03] amen until you believe
[39:05] it believe a lie and be damned about
[39:08] right amen where are we at church
[39:12] right that's all that I'm trying to get
[39:14] you to see all right let's start on
[39:16] number five and just pick up a point
[39:18] kind of where we left off the other
[39:21] day that's what I said we'll have to
[39:24] using the brother sometimes and jump him
[39:26] up on some of but listen we've been over
[39:30] this one but listen very carefully
[39:32] paragraph 190 the second seal now now
[39:36] first then he became a become a f an
[39:40] antichrist but he couldn't be Antichrist
[39:42] only in spirit now what then he becomes
[39:45] an ant come an antichrist and that
[39:48] Spirit took a man that taught the same
[39:50] things that that Antichrist Spirit was
[39:51] doing and then he become a false prophet
[39:54] to the Antichrist Spirit right right
[39:58] and finally he becomes a beast now wait
[40:01] we'll get in that in a after a while you
[40:05] all right now if Satan's Trinity lays
[40:07] like that Satan all the time Satan
[40:09] Antichrist Spirit
[40:11] watching Antichrist Spirit
[40:14] incarnate false prophet then he becomes
[40:18] the Beast all right see and when not a
[40:21] demon that was in the Antichrist right
[40:25] he's emphasizing it y the Beast is not
[40:29] just a demon that was in the
[40:32] Antichrist the Beast is what but when
[40:35] Satan himself is kicked out he comes
[40:37] down and takes over the place where the
[40:39] demon
[40:40] was the devil then yeah then the devil
[40:43] is Incarnate in a man it's just
[40:46] repeating
[40:48] itself incarnate in a man not just a an
[40:51] antichrist Spirit
[40:53] right you understand the emphasis that
[40:56] he's making yes it'll come to a place
[40:58] one day until that man won't be just a
[41:04] demon it'll be the Devil Himself amen
[41:08] that's right y he'll be incarnate in a
[41:11] man that's right he'll be the man of
[41:14] sin
[41:16] y Satan incarnate right why because we
[41:20] said the other day he can't
[41:22] create so he has to use something else
[41:25] that's right so he use the Beast and the
[41:27] Garden to get this thing messed up right
[41:30] so what it's going to be in the end to a
[41:32] man who has so totally
[41:36] yielded y until he becomes Satan
[41:39] incarnate
[41:42] amen well
[41:45] now like I said you say well well now
[41:48] you shouldn't throw off on these
[41:49] brothers or these people that's
[41:53] that I wish the devil could get saved
[41:56] right
[41:58] but I'm certainly not going to pity
[42:00] patter with it right you
[42:03] know I mean if he's the Devil he's want
[42:05] to be a devil he took that choice he
[42:08] made the choice all
[42:10] right then let him be what he
[42:14] is you be the devil incarnate yes and
[42:19] we'll read in a minute we've been over
[42:20] where brother said that beastly
[42:23] heart but brother look how good they do
[42:25] look what they've done here look like
[42:27] just done there I said Antichrist Spirit
[42:30] still riding
[42:34] right but look at the millions they put
[42:36] to death right amen and that's brother
[42:39] brand will'll read again in a minute
[42:40] where he said what and billions
[42:42] spiritually right right that's right
[42:45] amen
[42:47] amen and you're not against that right
[42:50] no we're not against people huh right
[42:55] no this that that pope of Rome I don't
[42:58] have any problems
[42:59] with he's a good
[43:02] man no doubt his life might be a better
[43:04] life than our
[43:06] life
[43:09] right but still he's
[43:14] deceived hell's going to be full of good
[43:16] people amen that thought they were going
[43:19] to heaven that's
[43:22] true but think on this
[43:25] now see not a demon that was in the
[43:28] false prophet he's emphasized it's not
[43:31] just a demon it's not just something
[43:33] coming down anointing upon people
[43:36] right when this comes to the
[43:40] Beast there stands the Devil Himself
[43:44] right you can only see the outside man
[43:48] which would be one of the
[43:51] popes right right mhm because you don't
[43:54] see God either that's right yeah to see
[43:57] him in Jesus Christ right amen so he's
[44:01] copying after or typing after Christ
[44:04] amen so he's coming forth in the end
[44:06] time to be a deceiver Y and he's
[44:09] deceived the whole
[44:12] world not just part of the world the
[44:14] whole world you remember Satan come to
[44:16] Jesus and offered him all of the
[44:18] governments of the world did he leave
[44:20] any
[44:24] out my mother-in-law she said one time
[44:27] said but Sam said we're a Christian
[44:30] Nation God's not going to let that
[44:32] happen to
[44:33] us well that was her
[44:37] understanding cuz that's the way they're
[44:39] Tau
[44:40] right but you see it's it doesn't matter
[44:43] how good the thing is it's what is
[44:45] behind it right you
[44:49] know mean they make medicine today
[44:51] tastes real good the best they
[44:53] can but it can kill you that's right but
[44:57] short tastes good going down well in the
[44:59] old days you had the the parag Gars and

[45:06] that we had to take you had a cro and CW
[45:09] for like what I have a lot of times you
[45:11] just best thing to do was to take a
[45:13] little kerosene and pour it over some
[45:15] sugar and just swallow it down and let
[45:17] it burn out everything that was
[45:19] there well at least now they got a cough
[45:21] drop you know put it in and it
[45:25] helps but see it's deceiving it's death
[45:28] all alone amen that's right all right
[45:30] look what he says now about this Pale
[45:34] Horse now remember the reason he's
[45:38] pale is because he's got everything
[45:43] mixed together
[45:45] right all the powers are mixed together
[45:50] y all of the white the red the black is
[45:53] mixed together that's right right
[45:57] that's why it turns out to be pale right
[46:01] amen and who would want anything my wife
[46:05] will be going down the road sometimes
[46:06] she'll look at the house you say why in
[46:09] the world do them people paint that
[46:10] house that
[46:13] color I it cuz they wanted
[46:16] to I mean yeah I don't care if they like
[46:20] purple or blue or you know mint green or
[46:24] something I
[46:25] mean but what about nobody wants
[46:28] anything to be pale right right right
[46:33] cuz what is that
[46:35] representative a sickly
[46:37] thing you tell somebody they pale
[46:40] looking yeah you tell them they're dark
[46:42] looking they said well I've got a sun
[46:45] toown you tell them this out of the
[46:47] other but if you tell them they're pale
[46:49] looking don't matter where I've seen it
[46:51] and all and that's what I asked brother
[46:52] collie one time I said how do y'all tell
[46:54] them kids is sick
[46:57] he said we get bail
[47:00] too okay all right you know cuz
[47:06] anything's pale looking is sick right
[47:10] always who would want
[47:12] anything
[47:14] sickly right and why would we want a
[47:17] church system that would be sickly right
[47:21] amen
[47:23] amen now the Bible speaks of the Prophet
[47:27] speaks of that we need to be what H hot
[47:34] right warm water make you sick at your
[47:37] stomach right but you're definitely not
[47:40] going to drink hot water unless you got
[47:42] some coffee of
[47:45] tea so the Bible speaks of being not
[47:49] that we're not hot and we're not cold
[47:53] right is that let you see right
[47:55] y it's not white it's I mean it's not
[47:58] hot and it's not cold right it's in the
[48:01] middle sickly
[48:04] y all right so this is described as
[48:07] sickly thing but we're going to see in a
[48:09] minute that it's death
[48:12] yes and what causes a person to change
[48:16] colors in their facial
[48:19] features well they're sick at your
[48:21] stomach they're sick at this or that the
[48:23] other right and you know what that
[48:24] really is that's death right amen you've
[48:27] heard the old saying is you know you
[48:29] look so pale and sickly you look like
[48:30] death warmed
[48:32] over that just simply means you're still
[48:34] kicking heart's
[48:36] beating but think about
[48:38] it a sickly pale thing mix everything
[48:43] together yep but even after you mix it
[48:46] together get my point I bring a while
[48:48] ago all the governments of the world are
[48:50] mixed together right y but yet they're
[48:54] killing each other right amen and every
[48:57] one of them control by the same devil
[49:04] right but you see it's going to take a
[49:06] devil then now I don't mean that a devil
[49:10] it's going to take the
[49:13] devil and his personification in the
[49:16] Beast right to bring all of these
[49:19] governments together right
[49:23] amen M you don't see the deceptive of of
[49:26] it now you don't see the things even in
[49:28] America you know don't say nothing about
[49:32] nobody hate
[49:36] crime don't say nothing about nobody oh
[49:39] yeah but we might not agree with the way
[49:41] they do but we're not going to say
[49:43] anything about it we'll read you after a
[49:46] while we get to it the prophet
[49:50] said that that's the deception right
[49:54] that's
[49:55] it that's the that we're living y m but
[49:58] somebody se's got to bring all these
[50:00] governments now you look at it we we'll
[50:02] get to it the Lord willing this
[50:03] afternoon on the Armageddon and the
[50:05] things and that's where I'd like for you

[51:04] their protest right they're getting
[51:06] alone we're supposed to be the only
[51:08] protesters amen the Protestants y well

[51:15] that in World War
[51:16] I that the Germans had in God we trust
[51:19] on their belt buckle
[51:29] brother R said them Russian soldiers
[51:31] standing there weeping when that person
[51:34] was raised from the dead and sick and
[51:35] heal said we'll serve a god like that
[51:38] right oh
[51:40] yeah all of those countries at one time
[51:42] were religious I'm talking about
[51:44] Christian
[51:47] countries what are we
[51:49] doing see he's a mixed up go to number
[51:53] seven brother I call the number just go
[51:55] and jump up a where you going okay
[51:58] number seven paragraph
[52:01] 197 of the second seal excuse me for
[52:07] SE notice the Antichrist was on a pale
[52:10] horse mixed color horse is a beast that
[52:13] represents the power his power is all
[52:15] mixed up y now look at his power
[52:19] yeah it's
[52:22] political is it's National Power
[52:27] it's religious Powers
[52:30] yep it's demon powers
[52:34] yep so every country in the world United
[52:37] States or
[52:39] whatever is controlled by those four
[52:42] things
[52:44] right and you'd wonder why he would even
[52:46] use it to say politicals then use it
[52:48] national
[52:50] Powers we look at them now One World
[52:54] Government y right
[52:57] right we already have the UN the
[53:00] soldiers the world we sended them to the
[53:02] world to police the world right y called
[53:05] a un y
[53:09] amen that was set aside to word that
[53:12] they was going to have no more Wars that
[53:13] claimed World War II was the last war
[53:16] that was to be done and they were going
[53:17] to get together and make a one
[53:20] world
[53:21] Army but everybody would commit so many
[53:24] people to that army
[53:28] and so much
[53:29] money and as they did then they would
[53:31] wind
[53:33] up policing the world that even if your
[53:37] own country started doing something that
[53:40] that police force had a right to come
[53:41] into your
[53:43] country right and demand for you to
[53:45] straighten it
[53:47] up now they're talking about a One World
[53:50] Government everything so it's got to get
[53:52] the stage you set you got to get all
[53:54] these governments that agree right
[53:58] he said well they're not going to never
[54:00] agree well they will when the head man
[54:01] says it right
[54:04] amen you know right
[54:07] amen true when they say like I was
[54:09] talking about the other day you go up
[54:10] there now and they don't like you and
[54:12] they just Mark your name off of that
[54:14] computer system and you no longer
[54:19] exist oh you can holler and scream I
[54:21] born on a certain day but they don't
[54:23] have any records of you being ever born
[54:25] or anything so they could just
[54:27] annihilate you in a
[54:28] hurry and then they can say that you you
[54:31] don't have no social security card you
[54:33] don't have no no records or nothing you
[54:35] don't get no money and and you don't
[54:40] exist so you can't buy our
[54:47] s big boy's going to take over ain't he
[54:50] right every government is under his
[54:53] control right right
[54:58] now to illustrate then we believe the
[55:02] holy spirit is powerful enough to be
[55:04] able to control right
[55:06] amen but just remember
[55:09] Satan is very close right he can control
[55:13] every people in the
[55:16] world everybody has got a
[55:19] hotline not to Lula
[55:25] Georgia put to work every government's
[55:29] got a hotline we got a nice one up there
[55:31] you know little red telephones and they
[55:33] got black telephones and they got hooked
[55:36] up to
[55:37] who the Vatican right sure you remember
[55:42] the article that who done away with
[55:45] Communism Reagan and the pope was in the
[55:49] newspapers
[55:53] magazines see they run their arms raced
[55:55] and pushed to work that they would break
[55:58] the country and if they had demanded the
[56:01] payment that day of our national debt we
[56:03] would have been busted just like
[56:05] everything
[56:09] else see we're going to find out one of
[56:11] these days the whole world of control by
[56:13] one person
[56:16] right right and they sure are fighting
[56:19] it out with each other because you know
[56:21] there is tales that this Pope today is
[56:24] going to die before the end of the year
[56:26] yeah because even their own records
[56:28] claim that it is but that's all right I
[56:30] don't know I don't read their records
[56:33] none of my business
[56:37] right you
[56:40] see that's all the deception to try to
[56:43] keep you and I fallowing after some
[56:47] something instead of following the
[56:51] word that's
[56:53] right you want to know what the what
[56:56] about the world is going to have read
[56:57] The Prophet's message there's no need of
[56:59] reading the government they're not going
[57:00] to tell you the truth anyway
[57:04] amen one day you got plenty of
[57:07] oil they raiseed the price of
[57:10] gasoline the next day you don't have any
[57:12] oil and they raise the price of
[57:17] gasoline I I don't understand that but
[57:21] it's all right listen
[57:24] church it's what what your Prophet had
[57:27] to say right not what so and so says or
[57:31] anybody says or what they print the
[57:34] newspaper
[57:36] right who was it
[57:40] oh I won't call his name but one of
[57:42] those big men way about years ago I
[57:43] remember that he was a head of one
[57:46] government over there and and this man
[57:48] come in and told him
[57:50] said we're in we're in a uh uh an
[57:53] economical crisis in the government
[57:57] he said who give you the right to call
[58:00] it
[58:03] that I think he had to guy
[58:06] killed but I know that he said who give
[58:09] you the right I'm the head of the
[58:13] country well the man was just telling
[58:15] him what was going on but see he was
[58:17] telling him you don't come in here and
[58:19] tell me that our government is going
[58:22] down well because he was bigger than the
[58:24] government
[58:27] right listen
[58:30] Church political Powers demon powers
[58:33] National
[58:38] Powers but he's still described as a
[58:40] sickly looking thing right amen sickly
[58:45] looking
[58:47] situation cuz there's no
[58:51] hopes
[58:52] right we don't have any instant peels to
[58:55] be able to go ahead with number number
[58:58] eight brother we don't have any instant
[59:00] peels to be able to you know give them
[59:03] to people to make them feel
[59:06] better it takes a Rejuvenation every how
[59:08] you stay of sales in your body to bring
[59:10] your body back into do it well there's
[59:12] nothing you can do for this
[59:16] government what 40 something years ago
[59:20] when the prophet of God said you could
[59:21] put a George Washington in every office
[59:24] about the country yeah
[59:28] right and he said you can't pull it out
[59:35] yeah he says you're paying taxes at 40
[59:39] years from now before to be paid for
[59:41] that's right well how much is it
[59:44] now
[59:48] right what are we setting in the
[59:51] government but it's controlled by what
[59:53] now what I want you to get the point cuz
[59:55] this is the the message
[59:59] Point even though it's political
[1:00:01] National all kind of thing it's
[1:00:04] controlled by religious power right
[1:00:07] that's right amen
[1:00:09] right religious power deals with Mankind
[1:00:13] in his mind that's
[1:00:17] right like a man told me one day sitting
[1:00:19] in his house and I won't call his name
[1:00:21] but he said if I can get a man's mind
[1:00:24] I've got him
[1:00:26] and I thought you just DeVos your whole
[1:00:29] secret buddy yeah you
[1:00:31] know cuz that's what he was trying to do
[1:00:34] right you
[1:00:37] know one brother said about the man said
[1:00:40] somebody said something about said well
[1:00:41] he'd give away this he said sure you
[1:00:43] I'll give it away too if you'll give it
[1:00:45] back to me you know that was his
[1:00:49] pull but listen
[1:00:54] Church our minds are
[1:00:59] controlled to a degree by demon powers
[1:01:02] that's right yep whether we like it or
[1:01:06] not right amen you can holler all you
[1:01:09] want to that I am a Christian and I'm
[1:01:12] not controlled by nobody but the Holy
[1:01:14] Ghost amen that's in the
[1:01:18] soul that's in the
[1:01:21] soul if you're a newborn Christian we
[1:01:24] still got this old body and spirit out
[1:01:26] here that's of the world that's
[1:01:28] controlled by the world yes if not just
[1:01:32] don't eat no more yeah right is that
[1:01:36] enough yeah just don't eat anymore
[1:01:39] y That's being stupid that's what I
[1:01:42] thought you'd agree
[1:01:44] with but see it's true isn't it right W
[1:01:47] you let the Holy Ghost feed
[1:01:49] you well that's not well okay that's
[1:01:52] what I'm trying to get to that's
[1:01:54] right so all of these things are
[1:01:57] controlling you and
[1:01:59] I do you know that the end of World War
[1:02:04] II they had an ability to be able to fly
[1:02:08] over a
[1:02:10] city and
[1:02:12] electronically program The People's
[1:02:19] mind you don't never read or keep up
[1:02:23] with things
[1:02:25] you remember when the day came that they
[1:02:28] used to
[1:02:30] flash sub lenal messages on the TV
[1:02:35] screens about drank coke drank
[1:02:38] coke and they made them pull it off Y
[1:02:42] and even the man made the point then he
[1:02:44] said what if there they would say the
[1:02:47] pope is God the pope is God the pope is
[1:02:53] God y
[1:02:58] right now to express that in spiritual
[1:03:06] Powers you know that the devil right now
[1:03:09] is telling you this and that and the
[1:03:10] other and it would be great to go
[1:03:12] through everybody's mind that's in here
[1:03:14] right now and be able to express it I'm
[1:03:16] certainly glad I'm not a
[1:03:19] prophet certainly glad I'm
[1:03:21] not cuz I wouldn't want to know what
[1:03:24] you're thinking about amen
[1:03:26] some of you thinking about eating some
[1:03:28] of you thinking about we've heard this
[1:03:29] 49,000 times some of you thinking how
[1:03:32] many points am I
[1:03:36] hitting some are saying what in the
[1:03:38] world are you talking
[1:03:41] about
[1:03:43] right see Satan is controlling our
[1:03:47] minds now if you don't get nothing I you
[1:03:50] know I'll take this
[1:03:51] part death
[1:03:56] is a
[1:03:58] controlling of your
[1:04:01] mind the death I'm talking about not the
[1:04:04] death of that you know dying laying down
[1:04:06] your heart qu beting that's what you
[1:04:08] call death no see Satan is penetrating
[1:04:12] our minds and destroying
[1:04:15] us
[1:04:18] right how many of you prayed before you
[1:04:20] came to church today and ask God to be
[1:04:22] able to reveal things to you right amen
[1:04:28] yes and that's for raise a
[1:04:31] hand be embarrassing wouldn't
[1:04:34] it did you pray for the services
[1:04:37] today for God to reveal his word to you
[1:04:41] right now you think that's my job that's
[1:04:45] not exactly my job you know that's right
[1:04:48] my mine might work on my mind but it
[1:04:50] won't work on
[1:04:53] yours but you see that's why Satan's
[1:04:56] doing and that's
[1:05:00] death that's that sickly Pale Horse that
[1:05:02] we're talking
[1:05:08] about Satan fully on it
[1:05:11] strong the prophet would call
[1:05:14] it in the man of sin as the
[1:05:17] Beast Satan will be fully on his
[1:05:24] throne but what about leading up to that
[1:05:26] and what he's doing
[1:05:28] right
[1:05:30] yep you know that every person that is
[1:05:33] not born again Satan is on the throne of
[1:05:35] their heart right I don't care how good
[1:05:37] they think they are yes or who it
[1:05:43] is if you don't have the new birth
[1:05:46] Satan's on his throne in your heart
[1:05:53] right thank God that there is such a
[1:05:56] thing called a new birth amen that's
[1:05:59] right that can take him off of that
[1:06:01] Throne put him in the right place and
[1:06:03] bring him to that
[1:06:05] point
[1:06:10] right go down to
[1:06:13] number number 14 let's get on
[1:06:20] fist I'm down to number
[1:06:24] 14 because
[1:06:26] see I'm preaching what the quotes are up
[1:06:28] there but today I'm not using them as
[1:06:31] much you've already heard these things
[1:06:34] but listen to what your Prophet has said
[1:06:36] this is the fourth seal now he's talking
[1:06:40] about the fourth riter as being
[1:06:44] death and his name is death listen it
[1:06:48] was not mentioned of the other times of
[1:06:50] this
[1:06:51] riter but since now it's mentioned that
[1:06:54] he's called Death
[1:06:57] for seal causing
[1:06:59] death but under the revelation of the
[1:07:01] line now watch I want to read this close
[1:07:05] but I'd be sure wrote down the
[1:07:10] place not under the revelation of the
[1:07:12] line he didn't call it death
[1:07:16] right called it a by horse rider right
[1:07:22] Antichrist or the first age the early
[1:07:25] age this wasn't revealed the next age
[1:07:27] was the age of the ox which is the Dark
[1:07:30] Age the middle age it wasn't revealed as
[1:07:33] what it was nor the manlike Beast of
[1:07:37] wisdom representing the reformers Luther
[1:07:39] West and so forth it wasn't revealed
[1:07:42] right but in the eagle age the last age
[1:07:46] the prophetic age where there is to rise
[1:07:48] prophetic utterance to whom the secrets
[1:07:51] always come all right now
[1:07:57] the other ages the other combat Beast
[1:07:59] must not have known what death really
[1:08:01] was
[1:08:03] right now they knew about dying and they
[1:08:05] knew about the deception of the devil
[1:08:07] and his Antichrist movements and his
[1:08:09] beings and they could see the killings
[1:08:11] and they could see the thing but they
[1:08:13] didn't call him death
[1:08:19] right cuz just like Luther Wesley and
[1:08:21] him say coming down to specially end of
[1:08:23] th where Wesley and him singing about I
[1:08:25] know it was the blood and all your songs
[1:08:27] is written about the blood why because
[1:08:29] they believe the blood was what saved
[1:08:33] you but we found out by the eagle age of
[1:08:36] what it's not the blood that saves you
[1:08:38] the blood keeps you saved it's the life
[1:08:40] that's in the blood that's what saves
[1:08:42] you right
[1:08:46] right see then when it comes down to the
[1:08:48] end of the eagle is the most important
[1:08:52] part right but I must stop and express
[1:08:56] to that we believe that the you know as
[1:09:01] the the line we believe that was a
[1:09:04] spirit of God Among the
[1:09:06] people then when it was the ox that was
[1:09:08] a spirit of God Among the people then
[1:09:11] when it comes to the to the the L the
[1:09:14] the man that was the you know the
[1:09:17] ministry of God Among the people but
[1:09:19] when we come to the eagle we say brother
[1:09:24] Brown well we thank God for him bring
[1:09:26] cuz we wouldn't have no message we
[1:09:27] didn't
[1:09:29] bring but this is a prophetic
[1:09:35] age you realize that 464 the seal book
[1:09:39] The Prophet said justification s cre the
[1:09:42] baptism of the Holy
[1:09:45] Ghost and God coming in a
[1:09:48] prophet he was talking about a zeusa
[1:09:50] street man the oneeyed black man right
[1:09:53] he was talking about the age yeah he
[1:09:55] said but at the end of the age the
[1:09:56] messenger
[1:09:58] comes read
[1:10:00] it it comes down to where that we are in
[1:10:03] the age of prophetic you go down the
[1:10:05] road you see Eagles on everybody's
[1:10:07] houses this is a prophetic age you run
[1:10:10] for
[1:10:11] office go put in for office you know in
[1:10:15] your
[1:10:17] county but you better not have any
[1:10:20] skeletons in your
[1:10:22] closet because they're going to bring
[1:10:24] them out
[1:10:26] you
[1:10:28] know because they have the ability now
[1:10:30] it's the age of revealing right it's the
[1:10:34] age of making known everything why
[1:10:37] because the eagle age is here for the
[1:10:40] prophetic
[1:10:42] right brother rown come and brought us a
[1:10:45] message but you and I supposed to be
[1:10:47] little eaglet right right man right
[1:10:52] right that's why we're not deceived
[1:10:56] that's why we can't be
[1:10:59] deceived because we're the Little
[1:11:01] Eagles all right in doing that then what
[1:11:04] is death spiritual death right the
[1:11:09] prophet of God said the life plague that
[1:11:11] struck Egypt with spiritual death
[1:11:16] right there was Darkness everywhere but
[1:11:18] in Goan right
[1:11:22] amen he said the life plague that
[1:11:24] strikes a Pentecostal church is
[1:11:27] spiritual death
[1:11:30] right no spiritual death
[1:11:34] Y what about being so alive until
[1:11:38] everything is moving and everything is
[1:11:41] going and everything shouting Glory
[1:11:43] Hallelujah and all of the movements and
[1:11:45] the singing and the worship and you're
[1:11:47] dead yeah
[1:11:53] right that's a deceiving part of
[1:11:56] right I don't see how you can say there
[1:11:59] dead look how they shout Glory
[1:12:00] Hallelujah well that's
[1:12:03] wonderful maybe I wonder sometimes
[1:12:05] around here why we're so dead cuz we
[1:12:08] don't shout too
[1:12:09] much
[1:12:14] amen but the prophet said just make sure
[1:12:17] the way
[1:12:18] you you know you walk straight and you
[1:12:21] come back down after you shouting right
[1:12:24] M that's it's not degrading nobody
[1:12:26] that's just tell it like it is that's
[1:12:28] right amen you can see people that are
[1:12:30] so emotional and so spiritual and all
[1:12:33] but yet you talk to them about the
[1:12:37] word well I don't really think it's
[1:12:40] important for us to understand these
[1:12:41] things well who are
[1:12:48] you you know who are you what are you
[1:12:50] judging any
[1:12:52] about what is death
[1:12:56] see spiritual death is the first thing
[1:13:00] right you to die spiritually that's a
[1:13:03] whole lot worse than
[1:13:06] physical physical death is a horrible
[1:13:09] thing but not like spiritual
[1:13:13] right not especially in what we call the
[1:13:16] religious realm of it because in the
[1:13:18] religious realm people think that they
[1:13:20] are still alive and they're dead that's
[1:13:22] right
[1:13:23] right are you you saying brother Dell
[1:13:26] that only the people of this message are
[1:13:27] alive no I didn't say that and where'd
[1:13:29] you get the
[1:13:36] idea but listen spiritual
[1:13:42] death what about being
[1:13:45] alive but yet still be dead right then
[1:13:49] so spiritually
[1:13:53] dead you go out and tell talk to people
[1:13:55] about the
[1:13:56] word you don't have to get into brother
[1:13:58] rown was a prophet and all that cuz
[1:14:00] ain't no need to doing that I don't
[1:14:01] teach you to do that go out there and
[1:14:04] talk to them about one God and water
[1:14:05] baptism and some simple point that they
[1:14:08] ought not cut their hair or paint their
[1:14:10] face or it's some simple
[1:14:12] thing and they'll let you know real
[1:14:16] quick that they're not going to listen
[1:14:18] to you
[1:14:20] amen because see they're spiritually
[1:14:23] dead right amen
[1:14:26] you try to show the people of this
[1:14:27] message what brother around says they've
[1:14:30] got their own quotes their own ideas
[1:14:32] their own thoughts that's
[1:14:34] right spiritual
[1:14:39] death s in theuse
[1:14:44] dead not mention that his name is
[1:14:47] death anywhere but in the last days amen
[1:14:50] now you remember what I was bringing out
[1:14:52] the other day
[1:14:55] it says his name is
[1:14:58] death the prophet called it it says was
[1:15:01] death in the
[1:15:04] Bible you said but death is not a
[1:15:11] name but remember a noun is the name of
[1:15:14] a person place or
[1:15:18] thing so death is a thing
[1:15:25] so you don't have to write down there
[1:15:27] devil it's dead
[1:15:30] yeah ubod is posted on the doorpost
[1:15:34] right the glory of the Lord has departed
[1:15:39] right what about Cain the Bible says he
[1:15:43] went out from the presence of the
[1:15:48] Lord didn't say God drove him
[1:15:52] out he went into spiritual death
[1:16:00] yeah dead while you're living the Bible
[1:16:03] calls
[1:16:05] it spiritual
[1:16:09] death Y no wonder it's called a pale
[1:16:13] sickly
[1:16:15] horse cuz how much worse could it
[1:16:18] look
[1:16:20] no how much of a time or an hour has
[1:16:23] ever been an hour that it when it looks
[1:16:25] like it does across the land of
[1:16:29] America
[1:16:34] right is there any hopes of this
[1:16:37] governmental situation being able to
[1:16:39] pull it
[1:16:44] out the prophet said the only thing that
[1:16:47] Castro done had any sense at all to
[1:16:51] do he changed the currency right
[1:16:56] y right right brought in all of the
[1:17:00] bonds and the things and just canceled
[1:17:02] them and just bought things with
[1:17:07] checks but when they got to the bank the
[1:17:09] money done been done away with BL R said
[1:17:12] that was the only sensible thing to do
[1:17:14] he said it can't be done in America
[1:17:17] right he said so we got to borrow the
[1:17:20] money from
[1:17:21] somewhere now where are we going to get
[1:17:23] the money from amen
[1:17:26] right like I've always said to you I
[1:17:28] don't mean it's a joke but you say well
[1:17:31] who do we owe our national debt to well
[1:17:33] we just do it to
[1:17:34] ourselves well I I I'll write mine off
[1:17:37] and you want
[1:17:38] to
[1:17:40] yeah how much is it supposed to be that
[1:17:42] you owe me I'll write it off as being
[1:17:46] okay so now you know it's not that we
[1:17:49] owe it to
[1:17:52] ourselves we owe it to the Super for
[1:17:56] Rich y you know that even though Russia
[1:17:59] went and I read this so understand even
[1:18:01] though Russia went back R you know that
[1:18:03] there was more billionaires in Russia
[1:18:05] than in the United
[1:18:10] States

[1:18:24] Swiss bank
[1:18:27] accounts more billionaires than Russia

[1:18:31] Russia being a a third world country is
[1:18:34] being dilapidated
[1:18:36] and you
[1:18:38] know you better remember they were the
[1:18:40] first one to go to the

[1:20:58] tell them oh I know I know that but see
[1:21:02] go ahead it's all right it only speaks
[1:21:05] you remember the last plague in Egypt
[1:21:07] was Death Before The Exodus life plague

[1:21:17] into the Millennium right right and the
[1:21:21] righteous will walk out upon their ashes
[1:21:24] but the ni thing is spiritual death
[1:21:27] what' he
[1:21:29] say
[1:21:31] rejecting the
[1:21:33] word now what is death an angel a eagle
[1:21:37] would call
[1:21:38] it spiritual
[1:21:40] death to reject God's
[1:21:43] word well I've got to right believe what
[1:21:45] I want to that's Constitution not the
[1:21:49] Bible right well you think you're the
[1:21:51] only one that's got it I didn't say that
[1:21:53] why you come up that
[1:21:57] right I've always preached around the
[1:21:59] world there is a bride of Jesus Christ
[1:22:01] to receive the message and preachers
[1:22:03] that will preach it I just keep looking
[1:22:05] for them trying to find them
[1:22:07] amen look at the next
[1:22:12] one Israel in the church
[1:22:14] 1953 listen paragraph
[1:22:18] 56 God then God fixing Moses getting him
[1:22:22] ready and sent out the signs then the
[1:22:24] last sign we taken we taken last night
[1:22:27] was death and we found out that
[1:22:29] spiritual death in the church last PL
[1:22:32] now Church drying up blowing away that's
[1:22:37] right we're living in a horrible time
[1:22:39] how at the church the oldtimers it used
[1:22:41] to be really out of the victory losing
[1:22:43] out dying out letting the blood off the
[1:22:46] mer off the front of the door when I see
[1:22:49] the blood I pass over you look the last
[1:22:50] one but this is the one I like
[1:22:55] there two more Discerning the body of
[1:22:58] the Lord what' you say not Discerning
[1:23:01] the Lord's body many are weakly and
[1:23:04] sick remember the sickly fil horse
[1:23:07] right many are asleep dead spiritually
[1:23:10] dead the last plague that hit Egypt was
[1:23:13] death the last plague that hits the
[1:23:15] church is spiritual death what we need
[1:23:18] today is a spiritual awakening amen A
[1:23:22] Spiritual Awakening
[1:23:25] to
[1:23:27] discernment
[1:23:30] right what is discernment Discerning
[1:23:33] what's going on right we need a
[1:23:36] spiritual awakening did the prophet say
[1:23:38] he'll take those seven unknown Thunders
[1:23:41] bring the bride to a Revival right an
[1:23:46] Awakening wake up the
[1:23:52] bride brother preach done it after one
[1:23:55] time a message on wake up the up the
[1:23:57] bride and brother Mo got up after him
[1:23:59] into the next service and boy you
[1:24:01] talking about all he said was he said
[1:24:03] the brother preached a good message of
[1:24:05] waking up the bride said now let's don't
[1:24:07] sit down and go to
[1:24:09] sleep and he got it for 2 hours from the
[1:24:12] other preachers that was preaching
[1:24:15] about and he was just simply saying the
[1:24:17] man done a good job and need to wake him
[1:24:20] up now let's don't sit down and go back
[1:24:21] to
[1:24:22] sleep but if a prophet in
[1:24:26] 53 would look at spiritual death how
[1:24:29] much more would it be when he would see
[1:24:31] it under the message of the end time of
[1:24:34] the sea Olden time amen he said no
[1:24:37] wonder I was against
[1:24:40] that and see would call it spiritual
[1:24:42] debt look at the last one though what is
[1:24:44] it rejecting God's word this is the last
[1:24:47] one 1965 220 God's chosen place of
[1:24:51] worship paragraph 55
[1:24:55] and now the same is today there is only
[1:24:57] one place that spiritual death cannot
[1:25:01] strike Now read it there's only one
[1:25:04] place that spiritual death cannot strike
[1:25:08] right now if there's only one place it
[1:25:11] can't strike it means it's struck
[1:25:13] everywhere's else is that sensible
[1:25:17] yes all
[1:25:22] right there's only one place said
[1:25:24] spiritual death cannot strike that's the
[1:25:27] word
[1:25:30] right death can't strike the
[1:25:37] word now
[1:25:40] remember his name is
[1:25:43] death he's riding on a white
[1:25:47] horse in Revelations 19 we see Christ
[1:25:51] coming back riding on a white horse
[1:25:57] and his name is the word y
[1:26:01] right yeah but brother Dale the word the
[1:26:04] word word is not a
[1:26:09] name what is a
[1:26:12] noun name of a person place or
[1:26:20] thing and the word is a thing
[1:26:24] if Satan is death and that's his name is
[1:26:27] a thing then life is a thing which is
[1:26:32] the birth of the word now brother randam
[1:26:36] is not
[1:26:37] saying because like I said I gave you
[1:26:40] the quote while ago he said long as it's
[1:26:42] laying on the pages of the book it can
[1:26:43] be
[1:26:46] questioned right but see what the alive
[1:26:49] word can't be questioned Right There Is
[1:26:53] No Death in the alive live word when he
[1:26:55] comes back riding on the White
[1:26:58] Horse that word is
[1:27:03] alive that's not a dead letter that's
[1:27:05] not letters on a
[1:27:09] page that is a group of people who have
[1:27:11] become the
[1:27:13] word death can't follow the revealed
[1:27:20] word why would it be why would you want
[1:27:22] even deal with it right
[1:27:25] the word is
[1:27:28] death I mean if it's not quickly right
[1:27:31] because the scripture says it let her
[1:27:33] kill
[1:27:34] it but the alive word is a
[1:27:38] name I wish I could preach what I saw
[1:27:41] off of that but it just kind of slipped
[1:27:43] away from me because that's all right
[1:27:45] it'll come
[1:27:46] back
[1:27:49] Satan's name is
[1:27:52] death that's his name
[1:27:58] death cuz your name is what you
[1:28:03] are but Christ name is his word amen
[1:28:07] that's
[1:28:09] right is
[1:28:12] alive no wonder it can ride and be
[1:28:15] victorious yes because it's
[1:28:18] alive come on Brothers a live word
[1:28:22] revealed word quickly word is what I'm
[1:28:25] talking about not letters on a page
[1:28:28] right not what your computer can say
[1:28:32] yeah what you got in your heart right
[1:28:36] that's
[1:28:37] alive amen death can only be conquered
[1:28:41] by the revealed
[1:28:43] word are you following
[1:28:46] me death can only be conquered when the
[1:28:49] word is revealed amen right
[1:28:55] you realize what I'm saying that until
[1:28:57] we seen one God we were dead to that
[1:29:01] part that word letters was dead right
[1:29:05] but once it's revealed It's Made Alive
[1:29:08] to you
[1:29:10] right that's why I can stand on this
[1:29:12] message of the hour and declare that
[1:29:15] that Prophet was the
[1:29:18] messenger and it spent my entire
[1:29:20] Ministry basically defending the things
[1:29:23] that looked y
[1:29:26] contrary y right but to show that it's
[1:29:32] noten the revealed word Will Conquer All
[1:29:35] Things amen cuz death can't destroy the
[1:29:37] revealed word amen that's right amen
[1:29:40] there's no battle going to be over there
[1:29:42] in Revelations
[1:29:44] 19 of Us coming back as glorified people
[1:29:49] and fighting the natural people on Earth
[1:29:51] that's what's been taught in this
[1:29:52] message but show it to me
[1:29:56] that's not a battle
[1:30:00] right the battle is going on now right
[1:30:04] amen we're good to it this
[1:30:06] afternoon see there's a natural armag
[1:30:09] getting right under the for
[1:30:12] seal but there's a spiritual armag again
[1:30:15] taking place in your mind and my mind
[1:30:17] right now right
[1:30:19] right and it's battling out right
[1:30:24] and it's Protestants and Catholics
[1:30:26] coming against the word that's right
[1:30:29] right and you're looking at one and I'm
[1:30:32] looking at a
[1:30:33] lot is that okay well said it you're
[1:30:38] looking at one cuz you're looking at me

[1:31:16] seen what it
[1:31:19] was you didn't see it in his early
[1:31:21] Ministry what that death really was
[1:31:25] he said no wonder I've been against that
[1:31:27] all the time right see he's seen
[1:31:31] death they seen a worldly Church system
[1:31:35] that looks so wonderful and beautiful
[1:31:38] with it's sickly and pale
