[17:08] have a um prayer request for my dad by
[17:10] God's grace I had an opportunity my
[17:12] husband he actually had to go out to
[17:13] California last week I had opportunity
[17:15] to stop by try to see my dad it didn't
[17:17] really work out like he didn't answer at
[17:20] the door he was really
[17:21] upset I want him say everything he said
[17:24] he basically just like really went off
[17:26] really went off on us like really really
[17:27] bad I haven't seen him like almost 30
[17:29] years like really so a little time when
[17:31] I was like 15 then I saw him again right
[17:34] after I got married and so it's been
[17:36] like he hasn't really been in my life in
[17:38] 30 years truly but it's been about 24 to
[17:41] almost 25 years since I've really seen
[17:43] him and so he really went off really bad
[17:45] as y all pray for him he's very bitter
[17:47] very bitter in his
[17:49] heart and so you know he wasn't there
[17:52] for my high school graduation it's not a
[17:53] pity party wasn't there for my
[17:54] graduation wasn't there when I got
[17:55] married when I was there no one would
[17:57] walk me down the aisle to be married
[17:58] married and there's a lot of hurtful
[18:00] things that to go through in life but
[18:01] God knows and he just sh me he's my
[18:04] heavenly father over and over again he
[18:05] keeps showing me not to depend on man
[18:08] don't depend on man depend on the Lord
[18:10] Jesus Christ he loves you more than
[18:13] everybody and a couple I mean maybe
[18:15] about 15 to 20 years ago I wrote my
[18:18] grandmother a letter and she does not
[18:20] wish to receive any of us as her
[18:22] grandchildren cuz we're biracial I have
[18:24] Indian black and white in me which I'm
[18:26] very proud of there are different things
[18:28] that I believe are fine with me CU I
[18:30] wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for
[18:32] the way it had to come to pass and um
[18:35] anyway she rejected us as well she never
[18:37] saw her son again she passed away and
[18:40] you know just keeps teaching me over and
[18:41] over again she did receive a different
[18:43] biracial child through one of um my
[18:47] daddy's brother's children she did
[18:49] receive that child so by God's she had a
[18:51] little Mercy in her heart for that I
[18:52] guess but anyway it's pressing forward
[18:56] God's teaching me over and over again
[18:57] depend on him even though it was
[18:59] heartbreaking when we were out there in
[19:00] California it was heartbreaking and I'm
[19:01] still heartbroken now but I'm just God
[19:04] just keeps teaching me I keep getting
[19:05] whooped over and over again I'm your
[19:07] father come to me come to me I will take
[19:10] care of your needs cuz when I was really
[19:12] sad I came home my daughter one of my
[19:15] daughters bought me a stuffed animal it

[19:21] something is there for me I wasn't

[19:27] the Lord for her thank the Lord for my
[19:29] children thank the Lord for my Godly

[30:06] thought we'd go out there maybe we' see
[30:08] him for for lunch I hadn't seen him we
[30:10] saw her last I was a teenager and um
[30:13] things were nice and we had a good time
[30:14] so I thought we'd sit down and talk and
[30:16] have lunch and catch up it didn't turn
[30:19] out that way you know and um so of
[30:22] course you know being human like I tell
[30:24] my wife I said I'm very jealous of her
[30:27] she doesn't believe me I said you you
[30:29] yeah when your heart is bleeding for
[30:31] something else I get
[30:32] jealous I said I need all that heart you
[30:36] know and I'm pretty strong so I say I
[30:38] want all of it don't get sad because of
[30:41] him I give you everything I can give
[30:44] you amen but she's absolutely right only
[30:47] God can satisfy that portion you know so
[30:51] uh just want to thank the Lord certainly
[30:53] this is uh Financial Jubilee Part 12
[30:56] counting the cost
[30:58] and um we we'll go right to the
[31:01] scripture and uh then I'll let you sit
[31:03] down so we'll get started so the
[31:05] scripture says for which of you
[31:07] intending to build a tower sth not down
[31:10] first and cth the cost whether he has
[31:14] sufficient to finish it less happily
[31:17] after he had laid the foundation and is
[31:19] not able to finish it all that behold it
[31:21] begin to mock him saying this man begin
[31:24] to build and was not able to finish Amen
[31:27] Let Us pray precious Lord Jesus we thank
[31:30] you so much father that we can gather in
[31:32] Your Name Lord certainly Lord I've done
[31:35] the part of trying to prepare but Lord

[32:00] center of it all father we love you we
[32:03] appreciate you again bless your people
[32:04] bless this time now in Jesus Christ's
[32:07] name we pray amen you may be seated
[32:10] praise the Lord Jesus
[32:13] amen so yeah throughout this morning I
[32:15] mean it's just been a blessing just to
[32:17] see the Lord just lining things right up
[32:19] with brother Ryan's Sunday school and um
[32:22] he he hit it right on the spot talking
[32:24] about choices you know choices what
[32:27] you're doing why you're doing talking
[32:29] about those big choices of Salvation and
[32:31] marriage amen and saying hey marriage is
[32:34] a sacrifice coming into that and um you
[32:37] know brother Wade coming right on in
[32:38] talking about character as a victory you
[32:41] know we don't realize what we got all
[32:42] those things are right in line with
[32:44] counting the cost counting the cost of
[32:48] everything we do and counting the cost
[32:49] when we talk about financial Jubilee
[32:51] we're going to get into some Hands-On
[32:53] some of the details of getting a plan
[32:57] getting a budget we're going to talk
[32:58] about some of those things but certainly
[33:00] when we talk about financial Jubilee I
[33:02] know being Christians that and I pray
[33:04] that the Lord let you see higher than
[33:06] just this it's much much greater than
[33:08] all of these little things that we call
[33:10] little things but it's so much greater
[33:12] than all of that you know when you look
[33:15] at the scripture says sit down you know
[33:18] Jesus is saying for which of you
[33:19] intending to build a tower sit in that
[33:21] damn first so he's basically telling you
[33:23] to sit down you need to pause you need
[33:26] to sit down take a little time when it
[33:29] comes to decisions that you need to make
[33:31] sit down first count the cost now what
[33:35] does that mean count the cost whether
[33:37] you have sufficient to finish it
[33:38] counting the cost we have to reflect and
[33:40] I thank God for this church because it's
[33:42] not a church that we try to spit
[33:43] everything out and it's very fast it is
[33:45] very training slow to make sure you get
[33:49] it so this scripture count the cost
[33:52] couple things he's talking about you
[33:53] want to think about what what are we
[33:55] counting what are we trying to do okay
[33:58] so what are we trying to do first of all
[34:00] that's two things you want to ask
[34:01] yourself about the what so it's what why
[34:04] and how with what what are we trying to
[34:06] do and what is
[34:09] required okay what are we trying to do
[34:11] and what is required sit down think
[34:13] about it okay then you're going to talk
[34:16] about why like why do we want to do this
[34:18] what's the reason behind it in the first
[34:20] place okay because your what is going to
[34:23] give you those what we call pros and
[34:25] cons it's going to give you the cons
[34:26] like it's our brother said about
[34:28] marriage if I wanted to get married that
[34:30] would be the what I want okay what's
[34:32] required like he was saying
[34:34] self-sacrifice that's something okay
[34:37] that's what required of course we know
[34:39] you need a job you need to be able to
[34:40] take care of your spouse those would be
[34:42] the whats if you think about it that's
[34:44] counting the cost okay why do I want to
[34:46] get married well because I want a
[34:48] companion with me on this journey of
[34:51] life there's another half if God has
[34:53] that for me that's going to help
[34:55] complete the picture of who I am in
[34:57] Christ we're one husband and wife so I
[34:59] want somebody to go with me through
[35:01] life's journey that's going to be the
[35:02] why okay and is that why greater than
[35:05] the cost okay is it greater than the
[35:07] cost that I want to pay well if you
[35:10] think about that why enough it can give
[35:12] you that inspiration for what it is that
[35:14] you want to do okay my wife and I were
[35:17] talking about of course marriage and say
[35:19] had you get older my goodness you know
[35:21] that spouse you don't know what may
[35:24] happen to one and who has to take care
[35:26] of who okay who's going to take care of
[35:29] who so you better treat that man or that
[35:31] wife very good while you
[35:34] together she was letting me
[35:36] know because you don't know no matter
[35:39] how strong you are today it doesn't mean
[35:43] that's going to be tomorrow okay and
[35:45] that wife may have to do things that she
[35:47] never imagined or you never imagine she
[35:49] would have to do for you this is
[35:51] reality okay so how in the world I'm
[35:53] going to treat my wife like she's
[35:54] nothing today because I feel strong and
[35:56] empowered and big when tomorrow
[35:59] everything could change and the same
[36:01] thing so my wife could be like you know
[36:03] what I want a companion with me in my
[36:04] later life I'm going to try to keep this
[36:06] marriage together the best that I can
[36:08] and I'm going to treat her like she's
[36:10] already doing that for me amen and she's
[36:13] going to do the same and we had a great
[36:14] conversation on that why why so that's
[36:17] why we would want to get married now how
[36:19] how is extremely important that's the
[36:21] training and the fighting okay if I'm
[36:24] going to know how to self-sacrifice I
[36:26] need to know how to do that I need
[36:28] training in that area I mean I don't
[36:30] know we both come from broken
[36:32] backgrounds and broken marriages and all
[36:34] kind of things so I don't have all of
[36:36] the skills for the what I want to get
[36:38] married the why is greater but I need
[36:41] training on how to do that amen and
[36:44] thank God for that word that can help
[36:47] train me in sitting there and listening
[36:50] praise the Lord amen so that's just why
[36:53] what and how when you look at this for
[36:56] financial Jubilee
[36:58] Financial Jubilee when we talk about
[36:59] what to me I hear that trumpet sounded
[37:02] brother Bram said when the trumpet sound
[37:04] every man could go free if he wanted to
[37:06] go free if you didn't hear the message
[37:08] before pre-service he said we are free
[37:11] we're Eagles praise the lord we are amen
[37:14] and that's what I want I want to be free
[37:16] in every area of my life that's why I'm
[37:19] bringing Financial Jubilee why because
[37:22] the scripture says therefore if you have
[37:24] not been faithful in unrighteous Manon
[37:26] who will commit to your trust the true
[37:29] riches amen I want those true riches
[37:32] praise the Lord so if I can take
[37:33] something small like money and prove
[37:36] myself faithful in that God already says
[37:39] if I can handle something small then
[37:40] he's willing to give me that additional
[37:44] responsibility of managing something
[37:47] greater true riches amen I appreciate
[37:50] brother Wade this morning just saying
[37:51] are we impressed are we impressed with
[37:54] what God is able to do for us and that's
[37:56] the truth
[37:58] are we impressed amen are you thoroughly
[38:00] impressed that God is able to supply and
[38:03] take care of you and provide these
[38:05] precious promises amen so I feel that I
[38:09] feel that in my heart when it comes to
[38:11] money I feel that with anything that God
[38:13] has given us okay and I have that little
[38:15] note said multiplying what you have been
[38:18] given that's a responsibility we all
[38:20] have been given blessings and grace of
[38:22] God and things like that that started
[38:24] our journey of life and I see that
[38:26] responsibil
[38:28] of building off of that that's what God
[38:30] wants to multiply he's in the
[38:32] multiplying business he gives us all
[38:34] talents your talents could be that you
[38:36] had a Godly parent or maybe you didn't
[38:38] have a Godly parent but maybe you had a
[38:40] home hey that was something maybe your
[38:42] dad worked every day okay maybe your mom
[38:46] was doing something but you had
[38:47] something to start this journey no
[38:49] matter what it was someone else had
[38:51] worse
[38:53] regardless okay and that's just what God
[38:55] chose to give you to start on yes okay
[38:58] but are you impressed yet can you see
[39:01] that as still something you're thankful
[39:03] for Lord I Thank you my dad wasn't this
[39:05] way but Lord I still thank you okay I
[39:07] still thank you Lord I Thank you father
[39:10] because I could have been this way or
[39:12] that way but Lord I wasn't you gave me a
[39:14] start that you chose to give me now Lord
[39:17] what am I going to do with what you gave
[39:19] me to start on Amen so I see that I see
[39:22] that in my own life as I reflect and
[39:25] then when it comes to financial Jubilee
[39:26] it's how and fighting and I see that
[39:28] word that has provided all of these
[39:30] things for us that we can grow and
[39:32] multiply what God has given us amen
[39:35] praise
[39:37] Goden Nehemiah he says and I looked and
[39:41] I rose up and I said to the Nobles and
[39:42] to the rulers and to the rest of the
[39:44] people be not ye afraid of them remember
[39:47] the Lord which is great and terrible and
[39:50] fight for your brethren your sons your
[39:53] daughters your wives and your houses
[39:56] praise God Amen I take that to heart for
[39:59] my own self I'm fighting for where I
[40:02] come from I'm fighting for my dad I'm
[40:04] fighting for my mom I'm fighting for my
[40:06] sisters I'm fighting for my children I'm
[40:08] fighting for the generations that have
[40:10] come before me my brothers and sisters
[40:12] I'm fighting for that and that's what
[40:13] Nehemiah is saying fight fight for your
[40:16] kids fight for your family but remember
[40:18] what I said you have to train you got to
[40:19] know how to fight right okay and that's
[40:21] where the devil wants us to go so fast
[40:23] that we don't know what's going on and
[40:24] we can't keep up and then life goes by
[40:27] but we have an opportunity praise God
[40:29] our Prophet said we have an opportunity
[40:32] that all of the Saints before now did
[40:34] not have we got an
[40:37] opportunity praise God praise the lord
[40:40] we got that opportunity amen but we got
[40:43] to get that training we got to get it
[40:46] and so an Army first in getting ready
[40:48] for battle first there's got to be a
[40:50] select some soldiers they've got to be
[40:52] dressed for fighting they've got to be
[40:55] trained for fighting
[40:58] amen that's bringing you the how what
[41:00] we're doing so you know not just
[41:02] fighting for financial Jubilee but all
[41:03] of these blessings that God has given us
[41:06] amen the last Financial Jubilee it was
[41:08] about fighting fighting training knowing
[41:11] that's that's what you need to be
[41:13] equipped my brothers and sisters you
[41:15] know I come from a a background that's
[41:18] very very difficult for sure and as you
[41:20] hear my wife bring out things and short
[41:22] my sister shared many testimonies you
[41:24] know but we thank God because we still
[41:26] grew up in a Christian home okay but my
[41:29] dad and parents they come from a a long
[41:32] line of history of stuff this is a
[41:35] picture of my dad Becky is not in that
[41:38] picture my sister Rebecca's not there
[41:39] but I'm in my dad's lap there that's my
[41:42] brother and that's my older
[41:44] sister okay sitting there and you know I
[41:47] got this quote why so you say why you
[41:49] know John why you you seem passionate
[41:51] about financial Jubilee well I I want to
[41:53] give you some of that context like why
[41:55] am I why does this mean mean a lot to me
[41:58] right okay well you know my great
[42:01] granddaddy was a slave okay my dad is in
[42:03] his 80s now his dad was 60 something
[42:06] when he had him so his dad was born
[42:08] right after slavery literally right
[42:12] after slavery right you know so his dad
[42:14] my great- granddad was solid in slavery
[42:17] just solid that's what grew up in
[42:19] Hartwell Georgia solid slavery you know
[42:22] and I read this emaciation Proclamation
[42:24] yesterday I said Lord look at this
[42:26] Abraham Lincoln signed this his name you
[42:28] can pull it up it says all persons hell
[42:31] as slaves shall be then then thenceforth
[42:34] and forever free labor Faithfully for
[42:37] reasonable wages amen you know I said
[42:40] look at Abraham Lincoln my goodness sign
[42:43] that thing in amen set my great
[42:46] granddaddy free they tell us my dad told
[42:49] me he said the day he signed this I
[42:51] believe it was a day he said the master
[42:54] who was his name was durett in Hartwell
[42:56] they came in said
[42:58] hey he signed it said he had a heart
[43:01] attack the master had a heart attack and
[43:03] died right there on the spot right there
[43:05] on the spot that's part of the history
[43:07] wow so it it goes way back so my
[43:09] granddad you know coming up and then of
[43:12] course they got right into sharecropping
[43:13] and things like that and sharecropping
[43:16] my if you didn't know what you were
[43:17] doing they would suck you right in and
[43:18] you would be in debt and they would loan
[43:20] you money and now you had to plant and
[43:21] do these things and continue doing all
[43:23] this stuff and you could never get out
[43:25] if you didn't know what was going on you
[43:27] would be stuck forever right it's like
[43:28] they give you a gift and say yeah we'll
[43:30] we'll pay for this today that's going to
[43:32] cost you about you know are season or
[43:34] planning well I I'll take it okay so
[43:37] that's what my my granddaddy came out of
[43:39] sharecropping my dad got it got it
[43:41] together like you know what I'm leaving
[43:43] the South I'm heading to Atlanta hey
[43:46] they businesses up there you know and
[43:48] him and his cousin I hear him and his
[43:50] cousin he said yep we left Hartwell
[43:51] Georgia we came to Atlanta Georgia you
[43:54] know and he's got into a little
[43:55] neighborhood that I was born in but this
[43:57] was early on you know they came was
[43:59] lywood park over there near Brook Haven
[44:01] and my dad came in there and you know
[44:04] that that time you know all the black
[44:05] people living in that neighborhood they
[44:07] was a little bit trying to get their s
[44:08] together drugs had not come in just yet
[44:11] so they was working my dad got to train
[44:13] with this old little guy and learn how
[44:14] to do concrete okay he learned how to do
[44:17] concrete so by the time we came along
[44:19] although he was struggling my dad worked
[44:21] every day he was up hitting it every
[44:24] morning no question you know 5:00 he was
[44:27] up gone working every day never had a
[44:30] problem seeing my dad do that and I
[44:33] praise the Lord so he gave me and my
[44:34] brother that that work habit we learn
[44:37] how to work it was no play now he did
[44:39] not learn how to manage money he didn't
[44:41] know I I literally but he didn't know
[44:43] what to do you they just get it in and
[44:45] come out and that was about all they
[44:47] could do and still had situation come up
[44:49] cuz the car would break down things like
[44:51] that and he didn't know how to manage
[44:52] all this stuff he didn't know how to
[44:54] maybe say let's say maybe be a good
[44:56] husband to a wife he didn't know how to
[44:59] do all those kind of things that was a
[45:00] different season different times you was
[45:02] just firm and hard and the woman needed
[45:04] to listen or that was about it you know
[45:08] you listen or not you know it wasn't
[45:11] like we we a little different in this
[45:12] generation thank the Lord for that right
[45:15] but you know at the time they didn't
[45:17] know all of these things he didn't know
[45:20] that your marriage could fall apart
[45:22] right that's the thing we didn't get
[45:25] that after a while that lady at to have
[45:27] a
[45:28] mind and after a while what you do may
[45:31] not last and you got to deal with it so
[45:35] he faced all that okay he literally
[45:38] never thought any of this would happen
[45:41] Okay so he just figured you work all day
[45:43] and that's enough if that don't satisfy
[45:45] then you got to deal with it you know
[45:46] I'm working you know but that's not
[45:49] enough as our brother was saying you got
[45:51] to come in that marriage sacrificing
[45:53] sacrificing period that's what God wants
[45:57] so it's not because his background he
[45:58] felt like I did much better than my
[46:00] daddy that's how he thought look my dad
[46:03] he he would say my daddy told me
[46:04] sometime he said my dad you know being
[46:05] on the farm and being poor like that he
[46:07] just ran around you know ran around with
[46:09] ladies that was just something you did
[46:11] had stepsons here and there and you was
[46:13] a farmer and the wife at that time she
[46:15] would just stay home so the man would
[46:17] farm and he would be busy and that's how
[46:18] they relieve their stress and pressure
[46:20] cuz they wouldn't serving God okay so he
[46:22] came in like I'm doing better I I'm
[46:25] working every day that's that's enough
[46:27] at this point okay but it's not because
[46:30] the word says it's not the word gives us
[46:32] instruction says love that wife
[46:35] self-sacrifice that wife love it like
[46:37] Jesus loved it and he gave himself you
[46:40] see so those some some of those things
[46:43] at that time you know maybe wasn't
[46:44] talked about as much as they they are
[46:46] now so we grew up in that type of
[46:48] environment coming up so as I said we
[46:52] grew up poor but I saw my dad worked and
[46:54] you know early on you know we didn't
[46:57] have much of anything you know literally
[46:59] my dad the money would come in it would
[47:00] go out okay I remember how much the rent
[47:03] was it was $375 a month and my dad
[47:06] working every day he couldn't come up
[47:07] with all that money wow every day he
[47:09] still couldn't come up with all the
[47:10] money why because he' be paying people
[47:12] he had a business he would be paying
[47:14] people but then he wasn't tracking it
[47:17] right and before you know it taxes and
[47:19] he tried to go to somebody to do their
[47:21] taxes and they you know didn't tell him
[47:22] all the deductions he had so by the time
[47:24] he got to the end of the year like I
[47:26] they say I made this much and I owe this
[47:29] much taxes but I certainly ain't got
[47:30] this kind of money see he didn't
[47:32] understand he didn't have that training
[47:34] to be able to do that you know but we
[47:36] saw something not him not having the
[47:38] money right around us you know we
[47:41] started getting our ideas even as kids
[47:43] because my dad worked hard is like you
[47:45] know what we could we could have some
[47:46] businesses and we did we had our
[47:48] businesses you're looking at it right
[47:49] here this is some of our business it's
[47:51] called the trash can we collect aluminum
[47:54] cans so we would we would roll out
[47:59] amen we would roll out you know Becky
[48:02] Rebecca my brother and sister my mom you
[48:04] know we would head out and man that
[48:06] would be my trash can it was like we
[48:08] would say this mine that's yours all
[48:11] right we're going to work together okay
[48:13] so that's my business right there that
[48:14] means all the cans that come out of that
[48:16] belongs to me brother y'all stand
[48:19] outside you get the bags I'm jumping in
[48:21] I'm going to throw the cans out there
[48:23] you go that's mine said Gary that's
[48:25] yours that's yours and that's what we
[48:28] did so we started saying that God would
[48:30] provide and even in our neighborhood
[48:31] full of drunks and drugs by the time I
[48:33] was born it was drugs and alcohol and
[48:36] all of the men around us pretty much was
[48:39] done they sat on the corners and they
[48:41] drunk and they did drugs and they drunk
[48:44] and that was about it very bad situation
[48:47] and they would take all their cans and
[48:49] throw it out and you would see 20 guys
[48:51] and after a while we started seeing all
[48:52] those cans that we were collecting so we
[48:54] start getting our bags me and my brother
[48:56] come on let's head out and they would
[48:58] throw their cans and we're like okay
[49:00] there money put them in the bag you know
[49:02] they say they would point it out hey man
[49:04] look over there there five over there
[49:07] thank you you know and we would load our
[49:10] cans up you know and they started saying
[49:12] them little boys over there
[49:14] working and before you know it we would
[49:16] take all of our cans and selling and
[49:17] start getting like money 50 60 80 100
[49:22] you know my goodness so by the time I
[49:24] was a teenager we were still doing this
[49:26] we got our confidence up like I don't
[49:28] care if they laugh because they going to
[49:31] laugh but we going to have money so we
[49:33] about to do this and we would do it
[49:36] praise the Lord and the word says He
[49:38] that teth his land shall have plenty of
[49:40] bread but he that followeth after vain
[49:43] persons shall have poverty enough look
[49:46] at that promise even in that type of
[49:48] environment the Lord could prove himself
[49:51] amen so I know the Lord has precious
[49:53] promises for all of us all of us if can
[49:57] overcome and apply ourselves with this
[49:59] word praise the Lord this was proof to
[50:01] me that God can supply in any situation
[50:04] that you're in any situation you find
[50:06] yourself in he can supply that need
[50:10] amen as we talked about last time
[50:12] fighting and we talked about our Prophet
[50:15] coming along and we told the story of
[50:17] this this elderly woman and her son of
[50:19] course he had been providing her with
[50:21] money she didn't know what it was she
[50:23] was rich and didn't know it you know and
[50:26] I want challenge us today I believe the
[50:28] same thing I believe the same thing we
[50:31] don't have to act like the world you
[50:33] don't have to go around all bound up
[50:34] you're rich okay where do you find it in
[50:37] the Bible you just looked it over and
[50:39] thought it was just a picture book or
[50:41] some other true story but it isn't it's
[50:43] God's word you are rich praise God now I
[50:48] don't get so high that you don't see I
[50:51] he telling the story about this sister
[50:53] with money okay we know he's talking
[50:55] about spiritual things but I believe
[50:57] it's all of these things because this is
[50:59] what the word has okay so Us in that
[51:02] neighborhood growing up where we did it
[51:05] was around us tilling the swore working
[51:08] we could come up we could get money same
[51:10] thing that shows me that God supplies he
[51:14] will supply your every need okay he will
[51:17] but you have to be trained to know you
[51:19] have to know how to do it how to get him
[51:22] to act and he's going to act according
[51:24] to his word every time
[51:27] every time every time he's going to act
[51:29] according to it so we have to line up
[51:31] with the word of God if we want to see
[51:34] that we're rich you see and you said
[51:37] well Rich yes Rich financially well you
[51:40] said I don't have it in the bank well
[51:42] God has it in his bank he just hadn't
[51:44] given it to you yet okay he had
[51:46] transferred it to you yet okay our God
[51:50] was able to point out a fish and say go
[51:51] to that fish and there it is so he has
[51:54] it he just haven't given it to you yet
[51:57] he's waiting on something number one to
[52:00] see how we can handle it that's the
[52:01] first thing okay and anything just to
[52:04] give you the little the idea of how God
[52:06] works he's not going to give you
[52:07] anything if you think it's rich is the
[52:10] way we call it but he will gladly give
[52:11] you a responsibility he will glad to
[52:14] give you a responsibility after you have
[52:16] proved that you can handle the smaller
[52:18] responsibility he's a good dad but I
[52:21] truly believe brothers and sisters we're
[52:23] rich we're rich in everything that we
[52:26] have need of on this journey we just
[52:28] have to do it the right way I love this
[52:31] quote this is from a um a Christian
[52:34] Author he says there's a right way to
[52:36] live and it is a hard way it is work but
[52:41] it works and it will save you countless
[52:44] detours in
[52:46] life amen reflect on that quote there's
[52:50] a right way to live and it is a hard way
[52:52] y it is work but it works and it will
[52:56] save you countless detours in life amen
[53:02] see the whole thing behind life is that
[53:06] there is an enemy yes is an enemy okay
[53:10] his job is to make it complicated
[53:14] difficult hard confused until you can't
[53:17] see what's going on that's right brother
[53:19] our brother brought out I like the quote
[53:21] he brought out he says God in Simplicity
[53:23] greatness of God is revealed in
[53:25] simplicity
[53:27] but the devil don't want that so he's
[53:28] there as an enemy to make life
[53:30] complicated okay to make it point to you
[53:33] to take the easy way there's an easy way
[53:36] he's going to always try to point out to
[53:38] you okay but the right way is always the
[53:41] hard way the hard way because why
[53:44] because you need character okay and that
[53:46] quote this morning as well says Hey
[53:48] character is simply simply not made
[53:51] without
[53:53] suffering you know and come to my mind I
[53:56] think about my kids and they're getting
[53:57] older and you know parents we want to
[53:59] come in and just make it easy for them
[54:02] you
[54:03] know you can't come on brother you know
[54:06] then that character if they not
[54:08] suffering you suffering they're not
[54:10] suffering you
[54:11] suffering but they need the character
[54:14] you want them to have the character okay
[54:17] so we can't bail them out all the time
[54:19] and this is some of the things we're
[54:20] going through we're going through this
[54:22] in our journey okay we can't bail them
[54:25] out we can't come in solve all their
[54:27] problems and keep a smile on their face
[54:29] we got to let them go through it and we
[54:31] can pray and that's what we do but some
[54:33] of the suffering they have to have that
[54:36] to learn from their own choices to learn
[54:38] from their own choices and then they can
[54:41] start finding out my that hard way is
[54:44] the right way amen and avoid some of
[54:48] those detours amen amen but the enemy of
[54:51] course on our journey of life not just
[54:53] in finances but he wants us to be
[54:55] ineffective ineffective confused and
[54:58] disarmed that's it even as Born Again
[55:02] Christians disarmed and confused okay
[55:05] and we can see that you can see that
[55:07] tangibly with money you can see it it
[55:10] happens but I tell you what the one
[55:12] thing I do want to say you know
[55:13] especially as we get into Financial
[55:15] Jubilee there is Grace there is Grace if
[55:18] we start applying what God has done
[55:19] there is matchless Grace amen you see it
[55:22] in marriage and divorce as our brother
[55:24] brought out but in every area of your
[55:25] life once you start on that journey and
[55:27] that's what I saw okay coming up I like
[55:29] I said I we didn't know I didn't know
[55:31] any of this n everything I'm talking
[55:32] about I had no clue I just came right
[55:35] out of from where my dad left off he we
[55:37] learn how to work that's about it but
[55:39] soon as I started getting money it was
[55:41] going out the door every money every
[55:43] piece of money I got would just go out
[55:44] the door I that's what I thought you did
[55:46] you got it and you spend it you know
[55:48] what are you talking about saving my dad
[55:49] once told me when I did start learning
[55:51] how to save he said John you can save he
[55:55] said I had a cousin that could do that
[55:57] it was that big to him like he had never
[55:59] imagined anybody could save so he was
[56:01] like wow they was impressed with that
[56:02] you could actually save Say Yeah Dad I'm
[56:05] I'm learning I'm learning so everything
[56:07] I have is the grace of almighty God
[56:09] learning on this journey learning from
[56:12] God and seeing wow Lord you can make up
[56:15] for maybe where we didn't have this
[56:17] training or we didn't have that if I
[56:19] apply myself to that word Lord you can
[56:20] make up and he will in every area of our
[56:23] life and in this day and time he's going
[56:25] to make up for everything that has
[56:27] happened through history all of the
[56:28] trials and the tests that you've been
[56:30] through every single thing that all of
[56:32] the Christians from history has been
[56:33] through he's bringing it right to us
[56:36] right to us and once we get in that
[56:38] channel that Grace will take the rest
[56:41] amen I believe it praise the Lord Jesus
[56:45] all right Financial Jubilee so God's
[56:47] principles we talked about this but I
[56:50] want to reiterate it as we get closer I
[56:51] want to get closer to giving you guys
[56:53] some handson things that you can do amen
[56:56] okay but we got to keep this in mind
[56:58] that God's part he owns it all amen he
[57:00] owns it all and look what this word says
[57:03] the Earth is the Lord and the fullness
[57:05] thereof the world and they that dwell in
[57:08] it okay the silver is mine and the gold
[57:11] is mine sayeth the Lord of hosts that's
[57:14] God saying that it's all his that's why
[57:15] I told you he already got it so you're
[57:17] talking about your dad has all of this
[57:19] in his Storehouse the silver is mine the
[57:22] Gold is mine sayth the Lord he controls
[57:24] it both rich is and honor come of thee
[57:27] and thou reth over all and in thy hand
[57:30] is power and might and in thy hand is to
[57:32] make great and to give strength unto
[57:35] all the Lord maketh poor and maketh Rich
[57:39] he bringeth low and lift it up that's
[57:42] the word of God he controls it he
[57:46] provides it but my God shall supply all
[57:49] your need according to his riches in
[57:52] Glory by Christ
[57:54] Jesus amen but thou shall remember the
[57:57] Lord thy God for it is he that giveth
[57:59] thee power to get wealth amen that's
[58:04] God's word he owns it he controls it and
[58:09] he provides it amen let's say that
[58:12] together just to make sure nobody's
[58:13] falling asleep he owns it he controls it
[58:17] and he provides it glory amen that is
[58:21] the truth that's his part brother now
[58:24] what's our part
[58:27] our part It's God's money you are the
[58:30] manager you are a steward amen whever it
[58:33] is required amen look at that being
[58:35] underlined it's
[58:37] required if we say we're Steward praise
[58:40] the lord we know we know every all of
[58:43] the virtues we know that's a requirement
[58:45] but look what the scripture brings on
[58:46] this about being a steward it's required
[58:49] in stewards that a man be found faithful
[58:54] amen that means we need to get to
[58:56] training and learning and fighting we
[58:58] need to know how to meet these
[58:59] requirements amen and if you can meet
[59:02] these requirements then you will see God
[59:04] in his part okay and you will see him in
[59:06] a small thing that we call money but
[59:09] then you will be prepared to see him in
[59:10] these greater things that's promised to
[59:12] us amen that's our part you are a
[59:15] steward it's God's
[59:17] money our Prophet said someday I'm going
[59:20] to have to answer for every penny of
[59:22] money that's been given me every penny
[59:25] and therefore I know as a steward of his
[59:27] money I'm going to have to answer for it
[59:30] at the day of
[59:32] judgment do you believe it do you
[59:34] believe that he's saying he's going to
[59:36] have to answer for this God God has
[59:38] given you money don't spend it for
[59:41] things that satisfy not spend it for
[59:43] things that
[59:45] satisfy spend it for things that satisfy
[59:49] amen so we know we need to know the mind
[59:51] of the lord we need to seek him that's
[59:53] why counting the cost means sitting down
[59:55] think thinking about the things that
[59:57] you're doing praying about the things
[59:58] that you're doing okay learning growing
[1:00:02] training and fighting so as a steward
[1:00:05] when it comes to financial Jubilee what
[1:00:07] you need is a blueprint you need a
[1:00:10] blueprint you need a guide you need a
[1:00:12] budget okay you need a budget you need
[1:00:14] to be able to sit down and understand a
[1:00:17] little bit what's going on in that area
[1:00:19] of your life okay and that's called a
[1:00:24] blueprint to the next slide we're going
[1:00:26] to see if this not sure if this will
[1:00:29] play but we'll
[1:00:33] try you know we we'll skip this part
[1:00:36] here but you need that blueprint what I
[1:00:38] want to do I want to take a moment I
[1:00:40] want to go through what I call the money
[1:00:42] guide okay and I want you to to pay
[1:00:45] attention it's it's it's very simple
[1:00:47] okay but if you can see it then I think
[1:00:51] it'll give you an idea maybe of of maybe
[1:00:53] some of the challenges challeng
[1:00:55] challenging areas that you've faced that
[1:00:57] you've had and all of us I mean we're in
[1:00:59] different seasons I I definitely
[1:01:01] understand that okay but we're all on
[1:01:03] this same Journey we're on the same
[1:01:05] Journey but we may be in different
[1:01:06] seasons different seasons of our money
[1:01:09] we got the young people that's coming up
[1:01:10] I got a a 18y old daughter now she's
[1:01:12] working so she's saving her money and of
[1:01:15] course I'm trying to challenge her to
[1:01:16] help her grow but she's she's good at
[1:01:18] saving um each child is different put it
[1:01:20] that way but she is very good at saving
[1:01:23] U then of course you know I'm right in
[1:01:25] that that middle season of life you know
[1:01:27] where it's like okay man hey retirement
[1:01:29] may come you know soon and some of us
[1:01:32] are there you know so you have different
[1:01:35] my dad is certainly in that that age you
[1:01:37] know so all of these things are
[1:01:38] different seasons but you want to take
[1:01:40] it and ask God to show you what you need
[1:01:42] to do for the season of life that you're
[1:01:44] in and how he wants you to handle what
[1:01:46] you have okay because it's not based on
[1:01:48] you having a lot or a little it's
[1:01:50] managing what you do have right okay so
[1:01:53] the money guide you know when it's
[1:01:55] starts out for income right that's the
[1:01:57] first thing typically that happens you
[1:01:59] start getting an income you start
[1:02:00] working okay that's the first thing
[1:02:02] money's coming in the word says prepare
[1:02:05] thy work without and make it fit for
[1:02:07] thyself in the field and afterwards
[1:02:09] build thine house okay so God is already
[1:02:11] putting things in order okay before you
[1:02:13] start building these great things make
[1:02:15] sure you know your work and that's in
[1:02:17] order what are you going to do what are
[1:02:18] you doing you prepare your work that's
[1:02:21] number one that's the
[1:02:23] scripture okay the next thing money
[1:02:24] comes in okay okay as Christians what we
[1:02:27] should be doing is going right to giving
[1:02:29] amen okay we should be paying our tithes
[1:02:31] okay you're making the income you should
[1:02:33] be paying our tithes because God asked
[1:02:34] us to do that he said hey bring in your
[1:02:37] tithes into the storehouse okay and he
[1:02:39] will bless you he said prove it prove it
[1:02:42] so pay your tithes he wants to bless you
[1:02:45] so bring that tithe into the storehouse
[1:02:47] he said he will open the windows for you
[1:02:50] prove it he's saying that okay so you
[1:02:53] can hold him to that if you are doing
[1:02:55] your part if something happens and this
[1:02:57] is what happen this is what got me to
[1:03:00] first start coming to the Lord about
[1:03:02] money because I lost a lot of money but
[1:03:05] I had this I said Lord but I hadn't
[1:03:06] failed to pay my tithes I I've been
[1:03:08] doing that since you got a hold of me so
[1:03:10] Lord it must be something else that I'm
[1:03:12] doing wrong and he said yep that's
[1:03:14] exactly right you are doing something
[1:03:16] wrong so that's the Lord we serve but if
[1:03:18] I wasn't pay my tithe see I would be
[1:03:20] already confused I'd be off the right
[1:03:21] wrong track to begin with so I'm going
[1:03:23] to him he's like well John you ain't
[1:03:25] even paying your ties
[1:03:26] we we ain't even on the same page have
[1:03:28] you counted the cost so count the cost
[1:03:31] of not paying your tithes count those
[1:03:32] costs that should be the first thing hey
[1:03:35] he said it he going to open the windows
[1:03:37] for you if it's not opening then you
[1:03:39] know you can move to another step Lord
[1:03:42] what else am I doing help me help me
[1:03:44] Lord right amen then the next thing of
[1:03:46] course we got taxes they're going to
[1:03:48] jump on there the government says hey
[1:03:50] I'm in it so I like to say hey which
[1:03:52] want you be first you're giving taxes
[1:03:54] hey you should have enough to pay for
[1:03:56] both of those giving in your taxes and
[1:03:59] God and Jesus Christ himself he didn't
[1:04:01] fail to pay those taxes is that that we
[1:04:03] got to give Caesar with Caesar's he said
[1:04:05] it now the next are going to be your
[1:04:07] living expenses okay and that's be your
[1:04:10] houses your cars what are you going to
[1:04:11] do how are you living this is your money
[1:04:13] coming in you've given your tithes
[1:04:15] you're paying your taxes now this should
[1:04:16] be what you have to live on okay then
[1:04:19] the next thing that happened okay
[1:04:22] because unfortunately we got an enemy so
[1:04:23] he jumps right in there he say huh we
[1:04:26] Ain we ain't going to let you go that
[1:04:27] much further we we about to come in here
[1:04:29] and and get involved in this nice
[1:04:31] picture of you earning money thank the
[1:04:33] Lord you can work huh I want a part of
[1:04:35] this you're giving God some you got
[1:04:37] taxes you trying to live uh what about
[1:04:40] me you know pay me a little bit and
[1:04:42] that's where he comes in right with
[1:04:45] debt and now I ask the question is there
[1:04:47] anything left after that you know is it
[1:04:49] anything left any savings anything after
[1:04:52] all of that you're giving your taxes
[1:04:53] you're living and in debt is anything
[1:04:55] left and I like to call that short-term
[1:04:58] money plans you know and that's just
[1:05:00] shortterm you haven't even gotten to
[1:05:02] those blessings of multiplying yet okay
[1:05:05] and that goes on so as we go on down
[1:05:09] further if you can get to that and
[1:05:12] there's savings and things left over you
[1:05:15] can start getting to what I call true
[1:05:17] investing you can start investing
[1:05:20] investing means that your money is able
[1:05:22] to go to those money changers as God
[1:05:24] Jesus said himself and is able to
[1:05:26] multiply okay can you get there with
[1:05:29] your money can you get there some people
[1:05:31] never get there for their entire life
[1:05:33] they never get there and I think that's
[1:05:36] where the superpower comes in superpower
[1:05:39] when you're able to get the true
[1:05:40] investing and now you get to what we
[1:05:42] call the long-term money plans and
[1:05:44] that's where you're investing true
[1:05:45] investing you can start looking into
[1:05:47] things okay without the pressure okay
[1:05:50] and there's many things out there you
[1:05:51] know we listened to a tape this morning
[1:05:53] and our Prophet said a business these
[1:05:54] these false business businessmen and
[1:05:56] systems and things like that he said
[1:05:58] they will go through every effort to let
[1:06:00] you see one side one side to get you
[1:06:03] into it one side of it right okay and
[1:06:06] you don't want to be trying to do true
[1:06:08] investing when you got your living and
[1:06:10] your debt all messed up that's not the
[1:06:12] point that's not the time to do it you
[1:06:14] want to really get to where it's extra
[1:06:15] it's what you got left over that you can
[1:06:18] start saying hey because true investing
[1:06:20] involves risk you could lose it okay so
[1:06:22] you want to be in a position where it's
[1:06:23] like okay I can lose that I'm taking
[1:06:26] care of my living I'm taking care of my
[1:06:27] tithes and my taxes I'm doing all that
[1:06:29] this is extra okay and then at that
[1:06:32] point you can start making some
[1:06:33] lifestyle choices okay when I say
[1:06:35] lifestyle choices that's where you can
[1:06:37] start acknowledging Lord Lord what do
[1:06:38] you want me to do Lord I have this now
[1:06:42] father do you want me to do this you
[1:06:43] want me to do that or you want me to
[1:06:44] stand still for a while Lord what would
[1:06:47] you have me to do you're able to make
[1:06:49] some choices at that point you're able
[1:06:51] to grow a business you're able to do
[1:06:53] more giving and I i' like to say the
[1:06:56] last is what I call Financial Freedom
[1:06:57] this is free to be used by God you have
[1:06:59] trained you're learning how to do all of
[1:07:01] these things okay that is the money
[1:07:04] guide of course that's where you get
[1:07:06] your reward when you get financially
[1:07:08] free means everything is taken care of
[1:07:11] and you're in lineing with God you see
[1:07:12] his blessings you see him there and now
[1:07:15] it's just like Lord I got to wait until
[1:07:17] you show me what to do and that's the
[1:07:19] same thing with all of the precious
[1:07:20] promises that we have that God promises
[1:07:22] to give us we have to get to the point
[1:07:24] just like Jesus Christ himself where we
[1:07:26] said father I only do what you want me
[1:07:29] to do I got all this great power Lord
[1:07:32] but Lord you didn't tell me to go to the
[1:07:33] hospital and let everybody out Lord you
[1:07:35] didn't tell me to do that I'm waiting on
[1:07:36] you because somebody slapped me in the
[1:07:38] face and I got power I'm still waiting
[1:07:41] on you Lord okay I know it's a
[1:07:43] responsibility I can't do what I may
[1:07:46] feel to do I'm going to go and say Lord
[1:07:48] forgive me help me to get this anger out
[1:07:50] of me and Lord I'm not using the power
[1:07:53] that you've given me to curse somebody
[1:07:56] right okay I'm going to look like I know
[1:07:58] nothing and I can't do anything because
[1:08:00] Lord you ain't told me to do anything
[1:08:02] okay that was our Lord Jesus Christ he
[1:08:04] died with that kind of power he could
[1:08:06] have done he I could call Legions of
[1:08:09] angels if I am everything that I say I
[1:08:12] am and I got that character to stop to
[1:08:16] pause to say they crucifying me but I am
[1:08:19] not going to use it because Lord I'm
[1:08:21] going to fulfill why you talk about
[1:08:23] character Lord
[1:08:26] my that's what God's trying to do this
[1:08:28] small thing of money to give us
[1:08:30] character to give us some tools that you
[1:08:31] can restrain yourself okay if you don't
[1:08:34] have it you know you don't spend it you
[1:08:36] don't have it so stand still stand still
[1:08:39] pray said Lord God I it's the devil want
[1:08:41] to make it easy for you to just go here
[1:08:43] or do that but say Lord let me bring it
[1:08:45] to you father help me and watch him
[1:08:49] watch the Lord give him a little
[1:08:50] opportunity yeah give him that
[1:08:53] opportunity
[1:08:55] as I said the devil right within that
[1:08:58] living right there he tries to trip you
[1:09:01] up trip you up you see he never wants
[1:09:04] you to get to that end so he brings
[1:09:06] living debt and he causes this great
[1:09:09] confusion and you see that little
[1:09:10] spinning around it just spins and Spins
[1:09:13] and you're never able to get out that's
[1:09:15] what happened to many many many people
[1:09:18] okay that was sherop and you know for my
[1:09:20] great-grandfather and those kind of the
[1:09:22] system that they had they would get
[1:09:23] caught up in that thing and never get
[1:09:25] out never ever get out that's right okay
[1:09:29] and stuck working working working
[1:09:30] working and can't grow can't train on
[1:09:32] anything okay and that's what happened
[1:09:34] to him but the devil doesn't change so
[1:09:36] he just brings it along in this day and
[1:09:38] time and just say hey I got another easy
[1:09:40] way it's called interest just take your
[1:09:43] credit card or go borrow or do this okay
[1:09:46] and I'm saying I want to say you know
[1:09:48] this pray about those things that's what
[1:09:49] I'm saying each person has to make their
[1:09:51] choices I understand that we all do I'm
[1:09:54] saying pray about it give God an
[1:09:57] opportunity give him an opportunity see
[1:09:59] what he will do you know talk ask you
[1:10:02] know we're not designed brothers and
[1:10:04] sisters to do everything alone we're not
[1:10:07] we're not designed to do it alone no
[1:10:09] okay but we need character all of us
[1:10:11] because sometime it is hey we can pray
[1:10:13] with you we can we can wait on the Lord
[1:10:15] too as well because we have to see what
[1:10:18] the Lord can do and what he wants to do
[1:10:19] in your life but I think together as we
[1:10:22] get that kind of bond and that kind of
[1:10:23] love where we are real we're praying see
[1:10:26] as you get character yourself you're
[1:10:28] able to give that to someone else okay
[1:10:30] not so much give it but you know
[1:10:32] yourself see for example let's say I
[1:10:34] don't drive a Lamborghini okay so I got
[1:10:37] the character not to get a Lamborghini
[1:10:39] so if my son wanted me to get him a
[1:10:40] Lamborghini I got the character I'm say
[1:10:42] no you see it's very easy it's not a
[1:10:46] problem you know if I can drive the
[1:10:49] minan then John you can drive the
[1:10:51] minivan too you know I mean I I got to
[1:10:54] do it you see the character you see or
[1:10:56] you're able to give them that because
[1:10:57] you got strength okay but if I did
[1:10:59] everything I wanted to do and I'm just
[1:11:01] free then he could come and say Dad I
[1:11:03] say well God I can't let him go through
[1:11:04] all this hardship John I got you you
[1:11:07] don't know but I'm gonna let you make
[1:11:08] your choices John I'm going to make you
[1:11:10] make your choices an Melody I always
[1:11:11] tell me you know you got choices you can
[1:11:14] make them you pray about them take
[1:11:16] Proverbs 3 I told were telling that the
[1:11:18] other day y'all take that just
[1:11:19] acknowledge the Lord bring him in every
[1:11:21] decision you're going to make
[1:11:22] acknowledge Him He said he will direct
[1:11:23] your path as you get older Mom and Dad
[1:11:25] can't be with you and make all your
[1:11:27] choices for you we wish we could but we
[1:11:30] can't cuz you ain't going to let us
[1:11:31] either so we better take a step back cuz
[1:11:34] you're not going to let us make all your
[1:11:35] choices so we want to give you the tools
[1:11:38] so you're trained you can make those
[1:11:40] choices and then we let God lead you
[1:11:42] absolutely and that's for each and every
[1:11:43] one of you so as you have questions and
[1:11:45] you have things in challenges in your in
[1:11:47] your life you go to the Lord and pray
[1:11:49] about these things and you make those
[1:11:50] choices prayerfully and regardless if
[1:11:53] you make those choices prayerfully then
[1:11:55] God will train you sure we we're
[1:11:57] confident in that he will train you he
[1:11:59] will definitely do that so that is the
[1:12:01] key to it to any particular situations
[1:12:03] that you have to bring God into the
[1:12:05] middle of it no matter what don't let
[1:12:07] somebody rush you through it now bring
[1:12:09] God in it and then you walk with the
[1:12:11] Lord right amen so the right spending
[1:12:14] plan shines the light on the financial
[1:12:17] path to clearly see how to navigate
[1:12:20] that's what a spending plan will do for
[1:12:21] you amen all right now as we look at
[1:12:24] spending plan I want to kind of give you
[1:12:26] an idea to get a little handson we're
[1:12:27] going to look at Bill and Sarah's Jones
[1:12:30] spending plan all right and this is what
[1:12:33] we had to do as I was growing as I
[1:12:35] looked at my own life and I realized
[1:12:37] Lord God we been paying our ties but
[1:12:39] something is wrong okay so I started
[1:12:42] taking a spending plan and learning how
[1:12:44] can I manage what you've given me I
[1:12:45] thought I was managing it but Lord
[1:12:47] apparently I'm not so what I'm going to
[1:12:49] do so this is Bill and Sarah Jones and
[1:12:52] this is just a a a past of
[1:12:56] and um the employer is work till you
[1:12:58] drop
[1:12:59] employer Lo located on 1 2 3 4 Dead End
[1:13:02] Lane and it's an exhaustion
[1:13:05] Pennsylvania and um Bill Jones he live
[1:13:08] on foreshore tired Lane and help me
[1:13:13] Pennsylvania and the bank is called
[1:13:15] bailout Bank Corp that's it and the
[1:13:18] company hey they'll trade your 16
[1:13:22] 63,000 lifespan hours for Cash
[1:13:25] you can take your life and trade it in
[1:13:27] for cash but anyway so you pull your pay
[1:13:30] stub you you look at how much you're
[1:13:31] making right this person's making $2,000
[1:13:34] bill and Sarah and of course the
[1:13:36] government takes their taxes out and
[1:13:38] they are bringing home every two weeks
[1:13:41] $1600 $1,600 that's what they're
[1:13:43] bringing so you should know how much
[1:13:44] money you're bringing in even if you
[1:13:46] have a variable income you should have
[1:13:48] an idea of what you're bringing in if
[1:13:50] you got a variable income you can look
[1:13:51] at your last year taxes divide that by
[1:13:55] how many weeks or months and you can say
[1:13:57] okay this is what I'm expecting to make
[1:13:59] this year okay so you can have an idea
[1:14:01] of how much you're going to make of
[1:14:04] course those are work again you will
[1:14:05] have a pay up okay that's number one
[1:14:07] know how much you're making okay number
[1:14:10] two what do you owe as far as your debts
[1:14:13] okay do you have a mortgage okay do you
[1:14:16] have cars okay and all of these screens
[1:14:19] that you're seeing here we do have
[1:14:21] copies and we have sheets that you can
[1:14:23] use and they're going to be in the back
[1:14:25] you can take them with you we can get
[1:14:26] copies if you need more copies but these
[1:14:28] are sheets that you can use to list out
[1:14:30] everything that you owe right everything
[1:14:32] that you owe you want to list everything
[1:14:33] out you want to put those interest rates
[1:14:35] and I understand you know some of us may
[1:14:37] not even know what interest rates are
[1:14:39] and what does that mean see interest
[1:14:40] rate is the cost of you borrowing that's
[1:14:43] what it is the cost of you borrowing
[1:14:45] money and the higher that is then the
[1:14:47] more expensive it is to borrow money if
[1:14:49] you have 18% and you borrow $100 if
[1:14:53] something is 18% that means means you
[1:14:55] can get $100 today but if you give me
[1:14:57] back that money a year from now you need
[1:14:58] to give me$
[1:15:00] 118 okay that's what that percentage
[1:15:02] mean so the high higher that is that
[1:15:04] means that's how expensive it is okay so
[1:15:08] put your car loans anything that you got
[1:15:09] you want to put that down and you want
[1:15:11] to start noting your monthly payment
[1:15:13] with a spending plan we're trying to get
[1:15:15] how much I'm bringing in and how much is
[1:15:16] going out okay remember all work works
[1:15:21] so you got to work this you got to put
[1:15:23] it down you got to get it in writing and
[1:15:25] if you got some easier way to write it
[1:15:26] down get a napkin piece something let's
[1:15:28] get this stuff down out of your head
[1:15:31] okay and that's good for any spouse get
[1:15:33] it down so you both know what's going
[1:15:36] on okay what you owe you may have some
[1:15:38] Bank overdraft charges that you owe you
[1:15:40] may have some Hospital expenses you may
[1:15:42] have some credit cards why did I do it
[1:15:44] credit card that I did it you may have
[1:15:46] some money that you borrowed from the
[1:15:47] family that you thought you going to
[1:15:49] never pay back but as Christians guess
[1:15:51] what you got to put it down you got to
[1:15:55] put it down and start talking I know
[1:15:57] it's hard but get everything out you
[1:15:59] want to get this stuff out of your head
[1:16:00] what do I owe what do I owe on this
[1:16:02] journey because we want to clean this
[1:16:04] thing up remember our Prophet said clean
[1:16:05] up your lives pay your debt so we're
[1:16:07] doing that you're bringing it down
[1:16:09] you're bringing it to paper to put it
[1:16:10] down you're writing it down okay then
[1:16:13] the next now you want to put it on a
[1:16:15] spending plan again we have sheets these
[1:16:17] sheets like this and this is where
[1:16:18] you're going to write down all of these
[1:16:21] categories everything that you spend
[1:16:22] money on should be able to fit in these
[1:16:24] categories how much you earn your salary
[1:16:27] your ties how much you're paying your
[1:16:29] taxes you can get that off your past du
[1:16:30] or your last year taxes and divide it by
[1:16:32] the same amount your rent mortgage all
[1:16:35] those things your water bill your house
[1:16:39] all those things you want to have listed
[1:16:41] your gas how much do you estimate that
[1:16:42] you're spending a month okay any
[1:16:44] payments you have that listed in there
[1:16:46] all of that's going to be there okay
[1:16:49] eating out how much do you eat out okay
[1:16:52] that's very important people do that a
[1:16:53] lot your lunches your snacks any
[1:16:56] subscriptions of course we got Netflix
[1:16:58] we always talk about around here that
[1:16:59] add and in you know they were saying I
[1:17:01] read something the other day it said
[1:17:03] people the average subscription cost now
[1:17:05] that people are spending is about $200
[1:17:07] and something dollars a month that's
[1:17:09] Hulu Netflix Disney plus Amazon Prime
[1:17:12] you name it so it's about $212 a month
[1:17:15] but you want to list everything that
[1:17:17] you're spending have that listed here on
[1:17:20] this
[1:17:21] sheet and ultimately you'll come up with
[1:17:24] a ending amount is going to be
[1:17:26] everything that's coming in minus what's
[1:17:28] going out okay and you're going to
[1:17:30] either be over or under that's it okay
[1:17:34] and this is what we call estimate you're
[1:17:35] just pulling it out of your head what
[1:17:36] what do you have putting it on paper
[1:17:38] getting some idea of what's going on
[1:17:40] okay then the next thing you want to do
[1:17:42] is go and look at the actual try to get
[1:17:43] it as close as you can pull those bank
[1:17:45] statements look at it write it down okay
[1:17:49] you want to get it as close as you can
[1:17:50] to what's happening after this this
[1:17:52] person that were spending about $500 $75
[1:17:56] over
[1:17:57] $575 over a month you say how world is
[1:18:01] that possible well again the devil has
[1:18:03] made everything so complicated we got
[1:18:05] credit cards we got these things that we
[1:18:06] use and all of a sudden we're just
[1:18:09] assuming we don't know
[1:18:11] anymore okay hearing about a young guy
[1:18:13] he was making $15 an hour and he didn't
[1:18:16] know where his money was going so I said
[1:18:18] well well uh what's your rent he was
[1:18:20] saying I get about 2,000 a month my I'm
[1:18:22] only renting a room it's 500 $ a month I
[1:18:26] said well where's the other money it's
[1:18:27] $1,500 left well I I don't know it's
[1:18:30] like it may be some
[1:18:31] gas that's what
[1:18:34] happens
[1:18:36] just but guess what even at $15 an hour
[1:18:39] 100,000 200,000
[1:18:45] is well write it down write it down all
[1:18:50] right but anyway they were spending
[1:18:52] $575 over a month
[1:18:55] some of the work is sitting down and
[1:18:57] mastering your money making decisions
[1:18:59] once you get it on that sheet you need
[1:19:01] to balance that that means you need to
[1:19:03] make choices and so that you're not
[1:19:05] spending more than what's coming in okay
[1:19:09] and look at everything so they went
[1:19:11] through and oh they realized they
[1:19:12] weren't paying all of the ties that they
[1:19:13] should so they increased their ties okay
[1:19:16] they started saying man if we're making
[1:19:17] about 50,000 that's how much they were
[1:19:19] making with this 50,000 you know then
[1:19:22] hey they should be able to save
[1:19:23] something so they squeeze and said we
[1:19:25] can at least save $21 a month but that
[1:19:27] was a start we can increase our credit
[1:19:29] cards we can increase the payments that
[1:19:30] we're doing by $10 they say hey we can
[1:19:32] use less electricity we can turn off the
[1:19:34] lights hey these are all things we had
[1:19:36] to do my wife and I had to do this we we
[1:19:38] were trying to squeeze because we were
[1:19:40] out of control with this business loss
[1:19:42] and squeezing everything reduce
[1:19:45] telephone options you can look at that
[1:19:47] say do I need all the cell phone plan
[1:19:49] they got some choices you can make hey
[1:19:51] make some choices other things in the
[1:19:53] house we could do groceries we could
[1:19:55] drop some of that reduce eating out okay
[1:19:58] you can drop some of those subscriptions
[1:20:00] drop Netflix put that on there for
[1:20:02] anybody who's struggling amen you can
[1:20:05] reduce some clo clothing allowance gifts
[1:20:09] you know husband allowance you can drop
[1:20:11] that husband you can sacrifice wife
[1:20:13] allowance leave that as is if you're
[1:20:14] smart children allowance you can drop
[1:20:18] that hey these were things we literally
[1:20:21] had to do we had to do this I had to put
[1:20:23] it on paper and start making some
[1:20:25] choices and we would go through and I
[1:20:27] would say oh well gosh but if you get it
[1:20:30] in those categories once you do it
[1:20:32] you're getting very close to getting
[1:20:34] some control okay and God wants us to
[1:20:37] have control he wants us to be able to
[1:20:38] master the money that he's given us and
[1:20:40] this is stewardship you see it's it's
[1:20:42] work this is stewardship you're making
[1:20:45] those choices okay and they made those
[1:20:48] choices before they were spending
[1:20:52] $575 more over spending after they
[1:20:55] balanced it they were spending what they
[1:20:57] brought in by making those choices and
[1:20:59] you can see some of those were simple
[1:21:00] some of them were difficult choices but
[1:21:02] they could make those choices and
[1:21:03] balance that
[1:21:04] budget all right once they balance the
[1:21:07] budget now you got the balanced budget
[1:21:09] as you see listed
[1:21:10] here and they're balanced okay now what
[1:21:14] I want you to see and and this is really
[1:21:16] what what what started happening for me
[1:21:19] after I balanced my budget I got Balan
[1:21:21] and and this doesn't have to take long
[1:21:23] you just got to get it on paper you got
[1:21:24] to get it down on paper that's the start
[1:21:26] get it down but once I got balanced okay
[1:21:30] and we're going to talk about how do you
[1:21:31] control that balance because that's
[1:21:32] that's part of the problem we we lose
[1:21:34] that control but how do we control it
[1:21:36] but once I got Balan and I started
[1:21:38] looking at every line item now because
[1:21:40] I'm like my goodness I'm balanced okay
[1:21:43] everything coming in is still going out
[1:21:44] but I've given it a home I've given it
[1:21:46] something and I started saying okay well
[1:21:47] you got I got this car payment that's
[1:21:49] here that's 307 so man before I was 575
[1:21:53] spending more for okay and now this auto
[1:21:57] payment is still there so man if I got
[1:21:59] rid of that that's all of a sudden I'm
[1:22:02] not in the negative anymore I would have
[1:22:05] 307
[1:22:06] extra huh and if I didn't have these
[1:22:09] credit card loans credit card payments
[1:22:11] and things like that 180 1050 my
[1:22:14] goodness wow I I would be 500 and
[1:22:18] something over instead of under I would
[1:22:21] be over if I just counted the cost
[1:22:25] [Music]
[1:22:27] my before 575 after if I got rid of the
[1:22:32] debt I would have
[1:22:33] 548
[1:22:35] over and that's that's exactly what it
[1:22:38] is you say well that's simple that's it
[1:22:41] but the devil is hidden in that so you
[1:22:43] can take someone in this situation if
[1:22:46] they can apply that character they can
[1:22:47] flip the script now they have 540 extra
[1:22:51] okay so you see how the money guide
[1:22:53] would get this person to where they can
[1:22:54] move on to True investing right but
[1:22:57] along the way right they had to make
[1:22:58] some sacrifices that mean they paid off
[1:23:00] the loans they didn't get another loan
[1:23:03] okay they didn't go right back into the
[1:23:05] same thing that they came out of they
[1:23:07] paused and got out of something and
[1:23:10] didn't go back and that's what we have
[1:23:12] to do that's the character that we
[1:23:16] need so just repeat what we just said so
[1:23:19] number one you got to create your
[1:23:20] estimated spending just try just try to
[1:23:23] get something down writing I think this
[1:23:25] is important for anybody just to get it
[1:23:27] down what's coming in what's going out
[1:23:29] what's your estimate what do you think
[1:23:32] okay once you do that then try to prove
[1:23:34] it try to see the actual pull your bank
[1:23:36] statements your credit card statements
[1:23:38] track your expenses for 30 days if you
[1:23:40] want those are all options but how would
[1:23:42] you take something that you kind of
[1:23:44] estimated you want wanted to estimate
[1:23:46] okay how much you make and you would say
[1:23:47] well I think I make you know let's say I
[1:23:49] I think I make
[1:23:51] $2,500 every two weeks well then I said
[1:23:54] good that's a great estimate now go
[1:23:55] prove it well go get your bank statement
[1:23:58] or your check stub and say oh it was no
[1:24:00] it's it's
[1:24:02] 2100 Oh I thought it was too that's what
[1:24:05] you need to do prove it okay my electric
[1:24:07] bill I kind of estimate it's probably
[1:24:09] around you know 185 a month huh now last
[1:24:13] month it was
[1:24:15] 375 okay get those actual expenses and
[1:24:18] build that plan okay that give you your
[1:24:20] actual and then work to balance that if
[1:24:23] you see that you're over what's coming
[1:24:24] in then you need to make some choices
[1:24:27] you have to decide what needs to change
[1:24:30] so your income equals what you're
[1:24:32] spending that's what you have to do and
[1:24:34] then you create a new spending plan that
[1:24:36] becomes your blueprint what are you
[1:24:38] going to do with that extra that you
[1:24:40] have okay that's your new spending plan
[1:24:42] after you've changed everything okay and
[1:24:45] then you need to do what it takes to
[1:24:46] keep that plan so if you get down and
[1:24:48] you say you know what my groceries last
[1:24:51] month it looked like I spent $895
[1:24:54] on groceries and I was over I'm going to
[1:24:57] have to cut out some of that grocery
[1:24:59] spending okay then you need to do what
[1:25:01] it takes to keep what you've decided you
[1:25:02] need to cut out okay and I like this
[1:25:05] quote said would you rather have the
[1:25:07] pain of self-discipline or the pain of
[1:25:09] regret you're going to have to choose
[1:25:11] one of these methods and decide what do
[1:25:14] you want what do you want through
[1:25:18] this so that's creating that spending
[1:25:22] plan that some of the Hands-On there
[1:25:24] there are copies of those sheets back
[1:25:25] there you're welcome to take it also we
[1:25:27] got Excel sheets I got the same thing in
[1:25:29] Excel I'm happy to share that with
[1:25:31] anybody who wants that if you want Excel
[1:25:33] versions paper versions whatever you
[1:25:35] want and if you don't want any of that
[1:25:37] just try something but at least take
[1:25:39] that start start something that's going
[1:25:41] to get you on this journey okay and God
[1:25:43] will give you the muscles as you start
[1:25:45] something and that's what I love about
[1:25:46] his grace as you start something you
[1:25:48] take that step he takes two you know he
[1:25:51] takes it further when you do it
[1:25:54] always remember you know as you get into
[1:25:56] a spending plan it's going to be no no
[1:25:58] is a very important word that's being
[1:26:00] lost in this day and time but I want to
[1:26:03] remind you no is not a bad word no say
[1:26:07] no say no to yourself so no I'm not
[1:26:11] going to do that you know I'm going to
[1:26:13] wait on the Lord I'm going to trust the
[1:26:14] Lord I'm going to try to apply something
[1:26:16] I'm going to try to train myself because
[1:26:18] remember that's the how I'm going to try
[1:26:20] before I start doing anything I'm going
[1:26:22] to say no the world is full of it
[1:26:24] advertisements and television radio and
[1:26:26] newspapers and if the American people
[1:26:29] fall for such as that that's our prophet
[1:26:32] in the message investment he says full
[1:26:34] of it the devil is good at what he does
[1:26:37] as I said there is an enemy and that
[1:26:39] enemy he's targeting that he knows if he
[1:26:41] can trip us up on the journey then
[1:26:43] that's what he's going to do and that
[1:26:45] prevents us from ever getting to those
[1:26:48] precious things that God has for us if
[1:26:50] you can see it in the little things of
[1:26:52] money think about the greater things
[1:26:53] that God has has for us that's what I
[1:26:55] want us to keep our minds on see this is
[1:26:58] simple simple simple simple just don't
[1:27:00] spend more than you make sounds real
[1:27:03] simple I love it it should be it should
[1:27:06] be that simple if it wasn't for an enemy
[1:27:09] but having a spending plan it helps you
[1:27:11] properly divide your income to meet your
[1:27:13] needs okay take per check you can do
[1:27:15] that you have annual bills all those
[1:27:17] kind of things you need to get that all
[1:27:19] to a monthly level so if you have
[1:27:21] property taxes things that come annually
[1:27:24] they come every time you know Christmas
[1:27:27] gifts is you're a great spender that
[1:27:29] coming again so you need to decide how
[1:27:32] much per month you're putting down it
[1:27:34] helps you see what's coming in and where
[1:27:35] it's going it helps you determine your
[1:27:38] lifestyle can you afford your choices it
[1:27:41] helps you live on what you earn it
[1:27:43] helped you see the true bondage of debt
[1:27:45] it's helped you start to pay off debt it
[1:27:47] it helps you learn how to save helps you
[1:27:49] to properly give not from borrowed funds
[1:27:53] Okay so all of that starts putting you
[1:27:55] into the right frame of mind
[1:27:59] okay simple you know and this is a
[1:28:01] simple plan this is a method it's old
[1:28:03] school but remember if your life is not
[1:28:06] in order in this area of then you need
[1:28:09] to do something differently okay and the
[1:28:13] old school way was you get the cash you
[1:28:15] put it in an envelope take the cash out
[1:28:18] of the envelope when the envelope is
[1:28:20] empty you stop spending that that's that
[1:28:23] was it
[1:28:25] but the devil didn't like that so you
[1:28:26] know what he introduced he introduced
[1:28:27] credit cards and start making things get
[1:28:29] complicated before you know it you're
[1:28:31] like I can't even I can't put it's just
[1:28:34] you can't put it in an envelope you you
[1:28:36] lost track and now you understand why
[1:28:38] you're in the situation that you are in
[1:28:41] okay but you can stop you can say you
[1:28:44] know what I can go back to being simple
[1:28:46] if you're out of control if you don't
[1:28:48] have your finances in order and your
[1:28:50] house in order in that area I would
[1:28:52] challenge you to take this approach
[1:28:55] okay get the cash I know it's old school
[1:28:58] but remember God is in Simplicity okay
[1:29:01] the devil's in the complications of life
[1:29:04] so go get the cash put it in an
[1:29:07] envelope use it for your groceries when
[1:29:10] the envelope is over then you know it's
[1:29:11] over okay you're eating out put in an
[1:29:14] envelope okay your debt payments you got
[1:29:16] kids put that money in an envelope take
[1:29:18] it out when it's done it's done okay
[1:29:21] give yourself that if you have these
[1:29:22] issues there's also ways you can still
[1:29:24] use envelopes and we have these sheets
[1:29:26] this is a sheet that we have and you can
[1:29:28] use it just like a past up a checkbook I
[1:29:31] mean and you can track an envelope that
[1:29:33] way okay you can say you know what if I
[1:29:36] am using credit cards and I am using my
[1:29:37] bank card and all this stuff well you
[1:29:39] can still take this tracker just like a
[1:29:41] checkbook and this is actually what we
[1:29:43] do okay me and my wife we work together
[1:29:45] for many years trying many different
[1:29:48] options many different ways whether it's
[1:29:51] a bank account this and that but this is
[1:29:53] the way she likes for herself so we give
[1:29:56] her like one envelope okay and she gets
[1:29:58] the grocery envelope and she's able to
[1:30:00] say okay every week I know I can add
[1:30:03] let's say $500 whatever that I can add
[1:30:06] that every week and I can just track
[1:30:08] that spending so I can spend and I know
[1:30:10] and then she knows how much she has for
[1:30:12] groceries so if you have envelopes or
[1:30:15] these categories that are challenging
[1:30:16] for you to keep and you losing control
[1:30:19] you can do that so let's say you're
[1:30:20] control with everything else you can
[1:30:22] take one envelope right okay or you
[1:30:24] might say well I can take two or let's
[1:30:26] say your husband he may have a a hunting
[1:30:29] envelope and you're like this is yours
[1:30:31] every week you're welcome to add 250 to
[1:30:33] it you know brother waade I'm
[1:30:39] just but that that's how simple it is
[1:30:42] every week you can add 250 so if you
[1:30:44] don't haven't spend it then you know
[1:30:46] okay two weeks from now I got 500 you
[1:30:48] could do it that's how simple it is okay
[1:30:51] so I would challenge you take that
[1:30:53] approach if you have challenges in these
[1:30:55] areas but again you want to get to where
[1:30:56] you have that balanced budget and now
[1:30:58] you're starting to make decisions and
[1:31:01] this is what you use to keep it under
[1:31:03] control you have to have something
[1:31:05] because there is an enemy okay there's
[1:31:07] an enemy he's going to try to make it
[1:31:10] easy to step out of this and confuse you
[1:31:13] okay because he knows once you start
[1:31:15] seeing wow I was 500 this way now I'm
[1:31:19] 500 in that way I'mma start challenging
[1:31:21] every category that I got and I'm going
[1:31:24] to see what makes
[1:31:25] sense okay does it make sense for me to
[1:31:28] have all these subscriptions I don't
[1:31:30] know if I want to give Netflix I was
[1:31:32] looking up it's like $22 a month for
[1:31:34] their premium subscription I don't want
[1:31:36] to give them $22 because I want that $22
[1:31:38] to add to my bottom line now I got 600
[1:31:42] extra a month now see you see what it's
[1:31:44] bringing to you where you're praying to
[1:31:46] God lord I got 600 extra I even know I
[1:31:48] thought I could even get to that Lord
[1:31:50] what you want me to do with it you see
[1:31:52] and I started seeing this when my and
[1:31:54] I'm like oh Lord God I all my money was
[1:31:57] going out now I have a little bit coming
[1:31:59] in and I'm keeping some of it huh you
[1:32:01] mean all these categories the devil's
[1:32:03] trying to take this stuff from me no we
[1:32:06] GNA put up a fight I'mma challenge
[1:32:09] myself okay and I'm not trying to get
[1:32:11] you where you you live like you're
[1:32:12] miserable I'm not trying to do that but
[1:32:15] hey when that character starts setting
[1:32:16] in you start getting excited I'm telling
[1:32:18] you something changes about you it does
[1:32:21] I'm telling you so I can challenge
[1:32:22] myself and question myself on all these
[1:32:24] things do I want to do this uh my why
[1:32:27] nope my why is not greater than what
[1:32:29] it's going to cost me I'm comfortable
[1:32:31] waiting at this point okay when that why
[1:32:34] is greater than the what then I'm going
[1:32:35] to do it because I'm ready I've been
[1:32:37] trained and guess what I got the savings
[1:32:39] now I'm ready I'm feeling good I'm in a
[1:32:42] position where I can get the best deal
[1:32:44] I'm good and if I have to walk away I'm
[1:32:47] good because I got character I got
[1:32:49] character you see and that's where God
[1:32:51] wants us to be because I know it's all
[1:32:53] his is in the first place I've seen him
[1:32:55] so you're in a position where it can be
[1:32:56] taken all away from you and you're fine
[1:32:58] because Lord it ain't mine anyway it's
[1:33:00] all your grace in the first place but
[1:33:02] I've managed what you've given me to the
[1:33:04] best of my ability amen simple simple
[1:33:07] plan praise the Lord so do what it takes
[1:33:10] these are the Hands-On things that you
[1:33:12] have to challenge yourself again the
[1:33:14] devil's going to make it complicated
[1:33:16] like this stuff doesn't work anymore it
[1:33:17] does it's just simple but when you get
[1:33:20] all these five credit cards and you 10
[1:33:21] of credit cards and you can have five
[1:33:23] credit cards but put it on something
[1:33:25] it's still spending it's still the same
[1:33:26] money having a credit card doesn't
[1:33:28] increase your money it's the same money
[1:33:31] so if you spend a $100 on credit card
[1:33:33] that should be deducted okay if you're
[1:33:35] giving your husband let's say you're
[1:33:36] giving him $250 a week okay and he has a
[1:33:39] bank card and he has three credit cards
[1:33:43] okay he still only have 250 he shouldn't
[1:33:46] be like well I got 250 in cash and I got
[1:33:49] 250 in credit card no it's the same
[1:33:51] money deducted from the sheet okay and
[1:33:54] we're able to do that my wife and I are
[1:33:55] able to do that she got she has
[1:33:57] groceries she's managing that that piece
[1:33:58] so it however she spends it she has to
[1:34:01] deducted from the sheet and she likes it
[1:34:03] she said I love this it's very simple I
[1:34:05] can do it you know and each husband and
[1:34:07] wife you're different you know some of
[1:34:08] them you know the husband like to give
[1:34:10] the check to the wife and she manages it
[1:34:11] that's great other house house
[1:34:13] households are different sometimes it's
[1:34:15] a combination but hey work together at
[1:34:17] it decide who you think is best at it
[1:34:20] and go at it go at it amen again we have
[1:34:24] these sheets out there use them get them
[1:34:27] again custom whatever you need to do but
[1:34:29] the thought is the same the thought is
[1:34:32] the same get control and again like I
[1:34:35] said whatever season you're at if you
[1:34:37] can get that control and you start
[1:34:38] seeing the extra that you do have then
[1:34:40] you can still go to God and say Lord
[1:34:41] what do you want me to do with this what
[1:34:43] do you want me to do with it and you
[1:34:45] need that character if you have children
[1:34:47] you need that character because you're
[1:34:50] we are human so if you don't have the
[1:34:52] character all of a sudden you're you're
[1:34:53] doing for your grandkids in ways that
[1:34:55] you shouldn't do and now their character
[1:34:57] is being challenged it is a difficult
[1:34:59] Journey because the devil is real you
[1:35:02] see so he's going to do all of that you
[1:35:04] know and there's many tools and things
[1:35:06] like that to help all of us in whatever
[1:35:08] season that we're in to learn and grow
[1:35:11] grow and learn in these areas so we can
[1:35:13] be good stewards and pass it down to our
[1:35:15] kids and our grandkids all the way down
[1:35:18] it's very very important so as we kind
[1:35:21] of bring it to a close I want to I want
[1:35:23] to leave you with kind of the the tools
[1:35:25] and what you really need cuz we've said
[1:35:28] it we've talked about it put it on paper
[1:35:30] we've talked about the cash envelopes we
[1:35:32] talked a little bit about the why to all
[1:35:34] of this but you need something you need
[1:35:37] something as a steward and what you need
[1:35:38] is what we call diligence okay you have
[1:35:41] to have that diligence means steady
[1:35:45] careful cautious Earnest perseverance
[1:35:48] and one e one's effort with positive
[1:35:50] energy you got to bring that to the
[1:35:52] table you got to be diligent the Bible
[1:35:56] says he becometh poor that dealth with a
[1:35:58] slack hand but the hand of the diligent
[1:36:01] maketh
[1:36:03] Rich the hand of the diligent shall bear
[1:36:06] rule but the slothful shall be under
[1:36:09] tribute that's the word of God that's in
[1:36:11] this word telling us hey diligence is
[1:36:15] key it maketh Rich why because you start
[1:36:18] seeing what God has given you to manage
[1:36:20] you see it and you're able to then to
[1:36:23] apply it
[1:36:24] and his word is his word he said it the
[1:36:26] hand of the diligent maketh Rich you're
[1:36:29] slothful in these areas you will be
[1:36:31] under tribute so as I said before you
[1:36:33] can choose the the pain of
[1:36:34] self-discipline or the pain of
[1:36:37] regret it's a
[1:36:41] choice make spending a plan a family
[1:36:43] affair decide the best person to manage
[1:36:45] the spending plan keeping the money
[1:36:47] could be either husband or wife love and
[1:36:49] Trust husband and wife need to
[1:36:51] participate in creating the spending
[1:36:52] plan like somebody can put it together
[1:36:54] and then you can talk and say yeah do
[1:36:55] you agree hey you you know this you
[1:36:57] think this is enough for your your uh
[1:37:00] what your allowance husband or wife you
[1:37:02] know and you might say well husband is
[1:37:04] I'll give you you know 50 he might say
[1:37:06] well no I need a little bit more vice
[1:37:07] versa wife might need 250 or three or
[1:37:09] four five six seven you never know but
[1:37:12] that's a decision you got to make but
[1:37:15] long as it balanced as long as it's
[1:37:17] balanced then you pray and decide that's
[1:37:19] that's the beauty of it God is a god of
[1:37:21] variety you decide to get together as a
[1:37:24] couple how much you think we but we got
[1:37:26] to keep it balanced we're in agreement
[1:37:28] on that but you might say I need this
[1:37:31] much and we say okay well you can have
[1:37:33] this but that means we we can't eat out
[1:37:34] this much then so it's it's your choice
[1:37:37] I'm totally fine with it but make that
[1:37:39] agreement have a date night once a week
[1:37:41] once a month review what's in the
[1:37:43] envelope what's in this balanced budget
[1:37:45] roll up your sleeves and roll with the
[1:37:46] punches it might take you several months
[1:37:48] to iron it all out but there is a method
[1:37:50] to it if you stick to it and once it's
[1:37:52] working then you you don't have to
[1:37:53] adjust it but ever so often right amen
[1:37:57] amen so I hope by the grace of the Lord
[1:37:59] you're seeing this you're seeing how to
[1:38:01] apply it you know I certainly think of
[1:38:03] the young people coming up and whatever
[1:38:05] season of life you're in hey you can do
[1:38:08] this by the grace of the Lord and as you
[1:38:10] do this you start seeing God you start
[1:38:13] seeing him at work in this small area
[1:38:16] again you can see how excited you get
[1:38:18] and get when you see that that positive
[1:38:20] at the end of the month and you can see
[1:38:22] how excited you would get as you start
[1:38:23] squeezing in like oh huh I can add more
[1:38:25] to that my goodness and guess what we
[1:38:28] hadn't talked about your income going up
[1:38:29] that's right we ain't talked about that
[1:38:31] that's right so you start getting and
[1:38:32] that's exactly what happened I start
[1:38:34] getting that thing balanced boom holding
[1:38:36] it steady me and my wife working at it
[1:38:38] hey we're like I said we enjoyed the $30
[1:38:40] we had in our eating out envelope and
[1:38:42] that's what we would eat out on
[1:38:43] literally that was it now we could have
[1:38:46] chose to put 200 in if we want to but
[1:38:48] that means this would suffer but we had
[1:38:50] to balance okay but we did that and I
[1:38:53] started started getting excited because
[1:38:54] after a while my income would go up but
[1:38:57] I would say I'm going to keep my
[1:38:58] envelopes balanced I'm not going to
[1:39:00] change it so you start feeling like oh
[1:39:02] my Lord this is absolutely amazing man
[1:39:07] another year would pass my income would
[1:39:08] go up we might tweak a category here or
[1:39:10] there but it's like Lord huh father what
[1:39:14] would you have me do what do you have me
[1:39:16] to do you know an extra would come in
[1:39:19] after a while said you know what
[1:39:20] anything extra we hitting that mortgage
[1:39:21] that's where we started saying I don't
[1:39:22] care what in I'm going keep my $30 I
[1:39:24] like it because I see what that devil is
[1:39:27] doing to me on this mortgage payment
[1:39:30] okay and we would put that extra come in
[1:39:31] I got another $300 coming into my
[1:39:33] paycheck it's going to that mortgage
[1:39:35] that's all I did that's all I did we
[1:39:37] start keeping the envelopes hitting that
[1:39:39] mortgage and before you know it we paid
[1:39:42] that thing off amen that's the grace of
[1:39:44] God we paid that mortgage
[1:39:48] off and that's why I see the grace of
[1:39:50] the Lord came in there he came in there
[1:39:53] and done something that was totally
[1:39:55] impossible telling you totally
[1:39:57] impossible coming from where I came from
[1:39:59] it was unheard of Simply unheard of okay
[1:40:03] but the character is the greatest thing
[1:40:05] we got of the sacrificing the character
[1:40:07] I mean we we never felt closer I'm
[1:40:09] telling you we never felt closer as we
[1:40:11] got on this same page you know and I
[1:40:14] believe that's for everybody and I
[1:40:15] believe it's the same thing for the word
[1:40:17] of God and all of his promises it's the
[1:40:19] same feeling and I believe as God
[1:40:21] continues to see us being faithful with
[1:40:23] these things that we will see his
[1:40:25] promises come down like that just in
[1:40:27] that way and we will be getting excited
[1:40:30] okay we will be saying my God all of
[1:40:32] these things have always been promised
[1:40:34] to me I've always been Rich I've always
[1:40:36] been rich in every area of my life
[1:40:39] because you are my father I just didn't
[1:40:41] know how but Lord I'm learning how in
[1:40:44] this little thing called money okay and
[1:40:47] I don't want your mind to think you know
[1:40:48] just because the world is complicated
[1:40:50] you got YouTube and all of this stuff
[1:40:52] you got so much going on that people's
[1:40:54] mind can't grasp that God is in
[1:40:56] Simplicity it really is so I'm telling
[1:40:59] you as that testimony of our mortgage
[1:41:02] being paid off in these simple ways of
[1:41:04] envelopes that the world would say John
[1:41:06] no Mara do this you can borrow this no
[1:41:08] you should do OPM borrow other people's
[1:41:10] money and that's the way you that's what
[1:41:12] they're telling you and next thing you
[1:41:14] know you're all confused and you're like
[1:41:17] well I don't know what to do God's word
[1:41:19] is always right here come back to it
[1:41:22] stick with it in the area of money and
[1:41:24] watch him work watch him unfold and when
[1:41:27] you have a lot of money you're going to
[1:41:29] him you got such character in it that
[1:41:31] you're like Lord I don't want to do
[1:41:32] anything unless you want me to do it
[1:41:33] father period I want you in it praise
[1:41:37] the Lord Jesus amen we're going to get
[1:41:40] ready to close with this I think the
[1:41:42] musicians can go ahead and come on
[1:41:45] up be found faithful you remember it
[1:41:47] said it's required that a student a
[1:41:49] steward be found faithful you know
[1:41:52] faithful with 100% % faithful regardless
[1:41:55] of the amount and trusted faithful in
[1:41:58] the little things first money is a
[1:42:00] little thing faithfulness with another's
[1:42:03] possession faithful to the owner
[1:42:06] faithfulness it unlocks contentment amen
[1:42:09] and that contentment is again that's a
[1:42:11] great gain remember that but all of
[1:42:14] these things you know when we look at
[1:42:16] God's word everything that he is doing
[1:42:19] and done he doesn't want you just to
[1:42:21] work to work he's not afraid to tell you
[1:42:24] that he has rewards for you that's what
[1:42:26] I love about the Lord he's not afraid to
[1:42:28] tell you that there is a reward for it
[1:42:30] you know some of the rewards are
[1:42:32] certainly blessings he say a faithful
[1:42:34] man shall abound with blessings but he
[1:42:37] that maketh haste going all fast to be
[1:42:39] rich shall not be innocent blessings
[1:42:43] great gain but godliness with
[1:42:44] contentment is great gain character
[1:42:47] self-control hard work patience
[1:42:49] diligence frugality gratefulness all of
[1:42:52] that comes out of being a faithful
[1:42:54] Steward and of course more
[1:42:56] responsibilities and the Lord said who
[1:42:59] then is that faithful and wise servant
[1:43:01] whom his Lord shall make him make ruler
[1:43:04] over his household more responsibilities
[1:43:07] and that's what God is promising us to
[1:43:09] do he wants us to get more
[1:43:11] responsibilities in his word and
[1:43:13] managing the things that he want us to
[1:43:15] manage but we can't do it without the
[1:43:17] character it's no different than parents
[1:43:19] with your children you know you know
[1:43:21] they need the character and you want to
[1:43:22] do things to bless them but you can't do
[1:43:24] it if it's going to hurt them you can't
[1:43:26] so we stand still and we pray and the
[1:43:28] Lord does the same thing you know and
[1:43:30] and and we see these things we see that
[1:43:32] everything has come down to this age
[1:43:35] this time you know I I I honestly don't
[1:43:38] take it as just money right not not at
[1:43:41] all right I see us having the greatest
[1:43:43] opportunity as our Prophet said the
[1:43:45] greatest opportunity is down to us man
[1:43:49] think about this word everything that we
[1:43:51] have all of these messages we can have
[1:43:52] it on you watch it's everything all of
[1:43:55] the experiences pastors preachers
[1:43:58] everything the history and certainly
[1:44:00] this church with with brother Dale just
[1:44:02] the history all of that think all about
[1:44:04] all of that is on us now all of it you
[1:44:08] know to say in a sense like there's
[1:44:10] there's no excuse but more so in a sense
[1:44:13] that Lord God what a responsibility that
[1:44:16] we have you know what a responsibility
[1:44:18] that we have to take this thing on
[1:44:20] through amen you know and I believe that
[1:44:22] I believe he said it also on the tape
[1:44:24] we're ordained for this hour all of us
[1:44:27] we are ordained for this so pray
[1:44:30] challenge yourself and said Lord help me
[1:44:33] help us Lord you've given us everything
[1:44:36] everything to see to see what happened
[1:44:39] to this what this person did what we can
[1:44:41] we got so much so much as I said coming
[1:44:44] from so much and seeing so much for me
[1:44:46] personally with financial Jubilee you
[1:44:48] know I saw
[1:44:50] men that that fell apart yeah sure I I
[1:44:54] could hardly name one from where I grew
[1:44:56] up
[1:44:58] that that came to anything wow literally
[1:45:02] men grown men drink drugs die smoke
[1:45:06] that's that's what we saw lose their
[1:45:09] way so that in a sense is in me it it it
[1:45:12] it has broken me to a sense that it's
[1:45:15] like Lord God what a
[1:45:17] responsibility you know I want to be one
[1:45:20] by his grace if I can stand for those
[1:45:22] men that nice men kind you know um I can
[1:45:25] name them just off my tongue so many
[1:45:27] people you know that to me just never
[1:45:29] had that opportunity they never had it
[1:45:32] for whatever reason they never had it so
[1:45:34] you think I'm going to let somebody
[1:45:37] trick me into signing a $50,000 car note
[1:45:41] never never it's too much it's like
[1:45:44] never too much for me when I see what
[1:45:46] they didn't have I can get gratefulness
[1:45:48] from driving my van beyond what any
[1:45:50] normal person can because it's like Lord
[1:45:52] thank you if it breaks I can fix it my
[1:45:54] dad didn't even have that he didn't have
[1:45:57] that if something broke he could fix it
[1:45:58] he was done try to find somebody who
[1:46:00] could maybe fix it and they would fix it
[1:46:03] halfway so I feel so grateful to God
[1:46:06] that I can go to the Lord like that and
[1:46:07] say father God thank you thank you Lord
[1:46:11] now I can get when the Lord is ready and
[1:46:13] I want to and the why is great then yeah
[1:46:15] I would do something different but I'm
[1:46:16] saying that to give you an example the
[1:46:19] same thing of all of these great
[1:46:21] Mysteries this word of of God that we've
[1:46:24] gotten brother Dale preaching his heart
[1:46:26] out I'm sure for the many years I always
[1:46:28] took to my wife and said you go you know

[1:52:04] we got to put a line in it it's called
[1:52:07] building
[1:52:10] fund so since y'all got all this extra
[1:52:13] money we got from now to
[1:52:15] July right on time right on time brother
[1:52:18] I was thinking about that I thought now
[1:52:19] me and you didn't talk about that so but
[1:52:22] building
[1:52:24] fund but uh the lord always provides if
[1:52:27] you'll do your part if you'll do your
[1:52:29] part not jip him he will never jip you
[1:52:33] you'll jip him and you'll lose your
[1:52:34] blessing that's right but it's like
[1:52:36] brother John you know the right there at
[1:52:38] the top I I've had people and dad didn't
[1:52:42] never preach on tithing much a couple of
[1:52:45] times his whole life one time when
[1:52:47] Boyd's daddy came and boy said my
[1:52:49] preacher never preaches on TI preached
[1:52:50] on the same day as daddy came so don't
[1:52:52] ever say that to your folks that my
[1:52:54] preacher never preaches on x y z because
[1:52:57] the Lord will just he's got a sense of
[1:52:59] humor the Lord does so um but um but
[1:53:04] just think about all that if you if you
[1:53:06] don't you got to be a good Steward in
[1:53:08] everything and and tithing and all you
[1:53:11] know people get all well do it before do
[1:53:13] it for
[1:53:14] after it's like brother John said it's
[1:53:17] pretty simple you bring home a th if you
[1:53:19] make $1,000 a week write a check for
[1:53:21] $100 put it in a tiing account well I
[1:53:25] spent that well quit
[1:53:27] spending that's not what God said okay

[1:53:31] tithe and we have faithful tithe payers
[1:53:34] cuz y'all do a really good job more than
[1:53:35] more than a lot of others and we sure
[1:53:37] appreciate that we appreciate brother
[1:53:39] John and what he's what he's brought and
[1:53:42] uh we'll do this in the uh next the next
[1:53:45] month May June and uh we sure appreciate
[1:53:48] him we appreciate what he stands for and
[1:53:51] his diligence listen I appreciate a
[1:53:55] man that can tell his history
[1:53:59] right and not be ashamed of
[1:54:02] it
[1:54:08] right it takes somebody with the Holy
[1:54:10] Ghost to do that CU most people are mad
[1:54:12] when they start talking about that their
[1:54:14] great grandparents were slaves and and
[1:54:17] share coppers and and and and you uh you
[1:54:21] should have put your name of your
[1:54:22] business on that that
[1:54:24] dumpster John's dumpster diving business
[1:54:27] or something like that was popular
[1:54:29] that's right but a man that can do that
[1:54:31] when everybody else is laughing at him
[1:54:34] right and then see now that that he
[1:54:36] lives in a real fine home that's paid
[1:54:38] off he's got a wonderful family sure we
[1:54:41] all got problems we all got issues but
[1:54:43] the little things the little things and
[1:54:47] brother John's done it and he came from
[1:54:50] and my dad my dad was a share coer their
[1:54:52] whole family that's all they done they
[1:54:54] took they had a field of 100 acres and
[1:54:56] you got 50 and you planted 50 and if if
[1:54:59] the guy didn't make good you didn't make
[1:55:01] make good so you know they had to share
[1:55:02] it it's why they call it sharecropping
[1:55:04] and if you had a bad year you all had a
[1:55:06] bad year and there was nine of them and
[1:55:08] Daddy was the baby so the old saying
[1:55:11] goes don't throw the baby out with the
[1:55:12] bath water that's where that came from
[1:55:14] cuz by the time daddy got his shower at
[1:55:16] I mean got his bath in the bathtub at 9
[1:55:18] the ninth one you couldn't see him
[1:55:23] so don't throw the baby out with the
[1:55:24] bath water that's where that came from
[1:55:25] not from my dad but that's where that
[1:55:27] saying came from don't throw the baby
[1:55:29] out with the bath water people wash
[1:55:30] their kids and then they wouldn't be
[1:55:32] able to find them in the in the tub but
[1:55:34] I appreciate that brother
[1:55:36] johnen for a man to stand and tell his
[1:55:38] history and be and and be all right with
[1:55:42] it same way with all of us I me we all
[1:55:45] come from different backgrounds but but
[1:55:47] you you folks of color you have a
[1:55:49] different you know a lot of times you
[1:55:51] have a different mentality about it and
[1:55:53] and that and that just comes from the
[1:55:55] world but if you got the baptism of the
[1:55:57] Holy Ghost we all the same color we all
[1:56:01] came from the same background we all
[1:56:04] were
[1:56:05] slaves we had an Emancipation
[1:56:08] Proclamation God said I'll save you if
[1:56:10] you'll ask me and that's way better than
[1:56:12] Abraham Lincoln's that saved all of us
[1:56:15] and give us eternal life um Abraham
[1:56:18] Lincoln was kind of temporary you know
[1:56:19] he he gave them the Emancipation and
[1:56:21] then people kept going on and and I
[1:56:23] don't think they stop slavery a lot
[1:56:25] after that
[1:56:27] but when you once become a slave to the
[1:56:29] devil once God emancipates you from
[1:56:33] that it's for
[1:56:35] eternity and you're free that's you're
[1:56:39] free and like I said you you see that
[1:56:41] you go to that Jubilee year and you see
[1:56:43] that person you can go free if you want
[1:56:45] to amen if you want to go free you can
[1:56:48] if not you'll be born in the in the air
[1:56:52] with an A Marked for life can't hear
[1:56:54] anything out of that air so you can't
[1:56:57] hear that Jubilee ever again don't pass
[1:56:59] up your time being in this is Jubilee
[1:57:01] year this is Jubilee for everybody all
[1:57:04] right I looked outside it it's not
[1:57:05] raining it's not cold it was a minute
[1:57:08] ago but it's not cold so but I'm still
[1:57:10] going to read the scripture here that
[1:57:12] way when we go out there we'll have the
[1:57:13] baptismal service and it won't take um
[1:57:16] that um that long of a time just be
[1:57:18] careful when you walk out there it might
[1:57:20] be a little bit muddy but I looked out
[1:57:22] it looked okay the Lord I asked the Lord
[1:57:24] just to not let it rain while we had the
[1:57:26] baptismal service so I appreciate him
[1:57:28] for that but let's go ahead and read the
[1:57:30] the um the scripture here and then we'll
[1:57:32] go down and then we'll sing on Jordan
[1:57:34] stormy Banks I stand there and then
[1:57:38] we'll have prayer and then we'll if
[1:57:40] you're ready anybody else want to be
[1:57:41] baptized just jump in line and we'll
[1:57:43] baptize you in the name of the Lord
[1:57:45] Jesus so let's read the
[1:57:47] scripture Romans chapter 6 is what shall
[1:57:50] we say then shall we continue sin that
[1:57:52] Grace May abound God forbid in other
[1:57:55] words get a plan have a plan have a plan
[1:57:58] of action and and before I I was going
[1:58:01] to tell you this June and I when we
[1:58:02] first took the financial piece thing
[1:58:04] with do Dave
[1:58:05] Ramsey um I think we paid off $6,500 we
[1:58:09] had money laying around we didn't even
[1:58:10] know we had we paid off like $6,500 in 3
[1:58:13] months but you sticking to the plan
[1:58:16] right and so you can do it and another
[1:58:18] good thing to do is is to check up on
[1:58:20] your insurance plans we saved a lot of
[1:58:23] money cuz we just had a guy that was our
[1:58:24] insurance agent for and he's a good guy
[1:58:28] but uh he may jump up there a little bit
[1:58:30] not send you a not send you a notice
[1:58:32] that it's going up a little bit so we um
[1:58:35] we went through all that and got all new
[1:58:37] insurance rates and it was lower so we
[1:58:39] saved like $200 a month I think it was
[1:58:42] just right just from changing insurance
[1:58:44] companies so um so that's something that
[1:58:46] you can look at but remember when you
[1:58:48] get those things don't bring them back
[1:58:49] to Brother John he does not want to see
[1:58:50] your income he does not want to help you
[1:58:53] with your homework he's G you enough to
[1:58:55] do your own homework all
[1:58:58] right so God forbid how shall we that
[1:59:01] are dead to sin live any longer therein
[1:59:04] know you not that as many of us as we're
[1:59:06] baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized
[1:59:09] into his death Jesus Christ baptized
[1:59:11] into his death all right therefore we
[1:59:13] are buried with him by baptism into
[1:59:16] death that like as Christ was raised up
[1:59:19] from the dead by the glory of the father
[1:59:21] even so we also should walk in newness
[1:59:23] of life you see what Paul did Paul took
[1:59:26] and he put us right in there with Jesus
[1:59:29] you know he told us in Romans that were
[1:59:30] heirs and Joint HS so he told us right
[1:59:32] here he said whatever you know we're
[1:59:33] going to be buried like Christ was
[1:59:35] buried Christ
[1:59:37] died Jesus was dead the body the man
[1:59:41] Jesus died all right but then he raised
[1:59:44] in newness of Life telling us the same
[1:59:46] thing even so we also should walk in
[1:59:48] newness of
[1:59:50] life for if we have been planted
[1:59:54] together together with him in the
[1:59:56] likeness of his death we shall be also
[1:59:58] in the likeness of his
[2:00:01] resurrection one day we if you pass away
[2:00:05] you're going to walk out of that grave
[2:00:06] they ain't going to be they ain't got to
[2:00:08] dig you
[2:00:10] out right this is all secret they're not
[2:00:13] going to go to the Grave we're not going
[2:00:15] to the grave and then you see that it
[2:00:17] looks like the grave diggers got all the
[2:00:18] people out of the no they just going to
[2:00:20] come right up hey if they're in another
[2:00:22] Dimension coming into this one and
[2:00:24] picking the body up and bringing it out
[2:00:25] of that casket ain't going to ain't
[2:00:28] going to hurt them or God either one you
[2:00:29] know he he he pretty much got it all
[2:00:31] handled it's going to be a secret thing
[2:00:33] but you know what Jesus walked out of
[2:00:36] that
[2:00:37] tomb with a glorified body whoever's in
[2:00:41] the Tomb today will walk out of that
[2:00:43] tomb and a glorified body knowing this
[2:00:47] that our old man is crucified with him
[2:00:49] that the body of sin might be destroyed
[2:00:51] that henceforth we should not serve sin
[2:00:55] for he that is dead is free from sin
[2:00:58] that's why when a Christian really truly
[2:01:01] dies that's why brother BR said
[2:01:03] Christians have sins but we're
[2:01:05] sinless do everybody understand
[2:01:08] that some maybe not I see the
[2:01:13] furrow your soul today by the new birth
[2:01:16] is sinless there's no way your soul can
[2:01:18] sin it is dead Christ is in there and
[2:01:22] can Christ sin NOP but you got a spirit
[2:01:25] realm you can sin in your spirit
[2:01:28] realm now what is sin unbelief you don't
[2:01:33] believe enough that the power of this
[2:01:35] thing right here will take care of
[2:01:37] everything just like you may say well
[2:01:40] brother John that's just do I need to
[2:01:41] use envelopes I mean come on me and June
[2:01:44] did and we did a good job with it for a
[2:01:46] while we fell off the wagon but but we
[2:01:48] still I mean the principles are still
[2:01:50] there you got to get you got to get to
[2:01:53] do something different and that's same
[2:01:55] way with God I I don't understand I say
[2:01:58] this real quick I don't understand that
[2:02:00] people that that that say I can't help
[2:02:04] but do this well you know what when I
[2:02:07] was a sinner absolutely I couldn't help
[2:02:09] but do what I did I did what a sinner
[2:02:11] did a dog barks because it's a what have
[2:02:16] you ever seen a cat
[2:02:18] bark a dog barks that's his
[2:02:21] characteristic he's a dog all right now
[2:02:23] if some way though like brother R said
[2:02:25] if some way you could take that Spirit
[2:02:27] out of that dog and put the spirit of a
[2:02:29] cat in it'd be a strange meow but it
[2:02:33] would be meow all over the place so what
[2:02:36] about the same way with God you acted
[2:02:38] like a sinner you were a sinner you
[2:02:39] acted like the devil you didn't believe
[2:02:41] and all of a sudden you died that died
[2:02:45] and when it died it don't come back
[2:02:48] up I know we have problems still in our
[2:02:50] spirit realm but in your soul it should
[2:02:52] be settled anchored I mean laid down
[2:02:55] where it's dead you're dead in Christ
[2:02:59] all right for he that is dead is freed
[2:03:01] from sin now if we be dead with Christ
[2:03:03] we believe that we shall also live with
[2:03:05] him knowing that Christ being raised
[2:03:08] from the dead dieth no more death hath
[2:03:10] no more
[2:03:11] dominion over him for in that he died he
[2:03:14] died unto sin once but in that he liveth
[2:03:18] he liveth unto God likewise Reon you
[2:03:22] also yourselves to be dead now he's
[2:03:24] telling us now we need to reckon
[2:03:25] ourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but
[2:03:29] alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our
[2:03:31] Lord let not sin therefore
[2:03:34] Rain Rain r not r a i n r e you're
[2:03:38] reading it right don't let it rain what
[2:03:41] in other words take
[2:03:43] over all right if a king Reigns he rules
[2:03:46] the whole place all right so don't let
[2:03:48] sin be the king don't let it rain in
[2:03:51] your mortal
[2:03:52] body that you should obey it in the lust
[2:03:55] thereof neither yield ye your members as
[2:03:58] instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin
[2:04:00] but yield yourself unto God as those
[2:04:02] that are alive from the dead and your
[2:04:04] members as instruments of
[2:04:07] righteousness unto God but sin shall not
[2:04:10] have dominion over you for you are not
[2:04:13] under the
[2:04:14] law but under
[2:04:16] grace it's the grace of God that we
[2:04:20] go and we symbolize a death burial and a
[2:04:24] resurrection and then the Bible says
[2:04:26] walk in newness of Life repent be
[2:04:29] baptized in Jesus name and you shall
[2:04:32] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost let's
[2:04:35] try and do what brother John said let's
[2:04:37] try to do what's already been there it's
[2:04:39] like it's like Dave Ramy said this is
[2:04:41] Grandma's stuff his stuff didn't get he
[2:04:42] didn't sit in his room and get this
[2:04:44] Revelation it's just from Old School
[2:04:46] that we've lost from new school ideas
[2:04:49] you know it's become easy to do the
[2:04:52] other thing but let's take the same
[2:04:54] thing with the word of God it's just
[2:04:57] it's just it's it's really simple we
[2:04:59] complicate and the devil loves for you
[2:05:01] to be complicated right he loves Mass
[2:05:04] confusion he loves for you to question
[2:05:06] but just say all right God I'm going to
[2:05:09] take you at your
[2:05:10] word this is what I'm going to do I'm
[2:05:12] Gonna Make a Move then brother bam say
[2:05:14] you make a move God Will Make a Move
[2:05:15] he's waiting on you to move first though
[2:05:18] so let's make a move toward God and
[2:05:20] finances and even spiritual spiritual
[2:05:23] finances he'll pour out the windows of
[2:05:25] Heaven if you'll tithe
[2:05:27] yourself as much as you do your
[2:05:30] money take 10% of a 40 of a of even 40
[2:05:34] Hour Week take 10% of your time
[2:05:38] right so that's what that's four hours
[2:05:41] do you give God four hours from from
[2:05:45] Monday till Friday if you Works 5 days a
[2:05:47] week do you give God four
[2:05:50] hours of that time now if you take a
[2:05:54] 24-hour day of course you got to count
[2:05:55] sleep but you take a 24-hour day seven
[2:05:58] days a
[2:05:59] week that's about eight hours that you
[2:06:01] need to give God one whole day of just
[2:06:03] nothing but giving it to God if you
[2:06:05] tithe your time Brother D priest don't
[2:06:07] tithing our time right and our talent
[2:06:11] right and our talent and they're doing
[2:06:13] it they're making a sacrifice they stay
[2:06:15] here and practice they brother boy
[2:06:18] different one they stay and practice and
[2:06:19] they practice their their their singing
[2:06:21] they're playing and all that if we had
[2:06:23] all the musicians up here y'all know we
[2:06:24] wouldn't have a space to put them all
[2:06:26] but they practice why do they practice
[2:06:28] they don't want to do it for the for
[2:06:29] theirself they want to do it for the
[2:06:30] Lord right amen they want to do it for
[2:06:32] you guys to create an atmosphere that
[2:06:35] you can benefit from it you can benefit
[2:06:38] from it I know some of the Brother John
[2:06:40] some of them brother Boyd they if they
[2:06:42] come up here to sing and and it

[2:06:48] do your job you do your job and you Pres
[2:06:51] in it and then God comes in and he
[2:06:53] brings it right down and we receive it
[2:06:56] so God bless you let's say let's have a
[2:06:58] prayer then we'll go I don't need to
