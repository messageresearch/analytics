[15:37] this afternoon Lord just give everybody
[15:40] supernatural understanding give us all

[15:48] to have revelation to make it through
[15:51] father you're the only one who can do
[15:54] the revealing so father you do the
[15:55] speaking today that it would be made so
[15:57] plain that it will be made known to each
[16:00] individual in this building and father's
[16:03] brother Dale has been preaching on the
[16:05] new birth Lord I pray that that will
[16:09] become a manifestation in someone's life
[16:12] the Amana feh station and all of our
[16:14] lives that we'll know that we know that
[16:17] we know that you dwell in our heart
[16:21] father forgive us of our sins in our
[16:23] many mistakes and the crazy things we do
[16:26] in life Lord we pray that you would just
[16:28] forgive those Lord draws closer to you
[16:31] father's a day approaches they draw our
[16:34] families together and bind our hearts
[16:36] together in you Lord be with the ones
[16:38] that are sick the ones that are getting
[16:40] older that that need a touching the body
[16:42] brother for the aisle brother dick all
[16:45] the different ones sister Johnny brother
[16:48] Daugherty Lord sister Jean we miss them
[16:52] being here ever service lord I pray that
[16:53] you just give them a supernatural touch
[16:56] today father Lord just give us this day
[16:58] our daily bread forgive us of our
[17:00] trespasses as we forgive those who
[17:01] trespass against this lead us not into
[17:04] temptation but deliver us from evil what
[17:06] a prayer for thine is the glory for ever
[17:08] and ever Lord amen
[17:10] and when he had opened the Seventh Seal
[17:12] There was silence in heaven about the
[17:14] space of a half an hour now let's read
[17:17] John 19:30 I'm going to continue reading
[17:22] this one then maybe it will it'll strike
[17:24] home that this is kind of what we're
[17:26] talking about is we were talking last
[17:27] Sunday about the shout when Jesus
[17:30] therefore had received the vinegar he
[17:31] said it is finished anybody's head gave
[17:36] up the ghost let's read the last one
[17:38] Ephesians 4:30 and grieve not the Holy
[17:40] Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto
[17:43] the day of redemption you may be seated
[17:47] in the Lord at his blessing to the
[17:48] reading the word now as we have been
[17:50] through going through the seals we find
[17:53] out that
[17:54] Steele had a symbol each seal had a a
[17:58] seen each seal had a part each seal
[18:02] we've been through it for a year we've
[18:03] been through the first seal second seal
[18:05] third seal fourth seal fifth seal sixth
[18:07] seal and now into the seventh seal where
[18:10] now we come up to a time where there's
[18:13] no symbol there's no motion there's no
[18:19] voice there's no it's just silence in
[18:22] heaven for the space of a half of an
[18:24] hour and as I said before I could bring
[18:26] the drawing board up here but I you
[18:28] can't write anything on it according to
[18:31] what the Bible says there was silence in
[18:33] heaven for the space of a half an hour
[18:34] so you're gonna have to just leave that
[18:36] blank because there was no symbol there
[18:39] was no movement brother Brown said there
[18:40] was no movement because one move would
[18:43] give away the secret all right so we got
[18:46] us then we got to do something as I was
[18:49] telling them downstairs this morning
[18:51] what's come to me on this seventh seal
[18:54] is that if we look at the first seal and
[18:58] that pertains to you and I in the
[19:00] spiritual form right we look at the
[19:02] second seal it pertains to you a night
[19:04] of spiritual form right third fourth
[19:06] fifth sixth all the way up now we've
[19:08] come to the seventh seal and then what
[19:10] have we done what have we done we've
[19:12] made it brother branham's got to come
[19:14] back we've made it it ain't open
[19:17] somebody's got to come and open it we've
[19:19] made it
[19:20] I say we not us but I mean the message
[19:22] people have made it everything they've
[19:25] made it the cloud they've made it
[19:27] they've made it the seventh under
[19:30] virtues were seven men with seven voices
[19:33] have gotten they're all dead so they're
[19:37] not doing us any good I mean really come
[19:39] on so they've made it everything but
[19:43] what it is and it's what's just what I
[19:47] read you if there's only one seal and
[19:49] the seventh seal is the completion
[19:51] remember that's God's complete number is
[19:54] seven then what and where is that
[19:58] seventh seal it's not in heaven
[20:04] it's not a denomination it's not a car
[20:09] or a boat or a cloud sure those were
[20:13] symbols those were things that that
[20:15] helped us along that helped us to to get
[20:19] clarity about what was going on but they
[20:22] made it everything in the world but the
[20:24] only thing that it is its Christ in you
[20:27] the hope of glory the seventh seal is
[20:32] not one person it is the bride now sure
[20:36] you say well what you take Christ that
[20:38] well Christ is one person but he's a
[20:41] mini membered body I mean where in the
[20:44] world why would you have a shout with
[20:47] nobody to hear what's going on
[20:49] I would why would you have a voice if
[20:52] there was no no contact I mean you know
[20:55] laughing come on people
[20:57] God told us one time remember he said
[21:00] well it was me said the the most
[21:04] intelligent conversation he ever has is
[21:06] with itself right I agree with that so
[21:11] but it's kind of boring to have a
[21:13] conversation with yourself
[21:15] have you ever argued with yourself much
[21:19] it's much better to argue with somebody
[21:20] else though right
[21:22] okay so you got in other words it takes
[21:24] it takes to you got to have a voice and
[21:28] then you got to have somebody to respond
[21:30] to that voice negative or positive
[21:33] either way all right same way with here
[21:35] in speaking we must have we must have
[21:39] something that said so that there can be
[21:42] a response so it's looking at this
[21:45] seventh seal people have made it
[21:46] everything in the world but what it is
[21:49] it's Christ living in a bride doing the
[21:55] same things he did when he was here the
[21:58] first time that's just about the
[22:00] simplest thing I can say to you because
[22:04] if seal 1 through 6 was the plan of
[22:07] redemption sealed 7 can't be something
[22:10] way part away from that it's got to be
[22:12] the completion
[22:14] of that same plan because you started
[22:18] with one church age and you get the
[22:20] seven church ages completes the Gentile
[22:23] journey there Paul says the mystery of
[22:27] the Gentiles we'll read it a little bit
[22:29] later where he says the mystery of the
[22:31] Gentiles there in Colossians which is
[22:33] Christ in you the hope of glory the
[22:35] problem is as we have many times that
[22:37] I'm going to keep saying they keep
[22:38] saying it is that we got Christ over
[22:41] here and us over here you said no he's
[22:44] drilling inside here but you still got
[22:46] to people they can't be evil one person
[22:49] living there and you said one nice God
[22:53] used together this person I thought that
[22:55] word vulcanized vulcanized means that
[22:58] whatever the material was it slept up
[23:01] against the material that same exact
[23:03] material and it intertwines so well till
[23:07] there's no way you can pull it apart and
[23:10] I'm telling you that's what the plan of
[23:11] redemption is it's not that God come
[23:14] down and he purified your soul and then
[23:16] he went off somewhere and sent you a
[23:17] second person or sent you a third person
[23:21] it's him it's that same guy it's that
[23:27] same man that walks the shores of
[23:29] Galilee so we must keep that because
[23:31] remember - and like we were talking
[23:34] about before about people and I say some
[23:39] people probably in in the message the
[23:41] reason they they preach the way they do
[23:43] about redemption of the body they just
[23:48] don't think there's enough redemption in
[23:51] this message for that why I promise you
[23:53] one thing if the seals do not open in a
[23:55] supernatural way - you sitting here
[23:57] today sitting here today I'm gonna tell
[24:01] my somebody off somewhere else I'm no my
[24:03] today if the seals are not open to you
[24:06] in the same form that we're bringing it
[24:08] to you then it's a mystery to you that
[24:12] don't make you the mystery that makes it
[24:13] a mystery to you and you will say how
[24:17] can this word change my mortal body
[24:24] that will be a question in your mind
[24:28] that has been a question all the way
[24:31] down to the church ages because remember
[24:33] the prophet of God tells us he says they
[24:36] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[24:38] they couldn't get completely pulled
[24:39] apart from what from a denominational
[24:43] idea we were talking about some things
[24:44] last night a lot of things that you hear
[24:47] in denomination is tradition you say
[24:50] well the Catholic Church does that well
[24:52] that's mama her daughters are just
[24:54] doing what she's doing
[24:55] they're taking the tradition that mom
[24:58] was walking on the streets to go right
[24:59] now she's in glory with Jesus well
[25:01] that's not true and that hell is eternal
[25:04] and we were talking about suicide last
[25:05] night the different things you know you
[25:07] thank God for a prophet but if we if we
[25:10] would have looked in the Bible we would
[25:13] have seen that saw of course all of them
[25:16] go to the stall about Saul killed itself
[25:18] and and he's you know everybody that
[25:20] have you ever been anywhere where
[25:22] somebody like specially a Baptist does a
[25:24] funeral and the person commits suicide
[25:26] man they just stumble all over
[25:28] themselves they don't know how to handle
[25:30] it because their tradition tells them
[25:33] that there is no way that person is
[25:35] going to heaven he was not a Christian
[25:37] he's going to help when we know that's
[25:39] exactly false brother Branham tells us
[25:44] is false but you know what the Bible
[25:45] tells us that it's false because they
[25:47] always go back to solve number one Saul
[25:49] didn't kill herself he tried but brother
[25:53] Bram tried to kill this there applies
[25:54] but Saul tried to kill itself
[25:57] the little boy came by and killed him
[25:59] but if Saul was in hell Samuel was in
[26:02] hell the prophet Samuel was brought up
[26:05] the day before from paradise and he told
[26:10] Saul to Det tomorrow you'll be with me
[26:13] so whoever samuel was that's where
[26:16] Saul's going to make a very very real
[26:18] point you and I are gonna see Saul in
[26:21] glory you and I are going to see God's
[26:24] anointed Saul was one of God's anointed
[26:28] prophets now that's according to the
[26:30] Bible and according to what David said
[26:32] David said don't you touch that man
[26:34] because look David could have killed him
[26:36] several times
[26:37] several times he could have killed him
[26:39] and he didn't but see that but you see
[26:41] you hear that long enough and what I'm
[26:43] saying about people the message you hear
[26:45] it long enough that there's not enough
[26:47] redemption for this body and we we got
[26:50] to wait number one they waited gonna
[26:51] everybody falls back home we gotta wait
[26:53] till somebody comes back and speaks us
[26:57] in your body that's that's basically
[26:58] your 10th doctrine is that brother
[27:01] barons got to come back and speak to the
[27:02] glorified body well I don't see that I
[27:05] don't agree with that and I'm promising
[27:07] you a tingle happen if we don't get what
[27:13] he's already said and become that now I
[27:15] don't care if Jesus himself brings a
[27:18] tent and puts it out here if you're not
[27:20] ready you're not gonna go you're not
[27:23] gonna be there so we got to get ready
[27:25] now lazy people wait on other stuff we
[27:28] can't wait on this we and we can't we
[27:31] can't force this thing but you know what
[27:33] we can get right in rhythm remember the
[27:35] bride the bride the review of the bride
[27:37] brother Brown said they were all in
[27:39] rhythm and he said they've started to
[27:40] get out of step now it did not make him
[27:43] it didn't make him nan bride they were
[27:47] just getting out of step and he said get
[27:49] back in line what that voice came from
[27:52] where he was to them get back in line
[27:54] remember and then he came back into this
[27:56] dimension so that's what he was telling
[27:58] but get back in line what listen to good
[28:01] preachers and good teachers and good
[28:04] good Sunday School teachers and all the
[28:06] different things I was thinking this
[28:07] morning man how fortunate we are
[28:11] but how unfortunate a lot of people are
[28:14] that have to sit under things like that
[28:16] I mean how would you be sitting in a
[28:19] message church and you're sitting there
[28:20] for years and the preacher just says
[28:22] there's not enough redemption for your
[28:24] body well where are your words your mind
[28:26] going to go where is your where is your
[28:28] hope and your aspiration of of even I
[28:31] wouldn't even study I just say I got the
[28:35] Holy Ghost and I'm in the message Church
[28:36] and I just believe God sent a prophet
[28:38] don't cut my hair welcome me cut my hair
[28:40] but don't put on makeup and all these
[28:42] different things you know and you just
[28:44] sit there and run down around in your
[28:45] brain for 40 years that's why we're
[28:48] still here it's just sitting there
[28:49] running do's and dont's
[28:50] around and I'm right but they've not
[28:54] studied they've not had somebody to
[28:56] teach them that this is the total plan
[28:59] of redemption brother Branham let me let
[29:01] me just read this don't bring it up tell
[29:03] them or read it again cuz I'm getting
[29:05] little head of myself but listen
[29:10] something bout the shouting these
[29:12] different things I'll find it just take
[29:20] it
[29:27] well you know what I'll start the
[29:29] message and then we'll get to it but
[29:30] brother Brian was talking about he said
[29:32] it's not in the years of preparation
[29:33] it's not in the healing campaign you've
[29:35] heard that many times before it's not
[29:36] that wasn't a brother I want the
[29:38] prophets message these seals were his
[29:40] message so if you want to get the
[29:42] prophets message you got to hear these
[29:44] seals if you want to hear what our
[29:48] prophet was our prophet was not sent to
[29:50] us to help us live better lives that was
[29:57] taught from Pentecost all the different
[30:00] ones I mean come on when you come up to
[30:06] John Wesley where you know even drinking
[30:09] tea was was was had no value so he said
[30:13] don't let's don't do it because then he
[30:15] come under that part of sanctification
[30:16] now but now Luther could Luther could
[30:20] drink a beer and smoke a pipe but now
[30:22] Wesley didn't so you see God moving up
[30:24] further bringing more revelation then
[30:27] you got the Pentecostals which took it
[30:29] to the other extreme and made them wear
[30:31] long sleeves and no jewelry and they
[30:32] just went over to the other side but
[30:35] there's always a middle of the road and
[30:37] that's what brother Branham he come and
[30:39] brought them back to the faith of the
[30:41] fathers restored back what the gifts and
[30:44] all those things and then he brought his
[30:46] message in 1963 64 and 65 and that was
[30:51] the message that he was to bring and
[30:53] that's our message I mean really we
[30:58] should have been living right a good
[31:00] Christian life if you were a Christian
[31:02] before you heard of the message if you
[31:04] were a Christian before you heard the
[31:06] message you should have been living that
[31:09] Christian life because this message
[31:10] doesn't make you a Christian if you're a
[31:14] Christian you believe this message I was
[31:17] telling them downstairs and I'll tell
[31:18] you too while we're all here of course
[31:20] the ones that are not here is not going
[31:22] to hear it
[31:22] but where is our zeal if you don't know
[31:27] anymore today than you knew 10 years ago
[31:32] if you're just coming to church and I
[31:35] believe in and you know like I said
[31:37] somebody else already made Church a 1 a
[31:38] 1
[31:39] shot deal on Sunday anyway so brother
[31:42] Brown said you can't wait for the doors
[31:44] of this church to open to get in here
[31:46] not not to and how many of you say all
[31:48] at Sunday I got set to hold outside to
[31:50] go to church she has never been part of
[31:53] my my lord and mom and dad and we were
[31:56] we went to church from we were Baptist
[31:57] both services and on Wednesday night
[32:01] the Bible says much more as the day
[32:03] approaches you should be gathered
[32:05] together in the sanctuary in church so
[32:08] what are we doing we're trying to we're
[32:09] trying to get this big great Seventh
[32:11] Seal brought to us and and we can't even
[32:14] be here to hear it so you know it and
[32:18] I'm glad you know brother Dale's brother
[32:20] that was hitting me you got to be born
[32:24] again being born again so you say well
[32:27] no I've been born in 40 years I'm he's
[32:29] talking to them young people well you
[32:32] better be able to get you a little bit
[32:34] while you at it because it's it's lamp
[32:36] trimming time it's sharpening up time
[32:38] it's time for us to maybe get back in
[32:40] the furrow and plant the right you know
[32:43] the seat right seeds being planted it's
[32:45] just you and I got to take what irrigate
[32:47] it we got a water washing of the water
[32:49] by the word all right so much more as
[32:52] the day approaches we see more people
[32:53] falling away but we see the ones that
[32:56] are here that the ones that are now here
[32:58] they're solid they're getting more solid
[33:00] getting more solid getting more solid
[33:01] because listen this is the great shaking
[33:03] time when these seals open brother
[33:08] Branham said at the end of the seventh
[33:10] seal he said thousands of my friends
[33:13] will leave right why because he's
[33:17] bringing the message that nobody
[33:18] understood thousands of my friends he
[33:22] had to stand alone and then my Lord when
[33:25] he preached marriage and divorce I think
[33:26] he said he might have said hundreds he
[33:28] said thousands when he started preaching
[33:30] marriage in divorce so you see that what
[33:32] the word does the word is a divider and
[33:34] a separator it will divide whether you
[33:38] like it or not so the holy ghost
[33:41] remember the holy ghost is the only
[33:43] revealer of the word so you should know
[33:46] more not just by letter but this thing
[33:49] should come the essence we were talking
[33:51] about this a little bit
[33:53] this past week the essence of the
[33:55] message is what we're not getting the
[33:57] essence is not quotes because you can
[34:01] stand up here and and and I can take
[34:03] quotes and I make all two lords and I
[34:05] make I make a polygamy and well I mean
[34:10] the Bible is the same way but if you get
[34:14] the essence of this message you'll be
[34:17] here every Sunday you'll be here every
[34:20] time the door is open and you'll not
[34:21] just be here because somebody said you
[34:23] need to be here you'll be here because
[34:26] you want to be here that's the
[34:27] difference it's being here because you
[34:29] have a desire to be here if you have no
[34:33] desire to be here then but that's who
[34:34] brother tells all about people that
[34:36] ain't got in your birth if you don't
[34:38] have a desire to be here you don't have
[34:39] the new birth I'm just gonna make it
[34:40] that plain you just are not born of the
[34:43] Spirit of God you might have an
[34:44] anointing every once in a while but you
[34:46] are not born of the Spirit of God if you
[34:48] don't believe if you don't like coming
[34:49] to church and listening to what God has
[34:52] to say even though it may be a boring me
[34:54] doesn't matter it's what the word says
[34:58] the word says for us to assemble
[35:00] ourselves together the word said he
[35:02] didn't say now see then well here we go
[35:04] with this laundry list well I've got
[35:06] this and I've got that sure I love to
[35:08] take vacations you love to take vacation
[35:09] if you take a vacation on Sunday that's
[35:11] fine but just just to be out because you
[35:13] can't sit what was the old saying you
[35:17] got diarrhea gots got diarrhea stay home
[35:20] with it know if it counts got diarrhea
[35:21] you put it up somewhere in you come on
[35:22] concern pray for it amen but let's get
[35:27] into this and quit but burnt but now why
[35:30] listen nice thing this other day we
[35:32] bring in this seventh seal in why why is
[35:34] everything coming full circle back
[35:37] around to the very beginning brother
[35:42] that was bringing back at the very
[35:43] beginning of justification
[35:46] sanctification to baptism the Holy Ghost
[35:47] because you know why because I've been
[35:50] bringing you the further of it now if
[35:54] you've got that inside of you you
[35:59] understand what I'm saying if you have
[36:01] listened to the voice not me but listen
[36:04] to what God has told you for the past
[36:06] year
[36:06] then when God comes back around and
[36:09] picks up here and brings you through it
[36:14] should be like that roman candle it
[36:17] should be like well that's one of that
[36:19] says that and that's why this is
[36:21] happening and that's why this is this
[36:23] way and that's why the scripture says
[36:26] what it does that's truly that will tell
[36:29] you if you're born again if you're just
[36:31] sitting here because you got sent a
[36:33] prophet and you like being here because
[36:35] of the person beside you then you need
[36:37] to do something else yeah brother Aaron
[36:40] but but Joe's not even looking at you
[36:44] leave me alone
[36:47] but really what have we come to do we
[36:49] assemble together to listen to what God
[36:52] has said and to bring the pieces of this
[36:54] puzzle together because why am I saying
[36:57] this the greatest mystery is that God is
[37:00] living in you the world can't see it
[37:04] they wonder why you act the way you do
[37:06] and if they don't wonder why the way
[37:09] that you act the way you do let's go
[37:12] back to being justified and being
[37:15] sanctified and being filled with the
[37:17] Holy Ghost because if the world can't
[37:19] tell you're different you got a problem
[37:21] because this world is so totally
[37:23] contrary to the new birth they don't
[37:27] even know how to get it okay if they
[37:30] don't know how to get it and you sit
[37:31] there you are the way you are and you do
[37:33] the things you that you do then you're
[37:36] going to be a ministry to them so there
[37:37] is your mystery which is Christ in you
[37:40] the hope of glory and not just Christ
[37:42] sitting in there not doing anything
[37:44] it's Christ in you doing the work as
[37:47] I've always said the reason come on
[37:50] people can you not when you read the
[37:52] Bible when you read the Bible but demand
[37:55] a very man that wrote the Bible supposed
[38:00] to be inside of you he's not locked down
[38:03] in your stomach he's looking through the
[38:07] same eyes you look through and he's
[38:10] looking back and that's why brother
[38:11] Branham said that he'll say the Holy
[38:14] Ghost will say amen to the word every
[38:17] you know why he'll say amen to the word
[38:19] cuz he's the one that wrote it I will
[38:23] say amen to everything that I said
[38:24] that's correct why because I'm the one
[38:26] who wrote it so the guy that wrote this
[38:29] is inside of you and you look down and
[38:30] see that and you something's got a quick
[38:33] and inside of if it doesn't then start
[38:37] at justification heart somewhere anybody
[38:47] all right but that's what the seals are
[38:50] to me it's the plan of redemption well
[38:51] what is the plan of redemption it's
[38:53] taking you from a sinner you don't go
[38:57] like this to God it's taking you from a
[39:04] sinner to God because you're gods and
[39:08] when God lives in you I got some quotes
[39:10] I was looking them up well when brother
[39:12] Louise called me out and look up
[39:14] joint-heir you look at what brother
[39:17] Brown said about join air goes join air
[39:19] if you're an air and you're enjoying
[39:21] there whatever Christ guess whatever
[39:23] Jesus Christ gets that's what you get
[39:26] amen that's why brother Graham says
[39:29] right here in Revelation the first first
[39:32] quote we read it last Sunday or Sunday
[39:33] before down it's a red-letter part he
[39:36] breaks the seals revealed gives us his
[39:40] inheritance to his people now what is
[39:42] our inheritance the opening of the seals
[39:45] that's my inheritance hey man you know
[39:49] I've got the new birth I've got that
[39:51] inheritance I've got eternal life I got
[39:54] part of the city I've got that future
[39:57] home inside of me but you know what I'm
[39:59] still in a journey because this thing's
[40:02] not redeemed yet this thing right here
[40:05] this flesh but he breaks the seals
[40:08] reveals gives us his inheritance to his
[40:11] people he gives the inheritance that he
[40:15] inherited becoming our kinsman redeemer
[40:18] and freely gives it out to us it all
[40:22] belong to him hey listen if he wanted to
[40:28] he could have walked out of that tomb
[40:30] well he wouldn't even have to come
[40:31] get on the cross but he could have
[40:32] walked out of the tomb took his
[40:33] glorified body and went right the glory
[40:35] and just stayed there but that was not
[40:37] his purpose his purpose is not to dwell
[40:41] alone his purpose is to have sons and
[40:45] daughters and the only way to have sons
[40:46] and daughters is to go back inside of
[40:49] them and genetically change that inside
[40:52] person to be the seed gene of God not
[40:57] the one that your mom and daddy brought
[40:59] now we still have to walk in this shell
[41:01] but he's fixing to have these he had his
[41:03] shell changed I'd like to read this
[41:06] right here to this brother freely gives
[41:11] it out it belonged to him he was the one
[41:13] who redeemed but instead of keeping it
[41:15] he gives it back to his people
[41:17] now what did Jesus Christ inherit he
[41:20] inherited eternal life in his body
[41:26] he did not have when he was a baby when
[41:29] he was 20 when he was 29 he did not have
[41:33] an eternal body his body was dead it was
[41:38] dying he was only 30 years old and he
[41:40] looked 50 all right but when he came out
[41:44] of that tomb that boy didn't look 50
[41:46] anymore he turned back to that same one
[41:50] that said let there be light and he was
[41:52] that young 20 year old man and that was
[41:55] the inheritance he inherited and not
[41:57] keeping that inheritance he gave it back
[41:59] to me and you eternal life in the same
[42:06] body he walked on the earth will he walk
[42:12] till that tombs sure it had been changed
[42:16] sure it had been changed but it wasn't a
[42:18] different one when he resurrected that
[42:22] body laid dead in the tomb he got back
[42:25] in that same body people he got back in
[42:29] that same body and that be - II was not
[42:32] withheld he totally went from the inside
[42:36] and went just in the moment of 2009 he
[42:40] was young man again and those cells were
[42:43] firing on a different
[42:45] wavelength and it were before they were
[42:47] firing on an eternal wavelength and he
[42:49] didn't have to eat but he could he
[42:52] didn't have to drink but he could he
[42:54] could walk through that wall he didn't
[42:56] have to open the door to go through and
[42:58] that's the inheritance that you and I
[43:00] get and listen he didn't get it in
[43:03] another dimension he had to come back
[43:06] into this dimension to get that body so
[43:11] that's the same thing gonna happen to
[43:12] you if you pass away you've got to come
[43:14] from that dimension back into this
[43:16] dimension the go get that body connect
[43:19] with it and stand at a 20 year old
[43:22] eternal body not looking different but
[43:28] looking the same folks that's Redemption
[43:31] that's not replacement most people are
[43:34] preaching replacement but you can't see
[43:36] the open of these seals and see
[43:38] replacement you take the total picture
[43:42] and you see Redemption when you see
[43:44] these seals open amen
[43:48] instead of keeping it he gave it back to
[43:50] his people
[43:51] that's his love for us now look at
[43:56] number two in the briefs now when we go
[43:58] break these seals we're gonna see it
[44:01] goes plumb back to Scripture all the way
[44:03] back for each one of these seals the
[44:05] whole thing together the whole mystery
[44:08] lays right here in these seals all right
[44:10] let's don't go looking for a mr.
[44:11] anywhere else let's look for the mystery
[44:15] what in the seals for each one of these
[44:18] seals the whole thing together the whole
[44:20] mystery lays right here in these seals
[44:23] every mystery of the Bible lays in these
[44:27] seals and the seals cannot be broke
[44:29] until this time so it was all sealed up
[44:32] until what the time that was appointed
[44:35] for it to break amen
[44:36] notice now let's finish reading remember
[44:39] the book is sealed
[44:40] remember revelations 5 the book was
[44:43] sealed but now what in Revelations 10
[44:45] here's one here's this seal then another
[44:47] one's wrapped another one's wrapped it's
[44:48] a book of redemption and the whole thing
[44:51] together makes the book and it's sealed
[44:54] with seven seals being on the backside
[44:56] kill just wound up the seal mystery is
[44:58] on the inside
[44:59] prove that to you by showing you the
[45:01] seal on the outside you can't see what's
[45:02] on the inside until the seals broke tell
[45:04] my Taurus riders from Genesis to
[45:06] Revelation is a complete plan of
[45:07] redemption
[45:08] now listen let me ask you a question and
[45:11] we're going to talk about this when we
[45:12] do the shout of the voice in them and
[45:13] the trumpet but I want to get you this
[45:15] in your mind a complete plan of
[45:17] redemption for a who our what ok a
[45:22] complete and plan for demson for what
[45:24] well it's gonna be the earth ok that's
[45:27] part of it but the complete plan of
[45:31] redemption is human beings that were
[45:35] born wrong that was born in sin shapen
[45:38] in iniquity it is the total plan to
[45:41] bring us back to the Garden of Eden
[45:44] condition before the fall now remember
[45:47] we're getting all this from Christ as
[45:49] the mystery of God revealed in brother
[45:50] Brian said if you miss it in the seals
[45:52] he said come to this message which is
[45:55] Christ as the mystery of God revealed
[45:57] now like I said before where is Christ
[45:59] now Christ is in you so that makes you
[46:05] part of the mystery a complete plan of
[46:09] redemption is revealed in these seven
[46:11] seals now a complete plan of redemption
[46:13] not partial man has got partial
[46:17] redemption since since the day of
[46:19] Pentecost they had partial redemption it
[46:23] wasn't time for their body to be
[46:25] redeemed but they had partial redemption
[46:27] because the inside man was redeemed but
[46:29] the rest of them was not and then God
[46:32] help us to get it all right let's read
[46:34] the next one number three now look what
[46:37] brother Brown said in the rising of the
[46:38] Sun he said the quickening power has
[46:40] come to us to open the seven seals what
[46:44] was it what was that the intelligence of
[46:48] a man no it was a man with seventh grade
[46:52] education preaching the greatest sermon
[46:54] he yielded itself so much - God - God
[46:57] spoke through that man and gave us the
[47:00] opening of those sealed right know the
[47:03] quickening power of God and as I said
[47:06] before the quickening power of God
[47:07] foretold this would take place now
[47:10] remember during that whole week of the
[47:12] open
[47:13] the seals there wasn't you know there
[47:17] were people being baptized in different
[47:18] things probably a few people being
[47:19] healed but what I'm what I'm saying is
[47:21] if that was the greatest thing you ever
[47:22] worked under it wasn't the healing
[47:25] campaign
[47:26] it wasn't the raising of the dead
[47:28] campaign it was the apex of the opening
[47:31] of the word campaign which is the
[47:34] quickening power of God now to have that
[47:36] quickening power of God you can do these
[47:38] other things but now remember a man
[47:41] anointed with the Holy Ghost can raise
[47:43] the dead and be just as black on the
[47:47] inside but we're talking about a man
[47:50] that was born again that was a prophet
[47:53] of God that yielded itself to God and
[47:55] that quickening power was speaking to me
[47:59] and you and it was not going through a
[48:02] denominational filter or going through
[48:04] even brother branham's own ideas because
[48:06] remember brother branham's own ideas
[48:08] were wrong when it come to the seals oh
[48:11] we hate that but I'm gonna route if you
[48:14] want me to pull it up I saw it the other
[48:15] day in in the sixth seal or seventh seal
[48:17] he said this is way beyond what I
[48:19] thought way beyond what I was thinking
[48:22] what man this prophets
[48:23] been on the scene for 40 years he said
[48:25] this is way past what I thought way past
[48:29] my own thinking first feel he was going
[48:31] back to his old nose to preach a wild
[48:33] horse rider was a was the mighty
[48:35] Conqueror which was totally wrong but
[48:40] God is never wrong we were talking about
[48:42] this morning where we were reading there
[48:43] in Hebrews what talks about immutability
[48:46] the immutability of God is unchangeable
[48:50] you got listen God can't even change his
[48:54] own word and that's what I like but now
[48:57] remember the Bible says two immutable
[49:00] things because when that immutability
[49:04] comes inside of you it makes you
[49:08] immutable Bremmer brother Bram said when
[49:12] to omnipotence meet listen God's not
[49:18] even God without you he's Elohim he's a
[49:23] he's not an object of worship here he
[49:25] was nothing before
[49:26] came along you say nothing yeah he was
[49:28] he was just self-existing he was LOM but
[49:32] the attributes and that's what I see now
[49:34] the more the more I see it now is that's
[49:36] why you and I are in the stage and the
[49:39] age that we're in right now he said well
[49:43] this is bad because it isn't so what God
[49:46] knew this is what was going to happen
[49:48] it's not a secret to God like brother
[49:51] Dale was saying that the man said we'll
[49:53] God didn't know if she's gonna die last
[49:55] night so he baptized her well you know
[49:57] God knew that before the foundation of
[49:59] the world if I'd have been there I just
[50:01] said dude God even you you's gonna say
[50:03] that before the ground a little girl
[50:05] right
[50:06] so the immutability of God but what
[50:08] we're looking at now is is we're looking
[50:10] at that transferred to me and you to
[50:14] omnipotence you got immutability you got
[50:17] in our human mind we can't be immutable
[50:20] we change all the time I've got stuff I
[50:24] got to do tomorrow and I'll guarantee
[50:26] you one of them 10 items is going to
[50:28] change but with God it's not and with
[50:31] God's Word if you become the Word of God
[50:33] can you change God's Word you have to
[50:37] yield to what that is so I said if you
[50:39] don't have the Holy Ghost
[50:41] how you gonna yield to it because
[50:42] there's nothing to pull you into that
[50:44] and brother Branham there was the
[50:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost and being a
[50:48] prophet where God spoke straight to him
[50:49] not to anybody else with a straight
[50:51] person to person there's no way you
[50:53] could have made a mistake on the seals
[50:55] he even tried to answer a question wrong
[50:57] on the sixth seal he did answer that
[50:59] question wrong and God said whoa stop
[51:03] you're not gonna make another mistake
[51:05] again
[51:06] you're gonna correct that and then we're
[51:09] going to go forward amen so that's what
[51:12] you and I are looking at we this the
[51:14] days of presuming are over the days of
[51:17] all these presuming of well I don't know
[51:19] if that brother so-and-so is right or I
[51:20] don't know sister so-and-so's right we
[51:23] got to go by what the word says let the
[51:25] word does let the word decide and divide
[51:28] because it will it will divide the joint
[51:33] in the marrow and the soul in the spirit
[51:36] everybody okay
[51:38] but listen he's the one that opened
[51:41] those seals let's read the rest of that
[51:42] quote he is the one who opened those
[51:45] seals he is those seals now who is he
[51:48] his Christ keeps crawling on up we're
[51:51] going to the rising of the Sun go to
[51:52] number right there that's good here's
[51:55] the one who opened the seals he ought
[51:57] here's those seals for the whole Word of
[51:59] God is what Christ and Christ is the
[52:02] seals that was open
[52:04] what is the opening of the seals then
[52:06] revealing Christ and where is Christ cuz
[52:13] look now we're going to get into
[52:14] something here in a minute about the
[52:17] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[52:19] with a shout now how many of you picture
[52:25] in your mind God coming from up here to
[52:30] here you just did didn't you shake your
[52:34] head yeah he's been here the whole time
[52:41] he came on the day of Pentecost he
[52:43] descended on the day of Pentecost he
[52:45] didn't go back up he stayed in the
[52:49] people but what happened was is now he's
[52:52] he's given us more revelation of word so
[52:57] that we can see exactly what was going
[52:59] on because we can't be presuming the
[53:04] days of I think is over and he said wow
[53:09] that's just human yes it's human beings
[53:11] but if you got the Holy Ghost inside of
[53:14] you I thought the Bible said he would
[53:15] lead you and guide you into all truth
[53:19] not part all truth and then so that's
[53:23] what people are looking for and you know
[53:24] what people are looking for truth some
[53:30] know where to find it some don't but you
[53:33] know what you have to be led of God and
[53:35] you can't be led of God and do things
[53:41] wrong I mean you know far as in the word
[53:43] wise what am I saying I'm saying listen
[53:46] Jesus Christ preached a perfect word
[53:48] when he was here for three and a half
[53:50] years right
[53:51] he made zero mistakes as the word now
[53:56] humanely he probably did but when he
[54:00] spoke that was the eternal Word of God
[54:03] because that's what you and I are gonna
[54:05] be judged by right so if there's a
[54:08] mistake in that then we can walk up to
[54:11] the white throne judgment we don't have
[54:13] to but if you walk up to the white
[54:14] throne judgment then now now God you
[54:16] made a mistake right there what am I
[54:18] saying if that was Christ and he was
[54:21] speaking and now it's Christ in you what
[54:24] are we doing what do we do it we've got
[54:28] to speak the same thing he spoke we've
[54:31] got to be under that same anointing that
[54:35] he was under all right everybody getting
[54:39] so far look at number five no let's go
[54:47] to number four on the seventh seal let's
[54:48] read this number four now he gets ready
[54:54] to read it we must remember that this
[54:56] seventh seal is the end of time we got
[54:58] into this couple Sundays ago it's the
[55:01] end of time of all things that's right
[55:04] the things written in the seventh sealed
[55:06] book sealed up of the plan of redemption
[55:10] and let me ask you one more time when
[55:12] when brother Branham talks about the
[55:14] plan of redemption
[55:15] you're not thinking horses and cows and
[55:17] trees right the plan of redemption is
[55:20] for humans it's for people the complete
[55:25] plan of redemption will be revealed and
[55:29] it will be manifested in a group of
[55:32] people first and then all the other
[55:35] world go back to the sixth seal listen
[55:38] the sixth seal is a purging time but
[55:41] it's because you and I are gone but when
[55:44] you and I come back we're gonna be what
[55:49] we're supposed to be had there not been
[55:50] a fall coming back in the Millennium
[55:53] with Christ the white rule and reign for
[55:56] a thousand years the sealed up of the
[55:59] plan of redemption from before the
[56:01] foundation of the world it every bit
[56:03] ends it is the
[56:05] end it is the end of the struggling
[56:07] world don't we all listen this is
[56:09] struggle and it's a struggle to come to
[56:11] church but look you gotta overcome
[56:13] something we are overcomers over comers
[56:18] of what I mean really over comers of
[56:22] what ourself ourself overcome ourself
[56:30] but it's the end of the struggling world
[56:32] it's the end of struggling nature it's
[56:36] the end of everything and there's the
[56:38] end of the trumpets the end of the
[56:40] vowels it's the end of the earth it's
[56:44] even the end of time time runs out the
[56:47] Bible said so over in Revelations 10
[56:49] roll it up and keep everything runs out
[56:53] in this time the end of the at the end
[56:57] of this seventh seal so as I said before
[56:59] the seventh seal opened in a three-fold
[57:02] manners everybody got that say man you
[57:03] should have read the book three there's
[57:06] three things that happen just like they
[57:08] Street things happen in the sixth seal
[57:10] there's three things happen in the
[57:11] seventh seal and it's just really
[57:14] strange that three things happened in
[57:15] the Christ is the mystery God revealed
[57:17] there was three parts all God was
[57:19] reporting Christ costing the church take
[57:21] her back to the Garden of Eden
[57:22] so you see three it's what three is
[57:24] perfection seven is completion all right
[57:27] everything runs in this time at the end
[57:29] of the end of the seventh seal what you
[57:31] saying I'm saying look everybody's
[57:33] looking for this great event that it's
[57:36] just going to be theirs the seventh seal
[57:38] well that woke life of you up let me do
[57:42] that again get the other half but not
[57:45] really that's what we're that's what
[57:46] we're we're thinking our thinking is
[57:49] that this thing is so great that it's
[57:51] just gonna fall on my house one day no
[57:54] it's the process if redemptions the
[57:57] process then the seven seals are
[57:59] processed
[58:00] it's a three-fold process we'll get into
[58:04] that later on a little bit later but see
[58:06] at the end of this seventh seal so in
[58:08] other words it's not going to be here's
[58:11] the seventh seal folks this is it and
[58:12] now I've got an old road out on my chart
[58:15] you see my chart
[58:19] you Tony don't look at me like that you
[58:21] see that chart see it again that's what
[58:29] the Seventh Seal is watch that's what
[58:37] the whole mystery is because some of
[58:40] your going that's crazy it's got to be
[58:43] you and me Christ is not here in person
[58:46] and if it's revealing Christ boy it's
[58:52] just one plus one is two it's us it's
[58:57] God working through a group of people
[59:01] coming to the greatest plan of
[59:03] redemption that's ever been known but
[59:05] it's coming to an end of that listen
[59:08] well me and you come to the book to a
[59:10] change of the body that ends our
[59:12] Redemption tell me what else is left
[59:17] tell me Silas in heaven
[59:21] right that's the end for me and you now
[59:26] remember that's just but remember we
[59:28] come we say we come to an end remember
[59:31] let me try to explain it like this I you
[59:34] know you go to a play or you watch a
[59:36] movie or something and you watch that
[59:38] movie and you see the movie and then it
[59:39] comes up and says then now do you just
[59:44] erase that out of your mind and know
[59:47] when it comes to an end you see every
[59:53] but you remember every bit of that story
[59:56] right so is it the end no it's the
[1:00:00] beginning it's the beginning of the
[1:00:03] thoughts you had and this great plan of
[1:00:05] redemption it's been playing itself out
[1:00:07] since the book of Genesis and you and I
[1:00:10] are standing here looking back at that
[1:00:12] play but it's not silence in heaven it's
[1:00:17] showing you that this whole thing is for
[1:00:22] you and me because when when God said
[1:00:26] let us make man in our own image
[1:00:29] folks when we stand here within a body
[1:00:31] change that is the image he was looking
[1:00:35] at back in eternity
[1:00:37] and that is the end but what does it do
[1:00:40] it ends our time but it makes this
[1:00:46] eternal body spirit and soul so let's
[1:00:50] don't look at the end as an abrupt stop
[1:00:53] and nothing else goes on no always when
[1:00:57] there's end of something there's a
[1:00:59] beginning of something else you know
[1:01:04] it's you see hope he's baby back there
[1:01:07] you see that's what she had an end of
[1:01:09] her labor right thank God there was an
[1:01:12] end of that labor Oh your sisters thank
[1:01:15] God for the ending of that labor but
[1:01:18] what was it it was a beginning of a
[1:01:22] different life same way were you new
[1:01:24] birth your old life ended right
[1:01:27] you died well you're supposed to have
[1:01:31] died your old nature
[1:01:34] died and when they died that was the end
[1:01:37] of that old you that's what brother
[1:01:41] that's what brothers for brothers what
[1:01:43] brother Jesus was telling brother
[1:01:44] Nicodemus brother brother Jesus was
[1:01:47] telling brother Nicodemus well hey if
[1:01:49] we're joint heirs then we got to be
[1:01:50] brothers brother Jesus was telling
[1:01:53] brother Nicodemus if you don't get born
[1:01:55] again you go end because you know what
[1:02:00] if you don't get born again you will
[1:02:01] have an end hey you go I mean you'll go
[1:02:05] to hell and burn for whatever and
[1:02:07] whatever and whatever and whatever but
[1:02:08] you will come to an end but now if
[1:02:12] you're in Christ you can't come to an
[1:02:14] end you come to the end of a certain
[1:02:17] journey but that's just the beginning of
[1:02:19] your eternal part amen to me that's
[1:02:23] wonderful that tells us then there is an
[1:02:26] end of the old and a bringing in of the
[1:02:28] new now we've started our journey our
[1:02:31] Christian journey though and now that
[1:02:33] journeys got to come to an end
[1:02:36] earthly because your eternal now in your
[1:02:40] soul but not in your body
[1:02:42] but when we come to this great opening
[1:02:44] of the Seventh Seal then your body is
[1:02:46] going to catch up with your soul and
[1:02:48] it's going to end what mom and daddy
[1:02:51] brought on the earth that's going to
[1:02:53] come to an end but coming to an end it's
[1:02:56] not gonna be you're gonna go just know
[1:03:01] you become to the beginning of your
[1:03:03] eternal life when we take a body change
[1:03:06] that will begin our eternal life you say
[1:03:10] you can't begin to eternal life explain
[1:03:12] it any other way somebody's planning any
[1:03:15] other way because what I'm looking at
[1:03:17] right now is not eternal but we're
[1:03:21] working to that so that one day I hope
[1:03:23] in this congregation I look out here and
[1:03:25] we all have a glorified body that was
[1:03:27] the end of what I saw before but you
[1:03:30] didn't make you another different person
[1:03:32] you're the same person you just ended
[1:03:34] that life and begun a new one amen
[1:03:38] to me that's the whole seventh self same
[1:03:41] way with Christ Christ started his life
[1:03:43] was not an eternal body Jesus Christ
[1:03:46] started his life without an eternal body
[1:03:49] but what did he what did his journey
[1:03:51] take him to if he was the seventh seal
[1:03:54] and that was he still is
[1:03:55] then his journey is what we're gonna
[1:03:57] have to take and what is the way he
[1:03:59] started his way you said I know he was
[1:04:02] born nuts
[1:04:03] he came through a wound just like you
[1:04:05] did hey man he wasn't born in sin like
[1:04:08] we were but he came through the same way
[1:04:10] we did started as a baby come up to 30
[1:04:13] years old so that was his journey and at
[1:04:16] the end of his journey his earthly life
[1:04:19] ended when they put him in a tomb but
[1:04:25] see Satan and all the other world
[1:04:26] thought that was it
[1:04:27] forever we not gonna ever see this guy
[1:04:30] again we're gonna seal it up but that
[1:04:33] was just the beginning of us that was
[1:04:37] the beginning of the bride of Jesus
[1:04:39] Christ because there was no other bride
[1:04:42] before that so now you and I are going
[1:04:47] to come to a journey and we're going to
[1:04:49] come to an end some have already been
[1:04:51] put in the tomb some are not gonna have
[1:04:53] to because Christ is our
[1:04:56] he done what he's done and I'll read it
[1:05:00] to you in just a minute when he came out
[1:05:04] of that tomb he redeemed your body he
[1:05:09] redeemed your body when he came out of
[1:05:12] that tomb and you and I if we are
[1:05:15] recipients of that then that's what this
[1:05:17] great Seventh Seal is it's an end of
[1:05:21] that old part and a beginning of a new
[1:05:26] that nobody has ever done before
[1:05:29] no one even Jesus Christ had to
[1:05:32] physically die there's somebody not
[1:05:35] going to physically die because this is
[1:05:38] going to open up in such a way so the
[1:05:42] inside is gonna take over the outside
[1:05:44] now watch let's go to number five real
[1:05:48] quick we got communion today number five
[1:05:54] seventh seal and there's three great
[1:05:56] teens that goes with it one unfolded
[1:05:57] today or yesterday the other one
[1:05:59] unfolded today and there's one thing
[1:06:01] that I cannot interpret because there's
[1:06:03] an unknown language now we're going to
[1:06:05] get into that but I want you to just
[1:06:07] give you a little thought me and brother
[1:06:09] Dale was telling like the other day one
[1:06:12] unfolded yesterday the other unfolded
[1:06:15] today and there's one thing I cannot
[1:06:18] interpret because it's in an unknown
[1:06:19] language now those are three things
[1:06:22] right one open yesterday which opened to
[1:06:27] the oh it actually opened to him while
[1:06:29] he was on the sixth seal okay then one
[1:06:34] today and then there's one I cannot
[1:06:36] interpret cuz it's in an unknown
[1:06:38] language we'll get to that them in the
[1:06:42] future but remember there's three things
[1:06:45] but I was standing right there and
[1:06:47] looked right straight at it and this is
[1:06:49] the third pole coming up and what's the
[1:06:51] third Pole it's the opening of the word
[1:06:52] it's not this and that in the other it's
[1:06:54] not fishing or a tent and all this other
[1:06:55] stuff it's the opening of the word
[1:06:57] that's what he said amen
[1:06:59] it's the opening it's the apex I was
[1:07:02] thinking it while brother Dale was
[1:07:03] preaching you look right here and you
[1:07:05] see this at the top well what brother
[1:07:07] Branham talked about he talked about
[1:07:08] that magnet
[1:07:09] what was that main to doing it was
[1:07:10] pulling up up this was metal and this
[1:07:17] has got to be metal you got to be the
[1:07:20] same substance he's coming back after
[1:07:24] his self he's not coming back after you
[1:07:28] he's coming back after his self
[1:07:30] so it's gonna magnetize and he's gonna
[1:07:33] what pull us up that's why I said if we
[1:07:37] if there's not a pull in our life for us
[1:07:40] to want to study more and come to church
[1:07:41] more more than we did before the worst
[1:07:44] of words the worst to pull what's
[1:07:49] pulling me is what's inside oh yeah
[1:07:52] there's a million other things that
[1:07:53] could pull you away different things
[1:07:55] that you know that we're human but when
[1:07:58] we got when we come down to one thing of
[1:08:00] our focus our focus is is I don't want
[1:08:03] to die I want to take a body change I
[1:08:06] don't care if I get 90 and 9 sorry some
[1:08:09] of you are gonna be a hundred and
[1:08:10] fifty-nine but well if I it doesn't
[1:08:13] matter
[1:08:13] to Abraham it didn't matter to you it
[1:08:16] shouldn't matter we gotta just keep
[1:08:18] going on and keep going on all right so
[1:08:21] that's that's my heart's desire is that
[1:08:24] somebody will get this and it'll take
[1:08:27] you to change the body and it will not
[1:08:29] come from false words false word can't
[1:08:32] change your body what brought Jesus out
[1:08:34] of that tomb was who he was who was he
[1:08:38] he was God in human flesh who are you
[1:08:41] God in human flesh all right in the Holy
[1:08:45] Spirit of God oh my that's the reason
[1:08:47] all heaven was silent she just shows us
[1:08:51] from God it fits these actually the
[1:08:52] promises from the end of the message you
[1:08:55] notice for the end of time message this
[1:08:57] seal after all he's revealed all the six
[1:08:59] seals but he don't say nothing about the
[1:09:02] seventh and the end time seal when it
[1:09:04] starts will be absolutely a total secret
[1:09:11] according to the Bible what's the secret
[1:09:17] according to the Bible
[1:09:24] what is it
[1:09:26] Colossians 1:26 even the mystery which
[1:09:30] has been hidden from ages and from
[1:09:32] generations but now it's made manifest
[1:09:34] to his Saints to whom god would make
[1:09:37] known what is the riches of the glory of
[1:09:39] this mystery among the gentiles which is
[1:09:42] christ in you the hope of glory not
[1:09:47] Christ in brother branham which
[1:09:48] transferred to know it's Christ in you
[1:09:50] the hope of glory and the endtime seal
[1:09:58] when it starts will be absolutely a
[1:10:00] total secret according to the Bible they
[1:10:05] all writes amen
[1:10:06] hey man they okay all right now let's
[1:10:13] read this next one just for your just
[1:10:16] for your reading enjoyment brother Brown
[1:10:19] said seven is God completed number so we
[1:10:21] know it had to come to the seven for us
[1:10:25] to be here now listen you're here for a
[1:10:27] purpose you're here under that
[1:10:30] completion because you're alive and
[1:10:33] you're listening listen it's got to take
[1:10:35] somebody to receive the word not just
[1:10:37] somebody that preaches the word it's got
[1:10:39] to be somebody to receive the word and
[1:10:41] you become the word as you receive the
[1:10:44] word that's what I mean if you've not
[1:10:45] received more word if you've not in just
[1:10:50] I am say year if you've not received
[1:10:52] more word and you not that you no way
[1:10:54] that's not meaning that well I used to
[1:10:56] quote 15 scriptures now unquote 18 the
[1:11:01] devil's got you beat he can quote the
[1:11:02] Bible back board but he can never get a
[1:11:05] revelation of what that thing says you
[1:11:08] can get a revelation of what that says
[1:11:10] and the revelation is the essence of the
[1:11:12] message that we're looking for all right
[1:11:14] hey man that all right so now now it's
[1:11:21] three first Thessalonians let's get to
[1:11:22] our thoughts just for a few minutes for
[1:11:26] this we say unto you by the word of the
[1:11:27] Lord that we which are alive and remain
[1:11:32] Who am I talking to we which car live
[1:11:36] and remain he's talking exactly to me
[1:11:39] and you you see how focused that can be
[1:11:44] when you read the Word of God that's not
[1:11:46] speaking to the denominational world
[1:11:47] sorry
[1:11:49] that's speaking to the Bride of Christ
[1:11:51] that is alive we which are alive and
[1:11:57] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[1:12:00] not prevent them which are asleep so
[1:12:03] that must be what we're doing now we're
[1:12:04] preventing them they're still asleep for
[1:12:08] the Lord Himself and as I told you just
[1:12:11] a few minutes ago you're looking at that
[1:12:14] scripture and you're going well that's
[1:12:15] the Lord is descending now look at this
[1:12:28] word right here
[1:12:34] so if he's in you now and he's
[1:12:37] descending there's two cells huh there's
[1:12:44] two cells and brother Brown said if you
[1:12:47] got two ones who the devil and ones got
[1:12:54] so let's don't look at this great ball
[1:12:58] of the Lord himself shall descend he's
[1:13:05] already in you but remember the
[1:13:09] dissension is the mystery the mystery is
[1:13:15] he's here already this is for everybody
[1:13:21] around you getting it he's already here
[1:13:28] listen he's not descending from you know
[1:13:32] we don't have to make a hole in the
[1:13:34] ceiling for him the Lord himself shall
[1:13:39] descend so that you can understand him
[1:13:46] not that he's not here but he's he's
[1:13:50] descending so that you can understand
[1:13:53] him you know what you take a you take a
[1:13:58] professor in college man I had one that
[1:14:01] he was a doctor low-pass good grief he
[1:14:05] was Cuban smoked them big old Cuban
[1:14:08] cigars about that long but he would tell
[1:14:10] you stuff about chemicals and compounds
[1:14:13] and he was way under in the heavens but
[1:14:20] you know what by the end of the by the
[1:14:22] end of the the hour he had descended to
[1:14:27] where I could understand what he's
[1:14:28] talking about
[1:14:32] he might get what I just said he was so
[1:14:36] and he did he has all this huge
[1:14:38] knowledge of all these different
[1:14:39] compounds but when he got finished it
[1:14:43] was laughable how simple he made it he
[1:14:45] was a suiting to me that's
[1:14:47] point of a good teacher because he had
[1:14:49] to know this stuff but he descended down
[1:14:52] in what his voice he descended in a
[1:14:58] voice that you you know what didn't
[1:14:59] change his person
[1:15:01] Sam teacher that was up there before Sam
[1:15:05] guy that I saw Monday through Friday
[1:15:07] second period of ever every day thought
[1:15:11] we knew dr. Lopez was gonna start up
[1:15:13] here but when he got done he'd be down
[1:15:16] here because the next day you had a pop
[1:15:18] quiz on what he it sent talked about
[1:15:21] today before how many of you kids the
[1:15:22] teachers do that they give you a little
[1:15:24] pop quiz well we don't make a hundred he
[1:15:27] made it so simple but we knew he was
[1:15:30] going to start up here but we knew he
[1:15:33] was going to end up down here so now
[1:15:34] pull that back up so the Lord shall
[1:15:36] descend from heaven not moving position
[1:15:42] if he's and I'm going back one more time
[1:15:45] like this hit me hard last night for the
[1:15:47] Lord Himself
[1:15:49] now if himself is up here and he's
[1:15:52] coming he's not in you but if he's in
[1:15:56] you it's the same self but what he's
[1:16:00] doing is he has descended in his word so
[1:16:04] that you can understand him more you can
[1:16:07] understand him better cuz remember
[1:16:10] brother Brown says when you got born
[1:16:12] again you got everything you needed for
[1:16:14] your journey but now you didn't stop at
[1:16:16] the start at the top of that pyramid
[1:16:18] because you still had a temper you still
[1:16:21] need a patience we still need a god and
[1:16:22] that's knowledge virtue and all these
[1:16:24] different things we still needed that
[1:16:25] but God descended descended so that we
[1:16:31] can understand him and then what's he do
[1:16:33] he takes you right back up to worries
[1:16:36] that for the Lord himself shall descend
[1:16:40] from heaven with a shout now we talked
[1:16:43] about the shout last Sunday or Sunday
[1:16:44] before laughs now let's read what
[1:16:48] brother Brown said we'll get back come
[1:16:49] back to this and man I want to see I
[1:16:51] want you to see what this voice is now
[1:16:56] once you know it's great things taking
[1:16:57] place here just a few minutes the word
[1:16:59] says here in 2nd Thessalonians that
[1:17:01] there's three
[1:17:02] so now if there's three things and if
[1:17:04] it's three things that brother branham
[1:17:06] saw in the seventh seal there's three
[1:17:07] things in the six fold the threefold
[1:17:11] purpose of the sixth seal seventh seal
[1:17:13] Christ a mystery God revealed and now we
[1:17:15] got a three-fold purpose of the Lord
[1:17:18] Himself appearing now from verse
[1:17:21] thirteen to sixteen verse there's three
[1:17:23] things that has to happen before the
[1:17:26] Lord Himself appears now remember where
[1:17:30] does he appear not in a physical form
[1:17:37] until the Millennium
[1:17:40] where does he appear take your finger
[1:17:45] and do like this ah okay quickly now so
[1:17:51] we can close the first thing happens
[1:17:53] notice a shout of voice a trumpet let's
[1:17:54] read it now see if it's right for the
[1:17:56] Lord Himself sixteenth verse shall
[1:17:58] descend from heaven with a shout with a
[1:17:59] voice the Archangel and Trump of God now
[1:18:02] I'll promise you that people sitting
[1:18:04] there listening to that sermon did the
[1:18:05] same thing well God's up here and he's
[1:18:07] got to descend down here saying that's
[1:18:10] where revelation now we've got a further
[1:18:12] manone that revelation that he's always
[1:18:15] been inside of you he's descended in his
[1:18:20] word because watch I'll show you the
[1:18:22] second three things happen a voice a
[1:18:26] shout a voice of trumpet has to happen
[1:18:28] before Jesus appears now shout Jesus
[1:18:30] does all three of them when he's
[1:18:33] descending now I want to ask you a
[1:18:36] question what good is a shout kinda like
[1:18:40] being in the bathroom taking a shower
[1:18:42] all by yourself there's nobody in the
[1:18:43] house and you're just saying and you
[1:18:45] know what you sing like Mike like
[1:18:48] whatever the greatest singer in the
[1:18:49] world is right man you can carry a tune
[1:18:52] and you know you you you clap for your
[1:18:55] own self but what good is that what good
[1:19:00] is it that's what I'm telling you we got
[1:19:04] to see these that
[1:19:09] he's not descending to us he's
[1:19:13] descending in us there's a big
[1:19:16] difference he's not descending to us
[1:19:19] he's descending in us all right now look
[1:19:22] three things - the boys a shout of
[1:19:24] oyster trumpet and even with the boys
[1:19:27] you can be the greatest orator in the
[1:19:28] world and you can set a pin you can give
[1:19:30] a speech for three hours if the if the
[1:19:32] auditorium is empty what have you done
[1:19:34] but see God's not that way because
[1:19:36] remember his word will not return Boyd
[1:19:38] he has to have somebody to listen and
[1:19:39] respond to what's being said three
[1:19:42] things has to happen before Jesus
[1:19:43] appears now shout Jesus does all three
[1:19:45] of them when he's he's he's descending a
[1:19:47] shout what is a shout it's the message
[1:19:49] going for it now look the message the
[1:19:54] Living bread of life bringing forth the
[1:19:57] bride he connects that right to the
[1:20:01] bride the message bringing forth the
[1:20:04] bride that's what this message is for
[1:20:07] it's not to bring forth another prophet
[1:20:11] it's not to bring forth William Branham
[1:20:14] again it's to bring forth a bride amen
[1:20:19] let's go to the next one should be the
[1:20:26] rapture all right look the first thing
[1:20:27] when he starts descending from heaven
[1:20:30] there's a shout what is it the message
[1:20:32] now remember the message didn't come
[1:20:35] from up there the message came to us
[1:20:36] through a prophet that had the message
[1:20:40] inside of him he was a messenger of the
[1:20:45] message huh there's a shout what is it a
[1:20:53] message to get the people together so it
[1:20:55] has to have a response we've responded
[1:20:59] to that something responded by getting
[1:21:02] the new birth so I'm responding by
[1:21:04] getting a new birth and growing in grace
[1:21:05] and knowledge some God that received it
[1:21:08] and keeps on moving and keeps on going
[1:21:10] there's all different things a message
[1:21:12] comes forth first now lap'd Remington
[1:21:16] that's what we're in right now we're in
[1:21:19] lamp trimming time we have oil if you've
[1:21:22] got the new birth
[1:21:22] you have oil you have the lamp you have
[1:21:25] heard - what the voice of the bridegroom
[1:21:28] say wake up because you were part of the
[1:21:31] five wise virgins a message comes forth
[1:21:36] first now lap trimming time rise and
[1:21:39] trim your lamps what watch was it the
[1:21:41] seventh not the six the seventh behold
[1:21:45] the bridegroom cometh rise and trim your
[1:21:48] lamps and they did some of them found
[1:21:51] they didn't even have any oil in their
[1:21:54] lamps that's in people that think that
[1:21:56] you always was eternal till they've
[1:21:59] never been talking to you birth and man
[1:22:02] we were talking about that last night
[1:22:04] you know he as we were talking and I'm
[1:22:08] not and I'm not being critical of people
[1:22:10] I'm just telling you I'm I'm critical
[1:22:12] because if they've got a congregation
[1:22:15] the people in that congregation of
[1:22:17] people is taking their word as the word
[1:22:21] they're not gonna change you can only go
[1:22:25] as high as your pastor so if he's pretty
[1:22:27] if this brother preaches that there's no
[1:22:29] written on long enough redemption for
[1:22:30] your body then people are never gonna
[1:22:32] come to a place of having faith for a
[1:22:36] body change you and I we gonna come to a
[1:22:39] body change because we got faith to come
[1:22:41] to a body change because this message in
[1:22:44] this church is in the body change hey
[1:22:46] man
[1:22:47] a resurrection antibodies change their
[1:22:50] bye all right without okay but you just
[1:22:54] feel for the people rise and trim your
[1:22:58] lamp why there was five vote foolish
[1:23:00] virgins that thought they were they were
[1:23:02] virgins they didn't have any old why
[1:23:07] they were taught wrong hello
[1:23:12] they were taught wrong that's a whole
[1:23:14] thing being taught right it's lamp
[1:23:18] trimming time we're in the seventh watch
[1:23:20] the bridegroom call comes from where
[1:23:23] heaven now it comes from here I'll prove
[1:23:28] it to you just a second let me go
[1:23:29] through this real quick don't worry
[1:23:31] about the other one let's go to Joshua
[1:23:33] remember Joshua commanded the people
[1:23:34] saying you shall not shout
[1:23:37] not going back y'all going by that one
[1:23:40] yeah there you go
[1:23:41] good Joshua white spoken to the people
[1:23:45] remember Joshua commanded the people
[1:23:47] they walked around that thing and didn't
[1:23:49] say a word but you know what they were
[1:23:50] doing they were doing what Joshua told
[1:23:53] them to do and they were walking and
[1:23:57] wasn't saying a word but you know what
[1:23:58] they were doing something because God
[1:24:00] told them that last day he said you
[1:24:02] walked seven times around that city and
[1:24:05] don't say a word
[1:24:06] listen the old saying is silence is
[1:24:10] maddening silence is maddening can you
[1:24:15] imagine a city as big as Atlanta with
[1:24:18] walls all up so high that they run
[1:24:21] chariot races around it and everybody is
[1:24:23] looking and there's just a little group
[1:24:25] of people and they go around one time
[1:24:28] don't say a word they go around second
[1:24:32] time no spell word they're just marching
[1:24:34] you know they're not over there
[1:24:36] sharpening their swords and getting
[1:24:38] their spirit their marching third time
[1:24:41] somebody's going hey how many times have
[1:24:43] they been around in here well this is
[1:24:44] number four I think they walked around
[1:24:48] seven times he never said a word never
[1:24:51] said work silence but on that seventh
[1:24:56] time Joshua commanded them to shout and
[1:25:01] they did the shout
[1:25:04] it wasn't Joshua it was two people all
[1:25:08] right let's go to the next one so meet
[1:25:13] to me that is I mean you brother Brahim
[1:25:16] said thirty minutes of silence it's not
[1:25:19] it's not a said it's not what do you say
[1:25:21] it's not so bad when something's going
[1:25:23] on but when something just stops for 30
[1:25:24] minutes seems like an eternity says that
[1:25:28] would be maddening though to see just
[1:25:31] dead people walking in dead silence and
[1:25:32] all of a sudden in that seventh when
[1:25:34] they just let her go and whatever they
[1:25:36] standing on falls out from under him
[1:25:38] that's God showing you something
[1:25:41] now look now the rapture message the
[1:25:45] shout the voice in the trumpet shout the
[1:25:47] mess a messenger getting the people
[1:25:50] ready
[1:25:50] the second is a voice of the
[1:25:53] resurrection the same voice now remember
[1:25:58] Jesus is not here on this earth until
[1:26:02] the Millennium but there will be a
[1:26:05] resurrection and a body change before we
[1:26:09] leave okay
[1:26:11] the second is a voice of the
[1:26:14] resurrection the same voice that a loud
[1:26:21] voice in Saint John 11 38 to 44 that
[1:26:23] called Lazarus from the grave
[1:26:26] getting the bride together the shout
[1:26:32] then the resurrection of the dead sea to
[1:26:36] be caught up with it now watch the three
[1:26:39] things take place the next is what was a
[1:26:41] trumpet a boys he gets a little confused
[1:26:43] a shout a voice of trumpet that's what
[1:26:45] it is now watch this now the third thing
[1:26:47] is a trumpet which always at the feast
[1:26:49] of the trumpets it's calling the people
[1:26:51] to the feast now that will be the bride
[1:26:53] supper so this third thing that trumpet
[1:26:56] is going to call us to what the bride
[1:26:58] suffered the Lambs supper with the bride
[1:27:00] in the sky that's when we leave the
[1:27:03] first thing comes forth is his message
[1:27:05] calling the bride together the next
[1:27:09] thing is a resurrection of the sleeping
[1:27:12] bride the ones that died back in the
[1:27:14] other ages they're caught together now
[1:27:17] who is that coming through the bride the
[1:27:25] voice of the resurrection will be in the
[1:27:27] bride and it's the same voice they said
[1:27:31] Lazarus come forth so it can't be two
[1:27:35] people all right in the trumpet the
[1:27:39] feast of heavens encounter while that's
[1:27:41] the thing takes place friends we're
[1:27:42] right there ready now the only thing the
[1:27:45] church coming out has got to lay before
[1:27:47] the Sun to ripen look I want you to read
[1:27:51] the rest of this you're not blind people
[1:27:52] I'm talking to you today paragraph 156
[1:27:55] you are not you're not blind people
[1:27:57] you're sensible people and if I stood
[1:28:01] here and said those things for prejudice
[1:28:03] I said because its life because I'm
[1:28:07] responsible to God for saying it and I
[1:28:09] must say it and my message this is that
[1:28:13] right here all the time knowing back
[1:28:15] there under healing and so forth like
[1:28:17] that was just to catch the people's
[1:28:19] attention knowing the message would come
[1:28:23] now that wasn't a message the healing
[1:28:26] campaign wasn't the message he just said
[1:28:28] it I'm reading you what your prophet
[1:28:30] said knowing the message would come and
[1:28:35] here it is and them seven seals open
[1:28:40] those mysteries and showing those things
[1:28:42] is what happened I didn't know it he
[1:28:47] does now next one number 10
[1:28:52] godless evil age no look watch this this
[1:28:56] is where I miss is where I'm really took
[1:28:59] too long first I guess you listen only
[1:29:01] to one voice my sheep know my voice now
[1:29:06] remember it's the shout the voice and
[1:29:09] the trumpet there's got to be a shout to
[1:29:11] gather us together and then a voice to
[1:29:14] speak to us and through us but what is
[1:29:17] his voice any man's voice is his word so
[1:29:26] there's got to be a shout right to
[1:29:29] gather the people together and that
[1:29:31] voice is a voice of the bride a man's
[1:29:40] voice is his word and this is it the
[1:29:45] Bible not one word to be added to or
[1:29:47] taken from it just stay right with that
[1:29:49] voice a stranger they will not follow a
[1:29:52] denomination now let's look at number 11
[1:29:54] real quick 11 and 12 oh I want to get to
[1:29:57] what's this what do you say in Malachi 4
[1:30:00] would restore restore back the original
[1:30:03] Pentecostal faith now look this is what
[1:30:05] is the first part of his message back to
[1:30:07] the people with the same Pentecostal
[1:30:09] message the same Pentecostal sign the
[1:30:12] same Pentecostal evidence the same God
[1:30:14] the same power the same teaching

[1:30:18] pillow fighter stroke pull down a road
[1:30:20] down to Damascus amongst us today not

[1:30:26] same thing you did in that day uniting

[1:30:31] world uniting we see the churches
[1:30:33] uniting
[1:30:34] we see the bride uniting uniting with
[1:30:37] the voice remember I just read you the
[1:30:41] brother Brown said the man's word is his
[1:30:44] voice his voice is the word right so
[1:30:47] let's put that in there uniting with the
[1:30:49] voice and the voice is God and as the
[1:30:54] voice as the bridegroom being the voice
[1:30:56] and the bridegroom being the hearer of
[1:31:00] the voice they come together in the
[1:31:02] union they were not read you're not like
[1:31:04] a wedding see they're getting ready for
[1:31:06] a wedding and they become one the word
[1:31:08] becomes you you become the word the
[1:31:11] voice becomes you you become the voice
[1:31:16] Jesus said at that day you know what all
[1:31:19] the father is I am all I am you are and
[1:31:22] all you are I am and that day you'll
[1:31:25] know that I'm the father the father me
[1:31:26] and I in you and you and me see at that
[1:31:28] day what day this day we find out the
[1:31:32] great hidden mysteries of God being
[1:31:35] revealed oh how I like that all right
[1:31:41] let's read this last one then we'll be
[1:31:42] finished mmm it is the rising of the Sun
[1:31:44] now notice this quickening power Zoe
[1:31:47] bringing the voice or the word the mind
[1:31:51] that was in Christ was in you then I'm
[1:31:55] trying to show you that you when you
[1:32:00] raved when God raised Jesus from the
[1:32:03] dead he raised up you also
[1:32:08] we're gonna believe what prophecy okay
[1:32:11] all right we're gonna believe what he
[1:32:13] said right when God raised Jesus from
[1:32:15] the dead he raised up you also and also
[1:32:19] quicken to life with him
[1:32:21] you are now quicken to life although
[1:32:25] then you were but an attribute in his
[1:32:28] thoughts what we weren't people running
[1:32:30] around but when Jesus resurrected we
[1:32:32] resurrected inside of him amen
[1:32:36] if that same spirit that raised up Jesus
[1:32:39] from the dead dwell in you it'll also
[1:32:40] quicken your mortal body that's in
[1:32:41] Romans 8 when we gonna start believing
[1:32:45] it but God had saw all in him at the
[1:32:49] finish when God looked down upon the
[1:32:51] body
[1:32:52] now watch the spirit left him in the
[1:32:55] Garden of Gethsemane now this is where a
[1:32:57] lot of people in the message say that
[1:32:59] that brother branham means that Jesus
[1:33:01] just died a man he didn't say he had to
[1:33:03] die man he said he had to die , a man he
[1:33:08] had to die as a man what spirit left him
[1:33:13] there anointing that was on him for his
[1:33:15] ministry and he couldn't die we spoke on
[1:33:19] that many times before the met the
[1:33:21] anointing that came on him at the river
[1:33:23] Jordan didn't make him God but it sure
[1:33:26] gave him a ministry for three and a half
[1:33:28] years that he could not be killed they
[1:33:31] tried to kill him many many times but
[1:33:33] what happened that same spirit left off
[1:33:35] of him in the Garden of Gethsemane so he
[1:33:38] could die as a human mortal man that was
[1:33:42] God God anointed that flesh which was
[1:33:46] human flesh what I'm not gonna try to
[1:33:49] put words in brother Brian's mouth but
[1:33:51] what's he saying God anointed that flesh
[1:33:52] so he couldn't die he had to lift that
[1:33:56] spirit off of him well if that gnawing
[1:33:59] off of him so he could die and he didn't
[1:34:03] if he'd have went up there as God he'd
[1:34:05] have never died that kind of death can't
[1:34:07] kill God and you still can't kill God
[1:34:09] but he didn't have to do it but remember
[1:34:13] he went there with you in him
[1:34:18] see God had never separated the bride
[1:34:22] from the groom yet so when God looked
[1:34:25] down upon the body of Christ he saw both
[1:34:28] male names the body you read that again
[1:34:32] huh hey buddy wake when God looked down
[1:34:37] upon the body of Christ he saw both male
[1:34:40] and female it was all redeemed in that
[1:34:46] one buddy see they are one same same
[1:34:53] word voice the same word spoke of the
[1:34:59] groom speaks of the bride there's no
[1:35:05] separation you can't separate Jesus
[1:35:10] Christ from his bride the same word the
[1:35:17] same voice spoke of the groom speaks of
[1:35:21] the bride there's not two separate
[1:35:24] entities here let's stand our feet you
[1:35:29] say brother wait you just making us too
[1:35:32] close we have not made it close enough
[1:35:36] because we you and I kids no way we can
[1:35:40] change our own body people have tried to
[1:35:45] substitute it by facelifts and paint and
[1:35:53] hairdo and whatever more but God is
[1:35:58] going to change you back to a 20 year
[1:35:59] old person and angle you know what it
[1:36:03] ain't gonna it ain't gonna upset him it
[1:36:05] ain't gonna make him no less God it's
[1:36:07] gonna make him do exactly what he said
[1:36:09] he was gonna do like brother Browns
[1:36:12] brother brown said right there whatever
[1:36:14] scripture speaks at the bridegroom also
[1:36:16] speaks of you the bride he descended
[1:36:22] what a bride
[1:36:24] he's been here the whole time but he's
[1:36:28] descending so that we can understand him
[1:36:30] through a shout to get the people
[1:36:33] together you you heard a shout one day
[1:36:35] when you were out in the world and doing
[1:36:37] the things a lot of you didn't grow up
[1:36:38] in the message like some of us did some
[1:36:40] of you were out doing these things of
[1:36:41] the world but when you heard that voice
[1:36:44] well you heard the Xiao Yu heard the
[1:36:47] message well what was the message the
[1:36:49] shouting the voice is pretty much the
[1:36:50] same okay it's the same thing but then
[1:36:55] when you come into the message see now
[1:36:57] we're hearing the voice not just the
[1:36:59] voice of somebody speaking we're hearing
[1:37:02] the voice of the resurrection where we
[1:37:05] say there's no death in what we're
[1:37:06] talking to you about go to the
[1:37:08] denomination's they know one thing's for
[1:37:10] sure
[1:37:11] under tradition they're all wound up and
[1:37:14] under tradition they're all going to go
[1:37:17] to the white throne judgment and under
[1:37:19] tradition they're going to a seven-year
[1:37:21] tribulation amen I said tradition that's
[1:37:27] what they believed but it never was
[1:37:30] spoke up in the Bible so it's the
[1:37:32] tradition you and I do not live by
[1:37:35] tradition we live by the absolute
[1:37:38] perfect Word of God amen
[1:37:42] god bless your heart let's bow our head

[1:37:58] little bit higher tell us who we already
[1:38:01] are not what we're going to become but

[1:38:07] that body you saw a redeemed bride and

[1:38:14] able to look face to face with your
[1:38:17] bride and lord I know you will Lord

[1:38:23] voice of the resurrection it's
[1:38:24] absolutely now it's resurrecting us
[1:38:27] sitting us in heavenly places but that
[1:38:30] same voice that called Lazarus from the
[1:38:32] grave will come forth to a bride with
[1:38:35] enough faith to bring the people that
[1:38:39] have been passed away for 2,000 years
[1:38:43] in the dust of the earth and in the
[1:38:45] ocean and all the different places that
[1:38:47] that they passed away and Lord what
