TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] all right okay now we're in the book of Romans I know y'all work well it's brother Stan Stan no smelly anyway alright here we go now we're in chapter two of the book Roman and I'm just leaning all kind of good stuff out of this going one by one so I hope you guys are too and it's fitting right along with the steals I think the whole Bible that's the seal that are locked up until God opened on to the prophet in 63 and now 50 something years later I believe he's opening them up to us as individuals we are we have the we have the right player the team we've got everything right here - there's nothing else coming I believe 144,000 are growing up over there and getting of age where they can understand the document when it comes to them and it's just an exciting time that we know now because remember even even in 63 and all that what brother ever said you're not getting it no words until we did another quote around the coming of the Lord these things would be made known I believe in sentence seven seals and now coming in the Lord has been happening we know since the day of Pentecost that's just coming back in the people sense that they've been caught not finish off 1906 I'm gonna back off a t30 okay back then and then you say well that the coming of the Lord then is to the it's work and it is because words been revealed all the way down through but this is the culmination this is what everything's been done this is when you are not talking to Paul talking to a bunch of Romans that he's fixing to go see and he's talking to them God's talking through them to them but God's talking through him to me and you okay so it's not the Romans that he's talking to now it's me and you is talking today and then we can all look back we've got all this equipment I was thinking the other day you know we got all this to our disposal we just shouldn't be any questions I don't know what the message is about truly it's not hair and dress it's not living a good Christian life they did that before the message got here right now so it's not all that but that is included but still there's an element like we were saying not long ago there's a supernatural element and even brother Branham I read it this afternoon where we're going to I want everybody to get real long enough and Greaves that for this afternoon we'll talk about marriage and forth okay we are gonna talk about but we got a look at in the spiritual sense because in the natural sense you have different grace there's no grace there's no grace in marriage before time if you had the world but under the grace that was given then the prophet of God said because of a supernatural revelation of the open the sealed now I see like I said Cindy I see where he got the revelation I believe which is then the third seal that were in now but now that didn't totally finish it because he the fifth seal and open up that fifth seal now he God opened up that fifth seal to the Prophet showing him there's a group of people that did all these dirty things but you know was grace giving an eternal life since he went to that group of people so there for me is the grace of marriage in divorce because listen the grace of magazine divorce extends to what we do in the flesh you mean it extends to what we do in flesh because if not then a sister animal is saying a few minutes ago once we realized that the new person will a couple by this afternoon because there was some questions during this week from from people that I want to clarify all the new birth I'm glad they liked the cover because we talked about he might cover this morning I won't cover the second or two that burnt that that I'll make sure that Souls dead gotta be dead there's your dirty marriage and divorce listen if your husband dies if I were to pass away James free to marry only in the Lord but she doesn't have to look back and worry about a marriage in divorce situation right now I'm coming onto this right here because I'm talking about circumcision in just a few minutes and that all kind of in together but see if you do have a living husband then you got to find some kind of grace because in the Bible you can't have it right it's unlawful and you mark all of you have a name calling a dolphin but then you got all these other different situations so Lexi what I really going getting imagine horse but we are going to cover because God had to divorce Israel to manage the Gentiles because they come under circumcision fleshling you understand I'm saying we're all adults here in the New Testament if you walked up to a guy and he says well where are you from well I'm here alive show me well do you take you behind Andy show you the understand because Gentiles circumcised right hand truly uncircumcised in their flesh but see that's a tight claim wave of marriage and divorce it's the type of Christ in the church Christ can't be married to two three people at the time that's why the Gentile bride we'll talk about this afternoon the new birth is the only thing that takes away your man in the war situation then say in your soul in your soul okay because the rest is just giving eternal life it's watching on judgment and all these other things impartation of eternal life not the very thing because the very god of heavens got to come in and burn that old nature kill that old nature and then he marries you but you've still got that spirit realm thank God I can't see her person when Ron starts sleep and he'll not off naturally because when I look at her I don't like you and anyway I do I do think of her hidden respect of being married to you and having to put up with all that Bailey um here we go and the horse thing you know me but now remember to though the things we do in our body had to be covered if I understand that they look things man we did it our body had to be covered because of misinterpreted theology so it was a I said wasn't man's fault but it was man's fault but it wasn't the general population it was what they were taught listen we grow up into what we're talking now usually about what you're being taught right okay so they live by what they were called which was ok to the divorce and okay commands you can't live well you know get rid of them and get you know fines you wanted to live with no that's not what I said that's not what I said right it's not didn't say that okay so in that same way with him I don't want listen a final minute to Christ I don't want him playing around with no other woman no other bride he's mine he's hot and when we realize that say we'll realize what we have what's this relation say when we realize truly what we got already inside of us not coming here already then we realized that a lot of these things that were worried about to me takes all the worry away to me the opening of the same seal takes a lot of worry away from anything that I've thought before about myself or previously thought about what's going on what's going to happen it's just really settled everything the opening of the seal should do to you it should several things we should not be tossed about we're getting the wrong as they were talks bill because what he's talking to the Jews but he knows he's fishing to talk to the Romans because they're Gentile they're uncircumcised they lived under uncircumcision you know but that was a time that was a time look what the old flesh being put away but when we get on further we're going to look at when the unclean spirit goes down the lamb where'd they go Alan if you're not born again it goes down to your soul so there was an unclean spirit in your soul and it was called you and the very nature you are I mean you know say the tax to sell to you because of what you come wrong you were born wrong that's why you needed a new birth right and I'll get to it this afternoon because some have formulated in their mind even in the church that you can receive the new birth after you're dead I think never go have a never will happen like that but it's a question in people's mind is the question in people's mind and you got an answer and and people and people thought ooh can't be listen when you talk about the new birth it is something totally different than you turn alive but yet it is eternal but there's an impartation of eternal life there's what the Old Testament died there's what the fifth sealed you got there's worked up foolish virgin gift and there's 144,000 gift that has nothing to do with anybody not one thing nothing I will get them self this afternoon that's why I told then that third seal showed me that there if there's not a dad then you're alive while you're dead and that's the inside person you're alive walking a lot of me a lot but you're dead inside if you don't have the new birth then you still got the old you living inside there's no way God can marry you there's no way God can be your husband and you can't have an intimate relationship with him father have learn a lord lord have we not watch spoken comes cast out Devils and he said depart from me I never knew look that word new is the same word it says Adam knew his wife that word new is a sexual relationship between a man and a woman basically that's what it is Adam knew his wife and no didn't he just walked up to and say hey I know you that's nobody now he knew her in a sexual way now God doesn't know it's in a sexual way but we still have to have a read invisible union again and read it with a little more understand you read a visibly Union now and you'll see exactly why that it is an invisible union nobody's gonna know abut you and gone but you can't have anything alive in you if you do then Christ in later on when I read the scripture like Sunday that's right if we be dead we'd be dead we're dead then weird ever saying but what alive to Christ was he comes and kills that all nature with what Holy Ghost and fire killed that old nature now that will make her stay it like you thank you for that o negs is dead now that has nothing to do with a spiritual man now he's motivated more by what's inside because we we need the illness of the world because the one inside of us was the motivating factor the real you within there when that nature attacks to it to do all any when you come to a from telling the your return guard down then that makes her stays attached to that solvent and you have to give an account because you're still alive there was no death there has to be de ad and that's the name of my sermon this afternoon is going something must die some kinda yeah okay something's got that because look if you're if your sister Rebeka your husband's packing your freedom Emery and there's no consequence there's no scripture that says she came down anymore but there's nothing there's no say that's why I said now when we read there is therefore now no condemnation think of yourself and even the situations that you're in now there's condemning you you're the only one is condemning you've got nothing now the things we do every day yes we get condemned and we say sorry Lord forgive me sorry I did that I I a situation yesterday and I'm just going to tell it I'm like that pretty much other still I I didn't tell a lot I told a little widely okay but it wasn't a full truth and I apologize that my total lady has to a compliment and check I'll go back and check to make sure but there was a customer told me a long time ago you can leave your package he didn't say you can leave it at my mailbox but he said if I'm not here you can leave it down there well down there I mean his mailbox is a mile from his house he's got one of the communities where there's like ten boxes and everybody lives in this and I hear they all come to a little place so I told the guy he can lay them laying across them it was a big old long thing gone from somebody and he explained and there was no problem with that but I told her I said all he told me we could do that well then I felt that look that look that little back up this Dominica I think is actually what he saying so anyway so you straighten it out though so you keep going home and and like him today you like I like worried about it now no you'll still be worried about but if you'll get rid of it right in five minutes you didn't take five minutes and get rid of that get it done and then I give you an example today that you're not all perfect but you know what there's something inside of me because they used to tell them all the time when I wasn't in when the Lord wasn't inside he used to tell them all the time and you know what there was no condemnation okay because there was no condemned ER in there there was no judge you know so you see that so that's how you know that God's at least try to keep us time keeping straight yeah cuz we're warlocks you've done the same thing you've told a little something maybe not a half drinker not exactly you know exactly verbatim what the guy said or if everybody don't want the person say or you know what you you're talking about something to happen and it really didn't happen exactly that way okay we're humans human being but there is what there is a grace there that the inside guy never did that so what the inside got doing is now he's going come on man that didn't come from me I come from that spirit realm part that comes from this part that walks around out here in this world could we really RPP we have a spiritual being of us that day we do the things of life right then there's an inside of the inside of this profession eternally never standing it never had a bad day it never had a pain but we gotta realize to let that person work we have let others work and by the time they got through the filter about here it got so diluted until you know we thought they were okay know things a little bit when that little tug hits you you go wait a minute let me correct that that way if I correct it now ain't gotta correct it 10 years from now or 10 minutes from now or invade from them so anyway let's get into what we were done back in romans but there's no respect of persons with God we kind of I want to laugh back over but we came on the back right here for as many of us have sinned without the law shall also perish without law and it's meaning that stand in the law shall be judged by the law tonight stomach the Old Testament and if you're not born again you're gonna perish without the law as many as that stand in the law shall be judged by the law now look if we're born again today we're not judged by the law we're hitting in the Word of God okay that's why we won't go to judgment what won't go to jail no way male but I've been judged because of what I accepted inside that new birth is what took the old birth and knowledge I'm not the son of Charles another Brandon brother around said well now what was he talking about he remembered he was an alien no he just knew who was working in his life right now what he's going to interpolate for three verses he made a statement in verse 12 for may have sampled alcohol shall also perish without law and if man have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law now if you'll skip all that in the day when God secrets of men by Jesus Christ part of my gospel that's a little cut and drive but when he interpolates what when we come to missus now for not the error of the law are just before God but the doer of the law shall be justified Collini Old Testament truly they made it a book Ruth than it was because it was written down says do this don't do that right for when the Gentiles which have not the law in other words they were covered under the law do by nature of the things contained in the law in other words just like what brother have said about these virtues there's many people in this world that have natural virtue knowledge temperance patience now there's a lot of people that they just don't get mad that don't mean one thing that they're Christian know one thing if you're not born again that you don't want to know they just got in nature their DNA from this one and this one initial initial there's a nature that falls down to do all that good or bad yes your husband is just like that you can't make Mukhtar lad but now if he's not born again that's not the temper if we're talking about right okay they all right with that so let's so by nature the Gentiles did these things you know that was a good Gentile they had everyone just a bunch of sure they were label called heathens but you had some good Gentiles that that God went to like the Corinthian do you think well they were pretty bad him you know God God went to the Corinthians and he went to the Thessalonians and he went to the Romans and you know what he done he converted a group of people that was in there so there must be something about them that he like listen if God ever attaches itself to anything it's because he likes it do you see something we don't see a man comes remember brother Ron said wink when the Spirit came down like the DOS says behold this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell that's the same thing happen at your new birth God comes in your soul burns the old nature out it says I am pleased to be right here Wow yeah wow that's profound you say no I happened Jesus that has ever born again believer it's gotten to go that is the new birth for when the Gentiles have enough to log do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the having not the law are laws themselves then many Gentiles had never ever read Ten Commandments that's why he's talking about they don't have a at that moment in time they didn't have a loan their doorstep or over the door you understand what I'm saying like everybody's going out in the front yard but there are laws themselves now see I like this because I see grace in this because of heathen natives Indians never heard of Jesus Christ they're gonna be judged the property guy said by what by their life by their law not the ten commandments by their law which show the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the meaning while accusing or else excusing one another in other words their conversation and honey it's going pretty we want to strike this week so we won't see a bunch of that and the day when God shall judge the secrets of men hearts by Jesus Christ according to my gospel he's won over that last Sunday behold our called a Jew and rest us in the wall and make us the most of God now remember he's sitting there talking to Jews but he's heading to the Romans so he's got to take one he's got to the Romans okay and knowest his will and approves the things that are more excellent being instructed out of the law come remember the law and the prophets were until Jesus Christ so the whole Old Testament that was one of the questions that was asked and they said brother Dale said it that the Old Testament Saints got the new birth they ain't never happened never happened and brother they'll never say that but see you see sometimes we formulated in our mind and you do the same thing when you say I saw her I think you need to stop that okay because we laugh with other people but some of you than the last thing we've had other conversations that you've been robbed - so we've all been wrong in ourselves sometime right so but we're going to try to allow them that week that I think this opening of the seals that it ought to be aligned and made perfect and we ought to be able to do it and I say we this vessel brother now we should be confident enough that God can use us to get to you to write them the wrong okay you just gotta listen to the word don't look at the person you know listen to the word listen to what the word said and notices will and approves the things that are more excellent being instructed out of the law and are confident that thou thyself are a godly blind a lot of them with your darkness an instructor of the foolish what which is coming a teacher of AIDS which has the form of knowledge and of the truth and the law all right who don't didn't people now they're worried that thou therefore which teachest another teachest thou not thyself thou that preaches to man should not steal that's now steal now you must have caught something I won't say this and in a way that you'll understand it now where's he going he's going to Rome he's gone the Romans have a spirit about okay the Romans conquered the world and they did horrible things to people in vain and under a religion okay under religion they did that now what's he call as picking up the spirit of that thing because what happened though about forty since another because remember the priest would stand up and they do all their rituals yet they were molesting boys re even had prostitutes there was even one they don't like to do this but if you look back in the history of the Pope's there was a Pope to have concubines yeah okay what do you see if you teach us stuff so what's he doing he's telling them Romans they love you've got you've got guys up there preaching the message and they're doing the same thing that they're saying for you not too big no you have a feeling the message do the same thing I'm saying severity gets known people now that says the man should not commit adultery does now come in the door three you say well I'm not spared no expense still here you've like said we've had people in the message got that priest like a house on fire on the windy day I heard him several times yet he was living with a 14 year old girl and a 30 year old woman and got caught and put in jail and all these things are getting a good deal that he's he's paid his due but he would preach anyone living it gotta come out somewhere now that abhorrest idols thus thou commit sacrilege in other words are you sacrificing things to Heidel and he taught reduced all of the Romans he's talking to that spirit he's not talking to a person he started this spirit we talk to spirits we don't talk to person we talk spirit come a spirit to get on all of us all of us and we got to get rid of those because remember the unclean spirit goes out of a man if you're born again that pert that wasn't in your soul but that could be attached to the outside of the middle man the memory reason cause perspective machinations everybody got back to okay so that's what this is for when the tracks was going out and sister Shepards dream that was trying to inside of that person wasn't in his soul it was in his spirit realm not in the body forget the body forgive divine the body does not sin can't sing it's the product this thing it's dying but it cannot stand without something motivated okay so the trash was going out of the look when you get born again you got every bit of it you got everything you need but now look I'm gonna tell you this afternoon y'all get it a little bit early we can sleep a little while y'all laughs you do because we say them the new persons of Earth of the word that is true to the degree it is not a verse of all the work it's the work of the word that you have and you took believe on the Lord Jesus Christ now shall we say Genesis 1:26 that man came to me and my neighbor but no I didn't the day I got born again didn't stand up here and say these things you can sit in the congregation and the listen like you did the first day you got born yet no you weren't listen it's just like it's just like honestly it's just like being married in that first you know honey moment man who cares about bills and where we you know you're just drunk when you and your wife you know is that one thing did you worry the night of your wedding honestly did you worry about paying bills the next two three no you know mom may have but the rest of you come but really I make so god done that he protected you as an uber just a baby right he lets you play a little bit so you've got all this good luck this isn't what I'm saying is is this is not this is not something like well Adele saying no it's not something that comes from somewhere right it's already in there we just gotta live I so it is a birth of the word that you held and that you were born again but it's not a birth of the whole work the whole words there because where do you get your nourishment you get it from the Word of God right preaching studying and all that so it comes from inside but he comes from preaching and you listening and then remember the trash as the pure water proper God said the water of the word was poured in well there was no room for the trash the trash had to come out that's what we got into our spirit realm we've got to let that trash come out and run down and get old you know just keep you know what keep pouring the water in and I'll promise you the trash will come out there was no place for both oh that's why they now getting I'm sorry I get the preaching upstairs though these news in there come on but that's really what you at the new birth the trash is gone there's no trash coming back in your sealed that's why it says sealed until the day of your redemption your seal there's no trash going to get back in there you're done you're finished it's over right but that outside man is still got sticks and stones and all these things you know floating around in it spirit realm well if you don't steal that man man the trash can come right back in that's why when this thing gets sealed off you see what's the whole unit that means in your spirit realm don't worry about the body and your spirit realm gonna steal then Satan that's still about that's when we take the baggage in we're still working but that's the body chain because the body can't be changed one word off so one word off maybe one spit right down here in the corner they may be a little rock or a little stick laying right down here in some of our life but as you keep pouring the water in eventually that little sticks gonna float up and go out the window that's when we're gonna think like why it's going to be hard to do because we've still got a long stick so I wanna pause it now that make us doubt that make us die most of the law through breaking the law of dishonor yes now God switch what he's telling them he said you got preachers that are preaching and they're doing the same thing they're telling you not to do for the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you as it is written if we go right here for circumcision barely profiteth if thou keep the law listen the Jews right now that debt that let's just say this let's make it let's make it really bad Jesus is standing there now he will circumcise never circumcised the eighth day we know he was circumcised but all the Jews around him were circumcised now the Roman network that were running the court they were uncircumcised but all these Jews that was conscious and all him they were circumcised hey they can go back and say hey look yeah now and I'm doing what the law says Wow they were covered no they're the very ones that cookies on coffee why because their heart their heart their inner being was not so barely circumcised circumcision fairly profiteth if thou keep the law because they all became murderers when they said let his blood be on us and our children that all became murder but if thou be a breaker of the law by circumcision it's made uncircumcision now you can't put the skin back so now he's talking spiritual okay therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law shall not his uncircumcision be counted for seventy because they were some that come under the law that were Gentile remember they were Gentiles and they weren't circumcised now remember some of them went and became circumcised but remember when Paul brought that guy into the temple whoever was Timothy or somebody they must have looked I mean you had a show I guess before you in the temple if you were circumcised you or exercise tell me something they said oh you can file this whole temple you brought this uncircumcised Paul's like guys if y'all walk y'all have missed the point it's not that right therefore in the uncircumcision keep the rottenness of all showing on your thigh sermons you can be coming for certainty not physical okay spiritual and Shona learn circumcision which is by nature if it fulfils a law of judge thing to divide the letter and circumcision does transgress the law no where's the letter had circumcision now all that you can do your transmission the law don't remember the law I brought down as a schoolmaster to bring in the Christ not to save you long they were saved anybody so I said there's no new birth under the law there's no new birth under the Oh Testament because an uber takes you out from under the law but you in Christ because Christ is inside of you listen it's hard to see it's hard to see but Christ was more less thinking let's take Moses I guess you probably in the Old Testament he's probably one of the most powerful prophets that looks right would you say was anybody any more powerful the Moses that had put a veil on his face that presenting God more to the people than anybody else did right even even Christ had to top Moses because Moses said they'll raise up a prophet likened to me Moses did not have God in this office like you do John the Baptist though he received the Holy Ghost somehow somewhere someway he does not did did not have the Holy Ghost in deinstall like him because the least in the kingdom it came to miss the new birth it's greater than John John was the greatest of the prophets now that's the Bible said John was the greatest pray even Jesus then he said what the least in the kingdom was very quiet because John did not have what Jesus was talking about right that's why I'm telling you eternal life is different from the Newbery I see that it's totally different because you can't have the new birth and go before life room you can't have the new birth and not come up in the first resurrection you can't have the new birth and not go through the millennia see what I mean that new birth sends you all the way through that the only way Moses and some of those others are going to be anywhere close to related to us is because remember God was once married to Israel he was married to that group he divorced them now look you say well how can you do that and I see you got to go back American course we may talk about this afternoon a little bit because remember if if I kissed you come into adultery I can't divorce her she's dead she's dead to me now if I can turn them do it everything right you understand what I'm saying and I can marry you again and be perfectly safe it may be being a free truck I'm a virgin or a bit of a priest but same way with Christ he said how can he take Christ put Israel away didn't kill her put her away and divorcement because what she went whoring he caught her commitment okay that's why he can put these denominations on the way and stay married to us because he would technically have a living wife see I would technically have a living wife but in the eyes of God in the Bible if you're called sister's commitment don't do your husband to put you away marry another you're just you're dead to him as anything but now you can't do that you can't do that you came to our class when you don't like him the more right I go to but you see that more clearly we've said under marriage and divorce for 50 years but may I see it's no more clear about what the new birth done cook puts us in a whole different category pulled it kind of and we should feel honored that God did whether we die of a lot of the great what what hap doesn't matter that soul is preserved for eternity [Music] therefore the uncircumcision keep the rockin super long article start from that with no care for he is not a Jew which is one outwardly neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh I can show you I'm a Jew that don't mean one thing and you know what it really didn't mean anything to got him in the Old Testament it was a sign that you had done some like what got home today in other words that's a bit let me I just got this fresh you had nothing to do with it you had nothing to do it you ready it was your better they took you to be certified you didn't know how to do it for he is not a Jew which is one outwardly neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh but he isn't you never remember keeping your mind he's talking he's going sending this letter to the Romans and he's coming to bring a gospel to the Romans because some of them may be afraid man I had been certain times I'm 57 years old I sure won't go back be physically servants I think don't worry about that we're talking about the circumcision of the heart of the inward man don't worry about that's why I said the flesh has nothing to do it was just a sign any Old Testament because Christ wasn't there to take away off sure Christ was there is an anointing Christ wasn't there is a person to come inside of a but he is a Jew which is one inwardly okay and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not a man God so it's in the heart whose praise is not of men man we got past chapter 2 because he continues his thought and we'll read there's one more before we cook what advantage then that the Jew because everybody's looking to the Jews as user in the holy city the Jews of it devil wants it turned on them and what profit is there of circumcision much every way chiefly because that unto them that were committed the Oracles of God what is your move of God the Torah then you type the whole tech sergeant in Torah the Old Testament was committed to the Jews to live by that then they turned it down for what if some did not believe believe make the faith of God without faith know where this is why don't believe in 10 command so you didn't you so you can take them away that's the same way with God same way now with us and in our life we can't take away all this sir this is no sure the soul is born again but we still gotta live we do live by law listen we do this the law and liberty of Christ that's in the Bible we do live by that law but remember the do's and don'ts is not written
