TRANSCRIPT
========================================
to me everybody everybody good to be in the house of the Lord Bill the week yeah they everybody's doing somewhat social distancing but good to be here I need to make a little announcement and kind of clarify something I said sandy and also I want to read what brother Dale wants y'all to know so everybody this whole line the comment I made Sunday is the reason we want people here that's gonna be here for both services on Sunday I'm talking about inside the building not outside but I'm going to read you what brother Dale that's suggesting us to do and I agree with it 1,000% so I'll just tell you what I meant if you're not gonna be in both services then we're not going to have you here on Sunday because we have 12 people and then half of you leave and then there's six people sitting in here now I don't care if you that doesn't bother me if you don't want to listen to me that's your problem but brother Dale says we need to be Church like we're supposed to be a church one no this is going on and I'm gonna read you what he says this is suggestion not a demand everybody hear their suggestion not a demand to come on Sunday and sit in your car for the time being because I'm like brother Dale what would you be doing on Sunday anyway what are y'all doing now you you're not coming to church but you'll go to Walmart you'll go eat you'll go to your family's house well I think you need to be in church and if we can't be in the building you at least need to be outside this is from brother Dale Wade will also allow some to come and then we're gonna talk about that in a second inside as we go forward but like I said Sunday if you're not gonna be at both services inside inside don't come okay we don't want to get set on the wrong set of things and not be I mean his dutchess question what would we do if this had not happened what are you going to be doing you should be in church right you should be doing what you're supposed to be doing on Sunday I think maybe and I'm gonna just say this it this is the shaking time for the bride it's gonna tell you who the bride is and who's not we won't have to have built on teryn sighs you were right we won't have to build it on the church because they'll be probably some disappear from the church anyway that won't come back when everything comes back together because you get to set on I like what brother Joe Canada said a few minutes ago he treats Sunday when he's at home it's just like church for him that kids are not running around in the house they're not sitting around eating ice cream and watching the service they're raising their hands they're clapping their hands they're singing the songs and they're participating in the service that's what you should do because listen we are human beings and we are routine we have a routine you get out of that routine you got a problem so he wants to encourage all of us to put our thoughts and our hearts set on serving God at this time not worrying about the virus but we're going to participate as the best we can even when they start opening this up a little bit we're still going to watch what we're doing we're still gonna be diligent we've still need to wash our hands we still need to try to be the six feet apart if you're sick don't come if your kids are sick don't come okay don't come to church I mean they let you off for two weeks at work now if you just have a sniffle so it's killing us at the post office you know though them people like I feel like I got it and you get two weeks off you just become listen this is going to show who the real people are this is going to show who the real church goers are going to just go to church and then disappear so and I hate that but it's a trying time now we should serve God the best we can and and put forth an effort even though you're not in the building that's brother down said it's a suggestion not a demand come on Sunday and sit in your car for the time being and listen to the services because he wants you to participate as best you can and we don't want to get set on the wrong thing and I'm like him let me ask you one more time what would you be doing if this not happened this has now become an excuse for you can go and leave after first service or well some of you do anyway so it's just an excuse so it just grows bigger as week as we get toward the headstone that's gonna it's gonna make now not wins the brother Nelson now wins these is we know how it is with work and all those different things but Wednesday we are going to this is what I'm gonna do on Sundays we're gonna start allowing more to come but men we still want to hang with the men we've talked about we still want to keep the men coming if you're a but now don't come just one service if you're not gonna come inside for two services tell me you can't be here into stir for two services and you won't come on side because somebody wants to come to church and they're taking you're taking up their spot by just being like two days ago and going home so that comes from the pastor and the assistant also we just feel that we don't want the devil the devil's already got out the world all upset and scared and everything else we just need to be diligent we need to be observant and but we still need to worship God we still need to worship God like we always have and even more and as the day approaches we're supposed to be even I'll tell this on brother Tony Smallwood he's not here I called him today I said you want to come and of course he called me brought back he said I'll be there son he's like really gay there Sunday so you got some people that are eager to come so if you're not gonna come both services inside the building please let me know because if you don't show up second service like brother down said that linköping goes you won't be coming on Sunday anymore until this thing gets taken care of everybody got that right hey man so god bless you let's sing opening you do that you just no you go ahead open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart I want to say you I want to say you open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my heart I want to say I want to see you see you high and lifted up shining the light of the glory rapture power in love [Music] Oh [Music] holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see amen that's all of our desire in every night greet you out there in radioland sitting in your each of your little home home churches tonight oh we're this I know this is a this is an interesting setup but we're making the best of it let's go ahead and turn on over to Isaiah chapter 6 and and before we go into that let's just go to the Lord in prayer we think you look God to be able to gather together once again Lord Jesus around your word and maybe not all of us are in one place tonight or Jesus but we're gathering together around around the fresh-killed tonight just the same and I pray God a tonight Lord you let something be said to help your people Lord Jesus and to strengthen their faith and to encourage little God and and maybe to convict the heart of the people that that are not quite right yet Lord Jesus granite Lord God that you'll just be with us all Lord God as we as we worship in our different places and look into your word tonight we pray that you'll come and quicken that we welcome we welcome your presence now into our into that where our different places Lord wherever we are Lord Jesus we welcome you tonight and open up the doors of our heart Lord Jesus that you may be welcome Lord we ask these these blessings on the reading of your word and your name amen so tonight I want to speak on the topic of the influence of two kings and just look at Isaiah chapter six which is a familiar little scripture to us and maybe just take tonight to do just kind of a little Bible study and look into some things here so it says in Isaiah chapter six and the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high lifted up and his train filled the temple above us to the seraphim's each one had six wings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said I o is me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphim's unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said lo this has touched our lips and dine iniquity is taken away and I sin purged also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here am I send me you may be seated the Lord and his blessing to the reading of the work so tonight I I'm basically gonna be preaching reap reaching the messages influence so that brother Branham preached many many times you know I can't think of any greater compliment somebody to give me than to say that you're preaching exactly what brother Randall preached so and you know burr Brown you know he would give a big old nugget to us and I believe the fivefold ministry will take that and kind of break it down into easily digestible chunks so that people can kind of get what he's saying and maybe this was tonight we'll encourage you to go back and listen to that those messages again and maybe hope Lord willing and a renewed understanding and and and take the things that he said more personally and try to apply them to your life because really what what that message is that the sermons influence when he begins to lay it out he's really talking about there's two kings there that he's he's presenting it there in the sermon and the one the one King as an earthly King Uzziah and and if you look at 2nd chronicles just real quick we'll read through some of those scriptures that he talked about well you can you can brother Branham laid down the background of Uzziah how he was a shepherd boy and when he was sixteen year old years old is dead his dad died and he became King and he was put into a position of authority and he started off the race really good he began to seek the Lord and he saw God's guidance and and he the Lord prospered him and he began to really quickening him all these things that he built great engines of like siege engines on the walls and things that that normal people wouldn't conceive oh but God blessed him and caused him to have an understanding of how to do these things so let's just kind of read in the second chronicles chapter 26 verse 5 real quick and he says he saw God in the days of Zechariah who had understanding in the visions of God and as long as he saw the Lord God made him to prosper as long as he saw God God made him to prosper and then and then moving on down to verse 8 it says the ammonites gave gift is he gifts to use ayuh and his name spread abroad even to the entering end of Egypt for he strengthened himself exceedingly and in other words God was allowing him to just prosper and spread out and he was with him moreover as I built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate and at the Vala gate and at the turning of the wall and fortified them also he built towers in the desert and dig many wells free getting much cattle both in the low country and in the plains husbandmen also in vine dressers in the mountains and in Carmel for he loved husbandry and he had vines vines growing everywhere fruit but just plentiful all these things coming out of the of his the work of his hands because God had caused him to bless it to be blessed and it says in verse 15 and he made in Jerusalem engines these are the siege engines I was talking about invented by cunning men to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks to shoot arrows in great stones with him and his name spread far abroad for he was marvelously hilt till he was strong could you imagine the people in that day looking at all these siege engines that he had built to hurl arrows and I'm sure they weren't just a little teeny-weeny a big old big old errors that were shoot out from the wall like maybe with a tree trunk almost with something sharp on the end it just bust through a wall or whatever and the people in that day we're probably looking with amazement there how could this man come up with a design the architectural design that the the plans for something like this it was all because God was with him and but it it says in verse 16 but when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his distress for he transgressed against the Lord is God and went into the temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense you see use I as a cautionary tale to all of us because he began as long as he sought the glory God made him to prosper that then he began to look at his earthly accomplishments and he started to be lifted up in other words he was looking at all the things that he had done and let's apply to today's today's life he began to look in the mirror of Facebook and Instagram and all these things and begin to admire himself he began to look at what what the position he had may be today we've got many ministers today that but the God blesses them at their beginning of their ministry but then they begin to look at how God had prosper them and and then they fall by the wayside and they begin to get lifted up but you see because you SIA was influenced by the wrong thing and that's the point of the whole message of influence is before you can influence somebody else you need to make sure that you are influenced by the correct thing when you're influenced by the correct thing then you could influence others now Isaiah was watching all this he was watching the life of Uzziah and he was also influenced influenced by Uzziah so that's the whole point of this message also is that Isaiah being a prophet of God was yet caught in be it by being influenced by the wrong thing you see you can begin to get lifted up within your own self and say well well I'm a message believer I'm there we don't understand the mysteries of the Son of Man and all these things you can begin to get lifted up within yourself and then finally all of a sudden you've you've lost your humidity you lost your reverence you're no longer in action and you're falling by the wayside you see you've got to be influenced by the right thing so so Uzziah was an earthly king and and we don't want to have earthly influences because first John chapter 2 says love and not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father is not in it for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father but is of the world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever and now you say yeah well how are we how could we get distracted and and follow after like an earthly king well there there's many things there's many just ways for the devil to distract you to looking at the earthly influences instead of the influences of the of the heavenly king now that's the second King I want to talk about because there's a there's an earthly king and there's a heavenly king and it's so easy to be influenced by the earthly king because the devil whoa he's got a conduit right into your mind through the television and the movies and things that you watch and Facebook and you can get all called up and stuff that you read no WorldNetDaily or all this stuff that all it does is cause you consternation and trouble in your mind but if you can get piped into that influence of their heavenly king that you'll be in the right channel to have your your mind transformed to have your thinking transform to have peace and love and joy and all those things that come from that conduit of the perfect influence that heavenly influence and in Philippians 3:3 it says for we are the circumcision which worship God and the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh in other words we can't have confidence that anything that we see with our eyes we can't have confidence and any man that we fellowship with we can't have confidence in anything in this world the only thing that we can have confidence in is Jesus Christ so I would have saved tonight uh Oh God let me now have confidence in my job or in my boss or in the Social Security system or in any vein work of man's hand let my confidence meet not be and Donald Trump or Joseph Biden or anybody anybody that's in the political system my confidence is not in those things tonight my confidence is in Jesus Christ if you can get connected to that heavenly realm of influence then you'll not be influenced by the things of this earth you'll not be swayed like a reed tossed to and fro and wondering what you're doing here wondering what what where your security lies my confidence is in Jesus Christ and and that alone that's where my inch where my insurance policies light laid up that's where all of my I don't have a backup system he is my only system he's the only thing that I put all my ducks in one pot I put all my eggs in one basket everything is laid up in Jesus Christ listen my confidence is not being a good person or or just because I've got a Bible in my home or a cloud sticker on my car or I've got message books on my bookshelves my confidence is in Jesus Christ and in Jesus Christ alone you know so many times will will end up will end up doing like news I and start with Isaiah and we'll start looking at somebody else for our confidence we'll fight we'll try to find an excuse to be the way they are because of something else that we're looking at I'll say Isaiah I might have said well I you know Hughes is a good point and that's that's you know many times the young people will come to the older ones and say well I see any these people over here doing something that I don't understand why I can't do like they're doing or or they'll even come back and say well you did such is such a thing when you were younger but you see you can't look at other people for your example the only example that we have is the Word of God is Jesus Christ Jesus is the word so we're not looking to find an excuse or a loophole and look to see what somebody else has done or find a way to get away get to get around the Word of God but we're looking we're looking for the influence of the word don't look for earthly influences don't look for an excuse to act the way that you do don't look for an excuse to look to lay MC and I just continue to wall around in the muck and the mire of the word but look to get out of that mess to get out of the condition that you're in to escape the bondage of the devil that the trap of the devil believes God is the veil of your eyes let the veil be lifted so that you can see plainly like the vision that Isaiah set saw and we'll get to in a minute when Isaiah saw a vision that had made everything different it for him when I was they began to step into another realm and see the supernatural it it changed the atmosphere it changed it changed the situation the second Corinthians chapter 3 it says in such trust have we through Christ to God words not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God our sufficiency is in him not and of ourselves are not not even in our church not even in our ministers not even in one another but it is only in Jesus Christ and the message life brother Branham said her brother was testifying him to me this morning he said he was called to the ministry when the little boy and then he failed he said and he said but then he came back with more of a call to preach than ever before you see what it was when he become a Christian he got in the wrong environment that imagine that now not see you see Isaiah was a prophet of God but then he began to look at the wrong he began to look at something that was an incorrect influence a Christian sitting here tonight or maybe sitting at home wherever you are you can be a Christian aborning and Christian and begin to look at the wrong thing and begin to get sucked into the wrong influence and he said see in that environment influenced in you seeing you just keep holding around with that kind of environment that influence is you I hope you're reading between the lines what I'm saying see it influences you in that environment and the first thing you know you become a part of that environment you go into it and just like a good clean man that's clean and moral and he begins to associate with a bunch of people who's not see you take up the spirit of that you take up the spirit of people at you that's why even in the world they say you should be around people that won't that you want to be like look like that will lift you up in the business world of whatever you don't you know if you want to be a successful business person you don't get around a bunch of losers that all they do is sit at home playing video games and eating Cheetos you you get around people that that there are have the right will have the right kind of influence on you and the same thing in the gospel you want to be around their kind of people that have will have the right kind of influence you know how can I be an influence as a Christian that might be a good question to ask enough tonight and many times people will respond to that question without what I got to do something I got to run around and do all these things do you know the way to be the right kind of influence as the Christian is to just find your place and get in it and stay there do you know the moon is in its place and it has a great influence on the earth as it moves through through this through its cycles its pulling all these tons of water from one side of the earth to the other and all it's doing is staying in its place it doesn't have to run to and fro to do that all he has to do is just finish in this place and it's doing what God told it to do it's just right there in its place the same thing with the Sun and all the other planets there they're not hustling to and fro and trying to you know you know going backwards and forwards they're in their place and their God their predestinated to orbit that God has put them in and they don't have to get out of their orbit to fulfill the plan that God had given them all they have to do is stay in their place and tonight that's what all you have to do is to fulfill the Word of God has find your place and stay in it and you might think that well I I don't think my place is very big I wonder if maybe that's what something Steven thought when just you say just a little deacon hey never had a great worldwide ministry to thing but his life was an example that Paul saw and led him to Christ because he looked at the life of Steven a little deacon there in a church that had a greater testimony than many worldwide ministers that you see today a little man that just stayed in this place tonight you can I want to say this too as encouragement to all the ministers all the ones here what do you think that people you don't have an influence to others when you think that maybe you look and see people leaving and it looks like people don't want to hear anything you've got to say all you've got to do to be an influence is stay in your place and God will use you exactly the way you want you to eat to be used God wants us to find our places stay in it you know if you could imagine as a looking at the scene unfold is as he saw use I get out of his place a king wanting to be a priest and Isaiah might have reacted like many of us do when we see people getting out of their place could you imagine as he heard that you you mean he took the censer and he tried to offer and since on the gun what was he thinking well he went into the into the temple and and if you read the story all of the pre I was it was about fifty priests or so that they crossed their arms and said no you can't come into here and use I began to argue with them and fuss and and he and he took a match or whatever it was they used in life the golden censer and that's when leprosy struck him because leprosy represents sin all those ministers were there telling him you can't do this you're out of your place he was out you see why the ministers are shouting at people to get in their place because if you're in your place you can be at influence and when you're out of your place you become a stumbling block that's why brother Branham said without these virtues you become a stumbling block without if you see a Christian that's not in their place it just trips everybody up somebody that doesn't have tempers and patience not I'm not able to just deal patiently with people and not able to deal with Shepherds all it becomes is God really on the scene so Isaiah looked at that and he saw the situation where he's I wouldn't listen to the priests and they were physically preventing him from burning in zips and then leprosy came on the scene and and struck him because that leprosy is a type of sin and you know what sin is well let's back up a second and just take a look at sin seeing is unbelief the product of unbelief is all of the things that you do all of the the word lipstick in the makeup and the adultery and the fornication and this smoking pot and at all of us looking at pornography and all those things but all those things emanate from the deeper the root of the problem is unbelief unbelief is the problem and unbelief when he disbelieved when he pushed back at the ministers that the priests that were there telling him that when he was wrong leprosy struck upon his face because he wouldn't believe and the message influence program said now you say well what do you mean leprosy represents a tight brother of sin and when a man won't stand correction by the word of God he is full of leprosy blows up and carries on what does you what do you do you ruin your influence see something happens people knows and can tell the word that you're corrected by that you're not going to do it therefore you ruin your influence and it hurt this fellow anger got on him and will read on down when he was corrected then he refused to take his correction because his social standing had become more to him than the Word of God had become I'm sure you understand what I'm driving at see you become more to him his position as king become more to him than the Word of God now see us is so important to see all these little problems and things with with Uzziah as we get into the depth of this message that we're studying here because all of these problems his lack of reverence his lack of humility his lack of action or all things that brother Bartlett brings out when Isaiah saw this vision there in the temple then Isaiah got a picture of what real worship is and Isaiah chapter 6 verse 1 it says in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple you see the predicament that that Isaiah saw Uzziah in that he was struck with leprosy that he ran from the temple and was never allowed back into the temple with worship he had to live in a little safe house for the rest of his life a little house he was quarantined for the rest of his life and could not come back into fellowship with it with the believers and brother Brahim said that that put Isaiah to his knees and he began to call out to God what is going on he began to call out from to God for for the I believe something inside of him was crying out for the right kind of influence because he had had his eyes on this wrong kind of influence for so long that now he needed he needed a corrective action in his life and so God came on the scene and gave him a vision he opened up a vision to him you'll see his brother branham ladies this message now first he saw a vision then he made his confession then he was cleansed and then he was commissioned and you see that plan laid out in this message that is the same plan that you have to follow in your own life you cannot make a confession unless you see the vision and I don't mean a vision like like like brother Brennan saw although you know that it could be possible that people now in this day see a vision but that is not the type of vision that I'm seeing I'm talking about I'm talking about a vision where the veil of what unbelief is lifted from over your eyes and you see Jesus Christ as he hears the word unveiled plainly before you listen if you've tonight I have gone through a born-again experience you know exactly what I'm talking about when the veil is lifted you know what I mean when the veil is lifted from your eyes because you've been there and if you and you've experienced it if you don't know what it is to have the layer lifted from your eyes then there's a good there's an altar tonight where you can come and confess your sins and have that veil lifted from over your eyes whether you're here in this church or home and your own home or the with their own little altar beside your bed tonight your that does the way is made plain the way is clear for you to come and confess your sins that God can lift that veil and and and make plain show you the vision of himself the kind the kind of vision that Isaiah saw that changed his life where he he began to understand what real worship was he began to see what a real communion with God was when he saw the seraphim's and he saw this things unfolded before his eyes then he knew what a real godly influence was what it was to have a real influence unfold before his eyes listen if you want to be a real influence to others you've got to have that kind of influence backing you up that kind of influence that back up the life of Isaiah brother brems said in the handwriting on the wall he said because you know you know what influences tonight you know what the influence is today the influence of the hour is the Gospel message the gospel being preached received in the heart of the believer is the influence the message the influence that I'm talking about is they weren't they manifested word of your day the word that we've heard is just not some something that somebody's concocted or come up with but it has come right from that place that Isaiah looked at this role of God has come right down from the cherubims and the seraphim's past the angels down into the lips of a little prophet their priests preach the word and you're sitting at home listening in to a tape or whatever and you're saying lord I believe and are you catching that same vision that Isaiah saw the Gospel message is the influence the gospel is the greatest influence on your life because it is the spoken word the Word of God come into the heart of the believer to influence you to transform your mind to change the heart of the believer that's why brother Branham could say in the handwriting on the wall we said as I look down here and see and women bow at the altar under the influence of the gospel oh so happy Lord that we have something that puts us under an influence it isn't a strong drink it's a wine of pinnacles it influences us to do right it takes all the wrong the way and makes it right we're so happy for this Lord these men have tasted of God these women have tasted of God tonight maybe for the first time in their life something has spoke of their hearts and said child of mine now listen listen to the way he puts this he said I was the one who kept you from having that accident he's making it personal he's saying I was the one that kept you from having that car accident or whatever I'm the one that preserved your life I'm the one that kept you for this special moment that I could come down and influence you and speak directly to your heart and come and show you something from behind the veil something that naturalised can I see I was the one who spared you when you would die now won't you come and return and give your life to me and let me guide you and take you home and I love you and I want to be good to you listen that's the kind of influence that I've that's the kind of influence in the gospel brings where it opens up your eyes to the presence of a living God that God is there and he's dealing with you he's he's wooing off your spirit he's speaking to you so there's a deep that's calling to the deep and there's got to be emptied to respond listen there is there is more than an earthly influence if you can just let your soul will look beyond the things of this natural world and peer into that hidden realm there is an influence of a heavenly keyless John you deny so tonight I want to look I want to take some time to look at the influence of dissipation that Isaiah had now now remember the plan here and this message that we're looking at that were examining tonight the plan is that Isiah first saw a vision then the vision caused the reaction the next reaction that the vision called was it caused it to realize the particular but that he was in and he cried out Halley he began to look inward no longer was he looking at you sigh and saying well it's all his fault looking at all the people outside say well it's I'm in this shade because of those people it's it's my pastors fault of the Deacons father the ministers fault that no but he began to cry woe is me woe is me I'm the problem he said in verse 5 I said then I said I was me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts listen listen when all through the Bible when these men of God caught that kind of a vision their reaction was always the same daniel said my calmness has turned the corruption job said I am vile I abhor myself Paul said who our Lord and what can I do when you catch the vision you realize that yeah it causes you just realize the sorry sting of the vilest of your predicament that there's none good in you there's none good and you know not one and we all have fallen short and we need a savior we and listen that kind of a vision will cause you to fall your knees and begin to beg God for you begin to confess your sins listen it drove our Zeya to true worship he began to have an understanding of what true worship was he'd been looking at the wrong thing he thought he could see but all this time his lips were unclean and he didn't realize it he had been miss placing his reverence he had been giving reverence to man instead of the God he had been influenced by corruptible and changing flesh and he realized that he did not understand the true humility true humility is not you must bow to my will but you must bow to gods but you know what truth Milly is true whom Italy is not being a pushover true humility is not just it's somebody that want me it won't stand for the truth true humility is when you can look into the Word of God and see what God requires and say I believe it I believe it and I will do it whatever you require Lord if you require me to get on my knees and confess all my sins if you require me to go to my brother and confess all my wrongs to him if you require me to go to church every day for the rest of my life every time that the church doors are open I'll do it if you require me to pay my tithe if you require me to just bow myself in humility if you require me to do like these angels that cover their face with you with their wings and humility whatever you want me to do I will do it that is humility that is godly community community humility whatever your word requires I will do it not whatever I require but whatever you require it psalm chapter 32 verse father says I acknowledge my sin under thee and mine iniquity have I not healed I said I will confess my transgressions under the Lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sin do you see do you see when when Isaiah confessed his sin the angel I said the angel flew to the altar they are angel did not daughter Seraphim do not doll around and say well let's see if it's really genuine when you confess your sin God is quick to come on the scene and forgive you it doesn't take you beating your back you you're back with some kind of whip or something that doesn't take you pushing a penny down the street with your nose all you have to do is confess your sin and say Lord I was wrong and that should be the same reaction when a brother or sister confesses their false to you you quickly forgive them because all of your sins have been forgiven by I just and the holy God who didn't have to forgive your seat but he wiped the slate clean the James 5:15 it says in the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him do you realize what a great promise we have access to I've known still something Zack was saying on the way over here see he was Zack was he got to testify and he said you know the whole Bible is a promise of God and all I have to do is believe it do you know do you know that's when you can look into the Word of God and see eyes yes all it is is God's love led to me and part of his love letter is that he's promised to forgive you of your sins he's promised it and all you have to do is believe it confess your sins and he's quick to come on the scene because first John chapter 1 verse 9 says if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness now you talk about a privilege to be able to lay everything that you've done no matter what it is no matter what your past looks like to be able to lay it at the feet of the cross and say yeah I did it and I'm sorry God forgive me forgive me of all I've done and you're gonna look up at the cross and see that blood dipping down and know that it was for you that he died for you and that blood of stripe City bar was for your iniquities and for your healing and for all all the wrong that you've never done so that he can wipe it away if you'll confess it but listen I believe in you confess it I don't believe in the way that a lot of people do is that a they get caught up and all their sins and everything and they want to come find a minister to do the praying for oh well you will you pray will you pray for me no you did the sin and you do the praying you're the one that did the sin and you do the pray you're the one that needs a relationship with God the minister Lord willing already has a relationship with God you're the one that needs the relationship with God so you don't need to go find somebody that you can blame it on again you don't need to find somebody to do the the relationship part of it for you you're the one that needs to do the brain brother brain was said in the Church of the Living God he said now you might come and confess your sins to me and ask me to pray for you but I cannot forgive you if you sinned against me I can forgive you but if you sinned against God he is the only one that can forgive you and he has forgiven every person in the world that ever will will be in the world they're already forgiven but it will never help them until they accept it by faith and then confess it so first you see the vision you've got to catch the vision and the vision comes the influence of that vision comes by the preaching of the gospel so if you're not in church how are you going to catch the vision or if you're not listening to church your heart even if you're not in church right now your heart should be so burning to be on Church I'm not bragging on my family tonight but Luke Haley will Kaylie was telling us I want to get back to church so bad because she misses being with the people of God something within you should have a desire to be a church and if you have an opportunity to be in church and you turn it down what's wrong with you what do you realize what what kind of an opportunity you're turning down you know there's there's quotes I believe I believe I can find I don't know where it is right now but brother Aaron said that you if you have an opportunity and sure that you hear the message and you turn it down you turn your back somebody else will fill your seat you don't want somebody else to fill your seat and glory if you've got a seat and if you've got a seat in the church you take it while you can because God wants you to be forgiven he wants you to catch the vision and that is that provided way is by the gospel so you catch the vision then you confess and then he cleans you the Bible says in verse 6 it says then flew one of the seraphim's under me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said lo this earth touched our lips and that iniquity is taken away and I sin purged listen brother Brahim said in the message testimony he said just I tell you this old-time religion brother it straightens you up see that's another effect of the gospel the gospel will bring you to conviction it will bring you to confession and it will clean you up why because it's the washing of the water of the word as you listen to the word it's cleaning you up and you're not and listen if you don't listen to movies and you go listen the worldnetdaily and you go listen to all this all the thing you go fill up your soul with all that kind of stuff that's not cleaning you up but if you fill up your soul with the gospel and I'll clean you up and transform you right up it'll make you into a new creation brother brother said it'll make a silk dress and a calico put their arms around one another and call a sister is that right it'll make a tuxedo suit and a pair of overalls call each other brother that's what it'll do brother it'll clean you up it'll make no difference in you listen that's why I believe that what will bring us into one Accord it's not it's just trying to fake it and just trying to fake a love with one another but the gospel will tear down the wall of separation between brothers if you one brother has a lot of money and the other brother doesn't or one brother comes from this background or that but whatever and the gospel is bringing us into one Accord the gospel is what is holding us down in the end time and and bringing us to a place where we know where we stand I'm trying to that Clark's moving on around I've got so many notes my goodness I can never get to all these in the time allotted but so let's just kind of let's kind of move through look God cleans you up as brother way he's been nailing down justification of sanctification the baptism oligos do you realize why those were important those are not just stages to go through I'm going through justification now I'm in sanctification God's taking you through a process because he's got something good for you and you rely we'll get a little bit deep here but there's there's three different stages of that cycle and and when you might be going on through the statute perfect man but God is sanctifying you and your spirit he's cleansing you because he's got something good for you that's what sanctification is he's cleaning you around because he's got something that he wants to put inside of you he's got something he wants to fill you up with and that's why it cleans you out because he wants to Commission you he wants to feel he was something he wants to give you something where you can be tired you can have an absolute that's anchored and filled with his goodness and knowledge of who he is and agreeing with the word and not shaken by every wind of doctrine and influenced by that heavenly King so in verse 8 it says also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I see and then who go who will go for us but then said I here am I send me because God the reason for God cleaning you up is because he wants to send you he wants to send you out you know do you know what a commission is and Ana military a commissioned officer is somebody who's been given an order they begin authorized to produce a certain effect in the military they've give they've given their beginning their papers they begin their instructions while you're in the military and they see these are the things that I want you to do and they they've got their order they've got their Commission now now God Commission's us by filling us with the Holy Ghost in with power and now in the Old Testament Isaiah could not get that new birth because Jesus had not died so the life could not come back into him but yet he was commissioned after he was cleansed to go and preach the gospel in other words the angel told the Seraphim told him I got something for you to go talk about and and you know a minister of the gospel you say well how am I called to preach a minister of the gospel is called to preach by God giving him something to say you know you're called because you've got something to say it's not just because you feel something or you want to have lordship both other people are you you have a strong desire to put people in their place and slap people upside the head but God calls you by giving you something to say and he'll not just ministers though but he calls every born-again believer by coming and putting self inside of that person and going in them to accomplish the work that he has in their life that's why if you want to be an influencer you've got to have an influencer in you to know what your place is in the gospel and when you find your place in the gospel when you find your place and you can stay in that place and stand rooted like the moon or the Sun and the stars then you can be the right kind of influence to others because you've got the influence you're living on the inside of you that's why in John chapter 20 verse 21 said then said Jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so send I you why how did he send them by going in them and what what have you been commissioned to do like an officer in the army you've been you've not been commissioned us to sit around and you not been commissioned to sit at home and there any Cheetos and and fill your failures your spiritual sous with all of this Hollywood and trash and all of this kind of stuff but you've been commissioned to cast out Devils you make Commission to fulfill the Lord to be the manifestation of the word and your day you've been commissioned do you know the church has been commissioned the ministry has been commissioned to build the church that's ephesians 4 11 and 12 to build up the church until using the full the full stature of a perfect man and do you know you make commission to be the light of the world you make commission to you or the thing that the light that people at work will see when when they don't know anything about the gospel you have been commissioned to be a blessing to others that's why a lot of times we'll get prayer requests that we pray for here in our church for people who are not message believers and may not even be christians because you have been commissioned to be a blessing to all the world and that's why you know there's been this great discussion should i should i pray for people out there in the world they've got coronavirus and things should i pray or should i be like like the sons of zebedee and it should we love to pray that fire will be called down from God out of heaven on these people that the destruction of the flesh may reign on them listen while we're here on the earth we are predestinated to be a blessing you are predestinated to be a blessing you are a blessing to this earth and even you know even if the earth even if they're sinners on the earth you still the blood covering still abides on the earth as long as the bride is present when the bride leaves it leaves the earth then all hell will break loose then everything will break loose upon the earth but while you're here on the earth you are a blessing I want to be a blessing to pee I want to be a blessing to people listen I my boss says a Muslim man but we get along fine he is he's testified on my behalf he's done great things for me we have a wonderful a working relationship because I want to be a blessing to other people I don't want to be a curse you say well this person I remember growing up you'd hear about people in the message to be like well I don't even want to talk to that person on the other side of the road because they don't believe the way as I do can you imagine that kind of an attitude you're looking at other people and say well they don't believe like me I don't want to fellowship with them listen we're not we're not here to be a curse we're here to be a blessing to be a light to the world and how can you be a light to the world except that light being you that influence not an earthly influence but a heavenly influence the influence of a heavenly King look at this picture of influence times running away and I was I guess after six persons verse two was said above it stood this era from this vision that Isaiah saw above it stood the Seraphim each one has six wings with Twain and covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he fly he didn't fly and you see this picture of influence that Isaiah was looking at as a striking opposition to the influence that Uzziah demonstrated because these these six wings over their face over their feet and flying with were the exact opposite of what used I had demonstrated Uzziah did not have humility and the time when he needed humility he did not have a reverence in the time that he needed reverence and he did not put his faith in the action which is what these six wings represent do you know what what real rare let's start with the over the face reverence the wings over that real reverence comes by recognizing the presence of God and I'm talking about the presence of God in this building tonight the presence of God in your homes tonight as you listen in listen you don't have to be in this church building tonight but God is present right where you are tonight whatever you have need of he's there ready to meet your need and he's present in your pastor he's present and by the way if you can recognize the presence of God and the people that you're dealing with and the church that you're a symbol in in your home tonight then it will bring reverence yeah I remember people hearing people talking about how when they would come into brother Brandon's meetings and it would look all smoky and everything and that everybody would be quiet because even before the search had the church service had started people knew that there was a that like I heard he described that they knew that there were angels lining the building and so it caused a condition of reverence and the people because they recognized the presence of God they knew that God was there and something was happening when that little man stepped out from behind the pulpit and he began to speak to them they knew that that was not just a little man speaking but that was God speaking to them do you know when you come in the church as somebody was telling me that in Africa they pull so hard because they believe that that man behind the pulpit that is God speaking to them and they have a reverence for that man up there that he's delivering the Word of God to them because they have such confidence that that is God speaking of it if you come into the house of God with a reverence like that God can begin to deal with you the kind of reverence that calls Moses to take his shoes off because he knew that God was there the kind of reverence that caused Paul to drop to the ground because he knew that that was God reverence comes by recognizing the present so they almighty live in God but him said in the message influenced one of the messages that he preached in 90s this was in 1963 he said no reverence the people tried to do write me and take a stand for the Word of God and say I'm gonna have my congregation cleaned up the first thing you know what complaint comes in from somebody else and they asked him he has to get out on the street why they're not convinced of his presence in other words they're not convinced that that is God moving on the scene they're not convinced that that's God and that man you ought to do like David said put the Lord always before my face I shall not be moved let the Lord be before me I'll have him on my right hand now he'll be before my face wherever I see I want to see Jesus in it I'll go to a place I'll do nothing my influence just to let it be for him recognizing his presence brings reverence another story maybe we could relate his blind bartimaeus sitting on the side of the road blind his eyes were covered over he couldn't see but then when they identified Christ of all ages came walking down the street and they said he began to call out he said the Bible says when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry out and say Jesus thou son of David have mercy on him mercy on me why because he recognized that Jesus was there in front of him he recognized his presence and the Bible says above it's to the seraphim's each one verse two each one has six wings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly humility who middlee over the feet humility their obedience to god's word consciousness to your littleness do you realize you can't obey God's Word in the proper way until you are conscious of your littleness that there's no good in you because otherwise you'll come of your approach God's words like kaindi it all puffed up within yourself and say and my way or the highway and all this kind of things but I'm sending that in the message of influence preached in 1964 he said here is a good example always be conscious of your littleness not your bigness brother branham said he began to talk about the woman at the wheel on the message influence in 1963 he said he was talking about how she became conscious of her littleness and she approached Jesus with humility and reverence and then she went into action he said but he had truth vindicated god-given truth what happened her wings quickly went over her face the wings went over her feet she said sir not Beelzebub sir the best I know you must be a prophet now I know we haven't had a prophet for hundreds of years but the scripture says that when the Messiah comes and and she began to relate to him all that she knew about what the Messiah would be and then he began to open up her eyes and she said then she went into action come see a man you see putting things into action is where a lot of times we fall short but bramma a lot of times he would he would describe putting your faith into action as like shifting into gear shifted into gear and you can be sitting in the church tonight or at home wherever you are and and hearing the words that I speak in and it's not in gear but brother I'm said to put it in gear all you have to do is say I believe that you know that is nothing but the truth I believe that and what that does is it it's just putting all of your faith just just taking God at His Word and putting it all back in God's lap to fulfill I'm jumping ahead of myself I've got some quotes about that listen you think about all these people in the Bible that we look to as examples that that put their faith in gear like the woman at the whale or Peter when Jesus told him that Peter said I had I've been fishing all day and I hadn't called anything and Jesus said we're just just cast your net over on the other side it's such a simple little thing such a simple little thing that almost compares with a lot of times what a minister will be preaching on the pulpit and we might do like Peter thought maybe in his mind well why would I do that why would I cast my head over on that other side it doesn't make sense it doesn't compare with all of my schooling it doesn't compare I went to college and it doesn't compare but Peter just put he just shifted into that gear and cast over on the other side and just obeyed the word of the Lord what about this interior and they said I'm not worthy I'm not worthy for you to come in my house he said listen I've got people over me and I've got people under me so I know what it is to be a into a Thor to have to be an authority or or even to be under Authority when my boss tells me something to do I go do it and when I tell an underling under me to go do what I do it so I know that you are in authority and if you tell that devil to get out you don't have to be in my house you can sit right here where you are and what he wasn't what was he doing he was shifting his faith into gear now stay with me now don't don't fall asleep and you at home - we're in church we're or whether you wear whether you're at home or whether you're whether you're here don't leave back in your recliner don't flip that thing up and get too comfortable we're in a church listen Moses flipped his faith in the gear when he God told him something that seemed impossible and he went down into Egypt and you know what flipping it flipping it into gear looks like a lot of times we'll think that we've got something to prove but we don't have anything to prove it's not the bride that does the proving it's the bridegroom listen when some if some man were to come on the scene and start picking at my wife or something it would be me to step up my wife is not gonna defend herself I'll step out and say get a get away from here with her I'm the one that has to defend my home I'm the one that has a gun that if somebody were to come into my house I would defend my home because I'm the man and God is the one that will defend his word listen all the times we think we've got something to prove whether or not to put on the mask when we go to shopping her to take a mask oh I don't want to wear a mask come on prove what kind of or i'ma put on a mask because I prove something we like to prove anything Oh have to do is all you have to do is take God at His Word and he'll come on the seat and prove it listen spiritually speaking now the bride the woman does not have to provide she does not have to preach this one time and a lot of the sisters got upset with me for preaching this I no joke that were telling my wife that I did not value her and things like they haven't let you do you miss my point my point is now that I'm trying to devalue sisters my point is to show your place in the gospel that you you don't have to provide you don't have to fulfill the word it's God doing it in you God is the one that will bring his word to pass all you have to do that is the only obligation that you have is to believe his word and he will come on the scene and prove it listen there were situations where the word would got challenged where that uh the the brother branham's pastor you know when he was in the Baptist Church he he went up and they challenged who will come up and drink this this poison whatever it was strychnine or or whatever they had on the up there on the pulpit he said they got that challenge is there anybody that will take God at His Word and he said I'll accept the challenge he went up and drank it straight poison and God come on the scene and backed him up listen but we don't go around taking up snakes and drinking poison on a daily basis just to prove something we don't have anything to prove I have nothing to prove you know it was it was the devil that would go do what challenge that challenge Jesus he said prove prove who you are once you cast yourself down off of this step once you turn this bread into these stones into bread prove it prove it they told brother branham won't you cut this girl's arm and prove oh you are by by healing her proven that is the devil talking we don't have anything to prove I don't have anything to prove listen wait if we're sick if you if you get well that's God coming on the scene but if God allows things to take a little bit longer that doesn't mean that God has left you he might just be proving you listen if you're sick deny that doesn't mean that doesn't mean that God's not with you anymore that doesn't mean that you don't have the Holy Ghost that's just a bunch of nonsense could you imagine if you've got a cold too my same one I don't know if this person has the Holy Ghost listen if you got the coronavirus tonight that doesn't mean you got don't have the Holy Ghost but I believe if you've got the coronavirus we've got a healer we got a healer that can come on the scene and heal it he'll come on the scene and prove his word I believe it we don't have nothing to prove but he will prove his word us that's what I told Zack when he was seeking the Holy Ghost I said he is obligated to prove his word he is obligated to bring his word to pass all you have to do is believe it could you imagine somebody saying well well you've got to give yourself the Holy Ghost you can't give yourself the Holy Ghost that would how could you give yourself the Holy Ghost how could you heal yourself you can't do those things it's God that proves that I I don't know why I cut all into that but anyway I hope I laid that down I hope I nail that so far in the ground that it'll never come up again let's burn that down in the ground but mom said stay an abstraction in the message the influence of another he said if you believe God heals stay in action and he said if you believe he's going to call you out now and you're holding on to him stay in action stay in action you got two wings so using stay in action wave them back and forth Lord I believe Lord I believe you can't just holler holy holy holy you have to say Lord I believe stay in action now how do you stay in action you ain't staying in action if you're just gobbling up all this Hollywood tommyrot or all of this all this filth of the world that they put it listen everybody's so scared every which way they turn now that nobody knows what to believe because these people over here say one thing about this situation and I'm talking about the coronavirus and there who's going to be president and all this kind of stuff listen stay in action by filling yourself up with the world [Laughter] listen brother I'm said faith ignores circumstances it don't look at the symptoms that don't look at the things of this world it knows what people say I could care less what the news says I want to see what the news of God says I want to see what his Bible says about the day in the hour that we're living in if you look into the Bible and open and you begin to get understanding of what the seven trumpets open up and how things were gonna get worse and worse and there would be plagues fall on the earth then you reading the right kind of newspaper now then you're in there you got the right kind of influence but when you're gobbling up all this time around that you don't even know whether it's true or not what kind of influence is that the real faith ignores what people say cause it's in action it's not a shame that doesn't have a hindrance it knows where it's sick stands it's burly and Brawley and it sees only victory what why can it only see victory because it's tied to the victorious one that already paid the price for you at Calvary he's already made you victorious and you don't have to prove it he's already proven it you're trying to skip through IIIi didn't mean to keep you long tonight I'm but I do have some things to say listen tonight brother branham said in the hour has come he said when you accept him as your healer don't never act like you're sick or crippled anymore I believe that you're healed take him at his word there now here's here's the quote that I read this in their Sunday School class then it's all over own garden and not on you see as long as you take God at His Word then the word will produce what it promised to do is that right now have faith believe him with all your heart in other words you don't have to produce predation from disease he's the one that does it you don't have to produce healing for your body he's the one that it's all on God and faith puts it all on God do you know he wants you to do that well we were on tell you what Zacks but it started being a I'm not preaching on how good my family is and I don't get that but he's he's when somebody gets influenced by their Heavenly King then you want to be around him because they start influencing you and he'd been testifying lately about how that uh all these things that are happening to him well now I lost my train of thought I forgot what I was gonna say anyway let's keep going on you know you don't have to produce the new birth yeah I know I'm getting older whatever you know I have to produce salvation for your children he's the one that produces that if you just if you just laid claim to that and that's what I was going to talk about probably brought up a through my memory he was talking about how if you look into the promises of God's Word and just lay it in front of it then it puts it back on him it puts it back on him aren't you that's what what kind of goodies your plan is there I mean any kind of porous car salesman in the world the poorest salesman should be able to sell the gospel because you hardly have to do any work it sells itself you don't have to produce a duration in your life a job you don't have to produce a guide us and guide us on what you should do all you have to do is grab a hold to the Word of God and just just receive that and let it begin to produce brother Anna said in Mary's belief he said it's not me to try to figure it out let's take the word of the Holy Spirit he's the one who made the promise he's the one who confirms that promise he's obligated to keep that promise these are all good quotes to hang on to you know when you when you get in a down spot or you get into some troubles times or whatever I've been in some troubles times myself you know what sickness heartache lose your job all these things that's when you take these scriptures and you lay them before God and say Lord I need you to come on the scene now put your faith in gear and accept him at his word put your faith in gear and say I know you are the one that made the promise now come on the scene and that's why listen to get that right kind of influence what I've been getting at all night is you got a feed that so you got a nurture that soul nurture that thing that will influence you in the right direction get your influence from the heavenly king now Isaiah had his eyes on your Ziya but when he caught the vision that regard or really wanted to see that it changed everything he saw he caught the vision and it caused it brought into a state of confession then God cleaned him up and he commissioned him and the Holy Ghost is putting the church into action now the musicians can go ahead and come home cuz I'm gonna I'm on close on this The effect of the brother I'm closed that that message influenced by talking about the effect that that that vision had on his eye he said look at that what that effect was and he closed my you talk about an amazing amazing end of that service if you go listen to that tape I had a prayer line people coming up for prayer and all kinds they did when I was listening to I think it was 1964 but calls there were people in that congregation catching the vision they were catching God wanted to do something in their life they didn't he doesn't want you to just be have you go through life with your high on on earthly things and you know in this story use I kind of types earthly things but he wants you to have your vision your eyes on him because he's got something for you to do and what is that what is that purpose for you to do is to be a light to the world to be a blessing to be the manifested Word of God for your any to a man let's stand to our feet and let's just let's just praise Him and worship him a little bit yeah worship and point at home too now don't just stay on your couches and everything but stand up and praise Him and clap along I know my kids are playing their instruments at home right now Monica gets them up and playing their violin and everything right along with the musicians because we're having church [Music] Jesus is coming soon warning or die [Music] from the suicide [Music] goodbye [Music] this is God's world he is told he was about when these signs come to pass there it will come very fast trumpets will sound Jesus coming soon morning [Music] stop [Music] soon rising up man straw [Music] Jesus come [Music] Oh amen the dead will rise I feel like we're just about on that time it's got to be close didn't my gonna you see the signs of the times just things happening in the natural but what about in the spiritual you know I think you know it's not for us to look far off into the future for the coming of the Lord anymore I believe the Son of Man is on the coming of the Lord is the revealing of his word the word is revealed I believe I believe we're catching the vision I believe we've caught the me I sing you know did you have something to say 87 feel my way with love let me walk blessed Lord in the way leading straight [Music] to the side [Music] with let me so [Music] TV clothes to the side my Savior God let me free from wrath hey Marshall satisfied every day [Music] as I want [Music] stop try [Music] a man aren't you glad to be a Christian and I you know if you're a Christian you don't have anything to worry about and say well what what if I die I think was Charles Spurgeon says southern death is sudden glory so we don't have anything to worry about everything's in God's hand if you you know you know even in that story of job where God let all those things happened to him the devil couldn't do one thing to job until he part of that head back and said let you know you can you can do these things and even then he wouldn't let him take his life the devil has no power God is totally in control that that's that should be a comfort to us all you know if we're if we're Sheep of his flock of his pasture and he is our great Shepherd not one thing can come in to harm us that he doesn't like well let's just go the Lord and then one didn't be dismissed well God we thank you so much for your grace to us in this our door god we know that you're always on the scene you're still on the scene because you promised that you would never leave us or forsake us that you'd be with us even even though that we walk through the valley of the shadow of death we would fear no evil because we know that you're with us Lord Jesus we thank you for all these promises that we can see in the Bible and take advantage of all these benefits that you've given unto us Lord Lord I pray Lord that everyone under the sound of my voice tonight would be able to look into the benefits package Lord God that you've outlined for us and and put their faith in gear tonight Lord Jesus as they walk in your word through the coming weeks Lord Jesus put their faith in action and apply all these promises and say Lord I believe it I believe what he was talking about tonight I believe what the prophets said I believe that I have access to these promises I believe that I have access to these benefits and Lord let all the doubt and all the fear just be put out from our dwelling places put out from our sanctuaries put out from our bodies little car that will have complete confidence in you grant it Lord God I believe that's why you gave us your word Lord Jesus that we would have joy and peace Lord and we would have all these things that you promised this Lord granted Lord God that you'll deliver us Lord from being called the things of this world and call up in the trials and all this stuff that is going on today and Nord it will just put our head deep into the Holy of Holies Lord Jesus where we won't be called up with all the things that are going on Lord Jesus granite Lord that will be shut away like the children of Israel down in Egypt fishing on the lam while people were dying outside Lord of God but with a token apply Lord Jesus and we've got the token apply the night Lord God we've got it applied and because of that we have nothing to fear Lord God because you're on the scene you're with us Granite Lord God that you'll go with your Saints and I'd go with your people Lord Jesus and ever home and ever dwell in Lord God that you'll come and be on the scene we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
