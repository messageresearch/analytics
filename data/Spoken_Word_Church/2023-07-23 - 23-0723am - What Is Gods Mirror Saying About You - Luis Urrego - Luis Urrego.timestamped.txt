[0:29] inside me Holy Spirit

[0:37] [Music]
[0:41] can you truly say that in your heart
[0:43] amen
[0:44] Lord Jesus Holy Spirit you are truly a
[0:47] comfort to me when you're not around
[0:49] when you're not near me I I feel it
[0:52] but when you're near me I feel it too
[0:55] amen do you desire God Amen in that way
[0:58] that that you know and you miss it when
[1:01] you're not in his presence
[1:03] amen that's that's how we want to we
[1:05] want to feel God and that's how we want
[1:07] to be around serving him amen praise the
[1:10] Lord Jesus it's good to be in the house
[1:11] of the Lord this morning it's good to
[1:13] see each and every one of your smiling
[1:14] faces and uh appreciate you all making
[1:18] it out this morning amen I I want to
[1:20] thank beforehand uh
[1:22] those that that
[1:25] um
[1:26] pitched pitched in and helped you know
[1:29] during the time when we were out
[1:32] but Mike we appreciate you filling in
[1:34] brother brother John we appreciate you
[1:36] all filling in and we just thank you
[1:38] thank each and every one of you for
[1:40] helping out amen
[1:42] we had uh for those who didn't know that
[1:44] we were in Canada a few weeks ago and we
[1:46] had a good trip and uh then it would
[1:50] didn't go to expect to minister over
[1:52] there I I'd preached at the church over
[1:54] there before but but brother John Danko
[1:57] over there he told me he said uh you
[1:59] know well when you come over here you're
[2:00] always going to preach so
[2:02] so I said well I didn't come to preach
[2:04] but we had a good time in the Lord and
[2:07] we just appreciate it was just really
[2:08] really refreshing and then and so we
[2:10] just thank God thank you for your
[2:12] prayers and also thank you all for
[2:14] everything that you did and making your
[2:16] way out to Tennessee as well like
[2:17] brother Joe said we'd been knowing the
[2:20] people over there for a good while some
[2:22] of you here
[2:23] longer than even us and uh it was just
[2:27] good this to be with them and good to
[2:29] fellowship with them and I think our
[2:31] presence there refreshed them amen keep
[2:35] moving on amen that's what it's all
[2:37] about this thing's about over amen and
[2:40] so it's not it's not time to put walls
[2:43] that was back then all right but it's
[2:46] not time to put walls anymore and don't
[2:48] even use the word of God to put walls
[2:50] either
[2:51] man there's no excuse anymore amen it's
[2:55] time to just amen just Embrace each
[2:58] other because what was what was Jesus
[3:00] last prayer for us in John 17 that we
[3:03] love one another
[3:04] all right he didn't say put walls if
[3:07] they don't agree with you no he said we
[3:09] love one another
[3:11] man and he didn't give conditions he
[3:14] said you love one another and as the
[3:16] time Drawing Near amen and things are
[3:19] getting Tighter and Tighter you squeeze
[3:21] them you know closer to each other like
[3:24] the cows in in the cattle out in the
[3:26] field when when an earthquake is about
[3:28] to happen What do they do they squeeze
[3:30] closer together under under a tree
[3:32] that's what we should be doing in this
[3:34] hard day yeah but what Satan wants to do
[3:37] is he wants to use the excuse of the
[3:40] word of God this brother doesn't see it
[3:41] the way you see it or this but oh I'm
[3:44] just gonna separate them
[3:46] the word is the separator for sure and
[3:48] we separate straightly from from sin
[3:51] amen and deliberate things but if a
[3:53] brother's trying to get to the same
[3:54] Heaven that you are
[3:56] let's see how I can help my brother and
[3:58] let's see how he can help me and we move
[4:01] on closer to God Amen I wholeheartedly
[4:03] believe that with all my heart amen I
[4:05] think that's what works and I think
[4:06] that's what's going to help us move
[4:07] forward amen praise the Lord Jesus
[4:10] well this morning we just uh want to go
[4:12] ahead and go to the word of God this
[4:14] morning so uh let's just bow our heads
[4:16] as before we read the word our heavenly
[4:18] father we thank you Lord for the
[4:20] opportunity to serve you this morning we
[4:23] realize Lord that we're nothing within
[4:24] ourselves Lord but you are our
[4:27] sufficiency this morning Lord you are
[4:29] are all Lord You Are Everything To Us
[4:32] father you are our life Lord physical
[4:35] and spiritual and so Lord Jesus we we
[4:38] ask you this morning Father that you
[4:40] would just forgive us for our sins and
[4:42] our iniquities Lord we we failed you in
[4:45] many ways Lord in our heart Lord Jesus
[4:48] we desire not to fail you at all we
[4:50] desire the Perfection Lord that your
[4:52] word talks to us about Lord God but Lord
[4:55] Jesus we know that we're perfected in
[4:57] the inside and eventually father this
[4:58] body Lord will catch up to that Lord and
[5:01] so father we're just feeding on your
[5:03] word this morning feasting on upon it
[5:05] pray Lord that you would bless us as
[5:07] your word Goes Forth meet every need
[5:09] amongst us and Lord help us to draw
[5:11] closer to you Lord
[5:13] be with brother Dale Lord continue to
[5:15] strengthen our brother Lord our father
[5:17] he's he's labored many years father God
[5:20] and Lord Jesus I prayed Lord that you
[5:22] would just help him Lord and this hour
[5:24] of need Lord and just thank you Lord for
[5:26] for the touch that you've already given
[5:28] him Lord and we just confess it father
[5:30] God that it's going to be a further a
[5:33] further touch Lord Jesus watch over
[5:35] brother Wade and brother Dale and and
[5:37] the family Lord as they're out right now
[5:39] and just keep them safe on the roads
[5:41] Lord and we just commit ourselves now
[5:43] into your hands in this service in the
[5:45] mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[5:47] pray amen amen amen this morning let's
[5:50] turn to James chapter one
[5:52] James chapter 1. and uh
[5:58] and I want to I want to title this uh
[6:00] what is God's mirror saying about you
[6:03] that's a question mark
[6:05] what is God's mirror saying about you
[6:09] not what it's said or what it will say
[6:12] but what is it saying now
[6:14] because the the mirror of God Amen as we
[6:18] should be it should be active
[6:21] it's an active word it's a Living Word
[6:24] and it's and it and it's and it's
[6:27] constantly telling us where we're
[6:28] faltering and where we're not
[6:31] we'll get to it amen
[6:34] but be ye doers James chapter 1 verse 22
[6:36] verse uh to 25. but be doers of the word
[6:40] and not hearers only
[6:44] that's clear it's clear like the mirror
[6:48] the ye doers of the word and not hearers
[6:50] only it's a hard thing sometimes amen
[6:53] especially when the brother or the
[6:54] sister is telling you saying something
[6:56] to you just getting on your nerves
[6:59] it's hard like what brother Bob was
[7:01] talking about this morning I want to get
[7:03] angry
[7:04] but that's not gonna it's not gonna make
[7:08] anything better
[7:10] you pray for the brother pray for the
[7:12] sister watch what the Bible says here
[7:14] but be the words of the word and not
[7:16] here is only deceiving your own selves
[7:19] you deceive your own selves when you do
[7:21] that
[7:22] when you just when you when you don't
[7:24] put the word into action for if any be a
[7:26] hearer of the word and not a doer he is
[7:30] like unto a man behold in his natural
[7:33] face in a glass
[7:36] and that is a mirror
[7:37] for he beholdeth himself in other words
[7:41] he looks at himself
[7:43] quickly
[7:45] notice that he's using the the he
[7:47] because a a man he he kind of does that
[7:49] but a woman she stays in the mirror good
[7:52] a good bit
[7:54] so she she makes sure that that she she
[7:58] takes care of you know her look and some
[8:01] men too but uh
[8:03] but if he beholdth himself and he go and
[8:06] goeth his way
[8:08] and straightway forgets what manner of
[8:11] man he was or in other words what image
[8:13] he just now looked at
[8:15] what you see but whosoever watch what he
[8:19] says here but
[8:21] but who so looketh into the perfect
[8:24] mirror or the law of Liberty
[8:28] and and not just looks but watch what it
[8:31] says and continuous therein
[8:34] all right that's key and continuous
[8:37] therein he being not a forgetful hearer
[8:41] but a doer of the work
[8:44] this man
[8:46] shall be blessed in his deed
[8:49] amen amen so this morning sayings I just
[8:51] want to this is I I want to talk about
[8:54] this this morning and I want to I want
[8:57] to challenge you all this morning I want
[8:58] to talk about the mirror of God Amen I'm
[9:01] gonna put this right here as a
[9:04] as an example for hopefully it doesn't
[9:06] fall
[9:08] the mayor of God Amen what does the
[9:11] mayor say about you
[9:13] when you look at it
[9:15] amen you may have your sheets this
[9:17] morning it's so good to have the maroon
[9:19] goes back this this morning
[9:27] Sarah we missed you
[9:31] we missed David and we miss sister Anna
[9:34] and we miss Brother Anderson too
[9:36] [Laughter]
[9:39] amen no we certainly you all we all
[9:42] thought about you all and we're like my
[9:44] when are they going to get back
[9:47] because we miss when the family of God
[9:49] isn't isn't all of us are here amen you
[9:52] all are just as much family as closer
[9:54] than even natural family is amen
[9:57] praise God because you're the ones who
[9:59] are going to leave in eternity with
[10:02] so you should be excited to see one
[10:05] another amen
[10:06] amen but what is the mirror of God say
[10:09] about you amen
[10:10] Amen brother Brandon would say like this
[10:12] he says this and the message of
[10:13] identification and that's what we want
[10:16] to look at tonight or this morning
[10:19] I want to look at me and I want you to
[10:24] look at yourself
[10:26] and as we look into God's Great mirror
[10:30] of his word
[10:33] so that's what the mirror is is his word
[10:35] amen
[10:37] let our be able to identify ourselves
[10:40] amen with some that we're going to speak
[10:44] about some of the characters of of other
[10:46] times and I want to see myself in God's
[10:50] looking glass because if anything will
[10:54] show you where you're standing
[10:57] if anything will show you where you're
[10:59] standing it's this book
[11:02] amen
[11:04] there's no book like it
[11:07] there's no book like it because it is
[11:10] all truth amen I don't say that other
[11:14] books are not true but I know this one's
[11:16] true it's all truth
[11:19] because it's the word of God Amen so
[11:24] first of all we have to establish that
[11:26] this word is all truth amen and if and
[11:29] if you don't believe that the word of
[11:31] God is true and or some things are true
[11:33] and some things amen there's a problem
[11:36] right there the mirror of God can't help
[11:38] you then there's cracks in the mirror
[11:41] so so so so so in some areas you're
[11:44] seeing certain air good parts of of
[11:47] yourself but in other areas it's cracked
[11:49] and a cracked mirror can't help you
[11:52] remember when you're looking at a mirror
[11:54] amen when you're looking at the word of
[11:55] God in a in a in a perverted way
[11:59] I believe this but I don't know about
[12:00] this I can't I'll apply this in my life
[12:03] because it's easy but I can't apply this
[12:05] in my life amen you are looking at God's
[12:07] word as if it's cracked
[12:10] and you think that that is helping you
[12:12] but in reality it's not given you the
[12:14] Perfect Image or the perfect solution
[12:16] for you to take action upon God's word
[12:20] you see what I'm saying because as we're
[12:22] going to talk about here in just a
[12:23] moment amen when you look at a mirror
[12:25] amen it puts you into action
[12:27] and that's what James is talking about
[12:29] here amen when we look into the mirror
[12:31] of God Amen it's supposed to put us into
[12:34] action to do something
[12:37] to do something about it and not just
[12:39] looking at it or just hearing it but to
[12:42] do something about it amen and that's
[12:44] the problem they that we that we have
[12:47] amen is that we don't put the word of
[12:49] God into action we look we're a good
[12:51] Sunday and Wednesday Christians
[12:54] but not good during the week to put what
[12:56] we heard on Wednesday and Sunday into
[12:58] action
[13:00] amen that's you amen taking that mirror
[13:03] with you everywhere you go I'm putting
[13:06] it I want to make oh I'm going facing
[13:08] this situation I'm gonna see what the
[13:10] mirror of God says amen and then I'm
[13:12] putting into action amen I'm going I'm
[13:15] walking I'm going to work let's see what
[13:16] the grunted situation amen let's see
[13:18] what the mirror of God says amen every
[13:20] single moment you are amen you're always
[13:22] got the mirror before you
[13:24] [Laughter]
[13:28] praise the Lord I want to embarrass
[13:30] Natalia too much we'll go over to
[13:32] Michael
[13:33] [Laughter]
[13:36] praise God the mirror of God it never
[13:39] lies
[13:40] it always tells the truth ain't that
[13:42] right Zach
[13:43] it always tells the truth amen
[13:46] amen so what is a mirror well we see
[13:49] what a mirror is but a a definition of a
[13:51] mirror is a piece of glass that reflects
[13:53] images man something that shows what
[13:57] another thing is like in a very clear
[14:01] and accurate way
[14:04] amen it's very scary if I looked in this
[14:06] mirror and I saw someone else
[14:10] man I looked at myself and then I see
[14:12] Zach in the mirror the world what's
[14:15] going on
[14:16] that's kind of creepy actually
[14:19] or some other image
[14:21] kind of like when's in the movie Snow
[14:22] White you know when the wicked witch was
[14:24] looking in the mirror and she would see
[14:25] that that image there that face it
[14:27] wasn't her but the mirror was talking
[14:29] back to her amen
[14:32] it would be scary amen but when you look
[14:34] remember the mirror is like is the word
[14:37] of God when you look into the word of
[14:39] God Amen you're supposed it's supposed
[14:41] to reflect light on you
[14:43] because it is light
[14:45] and then you can see yourself as you're
[14:48] looking into it is exposing every single
[14:51] thing in your life that is not supposed
[14:53] to be there yes amen amen we have
[14:56] mirrors amen for example there's vanity
[14:59] mirrors that have lights uh light around
[15:01] it it's Shining Light
[15:04] and then it so that you can see yourself
[15:07] better
[15:08] so that's what that's what the word of
[15:10] God is amen you can't see yourself in
[15:13] the mirror in the dark
[15:16] amen you can't see yourself in a mirror
[15:18] amen when there is no presence of light
[15:21] there already has to be a presence of
[15:23] light right there for you to be able to
[15:25] see yourself properly in the mirror but
[15:28] that's how some of us is amen we've been
[15:30] we've we've we've seen the light
[15:33] but we don't stay in the mirror long
[15:34] enough in order to to use that light of
[15:37] the word a man to be able to fix
[15:40] ourselves up the way we need to you see
[15:42] spiritually speaking amen
[15:45] amen now
[15:47] so it's it's something that shows
[15:48] another thing like a very clear Accurate
[15:50] Way something that gives a true
[15:52] representation
[15:53] amen a mirror never lies
[15:57] all right and as I say the mirror a man
[15:59] can only act it must reflect the light
[16:01] the mirror reflects light it doesn't it
[16:03] doesn't hold hold in light you see
[16:06] it's Shining Light and it's reflecting
[16:09] light back to you so that you can see
[16:10] yourself and that's how a mirror works
[16:12] now in the in the in the Bible times
[16:15] they didn't have mirrors made out of
[16:18] glass and and and the way we have them
[16:21] now
[16:22] they use mirrors of brass
[16:24] those are the types of mirrors that they
[16:26] used amen and and and and the way James
[16:29] talks about it here is that he the man
[16:32] looks into the into the mirror amen and
[16:36] the way and the way back then that they
[16:37] had to look into the mirrors is they had
[16:39] to kind of manipulate the mirror or the
[16:42] or or that brass and manipulate it in a
[16:46] way that that okay right there it looks
[16:48] good I'm getting all the light so that I
[16:50] can see myself
[16:52] and that's what James is talking about
[16:53] amen you take time amen when you're
[16:57] looking in the word of God when you're
[16:59] looking in the message of God Amen you
[17:00] take time in order to see yourself
[17:03] properly amen
[17:05] praise God
[17:07] because this is this is how some of us
[17:09] say man we go we we take the Christian
[17:11] Life
[17:19] and move on
[17:21] and you got something on your face that
[17:24] you need to clean up
[17:26] you ain't shaving I don't know how long
[17:30] you you you you you for the for for us
[17:33] for the teenagers and you got busted
[17:35] pimple amen that you busted and you
[17:38] didn't clean up
[17:41] sorry that sounds nasty but that's how
[17:43] some of us we walk spiritually
[17:46] with something on our face a stain on
[17:48] our shirt something on our life and this
[17:51] is what we do oh that's okay
[17:55] the mirror can't help you
[17:58] the mayor is there to show you Amen to
[18:00] the whole time oh look look what I have
[18:02] here
[18:04] oh my then you it puts you into action
[18:07] right
[18:08] the mirror puts you into action praise
[18:10] God
[18:12] now I'm just gonna put it right here
[18:13] like that so that it again
[18:16] yeah
[18:19] so the word of God Amen supposed to put
[18:22] us into action amen
[18:24] praise God
[18:26] now James when he was talking here to
[18:28] the to the Believers amen he he was
[18:30] talking he wasn't talking to unchristian
[18:32] people
[18:34] he was talking to two Christians he was
[18:36] talking to believers a Man Who Loved the
[18:39] word of God and and would look into the
[18:42] word of God but something that was
[18:45] happening that they were not seeing
[18:47] their their faults or or or or or
[18:50] themselves properly in order to continue
[18:52] amen properly walking with with God Amen
[18:55] because he tells them amen in in James 1
[18:58] verse 22 he tells he calls them my
[19:01] brethren so they were his brothers they
[19:03] were they were fellow Believers in verse
[19:05] 16 there he says do not earn my beloved
[19:07] Brethren wherefore my beloved Brethren
[19:10] so he wasn't talking about about Sinners
[19:12] out here amen he was talking to
[19:14] Believers amen and believers do that
[19:17] Believers amen don't read the word of
[19:19] God the way they should
[19:21] but you believe
[19:23] but you're not in the word of God
[19:24] sufficiently or in the mirror of God in
[19:26] order for you to to to to realize that
[19:29] there's something wrong in your life
[19:32] oh I'm okay I've been in this all my
[19:34] life this is what I grew up with Amen in
[19:37] realities something is cantering inside
[19:39] of you amen hate uh uh uh uh deceit
[19:43] something amen is Conquering you but you
[19:45] think you are okay because you haven't
[19:47] spent full time in detail in the word of
[19:50] God
[19:52] because the word of God exposes all
[19:54] those things
[19:57] and sometimes he does it through a
[19:58] preacher
[20:00] and just like the wicked witch Amen in
[20:02] in Snow White amen she was fine she was
[20:04] just fine when when when when the mayor
[20:07] was telling her she was the most
[20:10] beautiful amen where she would say
[20:11] mirror mirror on the wall who's the
[20:13] fairest of them all you are oh I like

[20:58] sorry the mirror of God the word of God
[21:01] I'm we're just preaching amen what's
[21:03] wrong with you if it's the word of God
[21:06] but you get mad
[21:08] then the problem is you and it's not the
[21:11] preacher's fault oh it's it's it's that
[21:13] brother and that sister's fault amen
[21:15] that that my kids started going the way
[21:17] they are no it's a problem I be with you

[21:31] you
[21:32] amen the word of God is clear yes man
[21:35] it's a mayor amen look at yourself in it
[21:41] I promise we don't look
[21:46] We Stand we spend too much time at
[21:49] making sure that other people are
[21:50] looking in their mirrors
[21:53] and you don't look at yourself in your
[21:54] own mirror
[21:58] that mirror over there looks better and
[22:00] I hope he's looking at it brother
[22:01] Jonathan I hope you're looking in the
[22:03] mirror
[22:05] because he's got some problems I I don't
[22:08] or or vice versa I hope he gets that
[22:11] taken care of in his life amen what
[22:13] about your problems oh I grew up in the
[22:16] message I've been in the message
[22:17] years amen you got problems spiritual
[22:19] problems thinking about the brother that
[22:20] way
[22:22] oh come on now
[22:25] but you see we don't think about
[22:28] ourselves because in that way because
[22:30] hey we're under a cover of the church
[22:33] we're under a cover of the ministry at
[22:35] the church and we don't think that
[22:37] nothing is wrong with us and in reality
[22:39] it's all wrong
[22:41] you just don't see yourself see a a a
[22:43] liar doesn't think he's a liar
[22:46] a cheater doesn't think he's a cheater a
[22:49] gossiper doesn't think he's a he's he's
[22:52] a gossiper a backbiter a long tongued
[22:55] person doesn't think that they're a
[22:56] long-time person it's when something or
[22:59] someone exposes it it's when they
[23:01] realize hopefully because sometimes amen
[23:04] you expose it and they still don't know
[23:06] what are you talking about oh you must
[23:08] be talking about him
[23:12] man I want to look in the mirror of God
[23:15] and I if the preaching amen is
[23:18] stomping on my toes that I need
[23:20] Band-Aids on every single toe amen God
[23:23] so be it I want it amen because I want
[23:26] to get out of here and I know that
[23:28] that's your desire too
[23:29] praise the Lord
[23:33] sometimes preaching can't be soft
[23:35] sometimes it is
[23:37] sometimes we need it hard especially if
[23:39] the minister or the pastor amen is
[23:42] seeing something amen he knows his Sheep
[23:44] amen well and that's what a true
[23:47] Shepherd does amen he looks at his sheep
[23:48] and he says all right this person in
[23:50] their life now you're not going to
[23:52] preach against just that one person in
[23:53] the whole sermon amen you use wisdom
[23:55] amen but he knows the needs of his sheep
[23:59] and he's going to use not his opinions
[24:01] or his or his or his own thing Amen to
[24:04] try to hit the hit that brother he's
[24:07] going to use the word
[24:08] the word is the expository the word is
[24:10] the mirror right right praise the Lord
[24:14] Jesus
[24:14] [Music]
[24:16] so these Believers amen they were they
[24:18] they loved the word they heard the word
[24:20] they have seen the light but they were
[24:22] not put in the light the light wasn't
[24:24] putting them into action
[24:25] and that's the problem with us in this
[24:27] hour amen we don't put the light of God
[24:30] Amen we don't put the word of God into
[24:32] action amen
[24:34] now
[24:38] the word activate amen it means this it
[24:42] may make something active or operative
[24:45] or in other words to turn on
[24:48] amen or or to operate or to start Amen
[24:51] to start up to trigger to get going to
[24:53] set in motion
[24:55] amen that is what the word activate
[24:57] means amen and when when we look into
[25:00] the word of God Amen and we don't put it
[25:02] into action amen that is not you
[25:06] activating the word of God Amen you read
[25:08] The Promise
[25:09] you saw the promise you looked in the
[25:11] mirror amen but it wasn't sufficient
[25:13] enough to put you into action this
[25:16] morning when I got up amen and and I
[25:18] went to the Mirror it was terrible by
[25:21] the way
[25:23] but I went to the mayor and and I looked
[25:25] and I saw that I needed to take care of
[25:28] you know my my beard was a little bit
[25:30] grown out and I said you know I don't
[25:31] want to go behind the pulpit with that
[25:33] with that Scruff you know
[25:35] so what did I do it put me into action
[25:37] and I started shaving
[25:39] started and and the whole time I'm
[25:41] looking in the mirror amen it's showing
[25:43] me where I need to where I need to shave
[25:45] what areas oh I'm missing here oh I mean
[25:48] look right here but the mirror's showing
[25:49] me the whole time
[25:52] and we don't spend enough time in the
[25:53] word of God Amen to do that
[25:56] oh it's sufficient that I just did a
[25:58] little five minute devotional in the
[25:59] morning that's all right
[26:02] it's okay but but you only shaved half
[26:04] of your face you still got a bunch
[26:05] around here
[26:07] for us man
[26:09] are you sisters amen then fix your hairs
[26:11] you only fix one side of it but the
[26:13] other side still that's how we do with a
[26:15] five-minute devotion
[26:17] with a two-minute prayer
[26:19] come on Amen but when you spend time and
[26:22] I'm talking about you're you're you're
[26:23] not leaving there until you until you
[26:25] get results
[26:27] you're not leaving the mirror hey man
[26:29] some of us say man we don't leave the
[26:31] mirror until I look the way I need to
[26:33] look that's how we should treat the word
[26:35] of God you ain't leaving the word of God
[26:36] Amen I'm not leaving this example amen
[26:39] until I'm I'm reflecting the image of
[26:41] Jesus Christ until I look exactly like
[26:44] Jesus amen
[26:46] that's how we should take the word of
[26:47] God praise God
[26:49] Amen brother Brown says this he says now
[26:52] he could reveal some things to you
[26:55] this is striking right here
[26:58] he says he could reveal some things to
[27:00] you and if you don't believe it it will
[27:03] never be active in your life
[27:07] you have to believe it
[27:10] now think of of Peter for example
[27:13] Peter had he he was asked who do you say
[27:17] that I the son of man am by Jesus
[27:20] himself
[27:22] and Peter what is his reply Peter
[27:26] replies Thou Art the Christ the son of
[27:30] the Living God
[27:31] that was a revelation to Peter but it
[27:34] wasn't sufficient active in order to he
[27:38] still denied him
[27:40] it was enough Revelation that he had it
[27:43] was exactly what brother Brown said here
[27:45] now you he could God could reveal
[27:48] something to you but if you don't
[27:50] believe it
[27:51] you're not it's not going to be active
[27:53] in your life
[27:55] it wasn't sufficient enough Amen to give
[27:57] Peter amen the strength to not deny
[28:01] Jesus
[28:02] but he had a revelation
[28:04] I'm afraid that some of us that's how we
[28:06] walk
[28:07] I go to church I've been revealed I've
[28:09] been baptized in the name of Lord Jesus
[28:11] Christ I got enough Revelation Amen to
[28:14] take me to church to to uh to to do
[28:16] something in the church amen but the
[28:18] word of God Amen that Revelation isn't
[28:20] putting you into action
[28:22] and that's our problem amen we need to
[28:26] put the word of God into action not be
[28:28] what here is only but doers of the word
[28:30] of God Amen you have to take God at his
[28:33] word just like Mary did when she the
[28:36] angel met her and said you're going to
[28:38] have a child knowing no man this is what
[28:41] Mary did
[28:42] there was no example of that in the
[28:44] Bible so she could ask the question
[28:47] Lord how can this be be seeing that I
[28:52] know not a man because it never had
[28:54] happened before
[28:55] right
[28:57] now she didn't wait till she was
[28:59] positive she didn't wait till she seen
[29:01] the signs of it didn't wait till she
[29:03] felt like or something no no just as
[29:05] quick as the as quick as the angel said
[29:07] it she went to rejoicing
[29:10] and happy telling everybody I'm going to
[29:13] have a baby
[29:14] not knowing any man
[29:17] defying nature
[29:21] see why she didn't wait till any
[29:23] evidence she didn't wait till she was
[29:25] sure like we do
[29:30] a little afraid she didn't wait I'm
[29:33] gonna make sure that I understand
[29:35] everything
[29:37] about water baptism before I go get
[29:39] baptized
[29:41] I I want to make sure that I understand
[29:43] everything there is to understand about
[29:45] being born again and and I want to make
[29:48] sure that I get this out of my life
[29:50] first before I start going to church
[29:53] or living right or whatever put XYZ
[29:57] no
[29:59] as soon as you hear and you know it's
[30:01] truth take action
[30:04] put it to action because that activates
[30:06] that promise in your life
[30:09] amen that activates that word into your
[30:12] life amen
[30:13] praise God that mirror can't help you
[30:15] amen if if you don't put into action
[30:18] what you're seeing
[30:20] amen praise the Lord Jesus
[30:22] activate the promises of God in that way
[30:26] amen the word of God says I am healed
[30:28] amen In this passage amen I don't feel
[30:32] it I'm gonna activate it I'm gonna
[30:34] believe it and put it into action I'm
[30:37] confessing as the song goes I'm
[30:39] confessing and believing and receiving
[30:42] what Jesus said amen
[30:45] that's how we put into action Mary had
[30:47] no no no no no no proof of that only
[30:51] what an angel was telling her
[30:53] amen
[30:55] she said behold the handmaid of the Lord
[30:57] and and right up then through the
[30:59] country she went rejoicing telling that
[31:02] she was going to have a baby before any
[31:05] sign of life ever showed it in any way
[31:09] she took God at his word
[31:11] amen
[31:13] that's how we should take God as word
[31:15] amen if the word of God says it I
[31:17] believe it if the mirror of God says it
[31:19] I believe it I'm gonna put I'm gonna put
[31:22] it into action amen
[31:24] praise God now we know that America
[31:26] cannot lie amen
[31:28] it always gives a True Image praise God
[31:33] always
[31:35] so we should have more confidence in the
[31:37] word to help us
[31:39] than we should then we do
[31:42] sometimes we we we we we we run into a
[31:45] problem and the last thing we do is go
[31:46] into the word of God
[31:50] sometimes we run into issues in our life
[31:52] and the last person that we talk to is
[31:55] God
[31:57] we talk to everybody else and we call
[32:00] the pastor and we and we and we we talk
[32:02] to the doctor and we call brother so and
[32:05] so in such a state uh and let's see what
[32:09] God says about it
[32:11] I've been there
[32:13] but God has the the answer to you God's
[32:16] mirror shows you what you need to do
[32:19] God's mirror shows you how you need to
[32:22] tie your tie
[32:24] amen I can tie a tie without looking in
[32:27] the mirror
[32:28] but it sure helps to have a mirror
[32:32] amen you see
[32:35] you can probably get help a man from
[32:37] from anybody somewhere
[32:39] but if it's not the help of God
[32:43] amen it's not perfect help
[32:46] right amen
[32:48] brother so and so sister so-and-so can
[32:49] come and ask you for help what's your
[32:52] opinion about this situation or what can
[32:54] you help me with this I mean I can only
[32:55] do so much
[32:57] I don't have the answers to but the word
[32:59] of God does
[33:01] because it's the perfect mirror of God
[33:02] Amen praise the Lord
[33:05] so the word of God is the perfect mirror
[33:07] and it tells it like it is yeah amen
[33:12] tells it like it is we don't like it
[33:15] we don't like it when the mayor tells it
[33:17] like it is
[33:18] my brother's too strong that brother's
[33:21] too too blunt
[33:23] that's what a mirror is
[33:26] a mirror is blunt yes right
[33:29] especially when you when when you turn
[33:32] it this way right here look at this the
[33:34] 3x Zoom
[33:36] says 3x right here
[33:38] and when you look at that mirror Hey
[33:40] sister Regina look at that mirror look
[33:43] oh it's blunt in it
[33:47] but it ain't showing sister Charlotte's
[33:49] problems though right you're showing
[33:50] your your issues
[33:52] I ain't saying you got issues
[33:58] that's what the word of God is
[34:00] the 3x Zoom now we we get away from the
[34:04] from the 3x Zoom you know from the word
[34:06] of God like this and it's if we're not
[34:08] close to the word amen is going to show
[34:10] it is not going to show it properly you
[34:14] see but when we get close to it oh my
[34:17] goodness
[34:17] I have that in my life
[34:20] I got to take care of that
[34:25] the problem is is that we don't get
[34:27] close to the word like we need to
[34:29] because we think the word can't help us
[34:31] I was just it's just it's just letters
[34:34] in a Bible in in a book that were
[34:37] written there thousands of years ago how
[34:39] am I supposed to know if it's true or
[34:41] not well when you don't read it when you
[34:43] don't get close to it you're not going
[34:45] to be able to see if it can help you or
[34:48] not
[34:49] amen
[34:50] praise the Lord
[34:53] amen we were talking about the the witch
[34:55] the Snow White amen that she she was
[34:58] asking the mirror amen mirror mirror on
[35:00] the wall
[35:01] who's the
[35:03] greatest of them all or the prettiest
[35:04] amen
[35:06] and she liked it when the mirror always
[35:08] said that it was her
[35:10] That's what Satan did at the beginning
[35:12] she he was the the anointed chair he was
[35:15] beautiful he still lives
[35:17] his looks haven't changed

[35:25] man look like a woman and a woman look
[35:27] like a man and a a non-binary type
[35:30] person Martin but he's still he still is
[35:33] good

[35:36] creation amen origin he he looks good
[35:40] he's he's everybody he wants to marry
[35:42] your image amen
[35:44] but see now he was happy at one point
[35:49] because he was trying to get you know
[35:51] trying to be like God
[35:54] but then the bride comes on the scene
[35:57] Snow White comes on the scene
[36:00] and so now amen when the when the witch
[36:02] Satan tried asked the mayor the the
[36:06] mayor is now saying

[36:11] and this lives here and this that's and
[36:13] that her skin is as snow as white
[36:15] amen Snow White
[36:18] she's the most beautiful of them all
[36:20] Satan hates that now
[36:22] you know what you know what the witch
[36:24] did in the movie who who I've seen that
[36:26] that Snow White
[36:28] it's an old movie
[36:30] but you know what the witch did
[36:32] what did Satan get he got jealous
[36:36] he got jealous when he knew that the
[36:39] perfect image of of God Amen was being
[36:41] reflected Amen in us as well
[36:45] he gets jealous and so what does he try
[36:48] to do he tries to Mar your image Amen in
[36:50] different ways
[36:52] he tried to get in your life he tries to
[36:54] bring that poison apple into your life

[37:50] to be yes the way God's seen you from
[37:53] the beginning he wants to Mar it now so

[38:03] don't wait till till Satan has marred
[38:06] your image Amen in such a way that it's
[38:08] hard a man to come back to when before
[38:11] he started marring it in that way
[38:16] look in the mirror now
[38:19] because Satan his has his tricks up his
[38:21] sleeve amen

[38:35] of God
[38:37] he hates the image of God he hates what
[38:40] God originally created
[38:43] and therefore you see the the
[38:44] Abominations that you see out here in

[39:14] and you and and kids are being told that
[39:16] that's okay

[39:21] but but the mirror shows you the right
[39:23] identity the mayor tells you amen the
[39:26] marriage of God tells me that in the
[39:27] beginning God created man and woman

[40:26] don't you see it
[40:29] something's wrong with you that's what
[40:31] you're supposed to look like Natty
[40:34] Elizabeth
[40:35] you're supposed to look just like that
[40:40] that's what the world tries to tell you
[40:42] that you're supposed to look like
[40:43] a blurred mess
[40:47] but it's reflecting an image it's
[40:49] reflecting light this is aluminum foil
[40:52] by the way
[40:53] and it reflects light in order to keep
[40:55] food warm right at least that's how I
[40:58] think it works
[40:59] oh
[41:02] but when we sometimes we we get past
[41:05] this point oh no I'm not going to accept
[41:07] all that stuff that the media tells me
[41:09] the media is shoving down lgbtq plus uh
[41:12] rqf l m l o p q r s t u v w x y and z in
[41:17] my on in my down my throat
[41:19] I don't even know what they even got
[41:21] their own types of flags now
[41:26] and it looks all foggy and then don't
[41:28] look clear like the mirror God does
[41:30] don't it
[41:31] but but that the media said Fox News and
[41:34] CNN says that it's okay
[41:38] and then sometimes you know we we don't
[41:40] we don't accept that and and we get
[41:42] religious about it so we turn it to the
[41:45] other side
[41:46] that looks a little bit better right
[41:49] sister Kathy you see yourself there a
[41:51] little bit better right
[41:52] better than this side right
[41:55] ain't that right Zoe
[41:58] I can have confidence in that
[42:01] but you know what that's what people do
[42:02] amen they're just church goers
[42:04] they just use religion Amen in their
[42:07] life amen and that's enough
[42:09] that's good enough for me
[42:12] but you're not seeing it's not clear
[42:13] like that
[42:15] right I just just I believe the message
[42:18] I believe God sent a prophet
[42:23] that's all some of us get to
[42:26] and it is not clear
[42:31] does that make you want to live a holy
[42:34] life and clean up yourself amen
[42:37] amen
[42:38] which one's better
[42:41] why take a a substitute when you can
[42:44] have the real
[42:45] amen
[42:47] there's a there's real mirror out there
[42:50] you don't have to accept the substitute
[42:54] you don't have to accept anything that
[42:56] the devil amen shoves down your throat
[42:59] amen whatever lie he shoves down your
[43:01] throat amen you don't have to accept it
[43:03] when there's something real
[43:05] right as a matter of fact it has 3x zoom
[43:07] in
[43:11] praise God
[43:13] I hope that makes a little sense
[43:16] hope you don't think well he's just
[43:17] Blasphemous up there holding aluminum
[43:19] foil
[43:22] well
[43:24] it makes the point
[43:26] praise God Amen
[43:29] amen we're almost done Proverbs 27
[43:33] 27 19 says this as a face is reflected
[43:36] in water
[43:37] so the heart reflects the real person
[43:42] and remember what Jesus said he said
[43:44] amen as the heart as what is in the
[43:47] heart that's what the mouth speaks
[43:49] or in other words I like to take it as
[43:51] whatever is in your heart that's what
[43:54] comes out of you
[43:55] that's what you live out
[43:57] amen
[43:59] Jesus said that amen for the tree is
[44:01] known by this by his fruit
[44:04] and then he says in in Matthew 12 30 uh
[44:07] 12 verse 34 oh Generation of Vipers how
[44:10] can ye being evil speak good things
[44:14] for out of the abundance of the heart
[44:17] the mouth speaketh
[44:20] whatever you watch
[44:22] whatever you you listen to whatever you
[44:25] feed on whatever you you you consume in
[44:29] your life
[44:31] it's what you're going to
[44:33] speak is what you're going to live yeah
[44:37] right so there's many mirrors in the in
[44:39] life there's the mirror of of of of of
[44:41] social media you're feeding on that and
[44:45] then you're you're living your life amen
[44:47] by that mirror
[44:49] that's what that mirror tells me that
[44:51] I've got to be more like this this that
[44:53] and the other Amen in reality that's all
[44:55] fake
[44:57] there's no reality about that that's a
[44:59] fake mirror
[45:00] or the mirror of of I I've got a I've
[45:04] gotta I gotta make money in my life I
[45:06] I've gotta I've got to take care of this
[45:08] business amen and and that's the mirror
[45:10] that you live by
[45:13] money is the thing I gotta sustain my
[45:16] family and you don't hardly go to church
[45:19] but but but you're sustaining your
[45:21] family there's a problem there
[45:25] your children will see that
[45:29] that's the mayor that some of us we live
[45:31] by
[45:32] I got to sustain my business the
[45:34] business mayor
[45:36] but the business mirror is only
[45:37] temporary
[45:39] your soul is worth ten thousand worlds
[45:42] your soul amen is more important than
[45:44] your business
[45:46] your kids will see that
[45:48] amen it's whatever you put what what you
[45:51] put before God Amen that's that's your
[45:53] God
[45:54] oh I don't like it he was waving the the
[45:58] aluminum foil in front of me I liked
[46:00] that when he was doing that but now he's
[46:01] getting a little bit too personal
[46:05] that's what the mirror does
[46:08] what the mirror amen whatever you put
[46:10] before God Amen is your god
[46:14] and if you don't think it's important
[46:16] Amen to to to go to church or if you
[46:19] don't think it's important Amen to to
[46:20] read your Bible if you don't think it's
[46:22] important amen then something else is
[46:24] replacing that
[46:26] amen something else in your life is
[46:28] replacing that
[46:30] so that's your mayor
[46:32] that's your standard
[46:34] praise God
[46:37] a good man out of the good Treasure of
[46:39] the heart bringeth forth good things
[46:42] amen and an evil man out of the evil
[46:45] treasure bringeth forth evil things amen
[46:49] says what you feed on Amen good mirrors
[46:51] always tell the truth amen
[46:54] they always tell us the truth even if we
[46:56] don't like what we see
[46:58] the word of God is a mirror you can rely
[47:01] on amen how many believe that
[47:04] amen the word the mayor the mirror God
[47:06] is something that you can rely on Amen
[47:09] when when when you're looking in the
[47:12] mirror amen
[47:13] in order for that mirror to give a clear
[47:15] picture amen You've Got to Get Close to
[47:16] the Mirror
[47:18] yeah draw an eye unto God
[47:20] and He will draw nigh unto you right
[47:24] yeah amen
[47:25] praise the Lord
[47:27] in order for the God's word to give you
[47:29] a clear picture of who you are you have
[47:31] to draw close to it amen and we don't go
[47:34] to the mirror to look at the
[47:35] imperfections of the mirror
[47:38] I hope you don't do that sisters you
[47:40] don't go look at the mirror amen this
[47:42] morning when you got up Amen to look in
[47:44] the mirror to see what's wrong with that
[47:46] mirror
[47:48] I need to that mirror needs to be fixed
[47:50] that that's that's not a holy mirror
[47:53] they're telling me something wrong
[47:55] no the mirror doesn't lie you went to
[47:58] the mirror this morning because you're
[48:00] hoping the mirror tells you the truth
[48:02] about yourself
[48:03] that you didn't know before you got to
[48:05] the mirror right
[48:07] but then once you get to the mirror amen
[48:09] you don't look when we look at the word
[48:11] of God we're not looking for
[48:12] imperfections in the word
[48:14] we're looking for the word to expose our
[48:17] imperfections we're the ones with the
[48:20] imperfections amen
[48:23] the word of God doesn't have any
[48:25] the word of God is perfect because he's
[48:28] perfect amen praise the Lord Jesus
[48:31] Amen brother Brown says this that's the
[48:33] way God sees you it ain't what you see
[48:35] your own self it's the way God sees you
[48:37] no man sees himself wrong it's when you
[48:41] look in the mirror of God's word it
[48:42] tells you whether you're wrong or not
[48:45] but we don't take time to do it so we we
[48:47] don't know that we're wrong or not we
[48:49] think we're right and we live life like
[48:50] we're right and we're we think we're
[48:52] happy and where everything is just fine
[48:54] and hunky-dory but you're wrong
[48:57] because the word of God says you're
[48:58] wrong
[49:00] but now it's up to you Amen to take
[49:02] action in your life
[49:03] amen
[49:05] praise God Jesus amen he gave us the the
[49:07] perfect example of what we ought to be
[49:09] looking at amen when he reflected his
[49:12] life amen through US amen when he came
[49:15] here on Earth amen he said I only do
[49:17] without what the father shows me
[49:19] yes amen I only do I'm only going to
[49:21] live out what the mirror amen tells me
[49:23] amen because he was just as much human
[49:26] as he was God so he was more concerned
[49:28] about what God's mirror said
[49:30] to to do what God's mayor said then then
[49:33] his own opinion amen praise God
[49:37] amen so
[49:39] let's read here real quick amen because
[49:41] sometimes
[49:42] sometimes the mirror of God Amen tells
[49:44] us amen that we are a certain way and
[49:47] and it's the mirror of God Amen is
[49:50] pulling for us or it's rooting for us
[49:54] but we don't accept it
[49:56] because we're we feel so downtrodden
[49:58] down in life and so depressed
[50:02] I'm never gonna get out of this this
[50:05] mode in my life I'm I'm just like this I
[50:08] can't change
[50:10] but the word of God says something
[50:11] different about you
[50:13] and sometimes we don't we don't take
[50:16] action Amen to fix the things that are
[50:18] wrong in our life but yet we don't take
[50:20] action sometimes to see what God is
[50:23] really is rooting for you
[50:26] and you're the one who's who's trotting
[50:29] yourself down right amen amen you take
[50:32] for example the children of Israel in
[50:34] numbers amen you can go back to numbers
[50:36] in Chapter 13 and you read there in this
[50:39] 10 spies we're told Amen to go to the to
[50:42] the other to the you know to the land
[50:45] that's flowing with milk and honey honey
[50:47] to the promised land and they were to
[50:49] give a report now Caleb and Joshua was
[50:51] one one of those 10 spies
[50:53] and they were looked and they saw that
[50:55] that that there was there was trouble
[50:58] there were giants in the Land There was
[51:01] a uh uh you know things that they were
[51:04] going to have to confront and so when
[51:07] they came back to give Moses the report
[51:09] amen a out of the ten spies were taught
[51:12] we're talking and telling Moses we see
[51:16] that it's good
[51:17] we know that the land is good we know
[51:20] that going to church is good and we know
[51:22] that that that living the Christian Life
[51:25] Is Good
[51:27] but we can't do it
[51:29] brother so and so can sister so-and-so
[51:32] can Michael can do it but I can't
[51:35] it's exactly what they were telling
[51:37] Moses
[51:39] and and watch what they say there's
[51:43] something key and if you if you read in
[51:45] numbers amen
[51:47] in in Numbers chapter 12 verse 33 or 13
[51:50] numbers 13 verse verse 33 it says and
[51:53] there we saw the Giants the sons of anak
[51:56] which come up the Giants and we were in
[51:59] our own sight as grasshoppers
[52:04] they saw themselves as grasshoppers and
[52:07] watch and so we were in their sight
[52:12] so however they saw themselves is how
[52:15] they thought that the world was looking
[52:16] at them too
[52:18] you see the way you think you are the
[52:21] way you look at yourself
[52:23] is the way you think others look at you
[52:26] you use that mirror of your own of your
[52:29] own self
[52:30] of your of your own marred image of your
[52:33] own thing Amen to think that that's how
[52:35] people look at you
[52:37] and that's what was happening amen here
[52:39] in the with the children of Israel
[52:41] but if you go back and read in verse 30
[52:43] it previously amen Caleb and Joshua was
[52:46] they were looking at us something
[52:47] different
[52:48] they were looking at a different mirror
[52:50] hey man they were looking at the promise
[52:52] of the mirror of God Amen the mirror of
[52:54] the promise of God that said that I'm
[52:56] going to give you this land he didn't
[52:59] say how they were going to do it or what
[53:01] they were going to do or the details of
[53:02] it he just said I give it to you just go
[53:05] and possess it it's yours you are you
[53:09] are you have joy in your life the Holy
[53:11] Ghost is yours healing is is yours amen
[53:13] all these benefits of the word amen
[53:15] they're yours but it's up to you to go
[53:18] and take them
[53:20] amen amen
[53:22] and that was their testimony amen Caleb
[53:25] says this he says this in verse 30 he
[53:27] says when they were there in in the
[53:30] previous verses they were there talking
[53:31] talking unbelief
[53:36] they got the Revelation but they were
[53:38] talking unbelief and Caleb stilled the
[53:42] people before Moses
[53:44] still the people shut up
[53:47] be quiet
[53:49] that's not according to the promise
[53:52] he's still the people before Moses and
[53:54] said let us go up at once
[53:58] and possess it
[54:00] amen yes for we we not just him but we
[54:06] are well able to overcome it
[54:10] how did he know that he was only seeing
[54:13] the promise
[54:15] the promise of God said that we can that
[54:17] we're going to
[54:18] all the way back from Abraham and that's
[54:21] what Caleb and Joshua was looking at
[54:24] amen
[54:25] but the Devil comes in with that
[54:26] poisoned apple and says you're a
[54:28] depressed person
[54:30] you need medication in your life
[54:34] you need all kind at 15 you need
[54:36] medication
[54:38] something's wrong
[54:40] Satan's Satan's giving you three or four
[54:42] five six poison apples then
[54:46] because I mean it's sad to see that our
[54:48] young people nowadays they battle these
[54:50] mind battles
[54:52] Satan's really giving out these poison
[54:54] mine apples Amen in their life
[54:58] and some of us as adults we just kind of
[55:00] stand around and just oh they'll figure
[55:02] it out themselves
[55:06] we try to draw the main man closer to
[55:08] the mirror of God that that can help
[55:09] them
[55:10] ultimately it's up to them to make the
[55:12] decision it's up to you
[55:14] it's up to you young people Amen to get
[55:16] out of the ruts that you're in
[55:19] trouble we can only take you up to a
[55:20] certain point but it's up to you
[55:23] to make that decision yourself what are
[55:25] you going to do with your life
[55:27] are you going to just stay right there
[55:29] or are you just gonna are you gonna move
[55:31] on with God
[55:32] amen
[55:35] there's too much of God Amen for me to
[55:37] just stay where I am in my rut or in my
[55:39] or in my in my depressed state
[55:42] amen I you know if God if if if you have
[55:46] a desire to have a family amen that
[55:48] you've got to get out of that place that
[55:50] you're in that depressed mode or that
[55:52] that mode that you're in amen you've got
[55:55] to
[55:56] you want to you want to make something
[55:58] out of yourself you want to help others
[55:59] in life you've got to help yourself
[56:02] the word of God Amen gives you the the
[56:05] the the the the the the
[56:07] the uh the the medicine
[56:13] no excuse in this hour Caleb then Caleb
[56:16] wasn't looking at that amen he was
[56:17] looking at let us go up at once and
[56:19] possess it for we are well able to
[56:21] overcome it
[56:22] but the man that went up with him said
[56:24] we be not able to go up against the
[56:27] people
[56:28] for they are stronger than we
[56:31] and then when you read in the next next
[56:33] chapter amen uh in the next chapter
[56:35] Caleb and Joshua are trying to rule the
[56:38] tell the people we are able to come on
[56:42] let's go we can't make it we're looking
[56:44] at the promise amen and that's what
[56:46] we're doing Amen in this hour amen uh us
[56:48] as ministers Amen in this hour you're
[56:50] you're we are trying to root you I mean
[56:52] to keep going we keep moving forward
[56:54] amen the promise is yours
[56:58] go and possess it it's it's laying in
[57:00] the word already it's you you see it
[57:03] but now go and take action
[57:06] go do something about it
[57:08] amen praise the Lord Jesus
[57:12] amen so
[57:14] let's get skip some of this here for the
[57:16] sake of time amen second Corinthians 3
[57:18] 18 tells us but we all with open face
[57:21] beholden as in a glass or a mirror the
[57:23] glory of the Lord are changed into the
[57:25] same image
[57:27] from glory to glory even as by the
[57:31] spirit of the Lord amen
[57:32] we're going to be changed into that
[57:34] image amen of the Jesus Christ the more
[57:37] we look at Jesus Christ
[57:39] we're going to be looking more like him
[57:41] amen
[57:43] one of the examples that I like amen is
[57:45] when it was when David sinned
[57:47] amen and and he uh
[57:50] Nathan the prophet amen came to him and
[57:53] exposed his sin
[57:56] pull the mirror right in front of him
[57:58] and told it to him just like it like it
[58:00] is because he had to God had told him to
[58:03] go tell David what he had done I'm not
[58:06] pleased with
[58:07] but yet he thinks he's still okay he's
[58:09] because he's a king and he's got a
[58:11] position and he's okay amen I'm not
[58:13] pleased with that so the preacher came
[58:15] to David
[58:17] and preached on him
[58:20] told him a thing or two according to the
[58:22] word of God
[58:25] and you know what God calls David after
[58:27] he he was a murderer he was an adulterer
[58:29] he what he did with the things he did
[58:31] God calls David a man after my own heart
[58:35] you know why because immediately when
[58:38] David heard his sin and he immediately
[58:41] he he knew that that was the man that
[58:43] Nathan the prophet was talking about
[58:46] he said I have sinned he said I'm not
[58:49] I'm he immediately went to go to
[58:53] repentance mode amen
[58:55] and you see his repentance
[58:58] his repentance in Psalms chapter 51 52
[59:01] somewhere around there amen David was
[59:03] with tears repenting I mean he wasn't
[59:06] even eating he wasn't he was really
[59:09] sorry for what he did
[59:11] and but yet Nathan the prophet calls
[59:14] tells tells the God tells Nathan the
[59:16] prophet to tell David that tell him that
[59:18] I have already forgiven his sin even
[59:21] before David actually went to the actual
[59:23] Act of
[59:25] repenting because he knew David was
[59:28] going to do that
[59:30] Amen in verse in second Samuel 12 13 and
[59:33] David said unto Nathan I have sinned
[59:34] against the Lord and Nathan said unto
[59:36] David the Lord also hath put away thy
[59:38] sin
[59:39] Thou shalt not die
[59:44] so God lied her or he did it
[59:47] God had already in his mind already
[59:49] forgiven David because he knew what
[59:51] David was going to do see God lives in
[59:53] in time frames amen he doesn't live in
[59:56] time he lives in a different way than
[59:58] than we live
[59:59] you see he knew David's heart
[1:00:03] amen what what do you do when someone
[1:00:06] exposes something in your life
[1:00:09] then it's the truth
[1:00:12] well it's the truth but I don't like the
[1:00:13] way she said that
[1:00:15] I don't like the way he said it
[1:00:19] but he just came to the word he he said
[1:00:21] it to you with the word
[1:00:22] I still don't like it
[1:00:25] who is he or she to tell me that
[1:00:27] I've been in this church 40 50 years
[1:00:32] there's a problem with you then
[1:00:34] it's not a problem with the word and

[1:01:06] Lord
[1:01:09] ask yourself those questions
[1:01:11] do I really in my heart serve the Lord
[1:01:16] because remember amen whatever's in your
[1:01:18] heart that's what's going to come out
[1:01:21] so if it's contrary to the word then
[1:01:24] that shows that you're not serving the
