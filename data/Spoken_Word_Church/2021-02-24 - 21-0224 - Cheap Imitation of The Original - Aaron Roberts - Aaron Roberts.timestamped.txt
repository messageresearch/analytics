[18:06] genesis chapter one then we'll go to
[18:09] isaiah
[18:11] chapter 14.
[18:15] so y'all just pray for me tonight
[18:20] and i
[18:23] uh got a phone call
[18:27] earlier from brother richie douglas and
[18:30] he had they was waiting they had just
[18:33] sent his mom in the
[18:35] in the ambulance when he called me and
[18:38] they wanted the church to pray
[18:39] for his mom she fell when i said she
[18:42] fell yesterday and then she fell again
[18:44] today
[18:45] and they think she might have messed up
[18:47] her shoulder they're not sure
[18:49] but they didn't want him to move or
[18:51] anybody to move her until the ambulance
[18:53] got there to take her so
[18:55] he called me and kind of shook up so
[19:00] he said tell brother dale in the church
[19:01] to pray so
[19:08] so
[19:12] you know
[19:17] a lot of us call her mama douglas and
[19:20] sister christine and
[19:25] incredible woman of faith
[19:29] and you know y'all y'all for brother
[19:30] ritchie's testimony about
[19:33] you know that was his aunt and uncle
[19:34] that is mom and dad and
[19:36] you know he was born without an ankle
[19:38] bone
[19:40] she carried him in every prayer line
[19:41] that she could
[19:44] and they didn't really have any hope
[19:47] or any idea what to do for him
[19:50] but she had a x-ray
[19:54] of that foot and it didn't have an ankle
[19:55] bone and then one day they had an x-ray
[19:58] and it did have an ankle ball
[20:02] [Applause]
[20:05] so he walks he walks with a limp but
[20:08] he's a big old fella but you know what
[20:10] he's walking on faith truly that's a
[20:14] that's a miracle right there
[20:16] and you know all the things that
[20:19] you know if you ever if you're ever
[20:20] around her any any length of time she's
[20:22] got a book
[20:23] and everything that she's prayed for and
[20:25] god's delivered
[20:26] she was looking for some furniture for
[20:28] her up for she you know she has a
[20:30] trailer and she was looking for some
[20:31] furniture
[20:32] and she kind of told the lord what she
[20:33] was wanting well you know what she found
[20:35] it and she's got pictures of it
[20:37] she's got it all in her photo album she
[20:40] was sitting down one day and she was
[20:41] showing me all these pictures
[20:42] things that god had done that she had
[20:44] prayed about and she had the evidence
[20:46] there
[20:48] so you know she's a
[20:51] incredible lady of faith and we love her
[20:55] and thank a lot of her you know she used
[20:58] to call me
[20:59] every time she'd see me and she'd always
[21:01] call me dale
[21:03] i look so much like daddy and she'd get
[21:05] confused and she'd be talking to me and
[21:07] she called me dale so
[21:09] brother richie still calls me that
[21:10] sometimes just picking on me you know
[21:13] so i'll just pray for them and then um
[21:18] i'm not even sure who they are it's it's
[21:19] some people there in
[21:21] in jefferson and uh this man i don't
[21:24] know who he is he just posted on
[21:25] facebook today that
[21:27] his wife's been on the ventilator with
[21:28] coven since
[21:31] last month that she's not gotten any
[21:32] better and he was telling he was asking
[21:35] for prayer from everybody so
[21:38] you know there's lots of people that are
[21:40] out there and you know if somebody was
[21:45] was to sit down and
[21:48] take the time to write that that's just
[21:51] not something just to gloss over or look
[21:53] at
[21:53] but you know it really touched my heart
[21:58] i don't know who the people are but you
[22:00] know we know that's the god knows who
[22:02] they are
[22:04] and i know there's many other ones as
[22:06] brother
[22:08] terence mentioned this evening we know
[22:09] there's many that
[22:11] have a need and god's mindful of all of
[22:15] them
[22:16] but you know sometimes he lays it on our
[22:18] heart do the praying
[22:21] to do the interceding for them so
[22:25] as we look tonight in in genesis chapter
[22:27] one let's just all bow our heads and

[24:59] to you in the name of jesus christ we
[25:00] pray amen
[25:03] amen genesis chapter 1
[25:06] we'll begin at verse 11 and i'm
[25:11] trying not to make a mess genesis
[25:14] chapter 1
[25:16] verse 11 said and god said let the earth
[25:18] bring forth grass
[25:19] the herb yielding seed and the fruit
[25:22] tree
[25:23] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[25:26] is in itself upon the earth and it was
[25:28] sow
[25:29] and the earth brought forth grass and
[25:30] herb yielding seed after his kind
[25:33] and the tree yielding fruit whose seed
[25:35] was in itself
[25:37] after his kind and god saw that it was
[25:39] good
[25:40] now we'll go to isaiah 14.
[25:46] let's go let's look a little
[25:49] odd but 14
[25:53] isaiah 14 12 says how art thou
[25:56] fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the
[25:58] morning
[25:59] how are thou cut down to the ground
[26:02] which doubt which did weaken
[26:04] the nations for thou has said in thine
[26:07] heart i will ascend into heaven i will
[26:09] exalt my throne above
[26:11] the stars of god i will sit also upon
[26:14] the mount
[26:14] of the congregation in the sides of the
[26:17] north i will ascend above the heights of
[26:19] the clouds i will be like
[26:21] the most high yet thou shalt be brought
[26:23] down to hell
[26:25] to the sides of the pit
[26:28] they that see thee shall narrowly look
[26:31] upon thee and consider thee saying
[26:33] is this the man that thus man that made
[26:36] the earth to tremble that did
[26:38] shaken kingdoms that made the world as a
[26:41] wilderness and destroyed the cities
[26:42] thereof
[26:43] that opened not the house of his
[26:45] prisoners
[26:46] amen god bless you night you may be
[26:48] seated
[26:51] from the message the spoken word is the
[26:55] original seed brother branham reads this
[26:56] scripture
[26:59] and he starts in genesis chapter one
[27:02] and so he says now god's word is eternal
[27:06] god being
[27:07] infinite cannot speak one thing and then
[27:12] later on change it to something else to
[27:14] a better decision
[27:17] because every decision of god is perfect
[27:19] he cannot
[27:20] once his word is once spoken it can
[27:23] never die it lives on
[27:24] and on and on and can never die because
[27:27] it is god
[27:30] his word can no more die than he can die
[27:32] that's the reason we read in
[27:34] first john or saint john first chapter
[27:36] he said in the beginning was the word
[27:38] and the word was with god and the word
[27:39] was god
[27:40] and the word was made flesh the same
[27:42] word that was spoken in the beginning
[27:45] with his eternal purpose came on over
[27:48] and was made flesh and dwelt among us
[27:50] god's word so
[27:54] i want to speak a little thought today
[27:57] and y'all may find it a little odd
[28:02] but it's i entitled this the cheap
[28:05] imitation of the original
[28:11] and uh i happened to see that somewhere
[28:13] i was reading and
[28:15] i run across that and it said talking
[28:17] about a cheap imitation of the original
[28:20] and i thought you know that's a that's a
[28:22] pretty good title
[28:24] and
[28:28] so i'll just i had i
[28:32] wrote something thought about some
[28:33] things but
[28:35] you know brother brown was
[28:40] talking about god's word
[28:44] and you know god's word never changes
[28:45] it's the same it's
[28:47] you know god's god's will is god's word
[28:51] and whatever whatever he thought and
[28:53] that he spoke
[28:55] and you know it's not ever going to
[28:56] change
[28:58] everything else may change but god's
[29:00] word can't change god can't change his
[29:01] word
[29:03] and he can't die like he said
[29:06] and you know there in
[29:10] in the in the scripture brother brad
[29:13] says
[29:14] in the message the resurrection of
[29:16] lazarus he's
[29:17] he's speaking about the day of pentecost
[29:21] and you know he's talking about them
[29:22] going to the upper room and
[29:24] and tarrying and you know he said you
[29:27] wait
[29:27] until you're in dude with power from on
[29:29] high well he didn't tell him how long
[29:31] they were going to wait he just told
[29:32] them until
[29:34] he said you stay there and that was that
[29:36] was the promise that was made he said
[29:37] you stay there
[29:39] and that's what he wanted them to do and
[29:41] you know
[29:42] you know in other places where he talks
[29:44] about you know people they were there
[29:45] it's like well we think we've got it we
[29:47] think we've got he's like no
[29:49] you know peter was like no we'll know
[29:51] when we receive it
[29:53] he said because you're going to receive
[29:54] it'll be it'll be an experience
[29:59] you know brother brown said one time
[30:04] in questions and answers somebody asked
[30:06] him he said
[30:07] does our children need to have an
[30:09] experience
[30:11] and and he said you know or them uh
[30:15] realizing the message them accepting the
[30:17] message is that the same
[30:18] and he said no you need to have an
[30:20] experience not just
[30:22] accepting the message not just knowing
[30:24] the message not receiving the message
[30:26] that's not the same thing as having an
[30:27] experience
[30:28] but you know he was talking about you
[30:29] know they received the word that jesus
[30:32] spoke to
[30:33] the disciples received that word and
[30:35] they went to the upper room but that
[30:36] still wasn't
[30:37] what still wasn't the experience that
[30:39] jesus told them to have
[30:40] that was not the undoing of the power
[30:43] and so they had to wait on that
[30:44] and you know when they were when they
[30:45] received that power then
[30:47] then they they staggered around like
[30:50] drunk people
[30:51] you know they they acted weird and
[30:52] everybody was like you know these people
[30:54] are full of new wine
[30:56] you know they didn't understand what was
[30:58] going on but you know he said peter
[30:59] being a soapbox preacher stood up and
[31:01] said
[31:02] this these people aren't drunk like you
[31:04] think they are
[31:05] he said they're not drunk as you suppose
[31:07] seeing that's just the
[31:09] third hour of the day but he said this
[31:10] is that that was spoken of by the
[31:12] prophet joel
[31:14] and he said you know he said peter was
[31:16] being a soapbox preacher and he got up
[31:18] and he began to speak to him
[31:23] he said he preached brethren said he
[31:24] said preach such a sermon till he shook
[31:26] the stalagtites of hell down into the
[31:28] devil's eyes
[31:30] that's right he said they seen all this
[31:33] he said this was
[31:34] what was prophesied to be and they said
[31:37] what can we do to be saved he said
[31:38] repent
[31:39] every one of you and be baptized in the
[31:41] name of jesus christ for the remission
[31:43] of sins and you shall receive the gift
[31:44] of the holy ghost
[31:46] he said what is it he said it's the same
[31:48] promise
[31:50] the same manner that fell on them to
[31:52] give them eternal life like the manna
[31:54] that
[31:54] carried the children of israel through
[31:56] the wilderness the same baptism of the
[31:58] holy ghost carries the church through
[32:00] to glory and every man as the priest was
[32:03] then
[32:03] the middle wall partitions torn down
[32:06] every man
[32:06] that'll come to god and believe that he
[32:08] is and a rewarder of those
[32:10] who seek him and give up their sins and
[32:13] throw their arms open to god can have
[32:16] not something that looks like
[32:19] some imitation of it
[32:22] but a genuine heart full of the real
[32:24] baptism of the holy ghost
[32:26] like fell on the day of pentecost make
[32:29] the same signs
[32:30] wonders and everything else take place
[32:32] hallelujah
[32:33] you know that's right may you act the
[32:36] same make you act the same way like a
[32:38] drunk man carry on just like
[32:39] they did on the day of pentecost every
[32:43] believer has a right to receive it
[32:45] just like every priest coming into the
[32:47] priesthood
[32:48] could get the manna hallelujah my wish i
[32:51] was twice my size i'd make twice as much
[32:54] noise maybe
[32:57] and i know how that i know how that is
[33:00] sometimes you know you get into it and
[33:02] you do wish she was a little bit bigger
[33:04] taller
[33:05] louder but the same
[33:09] but it was the same thing it was the
[33:10] same promise the promise didn't change
[33:14] god god never you know because god made
[33:17] the promise to everybody
[33:19] he didn't take the promise away from
[33:21] anybody
[33:23] the problem is is people don't accept
[33:25] the promise they don't accept it
[33:28] it wasn't that god made it and allowed
[33:30] people
[33:31] to receive it the problem is is whether
[33:34] you receive it or not
[33:36] you know there's sometimes people get
[33:38] confused on on the thought you know
[33:40] when when god spoke to cain when god
[33:43] spoke to cain and told him
[33:45] that that you know he he saw he saw
[33:48] cain's sacrifice and he rejected it but
[33:51] he told
[33:52] cain he gave cain the way to to follow
[33:55] he gave him the way to to righteousness
[34:00] the rule he said he said if you will do
[34:02] as your as your brother
[34:05] you know he didn't even have to have
[34:06] faith to believe in that he just had
[34:08] he just had to act on what god told him
[34:11] to do
[34:12] what he saw abel do abel had a
[34:14] revelation that it was blood
[34:16] and he offered sacrifice cain didn't
[34:19] have that but god told him
[34:20] didn't even have to have revelation that
[34:22] it was the blood but all he had to do
[34:24] was he had to have obedience and if he
[34:27] could have had obedience he would have
[34:28] been accepted
[34:31] and you know the thing is is people say
[34:33] and if you don't see it that way and i
[34:35] am you know
[34:35] because if you don't see that it was god
[34:38] made a way then you know what if if god
[34:40] did not would not accept cain if cain
[34:43] had offered the blood
[34:44] had offered a blood sacrifice if god
[34:46] hadn't accepted cain
[34:47] then god's a liar because he would have
[34:51] been a liar if he hadn't done it
[34:54] but you know the thing is it wasn't what
[34:56] god said is what cain done
[34:59] god made the way for him but cain didn't
[35:01] accept it
[35:02] gang didn't follow through with it
[35:05] as many times as as you know brother
[35:07] brown talked about how many times
[35:09] has he talked about we seen you know he
[35:11] knew what people was going to do
[35:12] because he he had before knowledge he
[35:14] knew what was going to take place he
[35:16] knew other people would accept it or not
[35:17] but you know he could have waited a
[35:19] million years
[35:20] a billion years and people still
[35:21] wouldn't have believed it they still
[35:22] wouldn't accepted it
[35:23] because he knew what was going to take
[35:25] place but you know what it wasn't that
[35:28] he did not make a way for them
[35:30] so that when one day when it comes to
[35:32] the great throne when do i have to stand
[35:34] before god and give an answer
[35:36] you know what it ain't going to be that
[35:37] they're pointing their finger at god and
[35:38] saying you've done me different
[35:40] you treated me wrong no the thing is is
[35:42] it's going to ring in their ears it's
[35:43] going to run through their mind exactly
[35:45] what god done for them well god spoke to
[35:47] them
[35:47] where god crossed their path and they
[35:49] turned him down
[35:57] god's not a respecter of persons
[36:02] he's made a way for everybody the
[36:06] scripture tells us
[36:07] that he said he said that god was not
[36:09] willing
[36:10] that any should perish he said but that
[36:13] all might come to repentance
[36:17] well if he did not make a way because
[36:19] john 3 says that he
[36:20] so loved the world that he sent his only
[36:23] begotten son
[36:25] he said to whosoever and brother branham
[36:26] said he said it doesn't it doesn't put
[36:28] anybody's name in there he said the
[36:30] scripture doesn't say ormond neville or
[36:32] william branham or anything like that
[36:33] but he said whosoever will
[36:36] he said if you you will believe what he
[36:38] said it's whosoever that it's to
[36:40] you but you've got to believe it's to
[36:42] you
[36:43] he didn't take it away from anybody
[36:50] see that's what that's what makes it
[36:52] makes it so great is because
[36:53] he's he spread it out to everybody and
[36:55] it's up to you whether you accept it or
[36:57] not
[36:59] it's up to me whether i accept it god's
[37:02] made a way god's made a provision
[37:09] he's taking care of all things all the
[37:11] way through
[37:13] as as we'll look here maybe later
[37:17] brother i'm
[37:17] talking about understanding our journey
[37:20] and
[37:21] what god's done for us and he's made a
[37:24] way
[37:25] he knew what was going to take place
[37:28] even before we did
[37:29] he knew what was what was coming our way
[37:34] but he's made a way
[37:44] sure people don't see that
[37:51] you know because many times as
[37:54] you know it it's as close as as satan
[37:57] said he said i'm going to be like the
[38:00] most high
[38:02] he said i'm going to exalt myself you
[38:04] know
[38:05] you know he said that he said it would
[38:07] be so close in the end time
[38:09] he said it would disease deceive the
[38:11] very elective possible
[38:18] but you know the same one that offered
[38:20] it
[38:23] you know if if if he made a way if he
[38:26] offered shed his blood
[38:30] and made a way back tore down that
[38:33] middle
[38:34] wall of partition there if he's made if
[38:36] he's
[38:37] gapped at the cab the great chasm
[38:41] then you know that if if he's made a way
[38:44] then you know what
[38:45] you cannot be deceived
[38:50] if he's if he's made a way
[38:53] sure the satan's going to attack that's
[38:55] his job that's his goal
[38:58] but you know what as we sang that song
[39:01] earlier greater is he that's in
[39:02] us than he that's in the world you know
[39:06] you might get confused you might you
[39:08] might lose your way but you know what
[39:10] if you're one of his you're not going to
[39:12] be you're not going to be lost
[39:14] he's not going to lose a single one of
[39:16] you
[39:20] many times we don't follow the way we
[39:22] ought to go
[39:24] but that don't mean he's not there
[39:30] this is from the message the oddball
[39:32] brother branham says
[39:35] he says i can imagine the very first
[39:37] church what they were
[39:39] and compare it with his reproduction
[39:41] today
[39:43] and compare it with this reproduction
[39:44] today he said this would be a cheap
[39:47] production of what the real church was
[39:49] that
[39:50] rugged believers in god with the holy
[39:54] ghost you babied not them
[39:57] you didn't have to pat them and tell
[39:59] them you'd take them
[40:01] in this one and be tired of that one
[40:02] good they go to another one
[40:05] you'll make them a deacon if they'll
[40:06] come here leave this over there
[40:09] he said that's a hybrid reproduction
[40:14] and this is this is where i where i got
[40:16] my
[40:18] where i got my thought from red ram says
[40:20] i was thinking of michelangelo's
[40:22] original painting i believe of the last
[40:23] supper
[40:24] i think he painted it
[40:29] do you realize what that original
[40:31] picture would cost you it would be
[40:33] countless thousands
[40:36] the dollars would never touch that
[40:38] original because it's beyond price it's
[40:40] so valued so high but you can buy a
[40:44] cheap reproduction of it
[40:46] for about two dollars that's why people
[40:50] today can't understand the ruggedness of
[40:52] real genuine believers
[40:54] they become a nut you know the world
[40:57] gets in such a rut till
[40:59] every once in a while you have to have a
[41:01] nut to straighten it out
[41:03] take somebody come on the scene that's a
[41:05] little different
[41:06] and he is a nut to that generation i was
[41:08] thinking about
[41:09] that the other day who was able who
[41:11] today is an
[41:12] is not a nut you're somebody's nut i
[41:16] believe the world is completely going
[41:17] insane
[41:19] you know it's a time that people can't
[41:21] judge between right
[41:22] wrong or truth or error
[41:28] that's where i got you know i was
[41:30] reading about where i saw that
[41:32] and it said a cheap imitation of the
[41:34] original
[41:36] but you know brother brown was speaking
[41:37] in the uh in the oddball and he was
[41:38] talking about
[41:39] he said you can get you can get a cheap
[41:41] reproduction of something
[41:46] and you know you know because
[41:51] the he said he said it was a hybrid
[41:53] reproduction
[41:55] and you know when we look at something
[41:58] because if you look at what
[42:00] the way god does things and the way man
[42:03] does
[42:03] things you know because
[42:07] there's there's a slight variation
[42:09] because you know you can
[42:10] you can reproduce something and people
[42:13] and people make
[42:14] and they call them replicas
[42:17] but you know what it never has the value
[42:20] that the original has
[42:22] you could you can make and and you know
[42:24] people you know
[42:25] you know there's there's different
[42:26] terminologies that we can talk about
[42:28] you know counterfeit is something that
[42:30] we make but you try to pass that off
[42:32] as the original you try to pass that off
[42:36] but a replica you know that's a replica
[42:39] you know what you've got
[42:42] but a replica is something that usually
[42:46] when you look at the word
[42:47] replica it's something that they use and
[42:49] they take
[42:50] very high in products and they try to
[42:52] make it really nice
[42:54] and it's not just some cheap made thing
[42:56] but it's a
[42:57] replica because it is supposed to um
[43:01] stand in for the the original
[43:04] so it's supposed to be a replica so that
[43:06] when you look at it
[43:08] it's not uh you know many times when
[43:11] they talk about making jewelry
[43:12] you know because they have original
[43:14] jewelry that's you know worth millions
[43:15] of dollars well they don't want
[43:17] they don't want those being out too far
[43:19] and you know where people can
[43:21] steal them and everything like that so
[43:22] they use uh they have people that
[43:24] they can make very what you know like
[43:26] costume jewelry and they can
[43:27] and they and it's worth lots of money
[43:30] and they are
[43:31] very well talented at their jobs and
[43:33] they they can do a lot of things
[43:34] to make it rep to replicate the original
[43:39] but it's still not the original right
[43:41] and they can have many of the
[43:43] the very small fine details that are in
[43:46] the original but it's still not the
[43:48] original
[43:49] and it's worth a lot of money but you
[43:53] know
[43:53] you can have something and many many
[43:54] times when they talk about making a
[43:56] reproduction of something
[43:57] well many times when you make a
[43:58] reproduction of something you know
[44:00] sometimes a reproduction is something
[44:02] that kind of looks psychic
[44:03] right but you know you can you when you
[44:06] start to look at it you look at the
[44:07] details it doesn't have the same details
[44:09] as the original does not like in a
[44:12] replica sometimes when they make
[44:13] replicas replicas you know they have
[44:15] they they even look if when they look at
[44:17] a a piece of furniture or anything like
[44:19] that
[44:19] they actually know the grain the details
[44:21] of the grain
[44:22] that they match those things up or they
[44:24] they they see the slightest little
[44:26] um in paintings where they where they
[44:28] where they add just a little touch of
[44:30] of paint where it swoops out this way or
[44:32] or this way or they have a certain line
[44:34] you know they try to match that
[44:36] identical
[44:37] when a reproduction it may not have that
[44:40] the colors may match but it doesn't have
[44:42] those same fine details
[44:44] but you know it's still not the original
[44:46] and all that that you do
[44:48] you know it so it's it's not that you
[44:50] know when you when you talk about making
[44:52] a
[44:52] a reproduction well when god makes a
[44:55] reaper when god reproduces his self
[44:57] when he when he takes his life and he
[45:00] and he adds it to someone else and he
[45:01] gives somebody else his life
[45:03] when he reproduces himself you know what
[45:05] there isn't any
[45:06] difference so there isn't
[45:10] you know as as so when we look at these
[45:12] things when we talk about
[45:14] reproductions yeah when there's a hybrid
[45:17] why because
[45:18] there there is a difference between what
[45:20] man reproduces
[45:22] because you know what it's not god it's
[45:25] not man's job to reproduce what god
[45:27] it's god doing his reproducing so it's
[45:30] god doing that not man trying to
[45:32] reproduce it
[45:33] you know because man cannot do what god
[45:36] done
[45:38] because he is the original so you can't
[45:40] you can't take what he's done
[45:42] and reproduce it and you may and you may
[45:46] make a fine uh fine reproduction
[45:49] reproduction of it
[45:50] a fine replica of it but it'll never be
[45:52] the same
[46:00] is from the message
[46:03] the mighty god unveiled he said could
[46:05] you compare chris
[46:06] christianity with christianity today
[46:09] with what it is then
[46:11] could you imagine this group that what
[46:12] we call christians today around
[46:14] across the world being like those was
[46:17] after pentecost
[46:18] babied and padded and from one church to
[46:21] another and say something
[46:23] you don't like get up and walk out could
[46:25] you imagine that no
[46:27] what is the matter it's a reproduction
[46:30] michelangelo that created the monument
[46:33] of moses
[46:34] you could get a reproduction of that
[46:36] very cheap but the original
[46:38] the one who painted the lord's supper i
[46:40] guess the original painting would run
[46:42] into millions of dollars
[46:43] if you could even buy it i don't even
[46:46] know where it's at
[46:47] but you can buy a cheap reproduction of
[46:49] it for about a dollar 98 cents
[46:54] and he said and that's the way it is
[46:56] today
[46:57] a cheap christian a reproduction just a
[47:00] church joiner
[47:01] you can buy them out for a cigarette or
[47:04] for a common drink
[47:06] or for a woman with cut hair or painted
[47:08] lips you can buy her for
[47:10] anything in the fashions of the world he
[47:12] said but you can't touch that genuine
[47:14] i see him in phil in full view the same
[47:18] yesterday today and forever
[47:20] oh christian don't you want to be a real
[47:22] christian if there you know he says
[47:24] raise your hand if you want to be one
[47:27] not just to be not just to be a
[47:29] reproduction
[47:32] not not something made over but you want
[47:34] to be a real genuine christian
[47:36] why because you want him to make you not
[47:38] not just be uh
[47:40] try to try to live a life try to
[47:42] reproduce that life but that's not what
[47:44] it is but it's to live the life
[47:46] but it's no longer as paul said it's no
[47:48] longer i that lives now he said but it's
[47:50] christ that lives in me
[47:52] it's him living the life not me trying
[47:54] to live in the la trying to live the
[47:56] life
[48:03] from the message believe us thou this
[48:05] brother brahman says
[48:06] he said that's what's the matter with
[48:08] the world today man
[48:10] people stuck up and starchy god will
[48:12] have to pour out the holy ghost
[48:15] and wilt that thing down in you
[48:18] everyone of us we're just exactly on the
[48:22] same level
[48:23] god made us all out of one pattern
[48:28] no matter if you live in a better
[48:30] neighborhood go to a better church
[48:31] there's nothing
[48:32] but what has god what god has made you
[48:38] what has god's made you and you
[48:42] and who are you to glory
[48:45] glory comes to god
[48:49] and brother brown was speaking
[48:52] here in his message he was speaking
[48:55] about being in the uh
[48:57] the coliseum there or the museum i
[48:59] believe was and he was
[49:01] talking about them uh looking at what a
[49:04] human body was worth
[49:05] when you broke it down into all the
[49:07] elements and what it was worth and those
[49:08] men were standing there
[49:09] and they were looking at it and you know
[49:12] and then the man's
[49:13] the one fella it says them couple of
[49:16] boys standing there in one look said
[49:17] well john
[49:18] we're not worth very much are we
[49:22] because when they seen it i think he was
[49:23] like 84 cents or whatever
[49:25] whatever it was that that brother and
[49:27] said and he said he said look
[49:28] fella he said that's your body
[49:31] but he said you got a soul that's worth
[49:33] ten thousand you scroll up
[49:39] let me see them i think you can scroll
[49:41] up some more leave us
[49:42] all this
[49:48] well
[49:53] i think we missed it it's 45
[49:56] scroll ups let's see
[49:59] there it is he said that's your body but
[50:03] you got a soul that's worth ten thousand
[50:04] worlds that's right he said that body
[50:06] will go back to the dust
[50:08] some of these days but you got a soul
[50:09] that will live forever
[50:11] take care of that he said look at the
[50:13] value that jesus christ put on it to
[50:15] come from glory to die to redeem you
[50:17] that's the trouble we look at the
[50:19] outside and take care of the outside
[50:21] but the inside we let it go yes sir
[50:25] and then he goes on talking about mary
[50:27] and martha and the different ones
[50:30] but you know
[50:35] do we see the vague
[50:42] that that soul being worth ten thousand
[50:45] worlds sin
[50:46] seeing the value that god placed on it
[50:49] not just not just on the flesh you know
[50:51] brother i said
[50:52] many times people would take you know
[50:55] put a hundred dollar dress on 84 cents
[50:58] or
[50:59] you know walk around with their nose up
[51:02] in the air said if it
[51:03] you know if it rained they'd drown but
[51:06] you know
[51:06] here they are they they missed to see
[51:08] what what was the real value was it
[51:10] that god saw your soul
[51:14] and you know god god came to died
[51:17] to redeem you
[51:21] and you know he and as i said he made a
[51:24] way for everybody he's
[51:25] he's opened that up for everybody nobody
[51:28] but see the thing is is you've got to
[51:30] accept that it's it's not
[51:31] god going to force you god god's not
[51:33] going to override your free moral agency
[51:35] it's up to you whether you're going to
[51:37] accept it or not
[51:38] because you you have to make that
[51:40] decision god's not going to make that
[51:41] decision for you
[51:50] brother brown was speaking you know
[51:53] there's
[51:53] many that that have come and you know
[51:56] they had a
[51:57] god made a wife but the question is is
[52:01] are they going to accept what god
[52:04] give to him he was speaking of
[52:08] fanny crosby one time and he was
[52:10] speaking of of her and
[52:12] you know she had she had the ability to
[52:15] make a lot of money
[52:21] you know you know brother ram talks
[52:23] about her
[52:25] having you know she could have made a
[52:26] lot of money but you know she
[52:28] decided you know they wanted her to
[52:30] write songs because she was
[52:31] she had such a talent she could have
[52:32] made lots of money and you know
[52:34] they wanted her to to do all these
[52:37] things but you know she
[52:38] she said no nothing of the world
[52:41] and she said she's that all that god has
[52:43] given me he said all my talent she said
[52:45] is for him
[52:47] and you know they went and they were
[52:49] asking her about you know all these
[52:50] different things you know they got so
[52:52] upset with her but
[52:53] you know he said you know they kind of
[52:56] got peeved at her because
[52:58] she turned down such an opportunity he
[53:00] said she didn't sell her birthrights out
[53:02] like mr presley and them did
[53:04] said she maintained her integrity you
[53:07] know
[53:07] talking about elvis selling
[53:10] selling out as a judas for you know a
[53:13] fleet of cadillacs and
[53:14] a million dollars and a bunch of gold
[53:17] records and all those things and
[53:19] you know what what can you say about all
[53:21] that in in the end time you know
[53:23] as brother branham said you know one of
[53:25] these days you know he will be all shook
[53:27] up when
[53:27] when when he has to stand before the
[53:29] judgment you know
[53:30] and and all these things you know what
[53:32] what has it done for you
[53:34] i mean where does it where does it carry
[53:36] you you know when you look at something
[53:38] and you talk about
[53:39] something being cheap
[53:42] you know do you put value on something
[53:45] you know god saw a lot of value in you
[53:47] that he would go wherever you were
[53:49] that that he would become he would
[53:50] become like us
[53:53] he took on sin that we
[53:57] that we might become the righteousness
[53:59] of god he knew where you were
[54:01] at he knew what we were
[54:04] how we were lost and undone there was no
[54:06] nothing good in us
[54:08] but he but he came and became us that we
[54:10] might become
[54:11] him that we can become the righteousness
[54:14] of god
[54:16] do we see the value in that
[54:19] you know because if your soul is worth
[54:21] ten thousand worlds the bible says
[54:24] you know what what does it profit of man
[54:28] if he gains the whole world and loses
[54:29] his own soul
[54:31] or he said what will a man exchange for
[54:34] his soul
[54:36] you know you know what what struck me is
[54:38] is when you when you think of that
[54:40] if i gain the whole world tonight
[54:44] if god values my soul at ten thousand
[54:46] worlds and i only gain
[54:48] one what about the other nine thousand
[54:51] 9999
[54:55] if you want to talk about cheap i think
[54:56] that exchange rate's pretty cheap
[55:02] i would i would swap a dollar with for
[55:04] ten thousand dollars with anybody any
[55:05] day of the week
[55:10] i think it's pretty cheap but that's
[55:11] what people but you know people don't
[55:12] see the value that god's season
[55:20] he's speaking of brother speaking of a
[55:23] fanny crosby and he was talking about
[55:24] you know he said he said the worst kind
[55:25] of blindness
[55:26] is is not physical blindness he said
[55:29] it's spiritual blindness
[55:31] you know he said because you know fanny
[55:33] might have been physically blind but she
[55:35] wasn't spiritually blind
[55:38] you know and i i
[55:42] always i always loved this this quote
[55:44] you know
[55:58] he said there's a blindness that's worse
[55:59] than physical blindness
[56:01] and that spiritual blindness he said i
[56:04] feel more sorry for them
[56:05] than i do for the physically blind
[56:09] so why wouldn't our hearts reach out for
[56:11] them
[56:12] instead of condemning them let's love
[56:14] them
[56:16] then they'll see light if you'll just
[56:19] love them
[56:20] the worlds are dying not for a better
[56:23] economics
[56:24] the church is dying not for better
[56:26] buildings a bigger denomination but it's
[56:28] dying for somebody to reach out
[56:30] a hand of love to show that we care one
[56:32] for the other
[56:33] he said that's the very sign that jesus
[56:35] told us that by this all men would know
[56:38] that you were my disciples when we got
[56:41] love one for the other
[56:45] he said i was thinking of blind he said
[56:48] it's a little off my subject but
[56:50] not off either he said there was a
[56:53] there was blind family crosby she could
[56:55] see better than a lot of people got two
[56:57] good eyes
[56:59] they tried to get her one time to write
[57:01] music or poetry for the dance world for
[57:03] the entertainment world
[57:04] and she refused to do it so they were
[57:08] making fun of her
[57:11] i thought what a difference it is
[57:12] between her and a certain young
[57:14] pentecostal boy
[57:15] who set the world of fire with rock and
[57:17] roll
[57:19] i've often thought that he's worse than
[57:22] judas
[57:24] judas esau sold his birthright and what
[57:27] a horrible thing that young man
[57:28] will have to answer for at the day of
[57:30] judgment sent more souls to hell than
[57:32] all the bootleg joints there is in the
[57:34] country right
[57:36] but then when fan crossed one day when
[57:39] they come to her with these big
[57:41] bargains she was poor too they come to
[57:43] her and said we'll give you so much if
[57:45] you'll just give your
[57:46] talent over to making songs for the
[57:48] entertainment world
[57:49] she flatly refused it she wouldn't do it
[57:53] i said if there's anything that i have
[57:54] that belongs to christ
[57:57] so those young men were talking to her
[57:59] and i was supposed they're expecting
[58:01] then i i suppose that you're expecting
[58:04] to go to a world where there's
[58:05] everlasting life and so forth she said
[58:07] yes he said what do you expect this
[58:09] christ to be
[58:12] he said he'll be a man
[58:15] so then if you're the same over there
[58:17] that you are here you've never seen him
[58:19] said you're blind
[58:20] so i don't know him anyhow
[58:24] they said how would you ever know him if
[58:26] you're still blind over there and you've
[58:28] never had sight in this life and on the
[58:31] other side
[58:31] there is no sight there how would you
[58:34] ever know him then she said i'll know
[58:36] him
[58:36] and laughed at her and she she turned
[58:38] and started back through the house when
[58:39] she
[58:40] made her decision no sir nothing of the
[58:42] world
[58:43] all my talent is given to christ and
[58:46] they said she started back
[58:48] across the house and raised their hands
[58:49] and she said
[58:51] i shall know him i shall know him and
[58:54] redeem by his side i shall stand
[58:56] i shall know him i shall know him
[59:00] by the prince of the nails in his hands
[59:03] said it's those great crucial moments
[59:06] that the strain is put upon us that god
[59:08] moves in when we make the decision for
[59:11] him
[59:11] that's between life and death that
[59:13] little sharp edge
[59:14] sometime at the last moment when you
[59:16] think you're not going to be well
[59:18] somebody's making fun of you you still
[59:19] hold your testimony
[59:21] that's that's the time that god moves in
[59:28] one amazing thing
[59:32] hold on to your testimony
[59:36] all my talent
[59:40] all the things that that people could
[59:44] receive in this life
[59:47] it's not use for god it doesn't count
[59:57] we can give the world our our best we
[59:59] can give our jobs our best
[1:00:05] but do we give god our best
[1:00:14] that's what counts
[1:00:22] because you know what he gave his all
[1:00:23] for us
[1:00:30] didn't hold back one thing from us
[1:00:37] the scripture tells us then
[1:00:40] he'll not withhold one good thing from
[1:00:43] those that walk uprightly
[1:00:48] you know brother brown said that
[1:00:52] god wrote a had a checkbook
[1:00:57] and you know he sat down the day of
[1:01:00] calvary you know he started signing all
[1:01:02] those checks
[1:01:05] all those bank drafts of heaven were
[1:01:08] signed
[1:01:10] and you know if if he was here tonight
[1:01:12] he couldn't give you
[1:01:13] anything he couldn't heal you why
[1:01:16] because it's already done
[1:01:20] you know he was sitting there and he was
[1:01:20] talking about you know all of those all
[1:01:23] of those
[1:01:26] all of those checks are there the
[1:01:29] question is will you accept them
[1:01:32] you know one of my favorite one of my
[1:01:33] favorite quotes and
[1:01:36] most of you know it but i still love it
[1:01:39] every time i see it and
[1:01:40] you know that lady
[1:01:44] she was poor and didn't have anything
[1:01:47] and you know
[1:01:48] charity was trying to help her and they
[1:01:50] were trying to find out why she was in
[1:01:52] such a condition that she was in
[1:01:53] and they started investigating where she
[1:01:56] was at she had a son that was overseas
[1:01:59] it's like you know it's like if you had
[1:02:01] a son and he loved you you know he'd be
[1:02:03] trying to take care of you said do you
[1:02:04] hear from me oh yeah i hear from him all
[1:02:06] the time
[1:02:06] and he sends me all these sweet pictures
[1:02:08] and and these letters and
[1:02:10] and and you know i i hear from him all
[1:02:12] the time and and it's like oh he sends
[1:02:14] you
[1:02:14] sweet letters oh some of the sweetest
[1:02:16] letters that have ever been written
[1:02:20] he sends them to me and says said where
[1:02:22] are they can we see them said sure
[1:02:24] and so she goes over and picks up her
[1:02:26] bible and she opens up her bible and
[1:02:28] it's full of these
[1:02:29] of these pictures beautiful pictures
[1:02:31] they're laid right there in the
[1:02:32] scripture
[1:02:34] and here it was as they laid there and
[1:02:36] then they began to look at them and said
[1:02:37] what were they
[1:02:38] they were bank drafts she had thousands
[1:02:41] of dollars that her son
[1:02:42] had sent her but she didn't even know
[1:02:43] what they were she just saw pictures
[1:02:46] but she didn't realize that though once
[1:02:47] she had nato laid right there in her
[1:02:49] bible
[1:02:49] but somebody had to come by and show her
[1:02:51] what laid in the scripture
[1:02:53] was exactly what she had need of and
[1:02:55] there it was when somebody began to
[1:02:57] point to the scripture and show her what
[1:02:58] laid there that's exactly what she had
[1:03:00] need of
[1:03:04] and brother brother said send you and
[1:03:06] you can't get warm
[1:03:07] by a painted fire of pentecost
[1:03:11] it's not just a pretty picture god sent
[1:03:14] you that
[1:03:14] he sent you the the truth he sent you
[1:03:18] to let you know he said he said that he
[1:03:20] said
[1:03:23] he said it's unto you and to your
[1:03:26] children
[1:03:27] and to them that's a far off even as
[1:03:29] many as the lord our god shall call
[1:03:32] he said that's a bank draft of heaven he
[1:03:34] said don't don't be afraid to cash it
[1:03:44] don't be afraid to cash it
[1:03:51] when you see what god's done for you
[1:03:58] gave us his best
[1:04:05] you know if we if we receive god's best
[1:04:09] then you know
[1:04:12] we ought to we ought to accept it and
[1:04:13] walk in the fullness that god has given
[1:04:15] us
[1:04:20] not just to come along and
[1:04:24] be haphazard about it
[1:04:49] speaking here and
[1:04:55] questions and answers on hebrews
[1:04:59] speaking of our body he said you have to
[1:05:01] have a certain
[1:05:02] percent of light to make a shadow he
[1:05:04] said that's the way it is
[1:05:06] in here he said we both we are both
[1:05:08] natural and supernatural this body is
[1:05:10] subject to death and was brought
[1:05:11] forth by a woman not by nothing but
[1:05:15] but through not by god you're a
[1:05:17] reproduction from adam and eve
[1:05:19] be black white whatever you are you're a
[1:05:21] production an offspring
[1:05:23] from adam and eve that makes your body
[1:05:25] born in sin shaped and iniquity come to
[1:05:27] the world speaking lies
[1:05:32] you're damned and condemned at the
[1:05:34] beginning of your life not even without
[1:05:36] a chance
[1:05:37] now because the spirit that you have
[1:05:39] come
[1:05:40] to you by nature and by nature coming
[1:05:42] from sexual intercourse
[1:05:43] desire by man woman producing an earthly
[1:05:45] child and let that child alone and don't
[1:05:48] teach him nothing right
[1:05:49] he'll go wrong don't teach him neither
[1:05:52] right no wrong he'll
[1:05:53] take wrong because it's his nature to do
[1:05:55] that
[1:05:59] he said watch a little baby not
[1:06:02] over higher than that just get some mad
[1:06:05] he'll ring his hands he'll turn red in
[1:06:07] the face hold his breath
[1:06:08] sure what is it it's his nature he got
[1:06:11] it from his pappy and his mammy
[1:06:13] won sure he had enough she had enough
[1:06:16] temper to fight a bus saw or his daddy
[1:06:18] if they didn't his grandfather
[1:06:20] grandmother did it's offspring
[1:06:22] he said it makes you you're born of this
[1:06:24] world you come here
[1:06:25] come by nature and your whole being is
[1:06:28] black
[1:06:29] and smutty and damned and cursed and
[1:06:31] going to hell that's right
[1:06:32] he said but when you're born again then
[1:06:34] the light of god shines down in that
[1:06:36] soul hallelujah
[1:06:37] then it's no more a dark valley but it's
[1:06:40] a valley with a shadow in it
[1:06:42] you may be veiled here with the flesh
[1:06:44] but with things
[1:06:45] known by faith but there's
[1:06:48] enough light in there and some that
[1:06:51] light and darkness has to separate
[1:06:53] and when the light shines darkness flees
[1:06:57] and when we go to be with christ in that
[1:06:59] body darkness and death vanishes
[1:07:01] and we burst out into perfect light
[1:07:03] glory to god there we are
[1:07:05] no more sickness no more dark mixed with
[1:07:07] it
[1:07:08] he said right now we have both sin
[1:07:10] sickness and joy we have health and
[1:07:12] strength but
[1:07:13] we have ins and outs and ups and downs
[1:07:15] joy and sorrow and so forth well it's
[1:07:17] just a shadow
[1:07:18] we got enough light to know that there's
[1:07:20] light there
[1:07:21] we're still in the body and flesh but
[1:07:24] someday this body is going
[1:07:25] to break someday the day's going to
[1:07:29] break
[1:07:29] that's when the death angel sets out to
[1:07:33] the foot of the bed that's when the
[1:07:35] doctor says it's all finished and this
[1:07:37] natural comes away from the supernatural
[1:07:39] and the light
[1:07:39] springs forth the light springs back to
[1:07:42] light
[1:07:43] and darkness goes back to darkness this
[1:07:45] when this mortal puts on immortality
[1:07:47] that's when
[1:07:48] this corruption puts on incorruption
[1:07:50] that's when this mortal puts on
[1:07:52] immortality and we become
[1:07:54] from a creature of time to a creature of
[1:07:56] eternity you cannot go out there with
[1:07:58] trolls or darkness you've got to have
[1:08:00] light in the darkness there you are
[1:08:02] that's the body you receive
[1:08:07] so we're born and darkness
[1:08:10] but you know we've got that light but
[1:08:12] you know the promise is that it's going
[1:08:14] to give way
[1:08:17] all this is going to give way to that
[1:08:19] light you know he said
[1:08:21] walking in the valley of the shadow of
[1:08:23] death
[1:08:24] he said thou art with me why because
[1:08:27] you've got to have light
[1:08:28] to create a shadow it may be darkness
[1:08:32] but you know what he's still there
[1:08:35] no matter where you're at he's there
[1:08:36] with you
[1:08:40] and we see a lot of darkness and you
[1:08:42] know that's what the devil wants us to
[1:08:44] see is a lot of darkness
[1:08:46] but you know the one thing is is you
[1:08:48] hold on to the light it may be faint but
[1:08:50] you hold on to that light because
[1:08:52] as you hold on to that light then you
[1:08:54] know what there's a coming of day where
[1:08:55] it's going to break
[1:08:59] there's a light coming there's a greater
[1:09:00] light we'll walk in the light
[1:09:03] as he is in the light why because he's
[1:09:05] going to lead you in
[1:09:06] into greater light
[1:09:16] and we see that as the day goes on
[1:09:20] and brother i'm speaking of of the light
[1:09:22] and as the light progresses and we see
[1:09:24] that the light shine in
[1:09:26] in in the east and now it's went to the
[1:09:28] west and you know
[1:09:29] now we're seeing the evening light here
[1:09:31] as the light has grown
[1:09:32] it's becoming our day that you know the
[1:09:34] greatest light is now with
[1:09:36] us and our day that you know the light
[1:09:38] that shine with in the
[1:09:39] in the other ages and you know he he
[1:09:41] spoke about the
[1:09:42] the light for our day and you know and
[1:09:45] you know what
[1:09:45] people get he was he was talking about a
[1:09:47] man that he uh
[1:09:48] was uh making fun of of people believing
[1:09:52] the scripture and he said you know how
[1:09:53] could he
[1:09:54] how could god do all the things that he
[1:09:55] done and and all the things that took
[1:09:57] place down through history and he said
[1:09:59] you know he just don't understand how
[1:10:02] that
[1:10:02] the seed had to go into the ground and
[1:10:05] the seed had to abide along
[1:10:06] but it had to reproduce that the life
[1:10:09] had to go and all that was it was the
[1:10:10] cycle of life that it had to go through
[1:10:12] that it had to go down and you know we
[1:10:15] see as as
[1:10:16] he he came and he he birthed those at
[1:10:18] the
[1:10:19] day of pentecost and when they came
[1:10:21] through every age had their life but you
[1:10:23] know they had to do what their what
[1:10:24] every age was called for and then you
[1:10:27] know and they said you know why
[1:10:28] why did god call why god called why
[1:10:31] because he anointed a people
[1:10:32] to go through the dark ages he he to go
[1:10:35] through those times of persecution
[1:10:37] and all of that and the death why
[1:10:39] because they had
[1:10:40] they had a great testimony for the
[1:10:42] things that they stood for and went
[1:10:44] through but you know
[1:10:44] all that had to play into into the plan
[1:10:47] of the plan of god
[1:10:48] for it to come through there and to be
[1:10:50] birthed and to come through the dark
[1:10:52] ages and
[1:10:53] and all the false doctrine and all those
[1:10:55] things but you know what he became
[1:10:57] but he began to promise that he was
[1:10:59] going to bring back and you know he
[1:11:00] prophesied and told him that he was
[1:11:02] coming back with light and you know when
[1:11:04] martin luther received the light of
[1:11:05] justification and wrote the 95 thesis
[1:11:08] and stood up there
[1:11:09] and said you know he said we don't
[1:11:10] believe in all of this because the just
[1:11:12] shall live by faith why because it was a
[1:11:14] great light that began to shine
[1:11:16] yeah it was yeah it was a lot of
[1:11:18] darkness and it was a lot of death but
[1:11:19] you know what it was still a great light
[1:11:21] that was shining one because those that
[1:11:23] saw it
[1:11:23] saw a great light and it began to stay
[1:11:26] it began to grow
[1:11:27] and then you know all the way many
[1:11:29] people didn't see that thing they you
[1:11:30] know they thought martin luther lost his
[1:11:32] mind
[1:11:32] you know he was a heretic and they
[1:11:34] wouldn't have anything to do with him
[1:11:35] but you know there was
[1:11:36] some that were predestinated to that and
[1:11:38] saw that great light
[1:11:39] and stood for it and walked walked in in
[1:11:42] the light that they had
[1:11:43] and they began to show and you know then
[1:11:45] there was other ones they began to see
[1:11:47] and you know wesley and the different
[1:11:48] ones that came along after that began to
[1:11:50] walk in the same light that god had
[1:11:52] given them and began to express
[1:11:54] the you know the light of the word as it
[1:11:55] began to open up to come back to the
[1:11:57] original
[1:11:58] and you know brothers and sisters and it
[1:12:00] came back to you and i that we've
[1:12:01] received the original
[1:12:04] all the way down through time yeah
[1:12:08] god winked at their ignorance
[1:12:11] why because they walked in all the light
[1:12:13] that they had but you know what it was a
[1:12:14] great light that was shining
[1:12:16] but you know god came to the place today
[1:12:19] you and i are the ones that are the
[1:12:21] recipients of the full word of god
[1:12:23] the way that we have the rest that we
[1:12:25] have received what
[1:12:26] and you know what all the way back
[1:12:28] through time you know
[1:12:30] wesley may not have seen what luther saw
[1:12:32] and didn't understand all the things
[1:12:34] that took place
[1:12:34] one because it wasn't for him but it was
[1:12:36] for him to pick up the light
[1:12:38] to pick up the scripture that god shined
[1:12:39] the light on for him and for him to walk
[1:12:41] out there
[1:12:42] and walk in the light of sanctification
[1:12:44] and to and to live a life
[1:12:46] that was above reproach to carried on
[1:12:50] and they began to carry on and you know
[1:12:52] you know they began those they began to
[1:12:53] look into the scripture
[1:12:55] and you know they as they began to see
[1:12:57] those things and they came
[1:12:58] and realizing god had something greater
[1:13:00] than what was already been given
[1:13:06] you know those being began to stand and
[1:13:08] and pray
[1:13:12] you know i i was reading a little little
[1:13:14] article thing that was uh
[1:13:16] about the welch revival and you know how
[1:13:18] the hell that uh
[1:13:19] the man was was named evan roberts
[1:13:22] and he began to to cry and pray you know
[1:13:25] because you know
[1:13:26] he did not feel satisfied where he was
[1:13:28] at
[1:13:30] and you know god had called him and you
[1:13:32] know he began to pray all the time and
[1:13:34] began to seek
[1:13:35] you know they had they had great
[1:13:36] churches they had great movements but
[1:13:38] you know
[1:13:38] he he wanted something more than what
[1:13:40] they had why because he was crying out
[1:13:43] because you know what there was more of
[1:13:44] god that was calling because there was
[1:13:46] something on the inside crying out
[1:13:48] one because there was more of god to
[1:13:49] respond to that and he began to cry out
[1:13:52] and you know that was the birth of the
[1:13:54] great welch revival that that there was
[1:13:55] somebody that was crying out
[1:13:57] that god had placed on somebody to cry
[1:13:59] out and receive god
[1:14:01] and god answered that call
[1:14:04] you know as they began to look into the
[1:14:06] scripture there was ones that began to
[1:14:08] begin to see you know we want to see
[1:14:10] greater things from god we wanted to
[1:14:12] have
[1:14:12] greater movements of god and you know
[1:14:14] people began to seek these things and
[1:14:16] and understand that that god had had
[1:14:19] planned
[1:14:20] from the day of pentecost you know to
[1:14:22] come back
[1:14:24] and daddy seymour knows you know they
[1:14:26] begin to crowd and they begin to see
[1:14:27] from the scripture
[1:14:28] you know another pouring out of the holy
[1:14:30] ghost and to see the things that god had
[1:14:33] done
[1:14:33] back in the day of pentecost could be
[1:14:35] reproduced again today
[1:14:39] and as they began to crowd and speak you
[1:14:41] know then all of a sudden you know the
[1:14:42] holy ghost began to fall and they began
[1:14:44] to speak with tongues and all these
[1:14:46] different things
[1:14:47] and you know it was a it was a movement
[1:14:48] of god that god started to move
[1:14:50] and and open up the word to the people
[1:14:52] and you know and then they began to see
[1:14:54] uh you know those that had left the
[1:14:56] trinitarian doctrine and became
[1:14:58] into you know understanding the true
[1:15:00] baptism and the different things as they
[1:15:01] came along
[1:15:02] and you know we are we are recipients of
[1:15:04] those that stood for the truth that god
[1:15:06] has
[1:15:06] blessed them and brought them all the
[1:15:08] way down through and you know brother
[1:15:09] brad would stood on
[1:15:10] and began to open these things up and
[1:15:12] see all these things and point us down
[1:15:14] through history to show
[1:15:15] where the where the word of god has been
[1:15:17] opened up and unveiled
[1:15:23] it's a wonderful thing to see that
[1:15:26] what god has done
[1:15:30] you know that god has
[1:15:34] because many people you know they they
[1:15:36] didn't see
[1:15:37] the opening of the word
[1:15:45] but when brother branham began to see
[1:15:46] all the way down through history that
[1:15:48] corn of wheat going into the ground
[1:15:51] and dying and being reproduced and
[1:15:54] bringing back
[1:15:56] it was the same life in a different
[1:15:59] stage but it was the same life that came
[1:16:01] through
[1:16:02] all the way down it's the same life
[1:16:05] today
[1:16:07] and to come back into the grain
[1:16:11] he said that's what it would be in the
[1:16:13] last days it would be the same
[1:16:20] this is from the message
[1:16:24] things that are to be
[1:16:27] he said you see the whole program the
[1:16:29] whole church is built upon divine
[1:16:31] revelation
[1:16:32] jesus said in matthew the 16th chapter
[1:16:34] he said flesh and blood has not revealed
[1:16:36] this to you but my father which is in
[1:16:37] heaven
[1:16:38] has revealed this to you he said what
[1:16:40] was it a revelation of who he was upon
[1:16:42] this rock
[1:16:43] i'll build my church and the gates of
[1:16:45] hell can't prevail against it see the
[1:16:47] revelation
[1:16:48] of jesus christ in this hour not what he
[1:16:51] was in another hour
[1:16:52] what he was now the bible expresses
[1:16:56] it's growing in the bible to the full
[1:16:58] stature
[1:16:59] therefore if the corn of wheat of christ
[1:17:02] had to fall in the ground so did the
[1:17:03] bride to have
[1:17:05] have to fall in the ground through the
[1:17:06] dark ages any grain that goes into the
[1:17:09] ground must die or it can't
[1:17:11] produce itself reproduce itself and the
[1:17:13] great church that he established on the
[1:17:15] day of pentecost by sending the
[1:17:17] sending of the holy ghost had to suffer
[1:17:19] martyrdom and go into the dirt into the
[1:17:22] age of
[1:17:22] the earth of the dark age and bring
[1:17:24] forth again in the days of luther and
[1:17:26] come on out
[1:17:27] to the full stature of the bride of
[1:17:28] jesus christ for this last day
[1:17:30] see there's no way therefore the bride
[1:17:33] in the rapture will come forth
[1:17:35] and there is all pre-planned by god all
[1:17:38] backed up
[1:17:39] from the beginning he knowed every man
[1:17:42] every place who would set
[1:17:44] all about it it's all pre-planned god
[1:17:46] knew it from
[1:17:48] knew it would be here and then when he
[1:17:50] made it all that way
[1:17:52] so that when we get there
[1:17:55] he's going to prepare a place for us and
[1:17:57] when we get there it's all prepared just
[1:18:00] like even this night is prepared like
[1:18:03] this
[1:18:03] hour is prepared yes his great
[1:18:05] foreknowledge tells him
[1:18:07] all these things by foreknowledge
[1:18:13] and so he continues on
[1:18:16] and he begins to speak about god being
[1:18:19] omniscient
[1:18:20] omnipresent and everything and he begins
[1:18:22] to speak about our natural birth being
[1:18:24] presented in the world and god knowing
[1:18:26] all about these things that would take
[1:18:28] place and you
[1:18:28] be coming to an adult and understanding
[1:18:30] the things that take place in this earth
[1:18:32] and brother brown and going up brother
[1:18:35] go up to 40. if you got it there you go
[1:18:39] he said and so it is with your spiritual
[1:18:41] birth you do things that you don't
[1:18:43] understand when you're a
[1:18:44] little baby come to the altar you give
[1:18:46] your life to christ you do such
[1:18:48] strange things you wonder why you did it
[1:18:51] but after a while when you mature as
[1:18:52] matured christians then you understand
[1:18:54] it see
[1:18:55] there's something picks up see you see
[1:18:58] why you had to do it your spiritual
[1:19:00] birth your natural birth
[1:19:01] types your spiritual how it is fitted to
[1:19:04] you in this life as you grew
[1:19:06] everything fitted right in because you
[1:19:08] were made for that wasn't it a strange
[1:19:10] thing the night that you staggered into
[1:19:12] the mission or the tent
[1:19:13] meeting or the little church somewhere
[1:19:15] on the corner and some
[1:19:16] something the preacher preached on a
[1:19:18] certain subject you just fell right
[1:19:20] at the altar see god knew that before
[1:19:22] the foundation of the world
[1:19:24] see it seems strange to you why you did
[1:19:27] it then but now you understand you knew
[1:19:29] what
[1:19:30] you knew what happened so it's fitting
[1:19:33] to you
[1:19:34] in this life and you will be also in the
[1:19:37] life that is to come
[1:19:41] this world and this life seems to
[1:19:44] advance
[1:19:44] as you mature everything seems to go
[1:19:47] right with you
[1:19:52] so we see these things
[1:19:56] as it went through all the way down
[1:19:58] through time all these things came to
[1:20:00] right
[1:20:01] to our day everything that we go through
[1:20:05] it is fitting and god knows what would
[1:20:08] take place
[1:20:09] what god what what would take place in
[1:20:11] our lives and god understands that god
[1:20:13] knew what was going to take place
[1:20:15] and all these things and you know we
[1:20:16] wonder why things happen the way they do
[1:20:18] but you know god has a plan in all of it
[1:20:20] a plan and a purpose and all of it and
[1:20:22] you know it's going to be for his honor
[1:20:24] and glory and as you
[1:20:25] as he said in the in our natural birth
[1:20:27] we see these things and we don't
[1:20:28] understand why things
[1:20:30] are as we mature we start to see and
[1:20:32] understand things well you know as you
[1:20:33] mature as a christian you begin to see
[1:20:35] these things
[1:20:36] and understand why things happen the way
[1:20:38] they do and the way things
[1:20:39] happen and and so we start to see these
[1:20:43] things and
[1:20:44] what god has done for us
[1:20:49] and so as we see
[1:20:54] it's a great thing that god has for us
[1:21:00] you know it's not it's not to be wrapped
[1:21:02] up in
[1:21:08] an imitation you know i don't want it to
[1:21:11] be just a reproduction
[1:21:14] i don't want just to be a replica of it
[1:21:17] but i want i want to
[1:21:18] i want to i want it to be a production
[1:21:21] of jesus christ
[1:21:23] as he was speaking of he said there
[1:21:24] would be in the last days he said it
[1:21:27] would come he said it would be
[1:21:28] a pred it would reproduce jesus christ
[1:21:35] he said all the way down through the
[1:21:36] time that he said he said that genuine
[1:21:38] seed would come again he said it would
[1:21:40] be sown he said
[1:21:41] and so it's not just a reproduction not
[1:21:43] not us trying to make ourselves into
[1:21:45] something but it's
[1:21:46] to allow him to make us that we would be
[1:21:49] the reproduction of jesus christ again
[1:21:51] in the world to see
[1:21:52] the world would see jesus christ again
[1:21:54] today
[1:21:56] being a son and a daughter of god
[1:22:00] that's uh that's our goal that's our
[1:22:01] desire lord mold us in your image lord
[1:22:04] mold us into what we need to be
[1:22:08] let's see you
[1:22:11] i want i wanted to be what he'd have me
[1:22:13] be
[1:22:17] i want i want to live the way that he
[1:22:19] wants me to live
[1:22:21] let's all stand this evening we'll have
[1:22:23] the musicians come
[1:22:29] you know god god saw value in us and it
[1:22:32] wasn't
[1:22:33] it wasn't some cheap
[1:22:38] and i don't want it i don't want to
[1:22:40] cheap in what he's done for me
[1:22:45] i don't want to be
[1:22:50] the world looks for a
[1:22:55] something easy and something simple
[1:23:02] you know the life that jesus christ
[1:23:04] lived it wasn't always simple
[1:23:06] it wasn't easy
[1:23:09] you know we all have to have our
[1:23:13] you know our garden of gethsemane times
[1:23:21] but you know there's many people they
[1:23:22] they want to they want to find the easy
[1:23:25] way out
[1:23:28] you know they said well i can
[1:23:34] you know i can do what i want to
[1:23:39] i don't have to go to church brother
[1:23:42] brown said you know they said i can i
[1:23:44] don't have to go to church i don't have
[1:23:45] to fail a ship
[1:23:47] i can i can be just as good and he said
[1:23:50] no you can't
[1:23:53] you know many people they you know they
[1:23:55] come and he's like
[1:23:56] well i just i just want to hear
[1:24:00] hear what the prophet has to say and i'm
[1:24:02] just going i'm just going to listen to
[1:24:04] the prophet
[1:24:07] you know and then you know they they
[1:24:09] want to
[1:24:10] throw off you know well i don't need a
[1:24:13] pastor
[1:24:15] i don't i don't need a five-fold
[1:24:16] ministry
[1:24:18] i'm just i'm just going to hear it from
[1:24:20] the prophet
[1:24:22] i'm just going i'm just because you know
[1:24:24] that's thus saith the lord
[1:24:28] and not realizing that what they've done
[1:24:33] is they is they've is they've taken
[1:24:36] themselves away from the grace of god
[1:24:42] you know
[1:24:46] as as that's the reason why i was
[1:24:47] reading that scripture brother brown
[1:24:49] said
[1:24:52] the quote there where he was talking
[1:24:53] about physical blindness
[1:24:56] and fanny crosby knew somebody spiritual
[1:24:58] blindness
[1:24:59] spiritual blindness is worse and he said
[1:25:02] to reach out
[1:25:03] to him and love him you know
[1:25:07] there's so many that you know you don't
[1:25:10] you don't know how what to say to them
[1:25:12] you just try to reach out and you think
[1:25:14] about people that you know
[1:25:15] they've got into this thing where you
[1:25:17] know i don't i i i get it myself you
[1:25:19] know
[1:25:20] no you can't god
[1:25:23] god placed in the body
[1:25:26] and you know if he placed in the body he
[1:25:29] placed a five-fold ministry in the body
[1:25:34] and if ephesians 4 was placed in the
[1:25:36] body
[1:25:37] was placed in the scripture then show me
[1:25:39] where he took ephesians 4 out
[1:25:47] because it has it has great value to me
[1:25:55] because if not then we like i said we
[1:25:58] could we can make it a cheap imitation
[1:26:05] and it and it's very it is very sad
[1:26:07] because you know many people have stand
[1:26:08] up today and you know
[1:26:09] they they say well you know we have we
[1:26:11] have a tape ministry and we have a
[1:26:12] fivefold ministry
[1:26:15] and you know what they're in and in the
[1:26:17] true fivefold ministry
[1:26:19] there ain't a single one of them that i
[1:26:20] know of that's going to stand in front
[1:26:22] and tell you you can't listen to tapes
[1:26:26] it's it's for you to listen to the tapes
[1:26:28] they encourage you to listen to the
[1:26:29] tapes you better be in the tapes you
[1:26:31] better be in the words you better be
[1:26:32] listening
[1:26:35] i mean i don't know anybody that say
[1:26:37] well you better not listen to this you
[1:26:38] better you know because if
[1:26:39] if somebody's trying to hold you back
[1:26:41] from from reading and getting into the
[1:26:43] words you know what that's not the
[1:26:44] fivefold ministry
[1:26:47] they're pointing you back to the word
[1:26:51] you know and and as brother said in the
[1:26:53] church age book he said he said there
[1:26:54] was a voice of many waters
[1:26:57] he said it was the voice and i didn't
[1:27:00] bring this quote but he said the voice
[1:27:02] of the ministers in each age
[1:27:08] and when you go back to look at he said
[1:27:10] the voice
[1:27:12] well there's only one voice well i'm not
[1:27:16] you know i i don't want to think that
[1:27:18] say that that i'm trying to speak
[1:27:19] speak in my own self because if i was
[1:27:23] going to do that
[1:27:23] i just sit down but it's
[1:27:27] but it's god speaking glory and if it
[1:27:30] and if it's him speaking he said it was
[1:27:32] the voice of the ministers
[1:27:34] plural ministers is plural
[1:27:37] the voice of the ministers in each age
[1:27:41] glory age being singular right
[1:27:46] he didn't say the voice of the ministers
[1:27:48] in the ages
[1:27:50] but he said the ministers in each age so
[1:27:53] there's more than one in each age
[1:27:57] so when he began to speak that he's
[1:27:59] bringing out there's a fivefold ministry
[1:28:01] for every age
[1:28:02] and there's a and so we're not we're not
[1:28:04] trying to do away with it
[1:28:09] and and so many people have have raised
[1:28:11] up and they're they are saying
[1:28:13] you know well it wasn't so from the
[1:28:15] beginning
[1:28:17] it wasn't so from the beginning well you
[1:28:18] know they tell you something you may
[1:28:20] tell you something that wasn't from
[1:28:21] so from the beginning a tape player
[1:28:27] a tape player never was so from the
[1:28:28] beginning
[1:28:31] let me tell you something else because
[1:28:33] everybody says well we
[1:28:35] have to listen to the voice of the
[1:28:36] prophet well let me tell you something
[1:28:37] else a prophet wasn't so from the
[1:28:39] beginning
[1:28:40] because if we go back brother bram said
[1:28:42] we're going back to eden condition
[1:28:44] god come and spoke to adam and eve
[1:28:47] they had fellowship face to face with
[1:28:49] each other that was so from the
[1:28:51] beginning
[1:28:54] let me tell you something else that
[1:28:56] wasn't so from the beginning close
[1:28:58] wasn't so from the beginning well if
[1:28:59] we're going to just start saying well
[1:29:00] that's so what
[1:29:01] so from the beginning went so from the
[1:29:02] beginning well there's a lot of things
[1:29:03] we need to cut out
[1:29:05] but you tell me if the five-fold
[1:29:07] minister you showed me where the
[1:29:08] five-fold ministry was taken out and
[1:29:10] i'll show you where it was put in
[1:29:11] you showed me where it was taken out but
[1:29:13] you showed me where god put a tape
[1:29:15] player in
[1:29:18] he called me and he didn't call a tape
[1:29:20] player
[1:29:23] but you know what each one every man
[1:29:24] that's been called of god has been
[1:29:26] called to stand
[1:29:27] and they proclaim the message that
[1:29:29] brother branham brought
[1:29:30] the fulfillment of revelation 10 7 came
[1:29:33] to voice
[1:29:34] and it began because revelation 10 8
[1:29:36] began to speak
[1:29:37] so there's somebody that's got to stand
[1:29:39] and speak not stood around and said
[1:29:41] listen to a tape player well i can't say
[1:29:43] nothing
[1:29:44] we just got to push play
[1:29:50] i'm i'm i'm sorry i just
[1:29:59] i'm sorry i'm not sorry
[1:30:02] i'm sorry for the fan jew but it
[1:30:05] it don't offend me it offended me that
[1:30:08] when people when people have
[1:30:09] have taken the word of god and what god
[1:30:12] has given us and
[1:30:13] they've and they've cheapened it oh yeah
[1:30:15] come on
[1:30:16] that's it and then and all you can do is
[1:30:20] all you can do is make an imitation of
[1:30:22] it because you know
[1:30:23] they they say well you know they've done
[1:30:26] away with they've done what so much
[1:30:30] well well it's so much easier we can
[1:30:31] just sit behind sit somewhere in our in
[1:30:34] our recliners and listen to brother
[1:30:35] branham and we don't have to have
[1:30:37] anybody call our sin out and point our
[1:30:38] fingers at us
[1:30:39] and tell us where we're wrong
[1:30:46] and they said well brother branham comes
[1:30:48] and corrects me
[1:30:49] [Music]
[1:30:56] well i know i know there's a lot of them
[1:30:59] that
[1:31:00] you see a lot of things that go on and
[1:31:01] you know what who's correct in that
[1:31:06] so but you know i i thank god
[1:31:09] that god has given us a fivefold
[1:31:11] ministry amen
[1:31:15] god has given us a pastor
[1:31:20] that has stood faithfully behind the
[1:31:22] desk and he's action
[1:31:36] well all i can i can say anybody else
[1:31:38] can say whatever they want to
[1:31:49] but brother branham said
[1:31:53] he said he gave you a pastor
[1:31:56] he said he's ordained a god to lead you
[1:31:58] through
[1:32:00] he said get behind your pastor
[1:32:24] so i want to be behind my pastor
[1:32:40] and i want to apologize to everybody
[1:32:42] here
[1:32:52] because you know what i don't want to
[1:32:53] cheapen any of this
[1:33:04] but i'm just going i'm just going ahead
[1:33:05] and see it i don't nobody won't have any
[1:33:08] surprises
[1:33:10] i'm just i'm just honest like it
[1:33:16] brother wade's words of exhortation and
[1:33:19] rebuke were mine
[1:33:22] anybody want to know who they belong to
[1:33:23] they belong to me
[1:33:29] and i'm not ashamed to say that
[1:33:33] because you know what the bible tells me
[1:33:35] that a bastard's the only one that won't
[1:33:37] stand correction
[1:33:47] and i apologize to brother wade and
[1:33:50] brother dale
[1:33:54] and i apologize to all of y'all
[1:33:59] because i don't i don't ever do anything
[1:34:02] to offend anybody
[1:34:05] the bible tells me that a brother
[1:34:07] offended is harder one than a strong
[1:34:09] city
[1:34:12] and you know anytime that there's
[1:34:14] anything that's ever done
[1:34:16] that stands between anybody in the body
[1:34:19] and that's where the devil can
[1:34:20] attack that's where the devil is going
[1:34:22] to stand and play
[1:34:27] and i want i want to be the one
[1:34:31] to be right
[1:34:36] and i and and i just i want to say this
[1:34:39] whether whether i preach again or not
[1:34:41] doesn't doesn't matter to me if brother
[1:34:43] dale set me down i would i wouldn't
[1:34:44] i wouldn't mind at all i'm not
[1:34:48] i'm you know because i'm not going to be
[1:34:49] one that's going to have a you know
[1:34:51] carry a chip on my shoulder or anything
[1:34:53] like that
[1:34:57] we're in such a late hour i don't you
[1:34:58] know if anything's done wrong
[1:35:00] it needs to be corrected and we all need
[1:35:02] to stand up and and take her and say
[1:35:03] thank the lord and just move on
[1:35:08] it needs to be put under the blood
[1:35:09] [Applause]
[1:35:12] and if anybody thinks that that you know
[1:35:15] that
[1:35:15] preachers are any better than anybody
[1:35:17] else well you're dead wrong
[1:35:28] because i don't want i don't want to be
[1:35:29] just an imitation
[1:35:33] i want to be the genuine
[1:35:48] i know where the dale brother wake
[1:35:50] forgive me that's not a problem
[1:35:56] i know brother wade and them wouldn't
[1:35:58] they wouldn't think nothing of it
[1:36:00] they forget it
[1:36:10] know the lord does
[1:36:14] sometimes the hardest to do is
[1:36:17] forgive ourselves to not let it stand in
[1:36:20] our way
[1:36:24] so y'all pray for me
[1:36:31] and i appreciate them
[1:36:35] standing up saying what they have to say
[1:36:44] and if anybody else you know
[1:36:50] you know you have to walk your own way
[1:36:51] so you know if people
[1:36:53] you know people get upset about things
[1:36:54] well that's y'all have to deal with your
[1:36:56] own
[1:36:57] your own journey your own problems your
[1:37:00] own feelings
[1:37:01] but you know i just want to
[1:37:06] apologize to everybody here
[1:37:10] because you know what i don't i don't
[1:37:12] want to be a stumbling block i don't
[1:37:13] want to be a hindrance
[1:37:21] and some my prayer is to be better
[1:37:38] because this is the greatest thing that
