TRANSCRIPT
========================================
glam again but we will anoint the most holy now you know it took a profit it took run around to come and God tell him what that meant because man there's a lot of commentators like I said before I don't mind any of us doing research we should research okay I think you coming up the road today what why is 12 called and doesn't I don't know I'm gonna Google Mikey on find out though the last 12 tall the doesn't leave I know do you know you know what all your life somebody's told you the twelve was it does and then a baker's dozen is why 13 that when you each one is still got 12 alright so weird the doesn't come from that's why I'm saying about these words you let you google it find out pops it hey you know that how you know as you're out him hey you know what who made 12 does is it a fact yeah obviously your right hand with most people are right-handed so God me so you're saying that they're writing the left hand people wrong left hands thank you it's a grouping of 12 that doesn't maybe one of the earliest primitive groupings perhaps because there's approximately a dozen cycles of the moon or months in the cycle of the year how about that huh how bad the reason i ask that was is because there's 12 hustle why did Jesus call 12 why didn't he call 10 why did he have 12 drive well must mean something besides just a dozen good to have our visitors with us today and good morning why did you miss the you miss the good songs when she sang sheep that song was not just a singing of a song that was a living of a song man bless my heart and my soul so what we're talking we were cool you got off on 12 we'll get back to the men but i was thinkin bout why didn't Jesus choose 12 people 12 tribes of Israel why not 13 when I hate month seven significance there's what I'm telling you about these dates and all there's a significance in Israel's time because there's not a dozen Gentile that were chosen yes man what a man but there was 12 because Jesus told him those when he turned in total he said you 12 will judge the twelve tribes of Israel so he chose twelve disciples so that's the 12 problem is room now that the sample sure they were chosen in the Old Testament but they were the ones that carried over and brought the word to the New Testament I really enjoyed what Bell jewel was talking about this the wife's not service about old Ted looking at the old they were looking at the Old Testament Jesus and he came to New Testament Jesus and he was a young man he was not an old man like they saw him in the Old Testament he was the new it was a New Testament right for that really blessed my heart be saying well that's not significant well it is to me it is to me because it showed me one thing Jesus's body changed it wasn't an old body when come back out hey listen why did they not know him no I didn't you and he come among all of them in a room and he said hey Here I am fair night and they're like yeah he said touch me the only person that ever really knew jesus said 20 years old with his mother right right yeah and that was Mary Magdalene that the tourney were not married in his mother she didn't know him at 20 that's why she thought he's a little boy working in the garden thought he was a gardener I've object ID was a gardener yes well she but when he spoke it was that same voice that she had heard and she knew so it's in the days of the voice is not the vessel it's the voiceless right so seventy weeks are determined upon thy people who Jews and the holy city Jerusalem all right to finish the transgression number one to make an end of sins number two you make reconciliation for iniquity number three to bring in everlasting righteousness number for Philip division in prophecy number five and anoint the most holy number six now that has to happen inside of this bracket of 490 years to that right because that's the redemption of Israel seventy times seven seventy weeks are determined actually in the in the translation remember when we said weeks with seven so what you do is have 70 of sevens I don't know if I showed you that or not but in one commentator you did real good job because remember we went back to where Jacob full build Rachel's week seven years for the bottles of one week at seven years so 70 of sevens when we kiss is how long seven days one week to seven days naturally one week one week to seven days okay but one week equal seven years we saw what the Prophet showed us but he got went to the Bible and God because that's what Jacob he worked seven years he didn't work seven days he works seven years to fulfil Rachel's week okay so 70 of seven so seventy times seven is what 490 alright so in 490 years God's going to take his role from from being a transgressor a center and having iniquity to bring it to bring in everlasting righteousness still at the vision and prophecy in an optimal totally that's all going to be finished in 490 years what the Bible says seventy times seven 490 right and we've showed according to the prophets message down according to the Bible according to the moon phase according to all history that this 483 years has been already fulfilled right because they know therefore and understand it from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build jerusalem unto my side of the prince who that Jesus Christ shall be seven weeks and threescore what's 33 score three times two is six a sixty-two weeks night so you've got seven weeks and sixty-two weeks is how much 62 plus seven yep well 62 times seven is four and 34 sorry seven times seven is fourth coast seven seven weeks seven weeks seven of seven seven seven 649 then 62 of seventh is 434 so we got 483 years that's 49 plus 4 and 34 for 93 years all right but what sixty-two weeks and seven week 69 that's not 70 a 69 weeks hmm because I'm from from the restoring and building of Jerusalem which we we showed it was for 45 pieces when they come in finish the walls got all the Jerusalem together got the people gathered together that's right remember we showed that 445 be seen now for 445 bc to ad 30 we showed that it was the closest we could get to 483 years ok so we're to this point right here when Jesus was killed why was he killed for you me and the Jew ok he died for everybody but he knew who would be saved a new would write like what the hell's talking about now on predestination in pornography the street shall be built again the wall even in trouble of times we saw that was done in 4 45 bc they finished the wall in 52 days we've got everything finished all right 445 bc 2 830 we show was 475 years then you convert it over into the 360-day calendar we went through all that I'm trying to back up a little bit for the Wonder here you come up to the close to 483 years and as we can get as human beings all right make on that door where today we're we're kind of like right here because like I said before the Israel sin was forgiven in Calvary but remember brother Ram said it wasn't apply that's why he had to preach about a pardon a partner's not a party unless it's accepted as a part right because the pardon when Jesus died he died two parties everybody everybody's ever born in his whole world he pardoned every one of them they just didn't accept that part okay so Israel Jesus died on the cross for what a Gentile bride but this is us this is Gentiles on here okay this is the gentle gentle ache this is Gentile this is the wild olive branch right wild branch so we were grafted in this is spoken of right here and after 62 weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself the people of the prince that shall come little pink shall destroy the city on the sanctuary who was that Titus an 80 70 a Roman general Rome Gentile way in and totally destroy the temple coach Jesus told him he said there won't be one stone left on another one when he gets finished he's going to destroy it and he's gonna take everything back with him ok shall destroy the city and sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with the flood remember they circled around Jerusalem and killed everybody that was in the city blood run out the streets on the street all right and then the end of the war desolations are determined and that's where we're at right here right here see that little flap over time there's always a little lap over time even in your church agent right I don't just stop one and start another really the church age you should look like this on month you understand long time cuz brother Ralph starts with a lap over and that's what this is that's a lap oh that's why people like that's why I can understand people have Billy Graham FF bosworth people like that that really never accepted the message of the hour but they're born again believers cuz they're waiting the lap over they were coming out of one age we age was coming out but the people were still in this age remember brother brown folder one brother said all you you pay sir ok they were born in another eight yeah well that's why I believe that we're going to look in 1977 I believe that was what brother round was talking about as far as an ending of an age all right because 77 is the 70s Jubilee all right so we'll get into that but that's over here and get right about right here all right but i will keep reading he shall confirm the covenant with many for what 17 families are one year so there's one year left after the right to the church it says right there because we're not here when he that little he is who the Antichrist the Antichrist does not make a covenant I mean Christ does not make the Covenant and then break it God does not break the Covenant how could we depend on him if he broke his covenant but you can't depend on the devil he breaks covenants all the time oh I'll help you out I'll do come for you yeah you go do some fire I'll send you the hell but he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week now the property guy said we're not here when that covenants made so we're gone so it's got to be that we leave right here and there's one of sevens one of sevens left and in the midst of the week what's in the midst of the week 39 years he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation decision for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured on this one we ain't got that for you now it's going to take a long time to piece that one out oh my gods grace we're gonna do it so right now we're at Calvary seventy weeks or determinable down people and follow policy to do six ain't finish the transgression where today transgress all right let's go and let's take you want to tell you what we'll do let's see if we can do it on here in that dearie arrow see party all right let's just read some of these things here that run around saying now this is paragraph 36 on a six-fold purpose if you want to read in your book now remember that is all that the journey of the Israelites will have on this earth joy seventy weeks are determined it's just determined that's always loved it to the Jews I pulled on people upon the holy city now this is the property God speaking therefore there's 70 weeks now don't miss it it will reveal from the time to the end of the Jews and also to the end of Jerusalem we're within the Jerusalem when Titus destroyed the city the city's the temple has never been built back since he destroyed it I spend two thousand years ago 80 70 right so it's never been built back so Jerusalem has never really oh sure they got Jerusalem Jerusalem common over there that's built and they have government and said that's not a real Jerusalem that's not a real Israel right that's not the Israel that he's speaking out right here right this is speaking of 144 thousand and two but it 144,000 but these two prophets preached to them right and then he goes through I hope we get into it real good and deep so here we go let's keep on going number one you want to market get your pencil number one to finish the transgression that's the first thing I the finish the transgression of Israel who transgressed against God will be the turning away of the ungodliness objective now we read that this would stop that last Sunday all right now to find this let's turn to Romans we did that last week this is paragraph 42 in that book if you want to read it or you can read around here what's he talking about these time by bringing in grafting in man again right because what did he do there'll be a time that when the Gentiles will be cut out Israel come back it's talking about putting the wild branch in and taking that branch back out well what's he going to do he's going to take this branch interactor mm-hmm he's gonna take this Gentile branch in a rapture where's the Gentile branch we're going we're going to be taking out but we're going to be taking up then what's he going to do he's going to come right back and do the same thing he was going to do had they not turned him down he gonna start dealing with them again through to profits after the rapture takes place all right and Israel come back in again for now we're cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature Gentile and we're grab contrary to nature we were contrary to nature anything even without mercy without going with no hope God by His mercy give us a chance cut off Israel because of their transgression we're right here cut them off and brought into idolatry us right okay everybody got that I think that's pretty simple that week so was just going guys until God is finished with the Gentile paragraph 43 Israel was blinded so for all these years right hair Israel has been blinded okay that we might be grafted in you get it so all Israel shall be saved now that's not all Israelis understand that that's not all Israelis that's all Israel looking at Israel he's looking at 144,000 and that's it all right God blinded them purposely for you and I they cannot see because God blending and all israel what true it for him shall be safe all right all right finish the transgression of Israel I've come to tell you there's a time when israel's transgression will be finished how about the poor miserable people over there let's just keep going see right here he will come to Mount Zion one of these days upon the Mount of Olives they'll recognize him and all Ezra won't know it's him what through the two prophets the Gentiles will be finished in there'll be no more Gentile saved after we go on a rapture okay now there'll be some that will be given eternal life for their stand of the gospel foolish virgin cup of water and all that but they got to go through the tribulation and die and then all right I mean that's just simple teaching that we've had since we've you know definitely coming to message I go away yup real quick the question was that's media today about how God looks at Israel right now and because he considered for example what you were just saying the current government and the Prime Minister and all that was still think I told them I said well they are in God that considers what he gave Moses in the law and the 10 my worship and all that stuff that's true Israel but I'm hoping to but I see what please he still honors people like Benjamin Netanyahu and some of those who are the leaders but if they're not born again at this point right they're sinners come on now yeah God's not going to save Israel as a nation shoulders this is what I'm trying to say that's a good point we'll stop here from any engagement night Netanyahu there's no way he's going to save the nation of Israel that's right right the nation of Israel is treated to me almost often almost like America oh yeah because we saw Americanize them over there ok so the nation of Israel is not going to be saved but now God will bless that nation that blesses him see there's still that Orthodox Jew there's still the ones that believe in one true and living God and God will bless them whether they're part of the hundred forty-four thousand or not okay I mean that's that's what that's what God to me is is the reason that see even God said well I'll bless whoever blesses Israel that's why he's kept the United States up as much as he has because we're helping is we're about doing one damn we're not doing it now but see remember he's got to come to a point where nobody stands for Israel except God himself so the president administration and all the other ones that's coming or going that has turned Israel down that's just it just puts the bombs over an hour o'farrell over on our soil yeah really i mean so because everybody when we come to to get to this last week where the value of Armageddon begins that's everybody against Israel everybody north south east and west everybody will come pass throughs limited and fight but the Bible says Michael Michael standing fight for Israel what then 144,000 have got to be protective until the two prophets bring every one of them out so for three and a half years they can't be killed the two prophets can't be kidding for three and a half year are for 1260 day yes par the 144,000 12,000 of the pure genetic line of those twelve sons okay I can't say pure genetic line cuz there is no Puritan any line there's hope your innate line there'd be no intermarrying between it I have a brother in bomas Jewish preparing my citizenship right so he can see how I don't know that God has to look at that but man you go all the way back to to Solomon and and what's her name now with almond and solvent not Solomon Solomon married Rahab Salman was an Israeli general he married a Gentile prostitute and guess who was born Boaz Jesse David true blood line David wasn't even through bloodline if you talk about true genetics looking under a microscope can you you can't he married a Gentile ball has continued on and married another gin top right amol bodice who so you can't do / pure bloodline I don't think I think it's who accepts God sure God knows who these people are we don't we don't know it's not for us to figure out who it is they don't know they'll you know what if god said to be 144,000 then be 12 out of each 12,000 a tribe leave it alone how you gonna figure that out you can't you can't figure it out God knows that gun nose at all you know I told you before you can take this piece of paper and God can tell me where this tree was that made this paper the first day you created earth Colette's god he knows where this come from so hey Pete if he keeps the blood line straight then that's fine with me but you gotta look down through the Old Testament that bloodline didn't stay perfect down to the Old Testament right Moses sure you got I mean you're like oh yes I'd like to talk to a real Jew and say look why is all these young college coming in here why are all these Gentiles Marion why are y'all you know i mean you're saying David was your King David was you know your son of David is going to come and sit on throne who could David you know where you come from he come from Salman and Israeli ray have a harlot comes down in boaz marriage Ruth a bull bodice woman and that's where Jesse comes which is David's daddy so I just leave alone leave alone God did it for a reason I guess well outside yes he does everything for remember he's not he doesn't he doesn't go no you shouldn't marry her he knew he knew how this would come together I see it more clearly now what road a young hey he's preaching now that we're all things that come together just the way God wanted the base just the way God wanted to make not one you know we're scratching our head wondering how in the world you think God ever scratched his head twice got helpful air we're doing all this and you're not gray-headed either cuz you don't worry right amen now where was we've we were talking on seven weeks name home about the roof let's get on over here and let's get to back out 51 he come to finish the transgression make a finish of it not push it back not moving out of the way to finish it all right excuse me now if we go back in the day again we'll find out Daniel we find out the 24th worse to finish transgression finish what to finish Israel transgression so this is talking just about Israel right what is a transgressed it is to go against something transgressed against me is to do a wrong to me transgress against you to do the wrong to you so Israel did it wrong to God and in this 70th week you should we said 70th week remember Israel sure their transgression was finished here but what a finish back here in his 69 week I hope everybody got that now sure this is the foundation building up to it there's no way me and you can be born again without the foundation of the word being already bad right right like Jewel said you made a really good point the seed is the word the word is where you go back to its the word that you held inside to use what was quickly all right yeah you didn't have it when you were born but the word were there in that form I can see that that was a sequel alright so that's what it is it still worth its being quicken right now it's the word is being quick you can't you can't understand God without hearings work right just as simple of that you can alright so well that God is going to finish the transgression of Israel in this 70th week so where's it got where's all the redemption going to happen after we're gone because remember they're not renamed while we're here they're not redeemed before we got here but God is building a platform why because what they're going to do it just not mean you if you're born again in this age right here you look all the way back to Calvary and see where he already forgive your sin right hey Calgary that's my brother Anson don't ever forget calorie Calvary it's the point that everybody goes back to so what is we're going to do once we get out of here in few profits come down what are they gonna preach calorie you missed it you missed it he came to you and you missed it right that's right then that's where we're reading maybe next Sunday of your next I want to get into about two or three of these and then we're going to turn back into Jeremiah and Ezekiel in some of those places where he said where did you get those scars because then I realized right there when it happened with the Calvary turning away or the gun violence from Jacob and then all Israel will be born again now look you said oh brother Gramps at all Israel be born again only 144,000 go back to the Bible you got to go back to the Bible the Bible will preach to Israel and they'll be 144,000 safe all right not all of Israel and all of them will receive the Holy Spirit food 144,000 right so number one is finished a transgression where did they transgressed at Calvary they've been transmission back before but this is our main point right here we can stay a long time on that but I don't want to go to preaching on just want to talk to you instead you get into it in the sealed all right number to make an end of sin now let's read again vintage transgression to make an end of sin that's his second person purpose of coming now what company is he talking about smurfs coming that's where he did it all he needed all his first coming he's not coming back here physically Jesus right he came here to finish it that's his second purpose of coming now what then you can apply it over here because he's going to be coming to Israel right but what's this going to be remember it's not the reek illing of the Lamb the day of atonement is going to happen right here and they're going to look back and see that he had already died they already had killed the lamb lamb patent don't have to be killed again right do you just didn't have to get on cross to die for you again he died one time accepted what he did that's his second person of coming first is the finish Israel's transgression and make an end of sense where did Israel sin where did they do their vital sin where did they separate themselves from God turn to Matthew 24 here's what his roommate her fatal mistake here's where she'd done her last cent because remember cut off after that right Daniel 9 24 said mossad was cut off but not for himself who was he cut off for us in Israel all right here's where she done her last Sam and the reason she's in the condition today Matthew the 27 chapter of Matthew's Gospel 25th verse the governor answered and said unto them whether I the train will you that I'll release into you we'ii than I release them to you and they said Bareilles now remember that's Israel that's the Jews remember they bring Jesus to pilot pilot said he's yours right he said there's yours I can't make a judge you give Jeff caller said unto them what shall I do with Jesus which is called Christ listen to them and they said unto him let him be crucified so the Jews decided not to Romans the Romans just carried out the descendants remember that's their Messiah that David said would come remember this morning in the lesson he will be cut off not for himself not nothing he did so he's identifying that Jesus was cut off at the cross let him be crucified and the governor said Why What evil has he done he's trying to talk him out of it but they cried out the more sane let it be crucified then Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but rather a two month was made and he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying I am innocent of the blood of this person sing to it see to it listen here's their mistake here is their sin then answered the people which were what Jews and says his blood be on us and on our children his blood be on us and our children in other words the generations coming down all right there is where they done it he was making an end of sin for them how could he do anything that helps but forgive him knowing that he had to blame their eyes that we could come in like his own children calling for his blood and they were blinded and he know they were blinded that's the reason he cried for forgiveness for them forgive a father for they know not what we're doing they were blind for our safe they were made blind and they'll unbelief they did this but when they see him again a man putting in the sim what is sin I believe they did not believe that was on the side they could not see him to be massaged yet he does every Sunday Messiah was supposed to do but they couldn't see it they were blind so when you see people say I don't believe in divine healing I can't see it I can't see the baptism the Holy go don't be angry with their money they say I can't see this message of him coming I can't see this baptism in the Holy Spirit I can't see the surface eat can see the stuff they're blinded oh not just pray for them all right in their unbelief but when they see him when he comes again it will make an end of their unbelief what right all right coming again in the two prophets okay then he's talking about Genesis 45 all right talk about Joseph because remember what does Jonas do he's perfect time of let's just wait that for next Sunday because I want to bring that in because remember Joseph is a perfect type of Christ so whatever that model of what happens to Joseph is what's going to happen in the seventy weeks of Daniel everything he does happens in the 70 weeks today it's a tight you understand not not during the time of that don't get me wrong he's not going to come up but it's a type of Joseph is a type of Christ Benjamin's the top of the 144,000 so you got Jesus in the 144,000 but when does he deal with him over here he doesn't deal with him here okay he deals with him here so this is where brother brown brains Joseph in and see Joseph was so 435 same one jesus oh Jesus more they thought he was dead remember the cumin he had two people in the prison but will read that because remember Joseph is exactly when he comes and his brothers coming they he reveals himself to them they say oh we're dead we have we have done our brother wrong you know we have sold him he we thought you were dead same thing same thing when Jesus reveals himself to them they're gonna say old man we're done for and he says no it was done to preserve life that's what Joseph member jord the reason Joseph went to Egypt got shot him a vision they be seven years of plenty and seven years of so during that seven years of plenty he just stored all the he built these huge grain bins and stored enough grain now look how smart he was he stored enough grain in those seven years to last those seven years plus seven more years that's why Joseph is called is prosperity and same way with Jesus when Jesus comes back there's nothing but prosperity but they're going to realize that they killed him and he said no I you it was done for a purpose it was done number one to save her I Gentile bride and number two to save you okay so we'll get into that type next next Sunday but to finish the grant transgression to make an end of sin their sin was is what is the only once in unbelief they did not believe he was the Messiah but you know what he's going to be revealed and then I'm gonna realize that he's got to be crucified again they gonna realize he's already done the work and they just got accepted now to me that makes an insane that did it don't make you the end of your sin even in true justification if you're that's what I want to I want to warn all of you sitting in this room today struck me the other day I was thinking about something to happen and it's close to around here but we had this man that that he was he treated his family wrong and he was not a convicted child molester but he molested children but he gave his heart to gun he gave his heart to God was truly born again what are you gonna do that what are you gonna do God don't see it mom God don't see it from long we all been out in the world most of us but out in the world makes a lot of things we may have done with boys and girls or men and women or whenever I out in the world and one day on Judgment you're gonna be standing up there judging the whole world and that person is going to be standing there looking up at you knowing that you had a connection with that sim that was got sim that they did what's the difference if your sins truly forgiven you can't hold it against the people right now they certain things I wouldn't do if I you know a convicted child molester or somebody like that you understand two-minute i'm going to the extreme right come here child molester worse than any but but if god truly saved the soul changed him turned him into a god-fearing person and he was truly born again there's nothing you can say about you tell me why the jesus going to judge if Jesus going to judge them for all the hideous thing they did to him he's gonna say it was done to preserve you Jesus is not going to condemn them he's already saved on that much telling us all to be careful how they even we can't forget but we got to realize that if God forgave that person God didn't say it so you take God why did it y'all no way to do if he's truly born again that to me that's why the new birth programs it was most important thing you could have cuz once a new birth comes down it takes and takes everything away I'm telling you that's why this right here is very hard brotherly kindness is very very hard to have true brotherly time because that right there is loving that man that man molested your child whatever you aren't you on st. are you how are you absolutely hey listen God forgive them remember what growing around said program said if you've been forgiven of a sin he said I can't bring it on from another blood why cuz it ain't there he said I may know it as a human because under discernment he might be able to see things remember and God would tell me said don't touch that right why he can't bring it back out if it's been forgiven he said I can't see it he said I you know somebody may come and tell me that this guy's a thief but my brother branham would discern that man even see no debrie in that man if he was a true born again believer so whatever this person told him about this other person it don't matter when it comes to God you know because god don't say it the guy that was telling except solutely correct good point cuz they brought it out from under the black bear so we have to be careful about the whole ago you know the hold of sometimes is not something we think it is you notice it listen god don't say good people running that's right I don't say goodbye amen I know saying good people good people are self righteous God saved people that work centers and like I said you know even to be nothing that you've never done anything in your life and you as pure as you can be if you didn't believe in God you just as bad as the person doing other things so all right don't want to get into that but I one just kind of bring it out cuz you come up with things in life and you say with wine you better leave it alone if that person was born again and if that person really truly asks for repent you better leave it alone I don't know why I'm telling you this but I'm telling you I didn't charge you another time for that get out of here we'll be own number
