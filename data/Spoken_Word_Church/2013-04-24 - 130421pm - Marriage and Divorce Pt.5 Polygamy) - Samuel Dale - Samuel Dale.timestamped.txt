[27:25] make a copy of this
[27:28] all right it's not necessarily to go out
[27:30] to the public because we don't put it on
[27:32] the internet because it's more or less
[27:34] private to us here but to you local
[27:37] congregation and things counting this
[27:39] your church home then uh you can you can
[27:42] get the those if you request it from

[28:13] that would be glad to let you stay in
[28:16] their home with them you know and
[28:18] everything and just just remember that
[28:20] the main thing that we say you come and
[28:22] stay with us on a fellowship meeting
[28:25] night like that and uh maybe you get
[28:27] breakfast the next morning but you don't
[28:29] get lunch for the for the next day you
[28:31] have to provide your own from then on
[28:33] but we do do that but just do those
[28:36] things and uh you know there's a list
[28:39] downstairs you put it down and and
[28:41] anybody that sees that can say we'll
[28:43] take this one we'll take that one but we
[28:45] we try to make everybody as comfortable
[28:47] as we can to do what we can and brother
[28:50] Jonathan Jones I've never heard him
[28:52] preach he was actually brother Jimmy
[28:54] Gibson's son-in-law and I've never heard
[28:56] him preach so it' be a a great thing for
[28:59] all of us to heard a lot of good reports
[29:01] about him but never heard him so just
[29:04] remember that uh any other
[29:07] announcements
[29:09] um no announcements are there
[29:14] okay Heavenly Father we thank you Lord
[29:16] Jesus for your grace and love unto us
[29:19] thank you for the day that we have the
[29:21] time father to be able to set aside that
[29:24] we can take a little time and fellowship
[29:27] together around thy word and Lord we we
[29:30] just thank you for you because without
[29:33] you what would there wouldn't be
[29:34] anything of us anyway but we thank you
[29:36] and just have your way now as we try to
[29:38] speak about you you come and be in our
[29:40] hearts and our lives and just Lord we
[29:43] love you and we thank you guide us now
[29:46] and keep us in Jesus name amen
[29:51] Matthew
[29:56] 19 verse three the Pharisees also came
[29:59] unto him tempting him and saying unto
[30:02] him is it lawful for a man to put away
[30:04] his wife forever cause and he answered
[30:07] and said unto them have you not read
[30:09] that he which made them at the beginning
[30:11] made them male and female and said for
[30:14] this cause shall a man leave father and
[30:16] mother and shall cleave to his wife and
[30:18] they twne shall be one flesh wherefore
[30:21] there are no more twine but one flesh
[30:24] what therefore God ha joined together
[30:26] let no man put us under they say unto
[30:28] them to him why did Moses then command
[30:32] to give a writing of divorcement and to
[30:34] put her away he said say unto them Moses
[30:38] because of the hardness of your hearts
[30:41] suffered you to put away your wives but
[30:43] from the beginning it was not so now
[30:46] that is in no way
[30:48] referencing that just because their
[30:50] hearts got hardened that everybody could
[30:53] just do
[30:55] everything right
[30:58] he explains it in the next verse it has
[31:01] no reference that that just because of
[31:03] the hardness of your hearts you know
[31:05] y'all wanteded it you got it remember
[31:08] brother random said he gave it to Moses
[31:11] and counted it
[31:12] righteousness so that's not just because
[31:15] they wanted it that they got it and it
[31:17] was okay for
[31:18] everything that's the one point I'm
[31:20] driving down hard in this series on this
[31:24] in verse 9 says and I say unto you who
[31:27] whoever shall put away his wife except
[31:29] it be for fornication and shall marry
[31:32] another committ adulterine whosoever
[31:33] Marth her which is put away doth commit
[31:36] adultery he explained it you may be
[31:39] seated right there in the bases of
[31:41] saying and giving you the only
[31:45] grounds that you can cover it on and we
[31:47] won't get to there this afternoon
[31:51] thought we would but we got tied up a
[31:53] little bit this morning speaking of
[31:55] the two Covenants
[31:58] and uh I hope you'll go home and think
[32:02] about these things that as I said in
[32:05] that that this is not the two covenants
[32:08] that was made over it with uh Paul
[32:11] speaking you know and and saying there
[32:14] in the scriptures you know that one was
[32:16] made with Mount Si and the other one was
[32:17] made with Jerusalem which is above and
[32:20] all it that's not the Covenant there
[32:24] right it was the Covenant that was made
[32:27] play with Adam and Eve in the garden and
[32:31] and the things and I want to review that
[32:33] a good bit and then pick up our thought
[32:36] from where we were and continue on
[32:44] now brother R said because of the
[32:48] Fall there had to be another covenant
[32:52] made there was only one Covenant to
[32:55] begin with you remember that this
[32:56] morning
[32:58] paragraph 101 marriage and divorce
[33:00] co-equal with
[33:01] him but she lost her co-equal with
[33:05] man right and thereby they wound up
[33:08] being two
[33:10] covenants all right the Covenant with
[33:12] the
[33:13] product and the Covenant with the
[33:16] byproduct all right now two covenants as
[33:22] I said now this Covenant that he's
[33:23] speaking of I do not believe that that's
[33:26] speaking of salvation in the bases of
[33:29] the new birth and stuff like that all
[33:32] right I tried to emphasize that this
[33:34] morning because it it's not that your
[33:38] marital situation is not going to send
[33:41] you to
[33:42] hell it will if you don't do something
[33:45] about it or you let that yourself let
[33:48] that be a hindrance you can do it it's
[33:50] the cause of the Fall it's a problem
[33:52] that made us the way we are and all like
[33:55] that but we're not at standing like Adam
[33:58] and Eve again right we're standing on
[34:00] free moral agency that's right of the
[34:03] right to accept or reject it's not
[34:06] Adam's fault that we're in the trouble
[34:08] we're in it's our fault we can't blame
[34:12] him for what was going
[34:14] on but then he made two
[34:17] covenants one with the male and one with
[34:20] the
[34:21] female
[34:23] now as I said if that was talking about
[34:26] salvation you know want talking about
[34:28] the New Birth salvation eternal life
[34:31] Etc then you would be dealing with uh
[34:34] the basis
[34:36] of life or
[34:39] death but Adam and Eve wasn't dealing
[34:41] with the the fact Adam was just as Dead
[34:44] when he walked out of the garden as Eve
[34:46] was amen now whatever death you put her
[34:49] you better put him CU I emphasized it
[34:53] over and over I have in this the Bible
[34:55] says in Adam all die right right all
[34:58] right he had the right to put her
[35:02] away and God would have killed
[35:05] her and started
[35:08] again all right but we know he didn't
[35:11] and that would be the point of bringing
[35:13] forth his attributes and the things and
[35:16] we know that Adam loved his wife but now
[35:19] remember there was only when they were
[35:21] Adam and
[35:24] Eve there was one Covenant right all
[35:28] right now you
[35:30] agree okay one
[35:33] Covenant now I want
[35:37] scripture and I want to know what that
[35:39] Covenant
[35:46] is you understand
[35:48] me he made one Covenant
[35:54] yep he made that with Adam yep
[36:00] while he was
[36:01] still you know Eve was in
[36:04] Adam
[36:06] naturally when Eve was taken from
[36:09] Adam she would be under
[36:13] that one Covenant right because it would
[36:17] be
[36:19] co-equal are you listening now yes if
[36:22] they're co-equal then whatever Covenant
[36:24] Adam has she has a covenant Now what is
[36:27] that
[36:31] Covenant brother around and said every
[36:34] time God made a covenant said man broke
[36:37] it you agree you need about 400 quotes
[36:41] on that when I get maybe
[36:46] 150 I'm just serious I want you to
[36:50] think what was that
[36:56] Covenant jot it down on a piece of paper
[36:58] and see if your answer is
[37:02] correct what you think about it and I
[37:04] don't do it to be
[37:06] trickery I do it to get you to
[37:10] think because I said this
[37:13] morning Satan is here today doing
[37:17] exactly like he was doing in the
[37:19] garden he's right here in this
[37:23] congregation right here in your minds in
[37:26] my mind doing exactly what he was doing
[37:29] in the
[37:31] garden that's why Paul said that he was
[37:34] the scared less through his
[37:37] subtility see that he would deceive us
[37:40] about
[37:41] the Simplicity of Jesus
[37:45] Christ all right we can look at and we
[37:48] can see the doctrines of the
[37:50] message and see that they're not seeing
[37:52] the Simplicity of Christ if it was they
[37:54] wouldn't bring those
[37:55] doctrines we can see those doctrines
[37:58] going forth and thank God for showing us
[38:01] those doctrines that are wrong that's
[38:03] right and and we wouldn't agree with
[38:07] them but I'm talking to Lula Georgia
[38:11] today anybody else listening is up to
[38:14] them uh I don't Pastor the
[38:18] internet but what is that
[38:22] Covenant that was made with Adam
[38:35] if it was then it was made with
[38:41] Eve as I said then the prophet would say
[38:44] he said God basically made three
[38:48] covenants one with
[38:50] Adam let's see now may get this wrong
[38:52] but if I hope I'm right one with
[38:55] Noah and another with Abraham
[38:58] you remember Abraham came became
[39:01] unconditional Abraham was under the
[39:03] conditional
[39:05] Covenant that was brought forth and the
[39:08] problems until God made another
[39:12] Covenant a New Covenant with Abraham
[39:16] right you remember he put him to sleep
[39:18] he made it unconditional Etc and all but
[39:21] now on that basis what do you think
[39:25] about the Covenant that was made with
[39:33] Adam see if we can read what the prophet
[39:36] said that's why I love to do that then I
[39:39] don't have to wonder what is your
[39:42] input meaning what do you think about
[39:45] this well my thoughts are just as good
[39:47] as your thoughts and that's
[39:51] true probably sometime a whole lot
[39:54] better but what does the word say
[39:57] that's that's the difference in it right
[40:00] that's right all right now if we can
[40:02] read something from the
[40:05] prophet maybe we'll understand this
[40:08] Covenant so go ahead brother Anderson
[40:11] and pill up 4
[40:16] a I laid these on the desk in there and
[40:19] there's all scribbled up so if they get
[40:20] to Jumping don't worry about it they'll
[40:22] find
[40:24] me preached in 1965 for 25 brother
[40:28] around preached a message called God's
[40:29] provided place of worship paragraph 29
[40:32] said he had a covenant with
[40:35] Adam the first man on the
[40:38] earth and that Covenant was on
[40:42] conditions if you do so and so I'll do
[40:46] so and
[40:49] so what's now Adam would had something
[40:53] to do in order to keep this Covenant
[40:56] alive before
[40:59] God now you are you listening yes so
[41:03] Adam is put in the garden
[41:05] uncondition right he would have
[41:08] something to do
[41:11] y with this doing why because it's
[41:14] conditions what's condition if you do
[41:17] I'll do if you don't I don't
[41:21] right all right now
[41:23] watching what did he have to do Adam
[41:25] would had something to do in order to
[41:27] keep this commandment alive before God
[41:29] what would that be he had to walk in
[41:31] God's ways keeping all of his word not
[41:36] breaking one
[41:38] word all right
[41:43] now so it's it's an UNC it's a
[41:47] conditional Covenant that started with
[41:48] Adam the unconditional Covenant started
[41:51] with
[41:52] Abraham all
[41:54] right what was that Covenant where's the
[41:57] scpt
[41:59] scriptures go ahead with number
[42:02] 4B taking from Abraham and his seed
[42:05] after him 1961 423 which would be
[42:08] paragraph
[42:10] e19 now when he made a covenant with
[42:14] Adam if you will not touch that tree
[42:18] you'll live forever and there's his
[42:21] Covenant right what did you write down
[42:24] is the Covenant part of your thought
[42:28] if you'll not touch that tree that's the
[42:30] only thing that was said to
[42:34] Adam show me anywhere in the Bible now
[42:38] all he said to Adam was you don't touch
[42:42] that tree y all he had to do just not
[42:46] touch that
[42:47] tree he could eat of every tree that was
[42:50] in the garden is that according to
[42:54] Genesis brother R said then thereby he
[42:57] could even eat of the tree of
[43:02] life you
[43:04] know we know the tree of life is Jesus
[43:06] Christ the
[43:09] word So Adam could eat of that
[43:13] tree he was just told not to eat of the
[43:15] tree of knowledge of Good and
[43:18] Evil there's the
[43:20] covenant What is the Covenant brother
[43:23] random if you will not touch that tree
[43:26] you'll live forever
[43:27] Adam broke it Moses and them if you'll
[43:30] keep the Commandments I'll do so and so
[43:33] I'll you know if you break the Covenant
[43:35] I'll do so and so God makes a covenant
[43:38] with man man breaks his Covenant with
[43:40] God but the Covenant was Genesis what
[43:44] 3:17 I believe it is where he
[43:46] says you don't partake of that tree of
[43:49] knowledge of Good and
[43:51] Evil all right I didn't give him this
[43:54] one but it's taken from the message he
[43:56] swore by himself preached in 1954
[44:01] 1212 God told told
[44:04] Adam if you'll touch this
[44:06] tree you you eat from here and you'll
[44:11] live you eat from th that one you'll
[44:16] die that's the
[44:19] Covenant now that's if you got the thing
[44:23] before you if you do this if you do that
[44:27] you'll die you'll live there eat this
[44:31] one you'll live eat that eat from this
[44:34] one he died so what is the Covenant that
[44:38] was made then
[44:40] with Abraham I mean
[44:44] Adam don't eat of that
[44:48] tree that was transmitted to
[44:52] Eve right her being
[44:55] co-equal so when she came into
[44:58] being then it would be the same
[45:04] Covenant for
[45:06] her and for
[45:09] him don't eat of the
[45:12] tree brother Bram said and you've got it
[45:15] and you heard it you heard him say said
[45:16] that that was just one word he said in
[45:18] the
[45:20] garden he said just one
[45:24] word what's he saying just one word
[45:28] one point don't eat of that
[45:31] tree cu the day you eat thereof that day
[45:33] you'll die you can eat every tree out
[45:36] here you can even eat of the Tree of
[45:38] Life brother said the tree of life was
[45:40] in the garden to remind Adam that his
[45:42] youth was being
[45:44] renewed because his body was not
[45:49] Eternal so now there's your covenant
[45:52] made
[45:53] with Adam
[45:57] but then a fall came as we read this
[45:59] morning and at that point she was
[46:02] co-equal but once she
[46:04] fell that another Covenant was made she
[46:07] was no longer ruler with him each must
[46:10] have a separate Covenant paragraph 194
[46:13] we'll read that in just a
[46:16] moment again to
[46:18] start coequal with him being in that
[46:22] high form brother Brown says paragraph
[46:24] 101 marriage and divorce
[46:27] how could she do such a
[46:28] thing being in that high form she was
[46:32] right with man co-equal with him she
[46:35] lost her co-equal with man when she
[46:38] sinned and God said man will be your
[46:41] ruler from your own
[46:44] out
[46:48] now got a covenant then for the product
[46:50] and a covenant for the byproduct
[46:58] have you caught on a little of what I'm
[46:59] talking about from this
[47:03] morning if we don't believe it was
[47:08] a covenant of
[47:11] Salvation you know the woman with one
[47:15] way of getting saved and another man
[47:16] with another
[47:18] way would that be a good one for people
[47:20] of this message has got their two Lords
[47:22] and two souls and all kind of can't you
[47:24] just see
[47:25] them well
[47:27] Adam's saved by one way man's sa woman
[47:31] she's saved by another
[47:33] way you
[47:36] know and be a good Doctrine I guess
[47:39] wouldn't
[47:40] it but now
[47:44] listen if there needs to be another
[47:49] Covenant what kind of a covenant is
[47:55] it he said that's where I had to stop
[47:57] because
[47:58] of another hour
[48:01] here
[48:03] okay
[48:06] if the Covenant with Adam and Eve was
[48:11] one
[48:12] Covenant do not to partake of the tree
[48:14] of life I mean tree of knowledge of Good
[48:16] and
[48:17] Evil right all
[48:20] right now when Adam is under one
[48:24] Covenant Eve is under another Covenant
[48:27] right you remember I gave you a couple
[48:30] of quotes this morning where brother
[48:33] brandom even refers to it where it would
[48:35] go into marriage and divorce but he's
[48:38] talking about the Covenant that a woman
[48:40] is not supposed to cut her high and that
[48:43] the man is supposed to cut his right
[48:46] makes a double
[48:50] Covenant and in doing that then you're
[48:53] going to see naturally I hope
[49:00] that what happened
[49:03] was and I pray God give me the right
[49:06] words to use on
[49:10] this I wrote it like this before we
[49:13] start I want you to think on this
[49:16] point this is not two covenants spoken
[49:19] of Paul and Galatians
[49:23] 4 this is not two Covenants for
[49:27] salvation there's only one way of
[49:33] Salvation these two
[49:37] covenants deal with a man and the
[49:40] woman after the
[49:44] fall now you following
[49:46] me so it will be dealing
[49:51] with how they live
[49:57] and involved with your life on
[50:01] Earth because there's only one Covenant
[50:04] with
[50:06] God and when this is all finished and we
[50:08] get into heaven there won't be two
[50:11] covenants in heaven right you agree
[50:14] right there W be two
[50:17] covenants there only be one Covenant in
[50:21] heaven all
[50:25] right now
[50:27] now so we better deal with not talk
[50:30] about
[50:33] salvation but looking
[50:38] ourselves why we here on
[50:42] Earth the man
[50:44] has God deals with him one
[50:49] way I'm talking about physically now I'm
[50:51] not talking about his salvation all
[50:52] right everybody understand me God deals
[50:55] with a man one way and heal deals with a
[50:57] woman another
[51:00] way by dealing in those two matters it
[51:03] makes two
[51:07] covenants and you say well it's silly
[51:10] what you brought out well your Prophet
[51:11] is one that brought it out so I guess
[51:13] you're calling him
[51:16] silly that the Bible speaks of a man not
[51:18] to have long hair and a woman to have
[51:20] long hair
[51:22] right speaks of a man to work tant and
[51:25] things a woman to
[51:28] dresses and the prophet says that even
[51:31] means in your marriage and
[51:34] divorce
[51:37] case all
[51:39] right that's paragraph 306 are then the
[51:42] evening messenger I read it this morning
[51:45] 63 uh
[51:47] 115 no excuse me
[51:50] 11868 let's give a
[51:52] glis 1
[51:54] one a pretty good six I'm 723 now so
[51:59] that's what I told Brother Richard
[52:00] Wilson this morning I said you was out
[52:03] running me for a little while his
[52:04] birthday is in February and he was 73
[52:08] and I said No 7 he was 74 in February
[52:13] and I said I was two years behind
[52:18] you but all at once in April I caught up
[52:22] a whole
[52:24] year now he's only one year you're
[52:27] older but now
[52:31] listen so then it has to be that the
[52:34] Covenant form that is being spoken of
[52:37] and not being salvation and not being
[52:39] those
[52:40] things it would mean your manner of
[52:44] life you're
[52:47] living how you
[52:49] live and why things are like they are
[52:58] see not looking for a Salvation
[53:02] Covenant but looking to a point of the
[53:05] end
[53:08] time
[53:12] now why would it
[53:15] be that the new
[53:18] birth would not wipe out
[53:22] everything cuz that's what people think
[53:26] when I got to New Birth that took care
[53:28] of
[53:29] everything well the whole Bible was full
[53:31] of it and you know took a long time and
[53:34] the prophet finally preached on marriage
[53:36] and divorce why in the world he preach
[53:37] on marriage and divorce and and say I
[53:39] say unto you and Paul said it and Moses
[53:42] it was all tied up in the New
[53:44] Birth just one say you get born again
[53:47] you took care of
[53:49] everything your new birth takes care of
[53:52] the sin in the soul right that's right
[53:56] that's why there's not no two covenants
[53:58] in the garden from Adam and Eve in the
[54:00] soul part it's both identically the same
[54:03] it's the new birth
[54:06] amen but then we deal with fleshly
[54:12] speaking and by doing that by knowing
[54:14] and realizing that we're not going to
[54:16] get as I ended up this morning talking
[54:18] if we were if we're going to get a new
[54:19] body then we don't have to worry about
[54:21] marriage and divorce right you
[54:24] agree but it wouldn't have any
[54:26] connections to
[54:30] us but if it does have connections to us
[54:33] we better
[54:36] listen well brother I just don't
[54:38] understand it brother randam said
[54:43] it and and I believe it's all right well
[54:46] okay but I asked the question this
[54:48] morning read from the prophet saying
[54:51] that it had to be revealed to you
[54:54] amen some of you were sitting there
[54:58] maybe young and on up a little age and
[54:59] all different ones but some of you a
[55:01] good many were there I'm looking at
[55:04] maybe 1 2 3 4 four at least it was
[55:09] sitting there when he preached marriage
[55:10] and
[55:11] divorce but I still got to say to
[55:15] you if that wasn't revealed to
[55:19] you
[55:22] then it's just words
[55:24] right and you can't take as I said this
[55:27] morning this message to the people of
[55:29] the
[55:30] world you start talking to somebody and
[55:33] they start saying well you know I've
[55:35] been married two or three times we got
[55:38] the way for you straighten that out if
[55:39] you just come up
[55:41] Lula
[55:43] please please don't do
[55:46] that CU we don't have no way to work it
[55:48] out that's right all you do is just come
[55:51] in and sit down with a bunch of people
[55:52] that's got the same
[55:54] problem does that work it out
[55:57] out no but we can find out what God says
[56:02] right he has the way to work it out but
[56:06] that'll be a revelation amen not just
[56:10] words that you say okay sorry to be like
[56:13] I am but I got to preach it straight it
[56:16] don't matter who it hits or what it
[56:18] covers I got to go down the
[56:22] line he said well brother D you don't
[56:24] believe that the
[56:28] it's the same Covenant to live
[56:30] by you know the man and the woman to
[56:33] live by you don't believe we have the
[56:34] same Covenant to live by no cuz that's
[56:36] the problem that's
[56:39] right now now the one thing I'm saying
[56:41] we all need to live and do good that all
[56:46] right but because of the woman partaking
[56:48] of the tree of life I mean tree of
[56:50] knowledge of Good and
[56:52] Evil see it throwed the problem on her
[56:55] side
[56:56] right I'm laying this down for
[57:00] Wednesday but it laid the problem on her
[57:05] side and and for being on her side
[57:08] that's the problem right you got to deal
[57:10] with it one way the man has to deal with
[57:12] it another
[57:16] way I love questions so I ask you
[57:19] another
[57:21] one how come the sin offering
[57:26] was an
[57:33] animal you
[57:35] agree God killed the animals then they
[57:38] had to offer the
[57:43] why because the animal was the
[57:46] instigator or the
[57:49] natural material used or whatever you
[57:52] want to call it to bring about Sin right
[57:55] so it would be natur natur to use an
[57:57] animal to bring an atonement now I'm
[57:59] quoting brother
[58:03] random paraphrase maybe but still close
[58:10] enough so then we've got to deal with
[58:12] something about this flesh man
[58:16] right you know all right then we we look
[58:20] and we see that naturally women are
[58:23] supposed to be women yep
[58:26] the men are supposed to be men that's
[58:29] the
[58:31] situation brother Brandon said when you
[58:33] see them Crossing
[58:34] up you see it messing
[58:37] up right course we all want to scream
[58:41] and holler to preachers in this message
[58:43] about the
[58:44] women to leave and say is your wife
[58:46] worthy of the Gospel you know not your
[58:49] life
[58:51] worthy I've heard preachers say back
[58:54] good many years ago you know especially
[58:56] one brother was bad and said we get the
[58:57] women lined up we' be ready to
[59:01] go
[59:04] well if that's
[59:06] true we'll just have a line after
[59:09] service right down through the middle of
[59:11] the church and we'll put the men on each
[59:13] side and the women in the middle and all
[59:15] the men will take a whip and they'll
[59:16] just beat them into
[59:19] place you said you're silly no that's
[59:22] what they're saying they're not saying
[59:24] if we get ly up
[59:29] right come on you've listened enough
[59:31] preachers you already heard it
[59:35] right they can
[59:38] strut but always condemning the
[59:41] woman all
[59:43] right see now the covenants
[59:47] then the the the difference in the
[59:50] Covenant between the male and the
[59:54] female we'll deal with this just a
[59:56] minute then we'll leave
[59:59] it it says that she
[1:00:02] can't but he can
[1:00:06] right she can't marry again irregardless
[1:00:09] of what except the death of her husband
[1:00:11] that's right there is no grounds nowhere
[1:00:15] in the
[1:00:16] Bible for a woman to divorce a
[1:00:19] man right we will get to that
[1:00:23] Wednesday just hitting a little
[1:00:26] but it's not said for him
[1:00:31] no you got two
[1:00:34] covenants are you following it amen you
[1:00:37] got two
[1:00:39] covenants one with him one with her now
[1:00:43] I put it up front don't mind doing it
[1:00:45] anytime I love
[1:00:46] to you said well a man can just put his
[1:00:49] wife away for just
[1:00:51] anything they ain't no Bible for that
[1:00:54] and they ain't no prophet's message for
[1:00:56] that quote bring it to me I want to see
[1:01:03] it because there's only one in the
[1:01:06] scripture
[1:01:09] right except it be for
[1:01:16] fornication but Brother D I got where
[1:01:18] brother Brown said you can put your wife
[1:01:20] away it's 50 something times and you can
[1:01:22] put your wife away for cutting her hair
[1:01:31] but there's one in there you better make
[1:01:32] sure you put with
[1:01:34] it we'll get it Wednesday
[1:01:37] night he said but he can't marry again
[1:01:39] for that
[1:01:41] reason you see you can't make the Bible
[1:01:44] nor the prophet fight each other you
[1:01:45] know they can't do it it has to come
[1:01:47] together as a
[1:01:49] layout well then how are you going to
[1:01:51] deal with it when you get there brother
[1:01:52] Dale I might want to leave it alone let
[1:01:54] you think about it but I don't like to
[1:01:56] leave you dangling too
[1:01:59] bad for a woman to cut her hair is
[1:02:02] unclean
[1:02:08] living
[1:02:11] okay unclean living for you to cut your
[1:02:13] high
[1:02:15] sister what about us men all the things
[1:02:17] but uh we'll get up to their Wednesday
[1:02:20] cuz I sure ain't got four hours this
[1:02:22] evening I want to eat some more of that
[1:02:24] cake and ice cream
[1:02:29] but now think about it two
[1:02:33] covenants and it's dealing with your
[1:02:36] life on Earth I want to emphasize that
[1:02:39] over and over and over where you'll get
[1:02:42] it it's not dealing with your
[1:02:47] salvation you
[1:02:49] know it is the products of the natural
[1:02:54] flesh that we have have to deal
[1:02:58] with she's given a covenant he's given a
[1:03:03] covenant for the way we
[1:03:07] live but we got to be very narrow on
[1:03:10] coming down to it because I said then
[1:03:13] you just can't put your wife away for
[1:03:15] any cause or every cause the Bible tells
[1:03:18] you the only way you can yep right all
[1:03:23] right the prophet surely is not contrary
[1:03:26] to the Bible wouldn't I wouldn't believe
[1:03:28] would you right but now we found this
[1:03:33] morning 325 of the future home paragraph
[1:03:35] 325 of the future home that he did not
[1:03:39] curse
[1:03:41] Adam and he did not curse
[1:03:45] Eve so now if you going to say well
[1:03:49] Adam's a good guy you
[1:03:51] know but Eve is a bad person and she's
[1:03:56] cursed well I brother Ram said she
[1:03:58] wasn't now so you're going to have to
[1:04:00] talk to
[1:04:03] him I'm sorry I found that
[1:04:08] quote but you
[1:04:10] see if it's not a curse Adam or a cur
[1:04:13] Eve situation you know in other words if
[1:04:15] it's not a death I'm sure they probably
[1:04:17] got that up now where you can read it if
[1:04:19] it's not a death
[1:04:23] situation but I will remind you in the
[1:04:25] Old
[1:04:26] Testament while a lot of these things
[1:04:29] was going
[1:04:34] on it was a lot of
[1:04:38] trouble
[1:04:41] right Adam could have but didn't it know
[1:04:45] comes over to Lage 4 or something in
[1:04:47] Genesis or you come into the polygamy
[1:04:51] situation with the two man with the two
[1:04:53] wi his first name was or his name was
[1:04:55] Layman
[1:04:59] so it wasn't even the garden
[1:05:02] with too many
[1:05:05] wives right she's the one that had too
[1:05:08] many
[1:05:10] husbands all
[1:05:14] right but now when the polygamy came
[1:05:16] into
[1:05:18] being a man could have more than one
[1:05:20] wife and everything was
[1:05:24] wonderful but what if the woman had more
[1:05:27] than one
[1:05:31] husband right y with no playgrounds or
[1:05:35] no titty
[1:05:38] tattering there
[1:05:40] death so now what kind of a covenant you
[1:05:43] want to put
[1:05:47] under see I'm just trying to make you
[1:05:51] and I come to a realization
[1:05:56] that we don't
[1:05:58] know most of the time what we're talking
[1:06:06] about did that hit
[1:06:10] home they go over your
[1:06:13] head you show it
[1:06:18] back what do you think we've been around
[1:06:20] here 40 something years for amen
[1:06:23] right I think that self EXP the door
[1:06:26] don't
[1:06:29] you but now
[1:06:34] listen if God could break the opening of
[1:06:37] the seals to you and
[1:06:40] I and by that opening of the seals to
[1:06:43] you and
[1:06:45] I bring to us a revelation of marriage
[1:06:49] and
[1:06:51] divorce don't you think that would be
[1:06:53] where it would come from
[1:06:56] and we can see
[1:06:58] it and follow it right through the word
[1:07:03] amen and have the ability to walk off
[1:07:06] this Earth as Free
[1:07:10] People brother Dale what are you talking
[1:07:13] about in plain
[1:07:17] language if this man that you're looking
[1:07:19] at cannot be conquered by the man that's
[1:07:23] inside of him right I am
[1:07:27] gravebound
[1:07:31] right the Rapture is not an automatic
[1:07:33] process of out run out time running
[1:07:36] out right I thought your Prophet said
[1:07:39] page 14 I believe it is of the Rapture
[1:07:42] he said the Rapture is a revelation amen
[1:07:45] right on in there somewhere he says a
[1:07:46] bride will be waiting for the revelation
[1:07:48] of the Rapture that's right amen so it's
[1:07:52] dealing with Revelation not intellect
[1:07:54] amen that's right
[1:07:56] not words on a page that's
[1:07:58] right right
[1:08:03] yes so now sorry to do it but let's back
[1:08:06] up let's go over over brother
[1:08:10] uhu I think brother Bob's back there
[1:08:12] today brother Anderson out here they
[1:08:14] taking it time about now they're doing
[1:08:16] all right go over to paragraph 194 and
[1:08:18] let's start we'll start on number eight
[1:08:20] and this is going to be a long reading
[1:08:27] he's preached
[1:08:29] 1965 221 the morning service marriage
[1:08:32] and divorce one paragraph 194 through
[1:08:35] about 2002 or three now notice now after
[1:08:39] the beginning after the beginning After
[1:08:41] Time begin back in that was eternity it
[1:08:43] was
[1:08:44] over back in that was eternity it over
[1:08:47] notice after that fall was made by Eve
[1:08:50] after the fall there was need to be
[1:08:53] another Covenant made now this is going
[1:08:55] to stumble you a little but I'm going to
[1:08:57] give you the scripture to prove that
[1:08:59] this is the truth now notice after the
[1:09:02] fall Jesus said God at the beginning
[1:09:06] made one of a kind but now after the
[1:09:09] fall now we're going beyond that the
[1:09:12] Covenant was co-equal but now after the
[1:09:14] fall there is another covenant made now
[1:09:17] she was no longer a ruler with
[1:09:20] him you reading each must have a
[1:09:23] separate covenant What did the put her
[1:09:26] he shall rule over thee right why
[1:09:30] because of her the way she
[1:09:33] done he said let's see if this is right
[1:09:35] let's go to Genesis 3 all
[1:09:38] right the Lord said unto the serpent now
[1:09:41] he's going to curse it the serpent right
[1:09:44] because thou Hast done this Thou Art
[1:09:46] cursed above all the cattle above every
[1:09:48] beast of the field and upon thy belly
[1:09:51] Thou shalt go and th shal thou eat all
[1:09:53] the days of thy life that's him
[1:09:56] I love it was it's injected
[1:10:00] right he ain't going to throw even Even
[1:10:02] Adam ain't cursed right if they was
[1:10:05] cursed you'd have to pull that scripture
[1:10:06] out
[1:10:10] right are you spiritual enough to
[1:10:12] understand what I'm saying if they was
[1:10:14] cursed to death in a point of Eternity
[1:10:18] or something they was cursed to death in
[1:10:21] the
[1:10:22] natural and to have rules and
[1:10:24] regulations of of
[1:10:27] earth
[1:10:29] right I put IM between thy seed between
[1:10:33] thee and the woman between thy seed and
[1:10:34] the woman's seed it shall bruise thy
[1:10:36] head and th shall bruise his heel the
[1:10:39] promising coming through the woman the
[1:10:41] Messiah to
[1:10:43] redeem now look now there is the
[1:10:45] Covenant with the serpent which they
[1:10:47] were all right
[1:10:50] beforehand was nothing wrong with a
[1:10:53] serpent at the beginning
[1:10:55] are before the beginning the serpent was
[1:10:58] okay
[1:11:00] right until he was
[1:11:03] used all right now so then he comes down
[1:11:07] to Adam he turns
[1:11:10] and unto the woman I will greatly
[1:11:12] multiply thy sorrows and thy conception
[1:11:14] and the sorrow shall thou bring forth
[1:11:17] children and th Desir shall be to thy
[1:11:19] husband and he shall rule over thee no
[1:11:22] more co-equal together at all
[1:11:27] now she has turned right around and
[1:11:29] she's the
[1:11:33] ruler now he'll rule over thee one
[1:11:38] Covenant he'll rule over thee sorrow and
[1:11:41] things will be her problem
[1:11:45] y right
[1:11:48] y because she's no more
[1:11:50] coequal then he turns to Adam because
[1:11:53] thou has hearkened to the voice of thy
[1:11:54] wife and has eaten of the tree of which
[1:11:57] I commanded thee saying Thou shalt not
[1:11:59] eat it cursed be the ground not cursed
[1:12:03] Adam cursed be the ground for thy sake
[1:12:06] there's no Eternal
[1:12:08] separations involved in that curse right
[1:12:12] but there is physical covenants to be
[1:12:15] made right I keep emphasizing that
[1:12:18] because that's what the Lord showed me
[1:12:20] the other day when he
[1:12:21] was fishing and riding up down the road
[1:12:24] and doing
[1:12:26] you see sometimes I I do that and it
[1:12:28] just clears your mind enough to get you
[1:12:29] to
[1:12:30] thinking and then I begin to think and I
[1:12:33] Lord I got to answer this
[1:12:37] question somebody's going to ask
[1:12:40] it and what's your
[1:12:48] answer why did Eve do like she done Lord
[1:12:51] was she made some kind of a horrible
[1:12:53] thing he says no
[1:12:57] she was made a freeo
[1:12:59] agent she Choice her choice took her
[1:13:02] that
[1:13:03] away what's the
[1:13:06] covenants the Covenant is with Eve that
[1:13:09] she's going to Bear children showing
[1:13:12] what the physical happening of the thing
[1:13:14] and eating instead of eating an apple if
[1:13:16] it' been eating an apple it said Eve's
[1:13:17] going to have
[1:13:19] bellyaches no it didn't say that it said
[1:13:21] your curse will be upon your wound and
[1:13:24] brother around and said said not by not
[1:13:26] do I mean by doing that Jesus had to
[1:13:28] come by the wom right that's another
[1:13:30] quote but it's all
[1:13:34] right but
[1:13:38] Adam you went with this thing on so
[1:13:42] y but your curse is that you're going to
[1:13:45] be working for a
[1:13:49] living we'll get to it in a
[1:13:52] minute and uh
[1:13:55] when I was in the Baptist Church the old
[1:13:57] Deacon we were sitting there in the
[1:13:58] deacons meeting one night and we were
[1:14:00] talking about you know having too many
[1:14:04] wives and this one old Deacon he
[1:14:08] says that's where I just don't believe
[1:14:10] in that old
[1:14:15] polygamy course he was senior
[1:14:18] Deacon nobody didn't correct him we just
[1:14:22] all sniggered yeah
[1:14:25] that's not exactly the way it's
[1:14:26] pronounced but you
[1:14:29] know what you think about Adam
[1:14:35] now you eat of the ground it commanded
[1:14:38] this the ground is going to bring forth
[1:14:40] the sorrow you're going to do this and
[1:14:42] you're going to return to the dust where
[1:14:44] you come from you're going all these
[1:14:45] things going to happen to you atam and
[1:14:47] said after it runs a little while I'm
[1:14:49] going to make it even harder on you yeah
[1:14:53] because you're going to wind up with
[1:14:54] more than one wife and you going to have
[1:14:55] to have two
[1:14:58] jobs poor old David
[1:15:02] 700 Solomon a
[1:15:11] thousand I don't need to say
[1:15:15] anymore that's
[1:15:17] right I remember an old movie years ago
[1:15:20] I was seeing way back there was a in
[1:15:22] Africa and this old chief of the tribe
[1:15:24] you know
[1:15:25] they had you know they believed in
[1:15:27] polygamy there and the guy answered
[1:15:31] asked the chief said Chief said I notice
[1:15:33] said y'all believe in polygamy don't you
[1:15:35] and he said yeah yeah said but I notice
[1:15:37] said you don't have but one
[1:15:39] wife said why is that true he said my
[1:15:43] wife don't like that
[1:15:46] idea
[1:15:47] so I think that's a good
[1:15:50] point all
[1:15:53] right but now not cursed Adam not cursed
[1:16:00] Eve just conditions right now I'm trying
[1:16:05] to get that word into you to think about
[1:16:08] what I'm
[1:16:10] saying two covenants
[1:16:13] yep not about
[1:16:16] salvations
[1:16:17] right but about
[1:16:20] life and living and doing
[1:16:29] now I'm facing a more horrible point to
[1:16:32] explain when I get to it a little
[1:16:33] further down the
[1:16:36] road but
[1:16:39] yet in the New Testament there's no such
[1:16:42] thing as
[1:16:47] polygamy is it one about Christ and the
[1:16:49] church well what about it she might all
[1:16:50] to wait till I get
[1:16:53] there and I hope it time I get there
[1:16:55] I'll have the right
[1:16:57] answer got part of it
[1:17:00] right all right and it'll work we get on
[1:17:04] that other side it's not going to be
[1:17:06] David with a th000 wives or
[1:17:10] 700 we get on the other
[1:17:16] side because if it is you'd have you
[1:17:18] fall still in
[1:17:20] existence all right let's go to
[1:17:22] paragraph 198 and roll that up let's
[1:17:23] read
[1:17:26] two covenants now that closes the
[1:17:29] beginning of what Jesus said it wasn't
[1:17:31] so in the beginning we got another
[1:17:33] Covenant now notice it's another
[1:17:34] Covenant now there's a covenant for the
[1:17:36] product and a covenant for the
[1:17:38] byproduct now notice to fall brought
[1:17:41] trouble death every creature of the
[1:17:44] creation making a difference in all
[1:17:48] nature lock that in making a difference
[1:17:51] in nature cuz it makes a difference in
[1:17:52] the nature of the man the nature of the
[1:17:54] woman the nature of the dog the nature
[1:17:56] of the female the
[1:17:58] male but from the beginning it wasn't
[1:18:01] so now it is not so from it is now it is
[1:18:05] after the beginning now there's a double
[1:18:08] Covenant first it was just a covenant
[1:18:10] Adam and Eve was co-equal one man and
[1:18:12] one woman now the woman sinned and what
[1:18:15] does she do that drove them all to death
[1:18:18] and God had to make a covenant by that
[1:18:22] another Covenant here it is right here
[1:18:24] here in Genesis
[1:18:30] 3:16 now we just read Genesis
[1:18:35] 3:16 about 13-
[1:18:41] 16 of what it was said to
[1:18:44] Eve and her Covenant he'll rule over
[1:18:49] thee your desire to be to
[1:18:52] him but to Adam
[1:18:57] just Adam you going to have to
[1:19:00] work not going to curse neither one of
[1:19:02] you to death and going just put you
[1:19:04] under a situation of
[1:19:06] life and you're going to live that
[1:19:11] way first it was a covenant Adam and Eve
[1:19:15] was co-equal one man one woman now the
[1:19:17] woman sinned and what does she do that
[1:19:19] drove them all to death and God had to
[1:19:21] make a covenant by that another Covenant
[1:19:23] here it is right here in Genesis 3:16 he
[1:19:26] made another Covenant okay read Genesis
[1:19:29] 3:16 again the world is to be
[1:19:32] repopulated not by the original creation
[1:19:35] of God like in the beginning not by the
[1:19:37] original creation but by sex
[1:19:40] desire now
[1:19:44] follow now that takes care of the
[1:19:47] beginning doesn't it in the beginning
[1:19:49] there was one only one man and one woman
[1:19:52] one male and one female but when she
[1:19:54] crossed that line and brought this sin
[1:19:57] now the world is to be repopulated again
[1:19:59] by sex not by creation by sex see where
[1:20:02] the woman is at
[1:20:04] now now but that's the way the world is
[1:20:09] populated
[1:20:10] today through women right that's the
[1:20:14] reason Jesus had to come through the
[1:20:15] woman to bring it back to the original
[1:20:17] beginning exactly right without sex
[1:20:20] desire all right roll it on up a little
[1:20:27] now you see then after the beginning it
[1:20:29] was something else was
[1:20:32] introduced then when the double Covenant
[1:20:34] was made by man and
[1:20:36] woman through SE another Covenant all
[1:20:41] together not the original Covenant but
[1:20:43] another
[1:20:44] Covenant now brings
[1:20:47] what introduc now now what's
[1:20:51] introduced polygamy
[1:20:58] in all after the beginning P was
[1:21:01] introduced both in man and in Beast
[1:21:03] after the beginning to fall secondarily
[1:21:06] it it's a new
[1:21:08] nature Again by Sex God created the
[1:21:11] first without sex do you believe that
[1:21:13] congregation says amen that's another
[1:21:15] Covenant with
[1:21:17] nature but you're supposed to be women
[1:21:19] what we men are supposed to be he sets
[1:21:22] it in another order by next second
[1:21:26] Covenant one male
[1:21:28] many
[1:21:34] females now if you'll
[1:21:40] notice he's dealing with the Covenant
[1:21:42] with the
[1:21:47] woman bringing her under the
[1:21:50] position of
[1:22:00] subjection then you got a
[1:22:03] covenant two of
[1:22:06] them one with a
[1:22:09] man that he can have more than one
[1:22:12] wife if he does it
[1:22:16] correctly we'll get to that later not to
[1:22:19] just anything or happening what it's got
[1:22:22] to be correct
[1:22:29] he's supposed to marry a
[1:22:33] virgin number
[1:22:37] one or as I said this morning about
[1:22:39] David and
[1:22:42] Abigail David you know her husband was
[1:22:44] dead right that made it legal for David
[1:22:48] to marry
[1:22:50] her we get into the preachers about
[1:22:53] those things and it's not even illegal
[1:22:54] that way for them but we'll try to hold
[1:23:02] off now you got polygamy
[1:23:08] involved now I ask you another
[1:23:13] question
[1:23:17] uh if
[1:23:20] polygamy means for male or female
[1:23:25] which some of you probably looked up in
[1:23:26] your Websters and you found out it does
[1:23:31] apply but if polygamy is
[1:23:35] okay for male and female look what a
[1:23:38] trouble you
[1:23:42] got well then polygamy is not legal for
[1:23:45] the
[1:23:52] female I said while too
[1:23:55] David have a thousand wies but one of
[1:23:58] them women she has another husband her
[1:24:00] Co throats get cut she's
[1:24:04] dead because that ain't the
[1:24:09] Covenant under the double Covenant it
[1:24:11] was not made that they would be standing
[1:24:13] there as okay for the woman okay for the
[1:24:15] man
[1:24:19] uh-uh only okay for the man
[1:24:26] he said brother Dale I looked up
[1:24:27] polygamy I'm glad you
[1:24:33] did because you'll come to realization
[1:24:36] of wording
[1:24:38] then go ahead and pull it up brother on
[1:24:43] polygamy is from Wikipedia
[1:24:55] polygamy is a late Greek
[1:24:59] word meaning many
[1:25:02] married that's what it means many
[1:25:06] married one it's a it's a marriage which
[1:25:09] includes more than two
[1:25:12] partners so you'd say well not for
[1:25:14] either
[1:25:15] one now I said while ago I've got the
[1:25:19] Bible what do you got you got his
[1:25:22] definitions and their answers but I got
[1:25:24] the
[1:25:26] Bible polygamy in the Old Testament was
[1:25:29] legal for the
[1:25:31] man
[1:25:32] right there was no legality in the Old
[1:25:36] Testament for the woman to have more
[1:25:39] than one
[1:25:41] husband give me
[1:25:44] scripture probably a lot of them did
[1:25:48] have but I'm not saying that
[1:25:52] now well it could be for one okay well
[1:25:55] let's see what it is so now we'll just
[1:25:56] break it down we'll let these old boys
[1:25:59] break it when a man is married to more
[1:26:02] than one wife at a time the relationship
[1:26:06] is
[1:26:08] called p l y g y n
[1:26:13] y you want to call that
[1:26:15] polygamy or you want to call it polygamy
[1:26:18] or what do you want to call it I don't
[1:26:19] know how to pronounce it I know how to
[1:26:21] spell it
[1:26:25] but watch in that form of
[1:26:29] relationship of more than one wife they
[1:26:32] even say and there is no marriage bond
[1:26:37] between the
[1:26:39] wives
[1:26:42] right no marriage bond
[1:26:45] see between the wives
[1:26:50] right well because every one of David's
[1:26:52] wife was his wife singular right
[1:26:55] right each one was his wife singular
[1:26:59] right we'll get back to more on it
[1:27:01] Sunday around
[1:27:04] said he could have more than one wife
[1:27:06] but said there's no way she could have
[1:27:09] more than one husband right no
[1:27:15] way and see if you did do it there's no
[1:27:18] bond between the wives right you know in
[1:27:22] other words there not nothing con and
[1:27:24] when a woman is married to more than one
[1:27:27] husband at the time it is called p o l y
[1:27:32] a n d y probably Andrea Andrea or
[1:27:37] something and there is no bond between
[1:27:39] the husbands right
[1:27:44] see
[1:27:47] yeah if a marriage includes multiple
[1:27:50] husbands and wives
[1:27:54] yeah it can be called group
[1:27:56] marriage what they say that's a
[1:28:01] problem it goes into social and
[1:28:04] psychological social stff all right
[1:28:07] polygamy is the practice of a person's
[1:28:10] practice of a persons making him herself
[1:28:14] available for two or more
[1:28:16] spouses to make with see they still want
[1:28:19] to keep that idea of polygamy for either
[1:28:21] one but it does give you an explanation
[1:28:24] now this is what I
[1:28:27] like
[1:28:33] Monami money gam is a marriage
[1:28:36] considered of only two parties
[1:28:40] man
[1:28:41] right not to men
[1:28:46] right not to women amen two partners you
[1:28:50] know male and female yeah all right
[1:28:59] huh it says it's generally there because
[1:29:02] the term is often used no matter because
[1:29:05] whether it's recognized by the
[1:29:06] governance or not all
[1:29:08] [Music]
[1:29:10] right
[1:29:12] now monogamia is more or less
[1:29:16] singular right whereas polygamy is more
[1:29:19] or less
[1:29:20] plural all right see that's why we
[1:29:23] believe in one true and living God
[1:29:27] right
[1:29:29] monotheism yes sir is what one God
[1:29:33] worship of one
[1:29:36] God singular right all
[1:29:43] polytheism more than one
[1:29:45] God so I hope you're tying that together
[1:29:48] it's what I said I got the Bible whether
[1:29:49] you you think I'm what I'm crazy anyway
[1:29:52] that's all right but
[1:29:57] see we say well polygamy can be either
[1:29:59] way that's the words of
[1:30:02] terminologies but there was no way in
[1:30:04] the Old Testament for a woman to have
[1:30:06] more than one husband
[1:30:08] no that's right she was killed in a
[1:30:18] hurry and if you don't understand this
[1:30:21] and can't follow it correctly get away
[1:30:23] from your male chish Pig's idea what
[1:30:27] that words are for this modern day that
[1:30:29] you think the man is the honcho muncho
[1:30:32] all kind of this that and the other you
[1:30:33] know and he's degrading the wife the
[1:30:35] Bible doesn't do
[1:30:37] that the Bible places it in order
[1:30:42] right right gives the woman a
[1:30:47] place he wasn't made wrong he made
[1:30:49] beautiful
[1:30:51] Perfect Right placed in the garden
[1:30:54] what would it have been had she stayed
[1:30:56] where she was
[1:31:02] right you see but it messed it
[1:31:06] up down through the Old Testament a
[1:31:08] woman was just like
[1:31:10] a we called it the other day you know
[1:31:12] maybe a hamburger and compared with the
[1:31:14] Porter House steak is the man but they
[1:31:17] really thought of him a whole lot less
[1:31:18] than
[1:31:19] that because they were
[1:31:22] just you know
[1:31:25] anything y a lot of the foreign
[1:31:27] countries they don't want girls born
[1:31:29] they want boys right right they
[1:31:34] don't see it's involved in
[1:31:38] everything brought down to a point of
[1:31:41] seeing what it
[1:31:46] is
[1:31:48] that David could have more than one
[1:31:52] wife because of the
[1:31:59] Fall you say did God
[1:32:02] make lamage have two wives
[1:32:09] no but he was the first man that wound
[1:32:11] up with two
[1:32:15] wives did God
[1:32:17] decide after these things happened of
[1:32:21] the fall and the de generation of
[1:32:24] humanity that he would finally do
[1:32:26] something about it and he would do a
[1:32:27] certain way um I don't believe that way
[1:32:31] right I believe in him being almighty
[1:32:34] God that he knew before the world ever
[1:32:36] begun that if he placed Us in the garden
[1:32:39] with a free moral agency no matter how
[1:32:41] Hood Duty good we think we
[1:32:44] are if it had been you and me there we'd
[1:32:46] have failed just as much as Adam need
[1:32:49] probably a little quicker
[1:32:54] so then it's not crowing for
[1:32:58] anybody it's finding the truth
[1:33:04] right so because of the Fall that Eve
[1:33:07] done it caused the
[1:33:11] fall then the sway went to her side to
[1:33:14] seeing
[1:33:17] that it was placed upon her the burden
[1:33:20] right
[1:33:26] right bearing
[1:33:29] children and
[1:33:33] things having more than one
[1:33:38] husband not being vulgar n comical
[1:33:41] brother Brown was the one that said
[1:33:43] it he said David had 700 wives he said
[1:33:46] he had over a 100 children in one year
[1:34:00] right so you know a lot of his wives
[1:34:03] never saw him after they got married the
[1:34:04] first
[1:34:08] night
[1:34:12] right but you know if she' went out and
[1:34:15] had her another husband she was
[1:34:20] dead so there is a Sor to you sisters
[1:34:23] right
[1:34:25] do you see the polygamy and what I'm
[1:34:27] talking about
[1:34:31] yes they have a wedding day and he
[1:34:33] probably sees her no more for a
[1:34:35] year she has to live that year and what
[1:34:38] if she didn't get pregnant she left a
[1:34:39] year without it you
[1:34:41] know but then if she did get pregnant
[1:34:43] she got one year taking care of a child
[1:34:46] and you
[1:34:48] know just being natural just
[1:34:52] talking try to be
[1:34:58] sensible the sorrow is th sisters and it
[1:35:00] placed upon you because of what you done
[1:35:06] right there's no greater Jewel David who
[1:35:09] was it David or Solomon said that a bad
[1:35:11] woman was like Watering your blood to
[1:35:13] kill you he said but there's no greater
[1:35:15] thing and Prophet would say that there's
[1:35:17] no greater thing that God could give you
[1:35:20] outside of Salvation as a good wife
[1:35:22] that's right right
[1:35:24] amen a good wife see that can become one
[1:35:29] with you
[1:35:33] amen you see make that bond with
[1:35:37] you and raise children and have a happy
[1:35:41] time together
[1:35:46] amen there is no polygamy in the New
[1:35:48] Testament
[1:35:55] all right got a lot of scriptures wrote
[1:35:58] down for
[1:35:59] Wednesday don't want to try to get to it
[1:36:07] now but because of you and what you're
[1:36:11] doing sisters he said I didn't do
[1:36:16] it no but it's still being
[1:36:22] done because of the Fall it fell because
[1:36:25] of your gr your your people just like I
[1:36:27] said the animals why did it be that the
[1:36:32] animals
[1:36:34] would wind up and be
[1:36:37] under you know be used as an animal
[1:36:41] sacrifice because the animal was used to
[1:36:43] be the
[1:36:44] fall the natural thing of the
[1:36:48] Beast is God unrighteous for doing those
[1:36:51] things like that
[1:36:54] or is he righteous in that he would find
[1:36:56] a
[1:36:58] sacrifice which way do you
[1:37:01] think he's unrighteous to take the life
[1:37:03] of an animal I like what Rabbi Richmond
[1:37:06] I believe it was said that time he said
[1:37:08] when you think about the animal laying
[1:37:10] on the altar he said you don't think of
[1:37:13] how horrible it is to kill the animal
[1:37:16] said but you think of
[1:37:18] how wonderful and gracious God has
[1:37:21] accepted the animal for you
[1:37:26] changes the death doesn't
[1:37:28] it to think of how that it can take away
[1:37:31] your
[1:37:32] doing all
[1:37:37] right but I want to go to one thing
[1:37:39] before we get back into Wednesdays and
[1:37:40] I'll try to explain something right
[1:37:45] here remember in the garden the first
[1:37:48] thing was the problem with Eve in her
[1:37:51] mind right right
[1:37:55] then the natural act took
[1:37:59] place Paul said that he was a scared
[1:38:02] that Satan through his
[1:38:04] subtility would be able to what right
[1:38:06] now in Lula Georgia
[1:38:08] see
[1:38:11] 2013 would be able
[1:38:14] to penetrate your
[1:38:17] mind deceive
[1:38:21] you and turn you away from the
[1:38:26] Simplicity that is in
[1:38:29] Christ see Satan's right here now more
[1:38:32] than ever
[1:38:33] before talking and deceiving
[1:38:36] us so you see what happened in the
[1:38:41] garden now Heaven Help
[1:38:46] me what happened in the garden
[1:38:49] was God allowing
[1:38:57] Satan
[1:38:59] to be able to do the way he done
[1:39:06] right are you following me he didn't
[1:39:08] make him do
[1:39:10] it but he permitted him to do it he
[1:39:13] allowed it to come into being amen
[1:39:16] because of our free agency in what he
[1:39:18] knew that's right remember there was a
[1:39:21] battle in heaven before it ever come to
[1:39:23] Earth
[1:39:23] earth
[1:39:26] right sin didn't originate as your that
[1:39:29] what your Prophet said it didn't
[1:39:30] originate on Earth it originated in
[1:39:32] heaven
[1:39:33] [Music]
[1:39:34] right see God
[1:39:37] permitted that
[1:39:39] sin of
[1:39:41] Heaven to drop down upon
[1:39:46] Earth and start
[1:39:52] perverting now if I didn't believe it
[1:39:54] that
[1:39:57] way I would have drastic
[1:40:01] trouble with believing in polygamy and
[1:40:04] the animal
[1:40:06] kingdom I can understand the point of
[1:40:09] polygamy into the human Kingdom because
[1:40:11] of her Fallen condition it made
[1:40:16] her into one condition under one
[1:40:20] Covenant that she could never have but
[1:40:22] to one husband
[1:40:24] it made him to where he could have more
[1:40:26] than one
[1:40:31] wife but do you understand about the
[1:40:36] animals do you think the animals were
[1:40:38] standing looking to see what Humanity
[1:40:43] done and then they just followed after
[1:40:46] it I don't go that way
[1:40:51] right that's why this got to be one day
[1:40:56] an eternal Holy
[1:40:59] Fire to come down on this Earth to
[1:41:03] cleanse
[1:41:04] everything and cleanse every demon
[1:41:07] cleanse every
[1:41:10] germ and destroy it every bit
[1:41:15] right right it's got to be thank God
[1:41:21] Amen because what happened
[1:41:23] when man
[1:41:25] sinned it not only brought the polygamy
[1:41:28] in the human
[1:41:32] race that same Spirit
[1:41:39] right that caused to fall in the
[1:41:42] beginning with man and woman and brought
[1:41:44] polygamy into
[1:41:48] being that same Spirit was released upon
[1:41:51] the human being
[1:41:58] you say scripture brother
[1:42:01] T the serpent was the most sub to the
[1:42:04] long Beast right
[1:42:06] right the serpent did have a
[1:42:10] relationship with
[1:42:12] Eve the Beast right
[1:42:16] there because of that penetrating of her
[1:42:20] mind by Satan and the releasing of those
[1:42:22] demons
[1:42:24] that bombarded her
[1:42:28] continually what is it now that bombards
[1:42:30] our
[1:42:32] minds that's right
[1:42:35] that's and it was bad enough about 1948
[1:42:39] somewhere in
[1:42:42] there brother brandham covers where
[1:42:44] there was 200,000,000 demons that was
[1:42:46] under Hitler and Ian and them to drive
[1:42:48] the Jews to the Homeland he said was
[1:42:50] released not on the Jews
[1:42:53] on the bride that's
[1:42:56] right am I right right Amen to drive you
[1:43:01] and I to the word of the
[1:43:03] hour right cuz there's no hopes outside
[1:43:06] of
[1:43:08] it so you see the answer to why did the
[1:43:11] animals fall into the
[1:43:13] polygamy because there was a spirit
[1:43:18] released a spirit of polygamy
[1:43:25] a spirit of one buck and many
[1:43:33] do but that old Buck he's fighting all
[1:43:36] the time to keep off them little Young
[1:43:37] Bucks and them old bucks away from his
[1:43:40] herd
[1:43:44] right you know what gets trophy deer
[1:43:50] killed yeah trophy do like guess pretty
[1:43:54] good
[1:43:55] work big old
[1:44:00] do that are looking for not just one
[1:44:03] looking for anyone they can
[1:44:05] find that's right
[1:44:10] right see polygamy is a spirit
[1:44:14] folks adultery is a spirit fornication
[1:44:18] is a spirit
[1:44:24] now back in the early 20s and 30s
[1:44:26] women's dress used to be real
[1:44:28] short ever seen the pictures of them you
[1:44:31] don't know that was no no you better go
[1:44:33] on back right before the depression go
[1:44:35] back and look their dresses had started
[1:44:38] coming up
[1:44:39] drastically but when the Depression hit
[1:44:42] see that was a spirit among the
[1:44:47] women then the Depression
[1:44:50] hit dresses went down
[1:44:56] right cuz they wanted to straighten up
[1:44:58] and get right because it's hungry and
[1:45:01] they needed something they needed but
[1:45:04] then shortly after the
[1:45:06] Depression things started going up you
[1:45:08] know what went up girls dresses women's
[1:45:10] dresses started going
[1:45:16] up all these things we talk about is
[1:45:19] Spirits amen demons
[1:45:25] that's loose on the
[1:45:32] bride where did all these preachers get
[1:45:34] all these ideas
[1:45:36] from and the
[1:45:39] doctrines when a lot of them ain't even
[1:45:43] sensible right right I mean ain't even
[1:45:48] sensible you got two Lords you got to
[1:45:50] have two Gods you have a God for each
[1:45:51] soul
[1:45:55] I don't have no education I got that
[1:45:56] much
[1:45:58] sense
[1:46:01] Spirits hovering among people
[1:46:05] right back there when the the two Soul
[1:46:07] Doctrine started coming
[1:46:09] out people would say I've been waiting
[1:46:12] on this all my life I knew there was
[1:46:14] something about the soul and this is
[1:46:16] what I've been waiting
[1:46:20] on and the author of it went to bed with
[1:46:22] a bunch of young
[1:46:25] girls but you know today they still
[1:46:27] don't believe that
[1:46:30] happened

[1:48:52] you're going to heaven now for killing a
[1:48:54] bunch of
[1:48:57] people and you're going to get 70
[1:49:01] virgins but I never did read what the
[1:49:03] girl gets when she died I guess it's 70
[1:49:05] men I never did know that never could
[1:49:07] find that answer that's a spirit
[1:49:12] right and like my wife said the other
[1:49:15] day about it we were talking some of us
[1:49:16] right down the road she said if somebody
[1:49:18] come along to me and said well hey you
[1:49:20] know you need to go out here and strap
[1:49:22] this bomb on you and blow them up so
[1:49:25] she'd say you put the bomb on I'll
[1:49:27] follow
[1:49:29] you that ends the discussion don't it
[1:49:33] cuz them guys is telling you how to do
[1:49:35] it are not the ones getting blowed
[1:49:37] up but how dumb you can
[1:49:41] be but a
[1:49:45] spirit let's go a little closer the
[1:49:48] Bible said in the last days there would
[1:49:50] be a spirit among the people
[1:49:56] released that they'd kill you thinking
[1:49:58] they're doing God a
[1:50:00] service is that
[1:50:02] scripture is that's what happening out
[1:50:04] there
[1:50:05] now they think it's doing their God of
[1:50:08] service by destroying
[1:50:11] you
[1:50:14] Spirits I hope that's caught on what I'm
[1:50:17] what my point was reading to bring it
[1:50:19] why that there was polygamy in the
[1:50:20] animal kingdom because once that spirit
[1:50:22] was released upon mankind it goes out
[1:50:25] onto
[1:50:31] everything when it went out on
[1:50:33] everything it went right into that
[1:50:34] female Kingdom of the
[1:50:37] animals and like I told
[1:50:40] you a boy bear mate with a female few
[1:50:45] months after she has the baby he'll go
[1:50:48] and kill his own baby his own offspring
[1:50:51] that he's
[1:50:52] brought forth by her to try to bring her
[1:50:55] into
[1:50:58] receptiveness you think that
[1:51:01] is it's a
[1:51:04] spirit not all of them don't do it just
[1:51:07] certain
[1:51:10] ones we here in the South they're
[1:51:12] familiar with
[1:51:14] squirrels you know that a boy squirrel a
[1:51:17] boy squirrel an old one will crawl in
[1:51:20] the nest of the babies that he has
[1:51:22] brought forth by the female and he will
[1:51:26] neuter
[1:51:31] them because he don't want no
[1:51:35] competition
[1:51:38] Spirits where do those animals get those
[1:51:42] ideas that's my
[1:51:45] point polygamy and the animals they get
[1:51:47] their idea from Spirits that are
[1:51:49] released cuz that's the same thing that
[1:51:51] happened to man yeah so you get over to
[1:51:54] the fourth chapter read your Bible you
[1:51:55] get over fourth chapter before you're
[1:51:56] dealing with anybody that's got two
[1:51:58] wives and then I don't even know where
[1:52:00] that that anywhere after then um if you
[1:52:04] went scripturally you would go to
[1:52:07] Abraham and Abraham and Sarah
[1:52:10] and the things I'm sure there was many
[1:52:12] more before then because it had said it
[1:52:14] there in Genesis that the sons of God
[1:52:17] saw the daughters of men and it took
[1:52:18] unto them wives the original says
[1:52:24] women the original translation says
[1:52:29] women so there was polygamy already
[1:52:31] getting
[1:52:33] started you think Spirits don't bother
[1:52:39] you if they don't bother you pray for
[1:52:48] me why
[1:52:49] because they're here to pull us away
[1:52:52] from the
[1:52:55] word and why is it that a man will start
[1:52:57] preaching it's like the two soul man I
[1:53:00] had contact with him in his beginning
[1:53:03] and even read the book they put out
[1:53:06] where he
[1:53:07] said I don't believe in doing this and I
[1:53:10] never will have more than one
[1:53:13] wife of course he
[1:53:17] didn't he just started dealing with
[1:53:19] young girls
[1:53:24] and would you like for young your little
[1:53:26] young daughters for some jack lag
[1:53:29] preacher standing up pull pit to take
[1:53:32] your young kids and force them to marry
[1:53:35] into somebody
[1:53:38] else you said oh that's not in the
[1:53:40] message you need to get out a little bit
[1:53:43] right around yeah
[1:53:50] right what does it mean to would it make
[1:53:52] you happy cuz one of your little young
[1:53:55] girls would marry some old 70y old
[1:53:59] man
[1:54:01] Spirits are
[1:54:05] real those animals just fell under those
[1:54:07] Spirits
[1:54:10] right
[1:54:16] right what about it let's stand
[1:54:23] double
[1:54:25] Covenant bringing about
[1:54:29] polygamy polygamy is used under the Old
[1:54:31] Testament
[1:54:33] form to type Christ in the
[1:54:36] church we'll pick it up
[1:54:39] Wednesday when you come to Christ in the
[1:54:41] church you're back to where it didn't
[1:54:44] say
[1:54:46] to
[1:54:49] uh Joseph
[1:54:52] go get you another
[1:54:54] wife said go take your
[1:55:00] wife and how are you going to bring it
[1:55:02] together in Paul as his sayings that we
[1:55:05] become one how are you going to tie it
[1:55:07] together with Genesis that the two
[1:55:09] becomes
[1:55:11] one well listen know here are just many
[1:55:13] multiple
[1:55:16] things well that wouldn't in the garden
[1:55:24] where are we
[1:55:28] going what do you think about
[1:55:34] it you see folks in the old Bible times
[1:55:37] there was a lot of other things when a
[1:55:38] son would prophesy AE his daddy would
[1:55:41] just take him out and Mama and they'd
[1:55:42] kill
[1:55:46] him right that
[1:55:50] Bible New Testament they make him a
[1:55:52] preacher in the
[1:55:55] message he make he got a big
[1:56:01] following too old I'm sorry maybe I'm
[1:56:05] just too old an Old
[1:56:07] Goat but I'm still
[1:56:09] just I didn't have those doctrines when
[1:56:12] I was
[1:56:16] young the first time I preached marriage
[1:56:18] and divorce was probably about 1970
[1:56:22] I would have been 30 years old then and
[1:56:24] I preach just like I'm doing right
[1:56:29] now why because I know what Satan is
[1:56:33] doing I know his strength of what he's
[1:56:35] doing and how he tries to Captivate your
[1:56:40] mind see all he's got to do is just get
[1:56:43] you to think that brother Dale's got
[1:56:44] something against you that's all it
[1:56:49] takes and see then he'll keep pulling
[1:56:51] that train on you until he build it a
[1:56:54] big
[1:56:59] case I told you about brother Mo and I'd
[1:57:01] be riding down the road he'd be talking
[1:57:04] about the
[1:57:07] word something would tell me he said why
[1:57:10] don't you just drive off the road on his
[1:57:12] side of the car and run into a tree said
[1:57:17] you'll shed him
[1:57:18] up brother h
