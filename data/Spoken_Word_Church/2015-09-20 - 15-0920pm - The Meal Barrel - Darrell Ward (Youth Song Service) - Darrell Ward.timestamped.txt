[11:26] quick one yes it am I'll go as quick as
[11:29] I can turn on the PowerPoint
[11:31] please all
[11:34] right can y'all see that pretty
[11:37] good can you turn off the
[11:41] lights I can't see that at all all right
[11:44] that's a little better so this is my
[11:45] prayer closet 45 ton prayer
[11:49] closet I'll go ahead and skip to the end
[11:51] and tell you all the result the other
[11:52] day I had my first wreck and everybody
[11:55] turned out fine perfect perfectly fine
[11:58] by the grace of God
[12:00] but I got to give a long backstory to it
[12:02] I'll be as brief as I can but for you to
[12:04] understand the background here
[12:07] so um first off okay so what what
[12:11] happens is I I drive every day to work
[12:13] 15 minutes to work clock in get a truck
[12:15] get a trailer drive out to the farm back
[12:17] up to the chicken house this is just one
[12:18] of our typical farms in South Carolina
[12:20] all right we have a lot in South
[12:21] Carolina and North Georgia and all over
[12:24] I back up to the house the crew takes
[12:25] over from there loading the chickens
[12:27] onto the trailer with the hydrostatic
[12:29] loader the guys stand in the house they
[12:31] pick up the chickens load them in the
[12:32] cages now three big problems inherent
[12:35] danger dangers with driving these trucks
[12:37] is number one cages weigh 700 lb empty
[12:41] they're solid still so a loaded cage
[12:44] like the one can y'all see that that
[12:46] he's raising up on the truck ways about
[12:47] the weight of a small car 22 to 23 or
[12:50] 2400
[12:51] lb so I'm hauling from Georgia usually I
[12:55] haul about 20 cages at a time so I got
[12:57] about 20 cars plus the weight of my
[13:00] truck and trailer the other day when I
[13:02] had the wreck I weighed
[13:04] 86,500
[13:06] lb all right second problem we're not
[13:11] only heavy but we're very topheavy
[13:12] unlike conventional trailers you know
[13:14] like brother Joe Salas drives you know
[13:16] there's a in a box trailer usually the
[13:20] the load is sitting on pallets on the
[13:21] floor on the deck so it goes up to maybe
[13:23] yay high ours is distributed all the way
[13:26] up to the very top so we're extremely
[13:27] topheavy which means in a wreck if you
[13:29] swerve you're very likely to turn over
[13:32] problem number three these doors yall
[13:35] probably can't see that but each
[13:36] compartment there's 15 compartments on
[13:38] each
[13:39] cage and the doors only take about 5
[13:42] pounds of pressure to open it makes them
[13:44] easy to unload at the at the plant they
[13:46] set them on a hydraulic dumper turns the
[13:48] cage over the chickens fall out 5 lbs to
[13:50] open each door and there's 140 lbs of
[13:53] chickens behind each door so if you stop
[13:56] really hard chickens slide forward doors
[13:58] come open chickens go everywhere on the
[14:00] highway three big problems with driving
[14:02] these trucks it's okay if nobody pulls
[14:04] out in front of you all right well uh go
[14:08] on to the next slide please this is just
[14:10] a closer up view of the truck uh next
[14:14] slide so this is where the wreck
[14:16] happened the other day 7 miles north
[14:18] from here on Georgia
[14:21] 365 uh yall are familiar with Will Banks
[14:23] Road maybe some of y'all well just south
[14:26] of Baldwin the city of Baldwin there's a
[14:28] Dairy Queen
[14:29] on that side of the road this is
[14:30] southbound 365 Northbound just 7 miles
[14:33] north of here Dairy Queen's over here
[14:35] somewhere back over this way is the
[14:36] Hartford house and all that all right I
[14:38] was headed southbound on 365 at 65 M
[14:41] hour wearing weighing 86,500 lb a woman
[14:45] pulls off of will Banks Road this about
[14:48] 10:00 in the morning this past last
[14:50] Monday real light traffic it was after
[14:52] morning rush hour she comes across the
[14:55] Northbound Lanes with no problem crosses
[14:56] the Medan and you wouldn't think being
[14:59] that I'm right on her I'm right at the
[15:00] intersection that she would come in
[15:01] front of me but she
[15:03] did right smack dab to my Lane about 30
[15:07] to 40 feet ahead of me when I'm going 95
[15:10] ft per second so about 40 feet ahead
[15:13] ahead of me gives me less than half a
[15:14] second to
[15:16] react anybody ever had a
[15:18] wreck all right when you have a wreck
[15:21] this is my first one not speaking from a
[15:23] lot of experience but when you have a
[15:24] wreck a lot of times it's Instinct that
[15:26] takes over it's not you it's a Jesus
[15:27] take the will moment
[15:29] all right that was this type of moment
[15:31] I'm going to pause here and give you a
[15:32] quick other background there's two
[15:35] things i' always thought would happen if
[15:36] somebody pulled out front of me Point
[15:37] Blank either I would hit them which
[15:39] would either hang them up under my
[15:40] underc carriage and I drag them down the
[15:41] highway or they get under my truck
[15:43] because and I might run over them in
[15:45] pretty good ways or I'd knock them
[15:46] straight out a long ways either way it'd
[15:48] be detrimental for them option two be
[15:51] line for the
[15:52] ditch turn the wheel really hard trailer
[15:55] turns over on top of them that happened
[15:57] around brother around the time brother
[15:59] George Canada passed away some of you
[16:00] might remember that at the funeral home
[16:02] down the hall from Brother George Canada
[16:05] was I think a couple occupants of a Ford
[16:07] F-150 that was hit by one of our trucks
[16:09] also not a live Haul truck it was haul
[16:11] and frozen chicken he was going
[16:13] northbound on 365 southbound Ford F-150
[16:16] turned in front of him he hit him then
[16:18] he swerved instinctively turned his load
[16:20] of chickens over on top of him made them
[16:22] pancakes all right killed him so those
[16:25] aren't good options option C that I
[16:28] never ever thought of is
[16:30] Christ and here's what took
[16:33] over saw him in the southbound lane 65
[16:36] mil an hour she comes into my
[16:38] lane I had a half a second to react I
[16:40] didn't have time to honk didn't have
[16:42] time to Blink really had time to say oh
[16:45] my goodness with a stream of exclamation
[16:48] points behind it I got on the edge of my
[16:52] seat jabed the brake pedal and did a I
[16:55] never even knew about this maneuver God
[16:57] took over a sid step swerve that's the
[16:59] only thing I know to call it I Sid
[17:00] stepped about a half a lane and
[17:02] straightened back up in order to stay
[17:03] underneath my trailer so it wouldn't
[17:04] turn over on them I got into this right
[17:07] turning lane all right when I did that
[17:11] that was still enough to make the
[17:12] trailer oscillate like this it was still
[17:14] trying to turn over but by God's grace
[17:16] it didn't I hit
[17:18] her and you can't tell in this picture
[17:21] cuz this is after the wreck by the way
[17:23] you can't see any damage on my truck but
[17:25] here's the initial point of impact on my
[17:26] truck if I hadn't have Sid stepped it
[17:28] would have been
[17:29] here so the initial point of impact with
[17:31] her rearview mirror then her front
[17:34] quarter panel hit right here on my left
[17:36] steer Tire I chewed her all up right
[17:39] there and then she rubbed down this side
[17:41] and then that initial impact knocked her
[17:43] around this way she entered my Lane kind
[17:45] of at a angle like this I knocked around
[17:47] backwards in the back of her car hit my
[17:49] front drive axle on the outside tire and
[17:53] these uh steel step mounts for the
[17:56] aluminum uh fuel tank steps dug into the
[17:59] skin of her car really deep now then it
[18:04] shot her off onto towards the grass
[18:06] median here and I just at that time was
[18:09] just trying to stop and not turn over I
[18:10] finally came to a stop took me 500 ft or
[18:12] more about after the impact to
[18:15] stop and I see her wobbling out of the
[18:17] highway her car is wobbling over to the
[18:19] try to get over to the uh me to the
[18:21] shoulder to get out of traffic so I said
[18:24] well she's all right she got out she
[18:25] started walking around I said thank the
[18:26] Lord I got out started to check out my
[18:29] load you would think 300 C doors would
[18:31] be open that's how many doors we have is
[18:33] 300 there's 20 chickens behind each door
[18:35] about 6,000 chickens at a time you would
[18:37] think all of them would be open with me
[18:39] stopping that hard I locked up one of my
[18:41] tandems well I came to a stop checked
[18:43] all of them only one door out of 300 was
[18:46] open so trailer was upright no chickens
[18:49] Spilled Out they died several hours
[18:51] later but they survived the initial red
[18:54] okay they made it to their
[18:57] destination so then I thought well now I
[18:59] just hit somebody with a tractor trailer
[19:01] maybe I should check on her she's
[19:03] wandering around but still she might
[19:04] need medical attention so I I start the
[19:06] long walk back to her go to the next
[19:08] slide
[19:09] please this is just a little bit closer
[19:11] view that's after the repairs were made
[19:13] knocked off the oil Hub seal that right
[19:15] there and that was had to be replaced
[19:16] very minimal damage next
[19:18] slide and that's her car and the lady
[19:20] there now this is where I came to a stop
[19:23] I started this long walk first I was
[19:26] walking then I started to jog then I
[19:29] started to run because as I kept
[19:31] hollering for her I said later you okay
[19:33] you okay and she said uh she didn't even
[19:35] acknowledge me she was trying to get
[19:37] into this store in the
[19:38] back this is a truck driver's worst
[19:41] nightmare because after you just hit a
[19:42] car you don't want to think that there's
[19:43] a baby on board oh man I had just shut
[19:46] that door with a tractor trailer so it
[19:48] wasn't coming
[19:49] open that one wouldn't have done any
[19:51] good she runs around to the driver's
[19:53] side by this time I had run over here
[19:54] didn't even bother to talk to really
[19:56] anymore I just I just wanted to see if
[19:57] that baby was okay so I opened the back
[19:59] door and the pass on the left side got
[20:02] in there there's a little 19-month old
[20:05] beautiful baby boy in perfect shape not
[20:08] a scratch not a
[20:11] bruise
[20:12] and he wasn't crying he wasn't even
[20:15] whimpering he was looking around as if
[20:18] to say mama that was fun let's do it
[20:19] again you know he had that kind of look
[20:21] on his face a few minutes later he was
[20:23] playing peekaboo he said peoo peoo he's
[20:25] playing peekaboo with all of us standing
[20:27] around there
[20:29] so me and this lady Susan and her boy
[20:31] John Patrick we stood in the grass and
[20:33] got to Fellowship for the next couple
[20:34] hours my first question was well I
[20:37] wonder why you pulled out in front of me
[20:39] now you say you should have been mad at
[20:41] I wanted to hug them too because they
[20:42] should have been dead I was this close
[20:45] from looking at their dead bodies in
[20:46] this car and instead they're standing
[20:47] here in perfect shape wasn't a bit mad I
[20:50] just all I could kept saying was
[20:52] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I was
[20:54] speaking in tongues almost cuz she's
[20:56] alive both of them are alive so we we
[20:58] stood in the grass and talked for a
[20:59] while and my first question why don't
[21:00] you pull out in front of me just curious
[21:02] making conversation she said well I
[21:05] thought you in the right turning lane
[21:08] which is sensible most of us have
[21:09] misjudged the lane before even in broad
[21:11] daylight I told her lady just a few
[21:12] months ago I did the same thing I didn't
[21:14] get hit but I did that on our family
[21:16] vacation pulled out in front of somebody
[21:17] and P and forth CU I thought they were
[21:19] in a different
[21:20] Lane she's having off day she said I
[21:23] said what's what's the problem I going
[21:25] to tell you about this lady she came
[21:27] from California this the best I
[21:29] understand her story she came all the
[21:31] way from California to North Georgia or
[21:33] actually to South Georgia Albany where
[21:35] her grandson lives that boy that was
[21:37] with her is her grandson her daughter
[21:39] the boy's mom is in Lee Arendale prison
[21:42] the state prison she didn't never
[21:44] mention the dad I guess he's out of the
[21:46] picture so she come all way across the
[21:49] country like that brother like brother
[21:51] bam talked about that mother deer she's
[21:53] got a real mother instinct going all
[21:55] across the country no one she'll face
[21:56] dangerous not no one she get hit by a
[21:57] truck came all the way across the
[21:59] country to South Georgia to reside and
[22:01] and and raise this
[22:02] boy well that particular day she came up
[22:06] from South Georgia all the way up to
[22:07] leale prison to try to get some
[22:09] signatures from her daughter to get
[22:12] custody of that kid so she can raise him
[22:15] she didn't even get the the signatures
[22:17] the girl had gotten moved to a different
[22:18] facility I don't understand exactly what
[22:20] happened came all the way up here then
[22:21] to not get signatures and instead get
[22:23] hit by a truck furthermore she was lost
[22:26] because leale Prison is down there in
[22:28] Alto she's up here in Baldwin pulls out
[22:30] days confused lost distraught if that's
[22:33] not enough she just had a hernia surgery
[22:35] now she's facing another hernia surgery
[22:37] she said coming up so you're talking
[22:39] about problems that's the lady we need
[22:40] to pray for I mentioned her Wednesday
[22:41] night y'all be praying for Susan that's
[22:43] her name and at the end of it all when I
[22:48] parted ways with her stood here and I
[22:51] told her I said Susan you know you're
[22:53] going to think this weird I just me the
[22:54] lady I said Susan I love you you've got
[22:56] a real mother instinct you are a real
[22:58] mother and I
[23:00] said you rais up this boy and tell him
[23:02] about Jesus Christ the way that my
[23:04] grandmother did me and my mom you know
[23:07] there's about five mothers in my life
[23:08] that are very important to me and we
[23:11] named two of them named two of our kids
[23:12] after two of them sister June and my
[23:15] great- grandmother Ula that have had
[23:17] great influence on my life brother
[23:19] bandom said that mothers are the Fifth
[23:21] Gospel you know Matthew Martin Luke and
[23:22] John and mothers mothers I told this
[23:23] lady said you mothers can have an
[23:26] influence in little kids' Hearts like
[23:27] Rachel and uh Monica teaching those
[23:29] little ones in Sunday school they're
[23:30] perfect sister gaale teaching all those
[23:32] little ones you know when she used to
[23:34] because you have a place in their heart
[23:36] that nobody else can influence you know
[23:37] a father can influence them in different
[23:39] ways but you're their you know your Mo
[23:41] their mother and she began to break down
[23:45] and cry and she said I will there's one
[23:47] last part of this
[23:48] testimony that uh it's just speculation
[23:51] but our God is a mighty God and he works
[23:53] in mysterious
[23:54] ways a few months prior to this at the
[23:57] beginning of the summer I hit a dog I've
[24:00] never hit an animal as big as a dog I've
[24:01] run over squirrels and possums never run
[24:03] over a dog but it was in this very same
[24:06] spot now that's odd isn't God odd
[24:10] because of all the places I drive all
[24:12] over North Georgia and South Carolina
[24:14] you wouldn't think I'd hit a dog and a
[24:16] woman in the same place so what about
[24:19] that and I thought about it and pondered
[24:20] it for days I don't know but I can
[24:22] speculate one thing I said option C
[24:25] Christ took over when I did that swerve
[24:29] that Sid step swerve all right Christ
[24:31] took over I regretted hitting that dog I
[24:34] hit him I exploded him he disintegrated
[24:36] I hit him so hard I never swerved I
[24:39] never tried to miss him I laid into the
[24:40] air horn for quite some time he stood
[24:42] his ground I thought this is very
[24:44] strange and then I hit him and I turned
[24:45] my head I couldn't stand to watch but
[24:47] the way that I hit him it took him
[24:48] forever to decompose I know I'm grossing
[24:50] you out but I watched his remains in the
[24:53] road he had a nicely neatly stacked um
[24:57] fur coat in the right turning lane and
[24:59] for months I watched those remains I
[25:00] came by and I said I wish I had swerved
[25:02] I wish I had been more what's the word
[25:05] uh reactive you know or responsive
[25:07] instead of just freezing up I have a
[25:08] tendency to freeze up when I'm going to
[25:09] hit something because I don't want to
[25:10] turn over and or have a wreck so maybe
[25:14] just maybe God was working on my
[25:16] instinct reprogramming me to where that
[25:18] when this accident happened cuz I think
[25:20] God knew whenever this accident happened
[25:22] that I would react in that way and save
[25:24] their lives so it wasn't me that saved
[25:26] their life it was Christ all the way
[25:27] through am that's all the testimony I
[25:30] have thank
[25:30] [Applause]

[41:23] being ourself and we trust something was
[41:26] said to encourage you and to help you
[41:27] and truly that's my desire friends is
[41:30] that I could just be a witness for my
[41:32] Lord amen and you know someone told me
[41:34] one time the greatest compliment they
[41:36] ever had they got it at work and said
[41:38] somebody walked up to them and said you
[41:39] know I know we don't believe aik I know
[41:42] you believe different than I do was a a
[41:43] message brother was telling was telling
[41:45] this and he said I I know that uh that
[41:47] you don't believe the way we do but I
[41:49] just want you to know that every time I
[41:51] get around you said I I feel the
[41:53] presence of Jesus Christ and and the
[41:54] brother was telling me he said you know
[41:56] that was the greatest compliment and
[41:57] that is right and that's the greatest
[41:59] compl not oh man what a preacher I ain't
[42:01] interested in that but for someone to
[42:02] say I saw Jesus when you preached this
[42:04] morning that's what it's all about amen
[42:07] so may the Lord richly bless you if you
[42:08] have your Bibles this evening turn with
[42:10] us to the book of First Kings we going
[42:11] to read there uh from First Kings
[42:13] chapter 17 uh starting at verse 8 and
[42:18] very very familiar scripture to us all
[42:20] and we actually was going to go another
[42:22] Direction uh but I just kind of sitting
[42:24] in the study and listening and singing I
[42:26] just kind of uh wanted to go this
[42:28] direction so we trust that it'll be a
[42:30] blessing to you
[42:33] amen amen First Kings chapter 17 verse 8
[42:38] praise the
[42:42] Lord and the word of the Lord came unto
[42:45] him saying arise thee and get thee to
[42:48] zerth which belongeth to zidon and dwell
[42:51] there behold I have commanded a widow
[42:53] woman to sustain thee now that word
[42:57] commanded it means to appoint to ordain
[43:00] of a Divine act to appoint ordain of a
[43:05] Divine act so he arose and went to zerth
[43:08] and when he came to the gate of the city
[43:10] behold the widow woman was there
[43:12] Gathering of sticks and he called to her
[43:14] and said fetch me I pray thee a little
[43:16] water in a vessel that I may drink and
[43:18] as she was going to fetch it it must
[43:20] have been a Kentucky
[43:21] and and as she was going to fetch it he
[43:24] called to her and said bring me I pray
[43:26] thee a morsel of bread in that hand and
[43:28] she said as the Lord thy God liveth I
[43:31] have not a cake but a handful of meal in
[43:33] a barrel and a little oil in a cruise
[43:35] and behold I am Gathering two sticks
[43:37] that I may go in and dress it for me and
[43:38] my son that we may eat it and die and
[43:42] Elijah said unto her fear not go and do
[43:45] as thou Hast said but make me therefore
[43:47] a little cake first and bring it unto me
[43:50] and after make it for thee and for thy
[43:52] son for thus saith the Lord God of
[43:56] Israel the barrel of meal shall not
[43:58] waste neither shall the cruise of oil
[44:00] fail until the day the Lord sendeth rain
[44:03] upon the earth and the same God that
[44:05] made her that promise has made us the
[44:07] same promise in this hour that we're
[44:09] living in amen and she went and did
[44:11] according to the saying of Elijah now
[44:14] that's a good thing to do just do what
[44:16] Elijah says to do and she and he and her
[44:19] house did eat many days notice there
[44:22] wasn't one meal for Elijah and one meal
[44:24] for the widow woman they all ate from
[44:26] the same
[44:27] Barrel Hallelujah and the barrel of meal
[44:30] wasted not neither did the cruise of of
[44:32] oil fail according to the word of the
[44:34] Lord which he spake by Elijah Amen Let

[46:05] may be seated praise the Lord how many
[46:08] is full of food amen well we'll try to
[46:11] preach above it
[46:15] amen amen God richly bless you amen now
[46:20] in our scripture reading this
[46:22] afternoon we find that Israel excuse me
[46:26] we find find that there's a Great Famine
[46:28] in the
[46:29] land for the Bible says that it had not
[46:31] rained nor due in over three and a half
[46:35] years now the reason for this famine was
[46:38] because of the mighty Prophet Elijah
[46:41] under the leadership of God had walked
[46:44] right up into the presence of the king
[46:47] and he had pronounced judgment upon his
[46:49] kingdom because of the moral Decay that
[46:52] had taken place and we know that our
[46:54] nation today is in the condition that
[46:56] it's in it's not because an army from
[46:58] the outside has invaded us but it's the
[47:00] corruption of our own moral Decay amen
[47:03] our problems has come from within our
[47:05] nation because we have left the
[47:07] fundamentals of the Gospel that God gave
[47:09] us to live by our nation was not founded
[47:12] upon Islamic our nation was not founded
[47:14] upon some other religion but it was
[47:15] founded upon the word of God Amen is
[47:20] that right friends now you know I say
[47:22] today if people don't want to abide by
[47:24] the word of God let them find them
[47:25] another country to go to
[47:27] [Applause]
[47:30] praise the Lord sorry I just had to say
[47:33] that but it's the truth for why should
[47:36] we change the way we believe to
[47:38] accommodate everybody else let them come
[47:40] God's way for it is the only way amen
[47:43] amen hallelujah so we then we find then
[47:47] that judgment was upon this Kingdom the
[47:49] the the prophet of God said the people
[47:51] was poverty stricken there was no water
[47:53] he said it was a reflection the
[47:55] condition of the nation was the
[47:57] reflection of the moral decay of that
[48:00] Nation but Elijah Was Not Afraid oh God
[48:03] give us a men today that's Anointed with
[48:05] that same anointing he was not afraid to
[48:08] stand before that King for he had been
[48:10] in the presence of one who was greater
[48:12] than that King he had been in The
[48:14] Presence of Jehovah therefore he knew
[48:17] exactly where he was standing and I'm so
[48:19] glad today we're not wishy-washy we
[48:22] don't know where we're standing we have
[48:24] been in the presence of God hallelujah
[48:27] and God has established for us in this
[48:29] hour where we are to
[48:31] stand is that right he had been in the
[48:34] presence of God and anytime a man is
[48:36] standing in the presence of God he knows
[48:39] exactly where he's standing and Elijah
[48:42] walked right up into the presence of
[48:44] that King he didn't stutter he didn't
[48:46] stammer he didn't
[48:48] apologize cuz he knew what he was
[48:50] talking about he walked right up into
[48:53] the presence of that King he could say
[48:55] to that King thus sayith the Lord God of
[48:58] Israel there will be no rain nor do
[49:02] until I call for
[49:05] it huh now that's awful bold words for a
[49:08] say of a man that was born of a
[49:11] woman where did he get such
[49:15] boldness Hallelujah it will not rain nor
[49:19] doe until I call for it why did he say
[49:22] that why because it was according he
[49:24] said according to my word it will not
[49:26] happened according to my word why
[49:29] because he had the word of the
[49:32] Lord he was a prophet and the word of
[49:35] the Lord comes to the prophet notice he
[49:38] spoke as though it was God himself
[49:42] speaking Elijah spoke as if it was God
[49:46] himself
[49:48] speaking now listen to this quote I know
[49:50] you don't mind me quoting the prophet
[49:52] said Jesus said if ye shall
[49:54] say what is it when you're out from
[49:57] under Babylon when you're out from under
[50:00] unbelief when you're out from under
[50:03] Superstition when you're out from under
[50:05] all these things and you're filled with
[50:08] God's own life on your voice is his
[50:14] voice you are he said you are because I
[50:18] spoke
[50:19] it when we're out from under confusion
[50:22] when we're out from under babbling when
[50:24] we're out from under Superstition oh you
[50:26] better be careful when we know where we
[50:28] stand as God's children as sons of God
[50:33] do we speak with the authority of the
[50:34] word father we are the Seed of Abraham
[50:37] Abraham did not speak by emotion he did
[50:40] not speak by sensation but he spoke by
[50:43] the faith in the
[50:45] word
[50:47] hallelujah amen said will not do nor
[50:50] rain until I call for it amen it as
[50:55] though God himself speaking why he had
[50:57] the mind of God what did the prophet of
[50:59] God say the bride she have thus sayith
[51:01] the Lord or keep still she knows what he
[51:05] wants done with the
[51:07] word amen oh we live so beneath our preg
[51:12] it not rain or DW will fall from Heaven
[51:14] till I call for it yes sir he was in the
[51:16] presence of God Amen do you love
[51:22] him Hallelujah notice the continuity of
[51:26] the prophet in his God God and His
[51:28] Prophet rather look at the continuity he
[51:30] knew exactly what God wanted for that
[51:33] hour amen well that reminds me of
[51:36] another Son of God remember Adam in the
[51:37] Bible amen remember Adam God who created
[51:40] the animals come on it's not a trick
[51:44] question God created the animals but who
[51:47] named the animals God didn't name them
[51:50] Adam named them how did Adam know what
[51:52] to name him because Adam had the mind of
[51:55] God Amen he knew a he said you're a

[1:00:21] sustaining him oh don't you see friends
[1:00:24] God puts us in situations sometimes we
[1:00:26] don't understand but he does it to show

[1:07:42] God Amen you know when I was in the Army
[1:07:45] I joined the army when I was 16 year old
[1:07:48] my mom and dad had a sign for me i' done
[1:07:50] it so I could get the GI bill so I could
[1:07:51] go to college so I joined when I 16y old
[1:07:54] and I went into active duty at 17 I was
[1:07:56] in a program called Depp delay entry
[1:07:58] program I was delayed 11 months before I
[1:08:00] went on active duty my whole senior year
[1:08:01] in high school I was already in the Army
[1:08:03] I already signed up and so I went into
[1:08:05] the army and basic training I was the
[1:08:07] youngest guy that called me baby
[1:08:09] face you know the first time I shaved I
[1:08:12] was in the
[1:08:14] Army it's true so I was you know I've
[1:08:18] seen too many John Wayne movies growing
[1:08:19] up so I thought I had to be in one of
[1:08:22] those rough units yeah so I joined the
[1:08:24] 18th Arab born core field artillery
[1:08:27] direct fire support for the 82nd we
[1:08:29] could be anywhere in the world in 24
[1:08:31] hours and ready to fight but in order to
[1:08:33] do that we spent our whole life in the
[1:08:35] woods training training training
[1:08:38] training always training you realiz that
[1:08:40] when President Reagan was shot I was in
[1:08:42] the woods you know I was that when he
[1:08:43] got out of the hospital in the woods we
[1:08:46] spent our whole and so in the woods you
[1:08:47] know we we would we would train for
[1:08:49] combat situations so because we was
[1:08:52] training for combat situations they
[1:08:54] wanted to bring us steaks and they
[1:08:56] wanted to bring us baked
[1:08:58] potatoes but they brought us sea
[1:09:01] rations how many's ever been in the Army
[1:09:04] knows what I'm talking you had remember
[1:09:05] the SE rations some people call them
[1:09:06] MREs MRIs different ones but SE rations
[1:09:09] now these SE RS was a prepackaged
[1:09:14] meal you know I remember some of them
[1:09:16] was ham and eggs I used to pray I
[1:09:18] wouldn't get that one beef and potatoes
[1:09:21] it was pretty good if you could heat it
[1:09:23] up the best was tuna oh man when I got
[1:09:25] tuna I was in
[1:09:27] heaven and so we had a little uh
[1:09:29] instrument called a P38 how many
[1:09:31] remembers that little P38 you know why
[1:09:32] they called it P38 because you would
[1:09:34] turn it 38 times and it would open the
[1:09:38] can I've still got mine still got mine
[1:09:41] from my days of the army of P38 and so
[1:09:43] they would give us these prepackaged
[1:09:45] meals now I was in the Army from
[1:09:48] 1977 until
[1:09:51] 81 four years and they would bring us
[1:09:54] these ser and we'd open up this box and
[1:09:57] we would pull them out now on each one
[1:09:59] of them was it would say ham and eggs or
[1:10:00] or beef stew or or I'm trying to tuna
[1:10:03] was one of them and different ones that
[1:10:04] they gave us and they' have some peanut
[1:10:06] butter and it had a little piece of
[1:10:07] chewing gum and had some cocoa powder
[1:10:09] had some coffee Salt and Pepper all that
[1:10:11] was in a prepackaged meal but when you
[1:10:14] pulled out the can and looked at it it
[1:10:15] had a date on it it told you when that
[1:10:19] can was processed now I was in the Army
[1:10:22] from 77 to 81 but I would get cans of SE
[1:10:26] rations
[1:10:32] 1951
[1:10:34] 1949 oh my God that's where I was
[1:10:38] born
[1:10:40] 1967
[1:10:42] 1963 but you know you take that P38 it
[1:10:45] would be sealed but you take that P38
[1:10:48] and open up that can it would
[1:10:50] go yeah and when you open it up if you
[1:10:53] put a little fire to it it actually
[1:10:54] wasn't too bad especially if he
[1:10:58] hungry
[1:11:00] amen so when I got out of the army now
[1:11:02] you know I joined the army I wanted to
[1:11:04] see the world I was an old boy from
[1:11:07] Tennessee never got to see anything I I
[1:11:09] forget even how old I was the first time
[1:11:11] ever saw the ocean we was just poor we
[1:11:13] never was able to go anywhere so I
[1:11:15] joined the army I wanted to see the
[1:11:16] world so I joined the army guess where I
[1:11:19] went North
[1:11:22] Carolina all four years
[1:11:27] North Carolina it was Unreal I had the
[1:11:30] same locker and bed for four
[1:11:33] years so I got out of the Army in 81 and
[1:11:36] then as I told you this morning the Lord
[1:11:38] came to me in a little building down
[1:11:39] there in Jonesburg I gave my heart to
[1:11:40] the Lord I found out brother Wade I was
[1:11:42] in another Army right GL and when I got
[1:11:45] into God's Army guess what he's let me
[1:11:48] see the world
[1:11:55] I've been in 29 some countries preach
[1:11:57] the gospel by the grace of God isn't
[1:12:00] that wonderful you know the Bible say
[1:12:02] he'll give you the desire of your heart
[1:12:04] he just knows how to do those things
[1:12:06] just to show you how much he loves you
[1:12:10] amen amen so I found out I was in
[1:12:13] another Army God's chosen Army right and
[1:12:17] when I found out I was in God's Army
[1:12:19] guess what I found out God also has some
[1:12:22] pre-prepared meals right
[1:12:26] and they had a date on
[1:12:28] them but when you opened up and put it
[1:12:31] in there and push play it was just as
[1:12:35] fresh I looked at some of the dates 1947
[1:12:39] faith is a substance 1954 God's only
[1:12:41] provided way of dealing with sin 1962 in
[1:12:44] time evangelism 1959 looking to the
[1:12:46] Unseen Los Angeles California 1963 the
[1:12:49] open of the seals 1965 the Rapture it
[1:12:52] was just as fresh as it was the day
[1:12:56] it was
[1:13:01] preached now when my daughter was hurt
[1:13:04] she was in a coma on life support for 11
[1:13:07] days she was in a coma for weeks and
[1:13:09] weeks she's struck by a
[1:13:12] train brother Bert Thompson brother I go
[1:13:14] to church with I his wife was my first
[1:13:16] convert we went to college together when
[1:13:19] I came back off of Christmas break and
[1:13:21] was saved I got the witness and she was
[1:13:23] my first
[1:13:24] convert so she brother bur came down met
[1:13:27] they married now they got a house full
[1:13:28] of kids and live happily ever
[1:13:33] after anyway brother bur came down to
[1:13:35] the hospital to see me he said brother
[1:13:37] Daryl I was on the way down here tonight
[1:13:39] and I was listening to the adoption
[1:13:40] series it says it sounds like exactly
[1:13:43] brother brandham was praying it sounds
[1:13:45] exactly like brother brandham was
[1:13:47] praying for your
[1:13:50] daughter because now in the accident you
[1:13:52] see I know some of you know brother some
[1:13:53] of you saw the video and I appreciate
[1:13:55] you taking the time off your busy
[1:13:57] schedule to watch Jessica's
[1:14:00] story but two of my family was killed
[1:14:03] and my little baby girl was dying she
[1:14:06] was only three year old she actually she
[1:14:08] turned three in the
[1:14:09] hospital so he comes down he C he said
[1:14:12] you want to hear it I said sure So he
[1:14:14] goes out the car he brings the tape in
[1:14:15] now we I I had read that soft music will
[1:14:18] help the brain to heal so he played soft
[1:14:20] classical music soft gospel music you
[1:14:22] know and of course we played tapes of
[1:14:23] brother Brenham there in in the I see
[1:14:25] you in the room there where she was at
[1:14:26] and we just kept those things playing
[1:14:28] and so we go in there and so we take out
[1:14:29] a tape and we put this tape in and he
[1:14:32] had left it right there where brother
[1:14:33] Ben begins to pray and if you don't mind
[1:14:35] if I just like to to share this with you
[1:14:37] this is what he said and manifested sons
[1:14:39] of God now remember two of my family was
[1:14:42] killed and my little girl was dying and
[1:14:44] brother Bert said it sounds exactly like
[1:14:46] he was praying for your daughter and now
[1:14:49] it's called upon us to go immediately to
[1:14:51] God and each of us fathers thinks what
[1:14:54] if that was our little little girl and
[1:14:56] how our hearts would burn and hurt
[1:14:58] within us and we would call to the
[1:15:00] churches to immediately have prayer and
[1:15:02] some Father's Heart Is Burning and
[1:15:03] aching Lord May that great person of the
[1:15:06] Holy Ghost come just now to that
[1:15:07] Father's Heart take away every Shadow of
[1:15:10] Doubt every ache and let him know that
[1:15:12] thou art God and there is no disease can
[1:15:15] stand in thy presence when thy Divine
[1:15:17] commission has been carried out by thy
[1:15:19] church and thy people and through the
[1:15:21] week we pray and since last Sunday I
[1:15:23] have thought on these ways or these
[1:15:25] means of prayer we do not have very much
[1:15:27] of a weapon as far as it looks to the
[1:15:29] world but this little sling slot is
[1:15:31] deadly when it's held in the fingers of
[1:15:33] Faith oh Lord May our prayer strike home
[1:15:36] that death Yonder that hangs over that
[1:15:37] child may it be shattered the darkness
[1:15:40] and the Gloom away from beside the
[1:15:41] bedside of that infant or that baby or
[1:15:44] child little girl may the great light of
[1:15:46] God's presence shine upon it and may it
[1:15:48] come home from that hospital a well
[1:15:51] child God we know just across the river
[1:15:54] our loved one weight and it's glorious
[1:15:56] but we love our little ones and we pray
[1:15:59] Lord that For Your Glory you'll spare
[1:16:01] the life of that child we as your church
[1:16:03] rebuke that death and say stand still
[1:16:05] Yonder you can't take that child because
[1:16:08] we claim its life for the kingdom of
[1:16:09] God's sake Grant these things Lord to go
[1:16:11] straight to the mark As We direct them
[1:16:13] in the name of Jesus Christ Our Savior
[1:16:19] amen and after a while brother Bert
[1:16:23] left and the nurse came came into the
[1:16:25] room and she said Mr Ward I said yes
[1:16:28] ma'am she said was that you praying for
[1:16:31] your
[1:16:32] daughter I said no ma'am she said was
[1:16:36] that someone in your church praying for
[1:16:38] your daughter I said no ma'am I said
[1:16:41] that prayer was prayed over 35 years ago
[1:16:45] Hallelujah but you see it was just as
[1:16:48] fresh
[1:16:58] H Elijah's drinking the water eating
[1:17:01] food that a crow brought him but one day
[1:17:04] the river the creek begin to dry up the
[1:17:06] brook begin to dry up and God showed
[1:17:09] Elijah Vision said go down to the city
[1:17:10] for I have commanded not the Ravens this
[1:17:13] time but I have commanded a widow woman
[1:17:16] to sustain you huh he took him to the
[1:17:19] pur of the poor I've commanded a widow
[1:17:22] woman to sustain you and she didn't even
[1:17:25] have enough meal in the barrel for her
[1:17:27] or her son am and God said I've done
[1:17:31] commanded her to feed
[1:17:34] you amen hallelujah do you love him I've
[1:17:39] commanded it I have ordained it oh
[1:17:41] blessed be the name of the Lord when God
[1:17:43] ordains anything it's got to happen
[1:17:46] right right right it's there God will
[1:17:48] meet it I've commanded a widow woman
[1:17:50] there to take care of you to sustain you
[1:17:53] now think brother can can I have just a
[1:17:54] few minutes think is it not a strange
[1:17:56] thing that God would send his Prophet to
[1:18:00] a widow woman's house what a place to
[1:18:02] send a man of
[1:18:04] God but you see she must have been a
[1:18:07] real virtuous woman right or he would
[1:18:11] have never sent his Prophet down there
[1:18:17] right
[1:18:19] amen she must have been a real virtuous
[1:18:22] woman or God would have never sent the
[1:18:25] prophet to
[1:18:26] her now notice neither one of these
[1:18:29] people knew each
[1:18:31] other he just knew her by
[1:18:33] Vision they never knew each other like
[1:18:36] the black woman in Memphis when the
[1:18:37] prophet of God went to her house being
[1:18:39] led by the spirit and she's standing out
[1:18:41] there by the gate and she said morning
[1:18:44] Parson he said how I how' you know I was
[1:18:46] a preacher she said not only that I knew
[1:18:47] you was coming said where's your
[1:18:49] briefcase you're supposed to have a
[1:18:50] briefcase supposed to have a satchel he
[1:18:52] said I left it in the room he said
[1:18:54] William Brenham I pray for the sick ever
[1:18:56] heard of me no sir I ain't never heard
[1:18:58] of you she know brother Bram from Adam
[1:19:00] but she knew
[1:19:01] God she got a hold of God God got a hold
[1:19:04] of his Prophet Hallelujah and send him
[1:19:07] down to the woman's house she didn't
[1:19:10] know him he didn't know her but he was
[1:19:12] looking for her that's my Ministry is
[1:19:16] catch that bride
[1:19:18] right she must have been an honorable
[1:19:20] woman she must have been the type of
[1:19:22] woman that Elijah was a man for how can
[1:19:26] two walk together except they agree now
[1:19:30] God chose this woman out of all women so
[1:19:33] she was a chosen
[1:19:35] lady exactly right he chose her out of
[1:19:38] all the women that was there all the
[1:19:40] women that was in Israel to entertain
[1:19:42] his prophet and he would have never
[1:19:44] chosen immoral woman to entertain his
[1:19:48] Prophet The Prophet said this widow
[1:19:51] woman was a
[1:19:52] gentile she had not took the Mark of the
[1:19:55] unbeliever but it kept herself in the
[1:19:58] time of famine right the prophet said
[1:20:02] she represents the Church of today Glory
[1:20:06] the prophet also said this woman was
[1:20:09] ordained to life
[1:20:12] righta brother Dar who is this
[1:20:15] woman my dear brother my sister it's you
[1:20:20] amen thank you Lord she was typing you
[1:20:24] for what did God say before the deathful
[1:20:27] day of the Lord behold I
[1:20:30] send who who you Elijah right the
[1:20:40] prophet God would have never sent a
[1:20:42] prophet to an immoral woman
[1:20:45] right I make the pope
[1:20:48] shout what's wrong with those message
[1:20:50] people am
[1:20:52] right think of it that make us the
[1:20:55] happiest people on earth I wasn't
[1:20:56] looking for God you say I sought God I
[1:20:58] could no you didn't you never sought God
[1:21:00] it was always God looking for
[1:21:03] you hallelujah
[1:21:07] amen hold I send you Elijah the prophet
[1:21:10] now the willow woman she goes to the
[1:21:11] meal Barrel I'm trying to Hur she goes
[1:21:12] to the meal Barrel there's not much left
[1:21:14] she goes over the cruise of allil just
[1:21:16] enough for one spoonful just a good
[1:21:18] tablespoon about all she had that's all
[1:21:20] stood between her and death now I
[1:21:23] suppose that not that was an all night
[1:21:25] prayer meeting and brother when things
[1:21:27] get to going wrong that's the time to
[1:21:30] pray right when everything's going good
[1:21:32] none of us pray like we should pray but
[1:21:33] let trouble strike your home one time
[1:21:35] you'll know how to pray come on somebody
[1:21:37] persecution is good for us tribulation
[1:21:39] is good for us we've ask God for peace
[1:21:42] and comfort but God gives us the best
[1:21:43] thing he can give us that's trials and
[1:21:45] tribulations they are better they're
[1:21:47] more precious to us than gold because
[1:21:49] through our trials and through our test
[1:21:51] there's a character molded in us that's
[1:21:53] fit to reain amen
[1:21:56] amen amen you see my brother my sister
[1:21:59] if we prayed about our problems instead
[1:22:01] of worrying about our problems how much
[1:22:03] better off we would
[1:22:05] be now isn't it strange that God will
[1:22:07] let us get right down to the end of the
[1:22:10] road and no doubt she checked up and
[1:22:13] checked her life said Lord God I I've

[1:25:44] but she knew she' met God's requirement
[1:25:47] amen she knew she met all God's
[1:25:49] requirement yet God was still silent now
[1:25:51] watch it seemed like God didn't even
[1:25:55] care for her yeah right H it seemed like
[1:25:59] God didn't care whether she would live
[1:26:01] or die now how many times have we felt
[1:26:04] like that when we have a problem or
[1:26:06] we're facing difficulty and we call on
[1:26:07] God and call on God and call on
[1:26:10] God and it seems like God's silent it
[1:26:14] seems like God don't even your prayer
[1:26:16] goes right off your lips and falls on
[1:26:17] the
[1:26:19] floor and no doubt she'd sought God and
[1:26:21] sought God and it seemed like God didn't
[1:26:24] even care whether she lived or died yeah
[1:26:29] and one of Satan's greatest tools I hope
[1:26:30] you're listening to me one of Satan's
[1:26:32] greatest tools against us is to try to
[1:26:34] get us to believe that God don't love us
[1:26:37] right right we believe God loves brother
[1:26:40] Dale and God loves brother WG and God
[1:26:41] loves brother wg's wife but God don't
[1:26:44] love me right and Satan says that's
[1:26:46] right that's why you're facing this
[1:26:47] battle that's why you're facing this
[1:26:48] sickness that's why that's why your
[1:26:50] children's giving you such a hard time
[1:26:51] cuz God don't love you want Satan's
[1:26:54] greatest tools what did Brother B say
[1:26:56] brother B said Satan tried he couldn't
[1:26:58] come and tell me there wasn't a God
[1:26:59] because I met him but what he tried to
[1:27:00] come and tell me was yeah there's a God
[1:27:02] but God don't love you right now why did
[1:27:04] he do that because he knows it's
[1:27:06] effective it works on prophets it works
[1:27:08] on pastors it works on evangelist it
[1:27:09] works on mama daddy brother sister it
[1:27:11] works if he can get us to believe that
[1:27:13] our problems are greater than our
[1:27:16] God then the next thing you know we'll
[1:27:18] be muming and we'll be complaining and
[1:27:19] we'll quit coming to church and we'll
[1:27:20] set further in the back and we won't say
[1:27:22] Amen
[1:27:29] say Amen or out
[1:27:33] what amen I really do feel it h me
[1:27:36] praise
[1:27:37] God but it seemed like God didn't care
[1:27:39] whether she lived or died but all God
[1:27:42] don't miss this all the time God was
[1:27:45] working it
[1:27:47] out it wasn't that God didn't know God
[1:27:50] knew exactly what was taking place
[1:27:52] sometimes the old saying is we can't see
[1:27:53] the forest for the trees all she could
[1:27:55] see was the trees God was looking at the
[1:27:58] whole
[1:27:59] Forest amen let that be a lesson to us
[1:28:02] that many times we're having problems in
[1:28:04] our life issues in our life we think God
[1:28:06] is silent Lord I prayed I've heard
[1:28:07] nothing are you listening are you there
[1:28:09] but in reality God is working it out for
[1:28:13] our good
[1:28:15] amen write this down put it on your
[1:28:17] refrigerator remember this every Miracle
[1:28:21] starts with a problem right amen well

[1:30:04] throw
[1:30:05] up she said I don't understand

[1:31:04] brook amen he's told Elijah I have
[1:31:06] commanded a widow woman to feed you he
[1:31:09] had all already commanded her but guess

[1:31:15] that's right she was unconscious oh God
[1:31:18] don't miss this she was unconscious of
[1:31:20] the fact that everything she was fixing
[1:31:22] to do was ordained of God by a Divine
[1:31:27] act
[1:31:30] right she prayed all night long she

[1:37:15] friends and there's just something about
[1:37:19] that voice right right how many knows
[1:37:21] what I'm talking about Glory I was 5y
[1:37:24] old the first time I ever heard it
[1:37:26] didn't understand it but there was
[1:37:27] something about that
[1:37:30] voice my mom and daddy backl the Lord
[1:37:32] and took me out of church you parents
[1:37:34] don't do that I don't understand they'll
[1:37:36] keep their kids in church when they're
[1:37:37] little about the time they get seven or
[1:37:38] eight year old they backslide on God and
[1:37:39] go out and the kids just go crazy don't
[1:37:42] do your kids that way and then they try
[1:37:44] to come back in try to bring their kids
[1:37:46] back in line after they went out there
[1:37:47] and tasted all that yeah right that's
[1:37:49] what my parents did to me I wasn't in
[1:37:52] church from the time I was like nine
[1:37:53] until I was
[1:37:55] 21 and I was in the Army and I stationed
[1:37:57] at Fort Brag it's just about 6 hours
[1:37:58] away and I used to come home on the
[1:38:00] weekends and I'm ashamed to tell you but
[1:38:02] I was used to drive out of town
[1:38:04] listening to a group called White Snake
[1:38:06] something black snake red some kind of
[1:38:08] snake there's a song called train
[1:38:10] training I used to put that song on
[1:38:12] crank it up and drive through Johnson
[1:38:13] City like a maniac heading back to the
[1:38:16] Army and I used to go right by Happy
[1:38:19] Valley see him up there on the steps
[1:38:21] yeah little did I know and just a few
[1:38:23] years later
[1:38:24] Lord will let me preach to
[1:38:26] him and I went right by and I went
[1:38:29] remember one time I went over into North
[1:38:30] Carolina boo North Carolina listening to
[1:38:32] rock and roll music and all of a sudden
[1:38:35] the radio faded out and brother brenon
[1:38:38] faded in yeah started preaching and I
[1:38:42] listened to it all the way through up to
[1:38:44] Winston Salem and it faded back out
[1:38:47] because there's something about that
[1:38:50] voice it calls to you
[1:38:54] you ought to be the happiest person on
[1:38:58] Earth amen so he says to her bring me a
[1:39:02] drink now watch he's asking for water
[1:39:05] now she's got more water than she's got
[1:39:07] food right exactly right so she turns to
[1:39:11] get the water why cuz she's a character
[1:39:13] you know she she's character like Elijah
[1:39:15] she's a she's a she's a server she's a
[1:39:17] giver amen and so he she know he's a
[1:39:20] nice nice man the nice voice there so
[1:39:22] I'll give you some water after all you
[1:39:24] know what am I'm going to need water for
[1:39:25] I ain't got no more food this is it so
[1:39:28] she goes and turns to get the water and
[1:39:30] then he says and bring me a little cake
[1:39:36] right now he's not asking for her water
[1:39:39] that's right he's asking her for
[1:39:42] everything she
[1:39:44] has this day I will give my
[1:39:47] all he's asking her to give now watch if
[1:39:52] it had just been the kind of character
[1:39:53] of a woman she was if it would had just
[1:39:55] been her no doubt she would say well
[1:39:58] I'll split the cake with you or I'll
[1:39:59] give it to you but you see she was going
[1:40:01] to give that to her son right and we all
[1:40:03] know how much we'll take care of our
[1:40:05] children we'll suffer everything for our
[1:40:07] children is that right so he wasn't
[1:40:10] asking her to give something she's going
[1:40:11] to eat herself he was asking her to give
[1:40:13] him something she was going to give her
[1:40:15] son
[1:40:17] right exactly right but you see God
[1:40:20] never ask you for something but what
[1:40:22] he's got something better for for
[1:40:24] you ain't that something glory god just
[1:40:27] asked us to come to church three times a
[1:40:28] week pay our ties live right
[1:40:33] yeah y'all do have church three time
[1:40:35] however many times you have church I
[1:40:36] don't know you know what I'm
[1:40:39] saying he says and bring me a cake now
[1:40:41] he's asking her brother for everything
[1:40:44] she has right and when he sees that she
[1:40:48] is going to get it right right when he
[1:40:52] sees she's willing to give him that cake
[1:40:55] she heard the words that every believer
[1:40:58] longs to hear thus saith the
[1:41:03] Lord bring me one
[1:41:05] now and go make one for your son and go
[1:41:09] make one for you and go make another one

[1:41:15] make two for your son make two for you
[1:41:17] and make go ahead and make me three and
[1:41:19] then go back and make six more for you
[1:41:21] and make six more for your son and I
[1:41:22] believe I'll have eight more after
[1:41:29] that
