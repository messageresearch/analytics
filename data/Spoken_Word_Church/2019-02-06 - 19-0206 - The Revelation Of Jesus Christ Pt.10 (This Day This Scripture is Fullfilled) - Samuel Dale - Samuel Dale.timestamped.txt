[1:48] mention Lord would bless amen
[1:50] you notice that here we kind of move
[1:52] things around Richard and I did
[1:55] yesterday to kind of get everything
[1:56] where everybody can have a little more
[1:58] room and do things but you know we wrote
[2:03] a name and put it on the seat so well
[2:05] that way you can can find out where you
[2:08] supposed to be said yeah that's that's a
[2:11] good way to do it maybe order to do that
[2:12] in a church don't put one two three and
[2:15] you know do it any other announcements
[2:21] fellowship meeting remember that was
[2:24] trying to renounce those way ahead of
[2:25] time where you make all your plans and
[2:27] get everything ready
[2:28] okay father we thank you for this day in
[2:32] your grace Lord and thank you for
[2:33] everything we ask you to not to just
[2:35] come and be in in each one of our hearts
[2:38] and our lives to open our eyes as we
[2:41] sing unto you to your understanding that
[2:45] we may walk in the light of your grace
[2:46] we love you and we thank you and we pray
[2:49] that you would just have your way with
[2:51] all of us and let your light shine
[2:53] father and
[2:54] was infinity the understanding that you
[2:58] won't for us tonight because that's the
[3:01] main thing
[3:02] have you away with each one now and
[3:03] guide us in Jesus name
[3:06] good to see sister freedom back there
[3:08] with us
[3:11] first Peter 1:13 it's very familiar
[3:14] we've read it now what 10 times this
[3:16] makes so V order to know the scripture
[3:18] says wherefore gird up the loins cut
[3:21] he's already covered the old coming
[3:23] through into the new and how the old
[3:25] spoke of the new and the prophets and
[3:27] and all that how they spoke of these
[3:29] things but then the Holy Ghost first
[3:32] twelve would speak through the believers
[3:35] like Peter and all of them and joining
[3:37] them and bring it to the place of
[3:39] understanding dire and then it would
[3:41] point all the way to the end wherefore
[3:43] gird up the loins of your mind be sober
[3:45] and hope to the end for the grace that
[3:48] is to be brought unto you at the
[3:51] revelation of Jesus Christ
[3:54] can I say it this way at the end time
[3:59] because there has to be you know a final
[4:03] revelation in the end time right so
[4:07] there is an end time and there is a
[4:09] point to be revealed and all like that
[4:11] so remember those things you may be
[4:13] seated
[4:13] Lord that is blessing to the reading of
[4:15] the word now we've been trying for some
[4:19] time to I know I have an odd way to try
[4:23] to find a thought and keep presenting it
[4:25] till people see it but that's just me
[4:28] I'm sorry I'll probably never will get
[4:31] changed until the change comes but I
[4:34] don't think we'll have to worry about it
[4:35] then too you will just be the same cuz
[4:38] I'm just trying to make a point to you
[4:40] to get it to you to see about the
[4:43] writing of the Bible now that's what
[4:47] we've been talking about I mentioned
[4:48] this ever service because I want you to
[4:50] think about the writing of the Bible
[4:53] alright the Bible as we've said writes
[4:56] about the past
[4:59] it writes about the future but what did
[5:03] the prophets say about the problem with
[5:05] that he said our problem is we look back
[5:08] at the past or we look at the future and
[5:11] fail to see what's going on at the
[5:15] present now I'm just as serious as I can
[5:18] because this is what I mean
[5:19] there is no now listen to the wording
[5:22] code I was human there's no faith in
[5:25] looking backward now that's that leads
[5:29] you helps you you know it's humanly
[5:32] helps in time because it does help you
[5:34] look what I said you know let's see this
[5:36] back there oh that helps you don't
[5:38] misunderstand it but that's not the
[5:40] revelation back there that you're
[5:43] needing to give you'll need to get
[5:44] what's taking place now all right so
[5:47] then the future don't worry about it
[5:49] it'll take place when it gets tired but
[5:52] this is the only age now so we're gonna
[5:54] track the lady you'll see an age and try
[5:57] to get this point the lady you'll see an
[5:59] age is a marvelous age
[6:03] do you realize in this age is happening
[6:06] something that has never happened before
[6:12] no no because the past has caught up
[6:20] with the present and the present is not
[6:25] looking to the future because remember
[6:27] what I've always said to you and you
[6:29] think about it this seriously think is
[6:31] it's a carnal way but remember tomorrow
[6:35] is not here all right but when you get
[6:38] to tomorrow that won't be tomorrow right
[6:44] that'll be today all right that's just
[6:48] simple point just think about that and
[6:50] keep it in your understanding of the
[6:52] revelation because anything present if
[6:55] the future has got something to look
[6:57] forward to yes sure and we enjoy the
[7:00] price yes but if we don't think about
[7:04] what's taking place at the present time
[7:09] then we're missing the whole scope go
[7:12] that's what your prophet said he said
[7:14] people look back look forward
[7:16] he said that was Satan's way remember
[7:18] ready to either the Satan's way of doing
[7:20] it to get us to look back look forward
[7:23] well we ain't got because of this and
[7:26] then we were gonna get over that
[7:27] no it don't make no difference what you
[7:30] ain't got because of what you don't got
[7:32] back behind you ain't gonna work
[7:33] and there is no future because once you
[7:38] step over your present that was the
[7:42] point of trying to get you to see the I
[7:43] am to where that was always to be
[7:47] present tense for eternity all right now
[7:51] then in doing that see as we've come
[7:54] through the ages it's a marvelous thing
[7:57] because I believe it if you think about
[8:02] it most people think about the Book of
[8:04] Revelations on how would I say it that
[8:08] it's not Bible you know that it's
[8:13] something like added parts or doing this
[8:17] or doing something you know it's not to
[8:20] just say that it's the Word of God
[8:22] because they want to argue over what it
[8:24] shows all right now that's carnal I know
[8:28] but just think about what I'm trying to
[8:29] say that if you talk to most everybody
[8:33] about the book of Revelation we can't
[8:36] understand that
[8:37] there's no way to understand that that's
[8:40] we know what symbols we know it says we
[8:43] know what's that but we can't understand
[8:44] it well no I believe since the Prophet
[8:48] came I thought that was what he came for
[8:51] was to bring those things that were not
[8:54] made known before to bring it into the
[8:57] open to her that you and I could believe
[9:01] it and see it all right so there
[9:03] shouldn't be any problems with the Book
[9:07] of Revelations but now you want to get
[9:10] in the message people and start talks
[9:11] coming that tells time you find out you
[9:13] can run in trouble because they're gonna
[9:15] do it I believe it says now believing is
[9:17] that I believe seasonally we don't have
[9:19] no right to believe we just accept what
[9:21] God says and
[9:23] forget to rest because it won't work all
[9:25] right but getting to the point Jesus
[9:29] Christ is the theme of the entire Bible
[9:31] correct all right the bride's not to
[9:36] theme of the entire Bible the bride is
[9:39] Jesus Christ made manifest in another
[9:40] form she's not the theme the the ending
[9:45] up of all things wonderful is to be in
[9:48] you and me right we believe that but
[9:51] we're not the theme of the Bible he's
[9:53] the theme of the Bible don't ever get to
[9:55] the point do you think that you're as
[9:57] good as your master or anything we can't
[10:00] do that we're human beings and we need
[10:03] to stay right exactly where we're at and
[10:05] believe in it that way and we won't get
[10:07] out of any any problems in all right but
[10:11] when we come down to seeing it see you
[10:14] come through and you got the Old
[10:15] Testament written and then you come over
[10:17] and you come in to the book of Acts and
[10:19] it was the Acts of the Holy Ghost in the
[10:23] people all right then from there comes
[10:26] the church ages and the church age has
[10:29] come into being you know as to describe
[10:33] God to mankind that was the purpose but
[10:37] as it comes into being now think of what
[10:41] I'm saying if you live back there where
[10:42] Paul was that you wouldn't be looking to
[10:45] the past
[10:47] you wouldn't be looking to the future
[10:48] cuz he tell you not to do that he's
[10:51] wanting you to see what's going on right
[10:52] then right now see then the futures got
[10:57] its pool the Pisces got its work but yet
[11:00] if we don't stand with it to work we can
[11:02] see present tense then your Bibles not
[11:06] alive to you none is that blunt enough
[11:10] to where we can all understand it the
[11:12] Bible is not alive I don't care what you
[11:13] say and so although Bible is alive to me
[11:18] I've heard people make the statement you
[11:20] know when brother Brennan said since the
[11:22] opening of the seals he said the Bible
[11:23] become a brand-new book you know I
[11:26] believe it but it was only to him at
[11:29] that time but I've heard a lot of people
[11:32] that maybe has never read a seal book
[11:36] maybe never studied anything on the
[11:39] seals but get up and say since the
[11:41] opening of them seals now the Bible has
[11:44] become a brand-new book
[11:46] well why have you got the same old
[11:48] thoughts coming out of something that
[11:50] it's supposed to be new
[11:53] right
[11:55] if you don't something new why don't you
[11:58] claim it to be new like a prophet did it
[12:00] opened up things and What did he say
[12:03] that had never been made known to
[12:05] mankind that's what the opening of the
[12:09] seals brought into manifestation was
[12:12] those points all right now then in the
[12:17] church ages see you have a marvelous
[12:20] thing because the first church age was
[12:22] Christ alive and the people right and it
[12:26] was present tense John wrote it over
[12:29] here as we were talking about John wrote
[12:33] it after Paul had died the age will run
[12:36] jointly done dwindling away before John
[12:39] wrote it on Patmos that don't have
[12:42] nothing to do with it he was writing of
[12:46] what had been all right now but that
[12:51] didn't bring in to view the rest of the
[12:55] book so the rest of the book was not
[12:57] fulfilled right now get what I'm talking
[13:04] about and you'll see what I'm talking
[13:05] about writing of the Bible see that but
[13:06] then when the second church age was
[13:08] written you know what there was somebody
[13:12] to make that alive somebody has made as
[13:17] the Prophet said the word Alive forever
[13:19] age and every time all right we'll see
[13:23] you write the first church age second
[13:26] church age third church age fourth fifth
[13:28] six and seven when you come to the
[13:30] seventh you hit a marvelous situation
[13:32] all right now we're gonna pick up to
[13:35] that point right d'arco that's where we
[13:36] left off
[13:37] but what did we cover in the point that
[13:40] we're supposed to see the Bible
[13:43] and we could see it especially in the
[13:46] church ages and that's why I asked you
[13:48] to read the church ages that to me will
[13:51] help you understand Genesis and
[13:55] understand how God rocks his word first
[13:59] now what was the point
[14:01] first he always shows who he is right
[14:09] that's the theme of the entire Bible the
[14:12] theme of the entire Bible is Jesus
[14:13] Christ right prophet said if you don't
[14:16] see Christ in every verse go back and
[14:18] read again he's because you missed it
[14:19] because he's the theme of the Bible all
[14:21] right
[14:22] every time ever all through the Old
[14:25] Testament it was God trying to reveal
[14:29] himself to mankind those prophets
[14:34] standing there speaking of the future
[14:37] but to them there was a lot about the
[14:40] future that's why we kept reading it
[14:42] that it was made known unto them that
[14:44] they were that this was not for them it
[14:47] was revelation they stood there and
[14:49] looked at things that was be into the
[14:53] future right I mean that the prophets
[14:57] coming through and saying and they they
[14:59] knew it was not for them they knew it
[15:01] was for us that they didn't minister
[15:04] these things and as it's bringing forth
[15:06] then what's it saying he was alive to
[15:10] them no prophet ever spoke of a God
[15:17] somewheres else
[15:19] now I'll remind you what it says in the
[15:21] book of Romans it says that he's not up
[15:26] there paraphrasing it you don't need
[15:29] nobody to go up and get him and bring
[15:30] him down he's not down here that we need
[15:34] to get somebody to go get him and bring
[15:35] him up what does the scripture say he's
[15:38] naívi in thy heart in your mouth right
[15:44] he's naughty he's in you and that way
[15:48] you that's the only way we talk about
[15:51] what will bring a rapture you said
[15:53] brother day what will bring a rapture
[15:55] when the future becomes
[15:58] there's got to be a change there's
[16:01] nowhere to go
[16:02] did you listen to the point I said when
[16:04] the future becomes present you said
[16:09] that's crazy because it came no no
[16:10] you're not listening you step over in
[16:14] the future it's present there is no
[16:17] tomorrow and you get to tomorrow it's
[16:22] today
[16:23] simple enough right I'm accused of being
[16:26] so deep for whatever they're trying to
[16:28] but you're not just it's not listening
[16:30] to where I say it yeah those prophets
[16:36] saw things in that when when naman so
[16:39] chariots jostling in the streets I was
[16:43] the only thing he could describe it but
[16:45] What did he say he so Buicks and
[16:48] Oldsmobiles running into each other with
[16:49] lightning you know lights on going down
[16:51] the road it was something real to him
[16:55] right back down yet it would be maybe
[16:58] 3000 years or something before that
[17:02] would ever come into being but to him it
[17:05] was present see if future God will help
[17:11] you
[17:12] a pice God will help you there's no
[17:21] healer in the future because you're not
[17:24] there not even talking about it
[17:26] there's no healer in the pi's he was
[17:29] back there and heal people yeah but it
[17:32] was present tense was the Bible say we
[17:38] must believe that what that he is and
[17:42] that he's a rewarder of them that
[17:45] diligently seek Him get it out of
[17:49] present tense that's all I'm talking
[17:50] about all I'm dealing with is to try to
[17:54] get you and me to see what's taking
[17:56] place right here tonight
[18:00] that's how personal I'm talking that's
[18:03] how perfect present tense that I'm just
[18:06] trying to get you to see right here
[18:08] tonight
[18:11] see right here tonight the Pais and the
[18:14] future can come together and be the
[18:17] present tense of Almighty God living
[18:19] right here
[18:19] cuz there is no future and there is no
[18:22] past it's all present tense if I back up
[18:28] one day it was just yesterday but when I
[18:32] back up there it would be today
[18:34] you see that's calm if I go from one
[18:36] step forward it would be tomorrow but
[18:39] when I step there it will be today oh
[18:42] that's deep ain't it I mean that's just
[18:46] so deep we don't understand no you're
[18:48] not listening to what I'm saying there
[18:52] is no future there is no past it's all
[18:56] present tense
[19:01] what have we been stating when the past
[19:04] and the present and the future comes
[19:06] together in one point now you're gonna
[19:09] see a change right you're gonna see a
[19:14] change because that's what the change is
[19:18] see all right now what's now the opening
[19:24] of the word first as to what no matter
[19:28] if you old a New Testament now first it
[19:31] will describe God Genesis 1:1 says what
[19:39] in the beginning God created for rotz
[19:49] anything about all this other he tells
[19:51] you who he is is that the theme with us
[19:53] of the entire Bible all right what's the
[19:56] second part that has been in each church
[19:59] AG that I asked you to read them and see
[20:01] and we took them last week and just read
[20:04] them down through there and we're gonna
[20:05] read it in a minute and see all right
[20:07] first thing it'll show who he is
[20:13] next point he always praises the bride
[20:19] the shows
[20:21] is then he has to rebuke see first it
[20:38] reveals God second the praise of the
[20:41] bride
[20:42] the next is repute for getting off the
[20:45] word the next is bringing it right back
[20:50] to speak of the promise because he
[20:53] searched age did and then to come to the
[20:57] overcomer to show that promise now
[21:03] remember what we stated effort church
[21:08] age gets the full inheritance they don't
[21:13] just get a part of God so then the
[21:18] Prophet said all the proceeding and
[21:20] everything all will be what is it first
[21:23] church age was seen as this second
[21:25] church age looks like it sees him
[21:27] something know and this would be brought
[21:29] on over to the next over to the next
[21:31] what is the point this age I thought we
[21:35] believed that this age because of the
[21:39] Prophet would bring into being the
[21:42] complete revelation of Jesus Christ
[21:46] that's why we've read that from from
[21:48] first Peter because of what is brought
[21:51] to thee at the revelation of Jesus
[21:54] Christ now I'm not talking about a God
[21:58] to come I love when that prophet said it
[22:01] one day he said I'm not looking for him
[22:03] to come or saying he's coming I'm saying
[22:06] he's here see he lived in the world of
[22:09] present tense right because that's what
[22:17] he spoke that's easy to see that if you
[22:20] think about your prophet speaking in the
[22:22] first person is that right did the
[22:27] psalmist David say they pierced my hands
[22:29] and my feet and the things like that
[22:30] speaking as though he was Almighty God
[22:32] in what took place at Calvary
[22:35] see there's never God has never tried to
[22:38] reveal up iced and he did there's no
[22:41] need to worry about the future well
[22:45] that's what everybody wants they want
[22:48] the future they want to know who's gonna
[22:50] be President
[22:55] who's gonna do this who's gonna do that
[22:59] well what good would it be if he knowed
[23:05] what would it help if you knew what it
[23:09] was gonna be but why don't you accept
[23:12] what God gives that's why I told about
[23:14] time in the fellowship meeting they kept
[23:16] on about it you know
[23:17] oh we're we're gonna have a woman
[23:19] president we're gonna have a woman
[23:20] president and every one of them got up
[23:22] spoke about the woman president I got
[23:24] out and told them I said you want me to
[23:26] tell you who's gonna be the president
[23:28] well it's all looking I said you won't
[23:31] dust saith the Lord I said cause I'm
[23:36] gonna quote your scripture thus saith
[23:39] the Lord I put in Kings I take out Kings
[23:42] the one that God wants to be president
[23:45] is gonna be the president right well why
[23:51] can't we believe it like that and forget
[23:55] our own deals but are you getting the
[23:56] point now why did we cover how are we
[23:58] gonna reread I mean we're gonna read the
[24:00] 7th church we read the others and and
[24:02] used to point to show that first he
[24:04] tells who he is then he praises the
[24:07] bride then he rebukes the bride now use
[24:14] bride to keep people from saying church
[24:16] or whatever or you won't get the two
[24:18] confused and then the bride comes to the
[24:21] point of being the overcomer now read
[24:27] all of those to the overcomer and watch
[24:30] the one to this age what it is we get to
[24:36] it me all right so go ahead brothers if
[24:39] you will pull up revelation 3:14
[24:45] 3:13 3:13 I guess in in 13 verse 14 all
[24:51] right now remember we're looking for 314
[24:56] remember we're looking for God telling
[25:01] who is we're looking for him praising
[25:06] the church the bride we're looking for
[25:10] him to be rebuking then we're looking
[25:15] for him to come and show what is
[25:18] inherited to the overcomer and when you
[25:21] see the overcomer of this age what the
[25:23] Bible says then you'll see we have
[25:25] inherited ever age from the Pais up we
[25:29] get the overcomer or the first church
[25:32] age we get the overcomer of the second
[25:35] the third one because we get the
[25:37] complete revelation of all things right
[25:41] now look what he's saying okay and unto
[25:45] the Angel of the Church of lady of
[25:47] seon's write these things saith the Amen
[25:48] the faithful and true witness the
[25:50] beginning of the creation of God so now
[25:52] who's it it's Robyn himself with who's
[25:57] he described it in Genesis 1 in the
[26:01] beginning God created heavens near who's
[26:04] he describing alright and watch him now
[26:10] you you can't line up the seventh church
[26:15] age I like the way God writes things
[26:17] because see you can kind of take a point
[26:20] you can line it up for the 1st 2nd 3rd
[26:22] 4th 5th 6th 7th 6 Church ages and
[26:25] they'll all kind of fall in line in the
[26:28] seventh you got to kind of go up and
[26:29] down to see because there's very little
[26:31] praising in the seventh Church 8 there's
[26:37] more rebuking in the seventh church age
[26:39] than any age
[26:47] because it's to finish it all up brother
[26:50] branham said in this age will be the
[26:54] wondrous glorious revelation of all
[27:00] things and how in showing where God is
[27:06] and what he's taking place in this age
[27:08] is to be revealed
[27:10] it shows the complete understanding of
[27:13] the Antichrist but it shows the complete
[27:18] revelation of Jesus Christ I watch that
[27:21] as we go through color watch what he
[27:23] says I know thy works remember every age
[27:26] gets that statement every Church age got
[27:29] that statement I know that works because
[27:32] that's not works like we try to have
[27:33] works to it that's a life lived by Jesus
[27:37] Christ in you that's the best way to say
[27:39] works I know that works that aren't
[27:42] neither cold or hot a would our work
[27:45] cold or hot now that's just not a false
[27:48] vine that's to the true vine the true
[27:51] vine is rebuked in each church age as
[27:53] well as the false fine okay come on now
[27:58] so then because thou art lukewarm and
[28:00] neither cold nor hot
[28:02] I'll spew thee out of my mouth it's
[28:05] gonna be done the biggest force in the
[28:07] world gonna be spewed out his mouth end
[28:09] of the tribulation listen why because I
[28:12] said I'm rich and increased with Goods
[28:14] and have need of nothing and knowest not
[28:17] that thou art wretched and miserable and
[28:19] poor and blind and naked
[28:21] I'll get much praise I counsel thee to
[28:26] buy of me gold in the fire that thou
[28:28] mayst be rich and white raiment see a
[28:32] challenge instead of a praise a
[28:34] challenge that thou may us be clothed
[28:37] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[28:39] not appear and not ours what I say that
[28:41] I may see a challenge to us cause in
[28:46] this age like I said the Antichrist is
[28:48] gonna come to his height through
[28:51] development or whatever as well as Jesus
[28:54] Christ the most deceiving age right the
[28:59] seventh search age
[29:00] the most deceiving age of all things
[29:05] because you can't tell who the bride is
[29:08] and who's not oh yeah we can't well okay
[29:14] that's all right
[29:15] but he said I counsel the in other words
[29:17] I charge you I plead with you cuz
[29:21] finally he'll get down and knocking at
[29:23] the door trying to get back in to his
[29:26] own church right look as many as I love
[29:30] I rebuke and chasten be zealous
[29:33] therefore and repent behold I stand at
[29:37] the door knock and if man any man hear
[29:40] my voice and open the door I'll come in
[29:42] to him and will sup with him and he with
[29:45] me not a lot of praise in this age but a
[29:52] lot not a lot of bragging in this church
[30:00] age God a source age you all come on if
[30:08] you read the church ages you know what
[30:10] I'm saying is right you always had a
[30:12] pray I mean you had an opening to who
[30:15] God was a praise of the people a rebuke
[30:18] but then turning right back to showing
[30:20] that he never changed no part and to the
[30:25] overcomer of that age he gives a great
[30:28] revelation now let's see if we can find
[30:34] that all the revelation ends in this age
[30:36] okay to him that overcometh I'll grant
[30:39] to sit with me in my throne even as I
[30:48] also overcame and sat down with my
[30:50] father and his from he didn't say on
[30:54] this throne he said in his throne he's
[30:59] all we're gonna set up there on the
[31:01] stage with him that's nothing to me
[31:05] I don't care I'm honest I'll be glad to
[31:08] just take a back row seat no problem
[31:13] I don't have to be that but I want to be
[31:16] in his room or in other words I want is
[31:20] thrown in me so you see the challenge of
[31:22] this age
[31:23] to him that overcometh our grant to sit
[31:25] with me in my throne even as I also
[31:27] overcame and I'm sitting down with my
[31:29] father in his strong will get to
[31:32] revelations for next we'll see how he
[31:34] goes from his throne to the Father
[31:37] strong we'll deal with that oh yeah he
[31:41] that have the ear let him hear what the
[31:42] spirit saith unto the churches
[31:44] always the same challenge to each one
[31:47] but listen church what I said and I'm
[31:53] serious you read it there this age is
[31:58] the worst age of all this is the worst
[32:03] age that has ever been because it's the
[32:10] most deceiving one that has ever been it
[32:16] will deceive the very elect if possible
[32:18] no know what your prophet said but I
[32:22] know a lot what he said - he said now
[32:25] you're not no no you know you're not
[32:27] gonna overcome that believer he said
[32:30] that won't work all right but how did he
[32:35] come what did he come up with when he
[32:36] said he said frankly to get him so mixed
[32:39] up now do you need that one he said
[32:43] frankly get him all mixed up so mixed up
[32:46] they didn't have to cut the work short
[32:52] let us say it told you we'll pick up
[32:55] something from this church age that I
[33:00] hope will help us because it's the most
[33:03] horrible age that's ever been the
[33:11] Antichrist comes to his full whew Tricia
[33:14] nor ever how you say that wording he
[33:16] comes to a full point in this age
[33:22] this is the age of the most deception
[33:25] that had ever been very little praise
[33:30] did you read in the seventh church age
[33:33] not like the first church age where it's
[33:35] a hour you know you you hate that deeds
[33:38] you against them things and all like
[33:40] that
[33:40] the seventh Church age is just flowing
[33:44] through the age as he goes backwards and
[33:47] forth to praise but at the same time
[33:51] he's rebuking right you say yeah but
[33:59] brother Dale we've got the most word
[34:00] dogs for the problems that not the
[34:03] problem with the most word the problem
[34:06] is is what we think with God now you
[34:08] tell me these brothers has preached for
[34:10] 40 50 years brother Branham was a
[34:12] prophet and now they're out there
[34:15] turning against it now you tell me they
[34:18] had a revelation of Jesus Christ I'm
[34:20] gonna tell you up front there's
[34:21] something wrong with you they did not
[34:24] know revelation of Jesus Christ they had
[34:30] their own concept their own thoughts and
[34:32] it turned and took him away the most
[34:35] deceiving age that has ever been like I
[34:42] was trying to explain it to one brother
[34:43] one day and he said well that's good
[34:45] point so you can't fall off of a house
[34:47] to use it upon it that's just plain
[34:50] common sense well you see the Bible says
[34:56] they must be a falling away right why so
[35:04] that they that are approved may be made
[35:06] manifest the falling away couldn't
[35:09] happen in the sixties and the seventies
[35:11] in the eighties the people were not that
[35:15] close to the word see when you got into
[35:20] the computer age and everything you just
[35:22] you've got a complete rush of the word
[35:26] through all of the abilities and the
[35:29] things to come forth and don't get me
[35:32] wrong I've got three or four computers
[35:35] and
[35:36] you but that's what I said when they
[35:39] started with the computer I said this is
[35:42] the most damaging thing that could ever
[35:45] happen to the people of this message I
[35:47] said because they won't sit down and
[35:50] read they've not read the Bible they've
[35:54] not read the message you know they
[35:59] haven't listened to it and had to read
[36:01] it and hunt it and do all the things
[36:02] they just well I got a quote here I've
[36:06] got 15 quotes on this so what if you got
[36:11] one that's against you there's something
[36:13] wrong somewhere it's this is not one of
[36:18] those pile up accounts well I got 30
[36:20] quotes I mean you got well I've only got
[36:23] three well I've got you beat that's kind
[36:27] of bad as that boy was it worked that
[36:28] time that told me he said well you in
[36:31] bad shape
[36:31] did you believe one god I said sure do
[36:33] he said I believe in three okay that's
[36:37] her business if you don't believe in
[36:38] three I just don't believe it I believe
[36:40] in one God he said then my three would
[36:42] build one I said we'll probably come to
[36:50] find that out one of these days but
[36:51] ain't gonna arguably the Scott I got his
[36:55] point his point was that he had three
[36:58] gods they could take care of the one but
[37:00] that won't work too good all right but
[37:03] now listen I want to make sure you don't
[37:10] follow don't get the wrong idea because
[37:14] dens truly is still the same layout in
[37:17] the seventh church age as all the others
[37:21] God revealing himself God praising those
[37:26] that stayed with the word God having to
[37:30] rebuke both true and false fine and then
[37:37] God bringing the people to being
[37:39] overcomers in this age now you think
[37:42] about where he says we're going
[37:47] he said sit with me and my throne not
[37:54] only throne now in my throne as I said
[38:00] was my father in his throne so now the
[38:03] same way that he climbed to that throne
[38:05] you know I got to see then that's the
[38:12] most wonderful age to think about now
[38:17] listen to the point because if you're
[38:19] sitting with him in his throne
[38:22] you're not paced and you're not future
[38:27] that was the whole point to drive down
[38:30] to what I'm just saying if you're
[38:32] sitting with him in his throne you might
[38:35] be able to set all the throne somewhere
[38:37] or do something but when you're sitting
[38:39] in his throne there's no way to be
[38:44] deceived because we know what his throne
[38:48] is what is he strong
[38:51] it's just Kingdom it's his domain it's
[38:52] his and he's living in each one of us do
[39:00] you see the point this age we get the
[39:05] complete revelation of Jesus Christ you
[39:08] agree right now by giving the complete
[39:13] revelation of Jesus Christ we know who
[39:16] is we know worried that we know what
[39:22] he's doing and we know how it's gonna
[39:25] end up in this age what a marvelous age
[39:32] but a marvelous point or a thought to
[39:38] think about this age
[39:40] we'll be able to sit with him and his
[39:42] strong like we were talking whether the
[39:46] brothers are there today see didn't the
[39:48] Bible said you know let my son sit with
[39:50] the one on one side one on the other
[39:54] Jesus said that's not for me to give you
[39:58] remember he said
[40:00] now that trial or maybe I'm paraphrasing
[40:05] but that trial has not been put forth
[40:09] yet now we get the scripture and read it
[40:13] they said in other words it's not come
[40:16] yet for an overcomer to overcome enough
[40:21] to be able to sit one on each side of it
[40:24] you get it see to sit with him in his
[40:32] throne I don't care if I'm way back off
[40:35] yeah I know you'd say the same thing
[40:37] they don't matter where we are there but
[40:39] what about somebody's gonna be chosen to
[40:42] sit on one side of it and somebody only
[40:44] called Jesus said they would know that
[40:48] mother she had that desire in her heart
[40:49] let my children sit one on one side when
[40:53] he said that's not given yet the Prophet
[40:58] said that trial had not been brought but
[41:01] you know out of this age will come
[41:06] someone who can sit with him in his
[41:09] throne to be able to sit with him in his
[41:17] throne what a wonderful opportunity what
[41:22] a wonderful opportunity but now here's
[41:25] the type of things that I look at who
[41:28] would he pick to sit on one side or the
[41:30] other the smartest not necessarily the
[41:35] most releve did you know not necessarily
[41:44] what was the incidents that have are
[41:47] they description the Prophet gave of
[41:49] when the King was going to ride
[41:52] triumphantly through the city what did
[41:54] he give he had men out there that had
[41:58] killed all kind of enemies that they had
[42:01] fought they had run their battles and
[42:04] everything and they were all around him
[42:07] and he had to pick one to sit with him
[42:11] and who do you
[42:14] he looks down to one that's down in the
[42:17] crowded ain't even looking up and he
[42:21] said sir said where'd you get all the
[42:22] wounds he said in a defence of you look
[42:24] my king
[42:26] he said come on up here it's not the
[42:31] great Revelator who's gonna sit there if
[42:34] you understand what I mean it's not the
[42:37] head knowledge and the things that we
[42:38] think of the message that doesn't grant
[42:41] us the right to sit with him beside of
[42:44] him
[42:45] it'll be granted to somebody that
[42:47] there'll be a part it has to be overcome
[42:49] I look for a quote for probably thirty
[42:57] years finally found some close points
[43:00] but brother Brennan was speaking one day
[43:02] and he was talking about this overcoming
[43:05] situation and he was talking about you
[43:10] know things and he said it's those that
[43:13] have overcome all of this stuff in this
[43:17] age the stuff of this age the things of
[43:24] this age the life the doings the
[43:27] temptations the trials
[43:39] what is it then sitting in here strum
[43:44] all we see that'll be Shan Shan Shan's
[43:48] oh that's alright
[43:49] I don't know problem but it might be
[43:53] somebody that has no idea they're going
[43:55] to be sitting there until the time comes
[43:58] cuz they don't understand what they've
[44:01] overcome but around said thinking of her
[44:03] a minute ago he said we're gonna have to
[44:05] overcome self living you remember that
[44:10] one overcome self living well none of us
[44:17] wants to go back to the horse and buggy
[44:19] little brother Gary Atkins holiday men
[44:23] ah I said that we've talked about that
[44:26] we don't want to go back to the horse
[44:28] and buggy we don't want to go back to
[44:32] the nun AC we don't want to go back to
[44:37] none of that and we don't have to go
[44:42] back to that that's the point I like we
[44:47] don't have to and it wouldn't make us no
[44:50] more religious our releve today how you
[44:54] would say you know great revelation
[44:55] doesn't come because of our our how do
[44:59] they call that word whether we're trying
[45:01] to be as low as you could be as omble as
[45:03] you can be that's well and good but the
[45:09] main thing is to see who he is
[45:13] that's what who that's gonna be gift to
[45:17] see who he is and what's going on and
[45:19] what he's done and it doesn't make us
[45:23] you know anything you don't get it
[45:28] all built up about how much you see cuz
[45:32] remember it's not in that realm is who
[45:39] he chooses you know God has marvelous as
[45:44] mark he's marvelous about his choosing
[45:49] I mean would we choose the things he
[45:53] chose what about him choosing Judas to
[46:01] walk with him yet knowing he would be
[46:05] the guy that turned him in what about
[46:13] this overcomer sitting in his strong now
[46:18] here's my point I'll try to get to then
[46:20] I'll bring this one little point and you
[46:22] know as I said this age there's not a
[46:27] lot of bragging it's there because he
[46:35] cherishes the church and dozens good
[46:38] about her but there's not a lot of
[46:42] praise about a good will the emphases in
[46:51] the seventh church age is the overcomer
[47:01] that's the emphasis that's the point of
[47:04] each church age right there's a final
[47:06] part of overcomer and what is to be but
[47:08] what about the last one
[47:13] each one of the others we can take that
[47:15] and read it they get a revelation of
[47:17] this they get a revelation of that right
[47:21] each church age gets a revelation of his
[47:24] deity right then almost say that riding
[47:27] it they get a revelation with the
[47:29] seventh church age gets the revelation
[47:34] of his person and sees where he's at
[47:39] see where he's leaving what he's doing
[47:44] alright and that's an odd way of saying
[47:46] it but to some of all I've said a great
[47:51] revelation doesn't do much good in the
[47:53] past the future to come to know all the
[47:59] emphases of everything and how
[48:00] everything fits and work fits and all
[48:03] that's well and good but that's not much
[48:07] more than reading the newspaper but it's
[48:13] to those people now listen to the point
[48:15] I'm trying to hear what makes this group
[48:18] of people so special what makes this
[48:23] seventh church age that he would choose
[48:25] you to live in it there's something LOX
[48:30] about you something he likes about you
[48:37] might be funny how he talks about it but
[48:40] it's something he likes about you cuz we
[48:44] were chosen for this age he done his
[48:51] choosing for research age he chose out a
[48:53] church all right he chose the people
[48:55] that could make the morning star come
[48:58] into being he chose to those that could
[49:00] bring forth the revelation of his name
[49:02] and the things and and all of each
[49:04] overcomer had a revelation but to this
[49:07] age he gives them everything from there
[49:09] back to here and it's none of it is paid
[49:14] I mean you know none of its past because
[49:17] there was somebody to make manifest the
[49:19] first church age right somebody to make
[49:23] manifest the second church age third
[49:25] fourth field see except why can't we
[49:27] realize who's making manifest this
[49:29] church age because it was wrote up 2,000
[49:33] years ago they ain't gonna do it you
[49:38] realize that he has chosen you and me to
[49:42] walk in this age he's got to raise him
[49:54] and then to show where this aged people
[49:57] wind up sitting in his throne with him
[50:10] not in the future and not in the past I
[50:13] keep saying that over and over cuz
[50:15] that's that's my whole point
[50:17] a present tense God is on the guard that
[50:21] can do you any good
[50:23] heist guard won't do you any good future
[50:26] guard won't do you any good now come on
[50:27] give what I'm saying
[50:28] it's guard reality right now to you to
[50:33] let you him know who you are
[50:40] no don't you think about something I
[50:44] didn't give these to them because I just
[50:48] wanted to leave it the prophet of God
[50:53] said this day the scripture is fulfilled
[51:01] there they are right back in their
[51:03] nation this day this scripture is
[51:11] fulfilled
[51:12] the Jews in their homeland this day the
[51:26] scripture is fulfilled this day the
[51:31] scripture is fulfilled the lady you see
[51:34] in church age this day this scripture in
[51:42] Matthew 24 is fulfilled the world is in
[51:48] a corruption the whole thing nation
[51:51] against nation earthquakes diverse
[51:53] places great whirl winds coming down
[51:56] shaking the nation and so forth great
[51:58] disaster devil for this day
[52:00] this scripture is fulfilled
[52:06] and we found out the conditions of the
[52:08] world we see where the church normal
[52:11] normal organization denomination we see
[52:16] where they are we see where the nations
[52:18] are and we see this day these promises
[52:24] is fulfilled now but in this day there
[52:32] is to come a super royal seed of Abraham
[52:41] that's exactly what it'll be would be a
[52:44] royal bride to the royal promised son as
[52:47] a spoke last night
[52:49] it won't be a natural seed it'll be a
[52:51] spiritual seed there's to be a spiritual
[52:53] bride rise up which will be the royal
[52:57] seed of the royal faith of abraham's
[52:59] royal son used to come on the scene in
[53:04] the last days and the time in the place
[53:07] is a promise that's gift to her
[53:10] according to malachi for a scripture
[53:14] there's to rise a message that will
[53:16] shake the hearts of the people right
[53:18] back to the Apostolic fathers again
[53:20] there is two rides one on the scene and
[53:23] the power of Elijah that arrived on the
[53:25] scene a wilderness man that'll come out
[53:27] and we'll have a message that will run
[53:29] right straight back to the word again
[53:32] that's the hour that we're living in
[53:42] he goes then to the point and in the
[53:48] story he tells then he had a vision of
[53:53] what was it seven times eight things or
[53:57] some vision of all the things all of
[54:01] them have been fulfilled but one or two
[54:03] that you could think about what do you
[54:09] say in brother Dale I'm saying when are
[54:12] we gonna recognize where we're at this
[54:17] day all the Scriptures has been
[54:20] fulfilled pertaining to you and me he
[54:27] talking about the Israel and the laterz
[54:29] and they're doing some saying just what
[54:32] he said not like him or no thought but
[54:36] saying it to your thoughts and mine this
[54:38] day the Word of God has been brought to
[54:42] you and I if nothing else maybe it's in
[54:47] our possession you know what I mean
[54:50] holding the message carrying the message
[54:51] whatever but what about it I've read the
[55:01] scripture with a dozen or more evidences
[55:04] that we're living in the last day the
[55:10] generation that will see Jesus Christ
[55:13] returned to the earth and I say to you
[55:17] tonight again this day this scripture is
[55:22] fulfilled in your side but yet we're
[55:28] still looking we're still looking for
[55:34] the coming of the Lord why
[55:41] yet we've got the message the message
[55:45] declares him to be present not future in
[55:49] the past the transmission does not refer
[55:53] does not do it sure he tells about the
[55:55] pipes he tells about the future cuz all
[55:58] of that's involved but what's his main
[56:00] point when David was facing the life he
[56:13] put everything he had upon what God had
[56:17] told him and dealt with him he'd killed
[56:20] the bar
[56:21] he killed the line nothing was able to
[56:24] stand in his way and he said now Goliath
[56:30] you gonna be like they are he said this
[56:34] day this scripture is going to be
[56:38] fulfilled do you think he wanted a
[56:44] future god you think he wanted a pice
[56:48] god or he used to pastors and evidence
[56:53] that's fine
[56:54] but what was his point he said this day
[56:57] I'll take your head off well when he
[57:02] stood there he could looked and said
[57:03] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[57:07] don't you think it's about time we begin
[57:10] to believe this prophets message well
[57:16] probably I believe everything he says
[57:17] now I'm human but I try to be straight
[57:22] with you mentally we believe mentally we
[57:30] believe but a mental revelation won't
[57:35] face a giant
[57:39] right so remember our point this age the
[57:47] overcomers to be what to sit with me and
[57:50] my throne it's all had him sitting on
[57:59] the throne looking at him as Great God
[58:03] Jehovah but David had him present tense
[58:11] don't you think it's about time we begin
[58:14] to believe as the Prophet said I've give
[58:17] you many evidences of this day being the
[58:21] end what are you looking for I'm looking
[58:30] at something present tense I'm not
[58:34] trying to call God up from a grave I'm
[58:37] not trying to bring him down from
[58:38] somewhere in heaven Paul told us not to
[58:41] do that salvation doesn't come on the
[58:47] basis of our do it what does it come on
[58:49] confess with your mouth and believe in
[58:53] your heart that he's gonna save me one
[58:57] of these days
[58:58] that's not exactly scriptural it may
[59:02] sound good but in Scripture the church
[59:09] we're gonna have to get to a point of
[59:10] having God present tense because that's
[59:14] the only way you can say this day this
[59:15] scripture is fulfilled and we can look
[59:18] at the car that he saw we could look at
[59:22] all of the things of the visions that he
[59:24] saw and say those things took place this
[59:33] still has got to be a reality of
[59:34] something real
[59:40] like my wife said when we first was
[59:42] listening to the message maybe the first
[59:44] three or four messages we listening to
[59:46] and run around telling the things that
[59:48] had happened she said it like this and
[59:50] we were just good old Baptists you know
[59:51] no Holy Ghost no born-again experience
[59:54] she said if he's done what he says he's
[59:57] done he had to be a prophet well that's
[1:00:01] the best way to start this way to start
[1:00:06] is just put it all down and say well
[1:00:08] okay I'm gonna believe it but I hope you
[1:00:14] listen to what I'm talking about it's
[1:00:15] not a point that I'm just trying to get
[1:00:18] you to see something present tense is
[1:00:24] your God real then you can say this day
[1:00:34] this scripture is fulfilled you say
[1:00:39] brother Dale I received the new birth
[1:00:40] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:00:43] brother Dale I've come to a lot of
[1:00:45] things in the message this day this
[1:00:47] scripture is fulfilled I've seen God do
[1:00:51] a lot of things this day this scripture
[1:00:53] is fulfilled
[1:00:56] are you listening somebody has got to
[1:01:00] live this age we sure look I don't see a
[1:01:07] lot of people that's doing a pretty good
[1:01:08] job of living it right but what about me
[1:01:13] and you you see I know that I say things
[1:01:23] and and people they they turn against me
[1:01:26] but I ain't got time to listen to a
[1:01:28] bunch of garbage this thing's running
[1:01:30] out whether you like it or not there's a
[1:01:34] lot of us in this building ain't gonna
[1:01:36] make it too much longer brother duel cuz
[1:01:41] we're getting old and death is gonna
[1:01:44] take its toll you know what I told them
[1:01:47] at the fellowship meeting I said God
[1:01:49] don't come pretty quick we're gonna have
[1:01:50] fellowship meetings in the nursing home
[1:01:54] you know what we'd be doing in the
[1:01:56] nursing home what did he say he said
[1:01:59] something about me believing three cards
[1:02:01] I do too yeah that's about as much as we
[1:02:04] believe the church listen it's serious
[1:02:09] as you can be in your life is God
[1:02:12] present tense to you I know this
[1:02:18] statement ain't gonna move over too good
[1:02:20] but you know there's a lot of times I
[1:02:22] wished God was in three parts he's a
[1:02:26] brother Dale because maybe somewhere in
[1:02:29] between the three of them they'd forget
[1:02:30] about me
[1:02:35] that's what I mean by maybe they'd
[1:02:38] forget about me and what I am because
[1:02:40] they'd be dealing with each other but
[1:02:43] ain't no three gods I ain't got to worry
[1:02:44] about I gotta facing myself which this
[1:02:48] hurts why can't we say this day I have
[1:02:52] put everything I've got into this
[1:02:55] message come on you know around this
[1:03:00] message what they're doing today we
[1:03:03] don't have to throw off on nobody it's
[1:03:05] not nothing but you know where they're
[1:03:07] going and what they're going after let
[1:03:13] me see this day this scripture is
[1:03:16] fulfilled they must need to be a falling
[1:03:18] away and to be a falling away you got to
[1:03:20] be up there close so a lot of people
[1:03:22] have been closed and fell away what
[1:03:30] about a God that would allow us to be
[1:03:36] brought to a place like he is he said
[1:03:39] what brother Dale my God is too good he
[1:03:41] wouldn't let me be tempted and
[1:03:44] persecuted and tried and he wouldn't
[1:03:48] what give you that authority well then I
[1:03:53] can quote to you about millions of them
[1:03:55] that died at the martyr estates that he
[1:03:58] knew there's going to do it and he
[1:04:00] permitted it to take place so let's
[1:04:03] don't go on the basis that we're so
[1:04:04] goody-goody but do you get what I'm
[1:04:10] saying can you see that we're in the end
[1:04:15] time or are you just living a day-by-day
[1:04:18] routine of a message part are we just
[1:04:20] some other cult some other group of
[1:04:23] people that have come along
[1:04:30] or do we believe that he's real but the
[1:04:39] thing about it is you don't have to
[1:04:40] worry about because he's gonna overcome
[1:04:43] this age is gonna overcome everything
[1:04:47] Satan throws at it somebody's gonna do
[1:04:50] it this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:04:52] among everything's being thrown that you
[1:04:55] can be thrown he's gonna try you to see
[1:05:00] whether you'll stay with the truth no
[1:05:02] I'll see if you got your little feelings
[1:05:05] heard about this or about to add or some
[1:05:07] kind of a point or whatever the thought
[1:05:09] of Jill come on musicians just think

[1:05:56] tense I want to be here because this is
[1:06:00] where God's at he's not in the future he
