[6:46] amen you want to see him tonight
[6:48] wherever you are at home
[6:50] looking in watching in here tonight
[6:53] we want to see the lord and there's one
[6:55] way to see him is by
[6:56] the opening of the word let's go to
[7:00] second corinthians chapter 4 verses
[7:03] 1 to 6. and before we get into the word
[7:06] let's just go
[7:07] right to the lord in prayer well god we
[7:10] thank you so much for being able to
[7:12] gather here tonight lord
[7:14] we're gathered around the word even
[7:15] though all of us aren't here
[7:17] in one physical location lord and we
[7:20] know lord the devil tries to prevent
[7:22] things and hinder and
[7:24] cause all kinds of distress in the world
[7:25] but there's one thing that we have
[7:27] constant confidence in
[7:29] and that's the power of the revealed
[7:30] word and that reveal word is still just
[7:32] as powerful today because you're still
[7:34] the same yesterday today and forever
[7:36] you're still moving in your people just
[7:38] the same as you have for the last two
[7:39] thousand years
[7:41] and on before that all through the all
[7:43] through the scripture lord god you're
[7:44] still the same today lord jesus
[7:46] and we believe it lord god and i pray
[7:48] lord that you'll help something to be
[7:49] said tonight lord that we'll quicken
[7:51] lord and
[7:52] strengthen and help help us on our
[7:54] journey lord god in these
[7:55] and this time lord jesus that we're
[7:57] living in to draw closer to you lord god
[8:00] we pray
[8:00] granted lord that you'll just give your
[8:02] blessing to the service
[8:04] lord here and in all the people's homes
[8:06] that are watching in all
[8:07] all around the world lord we pray in the
[8:09] name of the lord jesus christ we ask
[8:10] this blessing amen
[8:13] so i want to speak tonight on a little
[8:16] topic
[8:17] that i kind of been studying on the last
[8:19] few days called the age of deception
[8:22] because of course this is the most
[8:23] deceiving age there is that brother
[8:25] brown
[8:26] told us about and how everything just
[8:28] kind of winds up in this age to be
[8:29] so deceiving that people people are
[8:32] caught up in this deception well
[8:34] let me let me not get into preaching yet
[8:36] let's read the scripture and then we'll
[8:37] get to talking about it
[8:39] ii second corinthians chapter four verse
[8:41] one to six says therefore seeing we have
[8:43] this ministry as if we have received
[8:45] mercy
[8:46] we faint not but ever announce the
[8:50] hidden things of dishonesty
[8:52] not walking and crafting us nor handling
[8:55] the word of god deceitfully
[8:57] but by manifestation of the truth
[8:59] commending ourselves to every man's
[9:01] conscience
[9:02] in the sight of god but if our gospel be
[9:05] here that is hid to them that are lost
[9:07] in whom the god of this world hath
[9:08] blinded the the minds of them which
[9:11] believe not
[9:12] lest the light of the glorious gospel of
[9:14] christ who is the image of god
[9:16] should shine unto them for we preach not
[9:19] ourselves but christ jesus the lord and
[9:21] ourselves
[9:22] your servants for jesus satan for god
[9:25] who commanded the light to shine out of
[9:27] darkness
[9:28] hath shined in our hearts to give the
[9:31] light of the knowledge of the glory of
[9:33] god
[9:33] in the face of jesus christ you can be
[9:36] seated
[9:38] there is a lot packed into that little
[9:40] scripture yeah
[9:42] first of all it talks about in in verse
[9:45] two you if you want to just kind of
[9:46] leave that up just for a second i just
[9:48] just kind of walk through this scripture
[9:49] a little bit and verse two it talks
[9:51] about how
[9:52] how that we're not talking about things
[9:54] in craftiness
[9:56] we're not walking in craftiness and
[9:58] we're not handling the word
[9:59] deceitfully and our gospel in verse
[10:01] three is not hid
[10:04] it's not declared in some kind of in
[10:06] other words we're not trying to trap
[10:07] people into this
[10:09] and i think maybe maybe in the past
[10:11] sometimes the word is
[10:12] it has been preached maybe deceitfully
[10:14] or craftily or whatever
[10:16] but the word can be the the gospel that
[10:19] we have is
[10:19] is a gospel that can be declared openly
[10:22] and plainly
[10:23] from the beginning of the end especially
[10:25] now with the truth that we have
[10:27] we have the liberty to be able to preach
[10:29] the end from the end of the beginning
[10:30] the beginning to the end
[10:32] even into the depths of the symbol
[10:34] symbols in the book of revelation
[10:36] and the seals and all those things and
[10:37] what they mean
[10:39] they could be declared openly and by
[10:41] that declaring those things openly you
[10:43] can see that the devil has blinded the
[10:46] people's eyes to the truth
[10:47] in this age and this this is the age
[10:50] where
[10:51] god has just pulled out all of the stops
[10:53] and given us
[10:54] every ammunition everything we have need
[10:56] of to combat the devil
[10:59] and and and the devil is rising up to
[11:01] blind the world to the truth
[11:03] to blind people to the truth so let's
[11:05] see what he says in verse 4
[11:07] in whom the god of this world hath
[11:09] blinded the minds of them which believe
[11:11] not lest the light of the glorious
[11:13] gospel of christ
[11:14] who is the image of god should shine
[11:17] unto them
[11:19] and verse 6 for god who commanded the
[11:21] light to shine out of darkness
[11:23] hath shined in our hearts to give the
[11:26] light
[11:26] of the knowledge of the glory of god and
[11:28] the face
[11:29] of jesus christ so when darkness comes
[11:32] god will raise up a standard and the
[11:34] standard is his word and he gives us his
[11:36] word to shine a light in a dark place
[11:38] to give us a way away and a reason to
[11:41] walk a
[11:41] a way to know the hour and the place
[11:44] that we're living in
[11:45] now now maybe just to kind of start
[11:47] things off i want to just read this
[11:48] quote
[11:49] from brother branham and the god of this
[11:51] evil age where he just kind of set the
[11:52] the stage
[11:54] as he was delivering that message he
[11:56] said i'd be a hypocrite to try to bring
[11:58] something that i know that you would be
[12:00] pleased with and it'd be against god's
[12:02] word or something to draw a crowd
[12:04] or something like that i i wouldn't be
[12:07] what i'm
[12:07] here to be a minister of christ i want
[12:10] to bring
[12:10] something that is a vital use to you not
[12:13] just to be
[12:14] seen but to think it's something that if
[12:16] i die today
[12:18] tomorrow it'll be anchored in your heart
[12:20] to go on and serve god
[12:22] amen so i want to just read that tonight
[12:25] to just kind of echo that sentiment
[12:27] that you know you know we really when
[12:28] you when you think about what the gospel
[12:30] is the gospel is not something to just
[12:33] to like brother what brother louise was
[12:35] preaching on sunday
[12:36] it's not just something for us to have a
[12:38] club that we join and that we're all
[12:40] part of a big a big movement movement or
[12:42] anything
[12:42] but it's something that we're actually
[12:44] trying to get out of here and when you
[12:46] you me and zach we're talking on the way
[12:47] over here when you're when you're born
[12:49] again you begin to see things for as
[12:51] they truly are
[12:52] and you begin to look around the things
[12:54] that are taken on the earth
[12:55] the place in the earth and the way that
[12:57] people are and really our desire your
[12:59] desire becomes that i want to get out of
[13:01] here
[13:02] i want to get out of here at all costs
[13:04] and you see the way
[13:06] that we get out of here the way if you
[13:08] would imagine the
[13:09] uh satan coming in with a bunch of
[13:11] cockroaches and the lights are off and
[13:13] the way to have power over that is by
[13:17] turning on the light
[13:18] that's why that brother brandon preached
[13:20] that sermon there's a man here that can
[13:21] turn on the light when he was down in
[13:22] that in that cave
[13:24] out west and he said there's a man here
[13:26] the man that can turn on the light is
[13:27] jesus christ
[13:29] and he does it by the word so the gospel
[13:32] is not hid
[13:33] satan is blind to the eyes of the
[13:35] unbeliever the light of god's word has
[13:37] shined in our hearts
[13:39] again i'm going to be maybe quoting
[13:40] brother louise he was he preached that
[13:42] excellent sermon about how the light
[13:44] shone in the days of creation the light
[13:48] was turned on and it and it began to uh
[13:51] shine on the earth just as the light
[13:53] when it's turned on in your heart
[13:55] shines and begins to show show the word
[13:59] so that you
[13:59] you read the bible with new eyesight it
[14:01] begins you begin to be able to see how
[14:03] you're supposed to be walking
[14:05] and the light exposes satan now now
[14:08] really
[14:08] the the one thing that really got me
[14:11] reading the message to god of this evil
[14:13] age is because i've
[14:14] really been going back and reading
[14:15] through all the the sermons that
[14:17] uh on the seals that sister chris
[14:19] christine transcribed
[14:21] and it really and which is a great
[14:24] blessing if you haven't taken advantage
[14:25] of that
[14:26] uh you know i i sometimes i profit a lot
[14:29] more from just being able to read
[14:31] almost then from listening but when you
[14:33] can read and just really digest and get
[14:35] in there and things
[14:36] i i sometimes can really begin to open
[14:38] up so
[14:39] if you haven't already uh seek that out
[14:42] and see if you can take advantage of
[14:43] that
[14:44] but some things just i believe just
[14:46] began to open up to me that i had not
[14:48] seen before
[14:49] and and one of those things i believe
[14:51] that's revealed in the seals is what the
[14:53] devil is doing and how to combat that
[14:56] so if you go back to uh if you go into
[14:59] the book of james chapter 1 verse 14 to
[15:01] 15 it starts
[15:02] james kind of lays out the path of how
[15:05] the
[15:06] the the workings of the devil proceed
[15:08] from just like a little small little
[15:10] thing
[15:10] and it and it unfolds into a greater and
[15:13] greater thing
[15:14] and because james in first in chapter
[15:16] one he says but every man is tempted
[15:19] when he is drawn away of his own lust
[15:21] and enticed
[15:23] then when lust hath conceived it
[15:25] bringeth forth sin
[15:26] and sin when it is finished bringeth
[15:29] forth death
[15:30] so it starts off with just a little
[15:31] temptation it seems like a little
[15:33] innocuous just a little temptation a man
[15:35] turns his head
[15:36] looks at a woman or all these different
[15:38] stories maybe that you can relate in
[15:39] your own life a man wants to go
[15:41] witness to a woman at work and he goes
[15:43] and sits down with her at a cafe and
[15:45] they have a little cup of coffee and
[15:46] before long they're
[15:47] they're committing adultery and then one
[15:49] thing leads to another and all of a
[15:50] sudden
[15:51] death is at the door and you see that's
[15:53] how i i i believe that
[15:56] that is the thing that's being revealed
[15:58] in the seals is what the devil
[15:59] is doing as as he starts off with just a
[16:01] little saying and works on his way to a
[16:03] doctrine that kills you and on and on
[16:05] until death is at the door but you see
[16:07] god has given something to combat that
[16:09] and that's why those are called the
[16:10] combat
[16:11] combat beasts he's given you his word to
[16:14] combat the
[16:15] the workings of the devil the work the
[16:18] word
[16:18] the word is the thing that will combat
[16:21] the devil
[16:22] in your life as you go through those
[16:23] different phases of your of your
[16:25] spiritual journey the word is the thing
[16:28] that will bring an
[16:28] end to the to the to the devil in the
[16:31] first seal the devil and the second seal
[16:32] the word is the thing
[16:34] that will bring an end to those things
[16:36] that is the thing that will drive it out
[16:38] so you see you must stay with the word
[16:42] or you'll be living in darkness if you
[16:44] don't stay with the word for your age
[16:46] you'll be living in darkness
[16:48] you know brother brown taught us there
[16:50] was four stages that
[16:51] that through the the the bride tree was
[16:53] restored through luther and wesley and
[16:55] pentecost and through the word
[16:57] now think about that now if you're
[16:59] living if you've if you've come out from
[17:01] denomination and all those kind of
[17:02] things you're still
[17:03] kind of living under the light of a
[17:05] pentecostal age or living under a light
[17:06] of a previous age
[17:08] are you really living in the light of
[17:10] the word
[17:12] if you're not living in in the word for
[17:14] your day then you're still
[17:16] living in gross darkness and i believe
[17:18] that's one of the things that brother
[17:19] brown was really hitting at when he
[17:20] preached this the god of this evil age
[17:22] is
[17:23] if you're not living under the light of
[17:25] the word for your day then you are
[17:27] you are worshiping unknowingly you
[17:29] worship you begin to worship the god
[17:32] of that evil age without even realizing
[17:34] it and you see the devil has got people
[17:36] so duped
[17:36] that they're worshiping him without even
[17:39] realizing what they're doing they sit in
[17:41] church and they think they're right and
[17:42] they think they're
[17:43] they're doing correct and everything but
[17:45] yet they're doing they're worshiping the
[17:47] wrong thing
[17:50] so you see going back to james chapter
[17:53] one
[17:53] every man is tempted when he is drawn
[17:55] away of his own lust and enticed then
[17:56] when lust hath conceived it bringeth
[17:58] forth sin and sin when it is finished
[18:00] bringeth forth death so the last thing
[18:02] is death
[18:03] and i believe if you're going to go back
[18:04] and look at the seals
[18:06] that's why the last horse rider his name
[18:09] that sat on him was death
[18:10] so you finish up with the four horse
[18:12] riders and his name is death
[18:14] what is supposed to conquer death the
[18:16] word in you
[18:17] is supposed to conquer death in this age
[18:20] you have the privilege of being
[18:22] one of the five this is that's what is
[18:24] the last this is brother brown said this
[18:25] is the age above all the other ages that
[18:27] i would want to live in
[18:29] this is the age where god has poured out
[18:31] all of his word
[18:32] to give you the ability if you will
[18:34] yield yourself to the word
[18:35] to conquer to overcome death to overcome
[18:38] that last horse rider
[18:42] and first corinthians chapter 15 verse
[18:44] 25 to 26 it says for he must reign
[18:47] till he hath put all enemies under his
[18:49] feet and the last enemy that shall be
[18:51] destroyed
[18:52] is death you know it's so interesting
[18:55] how
[18:56] when you really begin to study these
[18:57] little messages and really get just
[19:00] almost
[19:00] analyze them line by eye line to see
[19:02] what comes out
[19:03] brother branham says some very
[19:05] interesting things
[19:07] and one of the things i noticed as i was
[19:09] studying this message the god of this
[19:10] evil age is brother
[19:12] he nailed down how a seed man a seed
[19:15] something small
[19:16] a seed planted manifests itself later as
[19:19] as as a mature thing and let's look at
[19:21] how he breaks this down he says
[19:23] as a seed starts in the ground it comes
[19:25] up through carriers the life of it but
[19:27] it ends up the same seed
[19:29] that it was when it went in the ground
[19:31] and the same way the seed
[19:33] listen to these three things that he
[19:34] lays out the same way the seed of deceit
[19:37] fell in the ground in eden is the same
[19:39] way it ends up in the last days
[19:42] the seed of deceit the deceitfulness
[19:45] thinking you're right when you're wrong
[19:48] it's
[19:49] now it's not just a seed though now it's
[19:51] a mature
[19:52] thing that's cloak in the eyes of the
[19:55] people so that they can't see the truth
[19:58] just as the gospel was when it fell to a
[20:00] denomination at nicea rome
[20:03] it ends up in a super organization now
[20:06] see back then and i see rome it was just
[20:08] a seed a little small little thing
[20:11] but now it's a mature thing that's
[20:13] coming forth now
[20:14] the devil is that satan is trying to
[20:17] wind
[20:17] round up all of his body all of his
[20:20] bride as brother brown explains in this
[20:23] message
[20:23] into a one world order a one world
[20:26] system of
[20:27] uh uh uniting church and state and all
[20:29] those kind of things
[20:30] you see it's going from something a
[20:32] little small a little seed
[20:34] to something that's mature just as the
[20:37] seed of the church
[20:38] fell back there with the signs wonders
[20:40] and the living christ among them
[20:42] it ends up in the last days under the
[20:44] ministry of malachi 4
[20:46] and restores back again the original
[20:48] faith that was once given
[20:50] so there's a seed that was planted on
[20:52] the day of pentecost
[20:54] and in this day it's going to be a
[20:56] mature
[20:57] adult bride a bride that knows what
[21:00] she's doing here
[21:01] and what she's standing for a bride that
[21:03] realizes
[21:04] that she's here in this evil age to
[21:07] prove to the devil that she is not going
[21:09] to fall
[21:10] like eve did
[21:13] you know that is what you are doing here
[21:17] that is what you were predestinated to
[21:19] do to be an example to be a light to the
[21:22] world that
[21:23] to be a light to all of satan's minions
[21:26] all of his kingdom that you are not
[21:29] going to fall
[21:30] that you are going to take all of the
[21:31] word and stand on it
[21:34] now now let's just kind of think for a
[21:36] little bit now
[21:37] if something look real small begins to
[21:41] move into over through process of time
[21:43] into something big
[21:45] from a little baby form to an adult form
[21:49] when's the best time to deal with it you
[21:51] want to nip like brother wade was saying
[21:53] you want to nip it in the bud you want
[21:55] to tackle it early you don't want to
[21:56] wait till it's wait till it's got a
[21:58] crown on his head and it's enthroned and
[22:00] it's sitting up there
[22:01] in the temple of god making it making
[22:04] itself be god
[22:05] you see you don't wait to deal with sin
[22:08] you you deal with sin early on you don't
[22:11] wait
[22:11] to take him at his word take him at his
[22:13] word early as early as you can
[22:15] as soon as you feel the lord dealing
[22:17] with you hear the lord dealing with you
[22:19] through
[22:19] the preaching of the gospel quickly run
[22:21] to the altar
[22:22] run to to take care of the thing
[22:26] and you don't wait to preach that sermon
[22:28] until death is taken over
[22:30] you see we don't wait you you preach
[22:32] that sermon as soon as you
[22:34] see evil the devil moving in a
[22:36] congregation or moving
[22:37] moving in a situation you go ahead and
[22:39] preach that thing as quick as you can
[22:42] because you know if you wait and hope
[22:44] that it'll handle itself
[22:46] the only situations won't handle
[22:48] themselves
[22:50] the only thing that can handle the
[22:52] situation is the word
[22:54] the word is the handler of the devil
[22:57] that might not even be good english but
[22:59] the point the point against the cross
[23:03] you see all all these situations now now
[23:06] brother brother branham when he was when
[23:07] he was preaching this sermon the god of
[23:08] this evil age
[23:10] he began to it started off almost like
[23:12] uh
[23:13] he's he's coming in real nice and
[23:15] everything but then he
[23:16] ramps up and he begins to lay into all
[23:19] of the things that people are doing
[23:20] wrong all the
[23:22] all the all the blindfolds that the
[23:25] devil pulls over your eyes where you
[23:26] begin to think
[23:27] that you're doing right
[23:34] you know and that's another thing that
[23:37] i've really been meditating on
[23:40] is that today of all of all this age of
[23:43] all ages
[23:43] you go on facebook and everybody thinks
[23:45] they're right everybody has
[23:48] all the information all the information
[23:50] that they've got you look at cnn and
[23:51] they think they're right
[23:53] you go on instagram or any of these
[23:55] other social media platforms and
[23:56] everybody thinks they're right any
[23:57] church you go to everybody thinks
[23:59] they're right
[24:00] everybody thinks they're right you so
[24:02] you see you've got all of these voices
[24:04] that you hear of politics and and and
[24:06] the sin in the world and your
[24:07] imagination of your own mind and
[24:09] all these differences of opinion but
[24:12] there's got to be
[24:12] something that's right everyone believes
[24:15] they're right because this is the most
[24:17] evil
[24:18] deceptive age where satan satan
[24:21] has blinded the people to think that
[24:23] they are right
[24:24] now you know that's what eve's eve's
[24:26] problem was was she was deceived but she
[24:28] thought
[24:28] she was right right and there's even a
[24:30] quote where brother ryan said even to
[24:31] this day she still still thinks she's
[24:33] right
[24:33] [Laughter]
[24:36] her her deception was i know i'm right
[24:40] and that's what many people when they go
[24:42] to church they say i y
[24:44] you know they they the devil pulls the
[24:45] blinder over their eyes and they begin
[24:47] to think well
[24:48] i know i'm right to not go to church i
[24:51] know
[24:51] i'm right to dress the way i want to i
[24:53] don't have to dress a certain way i know
[24:55] i'm right i know i'm right to be able to
[24:56] do
[24:57] things contrary to scripture now i'm i'm
[24:59] listening out some things here but just
[25:01] use maybe examine your own self as i'm
[25:03] preaching this
[25:05] because anything contrary to the word
[25:08] anything off of the word will bring
[25:10] death
[25:11] and that's what brother branham was
[25:13] getting at when he when he preached the
[25:14] seals and all these kind of things you
[25:16] get off the word and it will
[25:18] kill you it leads to death
[25:21] i know i'm right to deny what the
[25:22] preacher says
[25:24] i know i'm right that's the worst
[25:26] deception to sit
[25:27] in a church or a congregation or
[25:28] whatever and and believe
[25:31] that you're right despite what the word
[25:33] says
[25:35] amen brother brahms said in in
[25:38] paragraph 97 he said of this message he
[25:41] said notice he preached it in eden to
[25:43] who to adam's bride and she fell for it
[25:45] he deceived her into questioning one of
[25:47] god's words let's see what he might have
[25:49] said he might
[25:49] he must have said it is not scientific
[25:52] to die in this holy church or you will
[25:53] be schooled and educated not to believe
[25:55] in such
[25:56] unreasonable things as death i don't
[25:58] care if god's word
[25:59] did say it it's unreasonable oh look at
[26:03] him today god is a good god
[26:05] you're in his holy church why you cannot
[26:07] die but god
[26:08] said you would and that settles it see
[26:10] him today oh just belong to church it
[26:12] ain't what you do or this that or the
[26:14] other just come to church
[26:16] and be a good member cutting your hair
[26:18] that's nonsense and wearing shorts
[26:21] and putting on paint and going to dances
[26:23] and a little beer once in a while won't
[26:25] hurt you
[26:25] as long as you don't indulge in it
[26:29] my goodness frankly
[26:32] i wish you children would take it so
[26:34] that they could learn whether they liked
[26:36] it or not
[26:37] there he is the god of this age
[26:40] this evil age you see how
[26:43] how he can blind your eyes to think that
[26:46] just whatever you want to do
[26:49] is according to the word of god when it
[26:51] is not
[26:52] this deception is to think that you're
[26:54] doing right when you're not
[26:56] you you can think that as as long as as
[26:59] long as you don't
[27:00] indulge in it it's all right to drink a
[27:02] little beer and all that kind of stuff
[27:03] and now i'm not
[27:04] i'm not i'm trying not to preach a
[27:05] legalistic sermon but you see it goes
[27:08] beyond just closed hair and dress it
[27:09] goes into all facets of the word of god
[27:12] as the deeper you goes
[27:13] the more the devil will attack you on
[27:15] things and and get you to just sit there
[27:17] and say well i know i'm right and when
[27:18] you say i know i'm right
[27:20] and it's contrary to the word of god you
[27:21] can't move forward
[27:23] you can't keep moving on because the
[27:26] bible says in
[27:27] deuteronomy 8 3 he said he humbled thee
[27:29] and suffered thee to hunger and
[27:31] fed thee with man in which thou knewest
[27:33] not neither did thy fathers know that he
[27:35] might make thee know that
[27:37] man doth not live by bread only but by
[27:40] every word that proceedeth out of the
[27:42] mouth of the lord doth man
[27:43] live back there in in the old testament
[27:46] was it written and jesus
[27:48] would quote that a lot and brother
[27:49] branham and all the
[27:51] all of the preachers after you know
[27:53] every we live by
[27:54] every word that proceedeth out of the
[27:56] mouth of god
[27:58] now this is really the only age where
[28:00] every word has just been
[28:02] so unveiled that we can know the name of
[28:04] god we can know how to be baptized we
[28:06] can know how to
[28:06] the all of the mystery part of being
[28:09] born again the mysterious part of
[28:11] justification the mysterious part of
[28:12] sanctification the mysterious part of
[28:14] the
[28:14] holy ghost all of those different kind
[28:16] of things what the true
[28:18] baptism in the holy ghost is what the
[28:19] baptism holy ghost does
[28:22] what the what the true token is that
[28:25] obedient full obedience to the word of
[28:26] god entitles you to the token
[28:28] and so the full word of god is opened up
[28:31] so that you can live
[28:33] by every word that proceedeth out of the
[28:35] mouth of god
[28:36] and if you turn away from that every
[28:38] word every word that we have access to
[28:41] then you're blind and that will produce
[28:42] death
[28:47] it's the word that will defeat the devil
[28:51] you see when when people turn away from
[28:54] the word listen to what brother brown
[28:55] said in paragraph 74
[28:57] he said notice how beautiful the
[28:58] scriptures tie themselves together in
[29:00] every age
[29:01] when the church world not have the word
[29:03] of god to rule over them
[29:05] they accepted a murderer barabbas what
[29:08] did this do
[29:09] it exalted satan the god of this evil
[29:11] age to the place that he's always wanted
[29:14] now listen for satan is not spoken of as
[29:16] a god of any other age but this age
[29:19] he wasn't spoke of the god of the age of
[29:21] noah he wasn't spoke of the god of age
[29:23] of the age of moses the god of the age
[29:25] of elijah
[29:26] but this evil age oh don't miss it he is
[29:30] the god of this evil aged worshiped by
[29:32] millions and billions of people and they
[29:34] don't know it
[29:35] but let's let the scripture uncover him
[29:37] this morning
[29:38] and let's see then you'll know
[29:43] then you'll know when you when the
[29:44] scripture uncovers the devil and his
[29:46] works
[29:47] then you'll know and you'll know how to
[29:49] how to recognize him and how to defeat
[29:51] him
[29:51] every time through the experience now
[29:54] listen
[29:55] this is one of the scriptures that
[29:56] brother brown read when he was preaching
[29:57] this message matthew 24
[29:59] 24 for there shall arise false christs
[30:02] and false prophets and shall show
[30:04] great signs and wonders in so much that
[30:06] if it were possible they
[30:08] shall deceive the very elect
[30:11] so this is the age where false christs
[30:13] anointed ones that are anointed
[30:15] but not don't have the word the
[30:16] revelation of the gospel in their soul
[30:18] but yet their anointed on their spirit
[30:20] will rise up
[30:21] and they do signs and wonders now notice
[30:23] how brother branham would explain how to
[30:25] tell
[30:25] you tell by the false teaching by the
[30:28] teaching right
[30:29] now that's that's very plain
[30:32] uh maybe more plain than it should be
[30:35] but
[30:36] people can be anointed in their spirit
[30:39] and
[30:40] and not yet not have the true baptism of
[30:42] the holy ghost down in their soul now
[30:44] now notice
[30:45] brother branham as far as i know there's
[30:47] no place where he said
[30:49] that when someone is anointed or someone
[30:51] jumps up and runs through the building
[30:52] or something like that that there might
[30:53] be a problem with that
[30:55] he never said if someone is anointed
[30:58] that the anoint the absence or presence
[30:59] of the anointing is a problem
[31:01] the absence of presence of the revealed
[31:03] word is the problem
[31:05] i just want to draw your attention to
[31:06] that and really point that out
[31:08] maybe this is a hill that i'm willing to
[31:10] die on is that
[31:12] there's nothing wrong with being
[31:13] anointed and i think sometimes we get in
[31:15] our minds that that if you're anointed
[31:17] there's something wrong
[31:19] there's nothing wrong with feeling the
[31:20] presence of the lord or feeling a
[31:22] blessing or
[31:23] or riding in your car and you get so
[31:25] stimulated by the revelation
[31:27] that you begin to raise your hands up
[31:29] and begin to shout a little bit
[31:31] now i think sometimes that uh you know
[31:33] we get to the place that we
[31:35] we major so much on the revelation of
[31:37] the word that we begin to think of that
[31:39] it's wrong
[31:40] to have any kind of moving in the spirit
[31:43] and and uh y'all just bear with me that
[31:46] but i just
[31:47] i just want to really hit that a little
[31:48] bit there's nothing wrong with an
[31:51] anointing in fact the false anointed
[31:53] ones
[31:54] are both have the anointing the real
[31:57] genuine
[31:58] are also anointing anointed but what the
[32:01] anointing does
[32:02] is it quickens the word that they've
[32:04] held down in their heart and it makes it
[32:06] come alive
[32:07] but the false anointings anointed ones
[32:09] are they're not
[32:10] false because they are anointed but
[32:13] because there's no
[32:14] word to quicken so there's nothing wrong
[32:17] with being anointed now
[32:20] it's not a it's not a badge of honor to
[32:22] say well i've never felt the anointing
[32:25] in my life what kind of badge of honor
[32:27] is that to say that you're so
[32:29] you're so in the word that never from
[32:31] your birth until your adulthood and on
[32:33] beyond that that you've never
[32:35] felt imagi i believe that that the new
[32:38] birth gives us the ability to
[32:40] recognize the presence of god recognize
[32:43] when you're playing a song that he likes
[32:47] recognize when you're reading the
[32:49] scripture and he
[32:50] he identifies you in that scripture and
[32:53] himself in that scripture
[32:55] we we should be able to recognize when
[32:58] god is pleased or dissatisfied with
[33:00] something
[33:03] you know you know you begin to look at
[33:05] uh
[33:06] and i really i had in my notes here to
[33:08] talk about blasphemy
[33:10] because you know when you see the spirit
[33:11] of the lord moving in a situation and
[33:13] you begin to speak out against that
[33:16] that's getting into scary territory
[33:18] that's getting into a place where you
[33:21] know you brother branham warned us
[33:23] against stuff like that
[33:24] blasphemy is to make fun of or ridicule
[33:28] or call the works of the holy spirit the
[33:30] works of the devil
[33:32] so when you see the works of the holy
[33:34] spirit moving in a congregation and
[33:36] doing something and you
[33:38] say something like well i i wonder if
[33:41] like somebody told uh i think it was
[33:44] brother branham
[33:44] told this story that somebody was saying
[33:46] i wonder if john on the isle of patmos
[33:48] had too much spaghetti the night before
[33:49] he fell asleep
[33:50] and had a wild dream well
[33:55] to say something comparable to that
[33:58] after the spirit of god moving in an
[34:00] assembly
[34:00] to speak out against the holy spirit
[34:02] moving that's getting close to
[34:04] blasphemy and i say that because a
[34:07] minister is supposed to warn people
[34:09] like brother louise was preaching about
[34:11] a watchman a watchman is supposed to
[34:13] stand up and say
[34:14] attention attention don't do that you're
[34:17] on dangerous ground
[34:18] and when you begin to not have enough
[34:20] spiritual discernment to speak out
[34:22] against the moving of the spirit
[34:24] that is dangerous ground that you may
[34:26] not be able to recover from
[34:31] brother brown said and jesus christ the
[34:33] same yesterday today and forever he said
[34:35] know what a danger lies there
[34:38] let me back up a second he said what did
[34:40] jesus said he said all manner of sin and
[34:42] blasphemy shall be forgiven the man that
[34:44] blasphemed the son of man but
[34:46] whosoever shall blaspheme the holy ghost
[34:48] is never forgiven in this world of the
[34:50] world to come
[34:51] and the bible said he said this because
[34:54] they said he has an unclean spirit
[34:56] know what a danger lies there be careful
[35:00] so let's walk humbly see we don't play
[35:02] church no more
[35:04] them days are over we're living in
[35:06] church now he said if you speak a word
[35:09] against the holy ghost
[35:10] it'll never be forgiven you now jesus
[35:13] had not yet been glorified so the blood
[35:15] cell wasn't broke but he was blaspheming
[35:18] jesus
[35:18] and said what is the blasphemy of the
[35:20] holy ghost now is to call the work of
[35:23] god the devil
[35:24] so be careful that's never forgiven
[35:27] nowhere at all
[35:28] never can be forgiven anyone who would
[35:30] declare the works of god to be the devil
[35:32] jesus said that it's never forgiven
[35:35] so be careful how you class god's work
[35:38] fanaticism
[35:39] or mental telepathy or the working of
[35:41] the spiritualists
[35:43] or something like that better be careful
[35:45] but that was their attitude
[35:47] so and i would echo that today to look
[35:50] upon god's work
[35:51] you know we need the baptism of the holy
[35:53] ghost
[35:54] we need the working of the spirit in our
[35:56] lives and we know that what
[35:58] uh activates the spirit or however you
[36:01] would say that is the word that when you
[36:03] hear the word and believe it
[36:04] it allows the spirit to come in and move
[36:06] upon your life to quicken the word and
[36:08] bring it to
[36:09] bring it to pass but many times that
[36:12] process will result in something happen
[36:15] and somebody will shout or somebody will
[36:16] jump or whatever
[36:18] and there is nothing wrong with that in
[36:20] fact we should be
[36:21] desirous to see that i want to see that
[36:23] in my life and many times you know that
[36:25] won't
[36:26] happen because we're so prideful and our
[36:28] hearts are not in the right place to
[36:30] allow the spirit to move we get
[36:31] ourselves so built up in our pride
[36:33] to where if the lord really was moving
[36:35] in our heart we would say well i'm not
[36:37] coming to the altar
[36:38] i'm not going to raise my hands and i
[36:40] can't even clap my hand do you know
[36:42] the reason why you don't clap your hands
[36:44] is because of pride
[36:46] the reason why you can't lift your hands
[36:48] when the spirit is moving is because of
[36:50] pride
[36:50] and the thing that will dash that pride
[36:52] to pieces is the word of god if you can
[36:55] open up your heart and say
[36:56] i'm ready to die to myself if it kills
[36:59] me if it
[37:00] if i have to lay down in front of
[37:01] everybody and act like a fool i'm ready
[37:03] to do it
[37:04] and give my life to god and watch your
[37:06] pride be dashed into pieces
[37:12] now let me get back on my scripture
[37:16] i believe sometimes you got to hit
[37:18] things a little bit hard and i believe
[37:20] i'm sorry
[37:20] i shouldn't apologize i shouldn't
[37:22] apologize for preaching the word but
[37:24] some things some things need to be
[37:26] saying
[37:28] last week in matthew 24 brother brown
[37:30] said it was the most deceiving of all
[37:32] ages
[37:32] all the ages of deceit from the garden
[37:35] of eden all the way down there's never
[37:37] been an age so deceptive as this
[37:39] age false prophets will rise and show
[37:42] signs and wonders if possible to deceive
[37:44] the very elected see
[37:46] now just the cold formal starchy
[37:48] churches and so forth of man-made
[37:50] theology
[37:51] that wouldn't in other words he said
[37:53] that's not going to deceive anybody
[37:55] and it's not going to deceive anybody to
[37:57] have a cold starchy
[37:59] formal church but what will deceive
[38:01] people
[38:02] is to have a church with the spirit
[38:04] moving what i was saying earlier with
[38:06] the anointed ones
[38:08] where the false doctrine is being
[38:10] preached people not understanding how to
[38:12] get born again but yet the spirit is
[38:14] moving people are shouting
[38:16] like like paul said bodily exercise
[38:18] profit of little
[38:19] and what he was speaking of was not
[38:21] going to the gym but he was speaking
[38:23] about
[38:23] jumping up and down that's wonderful but
[38:26] let the word of god be received down in
[38:28] your heart now it sounds like i'm on the
[38:30] other side of the fence doesn't it
[38:32] but you see there's a balance to all
[38:34] things
[38:35] [Laughter]
[38:38] the deception is that it's close the
[38:41] deception
[38:42] is that it's it looks like the real
[38:45] thing
[38:46] it's up there almost like the real thing
[38:48] just leaving out
[38:49] one word is all you have to do promise
[38:52] of the age very great time christians
[38:54] everywhere take
[38:55] heed to the hour we're living in you see
[38:57] this
[38:58] age is the most deceptive of all ages
[39:01] because the devil can make
[39:02] the counterfeit look like the real thing
[39:06] and that's why we need the preaching of
[39:08] the gospel the deep teaching of the word
[39:10] the opening of the seals the seven
[39:12] thunder mysteries which
[39:13] people discount and say we don't need
[39:15] because that is the thing that will give
[39:17] you
[39:18] power to combat the devil that is that
[39:21] is what those combat beasts typify the
[39:23] combat beasts
[39:24] that lion the ox the man and the eagle
[39:27] represent
[39:28] are symbolic of the holy ghost in you
[39:30] the holy ghost in you that combats the
[39:33] satan
[39:34] working in your life brother brown said
[39:37] we find now this evil age is to prove
[39:40] to satan that she is not like eve that
[39:43] she is not that type of a woman
[39:45] and she will be tried by his word the
[39:48] bride as
[39:49] abraham as adam's bride was tried
[39:52] by the word do you know as i was reading
[39:55] through the seals that brother dale
[39:56] preached years ago that's one of the
[39:58] things that he
[39:59] he called out as a as the second seal
[40:02] was open
[40:02] the second seal was a rider on a horse
[40:04] on a horse with a sword
[40:06] and by his false twisted doctrine he
[40:08] brought death to people
[40:10] then what will combat that what would
[40:12] come back that was the sword of the word
[40:14] that sword that fell into brother
[40:15] brethren's hands on the mountain
[40:17] the sword of the word will will combat
[40:19] the false doctrine that satan
[40:21] is sowing satan is bringing death
[40:24] through his false word and god is
[40:26] bringing life
[40:27] through his word that's changing you
[40:29] that's molding you
[40:30] after you get the new birth as you grow
[40:32] up the statue of a perfect man
[40:34] it's molding you and bringing you into
[40:36] his image
[40:38] and this evil age is to prove that you
[40:40] have heard the word and you will not
[40:42] fall because you have become the word
[40:46] see now now is not the time for for
[40:48] fearful hearts and
[40:50] and knocking knees over world events now
[40:53] is the time for confidence in the word
[40:55] that we have heard
[40:56] now is not the time for secret questions
[40:58] in the parking lot about the work the
[41:00] new birth really is and
[41:02] how do i get the new birth and how do i
[41:04] know it and all these things are
[41:06] last-minute explanations about what the
[41:07] message is about
[41:09] now is not the time to get somebody to
[41:11] come over to your house and explain to
[41:12] you all these things
[41:13] that you should have been studying out
[41:15] all these years as the doors are closing
[41:17] in this final hour
[41:18] why did you wait until now now is not
[41:21] the time for last-minute explanations
[41:24] you know think about noah when one
[41:25] morning he looked up he woke up in his
[41:27] bed and he realized
[41:29] that the door was shut and he had
[41:30] nothing to do with the shutting of the
[41:32] door
[41:32] it was god that sealed them in and
[41:34] sealed them out and now
[41:36] all that was left was to preach to the
[41:38] souls that were imprisoned
[41:40] to preach to the lost that had rejected
[41:42] the message
[41:44] oh that's that's just coming fresh
[41:47] i i don't want to believe that the doors
[41:49] are closed
[41:50] but but when the word is rejected when
[41:53] the word is rejected it's getting close
[41:55] it's getting close now
[41:57] [Music]
[42:00] but see as i was looking at studying on
[42:02] the second seal is that
[42:03] the seals if the word is what will
[42:06] change you
[42:07] then one of the things revealed under
[42:09] the second seal is that you also
[42:11] have to stand a test by the word you
[42:13] have to be tested to prove that you will
[42:15] stand according to the word
[42:17] that you will not fall to some sensation
[42:19] or something
[42:20] that you're not relying on having a
[42:22] feeling you're not relying on feeling
[42:24] and anointing all the time
[42:25] well if the spirit of the lord leaves
[42:27] you that you're not trusting in that
[42:28] but you're trusting solely in his word
[42:31] that's the only thing that you could
[42:32] have confidence in
[42:34] not emotions not wonderful church
[42:36] services not
[42:37] all of those things not that somebody
[42:39] not that your best friend believes what
[42:41] you
[42:41] do not that your pastor even believes
[42:43] what you do
[42:44] but that you have heard from that stills
[42:46] fault small voice that elijah heard when
[42:48] he was in that cave
[42:50] you've heard from that same voice that
[42:52] you've seen the same pillar of fire that
[42:54] moses did
[42:55] and you know for yourself whom you
[42:57] believed
[42:58] and you will not fall to anything
[43:00] because you've heard the word
[43:02] that's why the bible says let no man
[43:04] deceive you by any means in second
[43:06] thessalonians
[43:08] chapter 2 let no man deceive you by any
[43:11] means for that day shall not come except
[43:13] there cometh falling away first
[43:15] and that man of sin be revealed the son
[43:17] of perdition
[43:19] except they're coming falling away first
[43:22] now as brother dale often says
[43:24] you've got to have something to fall
[43:25] away from you got to have something to
[43:28] follow
[43:28] and people are not falling away because
[43:30] from a new birth
[43:32] you if you're born again you cannot fall
[43:35] away from the word because the word will
[43:37] keep you
[43:38] you've got the comforter in there but
[43:40] what they're falling away from
[43:42] is the true word of this day being
[43:44] preached
[43:45] we have heard the skies have been opened
[43:47] us the windows of heaven
[43:49] and all the word has been given to us
[43:51] and they're falling away from that
[43:52] because they believed the lie
[43:54] and been given over to that
[43:57] and let's keep reading this who opposeth
[43:59] and exalt us himself above all that is
[44:01] called god
[44:02] that is worship so that he is god
[44:05] sitteth in the temple of god
[44:07] showing himself that he is god and what
[44:09] did brother brown say that
[44:11] that is god what is what is the temple
[44:13] of god what is the tabernacle of god
[44:15] it's supposed to be
[44:16] the new testament tabernacle of god is
[44:19] supposed to be his church
[44:21] it's his bride where he tabernacles
[44:23] himself in you
[44:24] and when the devil comes in and poses
[44:27] and sets himself up in the temple of god
[44:30] he's setting himself up in the church
[44:32] deceiving the people deceiving the
[44:34] people that are supposed to know the
[44:35] truth
[44:36] and he's showing themselves that he is
[44:38] god
[44:39] deceiving the people to worshiping the
[44:42] god of this civil age and to the god
[44:44] that they think that they're worshiping
[44:45] because they've been deceived they've
[44:47] been deceived by
[44:48] not not obeying the word of truth
[44:51] they've turned their back to the truth
[44:53] turn their back to the message of this
[44:55] day
[44:57] and i believe one reason why they've
[44:59] turned their back to the message book
[45:00] is because people have not preached the
[45:02] message people have not told the people
[45:04] what to believe
[45:05] they've not preached it in a way that it
[45:07] should be preached
[45:08] and so it's been made of none of faith
[45:10] that's been watered down so much until
[45:12] it doesn't have any effect anymore
[45:14] the gospel hasn't been preached in just
[45:16] a form where you just kind of you come
[45:18] to church and you join something
[45:20] but there's so much more even than being
[45:22] born again if people would preach it
[45:25] god help me until my dying breath until
[45:27] i'm taking off this world
[45:29] to preach the gospel with everything
[45:30] that's in me and not hold back to preach
[45:32] the truth
[45:33] because the truth is what will set us
[45:35] free
[45:36] you all forgive me for hardly getting
[45:38] the words out
[45:43] let's keep reading what he said remember
[45:44] you not that when i was yet with you i
[45:46] told you these things
[45:48] and know you and now you know what
[45:50] withholdeth
[45:52] that he might be revealed in his time
[45:55] for the mystery of iniquity doth already
[45:57] work and
[45:58] only he who now letteth will let until
[46:01] he be taken out of the way
[46:02] and then shall that wicked be revealed
[46:06] whom the lord shall consume with the
[46:08] spirit of his mouth
[46:09] and shall destroy with the brightness of
[46:11] his coming
[46:12] even him who's coming is after the
[46:15] working of satan with all powers and
[46:17] signs and lying wonders
[46:19] and with all deceivableness of
[46:21] unrighteousness in them that perish
[46:23] because why why the reason
[46:27] is right here they received not the love
[46:30] of the truth
[46:31] that they might be saved and for this
[46:33] cause god
[46:34] shall send them strong delusion that
[46:37] they should believe a lie
[46:38] that they all might be damned who
[46:40] believe not the truth
[46:42] but add pleasure in an unrighteousness
[46:45] now let's just let's just bring this
[46:47] home it seems like we can kind of make
[46:49] this
[46:49] especially those of you at home and that
[46:51] are not sitting here in the sanctuary
[46:52] and make it seem like it's talking about
[46:54] just somebody else way out there that we
[46:56] don't have to worry about
[46:58] it's very easy to be judgmental of other
[47:00] people and point fingers at
[47:02] what a group that group over there or
[47:04] people that you know or whatever
[47:06] but let's bring it home tonight and
[47:08] bring it down to our situation
[47:11] have you opened your heart to the
[47:13] message of the day
[47:15] have you opened your heart and spent
[47:16] your time in the message of the day or
[47:18] have you been deceived
[47:19] into thinking that the things that
[47:21] you're doing the way that you're acting
[47:23] that's contrary to the word is the right
[47:25] way and that you know
[47:26] in your heart you've been deceived into
[47:28] thinking that you're right
[47:30] so that you say despite the preaching of
[47:32] the gospel but despite all the things
[47:34] that are said over the pulpit you say
[47:36] in your heart i know that i'm right
[47:38] nobody can tell me that i'm wrong
[47:40] i know that i'm right i can pull my
[47:42] dress up i can cut my hair
[47:44] i can put a tattoo on my face i can
[47:46] paint my lips i can paint my eyes
[47:49] i can do all these things knowing that
[47:50] you're not living according to the
[47:52] scripture
[47:53] and and yet you're deceived i wonder if
[47:55] you could examine your heart tonight and
[47:57] if if you're living in that condition
[48:00] now would be the time to change
[48:02] course and repent and change direction
[48:04] and turn around
[48:05] and come back and go the other way
[48:09] brother brown said see adam's bride
[48:12] believed every bit of the word
[48:13] all but confused on one promise
[48:17] that he's the same yesterday today and
[48:20] forever today see but failed on one
[48:22] promise
[48:24] under the temptation of the enemy face
[48:27] to face
[48:29] but she believed she was right you see
[48:32] that's the deception she believed she
[48:34] was right that you can sit in a church
[48:36] and hear the gospel preached and say i
[48:38] believe that i'm right
[48:40] i know that i'm right
[48:43] do you see why this day this age is the
[48:46] most deceiving of all
[48:48] ages because it will be so close
[48:51] till it would deceive the very elect if
[48:53] it was possible
[48:54] because people will sit in a church next
[48:57] to the elect
[48:58] in the same building with the elect
[49:00] fellowship with the elect
[49:02] and believe that they also are elect
[49:04] when they're deceived
[49:06] be not deceived the bible says that all
[49:09] nations
[49:10] in revelation chapter 18 he says babylon
[49:12] the greatest fallen has fallen and has
[49:14] become the habitation of devils
[49:16] and the whole of every foul spirit and a
[49:19] cage of
[49:19] every unclean and hateful bird for all
[49:22] nations have drunk of the wine of the
[49:24] wrath of her fornication
[49:26] and the kings of the earth have
[49:27] committed fornication with her
[49:29] and the merchants of the earth are waxed
[49:30] rich through the abundance of her
[49:32] delicacies
[49:33] and i heard another voice from heaven
[49:34] saying come out of her my people
[49:36] in other words everybody everybody
[49:39] except the bride has fallen to her
[49:41] deceit has fallen to her deception
[49:44] everybody that except for the real true
[49:47] born-again believer that has grown into
[49:49] maturity
[49:49] that has come to the full stature that
[49:51] has received the word for her day
[49:53] everybody has fallen to that deception
[49:56] because
[49:57] everybody if you don't have the word to
[49:59] combat that
[50:00] if you don't have the combat beast
[50:03] inside of you to combat the deception of
[50:05] the devil
[50:06] you will take the mark of the beast and
[50:12] that's why the bible says that
[50:14] in this day this layout of seeing age it
[50:16] says that
[50:17] because thou sayest i am rich should
[50:19] increase with goods and have need of
[50:20] nothing and know us not that thou art
[50:22] wretched and miserable
[50:24] and but know not they're wretched and
[50:25] poor and miserable and they yet they
[50:27] don't know it because the wool has been
[50:29] pulled over their eyes
[50:31] and blind and naked i counsel thee to
[50:33] buy me gold tried in the fire
[50:35] that thou mayest be rich in white
[50:37] raiment that thou mayest be clothed
[50:40] at that the shame of thy naked nakedness
[50:42] do not appear
[50:44] do you realize why brother branham so
[50:46] awful when it hit on women for not
[50:48] dressing right
[50:49] and hit on men also for not dressing
[50:51] right for not being clothed right
[50:54] because his job as the seventh angel
[50:56] messenger
[50:57] was to clothe the bride of christ to
[51:00] prepare her to adorn her in white
[51:02] raymond
[51:03] so she so that she could be presented
[51:05] spotless
[51:06] without any spot or wrinkle to the
[51:08] bridegroom
[51:10] it was his job to to hit and rebuke and
[51:13] all these things
[51:14] and i say if ministers don't don't
[51:17] continue to
[51:18] hit on that they're not preaching the
[51:20] gospel
[51:23] let me catch my breath here
[51:28] you know what preaching on clothesline
[51:31] exposes the sin-sickness of your soul
[51:35] if your outward adornment is not correct
[51:38] then it shows that on the inside there's
[51:40] something
[51:40] that's wrong something down on the
[51:43] inside if your hair is cut
[51:45] it shows that you're not ahead you're
[51:47] not in headship to authority
[51:49] if you're not dressing right it shows
[51:50] that your soul is not clothed
[51:53] by the word it shows that your eyes have
[51:56] not been opened to your predicament
[51:58] so we preach that and it's scalding and
[52:00] hurtful and everything
[52:01] to clothe yourself with a righteousness
[52:03] so that your outside can be clothed
[52:06] so that your it opens your eyes to your
[52:08] current state
[52:11] i tell you nobody in this message should
[52:13] have a right or an excuse
[52:15] to be clothed improperly to come to to
[52:18] come to the house of the lord and sit in
[52:20] fellowship with other people
[52:21] with their dress above their knees so
[52:23] that it shows their undergarments when
[52:25] you sit wrong
[52:26] you know when you bend over and
[52:28] everybody can see all of your wares and
[52:30] all those kind of things there's no
[52:31] excuse for that
[52:33] because the word of god should have your
[52:34] soul clothed you should be clothed in
[52:37] your right mind if you're
[52:38] if you're not clothed by the word of god
[52:40] you're not even in your right mind and
[52:42] that's why that maniac of goddard
[52:44] took his clothes off because he was not
[52:46] in his right mind
[52:47] i want brother brown said a woman that
[52:49] takes her clothes off clothes off is not
[52:51] in her right mind and he said
[52:53] she's in this message that i'm preaching
[52:54] from the god of this evil age he said
[52:57] she's got a prostitute spirit on her
[52:59] why prostitute spirit because she's
[53:01] wanting men to lust after her
[53:03] you see if you're if if you're not if
[53:07] your soul is not
[53:08] clothed it shows that you're you're
[53:11] it will manifest itself on the outside
[53:15] isaiah chapter 61 verse 10 it says i
[53:18] will greatly rejoice in the lord my soul
[53:20] shall be joyful in my god
[53:22] for he hath clothed me with the garments
[53:24] of salvation
[53:25] he hath covered me with a robe of
[53:27] righteousness as a bridegroom decath
[53:30] himself with ornaments and as a bride
[53:32] adorneth herself with jewels
[53:34] so certainly certainly i'm not preaching
[53:36] legalism tonight i'm not preaching by
[53:38] any sense
[53:39] that if you dress right or your hair is
[53:41] the right length that you are saved
[53:43] but it shows if you're not clothed on
[53:45] the outside that something's wrong on
[53:46] the inside
[53:48] and i believe that shall be preached and
[53:50] if it's not preached and ministers are
[53:52] dropping the bar
[53:53] they're letting down the bar on the
[53:54] gospel and you can see it in the way
[53:56] that people are living
[53:57] you can see it in the the the horrible
[54:00] nasty lives of the people that are
[54:02] living
[54:02] that they they've dropped the bar in
[54:04] their own lives
[54:07] because you see the word is what will
[54:08] keep you the word is what will clothe
[54:11] you
[54:11] the word is the only thing that come
[54:13] back can combat satan
[54:15] in the lives of the people in the lives
[54:17] of of this deceptive age
[54:20] i hope that's all right
[54:24] but in another sense i don't really care
[54:32] first timothy chapter four he says for
[54:34] therefore we both love
[54:35] labor and suffer reproach because we
[54:38] trust in the living god who is the
[54:39] savior of all men
[54:41] especially of those that believe in
[54:43] matthew chapter first 16 24
[54:45] says if any man will come after me let
[54:47] him deny himself
[54:48] and take up his cross and follow me
[54:51] follow
[54:52] me to suffer the reproach for the gospel
[54:54] gospel to suffer their approach
[54:55] and you realize sisters out there
[54:58] listening in we don't we have one sister
[55:00] here sitting here tonight
[55:01] but sisters when you clothe yourself
[55:03] right you cannot help but suffer
[55:06] reproach
[55:07] because people will mock you and scorn
[55:09] you any person any individual that's
[55:11] living right for the for the gospel
[55:13] will suffer approach a minister that's
[55:15] preaching the true word of god will
[55:17] suffer approach
[55:18] and we were talking privately the other
[55:20] day me and luisa about that that the
[55:22] true
[55:22] that's maybe one of the complexities of
[55:24] being a minister
[55:26] is when you preach the truth when you i
[55:28] really believe that
[55:29] the best sermons are the ones when
[55:31] people when you suffer the most reproach
[55:34] because it'll stir up enmity it'll stir
[55:36] up straight or stir up the devil
[55:38] and when the dead i want to stir up the
[55:40] devil i want somebody to say i i
[55:43] have a reaction i want somebody to
[55:45] either come to the altar and repent
[55:47] or realize they're doing they're living
[55:49] wrong i want something to be stirred up
[55:51] when something is stirred up then you
[55:53] can do something about it
[55:55] when we all when we preach sermons
[55:56] whether we just stroke one another on
[55:58] the back and say
[55:59] just say it's all wonderful and
[56:00] everything then i wonder if
[56:02] how much profit it really does and you
[56:05] can take that for what it's worth but
[56:08] that's that's free
[56:11] brother brown said it has god lost
[56:13] control or is he just permitting another
[56:14] agency to control
[56:16] i wonder the true answer to this
[56:18] question is to my opinion there is two
[56:20] opposing spirits in the world today at
[56:21] work
[56:22] there can't be no more than two two
[56:24] heads and one of them is the holy spirit
[56:26] at work the other one is the spirit of
[56:28] the devil
[56:29] and in this last days in deception now
[56:32] i'm going to base my thoughts right on
[56:33] here for the rest of the text
[56:35] the rest of our message the two spirits
[56:39] one of them god's holy spirit the other
[56:42] one
[56:43] the devil's holy spirit working in
[56:45] deception
[56:46] the people of the earth are now making
[56:48] their choice the holy spirit is here
[56:50] calling out a bride for christ
[56:52] he is doing it by vindicating his word
[56:54] of promise to her for this age showing
[56:56] that it is christ
[56:59] in other words if the finger is moved
[57:01] it's supposed to move in this age the
[57:02] finger will move the foot is supposed to
[57:04] move the foot will move
[57:05] the eyes to see in this age the eye will
[57:07] see see the spirit of god is growed into
[57:10] the full stature of god
[57:12] as the age that we're living in the holy
[57:14] spirit is here vindicating the message
[57:16] of the hour
[57:17] and the holy spirit is doing this so
[57:19] that the people that believe
[57:21] god will be called out of this chaos
[57:24] the devil's unholy spirit is here
[57:26] calling his church
[57:27] by the error as usual by perversion of
[57:30] the word of god
[57:31] like he did at the beginning now
[57:34] now let me just highlight something here
[57:36] brother branham as he's preaching this
[57:38] message
[57:38] he's calling your attention to the fact
[57:40] that there are two
[57:41] spirits and there are two bodies there
[57:45] are two
[57:45] brides and they are both being gathered
[57:48] up together in this day
[57:51] god is gathering up his people by the
[57:53] revealing of his word as he's drawing
[57:55] them together
[57:56] and the devil is gathering up his people
[57:58] together by the perversion
[58:00] by the lie by the deceitfulness he's got
[58:02] drawing them together
[58:04] and the whole process started in similar
[58:07] ways started from a seed like i was
[58:09] saying earlier started from a little
[58:10] thing that seemed insignificant
[58:12] and grew grow and grew grow
[58:15] grew into a mature form in both
[58:19] in both instances and now is everybody
[58:22] doing okay
[58:23] you all right if i get a little bit more
[58:24] deep here everybody doing good
[58:28] i know how when once we go past eight
[58:29] o'clock then
[58:31] kind of the sleepy eyes come on but
[58:34] let's see brother brown explained that
[58:36] satan exalts himself
[58:38] from a child to sitting in the temple
[58:42] from a little childish thing to sitting
[58:45] in the temple to enthroning himself as
[58:48] god of this evil age
[58:50] over the people's hearts to to to to
[58:53] placing himself as as god
[58:56] and he quotes this scripture ephesians
[58:58] chapter two verses one to two and it
[59:00] says and you hath thee quickened who
[59:01] were dead in trespasses and sins wherein
[59:04] in time past you walked according to the
[59:05] course of this world
[59:07] according to the prince of the power of
[59:08] the air the spirit that now worketh
[59:11] in the children of disobedience and the
[59:14] children of disobedience
[59:15] and if you go run that through the
[59:16] scripture brother brown talks about how
[59:18] it starts off as
[59:20] a little childish thing in other words
[59:22] if you look at the
[59:23] how the first seal opened up as just a
[59:25] saying and it moved from a saying
[59:27] into a doctrine now now there's a
[59:29] comparison to your scriptural journey as
[59:31] well because
[59:32] your scripture your journey as a
[59:34] christian start off with
[59:35] you're hearing about baptism and you're
[59:37] hearing about all these things and
[59:39] and and it it was maybe just like
[59:41] sayings and everything it started off as
[59:43] as you're hearing about the third pool
[59:45] you didn't understand what it was you
[59:47] heard about the third pool and the
[59:48] capstone and adoption and all these kind
[59:50] of things
[59:51] but then moving on to the second stage
[59:54] it began to take a form of a doctrine
[59:56] and it began to
[59:57] solidify into something where god is
[59:59] actually forming himself coming down and
[1:00:02] making himself
[1:00:02] manifest in you through the statue of a
[1:00:05] perfect man he's purging you of those
[1:00:07] of all the lies of the devil he's
[1:00:10] molding you into his image
[1:00:12] and you see you can see brother brown as
[1:00:15] he preaches this message he's
[1:00:17] comparing the devil moving down through
[1:00:19] the seven church
[1:00:20] not seven church ages but moving down
[1:00:22] through until he's in his mature form
[1:00:25] comparing that with on the other side
[1:00:28] and brother branham
[1:00:29] he starts talking about he says for as
[1:00:30] the germ of natural life is brought down
[1:00:33] dramatized from father to father so was
[1:00:36] the life of christ dramatized
[1:00:38] that's the reason god uses elijah spirit
[1:00:41] five different times
[1:00:42] what is it it's the handing down he's
[1:00:44] handing down his spirit from one to the
[1:00:46] other as it's preached a church aged
[1:00:48] messenger and he's preached
[1:00:49] until it comes down to the final age
[1:00:51] that's been handed down and handed down
[1:00:54] from one to the other in its mature form
[1:00:58] listen to this he said children of
[1:01:01] disobedience
[1:01:02] and if the antichrist beginning there in
[1:01:05] the infancy of disobedience
[1:01:07] what will it be when it heads up in the
[1:01:10] person of the antichrist
[1:01:12] how deceptive it'll be how much more
[1:01:16] powerful deception could an adult give
[1:01:18] to the world
[1:01:19] than an infant's child and he said the
[1:01:22] spirit of delusion now working in the
[1:01:25] children of disobedient disobedient
[1:01:27] to the word now i want to dwell on this
[1:01:30] in just a minute the children
[1:01:32] of disobedient a child now you see
[1:01:35] he goes on to describe how in this day
[1:01:37] it winds up just how it was when the son
[1:01:39] of man was made manifested
[1:01:42] on earth in jesus christ they rejected
[1:01:44] the word in favor of barabbas
[1:01:46] and it brought their death and now in
[1:01:49] this day
[1:01:50] they've rejected the word they rejected
[1:01:52] the real word and it's
[1:01:53] elevated he said it exalted satan the
[1:01:57] god of this evil age
[1:01:59] to the place that he's always wanted why
[1:02:01] because they rejected the truth in this
[1:02:04] age
[1:02:07] in 2 thessalonians chapter 2 it says
[1:02:09] even him whose coming is after the
[1:02:11] working of satan with all power
[1:02:13] and signs and lying wonders and with all
[1:02:16] deceivableness
[1:02:17] of unrighteousness in them that perish
[1:02:19] because they receive not the love of the
[1:02:21] truth that they might be saved
[1:02:23] and brother braham goes on to say he
[1:02:24] said satan never come out and say oh
[1:02:26] well that's not even the word of god
[1:02:29] he admitted it was the word of god but
[1:02:31] he put his
[1:02:32] own interpretation to it which god
[1:02:35] plainly told them not to do it
[1:02:37] what does this do it makes a strong
[1:02:39] delusion for the people to believe a lie
[1:02:42] and be damned by it now now we were some
[1:02:45] of us were talking about this earlier
[1:02:47] it's gotten it's so close in this day
[1:02:49] that you can take
[1:02:50] snippets of what brother branham said
[1:02:52] and
[1:02:53] real snippets from the bible and string
[1:02:56] them together
[1:02:57] with the wrong spirit behind them and it
[1:02:59] will be absolutely wrong you can take
[1:03:01] scriptures from the bible or quotes from
[1:03:03] the message and make it look like you're
[1:03:05] not supposed to be going to church
[1:03:07] you can make it look like that we're not
[1:03:10] supposed to be listening to the fivefold
[1:03:12] ministry
[1:03:12] you can make it look like all sorts of
[1:03:14] different things
[1:03:16] and that's where the deception is it
[1:03:18] looks like something
[1:03:19] but without a true true revelation of
[1:03:21] jesus christ
[1:03:22] you will fall to that delusion
[1:03:28] let me let me just kind of skip over
[1:03:30] some of these things
[1:03:32] it goes he says the devil believes not
[1:03:34] make believes but he actually believes
[1:03:36] that's not he is not saved
[1:03:38] talking about how you can say well i
[1:03:39] believe but do you have a revelation do
[1:03:42] you have the correct revelation but
[1:03:44] brother brown
[1:03:45] he goes on to talk about how how that
[1:03:48] deception
[1:03:49] is made manifest in people's lives now
[1:03:52] he's hitting
[1:03:52] it sounds like he's being legalistic
[1:03:55] because he's saying
[1:03:57] satan made it lawful satan's made it
[1:04:00] lawful
[1:04:01] to commit sin and because people are
[1:04:03] deceived they think they're right
[1:04:05] and sinning so you see now and the way
[1:04:08] he describes it he says people have
[1:04:10] legalized drinking
[1:04:11] they've legalized smoking i'm talking
[1:04:14] about in the church now
[1:04:15] they've legalized a woman with short
[1:04:17] hair legalized
[1:04:19] shorts and pants and all those things
[1:04:21] and and just form your own list in your
[1:04:23] mind legalized everything that's
[1:04:25] contrary to the word of god
[1:04:27] but that's why we need traffic cops we
[1:04:30] need the minister to come on the scene
[1:04:32] and declare
[1:04:32] like john the baptist did it's not
[1:04:34] lawful it's not
[1:04:35] lawful for you to be married to your
[1:04:37] brother's wife it's not
[1:04:39] lawful for you to do those things it's
[1:04:41] not lawful for you to paint your face
[1:04:43] it's not lawful like jesus coming around
[1:04:46] the corner i believe as he did one day
[1:04:47] and he went into the
[1:04:48] into his father's house and he saw them
[1:04:50] making a dent of thieves
[1:04:52] and he said it's not lawful i i believe
[1:04:55] that's how
[1:04:55] ministers are supposed to do is they
[1:04:58] maybe they come around the corner and
[1:05:00] all of a sudden they realize the
[1:05:01] predicament that people are in
[1:05:03] and it catches them just like jesus did
[1:05:05] when he turned the corner
[1:05:06] and saw them selling people in the
[1:05:08] father's house and he began to take up
[1:05:10] those
[1:05:10] that braved those ropes and began to
[1:05:12] whip the people
[1:05:14] why because of the thing because of
[1:05:16] their sin
[1:05:17] we need traffic cops to declare when
[1:05:20] we're breaking the law it's not lawful
[1:05:22] for you to do that it's not lawful for
[1:05:24] you to
[1:05:25] to behave yourself in a way that's
[1:05:28] contrary to the scripture
[1:05:30] it's not lawful for you to rob the house
[1:05:32] of god like malaka in malachi chapter 3
[1:05:35] it's not lawful for you to rob
[1:05:37] god and not pay your tithes do you
[1:05:40] realize when you don't pay your tithes
[1:05:42] that you're
[1:05:42] robbing god and if you were in the
[1:05:44] natural that you would be arrested
[1:05:49] that's why we need the preaching of the
[1:05:50] gospel to hold our feet to the fire
[1:05:52] if you don't pay your tithes that you're
[1:05:54] robbing god you have no excuse to not
[1:05:57] pay your tithe
[1:05:58] despite the predicament that you're in
[1:06:00] your first obligation is to pay your
[1:06:01] tithes
[1:06:03] not because we want a lot of money but
[1:06:05] because god said it amen
[1:06:09] and you can get in your head that it's
[1:06:11] that we don't have to go to church i've
[1:06:13] seen
[1:06:13] i've seen so many traffic cops on
[1:06:15] facebook getting
[1:06:16] all irate because of what they see their
[1:06:19] congregations in this particular time
[1:06:21] getting so laxed and liking staying home
[1:06:24] and
[1:06:25] sitting around with her pajamas and
[1:06:26] their feet up and everything and they
[1:06:28] cease to have true worship and they're
[1:06:30] not really entering into worship anymore
[1:06:33] and the traffic cops are some of them
[1:06:35] are i was kind of laughing to myself but
[1:06:37] one brother i saw he's like we're
[1:06:39] we're done everybody's coming back to
[1:06:41] church i'm tired of everybody sitting at
[1:06:43] home with their with their pajamas up in
[1:06:44] their feet up people are getting lazy
[1:06:46] and lacks and everything and we're not
[1:06:48] having this anymore
[1:06:49] now i'm not saying i'm not proposing any
[1:06:51] particular change in plan or anything
[1:06:53] i'm just saying that traffic cops are
[1:06:55] here to set us straight to keita to hold
[1:06:57] our feet to the fire
[1:06:58] and to prevent us from getting slack and
[1:07:01] lacks and and
[1:07:02] and and and you know letting the world
[1:07:04] create encroaching
[1:07:07] you see well that was white walking a
[1:07:12] tightrope
[1:07:14] uh again i'm not i'm not anyway
[1:07:18] you see satan is satan tells he's
[1:07:21] he's he's trying to deceive this second
[1:07:24] bride by telling her
[1:07:26] all these things that she's doing is
[1:07:27] fine to do he'll tell her there's no
[1:07:29] such thing
[1:07:30] and i wrote down all these things that
[1:07:31] brother brown said there's no such
[1:07:33] things
[1:07:34] as divine healing never been a case
[1:07:36] proved brother braham said that is one
[1:07:38] of the things that what the devil will
[1:07:40] will say to put deceit on you that cloak
[1:07:42] of deceit
[1:07:43] to close your eyes to the truth he'll
[1:07:45] say there's no such thing as the baptism
[1:07:47] of the holy ghost that was only for the
[1:07:49] apostles
[1:07:50] or that divine healing was for another
[1:07:52] age in other words he's saying
[1:07:53] there's no such thing let's just stick
[1:07:56] that on the end of a lot of things that
[1:07:57] the devil could tell you about the bible
[1:08:00] there's no such thing as your healing
[1:08:02] god doesn't want to heal you there's no
[1:08:03] such thing
[1:08:04] as the baptism of the holy ghost for you
[1:08:06] it don't make any difference if you're
[1:08:08] baptized in the
[1:08:09] titles of father son and holy ghost it
[1:08:11] don't make any difference
[1:08:13] that's another lie that the devil will
[1:08:14] tell you it doesn't make any difference
[1:08:16] i just apply that to anything any kind
[1:08:18] of truth they don't make any difference
[1:08:19] whether we know the seals or not
[1:08:21] it don't make any difference whether we
[1:08:22] understand daniel's 70 weeks
[1:08:24] it don't make any difference whether we
[1:08:25] know who was this melchizedek it don't
[1:08:27] make any difference
[1:08:28] but it does make a difference it makes
[1:08:30] just as much a difference as it did how
[1:08:32] you were baptized
[1:08:33] it just makes just as much a difference
[1:08:35] as how you know who
[1:08:36] the name of jesus christ the name of god
[1:08:40] it don't make any difference if i trim
[1:08:41] my hair it don't make any difference if
[1:08:43] i marry an unbeliever
[1:08:45] and this is i thought this was striking
[1:08:47] how much brother branham hid on this
[1:08:49] in this sermon the god of this evil age
[1:08:51] that we think it don't make any
[1:08:53] difference
[1:08:54] and brother adam said they were never
[1:08:55] forgiven the sin
[1:08:57] of the sons of when the sons of god
[1:08:59] married the daughters of men they were
[1:09:00] never forgiven that they were never
[1:09:02] forgiven that
[1:09:03] when bola balaam came in with that lie
[1:09:05] and they married the daughters of men
[1:09:06] why because
[1:09:08] they thought it didn't make any
[1:09:09] difference and god never forgave them
[1:09:11] for that
[1:09:12] it does make a difference the word makes
[1:09:14] a difference
[1:09:17] brother brown said notice the sons of
[1:09:19] god saw the daughters of men not
[1:09:20] daughters of god the daughters of men
[1:09:22] that they were beautiful
[1:09:23] and they caused the sons of god to fall
[1:09:26] into this delusion
[1:09:27] and took them kind of women and married
[1:09:29] them and it brought a age of
[1:09:30] prostitution
[1:09:32] just like it is today like it was in
[1:09:34] sodom like it's predicted to be today
[1:09:36] why why did it matter when a son of god
[1:09:40] marries a daughter of men then poof his
[1:09:42] homes in disarray they can't they're not
[1:09:44] walking in one accord
[1:09:45] when he tries to lay out the true the
[1:09:47] true meaning of scripture to his family
[1:09:50] his wife will come in while he's at work
[1:09:51] and she'll begin to sow discord like
[1:09:53] brother adam said that i believe those
[1:09:55] women on the ark caused the serpent seed
[1:09:58] to be passed down on the ark and the way
[1:10:00] i believe that they did it is because
[1:10:02] as soon as noah or any one of those
[1:10:04] would say the truth
[1:10:05] they come right behind and say it don't
[1:10:07] matter it don't matter if you go
[1:10:09] smooching on a girl
[1:10:10] it don't matter if you go wearing your
[1:10:12] clothes like this it doesn't matter
[1:10:14] it doesn't matter but it does matter it
[1:10:18] matters who you marry
[1:10:19] young people
[1:10:23] i know that's treacherous to hit on that
[1:10:25] kind of thing and it bruises people a
[1:10:27] lot of times
[1:10:27] but yet it's the truth because it
[1:10:29] matters who you marry
[1:10:31] it matters it matters what decision you
[1:10:34] make
[1:10:35] because down the line down the line
[1:10:38] if you marry the wrong person it'll make
[1:10:41] your life a living hell
[1:10:44] just the same as balaam's teaching that
[1:10:46] he calls the pretty intellectual
[1:10:47] scientific women of moab to with their
[1:10:49] flirty eyes their paints and powders or
[1:10:52] fine perfumes
[1:10:53] to entice the sons of god against their
[1:10:55] own women that worked and had calluses
[1:10:57] in their hands
[1:10:58] with no makeup on and tash them over and
[1:11:00] let us marry one another because we're
[1:11:02] all the same people that see what the
[1:11:05] lie of the
[1:11:05] the deceitfulness of balaam was that
[1:11:08] we're all the same
[1:11:10] there's no difference we're just all the
[1:11:12] same but they weren't all the same
[1:11:14] and they weren't all the same because
[1:11:15] they had built their self up into
[1:11:16] conceit
[1:11:17] and pridefulness they weren't all the
[1:11:19] same because god's word said they
[1:11:21] weren't all the same
[1:11:22] god's word is what makes us different
[1:11:24] god's word is what makes us
[1:11:25] a separated people it's not that we're
[1:11:27] building ourselves up into some delusion
[1:11:30] or some pridefulness or whatever
[1:11:31] but his word has called us to be a
[1:11:33] separated apart people
[1:11:35] and if you'll abide by god's word he'll
[1:11:38] lead you to life everlasting and he'll
[1:11:39] make he'll give you a peaceful life
[1:11:42] he'll give you a life where you and your
[1:11:43] wife can work and walk in one accord
[1:11:46] i'm sorry if that bruises anybody but if
[1:11:48] you if you're to stick with god's word
[1:11:50] then he can patch things up and make
[1:11:52] make your life a lot easier
[1:11:55] stay with the word
[1:12:00] i know i'm stammering and stumbling and
[1:12:02] everything but
[1:12:04] the bible says through stammering lips
[1:12:06] know the tongues
[1:12:12] see brother brown and i i'll be closing
[1:12:14] up here in just a few minutes
[1:12:16] the bible brother ram said that the god
[1:12:18] of evil of this evil
[1:12:19] evil age gives people what they want
[1:12:23] and what they want because they've
[1:12:25] rejected the truth
[1:12:26] is a life of sin they want you can see
[1:12:29] as people leave the message they go
[1:12:30] right back into the hot tub sitting
[1:12:32] with bikinis and all kinds of things and
[1:12:34] what they want is bikinis and beer
[1:12:36] parties and nightclubs and dances and
[1:12:38] darkness
[1:12:39] no light events to keep them out of
[1:12:41] church oh my now we're getting into
[1:12:43] now we're getting into homes home
[1:12:44] territory maybe even when we talk about
[1:12:47] bikini we go to the beach and we think
[1:12:48] that we can dress a certain way because
[1:12:50] we're at the beach and we're out of
[1:12:51] out of the sight of all the believers
[1:12:53] but then
[1:12:54] you know facebook is a great revealer
[1:12:56] because it uncovers things that people
[1:12:58] do in secret
[1:12:59] i i've honestly been quite horrified at
[1:13:01] a lot of the things that i see show up
[1:13:03] on facebook
[1:13:04] that people think is is done in secret
[1:13:07] and all these kind of things
[1:13:08] you see what it is is the devil is
[1:13:10] covering over your mind
[1:13:11] the reason people do stuff like that is
[1:13:13] because they think they're right
[1:13:15] if you go to the beach and you've got a
[1:13:17] bathing suit on and you're uncovered for
[1:13:18] all the world to see
[1:13:20] you're doing that because you think
[1:13:21] you're right but you're not right
[1:13:23] and what exposes your error is the word
[1:13:25] of god and that's why that's why i
[1:13:27] believe the word
[1:13:28] has to be preached when a cutting way
[1:13:30] sometimes it cuts
[1:13:31] and it hurts feelings and things because
[1:13:33] it exposes where we're wrong and then we
[1:13:35] can shape up
[1:13:36] and see events to keep them out of
[1:13:38] church if there's something that you're
[1:13:40] doing on the side to keep you
[1:13:42] now again we're a lot of us now we're
[1:13:44] not in church and things we're at home
[1:13:46] and whatnot but just apply that to the
[1:13:48] study in the bible or
[1:13:49] putting god first because if there's
[1:13:51] anything in your life that you put
[1:13:53] first before god then that is your god
[1:13:55] that is your idol that is the thing you
[1:13:57] worship
[1:13:58] and that is why he's called the god of
[1:14:00] this evil age
[1:14:01] because he's usurped he's put himself in
[1:14:04] place over god and instead of worshiping
[1:14:06] god
[1:14:07] people are worshiping the devil why
[1:14:08] because they've got all the they'd
[1:14:10] rather go
[1:14:11] they'd rather watch a good marvel movie
[1:14:13] they'd rather watch a movie
[1:14:15] than go read their bible and they think
[1:14:17] they're right
[1:14:18] amen doesn't the scripture say that you
[1:14:21] if you have if you love the world or the
[1:14:23] things of this world the love of god's
[1:14:24] not even in you
[1:14:25] if you would rather go watch a good
[1:14:27] marvel movie instead of reading the book
[1:14:28] of revelation
[1:14:29] i wonder if the if the love of god is in
[1:14:31] you and now this is hitting hard
[1:14:33] and maybe maybe it's getting down to the
[1:14:36] wire a little bit but listen
[1:14:37] this is holding down time and we're not
[1:14:39] here just to play church
[1:14:41] but we're trying to get out of here
[1:14:42] we're trying to get rapturing faith
[1:14:45] and if rapturing faith comes by the
[1:14:47] opening of the seven seals by the seven
[1:14:49] thunders which is what brother ram said
[1:14:51] then shouldn't we be aiming have that as
[1:14:54] our goal to get into the
[1:14:56] into those deep things instead of all
[1:14:58] these things that warp our mind all
[1:14:59] these websites and things
[1:15:01] that people get caught up with and
[1:15:03] listen i know i'm hitting it sounds like
[1:15:05] i'm hitting legalism a lot and
[1:15:06] i've heard before people people will say
[1:15:08] well if a minister really hits on
[1:15:09] adultery or
[1:15:10] or pornography or all these kind of
[1:15:12] things that well that means that that
[1:15:13] minister's got a problem
[1:15:15] he's got a secret problem well that if
[1:15:17] that logic was true
[1:15:18] then a minister would never be able to
[1:15:20] preach the word they would never be able
[1:15:21] to preach the slicing gospel
[1:15:23] they will never be able to preach it so
[1:15:25] listen let's not get caught up in the
[1:15:27] deceitfulness of our minds the
[1:15:29] imagination of our minds that the devil
[1:15:30] will put on us
[1:15:31] but let's just stick straight with the
[1:15:33] truth of god's word
[1:15:40] see it uh brother brown i'm talking
[1:15:42] about how it don't
[1:15:43] people say it don't hurt my conscience
[1:15:44] they don't condemn me and they're living
[1:15:46] in rebellion so deceived
[1:15:48] the word separates you from the children
[1:15:50] of disobedience
[1:15:52] he said oh dear you should do this
[1:15:54] talking about what people will say
[1:15:56] oh dear i think you're old foggy
[1:15:58] preacher down there if you just oh you
[1:15:59] would look cute in a
[1:16:00] in a bikini or ever what you call the
[1:16:02] thing you if you do all this that and
[1:16:04] the other why
[1:16:05] a little cigarette won't hurt nobody i
[1:16:08] belong to church
[1:16:10] and you know our denomination has looked
[1:16:12] to looked up to as well as anybody's
[1:16:14] don't you believe that old painted up
[1:16:17] liar
[1:16:18] she is lying to you that's right
[1:16:22] yes sir and anybody
[1:16:25] whether it's not an old painted up liar
[1:16:27] but a preacher with a
[1:16:28] nice haircut anybody that would tell you
[1:16:31] anything contrary to the gospel don't
[1:16:33] listen to that
[1:16:34] because you will die if you disbelieve
[1:16:37] one word faith in the full word is what
[1:16:40] will overcome death
[1:16:42] faith in the full word is what will
[1:16:44] overcome that last horse rather named
[1:16:45] death
[1:16:46] faith and the full word is what will
[1:16:48] take us out of here
[1:16:49] [Music]
[1:16:52] i've got so many notes i'm i i was
[1:16:55] listening to brother brown i'm talking
[1:16:56] about i got
[1:16:56] six pages i'm gonna skip over and
[1:16:58] everything sometimes sometimes you do
[1:17:00] that
[1:17:01] i'm going to finish up right here and
[1:17:04] the musician can go ahead and come on
[1:17:06] he said in ephesians chapter 5 let no
[1:17:08] man deceive you with vain words
[1:17:10] for because of these things cometh the
[1:17:12] wrath of god upon the children of
[1:17:14] disobedience
[1:17:15] be not ye therefore partakers with them
[1:17:19] be not ye therefore partakers with them
[1:17:22] the only way to avoid the fate
[1:17:26] of the deceived is to get in the word
[1:17:28] amen
[1:17:29] the word is what will save us i
[1:17:32] i i got wrote down here that satan can
[1:17:34] try to take everything from us
[1:17:36] but he can't take the power of the word
[1:17:41] you know as time goes on that might be
[1:17:43] all all you've got left you
[1:17:44] maybe the church doors will be closed
[1:17:46] you might be home
[1:17:48] wondering where your next meal is going
[1:17:49] to come the devil can take all you take
[1:17:51] he can take your money away from you he
[1:17:53] can take your uh
[1:17:54] all these things away from you but he
[1:17:56] can't take the revelation of god's word
[1:18:00] amen are we happy in the lord tonight
[1:18:03] let's
[1:18:04] stand to our feet and just worship the
[1:18:05] lord a little bit amen
[1:18:12] these saints of life

[1:18:56] [Music]
[1:19:06] we're walking in that light send the
[1:19:10] gospel true to allah
[1:19:13] then david said his word is a light
[1:19:15] until my feet are lamp until my path

[1:20:34] light of that lamp
[1:20:35] that lights our way and you'll get to
[1:20:38] the destination
[1:20:40] but you know what i believe the light
[1:20:42] has shown so brightly that now we can
[1:20:44] see our destination
[1:20:46] we can see where we're going we're going
[1:20:48] to a capstone revelation

[1:20:51] we're coming into the revelation of a
[1:20:53] body change

[1:22:43] they had to hide they had to hide
[1:22:46] we don't have to hide they had to hide
[1:22:49] to meet
[1:22:50] and if they were caught meeting it
[1:22:52] wasn't just a slap on a risk or putting
[1:22:54] you in the pokey for a couple days
[1:22:56] no it was instant death but they met
[1:23:00] anyway
[1:23:01] they met anyway they didn't care they
[1:23:03] met so so
[1:23:04] we're gonna meet hey man and i'm just
[1:23:06] praying that we can all
[1:23:08] uh get this thing out of the way mom's
[1:23:10] feeling much better
[1:23:11] uh she just has a um
[1:23:14] maybe a rough time every once in a while
[1:23:16] now so where it used to be
[1:23:18] a lot of time but now it's just part of
[1:23:21] the time so keep praying for them
[1:23:22] they're going on august the 12th
[1:23:24] to have their tests done to see if
[1:23:26] everything's good and okay
[1:23:28] uh dad's doing fine he is just
[1:23:32] i don't think he's got i don't think
[1:23:33] he's got any antibodies in his body i
[1:23:35] think his whole blood system is just
[1:23:37] he's just full of the holy ghostly
[1:23:39] nothing's bothering him he's standing
[1:23:40] there right there in the middle of that
[1:23:42] standing right there in the middle of
[1:23:43] that cove and and nothing's bothering
[1:23:46] him so um
[1:23:48] you know i told you you know um god
[1:23:51] brought the attention
[1:23:52] of satan to job remember he said you got
[1:23:56] a hedge around him and then he said well
[1:23:57] if you lift up that hedge
[1:23:59] well see he got to all the things around
[1:24:01] him then the last thing he done he said
[1:24:03] well you got a hedge around his body he
[1:24:05] said well
[1:24:05] you can play with his body he said but
[1:24:06] you leave his life alone you see all
[1:24:08] these people in the message though
[1:24:10] brother howard carroll people like dad
[1:24:12] keeping away from it but homer longor
[1:24:14] all these and even even by louie's
[1:24:16] different ones mom going through this
[1:24:17] but we're going through it it's not
[1:24:20] killing us off
[1:24:21] it's like job he said okay let's see
[1:24:25] i want to see what your bride will do i
[1:24:27] want to see what your bride will do god
[1:24:30] says okay
[1:24:32] you grab a little flash every once in a
[1:24:33] while and tickle it a little bit put a
[1:24:35] virus in there he said but
[1:24:37] i say when their life ends
[1:24:42] i say when their life ends satan doesn't
[1:24:44] do that
[1:24:45] satan never says i'm gonna take that
[1:24:48] life
[1:24:48] not when you're a child of god that's
[1:24:50] what i was thinking today man we are so
[1:24:51] blessed to be the children of god
[1:24:54] to where he doesn't and that you say
[1:24:55] about god god don't care about nothing
[1:24:57] but his bride
[1:24:58] his bride is who he cares about right
[1:24:59] now because if we don't defeat the devil
[1:25:02] in our flesh
[1:25:03] then the whole program's done exactly
[1:25:06] done for
[1:25:06] so he's going to because we've already
[1:25:08] read the book
[1:25:10] we take a rapture we take a we take a
[1:25:12] body change so
