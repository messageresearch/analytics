back home safely we just commit ourselves into your hands now in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen praise the Lord Jesus amen so you just pray for me yeah because you know we always get I just don't no matter how much how much you you preach you still get that nervous butterflies in your stomach so you just remember me in Prairie man just say Lord Lord you speak to him exactly what I need amen praise God and tonight you know I want to speak something a little bit maybe maybe geared more to our young people and your children so children young people pay attention listen and hopefully you get something out of it amen but it's gonna supposed to benefit each and every one of us amen because the word is the word Amen I you know we're all supposed to be going to a great youth camp some day right that's what I tell I've told some of the older ones here before I said look you're not getting older you're just getting younger really they are they may not feel it right now in this outer shell but really a man they're rejuvenating amen and what rejuvenates us is this word amen praise God it's a hope that we have in this word amen praise the Lord Jesus so also just pray for those who like brother Wade said pray for those people there in the coast of South Carolina and those people that are traveling trying to get out you just remember the situation because there's churches in that area and things and so we have believers and brothers and sisters in Christ in those areas as well so remember them in prayer amen so right now let's just forget about Hurricane Florence forget about you thing else let's go to the word amen let's concentrate on the word that's so let's let's go to John chapter 6 and I want to start from verse twenty-seven John chapter six verse 27 amen I know I gave them in the back a different scripture but I'm gonna read three verses before that and then and then I'll get to the ones that I told him back there John chapter 6 verse 27 says labor not for the meat which perishes but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life amen which the Son of man shall give unto you for him hath God the Father sealed so in other words Jesus is saying here don't work so hard for food or for that those things in life they are going to perish anyways amen don't expect CA yourself with those things there are just gonna perish anyways don't consume yourself with those things that are just gonna perish anyways amen but labor for those things that endure with everlasting life amen praise God now let's skip down to verse 33 it says in the same chapter verse 33 for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world and we know that that's Jesus Christ amen verse 35 and jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger my what a promise and he that believeth on me shall never thirst it says never so that means I believe what he says Amen praise God now let's go down to verse 48 you can read this there hold this this whole chapter in your home and it's very good amen verse 48 says I am that Bread of Life so here's Jesus reiterating I am that Bread of Life verse 51 I am The Living bread which came down from heaven and If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world now let's go to verse 53 this is what I gave them back there then jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood you have no life in you what kind of kinetic code kind of cannibalism what is that word cannibalism is he talking about here you forgive me you know I'm not from America so I was English is not my first language I'm from way down south verse 54 whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life a man and I will raise him up at the last day so ya son of God has eternal life is gonna continue eating that flesh and drinking that blood amen for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him if you don't dwell on him you won't be doing this if he doesn't dwell on you you were not gonna be doing this to the world that sounds nasty to a believer it's rich amen verse 57 as as the living father hath sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me last verse this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your father's did eat manna and our dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever praise the Lord you may be seated this evening Amen Lord blood a blessing to his word we thank God amen because the Bible says that every word of God is is is a is for us to receive reproof to receive - to grow in him we need every part of the word so sometimes we like well why is that there maybe that's not important it's there for a reason they meant every part of it even to the point where Jesus said on a donkey Amen that went through Jerusalem one that I heard a brother just recently speak about that the predestinated donkey and there was a purpose for that donkey in it and it's in the Bible so it's there for a reason amen praise God so we're gonna look at this and it's here for a reason they men praise God so we I want to title this message tonight you are what you eat you are what you eat and I'm not gonna get into anybody's gastronomical the you know preferences that's not what I'm gonna talk about you know I'm not gonna talk about diets or anything like that but uh but what I am gonna speak about is that the physical the natural types of spiritual amen and Jesus here is telling us something amen about eating and drinking because you know we all need to eat right in life that's the way we grow ourselves need oh we have sales are our nails are made up of our fingers are made up of cells our hair is made up of cells our body every body part that you have is made up of cells and those cells are therefore for a particular for a specific time for time and so they need nourishment in order to give you back what you need you see so usually when you're eating right and when you're when you're feeding yourself with wholesome foods amen your your body's gonna show it on the outside and particularly start showing it on the skin that's the organ that it first starts showing it and so when you see somebody I don't know if you ever seen somebody with like I just have like this glowing skin and like their nails just just seems so perfect and their hair just so shiny it may be what they are putting inside their body amen because they're because when you feed your body the said the right things your cells are being fed the proper things they're gonna pay you back with with with good health and life and strength you see a mess so if it's like that in the natural I mean how much more in the spiritual Saints that if your are feeding on the junk food of the world if you're feeding on the junk music of the world if you are feeding on the on the on the things of the world that are not helping you to grow in this stature of a figman amen you're dying spiritually you're dying spiritually amen so you know we we uh when we get together with my family down in South Carolina when we get together we or when we usually get together here we usually gather around food right that's well that's what we gather we gather around there's there's always a potluck there's always some of you know food when we have fellowship dinners afterwards what do we have we have food downstairs food is something that unites us you see it we have a bonding with food you may not speak one person's language you know they may speak Chinese you speak English but when you're eating the plate of noodles or whatever Amen that's bonding you you see and you might not be able to talk to him but that food is bonding you why it's a form of communication and it's also a form of enjoyment for us you see food originally when we were created it was just for enjoyment it wasn't for us to live we didn't need to eat food for us to live but when sim came in the picture that's the reason why we need to eat in order for us to live amen but one day that's all going back amen we have that hope with a one that you don't have to eat in order for you to live amen if you got eternal life you got eternal life amen praise God so you don't have to eat a man yeah it'll just be all for enjoyment I heard somebody say one day one time that when they get together with their family their family is like this like a Snickers bar they're sweet on the outside with a bunch of nuts on the inside anybody like that oh there's people raising their hands so I guess they're you're funny yeah so they're you know our families they can be very sweet on the outside just like a Snickers bar but very nutty on the inside amen so that's maybe they might say that about me they might say that about my mind my brain maybe a little sweet on the outside maybe but nutty on the inside amen praise God but thank God for the nuts hey man praise God so let me read here the just a quick thing here about the purpose of eating eating also known as consuming is the ingestion of food typically to provide a heterotrophic organisms with energy and to allow for growth all right the phrase you are what you eat is literally true nutrients from the food you eat food provide the foundation of the structure function and integrity of every little cell in your body from your skin and hair to your muscles bones digestive and immune systems you may not feel it but you're constantly repairing healing and rebuilding your body so when you when you take that that McDonald's hamburger and you consume it you eat it or that chick-fil-a chicken sandwich with American cheese on it the way I like yeah this waffle fries right as soon as that hits your belly you don't feel like you know that you're full right for some of us some of us may need to two maybe two portions but you may not feel you may feel that you're full but you there's a lot of things that are going on inside that you have no idea that's going on that's trying to extract the nutrients a a man from that food praise God in order for that you can live tomorrow the day after or a couple of days after right and it's the same thing when we come to the house of God amen when you when you have brother wait up here preaching or a minister of preaching brother Dale's preaching anybody up here ministering the word amen and you're feeding you may not feel like nothing is going on you may not feel you may come out here and you may like I didn't feel anything right how do you only feel anything but let me tell you if you love the Lord and you went to that service with our heart attitude Lord I'm ready to receive what you haven't stored from me because what you cooked through a brother wait what you cooked up through brother Dale what you cooked up through any minister that comes here that's preaching the Word of God amen you're gonna leave out of here and that's gonna manifest sometime later on in the future amen you're gonna mean that you may not feel nothing right now but let me tell you it's gonna manifest again sometime if you continue with we're walking in the in his word amen praise God sometimes we may come to ho-hum services that's all right as though if the word is going forth Amen and you're in and usually you say Lord I'm eating whatever they give me even if it's crumbs and we'll talk about that in just a little bit if it's crumbs those crumbs have enough power to for me to receive anything that I have need of amen even if it's little crumbs and I may not understand everything that brother Dale brought out but if I just grab one little thing that one little thing can sustain me for the rest of the week now if you come with an attitude of like oh that's another church service I'm bored and I can't wait to go home so I can get on snapchat you're not gonna get anything out of the service you're dying spiritually all right so I I may say I may say some things that that may come down to our homes but that's alright we need it praise God amen so so what we put in our bodies physically reflects on the outside how much more it is on the spiritual you see now proverbs 23:7 tells us for as he thinketh in his heart so is he and we know Salomon today he's talking about demand for as a man thinketh in his heart so is he and and the Jesus said out of the abundance of the heart speaketh the mouth you see the heart your spirit man right your conscious reason and affection and then the other two that I always forget the way you say it all the time memory and reasoning and my wife knows that I needed help with that that spirit man there's they're the inlets Amen that you have amen your your your listening your eyes amen they they bring in that that information or that that stuff that you bring in amen and and if you're constantly pondering on those things if you're constantly pampering to those things amen then out of the abundance of the heart the mouth will speak you see you can you cannot you necessarily you don't you you you may not be able to tell what it is that a person is feeding on by by the way they look sometimes you can sometimes you can't because a person could look a certain way a sister could have long hair and and they could just wear the longest dresses and and just look like the holiest woman in the world but then they'd be feeding off junk food at home and they may not manifest on the outside but eventually that will manifest somehow and usually it will manifest by the way the person talks you look at you listen to a person speak you listen to a person talk and that usually manifests what it is that they're feeding off of you see so person may not necessarily shown it on the outside but then they're feeding off something else differently they're here at church they're listening to the word they go through the motions they might raise their hand they might they might agree with the word but then when they go home and leave these doors they men they're feeding off something else amen the Bible tells me that's hip oh that's a paper crib that's what the Bible says right that's a hypocrite and so we want to make sure that because out of the abundance of the heart speaks the mouth so whatever it is that your feet letting in through these inlets your ears your eyes whatever you're watching you're probably maybe you maybe you're just now they say you know with all these movie services that they have now called binge watching Netflix YouTube Hulu all these different movie services that you can sit all day long with your feet propped and watch movies all day long binge watching right feeding feeding your carnal man amen constantly and eventually out of the abundance of what you're feeding off that's gonna show off sure show out of you so at some point in town same thing with the music that you listen to a man if you're constantly listening to hip-hop and rap you constantly listen to rock and roll if you're listening to you know Shawn Mendes and and Shakira and Justin Timberlake and and and all these all these you know some of you are smiling cuz you know what I'm talking about [Laughter] if you're constantly feeding off these things you're gonna eventually show off show this off in some way or another is those things helping you grow in Christ is it helping you say you want to be in the stature of a perfect man but you can't be in the stature a perfect man if you're listening to Shawn Mendes if you're watching if you're watching r-rated movies and horror movies all the time you will never grow in the stature of a perfect man that way you see praise God a man so look what Jesus says here let's read here and if the brothers want to bring it up in Matthew chapter 15 Matthew chapter 15 verse 18 says but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and those are the things they defiled a man for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts how many have had an evil thoughts in the past I've had evil thoughts all right murders adulteries I hope nobody hears murdering anybody adulteries fornications thefts false witness blasphemies these are the things which the follow man you see these are the things and because you have let these things come in into your spirit amen as they're going forth there they're defiling you amen and not only that but you're also you may be the following somebody else to you see your testimony is very important praise God so and of course in Luke chapter 6 verse 45 Jesus says a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good that's why Jesus said that lay your treasures up in heaven do not let your treasures here on earth if you're laying treasures here on earth if you're laying if you're if you're if you're if you're totally so satisfied with this life here on earth something's wrong with you spiritual if you're not looking for the coming of the Lord if you're not desiring like John said in the in the Isle of Patmos so come Lord Jesus come quickly if that's not your desire you need to repent and you need to be born again amen I need to be born again if that's not my desire amen because that's that's what a true Christian that's what He desires he doesn't want to continue in his in his video gaming and his and his thing just Lord let me finish this game of a Grand Theft Auto before you come Lord I need to make sure to see really what the end of this game is you know before you come now Lord I want to make sure that I listen to all of Adele's albums you know before you come Lord I want to make sure that I did I something's wrong with you then Lord I want to make sure that I watch all the the series of such-and-such such a movie before you come something's wrong with you amen even if you want even as you young people you should be so in love with God and I know this is hard because I went through it but you should be so in love with the Lord Jesus Christ that you should say Lord even if I don't get married I still want you to come Lord even if I don't experience marriage and and being with with with a mate experiencing that you know I still prefer that you come Lord come Lord quickly because that's much better if you can say that truly from the from your heart a man there's something God's done something in your life amen God's now God's done something in your life amen because let me tell you Saints those things go and pass and come and go you see they come and go things things that that we do in this life that this world Hollywood provides to us and they're just here for a temporal a temple you know when I first come to the Lord I had my struggle as I've always told you one of my things I loved hip-hop and rap right and so I was I struggled through through my Christian life you know with that music I would be I could be at a restaurant eating and they have some sort of 90s of the station playing and all of a sudden some of that hip-hop music that I used to listen to or be a song that it that baseline starts with you know I'm like oh man I remember where I was where I first heard heard that I was with a girl in the car and you know it wasn't anything good she was playing it she had a big tent of 15-inch speakers in the back and and then it's and you get anointed and you're like what and I can't believe I still remember the words of that song that's how much effect music has in your mind and you don't realize it so if the world affects us so much like that how much more the things of God the music of God amen if you just let the music of God take ahold of you in that way amen and the only way you could curve that appetite or change that is you know change your appetite you see I had to completely just just the devil and he will flee sometimes we just have to do that resist him and he will flee with our flesh brother Brown said our flesh is gonna be sticky it's gonna be sticky until the day we die until it until we get that you know about a body change right it's gonna be sticky but God has given us a way to overcome amen and so if you're constantly feeding on the word if you're constantly desiring the things of God and being around the things that will help you to grow into that stature they meant the more of the world starts dying off the more of the world starts falling off more baggage starts coming off you see oh my I can't believe I don't even I don't even desire that anymore I can be around it and it's like doesn't bother me anymore I had a friend a friend in Anderson you know who he's a brother in the Lord and he said the Lord's changed him so much because he used to have an issue with with looking at women that he the Lord changed him so much that it's like when he's walking with his wife it's like the Lord put some light blinders on it on the Sun he has no clue that there's half-naked women walking right by him his wife would ask him did you see that woman that no hopefully he's not lying but I believe what he was saying that the Lord changed him that much I mean that's when the Lord Amen has really done a work in your life Amen that you can truly say Lord I have no desire for those things in my heart there are some things that there's some things there okay I'm not saying it's bad to play video games and I'm not saying it's bad to engaged in some things or watch a movie every now and that depends on what you're watching right it's not feeding your soul you're not growing in that statue right but but if that's what you desire over the Word of God over the things of God over church over over what over paint being with your brothers and sisters then that's that's a problem amen that's a problem that's a spiritual issue that God amen has to help you with amen praise God so sometimes we can be so desensitized they men cut with constantly playing video games and call of duty 2 K 18 fortnight oh look at that there's some of these older ones don't know what I'm thought but some of these younger ones know what I'm talking about [Laughter] Grand Theft Auto like I mentioned here all ago and I know some of us probably have those games in our house right now if you knew what happened in Grand Theft Auto some of the older ones knew what was you'd be like I can't believe it it's a terrible game it really is constantly listen to on godly music you know I mentioned Nicki Minaj Demi Lovato Bruno Mars somebody said I look like him a little bit is that true [Laughter] amen and you're constantly on snapchat Instagram Twitter or Facebook instead of your face being in this book amen that's what you feed off of posting posting pictures like that that out of the abundance of the heart speak at the mouth not just the mouth but your body actions and your and your actions show forth what you're really wrought you really feed off of amen so then trying to move on here amen I hope you're enjoying this amen praise God sometimes you know we treat God like a light like a convenient pop-tart you know look at this I got pop-tarts right here how many know what this is look at this strawberry has even got a little cartoon comic-book character or something on it it must be good it must be delicious and nutritious but sometimes you know we've stayed up all night playing Grand Theft Auto and and and listening to Bruno Mars trying to make sure I get the listen all the and this is how we treat God in the mornings oh wait a second I could put the second one in the toaster I have I have a minute I'll put these out there outside anybody could take them afterwards but sometimes this is how we treat got it like a pop-tart you know like in the mornings when you're supposed to make time for God before you actually start your day right make time for him because he won't bless you if you don't give him the time that he needs right if you make time for him you'll make sure that you'll need you did that feel that you need any men you don't have to wait all the way till Wednesday or Sunday a man you have that personal time with him and you don't have to treat God like a poptart sure this thing is gonna you know the sugar from it is gonna feed you for about an hour or hour and a half maybe but it's certainly not gonna gonna fuel you for for for up until lunchtime these things are meant to do some bad things to you just letting you know I don't know how they could say this is breakfast to me this is a snack I grew up with bacon and eggs and those types of things that's how I grew up with you know those are the things that nourish you it takes time in the morning to get up make some toast bacon and eggs and and things like that that takes time right but you feel so good after you eat that right and wash it down with a nice cup of coffee right but that right there even though you get it quick you know just like a drop through you know you think even though it says on the outside fresh right from the grill you think that's just as fresh as it is if he cooked it at your house I don't think so but that's just exactly how we treat God like we're going through a drive-through let me just grab something real quick and a quick little sermon a quick little five-minute prayer or a quick little devotional you know and then I'll just go move along the way I'll get back to my Grand Theft Auto can't wait Saints I'm challenging you I'm challenging you that because we're living in a late hour things are upon us that we are we are we're skint we're so comfortable with this life we're so comfortably I have to check myself too you know sometimes I get so carried away with with things like that that I realized wait a second what am I getting out of those things is drawing me away from the Word of God my desire for the word is is leaving because I'm excited with basketball or or whatever those things are okay but if you put that in the place of God you're not gonna get anywhere with God amen praise God so amen you got to take time to take time to pray and feed on the word every day every day it's very important that you take time young people listen to me those that you can read you can listen take advantage that you that you're not deaf dumb and blind God's gonna ask you one day if you had the opportunity you have all these resources cover magazines that are being sent from voice of God these messages these sermons are uploaded to YouTube and all these three sources even other others other things out there Bibles you have a phone you can have 30 Bibles on your phone now you have you and I have no excuse in this day God's gonna require those things from us God's gonna require those things from us amen I hope we don't we're not laying him down and treating him like a pop-tart amen praise God brother the brothers in the back if they could show picture number one hope they got the pictures all right we're gonna look at some foods here this right here is called escargot it's a French food and it snails stuffed with something I think I've had those I've had about you eaten those Christine I can't remember if I have or not but I would love to try them because I have a French brother-in-law and he just tells me they're great so I'm looking forward to him next picture this right here is called papa eatin this is this is a dish in the northern Philippines that's that I had the privilege of eating it's made of the intros of a goat or a cow and then inside the soup what they do because it's called bitter soup and what did they do is they take the bile the bile of the of that animal and squeeze it in the soup so you're eating a bitter soup and if you know what bowel is it helps digest your food and things like break down fats and stuff and it's usually bitter and so that's what this soup is made out of and it's a delicate let me tell you it's an acquired taste when I went to the Philippines the first time and I went brother royal Soriano took me to the north and he told me and they said the brothers are making papaya eaten it's very it's very tasty and and he can't explain to me what it was I'm like I'm the type of person that I'm willing to try something at least once so they served it to me and they make sure they put a lot of lemons right right there because and when I put put that first taste in my mouth I started squirting lemons inside that thing because that's the only thing that'll sort of take that bitter taste out of the soup at least some of some what I was done eating the soup and then they had bananas right there next to the table I made sure I started grinding needs and bananas trying to get that taste out of my mouth brother comes in and says brother do you like the soup it looks like you did you ate it all you want some more and it was hard for me to tell them no how do you want to let him down you know I want him to kept thinking that I did like it so he served me a second plate and I had to eat it you know I just felt bad you know we're so privileged here in America and then they they cook these things and that's how I felt about it so then the next day brother Soriano he had to preach or he had to be at a wedding preacher wedding and the brothers that I was that had cooked that food that dish I went to a hotel with him and they and then there was time to eat and they had they had put this soup inside plastic bags so guess what that's what we had to again I had three servings of that stuff so I know what that's like brotherbrother royale tells the story one time that he ate this soup one time at a certain region in the Philippines it was so fresh it was the entrance of a goat and the insides of a goat that when he was eating the soup there was little grass blades ins there the goat eats grass all right next real quick I'm gonna go quick now okay I'm gonna go quick now this here is Baloo by the way it he knows what it is this is another Filipino delicacy it's it's a I've had Baloo as well not not that not that duck fully firmed form that way but it's an embryo stage it tastes just like a boiled egg but this is this is food to them right this is this is food to them next they say it gives them a lot of protein and this right here is cooked rats they eat this and this is very delicacy in China and in Asia and other other other Asian countries then he said all right you get or Danny said in Waffle House - all right you can turn it off now for now you had to say something all right but here's the point here's the point you thought that those things were gross right brother Rick gave us a minute - a lot of people those things are food that's Street some of that is street food and it's good just like you know a Polish sausage is sold in the streets and then to you that's good right well let me ask you this what do you think God would think of what you feed off of if God was seeing what you feed off of in slides just like this would he be worried or would he be like yeah that's just like me what would he what would he say what would he say about what you feed off of good question right something to think about amen and sometimes we can take things amen because for example there's combinations that you can have for example you can have you can eat peanut butter and and butter and jelly it tastes good right you're gonna have beef stew in this I was thinking rice you know you've stewing rice alright what's the other bacon and eggs right those combinations are great right those are good combinations I like those things too right and and you know sometimes uh you know how many like - how many like tea this is gold peak tea all right peach flavor and I like tea right I love I like tea I like lemonade I like those things and I'm gonna give this brother weight afterwards he he said he might want it after all right I had permission from today to do this so I'm not out of order I hope not but I also like frappuccinos do you like frappuccinos I like frappe like coffee yes Starbucks I know I like frappuccinos right but I also like tea all right and I also like frappuccinos right so sometimes you know we're feeding off of the things of God as you say this is this seems a bit more natural you know sometimes we feed off the things of God and it's good oh I love reading the Bible but I also like listening to Bruno Mars oh I love going to youth camps but I also like going the club and watching going to the movie theater watching who knows what oh I love listening to gospel music but I also love listening to this type of music in my life you see that doesn't balance out right because that's to God you know that's like if you were doing something like this this is pretty nasty right I did it still tastes like tea that's disgusting now it looks disgusting right but this is what we do sometimes with our spiritual life this is exactly what we do with our spiritual life we feed off the world we listen to Christian rock Christian hip-hop Christian rap what's her Christian about it if the world was the one that invented it how can it be Christian eyes the other day I was I was actually looking at Christian either they have Christian nightclubs now and so I went to their Facebook page just to see what then they have some videos there and I clicked on one I couldn't tell the difference from a regular nightclub and so you see anything that just because it's called Christian doesn't mean it's good for you right just because it has the label Christian on it does not mean that it's healthy for you to continue to grow in the stature of a perfect man right and you cannot mix the world with God jesus said jesus said you cannot get sweet and bitter water from the same fountain you either get sweet water you get bitter water there is no such thing as a drunk sober man he's either drunk or you're sober right and there's no such thing as feeding on the things of God with all your heart and then when you get home feeding on the things of the world with all your heart you have to love one or the other you have to bend one for the other and we're living in a late hour and I hope that you're bending for the things of God Saints somebody's welcome to these afterwards praise God amen he's God I love my mom and dad but I love to talk back in this respect them at the same time do you do that I love people at church but I love to act like I'm better than them around them I come to them you know III say I say hey hey brother god bless you and I'm not even looked up at you no that's disrespect I was taught different as a young person you know you when an adult shakes your hand or it says hello you look at them in the eye and say hey hello god bless your heart hey man I love youth camps but I also love the movie theater and I also love these things you know and speaking of youth camp Saints you know III really I want I want to be able to have my children somewhere where they can grow in the Lord you see you know Minh so you consider a man because I've been I've been I've been places where we're kids were not neglected that didn't seem like it was an important thing in a children child's life and I could guarantee you the majority of those kids are serving the not serving the Lord because they wasn't important for the parent whatever is important for you as a parent your children picks up on that and realizes wait this is important this is not important this is this is this is priority in my life this is not priority my mommy and daddy are not engaged in this I guess I'm not gonna get and then you wonder why your kids are not serving the Lord you wonder why but at least I'm not gonna I'm not saying that a youth camp promises that your kid will get the Holy Ghost and and and and they will serve God forever that's not the case if it happens great it can happen I'd rather have them at a youth camp you know there's more higher percentage that they're gonna grow in the Lord at a youth camp and get the Holy Ghost of the youth camp they're at a movie theater watching who knows what watching a Disney movie right so so you know it's very important what because your kids will pick up on what you're feeding off of as a parent amen praise God amen so moving on here so sometimes we're like we're like oh but I'm watching this movie and there's a bunch of cursing in it but there is some good stuff in it you know I'm listening to this music there's some cursing and some some nasty things that they're talking about in the song but there's they mentioned the word Jesus twice in there and they say God they're probably saying it in vain you know so it must be okay you know to me that kind of reminds me like if you're digging in a trash can looking for cuz you're very hungry right you're digging in a trash bin and you find a piece of biscuit you like hole mine but you have to go through all that trash just to find the little bit that was good and then when you get to that little bit that's good it's all probably all stale and moldy but at the end so nothing that has the name of Christian it's not good for that don't the the world wants to make you believe Satan wants to make you believe that it is but it's not healthy and wholesome for you to grow in the stature of a perfect man right because that's what we want to grow right amen amen Eagles they trying to move a little quicker now Eagles in Psalms 103 look what Psalms 103 says if the brothers bring it up he says bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His Holy Name right bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits so there's benefits that come with serving God this was in the Old Testament but no forgetting all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities an iniquity is doing something that you're not supposed to do that you know that you're not supposed to and you do or not doing something that you know you're supposed to do and you still do it right that's iniquity who forgives all of your iniquities or the mighty God we serve who heals all by diseases the Shawn Mendes do that for you does Bruno Mars do that for you just playing Grand Theft Auto do that for you I don't think so who redeemeth thy life from destruction look at that you you're able to be kept from destruction the destruction that this world is heading to right now at this very moment and then they'll not even know it you are kept you can be kept from that amen its physical destruction spiritual destruction both ways who crown ethey with loving-kindness and tender mercies so thankful for to God for His mercy amen and look what verse 5 says who satisfies thy mouth with good things alright alright this this was not good but God has something good for you amen wholesome things and look at this so that thy youth is renewed like the Eagles praise God this is not just for the young people this is for us adults as well yeah where you were young and in Soul Amen praise God so because why an eagle does not eat rotten things an eagle when he kills and he's about to eat he kills he eats it and make sure it is eaten right away right he does not wait around that it's been dead with day two or three days like a crow or a buzzard or something that still you know you see them then they're just munching away all gathering around you know yeah and that's how it is with the world you know you see over there were leap worldly people when they gather around something they're at a concert and it's like them they're eating something dead and you're and if you desire that you I wish I was there I wish I could could be hang out with those you know why they're eating it it's like it's just think of think of it that it's like a bunch of buzzards eating a bunch of things now you seen buzzards flying around eating something dead you know and buzzards I mean this is just gross looking here anyways you see so now I want to talk about this Saints for just a moment young people listen if you stay with God's process you will never go wrong amen and so if the brothers can bring up the the fifth pick I think he already showed it but I hope I hope this is helping somebody brother Wade says Amen does that look good that looks much better Zoe that looks better than the rats right yeah that looks better Zoe Zoe that looks better than the egg right yeah it looks much she says you don't care all right this looks much better now there's a process for you to eat this right the way I the way I would hear any normal person is because I mean if you eat it first you drink the drink then you eat the fries and then you eat the hamburger and that's usually not how people eat this meal maybe if you're five years old you might eat it like that oh wait a second all right normally the way you would eat this is you would maybe start it start this is how I started drink a little bit first kind of swish it in my mouth a little bit swallow and then I start with the main course the hamburger right and then as you put it should make just pretend this is the hamburger and then you take prior to dip it in the ketchup and you put it in your mouth right that's the normal way to eat and then you kind of wash it down with some of the coke right and it's good right it's good some of you are looking like you guys don't like this well just pretend it's a chick-fil-a sandwich all right but that's the normal way of doing things right but what if I took this and I don't I think there's another picture I don't know if there's another picture or not okay there's no nevermind but what if I took all of these things right here and I had a blender right here and I put all these things together blending them all together it's the same food but you've just blended it all together you completely destroyed the process of how that can you can ingest that it's totally nasty after that just think about it I watched I watch the gun on on YouTube do it do it and and it came out like a toxic sludge type thing and somebody went out and somebody the guy was doing and he said he said one day somebody said who we willing to drink this and he was at a youth rally and said they said so some kids started coming up rushing he's like my wait a second I can't give you this they were rushing generated wanted to drink that you know to be there to drink that but you end drink that right how much much you know how much more it is with with with what you're engaged in in your life you see sometimes as young people you know we we don't want to wait for the normal process of things let's just take marriage for example you want to rush things you don't want to wait you know to to start courting first or actually first make sure that that your parents are in there in agreement right look at the make sure the person has the holy spirit right and if you're about almost that Marable age if you're young that 25 you know I got married at 25 I better make sure I had a job if I was thinking about getting married I better make sure I was willing to support ready to support my wife because I wouldn't blame her she said no when I would ask her if you'd marry me I wouldn't blame her if she said no there's normal there's a process for you to take before you take a big step a man to finish up the whole meal right and and if you wait on God right because this you know marriage having that relationship with your wife that bonding with your husband or your wife in the future if God has you to be married that's all wonderful those are normal things even even in the sexual life those are all normal things that God put in place for us to procreate right if you eaten in the right process it's good it's delicious but when you rush and try to do your own thing and and and and and and mix it all up and and and and going out with multiple boyfriends and having multiple girlfriends and going with this one and that one is just the mix-up in life amen it's a toxic sludge so all of those though that that could have been good that's delicious that's that's wonderful that's healthy now it's just a bunch of toxic sludge because that's what you've made out of it something to think about what are you making with the things with the pro' wait on God the Bible says that those that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as Eagles listen I've been there young man I've been there I've been there it's hard I know it's tough but I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me young ladies I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me fall in love with God fall in love with Christ fall in love like like Joseph was in love with God in so much that he were not even he had the opportunity to to do whatever with Potiphar's wife lay with his with his with his with with Potiphar's wife and he he feared God so much that he would not do such things he was a young man and that was in the Old Testament you have the opportunity to have the the Holy Ghost now because they can't have the Holy Ghost back then they can experience the new birth back then you can experience the new birth now how much more now with the grace of God and the mercy that we have now you're able a man God is more than able to keep you in this hour I believe that with all my heart I believe that you don't you don't have to be a puppet for that for the world you don't have to be a puppet for Satan just because oh well I have this need I've got to get I got to do something about this no there's a right order to take care of those things when you do it in the right order everything will be just fine you'll be able to enjoy that that that cheeseburger meal and oh my benefits and growth will come out of that I'll leave but when you take it out of order in a toxic sludge amen nothing will come good nothing good will come out of that they can turn that off now praise God so stay with God's process amen well because you know if we if we rush a man it what it but that does it makes God vomit he's looking at your toxic sludge you know G he said Jesus said in Revelations 3:16 he said because you're not hot nor cold I will spew thee out of my mouth in other words I will vomit you out of my mouth because you're not hot you're not cold I like coffee right but I like hot coffee but if I want to drink cold coffee I'm gonna drink cold coffee what they have called iced coffee right but I hate lukewarm coffee some coffee that's been sitting in the pot for about two hours and in the warmer gone off ooh I hate that that's nasty but I love hot fresh coffee and see if Jesus is saying this in the spiritual you know if it's like that in the physical didn't Jesus bringing it in the spiritual that way right amen so the Bible says in Psalms 34 8 and the brothers have this it says o taste and see that the Lord is good amen blessed is the man that trusteth in him see give the Lord a chance give the Lord a chance and you will realize wait a second this is much better than the me listen to Metallica this is much better than me sitting all day long playing video games this isn't much but gosh what I can't believe I was missing this that you realize how good god is if you give God a try if you if you say o taste and see that the Lord is good the Lord is good but see God has to reveal that to you when you're when you really have that revelation that he is good amen you you you'll come to his word you'll love that coming to the house of God the church you'll realize you God God will be one revelation after another and then what brother Dale is saying up here it won't be so ho-hum to you know I I just can't understand what brother Dale is saying maybe you need more of God maybe you need I can't understand what brother Wade's preaching about I don't understand I hate sitting there an hour and a half every every time we come to church maybe God is trying to tell you something are you listening are you really tasting what God is trying to feed you amen amen now the Bible it gives it gives certain examples of there's a lot of examples of eating in the Bible we know that at the beginning Sam came in the picture because of eating or partaking right and it wasn't eating a literal a literal fruit but it was poor taking he was eating and here here comes Jesus and the scriptures that we read at the bit at the beginning and he comes back and says well it's like Eve ate the wrong thing lusted for knowledge right and Jesus comes back and says now it's time to eat the true bread of God eating from that tree of from that from that tree of life that was sealed when Adam and Eve were kicked out of the Garden of Eden there was a way the guard that angels were there guarding from eating from that tree of life but now Jesus made a way for us to eat off that tree you see he's made a way for us to get back and eat off that tree and so when Eve was there and she was talking you know it didn't take it you know when we read it in the Bible of what happened in the Garden of Eden between the Serpent and the inn and Eve we think that it was a thing that took place in like ten seconds no the serpent could have probably been talking to him to her four four five ten years whatever if it could have been a hundred years I don't know it could have been a long time see Satan's patient he's patient because when he he knows what he wants he knows what his outcomes gonna be right so you might as well just take whoever he came with him right so he's patient then he's gonna do everything he can and so he was patient with Eve probably had her on snapchat chatting with her he said look at here you see that Santa sent her the picture you can have this you can have this if you you know God said don't eat off the the the tree or you know what you know you know what the scripture says there and Eve was like yeah he said you know if we eat off of it we'll die so he takes another picture probably one of himself surely you're not surely die surely you'll not die when that slicker comes around you know he may not come that way but you know there's you can tell us laughs ah there can tell when the slickers around you know and he starts playing you know Bert may be very very playful maybe you know trying to make you laugh you know if he can get you to react that way if he can make you laugh if he can make you amen he's winning you that's probably what Satan was doing with Eve trying to make her laugh and then all of a sudden I started to it started he started maybe touching her head tapping I won't touch him wake up trying to touch her head maybe and then putting his hand on her shoulder you know I'm telling you Satan's ass licker Satan's lie Hey and he'll be patient and then maybe they went back Eve went back to Adam that night and said now I'm at this this this the serpent you know he's a pretty nice guy you know maybe we can get together or sometime and have some coffee you know and uh Adams like okay so here she comes the next day she's probably minding her own business and here comes mr. slicker again hey what's going on girl hey hey what you had on was nice yesterday but what you got on today is really nice I like that I like them shoes out and you know you want to start winning a girl start talking about her clothes how nice her clothes are and stuff like that okay maybe just worked for me [Laughter] all right but Satan Satan's a slicker until finally she was convinced she was convinced that you know she she was gonna be a god you know and and no not the good and evil and and be more than God and finally she fell in and the whole race human race was sold out all right amen the children of Israel when they were when they were leaving the land of Egypt right and God told Moses and told Aaron and said for them to take a lamb or even the Bible says a goat a male goat or male lamb and says in in in and cook it burn it and eat it the whole thing even the Angels all right but sometimes we want to pick and choose what we want to eat I don't like what brother dole said there I'll take that but I won't take that but God said for you to eat everything if it's the Word of God and that lamb represents the Jesus Christ and they had to eat with with their shoes on their feet they had to eat with ready to go and the Bible says that they had to eat that food in haste that whole thing they had to eat it if a hidden haste and not eat it raw like I like to eat raw sushi not eat it raw but eat it cooked right roasted with herbs amen and not watered down either it's what it says if you read if you go back and read in Exodus they're not watered down but sometimes we want to water down the Word of God we want to we want to just nitpick what we like and what we don't like when you know it's in the word but you just don't want to apply it in your life personally you're too proud you don't want to give up your pride you don't want to give up what you know your your your stature in amongst the congregation because I don't want to receive that a man then you're not leaving Egypt you're not leaving Egypt you're in bondage still right amen the children of it the one time there was a Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and when they were captured from Bab from Babylon when the the children of Israel captured by Babylon and they the King said I want you to pick one of his servants I want you to pick the best young man to come and I'm gonna feed them from my meat and I'm gonna give him some of my wine I want you to pick the best message guys they've been in the message all their life they were born in this message they grew up in this message and I want you to bring I want you to feed them and give them my meat my choice meat that's probably what Satan's one into because Satan if you notice I don't know if you've noticed but Satan loves to attack pastors kids loves to attack those that are in position want to try to down the the reputation of that man or that woman I want I want the best and that's what Satan wants he wants the best but he's and and so the young people of that day those young men they're like but what's wrong with with the Kings meat it's helping him you know it's good but the Bible says that Daniel purposed in his heart purposed in his heart out of all those message kids who are considering leaving the message we're considering leaving the word going to the world start living like the world going behind the mom and dad's back and doing things behind their mom and dad's back out of all of them there was one that said I ain't gonna do that I will not do it I was taught better than that by God himself by my god I fear my god too much Daniel purposed in his heart and you know what he had it took a lot of risk and it took a lot of a lot from him to be able to take that stand because the Bible says that Daniel purposed in his heart doesn't tell us that the other three purposed in their heart but because of his testimony he won them he wants Shadrach Meshach and Abednego you see so if you take a stand for Christ if you take a stand for what's right then somebody's gonna notice that you're like my goodness man he takes a stand she takes a stand I think I'll just go with that and and so Daniel tells the the the king's servant says listen we don't want any of this meat because it's sacrificed to gods it's been it's been offered to gods we don't want this wine because it's been given to gods we don't want to have anything to do with that because the Israelite people didn't they weren't supposed to do that and so just feed us vegetables feed us feed us because least you know these beans and vegetables and rice and things like that and you wait 10 days now the king he was he told his servants like let's wait three years after three years I'll check back with you after they've been eating my meat to see if they've been how they are how but at Daniel he had so much faith in his God that God was going to be right there pouring the exact vitamins that he needs pouring everything that he needs for the food that they were eating they he's like you he wants to wait three years I just give us ten days and look at us after that and if you keep reading there and the Bible says after ten days they looked much healthier then then then then the ones they were enjoying the Kings meat and the Bible says that they were filled with wisdom and the King Nebuchadnezzar after three years they realized my goodness he was surprised how Daniel was how he grew in the Lord you see when you take a stand in faith for what's right God's gonna back you up hey man God's gonna back you up the Sara Phoenician women woman when she was saying came to the Lord screaming out Lord Lord help me my daughter is vexed Beck's with the devil and Jesus had to write all the right to tell her you the meet this this did I'm given to you this food is not for you because she was a Gentile and he had already told his disciples do not go by the way of the Gentiles so here's Jesus here's Jesus he's he's he's about to break what he had told his disciples and so and so the woman says it he says it's not jesus tells her it's not meat for me to give this food to you dogs it's not me uh-uh you're you're a dog and I can't give you this food this food but she said in faith she had faith in those little crumbs she said but Lord I know you're right see when you when you break when you let your pride go and you say you know what what he's saying is right well she's what my mom and dad are telling me is right and you let your pride go and you realize and you have faith in what that word of God that word of God will will give you exactly what you need and so she said but even even the crumbs that fall from the master table the dogs are able to enjoy and that just one Jesus he's like I can't believe this I've had not seen faith like this by anybody else in Jerusalem amen and he told the woman go and have what you want amen so even even that's why I was saying even the little crumbs that you may get from a service if you take those in faith they'll go a long way a long way you may not understand everything that all the quotes and everything anyway but just take the little crumbs they'll give you what you need amen God is concerned about amen so the and just finishing up right here hey man how many love the Lord a man don't get sleepy on me amen we read we read here in Revelation in Revelation chapter 10 verse 8 it says that the verse says level is just was just read it I'm sorry it says that the brothers could bring it up revelation 10 8 says and the voice which I heard this is John now and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth all right so that book that book was open it was open it was an open book that Jesus Christ opened Jesus Christ no man was able to break these seals only the Lord Jesus was able to break these seals right so the book was open when John was saying this in verse 9 is this and I went unto the angel and said unto Him and give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up all right and they shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey so this thing starts a man this thing starts the chaos of sin comes in into this world by eating and it ends up in eating now you and me have to eat the book amen you and me have to eat amen it was one time I was it was one time a death to go in behind the inner veil to go into into the Ark of God only the priests were able to go in there now it's death if you don't go back there amen it's death if you don't go back in there and he says in verse 10 10 and I took the little book out of the Angels hand and ate it and it was and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter that's what happens when you decide that you want to serve the Lord for for real you really want to serve God you really want to take take the chance and you really want to risk everything like Daniel risks could risk everything on that sir finish and risked everything you really want go at it it's gonna be sweet at first oh it's fun okay I love serving the Lord I love serving God and then I come home and I see that Grand Theft Auto oh I love that game too but you have to make a decision what is that gonna feed my soul or is that gonna hurt me more right it's gonna be bitter for some of us some of us it's a you think you come to be a Christian and it's a probably better these and sometimes that's when that's when you have more problems in life I said it happened to me more issues and more problems in life when you come serving the Lord so it's sweet yes it's sweet sweet as honey by the way but it's bitter like those herbs that they ate back in the in the Exodus that's why they had to have those bitter in there as well you see amen and he said unto me revelaed last verse verse 11 and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings it's our it's our we are to do that work that Jesus Christ didn't finish when he was here on earth brother Brandon said that we are to finish it up you and I God is gonna have a adult to do that God's gonna have a young person as an overcomer God's gonna have a middle-aged person that's an overcomer God's gonna have even a child as an overcomer and this hour why because he said so there's gonna be a people there's gonna be spot without spot without wrinkle I hope that you say that you're that one and that you make a decision in your heart tonight that I will not be defiled by the Kings meat anymore that I will not be defiled by Babylon anymore Babylon meaning Hollywood and all these things that the world provides i-i-i-i-i purpose in my heart that I will not go that way anymore because that is not helping me grow in the stature of a perfect man amen Merle Branham says here now our bodies need food and drink each day to survive listen to this the brothers they can bring it up if they have it our physical body if we don't take food each day and drink than our body weakens there's something in us that we must have food a month there's something in us that we must have food one day's food will not last for the next day we can go with that about the manna and everything but lack of time you've got to have food each day to strengthen your mortal beam right you can live over but you're weaker and the second day you're still weaker and the third day you're getting tremendously weaker well that's what many times that we do in the spiritual realm you see each day we've got to commune with Christ we've got to talk to him each day we've got to settle it with him each day Paul said I die each day see each day I die yet I live not me but Christ lives in me so if your physical body needs food each day and drink each day to survive your spiritual body needs spiritual food and communion with the Lord each day to survive not just on Wednesdays and Sundays yes Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God so each day we've got to study the Bible this is your prophet speaking each day we've got to study the Bible some people doesn't study it at all some picks it up every two or three times a year I hope there's nobody here like that but a real real believer that's really spiritually built up he reads his Bible every day and talks to the Lord that's right he has two men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God right and that's why that's why in 1st Corinthians chapter 10 verse 16 says this listen what it says the cup of blessing which we bless it is not the communion of the blood of Christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Christ verse 17 for we being many are one bread right in one body for we are all partakers of that one bread so you want to be the bread that others can feed off of when they're around you you feed off the bread of life amen because when you feed off the bread of life amen you'll become that bread that Living bread that others can also benefit from you as well I was thirsty this water was in here hey amen but now this aquafina water isn't me you can't see it but it's doing something in my life amen I feed off the bread of God Jesus Christ he'll be in you so that others can feed off of you a man praise God how many love the Lord Amen let's stand to our feet I hope that you just don't take this and say oh that's just brother Louise he's up there you know and he's just trying to be funny and he's trying to know take this for your children's sake you have young children take it for you you apply to your life so that your children can apply to your lives I have young children that I need to I'm gonna answer for them one day and if I'm living like a devil at home then don't be surprised that your children are living like Devils hope you take that into consideration amen let's just bow our heads our Heavenly Father we thank you Lord Jesus for this opportunity that we have to open your word Lord you said that everything father in your word is beneficial for us for reproof - for us to grow more in you Lord Jesus father God I can't remember all the script reverse right now but Lord you know what I'm talking about and I just pray Lord that you would just help us to just take these things and meditate and chew on them Lord Lord they're beneficial to us there's a purpose that you said you are the bread of life Lord you are
