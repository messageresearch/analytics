day or I don't do it for that he said there's just something inside that pushes me up out of the earth and keeps me pushing up and keeps me pushing up so good to be in the house of the Lord remember if anybody wants to go to Ruth Willis Thursday and Friday we'll be there for service if none of you went I know a lot of time several years we have uh went on Friday together it's really an experience

to go you can follow us up it's about an hour drive from here and they start at six o'clock so if I won't be so long-winded maybe we'll have enough time so Son of Man part 123. in the beginning was the word where was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory the only begotten of the father full of grace and Truth John 3 verse 3 said Jesus answers and said verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God and that word see means what understand because remember he told the disciples he said the world see me no more but you'll see me you'll see me because I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age you may be seated in the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word and then Nicodemus you know looking back in the Old Testament Nicodemus is like how can a man be born when he's old how can I enter back into my mother's womb and be born and and Jesus said verily verily I say unto you except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God and we were talking about this this morning that's extremely important that we do it right it's extremely important that we do we we go through justification and we go through sanctification and we go through the baptism of the Holy Ghost because you can just you can get born again in one in one sitting it has happened oh look at the man you take people like on the day of Pentecost you said well they just the Holy Ghost fell on those people today at Pentecostal they just got the new birth but now remember foreign they had walked with Jesus for three and a half years they walked with the word the word was justifying and the Word was telling them I'm coming hang on a little bit this is not what you're going to get you're going to get the promise we'll read it in just a minute right before he left he laid it out he told him he said go to Jerusalem and you'll be endued with power from on high go there and wait and tarry all right so he told them where to go where to wait and that he was coming back and of course they the next question they asked him they said well are you going to restore the kingdom to Israel they thought he was still going to stay there but see they didn't understand but on the day of Pentecost you know they had a moment to where they're like oh man this is what he was talking about this is when the Holy Ghost is going to come inside and then do the work and we see what happened to him in the early church ages that's why that brother Bynum and I got it way over in the uh where it gets up there to the Holy Spirit but brother Ryan tells us he says you know the the maokai 4 has got to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers well we're talking about what the fathers are doing now what they were doing the faith of the fathers all right taking the Babylon Pentecostal babies that had lost their first love that had went through six Church ages basically and had the word had been eat down by man's Creeds and man's ideas and it was not of any effect right as it was in the first church age so that's why brother Brown had a call by it Malachi had to call us back that Prophet called us back to those fathers to give us a chance to get the headstone back because the headstone will read it maybe it'll be next be Wednesday night probably I want to continue on before both Keith gets here but um The Headstone was rejected why was it rejected it had no power because if people took the power away from it the people Satan really Satan wanted to kill Jesus sure he did through the people but he's wanting to kill him again by killing his influence and that's what he done because he told him in the first church he said you've lost your first love I mean right there at the beginning and listen they were a powerful Church they had the Holy Ghost working in their life that Silver and Gold Have I None they walked in you know somebody lied against the holy ghost that fell dead we want that around well we're going to get it because the Bible promised us we'd have an anani since the fire again so it's going to happen all over again Bible even tells us there'll be a time when the sinner can't even sit here it's hard for some to see here anyway you get to squirming and all those kind of things walk out the door and don't come back and all that other stuff so but Jesus said very very I say and you accept a man be born of water and spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God so what is the entrance to the kingdom it is by the new birth by Jesus Christ no other way not by William Branham everybody with me he didn't come to preach us a new gospel he didn't come to give us a different Bible he didn't come and give us a different way to get born again but yet he's the most misunderstood as far as being born again because they said he taught it several different ways well he never did he always kept it exactly the way it was supposed to be he always yeah you know you hear people they they have that little point or angle that that brother Brown changed a lot in 1963 after the seals broke well the only thing he changed was is the things that he got wrong before he corrected them after he ain't changed the way you got born again they say he he changed the way that now it's just you just you know just boom realize who you are you know no praise God on the future home brother Branham said now this was after the seals broke and this was toward the end of his life he said I've preached the same message of justification sanctification the baptism the Holy Ghost he showed it all the way through the future home showed us how we went through it showed us how the world had to go through it all right so he didn't change the people changed his idea just like they have now they've changed it to everything in the world but there is a truth somewhere and I hope you find it I hope I find it I'm praying that I'm going to find it I believe we found it but that's for you to decide all right brother Billy I'm saying you except a man be born of water spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God for that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit the spirit look he said marble run come on Nicodemus you're the teacher of Israel and you can't understand this why you didn't understand it he didn't have the new birth he had a Old Testament idea all right that's some of our problems now we got people with Old Testament ideas whoops Acts 19 verse 1 said he came to pass it while Apollos was a Corinth Paul the messenger to the church age passed through the upper coast of Ephesus finding certain disciples now he didn't just find him he was watching he was listening to him preach because he said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed well believe what he had to be able to listen to what they were saying he knew there was something missing because they were preaching John's gospel well John's gospel was found during John's age but John's gospel the door closed he was introduced to Messiah not to have a Ministry he was a messenger but he wasn't a church age messenger he was to introduce the head that was his job nothing else then you come now to where you see that the disciples Paul Peter James John they have the word of God for the hour and they're preaching and then here's Paul with the word with the message of the hour and he's listening to them preaching he says there's something missing here if y'all received the Holy Ghost since you believe and obviously they answered his question they said we don't know what you're talking about and that's probably that's basically what the people when the message of the hour came on the scene even with brother Branham they it had all been eroded so much to where they thought it was just the baptism or as we read this morning it's just shaking of hands or it's or it's you know shouting or speaking you know I mean he comes among the Pentecostals and I know they like they loved him for a time but when he told them he said look he said speaking in tongues it's not the evidence of the Holy Ghost Buddy they didn't like him no more because that's what they built their whole Doctrine on their whole Doctrine was built on you speak in tongues you got the Holy Ghost brother Brown told him he said that's not true he taught them the correct baptism the way to get baptized not just only in in G in the name of the Lord Jesus but how to get the Holy Spirit baptism all right now listen I'd rather have the Holy Ghost baptism right than my other baptism right if I get my Holy Ghost baptism right I will go get the other one right all right so everything's connected together so brother Brown's talking about Jesus's first Doctrine I'm gonna try to fly through this was you must be born again now why wasn't you must be born again because he was the one who was going to birth them and if they didn't understand him which they didn't and he knew they wasn't going to it's like brother random you know he stands there and he says you're not going to get this it's not for you he knew that the word was going forth he knew that the that the anointing was going out and it was not hitting anything during that whole week of the sales he was throwing he was throwing the the most perfect message that had ever been preached the seals were being open and they're just you know sitting there so he said you're not getting it it's not for you sometimes messages are preached and you wonder who it's for right is it my turn Lord must not have been it must have been brother George's term because he really needed it yeah who made you God yeah that was for sister Regina and we find out that I got you we find out there's so many different meanings that people put to it nearly all churches say You must be born again all right so every church and even every message Church knows you got to get born again but their way of getting born again versus other ways of getting born again sometimes they're not the same all right this church here believes that you need to be justified you need to be Sanctified and you need to be all those two to get the new birth not just the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the new birth all right be careful with your terminology because remember I'll read you a quote later later on down the road brother Brown said you can have the Holy Ghost on your spirit every day of your life and die and go to hell okay on your spirit realm he never said if you had the new birth say John didn't get the new birth John had the baptism in the Holy Ghost he had an anointing Elizabeth had an anointing all right that's hard to explain to people too because listen the Holy Ghost was not given to anyone's soul I'm even talking about the woman at the well the woman at the well brother Brown said there was eternal life and it sprang up I know those quotes but you got to remember she couldn't get the Holy Ghost in her soul before the disciples there's no way potentially yes because remember Jesus before he died he breathed on him and said receive ye the Holy Ghost now brother Brown said they did not receive it right then he said that was a promise that they were going to receive it because that Holy Ghost listen that Holy Ghost was bottled up inside of that man amen and it could not get out until they killed him to release the life to come back on me and you everybody with me on that amen that's the meaning of being born again it's that life coming inside of me not on me and changing my life so the methodists and everybody's got a different way but we know one thing's for sure we believe that you got to be justified as we were talking about this morning we got to be Sanctified and then we've got to come to the New Birth where there is a new creature a new creation all right old things are passed away behold all things have become new all right like I said this morning the whole problem is is when we when we get into trouble we want God to change our our you know around here we'll start with this guy first that's not yeah well I won't I won't listen I want a good wife and I want a good job you ought to be born again not much not you ought to be as you must if you'll start with getting born again God will help you with all that other stuff all right so like I said before quit trying to do that quit trying to change your world get changed yourself get a new attitude a new thought get a get a get a fire going inside there all right get something that you say man this is different I had lived this around this message for years grew up in it nine years old eight years old all the way up to 18 years old knew it like the back of my hand believed in serpent seed I knew that I knew my part my problem was at 18 years old everybody with me and I knew about marriage and divorce and I knew about all those other things but I was just lost as a Goose right yeah right I didn't get this guy changed he finally got this guy changed it had been different but I knew the message and I grew up on a Pew with a message church this one actually and all those things but that don't mean nothing you must be born again you must be changed from inside out it's all got to start from inside out skip through some of this you know Lord changed no change me it'll make you see your neighbor different you can never change your neighbor you're still what you were until you're actually born again of the spirit of God still what you were you can suppress it you can push it down you can just like try to hide it but it will get out yes sir that's right whatever you are will come out I'll promise you uh you're still what you were until you've actually got born again of the spirit of God it doesn't change you now he didn't say the spirit of God didn't he's talking about the Creed and the denomination all that won't change you your Creed join in church change your idea are your good intentions although as good as it might seem it's still not right there's something got to happen the new birth is an experience something that takes place and I know a lot of you are wondering you say well well do I have the new birth find an experience I mean a good one not just a good day versus a bad day not just a I got more money than I did last month I must be born again no you got an experience well some of you most of you in this building sisters have had children right right so you know what I'm talking about you know you had that baby because you had an experience amen you were there and what'd it do it changed your life well I'll play it man anyway your sister don't have to it changed your life started having them yangans change your life so the new birth's the same way if you get born again it'll change your life it'll make you have an experience and look something that takes place yes nail that thing down sister Ruth should not hear him she's not feeling good she's probably watching in so she really don't care if I use it for an example I'd use a refuse here anyway but um sister Ruth and I go way back we grew up together and her dad was in this church and she was a little bitty thing in the church and and I watched her and I went away and she kind of floated away and then back and forth and and the other day last year when we were baptizing her you know you can and I'm just going to be I don't know I've got work I'm like Claude I'm gonna be honest with you were you gonna lie no I'm gonna be honest with you when a person looks at you and goes I'm tired I want a change I want something that I can put down and she looked at me out there in the water and she stood to me she said this is it now when she said this is it to me that sounded so different what do they call it a hollow promises we've heard of hollow promises you know promises that don't have anything into it it's just something that you say at the in the moment but when somebody comes to a juncture in their life when somebody comes to a place in their life to where like I said you're sick and tired of being sick and tired she was sick and tired of being pulled this way and pulled that way and pushed this way and push that way she said this is it and when she looked at me I said I believe you believe that pretty much I don't know I didn't say exactly that but I when I looked at it I thought man she really believes this time because there's a lot of people I mean come on we baptized people three or four or five times don't need to but if you want it we'll do it but you need to nail her down one day and say look this is it so she did so that's what I'm saying there's a there's a place in your time in your life where something's going to click it's going to have to because you've got your normal world everybody with me here for a minute before you start going to sleep I'm going to get to you okay are you ready we've got our normalcy right we got our work we got our kids and husbands job blah blah blah right but there is something that you come in here to sit today that there is a small world inside of your big world everybody with me here there's a small world inside of your big world and that small world is the reason you're here not the big world all right you've took a time out of your big world to come into this small world but remember that small world is worth way more than ten thousand of these other worlds all right right ten thousand worlds man that's your your soul so that's what you brought here today you didn't bring your body here because maybe your body didn't want to come maybe your body's tired arm hurts everything hurts but you brought your soul here today your soul is what we're talking to your soul is what God is speaking to God is not speaking to your flesh because your flesh only reacts to what that God was inside so you brought your little world you brought your little you brought your soul here and if that soul is worth ten thousand worlds then let's talk to it that's what needs to be born again let's don't get an anointing that just makes us feel born again it will not stay that way because when you go out into your big world this will dissolve into nothing and it'll become the big world again I may not ever be able to say that again but I said it one time but that's what you [Applause] what you drew you here one of the two isn't that the truth you either wanted to come or you came because XYZ kids especially got drove to church all my life I was drugged as a kid all my life I drove to church every Sunday every Wednesday but you know what when you get the person inside of you when that reason to come is that you want to listen to somebody tell you about that person that's inside of you to me that's the connection that comes together and it can't come apart see that's what you're looking for you're looking for something that settle your soul bring you to church get you around other believers and listen we can speak our problems and we can speak our ups and our Downs and now what we're here for that's what we're here for to bring testimony or to bring I should have done this but pray for me because this is bothering me this this I have a problem with if you don't have one pray for me I probably got yours because I have them it's called me but the reason we have to be born again is because the Bible teaches us that we were born in sin all came same way shape and iniquity come to this world speaking lies then that shows us that our nature look our nature that's the soul our nature was what sinful we're no good to begin with so we cannot claim anything by our shrewdness sincerity and how great we are or how little we are or whatever more we are all together wrong to begin with right so you can't say oh you can say it but you can't say God made me this way you made yourself that way get that way because my spirit upon All Flesh all right I'm pouring it out you either got to receive it or reject it one of the two you got to make a decision and your sons and your daughters are prophesy old man dream dream young man see Visions we'll continue through this a little fast and upon the service and handmaids he's not losing leaving anybody out that's right he's going to pour out his spirit so that you can either receive it or you can be deceived and it shall come to pass to whosoever shall call in the name of the Lord shall be delivered for in Mount Zion in Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as the Lord has said in the remnant whom the Lord shall call so there's the Holy Ghost spread out among the whole world yes if everybody now there's eight billion people in this world now it's one up to 8 billion now there's eight billion people in this world all eight billion could get the Holy Ghost today if they'd want it and God would be no less God he'd be more happy than than he is now because everybody would accept him but he knows that everybody's not going to all right so now Hebrews 9 we were talking about Tabernacle this morning there was an actual Tabernacle in the wilderness that God set up that people could come to and the and the uh high priest could come to that would not take away their sins but it would cover them and keep God from killing them it will keep God to where he didn't couldn't come down through that and kill him that was the covering or the Capo they were covered but God didn't want that God wants children that he can eradicate sin take that old nature out and put his nature in he wants children to act like him yes and that's what he was heading towards but he couldn't just drive Jesus down I mean why didn't he just bring Jesus in the Garden of Eden you ever thought about that close Abraham was part of the plan the part of the plan he saw by what for knowledge he saw all these Isaiah everybody had a part to play to fulfill a part of him everybody with me that would fulfill a part of him Abraham what father of our faith Moses you'll raise up a prophet Prophet lock unto me all right all the identifications were in the Old Testament prophets the different ones but remember they looked for one to come and Jesus stood there one day and he said the prophets would have loved to have been in this day but now listen he said but a greater is here today I say that the same thing here sure it would have been wonderful Ben and brother Brown's day but you know what you'd have been real old and you'd have had a long journey but thank God he gave us an opportunity that we have people like sister cleaning different ones that wasn't the that was that could tell us the scenario of what went on while brother Ram was here but you got to catch a message of the hour inside here uh to me it's like it's like brother uh um who was oh brother Tom your dad always say he's the memo War Stories well everybody likes old War Stories I don't but I don't want that to be part of my life I want to have my own story all right this is my story this is my song what praising my savior so I want these things to be brought up present day yes so today this is present day amen all right to present day to get born again is what not to go into a temple to go into a physical building and go through one place and go through another place and meet God there that was for one man back in the Old Testament that was for the high priest but the Holy Ghost now though is signifying and using that as we were talking about here this morning that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first Tabernacle was yet standing and as I said again there was and if you don't understand it ask a question because there the new birth means it means that God took took something out it took the old nature out of your soul and put his nature in all right and that could only be by the releasing of the Holy Ghost the releasing of that Spirit right well in the Garden of Eden God could not he released it to Adam he released it to Eve and they were supposed to start the family of God everybody with me they were supposed to start the family of God but God knew as brother Ram tells us that God knew when he put him in flesh they'd fall but here he is holding savior Redeemer healer he's going to come yes see he sent that first Covenant and they broke it listen he sent his man of the hour Adam and he broke it all right and he knew that but he gave him a chance so he withheld that that taking of the nature out and putting the nature of God in to when Christ came on Earth he brought that nature with him and by with me and that was Perfection he knew that over here they couldn't be Perfection bulls and goats can't perfect you all right because remember if they'd have kept they kept making that sacrifice every year every day who was it Saul uh no so um Solomon that was one day when they made so many sacrifices for the people they said you couldn't even number them they forgot how they couldn't even count them they were so many sacrifices made when they dedicated the temple and all that they gathered everybody together and they started confessing their sins and they just started killing animals well praise God we don't have to do that today praise God we didn't have to drag a lamb in the building or a turtle dove or whatever it was or a cow and but you brought yourself yes sir the Bible tells you to be a what a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto the Lord and that's what God was looking at but he couldn't give it because of sin but if there had been no sin there had been no savior pretty simple if Adam would have never had a headache there'd be no healer there's been no need for it but as the need was God had to allow them knowing that plan would work and no one down through the Old Testament that he could use types and shadows but that he would have to come according to Genesis 3 15 he would have to come and not just get with him get in him and then he was in them that's our stage he's in us now it's wonderful if he's above us it's wonderful he's with us I don't want him standing beside me today that's right that's right well I'll make you quiet because I can be fooled because I'm an individual but if I got him inside of me I got him inside of me see that will make the comer there unto perfect where the blood of bulls and goats couldn't put the blood of bulls and ghosts only as brother Brown tells us pushes it pushed that sand to Calvary but when he got to Calvary he said lay it on me I'll take it all but remember their position as we were talking about this morning their position was they can't be made perfect without the bride being made perfect first how you gonna make the attendance perfect before you make your bride perfect everybody with me the bride's got to be perfect first because she's part of him she is him as Eve was part of Adam back in the Garden of Eden so we're just rolling right back to the right back to the same place where we were thought that we started from it we're just not we're coming by sex now but by sex to get our body here and then by spiritual multiplication to get our soul redeemed that pushed the two together and if we if we have to pass away that's go this is because of the Fall but you can't blame this staying the way it is because of the Fall I'm talking about your soul when I do this I'm talking about your soul the inner being of you the one that the motivator the one that makes you do the things that you do all right they could not make him that did the service perfect that's pertaining to the conscience so in other words make a sacrifice still a sinner make the sacrifice still a sinner but Christ being made a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle what his flesh not made with hands they needed to say not of this building neither by the blood of ghosts and cows but by his own blood he entered and once the holy Place having obtained look having obtained Eternal Redemption for us amen he had to get it his body was not eternal he was not a complete Eternal person right he had a body it wasn't a sinful body but it was made to come into this sinful world to take on mine in your sin and then he was perfected yes and eternal after he'd come out of the grave you know every person is packed stone is going to do the same thing all those that have passed on folks they're not coming back to do something something they're coming back with an eternal body their death has done nothing but just put them in a place of holding and waiting till we come to Perfection on this side and when we do they're just going to step over here and we're not going to have to uh speak nothing to them they're done they're complete they're finished we don't have to speak their new body they're just gonna come right back into here pick up their body they're ready to go how much more shall the blood of Jesus or Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God and for this cause he is a mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgression that were under the first testament first testament old testament all right they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance New Testament the New Testament in my blood where a testament is there must be a death of that testator so Jesus stood and he said look I'm the New Testament I'm going to give you this new way remember I've been reading to you bro where Jesus said a new commandment I give you it was all new that's why Nicodemus had a problem with it it was all new that's why listen today if this is all new to you that's okay you must be born again that don't change that but it can be a new way how can you tell the world but just if you're just a good Baptist I mean man you can just you shake your hand and and you sign your name and remembering good standing and you ain't gotta go to church no more once saved always saved some of y'all already doing that um but anyway but what about this new way though that we're talking about bring that person and set them in here and say look man you got to be justified well I believe the Lord Jesus Christ and I will save you can't you and you can't deny that they did but you got to go on with God there's more to that or to that that's a whole new testament to that well we're going to talk about Paul says grow up Desiring the sincere milk of the word but then growing on up we're going to get to that going on up this way so we know as brother Bob we were talking about this morning Hebrews 11 verse 39 and these all all that whole Hall of faith in the Old Testament they obtained a good report through faith they received not the promise listen the promise was you're going to live eternally in a flesh body that is your promise I don't care about no other problems oh yeah there's others there's anointings but if you're not born again if you don't receive the promise that God said you're going to live here eternally in a body that's got Flesh on it and it's your flesh it's not somebody else's see that's another thing you take somebody from a denomination and you bring them in here and say look man what do you think I'm gonna get well I I listen I have experienced that I went to church with a guy one time Mark Gunner he just got saved and he was a Baptist and I mean he was just I wish some of y'all had a little bit of that he was just so excited he wanted me to go to church with him and listen to this brother preach well this brother gets up and preach unless that's what he preaches them he preaches on when um Samson they made him mad remember Samson had a little bit of a temper they made Samson mad so instead of uh killing a bunch of people he just took a couple of foxes read your Bible he tied their tails together and set them on fire and sent him out through the wheat field well they'd just burned all our wheat up oh they were mad well he was preaching on that how that God would do that with you you know he'll light the tale of a fox and send it through your life and he just burned everything up but we got outside I knew he had a rough voice I've been around smokers all my life he had this Gruff voice you know it's just it just didn't come from just their mom and daddy it came from a camel and Pall Mall and and Marlboro you know the Marlboro Man seven so he goes out soon as he walks out the door I mean he's you know laying that pack of cigarettes out he goes to smoking and one of the brothers did say well now and he got the coffin they got the coffin I mean he was just coughing coughing coughing I think Daddy went with me but he was confident we were kind of giggling at him he was coughing though he couldn't get somebody would say something to him he was like yeah you know couldn't get nothing but smoke out and somebody said well brother I ain't gonna call his name but brother so and so said said said you're gonna die if you don't quit smoking and this is what he said he put that cigarette in his mouth and he said I ain't worried about this body because I'm gonna get me a new one and that's been probably 15 years ago he may not be seeing that at the moment but that's his whole thing was it doesn't matter what I do with this one in other words somehow it got detached from my Christian experience and I'm going to get this new one God's gonna just throw me another one in there because that's when I abused no wrong answer Ghost Rider nope no you're attached to your flesh and you're going to be with your flesh until you either go to hell or go to heaven but listen that's a Doctrine that's a doctrine that they put on the people that it's okay if you drink a little smoke a little you know because this body we're just going to throw it out you know get us another one no the Bible says if you abuse this thing you're gonna have trouble Hebrews 11 verse 39 so these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise the promise of eternal life in their soul God having some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect but they're going to be made perfect I believe when we come to Perfection wherever they are they're going to come to Perfection too all right so you can fill in the blanks every how you want to I just know there's one thing the Bible says they're not for they're not fully matured yet that's what the Bible just said they without us so basically they can't get anywhere without us getting somewhere first and like I said before God has bestowed everything on this bride Best of the Best best ministers best teaching best message best people to listen best people to talk to best people to fellowship with that's his people that's his bride Troy's not gonna give a second he's giving us first Peter said repent and be baptized everyone in the name of Jesus Christ for their mission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise there's your promise for the promise what of receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost is unto you your children all them that are far off that's me even as man the Lord Our God shall call Brother Ramen blasphemus names he said look the reason that there's so much confusion today about the Holy Spirit is not correctly taught I believe it's the baptism is taught just say baptism just like you say automobile but listen there's a lot more to an automobiles than just say an automobile that's pretty much what he was saying because looks and when you talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit there's a lot goes with that see there's a lot goes with that and here is what I think that God is proving he's proven the holy spirit is here what is he saying the holy spirit's saying through brother Branham listen to what I got to say because this is the holy spirit talking to you without him puffing up saying you got to listen to me bless God no you didn't have to but it just was the vessel that God wanted to use at the time to get the message to us I thank God for that he could have just left us hanging right he could have just said hey like what brother Brown say I'm gonna try to find that quote brother Ryan said if I was God I'd tell you one time and he said I wouldn't tell you no more I tell you one time and if you didn't do what I said then out you go well praise God God didn't do that he's given us 60 something years to get this thing right starting with a new birth yes now here's Ezekiel therefore saying to the house of Israel thus saith the Lord God I do this for your sake o House of Israel but I don't I do not for your sake no House of Israel but for mine holy namesake which you have profaned among the heathen whether you went uh that's us and I will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the Heathen which you have profaned in the midst of them and the Heathen shall know that I am the Lord saith the Lord God when I shall be Sanctified in you amen see I didn't get to it this morning but what cleans your uncleanness if I may say it that way when we get to that scenario where the unclean spirit's gone out of you why clean your house and he's not a hireling I know that but something has come in there's a there's a there's something come in there's Surf Pro or somebody like that is come in you behind you become a mess you stink you're full of smoke everybody know what Servpro is right right when something happens some catastrophe something burns down they come in and man they supposedly put the thing back to where you don't even Smell Smoke and all that stuff well you know what that's God God's my Servpro call him up say hey clean my house out because listen you gotta want it yes he's not going to just walk in and say I'm cleaning this out I wish you'd have done it to me 30 something years 40 years ago but it wasn't time because he's a gentleman and I had to ask him can you come into my heart can you come and clean me up because I'm a mess I've tried I might have wiped a little off over here or or dabbed a little over here or or you know water will clean you a little bit but it takes a little soap and scrubbing to get the rest of it off right okay so you try to do that but there's a time when you just say God I'm just a burning mess and I want to get rid of all this so that's who comes in and burns out that unclean spirit okay all right so the unclean Spirit goes out why because something comes in and burns it out but remember it burns it out and then it waits on you it waits on you to decide that that person stays or leaves you with me you understand what I'm talking about because if not if he leaves then it's empty the Bible says and then those Seven Devils come back and they enter into your house all right make it a lot worse for I will take you from among the Heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land what is Our Land listen we Gentiles don't have a piece of land hey man Israel literally has a piece of land brother George Smith asked me the other day he you know he was up at the at in Tennessee and he asked me he said hey why don't you go to Israel with me I said I said how much is it and he told me you know eight thousand dollars or something like that you know I said George I think I'll just wait and go over there for free he looked at me and I said you know I'll go over there in the Millennium I won't need an airplane ticket I just traveled like a thought and I said you know what the mosque of Omar is going to be gone because you know it gets blowed up the mosque of Omar is going to be gone really don't care about the thing anyway because it's a Muslim deal and then a Christian Dale I said so I'll just be able to walk over there and I said I'll promise you they won't be an AK-47 pointing at me either they won't be a Palestinian want to wobble bomb at me so I think I'll just waiting on a millennium if y'all want to we'll all just get together we'll have a little tour bus thing we'll just have a tour we'll go through but they literally have a land Israel is promised that square P or not square that long piece of real real estate I'm talking about real land God given that that's their Promised Land see I promise Lance the baptism of all ago and we take it where we go and it didn't cost a dime to get there and it doesn't cost a dime to have it but he promised these people of his a piece of property and that's going to be there forever eternity that's where the new city is brother round said right then when I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and your Idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart so we started with a Stony heart so take it out of your flesh and I'll give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you okay now he's going to give you a what right here is going to give you a new heart and a new spirit that's not the Holy Spirit all right everybody with me that is your sanctification the justification is the new heart you do get a new way listen if if you knew that you had I'm not going to ask for people raise your hands but some people can accumulate parking tickets you know and all kind of stuff so I'm not looking at anybody I'm just I'm just not looking at anybody that's got on a pink top that's sitting next to Boyd um but but we're just family we just confess our sins Regina said leave me alone but you know we accumulate we we accumulate all these things and they're against us and they're against our account and you can't get rid of them you got to go to the forward judge right but what about if it's complete through this what if you could go before the judge and the judge says what are you doing here what sins are you talking about but they don't make you feel so liberated it sure would boys bank accounts that's for sure but it would make you feel we're just family and it would make you feel so lit wouldn't it come on if you had this load of dead on you I don't care what it is XYZ parking tickets I you know what I didn't really remember that but now anyway parking tickets dad of your house you know dead of this dead of sin and you know what it don't just come on you it stays on you that burden stays with you all the time especially parking tickets that you can see the you know the stack stack up like this but you can but you can get free from that you can get free from that go before the judge and say I'm sorry if you'll help me with this right here I won't do it no more if you'll help me with this right here but now God forbid if you help if God helps you with this right here and you do it again right I mean we might do it when I got that load of sin I knew I was XYZ you can put whatever you were XYZ but my XYZ was ever what I did back 20 years in my in my sin in life but to know that God will not ever remember that again man that ought to perk you up that already just that just that not the part where he puts the Holy Ghost Inside and makes you Eternal it's just that part where you say God I got this load of dead on me amen right now it's gone yes he gives you a new spirit to be able to deal with it I'll take away your Stony heart I'll take away your debt I'll take away your load of sin and although it may be simple but let me tell you something if we can't get down to where we we we know that God has forgive us then what did we what did we've been talking about uh brother kindness if you can't forgive sin from your brother God can't forgive you or your parking ticket or whatever it is God can't forgive you that wow so how liberating is that Lord forgive my brother but Lord as I forgive my brother foreign don't forget me don't forget me I'm standing here Lord in need of something to move forward in my life I need you I can't do it but you can I want something to move me forward in my life I want something for you to move forward in don't let the weight of sin what did Paul tell us the way they're saying that what so easily besides us let us run with patience this race it's a lot easier to run without a 50 pound pack on your back amen some of y'all has been in the military boy like rolandre said I mean he'd carry a pack and brother Donnie also and some of you've been in the military they put a 50-pound pack on you is it 50 or more on your back well you've been in Sister Sister Mary bless your heart and and boy when that thing is lifted off of you you feel like you can run another 10 miles and and about that high off the ground why because that load's been lifted off of you let's start unloading remember I told you the quote the other day about the camel brother Ryan said we load that Camel down so much till he's bowlegged he said unload a Christian's supposed to unload listen we're the only ones that know how to unload this world that's why they're crazy they can't unload their burdens it just keeps piling on and piling on and they go over here to get help and that person needs help take they go to this position and find out math physician needs help he's seeing a psychiatrist your psychiatrist is seeing a guy psychiatrist you're in trouble it's like somebody being a divorce counselor and been married three or four times and I will put my spirit within you here's the key he's going to put him eternal life inside of you and listen and once he deposits it in there it can never come out he attaches I like what brother Ernie said we have attached ourselves to the eternal we were not Eternal to begin with our soul was dead but by regeneration and by us giving our heart to God and getting that load of sin out and having that thing cleaned that everything cleaned out of us we have asked the eternal to come inside something that's not eternal and not just not just anoint me Brother John but live in me live in me and I believe that's why brother around that's why one of the things he came to tell us that he said when your hand moved Got Hand moved when your foot moved God's foot moved that's how close it is it's not like Jesus is over there and he's controlling everything no he's inside controlling everything working from the inside out he's still working on me and I will put my spirit within you and cause you there's a Rudder cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them now that was in the Old Testament according to Ezekiel but praise God that same my stood on the damn Pentecost and came into a group of Believers and didn't do away with the Old Testament but brought a new testament in brought Church ages and brought the Gentile age to where now we have a Homeland amen it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost our land is what you're walking in possess ye your soul praise God so justification therefore being justified by faith you got to believe just like I said you got to believe that your sins are gone John 3 16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life do you all know if you read your Bible John 3 is where Jesus says You must be born again John 3 3 when he starts with Nicodemus he gets down to John 3 16 and he just lets her have it he says for God so loved this world until he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life now let me ask you a question brother Brown told us that Nicodemus and gamalia never became bride they but they will be given eternal life for their stand that's what it is right there they might already believed him as as so much as the savior but they believed on him and they should not perish and they were going to get everlasting life for taking their stand with the word of God as much as they can see that's why I said folks we can't we can't say it's me me foreign no more no there's a lot of people going to make it that you probably didn't think was going to make it and there's a lot of people's not going to make it because I'm going to read you if I ever get to it I'm gonna read you one where they come up to Jesus and say have I not cast out devils in your name have I not done Mighty works I just weren't a church pew sitter I preached he said depart from me I never knew you you never let me in your soul you let me in your spirit you let me anoint your flag fully inside your soul you never let me have an intimate relationship with you and boy wow he didn't believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God so when no justification we come to water baptism sanctification now this is where he gives you a new heart and a lot of things happen in sanctification that really puts you toward uh brother Brown says you in other words your name is is put on a book all right then remember it's transferred because judas's name was on the book it was erased it was never transferred as we were talking about uh sister Anna had a question about Judas listen the only thing difference in Judas and us is one thing he didn't make it to Pentecost we know that but there's one thing God knew his heart God knew our heart and God knew the disciples heart so he made it available in that Upper Room for those people to go and receive the Holy Ghost and brother Brown said if if Judas would have made it to Pentecost he was already Justified and Sanctified by the Lord himself but he didn't go on because God knew his heart his heart wasn't heart was a deceiving heart it was deception that's what killed him right so anyway sanctification so he gives you a new heart he gives you a new way brother Brown says one day sometimes he said you were you become a part of a religious order boy you don't want to stay that people you want to be bride you don't want to be a religious order a religious order will put you in hell first Thessalonians says this is the will of God even your sanctification so God wants you to be saying listen he won't dwell in a what unclean vessel for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor Matthew 12 verse 43 says when the unclean Spirit has gone out of a man we've already talked about that that unclean Spirit wants to come back because he feels comfortable we want him to be the most uncomfortable thing in the world we you don't want him back listen if you'll take the washing of the word of the word though he won't come back Satan hates the word he hates it he hates the anointing that goes with the pure word of God now I'm not talking about all this other junk but he hates that he can't stand it he couldn't stand Jesus so when the unclean Spirit has gone out of a man he's walking through Dry places seeks wrath find none then he say I will come into my house see he's even got still control over you my house hmm from whence I came out and when he had come he finally said empty swept and garnished in other words cleaned up then he goes and takes seven more Spirits more wicked than himself and enters in and what dwells there and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation John 17 17 says Jesus praying he says sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth as thou has sent me into the world now watch as thou has sent me into the world even though I even also I have sent them into the world all right like I said many times before he he didn't pray that Lord you take them out of the world he's praying to cover them while they're in the world and for their sake I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth First Corinthians 6 verse 9. do I need to read these again we ever won fit in every one of these search for some of you but you're washed yes amen amen but you're Sanctified you're justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God now let's start this ferment with the birth this is where he says I'll put my spirit I'm not going to say it that low again my spirit and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them Matthew 3 verse 11 this is Jesus speaking I indeed baptize you with water until repent on John speaking but they're reiterating what he's saying I indeed baptize you with water into repentance but he that cometh after me as mightier than I whose shoes I'm not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost comma and with fire what happened on the day of Pentecost little Elixir fire now if we were able to follow that lick of fire because you only got so much commentary that you can write that was written by Luke right Luke wasn't there okay but there's licks of fire over every one of the people well what happened to those licks of fire they didn't just fly out the window they went right down in those people and stayed there and that burning fire stayed with them until they passed away hey you know you got the holy ghost that burning fire that you got when you were born again it's still supposed to be in there John 14 verse 26 but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost now here's Jesus identifying who he is and what he's sending and what he's going to do the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things now that's his job and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you acts 1 verse 4 she's being assembled together with him commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem this is Jesus but wait for the promise of the Father which saith he you have heard of me for John truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence in other words 11 days from there they received the Holy Ghost when they therefore will come together they'd ask of me saying Lord with thou also at this time restore the kingdom to Israel they didn't even know what he's talking about and he said unto them it is not for you to know the time or Seasons which the father had put in his own power look but you shall receive power dunamis Dynamite power that's a word dunamis but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnessing unto me both in Jerusalem Judea Samaria the uttermost parts of the Earth let me ask you a question real quick everybody is an individual if somebody were to one-on-one let's just say somebody walked in off the street and he says and he or she says hey how'd you get what you got you say you got this Holy Ghost you say you've got the new birth how'd you get it could you take them in that room and explain to him your experience if you can't you haven't got that experience brother Brown said tell him how your fire got lit well guess what that's how my fire got lit that's my fire Holy Ghost and Fire yes Acts 2 verse 4 it says they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave him utterance Acts 19 verse 1 is here we go again about being in Paul he says have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe so see as and justification you believe you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ you believe that he took away your sin you believe they took your load off all right then you believed in this understand unto sanctification that he is cleaning you up because listen let me explain something to you that's been explained many times before you hear many people sometimes they say I know I'm born again because I quit smoking I know I'm born again because I quit drinking I don't lust I don't do this I don't do that that's not even got anything to do with the new birth nothing right no you can quit that and be just as black as set in your soul you can Will yourself to quit smoking right you can Will yourself to do a lot of things but when you know that the person that caused you to do them doesn't have a hold on you anymore that's when you know something's happened that's when you know that you that grip please people wake up for a second listen that grip that whatever that was had on you it's a grip and when you're trying to get away from and it's bringing you back you're trying to get away from lusting or drinking you're trying to get and it's going it's a grip it's got it's got gripped up you ever get the new birth that grip that grip will be gone that grip listen that grip will be gone if you get the unclean Spirit out of you but it's got a chance to come back so you can't say uh well listen what brother Ram said you know he said he said he said in a sermon he said you know smoking drinking cussing that's not saying remember that woman asked him afterwards come up to him afterwards and said pray tell brother Brian well I've been told since I was a kid that was Sam said no he's sins unbelief there's only one sin and while you're the reason you're doing all the XYZ is because you don't believe God's strong enough to take it away from you you don't believe you don't have enough faith that you want or might want can't take that away from you how about that are we good I want that grip to be gone Hey listen he's got enough grip on me in the spirit Realm listen he don't stop I didn't say it went away and it never came back I'm just telling you that thing that kept trying to pull you out it's not there anymore now he may try something else he's a good devil he's a good devil he's persistent but if you receive the Holy Ghost since you believed what you believe that's my question to you I'm not asking two thousand years ago I'm asking you now and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost and he said unto them unto what were you baptized and they said John then Paul said John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance now watch he put John in his place John had a Ministry Paul was not denying that John had a Ministry he knew what that Ministry was but he placed it right here all right John barely baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is Christ Jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul laid hands on them the Holy Ghost Came Upon them and they speak with tongues and prophesied Romans 5 verse 5 says in Hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by what by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us Ephesians 4 verse 29 said let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearer and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice be kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake forgive you First Corinthians 2 verse 12 says that we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teaches look comparing spiritual things with spiritual that's what we've been trying to do today all right but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for their foolishness unto him listen religion was foolish when I was in the world I didn't care it was foolish that people had to go to church and people who did this and people did that I come to find out they wanted to for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they're spiritually discerned let's read this right here and then we'll close this is church order 1958. brother Brown says we believe in justification by faith Romans 5 verse 1. we believe that after a person by faith he is with the Lord Jesus Christ but it's possible that this same person could have habits such as drinking smoking and doing things that he should not do filthy habits of the flesh then we believe that the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies this person for the service of the Lord and that we believe in sanctification according to Hebrews 13 12 and 13 where Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate and we believe that sanctification is taught in the New Testament okay listen you couldn't get Sanctified in the Old Testament no you had that same dirty unclean spirit inside of you God was just so gracious to cover that until Christ died knowing your heart Swain you David's heart he knew David didn't want to sin but David didn't have something to take it away and we believe that sanctification is taught in the New Testament and meant for the Believers through the New Testament age which we're now living and we also believe that after the person has been Sanctified unclean habits has gone from that person and he's a Believer on the Lord Jesus Christ and his habits are gone now he's not born again yet though we believe that he is a candidate for the baptism of the Holy Spirit I can't and when the believer is just as many times as I've taught it like picking up a glass out of a chicken yard justification is picking the glass up there's a purpose in God's heart to use it that's what God does to a sinner he's still filthy then he is cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ and the word sanctifies the compound word which means cleaned and set aside for service in the Old Testament the altar Sanctified The Vessel and it was set aside for service we believe that the holy spirit is putting that same vessel in service so the Holy Ghost is what is putting you in service it's making you a living breathing instrumentality or a temple of the Holy Ghost and then next Wednesday night we'll talk about anointings because after that we got if we're born again then then everything after that is a growth development all right let's stand our feet it's anointings it's things that we need like gifts of the Spirit like the nine spiritual gifts and all those different things we need those that is part of your Christian Journey but and it's given to you but you don't know how to use it everybody with me because Paul says Desiring the sensory milk of the word that what we may grow thereby know how to use those anointings because remember power without character it's satanic we need that anointing obviously we need it but it can anoint you and you'll be lost as lost can be but listen but Power with character virtues with the Holy Ghost God can use you he absolutely can use you listen we've been used by the devil long enough pray for me if it's not y'all we have been used by the devil long enough let's turn some of that effort over to let God use us open yourself up and say God Here I Am Lord send me that voice kept calling his name he just finally was Isaiah he said Here I Am Lord send me Jeremiah I Sanctified you before you come out of your mama because I know what you're going to do when you get here you're going to help me condemn this whole nation of Israel and you're going to help me call the people out so what's happening now the Lord Jesus knows there's a group of people that he's called out to call a people out to grow and get bigger learn more teach me Lord to wait you know why you need to be taught sing a song but the Holy Ghost is the most important thing you'll ever get in your life nothing else is the most important but that once you get that get up and walk with God let's sing a song God bless you born again [Music] born again and just like Jesus said [Music] the glory of the Lord amen about three years ago of redoing some Modern remodeling in the kitchen so I'm putting this kitchen cabinets up my brother wanted to do it for me and it's it I could see that when you do things whatever you need to do you need to be your Revelation at least to know what you're doing and know what's happening and that the cabinet I kept looking at Master these cabinets they're not stable they're gonna fall off the wall because they're all right they're all right just little just leave them there Thursday Friday I was in the kitchen fixing some cheese toast and I looked up in the cabinets about this far from my head and I was able to Push It Away by the power of God I'm not that fast it's not that strong right right but I was able to push in this only got scratches them all from here down to my wrist temporarily and it brushed my chin and the side of my head but it didn't skin this uh nothing that didn't right I wear a plate to knock it kind of loose but the thing about it is when you know what you know you got to live by and so when we come to church we come to work to live the rain to understand what is real and what is true if you don't get the revelation of what's real anything can happen to you that's right and I I realized that he want to redo my cabinets again I told him no I don't know what it cost to get them done but I want somebody to do it they know what they're doing yeah so we're coming to church and we're here preaching oh we want somebody to know what they're preaching that's right and if if if they're if they don't have a revelation they can't give you one that's right and he didn't know he didn't know he was doing the cabinets there was a bit off with me putting them up until he was sending the flow at least they wouldn't have crushed my head almost so I I just want to say I'm trying to follow the lord and that's the way I want things to be done everything according to God is real and just keep going and keep reading the Bible the prophet's message and so I I do I try to read a lot sometimes things get I get sleepy reading at home too but I go back and read it God's word is real and time as you look around us it's very short it just irriting the prophecy it would happen is taking place and so we just got to do that and that's all I just wanted to say I thank the Lord that everything came out all right yes and so just pray for me amen amen yeah I find me another cabinet maker somebody knew what is doing let's say born again [Music] born again just like Jesus said yes Lord amen no because of calvary I'm so glad that I've been born again oh born again changing me born again just like Jesus said [Music] I'm born again all because of calvary oh I'm so glad that I've been born again [Music] born again there's really been a change in me

got to make yourself available for that truth that has that problem no we got a church full of them and we got a church full of Believers though that are believing with everyone else brothers and sisters you're never alone as long as I'm standing here you'll never be alone as long as some of our brothers and sisters are out there you'll never be alone don't you think Satan is gonna he's gonna cut you from The Herd that's his job the wolf's job is to cut you from The Herd because if you stay in the herd he's not going to bother you but if he ever Cuts you from the herd don't let him cut you from the herd you stay glued into this you stay plugged in to the deacons and elders and different ones here that can help you don't ever get away from us amen stay right here I'll go through the same things you go through you go through the same we got people win all perfect that's for sure that's right but we got a perfect God that we can just listen to what he says but don't ever tell the devil don't ever let the devil tell you that you're alone no one's listening I want him to listen to what I'm fixing to say boo boo boo devil I want you to listen to me if you're gonna be here you're gonna listen boo these people will you're a winner either way I don't care you bring all your lists the troubles you want to we'll pray for every one of them but the devil is gonna have to back up to the bride he has no power Jesus said I'll give you power watch the Holy Ghost come upon you he never gave that power to the devil he gave that a devil an anointing sure but he never gave him power the power is in his bride and he's transferred it from us from him to us you got to believe that and you're not alone I promise you you're not alone [Music] know that you're born again now that you know if somebody tells you you're not probably going to be the devil okay because even God's positive enough to say hey if you'll hang around here long enough I won't birth you I'm not gonna lose you I'm not gonna lose you the devil would love to lose you but God will never lose you he'll never leave you and never forsake you you love the Lord let's bow our heads to Heavenly Father Lord thank you for
