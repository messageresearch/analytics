TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign God bless you thanks it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning we're still continuing on in Hebrews 12. I just want to kind of set the stage with this scripture to get things started this morning let's bow our heads Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather together this morning and look into your word as we study these things out I pray Lord that your lord just minister to the needs of the people Lord God and give us something Lord and encourage us and edifice Lord and build up our faith that we can believe A Little Bit Stronger Lord every step we take Closer to You Lord pray God that you'll just be your brother wait as he's study and prepared and open our hearts door to to receive the word that you have for us today we ask this blessing in your name now Psalm uh of course just to set the stage for Hebrews 12 14 and 15 that we're kind of looking at um and I just really want to speak on contentment this morning just about what contentment means because a lot of times we were we were talking last Sunday about how unrealistic expectations kind of fuel bitterness and so forth and and all of that kind of comes from a place of where you're not you're not satisfied you're not content with who you are and your relationship with God and you know you look at this picture of the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want with with the shepherd watching over the sheep and um you know if you're if you're just relying if you're in a place where you have confidence that your Shepherd is watching over you um you know that'll bring a place of contentment I think sometimes we as going through life we kind of forget we we rely so much on the opinions of others and the opinions of even ourselves or what we think about ourself that we forget that there's a God that's Watching Over Us and really when we come to church and we gather together we we what we're really trying to do is we're trying to please God as long as God is satisfied that's all that matters and that's maybe my point is as long as God is the one that's pleased you know when we're if he's pleased by the preaching of the word he's pleased by our attitudes if he's pleased by everything that we do then that's all that matters because we've got a Shepherd that's Watching Over Us um you know this is what uh I just kind of read this little scripture from First Corinthians chapter four this is what Paul was trying to express to the Corinthians when they they kind of were some of them began to have favorites that they they began to look at Paul and Apollos and Peter and say well I think I think maybe Peter has a little bit more uh he he's his motives are better he's got better motives and maybe Paul does or maybe I like Paul Apollos the way he can kind of spin the word out in a way that is maybe easier for me to grasp and look at what Paul said he said this is how one should regard us as Servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God moreover it is required of stewards that be found they be found faithful but with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human core now look at look to the way that Paul is kind of framing the way that he looks at things he's he's he he said it's a small thing that I should be judged by your opinion in fact I did not even judge myself now isn't that true that sometimes our our own opinions of ourselves can be can be elevated or be too critical that sometimes I mean you look at you look at the way that even people that have left the message their opinion of themselves is wrong because they if they really were comparing themselves with the word they would see that they didn't match up with the words you see sometimes our opinions of ourselves as even even off the mark but what the opinion that matters is God's opinion of us he's saying with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human Court in fact that I do not even judge myself for I am not aware of anything against myself but I am not thereby acquitted just because I'm not aware of anything within myself doesn't mean that I'm Guiltless it's the Lord It's the Lord's opinion who matters his his opinion is the one that matters therefore judge nothing before the time don't be quick to judge somebody's motives or their character or something before just give it a little bit of time until the Lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the councils of the hearts and then shall every man have Praise of God so we're talking about contentment this morning and talking about judging and last time we were talking about really if you really want to be able to understand things and understand one another and understand how things work is first you must first understand yourself and that's what Jesus was talking about when he said this this one of the most misunderstood scriptures in the Bible maybe maybe as we read this think about do you do you what do you think this scripture means as we read it in Matthew chapter 7 he said judge not that ye be not judged now a lot of times we'll think we'll think well that means that we we can't discern right from wrong because Jesus said judge not that you be not judge that's not what this is saying is saying judge yourself first judge yourself first before you uh and let's let's read this and see what see what he says for with what judgment you judge you shall be judged now think of it as a big spotlight when you start to judge somebody else the spotlight turns on you because if you say someone is guilty now the spotlight is turned on you and everybody not just God but every let's say maybe you're sitting at a table and you begin to point out somebody's faults all of a sudden the spotlight is turned on you to expose whether you are guilty of the same thing that you are speaking of judge not that ye be not judged for with what judgment you judge ye shall be judged and with what measure you meet it shall be measured to you again and why behold us thou the moat that is in thy brother's eye but considers not the beam that is in thine own eye or how will thou say to thy brother let me pull out the mode out of thine eye and behold a beam is in thine own eye thou hypocrite First cast out the beam out of thine old eye and then Thou shalt See Clearly to cast out the mood out of thy brother's eye now look what he's talking about casting something out I think it's called in my mind just right now in this moment that um I'm thinking of a brother at another church that was delivered of pornography addiction years ago and now as a minister now you could say well he's not guilty of looking at pornography now but he has because he went through that experience now he's better positioned to be able to cash that thing out of of young people and that's what you see when he'll um be standing in a prayer line he has that he has that special burden as somebody comes through the prayer line to when somebody's Afflicted with that pornography addiction to be able to deal with that in a special way now there's somebody that's they're not looking at they're able to judge fairly and correctly because they've been delivered in the same way that you know if if you haven't been if you don't haven't really been uh if you've never received a real relationship with God and haven't been to that been to that burning bush like Moses typed how are you able to help somebody that has not been themselves you you gotta see if you're judge yourself first and then you're then you're able to help somebody else now now that's what uh in Hebrews chapter 12 it says follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God grace of God lest any root of bitterness bringing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled now there's how that we were examining this last last Sunday how does bitterness spring up bitterness Springs up when it it all comes down to your perception of your how the way that you're looking at things in the church and your relationships at yourself it all comes down to unrealistic expectations our premeditated resentment now let's kind of level set for that second when we come to church we have great expectations of God I he's he owns the cattle on a thousand hills so we can have an expectation that God is going to meet our need brother random even say when you come to church you you have you're going to get what you expect you can come with a critical mindset or you can come expect it I'm going to get a blessing today because God is God is going to meet his promise when if God promised something and you come with according to the prescription you can come with confidence that God is going to meet your expectation but you got to remember that we're all human so we we need to level set our expectations of one another now that's what this is talking about let's go through some examples when we hold rigid and unrealistic expectations of others or situations we set ourselves up for disappointment and resentment when those expectations are not met it's natural to have certain expectations in life we should approach them with flexibility understanding and Grace so what what this is talking about is sometimes you just got to let things roll off your back sometimes you just gotta say oh well now now if if some of y'all know me a little bit more y'all know that's one of my the things that I like to say is like something happens and you oh well and brother Louise back there he'll say well you'll have that that's you know sometimes you just gotta somebody says something a little bit unexpected something strange happens all right oh well that's life we just keep rolling on and let's look at some things what it's unrealistic to expect that you will get constant praise and admiration now see how and as an adult it will be unrealistic for you to come to church and to constantly expect someone to praise you to praise me after every Sunday school lesson brother Bob that was a wonderful Sunday school lesson well that's you know it's great to get past On The Backs but it would be unrealistic to expect that ever every time you preach or every time you sing a song or every time you it's your birthday or whatever and you see how this flows down into parenting as well as a parent you you've got to set you're setting your kids up so that they so that they don't have those kind of unrealistic expectations because it's unrealistic for them to go to school and everybody's constantly patting them on the back because they they ran a race but they didn't win and they're they're getting a prize it's unrealistic and you see what happens when you've got those unrealistic expectations and you go into a situation and those expectations aren't met then you start getting bitter you start getting bitter because of my maybe you know uh I I remember somebody telling me about a preacher that went to a church and was a really big church and and lo and behold he didn't he didn't get invited to preach well he had unrealistic expectations that just because he was there that he would get invited to preach you gotta you gotta kind of set set your expectations realistically that just because you're there everybody's not going to pour praise and admiration on you and tell you that you're the greatest thing in the world it's unrealistic to expect that and so and it's important to experience constructive feedback and learn how to handle both positive and negative evaluations it's unrealistic to for a child to go on the playground and expect that everybody will run up to them and want to play exactly the same way that they want to do it's unrealistic for me as I'm preaching to expect that everybody will have the same background the same thought processes and look at things the same way and you see that's where that's where bitterness comes from it's only realistic to expect special treatment or entitlement that belief that you or your child should always receive preferential treatment or special privileges fairness and equality are essential values in society it's unrealistic to expect that that you'll be protected from all negative influences how we how we do sometimes we we just kind of uh it shocks us when something negative happens when somebody tells us something that we don't like or especially when somebody tells one of our children something that they don't like like uh I I just kind of been meditating on how uh there's a quote where Jordan Peterson says it's amazing how how horrible people can be to one another and I've been meditating on as I've looked kind of uh looking into these things about really how horrible young people can be to one another you look at uh I I uh somebody was sharing me with me recently about how a young person they had actually a lot of these young people they go to camps and everything and they start getting bad feelings toward one another and a group of young people actually started a whole chat group so that they could Mock and and poke at somebody and you think about all the things that that people go through you you can't but you can't go through life expecting that these things will not happen you got to go through with realistic expectations because the way to combat that the way to combat these these negative things that people say and constant poking is to be content with your situation that's what I'm talking about this morning to be content that Paul said or James said what causes fights and quarrels among you don't they come from your desires that battle within you you desire but do not have so you kill you cover but you cannot get what you want so you quarrel and fight you do not have because you've done that do not ask God when you ask you do not receive because you ask with wrong motives and so on and so forth it's those desires bitterness that comes and Jehovah Jireh or brother I'm saying we know that a seed when it falls in the right kind of ground not upon rocks with no root nor in thorns and thistles that would soon choke it out but in good Rich fertile Faith every seed will bring forth of its kind and we know that every seed or promise of God will bring forth of his kind what it promised if it strikes the right ground the ground that's prepared ready all the Rocks has been thrown out and The Roots and the bitterness and selfishness and indifference and jealousy has all been grouped out that root of bitterness that Springs up that sometimes so spoils the thing that God is trying to do and I'll tell you it's bitterness bitterness will start when somebody who are you taking a little kid and they're having a conversation and one kid says well why is your face so round or why is your face so long or just starts poking and stuff and all that'll start something will have to start happening start making fun of one another oh but there's what I'm what I'm talking about is there's an antidote for all those things you because you've got to come to you've got to come to a place like Jesus where somebody can say something to you and it doesn't affect you if something affects you when somebody says something it shows there's something a little bit spiritually off if something vibrates there's something off kilter you've got to come to a place where it doesn't affect you because you know you got a shepherd and he's got your back and he's watching over you I'm speaking something that'll help you this morning let's let's look at let's look at all these stages of bitterness first off is you somebody said something hurtful something that you're just like why what what is going on and it starts starts bitterness growing it turns into resentment rumination where you're just thinking about it every day until you're holding this big grudge and then finally now this is where Boolean comes from now you're trying to manipulate others you're trying to poke and and make fun of the way that they look oh that's what bullying is and making fun of somebody because they're sick something that they can't help the way that they they've got a limp and they can't walk right something maybe they're you feel like there's they they uh they're somebody a young person feels like somebody else is um different than they are so they're going to poke at that thing to try to control the situation because you don't feel that you're controlling control of your own life so you can try to control the relationships through bullying and manipulation until it escalates on into hurtful Behavior where you're spreading rumors and gossip and self-harm I I I I I I oh you could preach all day about the things that young people go through where another story that is coming to my mind right now is this um a young person what they'll do is they'll they'll get online as Anonymous and then they'll start dragging one another through the mud and you won't know who it is who is that and they'll start spreading rumors and gossip and and horrible things about one another now that's you know that's one thing when it's a child but let that person grow on up if they're if it's not corrected or something before long it's an adult that's behaving the same way and that's that's terrible that is terrible so what we got to do is be content be content with who we are that's what this gospel is for to be content with who you are and who God has made to know that you've got a God that's watching over the situation and that same God that was able to correct you is able to correct your brother in Philippians chapter four he said not that I speak in respect of want for I have learned and whatsoever State I am therewith to be content now this is another artificial intelligence generated image I just asked it to make me a picture of a good Holiness sister that's content with herself look at what brother what Paul is saying about this now he said I know both how to be a beast now can we say that same thing about it I know how to be in a bad situation and I know how to abound I know how to be in a good situation I know in my mind how to approach that situation so that I'm not lifted up within myself or I'm not looking at things off kilter that I'm just wherever I am whatever state I am I'm content now now I I know maybe this is what might seem a little bit boring or whatever but this is one of the greatest blessings that you can get from the baptism the Holy Ghost to be happy if all you've got now what maybe happy is the wrong word because happy can come from external situations and whatever I'm not talking about happy where one day you're happy and one day you're sad I'm talking about that's inner state of joy that is just constant amen if you're laying in a hospital bed it's constant you're it's there if you're if you're up on the Mountaintop it's there if you're down in the valley it's there that's what I'm talking about he said I know both how to be a beast and I know how to abound everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need now there's there's a there's real Christian character on display where you've got all the bitterness rooted out you got all that jealousy root oh that that would make a good study what jealousy is brother Adam said jealousy comes from Satan and jealous is that can well you can identify that when you begin to compare yourself with others oh but God don't want you to compare yourself with others just look at the word and be content with what the word says about you when you can begin to identify yourself with the word and that will give you confidence of where you are positionally in Christ that you've got a god who's watching over you and and that will mold your character into a place where you don't poke and you don't hurt and you don't say hurtful things into a character where other people can look at you and see a real Christian character is what it's all about that's why brother Adam said power apart from character is satanic but Power with with character is fit to rule you ever think about that you think you go to Walmart and you see a manager at Walmart and a lot of times the employees maybe they got cancer and they can I get some time off and power without character they're a man they're a manager over people but they don't have any character so no you gotta you gotta be in here tomorrow but I got I'm dealing with cancer oh my mom just died or whatever but they have no character so power without character is satanic look at all these quotes where people down through history have talked about character Abraham Lincoln said nearly all men can stand adversity but if you want to test a man's carriage or give him power Lord Acton said power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely you know you can see that even in the workplace look look at your boss do they have a real character are they are they kind and forgiving or you know I'm I'm speaking even outside of Christianity or when you when you ask for time off or or have a problem in your life Booker T Washington said character not circumstances makes the man and George Washington said happiness and moral duty are inseparably connected Aristotle said character maybe May almost be called the most effective means of persuasion in other words if you want to persuade somebody to be a Christian put your life on display where somebody can see your character the way that you treat other people that's what he's talking the way that you the way that you're willing to help the way that you're willing to go pick up chairs and move around their character on display brother William said that you and the unity of one God and the one church he said these signs shall follow Believers not negative thinkers not intellectual church members but born again Believers who's come from the intellectual to the heart where God takes throne and his control room to control your emotions to control your faith to control your character and the message life he said now the Christian church should have a real character then and if the Life of Christ is in the Church of Christ then it's God to have the character of Christ it'll produce the Life of Christ it's just no more than just what we call in the South Common Sense if the life of the spirit of Christ is in the church it has to produce that life because the life that's in you makes your character now you see you see what the statute of perfect man really is about when you're born again now your position to believe the faith of God is in you but now the character starts pushing out to make you like Christ what does that look like Christian characters love and joy and peace and patience and kindness and goodness and faithfulness and gentleness and self-control and humility and forgiveness and honesty and generosity and servanthood and obedience and compassion and contentment and courage and modesty and steadfastness and you can go on and on and on as you look for the things that reflect Jesus Christ in you brother Ram said in the mighty conqueror he said many times that people judge people by the way they dress or by their stature man is not judged by how big he is and how strong his muscles man's judged by character and character alone I've seen men that weighed 200 pounds that didn't have an ounce of man about them man is judged by character what he is in his heart and Christ was not judged by physical strength but he was judged by character and in time-tested Memorials of God he said you see a man's character is made known by his works whatever you are your Works prove what you are no matter how much you testify whatever you say Pro or con that has nothing to do with it your Works tell what you are tell us what you are inside every job that you do manifests what you are and you businessmen if you just do a patched up job see what I mean just a halfway job don't do that if you can't do it right don't do it at all that's right when you come to Christ if you can't absolutely sell out Lock Stock and Barrel and come to Christ don't come at all but when you really want to be a Christian Stand Out make it real that's what God wants you to be and that'll prove your Works will prove what your character is your character is known by The Works that you do so let's be content and brother Brown said in believer style this he said and he came to this world as my example and he came as your example to just be content with such as we have and Luke chapter 3 it says and the soldiers likewise demanded of him saying and what shall we do and he said unto them do violence to no man neither accuse any falsely and be content with your wages that's one thing I've even noticed at work no matter how much it seems like people make how much more money you give somebody it's like they never are content people just it's so hard to be content with what you got in Philippians chapter 3 not that I speak in respect of want for I have learned and whatsoever State I am there with to be content and Hebrews 13 5 let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have for he hath said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee now think about that let your conversation be without covetousness without any bitterness without any jealousy that comes from not being content with who you are God wants you to be content God wants you to be satisfied if you've got a personal relationship with God it doesn't matter what people say to you or what people's opinions are of you because you've got a father that's got your back and you know where you come from oh that's I I think that you think of those stories that brother Adam said told us as we close about like like the little Eagle that he saw as he was went out into the Wilderness with a little squirrel chattering away telling telling that eagle the days of Miracles are passed and you think about all the things that the devil can say and maybe maybe even the devil through different people or whatever as they come and tell you things well well you're not even really a Christian or you're not even this or whatever but oh you've got to rise above that to where you can be like that eagle and just spread your wings and fly away while that squirrel Chatters away that's real contentment where you can rest upon what God has said God bless you we'll stop right there [Applause]
