[22:09] knowledge of him that hath called us to
[22:11] glory and virtue whereby are given unto
[22:15] us exceeding great and precious promises
[22:17] what that by these these promises the
[22:20] prophet emphasiz it you might be
[22:22] partakers of the divine nature all right
[22:27] we gave it this morning morning a quote
[22:28] from the prophet where he was saying you
[22:30] come into the body of Christ then you
[22:32] have the divine nature okay all right

[23:11] they make you that you shall neither be
[23:13] Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[23:16] of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be
[23:19] seated the Lord had his Blessing to the
[23:21] reading of the
[23:23] word now
[23:26] to background just a little bit from
[23:29] this morning and then move on into what
[23:32] we're trying to
[23:33] bring
[23:36] uh we have been talking about the
[23:38] stature of a perfect
[23:39] man all right as I was saying this
[23:42] morning just to the background apart to
[23:44] those that hadn't wasn't here to hear it
[23:47] what uh there is two thoughts in the
[23:52] stature of a perfect man and the
[23:54] Believers of the message one group
[23:56] believes I get everything when want to
[23:58] believe you know I got it all today I
[24:00] was born again the other group says well
[24:02] we ain't got it yet well you know both
[24:05] of them got truth right you know that's
[24:08] right sure you do get a lot when you're
[24:12] born again but you do need a lot to be
[24:14] where the disciples were that's all I've
[24:17] tried to say to you because that way
[24:19] Peter can tell you you must have these
[24:23] things brother Bon says these are the
[24:25] things that God expects you to have amen
[24:28] he expects you to have these things all
[24:30] right because they're provided now watch
[24:33] that in the message today now I want you
[24:36] to when I get down to the end of it I'm
[24:38] I don't even know which way I'm going
[24:40] and if I'm in two hours okay I'll be
[24:42] that don't want to do that but I'm going
[24:45] to get to a point that we're going to
[24:47] have to make some outstanding statements
[24:51] that I believe will be helpful to us in
[24:55] the understanding of the message M all
[24:58] right like I told you the other day you
[25:01] look at the pyramid back here behind me
[25:03] as the drawing the one brother randam
[25:05] made of the drawing it says faith virtue
[25:09] knowledge Temperance patience brotherly
[25:12] kindness you know godliness brotherly
[25:14] kindness the Holy Spirit and then says
[25:18] love well Peter doesn't say
[25:22] that Peter says faith virtue knowledge
[25:24] temp patient godliness brotherly
[25:27] kindness
[25:28] and
[25:29] love now why would brother random draw
[25:31] it that
[25:34] way because it has to fit perfectly with
[25:37] what he's saying that's right right all
[25:39] right so he draw it that way now let's
[25:41] get down to that to think about it you
[25:43] said well that's just intellectual smart
[25:45] addict things because you can look at it
[25:46] well why didn't your intellect smart
[25:48] addict come up with it and tell me about
[25:50] it you know you you're playing with me
[25:52] I'm playing with
[25:54] you see I'm just saying that
[25:58] those
[25:59] things they have a big meaning to you
[26:01] and I
[26:03] right and they have a place to be placed
[26:07] and when we get down to the last part of
[26:08] the message I want to read you something
[26:10] your Prophet
[26:13] said you mind if I just quote a little
[26:15] bit
[26:17] now he said in Sister Shepherd's
[26:21] dream he said there was a big man pourn
[26:26] water into this Rock Box
[26:32] yep and he said that's the Holy
[26:35] Spirit and he said the meas of this age
[26:38] is the big guy that's pouring the
[26:40] water now you know all about it don't
[26:43] you let's go
[26:46] home no we need some understanding don't
[26:50] we Simplicity of understanding why these
[26:54] things are like
[26:56] this and then the realize that there's
[26:58] no other way that it could be
[27:03] said there is no other way that it could
[27:07] be said if it was God would have said
[27:09] it and he sent a prophet to declare that
[27:12] unto us I thought we believe that the
[27:14] messenger of this
[27:16] age was to bring
[27:18] us the
[27:20] message for the age and the end at all
[27:23] things okay now so when we get down to
[27:26] it
[27:28] we'll talk about it all right now this
[27:30] morning we talked about it cuz I said
[27:32] we've been covering the stature of a
[27:34] perfect man and why would Peter say to
[27:37] add these things if we already had them
[27:39] so this scale Lo runs off to say that we
[27:42] already had all of this that scale runs
[27:44] off because it says you know we already
[27:47] got it well then Peter says to add it
[27:49] yeah right well then this scale says we
[27:53] don't have it I'm talking about the
[27:55] Believers of the message people we don't
[27:58] have it like the book of Acts well
[28:00] there's some truth there right there's
[28:03] some truth there go along with it but
[28:07] then there's more truth too where your
[28:10] Prophet would say and we'll read it in a
[28:11] minute again where he says he met people
[28:14] with the Holy Ghost just exactly like
[28:16] the day of
[28:18] Pentecost well that's his wording
[28:23] see well you you say well I don't
[28:25] understand that well I guess that means
[28:26] it's wrong
[28:29] you know you know you said I don't
[28:31] understand that that does that mean it's
[28:34] wrong are you sensible enough to say I
[28:36] don't understand
[28:39] it but see then why are we so uh hard
[28:43] about people who say they do understand
[28:46] something and talk about it that's
[28:47] intellect let's see your intellect do
[28:50] it I no problem I'm not sarcastic you
[28:54] think I am you think I'm a hateful old
[28:56] dude no I'm serious serious my soul is
[28:58] involved
[29:00] am you know we're here at the end of the
[29:02] world we've had 50 years since the going
[29:05] way of a
[29:07] prophet
[29:09] right all right see you know why not get
[29:13] down and think about
[29:15] things okay now you can't jump WR I
[29:18] remember this I remind you of ever
[29:20] service you got an order it's Faith
[29:23] virtue knowledge Temperance Faith you
[29:25] can't go Faith knowledge patience
[29:28] brotherly kindness and shoot
[29:30] off you got to go the way God ordains it
[29:33] to be am I don't care what you
[29:37] think that has nothing to do with it
[29:40] it's what the word says all right then
[29:42] your Prophet would say you can't do
[29:45] these other things and jump about he
[29:47] said because each one of these virtues
[29:49] is vulcanized together that's right amen
[29:52] and he said if it don't come out to the
[29:53] right place he said it'll crumble and
[29:55] fall yep amen
[29:57] well you just go ahead well I well I've
[29:59] got I've got knowledge well I remember
[30:02] own Blasphemous names referring to the
[30:05] statute of perfect man he said when our
[30:08] mental faith and he said the biggest
[30:09] force of our faith is mental he said
[30:11] becomes a spiritual Revelation then you
[30:14] add it remember we're talking about
[30:16] Revelation we're not talking about just
[30:17] building this or a pyramid or a thought
[30:20] or a this we're talking about what has
[30:22] happened as to Christianity in our ways
[30:27] all right
[30:27] so then you don't just jump up the
[30:29] ladder and go from one to you got to go
[30:31] as W it goes you go Faith the new
[30:35] birth then you add virtue
[30:38] strength
[30:40] right then you can come up to
[30:43] knowledge but you can't go from Faith
[30:46] straight to knowledge I didn't draw the
[30:50] book you know what I didn't write
[30:53] it
[30:55] okay and if these things are required
[30:57] then why not talk about it that's right
[31:00] right of course are you in this group we
[31:02] got everything when well I don't really
[31:03] believe we got everything when to
[31:04] believe but I kind of believe I got
[31:06] everything by
[31:08] now well praise God I hope
[31:11] so you know I mean I hope so no problem
[31:16] I'm hoping that's right but now what
[31:18] does it do then then we come on up Faith
[31:21] virtue
[31:23] knowledge to know the word don't
[31:26] contradict
[31:29] Temperance how to control your temper oh
[31:33] but when I got born again I a had no
[31:35] temper yeah according to Peter you lied
[31:39] yeah now you're going to answer to God
[31:42] about that of saying okay that was good
[31:45] cuz it did take away a lot of things
[31:47] it's supposed to take away a lot more
[31:48] than we need cuz remember Temperance is
[31:50] how to control your temper and you mean
[31:52] God has brought us from the New Birth up
[31:55] through virtue knowledge and temper and
[31:57] then we still got I mean knowledge and
[32:00] then we still got a temper
[32:03] yeah I didn't write the
[32:06] book and then we got to have
[32:09] patience
[32:13] patience God didn't expect you to have
[32:16] patience when you were first born again
[32:19] right he didn't expect you to have
[32:21] knowledge he didn't expect you to have
[32:25] virtue he expected you to be a baby
[32:28] right and like I've always said babies
[32:30] are born babies but they don't have the
[32:33] virtues of a child
[32:36] correct they grow into these things so
[32:39] is it in the body of Christ we must grow
[32:43] into this and each one as you grow
[32:45] upward then see and then coming on up
[32:48] through
[32:49] patience and then godliness and I didn't
[32:52] write the book brother brandham said it
[32:54] you come up to
[32:56] hear
[32:57] before God expects
[33:00] you to be like God or godliness then he
[33:04] goes to Matthew 5:48 right immediately
[33:07] in the same paragraph that he starts
[33:09] about it go read your book he said be
[33:12] therefore perfect he said you've come
[33:15] all of this way before God expects you
[33:16] to be
[33:18] perfect I didn't write the book but see
[33:23] then we got to come to perfect of
[33:25] godliness and to understand now listen
[33:28] to what I'm saying because you you you
[33:30] sometimes I know I don't bring it
[33:33] out I try but see I'm talking about a
[33:38] revelation of
[33:41] things virtue is just not to have manly
[33:45] strength you know
[33:47] right it's to have Holy Ghost virtue
[33:51] amen Holy Ghost knowledge Holy Ghost
[33:53] Temperance Holy Ghost
[33:55] patience and what is that
[33:58] God revealing himself to you that's as
[34:02] to try to make us to be the children
[34:06] that he desires us to be just as you do
[34:09] in your natural
[34:11] children you see we come up to there
[34:13] then it's required that be therefore
[34:15] perfect it's required to understand
[34:17] Perfection the brother this morning said
[34:20] why don't
[34:22] people if he hears this I'm not going to
[34:25] call his name but he ain't been in the
[34:27] message long and he caught
[34:29] something he said why is it people can't
[34:32] understand what it is to be
[34:36] perfect you see it on the bumper sticker
[34:39] right I'm not perfect I'm just forgiven
[34:43] oh everybody oh wonderful
[34:46] statement is
[34:48] it if you're forgiven you're perfect
[34:52] right cuz you're not guilty right right
[34:56] mhm amen and the brother he what he said
[34:58] he said why don't people catch
[35:01] it he said God said it right and if God
[35:04] said it he required it amen and then
[35:07] when are we going to start talking about
[35:08] it he said that's right
[35:12] okay but
[35:15] listen then you come out of this way
[35:17] before brotherly kindness ever comes
[35:18] into a
[35:21] point you remember that this morning so
[35:23] we're backing up to there now see
[35:25] brotherly kindness comes into view
[35:28] after you've
[35:29] added to your faith virtue knowledge
[35:32] Temperance Pati godliness and then
[35:35] you're expected to have brotherly
[35:39] kindness see what brotherly kindness
[35:41] would be way back down here to the
[35:43] bottom he might not be talking about the
[35:46] brotherly kindness you're talking
[35:49] about because I see hit her to the end
[35:51] and stop this morning but we want to
[35:53] continue the thought all right but it's
[35:57] on paragraph 296 through 303 statute of
[36:01] a perfect man he says you get got all
[36:04] the way up here before you're asked to
[36:08] be perfect in other words for you're
[36:10] asked to have godliness for you're asked
[36:13] to have brotherly
[36:14] kindness now remember the quote we gave
[36:16] this morning brother Brandon said having
[36:19] brotherly kindness he said we can have
[36:20] brotherly kind but he said it's hard to
[36:22] have it in a group
[36:25] right
[36:28] that's in the message it's hard to have
[36:30] it in a group CU you see some people
[36:33] have brotherly
[36:35] kindness but evidently something more
[36:37] about brotherly kindness that we're not
[36:39] really
[36:41] following like I said this morning oh we
[36:43] wonderful we can figure it all out cu we
[36:46] just look at the pyramid Philadelphia
[36:48] that's a six Church a brotherly
[36:52] kindness now according to brother
[36:55] brandom
[36:59] sorry according to brother brandham
[37:02] brotherly kindness goes into lady
[37:05] ofia well I can't see that cuz Lady of
[37:07] sea means people
[37:10] oh Lady of sea means people's
[37:15] rights we don't want that do we
[37:18] brotherly kindness is what this age is
[37:20] required you remember I told you the
[37:22] brother that came by Brother Mo was
[37:24] preaching on it and he said he said
[37:26] don't tell about it so let me go study
[37:27] it 6 months later I'm kidding you he
[37:29] came back by and he preached that the
[37:31] Rapture was going to take place in the
[37:34] sixth Church age because it said
[37:36] Philadelphia and Philadelphia means
[37:38] brotherly love that wasn't that a great
[37:44] Revelation why would it be that this age
[37:46] would be called brotherly
[37:51] kindness I'm asking you a simple
[37:54] question I love questions
[37:58] right we have good time at questions and
[37:59] answers we just sit around and talk and
[38:02] have a wonderful time I love questions
[38:04] and that you know sometimes I like to
[38:06] ask
[38:08] questions well how come that your sixth
[38:11] Church age being Philadelphia would not
[38:13] be called the brotherly kindness
[38:19] age but the seventh Church
[38:22] age which would mean people's
[38:25] rights
[38:29] brotherly kindness is
[38:32] required
[38:36] why for go before God expects us to have
[38:40] godliness he waits for us to come you
[38:43] remember patience God has patience
[38:45] waiting on you and I remember
[38:47] that he has patience throughout the
[38:50] pyramid and he comes and brings it to
[38:53] Godliness and then he says for us to be
[38:55] perfect
[38:57] all right how can we start the fact of
[38:59] being perfect by revelation of the blood
[39:02] of Jesus
[39:04] Christ now so you see that you're
[39:07] getting now required something brotherly
[39:10] kindness is not just a uh an act of
[39:15] kindness
[39:19] amen it is a
[39:21] revelation amen of what the blood of
[39:24] Jesus Christ does
[39:27] for individuals who will receive it
[39:32] amen
[39:34] right you've already been told you're
[39:36] perfect who told us we're perfect who
[39:38] told us I'm saying something way ahead
[39:41] so you just listen to this and remember
[39:43] that a while who told us the
[39:45] understanding of the correct way to be
[39:49] perfect now get off of it I read too you
[39:53] read when we was in the Baptist the
[39:54] Methodist Presbyterian pent costal
[39:57] Catholics we read in the Baptist Church
[40:00] I knew the word perfect did not relate
[40:04] to sinl it related to growth development
[40:08] because I could look up the
[40:12] word and the first Bible I had was a
[40:14] scofi if you go L to Matthew 5:48 you
[40:17] got a scofi Bible look right down below
[40:19] and you'll see that he tells you it does
[40:22] not mean sinless it means a growth
[40:25] development
[40:27] but the main thing of what I'm talking
[40:28] about who was the one to bring the
[40:30] Revelation to this
[40:32] age we talked about the blood of Jesus
[40:35] Christ making us perfect as
[40:37] denominational people
[40:39] right that was preached it but it was
[40:42] preached like this well I'm
[40:44] perfect don't understand how to be
[40:47] perfect you think you're
[40:49] perfect well I don't really understand
[40:52] but the Bible says I'm
[40:54] perfect when he day I get over there be
[40:57] perfect is that not our way of
[41:00] understanding
[41:01] Perfection until the message of the
[41:04] hour came
[41:07] in the message of the hour related us
[41:11] back to the scriptures to show us these
[41:14] things right
[41:16] right thank God for the
[41:20] message that's right all right you'll
[41:23] see in a minute what I mean by that that
[41:26] we didn't understand
[41:28] Perfection until the message
[41:30] came how could we understand godliness
[41:34] until the message
[41:38] came did any of us have any emphasis or
[41:42] thoughts or do they now of anything
[41:44] about godliness how that it means to be
[41:46] like God other than a fact of saying we
[41:50] got to be like God we got to do this and
[41:52] be like God is not being like God like
[41:54] that you remember this morning where was
[41:56] using that scripture they have a form of
[41:59] godliness the kindo priest manifested
[42:02] whole lot more godliness in the natural
[42:06] eyes of mankind than the Lord Jesus
[42:10] did you understand the way I said it in
[42:13] the natural Mankind's understanding the
[42:16] kind old priest manifested but Jesus was
[42:19] God he must have been Godly
[42:23] right if anybody knew how to be Godly it
[42:26] was him you know why cuz it was God okay
[42:31] now how are you and I going to ever
[42:32] understand
[42:34] godliness when we get away from the
[42:36] world I don't know about this I don't
[42:38] know about that maybe that might be
[42:39] right but we're yeah we're the children
[42:41] of God but we just don't understand that
[42:43] that's why you ain't read the
[42:45] message what's the 50 years you've been
[42:51] doing when I tell you I read six books
[42:54] and listened to two tapes in one day day
[42:57] I didn't do that every day but I did
[43:02] that well I don't know what the prophet
[43:04] said on how come that's
[43:08] right you know all about Facebooks and
[43:11] all these movie stars and characters
[43:15] and right we've had 50 years to read one
[43:19] Bible 50 years to read one
[43:22] message and now you got 2,000 split off
[43:27] out of the same
[43:29] message
[43:31] right things even the denominational
[43:33] people wouldn't do that's right I don't
[43:35] mind saying that right you didn't have
[43:38] polygamy and agamies and agamies or
[43:40] whatever it was okay in the babtist
[43:44] church I remember when it was taboo to
[43:46] talk about
[43:53] polygamy but
[43:55] listen
[43:57] godliness then has to come before
[44:00] brotherly
[44:03] kindness or else your brotherly kindness
[44:06] would not have anything to vulcanize to
[44:09] and it would
[44:11] crumble cuz Satan's going to try
[44:14] it right and I told you about and
[44:17] brother Lis the reason they're not here
[44:18] today they're over at brother we's
[44:20] preaching yesterday but he made a good
[44:22] point the other day when he's talking
[44:23] about that virtue would start out here
[44:26] and it grows and fills
[44:28] up you don't start out with all about
[44:30] virtue and all about knowledge it grows
[44:33] into it the whole thing is a growth
[44:35] development all
[44:38] right now listen we talk about
[44:41] perfection we know for certain that only
[44:43] god is
[44:45] perfect all right we know for certain
[44:48] that God is the only one who has these
[44:50] virtues until he died at Calvary to
[44:52] release them y right then you expect
[44:55] expect you and I to have
[44:58] them that was the purpose no the purpose
[45:01] for D was was to be
[45:04] saved now that ain't all the story The
[45:07] Earnest of our
[45:09] inheritance until the Redemption of the
[45:12] purchased
[45:14] product so Calvary took care of all
[45:16] things but something had not has not
[45:18] been applied that's right brother
[45:20] Brandon said Redemption was paid for for
[45:24] the Jews at C
[45:26] he said but not
[45:30] applied
[45:32] right it's got to be applied so there's
[45:35] something got to be done all
[45:38] right now to try to make it f where we
[45:42] can get to
[45:43] it
[45:46] remember on Statue of perfect
[45:49] man he mentions part then he's over in
[45:52] Blasphemous names and he's talking about
[45:55] a sister having a
[45:56] dream sister
[45:59] Shepherd she had a dream that she was on
[46:01] top of like a mountain or area or
[46:03] something and uh as she was up there she
[46:08] wondered if she had the Holy Spirit or
[46:11] not and he said that she saw this place
[46:14] was like a rock
[46:19] box and said she saw this big strong man
[46:23] we'll read some of these in a second but
[46:26] pouring the
[46:27] beautiful pretty water into the Rock
[46:32] box and said it was boiling out all of
[46:35] the trash and running down the
[46:40] sides but she looked and talked to the
[46:43] man that was standing there and saids
[46:45] why is it that it's boiling out all this
[46:48] but it won't
[46:50] hold he said you cannot put the Holy
[46:53] Ghost into a denomination and things
[46:57] he said individuals are full of the Holy
[46:59] Ghost he said nothing won't hold the
[47:02] Holy
[47:04] Ghost that's what he said then he says
[47:08] the man the same man took and brought
[47:11] some honey and poured it in the rock
[47:16] box and he said it looked like she did
[47:19] said it looked like it was going to
[47:20] bust but said the honey did
[47:24] hold now watch
[47:28] him you mean the Holy
[47:36] Spirit would run out and go
[47:39] over and boil out and he got his job and
[47:42] he said that's what it's doing that's
[47:44] right but the
[47:46] honey would
[47:51] hold the honey would hold the Holy
[47:54] Spirit that's right
[47:56] the Holy Spirit was the
[47:58] water we'll read
[48:00] it the Honey will hold it he said no
[48:04] church and things can't hold the Holy
[48:06] Ghost but the honey
[48:08] would and he said the honey represents
[48:10] brotherly
[48:15] kindness he said it'll hold
[48:20] that's all
[48:24] right so what about
[48:29] it what do you think about
[48:34] it so let's just start reading a little
[48:36] bit now I told you I warned you if I had
[48:39] a little lengthy you forgive me because
[48:41] I got a point to get to and then I'm
[48:42] going to have to go from there look at
[48:44] number one which is Blasphemous names
[48:46] Tak paragraph 119 through
[48:51] 121 he's talking about that each age has
[48:55] had that rock Box you remember we'll
[48:57] read it here is a rock Box sister
[49:00] Shepherd seen a rock Box in other words
[49:02] what was it it was a hun out rock or
[49:05] something right a
[49:07] box and there was man was pouring the
[49:09] water in and it boiling out everything
[49:11] inside the
[49:12] box and running down the mountain all
[49:16] right then pouring the honey in in hell
[49:18] he said every AG had to rock box cuz
[49:20] that's your confession of Jesus
[49:24] Christ right
[49:26] and watch him that's been each ages had
[49:29] the rock confession on up to this rock
[49:32] confession of the lady of see and now
[49:34] you cannot take a holy church there's no
[49:37] such thing as a holy church or a holy
[49:40] organization the Holy Spirit can be
[49:42] preached in it but in there you find
[49:45] good and bad Renegades indifferent and
[49:49] everything else so an organization will
[49:52] not hold it what the Holy Spirit
[49:56] you can't say we got it none of the rest
[49:58] of them has it no
[50:01] sir the holy spirit is poured out on
[50:06] individuals it's individuals so
[50:09] therefore the rock watch him this
[50:11] latterday Pentecostal
[50:14] Church which has received the Holy
[50:16] Spirit they did at the first yep yeah so
[50:21] that solves a problem of whether or not
[50:23] that the holy spirit is here like it was
[50:25] the book of Acts that's what he said you
[50:29] said but I don't see it that means God's
[50:33] wrong you say I don't see it that means
[50:35] God's wrong I guess to
[50:41] you maybe we're to
[50:43] look
[50:45] look the Pentecostal Church which has
[50:48] received the Holy Spirit they did at the
[50:50] first all down Through the Ages they had
[50:53] they received the Holy Spirit now watch
[50:55] but not in the
[50:57] measure that they have it
[51:01] now right cuz that's the book of Acts
[51:04] that's the faith of the Father God is
[51:06] the restoration the first we take the
[51:08] Candlestick the Alpha and Omega right
[51:10] all right now soever age has had a rock
[51:15] box cuz that's your confession if you
[51:17] read the book you'll see brother around
[51:19] them explaining Upon This Rock I'll
[51:21] build my church The Gates of Hell shall
[51:23] not Prevail against it it's a rock box
[51:25] he's explaining salvation he's not
[51:27] explaining how pretty a pyramid looks or
[51:30] a mountain or a thought right he's
[51:34] explaining the truth watch now look
[51:37] where he goes here now to
[51:40] 367 you get it these people who died in
[51:44] here are depending and waiting on us so
[51:48] this church has got to come to
[51:49] perfection in order to bring the
[51:51] resurrection
[51:53] amen that's plain langely
[51:56] and they're uh they're under sold under
[51:59] the altar waiting for this church to
[52:01] come to its
[52:05] Perfection which
[52:08] is this
[52:11] virtue of godliness and you think I
[52:14] spend all this time talking about
[52:16] godliness to not know where I'm going to
[52:18] read
[52:21] from you say well we just don't have it
[52:24] he's done brought it back to talking
[52:26] about
[52:27] perfection that when Christ does
[52:30] come in this church you see is coming
[52:34] smaller in the minority brother R refers
[52:37] to chalk board
[52:38] draw it's a whole lot sharper than that
[52:41] would just like to write that cross di
[52:43] SE is coming up to a needle point
[52:47] until listen until the church and the
[52:50] minority has got to get into a place
[52:53] until it's the same kind of a Ministry
[52:55] that this left because when The
[52:58] Headstone comes
[53:00] back when this headstone comes back it's
[53:03] got a little pocket like here where it's
[53:07] going to sit right down in
[53:09] there a little
[53:12] pocket A Little Rock
[53:15] Box
[53:17] okay little pocket where it's going to
[53:20] sit right in there on the regular
[53:23] pyramid it just isn't a cap that sits
[53:25] across the
[53:28] top a regular pyramid is not just
[53:32] a head sitting over the
[53:37] top all
[53:39] right it isn't a c that sits across the
[53:43] top you take this right
[53:45] here and you pull that love down to here
[53:48] and it'll be setting right there your
[53:50] pyramid won't even line up
[53:53] straight that's sensible I don't need a
[53:55] revelation and needs eyeballs to see
[53:59] he's got a little
[54:00] pocket and what's he talking
[54:03] about course he's got a little flange
[54:05] it's a little flange a little flange to
[54:07] us means that hangover out there where
[54:10] you your shingles come down or your roof
[54:13] comes down it hangs over and we call
[54:14] that a
[54:15] flange that's not the side of the
[54:18] pyramid what's he talking about CU we're
[54:20] going to get into what the Holy Ghost
[54:22] really is R around them on blasphemia
[54:24] names what did he say
[54:27] he said the Holy Ghost has been taught
[54:29] but it said ain't been taught
[54:33] correctly it's got a little pocket like
[54:36] here where it's going to sit right in
[54:37] there on the regular pyramid it just
[54:39] isn't a cap that sits across the top cuz
[54:41] see you can just throw the cap off and
[54:43] everything fall down when we get through
[54:45] with this and you see really what it is
[54:47] you'll see that once that head unites
[54:49] with the body you cannot take one of
[54:52] those stones out of that pyramid amen
[54:55] you got to lift the cap up to be able to
[54:58] get one of them out there's your seal of
[55:01] God it's impossible for it not to be
[55:04] there it's a little flange and it's got
[55:06] to sit on there cuz it sheds the water
[55:09] and when it comes this church has got to
[55:11] be honed come on down coming through
[55:14] perfectly you can't run a razor blade
[55:16] between them weighing tons they got him
[55:18] up there they don't know but they were
[55:19] built and up here when the pyramid cap
[55:22] does come the pyramid itself the body of
[55:25] of Christ will have to be honed not only
[55:29] just some Creed or doctrine or something
[55:32] other we come through it'll have to be
[55:35] so perfectly like
[55:37] Christ till
[55:40] christly like Christ till when he comes
[55:43] he and that ministry will fit right
[55:45] smack together then will come the
[55:47] Rapture and the going home brother Bram
[55:50] is explaining Redemption to some of you
[55:54] that don't understand what we talk about
[55:56] a lot of time the body of Jesus
[55:59] Christ right the body of Jesus
[56:04] Christ
[56:05] is built up and he's the
[56:09] head you can put the body in the pyramid
[56:12] and he's identically
[56:13] fit all right see it's not just talking
[56:17] about pyramids and this that or the
[56:18] other he taking the entire Bible and
[56:22] bringing down all of the visions and
[56:25] relationship throughout the Bible down
[56:27] to know the hour that you and I are
[56:31] living it's not strange words once you
[56:34] understand it is simply The Plan of
[56:37] Redemption God redeeming mankind all
[56:40] right now
[56:43] watching go ahead to number three now
[56:46] this is where we start on the
[56:47] blasphemist name and he's going to tell
[56:50] you uh I believe in those virtues
[56:53] speaking in tongues and shouting all all
[56:55] kind of demonstration I believe in every
[56:56] bit of it but if it if it's there
[56:59] without this take out any of them see
[57:03] there is something wrong see and you see
[57:05] you got a shell notice she was worried
[57:08] about it so she just laid down and on
[57:11] she dreamed a dream and she dreamed she
[57:13] was up on a mountain and in this
[57:16] mountain the best I haven't got the
[57:18] paper on it had a rock Box can I watch
[57:21] that sitting right in top of this
[57:23] mountain and her HUD usband was just
[57:26] behind
[57:26] her and she saw a large
[57:30] man standing there with work clothes
[57:34] on now watch that man watch
[57:37] him and see where he
[57:39] fits sleev rolled up bailing the most
[57:43] pure water that she ever seen and poured
[57:46] it into this
[57:48] box this Rock Box sitting in top of the
[57:52] mountain and The Rock
[57:55] box would not hold
[57:59] water that's it and it rolled right out
[58:02] of there just boiled up all the trash
[58:05] and the sticks and everything in there
[58:07] and boiled it out and rolled down the
[58:09] mountain and it rolled over her feet and
[58:11] she was standing right in that stuff
[58:14] only it didn't stick to her and then she
[58:16] asked why the Box didn't hold it and the
[58:18] man said that's not
[58:21] water the man stand there that's not
[58:23] water that's the Holy Spirit Holy
[58:28] Ghost but remember the man was one that
[58:30] was pouring it
[58:32] in the man in just a minute going to be
[58:35] the
[58:37] messenger ah you're making too much out
[58:39] of brother
[58:40] random no we're just getting it
[58:45] right so that's the Holy Ghost and said
[58:48] nothing will hold it and said then he
[58:50] went back same man and got another big
[58:53] bucket and it was full of
[58:56] honey if you don't follow me and nothing
[58:58] else you just remember one thing had
[59:00] this messenger not come they'd be no
[59:02] honey to pour in that box you can take
[59:05] what you want
[59:09] to there would have been no honey for it

[59:15] understanding of
[59:17] this right Shake Yourself you get sleepy
[59:20] I get sleepy but don't pinch you one
[59:23] next to you cuz that might mess up thing

[59:29] yourself
[59:31] look another big bucket and it was full
[59:33] of honey and poured the honey into there
[59:36] said now it will hold this and she
[59:40] thought that the box was a rock box and
[59:43] was going to burst out and spill the
[59:45] honey but it didn't it finally stuck
[59:49] together and it Hil and she turned and
[59:51] went down the mountain right now
[59:55] what about
[59:56] that rock
[1:00:00] Box what about that
[1:00:02] talk he says on paragraph 114 now here
[1:00:05] is the interpretation of the
[1:00:08] dream may I look at it you look at it
[1:00:11] and read it but may I say it in these
[1:00:12] words here's the interpretation of
[1:00:14] sister Shepherd's dream she's explain
[1:00:17] she saw the Plan of Salvation she saw
[1:00:20] the church ages and the water running

[1:00:25] dream but it's not just a mountain of
[1:00:27] this that the other that mountain has
[1:00:29] got to be in individuals cuz remember
[1:00:32] only individuals can have the Holy
[1:00:35] Spirit not churches and so she's talking

[1:02:27] thing but let's read it so go ahead to
[1:02:29] number five taken from is it the sign of
[1:02:33] the end
[1:02:35] sir and he talks about Junior Jackson
[1:02:37] had a
[1:02:38] dream he dreamed a dream and I just sat
[1:02:41] there and a list and watched he said I
[1:02:43] dreamed that there was a great big hill
[1:02:46] looked out in a field where blue grce
[1:02:48] are something else and said you on top
[1:02:50] of this hill where the water had washed
[1:02:52] away the soil there there was a top rock
[1:02:56] up on top of the hill like the top of
[1:02:59] the mountain it was Rock no Grace and
[1:03:02] when the water had washed down it had
[1:03:04] cut some kind of readings of these rocks
[1:03:07] and you were standing there interpreting
[1:03:10] this reading on these rocks that's what
[1:03:12] brother bran was doing in the message
[1:03:14] right
[1:03:16] interpreting and watch you and said all
[1:03:18] of us here's what he said to Brethren
[1:03:20] from Georgia around here we're stand our
[1:03:22] listening to you interpret that
[1:03:24] mysterious riding on those stones he
[1:03:27] picked up a crowbar and whipped the top
[1:03:29] off of it when he did a reckon bar and
[1:03:31] he said is he done it said you struck
[1:03:33] the top of the mountain it ripped
[1:03:35] around and lifted the cap off of it it
[1:03:38] was in the shape of a pyramid and you
[1:03:39] ripped the top off of it now that was
[1:03:42] months and months and months before the
[1:03:44] pyramid message was
[1:03:46] preached before the statue of perfect
[1:03:48] man was preached he already Junior
[1:03:51] Jackson done had this
[1:03:52] dream and said but beneath the white
[1:03:55] stone you remember he whooped it off he
[1:03:58] had to go West connect with the angel
[1:03:59] come back and preach what was inside cuz
[1:04:01] it was nothing written
[1:04:03] there
[1:04:05] right okay
[1:04:08] now so watch
[1:04:14] now he goes on to explain go to number
[1:04:20] six standing in the Gap well it happened
[1:04:23] to be that least one man is spred it
[1:04:25] this morning who was standing there when
[1:04:26] it happened it actually shook the Earth
[1:04:28] he talking about a thing and then he was
[1:04:30] telling I saw seven angels in the form
[1:04:32] of a pyramid that swept down and picked
[1:04:34] me up and I was brought here to the east
[1:04:36] about the Seven Seals so that's the same
[1:04:38] thing that brother Jackson sing the same
[1:04:42] thing that sister Shepherd seen
[1:04:46] explaining the Plan of Salvation and
[1:04:49] what happened brother brandham had to go
[1:04:51] West connect with those angels and come
[1:04:53] back to tell us what was
[1:04:58] inside but just
[1:05:02] remember explaining Redemption it ain't
[1:05:04] explaining a whole bunch of different he
[1:05:06] saw pyramid Angels he saw a pyramid of
[1:05:08] where Junior Jackson dream he saw a
[1:05:10] pyramid of like a mountain with a
[1:05:13] sister and she had a rock Box on
[1:05:18] hers the others doesn't mention that
[1:05:22] part it just goes on to mention other
[1:05:26] things that come
[1:05:28] forth all right let me
[1:05:33] go drop down to number seven I'm going
[1:05:36] have to byp pass a whole lot because I
[1:05:38] know I'm dulling some and some you're
[1:05:41] we're trying to get to it he talks about
[1:05:44] from Blasphemous name the Rock Box
[1:05:46] confession the same
[1:05:48] thing of the Statue of perfect man and
[1:05:52] then you cannot make a holy church
[1:05:53] there's no such thing thing as a holy
[1:05:54] church or a holy organization the Holy
[1:05:56] Spirit can be preached in there but in
[1:05:58] there you find good and bad we done read
[1:06:00] that cuz what did it do therefore the
[1:06:02] rock which is the latter day Pentecostal
[1:06:04] they had at the
[1:06:05] beginning it's talking about the baptism
[1:06:07] with the Holy Ghost that they had at the
[1:06:09] beginning and what was
[1:06:14] it 122 where we at rolling

[1:10:41] him the honey he's the point is what is
[1:10:43] he he was the man pouring the water he
[1:10:47] was the one used to pour the water he
[1:10:49] was the one used to pour the
[1:10:51] honey right right without the washing of
[1:10:55] the water of the word you and I don't
[1:10:56] have any hopes that's right there
[1:11:00] certainly ain't going to be no honey for
[1:11:02] the brotherly kindness to develop
[1:11:07] into no we don't give we don't make
[1:11:09] brother brandom deity and God and all
[1:11:11] this that and the other no but the
[1:11:13] message he brought I've been playing
[1:11:16] with you brother brandom himself was not
[1:11:20] infallible but the message he brought
[1:11:22] was infallible you those places he me
[1:11:25] that was brother
[1:11:28] brandom that was the man that was not
[1:11:31] infallible but he corrected those
[1:11:36] things
[1:11:38] right the message is
[1:11:40] infallible why cuz the messenger was
[1:11:42] pouring the message into the
[1:11:47] church what is it supposed to be when
[1:11:49] you and I are listening to tapes and
[1:11:51] reading books and things
[1:11:54] is it not that this message is to boil
[1:11:56] out the things of our lives and show us
[1:11:58] where the wrongs are and the rights are
[1:12:03] amen and to bring us to brotherly
[1:12:08] kindness bring us to a
[1:12:11] place to where God can live in
[1:12:15] mankind the way he always wanted to like
[1:12:18] we were talking about last night what
[1:12:20] did this message come
[1:12:22] for
[1:12:25] brother Brandon's message began in the
[1:12:28] seals I've got the direct quotes if you
[1:12:30] want them I've got him because
[1:12:32] especially if you don't read uh uh
[1:12:34] Rapture he said not in the years of
[1:12:37] preparation but said when he begin to
[1:12:39] sound right the first years of brother
[1:12:42] brandom was a restoration back to the
[1:12:45] original faith of the
[1:12:49] fathers
[1:12:51] right come on that's right he brought
[1:12:53] the message to return us back to the
[1:12:55] faith of the fathers then the seal
[1:12:58] that's to whipped off the top of the
[1:13:00] pyramid and he looked down in and saw
[1:13:02] things that were not even written he
[1:13:04] goes west connects come back brings the
[1:13:06] an the word of
[1:13:09] God if we were talking about last night
[1:13:11] what is
[1:13:14] it come on folks get plain and serious
[1:13:18] we don't need brother Rand to tell us
[1:13:19] it's wrong for women to cut their High
[1:13:21] yeah right the Bible says
[1:13:25] it we don't need it for it to tell the
[1:13:27] men to not have long high the Bible says
[1:13:31] it we don't need it to say that wearing
[1:13:35] the garments pertaining to a man or a
[1:13:37] woman the Bible speaks of both of
[1:13:41] them you only read the garments
[1:13:44] pertaining to a man read the rest of
[1:13:45] that verse down below there it talks
[1:13:47] about the women the men wearing women's
[1:13:52] garments
[1:13:56] we don't need that
[1:13:58] listen we didn't have the prophet to
[1:14:00] come and tell us that was wrong to
[1:14:02] sin right that's
[1:14:06] right we didn't have to have the Bible
[1:14:08] to tell us what sin was I mean the
[1:14:10] prophet to tell us what sin
[1:14:12] was that's in the book known as the
[1:14:16] faith of the
[1:14:18] fathers statute of a perfect man if you
[1:14:20] don't believe it go read the book you're
[1:14:22] supposed to have you ought to be able to
[1:14:23] find a
[1:14:24] page brother brother said he waited 30
[1:14:27] something years before he could preach
[1:14:29] that
[1:14:30] message read the book you'll find it in
[1:14:34] there 30 something years before he could
[1:14:37] preach the stature of a perfect
[1:14:42] man you'll find it relating to patience
[1:14:46] and he said I've had patient you
[1:14:48] know all
[1:14:52] right
[1:14:53] but the prophet's message begin in the
[1:14:55] sealed I'll be glad to show you the rest
[1:14:57] of those but not in his years of
[1:14:59] preparation but when he began to sound
[1:15:02] right all of that other was the faith of
[1:15:05] the fathers being brought back then
[1:15:08] brother Brandon went
[1:15:09] West now listen as we talking about last
[1:15:12] night listen to it the Bible had already
[1:15:16] spoken of salvation for the
[1:15:20] soul it spoke of other things but basic
[1:15:23] as it would say Chang it a moment
[1:15:25] twinkle of an eye that was a prophecy of
[1:15:28] a future
[1:15:30] event and Mankind didn't know that other
[1:15:32] than the fact well we're going to be
[1:15:33] changed moment twinkle ey now what's a
[1:15:35] twinkle they never worried about nothing
[1:15:38] else right what's a twinkle well it
[1:15:41] means it it means the eye it means that
[1:15:43] it means it it means that you heard it
[1:15:46] over and over didn't you what is the
[1:15:49] twinkle of an
[1:15:51] eye never said a word word about the
[1:15:54] denomination never said a word that it
[1:15:56] was the
[1:15:57] word
[1:15:59] right that would be the message that
[1:16:02] would change us in a moment in the
[1:16:04] twinkle of an
[1:16:05] eye is only what a twinkle
[1:16:10] was boy we really had it didn't
[1:16:17] we see it was only
[1:16:21] prophecies prophecies was speak speak of
[1:16:23] the chains of the body
[1:16:25] yes but nobody but the Lord
[1:16:30] Jesus reach that
[1:16:33] place now I stay with the Bible no man
[1:16:36] has approached to
[1:16:39] immortality this see immortality means
[1:16:42] mortal made Eternal except Jesus Christ
[1:16:45] now you can argue all you want to on
[1:16:47] that that's the
[1:16:50] Bible right no matter what where you
[1:16:53] arue the point you're going to come back
[1:16:54] to that and stand looking at that
[1:16:59] scripture what is brother random come to
[1:17:03] do we quoted the scripture that while
[1:17:05] ago but did you catch it which is the
[1:17:08] the New Birth the Salvation which is the
[1:17:10] earnest of our inheritance what until
[1:17:13] the Redemption of the purchased
[1:17:17] possession what was the purchased
[1:17:20] possession this body was redeemed at
[1:17:24] Calvary right that's right but it's not
[1:17:27] applied right
[1:17:30] right page 49 it's in the future home
[1:17:33] maybe be different on you paragraph 49
[1:17:34] of the future
[1:17:36] home he said the soul is redeemed he
[1:17:39] said but we're waiting the Redemption of
[1:17:42] the body
[1:17:44] amen see this message come for this body
[1:17:47] to be
[1:17:50] redeemed right
[1:17:53] now he had to go back and tell us what
[1:17:55] they Ted right that's what gets me when
[1:17:58] they say well brother random and his
[1:18:00] early Ministry was wrong but then the
[1:18:02] son of man come straightened him out and
[1:18:04] boy he got it right on over here well
[1:18:07] who are you who told you that brother
[1:18:08] random didn't tell you that the Bible
[1:18:10] don't tell you
[1:18:13] that you must have got it from some
[1:18:15] other source and only know one
[1:18:20] other right
[1:18:24] but listen
[1:18:28] Church the messenger was pouring the
[1:18:31] message
[1:18:32] in it was boiling out the trash that's
[1:18:34] what's happening now you come in the
[1:18:37] message today and you start reading the
[1:18:38] book and listen to the tape that Holy
[1:18:41] Spirit is washing us out right but the
[1:18:44] water of the washing of the
[1:18:48] word why wouldn't we want to study the
[1:18:50] message then why wouldn't it should be
[1:18:53] more important than anything else in our
[1:18:58] lives oh my goodness well I want to know
[1:19:00] who's going to be president well the way
[1:19:02] it looks now Hillary is probably going
[1:19:03] to have a she to help
[1:19:05] her that's going to be double ain't
[1:19:09] it but if Trump gets it what do you got
[1:19:12] on that side oh you know what Trump's
[1:19:14] doing now Trump's got
[1:19:19] converted supposed to be a born again
[1:19:21] Christian boy they trying everything in
[1:19:23] the world to win ain't they no Hillary
[1:19:26] she just says y'all go ahead and play
[1:19:28] all you want
[1:19:29] to I'm going to take who I want to and
[1:19:32] put them in they got to make their
[1:19:33] choice in a few
[1:19:35] days
[1:19:37] TR come on
[1:19:39] folks you know what I done that time in
[1:19:41] the fellowship meeting when I said you
[1:19:43] want to know who's going to be
[1:19:45] president I said you thus say the Lord
[1:19:47] of who's going to be president well
[1:19:49] everybody just looking at me like what
[1:19:51] does he know I said the Bible says I put
[1:19:55] in Kings I take out Kings whoever who he
[1:19:58] wants whether it be Hillary another
[1:20:01] woman and Trump all
[1:20:04] three I think you ought to do it that
[1:20:06] way I think you ought to make Trump and
[1:20:08] Hillary
[1:20:11] co-presidents of course one of them
[1:20:13] wouldn't live too
[1:20:14] long
[1:20:16] right I going to get rid of them okay
[1:20:20] get you to
[1:20:21] life
[1:20:24] and get you to life where you listen
[1:20:28] now why would it
[1:20:31] be that when brother randam would draw
[1:20:34] the stature of a perfect
[1:20:37] man that he would draw it the way he
[1:20:39] done it and we have to agree it's
[1:20:41] authentic you know there's people
[1:20:42] sitting here that was there and a lot of
[1:20:44] that was preached and they can give you
[1:20:46] the authent they give you the fact of
[1:20:47] knowing that it was true that that's the
[1:20:49] way he draw it up why did he draw it
[1:20:52] like
[1:20:54] that and put Holy Spirit right here and
[1:20:57] if you lower that headstone down it
[1:20:59] ain't going to fit the pyramid worth
[1:21:02] nothing that's
[1:21:04] natural that's just by looking so let's
[1:21:07] just don't lower it down let's leave it
[1:21:13] alone let's let the prophet fill in the
[1:21:17] sides right are you with
[1:21:20] me you understand what I mean if you
[1:21:23] bring that down look where it would be
[1:21:25] setting it would not be like this it
[1:21:28] would come down and go over but if you
[1:21:30] do it like that it's lined up from the
[1:21:32] bottom let's let him fill in the
[1:21:36] sides all
[1:21:38] right and you'll see why he said holy
[1:21:44] spirit all
[1:21:46] right he talked of a sister Shepherd's
[1:21:50] dream he talked of a rock box
[1:21:53] a rock box is something you know a box
[1:21:57] got a bottom in it something around rock
[1:21:59] box right the water was being poured
[1:22:02] into that and overflowed out the stature
[1:22:05] represents the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:22:08] right the pyramid
[1:22:10] drawing the pyramid drawing is
[1:22:12] representative of the body of Christ
[1:22:14] right brother around and we'll get back
[1:22:15] to it where he said The Messengers comes
[1:22:18] up the same way as each individual comes
[1:22:21] up we get back on to those time just a
[1:22:24] little thought for you
[1:22:27] today why would he put Holy Spirit
[1:22:38] there the brothers we tried to concoct I
[1:22:42] guess You' call it a little part of the
[1:22:44] drawing I've done this many years ago
[1:22:46] but you know cuz I've known this and
[1:22:49] studied it like this but they're going
[1:22:50] to try to do it with a drawing go ahead
[1:22:52] brother and pull up a statue of perfect
[1:22:53] man and it's not according to scale so
[1:22:57] okay now here is what's back there on
[1:23:00] the
[1:23:02] thing and like I said if you lower this
[1:23:04] down you're off but if you keep the line
[1:23:06] straight and fill it
[1:23:09] in so when you start you're born again
[1:23:11] at Faith and that Faith keeps building
[1:23:15] upward and this is being filled in and
[1:23:18] when it comes up then virtue is
[1:23:21] vulcanized
[1:23:23] are sealed into it so is it all the way
[1:23:26] up to coming all right now go ahead and
[1:23:31] use the next
[1:23:32] one I told you it's out of proportion
[1:23:35] don't lower the head down at all just
[1:23:37] leave it
[1:23:39] alone brother Ram spoke of the sister
[1:23:42] shepherd with a rock box he spoke of the
[1:23:44] other with a
[1:23:51] flange
[1:23:53] he said that flange will shed
[1:23:56] water
[1:23:58] remember you don't lower The
[1:24:03] Headstone you grow up to
[1:24:07] it you're growing up into it you don't
[1:24:11] have to lower it you grow up into it
[1:24:14] here's your rock Box it boils out all
[1:24:17] the trash brings all this boils it out
[1:24:20] here's the other part and if if you did
[1:24:22] lower them on the correct order then you
[1:24:26] would see if your rock box is down here
[1:24:28] and your other this fits right over the
[1:24:30] top of
[1:24:31] it that's
[1:24:35] natural see one it goes up you know
[1:24:40] bring your pyramid in a little bit and
[1:24:41] then make a rock Box make the other one
[1:24:43] right
[1:24:45] reverse and what have you
[1:24:48] got so you don't lower these to do it
[1:24:50] that's why we couldn't draw it you don't
[1:24:52] lower for them but if you put that
[1:24:53] correctly you would bring that one
[1:24:55] totally down to
[1:24:57] here cuz now you can't shed no water I
[1:25:00] mean you shed all the water now you
[1:25:02] can't take nothing out unless you take
[1:25:05] that headstone
[1:25:06] out that's why she's going to be
[1:25:08] finished one day that's why it's called
[1:25:11] the Holy Spirit I'm going to read
[1:25:13] brother
[1:25:16] brandom and you come up as each one of
[1:25:19] these is brought into being it's
[1:25:21] vulcanized together but as it does the
[1:25:23] side is being formed the holy spirit is
[1:25:25] sealing it sealing it sealing it sealing
[1:25:28] it sealing
[1:25:29] it and there's your Holy
[1:25:32] Spirit
[1:25:34] okay there's your holy spirit that seals
[1:25:37] you
[1:25:41] in right the two fits
[1:25:47] together this one is built up that one
[1:25:49] comes down you're perfectly set to work
[1:25:53] you cannot destroy any of that pyramid
[1:25:56] without taking out that
[1:25:58] top cuz every rock is vulcanized to it
[1:26:02] and the outside is
[1:26:04] sealed you said well what do we
[1:26:12] got go ahead to number
[1:26:19] eight Blasphemous names
[1:26:22] then when we have met these these
[1:26:25] qualifications and become full of the
[1:26:27] virtues of God and the things of God
[1:26:29] then the Holy Spirit comes down and
[1:26:31] seals us into the
[1:26:34] kingdom but you're sealed down at the
[1:26:36] bottom the baptism of the Holy Ghost it
[1:26:38] says grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby
[1:26:40] you're sealed until the day of
[1:26:41] redemption is this new birth right
[1:26:44] here you're sealed at the new
[1:26:47] birth but you're now coming to an
[1:26:50] understanding of what a seal really is
[1:26:54] you're coming to an understanding what
[1:26:55] has really happened you're going to fill
[1:26:57] in the sides and make it work become
[1:26:59] full of the virtues and things of God
[1:27:01] then the Holy Spirit comes down and
[1:27:02] sealed us into the kingdom don't worry
[1:27:05] everybody will know you got it you won't
[1:27:07] have to say well I well glory to God I
[1:27:10] know I got it I spoke with tongues glory
[1:27:12] to God I know I got it I dance in the
[1:27:14] spirit you won't have to say a word
[1:27:16] about it everybody will know you got it
[1:27:20] now may I say this everybody who knows
[1:27:22] what it is that's right the world ain't
[1:27:26] going to never know all about it they
[1:27:28] ain't going to never accept you come on
[1:27:31] don't worry about your neighbor you
[1:27:32] worry about the people of this
[1:27:34] message okay and look at the last one
[1:27:38] the stature of a perfect
[1:27:41] man
[1:27:43] paragraph
[1:27:45] 32829 30 then building The Virtue
[1:27:48] building this Monument building this
[1:27:51] stature see it starts off with the
[1:27:53] foundation stone Faith virtue knowledge
[1:27:55] Temperance patience godliness brotherly
[1:27:58] kindness and now what does it do then
[1:28:01] they're waiting for the headstone which
[1:28:03] is love for God is love and he controls
[1:28:08] and he is the strength of every one of
[1:28:09] these all these virtues they're
[1:28:12] vocalized together they're sealed
[1:28:13] together right in there right in here
[1:28:15] you see I got it
[1:28:17] between all these Works in
[1:28:20] here now what's he got hold
[1:28:23] Spirit right in here right in here you
[1:28:25] see I got it in between all these Works
[1:28:28] in here and here are these little ways
[1:28:31] come what is
[1:28:33] that the holy ghost coming down
[1:28:37] watch through
[1:28:41] Christ and what would brother I'm
[1:28:43] talking about the Holy Ghost coming
[1:28:44] through Christ when Christ is the Holy
[1:28:49] Spirit the holy ghost coming down
[1:28:51] through Christ that's the Holy
[1:28:55] Spirit the holy spirit is above all
[1:28:57] these things welding these things
[1:29:00] together building a what a perfect
[1:29:03] church for the Capstone to cap
[1:29:07] off something else has got to
[1:29:11] happen you're looking at the pyramid
[1:29:13] you're getting what I'm talking about
[1:29:15] what's it been done again it's
[1:29:18] manifested through seven Church ages and
[1:29:21] seven Church
[1:29:23] Messengers bringing you to a place The
[1:29:25] Headstone can
[1:29:28] unite wait until we get to the church
[1:29:31] ages and bring the
[1:29:34] message right here not right
[1:29:37] here we get up right
[1:29:41] here and the message will be right amen
[1:29:44] the prophet will be right but what is it
[1:29:47] the holy ghost coming down through
[1:29:49] Christ see Holy Spirit
[1:29:55] bringing these things
[1:29:57] together and then The Headstone will you
[1:29:59] not you say yeah but the head the the
[1:30:01] Holy Ghost is a headstone
[1:30:05] amen so was the New Birth that you
[1:30:08] received the Seal of God but then you're
[1:30:13] sealed that's adoption right we're going
[1:30:16] to get to those things eventually right
[1:30:20] adoption
[1:30:24] the head and body has to
[1:30:27] unite but there has to be we you read
[1:30:29] part of it we read some more there has
[1:30:30] to be the same Ministry of Jesus
[1:30:35] Christ before The Headstone can Unite
[1:30:37] with the
[1:30:39] body the prophet has done his part he
[1:30:41] poured in the the the water which is
[1:30:43] representing the Holy Spirit he preached
[1:30:46] all of his life out trying his best to
[1:30:48] get people to see Christ right and who
[1:30:52] the Holy Ghost really is and what it
[1:30:54] is and then he lived a life which was
[1:30:59] unreachable of course now they changing
[1:31:02] now he done this he done that let them
[1:31:03] go
[1:31:04] ahead they just dig in their own
[1:31:08] grave but he brought brotherly
[1:31:12] kindness
[1:31:14] into
[1:31:16] understanding to you and
[1:31:19] I brotherly kindness
[1:31:22] bringing it to where we're
[1:31:28] at The Messer pouring the message
[1:31:32] in is what's going to boil out the trash
[1:31:35] it's also going to seal up the
[1:31:38] person you're sealed by the
[1:31:44] word the words you hear either sealed us
[1:31:47] out or sealed Us
[1:31:50] in right right amen whatever we hear is
[1:31:54] going to do one of the two seal Us in or
[1:31:57] seal us out
[1:31:59] right but if we take the message
[1:32:01] complete then it'll be this
[1:32:05] message as Zechariah
[1:32:07] says this
[1:32:09] jerub which represents the prince with
[1:32:13] God the prince is a child of God that is
[1:32:17] not King yet but he's coming to be king
[1:32:22] this
[1:32:24] messenger is going to do two
[1:32:27] things right Church age book you need it
[1:32:31] messenger of Malachi 4 is going to do
[1:32:33] two things one turn the hearts of the
[1:32:35] children back to the faith of the
[1:32:38] fathers
[1:32:39] two bring forth the seven Thunders which
[1:32:42] are the revelations containing in the
[1:32:44] Seven Seals watch him and it'll be these
[1:32:47] revely divinely revealed mystery truths
[1:32:50] that literally
[1:32:53] brings you and I to a
[1:32:57] change brings the faith of the fathers
[1:33:00] it bring the end it'll bring God 50
[1:33:03] years I've preached
[1:33:05] that trying to get somebody to believe
[1:33:10] it well brother D I read this that the
[1:33:12] other I believe
[1:33:14] amen well let's going to
[1:33:17] Perfection quit being babies that's got
[1:33:19] to be petted and pampered
[1:33:23] you
[1:33:25] know
[1:33:27] right you mean I could say something to
[1:33:29] you that would run you
[1:33:33] off then you're not trusting in the
[1:33:37] ministry because the next person that
[1:33:38] can say something to run you off
[1:33:42] too all you're going to do is wind up
[1:33:44] being a bunch of
[1:33:45] runoffs yeah
[1:33:50] right which but you see
[1:33:52] Church we're not in no way trying to say
[1:33:55] that we're this or we're that but why
[1:33:57] can't the people just like the brother
[1:34:00] asked me this
[1:34:01] morning a person
[1:34:06] that would say why does not people
[1:34:11] understand that Jesus Christ makes us
[1:34:13] perfect right and said if he said it
[1:34:16] he's got to take care of it
[1:34:19] right that's it
[1:34:22] amen oh of course we I'm not perfect I'm
[1:34:26] just
[1:34:28] forgiven if you're forgiven you're
[1:34:30] perfect cuz you ain't guilty
[1:34:33] right especially the way God says it
[1:34:36] come on remember this morning we're in
[1:34:37] in it remember this morning what
[1:34:41] according to a message called invisible
[1:34:43] Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:34:45] brother run speaks of
[1:34:48] justification and that chopping off your
[1:34:50] pie sins
[1:34:52] can never be remembered again against
[1:34:53] you they're chopped
[1:34:55] off then he speaks of the how that that
[1:34:58] individual will come to a
[1:35:02] place that as though he never done
[1:35:08] it that's
[1:35:10] justification then he goes on to speak
[1:35:12] of an individual of justification he
[1:35:15] says the real you never did do it
[1:35:20] that's the real you is that baptism of
[1:35:22] the Holy Ghost that's inside of
[1:35:27] there it never did
[1:35:31] Sin when are we going to believe
[1:35:33] it well I just don't know that sounds
[1:35:37] good but I don't know well we've had 50
[1:35:40] years now you got won't be long till
[1:35:42] I'll be dead if it keeps on going like
[1:35:44] it is now I ain't saying that not you
[1:35:46] know you got do that but I I am 76 years
[1:35:49] old you know 25 or 30 years I'm going to
[1:35:52] be at least getting to what do you say
[1:35:54] what to
[1:35:56] do right most of you done be P
[1:36:00] act right I told him at the fellowship
[1:36:04] meeting if it didn't happen pretty quick
[1:36:05] we going to have Fellowship meetings in
[1:36:06] the nursing
[1:36:08] home you know what we'd be in the nuring
[1:36:10] home wouldn't it be something sister C
[1:36:13] me and you sitting in there and you'd
[1:36:14] say what did he say Brother D I didn't
[1:36:16] hear it I he said something about some
[1:36:19] kind of dog or a cat or something I
[1:36:20] don't know
[1:36:25] silly ain't it but it's the truth time's
[1:36:28] running
[1:36:30] out right God has done all he can
[1:36:33] do and the emphasis I put on it all is
[1:36:37] God has got patience because he's
[1:36:39] patiently waiting on you and I 50 years
[1:36:43] he has given us to study this
[1:36:47] message and yet we know more about this
[1:36:50] out the other you know why that I don't
[1:36:52] and I'm not thr now listen you know why
[1:36:54] that I don't work on cars and
[1:36:57] things because I would have to TI my
[1:36:59] mind to learn to do those things and I
[1:37:02] won't do
[1:37:06] it I won't do it because it tight my
[1:37:09] mind it would Captivate me because then
[1:37:12] there would be nothing about that car
[1:37:14] that I wouldn't know Inside Out upside
[1:37:16] down in backwards if I was going to do
[1:37:20] it
[1:37:22] you see I want it to be where that he
[1:37:24] can speak to
[1:37:25] me and tell
[1:37:30] me and say well
[1:37:35] okay may I quote somebody that said
[1:37:41] this said the Lord told him that brother
[1:37:43] Dale is not saying that we're
[1:37:45] lost he's saying we're
[1:37:50] saved
[1:37:54] said you go tell him I said
[1:38:01] that that was
[1:38:05] good you can say well I believe this and
[1:38:08] but do you believe the rest of it said
[1:38:09] go tell him I said
[1:38:11] that said because he's kind of down and
[1:38:17] out the reason I'm down it out is
[1:38:19] because of trying to get you to believe
[1:38:21] the word that's already been
[1:38:24] given and I see you just drifting away
[1:38:27] and coming when you want to and back
[1:38:29] when you want to and doing what you want
[1:38:31] to and just things are falling
[1:38:37] apart I didn't do that when I was in the
[1:38:40] Baptist
[1:38:47] Church we have the greatest opportunity
[1:38:49] of all because when you miss you have an
[1:38:51] opportunity to go back and listen to the
[1:38:54] tapes and things but do
[1:38:57] you do
[1:39:02] you I don't understand brother
[1:39:05] Dale maybe you didn't hear the five
[1:39:07] Services
