[18:25] good so if you got your Bibles we're in
[18:27] a study on Daniel 70 weeks last weekend
[18:31] or last time we were here we were
[18:33] talking about the history because I want
[18:35] you to see today that Daniel 70 weeks is
[18:39] we know it's got different things we
[18:42] know it's all to the Jews and Israel and
[18:45] all these different things but there's
[18:47] an allegory there or there's a story
[18:49] behind all of it there's a there's
[18:52] something that you and I can glean from
[18:53] this it's not just something that's
[18:55] going to happen to them and and we push
[18:58] it all that way and
[18:59] there's there's some underlying meaning
[19:02] because we got a we got to realize this
[19:05] Israel has got to come to a Redemption
[19:08] but you and I have to come to a
[19:11] Redemption first and it's not different
[19:14] because redemptions not replacement
[19:16] Redemption if something got lost and
[19:18] then to bring it back then what's
[19:20] happening here in Jeremiah that we read
[19:21] last week which we're going to read some
[19:23] in a few minutes if you'll turn to
[19:25] Daniel 9 we're going to see how God is
[19:27] going to bring Israel back now we know
[19:33] one thing's for sure he can't bring
[19:35] Israel back to her glory days or bring
[19:37] Israel back as wife okay she went
[19:42] whoring and we read that in Jeremiah and
[19:45] I'll read it some more to to give you a
[19:47] little bit of a history and then we're
[19:48] just gonna read Scripture and then we'll
[19:50] be done so let's start with Daniel 9 so
[19:54] I want you to see yes this is to Israel
[19:55] but this has all remember scripture has
[19:59] dual meaning it has a meaning for you
[20:02] and I this is a story that's going to
[20:05] take place to Israel but this is also a
[20:07] story of your Redemption in my
[20:09] Redemption and then because as you know
[20:11] who does the redeeming God does the
[20:14] redeeming and there has to be a people
[20:17] to be redeemed so you and I are to be
[20:20] redeemed first then Israel then the
[20:25] world so he's not gonna forget Israel
[20:29] because he said he wasn't gonna forget
[20:30] Israel the man so I'll never forget it
[20:32] as well he'll never forget us and then
[20:35] because now we are married to him and
[20:37] there's no divorce papers being given
[20:39] hey man we are the bride of Jesus Christ
[20:42] there will be no other there will be no
[20:45] other wife we are the only wife that
[20:49] he'll have because remember we are the
[20:51] eve that's not going to fall amen so
[20:56] let's read Daniel 92112 92113 let's bow
[21:00] our heads the only father thank you for
[21:02] this day thank you for these wonderful
[21:05] brothers and sisters that are here Lord
[21:07] gathered
[21:08] prayerful ready to hear from you lord I
[21:12] pray this you would just have the active
[21:14] participation Lord in this service Lord
[21:17] the songs have been sung we've done the
[21:19] things that were supposed to do Lord now
[21:21] I pray that we'll continue and that we
[21:24] will be able to see or understand what
[21:27] you're talking about in the scripture
[21:30] thank God Lord you sent us a prophet
[21:34] that shone light on these things that
[21:37] were already in the Bible father we know
[21:40] that your little prophet did not come to
[21:43] change the Bible he came to give it
[21:46] clarity he came so that we can see the
[21:49] vision more clearly Lord and then that
[21:52] vision has become a reality in our
[21:55] hearts and our lives in this end time
[21:57] because everything wraps up now and this
[22:00] endtime Lord in the latter days well
[22:04] that was a prophecy at one time but now
[22:08] we are standing in that time Lord make
[22:11] the vision sure we're gonna read your
[22:14] word lord I pray that you just bless us
[22:15] now and take care of us heal the sick be
[22:18] with us as we travel Lord to go see
[22:20] brother Gary Lord just given comfort
[22:22] you're the only one you're the Prince of
[22:24] Peace you're the only one that can give
[22:26] comfort father the pray that you just
[22:28] bless the whole family and give them
[22:29] comfort to all the ones that are that
[22:32] are close to them Lord we pray that you
[22:34] just be with them forgive us of our sins
[22:35] Lord bless us of all of our travels that
[22:37] we're fixing to take and want things
[22:39] that we're doing may give you honor and
[22:41] glory in Jesus name Amen
[22:43] Daniel 921 says yeah well as I was
[22:46] speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel
[22:49] who have seen in the vision now who's
[22:51] Gabriel Gabriel is the announcing angel
[22:53] all right
[22:55] he is the announcing angel he is
[22:57] attached to Israel because remember he
[22:59] comes to Mary and all these different
[23:01] things he does and tells them what's
[23:05] going to happen who had seen in the
[23:08] vision at the beginning being caused to
[23:10] fly swiftly touched me about the time of
[23:12] the evening oblation so we're here in
[23:15] the end time I hope were touched today
[23:19] by the at the evening time and he
[23:22] informed me and talked with me and said
[23:23] Oh Daniel I'm now come forth to give the
[23:26] skill and understanding now what a
[23:29] problem we have in the end time to try
[23:32] to understand Daniel seventy weeks it
[23:34] has not been skill and understanding
[23:35] it's been mass confusion because of what
[23:39] the interpretation of men's theology
[23:42] misinterpreted theology of the property
[23:44] God said but remember he cannot change
[23:47] the Bible God can't even change the
[23:50] Bible alright so we must go back faced
[23:53] final resting place the Prophet said is
[23:55] in the Word of God alright so now let's
[23:57] read this at the beginning of the
[24:00] supplications the commandment came forth
[24:02] and I am come to show thee for thou art
[24:04] greatly beloved therefore understand the
[24:06] matter and consider the vision we're
[24:09] gonna get to that in just a few minutes
[24:10] is how Daniel came to this place that
[24:13] Gabriel could come and meet him and you
[24:15] know why it's the same way you and I
[24:17] meet God Amen verse twenty four seventy
[24:21] weeks are determined upon thy people and
[24:24] upon thy holy city now I want you to
[24:28] underline that in your Bible or put it
[24:30] on your refrigerator
[24:31] Daniel seventy weeks is to two sets two
[24:36] groups people and city got that same n
[24:43] so when we talk about this we're going
[24:45] to talk about people and the city
[24:48] because the city in just a few minutes
[24:50] we're gonna see the city it's laid waste
[24:53] so the city's got to be built back up
[24:55] God will not deal with Israel unless
[24:58] they're in their homeland God will not
[24:59] deal with Israel unless they're in their
[25:02] possession that God's already give them
[25:04] alright but God scattered them and we'll
[25:06] read that in just a minute because of
[25:08] what their transgression so seventy
[25:10] weeks are determined upon by people
[25:12] whose Daniels people Jews Israel and the
[25:18] holy city Jerusalem there's no other the
[25:21] holy city it's not Rome I'm gonna keep
[25:24] you outstanding cuz we won't fall asleep
[25:26] and upon the holy city to finish the
[25:29] transgression that's one to make an end
[25:33] of sins two to make reconciliation
[25:35] for iniquity 3 bringing everlasting
[25:38] righteousness for seal up the vision and
[25:40] prophecy 5 and to anoint the most holy
[25:43] that's six things that we'll get into
[25:45] the six fold purpose a little bit later
[25:47] down the road that's brother Branham
[25:49] remember he told he says six seals
[25:51] finishes Redemption because there's not
[25:53] any redemption in the seventh seal
[25:55] that's Christ himself so with six seals
[25:58] there's redemption with a sixth full
[26:00] purpose there's redemption for Israel
[26:02] because seventy weeks are determinate
[26:04] inside those seven two weeks the six
[26:06] things have to happen
[26:08] they can't happen outside because it
[26:11] says seventy weeks are determined people
[26:12] has to do what six things number 25
[26:15] verse 25 know therefore and understand
[26:18] that from the going forth of the
[26:20] commandment to restore and build
[26:21] jerusalem unto messiah the prince shall
[26:24] be seven weeks and threescore and two
[26:28] weeks the streets shall be built again
[26:31] and the wall even in troublous times and
[26:35] we'll get into that in a little while
[26:36] maybe not this service and after
[26:38] threescore and two weeks shall Messiah
[26:40] be cut off but not for himself who was
[26:43] he cut off for so you and I could come
[26:45] in to graft the wild olive tree into the
[26:50] tree he had to be cut off that all right
[26:53] say Amen but not for himself and the
[26:55] people of the prince that shall come
[26:57] shall destroy the city when no that's
[27:00] Titus in AD 70 because he destroyed the
[27:02] city and the sanctuary and the end
[27:05] thereof shall be with a flood until the
[27:07] end of the war desolations are
[27:08] determined and he's verse 27 and he
[27:13] shall confirm the covenant with many for
[27:15] one week and in the midst of the week he
[27:18] shall cause the sacrifice and the
[27:20] oblation to cease and for the
[27:22] overspreading of abominations he shall
[27:24] make it desolate even until the
[27:27] consummation and that determined shall
[27:29] be poured out upon the desolate and you
[27:32] may be seated in Lord as blessing even
[27:34] until the consummation the property God
[27:36] tells us says Daniel is in prayer and
[27:39] supplication he wants to know what's
[27:42] gonna happen in two years he's desperate
[27:45] what's gonna happen what's what's goin
[27:46] on
[27:47] and God was so gracious he showed him
[27:49] all the way
[27:49] the Millennium that's the consummation
[27:53] Israel's consummation is not your future
[27:55] home folks you got to make that separate
[27:58] our consummation is the future home
[28:01] their consummation is that time period
[28:05] called the millennium that's promised to
[28:07] the Jews it's not promised to you and me
[28:09] we're there on a honeymoon so the
[28:12] consummation is when Israel has come
[28:16] back to a nation and what is going on is
[28:20] the millennium is started and we see
[28:22] that the temple is built and all those
[28:24] things but we'll get to that in a minute
[28:25] so let's start with the history just for
[28:27] a minute for those of you that maybe
[28:28] weren't here or that just for a little
[28:30] background and Jeremiah Jeremiah the
[28:33] Prophet is the one that come to prophesy
[28:37] against Israel because they had done so
[28:40] bad until God said through Jeremiah he
[28:44] sent Jeremiah to Israel to the nation
[28:47] and this is what he said 3 verse 14
[28:51] turned out backsliding children saith
[28:54] the Lord for I am married unto thee now
[28:57] I thought I put in the 1 where he'd
[28:59] given him writing of divorcement but if
[29:01] you're looking last time he actually
[29:03] give Israel a writing of divorcement he
[29:06] put her away for doing this right here
[29:09] for I am married to you and I will take
[29:11] you of a city and to of a family and I
[29:13] will bring you to Zion and I will give
[29:16] you pastors according to my heart which
[29:18] shall feed you with knowledge and
[29:20] understanding what that didn't happen
[29:22] they were all false they were false
[29:26] prophets Jeremiah 3 verse 20 says surely
[29:29] as a wife treacherously departed from
[29:32] her husband so have you dealt
[29:33] treacherously with me o house of Israel
[29:36] saith the Lord so what did he do
[29:38] remember she went out and got polluted
[29:40] and the Bible tells us that you once the
[29:43] wife goes out and she has relations with
[29:44] another man you're not to take her back
[29:46] because the land has become polluted
[29:49] well that's natural in spiritual
[29:52] okay because Israel went out
[29:55] prostituting their self to the other
[29:58] nations which God told them don't do
[29:59] that prostitute it to the other nations
[30:02] well he couldn't take her back his wife
[30:05] because he gave her a writing of
[30:07] divorcement and put her away for the
[30:10] things she had done because she greatly
[30:12] polluted the land and then but now
[30:15] remember he can't break his word his
[30:18] word says I can't forget Israel doesn't
[30:22] matter what I do I cannot forget Israel
[30:24] so he's not gonna forget her but he's
[30:26] gonna take her from one place and she's
[30:29] gonna fall but he's going to bring her
[30:31] back to a place not exactly where she
[30:34] was because he can't marry her anymore
[30:36] but he's gonna bring her up and give her
[30:39] a place because he promised the land he
[30:43] promised them land and the old Abraham
[30:46] everywhere the soul of your feet walks
[30:48] that is your possession all right when I
[30:52] see you and I don't have that we're
[30:55] Gentiles we're nations but Israel has a
[30:58] time Israel has a place that's why this
[31:01] Daniel 7 2 weeks is dates and times and
[31:04] different things because you know what
[31:06] if you look in the Bible in and we'll
[31:08] cover it later on but in Revelations 10
[31:10] verse 6 it says the mighty angel put one
[31:14] foot on land and one foot on sea and put
[31:15] his hand up and said time shall be no
[31:18] longer right but now in Daniel which
[31:23] were read later on not today but later
[31:25] on in Daniel I believe it's in Daniel 10
[31:29] the same guy shows up to them he puts
[31:33] one foot on one way into one foot on sea
[31:35] and raises his hand and said it would be
[31:37] for a time times and a dividing of time
[31:42] time times and a dividing of time three
[31:48] and a half years or 1260 days in the
[31:51] redemption of Israel there buddy got
[31:52] that same M alright that's Bible so they
[31:55] get a time time times in the dividing of
[31:57] times you and I don't
[31:59] we go right off when we're born again we
[32:01] go right straight into eternity ain't
[32:04] that wonderful we go straight into
[32:06] eternity burning in our eternal
[32:10] creatures but Israel has to come back
[32:13] and God's got to bring remember the
[32:15] people and what the city are the land
[32:19] you can say both but that city even
[32:21] Daniel 7 do we he says look going forth
[32:24] the commandment to restore and rebuild
[32:26] Jerusalem to the Messiah shall be seven
[32:27] weeks streets going to each the street
[32:29] shall be built and the wall so you got
[32:31] to get all that together to complete
[32:34] this Daniel 70 weeks but just into the
[32:36] history part we're looking at here in
[32:38] Jeremiah 3 verse 20 says a voice was
[32:40] heard upon the high place weeping a
[32:42] supplication of children of Israel for
[32:44] they have perverted their way and they
[32:47] have forgotten the Lord their God return
[32:50] you backsliding children and I will heal
[32:52] your backsliding behold we come unto
[32:55] thee for thou art the Lord our God
[32:58] Jeremiah 22 return your backsliding
[33:01] children look at that and I will heal
[33:03] your backsliding behold we coming to
[33:05] leave for thou art the Lord our God
[33:07] Jeremiah 25 verse 4 and the Lord has
[33:10] sent unto you all his servants the
[33:11] prophets remember when Jesus stood on
[33:14] earth in other words he said look I sent
[33:16] you prophet after prophet after prophet
[33:20] and you killed every one of them I sent
[33:24] him to you Israel and you killed every
[33:26] one of them and he said in other words
[33:30] now you're gonna kill me I'm the one who
[33:32] sent the prophet I'm the God of the
[33:35] prophets and you're fixing to kill me
[33:36] too but still after even that God's not
[33:39] gonna forget them but he did remember
[33:42] they said let his blood be on us and our
[33:44] children and we'll we'll get to that in
[33:46] just a little while but we'll get back
[33:47] to this background Jeremiah 25 verse 4
[33:49] and the Lord has sent unto you all his
[33:51] servants the prophets rising early and
[33:54] sending them and you have not hearkened
[33:56] nor inclines your ear to hear they said
[34:01] turn you again now every one from his
[34:03] evil way and from the evil of your
[34:05] doings and dwell in the land
[34:08] watch how many times he talks about land
[34:10] that the Lord hath given unto you into
[34:13] your father's for ever and ever
[34:15] and going out after other gods to serve
[34:18] them and to worship them provoked not
[34:19] you ain't provoked me not to anger with
[34:22] the works of your hand and I would do
[34:24] you no hurt yet you have not hearkened
[34:27] unto me saith the Lord
[34:31] of course he knew that that you might
[34:34] provoke me to anger with the works of
[34:36] your hands to your own hurt therefore
[34:37] thus saith the Lord of hosts because you
[34:40] have not heard my words behold I will
[34:43] send and take all the families of the
[34:46] North saith the Lord and Nebuchadnezzar
[34:48] the king of Babylon my servant and will
[34:50] bring them against this land and against
[34:54] the inhabitants thereof and against all
[34:58] these nations round about and will
[34:59] utterly destroy them and make them an
[35:02] astonishment and a hissing and perpetual
[35:05] desolation what about you see Israel
[35:08] comes up under King David and there's
[35:11] peace under David and then Solomon
[35:13] brings in the glory years and man
[35:15] everybody talks about the reign of
[35:17] Solomon and how wonderful it was and all
[35:19] this now when you come to where
[35:21] Jeremiah's fixing to tell them they're
[35:23] getting registers somebody's going to
[35:25] destroy every bit of that I mean down to
[35:28] the dirt what about that that's why it
[35:32] says we'll make them an astonishment how
[35:34] can this people come from this greatness
[35:37] to where where David went in and and you
[35:40] know hardly didn't even lose a battle
[35:42] and then Solomon he just never had a
[35:44] battle he just got them all together and
[35:46] my headpiece everywhere and now jeremiah
[35:49] saying what you're looking at it's
[35:51] fixing to be destroyed utterly destroyed
[35:56] moreover i will take from them the voice
[35:58] of mirth and the voice of gladness the
[36:00] voice of the bridegroom and the voice of
[36:02] the bride so what's he doing he's taking
[36:04] away he's not gonna be their groom
[36:07] anymore he's put him away and then the
[36:12] voice of the bride they're not gonna be
[36:14] the bride anymore he's gonna take it
[36:15] away and give it to you and I the sound
[36:18] of the millstones in the light of the
[36:20] candle in this hole
[36:21] land shall be a desolation and an
[36:26] astonishment and these nations shall
[36:28] serve the king of Babylon
[36:30] seventy years all right so this is we're
[36:33] talking about the seventy years they
[36:35] would be in captivity and it shall come
[36:38] to pass when seventy years are
[36:39] accomplished that I will punish the king
[36:41] of Babylon
[36:42] now remember like what we were talking
[36:45] about before that naturally has already
[36:50] happened listen Daniel was in captivity
[36:54] in the 68 year we'll talk about him will
[36:57] tell us that because he goes back into
[36:59] history he was in captivity in the 68th
[37:01] year he knew there was two more years
[37:03] and he was going to come out well they
[37:04] did come out I think God did punish the
[37:07] kingdom's around them but you got to
[37:10] remember that has another meaning that
[37:13] at the end of the seventy weeks of
[37:15] Daniel that is talking about in just a
[37:17] few minutes ago that after that what's
[37:20] God going to do brother Branham said in
[37:23] the Battle of Armageddon said God is
[37:25] going to come and fight for Israel hey
[37:28] man so he's going to come on the scene
[37:30] after the seventy weeks of Daniel that
[37:32] we're talking about the four hundred and
[37:34] ninety years to restore he's going to
[37:37] come and fight for Israel he's going to
[37:39] punish the king of Babylon in that
[37:40] nation saith the Lord for their iniquity
[37:43] land of the Chaldeans and we'll make it
[37:45] a perpetual desolation alright so now
[37:49] let's go to Leviticus 26 you see it's
[37:52] not just exactly all the reading of this
[37:54] you we look at ourselves and we see that
[37:56] that we're living in part of that seven
[37:59] two-week up ninety seven two weeks in
[38:00] Daniel you're living in a now you're
[38:03] living in that part there in between
[38:05] there that where brother Branham drove
[38:06] the chart where the church ages were fit
[38:08] in are the wild olive tree was was
[38:11] grafted in
[38:12] that's the agent we're in now and we're
[38:14] looking at what we're looking at what's
[38:17] going to happen to Israel now remember
[38:19] some that was talking the other day
[38:21] about somebody going over there from the
[38:24] messaging and you know Israel this and
[38:27] there's will that huh I said well I'm
[38:31] just gonna be real honest with you
[38:33] we don't need to be over there they got
[38:40] their promise and we are not included in
[38:43] it them two prophets are not Gentiles
[38:46] them two prophets or who there's 144,000
[38:50] they're gonna hear those two prophets
[38:51] not not you and me we're gonna be gone I
[38:58] think we need to worry about getting us
[39:00] ready I think we need to worry about
[39:03] getting me and you ready instead of
[39:04] worry about getting them ready because
[39:06] they already have their prophecy and
[39:08] it's already almost all fulfilled all
[39:11] but the 1260 days and we have zero to do
[39:17] with that part now we do have all to get
[39:19] out of here so they'll have their part
[39:20] but we can't change it or make it we
[39:22] can't rush it up the only way we can
[39:25] rush it up is stay here and get
[39:28] ourselves and get a resurrection here
[39:30] and get out of here and get out of the
[39:31] way because the only reason they're not
[39:33] being restored it's because of me and
[39:35] you right now but once we're out of here
[39:40] they got Bible and them two prophets are
[39:44] going to preach them the Bible they're
[39:46] gonna see Christ in them two prophets by
[39:49] the Bible they're not going to go walk
[39:51] over there and say brother Branham said
[39:56] they're not they might tell them how all
[40:02] this fourth Elijah came but they're not
[40:06] gonna go over there and play tapes I'm
[40:09] gonna say nothing else about them
[40:11] Leviticus they're gonna preach there's
[40:12] gonna be two people in skin leviticus
[40:18] 20:6 i that wasn't in my nose Leviticus
[40:21] 26 verse 30 now uh this goes back into
[40:23] the Leviticus this is before Jeremiah
[40:26] was even born this is before Jeremiah
[40:30] was even born
[40:32] Leviticus 26 this is the prophecy of
[40:34] Israel and I will destroy your high
[40:37] places and cut down your images and cast
[40:40] your carcasses upon the carcasses of
[40:42] your idols and my soul shall abhor you
[40:45] and I will make your city's waste and
[40:47] bring your sanctuaries unto desolation
[40:49] you've heard that word before and I will
[40:52] not smell the savour of your sweet
[40:54] odours and I will bring the land into
[40:59] desolation and your enemies which dwell
[41:02] therein shall be astonished at it now
[41:05] this is way before Jeremiah come on the
[41:06] scene and I will scatter you among the
[41:10] heathen and we'll draw out a sword after
[41:13] you and your land shall be desolate and
[41:16] your cities waste everybody got that
[41:19] same man all right this is this is
[41:21] Leviticus this is Moses talking to them
[41:24] all right and then shall the land enjoy
[41:28] her Sabbath's for as long as it lies
[41:30] desolate and you'd be in your enemy's
[41:33] land even then shall the land rest and
[41:36] enjoy their Sabbath's member I told you
[41:37] before Israel never celebrated that
[41:41] Golden Jubilee they never let the land
[41:43] rest now they had their seven-year
[41:45] cycles but they never let that land rest
[41:47] like God told them to let it rest God
[41:49] says I'd if you're not gonna do it I'm
[41:51] gonna do it for you I'm gonna scatter
[41:53] you all over the world he did he
[41:56] dispersed the Jews all over the world
[41:58] but he promised he'd bring them back
[42:00] what to that one spot that's why brother
[42:03] Branham was so happy being that fourth
[42:06] Elijah he was so happy to see those even
[42:10] in his day all coming back to the
[42:12] homeland
[42:12] he knew God was fixing to do something
[42:15] ma'am but he had to do it to me and you
[42:17] first he had to get us back and redeem
[42:21] us before he could do anything with
[42:23] Israel all right then shall the land
[42:26] enjoy her Sabbath's I read that as long
[42:28] as it lies desolate it shall rest
[42:31] because it did not rest in your Sabbath
[42:34] when you dwelt upon it in other words
[42:36] God said if you're not gonna do it I'm
[42:38] gonna do it for you I'm just gonna run
[42:40] you out of your own land let us let the
[42:41] land rest then I'll bring you back and
[42:44] upon them that are left alive of you I
[42:46] will send a faintness in their hearts in
[42:48] the land of their enemies now this was
[42:51] mighty Israel
[42:53] under Joshua and Caleb and David and
[42:55] Solomon and all these great leaders that
[42:58] just wherever they went they just took
[43:00] over but not anymore because of what
[43:04] they did and upon them that are left
[43:06] alive of you will I send a faintness in
[43:08] their hearts into the lands of their
[43:10] enemies and the sounds of a shaking leaf
[43:13] shall chase them while what about these
[43:15] great mighty people now they're shaken
[43:19] if a leaf just well and they shall flee
[43:25] as flee from a sword and they shall fall
[43:27] when none pursue a--the and they shall
[43:31] fall one upon another as if it were
[43:32] before a sword when none pursue it then
[43:34] you shall have no power to stand before
[43:37] your enemies this is what sin will do
[43:39] for you and you shall perish among the
[43:42] heathen they're dying out there and the
[43:45] land of your enemies shall eat you up
[43:47] and they that are left of you shall pine
[43:50] away in their iniquity in your enemy's
[43:52] lands and also in the iniquities of
[43:54] their fathers shall they pine away with
[43:57] them so in other words at this point in
[44:00] time of Leviticus Moses is prophesying
[44:02] that they're gonna fall they're going to
[44:04] ruin they're going to be desolate and
[44:07] Israel when when Jeremiah prophesized
[44:10] but now when Daniel comes up when
[44:12] Daniels inside that captivity he's not
[44:15] in the land but he knows that temples
[44:18] laid waste because of what scripture
[44:20] says back in Jeremiah look in second
[44:22] chronicles 36 verse 17 said therefore he
[44:26] brought upon them the king of the
[44:27] Chaldees who slew their young men with
[44:29] the sword in the house of their
[44:30] sanctuary and had no compassion upon
[44:33] young men our maiden old men or him that
[44:35] stood for age he gave them all into his
[44:38] hand and all the vessels of the house of
[44:41] God great and small in the treasures of
[44:44] the house of the Lord what do you think
[44:48] who's got the things now who's got all
[44:50] the who's got all the tools and the
[44:52] instruments and menorah and the Holy of
[44:55] Holies yeah the Titus was a Roman
[44:59] general when Titus came in according to
[45:01] the prophecy he stole all that stuff and
[45:04] it's laying in the Vatican right now
[45:06] somewhere up underneath the Vatican it's
[45:08] laying there that's why he shall make a
[45:12] covenant with many for one week hey I
[45:14] got your stuff if you'll do what I said
[45:17] I'll leave you alone here I'll give you
[45:19] this stuff back till that's what
[45:21] happened here because they brought it
[45:23] all back again when they restored the
[45:24] house restore the house restored the
[45:26] temple and built the walls evil in
[45:29] trouble as times when got to Ezra
[45:30] Nehemiah yep because that's what they
[45:32] did they built it all put it back
[45:33] together but remember it didn't do him
[45:38] any good because Christ came on the
[45:40] scene about 300 years after the 400
[45:42] years after that and he wasn't God
[45:45] wasn't there in the temple anymore he
[45:46] was in that temple of of Jesus Christ
[45:48] therefore he brought upon the king of
[45:50] the Chaldees who slew their young men
[45:51] with sword in the house of their
[45:53] sanctuary
[45:53] I had no compassion upon younger men are
[45:55] made an old man or him that's to phrase
[45:57] he gave them all into his hand and all
[45:59] the vessels of the house of God great
[46:01] and small and the treasures of the house
[46:03] of the Lord think about it go back and
[46:05] read in Solomon how much gold they had
[46:08] in that temple that was just lining the
[46:11] walls and the chairs and the millions of
[46:16] dollars probably at that time would have
[46:18] been billions of dollars of gold it's
[46:21] all gone now and all the vessels of the
[46:24] house of God great and small the
[46:25] treasures of the house of the Lord and
[46:27] the treasures of the King and of his
[46:28] Prince's all these he brought to Babylon
[46:32] and they burnt the house of God and
[46:35] break down the wall of Jerusalem now see
[46:38] to fulfill the prophecy in Daniel 9
[46:40] those walls had to be knocked down and
[46:45] break down the wall Jerusalem because
[46:50] remember if you break somebody's wall
[46:51] down you've took away their
[46:54] fortification you've took away their
[46:55] their safety zone so that's what that
[46:59] wall was so they just utterly just
[47:01] didn't just just
[47:01] or the temple they knocked the walls
[47:03] down all right and burn all the palaces
[47:07] therein with fire and destroyed all the
[47:09] goodly vessels thereof and them that
[47:13] escaped from the sword carried he away
[47:15] to Babylon where they were servants to
[47:18] him and his sons until the reign of the
[47:20] king of Persia now what we're going to
[47:22] do is we're going to get into that
[47:23] because in Daniel chapter 9 the first
[47:26] verse says in the first year of Darius
[47:28] the son of a Soros there comes your
[47:31] Persians your Medes and Persians come in
[47:33] and under Daris is rule but we'll get to
[47:35] that in just a second to fulfill the
[47:38] word of the Lord by the mouth of
[47:40] jeremiah now this is chronicles remember
[47:42] until the land had enjoyed her Sabbath's
[47:45] for as long as she laid desolate she
[47:49] keep kept Sabbath to fulfil threescore
[47:52] which is what three times two it's three
[47:54] times twenty sixty and ten make seventy
[47:59] I kind of said that wrong the other day
[48:01] and Richard yeah somebody's did it I did
[48:05] six times two it's not 16 it's not three
[48:07] times two it's three times twenty three
[48:09] times 20 is 60 and then ten more is 70
[48:13] so in 70 years so now we also looked we
[48:16] see that that you say well what is all
[48:19] this I want you to understand one thing
[48:20] for sure the history of how Israel fell
[48:23] is the history of how you fell read
[48:27] every bit of that we went after idols we
[48:29] didn't do what God said we didn't go to
[48:31] the house of God with iswait we began
[48:33] what I'm telling you this is an allegory
[48:36] not of just what them poor children of
[48:38] Israel well you were - you were the same
[48:40] way but God made a promise to bring you
[48:44] back
[48:47] and thus accepting Christ put him in our
[48:51] heart so we get it a little bit before
[48:57] everybody else but we'll get into that
[48:58] in just a minute
[48:58] Genesis 29 verse 16 we were talking
[49:01] about brother Tim and I were talking
[49:03] about this and he made a good point he
[49:05] said brother wait if we don't when we're
[49:07] preaching he said if we take
[49:11] this people he's talking about his
[49:14] congregation and then the message
[49:15] believers he said if we take them to a
[49:18] man other than Jesus Christ when we get
[49:20] finished preaching he said we have not
[49:22] done our job we have not done our job if
[49:26] we can't show Christ in everything that
[49:28] we do and everything it doesn't matter
[49:30] how many quotes we read or don't read
[49:32] all right because face final resting
[49:35] places in the Word of God the prophet of
[49:37] God and there is no quote that brother
[49:39] Branham makes that changes the Bible if
[49:43] not he was not a word prophet in that
[49:44] see that's why that's why people
[49:46] attacked Daniel seventy weeks when they
[49:49] get ready to leave the message the first
[49:50] thing they do well brother man was wrong
[49:52] and Daniel said in two weeks you can't
[49:53] believe what he said you remember what
[49:54] Geoff Jenkins you know he gets up and
[49:55] says talk about the cloud and talk he
[49:57] starts discrediting all these things but
[50:01] if we can put it in the Bible it's not
[50:05] discrediting they just didn't understand
[50:07] what he said that's what we're trying to
[50:10] see by what we understand and we're
[50:13] gonna read here in a minute I Daniel
[50:14] understood by books and that's what we
[50:17] do we understand by 66 books that God
[50:20] wrote infallible Word of God brother
[50:23] Bram said he was not infallible and I
[50:25] agree he's a human just like me and you
[50:27] but that word of God is infallible the
[50:29] Holy Ghost inside of yous infallible
[50:33] what makes what makes us is we are we're
[50:36] not infallible than this and our human
[50:39] brain we run things through our filter
[50:41] sometimes and it doesn't come out right
[50:43] but what listen but look we were talking
[50:47] about this the other day there it we
[50:50] sometimes we dwell on all the wrong and
[50:52] all the wrong doctrines there is a right
[50:54] one and there is a person our persons a
[50:59] fivefold ministry that has the perfect
[51:01] interpretation just like brother Branham
[51:03] I couldn't get it without him could not
[51:08] get it without him greatest men walk on
[51:11] this earth beside Jesus Christ the
[51:14] closest man to walk besides Jesus Christ
[51:17] it's William Maher and brento but he's
[51:20] not my Savior he's not my god
[51:23] and he's not my pastor that's my pastor
[51:27] sitting right there
[51:28] and you know what if you'll get a
[51:29] revelation to that you might go
[51:31] somewhere but if we can't take it back
[51:37] to the Bible them in brother Tim if you
[51:38] can't take it back to the Bible then
[51:40] that's what they don't do that you see
[51:41] these people like the Jenkins and all
[51:43] them first thing you do they say well I
[51:44] read it in a Bible this is awanen
[51:46] brother Brent says it's this way they
[51:47] just don't have a revelation I don't
[51:48] have the Holy Ghost you leave this
[51:51] message and say it's wrong after walking
[51:53] for Hebrews six is what coming to the
[51:56] knowledge of the truth if you turn it
[51:57] away there's no sacrifice for that
[52:01] you're just unless you repent I I wish
[52:05] and I hope that brother Jeff and some of
[52:07] them repent and in turn but there is a
[52:10] place you can go too far and we just
[52:13] pray that nobody does but still there is
[52:15] listen there's a surety that this
[52:17] message is right and somebody through a
[52:21] five fold ministry is going to hear it
[52:23] and come to perfection that's what the
[52:25] Bible says my brother Dale said I see
[52:31] where God put it in and it would take
[52:32] five fold ministry to perfect his things
[52:34] I want somebody to show me where he took
[52:36] it out you can't take it out so let's do
[52:39] this real quick in Genesis we'll be done
[52:41] but before 3:30 Genesis will be done
[52:44] before five o'clock Genesis 29 verse 16
[52:49] brother Branham comes up and he's look
[52:51] at you looking you reading the book and
[52:53] he says one week equals seven years you
[52:57] go how do you get that well you didn't
[53:00] just pull it out his hat and it wasn't a
[53:04] revelation that wasn't already in the
[53:05] word so we go to Genesis 29 16 and Laban
[53:09] had two daughters the name of the elder
[53:11] was Leah now remember leah was the older
[53:14] so we have two we type her with Israel
[53:16] because Israel is the older alright kind
[53:20] of like with
[53:22] Ruth and Naomi Naomi being the older
[53:26] when Ruth had the baby she gave it back
[53:28] to Naomi which is type of us giving the
[53:31] message back to Israel
[53:33] so anyway Leah was tender eyed but
[53:35] Rachael was beautiful and well favored
[53:37] now remember you got to remember one
[53:40] thing just like Abraham which was his
[53:44] daddy is coming in here we watched
[53:46] Abraham comes isaac isaac was a promise
[53:49] son had to come through Rebecca I mean I
[53:51] think had to come through Sarah okay the
[53:55] break I'm mixing these up had to come
[53:57] through Sarah not through Hagar so the
[54:01] promised son of Jacob Jacob had to come
[54:04] in and bring Rachel was the one that
[54:07] brought the last two children right when
[54:09] Benjamin and Joseph which Joseph being
[54:13] the perfect type of Christ so Joseph
[54:16] wanted her Jacob wanted her first Leah
[54:19] was tender eyed but Rachel was beautiful
[54:21] and well favored and Jacob loved Rachel
[54:22] and said I will serve these seven years
[54:25] for Rachel a younger daughter and Laban
[54:28] the con man said it is better than I
[54:30] give her to thee then that I should give
[54:32] her to another man abide with me now in
[54:34] laymen's mind he was not going to give
[54:38] him Rachel because the scripture said
[54:45] way back over here that the elder
[54:48] supposed to get married first yield you
[54:50] give the elder daughter first right so
[54:52] Jacobs working for Rachel for seven
[54:54] years and I don't know it must've been a
[54:57] real dark night because he got Leah
[55:01] sometimes I wonder about that he worked
[55:04] seven years for one girl and then all of
[55:06] a sudden he wakes up the next morning
[55:07] and there's the sister but Israel had to
[55:12] come in he had to come in to get him to
[55:14] be with Israel first before he could
[55:16] take Rachel so Jacob served seven years
[55:19] for Rachel and they seemed them to him
[55:20] but a few days for the love he had for
[55:23] her same way with God he's he's went
[55:26] through 2000 years of being separated
[55:28] from me and you but he wants to see us
[55:30] face to face and man he wants to see his
[55:33] bride he don't want to come through a
[55:35] filter of his
[55:36] and just hearing your voice and
[55:38] communing spiritually he wants to stand
[55:40] in front of it he wants to be able to be
[55:42] right there with us
[55:43] same way with Jacob but now watch
[55:45] Genesis 29 verse 27 says fulfil her week
[55:50] and we will give the also this this also
[55:54] for the service which thou shalt serve
[55:56] with me at seven other years he had
[55:59] already conned him and got Israel Leah
[56:02] so now Jacobs got to work seven more
[56:04] years or seven more church ages to get
[56:07] Rachel his real true bride because
[56:10] remember there were seven church ages in
[56:12] the Old Testament and seven churches in
[56:13] the New Testament all right but fulfill
[56:16] for a week and Jacob did so and
[56:18] fulfilled her week which is what seven
[56:22] years
[56:24] one week equals seven years so you can
[56:28] rock that if you want to in your top of
[56:30] your Bible rhythm there Daniel now one
[56:32] week equals seven years all right
[56:35] everybody got that same man fulfill her
[56:38] a week so he fulfilled her seven years
[56:41] and finally got Rachel in verse 28 right
[56:46] so now let's go and let's look at how we
[56:51] title this today Daniel's confession his
[56:56] brother Nell has been preaching in many
[56:58] times we say the same thing get closer
[57:00] to God pray and read your Bible it's
[57:04] kind of hard to do but in Daniel 9
[57:08] Daniel has been he grew up in the
[57:12] captivity he had been 68 years away from
[57:16] home he had been 68 years away from
[57:19] where God showed him where the promised
[57:21] land was so what does Daniel say now
[57:24] look Daniel 9 verse 1 says in the first
[57:26] year of Darius the son of a source of
[57:28] the seat of the Medes which was made
[57:30] king over the realm of the Chaldeans and
[57:32] the first year of his reign I Daniel
[57:35] understood by books the number of years
[57:38] where of the word of the Lord came to
[57:40] Jeremiah the Prophet that he would
[57:42] accomplish 70 years in the desolations
[57:44] of Israel everybody got that
[57:48] I Daniel understood by books you and I
[57:52] understand by sixty-six books and eleven
[57:55] hundred sermons we have been taught just
[57:59] like Daniel and will read your quote
[58:00] where brother Bret says we are reading
[58:02] the exact same thing tonight that Daniel
[58:05] read four thousand years ago cuz he was
[58:08] reading Jeremiah and brother branham's
[58:10] talking about reading Jeremiah you and I
[58:12] reading the same word will read it here
[58:15] in just a minute but this is Daniels
[58:16] prayer that brings Gabriel on the scene
[58:21] so he can talk to him same way with you
[58:24] and I we must confess watch him confess
[58:28] and I set my face unto the Lord God to
[58:33] seat by prayer and supplication prayer
[58:36] and reading your Bible with fasting and
[58:38] sackcloth and ashes and I prayed unto
[58:41] the Lord my God and made my confession
[58:43] now look have you ever thought about
[58:49] this Daniel what was he confessing he
[58:56] did everything God told him to do man
[59:00] told him to quit worshiping he threw the
[59:03] curtains back look toward Israel and
[59:07] prayed to God to Jehovah so yeah he was
[59:12] praying for himself but he was also
[59:14] making confession for the whole of
[59:15] Israel and made my confession said O
[59:21] Lord the Great and dreadful God keeping
[59:23] the covenant of mercy to them that love
[59:24] him and to them that keep his
[59:26] Commandments we have sinned and have
[59:30] committed iniquity and have done
[59:32] wickedly and have rebelled even by
[59:34] departing from the precept and from thy
[59:37] judgment neither have we hearkened unto
[59:40] thy servants the prophets
[59:42] listen David Daniel is sitting there
[59:44] reading Jeremiah and Jeremiah saying I
[59:47] through God God through Jeremiah said I
[59:49] have sent you this person this person
[59:52] this person
[59:55] God has sent us preachers preachers and
[1:00:00] more preachers what are we doing with it
[1:00:05] neither have we hearken to the servants
[1:00:07] the prophets which spake in thy name to
[1:00:10] our Kings our Prince's our fathers and
[1:00:13] to all the people of the land Oh Lord
[1:00:16] righteousness belongs unto thee but into
[1:00:19] us confusion of face as at this day and
[1:00:26] I say that that's that's true now
[1:00:31] there's more confusion in this message
[1:00:33] than anywhere else sorry to say because
[1:00:37] of why turn down true message heard a
[1:00:43] preacher got up the other day and was
[1:00:44] preaching and he he looked out in the
[1:00:48] congregation he said we've had enough
[1:00:49] teaching well it's kind of like somebody
[1:00:53] was saying today I told that and since I
[1:00:55] think it was Aaron he said well he's cut
[1:00:57] himself off from being perfected because
[1:00:59] teaching is part of the fivefold
[1:01:01] ministry I don't care what well I don't
[1:01:03] care what you what your problem is with
[1:01:05] teaching you know what you know why you
[1:01:06] don't like teaching did you like to go

[1:01:50] and we'll be done you look at teaching
[1:01:54] there's there's teachers listen my
[1:01:56] sister teaches kindergarten to third
[1:01:58] grade kindergarten now she has a so

[1:02:17] Roberts maybe but dr. Anna why because
[1:02:23] she came to a place but now dr. Roberts
[1:02:25] and I'm gonna say it because I said it

[1:02:42] shut up quit this quit that you gotta go
[1:02:44] to the bathroom what do you mean you see
[1:02:46] what I mean there's teachers of
[1:02:47] different levels that's what I'm saying
[1:02:49] you've got kindergarteners but you hope
[1:02:51] they come up to who are there in college
[1:02:53] but they were all the teachers or
[1:02:55] teachers but you got kindergarten

[1:03:04] bye in the message of the hour you've
[1:03:06] got teeth you're being taught it doesn't
[1:03:08] matter if you're listening to an
[1:03:09] evangelist but for somebody to be so
[1:03:12] narrow-minded to say we don't need
[1:03:13] teaching anymore what the problem is
[1:03:15] it's just like I told y'all about 20
[1:03:17] years ago and I'll say it again
[1:03:21] we haven't got out of Pentecost yet I'm
[1:03:25] not talking about 1906 I'm not talking
[1:03:28] about 1830 I'm talking about Pentecost
[1:03:32] doctrine a Pentecost
[1:03:35] so where were we Oh Daniel nearby books
[1:03:39] let's get finished with this verse seven
[1:03:44] Oh Lord righteousness belongeth unto
[1:03:46] lead but unto us confusion of faith
[1:03:48] that's what to me teaching takes care of
[1:03:51] confusion how many of you been in this
[1:03:52] church that weren't in this church
[1:03:54] before come started coming to this
[1:03:56] church and you thought you were confused
[1:03:58] about certain things but now you're not
[1:04:00] confused well I got my hand up I turn
[1:04:02] the camera around because there's
[1:04:03] another miracle okay if you hadn't if
[1:04:07] you don't raise your hand you got a
[1:04:08] problem what are you doing here you're
[1:04:13] just sitting here like a knot on a log
[1:04:15] or what listen it's the end time it's
[1:04:19] the time of the evening oblation we have
[1:04:22] come to a place to where it's gonna be
[1:04:24] remember they love Jesus when he was
[1:04:27] prayer lining healing the sick making
[1:04:31] more bread but when he said I and my
[1:04:36] father are one they went away unless you
[1:04:41] eat my flesh and drink my blood what
[1:04:43] doctrine he started preaching doctrine
[1:04:46] he started teaching the people Nicodemus
[1:04:50] you must be born again Nicodemus is so
[1:04:53] blown away says ma guy go get back my
[1:04:55] mamma's wool he shouldn't know a little
[1:04:59] bit about that but he didn't is his eyes
[1:05:02] were blind Oh Lord to us belong this
[1:05:05] confusion of face verse eight to our
[1:05:07] kings into our princes and to our
[1:05:09] fathers because we have sinned against
[1:05:11] thee to the Lord our God belongs mercy
[1:05:13] and forgiveness though we have rebelled
[1:05:16] against him
[1:05:19] neither have we obeyed the voice of the
[1:05:21] Lord our God to walk in his laws which
[1:05:23] he set before us by his servants the
[1:05:26] prophets Daniel knew they were doing
[1:05:29] things wrong he knew that they were
[1:05:32] doing things wrong and he was what
[1:05:34] confessing verse 11 and yea all Israel
[1:05:37] have transgressed the law even by
[1:05:40] departing that they may not obey thy
[1:05:42] voice
[1:05:43] therefore the curse is poured upon us
[1:05:46] and the oat that is written into law
[1:05:49] Moses we read that over in Leviticus and
[1:05:52] the law of Moses the servant of God
[1:05:54] because we have sinned against him and
[1:05:56] he hath confirmed his words which he
[1:05:58] spake against us and against our judges
[1:06:01] that judged us by bringing upon us a
[1:06:03] great evil for under the whole heaven
[1:06:05] have not been done as has been done upon
[1:06:07] Jerusalem as it is written in the law
[1:06:10] Moses all this evil that's come upon us
[1:06:13] yet made we not our prayer before the
[1:06:15] Lord our God that we might turn from our
[1:06:18] iniquities and understand that truth
[1:06:21] therefore hath the Lord I hope you
[1:06:23] thinking about this for yourself
[1:06:25] therefore hath the Lord watched upon the
[1:06:27] evil and brought it upon us for the Lord
[1:06:29] our God is righteous in all his works
[1:06:31] which he do it for we obeyed not his
[1:06:33] voice and now O Lord our God that has
[1:06:38] brought that people forth out of the
[1:06:40] land of Egypt with a mighty hand and
[1:06:43] have gotten the renowned as at this day
[1:06:46] we have sinned we have done wickedly Oh
[1:06:49] Lord according to all the righteousness
[1:06:52] I beseech thee let down anger and thy
[1:06:55] fury be turned away from where the city
[1:06:59] Jerusalem the holy mountain because of
[1:07:03] for our sins because remember the temple
[1:07:07] didn't sin Jerusalem the city didn't sin
[1:07:10] the walls didn't sin but the people
[1:07:14] sinned and it caused the walls that same
[1:07:17] way was with Adam Adam's sin caused the
[1:07:19] fall caused everything to happen and
[1:07:21] everything fell below it okay everybody
[1:07:23] got that
[1:07:24] then what as Redemption has got to bring
[1:07:26] all that back so in the 70 weeks of
[1:07:28] Daniel remember there has to be a people
[1:07:31] restored
[1:07:32] and the city both you got two things you
[1:07:37] got to deal with all right that's what
[1:07:38] the people of the message get it wrong
[1:07:40] it's got to be the city and the people
[1:07:42] because the Bible says so I Bessie see
[1:07:46] that not anger and not fury be turned
[1:07:48] away from thy city Jerusalem the holy
[1:07:50] mountain because of our sins that their
[1:07:52] sins is what knocked the wall down and
[1:07:54] for the iniquities of our fathers
[1:07:57] Jerusalem and thy people Jerusalem and
[1:08:02] our people are become a reproach for all
[1:08:05] that are about us now therefore o our
[1:08:08] God hear the prayer of thy servant and
[1:08:10] his supplications and caused my face to
[1:08:13] shine upon thy sanctuary that is
[1:08:17] desolate Daniel knew God wasn't in that
[1:08:20] temple because the temple was gone
[1:08:23] temple very late wife's the temple was
[1:08:26] gone they don't walk knock the walls
[1:08:27] down everything but Oh God in climbed on
[1:08:34] ear and hear opened our eyes and behold
[1:08:37] our desolations and the city which is
[1:08:41] called by thy name for we do not present
[1:08:44] our supplication before thee for our
[1:08:47] righteousness but for thy great mercy O
[1:08:49] Lord here Oh Lord forgive our Lord
[1:08:53] hearkening do defer not for that own
[1:08:56] sake oh my god for thy city and thy
[1:08:58] people are called by thy name and while
[1:09:02] I was speaking
[1:09:03] now watch the all that Daniel from verse
[1:09:06] one to nineteen that was Daniel praying
[1:09:09] to God for him and his people saying
[1:09:14] Lord come back do something we're
[1:09:18] desolate we're sitting here where are
[1:09:20] your people brother Branham I like what
[1:09:22] he said he said you know what God likes
[1:09:24] for you to remind him of his promises
[1:09:26] God likes for you to remind him of what
[1:09:28] he said he was going to do it doesn't
[1:09:31] hurt his feelings but he knew Daniel was
[1:09:33] going to do this that's why you see
[1:09:35] Daniel you're so greatly loved because
[1:09:36] your supplication has done this right
[1:09:39] here and while I was speaking and
[1:09:41] praying and confessing my sin and the
[1:09:43] sin of my people Israel and
[1:09:45] is any my supplication before the Lord
[1:09:46] my god for the holy mountain of my God
[1:09:48] which is what Jerusalem yeah while I was
[1:09:51] speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel
[1:09:54] who had seen in the vision at the
[1:09:55] beginning being caused to fly swiftly
[1:09:58] touched me about the time of the evening
[1:10:00] oblation and he informed me and taught
[1:10:03] lament said Oh Daniel I am now come
[1:10:06] forth to give the skill and
[1:10:09] understanding not confusion at the
[1:10:12] beginning of life supplication the
[1:10:13] commandment came forth and I am come to
[1:10:16] show thee for thou art greatly beloved
[1:10:18] therefore understand the matter and
[1:10:21] consider the vision so listen this is
[1:10:25] Daniel is pinning this but it's Gabriel
[1:10:27] that said seventy weeks are determined
[1:10:30] upon thy people so he's talking to
[1:10:33] Daniel thy people and on thy City
[1:10:35] Gabriel is bringing this vision to
[1:10:39] Daniel alright and Daniel accepts it and
[1:10:43] continues on but now let's read these
[1:10:44] two quotes and then we'll be finished
[1:10:45] right here Gabriel's instructions to
[1:10:48] Daniel we'll get back to that when we
[1:10:50] come back next Sunday first quote 1961
[1:10:57] 7:30 this is the first sermon of the
[1:11:01] three part sermon their brother Bram
[1:11:02] preached that everybody says it's so
[1:11:05] confusing
[1:11:05] he sure spent wasted a lot of time if it
[1:11:08] was confusing God don't waste time folks
[1:11:11] he sends a prophet he sends a prophet
[1:11:14] for a purpose amen now there's our
[1:11:18] lesson for the next three four or five
[1:11:19] meetings he just read the scripture of
[1:11:21] whatever the Lord will reveal seventy of
[1:11:23] weeks now last doc if you will tonight
[1:11:26] to put up my board there now remember
[1:11:29] this is Gabriel's instructions the next
[1:11:31] night or that night he preached the six
[1:11:33] fold purpose and then the Sunday after
[1:11:36] that he preached the 70th week y'all
[1:11:39] understand what he freaks he preached
[1:11:41] the seventy weeks he preached the 70th
[1:11:43] week on that third Sunday's everybody
[1:11:45] got that look in your book the book says
[1:11:48] the 70th week not the 70 weeks the 70th
[1:11:51] week all right so he brings two parts
[1:11:53] Gabriel instructions of Daniel the sixth
[1:11:55] full purpose and the 70th week everybody
[1:11:58] got that say man
[1:11:59] I want that to be clear because it's
[1:12:01] going to help you to put up my board
[1:12:04] there so that I will be able to mark it
[1:12:06] out I don't want you to miss it now
[1:12:09] you've got to study with me and study
[1:12:12] deep or you'll miss it you know they're
[1:12:16] all quiet nobody said a man study deeper
[1:12:20] you'll miss it and I want to draw it out
[1:12:24] here on the blackboard and he did and we
[1:12:26] have the original picture that he drew
[1:12:28] that was confirmed by George Smith that
[1:12:31] that's exactly the drawing that Rebecca
[1:12:33] drew for brother Branham mm-hmm so we
[1:12:35] got all that and we also have a drawing
[1:12:38] that brother Branham drew on a napkin at
[1:12:41] a restaurant the day or two after he
[1:12:43] preached hitting this the exact same
[1:12:44] drawing so folks we ain't go making you
[1:12:46] drawing the one he drew was right all
[1:12:50] right but that's what he's talking about
[1:12:51] right here and I want to draw it out
[1:12:53] here on the blackboard and then you
[1:12:55] bring your pencils and paper and write
[1:12:56] down these dates these times and all
[1:12:59] about it you reading now the seventy of
[1:13:01] weeks begins now get this after the
[1:13:03] church is taken out huh what ho brother
[1:13:11] Adam be careful now the seventy of weeks
[1:13:14] begins after the church is taken out
[1:13:18] because remember 70 weeks
[1:13:23] seventy weeks we'll talk about a little
[1:13:27] bit later it's all condensed into one
[1:13:29] week we'll read you the quote where
[1:13:33] brother brian says 72 weeks equals seven
[1:13:34] years cuz that's what he just said now
[1:13:39] when he drew his chart because I'm gonna
[1:13:41] tell you something when you see the
[1:13:42] chart seventy weeks started back in four
[1:13:45] or 606 BC before Christ before the
[1:13:49] church agents began before the rapture
[1:13:51] takes place you've got to be careful to
[1:13:53] remember what he's talking about
[1:13:56] now the seventy of weeks begins where's
[1:14:00] that all right - mines sectioned off now
[1:14:06] the seventy of weeks begins now get this
[1:14:08] after the church is taken out now
[1:14:11] everybody understand that say man the
[1:14:13] congregation flies they meant I do not
[1:14:15] believe they knew what he was talking
[1:14:16] about they still don't now after the
[1:14:20] church is taken out and we'll explain
[1:14:22] that which I want you to hold that I
[1:14:23] want you to kind of chew it and then
[1:14:26] regurgitate it when we come back
[1:14:28] revelation 6 to 1 to go to 71 there you
[1:14:33] go revelation 6:1 - revelations 19 21 is
[1:14:35] connected with the seventy of weeks
[1:14:37] therefore we must stop and explain
[1:14:39] before we go further we must stop and
[1:14:42] explain the why these seventy of weeks
[1:14:44] because if you don't you'll miss the
[1:14:46] seals you'll miss the trumpets you'll
[1:14:47] miss the vials plagues three unclean
[1:14:49] spirits like frogs three woes casting
[1:14:52] out of the Red Dragons woman in the Sun
[1:14:53] you'll miss it all if you don't because
[1:14:56] it takes place right in their 70th week
[1:15:04] you believe that say man you don't
[1:15:07] understand it failed me because some
[1:15:11] don't and that's okay but we're gonna
[1:15:13] explain it because you know what he's a
[1:15:15] prophet and he's right I have no problem
[1:15:19] with that
[1:15:20] I have no problem what he just said I
[1:15:22] don't get all nervous because that's in
[1:15:25] the Bible we leave on 6:1 come back in
[1:15:29] 21 not even but look that's right here
[1:15:32] real quick that's where it takes place
[1:15:35] in that 70th week now the prophet Daniel
[1:15:40] has been in babbling for 68 years you
[1:15:42] who wants to run reference back and save
[1:15:44] yourself some of the time that I've had
[1:15:46] to looking it up 68 years he went into
[1:15:48] captivity in BC 606 and when the vision
[1:15:53] came to him was BC 538 538 from 606
[1:15:57] leave 68 68 years he had been in Babylon
[1:16:00] amongst heathens and still has the
[1:16:02] victory amen we can't stay an hour in
[1:16:07] one place he says Gabriel I mean Daniel
[1:16:10] lasted sixty-eight years kept the
[1:16:12] victory and didn't even have the holy go
[1:16:14] cuz he didn't even have the baptism holy
[1:16:17] goes like you got and he still kept the
[1:16:21] victory you know what he did what God
[1:16:23] said now let's read number two and then
[1:16:26] we'll quit right here Gables instruction
[1:16:29] paragraph 113 this is the one most
[1:16:32] important scriptures in the Bible Wow
[1:16:35] brother Bram said at one time he said
[1:16:37] revelations 5 is the most sublime
[1:16:39] scripture in the Bible because it talks
[1:16:41] about Redemption but he said this is the
[1:16:43] one most important scriptures in the
[1:16:45] Bible what does it do it tells the
[1:16:47] closing of the Jewish nation the Jewish
[1:16:49] people this scripture the seventy of
[1:16:52] weeks it discloses and tells exactly
[1:16:55] from the time that Daniel started there
[1:16:58] until the end of the consummation it's
[1:17:01] one of the greatest timepieces how many
[1:17:03] heard me say if you want to know what
[1:17:04] day it is look at the calendar if you
[1:17:06] want to know what time we're living in
[1:17:08] watch the Jews that's right
[1:17:10] they're God's calendar taken from right
[1:17:12] here any theologian any Bible scholar
[1:17:15] any
[1:17:15] we'll tell you that this is the
[1:17:17] timepiece the Jews now what time we got
[1:17:20] we're just people hot and everything you
[1:17:22] know fainting
[1:17:23] it has nothing to do with the Gentiles
[1:17:27] the seven seals seven plagues seven whoa
[1:17:30] seven trumpets has not one thing to do
[1:17:37] the Gentile church will be in glory at
[1:17:39] that time don't have nothing to do with
[1:17:42] us the Gentile church it only deals with
[1:17:45] Israel down Daniel by people and
[1:17:47] Jerusalem
[1:17:48] and it discloses the facts that God
[1:17:52] deals only with the Jews when they are
[1:17:54] in their homeland hallelujah you say oh
[1:17:58] my lord what do we fix and get into it's
[1:18:02] clear to me I know exactly what he's
[1:18:05] talking about I had a good teacher which
[1:18:09] taught this in 1974 so this is old news
[1:18:12] some people can't get it right now 50
[1:18:15] something years later but it has nothing
[1:18:18] to do with the Gentiles seven seals
[1:18:19] seven seals well the natural part of it
[1:18:23] no but the spiritual part we get all
[1:18:25] that spiritual part we don't get no
[1:18:27] plagues literal plays we don't get the
[1:18:31] wolves we don't get the seven trumpets
[1:18:32] or not to us
[1:18:33] they sound after we leave but we'll
[1:18:37] explain that a little bit next son used
[1:18:38] to stand our feet musicians come we've
[1:18:42] got a little bit of time there's not
[1:18:44] gonna take us that long get down there
[1:18:51] let's sing it one song brother luison
[1:18:55] but here's a man Daniel the Bible says
[1:19:00] greatly beloved because he got on his
[1:19:03] knees and prayed he defied the nation he
[1:19:10] was living in and the king that told him
[1:19:14] oh please always turn that thing off man

[1:19:42] war it was just a few cannons being

[1:19:46] hundred cannons and fifteen and twenty
[1:19:48] thousand men start shooting at each

[1:20:26] the cross of Calvary somewhere
[1:20:35] well crazy I know
[1:20:40] I want to do is love him
[1:20:50] Oh

[1:21:24] I know
[1:21:26] be the same
[1:21:29] all I want to do is love love is
[1:21:36] [Music]
[1:21:40] you know you you think about Daniel and
[1:21:45] you see a man that was exiled from his
[1:21:48] from his home it was in Babylon just
[1:21:53] like you and me are now what this is not
[1:21:55] our home
[1:21:55] we're in a place that we're not supposed
[1:21:58] to be but we're well just like he was
[1:22:01] and we we know that we're coming up
[1:22:06] Daniel knew there was only two years
[1:22:08] left and something they were going to be
[1:22:11] released there something was gonna
[1:22:13] happen to try to bring everything back
[1:22:14] together again and he wanted to know
[1:22:17] what was going on and then Gabriel comes
[1:22:20] up and tells him not only what's gonna
[1:22:23] happen when they get released but what's
[1:22:24] gonna happen all the way to the
[1:22:26] Millennium how that they're going to be
[1:22:28] restored and how that they're going to
[1:22:29] they're going to turn them aside down
[1:22:32] and and house it inside there there's
[1:22:34] going to be you know it's not in the
[1:22:36] Bible but there's going to be a a
[1:22:38] Gentile bride interjected in there and
[1:22:40] then there's going to be one week left
[1:22:42] after the rapture for the Jews to finish
[1:22:45] the 70 weeks of Daniel it's all in the
[1:22:49] Bible so don't be scared
[1:22:51] I know maybe sometimes this is it's a
[1:22:55] little bit it's not exciting but you
[1:22:59] know I all the years I've lived if you
[1:23:04] ever have a question about something
[1:23:05] there's a little bit of fear that goes
[1:23:08] along with that because you don't know
[1:23:10] exactly what's going on or if somebody
[1:23:14] brings you a question if somebody
[1:23:15] somebody you know asked you something
[1:23:17] even about Daniel 70 weeks and and
[1:23:19] people get all upset about things woman
[1:23:22] it's in the Bible we got to make our
[1:23:27] thoughts and ideas fit that Bible
[1:23:30] whatever thought we have and whatever
[1:23:32] thought we thought we had whatever we
[1:23:35] thought we thought brother Branham had
[1:23:36] he's got to fit the Bible
[1:23:39] he can't change the Bible the Bible is
[1:23:41] exactly correct there's no way you can
[1:23:44] change it and then you know what we can
[1:23:47] be sure one thing if we can see it in
[1:23:50] here if we can see it in here the
[1:23:54] message will be much more clear of what
[1:23:57] people think of the confusion there's no
[1:23:59] confusion why in the world would them
[1:24:02] why wouldn't eternal God send confusion
[1:24:05] now he sends confusion among people that
[1:24:08] want to be confused but now the people
[1:24:11] have his own children why would you want
[1:24:13] to confuse your own kids he'd be a
[1:24:17] horrible father if he wanted to confuse
[1:24:19] his own children he died and he wants us
[1:24:21] to understand every word of God and I
[1:24:25] believe to take a body change we gotta
[1:24:27] have this thing right I don't I don't
[1:24:28] know about you but but you know we you
[1:24:31] just gotta have it right and there's
[1:24:33] somebody that's gonna have it right and
[1:24:35] God is gonna put somebody in the pulpit
[1:24:37] to teach you that it's right I just
[1:24:40] believe that I'm just dumb enough to
[1:24:41] believe something like that because you
[1:24:43] know what there is no other way you're
[1:24:45] gonna get it there's no other way you're
[1:24:49] gonna get it you know what I accept that
[1:24:55] it's like brother Dale was talking this
[1:24:58] morning about brother Bob brother Bob
[1:25:00] just didn't go down to the to the thing
[1:25:02] is maybe the second largest law firm in
[1:25:04] Atlanta and go I know one job they said
[1:25:07] well watch your qualifications he's will
[1:25:08] now finish high school
[1:25:12] he said dude you need to go back and
[1:25:15] finish a few more years what he had some
[1:25:17] learning but he didn't have all the
[1:25:19] learning that he needed we've had some
[1:25:21] learning but we just had not had all
[1:25:23] that we needed amen cuz we got to be
[1:25:26] brother Ram called a spiritual
[1:25:28] astronauts now the astronaut is not a
[1:25:30] dummy
[1:25:31] an astronaut went to school went to
[1:25:34] school went school when school and
[1:25:36] school let's go
[1:25:37] went to simulators flight simulators I
[1:25:40] was not gonna ride with you unless you
[1:25:43] had your pilot's license no way can you
[1:25:47] fly plane I wouldn't ride with you I
[1:25:52] don't ride with you if you didn't know
[1:25:54] how to fly one but it's just like it's
[1:25:57] just like brother Dale said the reason
[1:25:59] Bob got where he was at is because what
[1:26:01] he went school he went to school and he
[1:26:05] had to learning to learn how to do what
[1:26:07] he does and each one of us the same way
[1:26:09] we've been schooled in life if we've not
[1:26:12] been schooled in anything else
[1:26:15] but God bless you as we dismiss Daniel
[1:26:20] got something from God by praying and
[1:26:23] reading what Jeremiah said he pulled him
[1:26:27] Scrolls back he might only had
[1:26:29] Jeremiah's rotten brother Larry he made
[1:26:31] just that one book but he got enough out
[1:26:34] of that book to bring Gabriel into this
[1:26:38] dimension and say old Daniel so greatly
[1:26:41] loved I'm gonna tell you what your
[1:26:44] heart's desire is let's bow our heads do
[1:26:47] heavenly Father thank you for this day
[1:26:50] thank you for the word that you've given
[1:26:52] us Lord I know we're unworthy creatures
[1:26:58] but you've made us worthy you told us if
[1:27:01] we'd study and read our Bible you told
[1:27:03] us if we would read the prophets message
[1:27:05] that we would get these things and you
[1:27:08] said you would send the Holy Ghost to do
[1:27:10] one thing and that was to teach us what
[1:27:13] you've already said and show us things
[1:27:16] to come Lord you're the teacher without
[1:27:20] the Holy Ghost we don't have a teacher
[1:27:23] but that inward man is the teacher they
[1:27:25] teaches us Lord and we have to depend on
[1:27:29] that Holy Ghost to be true and it is
[1:27:32] it's all these other ideas that
