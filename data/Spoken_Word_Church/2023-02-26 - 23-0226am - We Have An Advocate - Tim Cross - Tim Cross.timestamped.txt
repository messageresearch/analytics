[21:48] greet you in the name of the Lord this
[21:50] morning you can be seated if you'd like
[21:52] and um appreciate brother Wade extending
[21:57] an invitation to come and be with you
[21:59] this morning it really shows a lot of
[22:02] confidence when a when a pastor will
[22:04] open his Pulpit while he's away and then
[22:07] um but I guess he knew brother Samuel be
[22:09] here to keep a close eye on me yeah
[22:12] it's just wonderful to be with you this
[22:15] morning and I feel very much like family
[22:18] to you all and it's been a number of
[22:21] years since we were by here and so we
[22:24] thank the Lord he opened up another
[22:26] opportunity I did not bring my my wife
[22:29] and our little baby that we've just
[22:31] adopted with me this morning
[22:33] at the church where we attend now
[22:36] this morning was the first service in a
[22:39] new building that the Lord has given to
[22:41] us and we really thank the Lord for that
[22:42] we we bring greetings thank you
[22:47] bring you greetings from Brother Josh
[22:50] Bennett our pastor and uh yeah for the
[22:52] last two or three years we've been
[22:54] meeting in the gym of a Wesleyan Church
[22:57] when the coveted restrictions were put
[23:00] into law we didn't have enough room
[23:02] which we were running out of room as it
[23:04] was so uh when they made the six foot
[23:07] distance rule uh Wesleyan Church very
[23:09] graciously offered us the the exclusive
[23:12] use of their gem building and uh so we
[23:15] converted it into a sanctuary and had
[23:18] been meeting there since I guess 2020 or
[23:20] whenever that all started
[23:22] so um it was a tough go but we it was
[23:26] really something because
[23:28] um the the Wesleyan Church itself had um
[23:32] their membership had declined they were
[23:34] somewhat struggling and uh when they saw
[23:37] this this group move in and begin
[23:40] worshiping in the gym you know just in
[23:43] the way we do it it kind of inspired
[23:45] them to say as soon as y'all move out of
[23:47] that building
[23:48] we're going to bring in a younger pastor
[23:50] and we're going to change the format of
[23:52] our services and they they saw I believe
[23:55] what they saw was a living reality lived
[23:59] out in the hearts of worshipers and so
[24:00] they're they're wanting to shift away
[24:03] from maybe the traditional format that
[24:06] they used and I just you know I really
[24:09] pray that something real God will bless
[24:13] them number one for allowing us the use
[24:16] of their building but you know without a
[24:18] revelation uh they can only aspire to
[24:23] have what we have and I don't say that
[24:26] in a condescending way I pray that
[24:28] something real will strike their hearts
[24:30] and ignite them to bring them into the
[24:33] fullness the reality of who Jesus Christ
[24:34] is today amen because he is he is more
[24:39] he's more than what any man's box or
[24:42] boundaries can Define him to be he's a
[24:44] living moving reality and we're
[24:47] following the the same Pillar of Fire
[24:49] that the children of Israel followed
[24:51] under Moses leadership and then under
[24:53] Joshua's that same pillar fire is moving
[24:55] today and so we just thank the Lord for
[25:00] the goodness and the grace he's shown to
[25:02] us and so not having brought my wife
[25:04] with me this morning they asked me if I
[25:07] would maybe play a song on the piano and
[25:10] so um if they'll lock the doors in the
[25:12] back
[25:13] and keep everybody from making a mass
[25:15] Exodus
[25:17] um I I will do that maybe play a song
[25:19] and maybe even sing
[25:21] but uh it really is a it really is a
[25:25] privilege to be with you this morning
[25:26] and to see brother Samuel and his wife
[25:29] and uh just knowing that you know this
[25:31] we just have a few moments in time here
[25:33] on Earth but we're going to share
[25:35] eternity together again like we did
[25:38] before there was a creation so uh may
[25:41] the Lord bless you this morning just
[25:42] Worship the Lord with me
[25:56] [Music]
[26:00] foreign
[26:28] foreign
[26:37] [Music]
[27:07] you recognize that so
[27:10] it's an old song but it has a great
[27:12] meaning I don't know if there's a
[27:14] microphone
[27:15] [Music]
[27:23] threats
[27:34] foreign
[27:46] [Music]
[27:54] but the path
[27:56] of that Long Island
[28:02] with joy I will follow
[28:06] today
[28:11] and the tools of the road
[28:15] will seem nothing
[28:17] [Music]
[28:20] when I get to the end
[28:24] of the way
[28:29] the tall tours of the road
[28:33] we'll see nothing
[28:38] when I get to the end of
[28:42] the way
[28:46] there are so many Hills
[28:51] to climb upwards
[28:53] [Music]
[28:56] I often
[28:58] among him for rest
[29:05] but he who appoints me my pathway
[29:12] [Music]
[29:13] knows just what is
[29:19] do you have the confidence this morning
[29:22] I know in his word he hath promised
[29:31] that the strength it shall be as my day
[29:40] and the toes of the road
[29:44] will seem nothing
[29:48] when I get to the
[29:53] end of the way
[29:56] yes the tours of the road will seem
[30:03] nothing
[30:05] when I get to the end
[30:10] way I love the words to this verse
[30:15] he loves me too well to forsake me
[30:23] or give me one trial
[30:28] too much
[30:32] all his people
[30:35] have been dearly purchased
[30:39] us
[30:41] and Satan can never claim
[30:47] search
[30:49] by and by I shall see him and praise him
[30:57] in
[30:58] that City
[31:02] [Music]
[31:07] they're the tools
[31:16] when I get to the end of the way
[31:22] [Music]
[31:25] when the last
[31:27] feeble step
[31:29] has been taken
[31:34] and the gates of that City
[31:39] peace
[31:42] and the Beautiful song of the Angels
[31:52] flowed out oh my listening
[32:01] in all that now seems so
[32:05] mysterious
[32:09] will be bright
[32:11] and clear as the day
[32:18] then the toes
[32:22] we'll see nothing
[32:27] when I get to the end
[32:31] of the way
[32:36] yes the tools
[32:39] [Music]
[32:45] when I get to the end love
[32:50] the ways
[32:56] foreign
[33:14] [Applause]
[33:28] get started singing and so I'll just go
[33:30] from one to the other but it'll be worth
[33:33] it all by the same when we see Jesus
[33:36] amen
[33:37] God bless you we'll stand this morning
[33:40] turning our Bibles to First John chapter
[33:43] 2.
[33:45] came down last night and got to go out
[33:48] and have a little fellowship with
[33:50] brother Aaron and brother Bob
[33:52] and I just really enjoyed that time of
[33:55] Fellowship together and
[33:57] um
[33:59] let's pray the Lord will you know when
[34:01] you get up here as a minister you
[34:03] realize you you can't do anything or you
[34:05] can't say anything
[34:10] can't do anything in and of ourselves
[34:12] that would be of a help to you but what
[34:14] we're depending on is for him to come on
[34:16] the scene and he did promise in his word
[34:19] if two or three would Gather in his name
[34:21] that he would come and be right in our
[34:23] midst and that's what we're depending on
[34:25] this morning so just before we read his
[34:28] word maybe we could go to him in prayer
[34:30] if you have a need in your life today
[34:32] something you're Desiring from the Lord
[34:35] why don't you just approach him now in
[34:37] sincerity and ask him to comment you
[34:40] know there's power in his word and
[34:42] there's power in his presence and we
[34:45] have not gathered in vain he didn't make
[34:47] those promises in vain but he's a living
[34:49] reality and I believe he'll just come
[34:52] right Among Us this morning and minister
[34:55] to our needs Lord we just come before
[34:58] you this morning with Thanksgiving in
[35:00] our heart knowing Lord that your word is
[35:03] true we are your people we're the Sheep
[35:06] Lord of your pastor
[35:08] Lord when you've made the promise you
[35:11] knew that there would be a people on the
[35:13] Earth in this day Lord that would be so
[35:15] dependent and so reliant on you Lord
[35:18] that we can't make it without you
[35:20] Lord we go through many trials and I'm
[35:23] sure Lord the last time I was here none
[35:26] of us imagined we would even still be on
[35:28] the earth Lord in 2023 and we would have
[35:31] just come through Lord a worldwide
[35:33] pandemic and Lord there's been a lot of
[35:36] water go under the bridge a lot of tests
[35:38] a lot of Trials a lot of turmo Lord and
[35:41] I'm sure your children this morning Lord
[35:43] are stealing the heat of the battle but
[35:46] God we're depending upon you because
[35:48] you're the author and the finisher of
[35:51] our faith Lord you said in your word he
[35:54] that began a good work in you will be
[35:56] faithful to perform it until the day of

[37:21] others would be watching or listening in

[37:25] would fill their homes in the places
[37:27] where they are Lord and raise them up
[37:29] and lift them up father God granted we
[37:32] ask in Jesus name we pray for you to be
[37:35] glorified and honored in our midst Lord
[37:37] is our desire this morning may you grant
[37:40] it now in Jesus Christ's name we ask it
[37:43] amen
[37:45] amen first John chapter 2 we'll just
[37:48] read beginning here at verse number one
[37:50] I want to speak maybe for a title this
[37:54] morning we have an advocate
[37:57] amen we have an advocate and John writes
[38:01] here and he says my little children
[38:03] these things right unto right eye unto
[38:06] you that ye sin not
[38:08] and if any man sin we have an advocate
[38:12] with the father Jesus Christ the
[38:17] righteous and he is the propitiation for
[38:21] our sins and not for ours only but also
[38:24] for the sins of the whole world and
[38:28] hereby we do know that we know him if we
[38:32] keep his Commandments he that saith I
[38:35] know him and keepeth not his
[38:37] Commandments is a liar and the truth is
[38:40] not in him but who so keepeth his word
[38:44] in him verily is the word of God or is
[38:49] the love of God perfected
[38:52] hereby know we that we are in him
[38:58] amen and also in Hebrews chapter 4
[39:02] verses 4 through or 14 through 16.
[39:10] seeing then that we have a great high
[39:14] priest that is passed into the heavens
[39:17] Jesus the son of God let us hold fast
[39:22] our profession
[39:25] for we have not an high priest which
[39:28] cannot be touched with the feeling of
[39:30] our infirmities but was in all points
[39:34] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[39:39] let us therefore come boldly unto the
[39:43] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[39:46] and find Grace to help in the time of
[39:50] need
[39:51] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[39:53] word as you're seated this morning
[39:56] you know I believe if there's anything
[39:58] or if there's one thing that we can do
[40:00] as Ministers of the Gospel is to lift up
[40:04] the name of Jesus Christ
[40:06] and to stir up your pure Minds by way of
[40:10] remembrance
[40:11] and to exalt the Lord Jesus and lift him
[40:15] so high amen that it would take your
[40:18] vision or your eyes amen from the here
[40:21] and now or the the you know all the
[40:23] things that uh batter us and try to
[40:26] weaken our confidence in our faith but
[40:28] just to get our eyes on Jesus Christ
[40:31] amen in such a way that it would
[40:33] actually inspire faith in our hearts
[40:36] Amen to motives and to make us into his
[40:40] very image you know we are we are
[40:42] powerfully impacted by the things that
[40:46] we behold with our natural sight you
[40:49] know when uh when Jacob wanted to get
[40:51] the cattle to look a certain way he put
[40:53] those sticks in the water troughs that
[40:56] we had these carvings on them and it was
[40:58] it and it affected what was birthed
[41:01] forth from those cattle and so it's
[41:04] important what we fix our eyes on it's
[41:07] important what we devote our time and
[41:09] our attention to amen so and and this uh
[41:13] 45 or 60 or 90 or 120 Minutes we have
[41:17] here this morning amen I want to get our
[41:19] eyes fixed on Jesus Christ amen he said
[41:23] if I be lifted up I'll draw all men unto
[41:26] me amen he was that bruised serpent or
[41:29] that brass serpent that was lifted up
[41:31] there in the wilderness that if the
[41:33] believer could turn their eyes from
[41:35] their Affliction to amen sin judged amen
[41:39] it would have a miraculous healing
[41:42] effect amen amen Express into their
[41:45] lives and so that's that's my desire
[41:47] this morning is just to lift up Jesus
[41:50] Christ who is the revealed word of the
[41:53] hour amen I know this morning we're not
[41:55] worshiping a historical God from 2000
[41:59] years ago we're not worshiping a God
[42:01] that has been defined To Us by a
[42:04] religious system but we're worshiping a
[42:06] God who has become a living reality in
[42:08] our lives and we are his Witnesses here
[42:11] on the Earth today amen so we realize in
[42:14] the Old Testament amen when the
[42:17] worshiper was given instructions under
[42:19] Moses Ministry amen they would bring a
[42:23] lamb or a sacrifice Amen to be offered
[42:26] Amen in their behalf as a covering or as
[42:30] a something to atone on behalf of them
[42:33] because of their recognition of their
[42:36] sinful condition amen and a conscience
[42:39] of sin that had been realized upon
[42:42] Humanity after the transgression that
[42:44] was committed in the Garden of Eden by
[42:46] his first created son and daughter and
[42:49] so we realize that the worshiper would
[42:51] bring this lamb as an offering to to the
[42:55] high priest and the high priest was
[42:57] acting as a as an intermediary between
[43:01] the worshiper and Jehovah God because
[43:04] the worshiper could not approach God
[43:07] directly at that time amen and so the
[43:09] priest was there serving as as a
[43:12] representation of something greater that
[43:15] would follow a man but he was there to
[43:17] take amen something that was offered in
[43:20] sincerity amen something that was
[43:22] offered amen wholeheartedly by the
[43:25] worshiper and he was to examine that
[43:27] amen before taking it before the Lord to
[43:30] be accepted and so that worshiper was
[43:33] waiting there brother Luis in
[43:35] anticipation to see what the high priest
[43:38] response would be or to see how he would
[43:41] return to them with some validation that
[43:45] the atonement had either been accepted
[43:47] or rejected because they realize when
[43:50] the atonement was accepted they were
[43:52] accepted it was there taking their place
[43:56] or it was uh something there as a
[43:59] substitute on behalf of the believer and
[44:01] we know that the priest was not
[44:03] examining the worshiper
[44:05] he was examining the lamb
[44:09] he wasn't amen he was already a known
[44:11] fact that the worshiper wasn't qualified
[44:14] they were Sinners amen they were worthy
[44:17] of death they were worthy of the
[44:19] Affliction of sickness amen whatever it
[44:22] was there was a known fact that they
[44:25] were a sinner amen so the priest was not
[44:28] Examining The Sinner but he was
[44:31] examining what the sinner was presenting
[44:33] as the atonement Amen on his behalf and
[44:37] we know that when that propitiation and
[44:40] when that lamb was accepted amen that
[44:43] priest would come back and give that
[44:46] believer that Assurance amen and that
[44:49] faith and that confidence that Jehovah
[44:51] God Amen has seen what has been
[44:55] substituted on your behalf and he has
[44:58] accepted it and you are free to go and
[45:01] worship with that being released
[45:04] from your conscience
[45:07] amen
[45:08] so I want to say this though amen the
[45:12] way that lamb was kept up
[45:14] and the way that lamb was cared for she
[45:17] showed the sincerity and the dedication
[45:21] of the worshiper
[45:23] amen that worshiper didn't just go out
[45:25] there on the on the morning of the
[45:27] atonement and just grab up any old lamb
[45:29] and say come along I'm gonna I'm gonna
[45:31] offer you right
[45:33] amen he didn't just go it wasn't
[45:35] haphazard it wasn't uh this is something
[45:38] he did as a formality there had to be
[45:42] some sincerity some dedication and some
[45:45] devotion there otherwise God would not
[45:47] receive it
[45:49] God would not honor it amen so it shows
[45:52] we must have a sincere approach to God
[45:57] and then if we approach God haphazardly
[45:59] or or if our worship Services just
[46:01] become a formality or if the only reason
[46:04] you come to church amen is to check a
[46:06] box that you have done your religious
[46:08] Duty for that day or for that week amen
[46:11] amen you're not short-changing God you
[46:14] are shortchanging yourself
[46:16] you are missing because you will not get
[46:20] the fullness of the effect of that
[46:22] service and that worship because you're
[46:24] approach amen is not in complete
[46:26] sincerity
[46:27] so it does matter what your approach is
[46:30] and no matter how worthy your lamb is
[46:33] Amen in order for you to go away amen
[46:37] with a True Heart felt worship
[46:42] you must have a complete recognition of
[46:45] what that lamb has actually done on your
[46:47] behalf
[46:49] amen amen
[46:51] through the worshiper and I'm just
[46:52] laying a little bit of a foundation here
[46:54] this is my first time maybe to speak on
[46:57] this subject and I don't know how it'll
[46:59] go with everything I've got on my heart
[47:01] or the time constraints but I just want
[47:04] you just to pull on the word and ask God
[47:06] speak to me this morning amen the
[47:09] worshiper was prevented from entering
[47:12] the holiest of holies but the priest
[47:14] took that atonement on behalf of all who
[47:18] believed I believe there was a once a
[47:20] year amen that the priest would go on
[47:22] behalf of the entire Congregation of
[47:24] Israel
[47:25] amen now he wasn't doing this for
[47:27] Egyptians he wasn't doing this for
[47:29] amorites he wasn't doing this for people
[47:32] of other nations or other Origins but he
[47:35] was doing it on behalf of a selected
[47:38] group of people that God had chosen to
[47:42] be the Earthly representation of God's
[47:45] Kingdom
[47:46] he sent them this prophet
[47:48] amen he gave him
[47:50] gave him amen and so they had been
[47:58] Egypt amen and so they had been
[48:00] segregated if you will or they had been
[48:03] uh uh isolated from the other nations
[48:06] and peoples of the Earth because they
[48:09] were again an Earthly representation of
[48:12] what was in the mind of God Amen a
[48:14] spiritual Kingdom that God was
[48:16] reestablishing on the earth even after
[48:19] the fall of the transgression in the in
[48:21] the in the Eden amen and so they it
[48:25] wasn't for everyone but it was for the
[48:27] believer
[48:28] he was for the chosen it was for those
[48:31] who had marched out of Egypt's bondage
[48:34] in an exodus amen back into the land
[48:36] that had been theirs all along
[48:39] you say theirs all along brother Tim yes
[48:41] they weren't reclaiming they weren't
[48:42] stealing land from someone else they
[48:44] were retaking the land that God had
[48:46] given to their forefathers Abraham
[48:49] amen but it took a prophetic Ministry
[48:51] brother Samuel to reconnect them to
[48:55] their true origin their true spiritual
[48:58] Heritage when they were in Egypt they
[49:01] had been reduced to Slaves I mean they
[49:04] had become a sub-category or a subclass
[49:07] of people but a prophet's Ministry amen
[49:10] reminded them that before you in Egypt's
[49:13] bondage God made a promise to your
[49:15] father Abraham and he was there to
[49:17] reconnect in brother Louise to their
[49:19] true Heritage and lead them out of Egypt
[49:22] back into their land to dispossess every
[49:26] squatter who had occupied that territory
[49:28] thinking that was their own I want to
[49:31] tell you this morning you're not taking
[49:32] the devil's salvation you're not taking
[49:34] the devil's healing you're taking yours
[49:37] back but there has to be a revelation in
[49:39] your heart this is that is mine it
[49:42] belongs to me God gave it to me and you
[49:45] have to drive off every squatter
[49:47] amen
[49:50] Hallelujah
[49:51] you know some people that and I'm I'm
[49:54] veering off my notes here but some
[49:55] people seem to be
[49:57] uh afraid or scared amen or their their
[50:02] hesitant to recognize
[50:06] what being a child of God how exclusive
[50:09] that makes you
[50:12] but it's true for every Christian
[50:14] s are a segregated group they are
[50:18] isolated from the world come out from
[50:20] among them and touch not the unclean
[50:22] thing that has always been amen and
[50:25] Jesus himself stood on Earth and said I
[50:27] am the way the truth and the life no man
[50:31] coming to the father by me so what I'm
[50:33] trying to show you this morning is you
[50:35] don't have to be embarrassed and what
[50:37] God has foreordained you and made you to
[50:41] be as children of the Living God
[50:44] you're not like the world and you're not
[50:46] supposed to be like the world you can't
[50:48] blend with the world Amen but we've been
[50:50] called out as a separated people
[50:53] so this is an exclusive message
[50:56] amen this is an exclusive Ministry that
[51:00] has come to the Earth to call up people
[51:03] Amen to call a bride out of church
[51:06] entity
[51:07] amen and so just your ability to
[51:11] recognize that call and identify to it
[51:13] and be transformed by it is a great
[51:16] blessing and and friend it doesn't make
[51:19] us anything I don't want to sound like
[51:21] an elitist this morning I'm not an
[51:23] elitist I'm a sinner Say by grace
[51:26] but what Grace makes me and what the
[51:30] grace of God restores me to in my
[51:32] placing as a Son of God and as a
[51:35] daughter of God Amen should not be
[51:37] undermined by unbelief
[51:40] or a failure to recognize what God has
[51:44] imputed to you as the Earthly expression
[51:47] of his glory and his righteousness
[51:51] it's what gives him glory
[51:53] I've told this story years ago when I
[51:55] was a child who went to a to a church
[51:57] and there was a man there he had come
[51:59] out of prison he I don't know what he'd
[52:01] been accused of but uh it very much had
[52:05] lived uh some portion of his life
[52:07] incarcerated for crimes he had committed
[52:09] and so then when he came out he married
[52:11] he was a Believer and he married a
[52:14] Believer amen there in the church a
[52:16] sister and I said uh pardon me if this
[52:19] sounds crude but Brother Sam I said you
[52:21] could always know when he had arrived in
[52:23] the service you always knew when he was
[52:25] there because his wife that he had
[52:27] married just just a young sister and
[52:29] then he always dressed her in the nicest
[52:31] of clothes
[52:33] and she always had the nicest perfumes
[52:35] that she would wear and so as soon as
[52:37] she would walk into the doors of the
[52:39] sanctuary the the odor of that perfume
[52:42] would begin to feel the sanctuary and
[52:44] you would know she has arrived
[52:46] and you would know he has arrived
[52:49] and he was a poor man it was a it was a
[52:52] plain man he I think he was a wood
[52:53] cutter something like that worked in the
[52:55] tree industry amen he would dress simple
[52:57] look simple I believe he had an eyebrow
[53:00] removed or something maybe had been a
[53:01] gang member or something there an
[53:03] expression but you see all of his glory
[53:06] amen all of his wealth all of his status
[53:09] amen was being carried on display by his
[53:13] bride
[53:14] and it took nothing away from him but it
[53:17] was actually how he chose to channel
[53:21] who he was she was the expression of
[53:24] that
[53:25] amen and she didn't have to wear a
[53:27] wedding band although she did
[53:29] she didn't have to walk around saying
[53:31] hey I'm married I got a husband amen I I
[53:35] know she just moved and walked without
[53:38] saying a word she was dressed in
[53:42] something she was adorning something
[53:44] that told everybody I'm taken I'm
[53:47] married I've got a protector I've got a
[53:51] provider I belong to somebody I am
[53:55] somebody's wife his glory was being
[53:58] expressed through her
[53:59] oh my if that is not a picture of the
[54:02] Bride of Jesus Christ
[54:04] oh I'm off my notes now but I'm just
[54:06] going to preach I feel at home
[54:08] Every Creature got formed in the Garden
[54:10] of Eden the male was the most beautiful
[54:14] until God made something in his own
[54:16] image
[54:17] Adam
[54:19] was formed from the dust of the Earth
[54:22] with the more beautiful part of himself
[54:25] contained in his sight as a mystery
[54:29] showing what Christ would do in all the
[54:33] lower forms of creation the glory and
[54:36] the beauty and the Des and the Splendor
[54:38] was expressed in the male creature
[54:41] but when God made something in his image
[54:44] the more beautiful part was still inside
[54:48] as a mystery but when Adam grew lonely
[54:51] and began to desire amen Fellowship
[54:55] communion with something of equal
[54:58] intelligence and power God removed now
[55:02] not from the dust of the earth brother
[55:04] Samuel but he reached right into Adam's
[55:06] side and he made her out of the same
[55:09] material that Adam was made of and he
[55:13] said this is thou bone of my bone this
[55:16] is Flesh of My Flesh
[55:18] Life Of My Life
[55:20] [Applause]
[55:21] Hallelujah
[55:24] and the more glorious the more beautiful
[55:27] expression of him was his bride
[55:31] Hallelujah
[55:32] and he said in Isaiah there is no beauty
[55:34] that we should desire him he was smitten
[55:38] he was bruised he was broken he had he
[55:41] was uh amen he was rejected he was
[55:43] despised by the world he was acquainted
[55:46] with grief a Man of Sorrows but what
[55:48] came forth from his side was a
[55:51] revelation of his actual worth his value
[55:54] and he was glorified in a people on the
[55:58] face of the Earth
[55:59] Hallelujah
[56:01] praise the Lord
[56:03] well I'm way off my notes
[56:05] but but see and it's not Who We Are
[56:10] but it's whose
[56:12] we are
[56:14] that gives us our worth and our value
[56:17] because in and of ourselves brother Bob
[56:19] we're nothing
[56:21] we're nothing without him
[56:24] I've talked about a stock you know
[56:27] there's there's companies that there's
[56:30] stock value holds Great Value I uh maybe
[56:33] Microsoft or the Boeing Corporation or
[56:36] IBM computers are some of these great
[56:38] you know recognized names among stock
[56:40] Traders but
[56:42] you know I said you could go today and
[56:44] you you could be a millionaire and say
[56:45] I'm going to buy a million dollars worth
[56:49] of Boeing stock
[56:51] and I don't know that it would increase
[56:52] the value of the stock at all
[56:56] it would just mean you own
[56:58] a million dollars worth of shares
[57:01] but there are investors
[57:05] who have a known history of making good
[57:09] Investments based on their assessment of
[57:14] not only a Stock's present value but its
[57:17] future value
[57:19] and so when a man like Warren Buffett
[57:21] amen when it is even rumored that he has
[57:25] an interest in a stock the value begins
[57:29] to climb
[57:30] it isn't even the stock itself but the
[57:34] fact that uh an investor who never makes
[57:37] an unwise investment has shown an
[57:39] interest in it raises the value
[57:43] so the value you are not worth very much
[57:46] in and of yourself but somebody took an
[57:49] interest in you one day
[57:51] come on who has never made a bad
[57:54] investment reach down into the dust of
[57:57] the earth and he saw potential he saw
[58:00] his own value expressed in you
[58:05] and he justified you
[58:07] to sanctify you to fill you with the
[58:10] Holy Ghost and glorify you that he could
[58:13] display you
[58:15] as the product of what he is able to do
[58:20] Hallelujah
[58:22] amen it makes me want to sing makes me
[58:24] want to shout makes me want to run a
[58:26] life around this place because when I
[58:29] looked at myself Brotherhood I saw no
[58:31] value I saw a worthless creature brother
[58:33] Louise but when he looked happy brother
[58:35] Samuel he saw himself he saw something
[58:38] there Hallelujah
[58:41] that could give him glory
[58:43] praise the Lord
[58:45] praise the Lord
[58:47] amen and and that's why I give him glory
[58:50] that's why I worship him that's why
[58:52] there's something welling up inside of
[58:54] me Hallelujah that no matter that you
[58:56] know the world they don't understand but
[58:58] they've never experienced what we've
[59:00] experienced if they could only feel what
[59:02] we feel and he can be to them brother
[59:05] Joe the living reality he is to us
[59:08] he wouldn't be a mystery to them
[59:10] amen so an advocate Webster defines an
[59:15] advocate
[59:16] as one who pleads the cause
[59:20] of another
[59:21] and specifically one who pleads the
[59:24] cause of another before a Tribunal or a
[59:27] Judicial Court
[59:28] and then we we saw the word propitiation
[59:32] there and propitiation is the act
[59:36] of gaining
[59:38] or regaining
[59:41] the favor or Goodwill
[59:43] of someone or something
[59:47] that propitiates or appeases
[59:51] specifically on atoning sacrifice
[59:55] so it's something that meets the
[59:58] threshold of satisfaction
[1:00:01] for a higher authority amen that has
[1:00:04] demanded
[1:00:06] something to reconcile the difference
[1:00:09] that has been created by the
[1:00:12] transgression oh Hallelujah I hope we
[1:00:15] get to it this morning
[1:00:17] amen you know my wife and I we we
[1:00:20] adopted a little baby girl uh she turned
[1:00:23] two just after Thanksgiving and the
[1:00:25] adoption was finalized but you know when
[1:00:27] you go to adopt a child it's it's a
[1:00:30] legal process
[1:00:32] and so uh the the county uh or the state
[1:00:35] they actually have the care the custody
[1:00:38] of that child and that child has an
[1:00:41] advocate
[1:00:42] that child has a guardian ad litem a man
[1:00:45] who was appointed by the court because
[1:00:47] that child amen is a newborn amen cannot
[1:00:50] speak
[1:00:51] has no way to express itself has no way
[1:00:54] to defend itself has no way to express
[1:00:56] its interests or desires so a guardian
[1:00:59] ad litem is appointed amen as an
[1:01:02] advocate to speak and represent the
[1:01:06] interests of that child into a court
[1:01:09] with the jurisdiction or the authority
[1:01:11] Hallelujah to determine the outcome of
[1:01:14] that child's life
[1:01:16] and so there there's another separate
[1:01:18] matter that we've been involved with
[1:01:19] that involves Court proceedings and and
[1:01:22] uh it's it's kind of a land dispute or a
[1:01:24] boundary dispute and so we were in the
[1:01:26] court one day and my if you ever seen
[1:01:29] something that'll startle you and Amaze
[1:01:31] you you ought to go see how court
[1:01:33] proceedings take place and all the all
[1:01:35] the craziness that goes on in the
[1:01:37] courtroom but you know one one thing you
[1:01:40] realize very quickly
[1:01:42] no matter how right you are
[1:01:44] or no matter how wrongfully you've been
[1:01:47] treated
[1:01:48] standing there speaking on your own
[1:01:51] behalf gets you almost nowhere
[1:01:54] in a court of law
[1:01:56] we were there in one of the early
[1:01:57] proceedings and I mean I won't go into
[1:01:59] the details of it but to us it was plain
[1:02:02] as a nose on your face we have been
[1:02:05] wronged by a neighbor
[1:02:07] but you know what that judge and that
[1:02:10] court and all those attorneys and all
[1:02:11] those all those people there amen uh you
[1:02:15] are you are a pitiful helpless and
[1:02:18] defenseless party without legal
[1:02:21] representation
[1:02:23] we were there in one of the early
[1:02:24] proceedings and there was a a sheriff's
[1:02:27] deputy that was there I think it was a
[1:02:28] bailiff or just one of the deputies keep
[1:02:30] an order in the courthouse and he was
[1:02:32] mouthing to us
[1:02:34] get an attorney
[1:02:37] get yourself a lawyer
[1:02:40] and and brother and sister it wasn't
[1:02:42] easy to find a lawyer
[1:02:45] I went into the Yellow Pages I called
[1:02:46] two or three attorneys and everyone said
[1:02:49] well we don't deal in these type of
[1:02:51] matters we don't specialize in this type
[1:02:53] of case we can't help you and they would
[1:02:56] refer me to others and they'd say well
[1:02:57] yes I I used to do that but I don't do
[1:03:00] it this morning we were getting passed
[1:03:01] from one to the next to the next to the
[1:03:04] next until finally we found somebody who
[1:03:07] was willing to take our case
[1:03:09] Hallelujah I am so thankful we found
[1:03:14] somebody who was willing to take our
[1:03:17] case because we cannot approach the
[1:03:20] courts of God we cannot approach the
[1:03:23] great judge amen without representation
[1:03:26] amen because I've never gone to law
[1:03:29] school I don't know how the County laws
[1:03:31] work in the state laws and all these
[1:03:32] statutes and all these cases where
[1:03:34] president has been established even for
[1:03:36] me to do that I've had to go into
[1:03:38] studying digging through books they've
[1:03:40] been trying to make all these loose
[1:03:42] connections and the judge wouldn't care
[1:03:43] to hear anything I said
[1:03:46] but brother and sister when we got an
[1:03:48] advocate when we got an attorney
[1:03:50] retained it didn't matter how many
[1:03:53] things were arriving in our mailbox it
[1:03:56] didn't matter how many papers were being
[1:03:57] served it didn't matter how many court
[1:03:59] hearings were being scheduled amen I
[1:04:03] passed all of that stress all of that
[1:04:06] worry all of that trouble all to the
[1:04:09] shoulders of an advocate
[1:04:12] Hallelujah
[1:04:14] Hallelujah I didn't even have to come to
[1:04:16] court any longer he said I'm gonna show
[1:04:19] up on your behalf I'm gonna speak on
[1:04:22] your behalf from now on any accusation
[1:04:26] any papers anything that's served you
[1:04:29] just send it up to me
[1:04:31] Hallelujah let me tell you young person
[1:04:34] you don't have to speak to Satan you
[1:04:37] don't have to listen to his lies you
[1:04:39] don't have to be even overwhelmed you
[1:04:42] don't have to be afraid you have an
[1:04:44] advocate
[1:04:45] and when you recognize that you've got
[1:04:48] an advocate acting on your behalf you
[1:04:51] direct everything
[1:04:52] you direct all correspondence
[1:04:56] to the attorneys
[1:04:58] hallelujah hallelujah pass it All to
[1:05:02] Jesus Christ tell Satan I don't belong
[1:05:05] to myself anymore
[1:05:06] I don't speak for myself anymore I can't
[1:05:10] even defend myself
[1:05:12] he's doing it all on my behalf
[1:05:15] if you don't like it Satan take it up
[1:05:17] with him
[1:05:18] I didn't call myself I didn't choose
[1:05:21] myself I didn't foreign myself
[1:05:24] I responded
[1:05:26] to someone who was interested
[1:05:28] and taken my case
[1:05:30] on my behalf
[1:05:33] all correspondence from now on Amen we
[1:05:36] had I mean
[1:05:37] you wouldn't believe that brother and
[1:05:39] sister it was all it was almost like
[1:05:41] every two weeks I was having to cancel
[1:05:44] my appointments uh tell my work I've got
[1:05:46] another
[1:05:48] caring and if you're not there brother
[1:05:50] that does not bode well
[1:05:53] if you don't appear in court
[1:05:55] but you you're it's like it's almost
[1:05:57] like you're assumed guilty are you the
[1:06:00] the judge does not rule in your favor
[1:06:03] but when when I got an attorney
[1:06:06] when I got an advocate he said you don't
[1:06:08] have to appear today
[1:06:09] I'm going
[1:06:11] I'll call you if I need you
[1:06:13] amen he was there and see the thing
[1:06:16] about it is he has an end
[1:06:19] he has contacts
[1:06:21] he has connections
[1:06:23] with the court system
[1:06:25] with the judge you know if it's a
[1:06:28] traffic ticket or it's something you are
[1:06:29] actually guilty of those attorneys know
[1:06:32] which judges are serving on which days
[1:06:35] and they know which judges are the most
[1:06:38] lenient towards speeders
[1:06:41] shoplifters whatever it may be and
[1:06:44] they'll get your case postponed or or
[1:06:47] held until a judge is sitting there that
[1:06:51] is favorable to something you're
[1:06:54] actually guilty of
[1:06:56] because you'd have an advocate and he
[1:06:59] has a connection to the judge he also
[1:07:03] knows the other attorneys
[1:07:06] I'm not trying to give you an education
[1:07:08] on the on the broken court system
[1:07:10] but there was one day we showed up and
[1:07:13] and there's our attorney I didn't even
[1:07:14] know he's going to be there and he said
[1:07:16] yes I'm here I'm your attorney now
[1:07:19] that's what I'm here to do is represent
[1:07:21] you and I said well wonderful but the
[1:07:23] other party didn't show up
[1:07:25] neither did their attorney
[1:07:28] and I said oh my praise God we're going
[1:07:30] to get a victory here today
[1:07:32] and they're either going to be thrown
[1:07:34] out a quarter thrown in jail for failure
[1:07:36] to appear but you know what
[1:07:39] that other party's attorney had placed a
[1:07:41] phone call to the a district attorney or
[1:07:44] one of the paralegals and she said my
[1:07:47] daughter has a toothache
[1:07:48] and I got to take her to the dentist
[1:07:50] this morning I can't be there and they
[1:07:52] got the case postponed
[1:07:55] without her even being present
[1:07:57] because they've got connections
[1:08:00] and it doesn't seem fair
[1:08:03] and I told my I I told my attorney I
[1:08:05] said look if this happens again
[1:08:06] somebody's going to jail
[1:08:09] if I've got to show up for these
[1:08:11] hearings and they don't have to come or
[1:08:13] even their representation come if this
[1:08:15] happens again somebody's going to jail
[1:08:17] but then it reminded me what if the shoe
[1:08:19] were on the other foot
[1:08:21] and there was a time we got the case
[1:08:22] postponed but uh because we were away
[1:08:25] ministering out out west somewhere so
[1:08:27] you know they try to keep some form of
[1:08:29] Justice
[1:08:30] but the attorney speaks on behalf of the
[1:08:35] client
[1:08:36] amen so
[1:08:38] can I present to you this morning
[1:08:41] Jesus Christ
[1:08:44] our Prophet priest and King
[1:08:49] Hallelujah
[1:08:51] Paul uh picks it up in Hebrews and he's
[1:08:54] talking about the priesthood and he said
[1:08:55] for it is evident that our Lord spring
[1:08:59] out of Judah of which tribe Moses spake
[1:09:03] nothing concerning priesthood
[1:09:04] and yet it is far more evident for after
[1:09:07] the similitude of Melchizedek there
[1:09:09] ariseth another priest who is made not
[1:09:12] after the law of a carnal commandment
[1:09:15] but after the power of an endless life
[1:09:20] so he's actually showing a priesthood
[1:09:22] that holds a Supremacy over the
[1:09:25] levitical priesthood which was a type or
[1:09:28] Shadow pointing to something greater to
[1:09:31] follow
[1:09:32] for there is verily a disinulling of the
[1:09:34] Commandment going before the weakness
[1:09:36] and unprofitableness thereof for the law
[1:09:39] May nothing perfect but the bringing in
[1:09:42] of a better hope did by the which we
[1:09:45] draw nigh unto God
[1:09:48] and inasmuch as not without an oath he
[1:09:51] was made priest
[1:09:53] for those priests were made without an
[1:09:55] oath but this with an oath by him that
[1:09:58] said unto him the Lord swear and will
[1:10:01] not repent thou art a priest Forever
[1:10:04] After the order of Melchizedek
[1:10:09] by so much was Jesus made a surety of a
[1:10:15] better Testament
[1:10:16] and they truly were many priests because
[1:10:19] they were not suffered to continue by
[1:10:22] reason of death
[1:10:23] but this man because he continuous ever
[1:10:27] hath an unchangeable priesthood
[1:10:30] wherefore he is able also to save them
[1:10:33] to the uttermost that come unto God by
[1:10:37] him
[1:10:39] seeing he ever liveth to make
[1:10:41] intercession for them
[1:10:44] for such an high priest became us who is
[1:10:47] Holy harmless undefiled separate from
[1:10:51] Sinners and made higher than the heavens
[1:10:53] who needeth not daily as those High
[1:10:55] priests who offer up sacrifice first for
[1:10:57] his own sins and then for the peoples
[1:10:59] for this he wants he did once when he
[1:11:02] offered up himself for the law maketh
[1:11:05] men high priest which have infirmity but
[1:11:07] the word of the oath which was since the
[1:11:09] law maketh the son who is consecrated
[1:11:13] forevermore
[1:11:15] amen he was offered up on Calvary
[1:11:19] amen he was placed within a tomb
[1:11:22] he rose on that third and glorious
[1:11:24] Easter morning
[1:11:26] and he appeared unto his disciples
[1:11:29] unto Mary oh I love it I'm going to just
[1:11:32] divert for just a moment you know on
[1:11:35] that glorious Resurrection morning
[1:11:38] Mary went out early in the morning to
[1:11:41] Worship the Lord for the final time
[1:11:44] and I love this and I want you to catch
[1:11:46] this because we should never we should
[1:11:51] we should not come to church for what it
[1:11:54] can do for us
[1:11:58] she was approaching the Lord Jesus whom
[1:12:02] as far as she knew was dead
[1:12:05] deceased and could never do more for her
[1:12:10] but it did not stop her from wanting to
[1:12:13] do one more thing for him
[1:12:17] that's a real worshiper
[1:12:19] they're coming to to they're approaching
[1:12:22] him in worship not for what it will do
[1:12:24] for them
[1:12:26] but for what they can do
[1:12:28] in appreciation for what he's already
[1:12:32] done
[1:12:33] for them
[1:12:35] and so she came to the tomb and found it
[1:12:39] empty
[1:12:41] and she went back I think this is in
[1:12:42] Saint John 20. you'll read this she goes
[1:12:45] back and gets Peter and John and they
[1:12:47] come also to the tomb and go inside and
[1:12:49] see the same scene that she saw
[1:12:53] and turned and walked away
[1:12:55] they went back to their despair they
[1:12:58] went back to their despondent condition
[1:13:01] they went back to what you know when
[1:13:02] when Jesus was taken from them in a
[1:13:04] bodily form they fell away very quickly
[1:13:07] because they did not have the Holy
[1:13:10] Spirit within them to Anchor them
[1:13:13] but Mary had a different zeal
[1:13:17] she had a different approach she had a
[1:13:21] different determination
[1:13:22] and to her it didn't matter what the
[1:13:25] others were doing she had come there
[1:13:28] with a purpose and she was not going to
[1:13:32] leave until her desire had been
[1:13:35] fulfilled
[1:13:37] are you seeing that this morning amen
[1:13:39] she didn't care what the reproach is she
[1:13:41] didn't care what the reputation is
[1:13:43] didn't we hear the message this morning
[1:13:44] the reproach for the cause of Christ
[1:13:47] many are leaving in this hour because of
[1:13:51] a reproach
[1:13:53] amen or what appears to be our approach
[1:13:56] to the message to Jesus Christ revealed
[1:13:59] to us in word form but for Mary amen
[1:14:02] nothing could change her mind nothing
[1:14:05] amen could deter her away from the
[1:14:08] reality of what Jesus Christ meant to
[1:14:12] her
[1:14:14] Hallelujah
[1:14:15] so she remained there brother Luis at
[1:14:19] the place she had last been in his
[1:14:22] presence
[1:14:24] amen she stayed there
[1:14:26] steadfast
[1:14:28] I'm moving amen unshakable amen I came
[1:14:33] here to meet him
[1:14:35] and I'm gonna stay here until I do
[1:14:39] and only moments after the ministers
[1:14:42] walked away
[1:14:44] two angels
[1:14:46] appeared
[1:14:47] in the same place
[1:14:50] they had all three just been
[1:14:54] oh my friend determination persistence
[1:14:59] when it's a derivative of faith will
[1:15:02] bring results
[1:15:03] she said I don't care what this does for
[1:15:05] anybody else I know what it's done for
[1:15:08] me
[1:15:09] you know something she had precious
[1:15:10] spices she had precious ointments she
[1:15:12] had things that in the world had value
[1:15:15] they had meaning amen they had worth but
[1:15:18] to her it didn't mean anything
[1:15:20] unless it brought her into his presence
[1:15:24] we can have buildings we can have
[1:15:27] programs we can have fine things but
[1:15:29] it's worthless without him
[1:15:31] amen our reputation of Pastor history is
[1:15:34] worthless without his living presence
[1:15:36] Among Us amen we're only worshiping the
[1:15:39] memory say man of a day gone by and God
[1:15:42] does not expect us to live Hallelujah
[1:15:45] and the fake Aid of something that's
[1:15:48] going in the past God is not a prophet
[1:15:50] of 50 years ago or five years ago he is
[1:15:53] the I am God he's a God today and when
[1:15:57] you come with that expectation I came
[1:16:00] here to meet God and I'm not gonna leave
[1:16:03] until I come in contact with him
[1:16:07] then some angels appeared some angels
[1:16:11] appeared to direct her
[1:16:14] Hallelujah there's a real fightful
[1:16:17] ministry that's on the Earth today to
[1:16:20] direct you into contact with the living
[1:16:22] Jesus Christ amen he is the god of
[1:16:26] William Brennan but he's also the god of
[1:16:28] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:16:31] Jesus Christ Our prophet
[1:16:34] priest and King
[1:16:36] second Corinthians 5 21 says for he hath
[1:16:39] made him
[1:16:40] to be sin for us
[1:16:43] who knew no sin that we might be made
[1:16:47] the righteousness of God
[1:16:50] in him
[1:16:52] see Mary was bringing those
[1:16:54] those sacraments he was bringing those
[1:16:56] spices those precious ointments but she
[1:16:58] said they're worthless
[1:17:00] unless they're on him
[1:17:03] he is what gives it its worth
[1:17:07] he is what gives this service value
[1:17:10] he is what gives you coming here today
[1:17:13] that's why you came you didn't come to
[1:17:15] see a building you didn't come to see
[1:17:16] one another you didn't care here come to
[1:17:18] hear a man could expound you come to
[1:17:20] meet Jesus Christ and when that
[1:17:23] expectation resides in your heart as a
[1:17:26] living reality you won't walk away
[1:17:28] disappointed you won't walk away until
[1:17:31] it's been fulfilled
[1:17:32] and then like Mary you carry this
[1:17:36] message back
[1:17:37] he's alive
[1:17:39] he's risen I met him it's not a story
[1:17:43] it's not a fable he's not a memory of
[1:17:46] the past
[1:17:47] he's alive and well
[1:17:49] living in me to tell
[1:17:51] amen
[1:17:54] Romans 3 20 says therefore by the Deeds
[1:17:56] of the law there shall no flesh be
[1:17:58] justified in his sight for the law is
[1:18:01] the knowledge or the conscience
[1:18:03] sin
[1:18:05] but now the righteousness of God without
[1:18:09] the law is manifested being witnessed by
[1:18:12] the law and the prophets even the
[1:18:14] righteousness of God
[1:18:16] which is by faith of Jesus Christ
[1:18:21] unto all and upon them all that believe
[1:18:25] for their
[1:18:28] no difference
[1:18:30] pardon me I keep reaching down turn off
[1:18:32] my for there is no
[1:18:36] difference
[1:18:39] the fall in Eden
[1:18:42] established a difference
[1:18:45] but everything don't forget this quote
[1:18:48] that the prophet of God gives us
[1:18:49] everything the first Adam
[1:18:53] lost or forfeited in the fall the second
[1:18:57] Adam restored
[1:19:01] Satan created a difference
[1:19:05] when he made Eve unbelief
[1:19:09] but God removed the difference when he
[1:19:14] became our sin
[1:19:16] our propitiation he became everything
[1:19:19] that we had become
[1:19:21] so that we could become everything we
[1:19:26] had been
[1:19:28] in his mind amen as his attributes over
[1:19:31] the expression of his life amen before
[1:19:34] the foundation of the world we're being
[1:19:36] restored friend not to a new identity
[1:19:38] but to an original identity amen that
[1:19:43] gives us amen kinship with God
[1:19:47] Hallelujah remember he was a kinsman
[1:19:50] redeemer
[1:19:52] showing Not only was he our kin but we
[1:19:56] were his
[1:19:58] Redemption means to buy something back
[1:20:02] that was fallen from its original estate
[1:20:06] or its original worth but he came to
[1:20:09] redeem he came to seek and save those
[1:20:13] that were lost
[1:20:15] oh my friend do you see it this morning
[1:20:17] foreign
[1:20:20] the righteousness of God that means it's
[1:20:23] God's which is by faith of Jesus Christ
[1:20:27] can I tell you this morning you don't
[1:20:29] even have your own faith
[1:20:31] you have his
[1:20:33] he has imparted his faith to you by the
[1:20:36] decree of his word and when you accept
[1:20:39] that word into a bedding ground of Faith
[1:20:41] Hallelujah it attaches you and it
[1:20:44] creates an Inseparable Bond
[1:20:47] I'm moving quickly but it's I just I
[1:20:50] just feel like I could run a lap around
[1:20:52] this place
[1:20:54] the righteousness of God which is by the
[1:20:56] faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon
[1:20:58] them all that belief for there is no
[1:21:01] difference
[1:21:02] for all have sinned and come short of
[1:21:05] the glory of God
[1:21:07] being justified freely by his grace
[1:21:09] through the Redemption that is in Jesus
[1:21:11] in Christ Jesus whom God hath set forth
[1:21:14] to be a propitiation
[1:21:17] that's satisfying the requirement
[1:21:19] amen how many say this morning Calvary
[1:21:22] satisfied the requirement
[1:21:25] amen we were identified there in him and
[1:21:28] remember friend you were judged in him
[1:21:31] you were in Christ when he was judged on
[1:21:35] Calvary for the sins he did not commit
[1:21:37] but you did and being joined to him and
[1:21:42] being contained within him and symbolic
[1:21:44] for me man he took our judgment amen
[1:21:48] wrapped it up in himself amen and then
[1:21:50] released
[1:21:52] a bride
[1:21:54] amen as the proof of his victory
[1:21:58] as the proof that it was a man of a
[1:22:02] valid atonement with results can you say
[1:22:04] Amen
[1:22:05] oh my God help us a propitiation through
[1:22:08] faith in his blood to declare whose
[1:22:11] righteousness
[1:22:13] does that make you self-righteous
[1:22:16] does that make you go around oh I'm the
[1:22:18] Bride of Jesus Christ I'm in the club
[1:22:21] no it's not a club it's a family that
[1:22:24] you've been joined into by the blood
[1:22:25] purchase amen
[1:22:27] Hallelujah to declare his righteousness
[1:22:31] for the remission of sins that are
[1:22:33] passed through the forbearance of God to
[1:22:35] declare I say at this time his
[1:22:38] righteousness that he might be just and
[1:22:41] the justifier of him which believeth in
[1:22:44] Jesus now I think that brother Bob was
[1:22:47] in the Sunday School lesson this morning
[1:22:48] may have just touched on the difference
[1:22:50] between Cain's approach and Abel's
[1:22:52] approach
[1:22:54] Abel's approach was an approach
[1:22:57] resulting from revelation
[1:22:59] it was the re it was the the fruit of a
[1:23:03] revelation that made him offer blood
[1:23:05] because somehow he knew blood was in the
[1:23:09] transgression and it would take blood to
[1:23:11] restore him back but Cain thought it was
[1:23:14] works
[1:23:15] he thought he could manufacture
[1:23:17] something that would appease the
[1:23:19] requirement of God and I'll just say
[1:23:21] this because he was not an expressed
[1:23:23] attribute of God all he could get was a
[1:23:27] legalistic revelation or a legalistic
[1:23:30] grasp of what God's word now don't tell
[1:23:33] me King wasn't sincere he was sincere he
[1:23:36] was trying to regain God's favor but he
[1:23:38] never had it in the first place so even
[1:23:41] when God spoke to him lit to ear and
[1:23:43] said Cain if you'll do as your brother
[1:23:46] you'll be accepted he could not do it
[1:23:48] you cannot make a Believer out of an
[1:23:51] unbeliever unless there's something on
[1:23:54] the inside
[1:23:56] amen which resonates
[1:23:58] when the word of God is presented
[1:24:02] and that that is that is the re
[1:24:05] I hope I'm not straying or I hope I'm
[1:24:07] not
[1:24:08] getting too far to limb here but it is
[1:24:11] the reconnection
[1:24:13] of the family of God
[1:24:15] amen here on the earth it is the very
[1:24:17] his very Kingdom being re-established in
[1:24:20] the Earth
[1:24:23] a justifier of him which believeth in
[1:24:26] Jesus where is boasting then
[1:24:29] it is excluded
[1:24:31] by what law of Works nay but by the law
[1:24:36] of faith therefore we conclude that a
[1:24:39] man is justified by faith without the
[1:24:44] Deeds of the law
[1:24:45] remember let me ask you this do Works
[1:24:47] follow
[1:24:49] does righteousness follow does holiness
[1:24:51] follow does a Sanctified consecrated
[1:24:54] life follow absolutely that is the proof
[1:24:58] amen that is a proof that you are under
[1:25:01] the atonement is when the life of the
[1:25:04] atonement expresses itself through you
[1:25:07] which shows a change from the man or
[1:25:09] woman you were and that old life now a
[1:25:12] new life has been born in you and you
[1:25:15] are the witness of that resurrected life
[1:25:18] whereas on the other it's just trying to
[1:25:21] manufacture oh if I can just be a better
[1:25:24] Christian
[1:25:24] or if I can be you know a more faithful
[1:25:27] church member I can pay more I can do
[1:25:29] more Penance or I'll I'll climb the
[1:25:31] climb the steps with broken glass friend
[1:25:33] that doesn't gain God's favor
[1:25:35] amen Revelation is a realization that
[1:25:38] you had God's favor all along amen and
[1:25:41] that he has washed you in his own
[1:25:44] righteousness to remove that state amen
[1:25:47] of what Satan was trying to attach to
[1:25:49] you amen but was unsuccessful because
[1:25:52] Jesus Christ strips it away
[1:25:54] oh my
[1:25:56] I'm just all over the place now but they
[1:25:59] brought a woman to Jesus one day that
[1:26:00] they had caught in the act of adultery
[1:26:02] and they weren't doing it for any
[1:26:05] justice to be served but they were doing
[1:26:08] it to give opportunity to condemn the
[1:26:10] Lord Jesus they were tempting him
[1:26:15] with the case they brought this woman
[1:26:18] caught in the act of adultery to tempt
[1:26:20] Jesus they had no interest in her they
[1:26:22] had no interest in her salvation
[1:26:25] they wanted to take the Lord in a snare
[1:26:28] so what did he do he began he knelt and
[1:26:31] began writing in the sand
[1:26:33] something about what he wrote
[1:26:35] made them all forget
[1:26:37] what it brought him there
[1:26:40] made them uncomfortable in his presence
[1:26:42] and they all Departed
[1:26:45] except for her
[1:26:48] nothing about his presence made her
[1:26:51] uncomfortable
[1:26:54] and when all the accusers had left
[1:26:58] he stood and said woman where are thy
[1:27:01] accusers
[1:27:03] where are the accusations
[1:27:06] that were levied against you before you
[1:27:10] came into my presence
[1:27:12] can you follow that
[1:27:13] she said I have none Lord
[1:27:16] they've all been dismissed they were
[1:27:20] having a court session right there a
[1:27:23] court session was being conducted and
[1:27:26] they thought that they had called the
[1:27:27] session but what they didn't realize was
[1:27:30] he had foreordained the session Amen to
[1:27:33] bring her back to the realization of who
[1:27:36] she had been all along and he said
[1:27:38] neither do I condemn thee go and sin no
[1:27:43] more
[1:27:45] now do you think she went out of that
[1:27:47] place oh I sure hope I can avoid a life
[1:27:49] of prostitution I sure hope I can live
[1:27:51] holy and righteous I'm going to try with
[1:27:54] everything that's in me to be a good
[1:27:56] Christian
[1:27:57] no
[1:27:59] it wasn't a decree or a demand
[1:28:03] with the expectation that she would
[1:28:05] fulfill it
[1:28:07] but it was a decree of his word
[1:28:11] which is power to transform
[1:28:14] when he was saying go and sin no more he
[1:28:17] was not asking her in and of herself
[1:28:21] to go and conduct a sinless life but he
[1:28:25] was giving her the protection of his
[1:28:27] word
[1:28:28] go and sin no more he was imputing unto
[1:28:33] her the power of a sinless life which
[1:28:36] comes from the decree amen of those of
[1:28:40] the highest supreme authority in the
[1:28:43] Kingdom
[1:28:44] Jesus was operating in the trifled
[1:28:47] manifestation of a prophet a priest and
[1:28:51] a king
[1:28:52] so he was placing a Royal Decree over
[1:28:55] her life amen to keep her in a sinless
[1:28:59] state until he could go and die on
[1:29:01] Calvary and send back the Holy Spirit
[1:29:03] which being enjoyed to her would enable
[1:29:07] him to live his sinless life through her
[1:29:09] Hallelujah
[1:29:12] hey oh Hallelujah I just called it
[1:29:15] caught a good nugget right here nobody
[1:29:17] else was present when he made that
[1:29:19] decree except perhaps the writer of that
[1:29:22] gospel all the doubt had been dismissed
[1:29:25] all of the false accusations had been
[1:29:29] dismissed they were in a secret chamber
[1:29:32] where she received a Royal Decree which
[1:29:35] empowered her with his power and his
[1:29:39] Divine characteristics were bestowed
[1:29:42] upon her
[1:29:43] Glory Hallelujah the world doesn't
[1:29:46] understand it they cannot comprehend it
[1:29:49] it has no meaning or Worth to them but
[1:29:51] to us it's everything
[1:29:53] Hallelujah
[1:29:55] you love the Lord this morning
[1:29:58] Philippians 3 9.
[1:30:00] and be found in him
[1:30:04] not having mine own righteousness which
[1:30:08] is of the law but that which is through
[1:30:11] the Faith of Christ
[1:30:13] the righteousness which is of god
[1:30:16] by faith
[1:30:18] that I may know him
[1:30:20] and the power of his resurrection
[1:30:22] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[1:30:25] being made conformable unto his death
[1:30:30] I want to try to come to a close here
[1:30:33] but I was just touching on it and
[1:30:35] there's a lot of depth to what I'm
[1:30:36] saying here
[1:30:37] and and I don't have really a Teaching
[1:30:39] Ministry and it wouldn't even be my
[1:30:41] place
[1:30:42] you've got some great Ministries among
[1:30:44] you
[1:30:45] that can take these things and break
[1:30:47] them down or flush them out but I do
[1:30:50] want to say this I want to I want to
[1:30:51] venture out just a bit here I believe
[1:30:52] I'm not venturing outside of what this
[1:30:55] church has been taught but in the end
[1:30:57] time revealing
[1:30:58] of the son of man
[1:31:00] we have the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:31:05] coming to Earth again
[1:31:08] in a tri-fold expression of the offices
[1:31:11] of prophet
[1:31:14] priest and King
[1:31:18] the ministry amen of the son of man
[1:31:21] was not only the office of a prophet
[1:31:25] bringing forth extracting and divinely
[1:31:29] revealing now remember Only God Can
[1:31:32] reveal his word
[1:31:36] a man can't do it Flesh and Blood hath
[1:31:39] not revealed it unto you but my father
[1:31:42] which is in heaven so it is the distinct
[1:31:45] privilege of the holy spirit amen a
[1:31:49] prophetic uh manifestation or expression
[1:31:52] of God to reveal his word to the
[1:31:56] individual
[1:31:57] and not only to reveal it to them in an
[1:32:00] understanding but an actual expression
[1:32:04] of that word
[1:32:06] amen
[1:32:08] just as Peter came out of the upper room
[1:32:09] now think about this before the upper
[1:32:12] room experience almost everything Peter
[1:32:14] said Jesus had to back it down
[1:32:17] right
[1:32:19] get behind me Satan
[1:32:21] even when he spoke on the Mount of
[1:32:22] transfiguration a voice overshadowed and
[1:32:25] said this is my beloved Son
[1:32:27] but when Peter came out of the upper
[1:32:29] room now it wasn't Peter speaking out of
[1:32:32] his own mind
[1:32:34] it was the Holy Spirit
[1:32:36] speaking through Peter which connected
[1:32:39] him to a prophecy
[1:32:42] and he stood there unashamed
[1:32:46] Unapologetic
[1:32:48] where only days before he would
[1:32:49] apologize anytime
[1:32:52] he was pressed oh I'm not one of those
[1:32:54] disciples he would he would try to
[1:32:56] disassociate because he only had a
[1:32:59] carnal understanding but when the holy
[1:33:01] spirit filled him it connected him to
[1:33:05] the prophecy
[1:33:07] and when they said what meaneth this
[1:33:10] Peter said these men are not drunk as
[1:33:12] you suppose seeing it's about the third
[1:33:15] hour of the day but this is that
[1:33:17] that was spoken by the prophet Joel
[1:33:21] he realized what was once a potential
[1:33:25] what was once a prophecy was now a
[1:33:28] reality
[1:33:30] and it made him stand very squarely on
[1:33:34] that promised word and say I'm not
[1:33:36] backing up it's not me manufacturing it
[1:33:39] it's him bringing the prophet's message
[1:33:42] to pass
[1:33:44] in my life
[1:33:45] hallelujah amen
[1:33:48] so
[1:33:50] um let me just see if I can express this
[1:33:52] the way it came to me
[1:33:54] as a prophet
[1:33:56] he's re-establishing our origin
[1:34:00] and our destiny
[1:34:03] as priests he's returning from the
[1:34:07] holiest of holies to declare our
[1:34:10] acceptance
[1:34:12] remember when he went beyond the curtain
[1:34:14] of time
[1:34:15] they said if you are accepted
[1:34:18] and you will be
[1:34:20] you will I'm paraphrasing but you you
[1:34:22] will lead us in they were coming in
[1:34:24] Under the Umbrella of the prophet's
[1:34:26] Ministry
[1:34:28] so he as a high priest amen was
[1:34:31] returning to show us amen the way to
[1:34:35] beyond the curtain of time amen was uh
[1:34:38] traversable
[1:34:40] by the believer amen whether you'd go by
[1:34:42] the way of the Grave are you part of the
[1:34:44] alive and remain you have been extended
[1:34:47] the golden scepter of God's grace to
[1:34:50] welcome you into his divine presence
[1:34:52] amen and he said and they and they
[1:34:54] testified those who were gathering they
[1:34:56] said we're already here enjoying this
[1:34:59] until the rest of those amen who come to
[1:35:02] Christ through your ministry join us
[1:35:04] here and then we'll all go right into
[1:35:07] his presence yeah
[1:35:10] Hallelujah
[1:35:12] and as king
[1:35:15] he's issuing a Royal Decree to declare
[1:35:19] our true worth
[1:35:21] and that there is no difference
[1:35:24] and he's inviting us to be seated with
[1:35:27] him in his throne
[1:35:29] remember brother Brown said he's coming
[1:35:30] now as a lion
[1:35:32] calling for his Queen to come stand by
[1:35:36] his side that comes to us through this
[1:35:39] message
[1:35:41] it's an exclusive message no reformer no
[1:35:45] Prophet no prior age took us to this
[1:35:49] level or to this understanding amen of
[1:35:52] what was in the word of God the entire
[1:35:55] time amen but it took the the ministry
[1:35:58] of the son of man it took the revealing
[1:36:01] of Christ through the office of a
[1:36:03] prophet Amen to to extract these truths
[1:36:06] from the Bible and to hand them to us
[1:36:09] for our acceptance
[1:36:11] Hallelujah and we like Mary say be it
[1:36:13] unto me according to the word to Thy
[1:36:16] word let this word find bedding ground
[1:36:18] find a resting place in my heart that I
[1:36:20] may birth it forth
[1:36:22] do you believe that this morning
[1:36:25] you know I'm gonna share this because I
[1:36:27] feel a liberty to say it
[1:36:30] when those
[1:36:32] sons of Aaron
[1:36:34] were consecrated to the priesthood there
[1:36:37] were all kinds of rituals there were all
[1:36:40] kinds of things they had to do in
[1:36:42] washing themselves sanctifying
[1:36:44] themselves the garments had to be a
[1:36:45] certain way they were all of these very
[1:36:48] uh detailed specifications that they had
[1:36:51] to follow to the letter
[1:36:53] to be able to serve God in that office
[1:36:55] of a priesthood
[1:36:57] but Moses as a prophet of God was able
[1:37:02] to ascend up onto the mountain where the
[1:37:05] holy presence of God abode
[1:37:08] without any of that ritual
[1:37:13] it was the difference in the office
[1:37:17] that gave him the exclusive privilege
[1:37:19] and I say exclusive amen but God invited
[1:37:22] Moses into its presence to show him a
[1:37:26] pattern of something that God wanted
[1:37:28] carried out on the earth within the
[1:37:31] people
[1:37:33] follow this brother and sister because
[1:37:35] Moses couldn't build the Tabernacle amen
[1:37:38] but he was taking a Divine pattern from
[1:37:41] the mind of God to the people of God to
[1:37:44] where the gifts that were reside resided
[1:37:46] in their lives could be expressed
[1:37:50] to build what was only a thought in
[1:37:52] God's mind and make it a living reality
[1:37:55] on Earth
[1:37:56] but it took the prophet's Ministry
[1:37:58] to carry the mind of God to the people
[1:38:01] of God and and I love this because you
[1:38:04] know Pharaoh just sold them as mud
[1:38:05] daubers
[1:38:06] in a land with all the riches and the
[1:38:08] wealth that Egypt had and they couldn't
[1:38:11] hardly stomp out good mud bricks
[1:38:14] but those same people got out here on
[1:38:15] the back side of the desert with nothing
[1:38:17] but sand and dead wood
[1:38:19] and built a temple
[1:38:21] and God said I have placed gifts within
[1:38:24] the lives of these men Moses amen that
[1:38:27] your ministry amen will open up
[1:38:31] you preached them this pattern and it
[1:38:34] will awaken or Quicken these gifts to
[1:38:37] construct from their lives and from
[1:38:40] their substance that is around them this
[1:38:42] Tabernacle for God's glory to come and
[1:38:45] dwell in
[1:38:47] oh my what does a prophet's Ministry do
[1:38:50] it quickens you to what was in you all
[1:38:54] the time but you were under the wrong
[1:38:56] leadership you were under a pharaoh you
[1:38:59] were under an Egyptian scheme you are
[1:39:01] under a false Kingdom but when you come
[1:39:03] under the prophets Ministry
[1:39:06] you begin expressing things and You
[1:39:09] Begin transforming ordinary things
[1:39:11] around you into something that God
[1:39:15] can come and dwell in
[1:39:17] my
[1:39:19] praise the Lord isn't it beautiful
[1:39:23] and Moses
[1:39:25] could go and invite
[1:39:27] Joshua
[1:39:29] and the Elders of Israel
[1:39:31] to come into that mount
[1:39:34] and experience God's presence too
[1:39:37] without
[1:39:39] the garments and the washing and the
[1:39:42] blood of bulls and goats and all of
[1:39:44] those
[1:39:45] sanctimonious you see being joined
[1:39:50] to the prophet's Ministry
[1:39:53] gives you the privilege of being ushered
[1:39:56] into God's very presence
[1:39:59] by what has been allocated to that
[1:40:01] ministry as God's desire
[1:40:05] it's important friend
[1:40:06] because that doesn't happen for the
[1:40:09] other nations of the world
[1:40:10] that happens for a call out people
[1:40:14] I just want to say this too this morning
[1:40:16] I'm throwing this in I see it's 12
[1:40:18] o'clock and I'll be closing
[1:40:20] there's no path back to Egypt
[1:40:26] friend
[1:40:28] we only got this far
[1:40:30] under God's Divine protection and we
[1:40:34] won't go back
[1:40:36] with that Divine protection
[1:40:38] so the only way for us to go is forward
[1:40:42] and if God takes the vessel off the
[1:40:45] scene God will raise up the same
[1:40:47] Ministry expressed in a manifold form to
[1:40:52] follow the pillar of fire on into what
[1:40:55] Moses Ministry made possible
[1:40:58] did you hear that there is a Joshua
[1:41:01] Ministry on the Earth today amen who if
[1:41:04] fully joined to Moses message will place
[1:41:08] the bride spiritually in the Canaan land
[1:41:11] to give you the to give you the strength
[1:41:13] and the courage to displace every devil
[1:41:16] that stands between you and your promise
[1:41:19] hey man with no disregard to the
[1:41:22] prophet's message this is the compliment
[1:41:25] to the prophet's message that it has
[1:41:27] enacted it has awakened it has quickened
[1:41:30] these potentials within the body of
[1:41:32] Christ
[1:41:33] which God is joining his very presence

[1:42:08] first place

[1:42:14] washed in the blood of Christ
[1:42:17] precious virtuous sinless Son of God
[1:42:20] standing with a pure unadulterated bride
[1:42:23] word
[1:42:24] that he Washed by the Water of his own
[1:42:26] blood that became flesh and manifested
[1:42:28] that he might take you which were
[1:42:30] predestinated in the bosom of the father
[1:42:32] before the beginning the same as he was
[1:42:35] he was that great attribute of God
[1:42:37] Called Love
[1:42:39] whatever you are you are Servants of God
[1:42:42] whatever God wants you to do where your
[1:42:44] place is God placed in the church
[1:42:48] some Apostles prophets teachers pastors
[1:42:52] he placed that by virtue of his own
[1:42:57] predestination and you were that to
[1:42:59] begin with
[1:43:01] can you say Amen
[1:43:02] your first wedding was annulled it was
[1:43:06] you've never done it in the first place
[1:43:07] because there's only one thing could do
[1:43:10] it that would be God come down himself
[1:43:12] and took your place
[1:43:14] in a form of the Son of God Jesus Christ
[1:43:17] and washed you by the water of the
[1:43:19] washing of the water
[1:43:21] by the word
[1:43:23] amen
[1:43:24] you know what and I'm if they want to
[1:43:26] come back to the music prepare for the
[1:43:28] buff there was a a little girl who lived
[1:43:33] in the Old Testament by the name of
[1:43:34] Esther a Hebrew
[1:43:36] and when Queen vashtai
[1:43:40] refused
[1:43:42] to come before the kingdom and display
[1:43:44] the king's Glory
[1:43:47] she was removed as Queen
[1:43:49] an opportunity was given for another to
[1:43:51] be raised up and Esther was selected
[1:43:56] now that King
[1:43:58] what was his name hazarus
[1:44:01] a hazardous did not know
[1:44:05] who this little virgin girl actually was
[1:44:10] he just knew there was something amen
[1:44:13] that radiated from her
[1:44:15] that made her a distinguished young lady
[1:44:19] in the kingdom and was the only one that
[1:44:23] did not require makeup high heels the
[1:44:25] Fashions of the world or anything else
[1:44:27] to give her value
[1:44:29] her value came from who she was
[1:44:33] and she required nothing other than what
[1:44:36] the king's chamberlains appointed her
[1:44:38] which I believe represented The
[1:44:40] Messengers to the ages they dressed the
[1:44:42] Bride of each age and all that was
[1:44:45] needed for her to be presented
[1:44:47] and accepted in God's sight
[1:44:49] so the king put her on the throne as his
[1:44:53] Queen
[1:44:55] not knowing who she actually was
[1:44:59] and as the conspiracy developed because
[1:45:02] of Haman who was a high-ranking official
[1:45:05] in the Kingdom
[1:45:07] he recognized his Reign was under the
[1:45:11] threat
[1:45:12] the threat of a specific class of people
[1:45:15] who refused to bow to him
[1:45:20] and when Mordecai refused to Bow amen a
[1:45:24] decree was given that all who refused to
[1:45:27] bound this was an irreversible decree
[1:45:30] it could not be reversed it could not be
[1:45:32] removed from the writings
[1:45:34] that if they refuse to Bow they would be
[1:45:37] punished by death and it was a decree
[1:45:40] that was designed to extinguish the
[1:45:43] Hebrew people
[1:45:46] and Haman not recognizing that Esther
[1:45:49] was one
[1:45:51] friends
[1:45:53] let me say this
[1:45:55] your power lies in the identification of
[1:45:58] Who You Are
[1:45:59] at as long as it remains a secret
[1:46:02] you are a victim
[1:46:06] you are under the threat
[1:46:08] of an irreversible decree
[1:46:11] until you have the courage
[1:46:14] to stand up
[1:46:16] and speak out and say I am
[1:46:21] a Hebrew
[1:46:23] I am one of God's
[1:46:26] I had value asterisk before you saw
[1:46:30] value
[1:46:31] the value I have isn't the value that
[1:46:34] you assigned to me when you made me your
[1:46:36] queen I had value before that that
[1:46:40] preempts what you have recognized and
[1:46:44] under the instructions of her uncle
[1:46:46] Mordecai he said you cannot keep your
[1:46:50] identity a secret
[1:46:52] otherwise you will perish and all of
[1:46:54] your people will perish but can I say
[1:46:57] this this morning if you will have the
[1:46:59] courage to come out of the closet and be
[1:47:02] identified as a Christian a Bible
[1:47:04] believing blood bulk sin's freed
[1:47:08] Christian son and daughter of God that
[1:47:11] identity is preeminent above any other
[1:47:15] king any other Throne or any other power
[1:47:19] and when she made her Origins known to
[1:47:23] that King
[1:47:25] he did not reverse his decree
[1:47:28] but he gave her his protection
[1:47:32] he gave her protection to shelter her
[1:47:36] from the power of a decree that would
[1:47:38] have otherwise killed her
[1:47:40] and any who refused to bow
[1:47:42] so by realizing you're a daughter of God
[1:47:46] the Queen of Heaven you are under a
[1:47:49] Divine protection
[1:47:51] that offsets the Judgment you were born
[1:47:54] under
[1:47:56] all have sinned and come short of the
[1:47:59] glory of God but you are under the
[1:48:01] Divine protection of his decree
[1:48:04] that has made known because of his love
[1:48:06] to you
[1:48:07] and I want to tell you he hasn't given
[1:48:09] up to half of his kingdom he has given
[1:48:11] you a seat
[1:48:12] in his throne
[1:48:14] we don't need closet Christians
[1:48:17] we don't need closet message believers
[1:48:19] we need boldness to step out on faith
[1:48:22] and say I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter
[1:48:25] of God I am proud of the Heritage that
[1:48:28] God has given me and I'm standing here
[1:48:30] on the Earth today as a witness that
[1:48:33] he's alive and well
[1:48:35] amen we have an advocate this morning
