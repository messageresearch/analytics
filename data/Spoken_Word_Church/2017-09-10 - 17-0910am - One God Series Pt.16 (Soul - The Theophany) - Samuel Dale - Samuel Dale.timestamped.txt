[8:40] take care of everybody and bless and
[8:43] guide each one in Jesus name Amen John
[8:49] one and then we're going to Genesis in
[8:55] the beginning was the word and the Word
[8:58] was with God and the Word was God
[9:01] the same was in the beginning with God
[9:04] all things were made by him and without
[9:08] him was not anything made that was made
[9:11] in him was life and the life was a lot
[9:14] of men and the light shining in darkness
[9:16] and the darkness comprehended it not
[9:19] there was no way the darkness can it
[9:22] can't do anything to light it doesn't
[9:25] matter how dark it gets he can't put the
[9:27] light out there's no way it doesn't
[9:29] matter how dark it keeps getting all
[9:32] right let's go to Genesis 1:26 and 27
[9:38] where we've been reading some and just
[9:43] and God said let us make man in our
[9:47] image after our likeness and let them
[9:50] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[9:51] and over the fowl of the air and over
[9:54] the cattle and over all the earth and
[9:57] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[9:59] upon the earth so God created man in his
[10:02] own image and the image of God created
[10:05] he him male and female created he them
[10:09] now let's continue on and God blessed
[10:14] them and God said unto them be fruitful
[10:17] and multiply and replenish the earth and
[10:21] subdue it and have dominion over the
[10:24] fish of the sea you know
[10:25] follow the air and over every living
[10:27] thing that moveth upon the earth you may
[10:31] be seated the Lord had his blessing to
[10:33] the reading of the word now I'm going to
[10:39] quote a lot and we're not gonna pull it
[10:44] up on the screen because we've done it
[10:46] so much but I'll be quoting for a while
[10:48] till we get on over good piece into the
[10:51] message and then we will start to read
[10:54] some you know alright now what have we
[10:58] been talking about I'm trying to I tried
[11:02] to get this to an end last Sunday but it
[11:05] didn't ever work so you know I was
[11:09] really intending to just come out last
[11:12] Sunday and say wait I'm gonna take the
[11:14] evening service and finish up what I've
[11:17] got well I decided no no I won't do that
[11:20] well as quick as he started the service
[11:24] and started ministering I saw why I
[11:27] didn't say that
[11:28] so I said okay I'll just do it next
[11:32] Monday you know he wouldn't take care of
[11:35] it the coast there's more added to the
[11:38] story than just the thoughts of what
[11:41] we're doing and you're getting bored
[11:43] maybe by me going over and over the
[11:47] point of trying to follow before the
[11:51] foundation of the world and coming into
[11:55] reality but I thought the Prophet said
[12:00] when the bride realizes who she is and
[12:04] what she's doing here well who is she
[12:07] you know not that it's not that mankind
[12:10] down through time through the church
[12:12] ages has not understood that they were
[12:15] the children of God it's like I said to
[12:18] you in one of the services when wisdom
[12:20] Baptist Church we talked about we read
[12:23] the Bible we read the parables and we
[12:25] talk about being the children of God
[12:27] right Presbyterian donut Baptist
[12:30] Methodist whatever we all had that in
[12:33] the thoughts well that was great but
[12:35] it's truth but then you go to them and
[12:39] you say well okay now we're the children
[12:41] of God and that's okay we're the
[12:45] children of God so come on down to where
[12:47] we are and you come to the message
[12:49] people you know that they're supposed to
[12:51] know the truth and you say where the
[12:55] children got a man we're the children of
[12:57] God and then you talk to them a little
[12:59] bit and you'll see them they'll go back
[13:01] with you far enough to reach maybe
[13:05] thoughts of predestination I'm talking
[13:08] about over in the message people and
[13:12] even moving to the points of talking
[13:15] about you know foreknowledge and how
[13:19] that God foreknew you well we could do
[13:21] those things in in the Baptist Church we
[13:24] had thoughts on that line you know
[13:27] because we talked about it all right
[13:30] but we know now here's my point my point
[13:32] is we know comparing what we see now to
[13:37] what we saw in the Baptist Methodist
[13:39] Presbyterian etc then it's went into a
[13:43] deeper understanding unfolding more of
[13:47] truth alright and as we understand and
[13:51] unfold more the truth the further we can
[13:53] go backward right are you following me
[13:57] well see then we move into the message
[13:59] realm and we're into the deeper
[14:03] understanding of that and we look back
[14:05] and say well you know we believe that
[14:07] then but oh look what we see now look at
[14:10] the opening of God's Word now scriptures
[14:12] we used to wonder why it said this and
[14:15] why it said that you know and say you
[14:19] know like scripture says now we are the
[14:21] sons of God well you know well didn't I
[14:24] remember back DNA to argue backwards and
[14:27] forth about that understanding you know
[14:29] and it wouldn't open up all right but
[14:31] then you know you come into the message
[14:35] realm and you begin to get a better
[14:38] understanding of the scriptures and more
[14:41] unfolds to us by way of the message of
[14:45] the hour
[14:46] all right and we look back and say well
[14:48] not look that was fine
[14:50] but look what we see now compared to
[14:53] that and are you are you with me I'm
[14:56] trying to get a thought to you you you
[14:58] think about where you're sitting today
[15:00] and where you was when you were in the
[15:03] denominations or something prior to
[15:06] where you are it's not nothing new right
[15:13] we talked about those things all right
[15:17] let's see it's more plainer clearer more
[15:21] of understanding coming into our our
[15:25] parts that we understand and we're
[15:28] beginning to see who we are the other
[15:31] wanted to prophet say when the bride
[15:33] realized who she is and what she's here
[15:35] for
[15:35] what are we here for we're here to
[15:38] conquer Satan and that these bodies are
[15:41] to be changed we're not here to just
[15:44] bring redemption into the viewing of the
[15:46] new birth that was down through time and
[15:48] that's been through that and all of that
[15:50] is well and good but we're here to
[15:53] bringing it to the final which would be
[15:55] the redemption of the body you know all
[15:58] right and to do that we say well what
[16:02] all we need to do is just read this that
[16:03] or the other no it's got to be revealed
[16:05] all right so then do you understand what
[16:08] I'm getting at so we come up into the
[16:10] message and we begin to understand
[16:12] predestination as we never understood it
[16:14] before then we begin to talk about
[16:18] foreknowledge you know all right and
[16:22] then we begin to say you know well
[16:23] foreknowledge comes before
[16:25] predestination because those who he for
[16:28] know he did predestinate all right now
[16:31] we're getting a clearer understanding
[16:33] and what I'm trying to drive that that
[16:37] means that if you're getting a clear
[16:38] understanding it means you're able to go
[16:41] back further and don't worry about going
[16:44] that away now all right and I told you a
[16:48] long time ago I said I'm not interesting
[16:51] going heaven I said I'm interested in
[16:54] heaven coming here and I thought
[16:58] heavenly places was where we started
[17:00] from
[17:00] all right now see then to see the point
[17:04] then it's unfolding and as it unfolds we
[17:08] can go back feather in two as we call it
[17:12] the mind of God
[17:14] the things and the realities of the
[17:17] Scriptures and where the morning stars
[17:19] sang together the sons of God shouted
[17:20] for joy and where Jesus said he knew us
[17:24] before the foundation of the world and
[17:25] talking to the disciples and everything
[17:27] the scripture said we were chosen in him
[17:29] those things should be unfailing a
[17:33] better look at what's taking place or
[17:36] what took place in your new birth and
[17:38] bringing you up to it by the message of
[17:41] the hour all right and see then it means
[17:44] that we wear that will keep going back
[17:47] father I hope you understand that point
[17:49] oh no I want to go that way we'll
[17:52] remember eternity goes just as far that
[17:55] way as it goes that away all right so
[17:59] I'm not interested in that because all
[18:02] of that's got to come here now you're
[18:06] chained to the body's not going to take
[18:08] place up in heaven just as the natural
[18:10] point right all right so then we're
[18:13] going back into the mind of God to see
[18:16] the realities of understanding you know
[18:18] I've listened twice to last Sunday
[18:21] service and I wish you would listen to
[18:23] that service if you don't have a
[18:26] computer whatever I wish you would get
[18:29] Richard then we'll make you a copy on
[18:31] the CDs or whatever needed do where you
[18:34] can can go back and and listen to that I
[18:37] wish you would you know I kind of
[18:39] enjoyed it myself okay because see what
[18:45] I do
[18:45] listen sure what I do is not set during
[18:48] think Boyd great now man I laid that on
[18:50] that time I was doing real good that's
[18:52] stupidity no I'm thinking Lord look
[18:56] where you brought us from
[18:59] and where we are now well I just don't
[19:04] see very much I'm just you don't well
[19:09] okay we'll get away from that but listen
[19:13] she didn't in thinking I asked the
[19:18] questions where were we and who were we
[19:27] before the foundation world I was last
[19:28] Sunday's thought in relation who were we
[19:33] and where were we all right
[19:35] and then I asked you to do that with one
[19:41] thing in mind
[19:44] can you find the soul of God in the Old
[19:48] Testament you remember that
[19:50] ask it over and over you don't try to
[19:57] find the body because the body or
[19:59] literal corporal we understand that it
[20:01] wasn't back there even Melchizedek's and
[20:06] etc the times it was met was a body
[20:08] spoken into existence spoken out of
[20:10] existence that body could not die for
[20:13] you that could not that was not your
[20:15] brother because it was not brought
[20:17] through the wound of the humanity to be
[20:20] able to bring it to being our kin folks
[20:23] all right and I asked you I said can you
[20:28] I said you can see you know don't need
[20:30] to worry about the body I said but you
[20:32] see the Spirit of God back there as it
[20:34] would anoint those prophets and the
[20:37] great things that would take place under
[20:40] them and their their messages for the
[20:42] day and you can follow that spirit and
[20:45] you can keep following that spirit as
[20:47] you come into the New Testament because
[20:49] as it comes into the New Testament we
[20:52] talk about anointed ones of how that you
[20:55] can be anointed on your spirit and still
[20:59] be lost with the genuine baptism of the
[21:03] Holy Spirit upon your spirit now there
[21:07] was a time that was a mass confusion
[21:10] right but it's beginning to unfold I
[21:15] hope nowhere we can understand well but
[21:18] I ask you that the end of the message
[21:20] could you find the soul of God that guy
[21:25] remember the soul is the nature of the
[21:30] Spirit right now so then we can look
[21:35] back there and see not only at the time
[21:37] that that anointing could be on Moses
[21:39] and and beyond all those great prophets
[21:43] that we could follow and I hope you
[21:45] listen to the end of it that we could
[21:48] follow then to see the nature of God as
[21:51] it unfolded through the Old Testament
[21:53] how that it was judgment to David that
[21:57] even he called his own you know when
[22:00] they was told about the sheep and they
[22:02] you know that I'm in all true that had
[22:04] happened through what was his name Uriah
[22:07] is that his name you know and he said
[22:12] bring him here I'll kill it and
[22:15] automatically the prophet what did he
[22:16] say he didn't say David now you're too
[22:19] good of a guy for God to kill so now
[22:21] I've talked this over with the Lord and
[22:23] we decided to leave you here now that
[22:26] wasn't exactly what happened what did
[22:29] the Prophet immediately say he didn't
[22:32] say David we'll work out something God
[22:35] will forgive you not as quick as it was
[22:37] said from David I'll kill him myself
[22:41] he didn't explain to David that David
[22:45] was the bad guy he said David you won't
[22:48] die I prayed for you right there's the
[22:54] nature of God where is the nature of God
[22:57] in the beginning when sin entered the
[22:59] picture the nature of God came into
[23:03] being - in some form you want to call it
[23:06] and we talked about it being the soul of
[23:08] God and the theophany
[23:10] you realize God pull the skin off of
[23:15] those animals that's pretty strong ended
[23:18] when he pull that skin off those animals
[23:21] and wrapped Adam and Eva
[23:23] there's a nature of God when you see
[23:27] everything was ready to be destroyed but
[23:30] God would move on the scene the Bible
[23:34] said it was ten times that they taught
[23:37] they trouble God from the time they left
[23:39] Egypt to Katy's Barnea said ten times
[23:45] ten times has done it every time they
[23:49] were still headed to the promised land
[23:51] now watch them when they sealed her own
[23:54] sail and they went the wrong way at
[23:57] Cadiz Barnea and we're not able to go
[23:59] into the land but you know what a lot of
[24:02] them still went into the life you
[24:08] understand what I'm getting at can you
[24:09] find and the nature of God with the
[24:13] three Hebrew children and the fiery
[24:14] furnace and the fourth man can you find
[24:19] that nature of God as he takes care of
[24:23] the people of children of Israel and I
[24:25] remember that statement when I first
[24:27] heard it letter Brown said God didn't
[24:29] step in heaven when man sinned he said
[24:32] he come down to live with man upon earth
[24:35] what even in the sinful parts it was an
[24:40] atom hunting for God it was God
[24:43] searching for Adam see that way you can
[24:46] find the soul of God the very nature of
[24:50] God his very being whose back tire our
[24:54] Hebrews 13:8 is messed up
[24:59] do you understand Hebrews 13:8 said it's
[25:02] the same yesterday today and forever
[25:04] now there was no way to transmit that
[25:07] life that soul could do all of those
[25:12] things but it could not be transmitted
[25:14] into mankind even though the spirit
[25:18] could anoint great things but yet it had
[25:23] to wait until that nature that being
[25:27] that sold that person came into being
[25:29] which was the Lord Jesus Christ then he
[25:33] could give his life in what the body
[25:37] would go to the grave the spirit would
[25:40] go back to God who gave it
[25:41] but to soul then would go down and
[25:47] witness to those people in the long
[25:51] suffer in the days of Noah come right
[25:53] back up my paradise is this call and
[25:56] pick up what the souls of those people
[25:59] what we're in that this their what no
[26:01] body in it their body was in the grave
[26:03] spirit went back to God who gave it
[26:06] it was the soul of those people in
[26:10] paradise he could pick them up bring
[26:13] them up into the earth and in the great
[26:15] things right alright so then can you
[26:20] follow the soul of God through the
[26:21] nature of how he displays himself and
[26:25] look was not Jesus the very nature of
[26:28] Almighty God is that true
[26:32] he was forgiving in ever form right
[26:39] he was forgiving in ever form of life
[26:43] that could beat him that could do
[26:44] everything - right that was the very
[26:50] nature of God
[26:54] not just an anointing of the Spirit but
[26:59] the very nature the very person of
[27:02] Almighty God all right see then that's
[27:06] where we found what we were talking
[27:08] about how that back before the world
[27:12] ever begun brother Branham on that I'm
[27:15] just going to quote and run across from
[27:16] God who is rich in mercy some part of
[27:19] you was back tyre you were one of his
[27:24] attributes some part of you was back
[27:27] there what part of you in back there not
[27:29] your body not your spirit the soul of
[27:37] the individual is what we're dealing
[27:40] with souls in prison brother Brown said
[27:42] if he can get that soul just to stand
[27:45] steal he said didn't nature he said
[27:49] it'll die what the very soul of Almighty
[27:53] God dwelling in a man because he was
[27:57] body spirit and soul Almighty God sees
[28:02] into your father and what I'm talking
[28:04] about
[28:04] we found the only way that we could be
[28:07] back before the foundation or was to be
[28:09] a part of God see then that is not just
[28:17] for knowledge that is not just in the
[28:21] mind of God as I said to you for 40
[28:24] years I don't want to think about just
[28:27] being in the mind of God because Judas
[28:30] was dark all the sin is there I was
[28:33] listening we was like not to message and
[28:35] brother Brian said everybody in the
[28:38] world was saved when Jesus died at
[28:42] Calvary what's wrong they won't have it
[28:50] he said they won't accept it whatever
[28:54] body was saved when the book of life was
[28:58] written there is two sections what you
[29:00] got the book of life which it can
[29:02] contain a lot of different names Judas
[29:04] in him but then you got the book of the
[29:06] life of the Lamb there were
[29:07] slain and those are only the ones with
[29:10] eternal life those are their children
[29:12] our offspring of Almighty God he said
[29:16] yeah but you're getting too close you
[29:17] talk about a soul and said you've
[29:20] hollered at us for all the years to get
[29:22] us away from the Mormon doctrine of pre
[29:25] existence of souls I know that doctrine
[29:31] I've talked with the people they don't
[29:33] believe you're so they believe in actual
[29:35] people being there finds you want to
[29:38] talk to it they believe in literal
[29:42] people or something being that no I've
[29:46] never said a word about literal people
[29:47] I've drove it hard the only way you and
[29:49] I was there was back there in God if you
[29:53] have eternal life this day that eternal
[29:56] life was in God before the world ever
[29:58] begun our you'll never have eternal life
[30:01] all right see them to see they were not
[30:04] talking about souls running all over the
[30:08] place over heaven and then we decide to
[30:11] do this you're talking about one soul
[30:14] because he ain't divided yet I know
[30:18] about back on him you talk about one
[30:20] show there's only one eternal life right
[30:25] there's only one eternal theophany
[30:30] there's only one soul that's eternal and
[30:35] that is the soul of God all right if we
[30:39] can see that we was back dire in him we
[30:42] gave the quote from the Prophet how that
[30:44] we were in him and by being in him we
[30:49] had to be part of him just as your
[30:53] children a part of you then we had to
[30:57] come forth and be displayed on earth sin
[31:00] had to enter the picture we'll get to
[31:02] those things you stay with me were mad
[31:06] and see by being that brother brother
[31:10] said some part of you some part of me he
[31:13] said was dire
[31:18] when God created man he said some part
[31:28] of me william branham he said was back
[31:32] there in which he went on to say in that
[31:36] same paragraph what some part of me
[31:38] armand neville some part of our Mandel
[31:41] and said some part of you was back there
[31:44] what was it well it's just a spirit
[31:48] floating right well then we're just
[31:49] spirits floating right remember if he
[31:56] was the word with the often II is a word
[31:59] body we'll get to that we haven't done
[32:00] that and don't worry about it we're
[32:02] brother run said we might by Stan we'll
[32:04] get to that and cover it because that's
[32:06] no problem we just never come that away
[32:09] Jesus came that away and created the
[32:11] world but we had to be in him when he
[32:14] was created in the world go who is in
[32:17] him when he walked on the shores of
[32:19] Galilee in what now you can see it's not
[32:23] a bunch of souls little spots little
[32:25] things over here these people make that
[32:27] drawing and it was people looking oh yes
[32:29] that's so wonderful I can see it now we
[32:32] was little spots I'm sorry I go back too
[32:43] far too old and whenever you remember in
[32:46] the first grade school run spot run see
[32:51] spot run he said what are you saying I'm
[32:57] saying that silly the thing with little
[32:59] spots no before the world we were not
[33:05] there as souls of us we were there in
[33:09] him see little random own leaning not to
[33:19] your own understand
[33:20] he said God isn't complete without you
[33:26] he said on Christ is revealed in his own
[33:29] word he said do we were dire in germ
[33:32] form germ form is what a germ is not a
[33:41] seed a germ is a life prior to a stage
[33:45] called seed right the germ of life he's
[33:51] died before the husk and everything
[33:52] comes on then what we call seed brother
[33:56] brother said on modern events make
[33:58] honesty in modern events he said we were
[34:03] a soul of God he said own broken cistern
[34:13] we were souls a part of God we were in
[34:17] him demonology physical realm he said
[34:24] our souls were made up before the
[34:26] foundation of the world
[34:32] ezekiel 18:4 sit all souls are mine but
[34:37] remember there wasn't anything back
[34:39] before the foundation world with
[34:40] Almighty God I thought I'm driving to us
[34:44] to see anything that I'm saying that was
[34:46] back there's got to be in God not us
[34:50] with God you said well we've got one now
[34:55] see I swear you Trinitarians when he's
[34:57] Trinitarian to John 1 in the beginning
[35:00] was the word Word was with God but they
[35:06] don't read the rest in the word was
[35:07] called see we were with God in the
[35:12] beginning as being a part of God if we
[35:16] have eternal life if we don't we're not
[35:20] a part of him that should be enough to
[35:23] settle it right look
[35:29] on the faith of Abraham he said you
[35:31] begin with a soul and he said that's
[35:35] when God created man 1 26 and 27 of
[35:42] Genesis he didn't create man over in the
[35:47] sixth day or that man as a spiritual
[35:51] being was created before the world ever
[35:54] begun or as a part of God not people's
[36:01] identities a part of God you must be
[36:12] born again he said what is a soul he
[36:15] said you are a soul Jesus died when
[36:30] Jesus died it was a soul that died now
[36:34] come on we've been through it so don't
[36:36] run your mind off and the people out
[36:37] there brother Brennan said God never
[36:39] died in spirit and see God never died in
[36:43] soul he acted the part of death he
[36:48] stepped out of that body and went down
[36:51] to hell to witness to those people and
[36:53] to come back up through paradise he
[36:56] never died it's just a statement it's a
[37:01] way of saying things when Jesus died it
[37:05] was the soul of God when do no good with
[37:09] the spirit part of it and you just
[37:12] enormous we knew all kind of things now
[37:17] come on
[37:18] to keep the message running right
[37:20] remember that soul is the nature of the
[37:22] spirit when I remember what I always
[37:27] expressed because I feel led to do that
[37:29] part you know yourself that in brother
[37:32] Browns early ministry he basically I
[37:35] said basically coat is not over time
[37:37] basically he told body
[37:41] so spirit he sought the soul as the
[37:51] second dream the spirit is the center
[37:53] but then when it opened unto him and he
[37:56] came on father I'm quoting from the
[37:58] message and North it not but around said
[38:01] its body spirit and soul as God as a
[38:05] trying being and that's what you are
[38:09] you're a body spirit and soul see
[38:12] there's word that Hebrews comes into
[38:14] being that the Bible said in Hebrews
[38:18] what is it
[38:19] Hebrews 12 or 14 at which 4:12 where
[38:23] he's talking about the the things that
[38:26] are made manifest and clear to us even
[38:29] the body spirit and soul it's clear to
[38:33] us by the opening of the word that's
[38:35] what it's saying me brother Branham did
[38:39] not have to explain because nobody else
[38:44] understood what was going on anyway
[38:45] that's the best way to say it and solve
[38:47] the whole problem alright but what
[38:51] happened when Jesus went to hell it was
[38:55] his soul that went to hell it was him in
[39:00] theophany because his soul is it was its
[39:04] theophany little random own questions
[39:10] and answers he said he sold his
[39:13] theophany was in paradise now remember
[39:18] there's two parts of that because he
[39:19] worth went to hell he didn't bring none
[39:22] of them out that was those that were
[39:25] disobedient long-suffering but then he
[39:28] came over to those in the in the
[39:30] paradise it was called and he took out
[39:32] but remember he didn't take all of them
[39:34] out you say well I've got a quote were
[39:37] part of I've got a quote - the Bible
[39:39] says all the Old Testament Saints never
[39:42] raised
[39:45] he said well how's that don't know I
[39:47] don't know and he's not what the
[39:49] scripture says
[39:50] right all right little Brennan said on
[39:53] entombment his whole soul his spirit his
[39:58] theophany of his being went to hell to
[40:03] preach and see that's what it was
[40:06] waiting that body was laying in the
[40:08] grave that spirit had went back to God
[40:11] who gave it the soul was in paradise and
[40:15] all doing all of those things cuz that
[40:17] was his being and he says who is that
[40:21] soul he said Abraham saw that soul that
[40:26] theophany that being of that person and
[40:30] fed him a cave you remember what we
[40:31] talked about he said Moses stood and
[40:34] looked the other way in other words in
[40:36] the cleft of the rock and God went by
[40:39] and he said he saw the back part little
[40:41] run said that was the back part of Jesus
[40:43] Christ well because that was his
[40:45] theophany that was his soul you know but
[40:48] I don't see a soul is being real why not
[40:51] is your spirit more real than your soul
[40:54] is your body more real than the spirit
[40:56] in the soul why don't you see that but
[41:00] see the problem is we're not going to
[41:02] lay down our thinking see if we've sung
[41:06] songs we've preached about I got a
[41:08] theophany up in the heavens waiting on
[41:12] me
[41:16] your prophet says your soul is youth the
[41:18] often and he said even a sinner had a
[41:21] theophany because that means a body to
[41:24] go to when he was in hell those people
[41:27] that were in hell
[41:28] were there in bodies not human flex
[41:32] bodies their soul was there we were
[41:37] going to lay down our thinking except
[41:38] what's said by the Prophet when he says
[41:42] your soul is your theophany this page 80
[41:46] of the whole of the Hebrew book you
[41:48] wanted o natus I'll get it in a minute
[41:50] it's 2 to 78 or 478 or something
[41:55] paragraph they say old age ad in the
[41:58] Hebrew book see his soul was his
[42:02] theophany or the body that he was in
[42:05] which was not a natural body but it was
[42:10] his being new and he says on the message
[42:16] who is this Melchizedek said there he
[42:18] was turned back in to that theophany see
[42:26] that's what happened that the often
[42:27] Easter so the soul it was a did not
[42:30] Jesus say into thy hands I commend my
[42:34] soul he said what's old in spirit soul
[42:38] experience an interchangeable word
[42:40] that's why I said even mankind never
[42:42] knew those things so then spirit is
[42:44] totally interchangeable when you're
[42:46] trying to define which one is which and
[42:47] as I said Sunday you take this the
[42:50] spirit the word spirit this means your
[42:52] spirit or this spirit or a spirit coming
[42:54] it means the devil in the spirit it
[42:56] doesn't define the difference you've got
[42:58] to define whether it's speaking of God
[43:00] are speaking of you
[43:03] see because the truth is the truth so
[43:08] let's start from their own net and let
[43:10] me let me just get to that point I told
[43:12] them we we jumped a number or number 818
[43:17] if you think I don't have a lot of it I
[43:20] go over to 44 so you do what you want to
[43:24] and get him up here going that far so
[43:28] let's look at what he's saying from the
[43:32] message who is this Melchizedek which
[43:34] would be number 19 well they believe 18
[43:37] leave 18 let's get here okay that's from
[43:42] the adoption Paul says he does not
[43:44] appear welcome but you know but we know
[43:45] that we'll have a body like his well did
[43:47] he ever have that theophany body yes sir
[43:49] when he died the Bible said he is a
[43:52] personal pronoun uh again personal
[43:55] pronoun again he went to hell and
[43:58] preached to the souls in prison
[44:00] hallelujah he preached to the souls that
[44:02] were in hell that repented not in the
[44:05] long suffering the days of Noah then he
[44:07] rose up with the Old Testament Saints
[44:09] coming up and he's bringing them up look
[44:12] 72 hours he was up said that theophany
[44:17] that body that went and preached to the
[44:19] souls that were in prison they repented
[44:21] not the long-suffering in the days of
[44:24] Noah he was there in his soul his
[44:30] theophany he said well what is the
[44:32] theophany
[44:33] a theophany is a word body lettering
[44:36] said not like it is in the glorified
[44:39] state but who's it going to look like
[44:44] you can make light oh you won't to
[44:46] anybody out darting to say what I'll
[44:48] tell you want that brother Dale please
[44:49] it that I believe what the Prophet said
[44:52] he said Hoffman's head of Christ at 33
[44:55] was the closest
[44:59] to God that there was of Jesus that he
[45:02] saw well you know what I'm not gonna go
[45:06] look for a bunch of other people to look
[45:08] like because I don't know the the point
[45:10] that he said it's the closest well why
[45:16] can't we believe it you said what is
[45:18] your guard look like Jesus Christ was my
[45:22] god is that your God and he looked like
[45:26] Hoffman's and even brother branham that
[45:29] defines it because the other one looked
[45:30] very close its Brahm or something like
[45:32] that or brown that's very close to
[45:34] similarities he said I don't like that
[45:37] one
[45:38] you know he saw what he saw when are we
[45:42] going to believe it
[45:43] alright let's go to 19 then what started
[45:45] just a little bit I'm trying to finish
[45:49] this where do you think it or not but it
[45:51] just keeps piling up so okay alright
[45:54] forgive me then when a man is born again
[45:58] from heaven he becomes a spirit babe in
[46:01] Christ because you see it don't matter
[46:03] what you think about what you were back
[46:05] there when we get that straightened out
[46:07] and if I you still got to be born again
[46:11] that eternal life has got to come into
[46:13] you that's a lot of the story yet right
[46:16] what and then when this robe of flesh is
[46:20] dropped there is a natural body
[46:22] theophany a body not made with hands
[46:24] neither born of woman that we go to
[46:27] that's fine the sinner has a place he
[46:31] has to go to which is his soul it's the
[46:35] off me we got a place to go to when we
[46:37] die then what then when this rover
[46:44] Fletcher dropped there's a natural body
[46:45] theophany a body not made with hands
[46:47] neither born of woman that would go to
[46:49] then that body returns back and picks up
[46:51] the glorified body okay that's the
[46:53] reason Jesus went to hell when he died
[46:55] and preached to the souls that were in
[46:57] prison turned back into that theophany
[47:00] Oh marvelous thank God turn back into
[47:03] that theophany so his soul was this
[47:07] theophan
[47:10] and like I said then if you'll get it
[47:12] straight and think about it you'll see
[47:14] that nature of God through that soul of
[47:17] God as it comes through the Old
[47:19] Testament coming right down he just
[47:23] didn't wait until coming go maybe I
[47:27] quote brother branham if I miss quoted I
[47:29] believe it's right this way didn't he
[47:31] say he said if you if you don't see
[47:33] Christ in every verse go back and read
[47:36] it again see not Jesus because Jesus the
[47:39] flesh wasn't back there Jesus the flesh
[47:41] was not the one that tore the skins off
[47:44] the animals with Jesus the God who has
[47:49] done it he clothed him with skin those
[47:56] nerves were no good now come on get your
[47:58] story right you know what brother Ron
[48:00] said about Adam and Eve he said there's
[48:01] over in the bushes having church right
[48:04] with their fig leaves God ripped off him
[48:12] skins and told him in there and said
[48:13] here put these on now come on out
[48:15] he said blood splattering all over him
[48:18] as they were leaving the garden blood
[48:21] splattering down their legs he said
[48:22] right tires were God wrung out and said
[48:25] we're hold it
[48:26] I'll put enmity between thy seed and the
[48:29] seed of the woman you won't die
[48:35] there's the soul of God not just the
[48:39] spirit to anoint I'm trying to get you
[48:42] to see the real God he said well God is
[48:45] just a spirit then he could know anybody
[48:47] and they saved
[48:51] but you got to receive the very person
[48:53] of Jesus Christ into your soul to have
[48:59] eternal life
[49:00] come on okay go ahead question as an
[49:02] answered on Hebrews number twenty God in
[49:10] the beginning when he knowed that man
[49:13] and woman was made one not two now
[49:17] follow it
[49:18] you remember Sunday I kept emphasizing
[49:21] Adam and Eve you've got to read what
[49:23] your prophet said you got to believe
[49:25] they were one in theophany cuz we'll
[49:27] read that in just a minute if you can
[49:32] see that there's not the one of the
[49:33] often e eternal the other one is going
[49:38] the other way brethren said one goes up
[49:40] one goes down see then you can see
[49:44] there's just one eternal life now that's
[49:46] the question run around the house he
[49:48] said is a to eternal life he's a noted
[49:52] on the one eternal man who always made
[49:58] one not two they were one made one they
[50:01] were separated one put in flesh one of
[50:05] the theophany now what kind of a man did
[50:11] God make first spirit man right what
[50:15] spirit man spirit man control the garden
[50:20] and I who was it theophany so Adam
[50:25] walked in the garden and led the animals
[50:27] inside before he ever walked are in
[50:28] humans legs come on right so in order to
[50:34] prove that when God made the woman he
[50:37] never took some dust and made her like
[50:38] he did the man he took a rib out of the
[50:41] side of Adam and she become a bright
[50:44] product of a man that's what I asked you
[50:46] you don't even go do it
[50:47] go look of my product
[50:51] we want to make it some dirty something
[50:54] remember God made it did he make Eve
[51:00] wrong he can't judge if he made it wrong
[51:05] my product means of equal value are
[51:10] great or older that don't fit in my mind
[51:13] I've always my mama said my brother my
[51:16] uncle Cedric and I say brother I don't
[51:22] even like the jokes of the people of
[51:24] this message I'm serious
[51:28] the people of this message get up in the
[51:30] pulpit and said see there then women or
[51:33] byproducts anywhere they can that's
[51:36] close to blaspheming believe what you
[51:39] want to you know it said and done they
[51:44] make the woman something but the Prophet
[51:47] they never preach that Eve was not taken
[51:49] from another he sees a byproduct the way
[51:52] they made it she would have had to been
[51:53] took from another piece of dirt she was
[51:56] not she was taken from a rib of Adam she
[52:00] was in Adam Adam and Eve were one look
[52:06] one foot in flesh when it's the off knee
[52:08] he says she's part of him huh
[52:13] go ahead what do we got number all right
[52:17] let's go to this one number 21 is take a
[52:22] little question and answer it on Hebrews
[52:23] he's coming down and he no man to till
[52:27] the soil God put him in flesh so he
[52:29] could tell us oh I'll give him five
[52:30] senses Matilda so on fix it up the
[52:33] vineyards as I the man still looked
[52:35] lonesome
[52:41] Eve was in Adam at that time in the
[52:45] rewrite but she was not in Adam at that
[52:48] time in theophany you're gonna read it
[52:53] Adam had done come into flesh do you
[52:58] look long from when he come into flesh
[53:02] Eve was inside of him that's great but
[53:05] just remember that theophany was not
[53:07] there aviv and remember Adam and Eve had
[53:11] only one theophany we're gonna read that
[53:13] so you can do what you want to look for
[53:16] when he was first made he was made two
[53:19] people together he was both made both
[53:22] male and female the man was the Bible
[53:25] said he was God made both male and
[53:27] female created he him notice now when
[53:32] man was separated from the theophany and
[53:34] put in the flesh he was he wasn't just
[53:37] all together dark part of his being was
[53:39] still a theophany
[53:41] so it didn't look like he had him
[53:46] standing in human flesh on their Eve's
[53:48] inside of him called hurry up
[53:51] would he still lonely because they
[53:56] couldn't couldn't fellowship come on I
[53:59] went to male and female in the cow there
[54:01] went the horse that I went to hogs and
[54:02] there went everything else person but
[54:05] Adam he it was there was something
[54:08] lacking that very crave showed that
[54:12] there was a mate waiting for him you get
[54:15] it in the very thoughts that we have to
[54:17] die here and join us shows us I'm
[54:19] waiting for us alright Adam was lonesome
[54:22] and God to show that they could not be
[54:26] separated now I'm going to get back into
[54:30] this same thing just a second look he
[54:33] never went and got dirt and made a Eve
[54:36] but he made from the original dirt Adam
[54:39] he took a real from his side and made
[54:41] him a help me that was easy
[54:43] she was made for the mahan and part of
[54:47] the man
[54:48] and the read she was part of him in the
[54:52] beginning in the creation in the
[54:54] theophany she was part of him down here
[55:00] in this creation she could not be
[55:03] divided in another creation she had to
[55:05] be made in the same creation he had to
[55:11] be the creator himself but he still does
[55:14] theophany come on she was part of him go
[55:22] ahead in number 22 we had number 22 take
[55:30] on the Hebrews chapter 2 he done made
[55:33] male and female there's no man to till
[55:36] the soil and we just read it he was part
[55:44] of him in theophany right now what's he
[55:46] talking about there's no man to till the
[55:49] soil but he's already my own female read
[55:59] but we don't like we got it figured out
[56:02] brother so Angela said it's okay if I'm
[56:03] not my brother so don't forget what
[56:05] you're doing I'm trying to get nothing
[56:06] I'm trying to dis preach the truth and
[56:08] he's a quoting here over at around said
[56:09] I'm not trying to priests doctor and he
[56:14] said I'm trying to straighten it out
[56:16] listen there was no man coach when when
[56:20] when man become into that body what body
[56:23] theophany spiritual body the one 26 and
[56:30] 27
[56:32] he had control of the fishes and the
[56:35] fowls and beasts of the field and the
[56:37] ner was no man to till the soul
[56:39] Genesis 2 he done made male and female
[56:43] there's no man that tilde someone then
[56:45] God made man out of the dust of there he
[56:48] gave him a hand like this and the dust
[56:50] of the earth rolled it up makes him look
[56:54] like this the entity made up cows in
[56:56] petroleum but the difference between an
[56:58] animal and a man God put a soul in a man
[57:04] and he didn't put it in the animal
[57:06] because the soul that was in the man is
[57:09] that theophany now much plainer could we
[57:14] get your soul is your theophany yeah but
[57:19] I've always believed I had one up
[57:21] younger we'll get to it in a minute I
[57:24] got over here on doubt getting today but
[57:26] the Bible said if this earthly
[57:28] tabernacle work that's two questions
[57:31] there's all we have one waiting it ain't
[57:34] turnin till you die is that sensible
[57:38] you're regardless of how you want to
[57:39] make this or make that it ain't there
[57:41] till you die no it's up younger go ahead
[57:52] number 23 Nagaland questions and answers
[57:59] on Hebrews what do we do well my dear
[58:01] st. brother my dear sainted sister
[58:03] before the foundation of the world now
[58:05] read this and listen and you'll see the
[58:09] 126 man was one
[58:13] person 1 so one theophany what the hell
[58:20] is that I thought we all I thought
[58:24] everybody in here that had eternal life
[58:26] had the life of Christ is that true so
[58:32] then there's only one eternal theophany
[58:37] before the foundation of the world when
[58:39] God created you in His image are created
[58:43] the man in His image and create the
[58:46] woman in the image of the man for the
[58:48] glory of the man he made you at the
[58:50] orphan II just like himself
[58:54] when he said led us to the creatures
[58:58] that he had made
[58:59] let us make man in our own image in her
[59:02] own likeness
[59:03] what's the Alpha nee God had never
[59:05] become flesh yet he was in a theophany
[59:08] and Moses saw him Moses cried the Lord
[59:11] let me see or D see him in a theophany
[59:18] yes all right get it into a little body
[59:20] of flesh breathe into it stepped into it
[59:23] come down that's when he was a pure and
[59:25] Abraham when his appearing to Moses God
[59:28] just spoke a body in this and stepped
[59:30] into it and come on here all right
[59:32] what's the next one adoption what is
[59:35] that one of 24 from adoption he does not
[59:42] yet appear what kind of body will help
[59:44] but we know that we'll have a body like
[59:46] is that scripture always bothered me
[59:51] until this series
[1:00:01] the scripture says we're gonna have a
[1:00:03] body like his but we all gonna look like
[1:00:07] him ain't talking about a flesh come on
[1:00:16] well we know we'll have a body like he
[1:00:18] had what did he ever have that theophany
[1:00:21] yes sir when he died the Bible said he
[1:00:24] is a personal pronoun he went to hell
[1:00:26] and preached to the souls in prison
[1:00:28] hallelujah how did he do it he had
[1:00:30] sensitive feeling there was one thing
[1:00:32] brought around let her straighten out
[1:00:33] with me on that could I even had him I
[1:00:36] had it in the beginning that's your soul
[1:00:38] your theophany had no feeling to it
[1:00:43] brother Brown says a higher feeling a
[1:00:46] greater feeling those beyond the curtain
[1:00:51] of time was in their soul right and he
[1:00:54] could hug them right and feel them ride
[1:00:58] in them endure theophany not in their
[1:01:01] physical body now it wasn't his physical
[1:01:04] body his physical body he said we lay it
[1:01:06] on the bed
[1:01:06] come on Alleluia how to do it he had
[1:01:09] sensitive feeling and since they're here
[1:01:10] yet sensitive preach he preached with
[1:01:13] that same kind of a body
[1:01:15] I saw those glorified ones in the other
[1:01:20] night what was Jesus when he went to
[1:01:24] hell to preach to the same body or kind
[1:01:28] of body and I saw those glorified ones
[1:01:32] he preached the soldier when hail they
[1:01:34] repented not in the long-suffering the
[1:01:35] days of Noah with any rose on Easter and
[1:01:38] all those things and not leave this old
[1:01:40] in hell
[1:01:41] I love that scripture neither would I
[1:01:44] sell from my Holy One see corruption 72
[1:01:46] hours now just as a repeat did you catch
[1:01:49] it
[1:01:50] that's the irony that body that when to
[1:01:52] preach to the souls that were in prison
[1:01:54] they repented not in the long-suffering
[1:01:56] what is your soul yet the off in it what
[1:02:00] about it
[1:02:02] number 25 questions unanswered on
[1:02:07] Hebrews now there you are that's the way
[1:02:09] we are we come from a higher being in
[1:02:14] the beginning we were in the image of
[1:02:17] God the veil in the darkness keeps us
[1:02:21] from knowing it now
[1:02:22] but Jesus told his disciples he was with
[1:02:25] them before the foundation of the world
[1:02:27] see we were you can't know it now which
[1:02:31] you was in the beginning and if this
[1:02:33] earthly time we're not going to be
[1:02:34] dissolved we have one already waiting
[1:02:37] inverted L it's already waiting is it
[1:02:40] dark before we die you've got to get to
[1:02:45] Pais in the way of the body is it her
[1:02:48] some time now we have one already
[1:02:50] waiting and Olivia then we move into
[1:02:52] this theophany well we want to live so
[1:02:55] we can eat and shake hands sold under
[1:02:57] the altar
[1:02:59] how long si and run around priests that
[1:03:05] feel seal and use the scriptures of how
[1:03:08] long how long to avenge our blood our
[1:03:11] minds automatically lock that you can't
[1:03:12] use how long how long because we're not
[1:03:16] sinners we don't say that sold under the
[1:03:22] altar how long 57 no let's go
[1:03:37] this Robo flashing around there's a
[1:03:39] natural body theophany who wants you a
[1:03:41] natural body theophany what it's a
[1:03:44] natural body a body not made with hands
[1:03:48] neither born of a woman that we go to
[1:03:52] it's not a physical corporal body since
[1:03:56] the Alpha knee it's a body then that
[1:04:00] body returns back to picks up the
[1:04:02] glorified body so then it's not a
[1:04:04] glorified body that's the reason Jesus
[1:04:06] went to hell when he died he preached to
[1:04:08] the souls that were in prison turned
[1:04:09] back at the afternoon
[1:04:11] do you catch it repeat and now we're
[1:04:15] gonna go here if this earthly Tabernacle
[1:04:17] be dissolved this early Tabernacle we
[1:04:19] have another one we have bypass that
[1:04:26] what we bypass will get it's in the hood
[1:04:30] that smells edit it I ask you to read it
[1:04:32] and go over over around talking about
[1:04:34] how we bypass and see what we bypass we
[1:04:38] Popeyes coming to where he did he come
[1:04:40] fool that fool
[1:04:42] we didn't come that way we come in him
[1:04:46] oh and then when we come to earth he had
[1:04:49] to divide itself that we could all be
[1:04:52] the parts of him we have bypassed that
[1:04:58] to come straight from God the attribute
[1:05:00] the flesh to be tempted and tested by
[1:05:02] saying like Adam did well when the
[1:05:04] testing and this word is over then we're
[1:05:06] taking up to this body and was from a
[1:05:08] prior for us before the foundation of
[1:05:09] the world that's the reason Jesus no to
[1:05:13] all things called he was word before he
[1:05:19] was flesh then we become door I brought
[1:05:24] around innocent who was just okay he
[1:05:25] said we become the word here you become
[1:05:29] the word as you receive the winner
[1:05:30] okay are we at it
[1:05:36] go to the next 127 trying to do God a
[1:05:41] service without it being his will he's
[1:05:44] up he's talking about he's coming what
[1:05:46] look a pice the curtain of time now
[1:05:50] where's that brother branham went beyond
[1:05:53] the curtain of time right now watch what
[1:05:56] he says there it was just the same as
[1:06:01] I'm preaching to you all there they
[1:06:04] stood sold under the altar crying how
[1:06:08] long he didn't mind using it not just to
[1:06:14] miss somebody who had intelligence how
[1:06:18] long Lord see why we feel that now and
[1:06:22] our age like brother brand like brother
[1:06:24] Dawson sitting here so under the altar
[1:06:30] he saw souls under the altar he saw the
[1:06:36] theophanies are those that had pie stone
[1:06:41] that's your soul can't go to the next
[1:06:44] one
[1:06:45] gods only provided place of worship in
[1:06:49] heaven of this place whatever woods I
[1:06:51] don't know what to call it referred to
[1:06:54] it dire as sold on the altar and who
[1:06:57] referred to it dire somebody did well
[1:07:01] now let's read the next one to see who
[1:07:02] said it referred to our souls under the
[1:07:07] altar go to the next from 29c and he
[1:07:11] comes down explaining to the girl that
[1:07:13] he was our oldest religion and the thing
[1:07:15] that stopped and off and what if I've
[1:07:19] passed over I want to see Jesus now
[1:07:22] remember that you remember when he went
[1:07:24] beyond the curtain of time you want to
[1:07:25] see Jesus he said you can't see him now
[1:07:29] this is the spirit sure said
[1:07:33] souls under the altar he's just a little
[1:07:38] higher someday he will return we'll go
[1:07:41] back to earth
[1:07:41] we don't eat or drink here
[1:07:47] but remember the man that talked to
[1:07:50] Abraham and the one Moses all could eat
[1:07:56] he fed him a kind that's the often he
[1:08:00] was inside the man
[1:08:01] so theophanies don't need to eat it's
[1:08:04] the afternoon with the inside of the man
[1:08:07] that met Moses said that met Mel chatted
[1:08:10] I mean was Mel charity than met Abraham
[1:08:12] maybe not using Moses called it's not
[1:08:15] figuratively speaking the Verteron said
[1:08:17] it was the back part of Jesus
[1:08:18] what is it folks
[1:08:28] God is not complete without you why
[1:08:33] because you're part of God right that's
[1:08:39] true you're part of God God is not
[1:08:42] complete we had to be before the
[1:08:48] foundation of the world but brother Dale
[1:08:57] I've always heard it not the often he
[1:09:01] was up in heaven where did you read it
[1:09:04] from the Prophet any expressing thinking
[1:09:07] that away what I've read to you is
[1:09:11] expressing its end down here which is
[1:09:13] your soul and like I said Sunday then
[1:09:16] what when you are born again
[1:09:19] brother Branham said your soul is not
[1:09:24] complete it only has the baptism now
[1:09:29] that's his words you need that quote
[1:09:30] when you're born again at faith your
[1:09:34] soul is not complete so then when you're
[1:09:37] born again at faith what's pulling you
[1:09:41] the headstone which is long within why
[1:09:45] can't we believe that your soul is your
[1:09:48] theophany in the new birth but
[1:09:52] something's pulling us which is the
[1:09:55] positive of God's mind so then we do
[1:09:59] have one in heaven you want to call it
[1:10:02] that let's read the scripture let's read
[1:10:05] this and we'll get this and catch a
[1:10:07] little bit go ahead we're number 32
[1:10:11] second Corinthians 5:1 now watch this
[1:10:19] time for we know that if our earthly
[1:10:25] House of this Tabernacle were dissolved
[1:10:30] now the point is if it were dissolved
[1:10:33] you can talk about something else right
[1:10:36] I mean I'm not an English major or you
[1:10:40] know I'm a stupid idiot but at least I
[1:10:42] can read well we know that if our
[1:10:47] earthly habitat now houses this tavern a
[1:10:50] word is out in other words if we die we
[1:10:55] have a building of God what happens you
[1:11:01] die body goes to great spirit goes to
[1:11:04] Garnica gave it so where does it go we
[1:11:12] have a building of God when house not
[1:11:14] made with hands look at him eternal in
[1:11:16] the heavens
[1:11:18] is there to eternalize do you have
[1:11:20] eternal out here and eternal life doc
[1:11:23] where is one of them partial realization
[1:11:26] the other one perfect realization
[1:11:29] what's calling you all right I don't
[1:11:32] have no problems with this song but the
[1:11:34] idea is calling me if they just knew
[1:11:37] what they were singing
[1:11:41] God is calling us to bring us up
[1:11:59] it's not something up there we're here
[1:12:06] we god has to come here to get us we
[1:12:14] don't go that we're not up dire and down
[1:12:18] here when it says you resurrect sitting
[1:12:25] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus does
[1:12:26] that mean you're up in heaven no that
[1:12:30] means you've reached the spiritual
[1:12:31] condition spiritual condition into your
[1:12:33] soul which is right now I haven't
[1:12:41] decided how to proceed on to the next
[1:12:43] part but I will say this much there's
[1:12:51] only one eternal God there's only one
[1:12:55] eternal theophany there's only one
[1:12:58] eternal soul Adam and Eve were the same
[1:13:04] in theophany you realized in if you have
[1:13:08] eternal life today you was back there
[1:13:11] not just back for the world he was back
[1:13:14] there in the garden when Adam and Eve
[1:13:16] Walter what out well you really have got
[1:13:24] me now I'm halfway understanding before
[1:13:28] the world now he throws me in the garden
[1:13:30] well we're yet if there's only one
[1:13:33] eternal life if there's only one solid
[1:13:38] it's eternal is it only one theophany
[1:13:40] this eternal
[1:13:43] that's the secret folks that Adam and
[1:13:51] Eve were the same in creation and run
[1:13:55] said she was in him in theophany an
[1:13:57] original creation
[1:13:59] you were there how did you get that you
[1:14:13] was before the foundation of the world
[1:14:14] in God as a part of God with right
[1:14:18] what was that he put in Adam and Eve
[1:14:19] will get the blasphemous names you go
[1:14:23] ahead and read it if you want to it's in
[1:14:24] blasphemous night where brethren said
[1:14:26] God breathed into the nostrils of Adam
[1:14:29] and he became a living soul eternal but
[1:14:40] he fell did he fall from eternal life in
[1:14:43] his soul or did he fall to human death
[1:14:46] in the flesh you answer it if you see
[1:14:53] Church you don't want to see the truth
[1:14:56] and listen to it listen for a minute
[1:15:00] I've got the notes written for it but
[1:15:02] I'll just tap it and forget it and go
[1:15:05] back and we'll try to come down to earth
[1:15:06] and start like we read a lot of Genesis
[1:15:11] 1:26 and 27 but do we ever read 28 if
[1:15:21] you think I'm wrong that there's only
[1:15:23] one theophany then we come from Jesus
[1:15:27] Christ by what the four knee hitting
[1:15:31] each other night he didn't know I had
[1:15:32] been the host we you know that we come
[1:15:37] by spiritual multiplication do you know
[1:15:41] that the seed has to come through the
[1:15:43] body right I don't mean it's got to come
[1:15:46] through the preacher now we didn't say
[1:15:47] that come through the body women can go
[1:15:49] out and preach the gospel to other women
[1:15:52] right
[1:15:54] come on get it right you got your own
[1:15:57] family to raise you got your own doing
[1:15:59] your women have a right but just don't
[1:16:01] get in the pulpit leave it alone why
[1:16:05] would you own it heaven help you want
[1:16:06] what you want I'd like for you to be
[1:16:11] lonely nice night and walk the house for
[1:16:18] hours if it's three o'clock daddy you
[1:16:25] don't want to preach cuz remember one
[1:16:28] thing for sure your soul is responsible
[1:16:31] for what you say and if you say it wrong
[1:16:33] it's death
[1:16:39] listen Church Adam and Eve were one in
[1:16:45] theophany you and Jesus Christ is one by
[1:16:49] the new birth is that true by receiving
[1:16:53] the new birth makes you one with Christ
[1:16:55] and part of God right come on that's out
[1:17:00] in the Baptist Church at least you could
[1:17:02] Amen the bad news you heard it in the
[1:17:05] Presbyterian that we were the children
[1:17:07] of God what's wrong with it now I don't
[1:17:12] know what he's gonna say I don't know
[1:17:18] whether I agree with it or not bring up
[1:17:22] Genesis 1:26 and through 28 and let's
[1:17:25] read it wait brother God said let us
[1:17:30] make man in our own image after our
[1:17:33] likeness and let them have dominion over
[1:17:35] the fish of the sea over the fowl of the
[1:17:37] air and over the cattle now I can show
[1:17:40] you where brother Branham puts that
[1:17:41] physically even that's what I said I got
[1:17:44] a bunch of it rope he puts it physically
[1:17:46] we're supposed to rule over everything
[1:17:49] that's why the animals are scared of you
[1:17:53] over the fowl of the air and over the
[1:17:55] cattle and over all the earth you know
[1:17:57] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[1:17:58] your spiritual creation right theophany
[1:18:02] right so God created man in his own
[1:18:05] image in the image of God created he
[1:18:08] male and female created he them that's
[1:18:11] the one man right that's the eternal
[1:18:13] life that's Jesus Christ right now look
[1:18:18] what he says then God blessed them and
[1:18:24] said unto them be fruitful and multiply
[1:18:32] and replenish the earth well I don't
[1:18:40] know whatever I don't start right now
[1:18:42] because your mind is clicked replenish
[1:18:45] well it could have been something before
[1:18:47] this we don't know what maybe there was
[1:18:48] something like that before
[1:18:49] this one comes I don't know I got this
[1:18:51] quote what does the word replenish me
[1:18:57] Webster's definition says replenish
[1:19:00] means to do again or something over
[1:19:02] again that is not the word replenish the
[1:19:07] word replenish in the Hebrew lexicon is
[1:19:10] number 4390 it says to feel be full okay
[1:19:22] that got it this is the word replenish
[1:19:28] to feel be full to be full fullness
[1:19:32] abundance particle particular array is
[1:19:35] pronounced it to be fooled to be
[1:19:37] accomplished be ended to concentrate
[1:19:40] feel the hand to be filled beyond be
[1:19:44] satisfied
[1:19:44] she'll be any world without something to
[1:19:46] be done again well it says replenish now
[1:19:52] I'll tell you this and this is what I'm
[1:19:54] saying to you Adam and Eve was told two
[1:20:00] things one to replenish the earth with
[1:20:10] their spiritual offspring
[1:20:15] to to fill the earth as it finishes with
[1:20:20] Noah and Noah's told not to bring the
[1:20:23] spiritual Noah's told to bring the fear
[1:20:26] spurt of physical and to replenish the
[1:20:29] earth Adam and Eve were to do two things
[1:20:35] had sinned not entered the picture they
[1:20:38] would have brought forth the spiritual
[1:20:40] creation then they would have brought
[1:20:45] the natural because it would have come
[1:20:48] into natural bodies every what you want
[1:20:51] to say this happened to that happen
[1:20:52] whatever you say Adam and Eve was to
[1:20:56] bring forth because they were the only
[1:20:58] ones to bring because God never created
[1:21:01] it never stopped them and started
[1:21:03] another creation Adam and Eve was the
[1:21:11] male and female it would have brought
[1:21:16] the seed of God into the earth you tell
[1:21:24] me if that's not right ain't talking
[1:21:28] about natural seed we'll get that in a
[1:21:30] second we know they physically brought
[1:21:33] natural creation than the earth design
[1:21:35] causes the CNN tonight I thought you
[1:21:41] agreed while ago that we we believed in
[1:21:43] spiritual multiplication you believe in
[1:21:48] spiritual multiplication what a
[1:21:50] spiritual multiplication it's what it's
[1:21:53] being done by the Word of God the Word
[1:21:57] of God showed into the hearts of mankind
[1:21:59] was what Jesus done started spiritual
[1:22:02] multiplication in other words his
[1:22:05] offspring Adam and Eve were to bring us
[1:22:11] forth as spiritual multiplication you
[1:22:15] say oh no well I've got it laying there
[1:22:17] if you want to read it but around said
[1:22:18] Eve was the broke Christ
[1:22:23] forget it I ain't gonna argue with you
[1:22:25] I'll quote it to you Eve would have
[1:22:29] brought Christ but he said Satan got
[1:22:31] there too quick and brought the devil in
[1:22:34] his world and he said now you see how
[1:22:38] the world has been repopulated through
[1:22:41] the serpent seed see we quote 1 26 and
[1:22:49] 27
[1:22:50] but we'd never gone to a 28 on his head
[1:23:00] that was what I was fixing to preach on
[1:23:02] but not that word it wasn't there so
[1:23:05] when I said on spiritual multiplication
[1:23:10] preaching the gospel is spiritual
[1:23:12] multiplication you sisters taking the
[1:23:15] gospel to the people around you
[1:23:18] testifying witnessing spiritual
[1:23:20] multiplication how does it come the seed
[1:23:22] has to come through the body
[1:23:26] not physically personally through the
[1:23:31] body of Christ a born-again believer to
[1:23:37] preach the gospel Eve would have finally
[1:23:41] done it and she not sinned what your
[1:23:45] prophet said we know it was not going to
[1:23:48] happen okay because everything was in
[1:23:52] the garden to know that it wasn't gonna
[1:23:53] happen because the man in the woman was
[1:23:56] made that away and if everything was
[1:23:58] fixed for them praying it that away it
[1:24:02] was not going to be that does not do
[1:24:07] away
[1:24:09] see when Jesus Christ come on this earth
[1:24:12] spiritual multiplication he was so in
[1:24:15] that word on the day of Pentecost they
[1:24:18] picked up that word come on brothers
[1:24:19] they picked up that word and it started
[1:24:23] into the Bride of Christ and it's right
[1:24:25] now it's spiritual multiplication that's
[1:24:29] why it's so dangerous to be a preacher
[1:24:33] why anybody would want to be a preacher
[1:24:36] I ain't never figured out because you
[1:24:39] realize it's so close it's so close to
[1:24:46] sowing the seed until you see the
[1:24:48] biggest force of the ministry older
[1:24:50] ministers this message when after
[1:24:52] adultery why I told you about it well
[1:24:57] they're getting ready the man some of
[1:25:00] you would know his name and he come to
[1:25:02] my house he used to preach he used to
[1:25:08] preach his spiritual seed he used to
[1:25:10] preach his seed and this seed and he had
[1:25:12] children born from the bride and the
[1:25:14] Millennium that's his brother were you
[1:25:20] messed up he had a dream they'd had a
[1:25:25] seed to plant he talked to a young girl
[1:25:29] into accepting that seed and produced a
[1:25:31] child I said where you messed up brother
[1:25:33] a preacher is supposed to preach the
[1:25:37] gospel he's sewing seed God was telling
[1:25:40] you to go preach not telling you to get
[1:25:42] a young girl pregnant it's so close it's
[1:25:48] very dangerous why do women flock to
[1:25:54] ministers because they can preach and
[1:25:59] get that he said you sure are on him
[1:26:07] there's one thing about it I tell it
[1:26:09] like it is
[1:26:09] it's the truth what about spiritual
[1:26:13] multiplication Adam and Eve was told
[1:26:16] while they were in theophany while they
[1:26:19] were in that spiritual creation they
[1:26:21] were told to multiply
[1:26:22] and replenish the earth what with the
[1:26:25] offspring of God right what were they to
[1:26:30] do in the spiritual creation to bring
[1:26:34] spiritual man but they fail to do it
[1:26:40] they would have spoke the word and it
[1:26:43] would have multiplied that's exactly
[1:26:45] what's happening now as the word is
[1:26:48] going forth is giving new birth to some
[1:26:51] but to some it's sealing them out
[1:26:53] because they don't know what you're
[1:26:55] talking about
[1:26:56] we're still in the spiritual
[1:26:58] multiplication every time you see a
[1:27:00] child born again that spiritual
[1:27:02] multiplication that's what Adam and Eve
[1:27:08] should have done but CN entered the
[1:27:11] picture and then they replenish the
[1:27:16] earth by sex the seed of the serpent
[1:27:23] what about it
[1:27:26] Lord willing we'll try to start to pick
[1:27:29] back up I got one more message in this
[1:27:31] before we get out of heaven I hope but
[1:27:38] listen do you see what it is to carry
[1:27:43] the gospel you see what it is for you to
[1:27:45] talk to somebody about the Word of God
[1:27:48] you see what it is to preach there are
[1:27:51] two just talk to people about the Word
[1:27:54] of God
[1:27:58] spiritual multiplication Satan never
[1:28:04] Poulin told on God he just helped him do
