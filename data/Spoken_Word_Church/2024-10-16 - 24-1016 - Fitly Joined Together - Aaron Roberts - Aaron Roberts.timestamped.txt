[9:50] Ephesians chapter 4:1 says and he gave
[9:54] some Apostles and some prophets and some
[9:56] evangelists and some pastors and
[9:58] teachers for the in of the Saints for
[10:00] the work of the ministry for the
[10:02] edifying of the body of Christ till we
[10:03] all come in the unity of faith and of
[10:06] the knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[10:08] perfect
[10:11] man unto the measure of the stature of
[10:14] the fullness of Christ that we
[10:15] henceforth be no more children tossed to
[10:18] and fro and carried about with every
[10:20] wind of Doctrine by the slight of men
[10:22] and kindy
[10:23] craftiness whereby they lie and wait to
[10:25] deceive but speaking the truth and love
[10:27] may grow up and to him in all things
[10:30] which is the head even Christ from whom
[10:33] the whole body fitly joined together and
[10:36] compacted by that which every joint
[10:38] supplieth according to the effectual
[10:41] working in the measure of every part
[10:44] maketh increase of the body unto the
[10:47] edifying of itself in love amen God
[10:50] bless you may be seated tonight and uh I
[10:52] just
[10:53] want take a little thought tonight fitly
[10:56] joined together and uh this the
[10:59] scripture here says from the from whom
[11:02] the whole body fitly joined together and
[11:04] compacted and you know the if you look
[11:07] this up it's it's the fitly joined
[11:09] together means uh the proper complete
[11:11] way that something is is to be joined
[11:15] together and so we know how the how the
[11:18] body is is put in position
[11:22] and this is uh I just want to read this
[11:24] quote this is from uh what does it take
[11:27] to make a Christian Life brother brandom
[11:29] speaking here he says but in the word I
[11:32] find that God did not intend for the
[11:34] church to be governed by intellectual or
[11:37] by any Theology of man but the Holy
[11:40] Spirit was given to the church to govern
[11:41] and control the body of Christ and I
[11:44] think in doing that with that in mind
[11:46] and in God's program we will never be
[11:48] successfully no matter how good our
[11:50] intentions are until we get back into
[11:52] the center of God's program where the
[11:55] Holy Spirit and he says now realizing
[11:58] this is not a new thing to teach but he
[12:00] said we just want to approach this and
[12:03] he says but we still thinking that it is
[12:06] Holy Spirit controlled church and he was
[12:10] talking about how they had you know the
[12:12] intellectuals and different things come
[12:13] in but he said and when the Holy Spirit
[12:16] desires to do a thing and degrade
[12:18] something or lifts something up he said
[12:21] it causes petty jealousy among the
[12:23] people which proves they haven't got the
[12:25] Holy Spirit he said every man would want
[12:28] to be in his place place and that's when
[12:30] he was talking about that was the reason
[12:32] why they had denominations and things
[12:34] come in because people had got away from
[12:37] the word and not not being led by the
[12:39] Holy Spirit and so they became we
[12:41] started to see these denominations and
[12:44] then he was talking about he said then
[12:46] from there because of the denominations
[12:49] he said we had spiritual dictators
[12:52] telling people what to do he said
[12:53] spiritual dictators in the church to say
[12:55] thus and thus but he said the Holy
[12:57] Spirit has placed everyone into the body
[13:00] of Christ and he said we're we're
[13:02] helpless to maneuver without every
[13:04] member of our body we have to have my
[13:08] hands my arms my mouth my eyes
[13:11] everything that's in me has to operate
[13:13] to make my body function perfectly and
[13:16] then if God wanted his body the church
[13:18] to be governed by his Spirit there has
[13:21] to there has got to be some way or so
[13:24] programmed that we've got to enter into
[13:27] other than what we have already
[13:30] had and so I want to look at this
[13:33] tonight because you know understanding
[13:37] that you know it takes the whole body to
[13:39] work together and how everything has to
[13:41] function and you know everybody that's
[13:44] in the in the body of Christ you have a
[13:46] position you have a part and you know
[13:50] because there's there's no big eyes or
[13:52] little 's there's there's none of that
[13:54] but everybody's important in in the eyes
[13:57] of God and in the plan of God and in the
[13:59] body of Christ there you know because we
[14:01] all are one and you know you you
[14:05] see you know just simple small things
[14:07] that happen and but when you when these
[14:10] little things come up it it affects
[14:13] everybody yeah and you know nobody
[14:16] nobody's on an island and you know as as
[14:18] old saying is you know nobody jumps over
[14:20] the moon pulls themselves up by their
[14:22] boot straps you know I mean because you
[14:25] know we've all had to go through things
[14:27] but you know what it takes somebody
[14:29] leading us brother Brown was talking
[14:30] about there in leadership when he was
[14:32] talking about you know when we grow you
[14:34] know we have a mom and a dad that that
[14:36] brings us up that teaches us how to go
[14:38] and you know we we learn all the things
[14:40] that we're supposed to learn somebody
[14:41] has to teach you how to walk and you
[14:43] know brings you all the way through and
[14:45] does all these things for you then you
[14:46] get a teacher and they start to teach
[14:48] you all these things and you you start
[14:50] to grow and you start to learn but it
[14:52] takes somebody to lead you and showed
[14:54] you how to how to go that way and you
[14:56] can't you just don't do it all on your
[14:58] own because you know it'd be you know be
[15:00] amazing that we didn't have to have
[15:01] somebody but we all have to have
[15:03] somebody to lead us and help us along
[15:05] the way and we can't do it all by
[15:07] ourselves and see everybody has to work
[15:10] their part and brother said every piece
[15:13] in the church must work together and you
[15:16] must keep up your part of it so we see
[15:20] what time we're living in he said we may
[15:22] be closer than we think we are so
[15:25] everybody has their part and everybody's
[15:28] important and every body has to do what
[15:30] God has called you to do and so whatever
[15:33] the part is that you got to do you got
[15:35] to realize that you're important in the
[15:37] plan of God right you got to see that
[15:40] you're that you're an essential part of
[15:42] the function of of of the plan of God
[15:44] that the body of Christ has to function
[15:47] and you know many times people like well
[15:49] I you know I I don't feel like that I
[15:51] that I fit in anywhere and you know you
[15:53] know because the devil always try to
[15:55] tell you that you're insignificant and
[15:56] you're and you're not but you know what
[15:58] if you're a son or daughter of God then
[15:59] you've got a place in a position and
[16:02] you've got to see who you are and you've
[16:05] got because the the thing is I if if I
[16:08] if I say one thing tonight you got to
[16:10] realize that who you are because brother
[16:12] R said he said the weakest Christian the
[16:14] the smallest whoever it is you know if
[16:16] if you're in that position he said you
[16:18] can you can make all the devils in Hell
[16:21] shake you can put all of them on the run
[16:24] you can you can shake the foundation of
[16:26] hell just by your prayers just by your
[16:29] believing why because it's not who you
[16:32] are but it's what you have possession of
[16:36] because it's what you what through what
[16:38] you are an heir of then if You' become
[16:40] an heir of that then you know you don't
[16:42] have to worry about what what other
[16:46] things take place you just got to put
[16:47] your trust and confidence in God and
[16:49] realize who you
[16:51] are because because all of the all of
[16:54] the blessings that the Divine blessings
[16:57] that are given to the children you know
[16:59] it it you know there it's not one person
[17:01] over somebody
[17:03] else you know one per well some one
[17:06] person has this and some but you know
[17:07] when you start to look at people's lives
[17:09] you say well I wish I wish I was just
[17:11] like brother Bob you know brother Bob's
[17:12] got it all made and everything's so
[17:13] great and and then you know but
[17:15] sometimes you talk to brother Bob and
[17:17] and you find out you just like well
[17:19] brother Bob I'll be praying for you
[17:21] brother why because you know everybody
[17:23] looking on the outside you think
[17:24] everything's great but all of a sudden
[17:26] when brother Bob tells you it's like you
[17:27] know they share with you it's like well
[17:30] you know what brother Bob's got a lot of
[17:31] burdens too and sometimes it's like you
[17:33] know it's not it's not as rosy as
[17:35] everybody else
[17:39] and correct so sometimes you know we we
[17:41] don't realize it just like the little
[17:44] story about the about the man that had
[17:46] the cross had to carry the cross and you
[17:48] know he's talking to the Lord that he
[17:50] didn't like this
[17:52] cross he's like I don't like this cross
[17:54] it's just too heavy it's just too
[17:55] cumbersome you know I just don't like
[17:57] this and I I and the Lord said well come
[17:59] here I've got this room in here the the
[18:02] room full of crosses come in here and
[18:04] find you a different cross to carry just
[18:07] lay your cross down pick up another
[18:09] cross well he started going through
[18:11] there he picked up this one cross and
[18:12] he's I don't like this one and he went
[18:15] to the next cross and he's like well I
[18:16] don't like this one this one's too long
[18:19] this one's too heavy this got too many
[18:21] splinters you know just whatever
[18:23] whatever there's always some kind of
[18:25] issue with every every cross that he
[18:27] came along and then he was like well you
[18:29] know what he said I like this cross over
[18:31] here when over picked it up like I think
[18:32] I'll take this cross it and the Lord
[18:34] said well that's the cross you brought
[18:39] in and sometimes sometimes when we
[18:41] realize all of the things that people
[18:43] have been through you know sometimes
[18:45] because he said he wouldn't put any more
[18:47] upon you than you can
[18:49] bear and so when you go through those
[18:51] things you realize God has has put you
[18:53] in a place that that you are able to go
[18:57] through the things that God knows that
[18:58] you can overcome that you can that you
[19:01] can handle so that's the things that he
[19:02] gives
[19:04] you and you know so sometimes we we want
[19:07] to complain about things but sometimes
[19:08] we ought to give thanks for the things
[19:10] that we have we don't have the condition
[19:12] that we're in as Paul said in everything
[19:15] give
[19:16] thanks with everything that we have to
[19:18] be content where we are to realize where
[19:21] God has placed
[19:22] us see we see how all these things take
[19:26] place and you know uh um brother Brandon
[19:30] was speaking one time and he he was
[19:32] speaking and he was talking about
[19:34] Benjamin
[19:35] Franklin and you know he was talking
[19:37] about how Benjamin Franklin went out and
[19:40] you know he was flying the Kite you know
[19:42] he was a very scientific type man you
[19:44] know he wanted to he wanted to learn
[19:46] more about things that were going on and
[19:48] you know the as they were trying to
[19:50] learn about electricity and different
[19:52] things you know he went out there and he
[19:53] started flying that kite one day and you
[19:56] know he had he had a idea
[19:59] that you know that lightning was
[20:03] electricity and so you know he got out
[20:05] there and he flew that kite you know
[20:06] when he touched it that day that he went
[20:09] out there and was flying that cut and he
[20:10] touched that thing and he's like you
[20:11] know what he said he felt something he's
[20:14] like I felt it I got it because it was
[20:18] it was a um it answered the question it
[20:21] was a proof to him what he was looking
[20:24] for exactly was what came to him and so
[20:27] it was exactly what he was looking for
[20:29] as he was pursuing this and he he came
[20:31] across this and he and he got to that
[20:33] and then brother R said you know I um he
[20:37] said that Benjamin Franklin was able to
[20:39] tell us about electricity but he said it
[20:41] was Edison and the other ones you know
[20:43] they were actually able to harness that
[20:45] power to make it usable for where it's
[20:47] at today to where we stand today these
[20:50] are the things that we're looking at
[20:52] today and so he and brother random says
[20:54] in the in the fundamental Foundation of
[20:56] Faith you know he was talking about this
[20:58] and he says now if if you see if the
[21:00] natural laws of God which is electricity
[21:03] and things once handled which handed in
[21:06] the right capacity can do those things
[21:09] talking about lights and and different
[21:11] things that we have today he said how
[21:12] much more could the power of the Holy
[21:15] Ghost once passing through the human
[21:17] heart by faith what it could
[21:19] do he said now God has not promised El
[21:22] electricity only just might have set
[21:25] them free but look what the Holy Spirit
[21:27] has promised to the Believers today and
[21:30] then we look back and we see that God
[21:32] put electricity here for a certain thing
[21:35] and science is moving up into the field
[21:36] of science and bringing it out so when
[21:39] he's talking about science starting to
[21:41] bring these things out and he's talking
[21:43] about the Christian experience but
[21:45] brother R says but we as Christians we
[21:47] become too clogged up we just can't
[21:52] understand well we think about he said
[21:54] the doctor said I can't get well as long
[21:56] as you think that then you're not
[21:58] thinking God's thoughts he said you
[22:00] can't do it if you say well I'm going to
[22:02] do die the doctor said I was going to
[22:04] die he said all regards to the doctor
[22:07] that's the best of his
[22:09] knowledge but he said see that's not by
[22:11] the word by the word it says that we're
[22:15] going that we're healed he said because
[22:17] see he said because he promised me that
[22:21] whatever I ask the father and his name
[22:23] would be granted he said I believe
[22:25] that's truth yes so when I see this that
[22:29] I take it by what he said he said now if
[22:31] God could just clear that little Channel
[22:33] out and run that energy out to that
[22:36] place then something's going to
[22:39] happen he said the whole body is set
[22:42] together to operate and his life begins
[22:45] just as sure as it takes every member of
[22:47] my body to operate and give me life so
[22:50] does it take every member of the body of
[22:53] Christ to operate together to get it
[22:56] right he said some he said some said in
[22:58] the church teachers Apostles prophets
[23:01] the gifts of healing Miracles speaking
[23:02] with tongues interpretation and so forth
[23:04] he said all those things in this one
[23:07] great Mystic body of Jesus Christ moving
[23:09] on the earth and someday I believe I
[23:11] believe it's near the end right now so
[23:15] it's going to continue on because the
[23:17] things that were set in order will
[23:18] continue on until the coming of the Lord
[23:22] and so every everything that has said he
[23:24] said and tonight he said just like
[23:26] tonight at this light here speaking of
[23:29] the lights he was pointing out he said
[23:31] this light here and that light he said
[23:33] it has give that little sling across the
[23:36] road Over Yonder run the wire out there
[23:39] that's the
[23:40] material he said well now when the
[23:43] energy goes into that wire it'll produce
[23:46] just exactly like it was in here so when
[23:50] you see that when whatever the
[23:52] conditions were in the one place if you
[23:55] just continue it's the same conditions
[23:58] that have to to be met it'll do the
[23:59] exact same thing and so he speaking here
[24:02] how but he was talking about he said but
[24:04] see he said the plumbing might be all
[24:06] right he said but you see by the
[24:08] water but see it takes he the wiring has
[24:12] to be corrected he said if the body is
[24:15] correctly wired up and the Father in
[24:17] Heaven turns the big master switch on
[24:20] something's going to rise up that's
[24:23] right that if it's the the body is if
[24:25] the building is properly wired and if
[24:28] it's properly taught in every fiber of
[24:31] our body being Lost In Christ and to his
[24:33] word
[24:35] alone see he said but he said but if
[24:37] you've got some theology or some
[24:39] Doctrine or some Superstition he said
[24:42] you get some unbelief he said it's going
[24:43] to stop right there right it'll go to
[24:46] right there he said but you've got it'll
[24:48] stop it he said then that energy will
[24:50] never pull through you but when you got
[24:53] to a place where you're perfectly
[24:56] wired and the master electrician has
[24:59] okayed it by selling it with the Holy
[25:01] Spirit the only thing is just turn on
[25:04] the switch then and there will be a
[25:06] light show and that's
[25:09] right so we see how when when these
[25:12] things have to take place then every
[25:15] everybody has their position and
[25:18] everything works in its right order then
[25:23] then God has called us all to our right
[25:25] place but he says if the body you know
[25:29] you've got to be connected in the right
[25:31] way and uh and knowing where you've got
[25:33] to be and what your position is that you
[25:36] can that you can have the same
[25:39] power it's the same power that'll flow
[25:41] through
[25:42] you and you say why why is it that uh
[25:47] you I was I was looking at one time you
[25:50] know talking about the women that you
[25:52] know cause
[25:54] revivals and you know there there's a
[25:56] little you know that little woman that
[25:57] was at the well and she was talking to
[25:59] Jesus and you know here she was you know
[26:01] she couldn't come when when the rest of
[26:03] them came you know she was a ill ill
[26:06] famed woman nobody want to have anything
[26:08] to do with her but you know what she
[26:10] came and met the master she had a she
[26:13] had an appointed time to meet the master
[26:15] and when she met him and he began to
[26:17] deal with her situation then you know
[26:19] what she turned around and began to
[26:21] testify to the whole town and the whole
[26:23] town began to believe what she said
[26:25] because she come back and said look this
[26:27] is the man is this not the
[26:29] Messiah identifying exactly because it
[26:32] was because of what her experience was
[26:35] what she had been through she turned
[26:36] around and told all the rest of them and
[26:39] how many times have you know you read
[26:40] through history and you see the
[26:42] different ones where they talk about the
[26:43] different the different revivals that
[26:45] took place and what was it it was some
[26:47] little washwoman somewhere that was out
[26:49] praying over the over the community or
[26:52] whatever it was some woman in the church
[26:54] cleaning it and praying over the church
[26:56] and you know what and then it began to
[26:57] break out a re in a Revival and you know
[27:00] it was some kind of simple simple thing
[27:02] that took place but not realizing but
[27:03] you know what it was the desire of a of
[27:05] a sister's heart that that she was
[27:07] Desiring a re a Revival to take place
[27:10] and you know what she began to seek that
[27:12] and you know what because through her
[27:13] prayers and nobody else maybe nobody
[27:15] else knew what she was praying nobody
[27:17] else knew what was going on but you know
[27:18] what God saw the desire of that sister's
[27:21] heart that woman's heart and and and
[27:23] it's like well nobody else knew but you
[27:24] know what she knew and you know she had
[27:26] Faith to believe and she be all of a
[27:28] sudden all of a sudden the whole
[27:30] Community
[27:31] changed all of a sudden the church is on
[27:33] fire why because it just takes one
[27:37] person one to to most it would be well
[27:40] that's some insignificant person but you
[27:42] know what it wasn't insignificant to
[27:45] God and say what was it that that person
[27:48] we like well you know you know they're
[27:50] just
[27:51] just just some sister just some maybe
[27:54] some young person but you know what they
[27:56] were tied into the right path power
[27:59] righten they they had they had anchored
[28:02] into that
[28:03] source and all they had to do was wait
[28:06] for the wait for that switch to be
[28:08] turned and it's the same way we say well
[28:10] we don't you know we wonder why things
[28:12] don't happen the way they do well you
[28:14] know we're waiting on somebody else well
[28:16] no maybe the reason why things don't
[28:18] change in your situation is because
[28:20] you're not the one that's
[28:23] right well maybe maybe maybe the reason
[28:25] why our church doesn't change is because
[28:27] of me
[28:30] right you know because if if we if we
[28:32] look at it as as a whole body then you
[28:35] know I realize you know what the buck
[28:36] stops here
[28:39] right we find we find many people that
[28:41] you know they they're out looking to see
[28:43] what everybody else is doing and looking
[28:45] to see what's going on and I realize you
[28:47] know sometimes you got to take an
[28:48] inventory of your own self to know
[28:50] what's going on and and and be more
[28:52] worried about your own self and what's
[28:53] going on you I was I was listening to a
[28:56] man the other day and he was talking
[28:57] about paying tithes and and you know
[29:00] people wanting to help the poor and and
[29:02] different things like that and he was
[29:03] talking about well you know you can help
[29:04] the poor you can help the widows because
[29:05] that's all scriptural but he said you
[29:07] know what that's not paying
[29:09] tithes and he said and he said because
[29:12] there is a law of God that has to do
[29:14] with paying ties and he said when you
[29:16] don't follow what the scripture says
[29:18] about paying ties you can't expect the
[29:20] blessing that comes with that because
[29:23] there's a divine order that sits in
[29:25] there you have to follow that but you
[29:27] see these people and and brother John
[29:29] this this would be good for you uh you
[29:32] put this in your notes but but what uh
[29:35] he was talking about you know some
[29:36] people you know they'll they'll blow
[29:37] through
[29:39] money you know they're loose with their
[29:41] own money but he said when it comes to
[29:43] the house of God you know they they are
[29:46] some people are so nosy about how how
[29:48] the church spends money you know when
[29:51] you know well we get we're getting we're
[29:53] getting new carpet and and the pastor's
[29:55] driving a new car and and this and that
[29:57] and the other and it's like like listen
[29:59] you know when you when you pay your
[30:03] tithes I'm not I'm not paying tithes to
[30:07] Spoken Word
[30:08] Church I'm not paying ties to brother
[30:12] Dale to brother Wade I'm not paying ties
[30:15] to him I'm paying ties to God that's
[30:19] right when I pay my ties you know what
[30:21] I'm paying my ti into God into the
[30:23] storehouse and then God because what
[30:26] I've done is oper ated the gift the law
[30:30] of God and then you know what it
[30:31] activates the gift in my life to be
[30:35] blessed Then I then I just put that I
[30:37] just put that in the hands of
[30:40] God because why are we so worried about
[30:43] people you know how people in the church
[30:45] spend money or whatever how all this but
[30:48] you know it's like well you know they
[30:49] ain't got two nickel to rub together but
[30:51] they want to know how the church is
[30:52] spending money tell it
[30:55] brother and it's like well you know what
[30:57] if you if you were and and I'm not
[31:00] talking about anybody here but I'm I'm
[31:01] just saying but the way this brother was
[31:03] bringing out it was so good he's like
[31:04] you know he said because if you were
[31:06] more concerned about your own finances
[31:08] about your own personal finances are you
[31:09] about the church spending money said
[31:12] you'd be better off
[31:16] right and so you see how these people
[31:19] they get all wrapped up in things and
[31:20] not realizing that you know if if you
[31:23] God gives you because you see people
[31:26] that they don't make a lot of money they
[31:28] make less money than other people and
[31:29] they got more money than people that's
[31:31] makes a lot of
[31:33] money why because people that have never
[31:35] learned how to save money how to how to
[31:39] be a because what the scripture tells
[31:41] you how to how to be a wise Steward of
[31:44] the
[31:46] money and what God has given you how to
[31:48] be a steward to that
[31:51] money as brother John's been telling us
[31:54] for all these times yes but see people
[31:58] people want want a
[32:00] blessing well you know they want to
[32:02] reach that Financial Jubilee brother
[32:03] John they want to get to that place but
[32:06] you know what they don't follow the law
[32:09] that's set in order to get to that
[32:14] place you know and so if you don't
[32:16] follow that then how are you supposed to
[32:19] be
[32:22] blessed and and so there's there's many
[32:25] things in in just the same way that
[32:27] everything in your life there is a there
[32:29] is a plan there's a purpose in
[32:33] God on how to do things and when people
[32:36] don't follow it they wonder
[32:38] why they don't ever get
[32:40] anywhere right you've got to follow the
[32:43] plan of
[32:46] God if you if you will just do because
[32:48] you know it's like well you know you see
[32:51] people in it and it's
[32:52] like you know you see brother Ryan and
[32:55] you know you know and you you look at
[32:58] brother Ryan and everybody's like well
[32:59] you know I wish I was like brother Ryan
[33:00] you know brother Ryan's got it made he's
[33:02] got you know and it's like well you know
[33:04] no people but when when brother Ryan
[33:06] gets up here and he does Sunday school
[33:08] he's very open about his about his
[33:10] Christian walk his Christian experience
[33:13] but you know there's a lots of times
[33:14] that you know he spends a lot of time
[33:16] praying he spends a lot of time
[33:19] reading you know he spends a lot of time
[33:21] with the
[33:23] Lord and everybody was like well you
[33:25] know if you don't if you don't ever put
[33:26] the time in don't expect to get anything
[33:30] out of
[33:31] it because you've not put the time in if
[33:35] you don't invest nothing don't expect a
[33:39] return you know it's like you know I I
[33:42] tell Adam all the time Adam Adam wants
[33:45] to be Adam wants to be a college
[33:46] football player you know that's his
[33:48] whole you know one of his goals in life
[33:50] you know he just loves football he eats
[33:51] sleeps and breathes football yeah but
[33:54] you know what I tell him it's like
[33:56] listen if if you going to be if you
[33:58] going to be I show them like these
[34:00] little videos of these players that's
[34:02] people you got to compete
[34:05] against 14y old kids and I mean they're
[34:09] muscular a whole lot bigger than him
[34:10] like that's kids you got to compete
[34:13] against I said you you've got but you've
[34:16] got to put in but I tell him listen if
[34:18] you want to be at this
[34:20] level if you want to be at the division
[34:22] one level I said then you got to be
[34:24] division one in everything that you do I
[34:27] said I said if you're going to be
[34:28] division one you need to be a D1 in the
[34:30] classroom you need to be one on the
[34:32] practice field you need to be one in the
[34:33] in the weight room whatever you do if
[34:35] you don't have that mentality that
[34:37] you're going to be the very best that
[34:38] you can be you'll never get anywhere
[34:41] right because you know what somebody
[34:44] somebody that's slower than you but
[34:45] they'll out hustle
[34:49] you right you look at you look at some
[34:51] of the greatest football players that's
[34:52] ever played Walter Payton was one of the
[34:54] best but you know he never was the
[34:56] fastest he never was the biggest but
[34:59] there's one thing about it you wasn't
[35:00] going to stop
[35:03] him I mean here's here's a man what he
[35:06] had a he because the heart that he had
[35:07] the drive that he had was so much bigger
[35:10] than any than anybody on the
[35:12] field and so if you don't have that
[35:14] desire if you don't have that drive if
[35:16] you don't have that Zeal then you know
[35:17] what you're not going to get
[35:21] anywhere because many times the Devil
[35:24] comes along and what does he do he
[35:26] starts to put hindrances in your way
[35:30] right amen you get these little
[35:33] hindrances these little things that come
[35:34] up in your life and you wonder
[35:37] well I I don't know what you know what's
[35:40] going to take place
[35:42] or well I don't know it's like well well
[35:45] tonight I I guess I'm just going to I'm
[35:47] just going to skip praying I'm just not
[35:49] going to read as much I'm just not going
[35:51] to do this
[35:52] no right on and it's like well you know
[35:56] I I just want to cut my prayer time
[35:58] short but you know sometimes sometimes
[36:01] the problem is is we don't press
[36:05] in you know you think about the message
[36:07] recognizing your day and his message
[36:09] when Brother band was there and he said
[36:10] I felt like the Holy Spirit was trying
[36:12] to tell me something want to speak to me
[36:14] and he said everything that he done was
[36:16] a
[36:17] hindrance he said the food that he ate
[36:19] didn't agree with him it was so hot you
[36:21] he was he went down in the basement he's
[36:23] trying to read he was trying to pre he
[36:24] fallen asleep just all these Myriad
[36:27] things just kept coming but you know
[36:29] what he just didn't say well Lord I I
[36:31] I'll just wait till tomorrow some other
[36:35] day but you know he said I kept pressing
[36:37] in I kept pressing in I kept pressing in
[36:39] and he said he kept going on and he said
[36:41] you know early in the morning he said
[36:42] the Lord come and spoke to him and he
[36:44] said he gave me this
[36:46] message and so see many times when
[36:49] people are looking for an answer well
[36:50] they don't they don't you know it's
[36:52] like you
[36:54] know I was talking to somebody one time
[36:56] we talking about the Sweet Hour of
[36:58] Prayer I like you know that's unheard of
[37:02] nowadays it's like sweet minute of
[37:05] prayer sweet minute of
[37:07] prayer yes but you know there there were
[37:10] times when you know people prayed all
[37:12] night
[37:14] long and people people don't know know
[37:16] what what that
[37:17] is but you they wonder why you say why
[37:21] why are we don't live a Victorious Life
[37:23] why don't we have an overcoming life why
[37:24] because you've not put the time in
[37:28] because if you if you've not laid before
[37:29] the and laid in the Altar and laid
[37:31] before God until you got your answer
[37:33] just like Jacob stand there telling
[37:35] telling when the Lord come to him he
[37:36] said listen he said he said I got to go
[37:39] he said nope he said I'm going to hold
[37:41] on to you and he said until you bless
[37:44] me he didn't give up he held on till he
[37:48] got his
[37:49] Blessing and it's the same way with you
[37:51] and I we've got to hold on and continue
[37:53] to press in
[37:57] because you know if you if you do your
[38:00] part and it's a challenge to each one of
[38:03] us because you know each one of us has
[38:05] to do our part
[38:09] right you know years ago I when I was in
[38:12] high school I took a carpentry class and
[38:15] we used to we used to no if you take I
[38:19] get in a lot of the trade classes
[38:20] nowadays if you do everything you know
[38:22] it's you go in and you and you you build
[38:25] a birdhouse and you build these little
[38:26] things we didn't do none of that when we
[38:30] when we done construction We Done
[38:32] Construction I mean we took we took two
[38:35] by 10 and two by 12s and we nailed them
[38:38] all together we'd have we'd have Flor
[38:41] Joyce you know three 2 x 12 nailed
[38:44] together or two three uh three or four
[38:49] you 2 by eights nailed
[38:51] together you know and we'd have to go
[38:53] set them things and we'd go to somebody
[38:55] Building a garage or building an
[38:57] addition or whatever and we don't put
[38:59] them things in
[39:00] place and it was just a bunch of boys
[39:03] putting them things in
[39:05] place well we had a they had a guy and
[39:07] he you know he liked to talk I mean he
[39:10] was
[39:11] strong but you know he was just standing
[39:13] around watching everybody else he liked
[39:14] to talk and not pay attention to what
[39:16] was going on and he just standing there
[39:19] and we got this got this big floor joy
[39:21] he got his armor right around and he
[39:22] ain't paying no more attention than the
[39:24] Man in the Moon and he's standing around
[39:26] talking everybody's trying to move his
[39:27] thing around he
[39:29] just right one day got ready to lift the
[39:31] thing up they picked him up off the
[39:35] ground you know why because he wasn't
[39:37] paying
[39:39] attention all of a sudden he got took up
[39:41] off his feet one because he just had his
[39:42] arm wrapped around it yeah and it's like
[39:45] instead of being there and keeping up
[39:48] with and not seeing what's going on and
[39:50] trying to be an asset and trying to be a
[39:52] help he just added more weight to the
[39:55] job and then when he realized oh you
[39:57] know what I'm standing here getting
[39:59] picked up off the ground and then the
[40:00] carry teacher got on to him because you
[40:02] know he's like well you know what you're
[40:03] one of the strong one of the biggest
[40:04] guys out here so why are we picking you
[40:08] up why aren't you doing your
[40:11] part and sometimes that's what happens
[40:14] us we get led to sleep and not realize
[40:15] you know we're not doing our part we're
[40:17] not trying to be an asset to the kingdom
[40:20] of God we're not doing what we could be
[40:22] doing because you know what we just
[40:24] flowed
[40:26] along and and somebody else is carrying
[40:28] us come on right come on now I'm not and
[40:32] I'm not saying eight times you know it's
[40:34] nice to be carried and sometimes you
[40:35] need a little
[40:37] help but you know sometimes we don't
[40:39] realize you know it's it's us that needs
[40:42] to be doing
[40:44] something not just the same ones over
[40:46] and over and
[40:48] over correct well it's like well you
[40:51] know we'll just we'll just wait on
[40:52] brother Luis brother Luis will get up

[41:01] Louise and you know what and if brother
[41:03] Lise gets up here and sings and wants
[41:04] you to clap your hands or raise your
[41:06] hands or whatever and you know and it's
[41:08] [Music]
[41:10] so I'm I'm just going to preach tonight
[41:13] whether y'all like it or not I'm sorry
[41:15] but you know what what the the problem
[41:16] is is when they say clap your hands and
[41:18] you're like
[41:24] this raise your hands
[41:29] well you know what you don't get you
[41:30] know it's like well how do you what did
[41:32] you put into the service to get anything
[41:33] out of the
[41:39] service yes but you know it's like it's
[41:42] like and and I'm I'm gonna tell you I'm
[41:43] G to tell you my My Philosophy because
[41:45] some of the brothers have asked and I
[41:47] and I was glad to share but you know
[41:48] what I'm not going to get up here and Le
[41:50] when I lead singing I'm not going to ask
[41:52] you to raise your hands I'm not going to
[41:54] ask you to clap your hands I'm not going
[41:55] to ask you to do anything because you
[41:57] know what I expect you to do that on
[41:59] your
[41:59] own I'm sorry that's just me because you
[42:02] know what I'm going to enter in and I'm
[42:03] going to enjoy myself because you know
[42:05] when I get up here cuz everybody says
[42:06] when you lead singing you know they
[42:08] enjoy it well you know what I'm enjoying
[42:09] myself whether y'all enjoy it or
[42:12] not I'm not singing for y'all and y'all
[42:16] shouldn't be singing for
[42:18] me because you know what if the Lord's
[42:20] done something for you then you ought to
[42:22] be able to make a Joyful Noise unto the
[42:24] Lord for what God's done for you
[42:28] because you know what when sometimes
[42:30] when you raise your hands and you clap
[42:31] your hands and you got something to say
[42:33] and testify about something you know
[42:35] what it becomes contagious to somebody
[42:38] else that somebody else will be enjo
[42:41] that will be encouraged by what you've
[42:42] got to
[42:48] sake see we have we but we if we don't
[42:50] enter in then how you know it's it's not
[42:52] it doesn't help because you're like you
[42:54] know brother Wade's like say Amen say
[42:57] amen you know it's like you know you got
[42:59] to pull on everybody no you know what
[43:01] because you operate the gift so if you
[43:04] do the pulling then you know what we
[43:06] don't have to say can you do this can
[43:08] you do that can you say Amen whatever
[43:10] because you know what if it's something
[43:11] on the inside of you that touches you
[43:13] then you will respond to
[43:16] it you will respond to that because if
[43:19] it touches you then you'll have to
[43:20] respond to
[43:23] it
[43:24] see see if we understand the UN that we
[43:27] have the fellowship that we have that it
[43:30] brings all these things together in
[43:31] harmony with Jesus Christ we just and
[43:34] brother I'm talking about how it brings
[43:36] us into
[43:40] Fellowship see we understand who we are
[43:43] we come into
[43:44] Fellowship now brother Brown speaking
[43:46] here in
[43:49] influences he's talking about on the day
[43:51] of
[43:52] Pentecost he said when Jesus told them
[43:54] to wait
[43:55] there wait on the day of Pentecost you
[43:58] know they had to wait the time he said
[44:00] now remember Jesus said wait in
[44:01] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[44:03] from on high they waited not eight days
[44:06] not nine days they waited 10 days until
[44:08] the promise was made manifest and the
[44:10] Holy Spirit fell and divided itself in
[44:12] tongues of fire set upon each of them he
[44:15] said while they were influenced by the
[44:17] Holy Ghost they went into action
[44:21] staggering like drunk men screaming and
[44:23] speaking in tongues out into the street
[44:25] they went they said these men are full
[44:28] of new wine he Peter stood up and said
[44:31] this is that which was spoken of by the
[44:33] prophet Joel and it'll come to pass in
[44:35] the last days what did it do it put him
[44:37] in action brother Bram says it'll put
[44:40] you into action if you haven't got it
[44:43] it'll put you into action when you see
[44:45] the word of God fulfilled he said when
[44:48] you've seen in these last days ought to
[44:50] put us into action it should do it if we
[44:54] if we would just do it with reverence
[44:56] and and
[44:57] humility see if you have received the
[45:00] exact same thing that they did and it
[45:02] and it brought them into a place where
[45:04] they staggered and act like drunk people
[45:06] and everybody thought they were out of
[45:08] you know they were out of their mind and
[45:09] was like wonder what's going on well you
[45:11] know what if you have the same thing and
[45:13] it's does it's done the same thing for
[45:14] you then you know what you ought to be
[45:16] able to raise your hands you ought to be
[45:17] able to praise the Lord and give thanks
[45:19] to God without having somebody tell you
[45:22] to do that because it'll put you into
[45:26] action
[45:27] that's
[45:28] right now you don't have to run the
[45:30] aisles unless you want
[45:32] to on and you know what I I would I
[45:35] would welcome
[45:36] that if you want to run the aisles run
[45:38] the
[45:40] aisles that's right you know everybody
[45:43] says well you know you know don't shout
[45:46] no higher than you than you can
[45:49] live you know well when you when you no
[45:51] matter how high you jump when you come
[45:53] down make sure you can walk a straight
[45:55] line well you know a lot of people get
[45:57] into this place where they live in where
[45:59] they live in in a world of
[46:02] condemnation well you know what I would
[46:04] I would shout because you know somebody
[46:05] will look at me and and and think well I
[46:07] I don't know why he's doing
[46:10] that you need to sit
[46:14] down but you know what we're all Sinners

[46:18] grace and you know what and we're all we
[46:20] all have to be covered by the blood yes

[46:24] to the place where you don't need the
[46:25] blood please come talk to me and test
[46:26] tell tell me about it cuz I want to know
[46:28] about
[46:31] it cuz you know what because there's
[46:33] lots of days I don't even feel like I'm
[46:40] saved Amen brother I work in maintenance
[46:43] no wonder I don't feel like I'm safe
[46:46] sometimes but you know there's lots of
[46:48] days that you come through and it's like
[46:50] you know you you realize I I I don't
[46:52] have you feel like I ain't got no
[46:53] Temperance I ain't got no patience you
[46:55] know it's like well the Lord put all
[46:57] these people in your life to teach you
[46:58] all these things because you don't need
[47:01] these things you know but so you you
[47:03] need them and you don't have them so
[47:05] this way it's going to make it help make
[47:06] it manifest in your life brother but you
[47:09] see all these things how these things
[47:11] take place well then you realize if if
[47:13] you just yield to
[47:15] that then all of then then you will he
[47:18] will lead you in
[47:20] that and you and you just because it'll
[47:23] make it manifest in your life that's
[47:25] right but but body well the well the
[47:27] Devil comes by and you're like
[47:30] well brother Ryan You' done such three
[47:32] years
[47:34] ago well you know what if he wants to
[47:36] talk about what you done three years ago
[47:38] and all the problems that you've had
[47:40] well you know what I ought to stand up
[47:41] and thank the Lord because you know what
[47:42] if he's delivered you from that and then
[47:44] you don't you don't have to worry about
[47:46] that anymore if it's if it's in the sea
[47:47] of God's forgetfulness then you know
[47:49] what you ought to just jump up and say
[47:50] well praise the Lord you know what
[47:51] because I don't have to deal with that
[47:52] anymore because it's it's not it's not
[47:54] accounted to me anymore because I'm free
[47:57] of that
[47:59] amen and it's like well you know you you
[48:02] know you you done this and you done that
[48:03] you said this you know but you know
[48:05] there's a time you got to put all that
[48:07] behind
[48:08] you if you know if you done what you're
[48:11] supposed to do because if you go and and
[48:14] seek forgiveness you know you apologize
[48:16] to somebody go make it right and you and
[48:18] you um speak to the Lord you pray about
[48:21] it you seek forgiveness you know what
[48:23] when it goes under the blood
[48:27] then you know what it's done away with
[48:30] but you know what it but the place that
[48:31] he gets stuck is between our
[48:34] ears it gets stuck between our ears and
[48:36] it never goes any further so when it
[48:38] comes time to worship lots of times we
[48:40] worried about what happened in the
[48:43] past and we don't real you know we're
[48:48] free then if you're free then you ought
[48:53] worship you know just like when Abraham
[48:55] Lincoln signed the emancipation
[48:57] Proclamation and he signed and said
[48:59] listen he said all the slaves in these
[49:01] territories are free yes why because
[49:04] they were conquered because the Union
[49:08] Army which is the American government
[49:10] they conquered the Confederates and when
[49:12] they took over listen everything that's
[49:14] in this in this these territories
[49:16] becomes our
[49:18] property right and guess what when it
[49:20] becomes mine I can do what I want to
[49:22] with it and you can't say nothing about
[49:25] it because you're
[49:28] defeated so what did he do he told him
[49:30] said listen they're
[49:33] free and lots of people like well does
[49:35] that look really legal well he said take
[49:38] it to the court and find out but he said
[49:39] by that time he said all these people
[49:41] will be
[49:43] free because I well you better not do
[49:45] this Lincoln you better not do that but
[49:47] you know what he he said this is what's
[49:49] going to take place and when those
[49:52] people heard the
[49:53] word of President Lincoln when and he
[49:56] told him he said listen You'll Be Free
[49:59] and brother R talking about when they
[50:00] went out there and he said when all they
[50:01] had to do was look for the sun to come
[50:03] up they were out there looking and he
[50:06] said he said the strongest one climbed
[50:07] to the top of the mountain and they were
[50:09] at the top and they were looking for the
[50:12] sun to
[50:13] break when the sun started coming up
[50:16] that morning he said they began to yell
[50:18] back down the mountain we're
[50:20] free we're
[50:22] free all those people that were down in
[50:25] the valley and different parts up
[50:26] through that mountain you know what they
[50:28] couldn't see any of that light but you
[50:30] know what there was somebody that came
[50:32] and started to Proclaim to them listen
[50:33] you're
[50:34] free because we see the sun the sunlight
[50:38] is shining and now it is free now you
[50:41] can go free amen and so it's the same
[50:45] way today see as the word of God has
[50:47] begins to shine and and the light is
[50:49] being made known they see you can be
[50:50] free right because he whom the son has
[50:54] set free is free indeed
[50:57] that's right amen see if we can just
[51:00] believe that see
[51:07] if now brother BR this is from the the
[51:09] message the greatest battle ever fought
[51:11] he said and I thought and he's talking
[51:14] about the sun and the different
[51:15] different constellations and different
[51:17] things and he said I thought that great
[51:19] Heavenly Host like that he it keeps to
[51:22] make everything in
[51:24] order and didn't then
[51:27] he's he's speaking
[51:28] of the things in heaven he said' but
[51:31] what about the disorder of the Earthly
[51:34] host how when one gets out of order how
[51:37] it throws the whole thing out of cater
[51:39] the whole program of God is upset when
[51:41] one member gets out of order he said we
[51:44] should continually strive to keep the
[51:46] order of the
[51:48] spirit everything has to be done in
[51:52] order see if you understand that that
[51:55] all of the things that's taking place
[51:57] then you just follow that because God
[52:00] has made you free then all you got to do
[52:02] is follow because the leading of the
[52:03] Lord is there to lead you to show you
[52:06] all the way
[52:10] through and
[52:14] see if you're led by the Holy Spirit
[52:18] then he was talking about how how every
[52:21] every believer in the body is in harmony
[52:24] because he said the Holy Spirit would
[52:26] just place
[52:27] every member of the
[52:29] body and he said this morning in such
[52:32] Harmony see if everything takes place if
[52:35] you're in harmony with the spirit and
[52:37] the spirit is leading you then you know
[52:38] what there's not going to be anybody out
[52:40] of
[52:41] cater because if you're being led by the
[52:43] spirit then you know what the spirit's
[52:44] not going to be ER in
[52:47] error because if you're being led by the
[52:49] spirit then each one of us being led by
[52:51] the spirit then guess what there's going
[52:52] to be
[52:53] Harmony and he said he said if if we
[52:55] could come to this place and realize we
[52:57] can come to the place of Harmony in the
[53:00] spirit he said what would be such a
[53:02] spontaneous healing of soul and body he
[53:05] said if we would just hold our
[53:08] positions see if if we just follow what
[53:11] God has for us then all these great
[53:12] things can take
[53:15] place because what would take place we
[53:17] would all be in Heavenly places in
[53:21] Christ Jesus that's right amen where
[53:23] Miracles take place and healings and all
[53:25] these different things that brother R
[53:27] was talking about sitting in Heavenly
[53:29] places the the believer's position in
[53:31] Christ if you follow all these things
[53:33] how all these things would take
[53:36] place see if we realize what God is
[53:40] leading us into this if we just follow
[53:45] that now this is I I want to read some
[53:47] of this tonight this is this is from
[53:49] Christ the mystery you know they they
[53:51] can they call this the word of the
[53:53] church but you know brother Brown said
[53:55] love one another another above
[53:57] everything love one another he said no
[54:00] matter what the devil tries to say he
[54:03] said now you're all one great big sweet
[54:05] group now but remember my warning see
[54:07] Satan won't let that stay that way right
[54:11] see as he because when
[54:14] he whatever the Lord is doing he starts
[54:17] to bring things in he said but don't
[54:18] realize he said the Satan's not going to
[54:20] let it stay that way he's coming to
[54:22] attack that thing he's going to try to
[54:24] tear it apart he said he said he bring
[54:26] some in and shoot them and make somebody
[54:28] a Target some critic or
[54:31] unbeliever but he said you stay right
[54:33] loving and sweet and kind he said don't
[54:35] take sides with it he said pray for that
[54:38] man he'll be saved to or that woman
[54:40] whoever it is just pray for them and
[54:41] stick one with another and stay with
[54:45] your pastor because he's the shepherd
[54:46] and you give him respects he'll leads
[54:48] you through because he's ordained of God
[54:50] to do that to do so and so he begins to
[54:53] talk about he said See the s he said the
[54:55] enemy will come and when he does just
[54:57] cling that much closer together and the
[55:00] one that the devil is using for an enemy
[55:03] will either get out or come in and be
[55:05] one of you that's right he said don't
[55:08] Clan among among one or talk or make
[55:11] yourself clannish we are one he said I
[55:14] couldn't say left hand i'm M at you I'm
[55:17] going to take you away because you're
[55:19] not my right hand he's my left hand I
[55:22] want him to stay there even the little
[55:25] tip of my finger I want want to stay
[55:27] right there every little part of my body
[55:30] stay right there and God wants us as a
[55:32] body of Believers to stay right exactly
[55:35] with one another right at with one
[55:39] another he continues on you know we've
[55:42] got takes on what we believe and he said
[55:44] how we ought to come here together how
[55:47] we got to come here together and sit
[55:50] together in Heavenly places don't stay
[55:51] home if God is in your heart you can't
[55:53] hardly wait for them doors to open out y
[55:55] under to get in to fellowship with your
[55:57] brothers he said if you don't don't feel
[55:59] that way then I tell you it's time you
[56:01] get to
[56:02] praying right because he's talking about
[56:05] we're we're living in the last days and
[56:06] so much more as we see the day
[56:09] approaching he said if a brother you
[56:11] think is wrong or a sister say Lord
[56:12] don't let me never have the root of
[56:14] bitterness spring up because he said
[56:16] it'll affect him it'll take the Christ
[56:17] right out of my life that poison stuff
[56:20] AIDS of malice and jealousy and hatred
[56:22] that will just take the Holy Spirit
[56:24] right away from you it'll run him
[56:26] run him from the Tabernacle here it'll
[56:28] kill the spirit of God it'll drive it
[56:30] away from here hurt your pastor it'll do
[56:33] everything see don't do that just wax
[56:36] that much closer together he said talk
[56:39] nice about one another say nice things
[56:41] about one another and then God will
[56:43] bless
[56:44] you and I I tried to abbreviate some of
[56:46] that because I didn't want to read the
[56:47] whole thing but I did want to want to
[56:49] talk about that because you know if
[56:51] God's leading you then don't because you
[56:53] know that you realize Satan's going to
[56:55] attack that
[56:57] and you know every time you try to be
[56:59] drawn together that's Satan's job he's
[57:01] coming in to attack that thing but he
[57:03] said don't take sides with it you draw
[57:05] closer to one
[57:07] another your brothers and sisters you
[57:09] got to draw closer together and don't
[57:11] let any of these things hinder you these
[57:13] things because it can hinder the
[57:16] church and you got to you got to work
[57:18] together to bring all these things
[57:21] together so we we got to be loving and
[57:24] sweet and understand one another and all
[57:26] the conditions that things happen but
[57:28] you realize God wants us to draw closer
[57:30] because you know what you're my brother
[57:31] I can't be without you you're my sister
[57:33] I can't be without you because you're
[57:36] you're an important part of this church
[57:37] you're a part of the body of Christ and
[57:39] then you know you have you have your
[57:41] position I have M but you know I don't
[57:43] want to be without anybody and when when
[57:45] one person is weak then you know we're
[57:47] all weak when one person hurts we all
[57:49] hurt but you know what when one person
[57:52] gets when one person overcomes and it's
[57:54] overcoming for everybody am right see
[57:58] when you realize that what God has
[58:00] called you to and everybody has their
[58:02] position and God wants you to have your
[58:05] position what God has called you to
[58:07] do you know and you know brother Brandon
[58:10] was speaking here talking about each
[58:11] person has has a Ministry you know
[58:14] everybody in the body is like well I
[58:16] don't know what my Ministry is well you
[58:18] know you know maybe maybe maybe you make
[58:21] good food I don't know you
[58:23] know maybe maybe maybe give an
[58:26] encouraging
[58:27] word maybe you pray maybe you're here
[58:30] paying
[58:31] tithes maybe what but you know whatever
[58:33] it is you do your
[58:35] part whatever God has you to do and you
[58:38] know in in the message come follow me
[58:41] brother Brown was talking about um that
[58:45] brother Leo Mercer was talking to him
[58:47] one time and you know he was talking
[58:49] about brother Mam's Ministry and and the
[58:52] changing that was going to take place
[58:54] and he said you know you brother man he
[58:55] said you'll probably just line up
[58:57] hospitals and speak and and empty out
[58:59] all the beds and everything like that
[59:00] and brother R said well it didn't sound
[59:02] right although I believe brother bleo
[59:03] was trying to be sincere about it and he
[59:06] said he said but you know he said the
[59:08] Lord Jesus never done
[59:10] that he said he said there was one there
[59:13] was one in the hospital do you remember
[59:14] when he was down there the Bible the
[59:16] pool of Bethesda great multitudes of
[59:18] infinite people laid there crippled lame
[59:21] blind withered waiting for the angel now
[59:23] that was in a spiritual hospital where
[59:26] people waited on Divine Healing and here
[59:28] the Divine healer himself came in and
[59:30] healed one and walked out so you you
[59:33] couldn't expect a mortal man or a
[59:35] Ministry come forth would be any greater
[59:37] than that was see I couldn't agree with
[59:40] that but brother Ram talks about the
[59:42] spirit gives and he took a piece of
[59:43] paper and he began to write this down he
[59:46] said God will never change the ministry
[59:49] but he will change the man with the
[59:51] ministry that's what's got to be
[59:54] done and you know I I I wanted to bring
[59:57] that out tonight because you know when
[59:58] when people start talking about the the
[1:00:00] ministry and not not just not just the
[1:00:03] five-fold ministry but every part of the
[1:00:04] body you know because whatever God has
[1:00:06] called you to do he's going to equip you
[1:00:10] he's he's going he's going to make you
[1:00:12] able to do the job that you've been
[1:00:13] called to do right you know because when
[1:00:17] when you know people lots of times they
[1:00:19] they well I don't I can't do this and I
[1:00:21] can't do that but you know whatever
[1:00:23] God's called you to do he's the spirit
[1:00:25] of God will equip you to do that righten
[1:00:28] and many times people in their lives you
[1:00:30] see things happen and people have uh
[1:00:33] gifts talents and uh sometimes they
[1:00:36] don't know they don't know that they
[1:00:37] have that ability until they they get
[1:00:40] stuck in a position and and all of a
[1:00:42] sudden they find out they can do those
[1:00:44] things and U so sometimes you know those
[1:00:46] things happen in our lives where we we
[1:00:49] well I I can't do this I couldn't do
[1:00:51] that then all of a sudden when when it
[1:00:53] comes time you know it's like well Lord
[1:00:56] you'll just have to help me do this and
[1:00:57] all of a sudden the Lord comes and helps
[1:00:59] you and you realize that you can do
[1:01:00] certain things you can do more than you
[1:01:02] think you can but you many
[1:01:05] times speaking of the ministry you
[1:01:09] know I I just want to I just want to
[1:01:12] cover this tonight
[1:01:15] because you see people they take this
[1:01:19] scripture and you know brother brandom
[1:01:21] is speaking here of this of the
[1:01:24] ministry and you know then they they say
[1:01:26] well God will change the man with the
[1:01:29] ministry see they're trying to they're
[1:01:31] trying to put this off onto somebody
[1:01:34] else but you know everybody has their
[1:01:36] position in the
[1:01:38] body see because just like you have a
[1:01:41] position brother brandham had a position
[1:01:44] brother brandham was called to a a
[1:01:46] position that that he was a prophet and
[1:01:48] he was he was the seventh angel
[1:01:50] messenger he had a had a position he had
[1:01:52] a job to do what God called him to do
[1:01:55] but you know that didn't make him any
[1:01:57] greater didn't make didn't make him any
[1:01:59] greater than anybody else cuz he was a
[1:02:00] Son of God just like everybody else
[1:02:02] right now he had a hire office but it
[1:02:05] didn't change it didn't change who he
[1:02:08] was because many times people want to
[1:02:10] put him on this
[1:02:12] pedestal but see brother brandham he
[1:02:15] said he said listen he said if you love
[1:02:16] me call me brother he said he said I'm
[1:02:19] just your brother yeah he said he said
[1:02:23] how many times I'm I'm standing here
[1:02:27] I'm I'm just just a human I'm just a man
[1:02:29] but I'm representing
[1:02:32] one see he didn't want people putting
[1:02:34] putting all this on
[1:02:36] him he's wanting you to see Jesus Christ
[1:02:39] amen he couldn't done he couldn't have
[1:02:41] done any of this without Jesus
[1:02:44] Christ and so so when you see this how
[1:02:47] he's putting all this together see he
[1:02:49] said
[1:02:50] but he said but it would it would he
[1:02:52] will change the man with the ministry
[1:02:55] now lot lot of day lots of times today
[1:02:57] you you you find a number of people that
[1:02:59] that I have that I went online and
[1:03:01] people post this and you know they're
[1:03:03] they're trying to make somebody else in
[1:03:06] that position was like well I'm sorry I
[1:03:08] you know I I I appreciate everybody I
[1:03:10] love everybody but let me tell you what
[1:03:12] there's only one seventh angel
[1:03:15] messenger there's only one Malachi
[1:03:18] 4 and you know what because he he he
[1:03:22] brought a a man and he was a prophet and
[1:03:24] he he brought us the word and he broke
[1:03:26] the word to us amen because it was Jesus
[1:03:30] Christ through that man that spoke to us
[1:03:32] and you know what then he equipped a
[1:03:33] five-fold Ministry to continue the work
[1:03:37] that's right there's there there's not
[1:03:40] somebody there's not another one man
[1:03:42] ministry that's going to come and take
[1:03:43] over and and Lead
[1:03:46] everybody the next the next thing we've
[1:03:48] got we've got the Holy Ghost that's
[1:03:50] leading us amen through the word is the
[1:03:53] Holy Ghost and you know many people
[1:03:55] people have tried to tried to make
[1:03:58] different which which I'm sure y'all
[1:04:00] probably catching on to what what I'm
[1:04:03] what I'm driving at but you you you
[1:04:05] can't put somebody else in brother
[1:04:06] bram's
[1:04:09] position nobody has being called but
[1:04:12] brother brandham to that
[1:04:14] position and if brother brandham was
[1:04:17] called to that position and he fuled his
[1:04:19] fulfilled his position he fulfilled the
[1:04:21] word for his
[1:04:23] day then brother brandham continues on
[1:04:26] here he said that's what's got to be
[1:04:29] done he said I know what I've got to do
[1:04:32] now listen this what brother said what I
[1:04:34] got to but I can't I can't do it in the
[1:04:37] condition that I am
[1:04:39] now he said because I've got to
[1:04:42] something has got to happen within me
[1:04:44] that will take God to do it
[1:04:48] right see when the word came and brother
[1:04:50] BR realized he was he was the prophet
[1:04:53] and he understood his calling the
[1:04:55] commission that he was given but you
[1:04:56] know what it he had to go through he had
[1:04:59] to have
[1:05:00] growth there were things that he had to
[1:05:02] go through it changed him but you know
[1:05:04] what it didn't change who he was the
[1:05:06] position that he is but that God work
[1:05:08] done a work in his life to change him
[1:05:11] that he grew up into the position that
[1:05:13] God wanted him to be in so he could
[1:05:14] fulfill the
[1:05:16] word but you know never it never done
[1:05:18] away with who he was that's right and
[1:05:22] it's the same way because if if brother
[1:05:24] brandham came and he had to fulfill his
[1:05:26] place then you know what you and I have
[1:05:28] to fulfill our place amen that if that
[1:05:32] if if brother brandham came and he had
[1:05:33] to fulfill the word for his day with the
[1:05:36] position that he was in and he fulfilled
[1:05:38] that then he brought the word to us then
[1:05:40] you know what the word comes to you and
[1:05:41] I then he does the exact same thing to
[1:05:44] you and I right amen because if if you
[1:05:47] because if God called you to be an end
[1:05:50] time believer to carry this message and
[1:05:52] and and go to a body change then you
[1:05:55] know what then the word will equip you
[1:05:57] to do that and he said he said because I
[1:05:59] can't do it in brother said I can't do
[1:06:01] it in myself he said it's something that
[1:06:03] God will have to
[1:06:04] do well if he's if it's been promised to
[1:06:07] you then realizing I can't do it in
[1:06:09] myself but you know what I realize that
[1:06:12] God will have to do the work but you
[1:06:14] know what he's equipped us with the word
[1:06:16] to do that that if you will yield to the
[1:06:19] spirit then you know what it will take
[1:06:22] place just like brother brand when he
[1:06:24] came to the position he had to come to
[1:06:27] it will come to the same exact
[1:06:33] place see here in modern events made
[1:06:37] clear by
[1:06:39] prophecy see you can't there nobody
[1:06:41] nobody can take anybody else's
[1:06:45] place God called you to a specific place
[1:06:48] and he called you to a specific job then
[1:06:50] you know what You' got to find your
[1:06:51] place yes that's right and you know what
[1:06:55] and and be faithful to what God called
[1:06:57] you to
[1:07:00] do God's not God's not going to ask you
[1:07:03] what you know if you done this or not or
[1:07:05] that he wants to know are you faithful
[1:07:07] to the calling that you've been given
[1:07:09] right
[1:07:11] right are you Faithful in what God calls
[1:07:14] you
[1:07:16] to you know it's just like when when
[1:07:19] David was there on the back side of the
[1:07:20] desert you know he was out watching a
[1:07:22] few sheep but you know what he began to
[1:07:24] have fellowship with God
[1:07:27] he had he had a he had a revelation of
[1:07:29] who God was and he began to deal with
[1:07:32] with go with David and you know they had
[1:07:34] fellowship and all these things that
[1:07:35] took place well then all of a sudden
[1:07:37] when he went through these Hard Times
[1:07:38] these
[1:07:40] battles when the bear came in the lion
[1:07:42] came
[1:07:43] in you know he didn't just drop
[1:07:46] everything and run
[1:07:48] right why because he realized who he
[1:07:52] was and all of a sudden no no doubt the
[1:07:55] bear and the line was much bigger than
[1:07:57] he was but you know what he didn't give
[1:07:59] up right he went through and he and he
[1:08:02] overcame and he
[1:08:03] won and he slew both of them so when he
[1:08:07] come before Saul and he out there and he
[1:08:09] sees Goliath do you know what he wasn't
[1:08:12] afraid right amen why because he had an
[1:08:15] experience with God that he hadd been
[1:08:18] through something then when he went up
[1:08:20] there and told him said listen I'm not
[1:08:21] afraid of that
[1:08:24] philistin he saidwell he comes at me
[1:08:26] with a with a spear and a sword and all
[1:08:28] these things but he said I come in the
[1:08:30] name of the
[1:08:31] Lord he said because he realized you
[1:08:33] know when when he came out against to
[1:08:36] defy the armies of God he defied
[1:08:38] God right and then David realized hey
[1:08:42] you know what this is in the hands of
[1:08:43] God all I got to do is go walk out there
[1:08:46] right right all I have to do is have
[1:08:48] faith in God Amen that he's got that
[1:08:51] he's got the
[1:08:53] battle so when he went out out there he
[1:08:56] wasn't
[1:08:58] afraid he say oh this is this is the
[1:09:00] best y'all got y'all got this little
[1:09:02] Rinky Dink fell y'all sin out here y'all
[1:09:05] ain't got a real real
[1:09:07] Warrior he didn't he didn't realize he'
[1:09:10] met more than his
[1:09:13] match and he told him said listen he
[1:09:15] said this day I'm I'm GNA take your head
[1:09:16] off of
[1:09:20] you he knew exactly what he was what was
[1:09:22] going to take place because you know he
[1:09:25] real realiz that the victory had already
[1:09:27] come before the battle even
[1:09:30] started and so just the same way see we
[1:09:34] understand God has brought us to this
[1:09:36] place and we see that God is bringing us
[1:09:39] through God has already given us the
[1:09:46] victory so this is from Modern events
[1:09:50] made clear by
[1:09:51] prophecy he said notice now
[1:09:55] speaking of Jesus Christ he said no
[1:09:57] notice now he said they had done to him
[1:09:59] just exactly what the prophet said they
[1:10:00] would do just as they were doing they
[1:10:03] are doing to this the very same day in
[1:10:06] the leoan age he said if you want to
[1:10:08] look at it read Revelation Three Blind
[1:10:11] naked and don't know it turning Christ
[1:10:13] he said when he begins to reveal himself
[1:10:16] into the seed form again the same one
[1:10:19] that went into the ground come back to
[1:10:20] be the bride just the bride and the
[1:10:23] groom is the same flesh and blood the
[1:10:26] same Ministry and the same things doing
[1:10:29] just exactly what he done the
[1:10:33] spirit so we you see what took place in
[1:10:36] in the past is exactly what's taking
[1:10:39] place
[1:10:39] today if he overcame and the and the and
[1:10:42] the Word was fulfilled whatever he done
[1:10:46] then you know what it's being done
[1:10:47] exactly the same thing
[1:10:49] today the revelation of the word came in
[1:10:52] in his day and he began to open the
[1:10:53] scripture we had the same thing in our
[1:10:57] day the same one that came and spoke to
[1:11:01] them began to reveal who he
[1:11:04] was who they were what they were
[1:11:07] supposed to do what God had called them
[1:11:10] to do same thing happened today amen
[1:11:13] he's equipping you and showing you who
[1:11:15] you
[1:11:17] are that you can do the greater the
[1:11:20] Greater
[1:11:21] Works and you realize you do your part
[1:11:25] and everybody does their part then it
[1:11:27] all works
[1:11:29] together then he said when the when the
[1:11:31] bride recognizes who she is says she
[1:11:33] going to be Invincible be an invincible
[1:11:35] Army that's right see we all work
[1:11:41] together and everybody has to lean on
[1:11:43] each
[1:11:45] other let's all stand we'll have the
[1:11:47] musicians come if because you realize
[1:11:50] who you are
[1:11:59] Lord let me be faithful to what you've
[1:12:00] called me to be to do my
[1:12:04] part
[1:12:08] yes you know Jesus telling
[1:12:12] the the parable of the talents you
[1:12:17] know you know he gave the different ones
[1:12:19] the
[1:12:20] different servants the different
[1:12:22] stewards the different amounts of
[1:12:24] talents
[1:12:27] you know one had 10 one had five one had
[1:12:29] one but you know the ones that that had
[1:12:33] they put it to
[1:12:34] use and were able to make
[1:12:38] more but you know what the same
[1:12:40] commission was given to all three of
[1:12:43] them and one was like well Lord I just
[1:12:45] went and buried it I just had I just had
[1:12:50] one but you know what you never you
[1:12:53] never know what what he could accomplish
[1:12:57] if he never because he never put that
[1:12:58] one to
[1:13:00] use he's like well I I don't have
[1:13:03] whatever I don't have what the rest of
[1:13:04] them have but you know what they he
[1:13:06] never used
[1:13:09] that and it's like then then he was
[1:13:12] rebuked by the by the master by his Lord
[1:13:15] because he didn't do what he was
[1:13:17] supposed to the other one's done
[1:13:19] it and it's like well you know I I can't
[1:13:22] do because I don't have this and I don't
[1:13:24] have that
[1:13:26] be faithful what God calls you to
[1:13:31] do because that because God whatever he
[1:13:34] gives
[1:13:35] you whatever a little bit it is it's
[1:13:38] important if it's in the kingdom of God
