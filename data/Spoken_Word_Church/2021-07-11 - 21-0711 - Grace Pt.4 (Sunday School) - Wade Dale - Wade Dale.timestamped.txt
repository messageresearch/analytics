[0:00] have brother david said well sister
[0:02] angela's already been here
[0:03] so good to have brother david with us
[0:05] today so
[0:07] um we are talking on grace we've got a
[0:10] kind of using this new format here with
[0:12] the sunday school
[0:13] going on downstairs with the young kids
[0:16] and then the
[0:17] young adults up here right the young
[0:19] adults up here
[0:21] man so let's we've been talking about
[0:22] grace and this will be grace number four
[0:25] let's pull up the uh the definition the
[0:30] hebrew lexicon the definition of grace
[0:32] is favor
[0:33] charm favor grace elegance favor and
[0:36] acceptance and we'll get to that
[0:39] a little bit more when we look at grace
[0:41] in the definition
[0:43] because look this word favor
[0:46] is also a part of favorite
[0:50] all right so now god doesn't show
[0:52] favoritism but he does show
[0:53] favor all right he shows favor
[0:57] to people that especially like the old
[0:59] testament he said if you'll live my law
[1:01] then this is what i'll do for you if you
[1:03] you know blessings i'll bless you
[1:04] cursings i'll curse you and all these
[1:05] different things
[1:07] but we know that and we'll read it in
[1:08] just in a minute that grace
[1:11] only god could develop grace man can't
[1:14] develop grace
[1:16] because we do have our favoritism
[1:21] remember it's all in who you know
[1:23] remember well it is all in who you know
[1:25] if you know jesus christ you get his
[1:26] grace if you don't you get his judgment
[1:29] so let's go to the next one
[1:32] this has come out of the uh out of the
[1:34] dictionary which we know that brother
[1:36] branham
[1:37] told us that grace was unmerited
[1:40] favor but i want you to look at this
[1:41] this is unmerited divine assistance
[1:44] now there's only one divine and that's
[1:46] the lord jesus none of us are divine
[1:49] through him we are divine but this
[1:52] is telling us though that look a virtue
[1:54] coming from god
[1:56] unmerited divine assistance given to
[1:58] humans
[2:00] god doesn't need grace he is grace we
[2:03] need grace
[2:04] for their regeneration our so in other
[2:08] words you need grace
[2:09] by grace are we saved through faith all
[2:12] right
[2:13] but we also need grace for every day
[2:16] and i'm going to read your scripture
[2:18] here in a few minutes in romans the
[2:20] bible tells us
[2:20] listen grace is not for what you're
[2:22] gonna do
[2:25] that's catholicism you go and say four
[2:28] hail marys and you that's why the
[2:30] that's why the mob the mafia love to be
[2:32] catholics because they go in and say
[2:33] look i'm gonna kill four people
[2:34] tomorrow.
[2:36] give me some grace and then you know
[2:37] four hail marys and pay ten thousand
[2:39] dollars and
[2:40] whatever you do tomorrow you're you're
[2:42] uh absolved from it but we know that's
[2:44] not god
[2:45] god gives grace for what is in the past
[2:49] you can't get grace for something listen
[2:51] if you want to try to get grace for
[2:52] something you're going to do tomorrow
[2:53] and you know what's wrong that's
[2:54] iniquity
[2:55] that's not and that takes you completely
[2:57] out from under grace
[2:58] all right if you know you're going to do
[3:00] it tomorrow and you just put it in your
[3:01] mind you're going to do it say well god
[3:02] forgive me i'm going to do it
[3:04] now there's no forgiveness for that
[3:08] there's not until you do it and then
[3:11] you're
[3:11] falling into iniquity and that's the
[3:13] whole that's the old part look at people
[3:15] today how many
[3:16] how many people do you know in this in
[3:18] this world that has any grace
[3:20] only the bride of jesus christ only the
[3:22] people that have the new birth
[3:25] are graceful people or people that have
[3:27] grace
[3:28] in the world there's no grace it's all
[3:31] judgment
[3:33] you do this you don't do that we'll read
[3:34] that in just a minute so but it's a
[3:36] virtue coming from god it's not coming
[3:38] from man so it's a virtue coming from
[3:39] god
[3:40] a state of sanctification enjoyed
[3:41] through divine look at how many times it
[3:43] says divine
[3:45] because it is not humanly possible
[3:48] to give grace because you say i never
[3:50] will hold a grudge well
[3:54] you just think about it yourself you
[3:56] just think about yourself about when you
[3:58] talk about holding a grudge against
[3:59] somebody
[4:00] okay you have your favorites
[4:05] and god does too god has his favorites
[4:07] but it's because of the word of god it's
[4:08] because we're called bride
[4:10] and we get the new birth everything else
[4:13] is not
[4:14] under grace because listen when the two
[4:17] witnesses go to israel
[4:19] there will be no grace given to the
[4:21] world because she's already spurned her
[4:23] day of grace
[4:25] under the gentile prophet brother
[4:27] branham then he
[4:28] cuts off the gentiles there's no more
[4:30] grace for that for for the
[4:32] there's nobody going to get grace
[4:36] except for the jews well when god takes
[4:38] the message so what are you saying by
[4:40] the way the mess
[4:41] every message is tied to grace because
[4:44] you take a prophet when a prophet comes
[4:46] on the land he does two things
[4:48] i know he does three but let's just look
[4:49] at these two he brings what
[4:51] grace to some and judgment to others
[4:54] remember he comes down he speaks his
[4:56] message it's judgment to the ones that
[4:58] don't take it
[4:59] and it's grace to the ones that do so
[5:00] that's exactly what the two witnesses
[5:02] are going to do
[5:03] they're going to go over there to israel
[5:04] or they're going to be there in israel
[5:06] and they're going to preach grace to and
[5:08] 144 000 is going to accept it
[5:10] they're going to continue to preach that
[5:12] grace for 1260 days we'll cover it this
[5:15] afternoon in the sermon
[5:17] and only 144 000 people are going to are
[5:19] going to accept it
[5:20] the whole world is not going to accept
[5:22] it there is no grace for the gentile
[5:24] dispensation
[5:25] after the bride leaves so guess where
[5:28] grace is today
[5:30] it's in the bride of jesus christ amen
[5:32] also
[5:33] grace means approval so we're going to
[5:35] put that word approval in
[5:38] here we read genesis 6 verse 8
[5:41] but noah found approval or
[5:45] favor in the eyes of the lord noah found
[5:48] grace
[5:49] or approval in the eyes of the lord why
[5:52] didn't noah pick
[5:53] jon jones or or jim somebody else
[5:57] noah was the one that found grace in the
[5:59] eyes of the lord
[6:00] so god gave him grace to what preach a
[6:03] message for 120 years
[6:06] of grace you say no it was judgment it
[6:08] was grace
[6:10] they chose judgment the grace was i'll
[6:14] build you an ark and i'll get you in
[6:15] here
[6:17] but if you'll look at the at the um the
[6:20] mind of god
[6:21] he only built it big enough for eight
[6:23] people and some animals
[6:25] he knew who was going to accept and who
[6:26] wasn't he knew the whole world was not
[6:28] going to accept it
[6:29] right so being graceful though he gave
[6:32] them an opportunity
[6:34] to be saved so let's go now let's get
[6:36] exodus we read that about moses
[6:38] because moses found grace in the eyes of
[6:40] the lord so let's go over the book of
[6:42] ruth and let's look at this we're ru
[6:45] now here's ruth and boaz which is a type
[6:46] of what church of the bride
[6:48] and i say the church but the bride and
[6:51] christ right
[6:52] all right so look at verse 10 then she
[6:53] fell on her face and bowed herself to
[6:55] the ground and said unto him
[6:56] why have i found grace in thine eyes
[6:59] that thou should take knowledge of me
[7:01] see am i seeing i am a stranger
[7:04] and boaz answered and said unto her
[7:05] watch
[7:08] it hath fully been showed me he already
[7:11] knew who she was he already had
[7:14] he had found out who she was and he gave
[7:17] grace look all that thou hast done unto
[7:20] thy mother-in-law since the death of
[7:22] thine husband in other words he looked
[7:23] back at her history
[7:25] and he saw now let's go to the book of
[7:27] esther and let's make that a little bit
[7:29] more
[7:30] here's another woman in the bible name
[7:32] esther
[7:33] esther 2 verse 16. now remember
[7:36] you can only come into the king when the
[7:38] king called you right
[7:39] and it didn't matter if he didn't call
[7:41] you for a year
[7:43] you couldn't go in to see that king
[7:44] unless he called for you
[7:47] amen and now esther is realizing and
[7:50] seeing
[7:51] that something's fixing to happen to her
[7:53] people she hasn't been called by the
[7:55] king
[7:56] but she just doesn't know that the king
[7:58] is so desiring to see her
[8:01] that he's just as happy as he can be he
[8:03] puts a crown on her head when he
[8:04] instead of dying instead of having her
[8:06] head chopped off he puts a crown on her
[8:08] head
[8:08] same way with me and you so esther was
[8:10] taken under king of source into his
[8:12] house royal in the 10th month
[8:13] which is the month t beth seventh year
[8:15] of his reign and the king loved esther
[8:17] above all the women
[8:18] so there was a history he said what are
[8:22] you saying brother
[8:22] there's a history god god is graceful to
[8:25] those that need
[8:26] grace he's grateful to the ones that
[8:27] have a look at david
[8:31] david needed grace or he would have been
[8:33] killed
[8:34] but it was in grace through the prophet
[8:36] that came nathan
[8:37] so watch this here and the king loved
[8:39] esther above all the women
[8:41] and she obtained grace now i wrote
[8:43] myself a note
[8:44] it was her life that she had with the
[8:48] king
[8:50] before this time it's what found favor
[8:54] everybody got that it wasn't just oster
[8:58] i don't know who she is
[8:59] no look she obtained grace in favor in
[9:03] his sight more than all the virgins
[9:05] now the time before that she hasn't seen
[9:07] him in 30 days
[9:10] now she's the queen but he's so busy and
[9:12] got other he's got 100 concubines and
[9:14] he's got all these different ones
[9:16] but esther is his queen he hadn't seen
[9:19] her for 30 days he was so
[9:21] happy to see her because of what he knew
[9:25] who she was
[9:27] so he extended grace because of who she
[9:29] was
[9:31] not what she was going to become
[9:34] she extend god extends grace to me and
[9:36] you for
[9:37] looking at our life brother adam just
[9:39] said it he said i'd rather you live me a
[9:41] life
[9:41] than preach me a sermon god's going to
[9:44] find grace in your life
[9:45] not so much what you preach or what you
[9:47] talk out of your mouth
[9:48] and she obtained grace and favor in his
[9:50] sight more than all the virgins
[9:52] so that he set the royal crown upon her
[9:54] head and made her queen instead of
[9:56] vashtime
[9:57] now we know that because of what vast i
[10:00] did vashtai had grace at one time
[10:02] because she was the queen so the
[10:04] denominations or the
[10:05] or the world out there they had some
[10:07] grace with god during the different
[10:09] times of the church ages but there was a
[10:10] time
[10:11] when vast i said i'm not going to take
[10:13] what god said anymore
[10:16] i'm going to have my own idea and my own
[10:18] party we've been through the book of
[10:19] esther several times
[10:21] but esther found grace and favor in his
[10:24] sight
[10:25] because of what he remembered of what
[10:28] she was
[10:29] right all right so what brother brown
[10:31] tells us he said we need to what remind
[10:33] god
[10:36] what are you doing you're reminding god
[10:37] he you don't he don't need to be
[10:39] reminded but he wants you to tell him
[10:41] that's right he wants you to tell him
[10:43] now he don't want you to be the where
[10:44] esther didn't walk in and say now bless
[10:46] god i'm better than any of these people
[10:49] in here
[10:50] i'll prove it to you no she walked in
[10:53] humble she remember she didn't put on
[10:54] the clothes that were
[10:56] so extravagant she just put on a regular
[10:58] normal dress and
[10:59] did her hair herself and and walked into
[11:02] the
[11:02] to the uh to the king and the king found
[11:05] grace toward esther because
[11:09] at the point when she goes in she's
[11:11] supposed to be killed if he
[11:12] hadn't called her which is in another
[11:14] scripture besides this one but she
[11:16] obtained
[11:17] grace i want to ask you a question if
[11:18] you obtain grace
[11:21] that's our question today if you obtain
[11:22] grace no i'm just grace grace and my
[11:24] nose yet sometimes that's greasy grace
[11:27] i can do what i want to but
[11:31] but have you obtained grace in the eyes
[11:33] of the lord
[11:35] because look let's go to psalms 84 11.
[11:38] we're going to stay with the bible maybe
[11:40] next sunday we'll read some quotes but i
[11:41] like to just leave it in the bible
[11:43] because this is sunday school class so
[11:44] we're going to take it in the bible
[11:46] if you can't prove anything in the bible
[11:47] then you ought to be doing this anyway
[11:50] amen for the lord god as a son and
[11:53] shield the lord will give grace
[11:55] and glory no good thing will he withhold
[11:57] from them that
[11:58] walk uprightly all right let's go to
[12:01] proverbs 1 verse 7 the fear of the lord
[12:03] is the beginning of knowledge
[12:04] but fools despise wisdom and instruction
[12:07] my son hear the instruction of thy
[12:09] father and for
[12:10] satan not the law of thy mother for they
[12:12] shall be an ornament of grace
[12:14] unto thy head and chains
[12:17] about thy neck see there they found
[12:19] favor now watch this right here in
[12:21] zechariah 4 verse
[12:23] then he answered and spake unto me
[12:25] saying this is the word of the lord now
[12:26] we know
[12:28] that we come up we know who the
[12:29] zerubbabel is a type of
[12:31] of the uh you've got the one coming in
[12:35] you've got prophet of god preaching the
[12:38] message
[12:39] building the pyramid building the statue
[12:40] of perfect man but listen to what he
[12:42] says
[12:43] not by might nor by power but by my
[12:45] spirit saith the lord of hosts
[12:47] who out there o great mountain before
[12:49] zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain and
[12:51] he shall bring forth the headstone
[12:53] now who's the headstone christ christ is
[12:55] the headstone
[12:57] all right and you and i must become that
[12:58] too but look
[13:00] therefore with shoutings crying
[13:04] it's going to take double grace to get
[13:07] us into the capstone to get us to the
[13:09] headstone you say double grace by the
[13:10] way you're gonna need grace
[13:12] for your soul every day that you sin you
[13:14] sin don't you don't sin in your soul but
[13:16] your sin and your spirit you need grace
[13:17] for that
[13:17] and then you need grace for this thing
[13:19] because that's talking about the body
[13:20] change
[13:21] grace grace unto it what that great
[13:24] mountain or you
[13:26] we always point back at the statue of a
[13:27] perfect man but that's you
[13:29] i love the one where they got you know
[13:31] the lord jesus picture in there you know
[13:34] imposed behind it but you need to put
[13:36] your place in there
[13:37] you put your your face and your body in
[13:40] there because that's
[13:42] the statue of perfect man's already been
[13:44] proven by god through jesus christ
[13:46] it's already been proven by william
[13:48] branham
[13:50] that's right amen now who's it got to be
[13:51] proven by
[13:53] the bride of jesus christ because the
[13:55] headstone is going to come forth
[13:56] shouting
[13:57] crying double grace or grace grace unto
[14:01] it
[14:02] now watch in zechariah 12 10 this is
[14:04] what we were talking about a few minutes
[14:05] ago
[14:06] and i will pour out the house of david
[14:08] upon the inhabitants now this is talking
[14:10] about
[14:12] the two witnesses going to jerusalem
[14:13] we're going to talk about that this
[14:14] afternoon
[14:16] in the eternal redemption because we've
[14:18] got to get the jews redeemed
[14:21] they're part of it they're just not part
[14:23] of it right now
[14:24] and i will pour upon the house of david
[14:26] and who is that
[14:27] jews and upon the inhabitants of
[14:30] jerusalem
[14:32] it's kind of funny that that you take
[14:35] you take the daniel 70 weeks and it's
[14:37] what is to thy people and thy
[14:38] city thy people david
[14:42] thy city jerusalem all right the spirit
[14:45] of what
[14:46] grace and of supplication are a spirit
[14:48] of what
[14:49] acceptance and they shall look upon me
[14:52] whom they have pierced and they shall
[14:54] mourn for him as one morning for his
[14:55] only son and shall be in bitterness for
[14:57] him as one that is bitterness
[14:58] for his firstborn listen let's look at
[15:01] this just for a second
[15:04] when those two witnesses go to to the
[15:06] jews and they begin to preach
[15:08] the message of grace that jesus christ
[15:10] has already come
[15:12] that jesus christ has already
[15:17] i say got a gentile bride born again and
[15:20] got them out of the way
[15:22] they're going to look at that and
[15:23] they're going to do what the bible says
[15:24] they're going to cry and mourn and say
[15:27] just like what just like remember reuben
[15:29] and all the different ones when
[15:31] joseph was standing there and he
[15:32] revealed himself to him they said we're
[15:34] dead
[15:36] we're in trouble we we supposedly killed
[15:40] that man
[15:41] we killed our own brother but now what
[15:44] did
[15:45] joseph say he said don't worry
[15:48] this was not done for like in other
[15:50] words frivolously this was not done it
[15:52] was done
[15:53] what to preserve life because had joseph
[15:56] not
[15:57] come and got the vision of seven years
[15:59] of of plenty and seven years of famine
[16:01] the whole world would almost been wiped
[16:03] out because of the famine
[16:05] right but he gave grace to joseph
[16:09] joseph being a type of christ now what
[16:11] they're going to do
[16:12] is is they're going to see that through
[16:15] the preaching of the gospel see you can
[16:17] only see grace through the preaching of
[16:18] the gospel amen
[16:19] right there is no grace listen we see
[16:22] that the law
[16:23] we'll look at it in just a minute the
[16:24] law was given for transgression
[16:27] but grace and truth came by jesus christ
[16:29] we'll read it in just a minute so those
[16:30] two prophets
[16:32] are not going to bring an old testament
[16:34] gospel now they're going to be old
[16:35] testament
[16:36] prophets per se everybody got that
[16:37] elijah and moses
[16:39] but now remember the mentality of israel
[16:42] at this moment of the jews at this
[16:44] moment is what
[16:46] he's not coming to the gentiles he's
[16:48] coming to us
[16:50] right the messiah is coming to us he's
[16:52] not coming to them and that you know
[16:54] we're just going to maybe come in later
[16:55] on and
[16:56] we're looking for the messiah we're
[16:57] looking for elijah and we're looking for
[16:59] this
[16:59] because their eyes were blinded and
[17:02] actually their eyes were blinded the
[17:03] jews eyes were blinded
[17:05] for grace for me and you
[17:10] because remember we have no promise we
[17:12] just have a promise of a little hearing
[17:14] a little there and a little
[17:15] rahab coming in and a little esther and
[17:17] a little different ones coming in that
[17:18] are not
[17:19] jews by lineage but see they missed it
[17:23] because god blinded their eyes
[17:24] literally blinded their eyes so that you
[17:27] and i could come in
[17:28] well that was grace to us and it was
[17:30] grace to them
[17:31] because remember he'd already put them
[17:33] away
[17:35] and god's not going to be without a wife
[17:39] he's going to have a bride that's his
[17:42] listen
[17:43] what did he tell man what did he tell he
[17:45] said mary
[17:47] husband and wife created he them
[17:51] everybody got that that god is going to
[17:53] have a bride
[17:54] but once he divorced israel he had to
[17:58] marry somebody so he chose
[18:00] a gentile bride to marry
[18:04] put the jews away but by grace
[18:07] he couldn't forget them so he had to
[18:10] send them grace by two prophets
[18:12] he had to send them grace after you and
[18:15] i leave
[18:16] so the grace of god is not just to the
[18:18] bride
[18:19] right because remember we're going to
[18:22] talk about later on that even the grace
[18:23] of god
[18:24] goes all the way to the white throne
[18:26] judgment right
[18:29] because somebody's going to get eternal
[18:30] life because of grace right
[18:32] because of unmerited favor that somebody
[18:35] changed your tire or was
[18:36] good to you or gave you a cup of water
[18:38] in the name and even the foolish virgin
[18:40] is going to have grace at the white
[18:43] throne judgment
[18:45] they're going to make it amen but they
[18:48] just not bribed but they're going to
[18:49] make it
[18:50] all right everybody with me it's 1007 so
[18:53] we're getting pretty close
[18:54] so now let's go to john
[18:58] 1 verse 14.
[19:01] it says in the word was made flesh and
[19:02] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[19:04] the glory of the only begotten of the
[19:05] father
[19:06] full of grace and truth
[19:10] full of grace and truth now let's
[19:12] continue reading
[19:13] john bear witness of him and cried
[19:14] saying this was he of whom i spake
[19:16] he that cometh after me is preferred
[19:18] before me for he was before me and of
[19:20] his fullness
[19:22] have all we received look and grace for
[19:24] grace
[19:25] see john the baptist come in under the
[19:28] law though he was under the law he was
[19:30] an old testament prophet he was under
[19:31] the law
[19:32] but he was seeing that there was a
[19:34] messiah that was going to come
[19:36] so he had to introduce him under grace
[19:39] not
[19:39] judgment right but now who took the
[19:43] judgment
[19:44] the religious people of the day turned
[19:47] him down
[19:47] they turned john's message down they
[19:49] killed john
[19:51] and they didn't believe jesus was a
[19:52] messiah so see it wasn't grace there was
[19:54] your prophet standing there with two
[19:55] things to do
[19:56] he gave grace to a group of people that
[19:58] accepted it and he gave judgment to a
[20:00] group of people that did not accept it
[20:02] amen so now look
[20:06] for the law was given by moses now what
[20:09] was the law
[20:10] do's and don'ts written letter
[20:16] you pick up sticks on sunday you die
[20:19] or saturday i'm sorry saturday you die
[20:21] on the sabbath right
[20:23] you commit adultery you both get stoned
[20:25] you do this you're gonna get
[20:26] there was no grace but now remember you
[20:28] watch though as we back up from what we
[20:31] were talking about
[20:32] you say well there by the way there was
[20:34] no grace in the old testament yeah the
[20:35] grave was full of grace
[20:37] look at moses he killed an egyptian he
[20:40] was a murderer
[20:41] yet god used him to lead a group of
[20:43] people along the way
[20:45] david was a murderer and an adulterer
[20:48] and god still used him rahab was a
[20:50] harlot god still used her
[20:52] you see the different things of grace
[20:54] coming in there but there is a law
[20:56] that was given by moses that you go by
[21:00] but look but grace and truth came by
[21:02] jesus christ now what the prophet god
[21:03] tell us
[21:04] and i'll read this quote next sunday
[21:07] where brother brown said he said
[21:09] i thought that jehovah
[21:12] hated me and that jesus loved me
[21:17] right you know what he said uh when i
[21:19] was studying the bible as he was a young
[21:21] christian and studying the bible
[21:22] he was reading all them do's and don'ts
[21:24] in the old testament and how god would
[21:25] send a
[21:26] plague and kill 20 000 people but you he
[21:29] wasn't
[21:30] i say he wasn't he wasn't at the time
[21:33] looking at that god
[21:34] actually stopped those plagues by grace
[21:38] of moses and the different ones that run
[21:40] through with the sensor
[21:41] but then he finally saw remember he said
[21:43] then i'll read the new testament
[21:44] and there was just full of grace jesus
[21:47] just was right there with the sinners
[21:48] and the prostitutes and
[21:49] he was saving the people and he was
[21:51] doing this and he was doing that
[21:53] but he realized that they were the same
[21:55] person they were just in two different
[21:56] dispensations
[21:58] but it's all a dispensation of grace but
[22:00] there was a dispensation of law because
[22:02] the law had to come
[22:03] by moses but grace and truth came by
[22:06] jesus christ
[22:07] now look this romans 3 verse 24 know i
[22:12] made the statement a few minutes ago
[22:13] that
[22:14] grace is not for what you're going to do
[22:18] that's catholicism lord i'm going to sin
[22:22] tomorrow i need your forgiveness i'm
[22:23] going to go to the priest and do
[22:25] you know four hail marys and no that's
[22:27] what i told you before that's iniquity
[22:30] that's a big difference there's not any
[22:32] grace and iniquity because you knew
[22:33] better
[22:33] and you did it anyway or you didn't do
[22:35] it and you should have done it
[22:37] being justified freely by his grace
[22:40] through the redemption that is in christ
[22:41] jesus now watch what paul's trying to
[22:43] tell us
[22:44] whom god has set forth to be a
[22:46] perpetuation through
[22:47] faith in his blood to declare his
[22:50] righteousness i really enjoyed what
[22:52] brother
[22:52] well i enjoyed both of them brother mike
[22:54] bringing in hope versus faith
[22:58] faith is the substance of things hoped
[22:59] for the evidence of things not saying
[23:02] you have to have a hope first
[23:03] but that hope has to go into faith if
[23:05] it's not it's just hope
[23:07] when god has set forth to be a
[23:08] perpetuation through faith in his blood
[23:10] to declare his righteousness look for
[23:12] the remission of sins that are past
[23:15] you can't get forgiveness of sins you're
[23:16] going to do tomorrow
[23:18] that's why you have to pray daily that's
[23:20] why paul says i died daily that's why
[23:22] that you should be in in daily prayer
[23:25] asking god to forgive you of your sins
[23:26] because it's not for sins
[23:28] lord i'm going to sin next week five
[23:30] times and i can't help it
[23:34] you're right you can't help it you're
[23:37] just saying you can't help it
[23:39] but we go through life and we we say god
[23:42] please forgive me for that because
[23:44] you don't you listen is anybody
[23:46] condemned about what they're going to do
[23:48] tomorrow
[23:50] think about it it just brings a blank
[23:52] spot in your head
[23:53] you don't even know what you're going to
[23:54] do tomorrow but you know you're going to
[23:56] sin
[23:58] every day amen in our humanity
[24:02] not in your soul if you're born again
[24:04] it's in your humanity
[24:06] you're going to sin and you're going to
[24:09] go to god and you're going to
[24:10] then what's it going to do it's going to
[24:11] bring your remembrance
[24:13] what you did and then you're going to
[24:15] ask god to forgive you let's read romans

[26:05] were made sinners

[26:09] one shall many be made righteous
[26:11] moreover the law entered that the
[26:13] offense might abound
[26:16] but where sin abounded grace did much
[26:20] more about
[26:22] that as sin hath reigned unto death even
[26:25] so my
[26:25] grace reigned through the righteousness
[26:28] unto eternal life
[26:29] by jesus christ our lord
