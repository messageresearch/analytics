we're glad to see everybody just remember these remember all of the announcements and everything and just pray that the Lord would would be with each one now I want to ask you to do something for because I'm not I I'm not a I'm having some problems about 12:30 in the morning that a certain brother is calling me and uh I've asked him if he would have call me a little earlier but the reason I'm saying that is is he told me finally his name this morning and somebody needs if we can find out we've got his phone number and where he lives but uh if anybody knows anything about him I wish you let me know his name is Bruce Lee right good name to remember in it I don't think he's a body guy I think he's dead okay I hope it's not him all right but uh he's kind of kind of making some inroads talking and I'm making a few too so I said this morning to him I said well you know just what do you got to do with all this well he let me know he was a prophet he thought so that's all right and we believe in the five-fold ministry Prophet that's all right am we believe in it you know praise the Lord for it and you know but uh just pray that the Lord would help us to to uh find out what it all is and what's going on because he may show up Among Us sometimes and that's fine too cuz I believe in a five full ministry amen and praising the Lord for that okay all right but just remember that remember praying for brother Serano today as he ministers to us and true we've got an announcement to make we'll be making it a good many times and I'll just start it off by saying it uh little uh Thomas has made the inroad into the family now and you know been kind of got the intent to adopt and that'll be a while but what we're going to do is is we're going to have a not a baby shower cuz he not a baby he's 7 years old so we're going to have a tree foot downstairs and call it a money tree and instead of you trying to buy gifts for him as presents and things you just clip the money on the money tree and then on the 28th we will be having a kind of a welcome to him you know and all and be having cake and ice cream after the evening service so remember that now on the 28th of August okay and there'll be a money tree there you can just clip it on whatever you want to do that'll be fine CU it'll just be uh instead of giving him a baby shower we give him a boy shower so just remember that okay all mind's clear everything's great so let's just go right on into the service with brother Serano and just pray that the Lord would bless him and give us the word of the Lord this day right

me every time I come and visit you know we always come every year we I think we just missed one or two years since 1998 you have come so uh I feel like uh this this is my second country now okay and uh I'm happy to be with my wife here sister Chi-Chi and uh I'm thankful for brother Luis and Christine because they've uh taken us in and we stay with their place we stay with them in their place and they're they've been taking taking us to places and we'll brother Louise will drive me to some more places while we're here amen so uh uh we hope hope to be able to attend a camp meeting next week and U uh be able to visit some of the churches in the area so you you remember us in prayer right okay I bring you greetings also from the church of the Overcomer in the town of Tai Tha uh that's outside of Metro Manila but just outside of Metro Manila amen and uh the Saints in the Philippines all uh greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus yes sir okay I would like to speak tonight on a subject which the Lord laid in my heart and I entitled it the the black name the black name of the Lord amen amen um and my subtitle will be bearing the reproach of Christ amen we all have to bear the reproach of Christ if you're if you're a Christian this morning amen amen that's right it's incumbent upon all of us that uh we bear the reproach of christen and for a scripture reading I would like to turn to the Book of Mark chapter 4 verse 1-6 a share main standing we with it verse one reads and he went out from then and came into his own country that's right and his disciples follow him right and when the Sabbath day has come he began to teach in the synagogue and many hearing him were astonished saying from whence has this man these things yeah and what wisdom is this which is given unto him that even such Mighty works are wrought by his hands amen is this not the carpenter the son of Mary the brother of James and Joseph and Judah and Simon and are not this right here his his sisters here with us right in other words they know him in that place it's his own country uh later on I'll tell you what's wrong with this uh uh description of the Lord Jesus and the Bible said and they were offended at him yeah but Jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honor right but in his own country right and among his own King in and in his own house right and he could do here no Mighty work save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed them and he marveled because of their unbelief and he went round about the village teaching these are the words of the Lord may he add his Blessing to the reading of his word let's all pray father once again we come to you humbly uh believing that uh you are able to open our understanding oh God and uh allow us to see the light of the scriptures that we've just read amen we thank you Lord I pray for every person that has come uh our hearts are heavy with burdens that we bring before you and I I just trust that you understand them more you know all about it Lord and you're you're willing to stretch forth your hand and uh meet every need this morning we thank you and praise you may your name be glorified in Jesus name amen amen amen may be seated hallelujah amen amen amen so going back to our scripture scripture you're reading in Mark chapter 4 uh it's interesting that uh they mentioned the name of the mother of Jesus even mentioned the name of his brothers and the people say we know we even know his sisters I mean uh we know this guy how how come he's he's able to say these things you know how can he say these things how can he do these Mighty Works Hallelujah and uh uh uh you would think uh uh this is a compliment to the Lord Jesus but no they were actually debasing him that's right because you see they mentioned the name of his mother yeah but no mention about his father right and uh uh to to a Jewish mind you know this is this is an insult this is this could be the gravest way to demean a person it's not to name to mention the name of the father and and just mention the name of the of the mother Hallelujah you know in Jewish uh culture talk of SC uh Scandal or sexual scandal in parentage is a big insult and you know uh those Jewish people they could count you know they they knew that uh Mar Mary gave birth just a a few a few months after he after Mary after Joseph married him yeah right you know uh and there are talks that uh Jesus was actually consed when they were still yeah they were still single you know it was a premarital Affair but worse than that there are thoughts that somebody else father Jesus yeah yeah that Jesus was a bustard bustard child yeah and you know uh when they want to take out uh Saddam Hussein the the American soldiers they went over there and of course the uh Saddam Hussein's soldiers were um killing all killing all the Americans that that were coming and so what they did they attached a big loud speaker in one of the uh armored vehicles and they play the tape you know repeatedly telling the uh Iraqi soldiers that their mothers were born illegitimately yeah and the Iraqi soldiers were they got so mad that uh they came out of their secret bunkers and started firing wildly sure at the at the speaker they they wanted to shoot down the speaker because they didn't want to hear it that their mothers were born illegitimately but that made them sitting sitting du targets you know for the Americans and they took them out Hallelujah I kind of like that strategy because out there in the Middle East you know it's it's a big insult yeah if you try to say that the parents have committed sexual Scandal scandals you know they can't take it and we see in the Bible that even Jesus disciple disciples were identified by their father's name yeah let's read it in Matthew chapter 10 verse 2- 4 it reads now the names of the 12 apostles are this the first Simon son of Jonas see who is called Peter and Andrew his brother yeah and then James and the son of seede see the fathers are always mentioned right because it's an honor to take the name of the father right and Jesus was supposed to be a firstborn child right he was supposed to be associated with the name of the father yeah he should carry the name of the father but no the biblical account calls him the son of Mary Hallelujah and then philli and barom Thomas and Matthew the Publican James the son of alus there he goes again and leus whose soname was Theus Simon the Canaanite and Judah es scariot who who had betrayed him him you see what I mean brother Bam put it in this way he explained it in this way he said that's how someone uh got it the other day I've got a lot of letters on that on hybrid religion that I made a remark over in the Bible said that the illegit illegitimate child or a bastard child could not enter the congregation of the Lord for 10 Generations how about that which would be 400 years right that illegitimate child could not come into the congregation of the Lord hallelujah right that's how bad that hybriding was right and that was a woman that let another man live with her in order to bring forth a child right that that child was hybrid not by its father but but by some other man see and that was so evil before God it taken 10 generations to ever breath them out again before God Amen right you see God uh looked at it uh that this was the sin was so evil that it would take 10 Generations right or 400 years right before a bastard child can come in and and uh uh be a part of the worship in the temple amen right Hallelujah but I believe this is so classic what we read in Matthew chapter 16 verse 17 you know the discourse between the Lord Jesus and Peter yeah Hallelujah because you know the Lord uh was telling was asking the disciples who do you think that I am who do you think the sign of the son of man is and and and and and to these Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God hallelujah and uh Jesus was um impressed with what Peter had to say and so he made this comment he said Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon B Jonah see the name of the father is mentioned again right meaning Jesus was saying Simon your father's name is Jonah yeah but Flesh and Blood did not reveal it to you flesh and blood has not revealed it unto you but my My Father which is in heaven you got a human father but human fathers cannot give you this Revelation matter of fact no man no human being can give you a revelation of who Jesus really was but he said my Father in Heaven Hallelujah the one that people did not recognize that's right amen because they're they're they're St you know know she she I mean Joseph was not his real father amen and uh something must must happened there uh uh somebody some somebody else could have been involved Hallelujah but I like this you know flesh and blood cannot reveal who Jesus Isen that's right amen no no no no great preacher no Bible scholar right none of the uh none of the Bible School teachers none of the theologians can can tell you who Jesus really is right right CU you know they all have their opinion of who Jesus is right yeah some people have him to be just a man yeah you know some people have him to be a special man and some people have him to be a prophet but Peter got it right he said you are the Christ you are the one that was has been prophesied to us the Messiah right amen hallelujah Moses told them there was going coming a there was uh God would send them a prophet like unto him and when this Prophet comes on the scene that they have to hear him or they would be cut off from the people right amen hallelujah thank you Jesus amen and amen but but Peter said you are the Christ you are that one the son of the Living God and so the Lord said you're blessed Peter and Upon This Rock Amen of course we know what what that rock is it is the rock of revelation of who Jesus Christ is wasn't Peter wasn't even Jesus but it was the rock of revelation of who Jesus is hallelujah so we remember that U no Jew was named after his mother like Jesus it's a great dishonor yeah to name a d a Jew after his mother because it should be the father amen right did you know that Jesus was also called amongst the Jews the son of panta Jesus was known as the son of panta I I read this article about about him written by uh one Robin Robin Hellwig R Larson a a ger author which says about 177 ad the Greek philosopher celsus in his book The True word express what appears to have been the consensus Jewish opinion about Jesus that his father was a Roman Roman soldier called panta Pantera means Panther and was fairly common name name among Roman soldiers the rumor is repeated in the talmud and in medieval Jewish medial Jewish writings where Jesus is referred to as yesu panta think about that and in 19 in 1859 a gravestone actually surfaced in Germany for a Roman soldier called Tiberius Tiberius Julius abdes panta whose unit cohort I sagit sorum had served in Judea before moving to Germany so they found a grave of this man and the Romantic historians have hypothesized this to be Jesus father especially as the word abdes which means Servants of God s just a Jewish background yeah Hallelujah so can you imagine this the Jewish people even up to now 2,000 years after Jesus was born there're still talking about it yeah the and giving him a black name right that he was truly a uh son of a Roman soldier named panta and they call him Jesus panta yesu panta that gave us a serious problem that uh we had to uh uh contend with you know we had to confront the problem because you know in in one message brother bandam spoke about illegitimate children uh they're not going to make it to the Rapture yeah you know and so there were illegitimate people in my church and they heard me uh quote better random say that you know illegitimate children are not predestinated you know they're not going to make it to the rap they can be saved but not make it to the Rapture Hallelujah and and so this was a problem I mean some of the Believers say I mean what's the use of staying in this church if I won't make it in the Rapture anyway so I pray to the Lord for an answer you know how can I confront this problem Lord and the lord gave me this quotation about illegitimate children not allowed not not being allowed to enter the temple for 10 Generations brother R made this explanation he said but that doesn't apply to this age and it really gave me a sigh of relief it really liberated a lot of people in the Philippines right amen I guess in the US too more so in the US this doesn't apply to this age exactly you have a birth now oh my amen right there had just one birth back there that was the actual sexual breeding amen but we have this new birth now which is the spiritual that breeds all that call out amen I was thinking of that word call what what what does the word call means it means all the negative [Music] traits that's right amen all the bad habits right all the bad jeans right amen amen it breeds all the the call out and we are new creatures in Christ Jesus born again of the spirit of God Amen it says new creatures amen oh the word creature if some of you good Scholars here that understand if you don't you might look it up the creature comes from the Greek word a new creation right amen hallelujah I'm thankful for the new birth amen sir amen it made us not new creatures but a new creation GL Hallelujah that's right a new breed of people hallelujah what kind of people human beings with God inside Hallelujah oh my Hallelujah that's what Jesus was yes sir a human being God inside hallelujah thank you Jesus and then he said oh the same as you are a creature here born sexually you are then a new creature right amen born Heavenly oh my oh in God's new creation of a new am right New Creation at Birth but it has to be a birth just the same as the natural birth is necessary the spiritual birth is just as necessary as the natural birth amen it's not an option Jesus said you must be born again hallelujah amen and and I thank God that that he has allowed us the privilege of uh having this experience of being born again amen amen we were for born the first time by our heavenly by our Earthly excuse me okay sorry thank you brother appr we were born the first time by our Earthly father amen right but we were born the second time by our heavenly father born into the family of God hallelujah and uh you know God only has one family right half of them part of them is in heaven already right and one part is still here on Earth amen and the Bible tells us that the family in Heaven and Earth is named after amen amen exactly amen the Lord Jesus Christ and that's the name we carry Hallelujah there's a there's a dirtiness and a shadow and a blackness that hangs about that name right but you can't get away from it right you have to carry it amen you're a Christian you carry it Glory you're married to Christ you have to carry his name Hallelujah exactly look at this verse this quotation but said the devil has always been after the church right oh yeah he was after Christ and now he's after the church the Church of the Living God is that right and it's always had a black name right see what I'm talking about it's always had a black name Jesus was born in this world with a black name as a legitimate child did you know that supposed to be a child out of holy redlock either a child of Joseph before they got married or somebody else's child Jesus had that hang that hanging on him but in his heart he knew he was the son of God God Amen you see that's the main thing right you know Jesus didn't care what people thought about him n amen the main thing was Jesus knew who he was amen he said I came from God I go back to God when he was asked by pontious pilate are you the king it's for this purpose that I came to this world I came I was born to reain Hallelujah he knew who he was Hallelujah am he knew that he was the Fulfillment of the prophecy in Revelation uh in Genesis chapter 3 right amen you know he was the seed of the woman amen right that was to crush the head of the seed of the serpent Hallelujah and uh brother bman said that's the reason why Jesus was so confident you know that whatever he says will come to pass right you know this man's sight will be restored it came to pass stand up and be healed your sins are forgiven you know it came to pass whatever he says comes to pass he's so confident butam said that's because he knew who he was Glory this is what I'm trying to drive to you am brothers and sisters it's important that you know who you are right amen because people will not will never probably never change their opinion about you like they never changed the opinion about Jesus they're still talking about it and trying to prove that Jesus was an illegitimate uh son of Mary Hallelujah so what would they think about you yeah Hallelujah so they can say all manner of negative things yeah they can see all the call in you yeah Hallelujah but but doesn't matter as long as you know who you are Hallelujah and I thank God Hallelujah the Heavenly Father showed us revealed to us who we are amen amen we were a part of God Amen Hallelujah chosen by God before the foundation of the world we are offsprings of the Living God that's right Hallelujah by virtue of the second birth amen right Hallelujah you see John the Baptist first it was Jesus Jesus he could do no Miracles the Bible said because of the people's unbelief right they knew him too well oh we know this man he's just a carpenter this is Mary's Mar's a uh uh boy and we know all his brothers and sisters and so the power of Jesus to do something great for them was actually limited right think about it amen you limit God right in what he can do in your life by your own unbelief you limit God's omnipotence think about it amen hallelujah and the Bible said Jesus marveled at their unbelief hallelujah how come these people don't believe right I mean I go to all places and uh and people believe but in my own Homeland they don't believe right Hallelujah and John the Baptist we come to John the Baptist ministry now and he was uh fairly accepted by the Jewish people and brother bam explains it this way in John the Baptist is that after he being recognized as a prophet among the people so he he was actually recognized as a prophet among his people oh you know they thought John was a good Prophet too yeah until he recognized Jesus and said that that legitimate born of illegitimate born child so believe among the people that that that fellow was the Messiah you he was popular amongst the people until right he started introducing the Lord Jesus as the Messiah when he started preaching about Jesus then his popularity went down right and the people began to reject him and uh think that is not a true Prophet from God yeah Hallelujah the first first thing B said when he was born he was born with a dirty name that's the reason why to begin with amongst the people as a illegitimate child yeah he fought himself right on through that oh my I like that Jesus fought himself through all of that right amen I hope you can do the same amen you know uh not limit what you can do with what people say about you the negative things they say about you oh you're not uh you're too young you're too old you're you're not uh you're not pretty enough yeah you don't have enough education you will amount to you will not amount to anything uh but you see if you entertain these thoughts in your mind well it will really H really happen to you what they say will really happen to you because it has created unbelief in your mind and your unbelief is actually limiting your destiny amen hallelujah what's going to happen to what's happening uh uh and what what what will come come out of you in this life Hallelujah is is limited by how you think about yourself and how easy it is mhm for us to have a low esteem of our own person because of what people say about us amen hallelujah aren't you thankful for the new birth Hallelujah aren't you thankful for justification Hallelujah the the things that they said about us are probably true we did all those things but thank God for the New Birth when God looks at me this morning he looks at me as a perfect Son of God hallelujah and I don't care what people say that's right Amen in the sight of God in the sight of God I have been accepted right Hallelujah that's right Hallelujah Glory that's right thank you Jesus Mary having this baby Joseph is this baby by Joseph without being married he come amongst the young children with a name can you imagine that Jesus playing with the the other kids and the other kids are talking about Jesus you know Joseph was not his real daddy Hallelujah but in his heart he know he was the son of God see he fought through that amen that's right Jesus came the same way dressed Immortal God dressed in human flesh that's right and because he was born in a manger in a t stable full of manure and not a place to lay his head born thinking with a illegitimate name t to him see all this things that he was and now he come up a carpenter son now he had no schooling yeah now this was Jesus reputation and brother said this in Christ is revealed in his own word hallelujah now this is the mystery gowake Jesus 1963 and remember brother said Jesus was human mhm yeah so much human that he could die so much human that he could cry so much human that he could hunger right he was in one sense human right because he was the creative Son of God God dwelt in him right now but he was human and he was human and God together right I like that exactly right that's that that puts it very very clearly he was human and God together amen God created a blood cell in the womb of Mary hallelujah what for so he can bleed right right so that his blood can be a sacrifice right amen an offering so God can take us back into fellowship with him right Amen brother talks about the blood coming back upon the worshipper yes sir you know he had to be a human being to be to be akin to human beings that's correct Hallelujah and in order for him to have blood he must Veil himself with human flesh notice God promised God is obligated to take care of it right and this blood cell where he formed he moved into this womb covered himself with his own creative blood think about it amen brought forth the son Christ Jesus yes sir the blood cell was broken at Calvary and the blood run out of his body in order that he could bring back to himself Fellowship exactly it oh I think this is so beautiful the only way he can bring us back into his presence is for him to bleed amen right his own son to bleed that's why he had to become a human being God had to Veil himself in human flesh he was both human and divine at the same time Hallelujah that's right and a lot of people are not able to comprehend that right amen hallelujah that's right including the Jews I guess PE better said uh he was talking to a Jew one time and and the Jew said you cannot Chop God in three pieces and hand them to hand him to a Jew and because uh he was always bragging about the name of Jesus when John Ryan was uh uh his sight was restored brother M said it was the name of Jesus he did it in jesus' name amen hallelujah it was the resurrected Christ that did the work amen and his sight was restored amen and the Jewish rabbi witnessed all this and he couldn't take that brother B was bragging about the name of Jesus that uh he did it in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and so that conversation ensued yeah you can't chop three gods in into threee and hand them to a Jew and B said no I I'm not doing that uh but and he said would it be hard for you to believe the prophets and the the rabbi said of course not well the who is this uh spoken of in Isaiah chapter 9:6 a son is given whose name will be wonderful counselor Mighty God who was he referring to and the rub rabbi said the Messiah and the next question was what relationship would the Messiah have to God and the rabbi said he will be God hallelujah but the Messiah the the the the the Jewish rabbi I should said I should have said um uh said well if if I preach that he knew it was the truth but if I I preach that I would be begging out on the street hallelujah hallelujah you see the black name right you see the reproach right the Jewish uh Rabbi could not preach the name of Jesus because he'd be out begging on the street right that's the reproach of Christ amen hallelujah Isaiah 53:3 says he is despised yes and rejected man A Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him meaning we did not want to associate with him Hallelujah he was despised he was insulted debased he was held in low esteem right and we were we esteemed him not the Bible said right y well what about the bride of Christ what about the what about the believer today amen you took his name didn't you amen yes sir amen but the believer today he wants to be honored and he wants to be accepted of all man oh yeah is a man it's man that's that's full of fun and acquainted with enjoyment and pleasure yeah Hallelujah and he wants he wants to be associated with people that are great yeah popular people celebrities he always wants to take a picture of them in in a selfie yeah that's what we do to be associated with C certain people of importance we take selfish with them we want to be accepted and we we always want to hold a high esteem of ourselves yeah you know students in our country it's this is being drilled into their brain you know you have to have a high esteem of yourself Hallelujah this this is what Believers this is what believers do right this is so opposite to what to what Christ did Hallelujah he was despised and rejected let me let me read it again A Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief right and we he as it were our faces from him nobody wanted to be associated with him even Peter denied him tce he was despised and we esteemed him not right he was penalized with a punishment that's only fit for criminals right amen the harshest punishment that could ever be Meed to a sinner he took it amen think of it amen hallelujah he was debased but Paul said in Hebrews chapter 11 verse 26 let's read this verse please put it on the screen I want everybody to read this verse it says esteeming the reproach of Christ right oh my they say all manner of bad things about Christ but it should be regarded by Believers as an honor to be associated with the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah because this was what Moses did y he esteemed the reproach of Christ greater than the than the treasures in Egypt oh my y you know we have these magazines now uh social magazines uh and the economic magazines and and they list who the who's who you know know the most popular people the richest people in the world Hallelujah and uh people feel good when they see their name in the in the magazine one of the richest one of the billionaires yeah uh 10 Filipinos are included in the uh I forget what magazine is that but 10 Filipinos are included can you believe that in the billionaires of the world 10 Filipinos and Filipinos are so happy and proud that their names are are listed to be one of them but you see Moses took the name of Christ the reproach of Christ he took the role of Christ yeah being a deliverer amen hallelujah and he preferred to be identified with the slaves rather than be identified with pharaoh and the Kingdom of Egypt am amen it meant more to him than all the riches of Egypt amen and the Bible said for he that he had respect unto the recompense of the reward because Moses knew what was coming in the future I don't look at things how it is today I'm looking at the recompense of the reward Hallelujah come to think of it this whole world and people are dying for it people are fighting over it there's a small group of islands in the west Phil Philippine Sea and the people are fighting for it China is fighting of fighting for it Vietnam is fighting for its rights uh to own the property and Indonesia the same thing our country fights for its rights Hallelujah and uh people talk about a war might ensue because of this Hallelujah and and and people are dying because you know they crave The Riches of the world but if you think of it this world this whole earth has been committed to you am it's yours Glory Hallelujah this world this whole world has a title deed amen yeah and it belongs to you amen hallelujah amen Christ held it in his hand but you know what happened he gave it to John y he said take it John and eat [Laughter] it because this Earth belongs to Believers sons and daughters that have been born again into the family of God hallelujah know you not that you shall judge Angels know ye not that ye shall judge the whole world hallelujah amen think of it even Barack Obama will come before you in judgment am and now you can say whatever you want then hallelujah that's the promise of the word right you see because he had respect unto the recompense of the word all this will come to nothing right hallelujah oh all what what we call uh powers that be oh my Hallelujah it will amount to nothing and Jesus Christ will rule this whole earth with the bride of Christ hallelujah amen oh my oh my that's why I'm so thankful for this message yes because he has that this message has taken out out out out of this mess amen out of the religious mess that we were in aren't you thankful amen out of denominational spirit amen denominational uh teaching Yen and mindset y let me share with you something I hope you don't take offense brother Brenham when he preached the Hebrew series I I think he preaches brother Dale in Jefferson Bill in his own congregation and he said this when he preached that series listen remember brother said this is a Baptist Tabernacle yeah used to be butman was Baptist and most of the people came from the Baptist background and he said this is a Baptist Tabernacle he was right in Jefferson B brandham Tabernacle his own congregation he said this is a Baptist Tabernacle there it is that's what you get you organize yours y yeah oh you say we're not an organization Z was speaking for his congregation oh you say they're defending themselves we're not an organization butam said yes you are right certainly you are and I was thinking of the people they might be thinking how in the world huh how in the world is brother saying this about us you say we are just a fellowship and I'm say yeah to anybody that comes in the door and teachs just like the way you believe it yeah it's all right you're just a fellowship we you're in good fellowship with people who believe it exactly the way you do yeah but what one you don't throw him out he he was meaning if once somebody disagrees with what you teach and what you believe in this church you don't throw him out he said but you will excommunicate him from your Brotherhood that's what an organization does that's what denomination does hallelujah you have to believe it exactly the way you believe it or you're out right you know we dis dechristianize other people that don't see it the way we do right and brother said it's a wrong Spirit Hallelujah this was exactly what the prophet fought the denominational Spirit organized religion has this kind of spirit that's right Hallelujah this was actually what he fought against right it's to the it's the spirit the system that tries to break Fellowship of the Brotherhood it breaks the Brotherhood am We Are One amen we have been baptized into this body by one Spirit Hallelujah and BR said that's exactly right he pinned it right down to his congregation that's exactly right oh he said you got away of doing it I wonder if message believer today have a way of doing it Hallelujah you have a way of doing it B said so has God got a way of doing it it's God's church but God's church will move on and the pillar of Fire won't stand for that hallelujah amen that's right what a rebuke yes I take this as a rebuke of the prophet of God for this age to me amen as a message believer amen hallelujah you know we we we don't we don't make a document that says these people are not true believers no we don't we don't we don't write it down and make it official but in Our Minds come on brother we have a way of doing it amen hallelujah h you have a tendency to classify s certain groups this group belongs to this camp and this camp and that camp won't have anything to do with them because they don't believe what we believe in this church and vam said the pillar of fire will never stand for that Hallelujah that's why he sent the prophet messenger am to set us free from the bondage of Egypt amen amen that's right denominational bondage yes sir that's right denominational Spirit you know we say we we got out of denominations many years ago the question is has the denomination got out of you you know brother said before you can take the water out of a man first you need to take him out of the water so we've been taken out of the water of denomination but some of us still has to take the water out of us our system you know we come to the message and we bring our beliefs into the message we try to mix our conception right into what the prophet of God taught that's why we have all kinds of problems in this message that's right amen but brother bandam he knew exactly what he was yes am let me read to you the m is letting off the pressure he said and I wouldn't come here to be heard said this I wouldn't come here to be heard because I'm not much to listen to he knew he said bad voice not an educated man and never stay in my text oh my I I hate that about about preachers you know they they wonder and they but but said that about himself he said I never stay with my text and Skip all over from Genesis to Revelation and he said and I'm not an eloquent speaker right but he said I do love the Lord that's the main thing right I do love the Lord and I can't love Christ until first I love his people amen see I've got to love his people so if I love his people then I can say I love him right Hallelujah I like that don't you amen so now like John the Baptist he was the third Elijah amen right and he was reproached for preaching Christ right and brother brandham all he did was preach Christ am yes sir hallelujah amen and he being reproached for doing so right he said Christ is the word amen and God help me if I preach outside of the word of God but today people magnify his mistakes and Mal educ ation and poor family background people call him poor and ignorant can't even pronounce his words right he says uh Empire for Empire and and he says duter for Deuteronomy he says nuclear for nuclear you know can't even pronounce this right it shows is education is not sufficient right and there's there's talks that he learned which scra and budo budo when he went to Africa and India that's why he could read the minds of people W and then the cloud controversy oh yeah can you believe a lot of people are believing now that it never happened Hallelujah H and then somebody featured him in a book it's called God's generals yeah at first they introduced brother random as a mighty man of God you know and then towards the end he trayed yeah he began to call himself the Elijah of our day and God didn't like that they say thus his tragic death yeah can you imagine but this was the reproach that's right of William brandom Hallelujah he too had a black name he's called false prophet and if if follow we follow the message and they accuse us of following a man of course we do because the man followed Christ hallelujah amen that's right we're nothing but an oldfashioned cult yeah I would rather be that than the mega churches of today hallelujah oh my he's a poor man not well known in this age of knowledge Hallelujah you know the Bible talks about clouded Minds the minds of the people will be clouded in SEC 2 Thessalonians chap 2:1 even said and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie you tell them the truth they won't believe it right tell them a lie they say Amen to that Hallelujah you'll be surprised you'll be surprised how many people try to change the history and say that the Jewish Holocaust did not actually happen what they're saying they won't teach it they won't they won't teach it that's right and and and what do our schools teach about about the creation account they don't teach it they teach the Darwin Theory Hallelujah and that's a lie but people would rather believe that than the truth of the word of God Amen would you believe 14 million Filipinos actually believe that our former dictator fergin Marcus who who looted our country robbed our country of its scoffers for 14 years and killed a lot of our countrymen is actually they're saying is act he's actually the greatest president we've ever had yeah think about it and people believe that Hallelujah well they can say whatever they want about brother brandom about this message Hallelujah but what's important is that you know who you are right what's important is that you know who Christ is hallelujah I may have um many calls so to speak about my being about my personality Hallelujah but all that has been overshadowed by the image of Christ Hallelujah I stand here today you don't see roel Serano you see Christ because I died a long time ago amen and my life is hid in Christ in God Amen hallelujah it's no long longer me that lives there Christ living within me amen hallelujah so what am I saying you have to esteem it right lift the name of the of Jesus on high it's a judaist Christians Hallelujah to preserve the dignity and honor of that name am that's right Hallelujah amen we need to be proud of it amen not to be ashamed Hallelujah of the name of Jesus in an age where they turned the name of Jesus into a curse in movies they they only they only say the name of Jesus when they're cursing Hallelujah but you see that's part of the reproach too amen and you have to beg the reproach of Christ am Hallelujah you see the prophet's stubbornness his uncompromising nature he says it like it is you know he he he didn't want to he didn't mince his word so to speak that's right Hallelujah I'm proud of it amen I'm thankful to God that he he sent a man he sent as a prophet like that amen who would not not compromise Hallelujah that's right who would only believe what the word of God says he's very undenominational he has no association with any organized religion thank God that he has preserved the purity of this messag amen hallelujah so I really like that song must Jesus bear his cross alone Al it says must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free no there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me the Lord said you want to follow me take up your cross follow me Acts chapter 2:38 Peter was the one Speaking therefore let all the house of Israel see the C Peter who denied Jesus three times something happened to him he's bold now amen he has no fear now Hallelujah and he was addressing the house of Israel the great leaders that were there I'm saying let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made made that same Jesus the one they debased the one they put to shame the one they talk about as being illegitimate Hallelujah they made Jesus the One They Crucified whom you have crucified both Lord and Christ right that's why it's Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah amen what Peter was saying is you debase the man but God lifted his lifted him up right you put him to shame but God gave him a name that is above every name Hallelujah yes sir Philippians chapter 2 let's read it verse 6 to 11 quoting Isaiah 45:23 this is a quotation of the Old Testament Paul said who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God he didn't think it was something that he would be accountable for to say that he is God or that he is equal with God why because he is God but he made himself of no reputation we all want to have a good reputation but Christ made himself of no reputation yes and took upon him the form of a servant amen that's right that's right you were talking about races last night you know how people can be prejudiced over certain uh uh certain people hallelujah look at look look about the Lord Jesus look look at the Lord Jesus he took upon himself the form of a slave yeah and was made in the likeness of men exactly right right y I probably have the skin color of the Lord Jesus whether you agree or disagree and being found in a fashion as a man humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross where for God also had highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name exactly right not just any godlings that they uh used to have the Greeks and the Roman mythology gods Hallelujah not just one of the Gods but he was he was given a name that is above every name amen right this is is the very name of God hallelujah amen and amen and at the name of Jesus look at Isaiah 45 and verse 23 you know it applies that prophecy to the name of Jesus At The Name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things on earth and things under there Earth and and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father Hallelujah that's right the Greek tetraman speaks about it YH W so sacred for the Jewish people to even utter it with their lips human lips cannot utter this name because this is the name of God Amen right Hallelujah the name of God himself amen that's why that Jewish RAB Rabbi understood I mean he knew it that Jesus was the Messiah he was the promised Pro Prophet Moses promised a prophet to come like unto him he was the child that was supposed to be given who whose name will be called wonderful Mighty God counselor Everlasting father amen he knew it well amen that that uh this was the the Messiah the prophet amen so what what Peter was saying is that the man's point of view was God was going to set as a prophet and the prophet is going to be a man and this man came to being and he fulfilled the scriptures and he was known to be the Lord Jesus Christ in the book of book of Acts it explicitly explains that it was the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah that's why in The Book of Psalms I think it was in 110 um uh David said the Lord said unto my Lord hallelujah the Lord Yahweh said unto my Lord the prophet the son of man the Messiah Hallelujah so he was better better asked the the the rabbi what would be the relationship of the Prophet to yah and the rabbi said he would be yve Hallelujah let's no such thing as two persons in the godhead some group they're saying trinitarian is wrong because they believe in three Oneness in is wrong because they believe in one was Tess must be right now they're teaching two two Lords Hallelujah I don't find that in the message instead the brother brother BR said this in Hebrews chapter 4 then that theophany had to be made flesh he was first theophany before he became flesh amen yes sir and brother said not another person but the same person has to become flesh to take the sting out of death oh my so there goes your two person's Doctrine two Lords and then he goes on to say now when it said here that he emptied himself or who poured he poured out now we would think like this that he vomit up the English word emptied or poured out from him see something went out of him that was different from him this was the English word yeah it means that but the word kenas in the Greek does not mean that righten it does not mean he vomit up or some his arm went off and his eye went out another person yeah doesn't mean that no but the very same person of God glory changed into something else he poured himself into a mask behind the mask Hallelujah not another person but it's the very person of God oh my I like this godhead teaching Hallelujah tells us there's only one God Amen tells us and we can worship we can we can pour out our worship to this only one God I don't know if you sing this song here but we sing it a lot in our congregation You Are God Alone musicians know how to sing it we okay we'll try to sing it go something like this You Are God Alone from Before Time began and you were on your throne You Are God
