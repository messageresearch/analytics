and we ask you to just covering Lord and take care of it we believe you and we thank you have your way now and keep us in Jesus name Revelations one and in Revelation 7 so the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent them signified it by his Angel unto his servant John and by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand amen let's go to Revelations 7 where we're at this morning starting in verse 3 saying hurt not the Earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the Servants of our God and before he not his servants right does it save children because Israel has always been a quote to you and get it back later another one said it's always been the servant Nation that's right my servant Abraham it's always been that way all right now and I heard a number of them which were ceoed and there was sealed in 144 thousand of the tribes of the children of Israel or the tribe of Judah were still 12 000 the tribal Reuben were sealed twelve thousand of the tribal get we're still 12 000 of the tribe of Asher we're still 12 000 of the tribe of Nephilim were seal twelve thousand of the tribe of nasus were stealing twelve thousand of the tribal semian were sealed twelve thousand of the tribal Levi were sealed twelve thousand of the travel discuss our this car were sealed 12 000 of the tribe of Zebulon were sealed 12 000 of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand of The Tribe of Benjamin were sealed 12 000 and in the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated we have a few more of these coming so if you will just maybe a husband and wife or somebody close together take one until we can get the others are coming but they're having to print uh on color and that's a little slower with the printer all right now to try not to back up very much into this morning's message but to make sure that we understand and are following it perfectly in order we know that as we read in Revelation 7 and then we compared that with Genesis 35 and knowing that uh Jacob had 12 sons and their names are and then going over in the Book of Revelations we found that the tribe of Dan was missing over in Revelations seven all right and then in that tribe being missing we're wondering where it's at and you would say see some people hearing us not knowing the morning's message you say yeah but Dan and Eve from both tribes is missing there was a tribe of I'll leave for him until later on in the scriptures that we started dealing with now the original sons of God I mean sons of Jacob was listing down through there and Dan is within that group but Ephraim and Manasseh were the children of Joseph right all right if remember NASA were the children of Joseph they were not of the children of of Jacob and you're seeing that we're coming to do and to understand a a great thing in the word of God and uh trying to show you how perfect the word is and we had to take this drawing and redo a little bit because and seemingly everybody that had it Sister Barbara I think he had one they printed off some but in doing it they always had the wrong names in the wrong place but you know we are we tried to make them it's correctly one of my out of order that's all right but I want you to look at it because we ended up this morning talking about a very great secret thing and we saw the children of the Israel you know the your sons of Jacob they all went down to Egypt but all of the descendants of Jacob as far as the ones named are you listening like Dan like Joseph Benjamin Etc we read you the scripture there were Joseph died while down in Egypt they were there 400 years in Egypt all right and that way then all of these that we named here they would have been passed on right but you come out with a tribe in their name right so you're driving their night you know carrying the banner on and going and it would be called the tribe of Judah it would be called a tribal Benjamin but it's not talking about the original one of Benjamin because he's done by Stone all right it may not mean anything to you but it doesn't keep me up in the Bible right I know where you're at all right then we got up and we finished on how that they went down into Egypt they came out and when they came out there was 12 tribes all right but then when they get out in the wilderness and camp an amazing thing happens as they camp by that time Nana Ephraim was not missing because I asked you to look it up Dan and Heath Brothers not missing in the Old Testament listing of the children of Israel all right when he comes over the Book of Revelations all right now that's very important because of what God Said okay so then coming to where we were in numbers this morning we picked up the children of Israel after they had come out of Egypt and I was corrected while ago Africa is a continent and Egypt is in Africa I reckon you were calling the condiment no is that correct sister all right we keep it straight what I was saying this morning that there were a lot of Black Pharaohs because a lot of people don't believe that you go to your National Geographic and they'll tell you there were a lot of Black Pharaohs because they would go over and Conquer that from Africa the continent right next to them and they would make their own King you know but now when when Israel came out of Egypt we find them coming out with a correct order of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel but when they got out in the The Journey God is beginning to unfold his plan all right so we see as we were doing this morning so we want to cover these again to make sure that you understand so let's drop over to where we were of numbers should be number six all right this is when they were coming up out of Egypt huh he says it is what's your picture tents every man died on Camp and every man by their own standard throughout their host but the Levites shall pitch round about the Tabernacle of testimony stipulating God is and to Levites are now going to be removed from being called a tribe they're going to be placed into a position of to be the priesthood right all right so now they're removed and they're placed around the Tabernacle wow that there have been no wrath upon the congregation of children in Israel because that was God's way all right and the Levi's shall keep the charge of the Tabernacle of the testimony all right now we come up well let's go on through that into numbers I'm gonna pick up where we were this morning so then you look at your paper this is where they would come out and they would pitch and camp now remember before then you had Levi listed as one of the tribes now Levi's going to be removed from being a tribe he's not going to be numbered right with Israel an amazing thing that I remember other mystical and him they had done a study on the Levites and they claimed that some way that that Levites was the only tribe right now that they can prove of who it's trying to belonged to right now somebody remember that I did they said there was a somewhere DNA makeup right and set them aside that they can tell who is a Levi amen well they can't follow the other lines okay if that's true or not true I've I've said a lot of things and people come on later and say I didn't say that we'll get the Judgment one of these days and find out where they're all this was said or wouldn't say it right if it wasn't said I'd be happy it was said I'll be happy yeah okay either way but now look so you go to the east side toward the rising of the Sun and when you do you pick up Judah so if you look at your paper on the east side you pick up Judah never mind see what it is chew it up is everyone it's good East Side all right West Side Ephraim manasha Benjamin okay North is damn extra that's enough South is Reuben Simeon and Gad with the Levi in the middle to take care of the Tabernacle right all right now to handle all the Affairs of the Tabernacle in the doings is the Levi's order all right you said well now that winds up with 13 tribes see because you want to count Levi but now we went on in the scripture and we read this morning oh the enemy from it would be numbers 2 23 but the Levites which is where this was taken from that we're reading but the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel as the Lord commanded Moses right the Levites wasn't they wasn't number so you're staying with 12 all right yep you're staying with the 12 tribes okay the leave out is removed and placed in here for the ministry right okay now if you notice there Joseph is missing he's not on your drawing I'll read it in a minute we'll run around and said there was never to have been a travel Junction right he said well you got to put everybody on that swallowing here on Earth we called in the Millennium you won't have the tribal Joseph listed see you'll keep a perfect order all right so you got 13 tribes now listening okay now what did Brother round say we read it and go ahead and pull that one up brother that's how we pick up that part right there and go on 269 on the 2 Chainz book you can't get it off a number pull up 10 that'll jump up 269. look what your profit say now before we pursue this daughter Judas let's go back to the Old Testament see where God did the same thing judas's name remember was removed from The Book of Life okay in Genesis 35 26 23-26 the sons of Jacob were 12 in number and their names were his fathers Reuben Simeon Levi Judah is Evelyn not Joseph Benjamin Dan Napa Gat and Asher all right now here's your original 12. okay with Joseph in the middle no Dan I mean no law a day in his garbage I know dealing with instruments in Menasha because that's not the time I will look these 12 sons descended descendants became the 12 tribes of Israel with the exception that Joseph did not have a tribe named after in him you know after him that was not to be original for in the Providence what is Providence God's way of doing things working it's going to be this way right of God there were to beat 13 tribes now in Joseph's two sons were given the honor of bringing the 12 to 13. you know of course that this was necessary as Levi was separated under God for the priesthood okay that would have been the 13 tribes you wouldn't have one listed for Joseph and you wouldn't really have Levi listed because he's the priesthood as I said this morning then he said what about Joseph Joseph was the type of Christ that's right so then you'd have the children of Israel camping yep three on each side you know for the 12. leave out in the middle and Joseph being the top of Christ go to Levi was to handle the word he was not the word right he was the handle alert right Joseph would be the Christ all right now so you follow that lineman that's when they left Egypt and God gave them a Tabernacle in the wilderness now that's not the building but that's when they made the tent yeah right yes later on it's when they built the building okay everybody with me we find it to try to Levi ministering to 12 tribes May Reuben Simeon it's a car Judaism Benjamin Dan nothing again action Ephraim and the national all right roll it up you drop back and you'll see some things in order of the host that was dust in numbers there is no mention of Joseph in Levi when we look at Revelation 7 4-8 that we read and you'd find no mention of Dan and Ephraim right see as this happened here to make 13 that God put in Ephraim and Manasseh Joseph's two children to make 13 tribes that in Revelations we see Ephraim we find Dan and Ephraim missing right okay with Joseph and Levi put back in right right now think about it a minute and you'll see we'll go into why they were deleted but this is the point I want you to cover as you see once they did come to Revelations Dan and Ephraim will be missing in that part because see they lost now I hope you understand this wording and I hope God understands what I'm saying and I'm sure he does but I won't be satisfied with the way I said once you come to the Book of Revelation you have known levitical priesthood the children of Israel at this time don't have a levitical priesthood you understand me they got a Levi but no levitical priesthood yep that's what you're working on they don't have a high priest they might know whose tribe is who that's why I run around said they can't figure it out they might try to figure it out but they don't have a priest with it when you come to Book of Revelations they had rejected the priesthood not only did Dan and Ephraim go after the golden cage the children of Israel went after everything else right right and they lost their priesthood now here's a quote if you want it I'll give it to you later he said thus we see them coming out of the jewel in the middle coming out and said they had their tribes with denial priesthood so you know how the priesthood down to that you don't have a high priest right after the destroying of the temple right right when they destroyed the children of Israel Rome came in destroyed them from that time on down you don't have a high priest because you don't have a ruling levitical priesthood right you have as the Bible says everybody doing what they think is right in their own eyes trembling over there trying to figure out Who belongs to who right right so you see when you come up and numbers and you come over to the campaign of the children of Israel that we showed you the drawing after they lost that I know how priesthood now you think what you won't do and I'm going to say run around and say it if you don't honor your messenger God will remove his lamp stand right amen you didn't remove the message of the lights down that's only for those who want to hold on but you lost your lampstand the messenger is not here to correct you right yeah I'll have that dope in my face what can we do because the prophet's not here to straighten it out I said the word is amen amen and what he preached is of course you know what he said that's your idea yeah but listen Church if we don't honor that lampstand ing in the correct way which means father what he said his lampstand is removed from you and I right right and look around the message and see that's right they've lost their priesthood why because they're correcting him yep and would that be something to go up to the high priest yeah thank you bruh that's right I mean you're an Israelite and you're smarter and you go trumping into the high priest just remember he had guards just remember it was not the Roman guards that captured Jesus it was the Israeli guards that capture Jesus go read your Bible Romans didn't take him to Calvary they had to finally give the okay and nailed him to a tree but it was the Israeli guards because they guarded the captain the priesthood so it wouldn't be something walk in there that high priest don't talk to you you wouldn't do much talking you know I hope we understand that boy we reject this high priest priesthood I'm not calling right around my high priest but why can't we call it now all right amen but that's going as Jesus what I mean you just lost yet that's right you just turned it down you just lost your messenger we don't believe it was God look God used it man that's right do you turn him down you turn God damn right right amen okay but in the Providence of God that was originally in God's mind he had a plan yep the hell not as I said this morning just Joseph Stanley bowing before Joseph he had a plan to come out of it with the 12 tribes of Israel and Levi in the midst the ministry and Joseph would be a type of Christ because the prophet we just read that was run out to been one right nope Dan made these things happen right Ephraim International must have been put in right to make it come out 13 right but Dan and ibram Ephraim was not in God's plan to remove them they removed themselves right okay amen so can we right right all right so then we find him this pull it back up my little drawing the count of Israel so we find this showing it beautifully what God wanted and have they remained with that priesthood you and I wouldn't be here right right it ain't down in Eastern's fault you know is the children of Israel's fault right you know you know what they should have done when Dan and Ephraim went after the golden pass now that is not the golden guy of Moses get that separated I made them two guys one put in Bethel One somewhere else and under durable woman you'll find it in a minute we'll read it just ain't wanted to happen if that happened to us you would have had perfect order and walked right into the Millennium right it was not in God's Providence either but we blame Dan and Ephraim as I said this morning go back sometime and read a little bit about Reuben and how he went into Joseph's concubine no no right it wasn't too good of a guys you know what we call them today to kind of Trigger Happy you remember the fellas that come in and took one of the daughters one day and you know leg withered oh they were deceiving Jacob didn't want him to kill him oh okay we'll take care of it Jacob you tell them they got to be circumcised well that old boy can marry her sister run when they got through what happened well they were so sore they couldn't fight they went in and killed them you ain't talking about too good of a nice guys okay so don't blame Dan and Ephraim that's just an example but look at the camp now right that you see you see Dan still listening will it leave out in the middle all Russia I'm still in order come on you see Ephraim and Manassa put in and bring it up to 13. or you can pull that out God if I don't get to it I'll do it later I'm not in no hurry see when we finish and we get to the gates of the city you're only going to have 12 gates oh yeah amen you're right yep well it's going to be the name of them 12 gates good I don't mind telling you ahead of time where you can read it it's going to be the original 12 children of Jacob and Ephraim and the national won't have a gate named after them so God can put in and take out and move anytime he wants to it all right do we have our name taken out it's taken out forever right right so we're not following what we read was originally been 13 tribes Joseph did not have a tribe named after him that's what I tried to get you to see the Bible is so perfect amen you don't list tribes until you get on over in the scripture all right yep they were not the tribes of the Israel that went to Egypt they were the children of Jacob and Jacob and them died down there and they came out their children oh Jacob the children of Reuben and then you started to monitoring the story of God doing what he wanted to do make 13 tribes put to leave out in the middle and handle the rest all right would you see him over in Revelation as you see them in Revelations we only see him in NASA put in the place of Dan because Ephraim and manasseha were not the children of Jacob God can do what he wants to again amen right why was Dan then taken out and Ephraim was taken out too why was he taken out right three go ahead remember 13 brother trying to jump a little number 13 which is 81.99 of the seventh seal I want you to watch real close and read with me for a minute here's something that maybe you never noticed in the tribal calling I told you a while ago to read revelation 7. read with me and watch those those tribes in Revelation 7 Dan and Ephraim is missing and not numbered with them did you notice that Joseph and Levi was substituted in their place remember they lost the priesthood come on you notice that Dan and Ephraim is not dark no sir but Joseph and Levi were substituted in the place of Dan and Ephraim why would I done that remember God remembers never promises his word right he remembers or promised him but he remembers his curses why is Dan missing and then we'll see the Ephraim goes out too go to the next one I got 203 seventh seal remember this is in the seventh seal because he's on the background you got for the seventh seal right but this is happening under the Sixth Seal right then I need for Eminem and then put it in is doing it under the Sixth Seal come on all right 203 and we'll go through 205 I think now if you watch I want you to read with me now go order Deuteronomy the 20th 29th verse the 29th chapter really there is a reason for these tribes not being there everything has got a reason for it Deuteronomy right we go to it we're going to take the 29th chapter of the Deuteronomy now the Lord shall help us that we can understand that you want to start Deuteronomy 29th chapter at the 16th verse like Moses speaking or you know right now more you know we have dealt in the land of Egypt and how we come through the Nations which we pass by and yet I've seen the Abominations and the rivals the woods the stones of silver this is the warning right which was among them it wouldn't hurt a little something you know a little statue of sanctions either way you know you don't like that lest therefore lest there be lest there should be among you a man woman or family or tribe whose heart turned away this day from the Lord Our God to go and serve the god through these nations let's nurse should be among you a root that bear call and wormwood and it come to pass when he heard the words of this curse and that he bless himself in his heart and say I have peace go walk into imagination of my own heart I want you see people say oh He blesses himself you know like a little Frost or something like you know you see the same thing you see it's a heated tray and it's a heathens He blesses himself in his own heart in his own imagination his own mind you know what we say oh I'm in the message bless the Lord oh my soul on him the message wonderful is the message in US you have a question all right message to them it's gonna go after this joke see that drunkenness is hers yesterday it'll make any difference as long as you go to church you're all right I didn't say that if you're running your prophets you understand well brother then we're at church every time sir good choice the devil he beats you here because I generally get here for most of them the Lord will not spare him but then the anger of the Lord what his jealousy is going to smoke against that man of all the curses that are written in this book don't take one word from it add one to it see shall laugh on him and the Lord shall block his name out his name from under the heaven that's why they cure on Earth see under the heaven now remember as we talk about Dan and Ephraim being removed I have already said we will read where they're put back in right their name is blotted out under Heaven not in heaven if it's blotted out in heaven they cannot return right yep right that's right right amen all right and the Lord shall separated to them evil out of the tribes of Israel according to all of the curses all right now let's go on over 15. right up to 11 7 seal now I'm trying to do this God have a name did you notice in the church Yankees the same base that serves the image of the of dead people so poor trying to brought out the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we have Towers his father son Holy Ghost same thing with that curse behind it like that nearly from just did just that under a hypocritical king in Israel an imposter yep what happened notice in First Kings and 12th chapter background and said we can depend on enduroboam chicken and the man of Ephraim and dwelt there and went out in two and built in Europe and now if you're a born say it unto in his heart see the imagination is hard that's the other king who turned to the House of David he gerb on wanted to pull away the people from the David remember the kingdom was divided at one time right and one time it was divided two tribes and ten tribes David was over the ten Dearborn was over the two in his arm if I let him go to Jerusalem to worship and David went over now Luke's my kingdom so what does he do he's getting scared how many people might go out it's just people go up sacrificing the house the Lord in Jerusalem then show the heart of these people be turned again to the Lord even too real for him King Judah and he said kill me and the rib Odom that's when it was divided into the David and durable foreign behold your gods amen but no big money yeah there is no God's beside you with him all Israel which brought thee out of the land of Egypt he said the one in Bethel you know they're putting down this thing they're going to sin and the people went to worship before they won even today you see why Dan and Ephraim is going to be removed or was removed they went after worshiped in a false god I would have been a little smarter I wouldn't have wanted a golden calf a dog or a cat or a horse why would you say that running down because this is after what happened with the children of Israel was the first golden calf you remember Moses in the golden guy right and all them people got took up in about 250 priests went in the ground all kind of things happen right I killed him see he's running at Bethel and Dan they said the finals these went out and worshiped this and here we are from down into the Millennium age almost record that word and God still remember that sin go to Revelation 7 is almost in the Millennium Revelation 7 is not the millennium right come on you're not even considered in that amen glory I surely remembers it never good promise he remembers ever evil too you always stayed with it what happened we go after Jezebel our name fully removed right we don't have no hopes they set up their idols Dan and Ephraim went to worship these animals God removed our name now I want you to think sensibly their names and their tribes are still today they are not listed in the 12 tribes which are listed as the children of Israel let me quit calling the name Dan or did it all right it's Monday thought you got knowledge right I can find that quote if you want it but everybody said they thought they got violated Dan and Ephraim went over our worshiping boy they haven't even a big time I talked to God by the way I like the people of this message turning against the message now that's right preaching right around was wrong here wrong guard this wrong guy was wrong you know because God don't strike a day Edition I must be something special just remember we'll read it in a minute when he said to Moses Moses said now if you're going to plot their name out take my nap he said go on Moses take him to the land but he said when the time comes I'll deal with them right right they went to the land but he said I'll deal with it Lord are you with me not like all these things almost in the millennium and God remembers I'm sitting down to me for instance as I said this morning I keep saying it you show me in the Bible where Dan and Eva Ephraim was taken out in the Old Testament their names deleted or a trial destroyed they want to run home but God remembers right but remember the key in what we read in one verse ahead or one mentioned it under Heaven look at 16. I got 220 and I notice did you notice here it was he brought it out why under heaven I'm not gonna be blinded out in heaven brought it out under heaven under Heaven there was no immediate sacrifice they could give them the Holy Spirit they'll even see these things we did anyhow in his own selfish mind now watch but Ezekiel in his vision in the millennium he sees them in perfect order if you want to read it let's put it down you can read it Ezekiel 48 1-7 he said let's read it when I think about it as we read it I think about the story there bro the children of Israel come down doing their Journey they were only the 12. Sons of Jacob they come out of Egypt as the children of Israel not children of Israel they can't and they each one came to Levi's in the middle and they travel through the Journey of life thinking they're all right because God just didn't zap remember that's called language but it's true they thought they got by with it you see them all over even until now trying to figure out what tribe they're on right but you see God in his remembrance and Revelations bringing in the Plan of Redemption to Israel and he leaves Dan and Ephraim out and he puts Joseph in Levi back into place knocked out 13 tribes bring it back to 12 for a reason because see they're under heaven and he said I'll blot his name out in heaven you'll go into what I ask you to read in the church age book from about 265 to 285 you'll find this explained over and over and over are the removal of a name I'm setting up and what happens all right now let's go to Ezekiel so when we come into the Millennium now we're in the Book of Revelation 7 Book of Revelation 7 Dan and ephraim's out right but in the millennium you remember the other day verse Heaven first and Earth has passed away verse Heaven is the millennium first Earth is now well Israel is on Earth they got an opportunity amen and I hope you caught what I said there's 14 tribes in the tribulation period not just 12. and they're put in there for purging not only is the 12 tribes going to be purged the 24 000 that we talked about this morning are purged in the tribulation amen okay because they'll eventually see it because they're promised to come back right not every Israelite there's Millions over there now that God's going to take 144 thousand right amen do you want to deal with that other 24 too so watch what happens in the millennium to win a millennium you find them man in the borders let's see East Side under the west side Look What You've Got look what you start off with these are the sides East and West Dan all right look that's your drawing man now I'll tell you it may be on the wrong Northeast South and West oh that does change in the Book of Numbers I do know my scripture all right that's right I used to preach on that because when they when they camped one way but when they leave out to travel they don't travel exactly right because you gotta have your line the Optima and The Eagle right until they move out a little different so many days I'll preach on look at what we got in the Millennium you got Dan yep Asher Neptune yep Menasha yep Ephraim Reuben Judah okay okay now let me make sure you there's a pause right in the middle what do we get down to Ephraim Reuben Judah verse 7. all right now where are we going to you gotta get out I left it out me verse 13 love should be in there verse 13. and over against the border of the priest where's the priest now the Millennium right back in the middle yep he gets his Duty but he doesn't own anything right no Levi owns anything he eats off of the other right right we don't own nothing I Don't Preach for a living come on God is my inheritance Don't Preach related you ever get that dog in your mind I'll just try to give you a little money like we will Christmas how many churches that Christmas will give away about eight thousand dollars through the congregation you know of any I like to go evil me I guess a couple of bucks anyway not throwing off on nobody just showing you what I mean I believe a priest should live by the gospel if you don't have any hair inheritance I ain't got no Swift bank account I'm going to live off the gospel okay but to Levi she'll have five and twenty thousand in the land he's got a place drawn out take your little drawing and look he's right back in the middle right then it starts back again what verse 23 to pick up your order again come on then you pick up let's see border of Judah Benjamin and remember you dropped me Benjamin back in so don't prank your two see Miss Judah Benjamin Simeon there's a car Zebulon yeah no that's the inheritance right and the children of Israel comes to a great wonderful thing to see how God keeps his word amen that's right when you come to the gates that's what I said Ezekiel don't just cover the millennial layout that's right Ezekiel covers no Millennial Temple that's right go ahead and rub it up notice though what's your names now this is in the gates of the city you only have 12 gates okay yeah so the city shall be after the names of the tribe of Israel three gates northward one day of Reuben Judah and Levi yep in the millennium levitical priesthood is going to be in the middle and when you walk out just about the city and look around you're gonna find one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 but what Gates name to the tribe of Israel right one get Reuben one get Judah one day Levi then you jump over what do you get one get Joseph he's back in he gets okay nothing right Benjamin and Dan the dirty guy he gets a gate South Side Simeon escar Zeppelin damn it again Asher Smith he's only 12 names of the 12 gates that's the original children that's right it works perfect amen amen the original children of Jacob yep I cannot place them I'm just an honest I could take his word he said in Revelations 14 you find them in perfect order Revelation 14 doesn't list the order you know you won't pull that up just in case you don't understand it that would be uh number 21. okay and this covers the other part remember Revelation 14 John sees them again in tribal order that's right every time through its place what happened you remember he said under the heavens that his name would be blotted out of the tribal Affair as long as he was under the heavens there would be no there would be no more and this 144 000 is down here in tribal order down here and when you come to 14 you're a dire that's right what you see they're blinded they got all of their sacrifice of bulls and go and notice he brought them out under the heavens with the Gentiles of the days of the Holy Spirit he blotted out totally right this is I said want to go read your quote word in the tribulation he put some tribes in there you notice Israel took it never an Israelite could be purged in a tribulation but God knows it ain't gonna do it so he went ahead and said it on to be 144 000. but we don't know that he's already saying this 144 000 plus 24 times some were right where they gonna get their purging right man in the tribulation well if you'll notice in in Moses it says remember when he was talking let me get let me just read this message about using them okay so Deuteronomy tells him that but he said under heaven you know that in Exodus 32 and 32. when Moses said blot me out God says him will I blot out of my book come on we better run nothing go 20 number 28. dude we better do that because your question please thou Wilt forgive her sin if not block me I pray thee out of that book was nice written the Lord said unto the Moses whosoever stand up against me damn will I blot out of my book right is that scripture correct you know the same account is told in Deuteronomy in order Deuteronomy I'm this is the same account of Moses in Exodus make them to me now you know if she ain't seen these people the oldest stiff neck people let me alone I'm going to destroy you and block their names from under heaven Moses what do you know sounds like an exodus you're saying and God says he have got their name down and you know he will when Deuteronomy is being told Deuteronomy says Moses even says it or God said demoted let me alone and I may destroy them and brought out their name from under heaven Moses would have called that he knows what's going on right right God said I'll blow them out under heaven but he says in Exodus I'll blot him out to some names are blotted out of the book and never can be put back some of those Israelites that day got their name removed brought it totally out but some would mod it out under heaven and their name remained I'm reading scriptures I'm not taking quotes okay see how easily it can be misunderstood blood out his name from under heaven I'll end with this one we have the same right today in the church at 284 the church age books hard to eat in church a names are going to be blooded out of The Book of Life no names will be blotted out of the book of eternal life that's right for that is another record though contain in The Book of Life you know what I love is the last one Revelation 3 and 5 he that overcometh the same shall be clothed about Raymond and I will not blot out his name out of The Book of Life now we'll get to it Sunday I mean yeah next Sunday you know that the foolish virgin's name is in the book of mine sure amen that's right not in the lounge Book of Life and you know their names will remain in The Book of Life or else that can't be foolish virgins how perfect is the word you said we need this we need that okay maybe we don't I just love to know how perfect God's word is amen that he tells me a promise and I can defend them yeah amen that's right I hope you understand what I've just went through covering how names could be written removed under heaven but not in heaven they're removed in heaven they're gone completely the Israel while they're on Earth Dan and Ephraim Revelation 7 is left out God can't have his Providence then he started out back there with in the children of Israel with the 13 tribes he drops back to 12. but in the Millennium it'll be 13 tribes again and Dan and Ephraim will be right in there because they sinned on Earth and God said I'll block their names out under heaven perfect Bible amen but the gates of that City will have 12 names the original names of the children of Jacob yep how perfect can the word be right that's right so beautiful we're staying together brother get ready for that communion make it on these things he keeps his promise could you stand all afternoon for us to read the promises of God amen amen correct the Bible says his promises are yay and amen which means he can't break them that's right and we'll find out next Sunday if you don't believe I don't believe it it's not for me even a heathen who knows nothing about the Eternal Gods as we take or God he worships a total Pope they're up a dog or a cat or an alligator or something he's got to have faith in that and you know what those those people now they have some high priests they get up and tell the congregation how great it came you know that element with her and them Islamic countries as they die in a holy war they get to go to heaven and they get 70 virgins well you know what that's in the mind of those people we say that's silly what is your dependence well if this don't work I guess we can do something else this has done the work before to take care of it now that's right I hope you follow me First Corinthians 11 23.
