brother Dale took up an offering that'd be the biggest often whatever God Terrence Terrence said it was a small list the smallest offering we ever had to pass the lucci right in the face I mean man come on now I really did I really he was kind of slow you know he was kind of fly through there you know sometimes sometimes you know you miss people there doing this but boy when you go slow and you look people in the face and you go that happened in the church the long time went well a while back a preacher now don't need that preacher did that and he quit going to church that's the truth he said a preacher ain't supposed to take up offering so he just quit the church I mean he didn't just make a statement he quit the church so anyway so whatever if you don't show up next Sunday we'll know our Wednesday finisher Wednesday then we'll know he got mad at Lois just get mad Louise don't you manage the rest everybody else you get mad Louise we're good to be here god bless y'all good to see you house full of good-looking people remember mother's days next Sunday and momma wants to remind us of something else for hon oh that is correct I'm sorry brother John called me if between services and your member brother John would and sister my sister my passed out today and they took her to one he was calling me and I guess as they were taking him to her to the next hospital but they didn't they couldn't stabilize her one Hospital so they were rushing her to another hospital so let's just keep remember brother John and sister Violet said over here that was with us that we sure appreciated them being with us well that he called from Virginia and said to please have the whole church praise so as we when we pray we'll just continue lifting her up and until find out not to find out what's wrong with her they'll find out what's right with her amen and that God will move on the scene and and do what he said he would do all right all right so we remember to then the fellowship meeting will be the next Saturday and also June just keeps us in you in your on your calendar June 16 17 and 18th when we're all going to the guys are going to late to go we got four cabins to accommodate 32 people so they're all air-conditioned we've got we can fish and we're gonna have some good food and good fellowship so just keep us in your prayers so also remember that so if you got your Bible we're going to review today but I want to read this one scripture just kind of put the bait on the hook because remember we're we're finished with the six seals and now we're entering into number seven and the Seventh Seal there was a a brother that watches in online he he talked to dad myself about and I hadn't I kind of knew that but if you'll if you'll watch on the Seventh Seal listen to brother branham he's really on all the other seals he's like spot on there when he gets to that Seventh Seal remember he preached it and then the next day he wasn't happy with it so he goes back to the motel room for brother Maguire and brother fred sauceman was and he redid part of the seventh seal because he wasn't happy with the with the first part of it and i think we'll kind of understand that as we go through it because remember their silence in heaven for the space of a half an hour so he said nothing's going on nothing's being revealed so we'll get into that but let's let's review the six seals first let's bow our heads remember sister Maya the Lord Jesus we thank you today Lord for giving us another opportunity to be here to stand before the absolute absolute greatest people that ever live a little face of this earth is the bride of Jesus Christ and we pray that you just bless them today Lord give them supernatural revelation or just keep us all attentative of what's going on father we pray that you would be the active participant in this service because if you do then somebody will get something out of what's being said Lord we pray that you just forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make Lord against you Lord just keep us in your will be with sister my Lord whatever that situation is we we call on the Holy Spirit to go there in Virginia and settle that situation Lord and be her brother John also and and as he he spoke very nervously on the phone and and you know that's that's his love so Lord he's a little bit he's a little bit has a little bit of fear Lord we pray that you just take him out of that that you were just give him supernatural strength and let him see look to you father the author and finisher of our faith Lord just be with each one leading got us by your Holy Spirit be with brother Ernie Lord as we were reading this text a little while ago being over there in the Philippines Lord hadn't been there in a long time so we pray this you just give him super not strength and let him say Lord something that will help the people be with us now and take care of us be with the other missionaries on the foreign fields Lord give them fruit for their labor granite Lord we pray these things in Jesus name Amen John 19 verse 30 says when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up to go you may be seated in Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now that's not going to have anything to do with what we're going to talk about right now but that's going to be part of what we're going to talk about in this 7th seal now to just background a little bit on that just let's be careful that remember people have made them and we're just going to talk today I maintain raised my voice the the seventh seal has been talked about it's open it's not open its polygamy it's two strolls it's a great revelation that nobody knows which that I believe it's a revelation that they don't know okay if you say the seals are not open then you're exactly correct to you because you've closed them and then I believe the seals are open I believe where we're living in an open book age because we see revelations 10 that that mighty angel came down from heaven with a book that was open and he came down what to give it to us so the book is open John didn't need a closed book he eat an open book alright so that book is open so when you hear somebody say that I believe the seals are closed are not open yet just agree with them and then tell them say well maybe to you they're not but to me they've been open okay maybe it'll spark a little interest I don't know we'll see that we know we're coming to a great hour now to where to where we are it's gonna be just like the Lord you know we're gonna be almost by herself here toward the end the Lord Jesus never was popular he was the seventh seal still is the seventh co say was but him being the seventh seal he was a great mystery when he was the greatest mystery that ever stepped foot on the face of this earth is that God Almighty could be in human flesh and die for your sins but the great part that we see we are a beneficiary brother Branham says of that because he resurrected come back on the day of Pentecost inside to believer so that makes us the benefactor are the beneficiary of what he did so in being the beneficiary of what he did then I'll just give you a key we were talking downstairs just a little bit because brother Brown said the seals are Christ amen it is the complete book of Redemption and it's Christ revealed to me and you all right so what is one of the great mysteries is brother brems preach Christ is the mystery of God revealed so now I want to ask you a question where's Christ where's Christ I am think boy y'all have y'all have really we haven't been here a while so we are Christ if not then we're another form or we're a begotten of a begotten which makes us a grandchild are we've got a second person of a Trinity somewhere see how we are we can't be if you're if you have Christ in you then you are the mystery and you must be revealed because that's what the end time that's what the Seventh Seal is to me is the coming of the Lord but now it's not the coming of the Lord physically he doesn't come physically it's the coming of the Lord in you physically and a group of people called a bride so we want to keep these things counted in the back of their mind and remember to when Jesus was when Jesus there said it is finished now when Jesus said it's finished he died the body didn't move until Sunday morning but was something going on hey man there was something going on as soon as that body as soon as that soul left that body he went straight to hell start the preaching to the souls in prison going to paradise now paradise so when Jesus said it is finished as far as we see and as far as what happened on the surface of the earth nothing happened Jerusalem went right on doing the same thing they were doing they had their Passover which fell on that Sabbath that made it a high Sabbath that's why they had to get Jesus off the cross before 6 o'clock because remember Jewish days begin at 6 o'clock p.m. that's why Jesus died on Friday before the sixth o'clock they had to get him off the cross and put him in a tomb because Saturday they didn't do anything that was their Sabbath all right but we know something the greatest thing that ever happened went on he went to hell preach to them locked him back up where they were he come up through paradise picked them up took them up come back down and brought his body out of a tomb all right so there was a lot went on when that silence in heaven for the space of half an hour I believe something is going on and then because remember God is never silent there's always something going on all right so just remember that when we see when we come to that next Sunday something is happening so if you will let's turn to revelation 6 and let's let's just kind of review I know what you know we've started this in February a year ago so we've been on this for a while and sometimes you know you lose we're all human beings we we lose some of the points so I just want to bring out some of the points if that's all right that's what I said today we'll just kind of we're just gonna gonna be vanilla and and just try to get everybody back on the same page because it's a Seventh Seal doesn't open then Christ doesn't come but we know that he says he's coming back and he's is coming back in the bride so we know it's open its open to somebody there the seals have been open to somebody and that's you know what sister Johnny you just got to say that's me every one of you says that's me I'm the one cuz listen we're in this church age right here and you're being in this church age right here this is one two three four five six seven and buy okay while are you doing that just maybe pray for sister Magan why just they're just so dear people good grief that's good people enjoyed them being here amen alright so now let's talk about this for a minute revelation six let's start and then when I and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard it was the noise of thunder now we'll get into that a little while but not right now one of the four beasts said come and see and I sell and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a white head bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer now pay attention that these things work crown was given unto him and new as we see later on that he is given power it is a permitted power you and I have power when the Holy Ghost comes upon us that's what the Bible says you now have power once that the Holy Ghost come upon us but the devil can't get the Holy Ghost so he don't have any power the only power he has is the power we give him amen I mean that great little powerful scripture that says resist the devil and he'll flee from you that's pretty powerful but it's so simple just resist him and he'll flee from you all right so now remember we saw that the horse was white it was a white righteous church that came out in the in the first three Church ages well I got him right here so this is seal one two three and four this is the seven churches we went through this I'm just gonna go through it again then all right the man's okay just a little refresher course then we're gonna take communion and I hope somebody put warm water in that communion water who got the communion water thank yous I don't ever let 95 let's do it again Lord we were all up here I thought we got a revival which speaking in tongues we put her feet in that water and it was like 32 degrees we had to bust the ice to get in and I thought where did you get that water Oh anyway anyway and Robert squealed lucky baby whoo there you go hey squeal lucky I was watching his feet he's putting feet wet so thank God we got warm water today thank you brother Zach I appreciate that bless your heart you and you and brother Josiah all do a good job get all the good good good brothers brother little brother John back that team and I saw him beheld a white horse so this white horse remember he was a bluff he was a white horse so he didn't start out in a barroom he started out in a church he got in the church he got in the church the first church which was a white righteous church amen they had everything right they had all the they had all the no denomination all the doctrines that we hear now and then then all this other stuff it came from that wild horse rider guy that got in the church ages and started polluting everything amen but he did it under the auspice are under the power of a white righteous church and you know what Satan not the barroom today's right here so he's still trying to get in that white righteous church amen so there was a white righteous church that started on the day of Pentecost right here on the day of Pentecost and for the first three ages they had a pure word the Lion of the tribe of Judah the lion the lion one of the four beasts the first beast was lying not lying lion they were bold but now Satan also came in and he rode right beside that white righteous church and he actually got inside that white righteous church hey man because that first Street Church ages there was no Trinity there was no father son Holy Ghost baptism sure they were sayings those things I didn't cover because there you should know that because anything starts to the saying I mean I can wish for something sister Rebeka here by the time it gets to that it ain't nothing I said you ever played that before yeah well it won't be nothing because they'll have about 85 interpretations by the time he gets back up to here right so that's the same way it was with with Satan he goes in with a saying but they didn't they didn't cut it completely off it kind of reminds me that when Joshua went into the Promised Land you know God told him he said destroy them all but they left a few that was a few of this at left and a few of that and they always had trouble with that few that they'd allowed they would have just killed them all they wouldn't have no problem with them right same way with demons and things that we that if we need to kill them if you get oh if they kill them they don't resurrect amen so we look in the first three Church ages that they let that thing in that white horse that white horse with the guy sitting on it which is Satan started riding through the church ages and then the first buck the end of the third church age about the Nicene council what happened it's not just a it's not just a saying it becomes a deed then it becomes a doctrine then it become incarnate into people all right so like brother Dale has been talking about you know four is four is not a bad number four is four is always the number of restoration because you had your line ox man and eagle so you had four horse riders that went out and you had four combat beasts to combat those riders all right so four it's not a bad number when you use it that way it's earthly number which is fine but listen if we don't have you can have justification st. catching baptism of the Holy Ghost that's fine but if you don't have the word incarnate you're not going to like a body change and then that's what we're heading toward here so we look now we see to that in Revelation six we see this white horse and him that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he warn't went forth conquering and to conquer but also we remember on the flipside of all this that we saw that if this is the and I'm saying if for your for your purpose this is a book of redemption not a book of the devil it's a book of redemption it's how you and I come to be fully redeemed body spirit and soul that's what the seven seals are for no more no less all right so that's okay to learn it the wild horse riders the Antichrist but that was the seal that had the thing sealed if you'll remember back when I started this whole thing we started with the paper because remember that book in Revelations 5 is not a book that book in Revelation is 10 it's not a book not that's not a book it's not a book it's the scroll this is what they used to make books out of they make books out of like what we were talking about here and there was a seal on that that had it sealed well the wine horse riders the Anti Christ was the seal that had all that good stuff written down inside of it you can see that run but you see what's written in there but you can't make out what it says you can't read circles but when the seal was broke off in 1963 when that bit took a profit it took a profit from God to get the revelation from God to tell us that that seal is the Antichrist and then the seal went off and then this opened up so that you can see what's inside of it now everybody wants to go with the seal well we know the seal that's that's the seals the Antichrist and that's the opening of the seal no that's not the opening of the seal that's the tearing off of the seal the opening is what's underneath because that nothing to do with Redemption just knowing that the wild horse rider was the Antichrist part of it but not all of it what will your Redemption is is what's written on the inside what was previously not shined on if you'll remember the if you'll remember the vision that brother Branham had about the about the pyramid where he whipped the top off and he looked down in there now now look most people this is the way they see that vision is the brother Ram took the took the top off the pyramid and wrote something inside of it could they try to make him same say all kinds of different things but he didn't say that he said I looked and there was something written inside the pyramid that light had never shined on it wasn't that he was writing something new it was already in there it was just now light was shining on it and he could read when he said so that was to me that's the opening of the seals the opening the seal just to open the word up so that we can plainly see what it is that it's redemption it's your redemption in my Redemption we went all the way through six seals and we come up to the sixth seal and it even shows the redemption of the earth we discovered that the redemption of the earth so I want to go through this real slow that we will get it make sure that that we see the types because you're going to see a lot of times that let's think about this last night we were talking about interval last time we were we were speaking and you take you take a play in the acts of a play you got your actors and you've got all the things on the stage and then they close the curtain they change the scene bring out another scene and there's an interval in there and then they open the curtain back up same thing happened to this seal number one was closed they opened up the property God was here he pulled the curtain back said hey here seal number one well they had to they had to close back up so they could get everybody off the stage and get the second church age or get the second seal back on the stage because if you'll remember brother Branham says this is an act of a play an act of a play well I want to tell you something this is not just an act of a plate this is a vision that you and I are in brother Brown said this is not real he said this is really not the real you remember he said you know the the the ones he hugged over in the sixth dimension they're more real than we are so this is a part of God that we do have to remember there's no redemption in the sixth there's no redemption in the sixth dimension they're already redeemed there's no redemption in heaven nobody needs redemption up there there's definitely no redemption in hell so where's redemption right here redemption happens in these first Street life flattened matter this is where we get redeemed okay redemptions not in heaven redemption happens on the earth so that's one of the seals that's why brother Brown said that thunder sounded on the earth they sound here right here where we're at today so under this first seal we see a white righteous horse or a white righteous man riding along throwing out his doctrine but then we also see that we see that word justification now justification is what chopping off your past sins this makes you white alright so that's the way we typed it and we see the type of justification because what is justification a part of Redemption you must keep these words going right because that's the plan of redemption are the play of redemption you whichever one you want to call it is it's the acts of a play because really in God's mind were already redeemed really and got really listen the Bible's already told us those who he's justified he's already glorified so what are we in we're in acts of a play we got to make our probably got to go out and do our part and once we get our part done we leave we go into another dimension and God watch this plays off but we got to see then like brother Dale was talking about the other day justification in its baby form is that your check your past sins are chopped off now in the seals that's not true as so much as that because justification is not sure we have to ask God to forgive us of our sins every day right but those things we used to do we should not be telling asking God to forgive us of those things that we used to do all right we ask God to forgive us because of the wrong thoughts and the wrong things that we do as far as humanity but when we come to this justification brother Branham said it was as if you never done it you're heading toward a a part of you to see that the real you didn't do it to start with is that Alright said I don't to thrill your heart that order through your heart that we come to a place that we know that we know that we know that we did not do those things amen in other words that just is a vapor it just went away it's not in God's mind so it's not so what sins are you talking about somebody ought to write a song about then wow you'll get it in a minute some of you will okay but justified justified you have not done it in the first place justified you know the song there all right somebody did write one about them but see that's what this justification is this justification is not chopping off your big your big sins it's it's it's a continuation of going on that God is what God is not telling you you're going to be redeemed he's telling you you already are redeemed okay this justification is telling you now the first baby form justification remember you get justified and you still have that old man inside of you that made you do that that's why justification is not the new birth justification is part of salvation and if you were to die suddenly like the people in the cross different things God could not judge you for any of your past sins because you don't have any hey you don't have any amen but that's under baby form justification because the person in there that did it is still there that old nature that all fallen nature is still attached to you making you do the things you used to do now that's still a journey as brother Dale's preaching I'm glad he's bringing this in because it helps us all to see where we are wewe got to know where we are take a refresher course you know just like now we're taking a refresher course of our salvation and then you can be able to say Amen or owe me one of the two I hope y'all say Amen but some are gonna say Oh me and that's okay that you say Oh me because to realize that you need more and that's all of our job is to make you realize you need more okay you need more of God so this justification is as if you never done it it's not that God's gonna chop your past sins or he's already done that this is coming to a realization that hey men I'm maturing I am justified I got trapped into it I'm living a Christian life when you come to this part of justification in the see on the first seal look you make Satan powerless you make him powerless you do the only power he gets this win like brother Gary action says we give him a bunch of arrows he how can you hunt with it just a bowl you can't kill nothing but time yeah trying to go bear hunting with just a bow you'll realize real quick it will become a revelation as that brother said that you got the wrong equipment real quick so that's the same way with Satan he's got the wrong equipment but we think he's this great some big something that we can't overcome well I believe the first seal opening tells us shows us that we're justify in God not in that and God were justified and the real and the real person is coming to a realization that they didn't do it to start with amen because you can't blame what you did in your past life on the new birth you can't play you can't blame what you did on what you got now that's why I believe in you let me say that again brother Colley yeah he's he's like what you can't fly I can't say it again I forgot but you can't say that that you know everybody says the devil made me do it no you you did it he just helped you do it cuz if it was that easy we just send the devil to hell with I'll go to heaven no you got something to do with it you do alright you give him the arrows to shoot you with a with a bow when if you didn't give him any arrows he couldn't shoot you but that part of justification is not the baby foreign part that God forgive me of my sins I'm a sinner save me now that's that's not that justification that justification like I said is bringing you to a position to tell you that that one inside of you never did it because that was not in you when you did it that's why I do not agree with the people in the message that says you always was eternal you had eternal life in your soul not when I was doing the things I did hello you tell me you look back through your life at the things you did you think God was in you know the reason he's in me now is why I don't do them things no more amen that's why I believe it is just a justification now why would brother Branham if brother Branham since there's nothing it bothers me they say brother branch they say they say brother I'm taught that you always was eternal and you never needed eternal life and but now why would he make a statement that at 12 years old I would have got saved had it not been for that demon well if he always was eternal what was a demon have to do with it no brother Branham will tell you a story how he used to wash his car on Sunday not go to church before he got born again a prophet on Sunday washing his car watching people go to church no he might have been a prophet but he didn't have the new birth he had a new birth you've been in church amen so that's just to me that's just that's what the that's what the great mystery of this whole thing is is that brother Branham never changed the Bible he cannot change the Bible he cannot change the way that we're saved he cannot change the way that that we not gonna get a new body like new throw this one away and pick up another one we're not gonna do that it's gonna be this body redeemed amen everybody understand that that's another easy thing you'd be real easy to throw this one away and just God make you a brand new one no the hard part is to get this thing changed this thing that was born in sin see that's why we go by and we think well this thing was born in sin is justified justified I have not done it in the first place if you realize that then you got to take this guy with it this is what's going to change this body is for us to realize that that work of the change that the body is already in us it's not somewhere and it's not something some preachers gonna lay hands on you to get a body change it's inside you right now everything you needs inside of you amen all right so there we go justification we come to a place to see that that white horse is not riding in our life anymore he's riding away he's riding off he's taking a trip away from us and don't let it be like a boomerang okay stop it let him just keep on going brother Branham says that horse just rides right on into eternity I want him to ride so far away from me till I never see him again amen so there we go with with seal number one we see it's the first three church ages it was the Lion of the tribe of Judah went forth with the boldness of preaching the gospel Peter said silver and gold have I none but such I have give unto thee rise up and walk that was that first three ages but by the time we get to the fourth age every bit of that just goes away all right because that horse somebody listened to what that saying was and made it a deed all right so let's go to Revelation six first three and four when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see and they went out another horse that was red so this is a this is another powered same rider but another power another angle Satan has to get to you all right cuz let these seals are for you you say oh no that happened back there for you and they went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace sea power was given to take peace from the earth they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword we know what a sword is it's a word all right so that was a word given unto him what at Nicaea to change everything over to what we see now and set up start setting up denominations all right there by okay with that say Amen all right so this is a red horse rider now what is always red signifies sanctification red through red is white all right everybody with that say ma'am punch your neighbor come and chalk the gate punch your neighbor when y'all say Amen do this that way everybody stay away don't Amen up like this ain't man like this we'll see who's got brotherly kindness I'm up here by myself I'm fine y'all just don't start beating on each other so that's the red horse rider now we see that what brother Brown told us is that remember that was starting in and remember what we said all this is these are all lap overs you see how I've got them kind of straight they're all lapped over there's one lapping over to the other all right because what happened was they should kill one another what was the the worst killing was was the word they killed the people's influence and they physically killed 68 million Christians starting into this time as that red horse rider brother Brown said that horse rode through the blood of the martyrs of the saints of God all right thereby okay with that and that was the Ox age which was the labor there was not a lot of exciting thing goes on with an ox but that Joker if you want him to pull something he just you just put a little something out in front of him he just keeps pulling and he pulled him right through that longest church age which is between three four and five that's fifteen hundred years of dark ages and we see it's Church age number four and that shows to me that shows sanctification not the sanctification that you're cleaned and set aside for service that was the baby form sanctification God cleans the jar up and then puts you to where you can be filled and he can put you in service that all right say ma'am now this sanctification he's not gonna put you back down in the mud and bring you back out again no he's got a higher order for you he's got a higher position the statue of a perfect man he wants to now clean you up so much to micro clean you clean all the my even down to the molecules he wants to just steam clean you hey man not the inside guy now we're talking about the memories and conscience of the spirit realm of the man because you're born again inside yourself you're born again you don't need to be sanctified in that interim interim in there man he's already sanctified he's already took a rapture really okay you understand what I'm saying so we're working on the middleman the memory reason conscious affects an imagination that's what we're working on and God's gonna start cleaning that up he's gonna start cleaning us up by what red blood the bleeding Word of God amen the bleeding Word of God every Sunday we get a dose of the bleeding Word of God and it should wash us out I'm in that all right it washes it it keeps us clean he doesn't clean us up the first time we've already had that we've already got the new birth in our soul it's cleaning up that memory reason conscious affection imagination is putting there what setting our affections toward God set in our place to where God can I told him this morning in Bible School in Bible School Bible study or son school class God's not going to take some a child a Christian child it's not going to take the body change they don't know how it's like driving a car a kids the kids a kid but don't give a five-year-old kid a car hey man that person has to be mature because we read in Hebrews where Paul told us said you can drink milk but you're a baby but you desire these other things you want the meat what so that we're given to a mature group of people and that's what you were trying to be as more mature group of people not a babbling Pentecostal baby that was okay at one time that was fine that's your journey here we go through our journey this is a journey that you might say oh well that's back in the church ages no this is this is the compartments of you do you read these church ages at history that's church age book if you read about the fees in church age you said well that was a good church anything you toss it over to the side no there's no gets in that church age book that come from the ephesian church age that pertains to you because we're at the end we're at the end that we can look back in like well they'll said we get we get every promise we get every over coming from all church ages back you and I do every one of them that's what you and I get so thank God for that mmm we're in the end time folks the books open and God wants to give it to us more than we want it amen all right so now let's go to the next one revelation 6 verse 5 and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third beast say come and see and I beheld in law a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny see that not hurt the oil and the wine and what is the oil the oil is the Holy Ghost and the wine is the stimulation of Revelation as brother Dale was saying this morning listen you cannot get a revelation from God without the Holy Ghost now you can get a knowledge that will take you to a place to get born again like you heard my testimony not too long ago I read I read all the books and I listened to tapes that's 14 years old well you know what I got a stimulation from that but and it stayed in there in my in my gray matter it stayed there because it was part of my memory but folks it didn't help me for the next 20 years there was an interval in there between me and God that I'm very ashamed of a man and God didn't have they went nothing he could have poured all that word inside of me and it would have done me no good why because he wasn't inside of me people think just because we know that that you're not supposed to cut your hair that's in the Bible brother Graham said that's just the ability to read ways that that's just the ability to be able to read you can read and see where it says the woman shouldn't go there but you know what there is a revelation behind that amen because your head ships Christ we all all of us shouldn't be cutting their hair you understand what I mean in the spiritual aspect because we are finishing the body of Christ and man our hair is our covering we're not supposed to cut ourselves off from God as men because we are finishing the body of Christ is that okay I know it must be boring all to death because most of you are asleep I tell you you sleep through this if you won't do but one day you're gonna thank brother daily myself and these ministers for bringing you the truth because you won't hear this everywhere ain't bragging on nobody and bragging on God because you know what there's somebody in here has to be getting it because God's not gonna stand up here and preach through all of us and y'all don't get anything somebody's gonna get something if it's just one of you but I just like to think all of us are maybe you're just praying in silent when you got your eyes closed hmm it's rough as we get older you know it just really is revelation 6 verse 5 and we had opened the third seal we go to the third seal the third beat says come and see now who was the third beast the third beast was the man so we've had to line I what you laughing about Louie's line Hawks man don't fall out when you go to sleep don't follow you'll hurt what to pray for you praying for me okay all right thank you all right just don't fall out that bench try that sometime get up on the front of this thing and you'll you'll you'll not go to sleep because you'll you know if you go to sleep you go fall off in the floor what was I saying oh the man lie knocks man an eagle now the man is the intelligence now we must get this cuz you guys see the pattern you say well what is in the world has black got to do with the Holy Ghost that was one of the questions even when brother Dale was preaching them back in the 80s I'm like my dentist what in the world but inside of you is death if you're not born again but that old nature inside the you has got to die before Christ can come in amen because you can't have a live devil and the live holy ghost in your soul at the same time one of them's got to be dead just like you know what just like we go back to the Bible you're not supposed to have a one wife you're not supposed to have the one husband we'll go back to we covered it under here under marriage and divorce you can't be married to three or four people and be married to Christ your old husband can be dead though and you can marry Christ so you're our old husband Satan has been killed and he's dead but remember we see this as the black horse but now look watch this just a minute and we read that for some of you that wasn't here when I was going through it we looked at the Bible says Jesus said to him one day said if that light in you be darkness how great is that darkness okay so how great is the darkness because right here this is this is the age when all denominations come into fruition all denominations Methodist Baptist Presbyterian all denominations became active during coming in from Luther to Wesley's time and into Pentecost and into our age you're looking at the most horrible time because God didn't ever set up a denomination God didn't baptize people in the name of Father Son Holy Ghost man did but god winks at their ignorance but it was a black-tie garden it was just squeezing the light out of everything all right even Wesley and Luther and then they they baptize wrong they had wrong doctrine but God winked at their ignorance but that was the black horse riding through those ages under the man anointing because if you know what if your man's anointing is intelligence now it's okay if this this to me this is not the intelligence of man this is the intelligence of man this is the intelligence of the Holy Ghost because the lion ox man an eagle is the Holy Ghost that anoints you today right now to use your intelligence that are not asleep everybody stand up shake your brother's hands they god bless you if they're still asleep we need to pray for them oh oh all right sit back down wait a minute all right stand back up just shake around a little bit there we go we good all right so then maybe we can do it while you're standing that's a good idea everybody standing will finish this sermon for about an hour we'll fight we'll hear people hit the floor like you wouldn't believe knock a whole row of people over but we need opened the third seal I heard the third beast say come and see now see that was the seal that was tore off everybody got that the seal that was tore off was the black horse but underneath that is a revelation that means you've got to have so I have to look and see that the blackness of way down in my memory reason conscience affects an imagination we all got them demons we got to fight you're not fighting one inside if you're fighting one inside you need a new birth okay but you see here this is this is not the Holy Ghost to give you the new birth this is a Holy Ghost that keeps you and keeps you clean it keeps anointing you it keeps cleaning you out it keeps brother branham said right here look at this this is the Holy Spirit and he said there's lines running down that moles all this together this is not when you get the Holy Ghost this is when you get the holy go but you work through all these things so that the Holy Spirit can what seal that person in hey man we want to be sealed in so much that Satan's sealed out mmm so that Holy Ghost is not just the Holy Ghost to get you saved to get you born-again that's the Holy Ghost to keep you going on and on and on and on more and more what being born again we read that scripture there and Peter being born again you say again I'm just reading what the Bible says being born again everything we do is a continual like I said sanctification they just you don't get washed one time you're stink literally but we have taken about half we have to get washed every Wednesday never Sunday hey man who get washed every Wednesday never signing by the water of the word and it's not bad to take one in between all that with regular water make sure it's warm mmm so anyway we're just all family here but don't ever do that again amen yeah well it was it walked up here who was it said somebody if somebody made sure you didn't get the water this time okay thanks for your help though I appreciate you helping one of these other brothers weren't here but don't ever do it again find somebody else that's a that's a knowledge of man that will he he's not gonna do that again but we see that what's God doing though he's taking you and he's taking you and he's zeroing you out I like what brother Harris said he said he zeros you out you're zeroed out in other words you're dead if you're dead but Paul says we are dead and our life is hidding Christ amen because if any part of us is alive remember the statement I always say God will fill those who are not full of their self amen because if you're full of yourself there's no place for God to be a man but if you limp to yourself out then I promise you got to fill you up amen so let's just keep on going listen we're the eleventh hour work or all these things that are being packed into us but you know what we're the astronaut we're able to receive this pressure we're able to receive this word that God's bringing us and then I just believe that I mean the things we discuss and talk about man it's just supernatural okay I just believe it is that we're brother Brown said we're at what a prophetic people a supernatural people we have supernatural insight why because we're reading things that man has read this for you for hundreds of years and said well you know what brother Branham even preached a wild horse rider being the holy go but when the seal was broke brother Ram didn't see Christ he saw Satan Superman at first with the seat that was the seal but once that seal was tore off he had to see Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ or the speedy is the seal and then Jesus Christ being in you within your journey is the Holy Ghost what living in your life it is the Holy Ghost in you doing the work not you doing the work Amen so now let's go to revelations six verse seven and eight excuse me and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see and I look to be able to pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and the power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth so this is a mixed color animal this is one two and three mixed together to make four white red black mixed together to make a pale horse color or a mixed color brother Brown said a horrible putrid color alright but what it is it's the power of Satan all mixed together well that's what it's coming - it's coming to a head because after this fourth seal we take a rapture we take a rapture rapture takes place on the fourth seal we explain that all right so it's a mixed color what do you see now look at all these doctrines it's all mixed like brother nails preaching not being mixed with faith we read this and Hebrews this morning downstairs they heard the word but not being mixed with faith you and I have got a number one realize who we are what church age were in what what promises we get what overcoming we get we the books open folks that you can see all these things you're privileged to be able to see this because what it's the eagle anointing it's the one that's the highest up it's the one that doesn't start drinking milk an eagle starts eating meat he never drinks milk momma Eagle goes and gets the squirrel chews it up into little bitty nuggets and gives it to the animal Eagle never drinks milk there's no milk glands afraid to drink milk with it's a meat-eater and that's what you and I are were meat eaters we love the meat of the word so this is church age number seven which now look at the way it's not just it's not just the Holy Ghost it's Incarnate Word it's the word being made flesh as we were talking many times before and the word was made flesh your flesh you will we will in the body change become the Incarnate Word but it's got to start to develop it's got to start somewhere to develop into someone is going to just walk right in to a body change and become the Incarnate Word and then the dead in crisis is going to be the Incarnate Word they're coming back here to be what God in human flesh pretty simple but this is the eagle age and when we get to the fifth seal you don't see the line ox man an eagle you don't see any of the beasts because why because we take a rapture in the seventh church age are the four seals everybody got that say man all right we've not been through this so I just wanted to I just want to refresh your memory whatever memory y'all got left after you fall asleep but the fourth seal the rapture takes place then what does God do he starts dealing with Israel okay the Holy Ghost goes to two prophets two is real and they get the baptism of the Holy Ghost 144,000 of them through two prophets their buddy got that say man all right but now we got to cover let's go to revelations 6 verse 9 and when he had opened the fifth seal immediately it goes into another dimension right because the lion ox man an eagle is your Holy Ghost in this dimension amen it's the Holy Ghost in this dimension that's gonna take us out of this dimension into another dimension then God's gonna start dealing with the Jews we're over in another dimension and then we're at the wedding supper whatever we're going to do we're in another dimension while God comes and deals with the Jews but now we see it when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain no beasts no beasts saying come and see in other words no Holy Ghost on the earth when we leave this place there's gonna be no Holy Ghost except in two prophets all seven billion people there's going to be two people within your birth two people it's gonna have the holy other then they're gonna preach and it's going to bring 144,000 then but what a dark time that's why you see that black come up and then you see the mixed color of all that together but it's going to take what not the mixing of God to get us out of here but it's going to take justification and sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost Incarnate Word to get us out of here that's what's going to get us out of here all right and we're heading toward that I know we are we're getting really close and the older ones say man the younger ones are like what are they talking about brother Donnie amens the loudest every bit of that he's heading toward one of the oldest ones in the group so I guess this was helping him out that's all right so it Abraham was not in that and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under so altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held not the testimony of Jesus Christ everybody remember that all right and they cried with a loud voice and said how long O Lord holy and true dust down judge and avenge our blood now brother Brahim said that couldn't be the bride cuz see many people even brother branham thought that was the souls under the altar that were the early church are part of the church ages when that seal come off hey brother branham could read and that angel said read that again I mean I just believe the angel because remember the angel that come to brother Brian every day never gave him a revelation it was that angel pointing him to a scripture and quoting him scripture that brother Branham had to take through the filter of the Holy Ghost that was inside of him to get that revelation to bring it back out to me and you and man an angel can't give you a revelation only God can give you a revelation hey man but the angel would say hey read that again avenge testimony they held who are these people brother Graham said they can only be Jews that we're blinded so that you and I could come in because look how long will Lord hole intrude us they're not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth now that brother brown said if that was a Christian you don't do that listen there is no one in the sixth dimension I don't care if they got murdered there's no one in the sixth dimension saying I'll be glad when I get back into that next dimension I'll take care of my boss or whoever that was no that's the dirt that's the farthest thing from their mind hey man that's the furthest thing but these people still have it in their mind that they were done wrong they were wrong Oh Lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them now why is a white robe white robes eternal life amen white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow-servants which is who the Jews also and their brethren the 144,000 that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled now how were they killed they were killed under persecution of the Jews right 144,000 is going to be killed under the persecution of the Jews the sixth seal persecution of the sixth seal that's what's going to kill those Jews hey man this is probably the worst response of God so I think I'll just we might stop and take communion I don't know what's wrong with y'all this sorry excites you this sort of mate cuz this and something's how about you I'm not talking about Jews I'm not I'm sure you have to use them as the allegory but my heavens people this is our Redemption this is what we're going home on we're not going home on the brother branham sent a prophet we're gonna go home is that what he said is now becoming live in our heart and we become what he said so these are Jews but look at this you talk about grace you talk about grace now see we got to bring the fifth seal 260 on the seventh seal back here everybody okay with that because remember we're gone the fifth seal is to the Jews but you and I have to get the the Thunder this under that sealed the Thunder under that seal is God is giving eternal life to a group of people that didn't even know who he was that literally turned him down and said let his blood be on us and our children and God gives them eternal life because he literally blinded their eyes so that you and I could come in hey man so what about this is the you think of how many times when you read that fifth seal think of look at how many times brother brown says grace grace grace the greatest grace sealed well what's the greatest grace to me and you is it God's changed your buddy God give you eternal life you did you want it all once we started no remember brother Brown said you didn't go searching for God God went searching for you amen so what about great so that form this is we come back to that justification under the fifth seal the real you didn't do it you've got to realize that that thing that's inside of you today never send today in this life never had a bad thought so the real you didn't do it and we must see that under this fifth seal that justification is that it's already took us to the glorified body because remembers remember we talked before if the rapture takes place here somewhere in here we got to get a glorified body you can't go in the rapture without a glorified body hey man so you got to have had one back here somewhere so under the fifth sixth and seventh seal we remember the seven seals is coming we'll talk about that later but the fifth seal shows us that we're already redeemed already redeemed we just got to believe that and then and walk into it all right let's go revelation 6 verse 12 to the sixth sixth seal we were just finished with that so we don't spend too much time I'll be all wind open the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake remember this is a total disruption of nature look everything this is nature Sun became black moon became blood stars of heaven fell fig trees casted in time untimely fruit mighty wind heaven departed Melton and island-y we're talking about nature all right and that's the last thing that you're not listening the last thing it's you and I let's keeping us from being taking the body change is our memory reason conscious affection imagination because that's what the whole paradox is it's that thing inside of you is trying to tell you that you're already there that thing inside of you is trying to tell you you already been redeemed you already been glorified you just got to get then what happens is is God's down here working out through that filter of memory reasoning conscious affection imagination Satan's out here working back to it this way trying to get back in through your memories and conscience fiction imagination and he's trying to tell you what he's trying to give you a laundry list of why that you can't do these things now God didn't give us one right he said those who he's justified he's already glorified I mean what you don't need to even expound on that and the heavens are part of the scroll when it rolled together every mountain ever island moved out of the place kings of the earth great me enriched me and chief captain mighty man they didn't make a rapture and every free man hid themselves in the dens and rocks of the mountains into the mountains said to the mountains following us and hide us from the face in the sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come who shall be able to stand now we know for sure that that was the judgment seal of the word we read that brother Brown that's the quote brother answer this a judgement seal it's also the tribulation seal we are not here when that sixth seal opens in its reality because it is a total disruption of this earth remember it was open in a three-fold manner so what's God doing remember a sanctification is cleaned and set aside for service now God's already cleaned us up and he's cleaning us up now but he's getting ready to clean the earth up all right a total disruption of nature it's got to be you and I have got to have so much of a nature change that we can say I and my father are one and these other things and the Shutts gonna all pull away we were talking about a couple weekends ago and it's true because remember the life was in that shuck listen to me just from it the life was in the shuck at one time it was Green it was pliable and it was protecting the seed that was down inside it had life in it but that life moved from that shuck and went into the seed well what this dried up it's it rattles in the wind it protects that seed but what but it's not seed seed looks back to seed because when God put this in the seed in the ground it didn't look like a show it was seed that's what you and I have to look to we've had carriers we've had all these different places pleat people you and I all came through some kind of denomination you and I came through some kind of doctrine amen and at one point some of that doctrine God winked it to ignorance but now that we've come to where it's what seed time when it's seed time the shuts gonna pull away because you know why cuz if I say I and my father are one and I'm seed I'm seed I meant but if I'm Chuck I can't be seed you do all you won't do Chuck has a shock and the shuck can't stand for the wheat to say I seed and my father seed are one because that's what he said he said this shirts gonna pull away why because they can't stand it because it's not seed you and I have come to we see this right here in this part of sanctification God so burns this earth so much that he can walk on it now what about burning you so much that he can walk in you amen so that's what we're heading toward folks were heading toward that we're actually we're walking through it and in honor I believe that we're being washed by the water of the word were being this is the last great push of sanctification because listen when my body gets changed I don't need it I don't need sanctification I'm there it's like I was telling the church the other day or last Sunday you know we have faith right we're faith based people right but now what part of that then though becomes a reality because faith has the end somewhere brother Brown says faith alone won't do it because only you know what I got up this morning and I hoped by faith that my Chevrolet would make the journey up here with gas in it or not amen some people come here on empty some people come here full of herself I don't thank God for coming here empty anyway so I was hoping then listen this morning I knew we were having church it I had to be here at 9:30 or 9:00 o'clock right now my journey was the faith and the hope that I would get here but now the folks I don't have to hope I'm preaching I don't have to have faith that I'm preaching I am preaching I am preaching and that's what we've got to come to so what I was talking about in that in the acts of a play when you see those acts of a play those are people and they come to a great finale and when they come to finale what happened they walk out on the stage and they bow why because they're finished it's done they've completed what they didn't hope they got their lines right they didn't hope that the props worked they're finished so I read that scripture Jesus said it is finished you and I have to come to a place to where we say it is finished what Redemption then yeah is over for those that come to body change it will be you don't need it anymore but it's a total disruption of nature and it opened in a three-fold manner what was that threefold manner number one was it cleansed the 144,000 Jews that had to go through the tribulation to die it cleansed the foolish virgin because she had to go through the tribulation because she didn't receive the baptism of the holy ghost to clean her up while she was here right all right and then also then third fold was what the purging of the earth to get the earth ready for the Millennium and who's the Millennium Force for the Jews but you and I get to come back on a honeymoon and set with the Son of David on the throne in the Millennium and have a wonderful thousand years of just whatever we want to do it doesn't matter and by all right cuz remember too we got to look at this the Seventh Seal opens in a three-fold manner but we'll get to that later but remember then last Sunday two Sundays ago three ago we talked about the interval which is a gap or a time of just just hang on you know God created the world six days he rested the seventh now that's an allegory because God don't ever rest he didn't fold his arms up and go set up and a STONER star somewhere no he was finished with his physical creation right so he was done he rested but there was an interval of time and you know what that interval of time is this right now that interval of time is now that you and I are here today in time but we're not time creatures were caught in time because remember I said a few weeks ago that every time you see the interval between the seals the vowels the plagues the church ages and all these things you see the Holy Ghost come on the same Amen the same way with the statue of a perfect man you go one cuz remember face not an ad right one two three four five six there's a interval then the seventh so that's what we're in now we're in that interval time okay we're in that interval to where the Holy Ghost just looks like he's not doing anything but he's working he's doing something through you and I because as we said many times before brother branham tells us and we'll read them all next Sunday six seals is what finishes Redemption Jesus preached six seals and he stopped amen and also you look at the six fold purpose of Daniel what happens you've got one two three four five six then they got to build a Millennium temple and then we enter into the Millennium so there's always an interval that we have come to a place to where look we're finished we go into rapture we can say just like Jesus it is finished so I'm gonna read that scripture one more time I'm gonna read revelations eight one they didn't get that on that for some reason that's okay that's fine just they were yet revelations eight one will start near next Sunday and when he had opened the Seventh Seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour Jesus in John 19 verse 30 when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up to go amen it is finished brother Brown says what is the Seventh Seal the end of the struggling world the end of all things so who's it going to end down who's it gonna end oh it's gonna end on the seventh seal who's gonna who's the seventh seal which all its brother branham I can keep talking y'all keep listening they say oh I know it's brother Branham got to come back or it's alright Lord I hate this one they say that's the seven seals polygamy why in the world all of y'all that just has one wife they say Amen that's right but you know what they made it everything but what it is it's Christ in you the hope of glory you are the manifestation of these seals these seals are not pieces of paper they're not quotes and comments it's a life it's what you live it's what you do is what you breathe is this message in flesh let's stand our feet this message has taken on flesh not words not piece of the paper its flesh this message is flesh if God was the Word made flesh then you or the word made flesh ain't no other way to look at it but that you and I are God in human flesh called the bride to finish this thing up Satan's gonna ride off and I hope he thought I hope he's already rode off in your life I hope he if he hadn't I hope he's getting ready to ride away because when he does ride away brother Brown said death will come up your arm and you'll just want wipe it away wipe it away what that old what comes and says something you just wipe him away you know why cuz you can't get ahold of you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for this day we thank you for what you've what you've said to us Lord may it sink in our heart just a refresher course that we've been on here for a year Lord and sorry we took so long maybe board the people to death but Lord we pray that this great time that we're in we must see these things it's got to be the meat of the word that's going to take us out of here not just skim milk Lord I pray that you'd be with each one give us supernatural strength in Revelation be with us all during the week Lord till we come back on Wednesday lord I pray that you sanctify us at this moment Lord for taking to this communion that we can remember every month Lord that you died for our sins you hung on a cross to take away the shame you took our shame so that we didn't have to have any you took away all the things Lord and when you said it is finished you meant it now what you did was a few days later you entered into a bride and you continued your work in them not a one-man show anymore Lord but it's a mini membered body that before the foundation of the world you knew who would accept it and who would not you knew who would take it and endure to the end and you and a group of people would leave this world thank you Father for your word thank you for sending us a prophet thank you for giving us a wonderful pastor Lord and deacons and elders a good good group of people Lord that comes to this church we pray this you just sanctify Lord for this journey we got to draw closer together bind Satan out of this place make sure Lord that we come here Lord expecting to hear from you and Lord I believe you'll get something if you come believing that we'll meet you here Lord you've never left us or forsaken us you give us all things what I pray that you'd be with an affirm of this service thank the fives truly Lord clean us out don't set us aside for service Lord put us in service so that we can do something for you father bless the ones that are sick ones that are not here or blessed a little sister hope they're with a new baby the pray that should just take care of her give her supernatural strength and comfort and be with each one Lord that has anything going on in their life truly again let us hear a wonderful report from brother John about sister Maya Lord that everything is well and that everything will be fine Lord we we consider them just real just real close friends Lord we pray that you just touch them now father give us this day our daily bread help us in this communion service in Jesus name we pray amen god bless you brother Dale amen let's give our brothers a good ham believe it we believe it so this part of it's part of our own journey that is our journey we're taking the journey right with this thank God for he meant we come to this time through the communion part we just thank God that he's allowed us to receive the truth to be able to follow it and to see what it means and you know they understand everything and to be as what we are let's just read our scripture then we'll go right on into the communion all said for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shew the Lord's death till he come or for whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily she'll be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but a little man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup where he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body but this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep where we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger they didn't eat at home that you come not together under condemnation the rest what I said in order when I come let's just have a few moments of silent prayer pray and one for the other but the Lord would bless us all and give us make us to be worthy to take the communion because he's the one that's done that for us right
