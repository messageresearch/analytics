[10:34] start back into the natural family and
[10:37] how how to uh um I'm not going to tell
[10:41] you how to raise your kids but maybe we
[10:42] can go through the prophet's message in
[10:44] the Bible and uh it will help you in
[10:47] raising your natural family I know we've
[10:50] all made mistakes and done things wrong
[10:52] but you know God never makes a
[10:54] mistake he as we show here even when we
[10:58] make mistakes
[11:00] it's all going to God's perfect will
[11:02] anyway every mistake we make is going to
[11:04] God's perfect will so you got your
[11:06] Bibles let's turn back to Isaiah 53
[11:10] continue the thought with
[11:13] um that we were this morning
[11:16] on who shall
[11:18] declare his
[11:21] generation who shall declare I I know
[11:24] we've uh we had some discussion
[11:27] downstairs and thank God everybody's
[11:28] thinking about something at least you're
[11:30] not sitting there talking about football
[11:31] or baseball or anything he talking about
[11:33] the word of God and it's stirred up your
[11:35] pure mind and that's what I'm supposed
[11:37] to do I'm not supposed to give you all
[11:39] the an you're supposed to find something
[11:41] for your own sister uh Anna
[11:46] Mara she said I found out I was a
[11:48] special
[11:50] person that's exactly what it is that
[11:53] Genesis 1:26 and 27 is a special
[11:56] designation of God Almighty himself
[11:59] not a second person not a third person
[12:01] not another person not this over here
[12:02] not that over there but that is coming
[12:04] straight from the almighty that is
[12:07] eternal that's why I said that that
[12:08] Genesis 126 and 27 that's why I like it
[12:11] so much that's Purity that's Eternal
[12:13] that's never had a bad thought never
[12:16] committed adultery never sin never done
[12:18] anything wrong right right
[12:21] amen and if I start with that
[12:23] resurrection of that man in here right
[12:25] sir in this Tomb of the Earth right on
[12:30] Resurrection Day he'll come out and I'm
[12:33] not talking about the resurrection down
[12:35] in in this part of the earth I'm talking
[12:37] about Paul was talking about this
[12:39] Resurrection an out Resurrection the
[12:41] resurrection from what dead works and
[12:44] the things of the flesh so just keep
[12:46] these things in your mind if you have
[12:47] any more questions just feel free to ask
[12:48] and we uh there's a lot of lot of uh
[12:52] discussion going on and that's good amen
[12:54] discuss discuss the word of God discuss
[12:56] I'd rather you do that than discuss
[12:58] anything else and and if I said
[13:00] something wrong then then God will
[13:01] correct it somewhere the Lord will
[13:03] correct it even through a sister we may
[13:06] not like that but even through a spirit
[13:08] filled sister she could maybe see
[13:10] something that you don't see amen I hope
[13:12] that doesn't go wrong but that's exactly
[13:14] what brother R said a holy ghost fed
[13:15] woman can help
[13:16] you cuz she's filled with the same Holy
[13:19] Ghost you are you've just got a gift to
[13:21] channel it in different directions and
[13:23] you're able to stand here but but when
[13:25] what did happen in the garden that put
[13:27] the sisters in a different Covenant you
[13:28] know put in that double Covenant where
[13:30] she can't preach the gospel to the seed
[13:34] of God but she can be a help she can be
[13:36] a help to the seed of God she can raise
[13:38] those little kids that when they get the
[13:40] mind that if they get the mind of Christ
[13:41] at a young age she's done her job I read
[13:44] that quote the other day about that
[13:46] woman can help do more than the preacher
[13:48] in the pull pit a lot of times so so ask
[13:52] questions and I know there's a lot of
[13:54] things that that's really not clear we
[13:55] had to run through it we may take let
[13:57] brother Dale take a whole just stay in
[13:59] Genesis and stay in the first two or
[14:01] three chapters and kind of walk through
[14:02] it but but God he will present a way
[14:06] like Brother Joseph said he said he
[14:07] could
[14:08] see how that God come down and ask Adam
[14:12] and ask Eve what the problem was and
[14:15] they started passing the buck but God
[14:18] just said hey wait a
[14:19] minute serpent you started this whole
[14:22] thing you go and do you're I'm taking
[14:26] you out of the way and then he comes
[14:27] right back and says and woman to you
[14:30] this is what you're going to do your
[14:31] desire will now be to your husband your
[14:33] husband only that's right and sorrow
[14:36] your bare children and all that and then
[14:38] he'll go then he went over to Adam and
[14:39] said because you hearkened to what your
[14:41] woman what your wife said you're going
[14:44] to work by the sweat of your brow and
[14:45] you're going to die and go back to the
[14:46] grave but we've got a second Adam that
[14:50] we're going to talk about this afternoon
[14:52] that that Adam the first Adam was the
[14:57] one that put us in iniquity
[14:59] because he knew better he knew what he
[15:02] was doing and knowing to do better and
[15:05] doing different is Iniquity right that's
[15:07] a hideous sin Eve still thought she was
[15:10] right right on up to to bearing you know
[15:12] bringing Abel into the world but U Adam
[15:16] I believe knew I believe he had the
[15:18] steps that he had to take that he knew
[15:20] what he had to do because he was a Son
[15:22] of God because he was led by God this is
[15:24] what he
[15:25] done okay but he knew that if he just
[15:28] let her go and and let her go out that
[15:31] that would that would break all your
[15:33] types which it would break every type in
[15:34] the Bible but he totally typed Jesus
[15:38] Christ by looking I believe Adam looked
[15:40] down through time I just believe Adam
[15:41] was like a prophet he was hey Adam was
[15:44] the only man on Earth that's right he
[15:46] didn't have to go he didn't have a
[15:48] consultation with the preacher or the
[15:51] Deacon or or another prophet he was the
[15:53] only man he was it and God spoke to him
[15:56] the Bible said they spoke face to face
[15:59] with each other and I believe God spoke
[16:00] to him and and maybe put some little
[16:03] points in there you know how a preacher
[16:04] will put a point in and then 6 months
[16:06] later the holy spirit will Quicken it
[16:08] well that's kind of the way it was with
[16:10] Adam I believe God would tell him things
[16:11] and talk to him and say things to him
[16:13] and then when something would come up
[16:15] he'd go that's why God said that right
[16:18] cuz we're no different I mean you know
[16:19] he he he was a man walking upright had
[16:22] an ability had a knowledge you know but
[16:24] he was a Son of God yes we got to not
[16:27] you know don't belittle him and say well
[16:30] well he was no no he was a Son of God he
[16:32] knew what he was doing he knew what God
[16:35] had I believe he knew what he had to do
[16:38] to keep his lineage going on down the
[16:40] line all right you say well what about
[16:42] Abel well I was reading right here it
[16:45] Abel somebody ask well why Abel died
[16:49] well I know Abel
[16:50] died the reason Abel died is because God
[16:53] Satan was trying to kill another son of
[16:55] he was trying to kill that
[16:56] lineage he was trying to kill K that Len
[16:59] so he killed Abel but God just raised up
[17:01] Seth right brother says infallible proof
[17:04] then when he slew Abel he thought he got
[17:06] him because he destroyed the only
[17:07] righteous part of the seed then God
[17:09] raised up Seth to take his place a
[17:11] beautiful type of the death of Christ
[17:13] and the resurrection of Christ cuz when
[17:15] Christ died Satan thought he cut that
[17:17] that's why he said right here he said he
[17:19] says he made an offering for sin because
[17:21] what he who was going to declare his
[17:23] generation Satan knew if he could kill
[17:25] that man Jesus he could kill the man
[17:27] Jesus and nothing else would come from
[17:29] him he would stop a
[17:31] generation of the Messiah that they they
[17:33] said he called the Messiah that he
[17:34] thought he could get that stopped but
[17:36] what did what did God do he just raised
[17:38] him right back up same thing with Abel
[17:41] gave him Abel Abel was killed next thing
[17:43] you see is Seth type of Christ death be
[17:48] and Resurrection Seth come right back up
[17:49] all right so let's just go to the Lord
[17:51] in prayer and we'll try to finish up
[17:52] this afternoon de Heavenly Father we

[19:04] before him as a tender plant and as a
[19:06] root out of dry ground he have no form
[19:08] or commonness and when we shall see him
[19:11] there is no beauty that we should desire
[19:13] him he is despised and rejected of men a
[19:15] Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief we
[19:18] think we have a hard time yeah and we
[19:20] hear as it were our faces from him he

[19:28] that's right
[19:29] we did that you say I wasn't back there
[19:31] we did it in our walking life and the
[19:34] things that we did in life this is what
[19:36] we did we did not think that Jesus
[19:39] Christ was the one who was going to save
[19:40] us right when we were in the world we
[19:43] weren't thinking
[19:44] about okay come on he is despised and
[19:47] rejected of men a Man of Sorrows
[19:49] quainted with grief and we hid it was
[19:50] our face from him he was despised and we
[19:52] esteemed him not surely Heath borne our
[19:55] griefs and carried our sorrows yet we
[19:57] did esteem him stricken smitten of God
[19:59] and Afflicted remember um I was thinking
[20:02] back there sitting in a study about
[20:05] Kus to this man the words this man's
[20:08] going to die for he's going to you know
[20:11] have all these great people and die for
[20:13] these people he can't even save going to
[20:14] save all these people came save his
[20:15] house he was prophesying see but see
[20:19] this one could yeah the first Adam
[20:21] couldn't first Adam couldn't save
[20:23] himself but this second Adam he didn't
[20:26] need saving he was saving us
[20:28] righten he stayed on that cross for me
[20:30] and you he didn't stay on that cross for
[20:32] himself right surely he has borne our
[20:34] griefs and carried our sorrows yet we
[20:35] did esteem him strick and smitten of God
[20:37] and Afflicted but he was wounded for our
[20:40] transgressions he was bruised for our
[20:42] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[20:44] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[20:46] healed all we like sheep have gone
[20:48] astray we have turned everyone to his
[20:50] own way and the Lord hath laid on him
[20:53] the iniquity of us all amen he was
[20:56] oppressed and he was afflicted yet he
[20:57] opened not his mouth he is brought as a
[20:59] lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep
[21:01] before her shears his dumb so he opened
[21:04] not his mouth he was taken from prison
[21:06] and from judgment and who shall declare
[21:09] his generation qu that's the first
[21:11] question who shall declare his
[21:13] generation for he was cut off out of the
[21:16] land of the living for the transgression
[21:19] of my people was he stricken you may be
[21:22] seated in the Lord I his Blessing to the
[21:23] reading of the word he was smitten
[21:27] stricken
[21:29] put on a cross amen but now remember
[21:33] let's go back and kind of and kind of
[21:35] review a little bit and then we'll get
[21:36] started we were just about we were
[21:38] coming out of the Old Testament because
[21:40] the Old Testament was a type and given
[21:43] to us like we showed in 1 Corinthians
[21:47] 10:1 that they were given for our
[21:49] example for whom the ends of the world
[21:52] come upon so that whatever happened in
[21:54] the Old Testament that was for our
[21:56] example but now see that wasn't our
[21:58] perfect example cuzz David wasn't our
[22:01] perfect example if you followed David's
[22:03] life it was a perfect example when he
[22:05] was in The Book of Psalms and when he
[22:07] was doing the thing singing the songs of
[22:09] God but when he when he saw a beautiful
[22:11] woman and he lusted after her and he and
[22:14] he had his best friend killed and
[22:15] committed adultery that didn't that's
[22:18] not in the Christian attitude or the
[22:20] Christian way right so we can't type
[22:23] oursel totally with David we can't type
[22:26] oursel totally with even Abraham he was
[22:29] the father of our faith but we're
[22:31] supposed to look at what he was
[22:32] believing in that's right all right
[22:34] because remember he gave his wife away a
[22:36] couple of times if we did that then we'd
[22:39] be in big trouble so you can't say
[22:42] everything is a perfect type but they
[22:44] are
[22:45] examples there are examples for whom the
[22:48] end of the world is come upon so you and
[22:50] I are supposed to look back we're
[22:53] supposed to look down through time and
[22:55] see all those examples using those
[22:58] examples to live by cuz they live that
[23:01] life under the blood of bulls and goats
[23:03] they live that life under an anointing
[23:06] that would come upon a uh um Nathan or
[23:09] or Samuel or any of those prophets but
[23:11] you know what you watch what these
[23:13] prophets in the Old Testament had today
[23:15] they killed a lot of
[23:18] people they K they literally killed well
[23:21] look what Elijah did th 300 of them down
[23:24] there and killed them
[23:25] all okay Samuel yes remember when Saul
[23:30] took the two kings and Samuel said you
[23:32] got to destroy every one of them he said
[23:33] I hear the blatant of the
[23:35] sheep he walks in and finds the King two
[23:38] kings like king of a I think and the
[23:40] other one Samuel all Samuel does is he
[23:43] said Saul he said I got a problem with
[23:46] this and he just pull a sa sword and he
[23:48] just whacks her head off right that's
[23:50] right that's
[23:51] right because the word of God told him
[23:54] to tell Saul kill them all kill all of
[23:57] them all like daddy said before you know
[23:59] you you see the God tell them to go in
[24:02] and say Smite all the the the he
[24:04] jebusites and kill them all well few
[24:07] chapters later you find out that they
[24:09] didn't do exactly what God said because
[24:11] they started fighting the same people
[24:12] again all right same thing with you and
[24:14] I if we don't cut sin off then it just
[24:16] going going to keep coming up yeah we
[24:18] going to have to kill the same I IES are
[24:21] going to come up and we're going to have
[24:22] to kill them off that's right but in 1
[24:23] Corinthians 10:1 he says that they were
[24:26] given for our example all right and then
[24:31] I in Psalms
[24:33] 139 verse
[24:35] 13-16 he talks about
[24:37] incontinence see we had to be brought
[24:39] some
[24:40] way what I was saying about Adam we can
[24:43] get into the details but but Adam had to
[24:45] preserve a place for that Genesis 126
[24:49] and 27 to
[24:51] fall a lineage cuz Jesus don't have a
[24:54] natural
[24:55] lineage Adam had a natural natural
[24:58] lineage it went from the Old Testament
[24:59] right on down to the New Testament and
[25:01] right on out to us because we were born
[25:04] in continuance and the lower parts of
[25:06] the Earth the Bible says we were
[25:07] fashioned what in our mom and daddy
[25:09] right just to be real in the womb of
[25:12] your mother you were fashioned you were
[25:13] formed that's where it all started
[25:17] naturally but when we come out then we
[25:19] know that I believe Adam knew that that
[25:22] there had to be one come cuz that
[25:25] Genesis 1:26 had to come
[25:28] the way that was supposed to come by
[25:31] Spoken Word
[25:32] exactly I believe Adam knew that but he
[25:35] knew that that couldn't happen once what
[25:37] happened to Eve it couldn't happen the
[25:39] way it was supposed to so he had to he
[25:41] played the part of Christ right yeah yes
[25:43] he said I will accept her sin ain't that
[25:46] what Christ come to do he come to what
[25:48] not be a sinner that's right but he come
[25:51] to take on my
[25:52] sin to make him sinful that's right make
[25:55] it sinful like you know brother Gerald
[25:57] Hughes was preaching there's a fine line
[25:58] there Jesus did not commit sin that's
[26:01] right but he took on the sin that we had
[26:03] right what did Adam do Adam committed
[26:06] iniquity by take by saying by doing what
[26:09] he was supposed not supposed to do but
[26:11] then he comes and he says hey whatever
[26:13] she's done I'll be a part of it and
[26:17] that's what Jesus done in all of your
[26:19] fallacies and all of your impurities God
[26:23] comes down and says I'm going to take on
[26:26] their sin yeah but see he had the
[26:31] goods he had the goods to bring us
[26:34] out Adam didn't have the goods to bring
[26:37] us out Adam couldn't say destroy this
[26:39] body and in 3 days I'll raise it back up
[26:42] but when Jesus come he had the ability
[26:44] to say in 3 days I'll raise this body
[26:47] back up all right that's what I mean in
[26:49] the
[26:50] resurrection he saw
[26:52] more of himself right because he
[26:56] couldn't see it
[26:58] in the Old Testament Saints you can't
[27:00] you can see types or examples of Christ
[27:03] but you don't see Christ himself in the
[27:05] people living daily lives being lost and
[27:09] then coming to no they were a Abraham
[27:12] Isaac Jacob Joseph I believe they were
[27:14] human beings remember Moses he could
[27:18] kill an Egyptian right but when God came
[27:21] down over that man and anointed him they
[27:24] had to cover his face cuz it shown so
[27:26] much him and God were so much together
[27:29] on on on his part of his mission till
[27:33] they Moses was their God right that's
[27:36] right but now remember what a lot of
[27:38] things Moses did that was not good
[27:40] that's right okay but so you take Moses
[27:43] for an
[27:44] example of the things that he did that
[27:46] he could talk to God and he could do the
[27:47] things of God and he could lead a group
[27:49] of people but
[27:51] remember he was a murderer
[27:54] yeah and it's like somebody said one
[27:58] time said
[27:59] well you really you really never see
[28:02] Moses asking forgiveness for that he
[28:05] never ask forgiveness for being a
[28:06] murderer you it's not recorded but you
[28:09] come over there when Moses had to stand
[28:11] in the gap for a group of
[28:13] people see there was there was Mo I
[28:17] there was Christ again saying all right
[28:19] whatever they
[28:21] done account it to me so if you but if
[28:25] you're going to kill them you got to
[28:26] kill me so God couldn't do this to get
[28:30] to Israel he had to kill Moses Moses was
[28:33] his anointed Prophet for the day God
[28:36] couldn't kill Moses so God couldn't kill
[28:38] Adam God couldn't
[28:41] kill uh
[28:43] Abraham because Abraham and Sarah were
[28:48] under that Covenant now where Abraham
[28:51] was the head and Sarah was underneath
[28:53] don't don't get off what we've been
[28:54] talking about cuz you're protected by by
[28:57] your husband right your husband's going
[29:00] to have to give an account for you but
[29:02] you're not going to have to give an
[29:03] account for your
[29:05] husband see God didn't curse Eve right
[29:09] he didn't curse Adam but he didn't say
[29:11] well Eve now you you know you just
[29:13] you're no he give he give a position
[29:16] right he give Eve a position he said
[29:19] okay for what you done you're going to
[29:20] have to be under your head which is your
[29:22] husband cuz you're the one that partook
[29:24] of this thing first and then you give it
[29:26] to your husband but in that your husband
[29:28] accepted that this is what's you're
[29:30] going to have to die amen Christ the
[29:32] same way he accepted our sin that's why
[29:34] he had to die yes right yes everybody
[29:38] that okay everybody understand that
[29:39] that's all right okay so now let's go
[29:42] and start in
[29:44] Galatians well Isaiah 53:10 we talked
[29:48] about we can start right that's okay
[29:49] brother Jo leave it
[29:51] there but remember in verse 10 it says
[29:54] yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he
[29:56] has put him to grief
[29:57] when thou shalt make his soul an
[30:00] offering for
[30:01] sin see there was offerings down through
[30:03] the Old Testament that were made by
[30:05] animals millions and millions of animals
[30:08] died to cover right to keep God from
[30:12] killing the people right it covered them
[30:15] made a covering a blood covering yes but
[30:17] that man would come in and we were
[30:19] talking downstairs remember not
[30:22] everybody in the Old Testament when I
[30:24] say the Old Testament I don't mean just
[30:25] what was written down on paper cuz a lot
[30:27] of other people Liv during the Old
[30:28] Testament that never got written in the
[30:30] old in everybody understand that that's
[30:32] right that's right if they believed in
[30:35] that blood sacrifice I believe they'll
[30:37] be in heaven right amen am but now if
[30:40] they just did like what Dad said you
[30:42] just walk up and it become a ritual and
[30:44] you just say here kill this animal they
[30:45] went to hell they didn't go to paradise
[30:49] right they but they believed in that
[30:51] blood sacrifice right they believed in
[30:53] it so much till they actually said
[30:55] transfer my sins onto this animal well
[30:58] the animal couldn't take the sin though
[31:00] and speak back and say no I'll receive
[31:02] your sin no God said hey we're going to
[31:05] take this animal life and it's just
[31:06] going to cover you but one day I'm going
[31:09] to come back see to the woman I'm going
[31:11] to come back and when that sin dumped on
[31:13] me I'm going to be able to it's going
[31:15] like I told him downstairs when it went
[31:17] on that animal it just made that animal
[31:20] dead when it went on Jesus Christ it
[31:23] just went through and it just filtered
[31:24] out and eradicated it right amen it
[31:27] didn't stay there it didn't linger
[31:30] around man it was a bloody place I'm
[31:32] sure we always think it's just a all
[31:35] that Temple was probably so clean could
[31:37] you imagine the millions of sacrifices
[31:39] they did they had to take the inals and
[31:41] do this with it and they had to take the
[31:43] fat and do this with it it was not a
[31:45] pretty sight a type of Jesus hanging on
[31:48] the cross just like we read in Isaiah 53
[31:50] look like hamburger meat well if you
[31:52] were to walk out and look out into the
[31:54] court and see them with the Laver and
[31:56] the golden all these things the Golden
[31:58] Ladder and all the things that they were
[31:59] killing these sacrifices it look like a
[32:01] slaughter house right blood everywhere
[32:04] exactly didn't look pretty it wasn't a
[32:06] pretty sight so if I was a man with a
[32:09] good conscience and I walked in and I
[32:11] looked at that and I thought my God my
[32:13] sins did this to this
[32:15] animal I would have a sin
[32:18] Consciousness to ask God to forgive me
[32:21] but the problem with the Old Testament
[32:23] was is I would do that and I would start
[32:26] feeling good and then about two months
[32:28] later yeah that old self that old adamic
[32:31] nature was still there that's right and
[32:33] it caused me to do the same thing that I
[32:35] did before but God made that atonement
[32:37] so they can go back and forth and they
[32:39] could do those things amen but when you
[32:42] take a a God that comes down and takes
[32:45] and eradicates that sin takes that sin
[32:48] and does away with it and then you then
[32:50] you despise that
[32:52] sacrifice see you've turned down the
[32:54] Living God right you've turned down the
[32:56] very soul of God
[32:57] all right so let's read here in
[32:59] Galatians 3 and start right
[33:02] here will you read that let me finish
[33:05] this you made an offering for sin
[33:08] why he shall see his seed what is his
[33:11] seed seed means progeny or genealogy our
[33:15] genetics he was cut off the question was
[33:18] in verse 8 who shall declare his
[33:20] generation right in other words see Josh
[33:22] declares My Generation he declares my
[33:25] next Generation because he came from me
[33:27] then when he has a son his son will
[33:29] declare his generation but what happened
[33:32] was here the way they're reading the
[33:33] scriptures Isaiah is going my goodness
[33:36] this guy's going to be slaughtered and
[33:38] who's going to declare his generation
[33:40] this guy's supposed to be the Messiah
[33:42] he's supposed to be the one that saves
[33:43] everything right and who's going to
[33:45] declare his generation right well
[33:47] there's nobody from Adam to Isaiah I
[33:51] mean from yeah from Adam to Isaiah and
[33:53] on up to Jesus that could do that right
[33:57] amen they could only look forward to
[33:59] something they couldn't look and see
[34:01] that that that man had come and made an
[34:04] offering for sin himself a human man all
[34:08] right had made a sacrifice all right so
[34:12] now he shall see his seed his seed which
[34:14] is what him made manifest in another
[34:16] form
[34:17] exactly okay right now Galatians 3 now
[34:22] to Abraham and his seed were the
[34:24] promises made he saith not into seeds as
[34:27] of many in other words not all the seeds
[34:30] of Abraham right but as of one into thy
[34:34] seed which is Christ Christ is the one
[34:38] go back to that Genesis 1: 126 and 27
[34:40] where we're at this morning there's the
[34:42] one seed but it's one seed but you plant
[34:45] that one seed that seed had to go on the
[34:47] ground right plant that one seed it
[34:49] brings out a tree that's got many many
[34:51] multiple fruits on it right so from one
[34:55] seed comes all things from God and then
[34:59] remember we talked about God loving
[35:01] Israel and Israel defiled him but in
[35:05] Daniel 9 we know that he's bringing that
[35:06] back but see that's still not Genesis
[35:08] 1:26 nothing in the Old Testament is
[35:11] talking about Genesis 1 26 and 27 they
[35:14] are something is pointing to example
[35:17] because remember they're given to
[35:20] us and us that are seed in the end time
[35:23] and even down through seven Church ages
[35:25] we all were the the seed of God are the
[35:28] seed of God and we're looking at that
[35:31] example that was down through the Old
[35:33] Testament right that's what we were
[35:36] looking at we're looking at that that
[35:38] one seed which is
[35:40] Christ all right now
[35:43] look let's go to First Timothy 1 and I
[35:46] the Lord really was gracious this
[35:50] morning cuz we read the wrong scripture
[35:52] and it fit right
[35:55] in
[35:58] I ain't telling you whose fault it
[36:00] was but there's no fault they put 1
[36:03] Timothy 4:4 and we read 1 Timothy 4:4
[36:06] and it fit right in you didn't know it
[36:07] was a wrong scripture but I was talking
[36:10] about analy genealogy well listen 1
[36:12] Timothy 1 4 through1 neither give heed
[36:15] to fables and endless genealogies now
[36:17] what's Paul telling
[36:19] them quit doing this so and so but got
[36:22] so and so and so and so but got so and
[36:24] so just because you come from you know
[36:27] they stood up and they said well we're
[36:28] Abraham's
[36:30] seed or where where're from you know
[36:33] we're Moses's children Jesus kept
[36:36] telling them said you're dead right
[36:38] they're dead what they're seed they're
[36:40] dead right now the end of the
[36:43] Commandment is Charity oh wait a minute
[36:44] neither give heed to fables and endless
[36:46] genealogies right which minister
[36:49] questions rather than Godly edifying
[36:51] which is in faith so do now the end of
[36:54] the Commandment is Charity out of a pure
[36:56] heart and of a good conscience and a
[36:58] faith unfe right from which some having
[37:02] swerved have turned aside into vain
[37:04] jangling Desiring to be teachers of the
[37:07] law remember we're back in Paul's time
[37:10] now but remember that comes up to this
[37:12] age too Desiring to be teachers of the
[37:14] law which the message is law until you
[37:16] see the grace anything's law that's
[37:20] right it's like it's like D's always
[37:22] said you're under law until you until
[37:24] you're born again amen exactly cu
[37:26] there's your condemnation right all
[37:29] right the law can't save you that's
[37:32] right law didn't save a soul in the Old
[37:34] Testament didn't save a person as far as
[37:36] New Birth salvation now it did save them
[37:38] and put them in a position in heaven
[37:41] right yeah right I'm that's what I'm
[37:43] trying to say I said this in another
[37:45] church and they questioned it but the
[37:47] Old Testament I'm not saying they were
[37:49] lost right they're not lost it's just
[37:51] like I said if you went in and made a
[37:53] sacrifice and you truly believe that
[37:56] that sacrif rice was for you and for
[37:57] your sins God forgive you right and if
[38:00] you died you went to Paradise but now
[38:03] you couldn't go in the presence of God
[38:05] you had to go to another place called
[38:06] Paradise cuz remember Jesus emptied
[38:09] Paradise out when he went into Glory so
[38:12] the law the law is carnal and all these
[38:16] things but the law is also spiritual
[38:17] that's right cuz from the law Paul wrote
[38:21] most of the New Testament from the Old
[38:23] Testament right all right remember what
[38:25] did Paul took the SC for about 14 years
[38:27] Wonder or three four five years he went
[38:30] to Egypt took the Old Testament Scrolls
[38:32] and wrote 80% of the New Testament out
[38:34] of it but we know that the law is
[38:37] good wait a minute Desiring to be
[38:39] teachers of the law understanding
[38:41] neither what they say no wherefore they
[38:43] affirm in other words just blabber it
[38:45] out but we know that the law is good
[38:48] right if a man use it lawfully that's
[38:51] right knowing this that the law is not
[38:53] made for a righteous man amen right
[38:56] there it is
[38:57] law is not made for somebody's born
[38:58] again right right but for the Lawless
[39:01] and the disobedient for the ungodly and
[39:03] for Sinners we are Unholy and profane
[39:05] murders and fathers and it just keeps
[39:07] getting worse and worse murders of
[39:09] mothers manslayers wh mongers for them
[39:11] that defile themselves of mankind men
[39:13] Stealers Liars perjured persons and if
[39:16] there be any other thing that is
[39:18] contrary to sound Doctrine Paul just put
[39:20] it all in there but look the law is good
[39:23] if a man use it lawfully amen all right
[39:26] so we're not doing away with the
[39:29] law but the law was given because of
[39:31] what transgression we'll read that in
[39:33] just a little
[39:34] bit the blood of an animal just covered
[39:36] it but the curse of the law no one was
[39:39] able to live by it that was the curse
[39:41] the curse of the law was
[39:43] death there was no Grace that's right
[39:46] you just either did it or you didn't do
[39:48] it all right there was no Grace it was
[39:50] all condemnation now let's go to number
[39:52] quote number five who it was this
[39:54] morning perfection
[39:57] so therefore when Adam and Eve had
[39:58] sinned and had transgressed the law they
[40:00] were subjects of death and the law had
[40:02] to be
[40:04] executed Jesus told him well when I say
[40:08] Jesus Christ the Creator told him this
[40:10] therefore it put all the human race
[40:12] under the penalty of death every man and
[40:15] woman child is included in the penalty
[40:16] of death by the transgression of the
[40:18] head of the human race which was Adam by
[40:21] his transgression every one of us fell
[40:23] victim to sin right and sin must be dead
[40:26] dealt with so God in his great infamy
[40:29] and his great love the law was to
[40:31] separate the sinner from his maker y
[40:34] then he become annihilated and totally
[40:35] annihilated no way for him to come back
[40:38] there was no way that that if you read
[40:40] in you we can't just we can't stop you
[40:43] can just keep reading in the New
[40:44] Testament where the the comer you know
[40:48] if he was to go to I think we got it
[40:51] we'll just wait let's go to quote number
[40:52] six I don't want to I don't want to
[40:53] misquote it I think I got it in
[40:55] Scripture God's chosen place of work
[40:58] worship not that the law could help them
[41:00] but the law only pointed out to them
[41:02] that they were wrong or Sinners until
[41:05] that time they didn't know what sin was
[41:07] so they had a
[41:08] law there cannot be a law without a
[41:10] penalty a law is not not a law without a
[41:14] penalty so therefore the transgression
[41:16] of the law is sin and the wages of sin
[41:19] is death now let's go to Romans
[41:22] 4 verse
[41:25] 12
[41:27] and the father of circumcision to them
[41:28] who are not of circumcision only but who
[41:31] also walk in the steps of that Faith of
[41:33] Our Father Abraham which he had been yet
[41:36] uncircumcised for the promise that he
[41:39] should be the heir of the world was not
[41:41] to Abraham right are to his seed through
[41:44] the law exactly but through the
[41:46] righteousness of Faith amen for if they
[41:49] which are of the LW beair faith is made
[41:52] void in other words if your dos and
[41:55] don'ts get you into Heaven there's
[41:57] nothing to do with faith you don't have
[41:59] nothing to do with faith right right
[42:01] right and the promise made of none
[42:04] effect what is the
[42:06] promise gift of the Holy Ghost yeah
[42:09] promises to you and your children then
[42:10] they're far off because the law worketh
[42:13] wrath for where no law is there is no
[42:16] transgression therefore it is of faith
[42:19] that it might be by Grace amen amen to
[42:22] the end of the promise might be sure to
[42:24] all the seed right
[42:26] Glory us the seed right the seed of God
[42:30] not to that only which is of the law but
[42:32] to that also which is of the faith of
[42:34] Abraham who is the father of us all amen
[42:38] but see now look let's go to Hebrews 10
[42:40] the law doesn't declare the generations
[42:43] of God the law declared the generations
[42:46] of Adam the generations of people the
[42:49] people that live right that come from
[42:51] Ham sham and that came back to Adam
[42:55] and Seth and
[42:56] and Methuselah and all the way Enoch and
[42:59] all the way on down right that was the
[43:01] law the law doesn't declare the
[43:03] generations of
[43:05] God grace declares the generation of God
[43:08] cuz we were all born under sin shaping
[43:10] in iniquity but watch Hebrews
[43:16] 10 for the law having a
[43:19] shadow of good things to
[43:22] come not the very image of the things so
[43:25] it wasn't the image
[43:26] it was an example or a
[43:29] shadow all right can never with those
[43:33] sacrifices which they offered year by
[43:35] year continually make the C there unto
[43:37] perfect now it covered his sin and put
[43:39] him in heaven but it didn't make him
[43:40] perfect right all right for then would
[43:43] they not have ceased to be offered right
[43:47] there'd be a time somewhere where you'd
[43:48] make the last sacrifice and you'd be
[43:50] perfect that's what it was saying but
[43:51] there's no way that can happen right not
[43:53] under the law right right amen
[43:56] for then would they have then would they
[43:59] not have ceased to be offered question
[44:01] because that the worshipper once purged
[44:04] should have had no more conscience of
[44:05] sin amen right in other words one year
[44:08] boom done finished that's not the law
[44:12] the law condemned you every year that's
[44:15] right amen but in those sacrifices there
[44:18] is a remembrance again made of sin every
[44:20] year in other words when you you know
[44:22] you knew the time was coming you started
[44:24] remembering all those sins back through
[44:26] the year righten you see what Satan's
[44:29] doing to us he's making it but that's
[44:31] right you're going to see that that's
[44:34] that should be gone that's right but in
[44:36] those sacrifices there's a remembrance
[44:38] again made of sins every year for it is
[44:40] not possible that the blood of bulls and
[44:42] of goats should take away sin right
[44:45] can't take away sin
[44:47] exactly but now look let's go to Hebrews
[44:51] 105 wherefore when he cometh into the
[44:54] world he sayth sacrifice and offerings
[44:56] thou wouldest
[44:58] not but a body hast thou
[45:01] prepared me a body thou Hast prepared me
[45:06] who built the body for Jesus to come to
[45:09] amen the prophets yeah let's go to quote
[45:12] number seven the word and the prophet
[45:15] and then came finally the great head the
[45:17] head of all of it the rest of the body
[45:19] just spoke of it the foundation was laid
[45:22] by the patriarch but the body was built
[45:24] by the word which was the
[45:27] prophets and here comes the head of it
[45:29] all Jesus come on the scene there when
[45:31] his headpiece was put upon it we find in
[45:34] him the entire handiwork of God we find
[45:37] in him the perfect reflection of the
[45:39] word for he was the word amen the
[45:41] fullness of the word now again God has
[45:44] the perfect Masterpiece again what the
[45:47] fullness of the word as Isaiah said
[45:50] behold my servant my masterpiece that I
[45:52] have portrayed through all the ages of
[45:54] this perfect one coming and and here he
[45:56] stands right here before me a perfect
[45:59] there in his own image reflecting God
[46:01] for he said in St John 14 when you see
[46:04] me you've seen the father so now let's
[46:07] bring
[46:09] remember even with Jesus on the
[46:14] earth still the Earth is cursed right
[46:18] Adam's race is still on the Earth right
[46:21] nothing really
[46:22] changes on the earth yeah right right
[46:26] and Adam all di when Jesus died even
[46:28] when he resurrected they still had
[46:30] funerals we've been still having
[46:32] funerals for 2,000 years right but where
[46:34] did the work begin it's like what
[46:36] brother Daniel said the work began
[46:38] inside this is a secret work all right
[46:40] Genesis
[46:43] 3:15 and I will put enity between thee
[46:46] and the woman and between thy seed and
[46:47] her seed right and it shall bruise thy
[46:49] head and thou shalt bruise his heel the
[46:51] promise of a seed coming amen her seed
[46:56] the woman's seed seed of the woman which
[46:58] is who Jesus Christ Galatians
[47:04] 3 and the law is not of Faith the man
[47:08] but the man that doeth them shall live
[47:10] in them right no words man do the law
[47:13] she live in the law Christ has redeemed
[47:15] us from the curse of the law amen what
[47:19] was the curse of the law death that's
[47:21] right being made a curse for us right
[47:25] for it is WR and cursed is everyone that
[47:26] HTH on a tree that the blessings of
[47:29] Abraham might come on the Gentiles this
[47:32] is us through Christ Jesus that we we
[47:36] might receive the what promise of the
[47:39] the promise of the spirit through faith
[47:42] Brethren I speak after the manner of men
[47:45] though it be but a man's
[47:49] Covenant yet if it be confirmed right no
[47:53] man dis knowledge or added to amen
[47:56] now Abraham and his seed were the
[47:57] promises made he set not the seeds of
[47:59] the many but the one what that one man
[48:01] confirmed the Covenant
[48:04] right Christ that's right not Abraham
[48:07] they made a covenant with Abraham but
[48:09] but Abraham didn't fulfill the whole
[48:11] Covenant the circumcision was a type
[48:14] that's right we supposed to have the
[48:16] promise of circumcision in the heart
[48:18] amen that's the promise the promise
[48:20] wasn't because Abraham
[48:23] died Abraham died
[48:26] and then there was another one and he
[48:27] died then there was another one and he
[48:28] died what that was natural those Jews
[48:31] could say hey we're part of the promise
[48:35] right
[48:37] sure let's just be honest you can take
[48:39] them behind the building and show them
[48:41] that they were circumcised so they're
[48:43] they're in the Covenant right yeah they
[48:46] can show it that's why when we're
[48:48] circumcised by the Holy Ghost we're
[48:49] supposed to be able to show it we're
[48:52] supposed to be able to show that we're
[48:53] circumcised not naturally but
[48:54] spiritually
[48:56] all the flesh has been cut away right
[48:58] but they could show them they could show
[49:00] them hey this is what we're hanging
[49:02] on we're hanging on this that Abraham
[49:05] had a covenant that he was circumcised
[49:07] and that circumcision put us in that
[49:09] Covenant right made us God's chosen
[49:12] people amen but when the one that made
[49:16] the
[49:17] Covenant
[49:19] came remember when Jesus come before him
[49:23] he said you got a cloak had a cloak for
[49:24] your sins but now you have one right I'm
[49:27] I'm the one that made the Covenant I'm
[49:29] the one that's doing it and it's one
[49:31] seed which is Christ and I'm the one
[49:33] that's doing it so now things have got
[49:35] to what things got to
[49:37] change things got to change Galatians
[49:43] 4 to redeem them that were under the law
[49:46] Christ came that we might receive the
[49:48] adoption of sons and because you are
[49:50] Sons God has sent forth the spirit of
[49:52] his son into your hearts crying ABA
[49:54] father to redeem them that were under
[49:56] the law right now
[50:03] look answer the phone Galatians 4 to
[50:08] redeem them that were under the
[50:12] law so we were under the
[50:14] law till Christ come right all right so
[50:19] now that's
[50:21] why that the New
[50:23] Testament didn't begin
[50:26] until the book of Acts
[50:29] right cuz Matthew Mark Luke and John was
[50:32] a commentary of Jesus's life under the
[50:37] law he was born under the
[50:40] law to what to redeem them that were
[50:42] under the law amen all right he come to
[50:47] get us out of the
[50:50] law thank you
[50:53] Jesus who was he John 1
[50:56] this is him right here in the beginning
[50:59] was the word and the Word was with God
[51:00] and the Word was God exactly the same
[51:03] was in the beginning with God all things
[51:05] were made by him and without him was not
[51:07] anything made that was made verse
[51:12] 14 and the Word was made flesh right the
[51:17] seed was made flesh amen seed is the
[51:20] word right and the seed was made I'm not
[51:23] changing am I cuz the Bible says we're
[51:26] going to read it in a little bit where
[51:27] the Bible says that the seed of God is
[51:29] the word of God and the Word was made
[51:31] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[51:33] his glory the glory of the only begotten
[51:36] of the father
[51:38] right begotten of the father right full
[51:42] of grace and truth right this was Jesus
[51:44] Christ amen
[51:46] now we got to move over into his time
[51:49] now right Revelations
[51:53] 3:14 and to the angel of Church of the L
[51:55] of sin see this is a special message to
[51:57] us amen right not the other ages this is
[52:01] a special message to us because we must
[52:04] realize what part of the creation we're
[52:06] at or we're from right yeah Luther
[52:09] didn't really have to he had to
[52:11] understand where he was at but you and I
[52:13] have got to understand that the
[52:15] beginning of the creation of God and if
[52:17] we're the rest of that creation where
[52:19] are the back end of that creation the
[52:21] last of it right amen yeah there there's
[52:25] no other age right there's nobody going
[52:27] to be G people will be given eternal
[52:29] life at the white Throne judgment that's
[52:30] foolish virgins that's people not in the
[52:32] body we're talking about God's people
[52:35] God's children God's family we're it
[52:39] amen and to the angel of the Church of
[52:41] the layout of sins right these things
[52:42] sayith the amen the faithful and true
[52:45] witness the beginning of the creation of
[52:48] God when Jesus Christ came the prophet
[52:50] said when Jesus Christ came that was the
[52:52] beginning that's the way God wanted it
[52:55] in the beginning exactly God wanted that
[52:59] to be that way in the beginning that's
[53:01] right what egg and germ spoken into
[53:05] existence in a womb baby comes
[53:10] forth
[53:13] okay but now
[53:16] look nobody could receive eternal life
[53:19] in their soul until the possessor of
[53:21] that book came back that's right that's
[53:25] right
[53:26] you never saw there there was no
[53:27] commentary in the book of the Old
[53:29] Testament that's right of a book of life
[53:32] right or written in the
[53:36] book right right right you do it in the
[53:39] New Testament that's right but not in
[53:41] the old cuz this book
[53:43] disappeared this book was Jehovah
[53:46] God Amen a father with his family but
[53:49] there was no way to get his family out
[53:51] because remember he had to close the
[53:53] book right see seal it up that's right
[53:57] y even in Daniel it talks about sealing
[54:00] of the book until what time of the end
[54:02] right so he sealed the book back up and
[54:05] there was only one kid born out of that
[54:07] book Adam and he wasn't born he was
[54:09] given eternal life but he was a Son of
[54:11] God he didn't have eternal life in his
[54:12] soul the way God wanted it but he wanted
[54:16] children so the family album was sealed
[54:18] up put back in the hands of god Jehovah
[54:22] right he held on to it and he get he
[54:25] gave permissive will down through the
[54:26] Old
[54:27] Testament right that's right he allowed
[54:30] Isaiah and Jeremiah but he was telling
[54:33] Isaiah and Jeremiah what to say yes
[54:36] right so you still we're still being
[54:38] born by the spoken word amen we're still
[54:40] listening to what God wanted to begin
[54:42] with he wanted to talk to us yes I told
[54:47] him up in um up in U Virginia we were
[54:50] talking about text messaging and I just
[54:52] have got started where I can just barely
[54:54] you ought to see some of the textes i
[54:56] s you have to erase them every once in a
[54:59] while cuz you hit the wrong button but I
[55:01] told him I said you know what God
[55:02] thought so much of us he didn't just
[55:04] send it in the air wve he sent us a text
[55:06] message he wrote it down send it to us
[55:11] then he sent us 1160 more right that
[55:15] clarified the first one he sent the 66
[55:18] books he sent he sent us 1100 sermon to
[55:20] clarify what this said right but the
[55:22] book was closed y
[55:29] the testator the one that held the
[55:31] Testament and testament means Covenant
[55:34] right the one that holds the
[55:37] Covenant had to
[55:39] die yes to release it back to us that's
[55:42] right right that's right that's why they
[55:44] had to be the death of a testator amen
[55:47] the testator had to die sure to release
[55:51] the book right that is a new testament
[55:54] right the Old Testament or the old
[55:57] Covenant started when God slayed the
[56:00] lamb and give it the Skins to Adam and
[56:04] Eve that was really the first testament
[56:07] that was the Old Testament where they
[56:08] were covered the New Testament or the
[56:11] death of the testator a person not a
[56:13] lamb a person a person died that's why
[56:17] he gave his soul a ransom amen the goats
[56:20] can't give their soul a ransom the lamb
[56:22] can't give their soul a ransom but man
[56:25] can say in Genesis 3 I'll put enmity in
[56:28] other words I can't believe I can't get
[56:31] you to do it so I'm going to do it right
[56:35] my own self that's right cuz I'm the
[56:38] only one that holds a book right this is
[56:40] the book of eternal life right amen
[56:42] eternal life is in this book right here
[56:45] right this is what we feed off of right
[56:46] here right all right so the man that had
[56:49] this book held on to it
[56:52] right let's look at quote number eight
[57:03] L out to see in church
[57:04] age but but now he is standing in the
[57:07] midst of the church as he stands there
[57:10] revealing who he is in this last age he
[57:14] calls himself the author of the creation
[57:16] of God Amen this is another creation
[57:23] Glory this has to do with the church
[57:26] right this is a special designation of
[57:30] himself now I know that he started
[57:33] letting that Genesis 126 out he started
[57:36] opening this book a little bit on the
[57:39] day of Pentecost 120 in the upper room
[57:42] then 3,000 downstairs sure he was
[57:44] letting a little bit out at at a time a
[57:46] little bit a little bit a little bit but
[57:49] when it comes down to us it's supposed
[57:51] to be the whole book right John didn't
[57:54] say eat three Pages out of the book John
[57:56] said the angel told him to eat the whole
[57:57] book all right so we got to eat the
[57:59] whole book this is another
[58:02] creation let's be honest with ourselves
[58:04] you think you're special sister this
[58:06] whole creation's waiting on the people
[58:08] that are still alive to get them out of
[58:10] the ground right this is another
[58:13] creation this has to do with the church
[58:16] this is a special designation of himself
[58:18] right he is the creator of that church
[58:21] exactly the Heavenly bridegroom created
[58:24] his own bride amen as the spirit of God
[58:28] he came down and created in the Virgin
[58:30] Mary the cells from which his body was
[58:32] born I want to repeat that he created
[58:37] the very CS in the womb of Mary for that
[58:40] body it was not enough for the Holy
[58:43] Spirit to Simply give life to a human
[58:44] oam supplied by Mary that would have
[58:48] been sinful mankind producing the body
[58:50] Adam's
[58:52] race Adam's race everybody get that
[58:54] right this had to be another creation a
[58:58] special designation of himself not using
[59:01] the old creation not using it cuz it was
[59:04] dead amen now we know God can take life
[59:08] out of death but this was dead right he'
[59:11] already cursed this part exactly he
[59:14] couldn't take that curse off either
[59:15] until he did something wait he couldn't
[59:17] do it but watch cuz remember we got to
[59:20] realize that when he came out of that
[59:22] grave he took that curse off but we got
[59:24] to take that
[59:26] pardon we got to accept that
[59:28] pardon Jesus signed my pardon this I
[59:32] surely
[59:34] know that day he died at Calvary so that
[59:37] I didn't have to go right as the spirit
[59:40] of God he came down and created in the
[59:41] Virgin Mary the cells from which his
[59:43] body was born I want to repeat that he
[59:45] created the very cells in the womb of
[59:48] Mary for that body what was that spoken
[59:51] word there's the Original Seed all right
[59:54] it was not enough for the Holy Spirit to
[59:56] Simply give life to a human oam supplied
[59:59] by Mary that would have been sinful
[1:00:01] mankind producing a body right right
[1:00:04] that would not have produced the last
[1:00:07] atam what's he saying the first Adam
[1:00:09] produced death
[1:00:10] right the last Adam produced life okay
[1:00:14] of him it was said low a body H has now
[1:00:17] father prepared for me we read that a
[1:00:19] minute ago God not Mary provided that
[1:00:22] body Mary was the human incubator
[1:00:25] and she carried that holy child and
[1:00:27] brought him to birth it was a God man he
[1:00:30] was the son of God he was of the new
[1:00:33] creation that's why he didn't need a new
[1:00:37] birth right that's why he told Nicodemus
[1:00:39] which was born under Adam's race he said
[1:00:42] you need a new birth you need to be born
[1:00:47] again so Nicodemus gets carnal and says
[1:00:51] do I have he knew where he came from the
[1:00:52] first time right and he was getting
[1:00:55] pretty old that's right so he knew where
[1:00:57] he was coming from he said you may not
[1:00:59] got to Jesus said you got to be born
[1:01:01] from above that's right amen not down
[1:01:03] here this is earthy read that we're not
[1:01:05] going to have time to read that I wanted
[1:01:06] to read it but read there in Corinthians
[1:01:08] where it talks about the earthy the
[1:01:10] first man Earth he the first man Adam
[1:01:12] all right read about that he was of the
[1:01:14] new creation man and God met and joined
[1:01:18] he was the first of this new race do you
[1:01:21] know what man has been looking for a
[1:01:25] perfect race since the dawn of time why
[1:01:28] do you think of all this uh ethic
[1:01:31] cleansing that goes on in all these
[1:01:34] countries never know it could have went
[1:01:36] on here in the United States but they
[1:01:38] were trying to make Hitler was trying to
[1:01:41] produce a super race that's right why
[1:01:45] it's the pull they feel that's right
[1:01:47] they know there's a new race that's
[1:01:49] going to inhabit this
[1:01:51] Earth and you some of these movies you
[1:01:54] just watch some of them you say Well
[1:01:56] they're trying to get what God's already
[1:01:58] said we were going to do but they're
[1:01:59] trying to get it carnal all right he was
[1:02:02] the first of this new race he is the
[1:02:04] head of this new race Colossians 11:18
[1:02:07] he is the head of the body of the church
[1:02:09] who is the beginning the first born from
[1:02:11] the dead so he was the first one
[1:02:15] up that in all things he might have the
[1:02:17] preeminence 2 Corinthians 5:17 therefore
[1:02:20] for any man be in Christ he is a new
[1:02:23] creation old old things have passed away
[1:02:25] behold all things are become new there
[1:02:29] you can see that though man was of the
[1:02:31] old order adamic right old order or
[1:02:36] creation Now in Union with Christ he has
[1:02:39] become the new creation of God Ephesians
[1:02:43] 2:10 for we are his workmanship created
[1:02:45] in Union with Christ Jesus unto good
[1:02:48] words Ephesians 4:24 and that you put on
[1:02:51] the new man which after God is created
[1:02:54] in righteousness and true Holiness this
[1:02:56] new creation is not the old creation
[1:02:58] made over
[1:03:00] amen he's going to change you in your
[1:03:02] atoms Glory you're going to be changed
[1:03:06] your genetic makeup yeah you may keep
[1:03:09] the same features that you have right
[1:03:11] and you will blacks will be blacks
[1:03:13] whites will be whites different
[1:03:16] different color hair right all them will
[1:03:18] be different but but what God done is
[1:03:21] God took that picture of you when you
[1:03:24] were
[1:03:25] in your Prime of Life yeah let me tell
[1:03:27] you something God thought so much of you
[1:03:30] till brother R even says he took this
[1:03:31] one and bred them to this one this one
[1:03:33] to this one this one to this one this
[1:03:35] one this one to get you
[1:03:37] here he watched the whole thing come
[1:03:40] down through time and you know what he's
[1:03:42] not looking at your neighbor that way
[1:03:45] your neighbor just came because a man
[1:03:46] and a woman got together one day right
[1:03:49] that's right right that's right but when
[1:03:50] you come here and you have the new birth
[1:03:52] and you become a part of this new
[1:03:53] creation
[1:03:55] this new creation of God glory that
[1:03:58] takes all genetics out of the way now
[1:04:00] there's certain things that you can that
[1:04:02] you're you know like me I'm I love to
[1:04:04] hunt I love to talk that God didn't take
[1:04:06] that away he just tries to use it I said
[1:04:09] tries he tries to use it for his good
[1:04:12] all right that's exactly what it
[1:04:14] says this new creation is not the old
[1:04:17] creation made over or it wouldn't be
[1:04:19] called a new creation that's
[1:04:21] right this is exactly what it says it is
[1:04:24] New Creation right it is another
[1:04:27] creation distinct from the old
[1:04:30] one that's
[1:04:32] right separate no longer is he dealing
[1:04:36] by ways of the
[1:04:38] flesh that's how he dealt with
[1:04:40] Israel Adam's race coming right down
[1:04:43] through time all right he chose Abraham
[1:04:46] and of Abraham's issue Through The Godly
[1:04:48] Isaac Lon but now out of every Kindred
[1:04:51] tribe and Nation he has purposed a new
[1:04:55] creation he is the first of that
[1:04:58] creation he was God created in the form
[1:05:00] of man now by his Spirit he is creating
[1:05:03] many sons unto himself God the Creator
[1:05:07] creating himself a part of his creation
[1:05:10] Hallelujah one more time God the Creator
[1:05:12] the one that created all things created
[1:05:15] himself a part of his own what Genesis
[1:05:17] 1:26 if that ain't got Genesis 126 wrote
[1:05:20] all over it amen there's not a quote in
[1:05:23] the in the message
[1:05:24] that's right if fact don't have Genesis
[1:05:26] 1 written all over that is what he done
[1:05:28] he took a part of himself put it aside
[1:05:31] right here wrote it in a book A book of
[1:05:37] names and he said this is going to be my
[1:05:39] children I'm going to start with him but
[1:05:42] he's not going to be able to he's not
[1:05:43] going to be able to finish it but I'm
[1:05:45] going to finish
[1:05:46] it hey the one that wrote it the one
[1:05:50] that created it is the one that's going
[1:05:52] to finish it Glory all right exactly and
[1:05:54] that way there's no
[1:05:56] mistakes we make mistakes but in this
[1:05:58] Godly line in that Godly creation
[1:06:00] there's no mistakes in there we're not
[1:06:02] going to get in we're not going to get
[1:06:04] in and not have our name written in that
[1:06:05] book that's right now by his Spirit he
[1:06:07] is creating many sons unto himself God
[1:06:09] the Creator creating himself a part of
[1:06:11] his creation this is the true revelation
[1:06:13] of God Amen this was his purpose from
[1:06:18] geneses this was his purpose this
[1:06:21] purpose took form through election that
[1:06:23] is why he look right down to the last
[1:06:25] age when all would be over right this is
[1:06:29] a long quote but I like it and see
[1:06:32] himself still in the midst of the church
[1:06:34] as author of this new creation of God
[1:06:36] his Sovereign power brought it to pass
[1:06:39] by his own decree he elected the members
[1:06:42] of this new creation Genesis 1:26 and 27
[1:06:45] he predestinated them to the adoption of
[1:06:48] children according to the good pleasure
[1:06:49] of his will by his omniscience and
[1:06:52] omnipotence he brought it to pass how
[1:06:54] else could he know that he would be
[1:06:56] standing in the midst of the church
[1:06:57] receiving Glory from his Brethren if he
[1:06:59] did not make sure right all things he
[1:07:03] knew and all things he worked out
[1:07:05] according to what he knew in order that
[1:07:08] his purpose and good pleasure be brought
[1:07:10] to pass Ephesians 2:1 whom also we have
[1:07:12] obtained an inheritance being
[1:07:14] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:07:15] of his will who worketh all things after
[1:07:17] the Council of his own will Hallelujah
[1:07:20] aren't you glad you belong to
[1:07:22] him who's him Christ Jesus right so he
[1:07:26] started his family now we got to
[1:07:28] hurry in this man this creation right in
[1:07:33] this man was all the genetic strain of
[1:07:37] God right amen right where did the body
[1:07:40] come
[1:07:42] from somebody say it where' the body
[1:07:45] come from a body thou has prepared me
[1:07:48] that's right the Father the Creator the
[1:07:51] Creator created himself on and it says
[1:07:53] right here the Creator created him his
[1:07:56] own self he didn't create himself he
[1:07:58] created himself in creation all right so
[1:08:01] he produced the body no genetics on the
[1:08:05] earth
[1:08:06] none none whatsoever right made sure
[1:08:10] that by both egg and and and germ being
[1:08:15] created he has no ties to this race
[1:08:19] that's why he's the beginning of the
[1:08:20] creation of God cuz that's the way God
[1:08:23] wanted it to start with all right now
[1:08:30] look go to Matthew
[1:08:37] 13:37 here I want you to see
[1:08:41] something he is not only cuz remember we
[1:08:43] read in the beginning was the word right
[1:08:46] amen he's not only the S but he's the
[1:08:49] seed that's right sure amen that's right
[1:08:53] he's going to make sure that's right
[1:08:55] he's going to make sure he's the
[1:08:58] SE cuz remember what's the seed the word
[1:09:01] in the beginning was the word was with
[1:09:05] and the Word
[1:09:06] was so it's both the so and the seed how
[1:09:09] can he lose he's not going to that's
[1:09:12] right amen he answered and said unto
[1:09:15] them he that sth the good seed is the
[1:09:18] son of man that was God in human flesh
[1:09:20] that's that new creation right there
[1:09:22] okay right that's the new creation the
[1:09:25] son of man God in human flesh that's the
[1:09:27] the new creation the start of it all
[1:09:30] right Luke
[1:09:32] 8:1 now the parable is this the seed is
[1:09:34] the word of God I kind of broke these
[1:09:36] it's the same one but it's in two
[1:09:38] different two different U chapters here
[1:09:41] now the parable is this the seed is the
[1:09:42] word of God so what is the seed word of
[1:09:45] God what's the sword son of man all
[1:09:47] right right so now he preached the
[1:09:50] word but now look he didn't have have
[1:09:54] any genetic children Earthly that's
[1:09:57] right
[1:09:58] Jesus that's why the Bible says who can
[1:10:01] declare this generation there's no seed
[1:10:03] right there's no natural genetics that's
[1:10:06] why them priests they you know they they
[1:10:08] could pass their lineage back 500
[1:10:11] generation clean as a pen and here comes
[1:10:14] this man walks up he ain't got a wife
[1:10:17] that's
[1:10:19] right they said he was illegitimate
[1:10:22] born and here he walks up in the
[1:10:25] temple and he starts talking about
[1:10:27] having these children and having this
[1:10:31] Kingdom and having this this and
[1:10:35] have hey
[1:10:37] buddy who's declaring your
[1:10:40] generation my daddy declared mine and he
[1:10:43] said yeah your daddy
[1:10:45] did not your natural daddy right your
[1:10:48] daddy's declaring your generation for
[1:10:50] sure that's what he was saying but they
[1:10:52] said and said look
[1:10:54] where's your genealogy where's your we
[1:10:57] not be born of fornication like you cuz
[1:11:00] that fornication cut cut his lineage off
[1:11:03] really cuz you couldn't go into the
[1:11:04] temple if you were if you committed
[1:11:05] fornication or committed adultery and
[1:11:07] had a bastor job it took 400 years to
[1:11:10] get that out so they knew he' cut
[1:11:13] himself off if he was born illegitimate
[1:11:15] cuz that's what they were saying he's
[1:11:16] born
[1:11:17] illegitimate that's what they said so
[1:11:19] that cut him off from everything so they
[1:11:22] were looking at a man and he was totally
[1:11:24] powerless to them really to look for for
[1:11:28] the Pharisees and Sadducees to look at
[1:11:29] Jesus here come this man that walks up
[1:11:32] he can't even go in the temple for 400
[1:11:33] years he ain't got a wife he ain't got
[1:11:36] no children and here he talks about
[1:11:38] having all these young on and having
[1:11:40] this and having that you must be born
[1:11:41] again and you must be this you must be
[1:11:43] that a swer Goes Forth and sews a
[1:11:46] seed that's right the children of the
[1:11:49] Kingdom he said Children of the Kingdom
[1:11:52] you don't even have a wife yeah so they
[1:11:54] thought he was totally cut off they just
[1:11:57] didn't
[1:11:58] realize it wasn't by sex
[1:12:01] anymore it wasn't by what man would see
[1:12:04] a woman and man get together and have
[1:12:06] this generation a woman and man to get
[1:12:08] together and have this generation he was
[1:12:11] the generation the beginning of the
[1:12:13] generation of God he was the beginning
[1:12:16] of the reging of the
[1:12:18] Earth the right way that's
[1:12:21] right right right yeah
[1:12:25] yeah
[1:12:27] but where was his
[1:12:29] life his life was in his blood right
[1:12:33] right right right the life of the blood
[1:12:35] of the animals in the Old Testament
[1:12:37] couldn't come back onto the believer and
[1:12:39] make them different that's right right
[1:12:42] but this man had the life eternal life
[1:12:46] in him now let's read one quote right
[1:12:47] here and then I want to go to Hebrews 9
[1:12:49] and read that the law having a shadow he
[1:12:52] said on
[1:12:54] man all on own goodness all on work no
[1:12:58] Grace you see all on goodness what a man
[1:13:02] can do if a man can if a man lives good
[1:13:05] enough to that he'd be God himself if he
[1:13:08] could live good enough if a man lives
[1:13:09] good enough he'd be God himself if he
[1:13:11] could live good enough I said look life
[1:13:14] lays in the blood cell and without the
[1:13:16] shedding of blood there's no remission
[1:13:18] of sin right innocent substitute has to
[1:13:21] take a guilty Sinner's Place y oh I want
[1:13:24] you to get this now notice an innocent
[1:13:26] substitute must take the guilty one's
[1:13:28] place and it happened in Eden that same
[1:13:32] way right right that's when Adam sinned
[1:13:37] he cut off his fellowship with God the
[1:13:40] father and when he had sinned before he
[1:13:43] could stand before God God had to kill
[1:13:45] some sheep perhaps whatever it was and
[1:13:47] make a covering blood had to be offered
[1:13:50] in substance because the Bloods were
[1:13:53] life lays and God required life at sin
[1:13:58] amen now let's read what this man Jesus
[1:14:02] we kind of running through here
[1:14:05] quick that was quote number
[1:14:09] nine all right listen to
[1:14:13] this without the shedding of
[1:14:16] blood there was no remission of sin the
[1:14:20] law having a shadow of good things to
[1:14:21] come every lamb that died under the law
[1:14:24] was pointing to the Lamb of God at
[1:14:26] Calvary and through the power of the
[1:14:29] resurrection of deity
[1:14:33] itself pretty
[1:14:35] powerful that ain't an animal right and
[1:14:38] through the power of the resurrection of
[1:14:41] deity itself raised up his body for it
[1:14:44] was not possible that it should be a
[1:14:46] holder of it for David said in the
[1:14:48] spirit I not leave my Holy One see
[1:14:50] corruption neither will I leave his soul
[1:14:52] in hell so he rose up on the on the
[1:14:53] third day for our justification
[1:14:55] promising the promise of the father I'll
[1:14:57] send the Holy Ghost upon you which will
[1:15:00] abide with you forever even the spirit
[1:15:01] of Truth who the world cannot receive
[1:15:04] and
[1:15:05] tonight the Blessed holy spirit is in
[1:15:08] this building tonight in the power of
[1:15:11] the resurrection of the anti Tite of
[1:15:13] every lamb that died even from the
[1:15:16] Garden of Eden Jesus Christ the same
[1:15:18] yesterday today and forever Christ dying
[1:15:20] for Sinners dying for sickness God be
[1:15:23] blessed forever for his mercy and his
[1:15:26] goodness now let's go to Hebrews 9 I
[1:15:28] want to read this right here and listen
[1:15:29] to all the
[1:15:32] words of this
[1:15:36] scripture I Circle this in my Bible a
[1:15:39] long time ago listen to this but Christ
[1:15:41] being coming high priest of good things
[1:15:43] to come by a greater and more perfect
[1:15:46] Tabernacle what the one not made with
[1:15:48] hands the one that was God Almighty amen
[1:15:52] not made with hands that is to say not
[1:15:54] of this building neither by the blood of
[1:15:56] bull of goats and calves but by his own
[1:16:00] blood he entered in once into the holy
[1:16:02] Place having obtained and I Circle this
[1:16:05] word
[1:16:07] Eternal blood of bulls and goats doesn't
[1:16:10] give you Eternal anything but this man
[1:16:12] shedding his blood having obtained
[1:16:14] Eternal Redemption for us that's we're
[1:16:18] not finished for if the blood of bulls
[1:16:21] and ghosts and the ashes of heer
[1:16:22] sprinkled the unclean sanctify to the
[1:16:25] purifying of the Flesh in other words if
[1:16:26] all that Sanctified you how much more
[1:16:29] shall the blood of Christ who threw the
[1:16:31] Eternal our underline all these Eternal
[1:16:34] eternal spirit offered himself without
[1:16:36] spot to God Purge your conscious from
[1:16:39] dead Works to serve the Living God how
[1:16:41] much more should this blood and for this
[1:16:44] cause he is a mediator of the New
[1:16:47] Testament that by means of death so the
[1:16:51] New Testament could have not be begun
[1:16:53] until after he
[1:16:56] died cuz you're still under the old
[1:16:58] order the old blood of bulls and goat he
[1:17:01] had to shed his blood to make a new
[1:17:03] testament the death of the testator and
[1:17:07] for this cause he is the mediator of the
[1:17:09] New Testament that by means of death for
[1:17:11] the Redemption of the transgressions
[1:17:13] that were under the first testament what
[1:17:15] the Old Testament they which are called
[1:17:19] might receive the promise of Eternal how
[1:17:21] many more times we want to say is
[1:17:23] inheritance for where a testament is our
[1:17:28] covenant same thing for where a
[1:17:30] testament is there must also of
[1:17:32] necessity be the death of the testator
[1:17:36] for a testament is a force after men are
[1:17:39] dead
[1:17:41] okay otherwise it is of no strength at
[1:17:44] all while the testator
[1:17:47] liveth Christ was born under the law yes
[1:17:51] right every every time he would do
[1:17:53] something in the in the in the Matthew
[1:17:55] Mark Luke and John he'd tell them go do
[1:17:57] the law of Moses go do the purification
[1:17:59] go do the and he was in the temple for a
[1:18:01] lot of those things himself he was there
[1:18:04] why he was born under the law right amen
[1:18:07] he didn't make himself any better than
[1:18:08] anybody else right every time they had
[1:18:11] those feasts and those days Jesus was in
[1:18:14] that Temple amen right he went to church
[1:18:18] right pray testimony of force after men
[1:18:21] are dead otherwise it is no strength all
[1:18:23] while the testator liveth whereupon
[1:18:25] neither the first testament was
[1:18:27] dedicated without blood it wasn't
[1:18:29] because remember God did what he did in
[1:18:31] the old first of the Old Testament for
[1:18:33] when Moses had spoken every precept to
[1:18:35] all the people according to the law he
[1:18:36] took the blood of Cavs and of goats with
[1:18:38] water Scarlet wool HS up sprinkled both
[1:18:41] book both the book and all the people
[1:18:43] saying this is the blood of the
[1:18:44] testament which God hath enjoined unto
[1:18:46] you moreover he sprinkled with blood
[1:18:49] both the Tabernacle and all the vessels
[1:18:50] of the ministry and almost all all
[1:18:53] things that are by the law purged with
[1:18:55] blood and without shedding of blood
[1:18:57] there's no remission amen so without
[1:18:59] shedding of blood there's no remission
[1:19:00] of sin right all right so this is
[1:19:03] Elementary but it's bringing to
[1:19:06] view what Christ actually did right why
[1:19:09] this Resurrection had to happen and
[1:19:11] we're going to have to go a little bit
[1:19:12] longer today to get into get to the
[1:19:14] resurrection are we going to have him
[1:19:15] resurrecting on a on a Monday yeah all
[1:19:19] right Matthew
[1:19:21] 26
[1:19:24] this is in the upper
[1:19:26] room this is the last thing Jesus did
[1:19:29] before he went to Gethsemane and as they
[1:19:31] were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed
[1:19:33] it and break it and gave it to the
[1:19:34] disciples said take eat this is my body
[1:19:36] and he took the cup and gave thanks and
[1:19:38] gave it to them saying drink ye all of
[1:19:39] it for this is my blood of the New
[1:19:42] Testament people in the message would
[1:19:44] just read the
[1:19:45] Bible That's
[1:19:47] Right ouch right brother deck ouch if I
[1:19:52] just read Bible
[1:19:54] right the Bible will explain it to you
[1:19:57] that don't really take a
[1:19:59] revelation for this is my blood of the
[1:20:01] new
[1:20:03] testament which is shed for many for the
[1:20:05] remission of sin 50 days later started
[1:20:08] the New Testament right cuz when he
[1:20:10] remember he died close to it but when he
[1:20:11] died remember that he resurrected was
[1:20:13] here 40 days and he said in 10 more days
[1:20:15] at day of Pentecost 50 days later the
[1:20:18] day of Pentecost is when the New
[1:20:20] Testament began be can't right began to
[1:20:25] happen all right cuz what he done his
[1:20:28] blood is shed what he took all the sins
[1:20:29] away and he said I'm going to send back
[1:20:31] a comforter he'd already told him
[1:20:34] that I got to
[1:20:38] hurry so now let's go to John
[1:20:42] 12 verse
[1:20:44] 23 Jesus answered them saying the hour
[1:20:46] has come the son of man should be
[1:20:48] glorified I want you to look at that
[1:20:51] word this this is going this is toward
[1:20:53] the end all right this is heading toward
[1:20:56] the end of his life and Jesus answered
[1:20:58] them saying the hour has come that the
[1:20:59] son of man should be glorified remember
[1:21:01] that I'll come back to it in just a
[1:21:03] second ver verely I say unto you except
[1:21:05] a corn of wheat fall in the ground and
[1:21:07] die one grain a corn of wheat it abideth
[1:21:13] alone but if it die it bring forth much
[1:21:16] fruit what I'm theine you and the
[1:21:18] branches read the whole read Matthew AR
[1:21:20] look and John right he that loveth life
[1:21:23] shall lose it he that hateth his life in
[1:21:25] this world shall keep it unto life
[1:21:27] eternal and if any man serve me let him
[1:21:29] follow me where I am there shall also my
[1:21:31] servant be and if any man serve me him
[1:21:34] will my father honor now is my soul
[1:21:37] troubled right remember he gave his soul
[1:21:41] a ransom
[1:21:42] right when he sees the travail of his
[1:21:45] soul he'll see his
[1:21:47] seed all right he speaks into just a few
[1:21:51] days later he he's fixing to 50 days
[1:21:53] later he's fixing to see his seed come
[1:21:55] forth now is my soul troubled and what
[1:21:57] shall I say father save me from this
[1:22:00] hour but for this cause came I unto this
[1:22:04] hour now go to John
[1:22:09] 739 but this he spake of the spirit this
[1:22:12] is Jesus talking about uh something and
[1:22:15] then this is where you get your where
[1:22:17] John comes in and puts in parentheses
[1:22:19] but this spake he of the spirit which
[1:22:21] they that believe on him should receive
[1:22:24] for the Holy Ghost was not yet given
[1:22:27] because that Jesus has not yet was not
[1:22:30] yet
[1:22:30] glorified what did he just say there in
[1:22:32] John 12 talking about glorify he's
[1:22:35] getting ready to the glory of Jesus is
[1:22:38] what him dying shedding his life and
[1:22:42] getting his kids out that's the glory
[1:22:45] and that's why that there's the Holy
[1:22:47] Ghost was not given to anybody in a new
[1:22:50] birth form right amen until the day of
[1:22:54] Pentecost the Bible proves it I don't
[1:22:58] have to just sit up here and make quotes
[1:23:00] and make statements the Bible proves it
[1:23:02] that's the two points I wanted to prove
[1:23:04] today number one about what happened in
[1:23:05] the garden and number two about this
[1:23:08] many people believe that that
[1:23:11] uh that they had the new birth like we
[1:23:14] did or the Holy Ghost like we did in the
[1:23:15] Old Testament there's no way they could
[1:23:17] have
[1:23:19] right their sins were only covered their
[1:23:22] sins weren't done away with right it was
[1:23:25] only
[1:23:27] covered but Jesus look at Matthew
[1:23:31] 20:28 we'll be all right even as the son
[1:23:34] of man came not to be ministered unto
[1:23:36] but to minister and to give his life a
[1:23:40] ransom for many amen now how did he give
[1:23:43] his life died on the cross couple days
[1:23:46] ago 2,000 years ago right but now he
[1:23:49] gave his life a
[1:23:51] ransom so where did he go he went to
[1:23:54] hell preached to the people in hell
[1:23:58] right was an animal this was the soul of
[1:24:01] a man exactly this was the soul of the
[1:24:03] man amen this was the soul of the
[1:24:05] Eternal man look at all those eternals
[1:24:07] that was in there in the book of uh John
[1:24:10] when we read it there I believe it was
[1:24:12] no Hebrews 9:
[1:24:14] 11-22 everything about this man was
[1:24:16] eternal you said well his body was dying
[1:24:18] yeah his body was dying because he was
[1:24:20] born in under the law right he's born
[1:24:24] out of the curse but he wasn't born out
[1:24:25] of this cursed earth right exactly but
[1:24:27] remember at Calvary when his blood
[1:24:29] gripped down on the earth he cleansed
[1:24:33] and claimed every one of you sitting
[1:24:36] here today exactly he was claiming his
[1:24:39] new creation Glory his new race was
[1:24:42] being claimed at
[1:24:44] Calvary yeah amen he claimed you right
[1:24:48] Sanctified you and you weren't even
[1:24:50] nowhere around right
[1:24:53] thank you Jesus God's Eternal Word is
[1:24:56] going to make itself manifest whether we
[1:24:59] want to or not it's our decision whether
[1:25:02] we want to hook up to it or not it's our
[1:25:05] decision whether like brother Brown said
[1:25:07] we we've come down here to make our
[1:25:08] choice right God's going to have a bride
[1:25:11] God's going to have a new creation but
[1:25:13] he wants us to be able to make a choice
[1:25:16] to say we chose that and then him come
[1:25:19] back and say yes I'm the one that chose
[1:25:21] you right right right cuz that's what
[1:25:23] it's got to come back he's got to speak
[1:25:24] back say yes I chose you thank you're
[1:25:27] the one that I chose I'm just glad
[1:25:30] you're beginning to realize all right so
[1:25:33] now let's go back to Isaiah 53 just for
[1:25:36] a
[1:25:37] second he was taken from prison and from
[1:25:40] judgment and who shall
[1:25:41] declare his generation right so who's
[1:25:45] going to declare this declares
[1:25:48] Generation Mr Anna kamani I mean Anna
[1:25:51] mura yeah said me that's
[1:25:55] yeah so we're fulfilling
[1:25:57] scripture right there just is Genesis 1
[1:26:01] is special to me so is this statement
[1:26:03] who shall declare Isaiah wanted somebody
[1:26:07] under the anointing Isaiah said who is
[1:26:09] going to declare this righteous man's
[1:26:13] generation somebody has got to stand up
[1:26:17] and declare his generation in other
[1:26:19] words somebody has got to come from this
[1:26:23] man to declare the generation cuz Adam's
[1:26:27] generation was declared all the way down
[1:26:28] Abel Seth and all the way down he
[1:26:30] declared that I see it right here but
[1:26:33] he's declared this should I say New
[1:26:37] Generation right right this new creation
[1:26:40] of a
[1:26:41] generation for he was cut off out of the
[1:26:44] land of the living they killed him right
[1:26:46] they thought they got him he was done
[1:26:49] didn't have a wife didn't have kids
[1:26:53] he defiled the temple every time he
[1:26:55] walked in it they thought because he was
[1:26:56] born they said a bastard child we know
[1:26:59] he wasn't but even cathic then he said
[1:27:01] hey this man wants to save many can't
[1:27:03] even save himself right and that's true
[1:27:06] he couldn't there's no way he could come
[1:27:08] off that cross and save yourself cuz he
[1:27:10] was there to save me and you he wasn't
[1:27:12] there he didn't need saving what do you
[1:27:14] need salvation for he need salvation we
[1:27:18] needed
[1:27:19] salvation what a mighty God we serve
[1:27:24] he made his grave with the wicked and
[1:27:25] with the rich in his death because he
[1:27:27] had done no V I'm sorry he's cut off cut
[1:27:29] off among the land of people for the
[1:27:30] transgression of my people was he
[1:27:32] stricken and he made his grave with the
[1:27:34] wicked and with the rich in his death
[1:27:36] because he had done no violence neither
[1:27:38] was any deceit in his mouth what was he
[1:27:40] was
[1:27:41] Guiltless he was blameless they could
[1:27:44] find no guilt in him at all
[1:27:46] exactly yet it pleased the Lord to
[1:27:49] bruise him he hath put him to grief when
[1:27:52] when thou shalt make his soul an
[1:27:54] offering for
[1:27:55] sin sacrifice on the altar he shall see
[1:27:59] his seed right he shall prolong his days
[1:28:02] and the pleasure of the Lord shall
[1:28:03] prosper in his hand right he shall see
[1:28:06] the travail of his soul amen what I just
[1:28:09] read there in John right my soul's
[1:28:13] troubled what you know why birth pains
[1:28:17] right birth pains he was getting trying
[1:28:21] he was getting us we were wanting
[1:28:24] out Eve was wanting out of Adam so what
[1:28:27] they could fellowship and you no it
[1:28:29] wasn't Eve running around the there no
[1:28:31] it's that's the purpose of almighty God
[1:28:33] yeah all right is to get us out so that
[1:28:35] we can fellowship with him he shall see
[1:28:37] the travail of his soul and shall be
[1:28:39] satisfied for by his knowledge shall my
[1:28:42] righteous servant justify many for he
[1:28:46] shall bear their iniquity therefore will
[1:28:49] I divide him a portion with the great
[1:28:50] and he shall divide the spoil with the
[1:28:53] strong he shall divide he's given
[1:28:54] something to us because he have poured
[1:28:57] out his soul unto death and he was
[1:29:00] numbered with the transgressors what he
[1:29:02] had two thieves on the cross they just
[1:29:04] they just crucified three people that
[1:29:06] day that's all they knew they didn't
[1:29:08] crucify the righteous one and two
[1:29:10] thieves they looked up and and saw three
[1:29:11] people that were
[1:29:13] what surely they done something wrong or
[1:29:15] they would have been crucified exactly
[1:29:17] surely they that this man is is hanging
[1:29:20] on a cross because of something he did
[1:29:23] no it's something we did right so he was
[1:29:26] count numbered with the transgressors he
[1:29:28] wasn't a transgressor he was numbered
[1:29:30] with them amen and the three all right
[1:29:32] and he bear the sin of many and made
[1:29:34] intercession for their transgression now
[1:29:37] let's go to Matthew
[1:29:44] 28 and in the end of the Sabbath as it
[1:29:46] began to Dawn toward the first day of
[1:29:48] the week Came Mary Magdalene the other
[1:29:50] Mary to see the supper
[1:29:52] and behold there was a great earthquake
[1:29:55] for the
[1:29:56] angel the original says for an angel but
[1:29:59] for the angel of the Lord descended from
[1:30:02] heaven and came and rolled back the
[1:30:05] Stone from the door and sat upon it now
[1:30:09] Jesus was already
[1:30:10] gone Jesus was already gone
[1:30:13] right his countenance was like lightning
[1:30:16] and his rment white as snow and for fear
[1:30:18] of him the keepers did shake and became
[1:30:21] his dead
[1:30:22] and the angel answered and said unto the
[1:30:25] women fear
[1:30:27] not for I know that you seek Jesus which
[1:30:30] was crucified he is not
[1:30:35] here for He Is Risen right as he
[1:30:40] said come see the place where the Lord
[1:30:43] lay he's not here right he's
[1:30:48] risen a secret Resurrection right
[1:30:52] cuz they didn't believe it right the two
[1:30:54] men outside said well they must have
[1:30:55] stole his body well they concocted that
[1:30:58] story because those two men could look
[1:31:00] and see that thing sealed up and then
[1:31:03] all of a sudden they see this something
[1:31:05] coming in white and rolling the stone
[1:31:06] away and the man sitting on the stone
[1:31:08] and they look inside and don't see
[1:31:10] anything yeah they fell down as dead
[1:31:13] people so would you and
[1:31:15] me okay and then it ConEd the story but
[1:31:18] Jesus didn't need the uh the dead Saints
[1:31:21] listen this is a secret Gathering a
[1:31:23] secret coming of Christ right this is a
[1:31:25] secret a secret Resurrection right this
[1:31:29] is not where he'll split the Eastern
[1:31:30] skies and all the eyes will see him no
[1:31:32] no no you better not be in that part
[1:31:34] everybody understand that right that's
[1:31:37] where every eye will see him this is not
[1:31:39] this is a secret catching away you're
[1:31:41] not going to we're not going to go out
[1:31:42] to brother Tatum and brother Mo and all
[1:31:44] those Graves and going to see the graves
[1:31:45] that like something dug them
[1:31:47] up right I don't think so right they'll
[1:31:50] come right out of that grave and never
[1:31:51] touch a piece of
[1:31:54] dirt they'll never touch a piece of dirt
[1:31:56] people will still walk out there and go
[1:31:58] brother Tatum laying there dead cuz I
[1:32:01] see his headstone and he died so many
[1:32:03] years ago and his Grave's not even
[1:32:06] touched I mean it wouldn't be a secret
[1:32:09] if everybody all these Graves start
[1:32:11] popping open that wouldn't be a secret
[1:32:13] right so Jesus in his resurrection was
[1:32:16] showing you like brother Daniel said
[1:32:18] that's what spared me when he said that
[1:32:19] he said the resurrection ction started
[1:32:22] from within the
[1:32:24] Earth Jesus come up out of hell picked
[1:32:27] that body up amen walked right through
[1:32:29] the wall yeah never never touched a
[1:32:33] thing never Disturbed any element of the
[1:32:36] world right he just walked right on
[1:32:38] through that wall and went out and they
[1:32:40] told him to go to Jerusalem or wherever
[1:32:42] he was to meet him and and of course
[1:32:43] they didn't believe him at all but he
[1:32:47] started a work from within the Earth
[1:32:50] right it's a secret
[1:32:52] he said the world will see me no more
[1:32:54] right but you'll see me amen for I'll be
[1:32:58] with you right even in you glory so the
[1:33:02] secret resurrection of the Bride is
[1:33:04] right here Glory starting right here

[1:33:16] 6'8 guy no not going to disturb any of
[1:33:19] this earth right here just going to
[1:33:22] change it amen that's good he came back
[1:33:25] at Pentecost for the rest of his new
[1:33:27] creation sure Adam's race is still here
[1:33:31] but there's a spiritual race working in
[1:33:33] the natural race yeah the rest of this
[1:33:37] creation is by the New Birth the word
[1:33:40] the Bible said remember they hid the
[1:33:42] word in what Earth and vessels so that's
[1:33:46] exactly what it is the seed now has come
[1:33:49] planted in Your Heart by the new birth
[1:33:52] you are now the family of God Amen let's
[1:33:55] go to quote number 11 we got about six
[1:33:57] quotes in a row and we'll let brother
[1:33:59] Brown finish the whole thing off the
[1:34:01] Bible said that an illegitimate called
[1:34:03] bastard child could not enter the
[1:34:04] congregation of the Lord for 10
[1:34:06] Generations which would be 400 years
[1:34:07] that an illegitimate child could not
[1:34:09] come into the congregation of the Lord
[1:34:11] that's how bad that hybriding was that
[1:34:13] was a woman that let another man live
[1:34:15] with her in order to bring forth a child
[1:34:16] that child was hybrid not by its father
[1:34:20] but by some other man see and that was
[1:34:22] so evil before God it taken 10
[1:34:24] generations to ever breed that out again
[1:34:26] before God but that doesn't apply to
[1:34:29] this age you have a new birth now they
[1:34:33] don't they had just one birth back there
[1:34:35] that was the actual sexual
[1:34:37] breeding what back in the Old Testament
[1:34:40] right right that's what he's talking
[1:34:42] about talking about the Old Testament
[1:34:44] right they had just one birth back there
[1:34:46] and that was a sexual birth they didn't
[1:34:48] have no new birth in the Old Testament
[1:34:50] and people in this message would
[1:34:52] read yeah they had just one birth back
[1:34:55] there that was the actual sexual
[1:34:57] breeding we have this new birth now
[1:35:00] which is the spiritual that breathes out
[1:35:02] all the
[1:35:03] C glory and we are new creatures in
[1:35:06] Christ Jesus born again of the spirit of
[1:35:08] God new creatures on the word creature
[1:35:12] if some of you good Scholars here that
[1:35:14] understand if you don't you might look
[1:35:15] it up the creature comes from the Greek
[1:35:17] word of a new
[1:35:19] creation oh the same as you you are a
[1:35:22] creature here born sexually you are then
[1:35:24] a new creation born Heavenly right of in
[1:35:28] God's new creation of a new man New
[1:35:31] Creation at the birth but it has to be a
[1:35:34] birth just the same as the natural birth
[1:35:37] is necessary the spiritual birth is just
[1:35:39] as necessary as the natural birth let's
[1:35:42] go to the next
[1:35:44] one why had to be Shepherds now notice
[1:35:46] God is fixing to make another creation
[1:35:49] he created mortal Earth Earth mortal
[1:35:52] life Angels sing in heaven right but
[1:35:55] here he's creating a new life eternal
[1:35:59] life for man and he's singing to his
[1:36:02] subjects through Angels on the earth not
[1:36:05] in heaven heaven had eternal life amen
[1:36:09] look Heaven had eternal life he's
[1:36:11] bringing eternal life down to us now
[1:36:13] amen and he sang they sang to the
[1:36:15] heavens and when the Mortal creation
[1:36:18] come in and here the immortal creation
[1:36:20] is coming in and now they're singing to
[1:36:23] Earthly people the first time to
[1:36:25] Shepherds striking isn't it he had
[1:36:28] started a new creation what was it a
[1:36:31] creation of himself right God was made
[1:36:34] flesh and dwelt Among Us that the Bible
[1:36:36] said in the beginning of the creation of
[1:36:38] God God was created in human form in
[1:36:40] Jesus Christ his son God dwelt he built
[1:36:43] his Tabernacle of Flesh and Bone and
[1:36:44] lived in that Tabernacle God Emanuel God
[1:36:46] With Us he built himself a house to live
[1:36:48] in it so he could reflect his word to to
[1:36:51] his subjects through that you know what
[1:36:53] God is when you see Christ amen all
[1:36:55] right Next One Church H book now comes
[1:36:58] our triumphal Capstone on the baptism of
[1:37:01] the Holy Ghost Galatians 4: 4-7 but when
[1:37:04] the fullness of the time was come God
[1:37:05] sent forth his son made of a woman made
[1:37:07] under the law to redeem them that were
[1:37:10] under the law that we might receive the
[1:37:11] adoption of of sons because you are Sons
[1:37:15] God has sent forth the spirit of his son
[1:37:16] into your hearts crying AB the father
[1:37:18] wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but
[1:37:20] a son and if a son and an heir of God
[1:37:22] through Christ there it is Jesus Christ
[1:37:25] came forth died upon the cross and
[1:37:28] accomplished Redemption amen restoring
[1:37:31] to original owner by means of purchase
[1:37:34] are paying the price and thereby placed
[1:37:37] us as Sons amen he did not make us Sons
[1:37:41] we were already his sons for the
[1:37:43] foundation of the world but he placed us
[1:37:46] his sons for as long as we were in the
[1:37:48] world in the flesh we could not be
[1:37:51] recognized as his sons we were held
[1:37:54] captive by the devil but we were Sons
[1:37:57] nonetheless and hear this and because
[1:37:59] you are son God has sent forth the
[1:38:02] spirit of his son into your hearts
[1:38:03] whereby cry father father upon whom did
[1:38:06] the Spirit fall at Pentecost Sons at
[1:38:09] Corinth upon sons while they
[1:38:13] heard the
[1:38:16] seed
[1:38:19] right book Words original
[1:38:23] the swer went out to S what
[1:38:25] seed son of man Jesus Christ was sewing
[1:38:28] the seed what he was sowing the word
[1:38:30] that you and I responded to remember the
[1:38:32] quote that I made you know you respond
[1:38:35] to the word that God knew God knew that
[1:38:37] you to respond to a certain part of the
[1:38:39] word and that's he put the word there
[1:38:40] for you so therefore that's what you
[1:38:42] respond back to Glory while they heard
[1:38:45] the word go next
[1:38:47] one Third Exodus first Exodus what did
[1:38:50] he do he brought them out of a natural
[1:38:52] land what he brought Israel out of a
[1:38:55] natural land to a natural land right it
[1:38:58] was a promise land but it was a natural
[1:39:00] land the second Exodus he brought them
[1:39:02] out from a spiritual condition scribes
[1:39:04] Pharisees herodians and all that from a
[1:39:07] spiritual condition into a spiritual
[1:39:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost now he's
[1:39:13] bringing them from the spiritual baptism
[1:39:15] of the Holy Ghost listen to this right
[1:39:17] back into the Eternal land of the
[1:39:19] Millennium in the great Hereafter that's
[1:39:21] the Third Exodus that's getting out of
[1:39:23] here same Pillar of Fire by the same
[1:39:25] anointed system same God doing the same
[1:39:27] thing the same word declared the first
[1:39:30] one declared the second one the same
[1:39:32] word declared the second one has
[1:39:33] declared the third one right and here we
[1:39:35] see it among us and here we see it Among
[1:39:38] Us come out oh come out of this chaos
[1:39:42] come to the Living God come to the word
[1:39:43] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:39:45] Among Us and now he's in our flesh
[1:39:48] dwelling Among Us come out and serve the
[1:39:50] living Living God while we bow our heads
[1:39:52] and the brother speaks in another tongue
[1:39:54] all right let's go to the next
[1:39:59] one or is that the last one there's one
[1:40:01] more I think Christ is the mystery of
[1:40:03] God reveal 14 we got a couple more and
[1:40:07] when the word moves on down into the
[1:40:08] body from the head what is it this same
[1:40:11] word nothing can be added or taken from
[1:40:13] it so that same word moves from the head
[1:40:16] as the day comes close down into the
[1:40:18] body down into the body vindicating that
[1:40:21] are one they are husband and wife right
[1:40:23] flesh of his flesh word of his word life
[1:40:26] of his life Spirit of his Spirit see
[1:40:27] amen how do you know it Bears the same
[1:40:31] record same fruit same word see manifest
[1:40:34] Christ same life same God Same Spirit
[1:40:37] same word same book amen same signs
[1:40:40] things that I do you do also oh
[1:40:42] Hallelujah my notice the Vindicated word
[1:40:44] in his body is his very
[1:40:47] Victory and the reason of his death
[1:40:50] right right
[1:40:51] see the death not in spirit when he died
[1:40:54] he only died in the flesh his Spirit
[1:40:56] went to hell and preached to the souls
[1:40:58] in prison that right his flesh only died
[1:41:01] then he raised it up again and quickened
[1:41:03] it Quicken means make alive his flesh
[1:41:06] which was his body and that's the word
[1:41:09] it's been laying dead for years talk
[1:41:13] about his body
[1:41:14] here but it gradually began to come into
[1:41:17] the re reformation and now she is
[1:41:19] standing a point her feet Hallelujah
[1:41:23] Resurrection is standing up you don't
[1:41:26] resurrect somebody laying down when he
[1:41:28] get resurrect buddy when Lazarus came
[1:41:30] out of that tomb he was standing up they
[1:41:32] didn't have to carry him out right they
[1:41:34] didn't have to carry Jesus out of the
[1:41:35] Grave anyway he was standing up all
[1:41:38] right look 15 just like this with my
[1:41:40] shadow here of my hand if I never seen
[1:41:43] my hand seen I've seen the shadow it's
[1:41:45] kind of it gets pale as it gets away but
[1:41:48] as it gets closer and closer the
[1:41:49] negative and positive are coming
[1:41:50] together
[1:41:51] until they both become the same thing
[1:41:54] what the negative down here positive of
[1:41:57] God right that's exactly when the church
[1:41:59] and the word has to be one like Jesus
[1:42:01] and God was one exactly let's go ahead
[1:42:04] and read the next one all right Christ
[1:42:06] was revealed in his own word all right
[1:42:09] the entire Bible is the entire
[1:42:11] revelation of Jesus Christ making itself
[1:42:13] known to every age he made himself known
[1:42:16] in the days of Luther as a foundation
[1:42:19] the church the foot the leg
[1:42:21] like he did King Nebuchadnezzar you
[1:42:22] remember how he dreamed those dreams and
[1:42:24] come up from the head down see now he
[1:42:26] comes from the feet up amen see in the
[1:42:29] Babylonian Kingdom he showed all those
[1:42:31] Old Testaments he came from the head
[1:42:33] down until he come down until God
[1:42:35] himself became flesh at the foot of the
[1:42:38] ladder now here in the New Testament he
[1:42:40] brings himself right back up again to
[1:42:42] the head again the head of gold to be
[1:42:44] crowned look you get it see God was in
[1:42:47] the beginning and he kept coming down
[1:42:48] through the prophets and on down until
[1:42:50] God himself became human like us plumbed
[1:42:54] down at the foot of the ladder a baby
[1:42:55] born in a manger hated rejected despised
[1:42:59] a bad name and everything he
[1:43:01] was then he started Rising see and from
[1:43:04] the feet he began to build the church to
[1:43:06] bride coming back what building his
[1:43:08] family amen now coming out into the
[1:43:10] headstone where it all joins together
[1:43:12] and makes the one great transfigured
[1:43:15] body of Jesus Christ amen rising of the
[1:43:18] sun because I live you live also
[1:43:20] speaking to his wife because I live you
[1:43:22] live also what a resurrection that that
[1:43:25] was amen and what a resurrection this is
[1:43:28] to be quickened from the dead to be made
[1:43:31] alive in Christ by God's quickening
[1:43:36] PowerAll amen
[1:43:38] amen his children are here right God's
[1:43:42] children are on the earth the last part
[1:43:45] of
[1:43:47] this family album
[1:43:51] I believe on the Earth right because
[1:43:54] we're getting close to the end time and
[1:43:56] I believe that the 144,000 are over
[1:44:00] there somewhere in Israel doing their
[1:44:01] thing is kind of like I said last night
[1:44:05] and I wasn't trying to be derogatory but
[1:44:06] look if we if we got the promise of the
[1:44:09] new birth if we have the new
[1:44:11] birth all these other things will take
[1:44:13] care of theel right whether you go by
[1:44:16] the grave or where you're alive and
[1:44:17] remain and really that is your choice
[1:44:21] still that's your choice but remember
[1:44:24] one thing God's plan is if you get born
[1:44:28] again and you get the promise the
[1:44:30] promise is what going to take you
[1:44:33] somewhere promise is going to take you
[1:44:36] like I telling them last night we were

[1:44:39] good to talk about certain details about
[1:44:41] things but you know what when I get
