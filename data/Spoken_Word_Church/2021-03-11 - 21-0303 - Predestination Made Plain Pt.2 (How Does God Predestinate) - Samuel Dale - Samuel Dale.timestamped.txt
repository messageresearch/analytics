[0:00] us who has blessed us with all spiritual
[0:02] blessings in heavenly places
[0:04] in christ according as he has chosen us
[0:09] in him now i like that and they even you
[0:12] know
[0:13] circle to let you know what it's talking
[0:16] about in him
[0:17] before the foundation of the world that
[0:20] we should be holy and without blame
[0:22] before him
[0:23] in love having predestinated us unto the
[0:26] adoption of children by jesus christ
[0:29] to himself according to the good
[0:31] pleasure of his will
[0:33] you may be seated the lord had his
[0:35] blessing to the reading
[0:37] of the word now tempted to
[0:40] bring some things are out um
[0:44] sunday of talking about predestination
[0:47] all right i think we need to
[0:51] emphasize strong statements
[0:54] to let you know where we stand
[0:58] and in doing that then you say well well
[1:02] i just don't agree with that well that's
[1:04] all right that's your business
[1:07] then when you ask me what do i stand on
[1:09] where do i stand
[1:11] that's where i stand i stand on what i
[1:13] can believe about the word of god
[1:15] and what god has delivered to us through
[1:19] all of these years that he has guided us
[1:21] and taken care of us
[1:23] and brought us through all of the the
[1:25] problems and heartaches and troubles
[1:27] that's been in the world and
[1:29] all kinds of things and brought us to a
[1:31] place that we can
[1:32] you know relax and say okay we've come
[1:35] this far
[1:37] so they ain't no need of throwing up our
[1:38] hands let's just keep going
[1:40] let's just keep on walking and doing the
[1:42] best we can do
[1:44] and following in the love of god all
[1:47] right
[1:47] and i was talking about it because the
[1:49] little thought was is uh
[1:51] you know predestination you remember
[1:53] we've done a little series there on
[1:55] the god head made simple trying to
[2:00] break that down to where we could
[2:01] understand and then
[2:03] that way you can say well okay uh we
[2:06] used everything that we could use
[2:09] i did or tried to that thinking that
[2:11] even somebody else would
[2:13] come up with an idea of this and that or
[2:15] the other
[2:16] i tried to cut that off into as much as
[2:19] i could
[2:20] of understanding of the truth of god's
[2:23] word
[2:23] and that's what i want to do in this
[2:25] part now we had a service about we'll
[2:27] take this in part two i don't know what
[2:29] we'll do from on out
[2:31] that's no problem we'll we'll try to
[2:33] survive somewhere
[2:35] and have something to speak to preach on
[2:38] but what was our thought now
[2:41] predestination
[2:42] made plain i didn't give you any more
[2:46] notes any more thoughts
[2:48] other than just leaving it to where we
[2:50] could just take this and look over it
[2:52] and
[2:52] follow it and go through into what we
[2:55] want to cover for the night
[2:58] all right predestination made plain or
[3:02] simple
[3:05] you know if we take everything in the
[3:07] simplified way
[3:09] what a wonderful thing it would be that
[3:11] was one thing i was trying to explain
[3:14] and have tried to explain about this
[3:16] book this bible
[3:18] you know this is a bible written about
[3:21] people
[3:24] people all the way through people you
[3:26] know
[3:28] it is not necessarily written about this
[3:30] that it's written about
[3:31] people you know because it covers people
[3:35] from the beginning
[3:37] all other things and then it winds up in
[3:40] the end
[3:41] that we get down to the end of the story
[3:43] only thing i like about this book
[3:46] i've read it for years and years and
[3:49] and i went to the end of it and go back
[3:51] to the beginning and go to the end of it
[3:53] and you know what i've never found the
[3:55] end of it
[3:58] have you ever found the end of the bible
[4:00] i never have
[4:02] you know like a story being in life it
[4:04] would say the
[4:05] end are they riding off you know into
[4:08] the sunset on the horseback and
[4:10] saying the end well there's no way to
[4:14] put an end to the bible
[4:16] i've told you what i believe and the
[4:18] reason i believe it
[4:19] i believe we're just getting enough
[4:22] of the word of god while we are here
[4:26] in this world to be able to
[4:29] understand the things that are coming
[4:34] and the prophet said god would give us
[4:35] his message of cheer
[4:37] down through the endless ages
[4:41] what about that it's just being we're
[4:43] just now beginning
[4:45] because see i i i've thought about just
[4:49] doing it
[4:50] and you know you could start and we've
[4:52] been doing it but
[4:53] we just didn't call it that away and and
[4:55] these brothers are doing it these
[4:57] ministers are
[4:58] doing it is you know you can just read
[5:00] what happened in genesis
[5:01] well you know what that was the people
[5:03] made that manifest
[5:06] you know it said and this and this and
[5:09] he created this and he'd done this
[5:11] and you know somebody or something made
[5:13] that manifest
[5:15] all right see then we're still in the
[5:18] writing of the book
[5:20] it's not finished we're in the writing
[5:23] of the book
[5:24] it's talking about us now
[5:27] this is not talking about the the
[5:30] disciples
[5:33] it's not talking about abraham they
[5:36] ain't talking about david it ain't
[5:37] talking about
[5:38] it's talking about me and you
[5:41] we are the ones that the end of the
[5:44] world has come upon
[5:46] all right if we don't if we don't live
[5:49] out long enough to see the end of it
[5:51] somebody will but you know that has to
[5:54] be somebody
[5:55] alive according to the word all right
[5:58] find yourself in the word
[6:01] but i tried to tell you you know you got
[6:03] the natural part written there
[6:05] all right you got all god said and all
[6:08] happened and
[6:09] with adam and all that happened with
[6:12] with
[6:13] cain and abel and and the things and
[6:15] coming on down and
[6:16] coming to abraham and all of the things
[6:20] and you see every bit of that you
[6:23] realize those people made that manifest
[6:27] all right now if i can get to the story
[6:30] part of it i
[6:31] it's my mind is just i'm wondering how
[6:35] it's going to happen and what it's going
[6:36] to come forth in the message because
[6:39] i believe i see something but i want to
[6:41] be able to make it to where you can see
[6:43] it
[6:44] but it wouldn't have nothing to be able
[6:45] just me to see it and then you know
[6:47] throwing it out and all i want you to
[6:49] see it and i want you to question it we
[6:51] should have questions and answers
[6:53] i love questions and answers i wish we
[6:56] could get back and maybe we can make
[6:57] some plans to
[6:59] have one like a saturday night questions
[7:02] and answers like we've always had
[7:04] before i enjoy that that is
[7:08] that is a wonderful time we can set a
[7:10] father apart we can move around we can
[7:13] do things
[7:14] and not be so congested in doing it
[7:17] you know we can we can handle of the
[7:19] things but i i
[7:21] enjoy questions and brother branham said
[7:24] questions makes a strong church
[7:29] yeah he says a lot of things it's hard
[7:33] to be understood
[7:35] the bible says a lot of things it's hard
[7:37] to be understood right
[7:39] how could questions make a strong
[7:43] church when the bible tells you to
[7:46] not fool with questions the gender
[7:49] strife
[7:53] right all right you say well i'm saying
[7:56] well all right say what the prophet said
[7:58] he said the bible
[8:02] is the word of god
[8:06] all right all we got to do is just read
[8:09] it
[8:11] but see we try to read it our our way
[8:15] you know and see then the word of god
[8:19] is so perfect that we don't need to add
[8:22] anything to it or take away from it or
[8:24] try to figure it out is just read it
[8:29] and it says and god created
[8:32] that took place you've heard your
[8:33] prophet say those lines when it said and
[8:35] god
[8:36] created the heavens and the earth he
[8:38] said
[8:39] amen god created man that was just
[8:43] god created man that took place one day
[8:47] well so is it now among us i told you i
[8:50] believe we're living the bible right now
[8:53] if not what do you think we're doing
[8:56] i'd like to get your definition of what
[8:58] you think this world is like and what
[9:00] it's going to be or what it's going to
[9:02] turn
[9:04] that's why i'm not concerned with it
[9:07] i've told you over and over this virus
[9:09] and stuff like that that's tribulation
[9:11] that working patience that is not the
[9:12] tribulation
[9:13] because if it is you and i are lost
[9:19] now that's as plain as i can make it and
[9:20] back it up with the bible because
[9:23] we're not supposed to be here in the
[9:24] tribulation
[9:27] well that makes it simple then
[9:32] man look how simple the bible is the
[9:35] bride's not going to go through the
[9:36] tribulation all right
[9:38] that's right you know what that means i
[9:41] can look around and say well okay
[9:43] we're still here if i am part of that
[9:47] and a part of the bride
[9:51] then there can't be no tribulation
[9:52] taking place oh there can be all kinds
[9:55] of things happening no but they can't be
[9:56] because i'm here
[9:59] you don't think of yourself like that
[10:02] think of living the word
[10:04] we've talked about the word and how the
[10:06] word is to be made alive
[10:10] well think about it
[10:13] you're part of the word
[10:17] then god is not complete without you
[10:22] because you're his children okay let's
[10:24] get on to the point
[10:26] so predestination made plain to us
[10:31] is one thing we can read notes we can go
[10:34] through where the prophet
[10:35] told us that predestination you know
[10:38] looks forward to destiny before
[10:40] knowledge goes back
[10:42] we can go through all of the quotes and
[10:44] the bringing down of these things
[10:46] and that's wonderful and i tried to do
[10:49] that a little bit darwini last sunday
[10:52] you know of the services of doing it
[10:55] but
[10:59] what are we doing what are we looking
[11:01] for something else
[11:04] because if it's made plain then it's
[11:07] plain what the prophet said
[11:08] he had to say the bible is full of it
[11:11] those who he foreknew
[11:13] he did predestinate
[11:16] right elect
[11:19] according to foreknowledge
[11:25] which comes first then
[11:28] for knowledge or predestination
[11:34] then your prophet comes along verifying
[11:38] it
[11:38] quote after quote after quote throughout
[11:40] the message especially when you get into
[11:43] the
[11:44] uh later years after the opening of the
[11:47] seals
[11:48] i don't mean it brings out a different
[11:50] thing it just brings out deeper meaning
[11:53] deeper understanding
[11:57] if you're going to talk about now the
[12:00] people that's message like to get into
[12:01] these type of things
[12:02] they like to think about oh i always was
[12:08] eternal always was eternal brother dale
[12:11] i can just feel it feel it
[12:19] well let me say it to you this way
[12:24] if you can bring that's why these people
[12:26] don't come because they know better into
[12:28] about tackling what's being said you
[12:31] come and you bring all the quotes about
[12:33] the
[12:33] fact of you being eternal and you know
[12:36] what i'll finish by saying
[12:42] the prophet said predestination looks
[12:45] back to full knowledge
[12:48] for knowledge look to destiny so if you
[12:51] always was eternal
[12:52] then that's in god's foreknowledge
[12:58] because we don't believe it that way
[13:01] sure i believe that that the fact that
[13:03] god when he foresaw it
[13:05] sure we are here and when we reach the
[13:08] position of understanding
[13:10] when you receive the baptism of the holy
[13:12] ghost into your soul your soul is made
[13:14] eternal
[13:15] right all right then made eternal by the
[13:18] life of god coming
[13:19] into you then you can say my soul always
[13:23] was eternal
[13:24] because it is in the basis of god giving
[13:27] it to me
[13:28] but it don't mean that it was there
[13:30] until a time come that's what i want
[13:32] you to see about predestination it's
[13:35] very simple
[13:38] you just look at it
[13:41] you just read it
[13:45] and you say there it is but see you come
[13:48] with the points of trying to
[13:50] bring some great doctrinal thing all i'm
[13:52] going to do is just keep saying it
[13:57] god looks back to foreknowledge
[14:01] and predestinated all things before
[14:04] knowledge
[14:10] but you see what people don't want to do
[14:11] they don't want to tie together all of
[14:13] the whole story
[14:14] and to think it this way that everybody
[14:16] in the world
[14:17] that ever has been in the world ever
[14:19] will be in the world
[14:20] all is predestinated by god's
[14:22] foreknowledge
[14:25] that's simple then you ain't trying to
[14:28] figure out a bride for this part
[14:30] here you ain't trying to figure out this
[14:31] to fit over here
[14:33] and it's to go there
[14:38] right it's all about foreknowledge
[14:43] god foreknew and if he didn't foreknow
[14:46] it
[14:47] if he's not capable of foreknowing it
[14:50] what kind of a god do we have
[14:57] see i always say it i'm sorry that god
[14:59] knows my heart on the point but i always
[15:01] say what do we think we've got a peanut
[15:03] brain
[15:03] for a god
[15:08] i like that illustration the prophet gay
[15:10] said a gnat and every time he'd bat its
[15:12] eye and how much
[15:14] taller it would make
[15:17] i like that you know what that means
[15:21] that means god for new
[15:25] all things that means he's infinite
[15:28] amen he don't how to think it over
[15:38] and when he says this will happen
[15:41] why can't we believe that'll happen
[15:46] you see but but the point of what i'm
[15:47] getting see it's like the woman in the
[15:49] white house
[15:50] see before the foundation of the world
[15:52] you think god didn't know that
[15:58] but there wasn't a time that could take
[16:00] place until now
[16:04] but now that's taken place
[16:07] all right like terrence said if we had a
[16:09] bunch of dummies and a thought it out
[16:11] back when the prophet said
[16:13] that the catholic church had one of 68
[16:16] billion or something of what they had
[16:18] and if we just thought of that about
[16:21] 1970 somewhere right in there
[16:24] and and you know gold if we'd have just
[16:28] thought of that
[16:29] and went and bought a whole bunch of it
[16:32] look how rich we'd be
[16:39] you don't think that way look how rich
[16:41] we'd be
[16:43] ain't trying to be rich but i'm trying
[16:46] to talk about the truth
[16:49] so anything that you see taking place
[16:51] that the bible speaks of
[16:54] now are you following me listen i'm
[16:56] trying to get a point and then we'll
[16:57] move over a little
[16:59] everything that you can think about it
[17:03] whether it be world war one world war ii
[17:06] and world war
[17:06] iii that had to take place
[17:10] because the bible had said it yes
[17:15] that was not an addition to the word of
[17:17] god
[17:18] that was the three woes the things of
[17:20] the bible all of that was in there in
[17:22] the scriptures
[17:27] and yet we were trying our best to
[17:28] figure out what this means
[17:31] like i've told you and i'm not throwing
[17:32] off on him my brother-in-law he believed
[17:34] that that
[17:35] uh whether you know that uh you mark of
[17:37] the beast and the thing like that
[17:39] he believed that a big old king kong
[17:41] animal gonna walk or a man or something
[17:43] walk across the earth i looked and i
[17:44] said is that going to be deceiving
[17:49] i mean when you got a big old king kong
[17:51] animal walking
[17:52] what has that got to do with with
[17:54] religion
[17:58] me and even it did
[18:01] if it did happen that way it would be
[18:03] the fact of god's foreknowledge coming
[18:06] into being
[18:06] that he had predetermined it because of
[18:09] the full knowledge he had
[18:12] that's simple it's simple to think about
[18:16] predestination if you think of it that
[18:18] god foreknew all things
[18:23] see your question whether or not god is
[18:26] real
[18:29] all right but you see
[18:33] how does god predestinate
[18:37] by his foreknowledge
[18:42] anything that's going to take place into
[18:44] the world it's already written in the
[18:46] book of life because that's what i love
[18:47] about it
[18:50] all whose names were
[18:53] not written you know a lot of people's
[18:55] names was not written in here
[18:57] but it was written about them
[19:01] right it was written about them
[19:04] then you could say their names was in
[19:06] there what does that mean their names
[19:07] were not in there
[19:09] they're not part of the word
[19:13] that's just what i want to get to if i
[19:15] can in the measure but don't i'll get it
[19:16] later
[19:17] what's the difference in in salvation
[19:19] for the old testament and salvation for
[19:21] the new
[19:27] i will make the statement and stand by
[19:29] the statement
[19:31] whatever saved abraham
[19:34] will save you
[19:38] if you get it right a lot goes between
[19:40] there
[19:43] because the abraham was back there under
[19:44] the blood of bulls and ghosts
[19:46] we're under the blood of jesus christ
[19:47] okay but still
[19:49] there's one thing about it god foreknew
[19:51] it
[19:55] god foreknew it
[20:00] i asked you a simple question i liked it
[20:03] that way i released another day and i
[20:04] thought
[20:05] why don't i keep saying that i'm going
[20:07] to ask you a simple question i just want
[20:08] to ask you a simple question
[20:14] does god predetermine by his
[20:16] foreknowledge
[20:18] or does he predetermined by his desires
[20:26] he can't predestinate by his desires and
[20:29] the fact that
[20:29] he desired it all be saved right
[20:34] you desire anybody to be lost
[20:38] we choose those things but you think he
[20:42] didn't know your choice
[20:48] well yes see we want to take something
[20:50] on the side and pull it over and work it
[20:52] around so much
[20:52] like that god didn't choose me i i mean
[20:56] god i didn't choose god god chose me
[21:02] all right you're right
[21:06] but if you use it wrong you're wrong
[21:12] you just use that little statement wrong
[21:14] way you're wrong
[21:19] because remember one thing god can't
[21:21] override your free moral agency
[21:24] he will not save you he will not make
[21:27] you be saved
[21:30] he couldn't set back before the world
[21:32] and predetermine you to be saved
[21:34] but at the same time predetermined you
[21:36] to be lost
[21:38] now what kind of a god is that
[21:45] i'm trying to get us to the point of one
[21:46] thing how simple it is
[21:49] if we just think about it correctly
[21:52] god forenew foresaw for ordained
[21:57] predetermined whatever the thoughts or
[22:00] ideas that you want to put in it
[22:04] all things
[22:07] you think he didn't know everything you
[22:09] think he knew some things but he didn't
[22:11] know the other
[22:17] well what i like about it is that he
[22:20] foreknew everything but then he turned
[22:21] around one day and said blessed is a man
[22:23] to whom god will not impute sin
[22:31] and the same man he said that about
[22:34] which was david
[22:36] the same man he said he's a man after my
[22:38] own heart
[22:41] he's a murderer an adulteress
[22:46] what you see
[22:50] it's not made to be figured out that a
[22:52] way
[22:54] you don't question why he did it
[22:58] i can ask you a question what made
[23:02] god come to you and save you
[23:11] when the world is full of a whole lot
[23:14] better people
[23:16] than you and me you agree with that
[23:19] that do a whole lot more for god than me
[23:22] and you
[23:22] they may do
[23:26] what's this all about who triggered what
[23:29] who brought what into being
[23:33] if you'll simply go back to the basis
[23:35] and god foreign
[23:36] then you've got a starting point you've
[23:38] got something to anchor it in
[23:39] you don't have to question
[23:42] you look back and said he's seen this
[23:47] he saw that woman walk in the white
[23:49] house
[23:55] that was his word to me that's as much
[23:58] of the word of god as it is
[24:00] of anything else you could talk about
[24:01] russia china whatever
[24:03] all those things are in the word of god
[24:06] there's a
[24:06] natural book that is called the bible
[24:10] i don't know what that'd be the correct
[24:12] way of saying it in a natural book again
[24:13] but it's anywhere else a book that
[24:15] contains all things because remember one
[24:17] thing
[24:18] according to book of daniel you've got
[24:20] to deal with books
[24:22] and books
[24:25] it's more than just one book amen
[24:31] there's one book of life there's one
[24:34] book
[24:35] of the center you've got books
[24:41] why because it takes all of that to
[24:43] cover the world see that way he has a
[24:47] place of knowing what to do
[24:50] is i've always tried to get you to look
[24:51] at something in the correct way i
[24:53] believe in predestination like this
[24:55] there was exa in the denominational
[24:57] world we used to teach it
[24:58] because i remember that they used to
[25:01] teach that the ark was so big that
[25:03] everybody in the world could got on it
[25:04] if they'd wanted to
[25:07] and i remember then said no no no
[25:12] he made it for exactly how many
[25:15] they were right
[25:19] that's right he never left an extra
[25:21] space just in case one of the guys
[25:23] crawls on
[25:24] we haul him around for three or four
[25:25] months on the outside and we let him
[25:27] come inside and we give him a space nah
[25:29] that's just all silly that's what i'm
[25:30] trying to be
[25:31] it's silly with you
[25:36] he knew exactly how many that ark would
[25:40] hold
[25:42] they didn't have a crash on the the food
[25:48] because it wasn't enough
[25:51] everything was there he made it all but
[25:55] you know what
[25:56] now listen that's in this book
[26:00] as a natural story
[26:08] because that was a man not under the
[26:10] blood of bull
[26:11] i mean under the blood of jesus christ
[26:13] that's right amen
[26:18] that was a man that dwelt back there
[26:21] when it was not under the salvation
[26:25] that we talk about
[26:32] but think about it
[26:36] what caused see if you'll take it and
[26:39] just get the predestination get it
[26:41] straight
[26:42] other foreign then you can answer the
[26:44] question what caused
[26:47] or determined
[26:51] what god would do when this world
[26:55] started
[26:57] it can't be what he wanted to do
[27:01] we know that we can we can read those
[27:02] things in the prophet because he didn't
[27:04] do it
[27:07] all right but it can be
[27:11] from the basis that he knew all things
[27:17] then if he knew all things then why are
[27:19] we worried about it
[27:23] well brother dale i'm just worried
[27:24] whether i'm saved or not well why
[27:33] the bible tells you how to be saved
[27:38] right tells you exactly the way to be
[27:41] and what to do and everything
[27:43] and god has written his word to tell us
[27:46] those things you think he won't keep his
[27:47] word
[27:59] if it's not by foreknowledge
[28:02] what would it be by
[28:07] and if it is by foreknowledge
[28:13] then why can't we believe it
[28:20] why can't you take your healing on the
[28:22] basis of four knowledge
[28:25] because according to foreknowledge the
[28:28] bible says
[28:30] they see he stood as a lamb slain before
[28:31] the foundation world which could heal
[28:33] could deliver could save et cetera et
[28:35] cetera
[28:41] that's just for knowledge
[28:44] well all you got to do is find out what
[28:47] day you're living in
[28:50] right around said god predestinated
[28:53] a seed forever age
[28:59] a word for every age
[29:06] but we want to go with what we're
[29:08] thinking about oh i'm always was eternal
[29:14] if you always was eternal then jesus
[29:15] christ died in vain
[29:19] because he was predetermined
[29:22] predestinated for knowledge
[29:25] to die for the sins of the world
[29:26] according to the scriptures
[29:30] chosen us in him before the foundation
[29:32] of the world
[29:39] well you know it's over with why can't
[29:40] we believe it that way see we're wanting
[29:43] it to happen
[29:44] when i'm trying to tell you the bible is
[29:46] so full of what has already happened
[29:48] why should i worry about what's going on
[29:49] now i should rejoice
[29:55] and say thank you lord
[30:00] what caused god to predetermine
[30:09] are you listening what caused him to
[30:11] predetermine
[30:15] if you're going any other way than the
[30:16] fact of his foreknowledge
[30:18] then you're making him setting the
[30:20] destiny of all things and if he doesn't
[30:22] do everybody the same way
[30:23] then we're all in bad trouble
[30:30] but you see the sinner can't say you
[30:33] made me wrong
[30:39] he says i sit down i've done everything
[30:41] said i even sent
[30:43] my word and brought it to you now we're
[30:46] not talking about down through the ages
[30:48] and the time
[30:48] we're talking about right now
[30:53] like we were saying one day said ain't
[30:54] no need to worry about abraham that's
[30:56] done
[31:00] what you never you have never thought
[31:02] about
[31:04] i was trying to express it there sunday
[31:06] and just easing along with it because
[31:10] you never thought about
[31:14] why would abraham be called a friend of
[31:16] god
[31:18] and why would he be called the father
[31:22] of the faith
[31:25] he is our father in the basis of the
[31:28] gospel
[31:31] and what was that
[31:36] that's why i love the scriptures
[31:43] it gives you the answer
[31:46] abraham believed god
[31:52] remember in the scripture and it was
[31:54] imputed
[31:56] or imparted or per for
[32:00] preset
[32:05] you ain't never thought about it it just
[32:06] hit me when i started on this
[32:08] trying to get things and i know i can't
[32:10] get it the way i want it
[32:12] but you know that abraham was given an
[32:14] unconditional covenant
[32:17] now does that mean that
[32:20] abraham can do anything he wants to do
[32:23] and get by with it and still be saved
[32:28] what about it what is an unconditional
[32:31] covenant
[32:39] what about it being a covenant that was
[32:43] god predetermined this to be that away
[32:48] but why and how could he do it with
[32:50] abraham
[32:51] especially because we're staying with
[32:53] the old testament for you to understand
[32:54] it that way
[32:55] how can it be of those that are not in
[32:57] the new birth and the age and the thing
[32:59] that we are
[33:00] and to think about abraham
[33:04] and him be a friend of god
[33:12] i don't believe in the fact that god
[33:14] picks one and
[33:15] cast off the other one no
[33:19] but i do believe that according to
[33:23] foreknowledge
[33:25] and the natural writing of this bible
[33:27] that did take place exactly
[33:31] because he loved jacob
[33:34] and hated esau
[33:39] how could it be anything that god could
[33:41] hate when he is not the author of hate
[33:55] what are you doing what are you thinking
[34:01] but abraham didn't have anything to do
[34:02] with it
[34:06] well what stirred god one day
[34:11] and he went down to a man
[34:17] genesis 12 and he said
[34:21] abram
[34:24] come and follow me
[34:30] now if i went to your house in the
[34:32] morning
[34:34] knocked on the door and you came to the
[34:37] door whether it be sister or brother
[34:39] you know especially to the brothers
[34:42] because they're a little more
[34:42] hard-headed in a lot of things
[34:45] how would it be that i'd knock on the
[34:47] door and i'd say
[34:49] go with me well where are we going
[34:55] you know yourself and i'd be right along
[34:57] with you i wouldn't jump up
[34:59] okay let's go
[35:03] and you don't listen
[35:08] something happened when god contacted
[35:11] abraham
[35:13] that put him in a position that never
[35:15] put the rest of the people in the world
[35:22] he walked down through on the shores the
[35:24] lord jesus of the shores of galilee one
[35:26] day and he said
[35:27] peter come on paul
[35:30] come on they did with paul later come on
[35:33] because i'm doing exactly what brother
[35:35] branham did i was listening to him last
[35:37] night we waited on the tape
[35:38] and i sat there and i agreed i thought
[35:42] he said uh mark you come on do this
[35:46] right and i thought uh
[35:50] something ain't right now around here i
[35:53] see mark was not original to chapel
[35:58] paul was not an original disciple i was
[36:01] just talking of terminologies and using
[36:03] it like he used
[36:04] it but that didn't mean he was all so
[36:07] far wrong
[36:10] he made a human error in speech
[36:15] because he was a human being
[36:18] but isn't it something that he turned to
[36:20] those disciples
[36:22] he said come on
[36:25] man you get that old matthew with that
[36:27] tax collector boy that would be hard
[36:29] with it
[36:30] but all these ladders money anyway
[36:35] and yet they just lay down everything
[36:37] and they go walking with him
[36:42] well how many people along the shores of
[36:44] galilee that day
[36:46] did he stop and talk to and say come and
[36:49] follow me
[36:51] now you're saying you're making it i'm
[36:53] making it the truth of what i'm talking
[36:55] about
[36:55] because you got just i got this much
[36:57] right to say it this way as you got a
[36:58] right to take yours
[37:03] you say you're using it the wrong way
[37:04] why
[37:06] because for some reason
[37:10] he stopped and spoke to peter
[37:15] for some reason he spoke to james john
[37:21] for some reason what was that reason
[37:28] what reason was it with abraham abraham
[37:33] come and follow me
[37:37] he gives up everything he's got
[37:41] now the bible don't tell it that way but
[37:43] we're we're living in a different world
[37:45] we're i ain't throwing off on you women
[37:47] because it's the same with men today
[37:48] it's just a messed up world
[37:50] all the way around but how many of your
[37:51] wives would have when
[37:53] abraham walked in and said come on let's
[37:55] go back up
[37:57] where we're going well i don't know well
[38:00] i ain't going
[38:02] he said oh yeah you know the only reason
[38:04] they'd go
[38:05] well not because they loved abraham
[38:10] because it be the fact that they didn't
[38:11] have no husband if they didn't go with
[38:13] abraham
[38:14] so they quickly got up and went and kept
[38:16] their mouth shut
[38:18] is that an illustration without an
[38:20] understanding or a
[38:22] problem
[38:25] but savior just got up and went out he
[38:28] goes away over there and he gives her
[38:30] away a couple of times
[38:32] how many wives would like it that way
[38:39] but you know god wasn't looking at him
[38:40] giving away his wives
[38:43] i mean his wife he wasn't looking at all
[38:45] of those things god wasn't looking at
[38:47] that with abraham
[38:48] but what was he looking at
[38:53] we'll solve the whole case of
[38:54] predestination by getting an
[38:56] understanding of what i just said
[39:01] what was it there in that man called
[39:04] abraham
[39:06] that god would love
[39:10] when you get that and figure it out
[39:11] we're going to go to david
[39:14] and say a man after god's own heart
[39:22] see what are you thinking
[39:26] i'm thinking of one way
[39:30] there was something if you want to think
[39:32] about you come into this world with
[39:34] anything
[39:36] you know everybody in the message oh i
[39:37] come in the world there's seed in me
[39:39] there's a
[39:39] seed of what the prophet said it was a
[39:41] seed of representation from
[39:43] predestination
[39:44] now that's what he said it was and the
[39:47] representation from predestination will
[39:48] go all the way back to the foreknowledge
[39:52] and you're still in the book
[39:56] but what about those disciples they just
[39:57] turn look and walk off
[40:04] i gave the story of me that i had the
[40:05] opportunity i could have done a lot of
[40:07] things
[40:08] but one day when god crossed my path i
[40:10] had to walk
[40:13] i had to leave and go
[40:17] because i knew something was talking to
[40:19] me
[40:21] i couldn't explain it and still can't
[40:22] today because ain't no need of you
[40:24] trying to explain it's just the fact of
[40:26] believing it
[40:27] something was different about you
[40:30] now quote brother branham he said
[40:32] something about you was different all
[40:33] along
[40:35] well now what was he saying
[40:39] could that be what saved you
[40:44] could it be what abraham done back there
[40:46] was a very fact of salvation
[40:49] for the day now we're not talking about
[40:50] the old and new testament we're talking
[40:52] about salvation for the time or whatever
[40:54] it takes to be
[40:55] because abraham could not accept jesus
[40:57] christ as his savior because jesus
[40:59] christ hadn't died
[41:00] all right
[41:06] but something clicked inside of that man
[41:08] called abraham
[41:13] he said
[41:16] i'll go with you
[41:23] that's not over in the story where he
[41:24] meets him a lot of times and
[41:26] blesses him and changes his name that's
[41:28] when he first started
[41:29] that was when he was abram
[41:34] nothing whatsoever
[41:38] but yet when he walks out with god god
[41:41] looks back and says
[41:45] that's what i knew he'd take
[41:50] that's what i knew it'd take
[41:56] and he's following me what about you and
[42:00] me
[42:03] what about the first day you met god
[42:06] with some old preacher preaching or
[42:08] some other talking or grandmother
[42:10] talking whatever just
[42:14] can you think back of when that was
[42:18] what if that's where you started but ron
[42:20] said you start your eternal life right
[42:22] here at the altar
[42:24] now let me state it in this way of
[42:26] saying it you start your eternal life
[42:28] here in this world
[42:29] you didn't come into the world with
[42:30] eternal life because if you did there's
[42:32] no salvation involved there's nothing
[42:34] whatsoever
[42:38] you say well brother dale you're trying
[42:39] to say something that sounds like you're
[42:41] saying
[42:41] that we have something to do with our
[42:43] salvation we must accept it
[42:47] if we don't accept it it will do us no
[42:49] good amen
[42:52] did he make according to the bible and
[42:54] according to brother the prophet
[42:56] did god make
[42:59] a man and put him on the earth as a free
[43:02] moral agent
[43:07] is that true he made you a free mortal
[43:11] agent
[43:12] he can't override that
[43:16] but see we say but we hear the prophet
[43:18] the prophet said we had nothing to do
[43:19] with it
[43:20] that god saved me and i didn't have
[43:22] anything to do with it
[43:23] i know god i know i didn't have anything
[43:26] to do with the fact of
[43:27] eternal life or anything like that but
[43:28] we have to have a point of
[43:30] receiving it
[43:34] if you don't have the point of receiving
[43:36] it when are you going to get it
[43:38] that's right you're going to go back
[43:40] that way to try to find it or go that
[43:41] way to try to find it
[43:46] before knowledge
[43:49] means knowledge to know everything prior
[43:52] to when we got here
[43:58] you think peter and them thought about
[43:59] that when they walked off with the lord
[44:01] jesus
[44:01] and said well it's just predestinated
[44:10] i think whatever happened to abraham
[44:14] then made abraham just lay down
[44:15] everything he had
[44:18] and go follow a man
[44:22] and you know what he had no more contact
[44:23] with him for maybe years i don't know
[44:25] how long it is from
[44:27] 12 to 15 to 18 or whatever
[44:30] it doesn't make no difference if it was
[44:32] a week or a month or whatever
[44:33] he never had no contact with that man
[44:38] for a long time
[44:45] what are you trying to talk about
[44:47] brother dale i'm trying to talk about
[44:48] one thing for certain
[44:52] if you have eternal life today god saw
[44:55] you back there
[44:58] but he saw you the day you received it
[45:01] here
[45:02] may i quote the prophet jesus christ
[45:05] stood as a lamb slain before the
[45:07] foundation of the world
[45:09] now paraphrase it because i don't
[45:10] remember exactly but i know it's close
[45:12] but around said see there before the
[45:18] foundation of the world
[45:19] he said but that had to happen now 2000
[45:22] years ago
[45:23] to be in reality he said in other words
[45:27] the fact of it happening
[45:28] was 2 000 years ago it wasn't 4 thousand
[45:31] years ago
[45:32] it wasn't eight thousand go back before
[45:33] the foundation of the world or whatever
[45:35] you want to do with it
[45:36] no what it was it was right there
[45:45] it was right there in the book
[45:51] see our salvation is written in the book
[45:53] so you come over into the new testament
[45:55] with it you should be able to see more
[45:57] and to realize that you have to go
[45:59] through see abraham didn't go through
[46:00] justification sanctification
[46:02] the baptism of the holy ghost to try to
[46:04] come to the do it
[46:05] no he went through life as a natural man
[46:10] that every once in a while he'd make
[46:11] contact with that eternal god that
[46:13] melchizedek
[46:15] that person would come and appear to him
[46:17] and and and talk with him and
[46:19] tell him how his name is changed and all
[46:21] kinds of things but it never brought him
[46:22] to a new birth
[46:25] see you have to go through justification
[46:28] the call of god
[46:29] unto your life the bible speaks of the
[46:31] of the the what is
[46:33] the goodness of god calls us to
[46:36] repentance
[46:38] we must go through a sanctification
[46:41] a cleansing and setting aside
[46:45] and then we must go through the baptism
[46:47] of the holy ghost
[46:49] but what if we won't go what if we think
[46:52] we already have it because of this that
[46:54] or the other
[46:56] when i heard brother schweinsteiger
[46:58] preaching i always was eternal what i
[46:59] need to get eternal life when i always
[47:01] had eternal life
[47:03] now that's exactly what they're saying
[47:09] he said but you just don't understand
[47:11] eternal life
[47:12] i'll agree with you now because there's
[47:13] one thing for certain
[47:17] i believe the man christ jesus
[47:20] had within him while he was here in this
[47:24] world eternal life
[47:27] but there was only one way that could be
[47:30] transmitted to any man
[47:35] and that was through his death burial
[47:38] resurrection ascension
[47:39] and coming back on the dead pentecost
[47:43] then you're able to have eternal life
[47:47] outside of that all of our doctrines and
[47:49] ideas and things about what we always
[47:51] was
[47:51] that has nothing to do with it what are
[47:53] we now
[47:59] you realize we're living our
[48:00] predestination time we're we're in the
[48:02] destiny
[48:03] yesterday was a day today is another day
[48:11] we may rejoice in what we're doing one
[48:13] day but remember the next day we've got
[48:15] another day
[48:20] think about it was god
[48:23] planning on doing this
[48:29] or did he set back before the world and
[48:32] see it all
[48:34] by his foreknowledge
[48:38] if you say he was planning it
[48:42] but brother dale you just don't
[48:43] understand how we are the seed of god
[48:46] and he planned this and he planned that
[48:48] he couldn't plan it no different for
[48:49] anybody else
[48:50] and us he has to give everybody the same
[48:52] opportunity
[48:56] he had to offer it to everybody in the
[48:58] world or he's a respecter of person
[49:00] and he's a predeterminer without having
[49:02] a foreknowledge
[49:11] what about him having the foreknowledge
[49:13] to be able to stand here in this world
[49:14] and say father
[49:17] take me back and open up a little bit of
[49:19] the word and let me know how it was
[49:21] when me and you was together before the
[49:22] world paraphrasing it without you
[49:24] understand
[49:28] gives me the honor and the glory that we
[49:30] had before the world
[49:34] you know that before the world he stood
[49:35] as a lamb
[49:38] now come on folks i ain't so weak in my
[49:40] doctrine
[49:41] to understand that i don't understand
[49:43] one thing for certain
[49:44] because i've always explained it what
[49:46] happened with adam and eve in the garden
[49:49] one split second in the presence of
[49:51] almighty god with sin in your heart
[49:54] and you're dead i don't care who you are
[49:59] what kept adam and eve from being
[50:00] destroyed when sin had entered the
[50:02] picture in the garden
[50:09] was the fact that almighty god had
[50:11] already predetermined by his
[50:13] foreknowledge
[50:14] to be back there and he would die on the
[50:16] cross
[50:17] to take care of adam and eve
[50:22] what covered adam and eve was the
[50:24] predestination of almighty god
[50:26] the foreknowledge that he knew what he
[50:27] would do
[50:32] he could predetermine it yes
[50:36] but not preach not prearrange it
[50:43] he could predetermine by his
[50:46] foreknowledge
[50:51] like i've always said that's what wade
[50:52] was in on it one day when he was talking
[50:54] here
[50:54] i remember and he said hey daddy they
[50:56] really had me going
[50:58] because i'm a funny way of believing
[51:00] things i guess and
[51:02] i've just always been that way
[51:05] and i was trying to explain something
[51:07] one day about predestination and i said
[51:09] there was a girl over there that you
[51:11] know i could have dated and married her
[51:13] but if i'd have married her i'd have
[51:14] been a methodist preacher
[51:17] and he just kind of laughed about it but
[51:19] it took quite a while for him to
[51:20] understand what he's talking about
[51:23] i talked about this old baptist preacher
[51:26] that it took i think was
[51:28] seven eight or nine preachers to preach
[51:30] his funeral so you know he was a good
[51:31] man
[51:33] and i thought when i was seeing him you
[51:35] know and i thought well god
[51:37] why didn't you choose him
[51:42] why didn't you reveal this message to
[51:43] him
[51:45] knowing he's such a wonderful guy
[51:54] but see somewhere all he had to do was
[51:57] turn down just a little bit
[51:59] and that put him in the wrong side but
[52:02] that would have been god's foreknowledge
[52:07] the man by foreknowledge stood in a
[52:09] position
[52:10] before the foundation of the world but
[52:12] one day he came to that place
[52:19] you know that one of these days
[52:21] somebody's going to say
[52:25] the rapture is in motion and we're here
[52:29] and you know what it's going to put it
[52:31] that way
[52:35] why do you worry about anything when you
[52:36] why are you concerned about anything
[52:42] i'm concerned with one thing
[52:46] something happened in the man named
[52:48] abraham
[52:49] that made god stop
[52:56] he turned around is it abraham
[53:00] come on follow me he said
[53:03] i don't know what's going on i don't
[53:05] understand nothing about it but
[53:08] i got enough sense to know i got to
[53:10] follow him
[53:13] and see there was his predestination
[53:15] there was his destiny
[53:17] that was set before the world abraham's
[53:20] destiny was set
[53:21] before the world and there he had to
[53:23] meet god
[53:26] your destiny was set before the world
[53:28] ever begun
[53:32] whether we're predestinated to heaven or
[53:34] hell we are predestinated one way or the
[53:36] other
[53:41] see we make our own choice then
[53:44] choose you this day the bible says
[53:47] choose it in other words step out on
[53:55] i it you about it there i left that
[53:57] baptist church and
[54:00] i walked out i went to an old barbecue
[54:02] pit in the backyard and just sat down
[54:04] there squalled my heart out
[54:06] i said god i done messed it all up now
[54:12] i can't go back there
[54:16] so i just have to go on with you
[54:20] help me to understand
[54:28] i believe everything and everybody is
[54:30] predetermined
[54:32] but it's by for knowledge
[54:35] it's not picking and choosing it's by
[54:38] foreknowledge
[54:48] what causes god to put in your heart
[54:57] the ability to follow after him
[55:04] if he don't put it there you won't
[55:07] follow him
[55:11] oh i believe this message i believe
[55:13] everything the prophet said i believe
[55:14] well what about it then
[55:19] if there's a seed forever age there's a
[55:21] predestinated person to make that seed
[55:23] live
[55:24] because it's not a natural seed in the
[55:26] body it's a word
[55:31] he predestinated somebody to that place
[55:39] predestination looks back to
[55:42] foreknowledge
[55:44] foreknowledge then looks to destiny
[55:50] see i've heard people in the mess and
[55:52] you have to say oh
[55:53] i believe i was in the mind of god
[55:58] well so was judas
[56:02] is scary
[56:06] but you're not getting my point i'm
[56:08] talking about me
[56:10] what are you trying to do make yourself
[56:11] something
[56:13] i look at myself as being the biggest
[56:15] garbage can it could ever be
[56:19] old brother collie years ago i remember
[56:21] he was ministering a little bit and
[56:24] i got up here and told that i was the
[56:25] chiefest of all sinners he got up behind
[56:27] me on the next time he spoke
[56:29] and he rebuked me to high heaven he said
[56:31] he ain't never lived like i
[56:33] have and the rest of us lived i said
[56:36] brother callie
[56:37] that ain't gotta undo it cause that
[56:39] wasn't what i was talking about
[56:44] the chiefest of sinners is the one
[56:46] that's the closest
[56:50] closest to the truth
[56:54] judas is carrick must have been a pretty
[56:56] good guy because he was chosen by
[56:57] everybody to be the
[56:58] treasurer and all of the things there
[57:00] was no arguments no problems
[57:07] what are you saying i'm saying one thing
[57:12] what do you think about what triggered
[57:16] god to stop in your path
[57:23] and invite you to come with him
[57:28] when your neighbor looks like a way on a
[57:30] better guy and looks like and he talks
[57:32] about how that god has dealt with him
[57:34] and all kind of things i ain't going to
[57:36] argue with him
[57:37] you say no no no
[57:41] woman preacher come up and say god
[57:43] called me to preach
[57:44] for what if brother running and say he
[57:46] said i'm not going to tell her
[57:48] that god didn't call her he said but i
[57:51] will tell her
[57:52] it's not according to the word
[57:56] right
[58:00] but what's so odd is that that woman
[58:03] preacher can preach the gospel
[58:05] and the gift that is within her heart
[58:08] as a being what it is god can use that
[58:11] to call his children
[58:13] to salvation
[58:20] am i right that's right well i still see
[58:24] i can
[58:25] you're not looking at it right you're
[58:26] not looking at the anointing that's
[58:28] striking her instead of her personal
[58:30] it wasn't an anointing to abraham it was
[58:32] a reality hey wait a minute
[58:35] nobody has ever talked this away
[58:40] you ain't never said that about this
[58:42] prophet's message
[58:44] i've sat down and just sat there in my
[58:46] in this listening to him talking say
[58:49] never a man spake like that man
[58:55] because he could just bring it out so
[58:57] simple
[59:00] he'd say he predestinates by his
[59:03] foreknowledge
[59:10] somebody's foreknowledge i'm standing
[59:12] here tonight
[59:14] you're sitting where you are
[59:18] but god's foreknowledge
[59:23] but i just don't i'm just trying to get
[59:26] you to think about
[59:29] brother branham said i gave them to you
[59:31] last week he said
[59:32] god knew what abraham would do
[59:37] he said god knew that he would teach his
[59:39] children
[59:40] absolutely
[59:45] what was abraham a special guy
[59:48] no but there was just something about
[59:53] him
[59:55] that he loved god
[1:00:00] hebrews 11 and think of all of the great
[1:00:02] warriors of faith
[1:00:05] and how that each one of them
[1:00:09] had a connection to god in a special way
[1:00:15] what was that connection were they
[1:00:18] special people no
[1:00:19] no no don't do don't get on that line
[1:00:22] there was nothing special about them
[1:00:25] the special about abraham was he could
[1:00:27] believe god
[1:00:34] now come on he's he's called the father
[1:00:35] of faith and what is hebrews 11
[1:00:38] by faith abraham by faith this one by
[1:00:41] faith that one
[1:00:48] what about moses
[1:00:53] what about the guy who'd come up and i
[1:00:56] don't get in your ten commandments and
[1:00:58] correct brother branham
[1:01:00] he'll tell you brother i'm gonna tell
[1:01:02] you that moses's mother taught him
[1:01:04] while he's sitting on her knee according
[1:01:08] to the ten commandments moses didn't
[1:01:10] know at least about 45 50 years old
[1:01:12] and then he happened to read the
[1:01:14] hieroglyphics on the wall
[1:01:18] now according to the prophet
[1:01:23] moses knew all of his life he was the
[1:01:25] leader
[1:01:29] but he said i can't do it
[1:01:34] but moses you're predestinated to be the
[1:01:37] great deliverer
[1:01:39] he said that may be true but he ain't
[1:01:43] told me
[1:01:44] yet he ain't made that real yet
[1:01:53] one day on the back side of a desert
[1:01:54] facing a pillar of fire
[1:01:56] brother brown said he learned more about
[1:01:58] god what was it five minutes than he had
[1:02:00] of all of his life or something i mean
[1:02:01] so many years or so
[1:02:04] and what did he learn
[1:02:10] there's been something about me this
[1:02:12] he'd be thinking and something about me
[1:02:14] has been always kind of funny he said i
[1:02:15] thought it's just mama talking
[1:02:19] you know well she was telling him
[1:02:22] you are not the son of pharaoh's
[1:02:23] daughter that's what brother brown said
[1:02:25] she was telling me
[1:02:29] and he went out
[1:02:33] and he killed an egyptian
[1:02:36] trying to help his people
[1:02:40] trying to be the deliverer
[1:02:44] but that was not the one that god was
[1:02:46] looking for
[1:02:48] too much man left
[1:02:51] too much a problem how about me and you
[1:02:55] but when he met god on the backside of
[1:02:56] the desert that man went out
[1:02:59] and that god came in
[1:03:05] he said i can't do this i can't talk
[1:03:09] he said okay you're not be like that and
[1:03:12] act that when
[1:03:13] god spoke when he said i'll just i'll
[1:03:16] just give you error and he'll do you
[1:03:17] talking
[1:03:18] so everything moses would try to come up
[1:03:20] with god to just have it ready
[1:03:22] just in the natural you know just go
[1:03:23] ahead
[1:03:29] here goes moses now how you going to do
[1:03:31] it you're going to pack up and go over
[1:03:32] to a country like russia or something
[1:03:34] like that
[1:03:34] and you're going to walk in there you
[1:03:35] and another guy you know and you're
[1:03:37] going to walk in there and you say i
[1:03:38] uh i've come to take over
[1:03:43] right
[1:03:47] and you look over and there's one two
[1:03:49] the one i like
[1:03:50] is when he says they're in the scripture
[1:03:51] you know which one was and said there's
[1:03:54] more for us than it was of them
[1:03:57] elisha well he he could only count to
[1:03:59] two
[1:04:02] but when the eyes was opened to the man
[1:04:05] when he reached his predestinated
[1:04:07] determined spot
[1:04:10] he looked around and saw angels
[1:04:13] all around that man he says ain't no
[1:04:16] worried about it we'll just take over
[1:04:18] our whole world
[1:04:20] because he knew what was there with him
[1:04:23] see church you and i have got that
[1:04:24] realized i'll bring this back a little
[1:04:27] bit more in the message of
[1:04:28] predestination
[1:04:35] you know you can just take time and read
[1:04:38] if you don't believe it by what you're
[1:04:41] prophet that you've heard him say it
[1:04:44] if i've got to read it and they say this
[1:04:46] is on to you then
[1:04:47] there's one thing for certain that is
[1:04:50] not what contacted god
[1:04:52] what contacted god if you'll listen one
[1:04:54] minute now i'm trying to explain it
[1:04:56] what contacted god whether it be
[1:04:59] moses abraham
[1:05:02] david
[1:05:06] are the disciples or the prophet of god
[1:05:10] for our day
[1:05:13] did he run like everything try to get
[1:05:15] away from his calling
[1:05:19] then something happened one day and he
[1:05:20] just said i ain't running no more i'm
[1:05:23] sorry
[1:05:27] you realize that's exactly what calls
[1:05:29] you for salvation
[1:05:33] the goodness of god leadeth thee to
[1:05:34] repentance repentance is justification
[1:05:37] then you come to that and you come to
[1:05:39] the point of being sorry for your sins
[1:05:40] and you come to all of those things and
[1:05:42] and you're dealing with it in life then
[1:05:44] you come to sanctification then you come
[1:05:46] to the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:05:48] and all of those things fits in and all
[1:05:50] it is is just part of the plan of god
[1:05:55] part of his predestinated plan
[1:06:00] you understand what i'm trying to say
[1:06:04] if you have if if you've met god
[1:06:07] in the person of the baptism of the holy
[1:06:09] ghost the new birth
[1:06:10] as the bible preaches as the prophet
[1:06:12] preaches as the apostles all the people
[1:06:15] preaches it if you've met him like that
[1:06:17] then he'll come to you
[1:06:21] because he's got something to work on
[1:06:26] but if you don't know him like that
[1:06:30] then you don't know him as your savior
[1:06:33] that's why we've tried to explain it
[1:06:39] you can come through justification and
[1:06:41] come to sanctification
[1:06:43] and you know what you get new desires
[1:06:45] and new thoughts and everything
[1:06:47] at sanctification and you start loving
[1:06:49] god and his ways and wondering what's
[1:06:51] taking place in the world and the doings
[1:06:58] just don't get caught at that spot
[1:07:00] that's right
[1:07:01] go on just find you a place somewhere
[1:07:05] come on musician
[1:07:06] find you a place somewhere to get down
[1:07:08] and just say lord
[1:07:14] ever what you was there back there that
[1:07:16] caused you
[1:07:17] to stop with abraham
[1:07:22] the reason i said it and the reason i
[1:07:23] took is to do that part so you can
[1:07:25] you can say that it was through
[1:07:27] justification sanctions and baptism of
[1:07:28] the holy ghost
[1:07:29] in the new birth it caused it to pull
[1:07:31] over to god
[1:07:32] and you would follow that way abraham
[1:07:34] and him didn't have that
[1:07:36] that's why i've always preached it and
[1:07:38] always believed it
[1:07:42] abraham was a man
[1:07:50] and when god got through with him
[1:07:54] he had the father of faith
[1:07:58] he could use him
[1:08:02] sure he still had a lot of problems like
[1:08:04] i said give his wife away a couple of
[1:08:05] times all kind of thing
[1:08:06] happened in his life but yet still
[1:08:11] god never did back off because he told
[1:08:13] that king he said you better get down
[1:08:15] there
[1:08:16] and give that man back his wife and that
[1:08:18] king said look i didn't have nothing to
[1:08:20] do with all of this because they messed
[1:08:22] me up he said i don't care because
[1:08:23] that's my prophet
[1:08:26] and what you think about him ain't none
[1:08:27] of your business well he ought to be
[1:08:29] apologizing to me
[1:08:32] he said that might be right but he ain't
[1:08:34] your child he's mine
[1:08:38] and i contacted him one day and he's
[1:08:40] fathered me all these years
[1:08:43] can you say that you've followed god
[1:08:48] you're the funniest preacher ever heard
[1:08:50] because you talk about
[1:08:52] choosing and not choosing and what can
[1:08:54] it be
[1:08:59] did it go out of the book that
[1:09:02] god calling you to his salvation was the
[1:09:04] only thing that saved you because that
[1:09:05] was the blood of jesus christ
[1:09:11] you keep it simple
[1:09:16] the children god has
[1:09:19] spoken to you in your life
[1:09:22] and said come follow me
[1:09:29] just come follow me
[1:09:32] i'll take care of everything but lord i
[1:09:35] got so many problems i got this
[1:09:36] and just come follow me i'll take care
[1:09:40] of it
[1:09:42] if you don't ever think of one thing if
[1:09:45] you don't agree with me that's fine
[1:09:47] but i'll tell you this away and still
[1:09:49] remember it
[1:09:51] and that man abraham was standing down
[1:09:53] there there was a world full of people
[1:09:56] and god could have had anybody if your
[1:09:58] idea of predestination is according to
[1:10:00] truth
[1:10:01] god could have had anybody that he
[1:10:04] wanted
[1:10:05] because he created him he could have
[1:10:07] moved her path he could have moved the
[1:10:08] point
[1:10:09] but yet it wasn't there was one man
[1:10:13] one man that love god
[1:10:19] do you realize what i'm getting at do
[1:10:21] you love god
[1:10:24] are you afraid of him
[1:10:30] don't be afraid of him in all
[1:10:34] of the things of life don't be afraid of
[1:10:36] god
[1:10:39] sure we don't want to be in the presence
[1:10:42] of almighty god right
[1:10:44] because we're human beings but just
[1:10:47] remember
[1:10:49] he did call you you didn't call him
[1:10:54] but when it was finished you had to
[1:10:56] accept his call
[1:11:01] or it wouldn't be right predestination
[1:11:05] for knowledge made a reality
[1:11:09] in present tense time

[1:11:32] i want to serve my master
[1:11:37] i'd like for it to be said that i was
[1:11:40] his friend
[1:11:44] and the man that did not have the
[1:11:45] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:11:47] was that man and his name was abraham
[1:11:52] called the father of faith or the father
[1:11:55] of the faithful
[1:12:00] so you're saved by grace through
[1:12:04] faith that not of works lest any man
[1:12:06] should boast

[1:12:23] thoughts

[1:12:36] some reason that god come down to that
[1:12:38] man
[1:12:42] and he stopped
[1:12:46] and then only had a servant
[1:12:50] the father of faith

[1:12:54] of the uh hebrews 10 i mean excuse me
[1:12:57] hebrews 11
[1:12:58] almost every time it's by faith abraham

[1:20:08] come back out and try to find where
[1:20:09] brother doherty was at in the water
[1:20:12] and he was standing there he had the
[1:20:16] rod and reel in his hand because they
[1:20:18] were fishing
[1:20:20] he had to come back and find that place
[1:20:22] and find him until he found that rod
[1:20:24] and got it picked him up
[1:20:28] yeah his boots were filled up with water

[1:20:51] talking
[1:20:53] no telling how long he'd been under that
[1:20:54] water i believe it

[1:21:00] we've seen the sick healed the dead
[1:21:02] raised the thing
[1:21:04] i was thinking about randall the other
[1:21:05] day so he passed away just
[1:21:07] a few weeks ago or a month ago and i was
[1:21:10] thinking i thought well lord
[1:21:12] i guess it was just the point that i
[1:21:13] wasn't supposed to be over there because
[1:21:15] i thought a lot about going seeing him
[1:21:17] you know and we'd always got along but
[1:21:19] he'd tell you then he tell people we
[1:21:21] where we was at and hunting together he
[1:21:23] said wade and this man here so they
[1:21:25] prayed for me and said i was dead
[1:21:28] and i believe it but god brought him
[1:21:32] back to life
[1:21:33] i believe that too he'll do the same for
[1:21:36] all of us if we just believe it right
[1:21:37] that's right
[1:21:38] father we thank you for tonight and we
[1:21:40] pray that what we said is
[1:21:42] we've tried to make it a point lord to
[1:21:44] get us all to understand one thing
[1:21:47] that by your foreknowledge you've seen
[1:21:50] everything we'd be and where we are here
[1:21:52] tonight
[1:21:53] and everything's based on that lord it's
[1:21:56] not something for us to do and made us
[1:21:58] goody or anything else
[1:22:00] but it's what you said you said if we
[1:22:02] believe you
[1:22:03] you'd make it possible we believe you
[1:22:06] and we thank you
