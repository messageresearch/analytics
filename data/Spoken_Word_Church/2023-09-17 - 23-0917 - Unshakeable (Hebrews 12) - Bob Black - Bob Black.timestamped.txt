[0:00] I I think I I had uh kind of started
[0:03] meditating on this this is as we get to
[0:05] this scripture about where Paul's
[0:07] speaking on that heaven and earth will
[0:09] be shaken and um think about think about
[0:12] this topic I think it will go
[0:15] um kind of go right in line with what
[0:16] Brother Andy was speaking on yesterday
[0:18] that we've got to take a stand and
[0:21] don't move
[0:22] so let's just go to the Lord in prayer
[0:24] before we get into this study the Lord
[0:25] would just ask Lord that you'll just
[0:27] Quicken these words to us Lord Jesus and
[0:29] line these up in our heart to give us
[0:30] understanding Lord and I pray God that
[0:32] you're this Lord set the atmosphere
[0:34] today Lord for us to receive from you
[0:36] Lord and that Lord we'll we'll be ready
[0:39] to receive Lord as you speak to our
[0:41] hearts and and speak speak these things
[0:43] to our the different needs that we have
[0:45] Lord just be with brother Andrew this
[0:47] morning Lord and be with all of us today
[0:49] Lord and we just give these things over
[0:50] to you in your name amen
[0:54] and maybe just to set the tone I I'm
[0:57] just looking at this scripture in Psalms
[0:59] chapter 16 8 where David uh crying out
[1:02] in in his in his song I have set the
[1:05] lord always before me because he is at
[1:07] my right hand I shall not be moved and
[1:11] um you know even brother Andrew was
[1:12] speaking yesterday the word should
[1:14] always should take preeminence over
[1:15] everything else in our life the word
[1:18] even though over you know you get to a
[1:20] place where you know you you do not even
[1:23] maybe concerned so much about your
[1:26] comfort or the things of life anymore
[1:27] because the word the word should Trump
[1:30] everything else and as we study these
[1:34] things out about being
[1:36] unmoved and the face of all kinds of
[1:39] obstacles and circumstances and stuff
[1:40] that's really the only way to be
[1:42] unmovable is unshakeable is to put God's
[1:44] word first and to stand upon his word
[1:47] like a rock that you're resting on the
[1:50] rock of Revelation that's unmovable if
[1:52] you've got that unmovable foundation so
[1:54] let's keep that in mind as we study
[1:56] these things out that Paul's saying is
[1:58] we'll just kind of background in verse
[2:00] 18 of Hebrews 12 he said for a year not
[2:02] come
[2:03] onto the mount that might be touched
[2:06] and that burned with fire
[2:08] nor unto Blackness and darkness and
[2:10] Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and
[2:13] the voice of Words which voice they that
[2:15] heard and treated that the word should
[2:17] not be spoken to them anymore think
[2:19] about what a scary thing this was to
[2:20] witness to heard hear the the word of
[2:23] God being spoken sound like a trumpet
[2:25] and all of these things black the the
[2:27] Mount Sinai being covered in darkness
[2:30] and and a very scary situation that
[2:33] Paul's saying we're not we're not at
[2:35] that place now
[2:36] where if you even touch the mountain
[2:37] you're gonna die we've come to a place
[2:39] where God has given us a way to approach
[2:41] him
[2:42] for they could not endure that which was
[2:44] commanded of them so much as a beast
[2:46] beast touched the mountain they shall be
[2:47] stoned or thrust through with a dart and
[2:50] so terrible was the sight that Moses
[2:52] said I exceedingly fear and Quake
[2:55] now just to kind of think about this who
[2:58] is Paul talking to to so that we
[3:00] understand this correctly Paul's talking
[3:02] to the in in the whole book of Hebrews
[3:04] that we've been studying out he's
[3:05] talking to the saved Hebrews the ones
[3:07] that are Christians that have accepted
[3:09] Jesus Christ as their Savior and needs
[3:11] some encouragement don't give up you're
[3:13] running a race and so forth
[3:15] he's also talking to unbelieving Hebrews
[3:18] to to convince them that this Jesus that
[3:21] has come is greater than all the angels
[3:23] as he said in Hebrews one he's greater
[3:25] than any messenger he's the one that
[3:27] he's the uh he he's the express image of
[3:30] God he's all these things that Paul laid
[3:32] out all through the Hebrews to convince
[3:34] them of who he is and now he's also now
[3:36] think about this he's also speaking to
[3:38] the Hebrews who will listen to the to
[3:40] the two witnesses there in that Jacob
[3:42] period of Jacob's trouble after the
[3:44] bride is already gone that will look
[3:46] back to the things that Paul has already
[3:48] written that they're not even reading it
[3:50] maybe yet but one day they will and
[3:52] they'll look back to what Paul said and
[3:54] be reminded of all these things that
[3:56] Paul said to convince them of who Jesus
[3:58] Christ is so he's speaking to Hebrews
[4:00] but he's really speaking to all these
[4:02] different classes of Hebrews so that'll
[4:06] help us maybe as we study this out
[4:07] further
[4:08] and they Paul was saying in Hebrews 12
[4:10] but ye are come unto Mount Zion unto the
[4:13] city of the Living God we've got an
[4:15] approach to these Heavenly things the
[4:18] Heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable
[4:20] company of angels that he talked about
[4:22] in Hebrews chapter 1 that we're
[4:23] ministered by Angels he's talking about
[4:25] all this heavenly atmosphere that we've
[4:27] got an approach to to the general
[4:29] assembly and Church of the firstborn now
[4:33] he's talking to these Hebrews that have
[4:34] become Christians they're not they're
[4:36] not just part of like a they're not just
[4:38] Jews anymore they're part of the Church
[4:40] of the firstborn the only begotten of
[4:44] the father he's the Christ was born to
[4:47] start something to so that we can all be
[4:49] part of that one body right which are
[4:52] written in heaven if aren't like Jesus
[4:54] said don't don't be uh don't Rejoice
[4:57] because that you have power he told his
[4:59] disciples don't Rejoice that you have
[5:01] power to cast out devils and all those
[5:02] things but Rejoice that your names are
[5:05] written in heaven so these are the
[5:07] things that Paul is speaking of
[5:09] that we have come to these things and to
[5:11] God the judge of all
[5:13] into the spirits of just men made
[5:16] perfect how are we made perfect by the
[5:18] blood of Jesus Christ that his life
[5:20] could live in us and that's what we have
[5:22] come to that they couldn't come to in
[5:24] the Old Testament
[5:25] and in verse 24 into Jesus the mediator
[5:29] of the New Covenant and to the blood of
[5:31] sprinkling that speaketh better things
[5:34] than that of Abel now think about all
[5:36] these things that speak that that that
[5:37] scene that we were just looking at that
[5:39] God spoke from Heaven at Mount Sinai and
[5:42] his voice caused Moses to quake and
[5:45] everybody was fearful and Abel spoke but
[5:48] now he Paul is telling us that that the
[5:50] blood of Jesus Christ speaks greater
[5:53] things than Abel spoke and where is it
[5:55] speaking from so we've got to understand
[5:57] this frame of reference so that we can
[5:59] understand what Paul's talking about he
[6:00] speaks from The Mercy Seat the blood of
[6:04] Christ speaks better think what did Abel
[6:06] what did Abel speak he spoke I'm
[6:08] innocent now what did Christ's blood
[6:10] speak I'm innocent and I've paid the
[6:13] price I an innocent man that totally
[6:17] innocent paid the price for you for the
[6:19] guilty so that you wouldn't have to stay
[6:22] in judgment and that's what the blood
[6:24] speaks this morning
[6:26] is it Christ died for you and sent his
[6:29] life back into you and it's speaking now
[6:31] on your behalf that when you do
[6:34] something wrong or commit little sins of
[6:36] life that his blood is speaking to cover
[6:38] you as an atonement
[6:41] now see if we can recognize that that's
[6:43] what Paul's speaking of so he's saying
[6:45] in verse 25 see that you refuse not him
[6:48] that speaketh now his life the life that
[6:51] he gave on the cross oh as he died there
[6:54] on the cross and he cried out it is
[6:56] finished as his blood dripped down on
[6:58] the ground and now that blood that life
[7:00] that's in the blood is now speaking back
[7:01] from the word mercy seed and he's saying
[7:03] don't refuse the one that's speaking see
[7:07] that you refused not him that speaketh
[7:08] forth they escaped not who refused him
[7:10] that spake on Earth much more shall not
[7:13] we escape if we turn away from him that
[7:16] speaketh from heaven speaketh from
[7:18] Heaven he's speaking from The Mercy Seat
[7:20] because the life that was was given on
[7:23] the cross is is not is not on the cross
[7:25] anymore but now he's speaking as a
[7:28] testimony that he has died for you and
[7:30] his life is is covering over his
[7:32] covering over your life amen amen and he
[7:35] said his in verse 26 whose voice then
[7:37] shook the Earth but now he hath promised
[7:40] saying yet once more I shake not the
[7:42] Earth only but also heaven now you think
[7:46] about his voice his voice in the Old
[7:49] Testament speaking and scaring all the
[7:51] the children of Israel speaking from on
[7:53] Mount Sinai causing Moses to quake and
[7:55] then that same voice that spoke to them
[7:57] speaking there on the cross
[7:59] I got it written here in Matthew chapter
[8:01] 27 and verse 50. Jesus when he had cried
[8:04] again with a loud voice yielded up The
[8:06] Ghost and what happened it shook
[8:08] everything that boy and behold the veil
[8:10] of the temple was written and Twain From
[8:12] the top to the bottom and the Earth did
[8:15] quake and the Rocks rent
[8:18] why why did he speak it was the blood he
[8:21] was given his life there on the cross
[8:23] and that that as he spoke that he as he
[8:27] gave up the ghost that blood dripping
[8:29] down as an atonement now now we got a
[8:32] promise here
[8:33] that that uh yet once more I shake not
[8:37] the Earth only but also heaven
[8:40] now you go back to hagiah 267 and that's
[8:43] where Paul is referencing these things
[8:44] and and also Deuteronomy 4 you can read
[8:48] and as you if you want to study these
[8:49] things out but in haggai 267 it says for
[8:52] thus saith the Lord of hosts now again
[8:54] think about who's Paul speaking to he's
[8:56] speaking to the Hebrews the Hebrews and
[8:59] one day there's going to be Hebrews uh
[9:02] during that six seal period where the
[9:06] the Earth is shaking and and there's two
[9:08] witnesses preaching and they're going to
[9:10] be delivering a message that points back
[9:12] to what of course what we believe today
[9:14] but but really points back to what Paul
[9:17] spoke of in the book of Hebrews that
[9:19] we're reading now and this is what
[9:21] hagiah prophesied of he said thus saith
[9:24] the Lord of hosts yet once it is a
[9:25] little while and I will shake the
[9:28] heavens
[9:29] and the earth and the Sea and the dry
[9:32] land and I will shake All Nations and
[9:35] the desire of all Nations shall come and
[9:38] I will fill this house house with Glory
[9:40] saith the Lord of hosts now now what
[9:42] does it mean to shake I've got my little
[9:44] diagram here of the 70th week and you
[9:47] can see bombs dropping and oh this think
[9:49] about that the voice of the message of
[9:51] those two prophets shaken shaken the
[9:54] religion of the day shaking the
[9:56] Pharisees and then the bombs dropping
[9:59] and the whole Earth being shaken during
[10:01] that period is everything is shaken to
[10:03] get what to get to get the the whole
[10:05] earth prepared for the Advent of Christ
[10:08] to return to Christ to return with his
[10:10] bride and ride in and everything will be
[10:13] that's God God's got us so think about
[10:15] what a shaking is a shaking is
[10:18] a significant transformation or upheaval
[10:22] it just shakes everything it transforms
[10:24] everything
[10:25] the Fulfillment of every prophetic
[10:28] expectation all these prophecies leading
[10:31] up and then God comes on the scene and
[10:33] just shakes everything and makes you
[10:35] think different makes things look
[10:37] different shakes your mind to realize
[10:40] that God is vindicating his word
[10:42] the removal of all that is temporary
[10:46] imperfect and corrupt now think about
[10:48] this from a prophetic standpoint think
[10:50] about it from the from the standpoint of
[10:52] you hearing the word that the word is
[10:55] have an effect in your life and it shook
[10:57] you and and all the things that aren't
[10:58] supposed to be there begin to drop away
[11:00] as God's shaking you and the only thing
[11:03] that will remain is the things that
[11:04] cannot be shaken and what's what does
[11:06] that mean that the faith the revelation
[11:08] of Jesus Christ in you will be what's
[11:11] left at the end of it that you believe
[11:13] in God's word and all this world begins
[11:15] to shake away and drop away from yes
[11:17] God's word begins to claim your life
[11:21] and that's what the Sixth Seal is about
[11:22] and you can I'm not gonna we could I'm
[11:26] not going to go too much into this but
[11:27] if you go back and study out Revelations
[11:29] chapter 6 and Matthew 24 let's read
[11:32] Matthew 24 real quick and just not to
[11:34] not to spend too much time on this but
[11:36] it says Jesus said immediately after the
[11:39] tribulation of those days shall the sun
[11:40] be darkened and the moon shall not give
[11:42] her light and the Stars shall fall from
[11:44] Heaven and the powers of Heaven shall be
[11:46] shaken and then shall appear the sign of
[11:49] the son of man in heaven and then shall
[11:51] all the tribes of the earth mourn and
[11:52] they shall see the son of man coming in
[11:54] the Clouds Of Heaven with power and
[11:55] great glory and he shall send his angels
[11:58] with a great sound of a trumpet and they
[12:01] shall gather together his elect from the
[12:02] Four Winds from one end of Heaven to the
[12:05] other now you think about the whole
[12:07] Earth being shaken to prepare a place
[12:10] for God and his bride to come and live
[12:13] on
[12:14] and Paul said it said in verse 27 and
[12:16] this word yet once more signifies the
[12:19] removing of those things that are shaken
[12:22] I've got here a picture of this that
[12:23] movie that was made about Los Angeles
[12:25] sliding into the sea isn't that
[12:27] interesting they actually made a
[12:28] Hollywood movie about what brother
[12:30] Branham prophesied would one day come to
[12:32] pass
[12:33] as the whole earth is shaken the
[12:36] removing of those things that are shaken
[12:38] as of those things that are made that
[12:39] those things which cannot be shaken May
[12:43] remain
[12:44] and brother Brown said in the layout of
[12:46] seeking Church 8 he said he is going to
[12:48] blast and rock this sin cursed world my
[12:51] brother my sister and there is only one
[12:53] place that can stand that shock and that
[12:56] is in the fold of the Lord Jesus and I
[12:59] would beseech you while God's Mercy is
[13:01] still available to you that you give
[13:03] your whole life unreservedly to Jesus
[13:06] Christ who is the faithful Shepherd will
[13:08] save you and care for you and present
[13:10] you faultless in glory with exceeding
[13:12] great joy now you see the shaking lies
[13:16] ahead there's a shaking going on as you
[13:18] hear the word but there's a shaking like
[13:20] that look at this picture who would want
[13:22] to be here when all of these things
[13:24] happen when the world begins to shake
[13:26] and bonds begin to drop and you know
[13:28] it's a a great scary thing that I think
[13:31] should encourage all of us to make sure
[13:33] that we're at the place that we we're
[13:35] supposed to be in Christ because if
[13:37] you're not in Christ you'll be the only
[13:40] place that cannot be shaken the only
[13:42] place that is unshakable is is in Christ
[13:45] where your whole life is built upon a
[13:47] solid rock of a revelation of Jesus
[13:49] Christ like when Peter when when Peter
[13:51] was sitting there listening to Jesus and
[13:53] Jesus asked him one day who do you say
[13:56] that I the son of man am and he said
[13:58] Thou Art he said fellatian blood is not
[14:01] revealed as to you when when Peter
[14:02] answered back Thou Art the Christ the
[14:05] son of the Living God because he he was
[14:07] he was basing everything that he knew
[14:09] upon a revelation that God had given to
[14:11] him and Jesus called us this Parable in
[14:15] Matthew chapter 7. he said therefore
[14:16] whosoever heareth these sayings of mine
[14:18] and do with them I will liken him unto a
[14:20] wise man which built his house upon a
[14:22] rock and the rain descended and the
[14:25] floods came and the winds blew and beat
[14:26] upon that house and it fell not for it
[14:29] was founded upon a rock and everyone
[14:31] that heareth these sayings of mine and
[14:33] doeth them not shall be lockened into a
[14:35] foolish man which built his house upon
[14:37] the sand and the rain descended and the
[14:40] floods came and the winds blew and beat
[14:42] upon that house and it fell and gray was
[14:44] the fall of it now so what can we get
[14:47] from this lesson if you built your whole
[14:49] life and everything that you are and
[14:52] everything that you ever hope to be is
[14:53] built upon a revelation of Jesus Christ
[14:56] then you have confidence that you are
[14:58] built your life is built upon something
[15:00] that is unshakable you can have
[15:02] confidence and the unmovable
[15:04] unshakableness the immutable counsel of
[15:07] a word of God that's not corrupt that
[15:09] will stand every test of time
[15:12] now if we keep reading Paul said in
[15:15] verse 28 he said wherefore we receiving
[15:17] a kingdom which cannot be moved cannot
[15:20] be moved let us have Grace whereby we
[15:23] may serve God acceptably with reverence
[15:26] and godly fear
[15:28] knowing knowing that there's there's a
[15:31] price to pay if you don't rest in Jesus
[15:35] Christ
[15:35] for our God is a consuming fire
[15:39] now let's tie this in back with the rest
[15:42] of the scripture Our God is a consuming
[15:45] fire that means that means that let's
[15:48] tie this in with Malachi in Malachi
[15:51] chapter 4 verse 1 he said for behold the
[15:53] day cometh that shall burn as an oven
[15:57] and all the proud yeah and all that do
[16:00] wickedly shall be stubble
[16:02] and the day that cometh shall burn them
[16:04] up saith the Lord of hosts that it shall
[16:07] leave them neither root nor branch
[16:10] but unto you that fear my name shall the
[16:13] son of righteousness now think about a
[16:15] son s-u-n is a ball of Fire
[16:20] the son of righteousness arise with
[16:24] healing in his wings
[16:25] and ye shall go forth and grow up as
[16:28] calves of the stall now the reason that
[16:31] we're reading this is there's a lot of
[16:33] people in the message today that say
[16:34] that Malachi 456 says not speaking of
[16:37] what we're we believe it's speaking of
[16:39] but look at look at what Malachi 4 is
[16:41] talking about it's talking about that
[16:43] day
[16:44] that hagiah prophesied of the shaking
[16:46] the burn of the burning of the the God
[16:49] is going to consume all the that he's
[16:51] going to just burn shall burn them up
[16:54] saith the Lord of hosts but before that
[16:56] comes he's going to send a message he's
[16:59] going to send a message that will turn
[17:00] our hearts back to the original face of
[17:03] the Pentecostal fathers and he's in
[17:06] Malachi 4.
[17:08] did I skip over and he shall tread down
[17:10] the wicked for they shall be ashes Under
[17:12] The Souls of your feet in the day that I
[17:14] shall do this saith the Lord of hosts
[17:16] remember ye the law of Moses my servant
[17:19] which I commanded unto him an oral for
[17:22] all Israel with the statutes and
[17:24] judgments
[17:25] behold I will send you Elijah the
[17:27] prophet before the coming of the great
[17:28] and Dreadful day of the Lord and he
[17:31] shall turn the heart of the fathers to
[17:32] the children and the Heart of the
[17:34] children to their fathers lest I come
[17:37] and smite the Earth with a curse and
[17:39] brother Brown said in the layout I see
[17:41] in church 8 he said now when John came
[17:43] as Elijah he turned the hearts of the
[17:45] Israelites the hearts of the children
[17:47] that was then accepting his message the
[17:50] hearts of the fathers to the children
[17:53] but when he comes this time he's going
[17:56] to turn the hearts of the church back to
[17:59] the Pentecostal fathers see it's a vice
[18:01] versa you get it now read it now let's
[18:04] let's see what brother Rams said as
[18:05] we're closing up here talking about
[18:07] shaking talking about something that
[18:09] will be unshakable unmovable and brother
[18:12] Brown said in the message be not afraid
[18:14] he said this is my Ministry that he'd
[18:17] give me a gift and that gift is to shake
[18:21] the church to bring it to a recognition
[18:23] of the coming of Christ The Return of
[18:26] the spirit of God and the church
[18:28] and serge we would see Jesus he said
[18:30] last night I was talking on the subject
[18:33] of expectations tonight I was going to
[18:35] pray for the sick now in the coming part
[18:37] next tomorrow night beginning we want to
[18:39] start on the Evangelistic type of
[18:40] message maybe the coming of the Lord the
[18:43] mark of the beast the Seal of God the
[18:47] 144 thousand the four writers of
[18:50] Revelations
[18:51] well I believe those messages are what
[18:54] we got to get to the people to wake them
[18:57] up shake them to show them that we I see
[19:00] the great results in the seven Church
[19:02] ages I would go through that again if I
[19:04] thought it would help here how the god
[19:06] did bless it now let me warn the people
[19:08] again and again
[19:10] did not expect the last Shake of God in
[19:12] the church to be a universal thing it
[19:15] isn't going to be it's to the church
[19:17] it's the great things that will happen
[19:19] with the people in the little minority
[19:20] that's the little group that God shakes
[19:23] to get ready to go
[19:26] and sirs we would see Jesus again he
[19:28] said God manifesting himself in his
[19:30] church among his people Jesus said here
[19:33] was God manifested in a man Jesus Christ
[19:35] the same yesterday today and forever the
[19:38] church has come through all kinds of
[19:40] signs well then when God shakes the last
[19:44] sign before them they stare into space I
[19:48] think that's one of the worst things to
[19:50] kind of observe the spiritual condition
[19:51] of the age is that people just don't
[19:53] want to be in church anymore they just
[19:55] don't want the word anymore and when
[19:57] it's shaking right in their face they
[19:59] stare back at it they won't come to a
[20:01] youth meeting they won't gather together
[20:03] they won't drive the other day we were
[20:05] in the car and we were driving past a
[20:07] bunch of people standing in the rain for
[20:09] a car show and they were out there in
[20:11] for that car show to look at cars but
[20:13] people will rather go to drive to see
[20:16] cars than to come to a meeting where
[20:18] they can hear the word of God when God
[20:20] shakes it before them all they do is
[20:21] stare and say well it doesn't excite me
[20:24] anymore but that's what this message is
[20:27] for is to shake the people to wake them
[20:29] up to realize that God is doing
[20:31] something and the message Messiah he
[20:33] said this gospel ain't going to shake
[20:35] the world it's not world shaking it's
[20:38] Church shaking it shakes the church
[20:40] right now in these last few years the
[20:43] church has been shook like it never and
[20:46] the world knows nothing about it it
[20:48] wasn't supposed to shake the world
[20:50] they're dead anyhow you can't shake them
[20:53] old dead carcasses out there they're
[20:55] twice dead plucked up by the roots how
[20:57] can you do it well I belong to well I go
[20:59] ahead and belong to it see you can't
[21:01] shake them well grandmother did so and
[21:03] so that's no matter what grandmother
[21:05] done what's God doing now this is the
[21:09] light walk in it grandmother lived in
[21:11] her days it was all right but you can't
[21:13] live in her life why don't you wear her
[21:16] clothes then sister maybe that was just
[21:18] a little too ranked but no you want to
[21:20] take her church but you won't wear her
[21:22] clothes
[21:23] and then the world is again falling
[21:25] apart now if you want to read what a
[21:27] message about what Paul is speaking of
[21:30] here in Hebrews chapter 12 go listen to
[21:33] the sermon the world is falling apart
[21:35] it's in that sermon where he says it
[21:37] will be only a handful of people that go
[21:40] in the Rapture I think the statement
[21:41] like that should stir us all up as we
[21:44] read these things that to shake us he
[21:46] said but God hasn't left us without any
[21:48] witness or standard that we should stand
[21:50] by that's this word he said let every
[21:53] man's word be a lie and mine be the
[21:55] truth that's right for both heavens and
[21:57] earth will pass away we're told here
[22:00] that we receive a kingdom that cannot be
[22:02] moved yes sir when all these worldly
[22:05] kingdoms are falling now and the whole
[22:07] world falling apart yet we are baptized
[22:10] into a kingdom that cannot be moved what
[22:13] are you talking about I'm talking about
[22:14] a kingdom that is unshakable we receive
[22:17] a kingdom so when the World falls apart
[22:19] we are born into this Kingdom that
[22:22] cannot fall apart yes it's God's Eternal
[22:25] Word and we stand on that it can never
[22:28] fall apart and we'll close on this uh
[22:31] this quote as the musicians get ready to
[22:33] come forward in his presence brother
[22:35] Brown said this is evangelism this is
[22:38] the time to shake people this is the
[22:40] time that God said there come a time he
[22:43] shook him Mount Sinai one time
[22:45] but they'd come a shaking again that he
[22:48] wouldn't only Shake Mount Sinai but he'd
[22:51] Shake everything that could be moved but
[22:53] did you notice the rest of the scripture
[22:55] but we receive a kingdom that cannot be
[22:58] moved Hallelujah everything that can be
[23:00] shook will be shaken the heavens will
[23:03] shake the Earth will shake heavens and
[23:05] earth will pass away but that word shall
[23:08] never pass away
[23:09] for Upon This Rock I'll build my church
[23:12] and the Gates of Hell will never Prevail
[23:14] against it everything that can be shook
[23:17] will be shaken but we receive a kingdom
[23:19] which is the word of God himself and God
[23:22] is his word he don't shake himself amen
[23:25] oh my but we receive a kingdom that
[23:29] cannot be moved it's unshakable said
[23:33] Paul the Hebrew writer God bless you
[23:35] we'll just stop on that
[23:39] thank you
[23:41] [Applause]
[24:04] [Music]
[24:21] thank you
[25:09] all right
