Gospel lighthouse a convention that will take place in Edmonton that is transpiring even as we speak now and to to be a part of these things is a very special very special time and we what we wanted to do been on been in contact with brother ad and brother Harold and back and forth on the details of things we know that there's no way possibly that you all could go to Edmonton every single one of you and there's no way possible that all of them could come here but this way we have a way of entering in and assembling ourselves together around the revealed word of the hour this evening and to be a part of these services and we just want you to be aware that there is a whole nother church on the other side now we have we have hundreds of listeners and subscribers that are watching and and call themselves a part of this church but tonight our our church has doubled so just know that then the setting has been set and the meeting is in place and the angel of the Lord has has confirmed these things and set some things in order that we know that we're just right in the mind of God and so we just want to make you aware those things will be will be welcomed and then the church here just in a

of the portion of a body of believers in Edmonton that have gathered to to worship with you in these meetings if the brothers could hit the lights at the back end so that you can see these are the believers that you are joined with tonight by the way of the internet and we are uniting our faiths together so now a word from the pastor at endtime message Tabernacle god bless you greetings to all the saints that are gathered at Full Gospel Light House Tabernacle in Virginia on this July weekend of 2020 on behalf of brother Harold Hildebrandt our senior pastor and myself at hammer Meister the associate pastor and the Saint said anti message Tabernacle we greet you with the love of Christ we give special greetings to our precious friend brother Ron Spencer his dear wife sister Connie and then the children Andrew and Matthew and Whitney and their families and now to also all of you that have gathered together and had been so faithful in supporting all these years this weekend represents a unique opportunity for us to join together in a wonderful and unique way the seeds of this have been sown many years ago when brother Ron became a part of our annual July meetings we cannot even begin to tell you of all the the wonderful things that God has accomplished in the many years that we have come together and brother Ron has ministered for us only eternity will tell so for you that have supported him and sent him in prayer we thank you and then it was some years ago that God added another part to this when brother Andrew came and ministered alongside brother Ron how we appreciate it God using him subsequently he's come and ministered a graduation for us and been a blessing to us showing that the call of God is even greater than a family time we appreciate brother Andrew as well as a result of this relationship brother Ron has held a special place in our heart he has been ordained of God for such a hour even as this we have been with you in the year in the time of trial these last months no I would like to let you know that even while you have been under great burden there have been a group of believers in Edmonton that have been continually praying and supporting you and bringing you all before the throne of grace we are here in 2020 seemingly bound by borders restrictions and the constraints that have been put on the world as a whole for many this has become a new way of life the world seemingly has been put on hold economies have been put on hold and it seems that the devil wants to put God on hold well I'd like to say God has never been stopped by anything the devil has ever done and the program of God is moving on he is still moving in the hearts of his people and he is rising to show his glory I believe in a greater way than ever before so the restriction that have seemingly limited the conventional way of doing things are not a deterrent but rather an opportunity of God to raise up in a greater way the seeds of this were sown even last year brother ron was ministering at our meetings when a sister thousands of miles away was moved upon in a supernatural way while listening to the service god delivered her and set her free in a miraculous way well I believe that that same God is here even today he is eternal he is omniscient and he is not bound by time borders and distance all things are possible if we can only open our hearts to believe so this weekend as brother Andrew and brother Ron Minister we believe God has already gone before us he is with us even now he will be with us even in a greater way in the days to follow what is great about this is that instead of sending just brother Ron or brother Andrew you all get to come and be a part of this as well so we want to say we're all coming together you're coming to us we're coming to you in the spirit of Christ we are joining together in a way that God will soon make manifest in a great way in the rapture that we are looking forward to God's Spirit will sweep over the world not bound by borders not bound by culture not bound by people sometimes but rather will bring us into an eternal realm I believe that even now that eternal one is with us and so I would ask you as your pastor and he is associate minister this weekend I will ask that you play your part pull on the word create an atmosphere let the word of God be inscribed into the time and the sands that have we been walking on for others to follow him as it was in the times of Nehemiah they were building a wall and it was a great role in the process of the restoration but they were bound by gaps in the wall where there was distance between the peoples it seemed that whenever the enemy would look at someone in isolation they would seize on that opportunity but Nehemiah brought the people together in a great way so that they were in one heart and one mind while the workers built there were those with swords and spears and when the enemy would attack one side they would gather together and help one another today we are not separated by gaps but we are not separated by gaps and the clip cut off right there but he said to tell you like Nehemiah stomm in time message Tabernacle is there to fill the gap for a full gospel light house Tabernacle we are pulling for one another we are brothers and sisters standing shoulder to shoulder let's lay the enemy together God richly bless you so god bless you brother had and the believers at endtime message Tabernacle it is it is an absolute honor to be a part of these these meetings to be a part of this time it's it's a different time for all of us we're all gathered together but we'd like to thank brother ed and brother Harold for the opportunity to be able to speak at their convention and I know that the setting is different and the circumstances have changed some things but I believe that God has ordained these things for this meeting to still be able to carry on and for Full Gospel lighthouse to be a part of those things we appreciate brother Harold and brother had their their burden to to see the God of omnipotence that we are seeing here and very present and acting in our midst that in these meetings that God will do supernatural things and the miracles that we're hearing week to week we will hear more from these meetings than ever before we know that we're serving a God of omnipotence and omnipresence and there's no distance no time to our God and though we may be thousands of miles away the angel of the Lord is ever present for he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you and while we speak this this weekend the word of life here at Full Gospel lighthouse and that evening at the end time message Tabernacle I admonish you to let the Holy Ghost overshadow you and brood over your life and minister to you and reach out you reach out in your faith and touch the Living God because our God is big enough our God is strong enough and what the enemy has is not enough to stop us so let's move forward in these meetings and let us have a grand time in the presence of the Lord maybe as we stand before we go to the reading of the word maybe we could sing that song only believe all things are possible you have your Bibles will turn over in the Book of Daniel chapter 6 in merciful we believe all things are possible he won't Oh oh that all things are possible only me now for for you that that don't know where we're grabbing from thank you musicians but I'd like to I'd like to carry on a thought that that I have been looking at and it's more than a thought but I believe that it came from the mind of God we are very acquainted with the general brother Roy Shrewsbury that is embed West Virginia pastors a very nice church there and believers of this endtime message and brother Roy had called brother on several times just to bring you up to speed to where we are so that everyone is up on the same basis and he called brother on at the very beginning of this journey that he was facing with cancer brother Roy called with Iran twice and he told him no brother on your you're going into a cave that no one else has ever came out of but I say by the Spirit of the Lord you will say like Daniel before the lines then Oh King I'll see you in the morning and tonight I'd like to focus our fault on on the force of God that is moving a people into the miraculous I realize that there are men of God and mighty men of God that would never dare say anything unless God speaks it so we realize that there has to be a move of the Spirit of God that would force a man to speak those things so tonight by the help of the Lord I'd like to speak to you on moved by the spirit Daniel chapter 6 and verse 4 the Bible says here then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom but they could find none the occasion nor fault for as much as he was faithful neither was there any error or fault found in him then said these these men we shall not find any occasion against this Daniel except we find it against him concerning the law of his God then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king and said that thus unto him King Darius live forever all the presidents of the kingdom the governors and the princes the counselors and the captains have consulted together to establish a royal statute and to make a firm decree that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for 30 days save of the O king he shall be cast into the den of lions so we noticed the trap that the enemy is wanting to set for the believers now O King established the decree and sound the writing that it be not changed according to the law of the Medes and Persians which alter earth not wherefore wherefore King Darius signed the writing and the decree now when now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being open in his chamber to ward Jerusalem he kneeled up his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God as he did a four time so the circumstance that he was in did not change his behavior nor his character but his character was already in place before the trap was set amen let's bow our hearts before the Lord this afternoon dear Heavenly Father we have gathered in a very special way this evening a father the Bible tells us that we assemble ourselves and we not forsake it father and Lord Jesus there are meetings that have been on put on hold that had been cancelled conventions cancelled and meeting set and postponed but father you have placed it on the heart of men to be able to bring and present a meeting in such a way that we realized that we are not sitting here alone in in our own congregations but we're sitting here as a mini member body of Christ and as we've gathered here this this evening Lord to bring forth the preaching of the word we realize that we're absolutely nothing without you that we cannot do anything unless you have your complete control in this service we know that we are incapable of bringing forth the word now man can flip back the pages of the Bible but man cannot reveal it it takes the Holy Spirit to reveal it but when the Holy Spirit begins to reveal the word of the hour then there is nothing that the enemy can do to stop that revelation from bringing and coming forth and manifesting sons and daughters of God like never before I pray that you would go across the audience they're an endtime message Tabernacle and here at Full Gospel lighthouse and I pretty tonight that you would discern the very thoughts and the intents of the heart I pray the angel the Lord would stand ever so near to minister and to call out needs and minister life and peace and health and may we see the direction of the Holy Ghost and may we just step into that channel of faith and reach out and touch you as you're passing by Lord I pray that you'd move us as a people sometimes we get so bound our traditions it gets so bound in who we are and found that this is the way things are but I pray that you would move us by your spirit I pray that you would move us by the power of the word that you would make us and realize that there's more force and there is against us I pray that the angel of God that is ever near right now would stand and preach and declare the word of truth to your children Lord we ask all of these things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen god bless you you may be seated in the presence of the Lord also if you have your Bibles we turn over to second Peter chapter 1 and verse 19 we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto you do well you do well that you take heed as unto a light that sounded in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that that no prophecy let's say that together that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved they were moved they were moved by the Holy Ghost now this message that we have received in this hour we realized that those things that we have received have came from the very mind of Christ and we realized that it was more than a kentucky hillbilly that was speaking to us but we were watching a move of the Holy Ghost that was that was working with working through a man that had a seventh grade education and there's no man in his own mind or as their own intellect that he could be able to bring forth those things except the Holy Ghost so put those things there and we realize that the things that we have received is none other than thus saith the Lord we look out upon this hour and we see that we look in laodicea and we see that there is an intellectual pregnant that has taken place in people's minds but but we look out and we look back upon the Bible and we read the Bible Peter James and John and could you imagine them sitting down at a psychiatrist and trying to trying to sit down and let them bring in their reasoning powers and bring in their intellectual conceptions and bring in those things I believe that believers today are the same just as believers were then that we are birthed under the word of the hour those men were not under an intellectual conception but they were moved by the Holy Ghost just like when they were moved to go to the temple to praise they went by the gate of beautiful and they called a man that had been crippled for all of those years and he had not they said we have not what you ask of us but such as we have we give you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and rise up and walk now we realize that though man can do that but deity in man would move man to be able to speak those things and say those things and we look out upon this age of Laodicea and we see the things that are transpiring and we would ask him for the RAM would ask the question in God of this evil age has God lost control or is he allowing another agency or is he permitting another agency to control he said the answer to this is that there is two spirits in a framework that is opposing one another and one of them is the devil in his deception and the other is the great holy spirit of God and they are opposing one another and I know which side I'm standing on and I know it's realm I want to be moved by and I know which realm I am influenced by but we watch as men today are influenced by that realm and influenced by the realm of darkness but we are not like those of darkness we have had a man that have stood here and has turned on the light in this hour when darkness was surrounding us the children of God had light down in Goshen and we're standing in an hour where God has not lost control of his people God has complete control and supreme authority and has the preeminence in his people and God has got control of the believers in this hour just like he had control over Daniel just like he had control over David just like he had control over the believers throughout the Bible and we are watching none other than Jesus Christ in body form again percent the same life the same word the same actions the same power the same scientist same wonders we are watching a people that is moved by none other than Jesus Christ to me it's an absolute paradox that where we live in an age that's so dark but yet it's a people that choose to defy the armies of the enemy but they begin to lift up the praises of the Almighty God and they will not allow the enemy to come in and steal and kill and destroy their life it's a paradox to watch of people as their fellowshiping with the Lord Jesus Christ by the hearing of the word and when you watch the people that are overcoming the darkness of Laodicea right here in Satan's Eden in the midst of chaos and in the midst of perversion and utter chaos and people that's living true to God a people that is that is dressed by the lord of the hour by the spoken word that's been released in this hour to see these things as an absolute paradox when men can't live true to their lives and men and men want to live with men and women want to live with women when you see a paradox of a man and a woman live true to themselves live true to one another but then to watch the paradox between the bride and the bridegroom what we are seeing is when God says I and my children there will not be one scar on you when you get on that other side but you will be standing there victorious as a people that made it over [Applause] hallelujah well you look out upon the land and you see every demon out of a pit of hell and we're talking about a cave we're talking about a cave but when you see every demon of hell coming out of that pit of hell and it's attacking the ministry it's attacking the the ladies of the of Christ it's attacking the laity and it's attacking the move of God when you watch when you see the Spirit of God begin to move and then there's people today that want to shut down that move it shows that there there is a moving in another realm of Darkness who wants to shut down the move of God but when I see it on a portal and when men and women are being attacked in what they truly believe in is none other than that safe the Lord it proves to me and further vindicates that this message is none other than Jesus Christ is same yesterday today and forever but there's the people on earth today that's living it out they're living out what this message said it's not just books and tapes it's not just pictures on the wall but they're living out what the Bible said they're living out what the message said they are what we are seeing is the manifestation of Revelations tn8 revelations 19 6 and revelations when we're watching and seeing those things as the people eat that book become that book and speak that book what is it it's a living out just like he was in Daniels day Daniel was living in an hour when he purposed in himself that he would not defile himself with the Kings meat and the King Street and the Bible tells us that Daniel was excellent in spirit now that was a ward in which none other knows there was nobody else down in Babylon that this was said of that they were excellent in spirit except for the believer Daniel now the Bible tells us that Daniel was a dissolver of bats and you find that when the Queen when the Queen of Belshazzar which you realized when there was a dream of the king that could not be interpreted by the Wiseman and the madhouse of that day she said there is a man in the land that is a resolver of the doubts what was she saying is that he had the answer to every problem or every question and we again have the Holy Spirit in this hour that is the desorber of doubts that has the answer to the devil's question that he dissolves all the questions that you could present before this great dog and what was Daniel doing he was silencing the chaos of the hour that's what this Lord is doing he is silencing the chaos of Laodicea by a people of the open book we look at history and we look back at Daniel and we look and see with the Prophet told us and then Gables instructions to Daniel and we see that Daniel was 68 years old at this time and look at the background of Daniel he was he was an alien yet he was a stood from his people al stood from his church without one church service without any Church to go to without any hymns to be saying but he's saying his self in the midst of all of this he still held on to what that prophet said he had no church to go to nobody to fellowship with everybody went to the heathen temples everybody worship their idols no Christian songs nobody nobody believed the same thing he did and in 68 years from a young man about 12 to 14 years old when he was taken down there he still held on to what the Prophet said now to think about the hour that Daniel was living in when there's nobody else around here now you're sitting here tonight when where there's more that are sitting here than what you even realize but you're living in an hour when you got peers around you you got believers around you but Daniel was in an hour when he had to stand alone when he was 68 years old he wasn't a young man at this time when you're reading of him but he had lived true all the way from a young person all the way up to an elderly man but he was holding on to that promise when it looked like there was no hope but Daniel still held on now notice what the Prophet said here in the great sounding like he said and these people certainly got acquainted with the gospel in the years of Israel's captivity of 70 years in the land of the Chaldeans and surely Daniel being made the chief of the Magi the prophet by his great wisdom to know the end of flings and to know what God was going to do and he was called the chief of the magic and the Magi no notice and the magic eyes had their old manuscripts that they referred to of their ancient fathers and Daniel noticed what Daniel brings in he didn't bring in websites he didn't bring in blogs he didn't bring it what everybody else was saying but Daniel brings in the writings of the Lord and so we understand that during this time that they had counseled much together now you talking about a meeting they had kept so much together and they had seen the wisdom and the power that the one true God produced that was far beyond any astronomer or imagina it was proved at the night of King Belshazzar stance so that that none of the Chaldeans where the astronomers could read the handwriting on the wall but Daniel through the spirit and the power of the Living God could do it and his writings were kept sacred and are till this thing so we look and we see when we've got we've got in a time when Daniel was standing alone but yet he is the man in which God is producing his mind he is producing his power and Daniel was staying true now notice what brother Branham said he said sixty-eight years he'd been down there and Babylon amongst the heathens and he still had the victory he'd been down there all those years and he still had the victory and brother Branham but said that that but we can't stay an hour to think about a man that was standing all by himself nobody else around and they said that the three Hebrew children were in another part of the kingdom Daniel didn't know where they were but he was standing all by himself and he held on to the victory what about the children of God that's filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost how much smoke should they hold on to the victory when nobody else is around you want to steal Bo to hold on to the victory when the Pats train able to lay his hands on to you you steal ought to be able to hold on to the victory when you ain't seen a dream and he ain't hit a vision but you still hold it on when you ain't heard the voice in a long time when the agency names win a long time but you still hold it on it shows that the serpent on the inside that's it's moving you into the realm but the supernatural but Daniels standing alone with God held the victory for 68 years they cover 68 years he had kept the victory and was undefiled before God without the baptism of the Holy Ghost without the blood of Jesus Christ to make intercession for him with only the blood of bulls and goats and efforts which he had to offer secretly because of the human traditions of that land they had been taken down there and Jeremiah prophesied to them that they were going down there you remember when that false prophet I believe it's not a meal is how it's pronounced that he had proclaimed that that this was not true but yet God showed that Jeremiah's prophecy was absolutely correct is that right there's been a lot of people that's rose up in this how that God still proved who was right they've been taken down there and Jeremiah prophesied a film that they were going down there but notice now Daniel oh my he begin to see that the time was getting close just as we are today and Daniel begin to understand the Bible said that Daniel began to understand by the reading of the books he began to understand by the reading of the books of Jeremiah that the time was at hand that captivity was almost over so here a prophet was taken another prophets word and pointing it at the hour that he's living in and saying were almost out of here captivity is almost over here he is in his 16 yet 68 year old body but in knurl Isis I got two more years and I'm out of here I don't care if it's ten more years two more years ten more minutes or ten more seconds I'm out of here activity it's almost over you see he understood that God was coming to place a claim on his position and his possession of the children of God and here Daniel was looking back to what the Bible said now he not didn't have a Bible to look back to and Abraham had didn't have a Bible to look back to but Daniel was standing at an hour like you and I are standing in when there's nobody else around him when he was standing by himself standing in a moment where I gotta believe yes but he's standing in an hour and he's reading out of a book what it says about him what about you and I how much more can we understand by the book after the seven seals have been released lots of the back of the book and the land Spain and place redemption claims on his inheritance also and that you are his your names in that book the lamb stood up for you in this hour hallelujah did stand up for the church wall he stood up for his bride hallelujah we understand by this book we understand that the things of the Lord are pertaining to us in this hour that we're going to make it look at your neighbors say we're gonna make it we're going to overcome the rapture is at hand when you got people that are looking out upon the nation today and don't know whether there's a wraps or not people don't know if there's our catching away or not they don't know what is right they don't know what is wrong but there is a people that understand by the book that you're the people of the seventh seal that will be released on rapture morning that you will be changed in a moment that at week four we can stay we understand by the readings profitable but nobody else wants to live right that's the government people don't wants to live life when there's nobody that won't slow overcome your overcoming when everybody just wants the past boom you're more than just passing through you're making your mark on history that's a people that's moved by the spirit it's an amazing thing to understand what your position is in the book it's an absolute amazing thing when you go to reading about understanding and only that understanding can come from the throne of God it's an amazing thing when you go to teaching somebody about water baptism and absurd seed and they're sitting there like where in the world did you come from but you begin to speak to somebody else and you begin to tell them the same exact things that you told them and she told the first person before and it's all of a sudden boom the light is shone upon them and they begin to understand not by your knowledge but by the books there's a lot of people they don't understand what I'm talking about tonight but there's a people of God that have gathered around the revealed word of the hour that understand that they will be the last runners of this age there is make in another people in this hour that will be the final boys [Applause] she will not be hindered she will not be packed out but she will overcome she will run her race and she will say what the tape says you remember when the Lord asked Joe and Joe chapter 34 he said where was she remember he said where was she when I laid the foundation of the Lord declare if thou hast understand me so job was standing at a spot that he didn't understand so here the Lord is asking him declare it if you know and John couldn't answer him John couldn't answer in that spot but when the Lord begin to reveal the things then Joe could answer there was a lot of you that set out in the denominational world that you couldn't answer these things but when you come under the lord of the hour you begin to understand by the book and you begin to be able to answer what the book said are you with me he didn't have the understanding he was lacking the understanding you remember what the prophets said about Moses that that burning bush had what Moses left I say to you Church of the Living God that this message has what you lack if you lacked understanding it's here if you lack revelation it's here if you're like healing it's here if you lack miracles it's here if you like understanding and a born-again experience it's here that same God is an advocate to reveal himself in a supernatural miraculous way that you think say that it was Andrew Spencer Ron Spencer had him a monster but it was the Holy Ghost that begin to reveal and do the works he's the same God where once you talk yeah when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy what was he doing God was relating to job what his mind was he was telling jokes he was relaying to to that job I know you've been through some stuff I know you've been through some trials I know you've been through some troubles but job I didn't send you down in the AIDS that you're living here just to live down there defeated job I know you've been through some stuff but I want you to know I didn't send you down there so that you can scratch your boils and sat on your ass heap but I saw you shouting out to victory I didn't see you down there to feed it I didn't see you living in a depressed mind and having a life with anxiety and tormal and all kinds of depression and misery and all those saints I didn't send you down there I sent you down there to live out the victory notice what happened Joe was restored double-fold what has happened to the body of Jesus Christ you have a double portion of his spirits to speak things that the angel of the Lord said this ain't just for William Marion Branham this is for the plot its entire better people of God that's been called by God get moved by spirit not moved by the devil but moved by the Holy Ghost and move into a realm of the revelation of God that note that one hand could steal from you Christ came to destroy the works of the devil is that right I love it when the Bible tells us that we are not servants but we're sons and I believe it's too many times we sit around it and people get a servant attitude or a servant mentality instead of a son mentality you follow me you just never so many times we always want to stay out in the field when it's our time to be and in the banquet room so many times we want to stay out and do the work when it's our time to put the dress whole ritual be just too many times we get the mentality that we can't have it but when you are a son you can have everything that the father hatch [Applause] when you come to that spot of attraction it's not waiting no longer you're standing there in the same authority that the father has he can send you out into the field to do his work in his name because you are an adopted son of God you didn't belong to the devil you belong to God Daniel didn't belong to the Lions Danny belong to God David didn't belong to the glass he belonged to God Paul did not belong to the shipwreck he belong to God Ron Spitzer didn't [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Honolulu is because an understanding I know hallelujah now the Bible says in first John 5:19 that we know hallelujah that we are of God and the whole world laughs that wickedness but notice verse 20 and we know hallelujah there's power and knowledge there's power revelation and we know that the Son of God has come first and have given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in His Son Jesus Christ this is the true God and eternal God and you allow the enemy to come in and tell you that you're gonna die how can you kill God when you are a part of Elohim he can no more kill you they kill Jesus he's here he's moving he's acting and we're seeing him but he is watching you in this hour to see how you react Sarah it's a reaction to an action and the angel the Lord is watching you tonight to see how you move towards this movement to see how you move towards this word to see how you move in faith and when you start moving in faith then all of a sudden the discerning of the Lord takes place and he starts reading your book he's watching you to see how you react to his action is that right if you would began to watch as a pillar Fawad slipping through this room and you would start to reject it he's watching how you act to that but if you would watch as that pillar if I was slipping in this room and hover over your life and in what you adore him and make love to him he's going to move on your behalf this is a movie of God and I don't want to miss it the things we are seeing for gospel lighthouse are things that only he can do there's no man that can make these things happen when we start hearing about miracles not just every month not just every week but we start hearing about them every day actually we're in a very special spot as the bride of Jesus Christ for the headship is connected to the body and we get ready for departure but we watch this move of God and there's all types of movements in the world today there's all types of movements that are that are worldly movements and I don't even know what half of the movements are out there I got to read about some of the movements out there and I thought my goodness that ain't a movement that's a devil you go to reading about the me2 movement and go to reading about the blacklivesmatter movement you get to digging into their beliefs and all of those movements and getting their reading in the defund the police movement and tearing down statues movement and tearing down history movement tearing out all kinds of things what are they trying to do it's a type of the spiritual and the natural and it's a type that Satan is trying to tear down your belief system and trying to stop the move of God what do they do it something is driving them to tear down these things something is moving them to go into that realm and do those types of things but whatever you do you can get connected socially involved all types of different things but don't you dare miss the moving of the Holy Spirit you can read on the news what The News says but do not miss the revelation of the hour that God is moving his people closer to him a notice is just few excerpts he says brother Brent said when God moves in the spirit his children move with it when you watch the pillar of fire throughout the Old Testament as it would move you would watch as the pillar fire moved then the camp moved and when people stopped moving with the pillar fire that's when they died that is where the Pentecostal organization died is when they stopped and organized and the Holy Ghost went on and they stood there in their denial and in the dead traditions but if God moves there's a purpose behind it God didn't just come down to this Saturday night service just for just an ordinary service he's got a purpose in mind and that's to draw you closer to him every time you watch as the Lord comes as he came down him he came with a purpose when he came to Enoch he came with a purpose he came to Enoch and he won't goofing off and God took him that was his purpose he came to Abraham and he changed his body he came to Moses and he brought deliverance he came to Daniel and he took him out the lines then he comes only with a purpose and if he shows up here tonight he's come here with a purpose he's got you in mind and you're his purpose and he did not come here just to make a show of himself he came here to move on your behalf and bring you closer to him now notice and when God moves in the supernatural your heart will hunger right to it that's a move of God now notice in expectation he says everywhere God moves at any time through the Bible you'll see healings miracles signs and wonders now many people don't want the moving of God no more and that's why they don't have healing that's why they don't have miracles and that's why they don't have signs and wonders why because they stopped the moving of God but everywhere God moves everywhere God moves it's not the preacher it's not the deacon and it's not it's not you but everywhere God moves it's not something that you say in your own power that I'm going to do this but everywhere God moves any type of the Bible you see healings you see miracles you see signs and wonders and he loves it he leaves a tract behind him of the supernatural he leaves a trail that you can follow how many of you Hillbillies down here you understand track of the blood you track of that blood like that bloodline and you follow that deer when it's been shot but here the Holy Ghost is leaving a trail for you to follow now maybe you don't know where he's at and maybe you ain't seen him but if you'll just watch the miracles and massage her wonders that are happening in the body of Jesus Christ it'll lead you right to the headship that's making these Saints possible we see when he begins to move the world shakes when he begins to move things change when he begins to move to watch his kingdoms begin to fall and crush you watch as the angel of the Lord would move on from tent to camp and as they would go you would watch the moving of the Lord as he would go out and he would prosper his children in battle and in war and when they were set down to feast he would bless them why because they moved with the spirit and when we see the moving of God it's a time to step in the waters and get right in I have to tell you I've been a part of a lot of special things in life I've been a part of various supernatural things seeing a pillar of fire seen the angel of the Lord but to me seeing the move of God in this generation is something that I have never seen in all of my life to watch it move on young people and young people call right right Road Road to see hearts being transformed and healings manifested relationships being restored and product was coming back home and the miraculous present every day it's a move of the Holy Ghost and we're very familiar as followers of the message of this Pope in the visible union of the Bride of Christ he says some of you people that really believe this to be the truth that we're entering into another age we're entering in the rapture age you know the church can't go in its condition and it can't get any better it must get worse how many knows that in the congregation it says hey man it's got to get worse it can't go like this it's got to be something and it's moving right now friend it's on the move is on for the bride that's thus that's the truth that's thus saith the Lord the move is on for the bride that's thus saith the Lord the brother Branham is not putting the bride over in another age or outside of the church ages no can I get a hearty amen he's not putting us outside of the church changes and he's not saying that this is a rapture aids that is set aside completely separate from the church ages but this is the age like you could say it's the television age it's the automobile age it's the rocket age but here brother Branham is telling us that this is the age of the rapture and there is a people in layers here that is rising above every form of ungodliness and unbelief the move is on that's thus saith the Lord you know where you were you know that you were dead in your trespasses and sin and all of a sudden he came by your way you didn't go to him he came by your way it was a moving of the angel of the Lord that came by your way and snatched you up because Eagles don't stay on the ground Eagles go into the heavens so so we see where this move is taking us it's not taking us outside of lay on us here it's taking us over coming way out of see that were more than enough to overcome Laodicea and it's taking us right into the mind of the Lord it's a move all right it's a move yeah when you look at the Wright brothers you see them how that they were the first in flight as many people have looked up in the sky they looked up in the sky they seen birds flying there but they didn't they weren't moved like these brothers removed you see because they'd seen something that was up in the heavens and they tell us they tell us that essa from a very little child that they were praying they were playing with a little bitty toy and that's that toy was spinning that thing broke and it began to fly off into the air and they begin that that dream began to build on the inside of him and as they were out there and they were watching the eagle and they would look up here at that echo and they would say you know what I believe that I can do that too I believe that I can get up there too so so this dream that they had was called was called crazy this dream that they had was called it was called stupid it was called idiotic it was called chaotic this dream that they had put them in a hospital this dream that they had would tear them apart would physically hurt them but they were driven by and moved to get into the heavens and they were looking they were watch that equal as that eagle would would go up in the sky they would watch it as it would begin to go out there and if we begin to soar but this wings out it could move higher than any other bird they would watch it as it would take its little eaglets it would take it off the cliff of the mountain and they would take that eaglet and a little baby eagle and they would drop that eco and they would drop and that eagle ain't got a clue how to fly and so that little inkling and it's the way an Apes are teaching her children how to fly she knows that if they stay there in the nest they'll die there but if she can ever teach them how to fly if she could ever teach them how to move and shake another teach them how to flap their wings and that little eagle goes out there over top of the canyons and that little Eagle begins to flop and flop and it begins to fall and fall and fall and it begins to flap he begins to flap and all of a sudden its wings are set and it's moving it's all around that mamma said that they could go in there is around that the body of Jesus Christ is breaking into because they move but the Holy Spirit that momma eagle told us that we could fly in hallelujah the domination said we couldn't file there Luther said we couldn't flower there Wesley said we couldn't fly there pinnacle said we couldn't fly there but I have heard a voice that said come up hither don't stay down there not get the nomination and in your dead creature no more rah rah rah up get out of that position you can sand your fingers and you can stand your [Applause] [Music] hey Thomas holy rose and make fun of us they tell us that we're never gonna become anything but one of these morning's we're going to become God it's a move it's a move of the Holy Ghost that wants to take you higher in your faith level mine angel is here he's with this message to take you all the way into the rapture and he ain't leaving this message so it means he can't leave you but he wants to challenging he wants to challenge you to let your faith loose now when he comes he comes with a purpose and it's coming too challenging to challenge you to believe and let your faith loose like never before now if you want to find out if he's still God you act upon it and lay yourself upon his altar and see what takes place you have to act on his word first Daniel before he saw the miracle of God could deliver him from the lion's den the first thing he did was act upon the Word of God the proclamation went forth if any man prays to any other God besides his Idol for so many days have you thrown into the Lions Den and no man could pray to any other God but to the king he had to be God for 30 days but what did Daniel do he acted upon the Word of God because when Solomon dedicated the temple he prayed he said Lord if not people be in trouble anywhere here and we'll look to this holy temple then you hear from heaven that's why Daniel acted first the threat was you're going into the Lions Den but Daniel acted on the Word of God and he knowed that God was still God just like Gideon did he knew that God if he was still God then where is his miracles and Daniel knew he was a prophet he knew he of God he knew he was a servant he knew that God was able to deliver him from the lines but if he was in trouble and under a threat he could turn his face towards the temple and pray three times a day just exactly he acted upon the Word of God and God filled him with him and God filled him so full of the Holy Ghost till the lines could meet him you are a people that is so filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost that the line the line of hell cannot eat you cannot harm you because she was so filled with the power and the anointing like the mighty angel who are you talking about a power you're so filled with it that the devil don't know what to do with because 10 you acted on what God said you see he had a faith to reach into that realm brother Branham said that Daniel had to feel the hot breath off the line he had to feel he had to feel he had to feel that roar of the lion before the angel came but when he got in that moment by the random said that the angel of light swirled around Daniel and the Lions couldn't get to him I don't believe you forgive me you forgive me I don't believe that this was just for brother on but I believe that this is for the children of God that was like daniel said through the king o king i will see you in the morning the lines won't kill me death won't get to me but i see you in the morning and when i come out in the morning I'm gonna declare and the three that there is no God like to hope you watch me chat no white speak dance you'll watch me declare who got me out of that cave that was Jesus some of u s-- wanted to stay in that cave some of you like living with lines some of you like living with cheaters some of you like living with stealers some of you like living with liars and all kinds of all kinds of wickedness but I'm telling you you don't have to stay in that lines no more it's time to come out stop staying in that stupid condition and rise up battle lads out of your sin rise out of that cave you may not know how to get back out of it but there's an angel there that I'll be able to protect you sorry surely if he's there to protect you he'll get you out of the cage okay I'll see you in the morning well I don't know if I can I don't know if I can go anymore I don't know if I can dig dig these ditches no more Daniel knew how to pray Daniel Newhouse Daniel knew had a call on God he knew how to invoke the God of omnipotence and he realized that the God that was for him was able to bring him through all the way through captivity and he was realizing that this was a spot that I'm about to go free and the Bible tells us that the the Prince of Persia withstood Daniel in his prayer for three weeks for 21 days he withstood Daniel in his prayer and Daniel just kept on praying and when when the man that stood before him said now the Prince of Persia which stood me but Michael Cain Michael which is an angelic type of Christ he came and he showed up and when he showed up that devil of hail could not stop Daniel's prayer what was it then the man said to Daniel he said I am come for five words the words that Daniel had released from his mouth was the words that that angel had came forward there is a people that is speaking thus saith the Lord and he said I have come for thy words [Applause] but what if Daniel would've gave up all day 19 what if Daniel would he gave up all day to Morty come on somebody let me bridge to you you living in Laodicea but you're not a part of Laodicea what if you were to give up a day before the rat sir you're that close but Daniel was not as those that turned around and turned back but Daniel dress the bath and Daniel prayed over he prayed on through 21 days when it felt like the clouds were hour and and nobody else was hearing him Daniel kept on praying how about you mamas how about you daddies how about you young people that said I'm not giving in and I'm not giving up it may feel like my hatred coming but I'm gonna pray to the answer cuz I'm gonna pray till my son comes back I'm gonna play to my dog's back come on kids what if you what smooches hey hallo [Music] [Applause] oh well I'm not turn around and I'm not giving up my feet are set planet on higher realms listen is a moving of the Spirit of God because Daniels faithfulness and because Daniel stood true God stood up God stood up you see Daniel made a choice that I'm going to choose to serve him and I'm going to choose to pray to him and I'm gonna choose to live for him no matter what the circumstance or the opposition maybe I am going to choose to live for this God and because Daniel stood up Christ I was woke on the day of a brain surgery with a with a being in my room and woke me up at 242 and told me to stand up you remember he said let's stand it's a time to stand up and if there ever was a time as the children of God that we need to stand it stand like never before this is the hour to stand against the movements of the world to stand against overnight pain to stand against the works of the devil and to stand for Jesus [Applause] he stood for me I stand for him [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah he's come to do the miraculous and he's coming for your words how powerful its natural gospel lighthouse an endtime Tabernacle how powerful that is that I'm coming for your words all of those words that you release on Ron Spencer's behalf that angels coming for those words when you said I have believing that my sons and my daughters are coming back and they're gonna get a full baptism of the Holy Ghost receive this message that angel said I have come for that words Satan can withstand all he wants to but I hear chains falling do you want to satisfy us all you want to but we still gonna make it he tried to stop us but we still gonna make it he tried to kill us but we still live are you with me they tried to put Jesus in his cave they tried to put him in there seal him up with a Roman seal but you can't keep Jesus shut up they tried to put him all in there but when the angel came and rolled away the stone Jesus got up I'd say that it's a time that you start rolling away that unbelief and the angels the ministering spirits of God start rolling away the stone of unbelief out of your life and let Jesus get up in your life oh I'll go get huh I'm gonna get up knock me down all your water bottle get up you can knock me down the mob and I'm gonna get up I'm gonna make it I'm a wind come he'll come why high water I'm gonna make it I'm gonna make it you can try to stop this root answer try to stop us try to stop this rain please try to stop us with unbelief try to stop us with all kinds of tactics but we will not back up we're gonna get up goodish centigrade and we're gonna get up witness in the hospital ever go get up [Music] [Applause] Paulo and one of these morning's between the hours of 6:00 and 9:00 there's gonna be a people and say okay I'm gonna see you in the morning only good with Shane in the name of Jesus Christ receive your deliverance receive your healing let the resistance come he's coming he's coming he's coming to your cue he's coming admitted he's come for thy words and there's not going to be one bit of unbelief that stops it it may stop you but it will not stop him well you're gonna stand down well you're gonna stand on on that day I'm gonna stand with Jesus I've already got my seat prepared I've already been seen sitting in the overcomers public I've already been seen on the other side but he didn't see me down here in Laodicea when cast down the cancer came and if cancer Kate stopped me from shouting the devil himself can't stop me from shouting why a stupid devil to spot me Bryson the Living God David said oh the pit can't praise you the grave can't praise you Oh hallelujah David said in Psalm thirty that joy comes in the morning hallelujah you paint breaks them down in that pit and you can't place him in your sin why don't you get up here why don't you get up here way because I born to live that stop praising him David said I will extol thee O Lord I will praise thee I will bless thee at all times i'ma praise you through cave i'ma praise you as I walk into a valley and all I gots five little stones but I know that who's on the backside of these stones is more than enough to take down that job are you with me that child of cancer can come and try to scare the liver out of you but there is a word of faith that is here and it's sitting in a sling and all you got to do is operate that swing of faith and let that stone a revelation hid the devil right me I and the devil loose operation in the talent I praise you in the cave I praise you through cancer I praise you through coming 19 I praise you through tall walls I praise her through all things hallelu how can I not praise him when I know that all things work together for the good to them that love and who shall lay anything to the charge to live why would I not praise the one that's going to get me out of my mess [Applause] what would I choose to keep my silence and not praise the woman that shut the mouth of Rods why would I choose to stay in a condition of death and hell and the grave when the one I know said that I am come to deliver you why would I not raise him why would I not praise when he saved me from a bit of sea this is a movie of the angel of the Lord what will witnessing what we're witnessing in young people building relationships becoming godlike instead of laodicean like is a move of God and maybe maybe you're in that condition and you look out upon somebody else that says oh I wish I could have that I wish I could have been let me tell you let me give you a little glimpse into my own life all I've always admired planes I always admired the Wright brothers and those Wright brothers looked out upon that eagle and said I can do that too I looked at Peter and there's a lot of people that can identify with Simon Peter there's a lot of rough
