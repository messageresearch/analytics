Jesus we come before your throne of Mercy tonight recognizing that there is still blood on thy mercy seat Lord It's the only reason we have success it is the only reason that we are standing where we are is because the blood has been applied and Lord to see us all the way through a work week one more time to be able to come into the house of the Lord we thank you Father that you have allowed us to consider you all things everything else lost but to you you are our game father Lord Jesus we want you to be honored in our worship here tonight we want you to be magnified with our lips and our praise Lord Jesus there's not enough language there's not enough air capacity in our lungs to be able to express how great your majesty is and father to see what you've done for us to see where you brought us from that you allowed us to still stand here in the midst of the darkness of laodicea to we to us we are a very grateful people here tonight and Lord one more time we we're very well-studied people Lord we we understand the power of the message we we've gathered here year in and time in and week in after weekend but Lord there's a faithful little church here in Elkton Virginia that says God we need more of you and we would ask Lord that you would just come and you begin to move in this congregation here tonight Lord that you would bless them abundantly Lord for all of their energies and their times and all those that are on the way of the stream we pray your blessings be upon them as well father we are asking father for your Supernatural anointing to flow in this building father and take us into a sphere that only you could take us to Father we'll be careful to serve you and praise you give you all the glory and honor that is here thy name we love you and appreciate you tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen if you have your Bibles this evening would like to look over in First Corinthians chapter 2 verse 9 and then down to the book of Timothy second Timothy chapter 3 and verse 16. amen it's brother Matthew said we want to be remembered in our pastor there brother Donnie Reagan's and ministering there tonight and having a prayer line for for all those people there so we know that the Lord has got special things in store for his children here today and Lauren he's a he's a he's a wonderful Lord and he's a he's mighty to save and and it's amazing to know that the god that that is in this room is the god that is all over his children and manifesting himself and taking care of them and there's not a problem too big and there's not a problem too small for him and he's a wonderful Lord and if you don't know him as Lord I invite you to know him he's a good God amen aren't you thankful to know him as Lord and savior as a redeemer as a friend aren't you happy amen aren't you happy tonight amen if you know Jesus you ought to be happy amen amen let's just look to the Lord tonight First Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 9 but as it is written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither hath entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth wrong man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given unto us of God isn't it wonderful to know the things of God amen which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned second Timothy chapter 3 and verse 16. very familiar scripture readings here tonight and Paul says that all scripture is given by inspiration of God is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works may God bless his word he may be seated here in the presence of the Lord I'd like to read that last portion of First Corinthians chapter 2 and 13 that it says that which things also we speak not in The Words which man wisdoms teacheth but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned I would like to speak to you tonight on the thought that the Lord's placed on our heart on channeling the inspiration channeling the inspiration in other words you could say channeling the anointing or channeling the word of God brother Branham says here in the church age book he said I am the word he said he said he's reading the scripture he said if you want to if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word now he said don't ever let anyone or anything get between you and that word this which I am given unto you the word is a revelation of myself I am the word remember that I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst let me give you a thought here how do we pray we pray in Jesus name don't we every prayer is in his name or there isn't any answer yet in first John 5 and 14 we are told that this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hears us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him now we ask what is the will of God there is only one way to know his will and that is by the word of God for Lamentations 3 and 37 says who is he that saith and it cometh to pass when the Lord commandeth it not he said there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it can you say Amen to that if it isn't in the word then you can't have it so we ask so we can't ask in we can't ask unless it's in the word and we can't petition or ask E3 but that is exactly what he is John 14 and 6 I am the way the truth and the life Romans 8 and 9 If any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his there it is he is spirit and he is alive that is exactly what the word is it is exactly what Jesus is he is the word so when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips why it's that is the same as deity speaking Every Mountain has to go and Satan cannot stand before that man so if if you as a son and daughter of God if you are filled with the Holy Spirit and you watch that you watch that you didn't gather this knowledge you didn't gather this knowledge from a school book you didn't gather this knowledge from some idea but you gathered these things that you have have received you've gathered them by the knowledge of the Holy Ghost and it's a very powerful thing to say that you know Jesus Christ because there's a lot of people that talk about Jesus there's a lot of people that say that that they've heard about Jesus but to say that you know Jesus is a very powerful thing if we can introduce our young people and our our young girls and our little children here at five and six years old no matter how old they are if we can introduce them to a god that saves and let them know that they can know the god of the Bible it isn't it isn't something for just a minister or or for the laity as they grow and mature in the word but every single one of us can know in the past know him in the power of his resurrection but there is a power of knowledge that we as his children we begin to get under the channel of inspiration by by the preaching of the word or by the hearing of the word that we know that faith comes by hearing and how do we even recognize that Jesus Christ says law lord it's because that you heard about him if if you recognized him if you've accepted him if you if you felt him as a Healer if you've known him as a God that cares it's because you heard about him and the reason why you've experienced him in that level is because you heard about it and by faith in those things you begin to move into the operation of faith and you begin to channel those things and that's why that's why you see these young girls getting filled with the Holy Ghost is because they heard about a Holy Ghost and I believe if they've gone to if they're going to have the Holy Ghost and somebody's got to preach it so that they can hear about it so that they can receive it and I believe that if you need healing in your body then God's got to have somebody that'll stand there and preach the word of God that God is still a Healer so that somebody can tap into a channel and then they can re receive that inspiration as it as it whirls out of that world of that we don't see and they can receive it so I believe that if there's going to be powerful things happen in the Church of the Living God then we ought to be able to preach teach those things and I believe that if we can tap into one of those channels here tonight I believe that there will be Supernatural things here that'll happen for every person sitting here under the sound of our voice if we can just tap into a channel it's like what you're hearing me by tonight if you're hearing me by the by the help of amplification of these sound waves that are that are operating there they're going through a transmitter they're going through a transmitter that is here in this microphone and it's transmitted through a wire that sends it through there that sends it back to you in the perfect timing that you're hearing it all in the same time and it's a it's a powerful thing when you got some powerful microphones that can help you and you're you're sitting there and you're you're not just a you're not just a great order but you're standing there and you have to have the ability to take your voice above the the voice of the crowd so you've got you've got amplifiers you've got you've got microphones and you've got all of these transmitters that are taking their spot in the park of the operation of the preaching of the word you see these things could be used for one thing or they could be used for the preaching of the word and this microphone never knew what it was going to be used for but it was operating in a channel where somebody bought it it was sitting there and somebody took it and put it here now the pews that you're sitting in or the chairs that you're setting in they could have said in rock and roll concerts or or somewhere down the street but they're here tonight it's because somebody had a vision to place those things in this place or in this building so that you could have a nice place to set upon it's somebody that was getting under the vision to be able to grab an inspiration build a building have atmosphere have a have a sound wave and have all of these these technology things and these brothers up there they are they are key we've taught them over the years to how to build an atmosphere in this building and it's some of the worst things to fight against is an atmosphere in a building because you see there's things that are working against us in this building there's carpet that is working against us there's there's bodies there's 98 BTUs that are set off by every human being here tonight there's things that are against us but there's something that is operating that is controlling this the the atmosphere here there's there's an air condition that aren't you thankful for air condition that it's controlling the atmosphere of your what you feel you see you would be Max teaming mad if brother Alden had it at 85 degrees in here you'd be Fanning harder than anything you'd be getting ready to take wings and you'd be mad as I'll get out if I stood up here and I had my back to you and you couldn't hear what I was saying because there's somebody that's got to operate in a channel to be able to use what is being put out are you with me you see there's a major difference in just just saying some things and then there's a major difference and being able to build on top of that and there's a lot of people that don't understand the power of building an atmosphere and it's taken us years upon years to build an atmosphere and to to show these brothers and show these sisters how to build an atmosphere by the power of sound you see most of you don't understand those things because you've never operated in those things you see you don't understand what it's like to preach because you've never preached you've never understood but I don't I don't understand the way that you receive certain things because I'm not sitting in your shoes you see there's a major difference I hope you understand what I'm saying to you but there's a major difference in a singer and a worship leader because there's a lot of fine people that that know how to get into the channel of singing a fine song and know how to lift their voice at a certain level and they know how to hit all the keys at the right moment but there's a major difference in somebody that gets into the channel of a worship leader because I believe that we are past the days of just singing songs I believe we're past the days of just singing songs that that sound good they have nice lyrics but I don't want to sing songs that don't have no meaning to them I want to sing a song that that a puppet God knows how he comes down and gets in the midst of the children's Praises as they begin to lift up and they begin to get in the channel of worship they get under the inspiration of that song and it takes them from the world that they're living in into the world that God's calling them and it takes a very special built man to be able to work into that inspiration you see you might see us up here and we're operating through song books that we're operating through our iPads and looking over songs while the preaching of the word is going forth what are we doing we're trying to build a little Ministry after the preaching of the word and we get into a Channel of it we get into a Channel of it we don't want to just sing some song that just because it's got the right words or it's got the right tune we want to sing a song that matches the inspiration of the preaching of the Lord it's like brother Joel taught brother Joel foreign he told me one time he's one of the key elements in teaching me how to be a worship leader he told us he was telling me one time he said I was preaching he said I was preaching at this place and he said the spirit of the Lord was coming down in a very powerful way and you could see that the Lord was leading it to an altar calling I mean there you begin to see the spirit of the Lord begin to work on this brother or that sister and then all of a sudden the song leader got up there and said I wouldn't start at singing I wouldn't take nothing for my journey now and it broke the atmosphere of the calling of the altar call you see you've got to have somebody that moves into the channel of the inspiration because there's somebody that's upstairs that's riding up the Keynotes and you may not understand that if you've ever looked at sheet music you may not understand what it says but somebody that's trained to it that somebody that's looked at it before somebody that studied those things they look at it and they can understand what kind of keynote that it's bringing forth or what the lead note is you'll watch somebody if you take that sheet music it's got two dots and then it's got a cleft note and all of those things I could tell you maybe what one or two of them things but sister Cassie that's operating in that channel knows all of those things she can tell you exactly what they mean and I can tell you the same things that I'm preaching right now I could take this same word preach it down in a Baptist church and they wouldn't catch any inspiration that I'm preaching to them because they don't understand the channel that I'm operating in you see if you're going to receive anything from God you've got to get in the right channel of things you can't just get over here and say well Lottie doll I'm gonna be over here today but you got to get in the same inspiration that's the one that wrote the word the one that knows the word foreign there's a whole lot there's a whole lot of power laying right there if you can really just capture it because I know that a lot of you love songs you you wake up listening to it but if you can really get into the channel of a song that's why I've told our choirs that's why I've told our young people don't get behind this pulpit and sing a song Just because it means something or it has good words sing the song that's got power behind it and it means something to you because if the song don't mean nothing to you it won't come out the power that needs to come behind it that's like me getting up here trying to tell you about how the universe was created and how everything all comes together and all the cosmic light and everything I couldn't tell you how all those things can come together so I wouldn't be preaching to you something that I absolutely know but if I can preach to you John 3 16 if I can preach to you Acts 2 38 I know what I'm talking about now I can't take your job and you can't take mine you don't want me working on electricity because I will get into a channel and I will shock somebody or I blow them up I can guarantee you that if you have been electrician or something like that I'm going to get some wires crossed but you get me in the right channel that I'm built for I hope you hear what I'm saying to you tonight if you can get in to the channel that the Lord has built you for you can operate where God is destined you to operate in you don't see it operating in this room tonight but there is an atmosphere here that you can't see you know good and well that television is operating right here in this room but it takes a special design a channel to be able to grasp it it takes something with the right dial and the right lights and all of those care those little details that brings to pass the waves that are passing through this room right here you see I could tell these brothers to post a picture and they could simply go post it up on there go ahead and post that picture uh what I sent you this week about William Bradham being out there in Harrisonburg laughs which is brother brother Wayne Lawson shared that with us this week I spent hours I spent countless hours looking for news articles about William Brandon being in Harrisonburg but because somebody tapped into a channel they was able to find it in them in the in the in the in the magazine of Herald of Faith which Jack Moore put out there you see what you don't recognize I simply just spoke the word I said Brothers post that up there and there it was but you don't recognize that even right here right now that if you could say God I'm in need of my healing it can happen faster than that happened right there and maybe you don't understand what channel I'm trying to get you in but if I can get you in the channel of believing there is nothing that is impossible against the Church of the Living God you see you're built to be able to tap into a dimension that you can't see you see that television it works through a channel and it operates and it goes out there and it grabs and it manifests and the reason why I know that the spirit of the Living God is here is because I see that the Eagles are gathered here and if there's Eagles here that means that there's a carcass here and if there's a caucus here that means there's a word here and if there's a word here that means the impossibilities are in the same room it means that you are operating in a realm that all things are possible now notice what brother Branham says here said in that fourth dimension he said people can prove that right through this room now is coming radioactivity radio message coming right through this building now as coming televisions pictures but it's it's too fast for our eyes now you go a million miles beyond that Dimension and you'll get into a place that's just as real as television pictures is in this room this morning there's the Lord Jesus Christ the resurrected Son of God standing there and he said and the reason you can't see him is because our heart hasn't become tuned down to it and he said and the reason we can't see television pictures it's because our bodies are not set as instruments to pick up the mechanical scent things now you know good and well that that television right there is built to pick up that thing but if I told you to manifest it in your body you couldn't do it because you're not built for it he said but when our bodies become in tune with God and become a part of him then our soul can pick up the power of the Holy Spirit to vindicate that the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ is in all of his power and his omnipotence so if you can get your heart right you can pick up the supernatural right here if you can get your heart right there are things that your soul picks up it's like when no Philip found Nathanael a player when he found him up as he was coming down he said that he said look man he said we have found the one that Moses told us about we found him who the law and the prophets and all them told us about he said how can there be any good thing that comes out of nazarus and Philip just simply said these words come and see and when he was standing before Jesus he said on Nazarite and whom there is no God and he said which did you know me Lord he said why do you call me Lord just because of these things he said but because you believe you're going to see greater things than this he said you're going to see Angels ascending and descending upon the son of man what was it nathanael's Faith tapped into a sphere that they saw that there was going to come forth greater things brother random said he said if you've just accepted Christ by justification and accept sanctification and clean up your life he said you're still smoking Watch What Happens how much different you look back to sanctification you was just standing and just Justified and never received the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said but you step into that sphere then look back down at the rest of it he said you just keep walking till after a while you're going to get so light that you can walk up into the rapture you see what it is the Holy Ghost will take you to the realm that you're built for there's some children cannot feed upon the same level that you mature Christians are feeding on tonight but the Holy Ghost knows how to give inspiration to everyone sitting here tonight it's amazing to see where where the spirit of the Lord can take a man of God that he can take a man of God and he can operate and somebody will say man that was the most powerful paragraph or the most little simple word that brother Andrew said it was exactly what I was needing for the moment that when I was in and then there'll be somebody said man I know it wasn't for nobody else back there it was for me you see what it is it's the inspiration of the one that's writing the word that knows how to bring it to the people and the needs that they're in all right now because we recognize that the Bible says that all scripture is given by inspiration of God if you go to studying that out in the Greek it means that he divinely that all scripture is divinely breathed in if you go to studying it out you'll look that it's the same word that is used when he breathed the very Breath of Life in the in into Adam's nostrils there in the Garden of Eden that he breathed the very Breath of Life on the inside of him and William Branham said don't you know that the church is born by the very breath of almighty God you are born by the very inspiration of the Holy Ghost he said the true Pentecostal church is born of the Breath of God you remember when Jesus is standing there in John chapter 20 and he said my peace I give unto you he said as my father sent me even so I sin die you and as he had said those sayings he breathed on them and he said receive ye the Holy Ghost but you see they gathered the inspiration and they went up there after he said in Acts 1 and 8 that you're going to be a witness unto myself and they went up there and got the inspiration in an upper room what was it he breathed prophecy over their life breathe prophecy over their life and they gathered the inspiration and it's amazing what William Branham stood here and he preached over this congregation me and brother William was just talking about it before service and because I showed you that little that little clip it's been on my heart you think about these these meetings that happened right here in Harrisonburg Virginia you think about all of the people that turned a message down you think about the churches that all came together under under that Healing Ministry they came there they've seen those things they they seen the manifestation of the Holy ghostly seen great powerful things but none of them churches cooperated and they never stayed in line but there was a seed planted and because there was a seed planted somebody is sitting here today there's a church here in Elkton Virginia that believes that there's a message of Malachi 4 that has turned our hearts back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers and because there was an inspiration because God deposited a gene seed of God on the inside of the Church of the Living God the reason why you're here today is because God dropped inspiration Hallelujah out there when nobody else wanted to do anything with him nobody else wanted anything to do with this message after he got outside of 1963 they saw they said William Adams got off of his rock party went off on the deep end but they didn't recognize what he was breaking into he was breaking into our inspiration the rest of the world don't want nothing to do with this message but we want everything in the world to do with it see the world calls it crazy the world calls us neurotics but the people that have inspiration are those that are called Crazy by the rest of the world it's well I don't know if I can stand this or not Jesus had to stand criticism they called him a neurotic they called him crazy they called John the Baptist a wild man but we are under the greatest inspiration that's ever been deposited since Jesus Christ is here and we're living in a special hour where we're coming and taking the book we're not just the people we're not just another gathering of people we are the inspiration of the hour and God has got Sons and Daughters of God that have gathered under the inspiration of the word and they believe hallelujah hallelujah wasn't just for William Branham it wasn't just for those early Decades of people that were sitting there it's for you it's for you and because you tapped into a channel because you said that you believe because you believe that these things are for you he takes you into a realm Hallelujah the hour that we're living in is the hour of the taking of the book Hallelujah Hallelujah what did John say in that voice which I heard from heaven in Revelations 10 8 which I heard from heaven from Heaven speak unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the Earth Matt get yes somebody's calling but I ain't answering they got the wrong Channel probably spam but I went into the angel said unto him give me the little book and he said take it and eat it and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I John took the little book now what does John represent he represents the Bride of Jesus Christ and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and I ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings now if you go to studying out that word and I took the little book that took that word took in the Greek it is lambeno which means to receive it means to catch it means to take it is to take with the hand or to lay a hold off it also means to take an order to carry it away it means to claim or to procure for oneself it is the same word that is used in John 1 and 12 that as many as lambeno received him to them gave him power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name it is also used when Jesus is standing there in Luke chapter nine and it's getting ready to feed the multitude what was it it wasn't his bread it wasn't his fish it was somebody else's but the Bible said in verse 16 that he took the Five Loaves he received them he claimed them as his own Hallelujah he took the Five Loaves and the two fishes and looked up the heaven and he blessed them and gave to the disciples and to set it before the multitude and they did eat and they were all filled now what if Jesus didn't take them and what if Jesus didn't bless them they would have never fed the multitudes but because he took it because he took it and blessed it it fed over 5 000 people and it took up 12 basketballs at the end of it what if you don't take this message you'll never be a blessed people you'll never be a special glass of people you won't be a royal priesthood you won't be a chosen generation but because you took the book because you ate the book because you became the book Hallelujah I know everybody ain't here tonight I know we're smaller number but I feel you out there tonight because there's a people that have taken the book they've ate the book they've became the book it's why we look so much like Jesus [Applause] come on somebody it might be hard for you to believe but the things that are impossible are not impossible to you because you are sitting here as a fully adopted son and daughter of God under the manifestation of the power of the sons of God you're fully adopted setting their sons and daughters of God all creation was grading was waiting for your manifestation it was groaning for your manifestation trees were groaning forward nature was growing forward but you're here you're in a special hour who lifted you up here none other than our Lord Jesus Christ who let you see what you see why can't the rest of the world see it it's because they didn't receive a channel in the name of Malachi 4. but because you received the channel you gather the inspiration of the hour that you're in well Glory it feels good to preach to a people that believe and there's a message of restoration there's a people that's been caught up come up here a little bit higher you've gathered inspiration that you look past the things of the world you look past laodicea the things that upset the rest of the world it don't upset you you've got your eyes set on the on our Lord Jesus Christ let the world go do what they're going to do we've gathered inspiration [Applause] Hallelujah you go find when Jesus is walking with us to do Disciples there they don't even know who he is at the moment but they recognize there's something powerful about him you ever been in a moment and you recognize you're in the moment these two brothers recognize that there was something special going on here when he begins to take them all the way from Moses all the way up to Modern events being made clear by prophecy he's leading them right through the word and now they're seeing it and they don't really understand who they're looking at because they ain't recognized him yet but the Bible said that they constrained him to come they they earnestly pulled on him it was like he was going to go on but because they they poured on him they constrained him and their services like this or or times and it feels like man I'm getting ready to lose my blessing I'm getting ready to miss what's getting ready to happen but because you operated in the third third pool you begin to pull on him you begin to say father come into my house you see and it looked like he was going to go on but because you pulled on him he said I'm going to tarry with you a little bit longer and the Bible said that when it came to pass that he sat down with the dinner at the evening time Hallelujah that he took the bread he he claimed it as his own and he blessed it and they immediately their eyes were opened to recognize I wasn't there to see all the great Miracles that that happened in the early ministries of William Branham I didn't see the firstborn operation I didn't see him take him by the hands and see those those bumps that the Lord allowed to operate and show that the different diseases that was operating in a person's body I never got to see those things brother Shannon but I believe it happened I didn't get to see the second pool I in operation by by the Discerning and the knowing of the secrets of the hearts I wasn't there but I am under this third pole Ministry and I understand that this is the same one this is more than a man he says more than William Branham it's somebody that is operating under the same operation of this book if it wasn't then how in the world could we make all of the message line up with this Bible of 66 books but it's the same one that wrote the word it's the same one that is writing it out in your heart that's why the Bible said that your written Epistles read of all men you are sitting here tonight some of the greatest books that people will ever read a lot of these people today don't even know who Jesus is a lot of these people today ain't never picked up a Bible I watched a video one time of a guy just going up and asking people if they could recite John 3 16 and some of them didn't even a lot of them didn't even know it didn't even know the start of it what is it like brother Bynum said they left him at the altar as a little child and they never picked him up again but you see when when when this nation was invaded by the power of Satan that we recognize that that this Earth that we are living in is under the inspiration of Satan just like the inspiration of Ramesses was operating in the world of Egypt but there was a Moses out there there was a Moses out there that was operating in a different channel that ramuses didn't know nothing about you see there's a lot of people that's trying to copycat the same message or this same Ministry but they'd never been able to it because they can't gather the inspiration of it but the one that is setting here that is said that all scripture is given by the very Breath of God why are you sitting here tonight as a jean seed of almighty God is because God breathes on you the Holy Ghost you see the things that you've received they're spiritually discerned how in the world could these little girls or these the all of you sitting here tonight break down the seals unless you gather inspiration from somebody that was able to tap into that channel the rest of the world said we can't touch it they they just know it's symbols they they look at and they they peer into it they presume at it they they adventure with that Authority but there's a prophet that come here under the inspiration of a Ministry of Malachi 4 that he's able to go in there and release those things to you so why is it so powerful that we have a ministry under the authority of Malachi 4 come and operate it's because the book was closed foreign so you say why are you all constantly preaching the message if you want to have authority I've got to preach the message you see the reason why the rest of the world can't understand like your understanding is because they didn't receive it but there is a special glass of people that understand that the book ain't close to them it's not just six seals open it's all Seven Seals that third part of the seventh seal is your body changed and nobody knows that except almighty God but Hallelujah the portion of the seals that have been released to us as the Church of the Living God Only You as the body of Jesus Christ it's more than just history church it's prophecy being fulfilled can't you see that the same one that the boys on the road to amaze was walking with you've been walking with you swell I don't see him like they saw him I see him in you I see the same power that was operating in William Branham that was operating in our Lord Jesus Christ how do you see it a lot of times it's not like the world wants to see it in signs and wonders but the love of the father you know there's really nobody that can love like you love well don't get too stingy on me here tonight you can say Amen there's nobody that can show the power of the Cross like you can there's nobody that can show the world what Jesus is like but you so where did you get this knowledge from you see you see it's just like you if you're you're asking for healing you've got to tap into a Channel of it by faith and you see it's like job he was needing it was lacking it was lacking inspiration and job didn't really know that he could know God until God introduced him to the thought that he could be known because he begins to talk to him job in Job chapter 38 he said where was job when I laid out the foundations of the world where how do you know and when you notice when job goes over in Job chapter 42 he said I heard of thee by the hearing of thy ears but now I see it you see the reason why job was able to know God in the power that he knowed him was because God introduced him to the thought that he could be known and the reason why you believe on the realm that you believe in is because somebody told you that you can operate in the realm that you're operating in and if you want him to appear to you you've got to believe on him you've got to keep your mind on him you've got to keep your conversation about him just like little like the little Virgin Mary she had her mind upon the scripture that was laying there that a virgin shall conceive and all of a sudden out of that thought said Gabriel if you want angels to appear to you you've got to kind of live the life that that Zacharias was living he was up there serving God and praising God up there in the temple offering incense and sacrifice a prayer before the Lord and then the angel Gabriel appeared to him if you want the father to appear to you you've got to stay in the word you've got to talk about him I'll just be real honest with you I believe that's a reason why a lot of people don't receive their healing and they don't receive that they don't recognize that the Lord Jesus is right there it's because they never talk about him show me your friends and I will tell you who your God is show me what you got hanging on your walls show me what you listen to show me what kind of music you're listening to show me how many times you read the Bible and I'll tell you how big your God is your god is as big as you make him your God is as big as you make him and it's as little as you're making but if you can make him that he's a God that does impossibilities he's the god that'll carry you through he's a god how do you know him like that because I know I'm not just talking about you something I don't know about tonight because the Bible tells us in second Eric Colossians 3 and 17 that whatever you do in word indeed do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so what is that it is a channel that is simply opened up to the believer that whatever you do do it in the name of the Lord if you love love in the name of the Lord if you ask ask in the name of the Lord if you believe believe in the name of the Lord if you pray pray in the name of the Lord so whatsoever you do in word indeed Do It All In The Name Of The Lord there's a major difference between reading between reading Emmanuel and skydiving and then actually jumping out the plane there's a lot of people that know can that know how to read it but only a select few and have their guts to jump out of the plane so whatever you do in word or indeed do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so there's a major difference there's a major difference in guessing that God's still a Healer and guessing that God's still his Savior and guessing that God can still do Miracles and there's a major difference in knowing because guessing is the act of making a prediction but knowing is the act of the condition of the progress of knowledge and the reason why you know that he's a savior the reason why you know that he saves is because you experienced him as a savior the reason why you know that he's a God that heals you experience him as a God that heals the reason why you know he's a deliverer it's because you ain't got change on you no more [Music] laughs it's because somebody broke into a channel that was blocked up [Applause] foreign in the book of Kings I believe in second Kings chapter 3 that you go reading over there that there was three kings that had went out to battle they went out to battle and they had went the Bible said they went seven days they went over a hundred miles and didn't have no water they went up there they had Jerome Jehoshaphat and the king of Ammon and they were up there and they were needing water but there was one that was still sober the Lord by the name of that that still believed in God and he still believed that God did Miracles he said is there not a prophet in the land is there some Authority that we can go to and ask for this water that we've died that all of this enemy that has gathered around us but we ain't got strength to go into the battle so he takes they go up there to Elijah and Elijah sits there and they don't even come out to them Old Kings but notice what happens he said bring me a menstrual what did it do the man said that the prophet was stood up he was mad you ever get Miffy like that here get yourself in a bad mood somebody just say something off a cuff at you man you spend the rest of the day milking what somebody said to you boy I can't believe she said that to me and instead of letting it roll off your life you milk it all day long so you ain't gonna believe how it messed up my day man get Miffy like that get right there I know I'm the only one that bothers like that was Miffy all stood up he said bring me a menstrual you see he knew how to break the atmosphere of a bad mood it was by pure music and brother random said you know what he said I believe they got the playing one of them old Snappy songs ours gonna be a meeting in the air he said when the spirit broke the prophet was able to see a vision again you see what music is it is a channel it's well I don't really believe in all this music that you guys are having up there and I don't really understand why you're doing it I don't I don't understand why you sing so many songs brother Andrew it's because you don't understand the power of music David knew the power of music he said why do you get why do you get so under the inspiration to sing certain songs and it seems like it ain't going good and you can't get the key right now music's off but you keep pressing the battle it's because I know there's something laying there and if I could just break into that channel it seems like sometimes you get to sing in that song way maker and it seemed like it ain't going nowhere nobody's breaking into the atmosphere and then all of a sudden the atmosphere changes and somebody breaks into an atmosphere and all of a sudden the Holy Ghost comes down and blesses this brother and blesses his sister it's because there's power of getting in the channel you see mother Brown said if we can get them old cold formal shaky ideas off of us he said the prophet can see the vision again if we can shake them formal things off of us and those shackles that are upon us we can shake them things off of us then a vision will break forth the prophet knew the power of music music has the ability to drive Spirits away that's why it's important to put the right kind of music not just any music but the right kind of music on music that scares the devil right out of his bed in the mornings I'm talking about music that shakes all of hell and runs depression back into its corner where it came from it's a channel that you can operate in his brothers had been without water for seven days but the prophet said just go out there and start digging some ditches just start digging some ditches and the water will come you see what did the prophet know he knew that the same channels was laying there that Moses tapped into in Numbers Chapter 20 when he smote The Rock he knew that that same water was laying right there in the dirt but all you got to do is just start doing a little bit of digging I know there's still power in this message I know there's still miracles in this message I know they're still holy ghosts in this message I know this through inspiration in this message but if you can get to dig in a little bit he said if you get to a spot and they say oh brother the days of Miracles has passed he said you hit a log just keep digging and get that thing out of the way if you think that God's done past you dig that thing and get it out of the way he said if you can dig the ditches the water will come don't you recognize tonight that the same Authority that Moses was under of his prophetic Ministry was sitting there and preaching the water right out of that rock and that same inspiration was laying there when those kings were looking for that water I'm preaching you the message I'm preaching you the message but if you can get them old things out and start digging some ditches clean out unbelief clean out your closet clean out your fear clean out your complexes and just get into the channel of it and all of a sudden the same channels of the Holy Ghost can be in operation brother Brandon said but what's the problem is he said we he said Jesus cleaned out all of the ditches at Calvary he said but these denominations came and filled up the ditches again it's like a pastor gets to preaching man he's preaching he's preaching he's preaching man the word's doing his job and then all of a sudden somebody brings in an idea of denominationalism and it starts putting on the world again what is it the channels get clogged up all you got to do you got a clock you got to unclog the channels and we all remember what brother brother Donnie Reagan preached here last Labor Day he said we got too many Beaver Dam preachers damning up the whales again well this is one guy that ain't gonna Dam up the water that I believe that if you want the Holy Ghost there's a channel here for it I believe that if you want healing there's a channel here for it but you've got to have the ability to dig some ditches I'm closing but you know why God bless my papa Charlie y'all know it's about to get real when you say God bless him Martini said you could say anything you want to about somebody as long as you said bless their heart so here's somebody say bless her heart down here in the south it ain't a blessing but God God bless my Papa Charlie's heart you know he had we had this whole four-wheeler one time foreign had a system he had a system on how how he knew what gasoline was and how he knew what diesel was had same cans looked the same everything about him was the same except for they were some fodder twine that was wrapped around one of them and only he knew the key of it well one day his old four-wheeler that he had wouldn't work one day and he blamed every single one of us it was Andrew it was Matthew it was Gabriel it was Malachi it was Michael it was this way it was Mark well come to find out it was old Charlie he didn't even knew that he did it but what did he do he put diesel in there when he should have put gasoline in there and what did he do he clogged up the carburetor and he clogged up all things well brother Mark he just kept on fighting with that thing he got it running one day and it took him a good 30 minutes to blow out all the smoke out of the carburetor he like all the hills a pilate was on fire what did he do he clogged up the Channel with the wrong type of source but if you can get the right kind of power back in what's supposed to operate in there you'll see Miracles come to pass you'll see Dynamics come to pass if you can operate now if you can put the message on the inside of these temples you'll watch all the hell get burned up here tonight because somebody started putting the right kind of thing in the right kind of vessel it's because you're built for a certain type of message come on somebody you ain't a buzzard you ain't a chicken you're an eagle you're bound to go you're built to go higher you're built to fly higher nobody can operate in the channel that you're operating in it's because it's pure message for you it's a hundred octane message come on come on musicians you're built for another class you're built for another speed we say well I just get a little bit bogged down every once in a while what are you putting in there come on Charlie come on Charlie start pushing that that diesel down in there when it's supposed to be gasoline I love you Papa I love you a lot thank you for the example though I really appreciate it it worked good for me tonight foreign ain't that the way you do with your life it seems like man things are messed up because you put the wrong thing in there and you're trying to live a real holy life and you've been stuffing that old worldliness down in there you'd start wiping off all that stuff the world's got it start putting the dress on you can I'll tell you something else when you had the right kind of operating power on the inside of that four-wheeler you could do all kinds of things let me tell you something them boys them boys on that show Dukes of Hazzard didn't have nothing on us pilot boys we jump hay fields we jumped hay wagons we jumped anything and everything because we had the right kind of power in the operation that it was built for I'd beat my children if they did that today thank God there was no cell phones and no cameras around when I was growing up but there is cameras and there is cell phones but if you can put the right con a message on the right kind of heart you'll move at a speed that's so dynamic the devil can't keep up with you how many would say Lord keep me sanctified amen amen do you love the Lord tonight well I appreciate praise you praise the Lord forgive me papa do good amen let's just sing a song of worship here tonight
