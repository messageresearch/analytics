Services by now and I I trust it was a real blessing to you and brother brother Ron and brother Donnie didn't did a fantastic job and just seen the the power of the Lord move amongst the young people and and amongst the church there was just a just a mighty mighty thing and even the experiences that our youth have brought back and and I tell you it's those things are Eternal and we're just we are eternally grateful to our God for what he has done for our young people and we we fought tooth and nail just to get there it seemed like every little thing would just come up before our our little group trying to get to Louisiana and then then sister Stephanie went through a little bit of a battle there and uh but the Lord the Lord certainly prevailed for every one of us and uh we're just certainly thankful for all that he's done for us thankful for the privilege that we were able to go and take our young people and bring them back filled with the Holy Ghost and touched and see them

Louisiana Andrew did well too he wasn't gonna our prayer line went to after 12 o'clock the other night and many many deliverances God gave us strength to be able to preach and then stand in the prayer line and and then I was prayed for last and that's all I knew and so that's the first time that's ever happened to me and uh and mine just passed right out while you're being prayed for and so and just we had a wonderful time and so God did amazing things and hey you guys had great Services here too and so we thank the Lord for that the Bride is a many membered bride around the world when you hear Brother Branham talk about the vision of the Bride out of every nation shall come waving her flag it's just not America it's all over the world many years ago I met Brother David I was to preach a convention there Brother David picked me up and we had met on a couple of other occasions and maybe 2008 at the witness convention at brother bisco's then at Switzerland and I was invited to come to Belgium with Judo and Brother David picked me up and he showed me around the city a bit and we didn't know each other well he probably knew me but a lot better than I knew him [Music] we sat down at a table and as we're sitting across from one another the Lord whispered in my ear this is one of my generals and I've come to greatly appreciate this General he's a pastor in Belgium he's done a phenomenal job there his his dad brother Hank is a great man whom I deeply love along with his family and we're just honored to have Brother David here he'll preach in his second language English I think he speaks in about four or five different languages I speak in one and I don't do a really great job of that but if you come under expectation to hear from God will take his General from Belgium and he'll talk to you [Music] and if you pay close close attention there will be some sentences come your way and you will know that man don't know me but the voice behind The Voice knows me very well Brother David has a wonderful family a wife and four children he talked to them today and I got to talk to him by face face time and I noticed in his eyes he got that distant look so as he comes toward the end of the service we're we're praying the helicopter don't land here and take him home so he's got a couple more days here and so Brother David we love you with all of our hearts and the god that's in you we're very familiar with and we're honored deeply honored to have you here with us tonight give him a great big hands so it's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen I hope you were glad to come here and if not if not let's go home glad amen may the Lord change our hearts amen so I bring you greetings from our country Belgium for those who don't know I won't give you geography lessons but it's a little tiny country stuck between Holland Germany and France and a bit of Luxembourg and on the other side the west side we have the North Sea so where we had our meeting since 96 youth our youth camp winter camp so the Lord willing will have that in January and for those who don't know me I've been a co-pester for about 10 years in the church and I've been pastors since 2017 and the Lord has been faithful and he still is amen so it's my joy and pleasure to bring you greetings from our church in Nazareth Belgium so if if you think can anything good come from Nazareth let me give you a Bible answer come and see amen and God bless you so we're thankful my maybe you can bring up the picture tonight and I just wanted to show this picture that bald-headed guy in the back so the second from the right is my grandfather Armand van heese and he came here in 71 he uh preached in the Church of Ruther Folger if I'm not mistaking and on this trip I also met brother Fulcher so it's quite amazing and then here in the with the brown jacket that's uh brother Ron and brother Mark's father brother Charlie so they met together and also brother Fulcher is on the picture and then the brother here to the right is brother Wilfried he's still alive in Belgium he still loves this message with all of his heart I regularly go to visit him and he he remembers still the trip here to the U.S I spoke I showed him the same picture isn't that amazing this was 71 and here we are maybe 52 years later and the grandson of this Mighty Man is allowed to to make Tiny Steps in those big footsteps and it's it's just amazing how the Lord does things so we we are very very thankful maybe you have a close-up from my grandfather so that's my grandfather I was very close with him uh was often at the house and there was a mighty man of God he he founded our church and again I won't give you a lesson in the seven Church ages tonight but he uh broke away from the Lord called him as a young man in the Army and he went to Bible school he was a Baptist and went into the Full Gospel and brother Perry green brought the message to our country and there's some powerful things that happened he couldn't understand English so he got the reel to real tapes from Brother Branham and one day two ministers came and prayed with him and they just put the tape on and he could understand every word in English that's the God we serve amen and so he broke down in his office while listening to the prophet for the first time and he was crying and weeping rejoicing and said this is what I've been looking for all of my life and so we are a living testimony that the message is more than quotes and books but it's it's a real life it's the Life of Christ so we we come to testify tonight and and so there's many people praying for this service and we are thankful to be here it's hard to tell how but a few months ago the Lord just spoke to my heart that would I would be standing here so he knows everything and I know he the Lord doesn't make mistakes so uh we had wonderful meetings at Easter at brother Berry coffees and a wonderful man of God and he really treated us like a king and sister Becky and also so we are so thankful to be here especially at the Easter season where we had the meetings and the Lord did really powerful things also there minister to the personal needs and he's the same here tonight amen I want to share before we go into the word this is quite personal but I told it to brother Ron yesterday evening for the first time a dream I had in 21 and and this was the night from the 26th to the 27th of January 21. about brother Ron and as you know we we've met several times and the Lord has really used your pastor to bless us personally and I remember specifically in Switzerland I went to the The Altar and uh you know brother run under the anointing just mentioned a whole lot of things that nobody could know about he didn't know about but the Lord knew so uh all kinds of spirits that were against the ministry and I was so encouraged by that that it was identified so clearly and that the Lord would be our help and he has proven to be so so I had this dream and in this dream we uh there was like a little shed where brother Ron had had spent the night and so I just came to greet him and in this dream he had he put on his cap like you have in America very often a cap and he kind of made a joke like my cap is still fitting me after the operation from the brain tumor and the next the dream changes to I saw like a big shopping mall and with a lot of stores on both sides and several levels where you could look and it looked like we had ended a meeting and we we were a whole group of ministers all the ministers you know and several and we work on this it was like a huge bridge in the middle of this this gallery or the storage with several levels and there was a big roof and and great big pillars coming down to the ground but we were walking like on a higher elevated bridge that went through the building and so we looked down downstairs to where the one pillar went down and there I saw a brother run standing by that pillar and he was standing there alone waiting and and there was something that came over me and I spoke to the preachers in in that dream that it's not just up to brother run alone to believe for his healing but that we have to start doing the same to believe with him and and it ended with this we are in this together and so I I believe I dream a lot generally but when I woke up there was such a presence of the holy spirit in the room and I've never told this anyone until yesterday evening so I wanted to share that and just let you know that that little church in Belgium has been praying for your pastor people have been praying and fasting also and we believe that everything all things are possible Hallelujah so we just like to encourage you with that and well let's stand for the reading of the word and I want to thank brother Ron for allowing me to speak tonight or should I say brother Andrew this is usually your night so thank you very much for making the way and allowing us to speak brother and so enjoy your ministry and you're anointed singing lots of people back home follow your meetings and it's a great blessing and I just had it on my heart to come back as a little Act of Thanksgiving just to lift up the the hands of brother on lift up his arm and brother Andrew we are really proud of you in the midst of all the all of this and the brothers the church and and let me say God is proud of you all amen so let's go to the scripture and we want to read habakkuk I don't know I hope you don't mind my Flemish accent and the but we'll do our best to make ourselves understandable to you habakkuk chapter 2 and then we also go to revelation chapter 5 while you're turning there I want to thank everyone the Spencer family especially for the good care and and we are just treated like kings and I'm so thankful for that may the Lord give them back a hundredfold so habakkuk chapter 2 verse 1. I will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what I shall answer when I am reproved and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth hit for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it Terry wait for it because it will surely come it will not Tarry or many can say Amen to that Hallelujah let's go to Revelation 5 verse 5. and 6. and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the line of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to lose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth may God adds the blessing to the reading of his word let's just pray together and if you have a need tonight you can slip up your hand to the Lord and he knows what you have need of many hands dear heavenly father I have my hand lifted up also and father I humbly ask you that you will come tonight and help us Minister Lord Jesus anoint our lips to speak anoint the heroes to hear and father we all have needs we are a needy people Lord you know what has been below every hand Lord and father I don't know what this church needs I don't know what the needs are but you know and I pray you will Direct the father this service towards the needs of the people Lord father I I have prepared something but I'm willing to let go now Lord Jesus and follow your leading and not just me but all of us Lord we want to be led by your Holy Spirit father we rebuke every spirit that may stand against your Holy Spirit in the mighty name of Jesus Christ father we pray that your Holy Spirit may have Fuller preeminence tonight Lord when we go back home May our hearts be burning father may we say this wasn't our hearts burning when he talked to us along the way we humbly ask this Lord and we thank you Lord for brother Ron and we thank you that his healing is a completed work of Calvary Lord father we pray that you will continue to bless him and strengthen him Lord The church here and the office bearers we ask this and pray this in the name of Jesus Amen you may be seated God bless you hmm I would like to speak tonight as a title The Long awaited answer Hallelujah the long-awaited answer I don't know how it is with you but I think it's typical for a human nature that we have a hard time to wait generally speaking I don't know if there's anyone here who loves the waiting rooms at the dentist or the doctor I don't think so with the old magazines that hundreds of peoples have touched already and people complaining about this and that I believe our church is not a waiting room so to say but it's a birth room Hallelujah but there is a part of Christianity where God teaches us to wait Hallelujah and I believe if we are faithful in the waiting process at some time our name will be called and we'll have an appointment with Jesus Christ isn't that a relief when you've been sitting there for 45 minutes and suddenly you hear your name called Hallelujah isn't it wonderful when you hear your name called and saying it's my turn tonight so right from the start I want to encourage you tonight that Lord call my name whatever you need is Lord call my name Hallelujah he's the same God that said Mary and her eyes were open and she thought it was the gardener but when he called her by her name Hallelujah she knew it was Jesus Hallelujah I believe God sent us a message and and I believe you know the disciples returned to Jesus and they said they rejoiced and they said well demons are subject to us and Jesus said Rejoice not that demons are subject but that your names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah so we believe that God's commissioned the church to cast out demons and and we can be happy about it you know those who have ever been bound we should be happy you know I know what it was like to be bound and now I am free but the greatest joy is to know that your name is written in heaven Hallelujah Hallelujah look that's what the song says I have a name written in glory and it's mine oh Lord help us Hallelujah that's I want to read this in Revelation 10 7. but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery singular of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophet so many times we see this when it's singular the seed singular of Abraham the mystery of singular of God it is referring to Christ the prophet comes after the opening of the seals and he says Christ is the mystery singular of God revealed Hallelujah and we know Christ is the seed the Royal Seed of Abraham Hallelujah Christ is the one that would crush the Serpent's head Hallelujah and we know I I we know you've been well taught so we don't have to go into the depth of the doctrine of it but we know that Revelation 10 7 the the seventh angel that is brother Branham he's a forerunner just like John the Baptist was for his first coming now this seventh angel is a forerunner of his second coming for the Rapture Hallelujah and he is introducing Revelations 10 1 the mighty Angel which is Christ Hallelujah but we know the prophet is has come and he's gone now and we are now living under this dispensation where the transition went from Elijah Elijah Ministry to Elisha which is brother Branham in type in our day and the bride is Elisha is a type of the Bride of you and I amen so we now we come into picture Hallelujah you and I come into picture and and remember that before Elijah went away was raptured in a fiery chariot that he said whatever you ask it shall be given unto you Hallelujah Jesus said the same thing if you shall say to this mountain be removed and cast into the sea and shall not doubt in your heart but believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatever he saith Hallelujah how many believe that's what we possess tonight by God's grace Hallelujah and so we see Elisha now the last words Elijah expresses this if you see me when I go you shall have what you asked for so in other words if you see me as being gone Hallelujah so if you understand now that the ministry of Elijah is over he has played his part so it's a revelation to see brother Branham has played his part now it's our part to play then you will have your request Hallelujah then you can ask what you will if you understand it's not well when brother Branham was here and all those things but when we quote what he said Hallelujah let's be careful that we don't make him a god of History oh what if brother Branham would be here let me tell you the god of Elijah is here tonight Hallelujah oh what if my grandfather could be here with all the Miracles and the signs let me tell you the god of my grandfather is here tonight Hallelujah the god of brother Homer is here tonight Hallelujah and and as we said the other day if they could be here present in this meeting they would be so proud of you they would be rejoicing and happy and say press on this is what we fought for Hallelujah this is what we struggled for this is what we prayed for Hallelujah but they died in faith having not attained the promises and and they without us cannot be made perfect so they need us and we need them aren't we thankful there is a cloud of witnesses tonight I see brother Guido watching over the banisters of Heaven I see my grandfather as a Young Man Hallelujah I see your former Pastor brother Homer I see brother Charlie Hallelujah cheering Us in another dimension every time a soul gets saved they are rejoicing with the angels let me take of my armor here thank you brother I hope that's okay in this church Hallelujah you know what when we'll get to heaven there will be a lineup like both lines like a hedge of Honor and all the people of the seven Church ages will stand there and in a salute and they will start to be clapping for you and I how did the young people ever overcome in such an age how did parents overcome in such an age where the devil has turned everything upside down Satan's Eden you know Satan is the same back home as here he's in politics are rotten to the Core call it communism call it whatever you want to call it democracy is rotten to the Core there's only one hope for the church and that's Christ coming back for his church Hallelujah and I believe the end time message meets the end time conditions I couldn't take my grandfather's place to stand up against the Catholicism to stand up as a as a beacon of light in the middle in the midst of a Catholic country and stand as a Pioneer and stand as a Baptist Minister first and then come receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit and people made fun of him and then he would come into the message and start preaching the serpent seed and and health the church would just leave you know what I couldn't take his place yeah but he couldn't take mine God had a time and a season for everyone Hallelujah God has a time for a brother on for brother Andrew for brother Homer and he does things perfectly but you know God has given us the authority of his word and we are not just preaching about well gods and the prophet but we are preaching from an open book Hallelujah Hallelujah the answer is in there Hallelujah Christ is the mystery of God revealed he is the answer you say I'm I'm praying for an answer and and let me tell you he doesn't only have the answer he is the answer so as long as we have Jesus we have the answer how many believe that he is present here tonight he said I will never leave you nor forsake you Hallelujah I was born and raised in the message but let me tell you it never became common to me it all it always kept becoming more special to me and I trust that the same that's the same for you you might have questions about the message let me tell you it was always Satan's business to put a question mark behind the word of God he said when Jesus was on the earth he said if thou be the Son of God turn these stones into bread if thou be the Son of God jump from this Pinnacle of the Temple and he misquoted the scripture he does the same thing today but I want to tell you tonight that Jesus conquered all three Temptations not with his authority not with his power he could have killed Satan on the spot but he used his own word he said it is written and the prophet explains this you know why so that the weakest believer amongst us can use his word and defeat Satan Hallelujah any time any place under any conditions what a promise we have in this word but the hardest thing is we know God is real we know God answers prayer the hardest thing is to wait on the Lord he says here in the message perseverance the first thing you have to do if you're going to find Christ you got to know that you've got a need of him when you think that you just don't need him you'll never find him because you won't search him diligently that you notice what the scripture said seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened and and he goes on and it'll be opened and not just say I went out Lord here I am you want me that's not it he that seeketh he that knocketh he says it's a continuation so it doesn't happen always right on the spot if you are praying for the holy spirit let me tell you he said the same message to the disciples he said go to the city of Jerusalem and tarry there wait there it's one of the hardest things to do they sit in a room nothing going on so to say but they they were fulfilling promise he didn't tell them it's going to take 10 days and the 10th day it's going to happen he just said wait so God has a program for every one of you he has a specific set time for your healing for your miracle for your new birth Hallelujah but he says here like the unjust judge and the widow she constantly knocked on his door she was persistent if he turned her away tomorrow she was on his hands again that's the way you want to get to God be on his hands every morning every night every day all the time constantly just keep seeking asking knocking he says just don't knock a little while and get tired and go away just keep standing there Lord I'm here and I'm not going to leave I'm on your hands now I'm going to stay right here you're getting tired listening I'm having a great time knocking you know why because I know you are coming hallelujah hallelujah he's coming brother sister he's coming so we see that he he answered actually Jesus answered with a Bible answer he answered with a scriptural answer and and we are so thankful that in this day they asked the question about who is John the Baptist and they they asked all kinds of questions are you the Christ that you come are you alive and he said I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness so he went back to the scripture what it said about himself so we should do the same Hallelujah so we know brother Branham is the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 and Luke 17 30 and Revelation 10 7 which we just read let me tell you you and I are the Fulfillment of Revelation 10 verse 8 to 11. what is what is the story go to the angel so it means even as after brother Branham is it's gone and he's played his part the angel is still there the angel is still with this message the angel is still in your midst Hallelujah so we should start to be to be standing on the scripture and say this is my part and he says go and take the book out of the right hand of that angel so we should take the word of God it is written and he said eat the book take it up Hallelujah and and that's why the prophet even after the opening of the seals he says don't try to be peculiar just continue to read your Bible and pray because we need to read the Bible first and then we understand the promises of God so take the book eat it and it will be sweet in your mouth but bitter in your belly and let me tell you the bitter part is the waiting part amen it's easy to say by Stripes I'm Healed but when you still got the same symptoms it becomes bitter part but you know whether it be bitter or sweet it's gonna happen anyway because God said so by his stripes you are healed if you are sick tonight let me tell you Psalm 103 I am the god that healeth all thy diseases Hallelujah mental disease is physical diseases depression nervous Spirits we say in the name of Jesus be healed because the Bible says so Cancer all is included name it heart problems high blood pressure it's conquered in the name of Jesus but you know Satan comes around and now no doubt even tonight while I'm speaking he's saying who are you they said the same things about Jesus who give you the authority by which authority do you do these things it's quite interesting because we're waiting for an answer and and the devil will always put a question mark behind the word of God and you know Jesus never answered well I am the Son of God he always answered it is written I don't know about you we know we are a son of God we know you are a daughter of God we know where we stand Hallelujah the bride knows what he once done with the word Hallelujah nobody needs to explain us we have received a message Hallelujah we have no Pope to go through and ask well should we do this or that there's a message hallelujah it's all in there the answer is there Hallelujah but he has the same question if you are the Son of God even when he was hanging on the cross the thief on the left said if you are the Son of God you know the the Pharisees cried out if you are the Son of God come off the cross he could have done it actually he could have just nodded his head a little bit there were thousands of angels behind the bushes and he could just command one angel to get him off the cross but he didn't because he had a plan for you and I he had to conquer every enemy he had to conquer the sin question Hallelujah and when they asked him when they asked him by what Authority do you do these things he asked another question he said the baptism of John was it from heaven or from man and they couldn't answer it because both of the answers would get them stuck I like it when God asks questions he uses the technique of Satan against himself Hallelujah he takes a depressive spirit and makes the the enemy depressive Hallelujah [Applause] he takes that that the spirit of nervousness and he makes the devil nervous with it you know David when he conquered Goliath he took his own sword it wasn't David's sword I I challenge you tonight to challenge the devil and say I stand upon the word of God it's been conquered for me not by might not by power but by my spirit saith alone take all this Armory off me all this heavy stuff let me serve the Lord the way he created me let me worship him the way I want to worship Him Hallelujah but he always put that question mark and so Jesus said well if you can't answer it I'm not going to answer your question so listen closely we are not here to answer all the devil's foolish questions let's bring it down to one thing we are just to answer one question of the devil and the prophet calls it the sin question right and let me tell you Jesus has the answer Jesus is the answer I love what pulse has entitled 3 verse 9 it says avoid foolish questions that's something for for pastors I believe that's something for all those critical websites you find against the prophet Hallelujah [Applause] don't spend your time even on it I tried to a few times and the Lord said this is not your food Hallelujah he go you know John went to the Angel and the only thing that the bride has to eat is this word of God you know on the internet people are so easily swayed you don't even know who is behind it you don't even know what what their purpose is you don't even know if they are Vindicated and then they're surely not leading you to Christ and listen closely the devil is the same in Europe as here Hallelujah but let me tell you the Lord Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's the same everywhere no matter what the enemy does I like this he says avoid foolish questions genealogies contentions strives about the law for they are unprofitable in vain listen you can't feed the bride manna from yesterday Hallelujah we need Manna From the presence of God in the Shekinah Glory Hallelujah we say Lord we need fresh manna from your presence even tonight you know my you might say it's still Mana but the Lord makes it fresh tonight Hallelujah but you know it's Satan's strategy to put a question mark and a lot of question marks who Do You Think You Are by what Authority do you do think this and and it's a strategy to keep his keep us busy with his foolish questions and and and finally he's he's just distracting us from reading the word from reading the Bible for from going into the promises taking them for us and you know what about that thing those people who are against the prophet it's typical the thing you find those critical websites and maybe somebody is struggling with it let me tell you I love you we love you but there's a there is a strong demonic power behind it it's a hatred against God not just brother Branham God let me tell you a little bit the first stage is oh we just want the Bible not brother Branham it's just a lie a few months after that give it a few months time and the whole Bible is Torn to Pieces because it's the same thing if if you are against the message he preached what Paul preached you you are against what Paul preached amen but Satan has succeeded to make so many people major on minors and the major thing is that we receive salvation for our souls and the prophet even says Divine Healing is not even a major but it's a promise of God but the major thing is that our souls are saved Hallelujah that we are born again that we know that our names are written in heaven but Satan binds so many people by his question marks and people who once were free now begin to lose thoughts of freedom and they lose their joy of the Salvation they lose their faith they once had but let me tell you there's always a way back amen Hallelujah and you know I've never seen anyone listen closely I've never seen anyone turn his back on this message and become a better Christian amen [Applause] in fact that is quite the opposite they get wild in the things of the world most of I'm not saying everyone and listen I'm not judging tonight the Lord knows my heart I'm praying for many of those people because listen we shouldn't be lifted up in our hearts we are children of Abraham Abraham still kept praying for lot and his family he was still fighting and God help us to have the heart of Abraham Our Father let us not be lifted up and pride in the message and say we got it all and but let me tell you some people cross the line there is a line we can cross James says it like this James 1 14 he said but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed and when lust had conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death so we know the Bible tells us that the enemy cometh but to kill steal and destroy so his agenda is death is it he's the The Pale Horse Rider and it's the ultimate anointing of death is in this age where we live he even wants to keep human beings from reproducing he mixes his genders up and everything his agenda is to stop and kill the human race but Jesus said I have come that they might have life and life more abundantly but now James Compares it with a natural conception this so it's he says it's the own lust so it's the carnal nature and and when it's had conceived it bringeth forth sin and the result of sin is death so that's his agenda he starts with a simple question mark but his strategy is to kill you his strategy is to kill your marriage his strategy is to to disperse your children but I'm so thankful Hallelujah there is a promise in the Bible in the last days I will pour out my spirit on All Flesh it doesn't matter which country which culture which color of skin which family which character Hallelujah and he says your sons and daughters will prophesy and I will pour out my spirit on my servants and my handmaids and I like this part even those that are far off I challenge you in this church I don't know I challenge you to think about the most impossible case people that you think it's hopeless let me tell you the promise of the holy spirit is for them for those that are far off Hallelujah he says he read the message he cares he says whether you strike a prayer line whatever it is that isn't it do you care cast your cares upon Him He careth for you be sincere about it you care enough to be sincere for he was he has proven by a Vindicated word that he cares he promised to send it he's done it he's promised and the word here it is he cares now what about you so can you see the spirit of God challenging challenging us just like John we know John is a type of the Bride he has to step forward now we have to make a move he says it's uh it's you ought to care next he cared enough to conquer every enemy for you that all you have to do is be sincere and believe it he conquered death amen death ain't nothing for me to conquer it's already conquered sickness ain't for me to conquer it ain't for Christ to conquer it's already conquered I just have to care enough to believe us I say Lord tonight creating us a care are you afraid of what somebody else has told you are you afraid of the doctor's diagnosis are you afraid of what the church might say to you are you afraid to stand there Toe to Toe with the Devil say I have confessed my sins I've laid aside everything I believed every word Here I Am Lord created me a care how many remember that vision of brother Branham at the end of his life in the message on the wings of a snow white dove where that squirrel hit that big Cactus and it and it was totally killed in that Vision a black squirrel and it represented the sickness in his stomach that he was struggling for such a long time and the word he received is your enemy is dead and that of the end of the service he starts singing that song on the wings of a snow white dove let me tell you tonight your enemy is dead or you might say I just heard him speak and Whisper let me tell you Christ conquered him at the cross he said it is finished and he has done everything he's done away with the sin problem the sin question he conquered it at Calvary he uses another example here in Jehovah Jireh part two he says if a great dragon or an animal like a lion has a spaw hooked in my side that was a tumor or a cancer trying to kill me as he says there's no need of just trying just to cut his foot off or Divine Healing if you just knock them in the head it kills the whole thing I love this tonight and when Jesus died for sins he died for every attribute that sin ever produced so when sin was finished it was all finished the complete Plan of Redemption if you just knock him in the head with a sin question kill sin you kill every attribute of it that's that's powerful stuff tonight Hallelujah what is sin unbelief so when you kill all unbelieve why you know that God's words right he's the same yesterday today and forever so all the promises are yours walk through the land it's all yours it belongs to you just enjoy it it's yours God gave it to you the grace of God gave it to you it's all yours when the sin questions over he says you've received the Holy Ghost and everything you have need of in this life journey is right here in the Bible for you everything you have need of Hallelujah the Bible says it and God brings with the tribulation with the Temptation he brings the way out Hallelujah just before you even had the problem God already had the solution hallelujah it's no longer struggling the solution was before the problem Hallelujah the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world before sin ever came he was the lamb slain and he conquered death so it's not up to us to be struggling and wandering and putting question marks and all these things we know we have a defeated enemy tonight Hallelujah if we can just solve the sin question Hallelujah in Christ answer that question for us remember that Vision in the message Paradox of that great mamba snake and and brother random sees a brother of his that is jumping away and and people there's a kind of there's a fear that grips the church and and and because of that Mamba and and he could sense it in a vision and there's so many dangerous things these days so here's these things and he says and we know he explains this mamba snake represents death it's instant death when it hits you you we know it's it's the first snake and it's so aggressive that it often just hits the victims just right in the face and so he he knows that that it's death representing death which is is the real Sin question it's the result of sin and and it's it's the scheme it's the plan of Satan and and here is brother brennaman and the vision the voice says whatever you bind you've been given power to bind him and to unbind him so it's not the Lord saying well I'm cursing the enemy but he wants you and I to speak that word and he has given the church the authority to do so he said in my name you shall cast out demons in my name you shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover but that same voice said you've also been given to unbind him you you might start confessing faith and you bind that enemy in your life but as soon as you start a negative confession you revive the enemy you revive that sickness or that problem and you're not alive amen that's that's what I understand maybe it's it's very simple but really that's how simple it is but we struggle with it because he puts his question mark well I've been anointed I've been brother on prayed for me and anointed me with all the brothers prayed for me and I thought I had my healing but a few days later the the enemy comes and listen you expect him to put question marks when you're filled with the Holy Spirit I always tell people just enjoy the time it's like a parachute in the air just enjoy the time but be careful before you know you'll land on your feet and the battle starts amen so it doesn't it's not the end station it only starts there the baptism of the Holy Spirit you know every enemy will stand against you and and it the prophet makes a astounding statement he he says on the day of Pentecost he said there were three thousand Souls saved you know the quote and the devil didn't even come out of his bed but when they came at the gate beautiful and one man was supernaturally healed every demon in hell was against the church if you start to believe a god that is the same yesterday today and forever let me tell you every arrow of the enemy will be pointed against you he will anoint people to criticize you he will speak directly in your mind don't think like ministers have to struggle with this in the Pulpit also who Do You Think You Are let me tell you tonight it is written Hallelujah they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony that's you and I tonight Hallelujah and then we know when he came out of the vision he he asked the Lord to be more sincere and I believe that's what we all should be praying for I've prayed that prayer so many times I prayed it this afternoon I lifted up my hands said Lord make me more sincere and I think that's the prayer we should all pray all the time Paul speaks these things and and he says let's not come again with an unleavened bread of of malice and and strive but let's come with the unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth you know the angel was always scriptural he referred to that text when he came out of the vision let me read you what the prophet says here in the resume of the ages he says this age started after the turn of the 20th century as it was to the to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost we know that there must of necessity be a return of dynamic power amen you believe that tonight he said the Believers sensed in their spirits and sense this in their spirits and begin crying for God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century and he says here this statement what seemed to be the answer so we're speaking about that tonight the long-awaited answer what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues and manifest the gifts of the Spirit it was then believed it was indeed the long awaited restoration it was not for the latter rain can only come after the former rain which is a spring or teaching rain the letter Reign then is the Harvest rain and later on he says it is Faith for the rapture amen how many believe that the Lord promised in so many Bible texts that those two will fall together in the last time and it's a very difficult balance for every church for every Ministry to keep that balance with between teaching and preaching between teaching the Bible and preaching a supernatural God Hallelujah and the prophet says the the bride you have the fundamentalist on one side and the Fanatics on the other side and he says the bride walks in the middle and she draws from both sides but let me tell you I don't know about you at least for me it's a very difficult balance but we shouldn't be afraid the holy spirit is here to guide us Hallelujah he says here I'm talking about in Christ it's a mystery I'm talking about the headship of Christ not as being personally identified by the original headship we have the answer to the devil's question Hallelujah he repeats us we have the answer to the devil's question he Christ is risen and he paid a prize raising up the head of the body the devil cannot stand it right that's the reason this eucharenical kingdoms are setting up that's the reason they're all coming into what they're doing now he says the devil that's the reason he's howling the way he is so don't be worried when you hear howling on the internet don't be worried when you hear maybe howling on the job or whatever man that's right did you know Paul said this expression in the way that's called heresy I worship the god of my fathers there is a name tag to it when you start to believe a supernatural God but you know what we are not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen we are not ashamed of the Holy Spirit we are not ashamed of the promises of God he says again we have the devils answer it's not me that liveth but Christ the word living in me it's not my idea it's his power it's not my idea it's his word he promised that here it is he said it would be here and here it is listen it's not something to come it is here that's what the prophet says Christ is risen and has paid the price for our Redemption we have Satan's answer God has Vindicated himself God proves himself to his promise in this day the headship is here Christ the Risen Lord is here in the same power of his resurrection that he ever was manifesting himself there's the devil's and you know when Jesus met the enemy there in the desert as we said he conquered and the prophet takes first John 2 verse 16. he says all that is in the world is the lust of the eye the lust of the Flesh of the Flesh and the pride of life you can actually this is the root of all sin and and the Prophet The Prophet comes and he takes takes the three Temptations in the wilderness and first John 2 and he overlaps them and he says it's the same thing Christ has conquered the three things for you is that wonderful and so he didn't defeat Satan on with his power with his authority but on the word of God and I like this expression somewhere the prophet says he hit like a 10 000 volt cable and then another place he says that kind of singed his feathers but let me tell you tonight you are conductors of the Holy Spirit and I'm praying tonight we can say Lord connect me to that ten thousand fold line whenever the enemy comes connect me to that ten thousand fold line God commissioned you to sing to the enemy's feathers Hallelujah that's powerful Hallelujah you see the thief on the left he kept on he was anointed to ask that question mark if you are the Son of God but the thief on the right he said I this I I receive what I deserve but this man has done nothing and he said Lord remember me isn't that wonderful and he said today thou shall be in Paradise With Me what an answer here is a thief and a rubber he done everything his whole life he didn't deserve to go to heaven to Paradise and one simple answer we were that Thief Hallelujah if there's somebody in sin if you are that one let me tell you it doesn't take hours of theology it doesn't take weeks months of study just a few minutes in his presence and if you will just recognize this man hasn't done nothing I am the one who deserves to die Remember Me Lord tonight Hallelujah he will speak that long-awaited answer he says again here in my angels shall go before thee and when you can hit Satan with a scripture he's just as powerless as he can be Hallelujah so we see the question mark of Satan is really this it's unbelief in God's word he he brings doubt he brings frustration he brings question marks and and I know if we go to the Bible we see here we are in a week after the resurrection and think about cleopas and his friend going to Emmaus and the Bible said they were reasoning they were talking to each other communing they were asking the questions but they had no answer and this is powerful while they are asking the question Jesus joined himself with them Hallelujah so here they are in their Earthly thinking and they and and the Lord asked them why is you why are you so sad where is your countenance set as if we didn't know but I love it when he asks questions but he wants to make them think there's no reason to be said Jesus had just died and rose again there's an empty grave but they didn't catch it and the Bible says their eyes will hold and they couldn't see him and here he goes back to Psalm 22 and Jeremiah 12 and all the text the prophet describes it so beautifully and he he didn't say show a miracle and whatever but he went back to what the scripture said about himself didn't the prophet say this would happen didn't Isaiah said this would happen and I fear so many times that we in our lives that we we we start to lose our faith because we try to answer the questions of the devil and we we wonder why is this happening we we never expected this to happen and we've forgotten all along Jesus was walking with us and it was just being patient and preaching to you service after service and using another Ministry and and here comes another Ministry ether and he's trying to catch your attention but let me tell you somewhere in the middle of a CERN suddenly you recognized by the breaking of the bread it's Jesus it's always been Jesus he's always been there in my deepest moment even when I doubted when I didn't deserve the answer he was there with me you know cleopas and he could have gone elsewhere but he'll so loved them that and he took his time Hallelujah and and you know it's exact parallel with laodicea he says specifically about this age I stand at the door and I knock if anyone will hear my voice and open the door I will sup with him and he with me so that's exactly what happened there with cleopas and his friend foreign to brother run yesterday evening a testimony and I won't go into the details but I was at the one of the deepest crisis in my life in the ministry I was so hurt and disappointed and broken under the criticism and all the things that went on and let me tell you we were in the midst of a conversation with the pastor and the Deacons and some were in the middle of that conversation brother Biscoe had preached on the convention in the morning on cleopas and the title was he went with them and we refer to that sermon and going back to the world we were asking questions about the future of our church and what's going to happen though and all these things just like cleopas and his friends and at some point I just lifted up my hand my finger like this and I said he's still with us and God is my witness as soon as I said that the ceiling of the room broke open with the power of God and we fell on our faces the five of us we started worshiping God we wept before God and all we could say when we stood up as brother I love you brother I love you and when I stood up all the pain all the hurt all the negative thoughts had left me see it doesn't take a long time just a few minutes in his presence do you realize he's here tonight and I pray for our eyes are Holden may the Lord open our eyes at the breaking of the bread I'm saying Ruth like Ruth and Boaz in the Bible where are you are you still deciding Elijah said this to the people of his day he said why do you hold between two opinions he says let the god that answers by fire be God I'm saying tonight let the god that answer with fire be God you might have your altar you might have all the pieces of wood you might even have your sacrifice but it's all in vain if there's no fire to consume it I say Lord consume My Sacrifice tonight give us an answer from heaven saying Ruth are you still deciding we know all the stages Ruth deciding Roots Ruth serving Ruth resting and finally Ruth rewarded wherever you are in this stage I'm saying to you advance go on like like the Lord said to Job sitting on the ash Heap and one day the Lord said stand up and girth thyself as a man I want to speak to you answer me where were you when I lay the foundations of the world when the sons of God shouted for Joys and the Stars shouted for gladness if you only realize the Lord wants to bring Ruth through all the stages to the point where it's no more laboring no more gleaning no more me trying to overcome sin no more coming back receiving forgiveness falling back into sin but God wants to bring you to a place where he's your husband it all belongs to you you don't have to take the crumbles from the table anymore but he you can sit at the table Hallelujah he's inviting you to sit at the table tonight he wants to talk with you for a little while he wants to break the bread of life and say I've been with you always I've been there in The Darkest Hour David said if I make my bed in hell Thou Art there laughs he's always been faithful I said Lord forgive me I've doubted you so many times I've listened so many times to the enemy renew the joy of our Salvation tonight create the right spirit in US where were you job when I laid the foundation you see here where the apostles in the upper room and one moment they were all Renegades fugitives running from their own Shadows and the next stage it just bumped the doors open and started to sing and shout and praise God Hallelujah and the people in the street could hear them praise God in their language Hallelujah let me tell you Peter and John they knew who they were they knew what we had what they had Hallelujah that's exactly what they said Silver and Gold Have I known but such as I have I give unto you we have something to give tonight you know you can apply that same salvation to your loved ones Hallelujah and here is the prophet and he says the Greater Works is imparting eternal life Hallelujah he wants to use you to bring someone to Christ he wants to use you for your children to get saved and filled with the Holy Spirit you know what a few weeks ago I knelt in every room of my children at the bed and I'm praying and believing for them I'm I know he will do it brother sister because it's a promise for your sons and your daughters you you you might say he's way back he's is drinking he's in the sins of the world let me tell you it's a promise for your sons and daughters for them that are far off we have a little niece that is endured and living together with a man and it's the most impossible situation but let me tell you we keep on claiming the blood of Jesus Christ I'm not ashamed to stand in front of my church and say I believe for her We Believe for the bexleyden brothers and sisters Hallelujah there's a beautiful expression that the prophet uses many times and he says don't worry it'll be there so simple but so real don't worry brother it'll be there the long-awaited answer it'll be there he hasn't forgotten you brother sister he knows every tear you cried he has heard every prayer listen Daniel the Lord the angel that came to him he was fighting a battle to come through but he said these words from the first day that you set your heart to believe even before he prayed all of his prayers from the first day I was sent from the presence of God mentioned angels and demons are fighting each other let me tell you your answer is on the way it might take a little waiting and let me tell you God knows exactly the second and the minute you will receive it you know when Satan tempted job it said he came back from running to and fro over the Earth but our Lord doesn't have to run to and fro Hallelujah it's amazing but he he can be omnipresent he can be everywhere at the same time he can be in Belgium and here in Elkton at the same time and he is it's not he can be he is he is ever present water from The Rock he is the omnipotent all power he is the omniscient he knows all things imagine the the the the intelligence of our God he can hear all those millions of prayers and he solves every one of them he hears every one of them no tear falls to the ground no hair of your head falls to the ground without him knowing there's no sparrow that falls to the ground without him knowing but he says you are so much more precious than a sparrow there's not even a gnat that can blink his eye without him knowing so when we pray to God for healing for the holy spirit is it is not that we are in are informing the Lord we don't have to he has no need for information he just wants us to believe amen so we don't have to give a whole description of all the details he knows already but he says ask pray knock and it shall be given to you it shall be open to you isn't that wonderful the answer is on the way and Satan said over and over again if you take away the Hedge the protection if you allow them to get sick you know Satan cannot touch your life the least hair without asking permission to the Lord and when the Lord says okay you can go he knows already you will make it he has so much trust and confidence in you that he says go ahead and Satan with his false prophecy said well if you take away the Hedge he will curse you to your face and job did exactly the opposite he worshiped the Lord and he did not sin in one of his words even to his wife he didn't say you are a foolish woman he said you speak like a foolish woman isn't that a testimony so God had to come down this is one of my favorites I'm trying to find here I'm gonna say it by heart but you can look it up by and in the message he says it it took a long time for the Hebrew children I I hope I quote it right here in the message I've heard but now I see he said we find in those hours of real stress how many people has gone through those things hours of real stress amen many times he says that's usually when the spirit of God Moves In isn't that powerful you think it's so negative I'm under pressure he says that's usually when the spirit of God Moves In he said he let the Hebrew children walk right into the fiery furnace before he ever moved a hand listen to what he says here but when he moves he moves when he moves he moves he brings in the helicopters the jet planes he brings he brings us Angels he brings the power of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah he brings the blood to forgive your sin when he moves he moves he's a supernatural God so I encourage you tonight even if the vision parries Hallelujah if you have to wait it will not tarry it will come and let me say your light has come Hallelujah it has come he has conquered every enemy Hallelujah he has conquered death and that snake is not only death but everything below it cancer depression nervousness Hallelujah worldlyism Hallelujah cigarettes in the name of Jesus Christ they have to go he conquered it for you but I tried Brother David Ruth you're still gleaning you have to come to the place where you are resting in the promises of God and he will reward you Hallelujah let me tell you the answer is not just on the way he was with you all the time as the song says he was there all the time Jesus cried at the cross it is finished and you can see the same statement in the Book of Revelation it is done it is done everything God needed to do is done all we can do is say Lord yes I believe I believe it's for me I believe the holy spirit is for me so let me tell you there's no more excuses there's no more excuses there's no more ignorance we have received the message Satan's plans have been exposed and Paul says it like this we are not ignorant of Satan's devices God has sent us and and we know Revelation exposes Satan it exposes that Antichrist spirit that comes within the framework of the church and by God's power we can withstand discern and withstand that spirit and and I always say to the church let's start in our own lives to discern it we are so quick to point fingers say Lord maybe I'm under the wrong spirit maybe I think negative amen so we are not sent to answer the devil's questions but the question the sin question and let me tell you the answer has come God has opened a book he has loosened the seals and the prophet says it like this he tore the seals of of himself and he calls the Bible a new book you might say it's the same words but let me tell you too the bride of Christ it is our marriage certificate Boaz is your husband it says we are married no longer gleaning no longer me trying to overcome alcohol no longer me trying to overcome lust the Holy Spirit has already conquered it for you it only has to become a reality to you I cannot overcome my own flesh I need Christ Hallelujah I need to cross I need the blood of a perfect lamb to wash my sins away I'm not pointing to myself I'm pointing to the Lamb of God he is perfect Hallelujah let me find a place to finish this off tonight God bless you you're drawing so wonderfully may the Lord bless you this is one of my favorite stories or events that the prophet said you remember the story when a car salesman uh wanted to find whether he had the holy ghost or not and he grabs in his pocket and he finds a little note and here is a sinner A ranked Sinner and he finds a note and it says where will you spend eternity and it so strikes him and and the prophet tells the whole story he goes to all the the big preachers all the big names and Billy Graham and Oral Roberts and and he shouted and he jumped and he did all those things and he and he comes to the prophet and he says but I still I'm still looking for it and here is the prophet and he said and he takes that man and he sits down and he says you don't need even need a prophet to straighten you out you just need the word of God and he said what Mr Graham told you is the truth the Nazarene what they told you is the truth the Pentecostal is the truth and yet he says it's not the truth he says to shout to raise up your hands to speak with tongues is not receiving Christ amen but we do believe in those things they are gifts they are Gifts of Jesus Christ but it is not receive in Christ amen so he's explaining this man and he says receiving Christ is receiving the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and then he says these other things take place after that he said you could do all those things and still didn't have Christ yet and he says well brother Branham where can I find him he said I want to ask you something let's go back to your story and he walked up he said well what you what do you mean well you said that day when you come in picked up that piece of paper something struck you and you said oh I want to see God is he said from up to that time you were going this way down the road and you turned this way what did it what changed your opinion what come into your heart that made you one time not care for God and something come in to make you go to loving God what done it he said well I don't know he's still blind to the answer Hallelujah he said before there could be a creation there had to be a Creator to create that creation God came into your heart right there when you looked at that piece of paper he said you mean I've had it all along I said certainly brother and he jumped out of there and began to scream and cry that's the time to scream and cry laughs that was settled what is it he said do you want to pray for me brother Bradham he said what's the use of praying for you you don't need any prayer the truth has set you free Hallelujah so it's the correct answer it's the right answer that liberated this man imagine someone receiving the New Birth the Holy Spirit by reading a note that's a whole different dimension isn't it how simple God can be maybe there's someone that's doubting tonight but you have that experience Hallelujah you might say well I never shouted or spoken tongues and those things let me tell you you know you was there when it happened Hallelujah you ought to know you were there and God was there something changed your life you might and you know the devil will try to compare and say well your friend received it this way and another one received it this way let me tell you there's no testimonies there's no two testimonies alike God Is So loves his children that he gives each one of you a specific individual testimony and experience and the Bible says they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their own testimony there's no two testimonies alike [Music] I know what I'm speaking of you know so many people have the Holy Spirit but the Satan puts a question mark let me tell you the correct answer even tonight when while we are preaching finishing the the right answer is in this room the truth has set you free you don't even need prayer he said isn't that powerful the truth has already set you free I am so thankful that that is a certain sound there's no doubt in it God is going to have a bride without spot or wrinkle God is going to have not just survivors but Overcomers and he says I'm going to give you a white stone with your new name written on it and nobody knows it but yourself nobody you have don't have to go to anybody else for the confirmation you and God say God I need an answer I need an assurance tonight the Lord bless you it was such a wonderful audience God bless you as the musicians come let's stand the answer is here tonight you know what so many times the devil wants to tempt us to explain explain this explain that but the our Prophet told us that there is still a supernatural element despite the revelation there's still a part that we can never explain amen so let's let's allow God to do the Supernatural part Hallelujah let's just bow our heads for a moment before we change the order of the service maybe there's someone tonight you're saying in your mind and I've been listening to I've been listening to the all the question marks that Satan put behind God's word maybe he said it's not for you maybe you said these words you're not good enough maybe he's saying your experience is too simple [Music] let me tell you tonight there's a God that take away all the doubts and all unbelief [Music] maybe you're there and you're struggling for your healing and you try
