[46:02] about with truth and having on the
[46:04] breastplate of righteousness and your
[46:06] feet shod with the preparation of the
[46:09] gospel peace
[46:10] above all taking the shield of faith
[46:13] wherewith you shall be able to
[46:16] quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
[46:19] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[46:22] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[46:24] god
[46:25] praying always all praying always with
[46:28] all prayer and supplication in the
[46:30] spirit and watching there unto with all
[46:33] perseverance and supplication
[46:36] for all saints may god bless his word he
[46:38] may be seated
[46:52] so sir we'd like to speak to you this
[46:53] evening on
[46:54] recognizing recognizing your enemy and
[46:57] we realize that as as children of god
[47:00] and followers of the message we
[47:02] recognize that we are in the midst of
[47:05] satan's eden
[47:06] and we we realize that that there we've
[47:09] had a prophet come and stand stand and
[47:12] preach to us and
[47:13] declare to us that we are not in we are
[47:16] not in the garden of eden but here we
[47:18] are in satan's eden in the worst of all
[47:20] times in the darkest of all ages and
[47:23] satan has had over 6 000 years of
[47:25] setting up and bringing about this
[47:28] bringing about this eden and brother
[47:30] branham would would tell us when he
[47:31] comes and if you're very familiar with
[47:33] that message satan's eden you're you're
[47:35] reminded that brother branham when he
[47:37] was standing there it's it's a very
[47:38] dynamic meeting or message that you'll
[47:41] listen to and i trust you you're
[47:42] familiar with the with that text that
[47:45] brother branham said he said i thought
[47:47] that i would bring something to your
[47:48] mind or something that would enlighten
[47:51] you to know to know than to make you a
[47:54] better soldier in the field that you're
[47:56] fighting in to learn to learn the
[47:59] tactics of the enemy and i love that
[48:01] that that he brought us something that
[48:03] would make us better soldiers in this
[48:05] field not in the field of luther or in
[48:07] the field of wesley or the other garners
[48:10] but to stand in this field to give us to
[48:13] learn the tactics of the enemy so that
[48:15] you can block everything before it gets
[48:17] to you he said that's the main thing is
[48:19] to learn to keep the punches off of you
[48:22] as much as you can he said that's the
[48:25] main thing is to learn to keep the
[48:27] punches off of you as much as you can if
[48:30] there ever was a day that we we ought to
[48:32] be standing and trying to keep the
[48:34] punches off of us it's this day because
[48:36] we are under attack like never before as
[48:39] sons and daughters of god everything
[48:41] that we stand for and everything that we
[48:43] represent that is true and holy we stand
[48:46] against an enemy and he is trying he's
[48:48] not just he's not just standing in the
[48:50] ring and not not throwing any darts at
[48:52] us he's not just standing there and
[48:54] standing back and watching how we handle
[48:56] but he's attacking us day in and day out
[48:59] time in and time out trying to attack us
[49:02] in our flesh and a flat afflict us in
[49:04] our mind and afflict us in our soul but
[49:07] we recognize that that here we are in
[49:09] satan's eating and we can look back in
[49:11] the very beginning at the garden of eden
[49:13] and we can recognize that that that eve
[49:16] was deceived into it and she didn't
[49:18] willfully walk out there but she was
[49:20] deceived into it and she turned down the
[49:23] very word of god and to think that's a
[49:25] night to put it in your mind that here
[49:27] they were they were in the very fortress
[49:30] of the word of god they were back behind
[49:32] as what to put it into our children's
[49:34] mind that they were behind as you were
[49:37] called a fortress or a great castle and
[49:40] there they were they were behind that
[49:42] very word and they were they were they
[49:43] were safe behind that word but when when
[49:46] she stepped out behind that wall of the
[49:49] word then the enemy was able to attach
[49:52] her attack her and to get to her mind
[49:55] and to bring her over into reasoning
[49:57] powers and he made her deny all of the
[49:59] word of god by just telling her just
[50:02] taking away one word you see what he was
[50:05] doing he was out there on the outside of
[50:07] that wall and he was trying to get her
[50:09] to come out there with him you see as
[50:11] long as you're behind that word he can't
[50:13] get to you you see all of his all that
[50:16] is sowing at you as things is things
[50:18] that are close to the word of god
[50:20] they're so close that it would deceive
[50:22] the elect if it was possible living
[50:24] right here in this hour and he's
[50:26] speaking those lies he doesn't come out
[50:28] and tell you that the bible's a lie but
[50:30] he comes in there and he's very slick
[50:32] how he does things he'll make you think
[50:34] that it's so right or so close that sure
[50:38] we're right here in this in it's it's
[50:40] got to be correct but we recognize that
[50:42] we are in a spiritual warfare and the
[50:45] enemy is after each and every one of us
[50:47] he's after our families he's he's after
[50:49] us but we recognize that the bible tells
[50:52] us that the word is our wall of defense
[50:55] you recognize that the bible said in
[50:57] zechariah 2 and 5 that i saith the lord
[50:59] i will be unto her a wall of fire round
[51:02] about and will be the glory in the midst
[51:05] of her so we can never allow our guard
[51:08] to get down and what we've got to always
[51:10] as peter would say in peter first peter
[51:12] 5 and 8 to be sober and to be vigilant
[51:15] so because we recognize that there is an
[51:18] enemy there is a roaring lion seeking
[51:21] whom he may devour he's going about
[51:22] trying even right now in this service to
[51:25] even hinder every little thing but here
[51:27] we are we've got to be alert we've got
[51:29] to be vigilant because the enemy is
[51:31] wanting to breach the walls of the word
[51:34] so let me say this to you this is not
[51:36] another message this is the message it
[51:39] is a restoration of the very truth of
[51:42] god and christ is our wall of fire and
[51:45] eve did deny the very word of god she
[51:48] walked away from the very word of god
[51:50] because she got out on the outside of
[51:52] that wall but if you can stand where
[51:54] christ is if you can stand where the
[51:56] word is you you'll recognize that christ
[51:58] is our wall of fire but we're not like
[52:01] that eve of the last day you and i are
[52:03] anointed by accepting what eve turned
[52:06] down and to think the power that the
[52:08] bride of jesus christ has is she's not
[52:10] just standing there that's another lady
[52:13] but she's anointed
[52:14] she's anointed to handle the word it was
[52:17] it was the wife it was eve that got us
[52:19] into this trouble it was by her mouth
[52:22] walking out there that got her into
[52:24] trouble and it'll be our mouth that gets
[52:26] us out of trouble it's going to be
[52:28] somebody that'll take the word of god
[52:30] and put it upon their lips the word of
[52:32] god never failed in the mouths of those
[52:35] early believers they stood there
[52:37] toe-to-toe with the enemy and they put
[52:39] the word of god on their lips and we
[52:41] recognize that brother branham said in
[52:42] the god of this evil age he said we find
[52:45] now that this evil age is to prove to
[52:48] satan
[52:49] to prove to satan that she is not like
[52:53] eve that she is not at that type of a
[52:55] woman he said she will be tried by his
[52:57] word the bride as adam's bride was tried
[53:00] to by the word adam's bride believed
[53:03] every bit of the word but confused on
[53:05] one promise he said that he's the same
[53:07] yesterday today and forever
[53:10] you think that he that's the theme of
[53:12] this message as he's the same yesterday
[53:14] today and forever and satan come in
[53:17] there and slicked his way under that
[53:19] wall and he took her down on this one
[53:21] point that he's the same yesterday today
[53:24] and forever
[53:27] he said under the temptation of the
[53:28] enemy he said she failed on one promise
[53:31] under the temptation of the enemy face
[53:34] to face recognize the battle is face to
[53:36] face and now the people that's called
[53:39] for his name of course is his bride
[53:41] she's to come into contact again by the
[53:44] same thing not just by some
[53:45] denominational truth he said or
[53:47] something he said but by every word of
[53:50] god and we recognize that that the enemy
[53:53] that we're facing is a real devil
[53:56] i'd say that every one of us can witness
[53:58] tonight by uplifting hand that you ran
[54:01] into the devil in some way in your life
[54:03] maybe he gave you a bad thought maybe he
[54:05] gave you a thought that you weren't
[54:06] elected maybe he gave you a thought that
[54:08] that you're gonna die with this certain
[54:09] disease or maybe give you this thought
[54:11] that you're not good enough each and
[54:13] every one of you have fought the devil
[54:15] in some form and when you can recognize
[54:17] what the devil is recognize who he is
[54:20] and what he does and how he acts then
[54:22] you can have overcoming power when you
[54:24] begin to recognize who the enemy is the
[54:27] enemy's not your brother the enemy's not
[54:29] your sister that is sitting here but
[54:31] it's the enemy that's sitting there it's
[54:33] a wolf in sheep's clothing that jesus
[54:36] would stand there he said that in the
[54:38] last days there'll be false prophets
[54:39] that have come in there he said they'll
[54:41] be wary they'll be wearing sheep's
[54:43] clothing there they're they're inwardly
[54:45] a wolf on the inside of them paul would
[54:47] say after my departure that there would
[54:49] be wolves that would come in there and
[54:51] they would try to spare they wouldn't
[54:53] spare the flock of god but first john 4
[54:56] 1 says beloved try the spirits whether
[54:59] they be of god or of not this is how you
[55:02] try the spirits you give them a word
[55:04] test it doesn't matter what it is you
[55:06] give them a word test and if they can't
[55:08] accomplish 100 of it that spirit by the
[55:11] word of god you'll know that it is a
[55:13] spirit of the antichrist
[55:18] you see satan don't want you recognizing
[55:20] who he is and he doesn't wreck he
[55:22] doesn't want you recognizing how he's
[55:24] moving he's because if you recognize who
[55:27] he is and how he moves how he attacks
[55:30] you will be giving you'll be getting
[55:32] that power on the inside of you you'll
[55:35] get a power on the inside of you to deny
[55:37] every every tactic of the devil
[55:41] he will come to you with one key
[55:44] unbelief
[55:46] unbelief is the only sin that is sin is
[55:49] unbelief it's not smoking it's not
[55:51] drinking it's not alcohol it's not all
[55:54] these different things but unbelief is
[55:56] sin those things are the attributes of
[55:59] sin those are the things that take you
[56:01] down that road but you remember that
[56:03] wherever ever wherever jesus is satan is
[56:07] very close
[56:09] everywhere jesus was at judas was real
[56:11] close
[56:12] everywhere everywhere cain was or
[56:14] everywhere abel was cain was there and
[56:17] because of a jealous spirit that came
[56:19] upon him
[56:20] he killed his brother because it showed
[56:23] that he couldn't handle the word truth
[56:25] because abel had a revelation and better
[56:28] cain had an opportunity
[56:30] to follow after what abel did
[56:34] but because he was of that wicked one he
[56:37] could not follow the path of revelation
[56:40] let me let me just drop back and follow
[56:42] let me follow some of the message right
[56:44] here if you can't come and line up with
[56:46] every word of god
[56:49] it'll show who your daddy is
[56:51] but if you can line your life up with
[56:53] the very word of god it'll show where
[56:55] you came from it'll show where are you
[56:57] going
[56:59] [Applause]
[57:02] the enemy ain't too excited about when
[57:04] you just shout he ain't just excited
[57:06] about when you lift your hand he's not
[57:09] just excited he doesn't even move out of
[57:11] his bed when somebody gets excited or
[57:13] dances or shouts even speaks in tongues
[57:16] but he gets excited and rolls over in
[57:18] his bed when somebody starts taking the
[57:21] very word of god as for their truth as
[57:24] for their life and they start stomping
[57:26] down devils and start stomping down kids
[57:29] cancer and stomping down diseases
[57:32] that's when he rolls out of his bed when
[57:34] he recognizes that his props are about
[57:36] to get knocked out from underneath of
[57:38] him i say all hell better watch how
[57:42] there's a church of the living god that
[57:44] knows where she's standing at satan be
[57:47] careful
[57:49] we've recognized your tricks we've
[57:52] recognized your lies and we will not
[57:55] stand for it we will not back off of
[57:57] god's promises
[58:02] hallelujah
[58:06] mother branham would tell us knowing
[58:09] being a being a professional boxer
[58:11] he would tell us
[58:13] in the contest he said you got to have a
[58:14] sparring partner
[58:16] that can that can take you to an edge
[58:19] that can take you to an edge that can
[58:20] hit you hit you like an enemy hits you
[58:23] like the guy that you're going to get
[58:24] boxing in the ring with and when you're
[58:27] when you're dancing out there with that
[58:29] sparring partner you're dancing out
[58:31] there you're not just standing out there
[58:32] watching what he's doing he said but he
[58:35] said you're training
[58:36] to hit the enemy
[58:38] you see it's not just good enough to get
[58:40] into the ring of the message it's not
[58:42] just good enough to stand in the corner
[58:44] and know that jesus is over there it's
[58:46] not just good enough to dance around
[58:48] with the enemy you've got to take what
[58:50] you have been given and you've got to
[58:52] hit the devil you've got to take what
[58:54] you've been given and you've been
[58:56] trained under this you've been sitting
[58:58] here all of these years
[59:00] listening to message after message you
[59:03] are a well-trained body of jesus christ
[59:07] it ain't good enough for you just to sit
[59:09] back and well i listened to one message
[59:11] this week or i i prayed one time this
[59:13] week you got to train to hit the enemy
[59:16] you got to take what you've been given i
[59:18] said devil
[59:20] i'm not going to let you stand there and
[59:22] hit me i'm going to hit you back with
[59:24] every power that i've got i ain't got
[59:26] much but what i got i'm going to tear
[59:29] satan's kingdom down
[59:35] we recognize we have battle after battle
[59:37] you come out of one
[59:39] you're getting ready to go into another
[59:40] one
[59:42] constantly on a roller coaster of
[59:43] battles it'll make you recognize that
[59:45] you're in a war and just because you get
[59:48] knocked down or maybe you lose a battle
[59:50] here or there doesn't mean that you lost
[59:52] the war
[59:53] because i got a great big general that
[59:54] is here to make sure
[59:56] that you don't lose this war matter of
[59:58] fact let me tell you ain't no way you
[1:00:00] can lose
[1:00:02] with the god that's on your side and the
[1:00:04] god that's fighting your battles there's
[1:00:06] no way in hell that you could lose
[1:00:10] there ain't one devil lined up
[1:00:11] throughout all the hell that could stand
[1:00:13] up against the church of the living god
[1:00:15] that's why i said there ain't no way in
[1:00:17] hell hell's trying to devise every
[1:00:19] tactic every plan there ain't no way in
[1:00:23] hell that you can stand and lose
[1:00:27] hallelujah
[1:00:29] but there is all the way in heaven away
[1:00:32] prepared for the people and jesus said i
[1:00:35] am that way i am that truth i am that
[1:00:38] life
[1:00:48] you are the embodiment of this truth
[1:00:51] it ain't just it ain't just sitting on
[1:00:53] bibles you've heard me say it before it
[1:00:54] ain't just about sitting on the bible it
[1:00:56] ain't just about having the books lined
[1:00:58] up on your shelf having the pictures on
[1:01:00] your wall you can have hoffman's head of
[1:01:02] christ recognized throughout your whole
[1:01:04] entire house but if you ain't got the
[1:01:06] life
[1:01:07] of this word living on the inside of you
[1:01:09] you can know every word of it but not
[1:01:11] have the life
[1:01:12] because it is the word the word the
[1:01:14] letter killeth but the spirit that gives
[1:01:16] life
[1:01:17] is that right
[1:01:19] so we recognize that there's a people in
[1:01:21] the land again today that are under
[1:01:23] their messenger that'll be the final
[1:01:24] voice to the final age and they are the
[1:01:27] embodiment of that truth and there is an
[1:01:30] enemy that is trying to thwart your
[1:01:32] position
[1:01:34] so let me let me let me just drop this
[1:01:36] right here satan is not afraid of you as
[1:01:37] a person
[1:01:39] he's not afraid of your flesh
[1:01:41] he he matter of fact he's got rights to
[1:01:44] touch your flesh he's got rights to get
[1:01:46] in your mind because that's where the
[1:01:48] battle's at because you see in the flesh
[1:01:50] you're subject to him he'll make you
[1:01:52] sick and you'll get healed and you'll
[1:01:53] get sick again you're subject to him in
[1:01:56] the flesh as a mere man you become
[1:01:59] subject to the devil and try he makes

[1:02:29] bow down to the name of jesus
[1:02:32] christ i'm not his slave but i'm gonna
[1:02:36] make him a slave every day of my life
[1:02:45] he ain't got some pitchfork in his hand
[1:02:47] he ain't got some long tail except for
[1:02:49] the tail that comes out of his mouth
[1:02:53] that's detailed how he deceived all of
[1:02:55] the angels there that was in heaven it
[1:02:57] was a tail brother branham's head it was
[1:02:59] a tail that came out of his mouth
[1:03:02] but you got to recognize him real
[1:03:04] brother branham would say he said he
[1:03:06] said it's not the farmer
[1:03:08] with him oh hillbilly with him oh
[1:03:09] hillbilly help me out brother josh
[1:03:13] suppenders

[1:03:20] that's working out in the field that old
[1:03:22] farmer he said that's not the guy that

[1:03:25] that's all slicker he's the guy that you
[1:03:28] got to watch around your life
[1:03:31] oh come on somebody
[1:03:33] now i'd say probably nowadays you got
[1:03:35] some farmers that are trying to slick
[1:03:37] them ways into certain things but let me
[1:03:39] say this it's the enemy it's the enemy
[1:03:42] that tries to slick his way in and try
[1:03:44] to give you a religion that is so close
[1:03:48] well they serve god down there on the
[1:03:49] street they raise their hands just like
[1:03:51] they do down here they worship god just
[1:03:54] like they worship down there they say
[1:03:56] jesus name when they baptize they see
[1:03:59] this that or the other but they're
[1:04:00] missing one word
[1:04:07] and he slicked his way in and he's tried
[1:04:10] to bring his cold formal ideas right
[1:04:13] into the message
[1:04:17] and tell you that if you if you love god
[1:04:19] you can do anything you want to you
[1:04:21] better watch out you're dealing with the
[1:04:23] devil
[1:04:24] [Applause]
[1:04:26] is that right
[1:04:28] am i on basis tonight am i right on
[1:04:30] point it's the enemy that wants to come
[1:04:32] in and offer you well let's just worship
[1:04:34] and we don't need the preaching of the
[1:04:36] word
[1:04:37] that's the devil that you're dealing
[1:04:39] with
[1:04:40] well there's a devil that likes to walk
[1:04:42] around the message and said well the
[1:04:44] days of miracles has gone by prayer
[1:04:46] lines have gone by healings are gone by
[1:04:49] that's a devil that you're dealing with
[1:04:51] you have just recognized there is an
[1:04:53] enemy in your camp and the only way to
[1:04:56] get that enemy out the camp is to take
[1:04:58] the word of god to him
[1:05:03] when the bible tells us in revelations
[1:05:06] 12 that there was war in heaven verse 7
[1:05:10] and michael and his angels fought
[1:05:11] against the dragon and the dragon fought
[1:05:14] with his angels so we recognize that
[1:05:17] there's opposition
[1:05:18] between michael and his angels and the
[1:05:20] dragon and his angels and brother
[1:05:22] branham said in the greatest battle ever
[1:05:24] fought he said this great battle that
[1:05:26] that that was ever fought began in
[1:05:28] heaven when michael and his angels
[1:05:30] fought against lucifer and his angels it
[1:05:33] first started the first battle was in
[1:05:34] heaven so sin did not originate on earth
[1:05:37] it originated in heaven
[1:05:40] he said and then it was thrown down from
[1:05:42] heaven cast out of heaven to the earth
[1:05:45] and fell on human beings he said then
[1:05:48] the battle
[1:05:49] the battle from angels become human
[1:05:52] battles
[1:05:54] and satan come to destroy god's creation
[1:05:57] what god had created to be for himself
[1:05:59] he had satan come to destroy this he
[1:06:02] said that's what his purpose was was to
[1:06:04] destroy it he said and then the battle
[1:06:06] began here on earth and began in us and
[1:06:08] it's been raging ever since
[1:06:11] and you'll remember that's right in line
[1:06:13] with ephesians chapter 6 that we're not
[1:06:16] warring against flesh and blood
[1:06:18] but we're warring against principalities
[1:06:20] and powers and rulers of high places in
[1:06:24] darkness
[1:06:25] but if you'll read revelations 12 and 8
[1:06:28] it says and they prevailed not neither
[1:06:31] was their place
[1:06:33] [Music]
[1:06:35] the dragon
[1:06:37] and his angels their place was found
[1:06:40] anymore in heaven
[1:06:44] that ought to make you shout right there
[1:06:46] the place where you're going there ain't
[1:06:48] no devil there
[1:06:50] there ain't no beast there they ain't no
[1:06:52] liars there there ain't no torment
[1:06:55] spirits there
[1:06:56] their place was not found in heaven
[1:07:01] but if you can read over in revelations
[1:07:02] 19 you'll find your place there
[1:07:05] you'll watch where the word of god came
[1:07:06] out of the out of the one that was
[1:07:08] riding on that horse you watch where it
[1:07:10] came out of it came out of his mouth
[1:07:14] what came down in the prophet's hand in
[1:07:16] this day the king's sword
[1:07:19] the king sword came down and this what
[1:07:21] is the third pole it's the opening of
[1:07:24] the word and when a people start lining
[1:07:26] up
[1:07:27] with what the word said what the word
[1:07:30] calls for us to do you may not commit
[1:07:32] you may not create squirrels you may not
[1:07:35] create life in a little fishy but
[1:07:37] there'll be somebody that'll rise up and
[1:07:39] take this third pole right onto the
[1:07:41] coming of the lord and live and overcome
[1:07:44] in life
[1:07:48] i don't care if i create a squirrel i
[1:07:50] don't care if i cast out a tumor i don't
[1:07:52] care if i speak to a storm let me live a
[1:07:54] life let me live a life lord jesus take
[1:07:58] this third pole and live the life of
[1:08:01] jesus christ so close that he can't
[1:08:04] leave me here
[1:08:08] [Applause]
[1:08:13] oh
[1:08:16] well brother adams would tell us
[1:08:17] in the greatest battle ever fought
[1:08:20] young people if you ain't listen to it
[1:08:22] go listen to it study it
[1:08:25] it'll help you get through your your
[1:08:27] christian walk as a young person greatly
[1:08:30] he said but he said in any battle he
[1:08:32] said there's got to be a choosing place
[1:08:34] he said in world war 1 and world war ii
[1:08:36] he said they chose that no man's land
[1:08:38] and they went out there and fought on it
[1:08:40] he said but god had chose the heart he
[1:08:42] said but satan chose the mind he said
[1:08:45] and that's where the battle begins he
[1:08:48] doesn't say that's where it ends at he
[1:08:50] said that's where it is that's where it
[1:08:52] begins at you see he's wanting he's
[1:08:55] wanting to start in your mind and war
[1:08:57] with you in your flesh and give you
[1:08:59] worry and worry causes cancer he starts
[1:09:02] in your mind and moves his way down into
[1:09:04] the body
[1:09:07] what is he trying to do
[1:09:09] he's trying to steal the house that you
[1:09:12] were built to be the house of god
[1:09:16] he starts in the mine and he rolls in
[1:09:19] there with temptations of the mind he
[1:09:21] rolls in there with all kinds of
[1:09:22] complexes and stigmas and people talking
[1:09:25] about you and people saying all kinds of
[1:09:27] things about you and he tries to roll in
[1:09:29] there and tries to give you a
[1:09:32] disease of spiritual amnesia he tries to
[1:09:36] roll in there and give you all kinds of
[1:09:39] ideas to make you not believe that this
[1:09:42] is the truth
[1:09:44] that's where it begins at
[1:09:46] but i love what paul would say in the
[1:09:49] letter to the philippians in foreign aid
[1:09:51] he said finally my brethren whatsoever
[1:09:54] things are pure whatsoever things are
[1:09:56] honest whatsoever things are holy
[1:09:58] whatsoever things are just if there be
[1:10:01] any virtue if there be any praise to
[1:10:03] think on these things
[1:10:06] there ain't one thing just about the
[1:10:08] devil there ain't one thing holy about
[1:10:10] the devil there ain't one thing pure
[1:10:12] about the devil but there is something
[1:10:14] honest and pure and lovely and great
[1:10:17] there is virtue in the lord jesus christ
[1:10:19] and satan don't want you thinking about
[1:10:21] what god did for you he don't want you
[1:10:23] thinking how god loved you he don't want
[1:10:26] you thinking about how he's had you how
[1:10:28] he picked you up out of the mirey clay
[1:10:30] he don't want you thinking about
[1:10:31] praising him and glorifying him for
[1:10:34] reaching down his hands and picking you
[1:10:36] up he don't want you thinking about that
[1:10:38] he because you recognize when you start
[1:10:41] recognizing the god that's on your side
[1:10:43] you'll start recognizing the devil
[1:10:45] that's against you
[1:10:49] oh if there's going to be something
[1:10:50] we're going to think on let's think on
[1:10:51] the word of god
[1:10:54] it's the only thing of rest it's the
[1:10:56] only place of security in this hour is
[1:10:59] to rest in the very word of god
[1:11:05] you see
[1:11:06] you see the further and further
[1:11:08] that you get away from satan's reach the
[1:11:12] more he recognizes
[1:11:14] that you are a real son and daughter of
[1:11:16] god
[1:11:19] he got you close to the walls one time
[1:11:22] he tried to bring out there was some
[1:11:24] kind of lie
[1:11:25] he tried to bring you out there with
[1:11:26] some kind of dirty website and all kinds
[1:11:28] of deadly things he tried to bring you
[1:11:31] out there close to the wall but there
[1:11:32] was somebody on the inside
[1:11:34] said get back on in here you're not safe
[1:11:37] out there you're not safe out there in
[1:11:39] laodicea young people you're not safe on
[1:11:41] those phones you're not safe on those
[1:11:44] websites you're not safe on social media
[1:11:47] get back in here
[1:11:48] you're my children you get back in here
[1:11:51] that's why it's got preachers that stand
[1:11:53] up in the pulpit today and preach the
[1:11:55] truth saying get back in life get back
[1:11:58] away from the walls so the enemy can't
[1:12:01] touch you
[1:12:02] there's going to be somebody that'll
[1:12:04] listen to the voice of resurrection they
[1:12:07] won't stand near the wall just so close
[1:12:09] that they can get by they'll get back in
[1:12:11] there so close to god
[1:12:14] that shaking can't touch a hair on his
[1:12:16] head until he gets permission from my
[1:12:19] father
[1:12:32] daniel
[1:12:33] in daniel chapter 10 i ain't gonna read
[1:12:35] it to y'all tonight
[1:12:36] it'll take too long and ain't got enough
[1:12:38] time to read it to you but the bible
[1:12:40] tells us in daniel chapter 10 that
[1:12:42] you'll find that there daniel
[1:12:44] there he was
[1:12:46] in persia there with cyrus the king and
[1:12:48] there he was and he the bible said that
[1:12:50] daniel was mourning
[1:12:52] for three weeks
[1:12:55] because of the things that he was seeing
[1:12:56] and the things that was going on daniel
[1:12:58] was mourning all of those days
[1:13:01] but there daniel was praying
[1:13:06] daniel was praying
[1:13:07] those twenty and one days daniel begin
[1:13:10] to pray
[1:13:12] you recognize that what you're facing
[1:13:14] tonight is the very prince of persia
[1:13:18] that is the prince of the power of the
[1:13:20] air that is trying to stop you from
[1:13:23] getting to a heavenly atmosphere
[1:13:27] is that right
[1:13:28] he's trying to stop your prayers he's
[1:13:31] trying to stop your breakthrough he's
[1:13:33] trying to stop you from getting all the
[1:13:34] way to god he's trying with everything
[1:13:36] that was in his might but the bible
[1:13:39] tells us that daniel began to pray he
[1:13:42] prayed on one day he prayed on the
[1:13:44] second day he prayed all the way through
[1:13:47] the first week but still there wasn't no
[1:13:49] answer he prayed through the second week
[1:13:51] and there still wasn't no answer but
[1:13:53] daniel was a man that had purposed in
[1:13:55] his heart
[1:13:57] that he would not defile himself with
[1:13:59] the king's land and the king's meat but
[1:14:01] daniel stayed there
[1:14:04] now you're gonna face some devils you're
[1:14:06] gonna face sometimes in your life when
[1:14:08] there's storms over you and it looks
[1:14:10] like all of heaven is shut off
[1:14:14] but that ain't time to give up that's a
[1:14:16] time to keep praying
[1:14:18] that's a time to stand there like daniel
[1:14:20] and said satan you can stop me or you
[1:14:23] can try to stop me all you want to but
[1:14:26] i'm going to keep on praying
[1:14:28] [Applause]
[1:14:36] there's power in your prayer
[1:14:38] and you think well i've done prayed this
[1:14:40] thing one time and i done prayed it i
[1:14:42] hadn't prayed it over my children i
[1:14:44] didn't prayed it over my family i hadn't
[1:14:46] prayed it over my pastor i've done
[1:14:48] prayed this what's the purpose in
[1:14:49] praying pray
[1:14:51] pray like you've never prayed for for
[1:14:53] and pray and recognize you're not
[1:14:55] talking to some weak god you're talking
[1:14:58] to the god of heaven when you're bowing
[1:15:00] on your knees you're not talking to some
[1:15:03] weak angel you're talking to a mighty
[1:15:05] angel
[1:15:06] when you're praying i want you to know
[1:15:08] there's so much power in a believer's
[1:15:10] prayer that hezekiah prayed one time and
[1:15:13] he shut down all of the assyrians and
[1:15:16] one angel came and smote
[1:15:18] 185 000 assyrians
[1:15:22] hezekiah knew how to pray
[1:15:24] he prayed one time when the prophet came
[1:15:26] to him and said make yourself ready
[1:15:29] you're about to die but hezekiah knowing
[1:15:32] how to pray turned his face towards a
[1:15:35] wall and begin to weep and call out to
[1:15:37] god brother branham said he asked for 15
[1:15:40] more years and god heard his prayer
[1:15:43] i want you to know your prayer changes
[1:15:45] the very mind of god
[1:15:47] there the prophet walked in and told him
[1:15:49] get ready to die and then the prophet
[1:15:51] before he ever got out the city said
[1:15:53] let's go back up there and talk to
[1:15:55] hezekiah
[1:15:58] and you've been sitting here saying i've
[1:15:59] said this same prayer over and over and
[1:16:02] over again let me give you the example
[1:16:05] daniel daniel prayed for 21 days
[1:16:09] and when the angel showed up he said i
[1:16:12] am come for thy words
[1:16:19] he didn't come for shadrach's words
[1:16:20] there he didn't come from meshach's
[1:16:22] words there he didn't come for a
[1:16:24] bendigo's words there daniel was the one
[1:16:26] in the fight
[1:16:27] you're the one in the fight you're the
[1:16:29] one that's got to pray you're the one
[1:16:31] that's got a call on god god if you're
[1:16:33] still god let your power show and
[1:16:36] vindicate that you can still save the
[1:16:38] loss
[1:16:40] you can still heal the body
[1:16:44] and the angel said
[1:16:48] the prince of persia
[1:16:49] he withstood me these 21 days but
[1:16:52] michael
[1:16:54] but michael came
[1:16:56] and helped me
[1:16:58] i want you to know christ has come into
[1:16:59] your situation to help you out of your
[1:17:01] midst of trouble
[1:17:05] michael which is christ in angelic form
[1:17:08] is showing up because of your prayers
[1:17:11] because of your commitment to god
[1:17:13] i'm not going to give up i'm not going
[1:17:15] to back off my prayer life i'm not going
[1:17:17] to back off my praise i'm not going to
[1:17:19] back off my worship
[1:17:21] it's an enemy that's trying to stop that
[1:17:23] but daniel kept praying it's the same
[1:17:26] thing with those two women that came
[1:17:28] into that meeting they came there one
[1:17:31] with the stomach trouble one with the
[1:17:32] garter and six weeks later the angel
[1:17:36] passed through the neighborhood when the
[1:17:38] one's daughter said mama you're bringing
[1:17:40] a reproach against christianity but she
[1:17:42] said i'm healed by his stripes
[1:17:45] it was the same thing and the same
[1:17:47] commitment that daniel had and one day
[1:17:50] she was there and said hey my little
[1:17:52] children have left some oatmeal here
[1:17:54] that just tears my belly up
[1:17:58] but i'm going to eat this in the name of
[1:17:59] jesus christ and before long she moved
[1:18:02] over to the next course and before long
[1:18:04] she ran down the road ran down the
[1:18:06] avenue and said hey i've been eating all
[1:18:09] morning she said i'm here shaking the
[1:18:11] sheets trying to find this order it was
[1:18:13] because somebody refused to give in and
[1:18:16] refused to give up
[1:18:23] what is satan wanting you to do he's
[1:18:25] wanting you to surrender your rights as
[1:18:27] a christian to him
[1:18:30] he's wanting to make you think
[1:18:32] that you're not strong enough
[1:18:34] that you're not a bit you don't have the
[1:18:36] ability
[1:18:37] to win this
[1:18:39] the enemy just wants you to roll over
[1:18:42] and give up
[1:18:45] if that's you
[1:18:46] stop playing possum because i know you
[1:18:48] ain't dead
[1:18:54] is that right
[1:18:57] you see some christians they get that
[1:18:59] possum idea about them whenever the
[1:19:01] enemy comes close
[1:19:02] they get in the headlights and they just
[1:19:04] roll over and act dead
[1:19:05] oh don't let them see me
[1:19:07] he's close i can feel him his old nasty
[1:19:09] breath breathing down on me and you roll
[1:19:11] over why don't you roll back over and
[1:19:13] bite him
[1:19:19] just start gnawing at that
[1:19:20] devil so back up
[1:19:23] i ain't some dead possum i ain't some
[1:19:26] dead church of christ i ain't some dead
[1:19:28] methodist
[1:19:29] i'm the church of the living god
[1:19:35] let me move on
[1:19:40] this is the hour
[1:19:41] of the overcomer
[1:19:43] brother and said it overcome means to
[1:19:45] recognize the devil in every one of his
[1:19:48] tricks
[1:19:50] to recognize the devil in every one of
[1:19:53] his tricks he said a lot of people says
[1:19:55] there is no devil
[1:19:56] it's just a thought don't you believe
[1:19:57] that there's a real devil he's just as
[1:19:59] real as you or anybody a real devil and
[1:20:02] you must recognize him
[1:20:05] real
[1:20:06] you must know he's the devil then the
[1:20:08] same time that you recognize him and
[1:20:11] know that he's a devil and he's against
[1:20:13] you then to overcome you must recognize
[1:20:19] that the god in you is greater and
[1:20:22] mightier than he is that the one that's
[1:20:24] in you has already overcame him and by
[1:20:27] his grace bow his grasp by his grace
[1:20:31] by his grace that'll make you how to
[1:20:33] make a clip for somebody go ahead make
[1:20:35] fun of me
[1:20:36] as long as you're making fun of me
[1:20:38] you're leaving somebody else alone
[1:20:41] and by his grace you are more than a
[1:20:43] match for him amen there's a real
[1:20:46] overcoming when you recognize he said
[1:20:49] you look back and you say well i'm doing
[1:20:51] this i'm doing that he said then you're
[1:20:53] defeated he said but there's no
[1:20:55] condemnation to them which are in christ
[1:20:58] jesus that walk not after the flesh but
[1:21:00] after the spirit he said then you
[1:21:02] realize that you've overcome and you
[1:21:04] know that he's a devil
[1:21:06] now watch this he said you can't say i
[1:21:10] got a sickness i don't believe it is a
[1:21:12] sickness
[1:21:14] oh yes it is a sickness
[1:21:18] you got cancer oh you don't you don't
[1:21:20] believe it is a cancer he said it is a
[1:21:23] cancer it is a cancer but remember
[1:21:27] if we're going to remember one thing
[1:21:29] this is what we got to remember that
[1:21:31] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:21:34] that is in the world you must realize
[1:21:37] that the holy spirit that's in you has
[1:21:39] already overcome this thing and he's in
[1:21:42] you and you can overcome by him
[1:21:46] this is the hour of the overcomer and
[1:21:48] it's recognizing the devil in every one
[1:21:50] of his tricks but it's realizing that
[1:21:52] the god that's on the inside of you
[1:21:56] let me tell you they ain't no problem
[1:21:57] that's too big that's bigger than my
[1:22:00] jesus you can line up every problem that
[1:22:02] you got in this building tonight and it
[1:22:04] still ain't bigger than jesus
[1:22:07] let me say this to you that the house
[1:22:09] that you're living in is not single
[1:22:11] occupancy
[1:22:15] anybody catching my drift tonight
[1:22:18] the house that you're living in is not
[1:22:19] single occupancy but it is a duel a dual
[1:22:23] dwelling place
[1:22:25] as somebody
[1:22:26] hey somebody they might there might be
[1:22:28] times in your life when you're weak and
[1:22:30] you're frail and there may be times in
[1:22:32] your life when you feel stronger than
[1:22:34] others but there's a guy that's living
[1:22:36] on the inside of the house with you he
[1:22:38] ain't never weak he never gave up he
[1:22:41] never lost the battle the guy that's
[1:22:43] living on the inside of this house it's
[1:22:45] greater is he that is in me than he
[1:22:48] that's in the world
[1:22:56] if you're sealed until the day of your
[1:22:57] redemption it doesn't matter how you
[1:22:59] feel it doesn't matter what emotion you
[1:23:01] feel it doesn't matter whether you feel
[1:23:03] right or lit your lord doing all kinds
[1:23:06] of things and it feels like you're not a
[1:23:08] christian no more and satan's pouring
[1:23:10] everything on you to make you think that
[1:23:12] you're not living right but if you're
[1:23:14] sealed until the day of your redemption
[1:23:16] you can have mind battle after mind
[1:23:18] battle war after war but if you're
[1:23:20] sealed until the day of your redemption
[1:23:23] you've already received the earnest
[1:23:25] which is the down payment to get you out
[1:23:28] of this chaos
[1:23:35] hallelujah
[1:23:36] you love the lord
[1:23:40] brother branham he's
[1:23:41] he's dealing with a
[1:23:43] he's dealing with a patient
[1:23:45] and he said how'd he do sir he said he
[1:23:48] said now there's something strange about
[1:23:49] you sir
[1:23:51] he said satan has desired to take your
[1:23:54] life
[1:23:55] he said you're all tore up and you think
[1:23:57] you've sinned away your day of grace
[1:23:59] you think your life is ruined
[1:24:03] then he asked him this
[1:24:05] simple but very powerful question
[1:24:08] he said do you love jesus
[1:24:14] do you love jesus
[1:24:18] satan's trying to kill you
[1:24:20] he's trying to make you think he's
[1:24:22] trying to make you think that you send
[1:24:24] away your day of grace but do you love
[1:24:27] jesus
[1:24:31] we got young people all around this
[1:24:33] message that satan has lied on
[1:24:37] that satan's tried to steal and to kill
[1:24:39] and destroy
[1:24:40] by his lies
[1:24:44] but do you love jesus
[1:24:49] i'm gonna tell you something that's
[1:24:50] something powerful about loving jesus
[1:24:54] it's about falling in love with him if
[1:24:56] you fall in love with him let me tell
[1:24:58] you you might fall in love and out of
[1:25:00] love with people of the world and
[1:25:01] boyfriends and girlfriends but if you
[1:25:03] really fall in love with jesus you can't
[1:25:06] fall out of love with him
[1:25:09] do you love jesus
[1:25:12] do you love jesus
[1:25:18] what makes you love him
[1:25:20] he said before there could ever be
[1:25:22] anything to there to make you love him
[1:25:25] there has got to be a creator to create
[1:25:28] the love in your heart
[1:25:31] are you listening
[1:25:32] is that right he said if you'd send away
[1:25:35] your day of grace you would hate jesus
[1:25:39] but you love him
[1:25:43] and you're all right
[1:25:48] hallelujah
[1:25:50] and you're all right and the devil's
[1:25:52] just lying to you you're nervous come
[1:25:55] here and i'll cast them away for you if
[1:25:57] you'll believe do you believe it bow
[1:25:59] your head and keep your heads bowed
[1:26:01] everyone until you hear me say raise up
[1:26:03] he said this is demonology he said
[1:26:05] almighty god be merciful to the boy he
[1:26:08] stands here and satan trying to get him
[1:26:10] to to get in this condition to commit
[1:26:12] suicide but thou art here to relieve the
[1:26:16] boy and to make this evil spirit go and
[1:26:19] now has said that these signs shall
[1:26:22] follow them that believe in my name
[1:26:24] shall they cast out devils then upon the
[1:26:26] authority of god's word as a believer i
[1:26:29] now ask
[1:26:31] the spirit that's on the boy of unbelief
[1:26:37] he didn't call out suicide he didn't
[1:26:39] call out depression he called out
[1:26:41] unbelief
[1:26:47] the spirit that's on the boy of unbelief
[1:26:50] to leave him
[1:26:51] go out in the name of jesus christ and
[1:26:54] bother him no more i set him free and
[1:26:58] may the enemy be bound and leave this
[1:27:00] room and torment no one else in jesus
[1:27:04] christ's name
[1:27:07] i want you to know this
[1:27:08] once you recognize the power of the name
[1:27:10] of jesus christ you have recognized that
[1:27:13] your enemy is defenseless
[1:27:16] [Music]
[1:27:17] if you can recognize how much power is
[1:27:19] in the name of god the name of jesus
[1:27:23] christ your enemy cannot whip you he can
[1:27:26] try to whip you every which way until he
[1:27:28] comes to that name
[1:27:31] the name of jesus christ is the highest
[1:27:33] name in heaven and in earth and there's
[1:27:36] no other name where men should be saved
[1:27:39] but by the name of jesus
[1:27:46] you watch
[1:27:47] you've heard me say this
[1:27:49] let me let me say this real quick
[1:27:53] musicians can come
[1:27:54] i'm closing
[1:28:00] you watch an eagle
[1:28:02] you've heard it before you maybe seen it
[1:28:03] before but you watch an eagle that's
[1:28:05] going up against a fight
[1:28:07] against a deadly snake
[1:28:09] that eagle
[1:28:10] has got to change the
[1:28:12] battle he's got to change the battle
[1:28:15] because on the ground
[1:28:17] that snake can whip him that rattlesnake
[1:28:19] or that viper can whoop him right there
[1:28:21] because that's where he's strong at
[1:28:24] but eagle has to take that snake into
[1:28:26] another atmosphere
[1:28:28] and when he gets him into another
[1:28:29] atmosphere when he gets him all the way
[1:28:32] up there he'll drop him from the sky and
[1:28:34] when he gets floating through the air
[1:28:36] he's defenseless he can't strike he
[1:28:38] can't bite at you so let me say this
[1:28:41] eagles the enemy that's come in to give
[1:28:43] you a snake bite is to tell you this
[1:28:46] word of the lord is to tell you to take
[1:28:48] your enemy into an atmosphere
[1:28:51] where the enemy is defenseless he's
[1:28:53] weakless he's weak and he cannot beat
[1:28:56] you he cannot destroy you if you can
[1:28:59] ever recognize your enemy who he is what
[1:29:02] he is and how he's trying to rob you
[1:29:04] from god's inheritance
[1:29:06] take him into the atmosphere of praise
[1:29:08] one time and watch what you do with him
[1:29:12] take him into the atmosphere of prayer
[1:29:14] one time and watch how he loses his
[1:29:16] power take him into the atmosphere of
[1:29:18] worship one time and watch how he can't
[1:29:20] bite at you
[1:29:22] take him into the atmosphere of the word
[1:29:24] young people and you'll watch
[1:29:26] satan can't handle you there
[1:29:28] and he loses his power to strike at you
