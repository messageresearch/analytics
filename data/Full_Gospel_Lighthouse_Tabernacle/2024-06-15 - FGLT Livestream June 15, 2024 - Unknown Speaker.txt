amen a thought hit me this morning early and and uh I get up kind of early and it just hit me and I tell you what I thought I was going to have a dancing party and um I thought about some of you were already in your cars making your way to church today and I said Lord send a baptism a fire in their Vans and their trucks and and Lord and when they get here let them be ready to have church and so amen amen I come to get what I what I came for amen God bless you now this scripture pertains to you there's some that pertain to other people but this one pertains to you so I want you to help me read it today okay and so as I read you read okay behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment and in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality and when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption this Mortal shall have put on immortality and then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ let's read this last verse together with power therefore my beloved Brethren be you steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord amen God bless you you can be seated we're very much aware that we're influenced from another world that's quite a statement isn't it and we realize that this message is advancing us progressively toward a body change and we're moving into another realm the world doesn't realize that but I'd like to just capture a couple of in last ages of things that happen if we could imagine John Wesley 5 foot one redheaded I'm always having affinity for him and he's speaking with such power and anointing and it becomes so powerful he's not in a church but he's in a open field 10,000 people are slain in the spirit in an open field he didn't quite understand what it was all about but he knew that there was an influence from another realm that was happening as a matter of fact John Wesley was preaching and with such power the people were just so slain and he himself was going out trying to get them to set up and listen he would try to raise them up what I've got to say is important but it was so powerful another place he's preaching and a huge crowd of people is there and a hail storm comes and he tells them leave you got to go home this storm is too bad and they just kept screaming we refuse to go home we love what is being said hallu it must shake the devil Charles feny who was a lawyer and became a preacher he got the Holy Ghost and he was ashamed at first but he got the Holy Ghost and and then God would so anoint him Rochester New York would become the place to where that he would preach there and would preach with such anointing until men would drop their lunch pales five miles away and give their hearts to Jesus Christ there was such an anointing under his preaching until the police didn't have a job to do and so they became the original barbershop quartets Jail's emptied Hallelujah the influence is just not in the pull pit but it has incredible results the scripture says in Hebrews chap 11:8 by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in a Land Of Promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city notice these words for he looked for a city which had foundations whose Builder and maker is God you're looking for a city aren't you through faith also Sarah received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised therefore spring even one of one and and in an him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in the multitude as the sand which were by the seashore innumerable quite a statement you're in that scripture these all died in faith having received the promises but having them AAR off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confess that they were strangers and pilgrims on the Earth and they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they have been mindful of that country from when they came out that they might had opportunity to have returned but notice these next words but now they desire a better country that is a Heavenly whereof God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared for them a city and by faith when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promise offered up his only begotten son of whom it is said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called AC accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead when went also he received him a in a figure I'd like to just just kind of lay out some ground thoughts this morning we are citizens of another world this is only a temporary place we stepped out of Eternity into time and we'll Fellowship here in this natural realm and there's a lot of things that you will go through but we will never be comfortable in this world let's just go ahead and get that settled we will never be comfortable in this world we are being pulled by the message of the hour into another dimension Jesus would declare I go to prepare for you a place that where I am there you may be also amen aren't you glad of that now now listen Abraham was looking for a city whose Builder and maker was God and there's a reason why that he was looking for a city he met the king of that City that King came to his home and sat with him he called him God he called him Lord he had been talking to him from another dimension he heard his voice many conversations that God had with with Abraham and we could go through it and spend days on it I I am your buckler I am your Shield I am your reward and he constantly told him that he had a covenant with Abraham and Abraham would go home and no doubt tell his family about he had been fellowshipping with a with a voice he had been in the spirit and it was beyond anything that he could comprehend but God was establishing a covenant with him amen not a thousand people with him and with his seed that he did not have and when God came and visited with him he came and he didn't have a father or a mother and he was not from a local city or a local town but but the voice that was in that body he had been listening to that's right so all the questions were taken care of and he be to make him a promise that there was going to come seed through Sarah and then he asked where Sarah was at knowing where she was at and he asked Sarah a question and I want to ask you this question is the there anything is there anything impossible with god brother Ron but we've had the message all of these years that's true but we have been fellowshipping with the voice that brought the message we have met the king you have felt him sweep through this audience and audiences all around the world our Prophet had to leave us and every message was orchestrated it was Way Beyond the voice of a man we understand that but that presence that is Among Us that's him that's the mighty angel from another world that's the world that we're fellowshipping with and we leave the W merch and we leave leave our jobs when we come to church and then we begin to be pulled into another realm one day we'll never leave that other [Applause] realm the scripture Bears out that Jesus walked in Two Worlds at the same time brother Brandon would explain to us and he would say it in many different I don't have time this morning but he would say it and I just want to give you a couple examples brother brandom said you know I'm standing in Two Worlds at the same time I'm searching for her spirit just now a woman named Mary dies in the service and he turns to Billy and says go pray for it no Daddy no Daddy brother R steps out but behind the pull pit he said just a moment I'm searching for her spirit she had passed from this Dimension and was going to another dimension and he began to look for her transport and he found her and then he called her by name didn't know her excuse me he didn't know her and he said Mary and she set right up yes brother Brandon yes brother brandom let me just say don't be scared of death it's an Uber now listen the world can be scared of death but the Bride of Jesus Christ has no right to be scared of death don't let death haunt you let me just say even standing where I'm at I don't go to bed in fear will I die during the night I know what the doctor says there's not a they say just enjoy every day on all of that I'm not scared of death because I'm one breath here and I'm another breath there one one breath I'm shaking your hand and another breath I'm shaking brother Homer's hand Hallelujah [Applause] patient standing there you have a nerves condition and he just pauses I see you 40 years ago get off a school bus and a dog chases you down the road and what's he doing he's here he's here in this Dimension he's with her and in another world he's going 40 years ago he's watching her now the people can't see that happening but he's going in her life now I'm catching you just hang with me and in just a moment he goes in her future and he says you're well yeah you're well so not just as declare you're here with this nervous condition but in just a few moments and in her future you're well you'll not fool with this you'll not suffer with this condition anymore how many did that happen oh but that was with brother brandom how many times do you said in these Services let's just preach how many times have we sit in these services and you're sitting there and you become aware that there's 300 people that have been gathered but now you're sitting on the stage and your life is being described and all of a sudden you're sitting there and and and you know he goes back 20 years or goes back 10 years he goes back to a spot in your life and he pulls that out and then he points you in the future and it's just a few service a few sentences of a service Two Worlds a man called me this week from last week's service and he suffers from pancreas cancer and it's encased his pancreas he hadn't told his family he's a nurse he had not told his family that that the reading in his in his worksheet had give him two and a half months to live and he said I didn't want to tell my family and he was just sharing this from one patient to another and he said 'I I really thought about calling you brother Ron he said what it would mean and he said I thought this would bring great courage to you and he said I had not I had not shared it with another soul and I was holding this and I was dealing with it and he said I got two more cancer treatments and he said I know you have quite a Entourage of people that take care of you and watch after you and and you take chemo every day he said I've just got two more treatments and you'll take it the rest of your life and he said he said but I he said I actually walked through the prayer line for another need he said I didn't even have it on my heart and he said when I walked past you he said I know you didn't you didn't pick up of who I was he said I know that he said' I saw the look and I honestly didn't and he said you spoke life life to me and he said all the fear that I had about two and a half months all the fear that I had that I couldn't tell my family he said every bit of that was released in a second to Two Worlds yeah Two Worlds at the same time colliding now I I think about this how that God is Transforming Our Lives to prepare for that next World now I'm going to be delicate with this and I I I I know we have people from different communities and and and many people vacation to go to the Amish community to look at the lifestyle but they really don't see the bondage am am I right am I am I right am I right [Applause] they enjoy the food and they enjoy people from the world enjoy the food and they enjoy people working in the fields but they can't see they can't see the inner bondage that has happened but God is saying let there be light [Applause] and I want to say this to you and I want to say especially to this audience I have been praying for years cuz I vacationed there an incredible amount brother Homer is his favorite place to go but I have prayed for years how can we reach them I want to say to you welcome [Applause] home welcome home [Applause] you have not jumped from one frying pan to another frying pan you have not jumped from one dictatorship to another dictatorship you have not jumped from one bondage to another bondage you have come to life life breathe it in life serving Christ is a love affair it is a love affair throw your old book of the Union of your past life away you don't need it no more breathe deeply enjoy for [Applause] life I want to just take a moment here Matthew Mark Luke and John were four of the major disciples Apostles whatever you want to link them to writers of your New Testament and the message declares something that's so real I want to make sure that you get this so I'm going to take a moment they were men on the Earth but they were anointed From Another Dimension Amen in the Book of Revelations in chapter 4 there's a there's a lion anointing there's an ox anointing all the way to the eagle anointing and each of these writers catch the spirit or the anointing from that serpant realm and the sarapin will be declared in Isaiah as the Protectors of the holies of holies they're they're beasts don't think of this as Humanity now this is another world and with six wings they did fly are you with me now and they are protectors protectors I want to just get it Protectors of the holies of holies Matthew begins to write and brother brandom comes to Matthew and he comes to 20 chapter 28 and verse 19 go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in in the name of the father and the son and of the Holy Ghost and brother brand even declares he said I wonder why he wrote it like that but he was protecting the book of Acts he was protecting the book of Acts and then Mark begins to write of the power to the believer and it was protecting the power you'll cast out Devils you'll take up serpents and it won harm them he was protecting the book of Acts John was protecting the deity of who Jesus Christ was let me just say this to you John was standing there and he didn't start when Mary conceived he goes all the way back in the beginning yes sir in the book John chapter 1 he goes back in the beginning to declare to you that Jesus is more than a man he's more than a prophet but he's God on the earth he's a messiah but he also describes it in such a way until he blinds every trinitarian I'm talking to you about influence from another world watch these writers as they start out when Peter would stand you men of Judea you crucified the Messiah and they begin to say this same Jesus it's too good I'm sorry I'm time conscious but I want to get this to you you men of Israel hear these words listen just only a few days ago he had been a coward but the influence of another world was now just not on him but it was in him listen when you receive the Holy Ghost it's not just on you it's just not on you catch this it's just not around you but Zoe God's own life is poured on the inside of you goes to the king chamber of your heart where once set another king and you lusted and you was prideful and you did bad things but the new [Applause] king you men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved among you by Miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as you of yourselves also know him being and delivered of determinant counsel knowledge for knowledge of God ye have taken and by Wicked hands have crucified and slain whom God has raised up having loose the Pains of death because it is not possible that he should be Holden of it for David speaking concerning him I forsaw the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that I should not be moved therefore did my heart heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover My Flesh was shall Rest In Hope because thou wal not leave my soul in Hell neither will I suffer thy Holy One to see corruption thou has made known to me the ways of life Thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance many Brethren let me freely speak to you of the patriarch David that is both dead and buried and as a Seer is with us until this day therefore being of a prophet knowing that God hath sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins according to his flesh he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne and he seeing before he spake of the resurrection of Christ that his soul was not left in Hell neither his flesh did see corruption now notice what he does this Jesus this Jesus has God raised up whereof we are all Witnesses therefore being by the right of the hand of God exalted and having received the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he has shed forth this which ye now see and hear for David is not ascended into the heavens but he saith unto to himself the Lord said unto my Lord sit on my right hand until I make thy foes thy foot stol therefore let all the house of Israel know ass surely that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have cr crucified both Lord and Christ now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do and Peter said unto them repent because you got to be born again and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins you revoke the jurisdiction of that that other king and he no longer has control over you no more and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for This Promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call all now now watch this but brother Ron Jesus said he did Matthew 28:19 but if you remember the influence of another world was blocking was blocking non seed from Catching it the influence from another world for 2,000 years has block nonseed from Catching it where does that put me brother Ron it puts you to the spot to that serpant that's standing there guarding that scripture there's no way you can miss it for four chapters he blocks non seed but for four chapters he opens the book and said your name is written in the book and when you read it with the Revelation in your eyes you go well how in the world could anybody miss it how can anybody miss it you don't understand there's two worlds there's two worlds at work even right now are you with me the serin is making sure Hallelujah the serpant is making sure from that realm that the seed of God is catching it now remember now I want to go back and catch a couple of things remember God knows who you are that's now I want you to catch this God knows who you are but Abraham didn't know who he was so God had to make sure that he could see what God saw in him cuz there's a lot of times in your life you don't know who you are you did your best but one day he be to Quicken things into your life and he does it individually he don't necessarily do it whole family all of a sudden you're catching it and then you find out your wife's catching it and then later on your children begin to catch it because he's a personal [Applause] God now now watch it watch a couple things I want I want to catch some things now now we're built a a Triune being and we're we've got a flesh realm and we got a spirit realm and we got a soul realm and there's inlets to your soul and inlets to your soul it's kind of like a 10-point deer and there's five antlers on one side and five on another side and see taste smell and then there's emotions and there's reasons and conscience and all of these and memories they're on the other side and there's gateways that come to your soul now now Satan is allowed to introduce from His World music and he introduces from his his world music trying to capture your emotions and then he he will come and there's try to get into your ears and then in your mind and and we're living in an age to where we're just bombarded with information there's news and there's gossip and and there's just posting all over the place and because of this is the day of people's right everybody thinks that I got a right to post my opinion to the whole world and so we you know we hear people they get up in the morning Andrew was touching it last night and he didn't know this was in my notes and so we we get up and and people are posting I got up this morning and I ate two eggs and and I and he tell how they cooked it and then I made a sandwich peanut butter and jelly sandwich and who cares I walked across the road I saw chickens walk across the road who cares and a group of rise up and they're they're actually prompted by another group and another Rich trillionaire will begin to spend money and and you'll see all these activists out doing their thing and all their signs and all these different kind of things don't even go to that school who cares what you don't see is Israel's doing what they're supposed to be doing Russia's doing what they're supposed to be doing but the bride is doing what they're supposed to do so you got to guard your soul well brother on I just got to know all those things really why don't you turn that energies into reading scriptures read the church age book and read the shal because there's nothing that let me just say this there's nothing on ABC and NBC and CBS and Fox News there's no rapturing power in none of that well I I watch the weather all the time well if you pay attention there's people that live in Tornado Alley that are out in their yards video in the storm coming who's going to have the most dangerous video instead of getting in a cover instead of getting in a in a shelter somewhere or another they're out videoing something that's going to crush their home listen we've been warned about this world by a prophet of God there's a storm coming get in the arms of Jesus Christ I I want to share something here getting quiet with Jesus is an important thing in our lives amen now you know we have saw Jesus we saw the prophet and they displayed some things and but there was something that that I think is incredible it's not necessarily thing the things that they said was so powerful it was a things that was left unsaid Jesus could have stood there and told the mysteries of the Kingdom but he held it show us a miracle but he held it are you with me sure brother brandom in that Dimension read people's heart read people's lives that was not a man did that that was God did that no man can do that no man can do that and listen even a minister that has the Insight of of of different things to be able to read people's lives if he has any ability at all the things that he says are not near as po powerful as the things that he don't say and he holds that to himself and he holds that because sometimes things that could be said would destroy lives brother Ron I need a quote brother B said if I'd see you going down the road and getting a car wreck I wouldn't tell you because every time you got in the car you would think about that are you with me are you with me brother brand would say some things and I I want to just catch you just for a moment he said my Ministry is praying for the sick and in order to do that I must come into another world that people don't know nothing about quite a statement my work another place my work is in a realm of spirits that's where I live a big part of my life is in another dimension that the world knows nothing about I speak in the name of the Lord and they don't understand there's no need of trying to explain it no way to explain it well what brother Ron what does those quotes have to do with us let me just say this to you you work with people every day on your job that have no idea idea they have no idea of the realm that you're living in they have no idea don't try to explain it to them they're interested in the race this weekend or in the baseball this weekend or or in whatever is going on this weekend what happened in politics you have no interest in it right the greatest part of your week you come into a service and you get lifted into a Heavenly realm how many's ever heard of 100 Proof Sinners sorry Sinners are you with me I want to just remind you that brother brandom was carrying water he was carrying in water to his father's steel that would intoxification let me just let me just build on that just for a moment when a man begins to drink in the natural realm and I'm glad to have Angels Among Us and when he begins to drink in the natural realm he is trying to move from this Dimension and trying to forget his Sorrows if feel even for a few moments what's in that bottle will remove the sorrows away from his life even for a temporary condition I find it amazing I find it amazing how that the devil will make you pay way more ties than God will when you were serving him you didn't mind paying $30 or $50 or whatever you paid for that bottle and so you drank it and then it came to an empty spot it didn't take away the issue the issues were still there you were sick you had just just destroyed brain cells you had made a fool out of yourself you wed on the floor you went out and wed in the streets am you lost control you did things that you're ashamed of today and then the devil will come along you're sitting in church and say remember the good old days well what's good about that [Applause] the worst fight I ever had was over brother brandom in a bar this guy called brother brandom a false prophet I didn't care if I was drunk I still believed he was a prophet I'm ashamed of that I never told the boys that until they got of age cuz I was ashamed I acted like that but I'm proud I even in that condition I fought for him do you think now at 60 years old I wouldn't fight for him today then I saw the life of my parents and other people that I knew was Christians but today it's not alcohol in my system it's the life of the influence of 100 Proof [Applause] oh but brother Ron you don't have issues now really come on really the issues that I fight would put most of you guys in a panic in 24 hours but the drunkenness that I'm on don't care about cancer don't care about sugar diabetes don't care about a heart attack [Applause] Hallelujah now but brother Ron but when we in the message we supposed to quieten down okay okay well I got a quote for you a true p a true picture of the modern church today neither does the modern church one of of these hear screaming shouting Tong speaking acts 238 young around her the modern Church don't want that she don't want any of them whooping and crying and screaming amen hallelujah why such a child would it be immediately put out of her denomination and if they had one like that in their churches they throw her out real quick why are you letting such stuff as this go on along so you see she's pregnated with something because she's bringing forth members all the time but she don't want none of these screaming hollering blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures that she thinks that they are it would certainly embarrass her it would run her educated ethical scientific Society Church that she belonged to here they would throw her out at the next Council she can't have it she don't want to be pregnated with the word because that's the only kind that the word can bring [Applause] forth I want to be so drunk on the power of God until this world has no no meaning to me and I want to be honest with you I'm a habitual [Music] offender I want to say this to you while you're dancing I'm not embarrassed thank you Lord because this quote lives while you're speaking in tongues I'm not embarrassed while are you screaming and standing up while the preaching is going on I'm not embarrassed that means you feel what I feel the same feeling that's on this stage is out across this audience I want to finish this up maybe I want to take this on maybe another week but I want to just drop a

to church and now now they're citizens of a kingdom and because there's a promise of the 11th Hour worker they get the same pay that the person's been there all the [Applause] years hallelujah

another realm that was coming in the room every day another world was coming in the building every day and then we come and preach and he would go maybe half an hour or 45 minutes and talk about last night's seal and all of a sudden it would break loose and there was a lot of people sitting in those meetings that didn't have a clue what was going on because they couldn't tap into that world but
