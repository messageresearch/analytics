[45:02] i thought last night was probably one of
[45:04] the greatest i've ever heard andrew
[45:06] preach
[45:09] and i saw him wrestling before service i
[45:11] saw him wrestling and
[45:14] i saw i i've been around here for a bit
[45:16] and so
[45:18] whatever he had on his ipad wasn't going
[45:20] to work
[45:20] [Music]
[45:25] you know just how it happens
[45:28] and i just said a little prayer for him
[45:30] and he took a little quote like that
[45:33] and preached that sermon last night
[45:36] and that was more than a man spoke that
[45:39] and then what we see take place here
[45:41] i was just overjoyed
[45:44] by what we witnessed last night
[45:47] little elijah coming to the altar and
[45:50] his heart being touched and
[45:52] nathan
[45:53] up here and
[45:54] each and every one of you that came
[45:56] erica
[45:58] my heart was over i thought my heart was
[45:59] going to explode when i was praying with
[46:01] you and
[46:03] he met sister crystal
[46:04] and uh amen
[46:06] i don't even know if you know i was
[46:08] praying with you or not but i was i was
[46:10] laboring with you and so
[46:12] amen god bless you we love you each and
[46:14] every one of you didn't call your name
[46:16] right there
[46:17] i just sure did enjoy
[46:19] i sure did enjoy what god did last night
[46:23] amen
[46:24] we had a wonderful time at brother
[46:25] bischolson
[46:27] and uh and brother tom raised it was
[46:30] their 50th anniversary
[46:32] and we're getting ready to come up on
[46:33] our 50th anniversary it's a jubilee for
[46:36] the bride
[46:38] had some wonderful services there
[46:41] and then we were able to fly home
[46:44] and then friday night we went to
[46:46] [Music]
[46:47] marks and
[46:49] spoke there and i'd like to personally
[46:51] thank each and every one of you that
[46:53] went and you were in that service and i
[46:56] know you had a late night friday night
[46:58] and
[46:59] thank you for coming and
[47:00] we sure did appreciate that with all of
[47:02] our hearts and
[47:04] amen next week brother aaron oglesby
[47:08] is going to be with us and uh the reason
[47:11] i'm going to mention him as brother
[47:12] aaron is
[47:14] is the young man that was brother tim
[47:15] pruitt's son-in-law
[47:18] and and i want to do this because i
[47:20] think we got some elements together that
[47:22] that would be make a nice picture
[47:24] and
[47:25] aaron is going to be the speaker next
[47:27] week and
[47:29] and he was not a preacher at that time
[47:30] and
[47:32] tim just kind of chuckled about it a
[47:33] little bit but
[47:34] he's a phenomenal speaker
[47:37] and
[47:38] looked forward to hear him
[47:40] and
[47:41] [Music]
[47:43] it happened the same night that i saw
[47:45] the vision
[47:46] of isaac
[47:48] and isaac was an impossible
[47:50] so i want to i want to do this this
[47:52] morning before i preach the sermon that
[47:54] i'm going to preach
[47:56] i want to speak to you because
[47:58] as i watched that happen last night to
[48:00] andrew
[48:02] it was happening to me
[48:05] and i was over in the corner
[48:08] and what i had to preach this morning
[48:10] was not working
[48:11] [Music]
[48:14] and i thought well i'll sit in the
[48:15] corner and make some notes
[48:17] well his sermon was too good for me to
[48:19] sit and make notes
[48:23] and so last night about 12 30 or 1
[48:25] o'clock i came to resolution and then
[48:27] got up and studied again this morning
[48:29] and so i believe what god's got for us

[53:08] i believe it was a couple weeks ago i
[53:10] did a couple weeks ago two weeks
[53:13] brother timothy came to me before
[53:15] service and he wanted to speak to me and
[53:19] just wanted some peace to come to his
[53:21] heart
[53:22] over decisions that they have to make
[53:25] some of those decisions are about moving
[53:27] here
[53:28] and becoming a part of the body here
[53:32] and so
[53:34] brother timothy
[53:36] we sat and we talked
[53:39] and
[53:41] we we just
[53:43] we just had a wonderful time
[53:46] and i walked out and he didn't know what
[53:48] i was going to preach
[53:50] and i spoke a sermon that you will
[53:51] remember
[53:53] in his
[53:54] hands and god had dealt with me to speak
[53:57] that in his hands
[54:01] he sat there and you can imagine what it
[54:04] was doing for him
[54:06] in 1997 they had had a wreck
[54:10] and for eagle's view
[54:12] he wrote an article
[54:14] and he titled it
[54:16] in his hands
[54:19] and he sat there
[54:21] knowing that he this had happened to him
[54:23] in 1997
[54:25] and now god is speaking to him at this
[54:27] pivotal point in his life
[54:30] and god is speaking to him again
[54:32] in his hands
[54:34] these are more than just services
[54:39] these are more than just services
[54:41] this is god speaking to you and
[54:44] using the lips and
[54:46] i i tell you what it made me shiver a
[54:48] bit when he gave that to me and
[54:50] because i know you can't put these
[54:52] things together
[54:53] amen god just does it all amen so good
[54:57] to have each and every one of you this
[54:58] morning and
[54:59] amen god bless you
[55:01] psalms 139 and verse 1 this morning oh
[55:06] lord thou
[55:08] hast searched me
[55:09] and known me
[55:12] thou knowest my down setting mine
[55:14] uprising thou understandeth my thought
[55:17] afar off
[55:18] thou compasseth my path my lying down
[55:21] and art acquainted with all my ways
[55:27] for there is not a word in my tongue
[55:30] but lo
[55:32] oh lord thou knowest it altogether
[55:37] thou hast beset me behind and before and
[55:40] laid thy hand upon me
[55:42] such knowledge is too wonderful for me
[55:45] it's it's high and i cannot attain unto
[55:47] it
[55:48] whether shall i go from thy spirit or
[55:50] whether shall i flee from thy presence
[55:53] notice these words if i ascend up into
[55:56] heaven thou art there
[55:59] if i make my bed in hell
[56:03] behold thou art there
[56:06] if i take the wings of the morning and
[56:09] dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea
[56:12] even there
[56:13] shall thy hand lead me and thy right
[56:17] hand shall hold me
[56:19] and if i say
[56:21] surely the darkness shall cover thee
[56:24] even the night shall be a light
[56:27] about me
[56:29] yea the darkness hideth not from thee
[56:33] but the night shineth as the day
[56:37] the darkness and the light are both the
[56:40] light to thee
[56:42] for thou possesseth my reigns
[56:45] thou coverst me
[56:47] in my mother's womb
[56:49] i will
[56:50] i will praise thee for i am fearfully
[56:54] and wonderfully made
[56:56] marvelous are thy works
[56:59] and that my soul knoweth right well
[57:03] my substance
[57:05] was not hid from thee
[57:07] when i was made in secret and curiously
[57:10] wrought in the lowest parts of the earth
[57:13] thine eyes did see my substance yet
[57:16] being unperfect
[57:18] and in thy book all my members were
[57:20] written
[57:21] which in continuance were fashioned when
[57:24] as yet there was none of them
[57:29] how precious also are thy thoughts
[57:33] unto me o god
[57:35] how great
[57:37] is the sum of them
[57:39] if i should count them
[57:44] they are more in number
[57:47] than the sand when i wake
[57:51] i am still
[57:53] with thee
[57:56] hallelujah we could dismiss right there
[57:58] and go wow
[58:00] wow wow
[58:01] amen you can be seated
[58:08] many of you were born after 1977.
[58:12] how many wow let's just stand how many
[58:14] were born after 1977
[58:20] amen after 1977 i'm not trying to pick
[58:24] on the old people here i just want to
[58:27] amen
[58:28] that whole sound booth upstairs is
[58:30] standing
[58:32] amen
[58:34] amen hallelujah god bless you you can be
[58:38] seated
[58:48] brother branham that was had the seven
[58:50] major visions
[58:52] and they were extremely accurate
[58:55] that could see cars that were driving
[58:57] themselves down the road
[58:59] that could see women getting the right
[59:01] to vote that could see adolf hitler that
[59:04] could see the earthquake that would take
[59:07] place all of the things that were that
[59:09] were there
[59:11] but our prophet was not allowed to look
[59:13] past the darkness of 1977.
[59:18] it is in the darkness that you have been
[59:21] born
[59:22] darkness so thick like revelations
[59:25] chapter 9 almost a gross darkness that
[59:28] is upon the people
[59:30] governments have lost their minds
[59:33] and immoral conditions of sodom and
[59:36] gomorrah is everywhere
[59:38] um
[59:40] churches have lost their vision
[59:43] things are have the world seems to have
[59:46] fell apart
[59:47] we're living in satan's eden
[59:50] and we can see the evidence of it and we
[59:53] can see how far can this go
[59:56] when children are now
[59:58] identifying themselves as cats and dogs
[1:00:01] needing litter boxes in the schools
[1:00:08] all that's mind-blowing to me
[1:00:11] what do you identify with
[1:00:13] when i was in canada a man was
[1:00:16] married to a hologram
[1:00:19] i don't even know what that all is about
[1:00:21] but
[1:00:22] he's married to an image on a wall
[1:00:24] to which that
[1:00:26] he throw he throws by light throws it up
[1:00:29] on the wall and he actually married that
[1:00:32] hologram
[1:00:37] how dark this age is
[1:00:41] i looked and this morning the futures
[1:00:43] for
[1:00:44] for fuel in our even in in the state of
[1:00:47] virginia
[1:00:48] is somewhere around eight dollars a
[1:00:50] gallon is what our futures is talking
[1:00:52] about
[1:00:55] to me that's mind blowing
[1:00:57] i i i just think that the whole the
[1:01:00] whole world has lost its
[1:01:03] it's lost its compass
[1:01:06] texas what happened in texas this last
[1:01:08] week
[1:01:12] god didn't do that
[1:01:15] god didn't cause that god didn't cause
[1:01:17] the war in ukraine he didn't he didn't
[1:01:19] cause the middle east to be like a
[1:01:22] sin caused that
[1:01:24] we have an enemy that kills and steals
[1:01:28] and destroys
[1:01:31] and if you could he'd take you off of
[1:01:32] the scene in a moment but you're
[1:01:35] protected by the angels of god
[1:01:39] [Applause]
[1:01:41] sometimes our conditions get
[1:01:44] just incredibly tough
[1:01:46] in the christian life it's a it's a war
[1:01:50] sometimes you begin to walk in in the
[1:01:52] christian life and
[1:01:54] you know you think well when i was
[1:01:56] drinking and smoking and cheating and
[1:01:59] lying and and i was doing those things i
[1:02:01] was having the time of my life but now
[1:02:04] that i've become a christian and my life
[1:02:06] has got cleaned up by the blood of jesus
[1:02:09] christ and now i'm having difficulties
[1:02:12] oh you had them then
[1:02:16] you had them then
[1:02:18] if you went to a professional ball game
[1:02:20] you spent about 300
[1:02:22] and you paid your tithes to satan
[1:02:26] and you paid seven dollars a pack or
[1:02:28] maybe eight dollars a pack of cigarettes
[1:02:30] and you did that two or three times a
[1:02:32] day the devil didn't whisper in your
[1:02:34] ears you're spending too much money
[1:02:37] or when you were drinking beer and 12
[1:02:40] and 12 and 15 dollars a carton and maybe
[1:02:43] up to 20 dollars a carton and then the
[1:02:45] wine that you were consuming and you was
[1:02:48] waking up sick the next morning
[1:02:50] [Applause]
[1:02:54] or you was taking a hit
[1:02:56] and you know people get scared to take
[1:02:58] the coven shot but they would take
[1:03:00] cocaine
[1:03:10] or spots of acid you know they're scared
[1:03:13] to death what the doctor will tell them
[1:03:14] but but they put drugs in their body
[1:03:19] and then wonder why kidneys don't go bad
[1:03:22] and liver goes bad and stomachs goes bad
[1:03:26] hey i can preach this cause my
[1:03:27] grandfather
[1:03:30] drank
[1:03:31] moonshine
[1:03:33] and it ate his stomach out of him
[1:03:36] thank god he met jesus before he left
[1:03:38] the earth
[1:03:40] are you with me
[1:03:42] and god gave him a new body
[1:03:45] uva put a sheep stomach in him and he
[1:03:47] lived he lived a short time and and he
[1:03:51] had came to the lord before all of that
[1:03:53] even before his diagnosis
[1:03:55] but but but sin pays a price
[1:03:59] sin has a phenomenal cost to it

[1:06:24] seasons
[1:06:25] in your life
[1:06:28] these things that we go through are
[1:06:30] temporal
[1:06:32] but we're here for the eternal purpose
[1:06:35] don't get your eyes on the temporary
[1:06:44] so jay we say it to you again welcome
[1:06:46] home
[1:06:47] we're proud of you

[1:07:10] we're we're thrilled about that
[1:07:15] you're going to college and you're
[1:07:16] you're you're going to do the things and
[1:07:19] and uh and we're just we're just we're
[1:07:21] here with you we're friends we're your
[1:07:23] buddies
[1:07:24] others that have graduated
[1:07:27] that are here
[1:07:28] we're just thrilled for them as well
[1:07:32] some of them graduate in a casket
[1:07:39] we we hate to say goodbye
[1:07:42] goodbyes are hard to make
[1:07:46] i said this at brother biscuits
[1:07:49] should you hear ron spencer died don't
[1:07:51] you grief
[1:07:54] because i'll be more alive there than i
[1:07:56] was here
[1:08:00] so regardless of your diagnosis in life
[1:08:04] doctors that that have to tell you
[1:08:06] they're not lying to you they're telling
[1:08:08] you what they see
[1:08:11] they're trying to help
[1:08:13] suffering humanity
[1:08:15] to get from one day to another day
[1:08:18] unless you're going to a quack doctor
[1:08:20] that's giving you quack medicine they're
[1:08:22] trying to help you
[1:08:26] there's a lot of you
[1:08:28] that is coming in their offices and they
[1:08:30] don't have to make all their money on
[1:08:32] you
[1:08:34] are you with me they're not going to
[1:08:36] have their whole reputation upon you
[1:08:39] sometimes we as our individuals we get
[1:08:42] we get a we get bad news
[1:08:45] whether it's financial
[1:08:47] whether it's job related
[1:08:51] whether it's in a doctor's office we get
[1:08:54] bad news
[1:08:55] but it's what we do with the news
[1:08:59] now i'm preaching to you it's what we do
[1:09:01] with the news that makes the difference
[1:09:07] we have a choice
[1:09:09] david was in a tough spot when he's
[1:09:11] writing these scriptures
[1:09:13] if i'm in heaven thou art there if i'm
[1:09:16] in the in hell thou art there
[1:09:21] if i take the wings of the morning
[1:09:24] thy right hand shall cover me
[1:09:29] yea the darkness hideth me
[1:09:32] maybe god has pushed you into a spot
[1:09:36] and put you in position for a miracle
[1:09:39] by doing that
[1:09:42] whitney
[1:09:43] and autumn
[1:09:45] and their mates
[1:09:47] had to be barren
[1:09:51] for wes to have a miracle that we will
[1:09:54] talk about
[1:09:55] until time ends
[1:09:58] he had to be born with a condition that
[1:10:00] he couldn't walk
[1:10:03] sarah was barren the three hebrew
[1:10:06] children were going into a fiery furnace
[1:10:09] daniel was being cast into a lion's den
[1:10:12] miracles are made of messes
[1:10:15] [Applause]
[1:10:18] miracles are made of masses
[1:10:21] and sometimes they seem impossible
[1:10:26] and god
[1:10:27] specializes in impossibilities
[1:10:33] when doctors give up god specializes at
[1:10:36] that spot
[1:10:40] hallelujah
[1:10:42] we rejoice in this weekend
[1:10:46] we re we rejoice in where we're at as a
[1:10:49] bride of jesus christ
[1:10:51] here past 77
[1:10:54] well over 50 years since the prophet
[1:10:57] passed away
[1:10:58] total darkness is all around us
[1:11:04] we are seeing our older ministers pass
[1:11:07] off of the scene one by one
[1:11:09] great men
[1:11:11] hildebrant that just passed my father
[1:11:14] that just passed brother henry greene
[1:11:17] your grandfather that passed brother dan
[1:11:19] dasley these were great men billy
[1:11:22] andrews that stood in the pulpit and i
[1:11:24] could go on and on and on and on
[1:11:26] we see ourselves becoming frail as human
[1:11:29] beings
[1:11:30] but let me just say god allows the
[1:11:32] candlestick to be moved from one portion
[1:11:35] to another
[1:11:38] and it might seem like a night season
[1:11:41] but god has a process of decreasing and
[1:11:45] increasing
[1:11:48] when brother branham left the scene in a
[1:11:50] car wreck it did not mean that the
[1:11:52] message was done it was only sowed
[1:11:56] and then it harvested and they come up
[1:12:00] and it's more powerful than it's ever
[1:12:02] been around the world
[1:12:06] when jesus went into a tomb and they
[1:12:09] sealed the tomb the devil didn't realize
[1:12:12] what he was doing
[1:12:14] it was in the night season in the in
[1:12:17] that cave
[1:12:19] that he would conquer hell
[1:12:22] he would take the keys of death hell and
[1:12:24] the grave and come forth with a parade
[1:12:27] of men
[1:12:28] like abraham and noah and those men
[1:12:32] would march out
[1:12:40] and he would ask them would you like to
[1:12:42] make a whistle stop
[1:12:45] back in israel
[1:12:47] and they'd go to some of those old
[1:12:49] places where they lived and walked past
[1:12:54] death could no longer touch them
[1:12:58] it was over for death and hell
[1:13:00] but you see light presses and it goes
[1:13:03] forward
[1:13:06] brother william said something the other
[1:13:08] night that just
[1:13:10] that just resonated i'd actually made a
[1:13:13] note on it
[1:13:14] but it just resonated when he said
[1:13:16] it and he said every other messenger
[1:13:21] their message was denominated
[1:13:25] and as it denominated it began the fires
[1:13:27] of it begin to die down
[1:13:30] and it it become a denomination where
[1:13:33] schools are built and
[1:13:35] all these different kind of things and
[1:13:37] ministry seminaries are taking place
[1:13:41] but when brother branham died
[1:13:45] we didn't go to a denomination
[1:13:48] but this message has risen
[1:13:54] hallelujah
[1:13:56] are you with me god help our churches
[1:14:01] let me just say this to you in the book
[1:14:04] of revelations it talks about
[1:14:07] that
[1:14:09] that god hated a lukewarm spirit
[1:14:13] and brother brown identifies that as a
[1:14:16] backslidden spirit
[1:14:19] andrew you said something about it last
[1:14:20] night but a backslidden spirit is easy
[1:14:23] to take on even in a message church
[1:14:28] and it happens because
[1:14:31] we get relaxed
[1:14:35] we fold our arms and say preach to me
[1:14:39] entertain me
[1:14:41] don't hold me too long
[1:14:48] now i'm not expecting to put anything in
[1:14:50] so don't y'all expect anything for me
[1:14:52] i'm not a preacher i'm not a singer i'm
[1:14:54] just gonna sit here
[1:14:56] you'll never get from nothing from god
[1:14:58] being a spectator
[1:15:01] this is not a spectator sport
[1:15:04] this is where you get out what you put
[1:15:07] in
[1:15:16] god asks us to worship our worship is
[1:15:19] with our mouth
[1:15:22] now your mouth has the power of life and
[1:15:24] death in it
[1:15:26] it can speak positive or it can speak
[1:15:29] negative
[1:15:30] and you create the world that you live
[1:15:33] in
[1:15:37] as i've said for years you that don't
[1:15:39] know what i'm saying here just tell your
[1:15:41] wife how ugly she looks this morning
[1:15:45] welcome to your day
[1:15:53] but we speak positive
[1:15:56] we sing positive
[1:15:59] that's why the opening of the service is
[1:16:01] so important
[1:16:03] it's so important when the song leader
[1:16:06] takes the service and he begins to lead
[1:16:08] you in worship
[1:16:13] and a lot of people yes they're sick but
[1:16:15] they got spiritual arthritis their hands
[1:16:17] don't
[1:16:19] their arms don't work
[1:16:22] their feet don't work
[1:16:35] are you with me now
[1:16:39] so what will happen is is
[1:16:41] they begin to make excuses of why they
[1:16:44] can't worship
[1:16:45] and the devil has so them a lie
[1:16:50] now i don't know if you know this or not
[1:16:51] but if you build fires
[1:16:54] you got to keep fires going
[1:17:00] there's a lot of wood stoves in this
[1:17:02] area i used to be a chimney sweep i'm
[1:17:05] thankful to god i'm not that anymore and
[1:17:06] not in that shape to do that no more
[1:17:09] but i would climb as far as well i fell
[1:17:11] 40 feet so that'll give you an idea but
[1:17:14] but let me let me just say this to you a
[1:17:16] lot of chimneys get set up because they
[1:17:19] burn their fire too low
[1:17:26] and there's a lot of people get suited
[1:17:28] up in buildings like this
[1:17:34] now we're not catholics and we're not
[1:17:35] going to send up a bunch of black or
[1:17:37] white smoke here today
[1:17:41] but we ought to be an open flame
[1:17:53] there ought to be a fire coming out of
[1:17:55] our heart now let me just say this you
[1:17:56] you've got to feed the fire
[1:18:02] you remember brother branham said that
[1:18:03] that old chief that oh indian
[1:18:06] said uh how are you doing he said well
[1:18:07] there's a war going on the inside of me
[1:18:10] he said there's two dogs are fighting
[1:18:14] well which one is winning he said the
[1:18:15] one that i feed the most
[1:18:17] so you can feed your carnal stinking
[1:18:20] flesh
[1:18:21] that is going to go back to the earth
[1:18:27] you can feed it and it'll feel real good
[1:18:29] and all of that but it don't feel good
[1:18:31] sometimes sitting here for three hours
[1:18:34] and it'll start telling you how stiff
[1:18:36] you're getting but it didn't tell you
[1:18:37] how stiff you were getting when you was
[1:18:39] watching a movie
[1:18:59] the scripture says we're troubled on
[1:19:00] every side
[1:19:03] but notice how he says this
[1:19:05] yet not distressed
[1:19:09] we are perplexed
[1:19:12] not in despair
[1:19:16] persecuted
[1:19:18] but not forsaken
[1:19:20] notice how he's telling us to take an
[1:19:23] attitude
[1:19:27] don't pity me
[1:19:29] you may be in a war but we're not having
[1:19:32] a pity party here
[1:19:39] cast down
[1:19:41] not destroyed
[1:19:43] always bearing about in the body of the
[1:19:45] dying of the lord jesus that the life of
[1:19:47] jesus
[1:19:48] might be manifested in our body
[1:19:52] think about that
[1:19:54] notice as it comes down
[1:19:57] verse 17
[1:19:58] for our
[1:20:00] light affliction
[1:20:04] which is but for a moment
[1:20:09] worketh for us a far
[1:20:12] more exceedingly eternal weight of glory
[1:20:17] notice these next words i want you to
[1:20:19] read it with me while we look not at the
[1:20:22] things which are seen
[1:20:24] but at the things which are not seen for
[1:20:27] the things which are seen are temporal
[1:20:31] but the things which are not seen are
[1:20:34] eternal
[1:20:38] so can i take you through some temporary
[1:20:40] things for a moment sarah was barren
[1:20:46] best we can calculate about 89 years
[1:20:50] most of our life she was barren
[1:20:54] but god don't take a long time to get
[1:20:56] you fixed up
[1:20:58] three hebrew children's lived their
[1:21:00] entire lives with a testimony of being
[1:21:04] being going in a fire
[1:21:06] and the ones that throw them in the fire
[1:21:09] were killed
[1:21:11] and when they came out they didn't even
[1:21:12] smell like smoke
[1:21:20] lazarus went to a grave and jesus was
[1:21:23] gone
[1:21:24] and everybody else was criticizing your
[1:21:26] friend went the opposite way
[1:21:29] but god has a plan for the night seasons
[1:21:32] of your life
[1:21:35] he's got a plan for you
[1:21:39] don't blame god god's on your side
[1:21:43] [Applause]
[1:21:45] i'm mad at god you you're mad at the
[1:21:48] wrong one
[1:22:03] it's kind of like somebody promising you
[1:22:07] if you give me eighty thousand dollars
[1:22:10] i'll make you a millionaire
[1:22:17] if it's too big good to be true
[1:22:19] it is
[1:22:21] it is
[1:22:26] and sometimes the guy can be so
[1:22:28] convincing
[1:22:32] it'd be so convincing
[1:22:34] there was a guy at your place the other
[1:22:36] day and
[1:22:37] he was doing a real
[1:22:38] real job trying to sell you on something
[1:22:42] that would take you 40 years to pay off
[1:22:46] and he was projecting figures that
[1:22:49] for dominion power that he don't have a
[1:22:52] clue how that's going to go
[1:22:53] and i thought this guy is selling a hot
[1:22:56] air balloon
[1:23:03] and he helped me with the sermon today
[1:23:06] satan will sell you a lot of stuff
[1:23:13] i don't even know what your decision was
[1:23:14] on that thing
[1:23:17] but he'll sell you a whole lot of stuff
[1:23:19] it'll cause you bitterness
[1:23:25] it'll cause you jealousy
[1:23:29] he divides not only in washington
[1:23:32] he divides churches
[1:23:34] he divides friendships he divides
[1:23:37] marriages
[1:23:41] don't tell me
[1:23:42] you as the bride of jesus christ almost
[1:23:45] live perfect lives and homes
[1:23:47] and yet there's mornings that you wake
[1:23:49] up
[1:23:50] i i i i i i
[1:23:57] boy that landed
[1:24:04] and you go what in the world happened we
[1:24:07] almost live in a fairy tale marriage
[1:24:10] we went to bed and honeymoon and here we
[1:24:16] [Applause]
[1:24:28] you on the internet you know it's the
[1:24:30] truth
[1:24:36] you got down you had a prayer meeting
[1:24:38] you felt the presence of the lord
[1:24:41] sister connie punch him again go ahead
[1:24:43] and punch him again
[1:24:46] [Applause]
[1:24:48] she said i know that's the truth i'm
[1:24:49] going to punch him right now
[1:24:51] that's a truth that's a truth
[1:24:57] you had a prayer meeting but an enemy
[1:25:01] that has the right
[1:25:04] to affect your flesh and affect your
[1:25:07] spirit
[1:25:08] but it can't get to your soul
[1:25:11] how about somebody ought to shout right
[1:25:13] there he can't get to your soul so it
[1:25:16] can affect only this part
[1:25:18] it's the temporary part
[1:25:27] hallelujah
[1:25:30] hallelujah
[1:25:31] [Applause]
[1:25:37] now it's in that moment you can allow
[1:25:39] him to destroy your day
[1:25:41] or you can turn it on him
[1:25:43] and send him home
[1:25:46] i'll not put up with you today
[1:25:54] brother homer and i had a flat on the
[1:25:56] truck
[1:25:58] then we had a flat on the dump dump
[1:26:00] truck
[1:26:01] then we took a tractor up the road
[1:26:04] and i was riding on the bush hog wasn't
[1:26:07] safe we've not done a lot of safe things
[1:26:11] i was riding on the bush hog
[1:26:13] and the tire went flat on the tractor
[1:26:19] he got off and he looked at that tire
[1:26:25] this has all happened in a half an hour
[1:26:30] and he looked at that he didn't say
[1:26:31] nothing to me
[1:26:33] he pointed at that tire he said devil
[1:26:37] i refused for you to make me mad today
[1:26:47] and one at a time we got those tires
[1:26:50] fixed
[1:26:51] and we went and had dinner
[1:26:55] ain't that right sister nancy
[1:26:57] you live with
[1:27:05] brother homer had some horrendous things
[1:27:06] happen to him toward the end of his life
[1:27:10] i don't know whether you know if there's
[1:27:11] this or not but he had an attitude that
[1:27:14] he was going to get himself better
[1:27:16] regardless of what was happening
[1:27:19] and there was times that he came and
[1:27:22] i would push him up the back end in that
[1:27:24] wheelchair and brother ray had that
[1:27:26] built back there so we could push him in
[1:27:28] and we would get him in and on the way
[1:27:30] in he would take three pain pills and
[1:27:32] there would be times to where his eyes
[1:27:34] was as glassy
[1:27:35] as some of yours used to be
[1:27:39] and when he got that electric wheelchair
[1:27:41] for those that wasn't here he'd he'd
[1:27:43] have it right he'd have it there and
[1:27:45] he'd roll up here and he'd want to talk
[1:27:46] and say something whether you were
[1:27:48] singing or you wasn't singing he'd roll
[1:27:50] up here want to talk
[1:27:51] and then he rolled back
[1:27:54] it was a night season
[1:27:58] it was a night season of his life
[1:28:01] but something held him
[1:28:05] something held him his attitude didn't
[1:28:08] get cross and mean and stubborn and
[1:28:11] hateful that might have happened at
[1:28:13] times but he didn't show that to you
[1:28:20] let me just say your your problems may
[1:28:22] be worse than you can possibly seem to
[1:28:25] get through
[1:28:27] but god built you
[1:28:32] you said a few moments ago after 77 you
[1:28:35] were born
[1:28:37] you were not born in the light of the
[1:28:39] the
[1:28:40] the tent meetings and brother branham
[1:28:42] being here and the original church is
[1:28:45] being built but now you're here to live
[1:28:48] in maturity and to stand when all hell
[1:28:52] is against you
[1:29:03] this was sent to me the other day
[1:29:06] on the roughest days
[1:29:08] our lowest hours of despair even in
[1:29:11] those times we're still chosen
[1:29:14] blessed
[1:29:16] favored
[1:29:18] forgiven
[1:29:20] loved
[1:29:21] let of god victorious
[1:29:23] inheritors of all heaven's glory
[1:29:26] privileged to walk with our own creator
[1:29:29] we are married to the king of kings and
[1:29:32] he calls us his beloved
[1:29:36] we're strong in faith armed to fight
[1:29:38] devils entrusted with god's word
[1:29:42] with the most powerful weapon protected
[1:29:44] by the arm of the almighty he has placed
[1:29:47] us
[1:29:48] with a hedge around us
[1:29:50] we have the assurance that each time
[1:29:53] that we call he hears and he answers
[1:29:57] [Music]
[1:29:58] [Applause]
[1:30:01] we have rest and hope and peace and joy
[1:30:04] is ours even in the darkness
[1:30:08] his light is around us
[1:30:12] even in the valley we are so blessed
[1:30:19] brother ron but i've got too much
[1:30:21] pressure on me
[1:30:22] who did that
[1:30:27] i'm so exhausted
[1:30:31] who did that
[1:30:34] i'm so frustrated
[1:30:38] who did that
[1:30:41] god didn't do that
[1:30:50] but i've lost friends
[1:30:52] look around
[1:30:56] i've lost a lot of preaching buddies in
[1:30:58] life
[1:31:00] men that i thought were good buddies
[1:31:02] but if you commit adultery
[1:31:04] or you backslide
[1:31:06] or you decide alcohol is more important
[1:31:08] you don't need to stand in no pulpit
[1:31:13] gotta raise up somebody in your place
[1:31:16] that will live the life and preach it
[1:31:18] straight
[1:31:19] [Applause]
[1:31:28] well brother on i'm just going to suck
[1:31:29] myself back in the cave really that's a
[1:31:32] real spot for you
[1:31:34] it's a spot called depression
[1:31:37] it's a spot where the devil will whisper
[1:31:40] in your ear and tell you all kind of
[1:31:41] nonsense
[1:31:43] your spirit
[1:31:48] it'll contaminate your spirit word you
[1:31:50] don't have no trust in nobody
[1:31:58] on you don't have a quote for that oh
[1:31:59] yeah i do
[1:32:01] i don't do nothing i'm a chess player as
[1:32:03] a preacher
[1:32:07] brother branham is standing over his
[1:32:09] baby that's dying
[1:32:12] with no hope
[1:32:16] and his wife
[1:32:17] has just died
[1:32:23] and the devil's whispering in his ears
[1:32:25] how many of you ever had the devil
[1:32:27] whisper in you or you
[1:32:32] yeah so you're look around you you're
[1:32:34] not the only one
[1:32:37] and the devil tells him
[1:32:39] god don't love him
[1:32:41] let me just tell you in spite of
[1:32:43] yourself god loves you
[1:32:49] now god's not fickle like human beings
[1:32:53] your bills are paid

[1:33:02] everybody happy everybody happy with
[1:33:04] mama happy everybody happy
[1:33:12] but when the world's being flipped
[1:33:13] upside down
[1:33:17] god's

[1:33:22] because you're being a big baby

[1:33:27] just a big stupid baby

[1:33:36] me i wasn't picking you out i just
[1:33:38] picked a number out

[1:34:35] category
[1:34:49] hmm
[1:35:00] i got too much pressure
[1:35:04] who did that
[1:35:07] i'm just wore out
[1:35:11] who did that
[1:35:13] i'm completely wiped out i'm having a
[1:35:15] nervous breakdown
[1:35:19] who did that
[1:35:20] god didn't do it
[1:35:22] god didn't do that to you
[1:35:25] just suppose you're a joke today it's a
[1:35:28] light affliction
[1:35:33] i knew i wouldn't get as many amens
[1:35:36] so i preached this sukkah to the other
[1:35:38] day
[1:35:39] light afflictions no matter how bad they
[1:35:42] are
[1:35:43] if you compare it to job
[1:35:54] if you compare it to jesus
[1:35:57] being beat
[1:36:01] and going to calvary
[1:36:03] and being spit on
[1:36:10] sometimes preachers get sensitive
[1:36:12] but they didn't preach to the
[1:36:14] congregations that brother branham had
[1:36:15] to preach to
[1:36:19] where people are mad and demon possessed
[1:36:21] and all different kind of things are
[1:36:23] happening while he's trying to preach
[1:36:25] the seals
[1:36:28] but he stayed focused
[1:36:31] here's what i want to say to you you've
[1:36:33] heard me preach it the hurt will not
[1:36:37] destroy the music
[1:36:39] [Music]
[1:36:41] in an orchestra you don't know how bad
[1:36:43] their days are or whether they're
[1:36:46] suffering with cancer or they're having
[1:36:48] marriage problems they're just playing
[1:36:50] bach or beethoven
[1:36:52] and doing the best that they know how to
[1:36:54] do they put themselves aside
[1:36:57] i need to preach a series on that put
[1:37:00] yourself aside and serve jesus with
[1:37:03] everything that's within you
[1:37:06] [Applause]
[1:37:22] war is going on in the ukraine
[1:37:25] it has went on in armenia it's went out
[1:37:27] on there's about a hundred wars that's
[1:37:29] going on right now
[1:37:31] some of them are getting a publicity
[1:37:33] some are not
[1:37:35] some of them millions of people have
[1:37:37] died
[1:37:40] some of them are publicized beyond being
[1:37:42] publicized
[1:37:45] but you are in the target as americans
[1:37:50] putin is making arrangements
[1:37:54] he doesn't know it but he's been
[1:37:55] prophesied to do the job
[1:37:59] he's he's making arrangements to destroy
[1:38:02] america
[1:38:04] and just in case rome europe you're you
[1:38:07] think that you're you're going to get by
[1:38:10] making arrangements destroy you two
[1:38:13] brother man said he'll drop a bomb right
[1:38:15] down your smokestack
[1:38:19] i like how accurate god was
[1:38:22] but because god's made another
[1:38:24] arrangement with you
[1:38:29] the believers in ukraine for the most
[1:38:32] part have made it out
[1:38:35] they've been having services the
[1:38:37] presence of the lord has been with them
[1:38:41] young people's meetings have went on
[1:38:44] church is going on in the midst of hell
[1:38:47] on earth
[1:38:48] [Applause]
[1:38:59] the wings of god is there to watch over
[1:39:02] them
[1:39:06] they're there to watch over you
[1:39:15] this might not affect nobody but maybe
[1:39:17] maybe i'll just
[1:39:18] just preach it to those on the internet
[1:39:20] there are times you feel like quitting
[1:39:26] scripture
[1:39:27] prophet of god
[1:39:29] said i quit
[1:39:30] i refuse to preach anymore
[1:39:33] i'm not going to preach any more god
[1:39:34] because your word has become a reproach
[1:39:37] to me
[1:39:39] people laugh at me and make fun of me
[1:39:42] they don't want to hear what i got to
[1:39:44] say
[1:39:45] i feel rejected so i'm not going to
[1:39:47] preach anymore
[1:39:53] and after a while
[1:39:55] he said oh god
[1:39:58] your fire
[1:40:00] is down on the inside of me
[1:40:04] it's gonna burn me up i gotta go back to
[1:40:07] the pulpit
[1:40:10] [Music]
[1:40:12] another prophet
[1:40:14] he has a phenomenal meeting
[1:40:18] 400 prophets are destroyed at that
[1:40:20] meeting
[1:40:21] i bet that wasn't politically correct
[1:40:26] and because one woman
[1:40:29] threatened him
[1:40:35] he went and laid
[1:40:37] under a juniper tree
[1:40:41] now here's what god will do for you in
[1:40:43] your night season
[1:40:45] he don't throw you away
[1:40:47] he feeds you
[1:40:50] he sends angels
[1:40:52] you don't know it because you can't see
[1:40:54] them he sends angels to watch over you
[1:41:01] he said i want the angel brother jim bab
[1:41:03] always loved this part he said i want
[1:41:05] the angel that cooks the best cakes
[1:41:09] and he would say brother ron ah sister
[1:41:11] linda he would tell me this over and
[1:41:13] over again he said brother ron i
[1:41:15] wouldn't mind laying under a juniper
[1:41:17] tree and having an angel cook for me a
[1:41:19] little while
[1:41:21] he said i would get i want the angel
[1:41:23] with the best cakes
[1:41:25] best cook in heaven
[1:41:27] to cook elijah
[1:41:30] some
[1:41:30] cakes
[1:41:32] and he would eat them
[1:41:34] and go back to sleep
[1:41:38] he was in a spot wasn't it
[1:41:43] god says i want the angel with the
[1:41:44] softest hands
[1:41:48] to come and rub his forehead
[1:41:50] and massage him
[1:41:56] god didn't give up on him
[1:42:01] he didn't say i'm done with him
[1:42:06] he said i got to take care of my boy
[1:42:09] i seen him with a tough job i got to
[1:42:11] take care of him
[1:42:15] we were talking the other day why would
[1:42:17] we get so many visitations from angels
[1:42:21] and i told the brothers i said i'll tell
[1:42:23] you what
[1:42:24] i'm kind of sometimes like elijah laying
[1:42:26] under juniper tree when the battle gets
[1:42:28] really rough and tough i could feel
[1:42:30] those angels coming down
[1:42:32] god's not done with me yet but he has to
[1:42:35] give me some supernatural strength
[1:42:40] [Applause]
[1:42:49] this is just a day this is just a
[1:42:50] typical day i got up my sugar was over
[1:42:52] 600 this morning
[1:42:55] went to bed last night everything was
[1:42:57] fine got up and it was over 600 took my

[1:43:08] throw up have a table full of people
[1:43:11] that i want to talk to

[1:43:16] i get to shake so bad i can't even put
[1:43:18] my own buttons together did i say i want
[1:43:20] to lay on the couch the rest of the day
[1:43:22] oh no
[1:43:26] you've got to have a fight
[1:43:30] when you're in the night season you got
[1:43:31] to have some fight on the inside of you
[1:43:35] because you're born of his bones
[1:43:37] your life of his life
[1:43:40] your power of his power
[1:43:46] these men felt like quitting
[1:43:48] but there's no quit in us
[1:43:51] jesus would say it
[1:43:53] no man having to put his hand to the
[1:43:56] plow
[1:43:57] and looking back as even fit for the
[1:43:59] kingdom of heaven
[1:44:03] understand this got's bigger than your
[1:44:05] problems
[1:44:11] you okay you okay here for a little bit
[1:44:14] war always rages
[1:44:16] between the two great kingdoms it always
[1:44:19] rages
[1:44:22] peace and good
[1:44:24] peace
[1:44:26] and the battle of evil
[1:44:28] is always against each other
[1:44:31] it's impossibility to have peace in this
[1:44:34] sin cursed earth
[1:44:37] but
[1:44:38] light is always greater
[1:44:44] than darkness
[1:44:47] brother brown would say in shalom
[1:44:49] that darkness
[1:44:52] would get darkest just before the
[1:44:54] breaking of the day
[1:44:57] and as i heard the other morning god
[1:44:59] speak to me morning is coming
[1:45:03] morning is coming
[1:45:06] morning is coming
[1:45:10] brother tim called me yesterday evening
[1:45:13] as i was getting ready he said brother
[1:45:15] ron when god spoke to you three times
[1:45:16] that's urgent something's getting ready
[1:45:18] to happen
[1:45:20] he said it's a breaking of the day
[1:45:23] he said we're gonna see some breaking of
[1:45:24] the day
[1:45:26] we're gonna see the beacon of light
[1:45:28] because light is greater than darkness
[1:45:36] let me can i just interject something
[1:45:38] right here
[1:45:39] brother tim and i have not preached the
[1:45:41] edmonton meetings together ever
[1:45:45] i preached the edmonton meetings over 20
[1:45:48] years at brother harold hildebrandt's
[1:45:51] brother harold felt led before he passed
[1:45:53] away that brother tim and myself would
[1:45:56] preach those meetings
[1:45:59] in
[1:46:00] late july
[1:46:01] just before your meeting
[1:46:15] the same weekend
[1:46:17] the pope is going to visit
[1:46:20] edmonton canada
[1:46:23] same weekend
[1:46:25] the prince of darkness
[1:46:30] is going to be in the same city
[1:46:33] as two princes of light
[1:46:38] and if you've been in school at all
[1:46:41] two is greater than one
[1:46:54] i wanna i wanna i wanna speak
[1:46:56] personal to you now
[1:47:00] about a year ago i had a vision
[1:47:03] of it being so dark
[1:47:06] and so dense but it was just before
[1:47:09] evening
[1:47:11] you could barely see
[1:47:13] and people moving
[1:47:16] and we were standing before great gates
[1:47:19] some of you have heard me tell this we
[1:47:21] were standing before great gates and i
[1:47:23] looked across the gate
[1:47:26] and this could
[1:47:28] represent many many
[1:47:30] hundreds and even thousands of preachers
[1:47:33] but i was standing on one side and
[1:47:35] brother temperate was standing on the
[1:47:37] other side
[1:47:40] and we were doing our very best
[1:47:44] to get people through the gate
[1:47:46] in that darkness
[1:47:48] and when the gate would open and people
[1:47:50] would go in
[1:47:51] we could hear the songs of of angels
[1:47:54] singing and those bright lights coming
[1:47:57] out like beams
[1:48:03] brother tim's church is actually called
[1:48:04] evening light tabernacle
[1:48:07] and when i went and saw the beams of
[1:48:09] light coming out even around the windows
[1:48:12] it represented it looked like those same
[1:48:14] kind of beams that were taking place
[1:48:18] this tabernacle has been called
[1:48:19] lighthouse
[1:48:21] and we're sending light into the
[1:48:23] darkness
[1:48:28] if we could just think just for a little
[1:48:30] while we've all got plans to live for
[1:48:32] years
[1:48:36] but we have got to come with the
[1:48:38] realization we got to be ready
[1:48:41] like never before
[1:48:44] for in such an hour as you think not the
[1:48:46] son of man cometh
[1:48:51] i said this at dad's friday night and it
[1:48:54] didn't go it just just was for that
[1:48:56] local body so i want to say it to where
[1:48:58] people can hear it
[1:49:01] putin is doing his best
[1:49:04] to destroy what he can
[1:49:11] but he can't destroy america
[1:49:14] until we're gone
[1:49:19] because light is greater than darkness
[1:49:24] and if god has allowed him at this
[1:49:27] junction
[1:49:29] to be where he's at that means on the
[1:49:31] opposite end of the spectrum there's a
[1:49:34] bride
[1:49:37] that is in rapturing condition
[1:49:41] well you say well brother ron i i just
[1:49:43] don't know i don't know where the
[1:49:44] message are correct you better figure it
[1:49:46] out
[1:49:48] i'm riding the fence you better figure
[1:49:50] it out
[1:49:54] your loved ones that's doing everything
[1:49:56] in the world don't don't have a clue
[1:49:57] about church on sunday morning you
[1:49:59] better get it figured out
[1:50:02] this is more than just a good thing to
[1:50:04] do
[1:50:07] [Applause]
[1:50:18] let me say this in my closing comments
[1:50:20] this morning
[1:50:21] resurrection is coming
[1:50:23] satan can't stop it
[1:50:27] those that are in the grave is getting
[1:50:28] ready to come out of the grave
[1:50:31] the voice of resurrection is in the
[1:50:33] bride
[1:50:34] and there's nothing satan can do to stop
[1:50:36] it
[1:50:43] the voice of rapture is in the bride and
[1:50:47] there's nothing satan can do to stop it
[1:50:52] if i needed the holy ghost
[1:50:54] there would be nothing to stop it
[1:51:00] say brother on i need a revival in my
[1:51:02] life this is a good day

[1:53:55] god wants to live
[1:54:00] he's proved himself charlie being born
[1:54:05] he's proved himself
[1:54:07] he's proved himself over and over and
[1:54:09] over again
[1:54:12] ron but i've watched you i've actually
[1:54:14] got this text brother ron why do you
[1:54:16] keep bringing your grandchildren up they
[1:54:18] were not supposed to be
[1:54:30] well brother ron i probably could have
[1:54:31] preached a better sermon this morning
[1:54:33] you know but
[1:54:34] i'm just i'm just sitting here you
[1:54:37] haven't moved me
[1:54:39] you didn't pray before church
[1:54:43] you got your lazy self up i'm discerning
[1:54:45] right now so you just might as well hang
[1:54:46] in there
[1:54:47] you've got your lazy self up and barely
[1:54:50] got your shirt on didn't tuck it in your
[1:54:52] pants
[1:54:55] and you criticized me and you ain't want
[1:54:58] to sow to jesus christ
[1:55:01] get
[1:55:02] started started today's your day
[1:55:06] get started
[1:55:18] you can be seated just another minute
[1:55:24] you see that flag
[1:55:27] i'm still proud of her
[1:55:31] there's a lot of things about america
[1:55:33] i'm not proud of
[1:55:35] i'm really i'm really not proud of but
[1:55:37] today's not that day to
[1:55:39] be doing that
[1:55:41] i'm still proud
[1:55:43] because i'm free to preach
[1:55:48] in china you're not free to preach
[1:55:54] but under those horrible conditions
[1:55:57] in china they're still having church
[1:56:01] they stopped their bibles from being
[1:56:02] printed
[1:56:04] they stopped all of the things and i
[1:56:06] can't say what's going on there
[1:56:09] because they listen to these services
[1:56:14] but under that darkness
[1:56:18] they love this message
[1:56:20] with all their hearts
[1:56:24] god bless them
[1:56:26] god bless them
[1:56:29] god bless them
[1:56:36] in china
[1:56:39] if a woman wears a dress she's
[1:56:40] identified as a prostitute
[1:56:44] that's their culture
[1:56:48] but when they hear the message
[1:56:50] they go out and get a dress like you
[1:56:52] sister jenny
[1:56:56] and they put a dress on
[1:56:58] and they identify themselves
[1:57:01] as a christian
[1:57:03] while the world identifies them as
[1:57:05] harlots
[1:57:07] more people there than almost any place
[1:57:09] in the world
[1:57:10] so you talk about pressure
[1:57:13] and then they have to watch when they go
[1:57:15] to church they all can't get there at
[1:57:16] the same time so one gets there and he
[1:57:19] starts worshiping and maybe an hour or
[1:57:20] so later the rest of them start
[1:57:22] trickling in and they start worshiping
[1:57:26] and before long the preacher shows up
[1:57:28] and he starts preaching
[1:57:30] and he may preach in the middle of the
[1:57:32] night because that's the only time that
[1:57:33] they can do it
[1:57:36] god help us
[1:57:38] god help us
[1:57:40] god help us today
[1:57:42] in the night season
[1:57:45] let there
[1:57:47] be
[1:57:48] light
[1:57:59] across this building tonight there's
[1:58:02] there's a lot of widows that are here
[1:58:06] we have more widows than we have where
[1:58:08] the world
[1:58:09] brother
[1:58:10] medicine's our only way to worry my
[1:58:13] count is right somebody can tell me
[1:58:15] different
[1:58:18] but you see i have to make a choice
[1:58:21] that sister connie doesn't join the
[1:58:24] widowers with us
[1:58:32] i have to fight to live
[1:58:36] now i'm preaching to you now i've got my
[1:58:38] heart
[1:58:39] i've got to fight to live
[1:58:44] and the fight's worth it
[1:58:49] [Applause]
[1:59:03] now you may have to fight to get to
[1:59:05] church
[1:59:09] you may have a real struggle
[1:59:11] and you may be going through what nobody
[1:59:13] else is going through
[1:59:18] but to fight
[1:59:20] is worth it
[1:59:24] i want to tell you
[1:59:29] it's worth it
[1:59:31] let me tell you how worth it it is
[1:59:37] it may not be for you
[1:59:39] it may be for your children
[1:59:51] you might be able to lay home and
[1:59:53] listen to tapes and you'll be okay but
[1:59:55] your children won't do that
[1:59:59] you might be able to lay at home and
[2:00:01] live stream but your children won't do
[2:00:03] that
[2:00:04] they're going to play games they're
[2:00:05] going to do all different kind of things
[2:00:06] they're going to have all kind of
[2:00:07] friends and they're going to be in the
[2:00:09] darkness
[2:00:12] it's worth it to fight to get to church
[2:00:16] [Applause]
[2:00:28] some of you drive a long way now
[2:00:30] it's worth it
[2:00:33] it's worth it
[2:00:37] some of you that drive five minutes you
[2:00:39] pray for those that drive
[2:00:41] four hours
[2:00:42] four hours and a half
[2:00:47] it's worth it
[2:00:50] it's worth it
[2:00:57] god's bigger than your circumstances
[2:01:02] he's bigger than your battle
[2:01:07] he's bigger than your situation
[2:01:11] no you don't know how to handle it
[2:01:14] but it's not your battle anyway
[2:01:19] it's god's battle
[2:01:22] and if god's got it
[2:01:26] he'll take care of it
[2:01:32] all you have to do
[2:01:34] is be still
[2:01:37] and know that i am god
[2:01:41] with our heads bowed just a moment
[2:01:49] the scripture says and when the enemy
[2:01:51] shall come in like a flood

[2:01:56] standard against it
