Quinn he had a birthday this week sister Wanda has a birthday today and so we're just happy birthday sister Wanda for all those that have birthday this week or this coming week happy birthday to you amen I'd like to speak to you visited by an Angel Today and Not only was Mary visited by an Angel but we all have been amen we all have been the angel of this day visited our homes and our lives and we have been Touched by an Angel Luke chapter one 1 and verse 26 and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God under the city of Galilee named nazarus and the and we all know that nothing good can come out of Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God what a statement and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto thee unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end and then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she shall also conceive and a son in her old age and the this is the sixth month with her who was called Baron now notice these next words for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and Mary arose in those days and went in the Hill Country with haste into the city of Judah and entered into the house of Zacharias and saluted Elizabeth and it came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary The Babe leaped in her womb and Elizabeth's with was filled with the Holy Ghost and she spake out with a loud voice and said blessed are thou among women blessed is the fruit of thy womb and when is this to come to this come to me that the mother of my my Lord should come to me for lo as soon as the voice of the salutation sounded in mine ears The Babe lip leaped in my womb for joy and blessed is she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord and Mary said my soul do magnify the Lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my savior you may be seated may the Lord add to the blessing of his word I have just read to you today one of the most phenomenal Supernatural testimonies that is that is believed by I would say all of christiandom regardless of denomination and we all hinged on one girl's testimony there wasn't a thousand people standing there when it happened as a matter of fact critics would immediately go to work calling this child IL illegitimate and she a harlot but we today believe this testimony with all of our hearts we believe it with all of our hearts for we as Christian Believers believe that that same God came and visited our womb and it became a supernatural experience to us and no matter what the devil in all of his critics say that it didn't happen we know that we know that we know that we know that the angel of God came directly to our manger and wanted to be born in our heart and changed our lives amen for the scripture tells us in Isaiah 49 and verse 7 thus sayith the Lord the the Redeemer of Israel the ho the Holy One to with whom man despiseth to him whom the nation ad whth to a servant of the rulers Kings shall see thee see and arise and princes shall worship because of the Lord that is faithful and the Holy One of Israel he shall choose thee thus sayeth the Lord in acceptance of time I heard thee and in a day of salvation have I helped thee and I will preserve thee and give thee for a covenant of the people to establish the Earth to cause the inheritance inherit the desolate inheritance Isaiah chapter 9 and verse 6 familiar to you for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall come upon his shoulder and his name shall be called the be called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace Isaiah 7 and verse 14 we know a prophet is a Seer he's the Divine interpreter of the word amen and regardless of whether it happens today or it happens 400 years from now Isaiah 7 in verse 14 I'd like for you to read this with me therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel amen Give the Lord a great big hand right [Applause] there this is a long quote but it's been one one of my favorite quotes throughout my My Life Is Knowing the message brother brandham is speaking in Mary's belief and he begins and he almost gives it a history and you actually feel like you're watching a movie and as they as it was as the custom would would set out there and they would look at a little house and plan just how the Roses would be at at the spot and the gate must must be a little heart because they were so in love and they would be planning on on it and because of Joseph being a carpenter he could take his time and and then perhaps just behind the house there was going to be a a carpenter shop and where he would do all of his cabinet work and to make his doors and the little odds and ends that would be brought to him and in that they would have their livelihood and this is Sunday and as soon as they had came out or the Sabbath and sat on the front door of the midday meal it must have been Joseph that said that was a striking message this morning Mary Mary I'm so thrilled when I heard our Rabbi speak of the greatness of Jehovah and oh how he told us of of what that Great Mighty God it came down in Egypt and took our people out and how he opened up the Red Sea and when it got in his way and how he rained bread out of heaven and blowed the quals out of the field and led the pillar of Fire by night and A Cloud by day and how the children of Israel camped under this great light and as he walked in the light wherever it went they went also and they brought him them safety into a Promised Land Mary might have said something like this yes darling I want to ask you something what happened to that great God he isn't just the same great today as he was then did you notice the rabbi after that wonderful message and then Al last he said Jehovah mus he turned his back on us because that he doesn't perform Miracles anymore but Joseph quickly picked it up and said but Mary I believe that God is just as great and is as powerful as he ever was amen and upon that Mary's mother Anna must have come to the door and said are you young folks waiting for the scriptures and handed them a handed into the hand of Mary which passed it on to Joseph the book of Isaiah and Joseph opened the scroll and begin to read when he came to Isaiah 9 and6 unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name Shall be Called counselor the Prince of Peace the Mighty God the Everlasting father and of his peace and of his kingdom there shall be no end it must have been about that time that Mary's heart felt strangely warned isn't it strange how God does these things the scriptures made manifest she said Joseph and he looked at her and perhaps he always thought she was the most beautiful woman that he ever saw but then there was a certain look in her face that Charmed him more than ever don't you like that and while her eyes pretty eyes looked at him like that like a dove saw soft and innocent and I think that's the way a woman should look innocent and soft and sweet she said Joseph what was the prophet speaking of when he said unto us a child is born unto us a son is given who is this son and and this child that he was speaking of and Joseph looked back to her and must have said well my dear the prophet was speaking of the coming Messiah the hope of Israel and you know Mary that all down Through the Ages since Moses we've looked forward to that one coming and and when he comes he will deliver us out of the hand of bondage and of these Romans and out of the bondage of our sins and Israel will know their God and he will keep his word and and Mary my dear if we don't see him in our gener generation we shall surely be here for the next but but we'll look for him in our generation all night she just couldn't sleep over that unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the next morning she'd sleep late and you said brother Ron is brother Brown just making something up well was he making something up in the Garden of [Music] Eden was he making something up that Mary had blonde hair and how beautiful that she was and was he really making something up when he said I watched them walk out of the Garden of Eden in the last service amen so let's just take it and all night she couldn't sleep over it unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and then nor next morning she she slept late so she was late getting to the well and that's why the sun was up and and as she made her way down the certain Street seemed to like no one was around and she was thinking on the scripture and it's usually when you're you're thinking I believe that's the reason people doesn't have the victory in the heart that they should have is because that their thoughts are on other things he comes to another place and he says now the Virgin Mary when the angel Gabriel met her and told her that she was going to have a baby and without knowing a man and he goes never been she never leaned on her own understanding that a that a woman could not have a baby without having her husband she didn't lean upon that but she said behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to your word she didn't say how am I going to do it and then and and when we'll do it but how is this going to take place the angel said the Holy Ghost shall overshadow thee and thou and that Holy thing will be born of thee and shall be called The Son of God and she said behold the handmade of the Lord she didn't take her reasoning saying it couldn't be done she just said behold the handmade of the Lord that's right now notice he comes to another spot now Gabriel will announce the second coming the sound of the trumpet of God the dead in Christ shall rise then he says give us more Marys around here that can take the word that God at his word and praise him whether you feel anything or not take him at his word God's trying to find somebody who will take him at his word I don't care how you feel another place I hope this is okay she never waited till she felt life she never waited for anything positive the his word was enough for her she started right on her way rejoicing saying and testifying and she was going to have a baby before any visible sign appeared that's the way a real believer takes God at his word and starts testifying and giving God's praise as soon as soon as you can settle on that fact that God said so that's what makes the difference God said so Hallelujah don't you love it just take him at his word now remember no sensation was there no sensation was there be it unto me according to thy work now remember this is different than when she got the Holy Ghost she was getting pregnant when she got the Holy Ghost she was in the upper room with 119 other people and she came out of the upper room staggering and speaking in tongues yeah brother brandom said now if Mary had to get the Holy Ghost you're going to have to have the Holy Ghost that oldfashioned new birth we got to have it we don't want some stillborn children are you with me now we don't want some churchianity and and some kind of a intellectual Christ we want God to live in our lives he says now so you see Jesus was God that ought to settle it he was not the third person or the fourth person even the second person he was the person he was God he was Emmanuel God came down from Glory revealed himself I love that story Booth clber would write would be gray that beautiful hymn as as sister Karen would sing this would be her last song that she would sing Karen puit down from his glory ever living story my God and savior came and Jesus was his name born in a manger to his own a stranger a Man of Sorrows and tears and Agony oh what a condensation condens bringing us Redemption when in the dead of night not one faint hope in sight God precious tender laid aside his Splendor stooping to woo to save my soul oh how I love him how I adore him my breath and my sunshine my all in all the great Redeemer became my savior the great Creator became my savior and all God's fullness dwelleth in him that's the one that met the requirement Grace produced the person of Jesus Christ we find out this book now God stretched his tent and came came from God and became a man he changed his strain he from the almighty to be a man to take on the form of man so he could die to redeem man and bring us back to God again there it is there is the Redeemer Christ has redeemed us now we are now redeemed but he has he has not claimed his possessions yet now you might differ with that but just to hold on a minute he said and we'll see he hasn't claimed it and if he took the book of redemption everything that Adam had and everything that he lost Christ redeems back why did it have to be a virgin birth to redeem all the way back to Adam if it was sex in the Garden of Eden he had to redeem that sin he had to redeem that sin and when God stood there with Adam and the serpent there's going to be imetry between the seeds that ought approve the serpent seed right there you don't need no more than that it wasn't an apple it wasn't an [Applause] apple God had to come become virgin it wasn't part Mary and part God it was all God God needed a womb to be born inside of listen God didn't search the Earth to find out where Mary was he knew where she was he knew the hour that she would be born she had no idea that she would carry the Messiah God elected her to be the mother of God that she would be the incubator to carry our Lord Jesus Christ that's right we had no idea for many years we walked and something strange moved inside of us and sin just couldn't satisfy us but there was something calling us to another realm that's right he took the book of redemption and everything that Adam had and everything that he lost Christ redeems it back he canot until the time appointed and then will the Resurrection come and then the Earth will be renewed again and then he'll take possession his possession which he got when he redeemed us but we'll do it notice how this Prophet says but it will do it at the appointed time brother Kelly sent me this quote actually I'm wearing Brother Kelly's tie that he sent me me now the first thing God this was God Jesus was God in the form of man amen that's hard for people to swallow even today that he was God that's what he was he wasn't nothing less than God he was God manif ested in flesh he was the creator in his own creation he was the creator in his own creation and by the creation for the creation he was the creator in his own creation he said all winds right back into God the whole thing he says don't you see it it's the fullness of God he was the creator in so much that he was God and he was a being on the earth and a being of time which means that he must had a beginning therefore he created himself a body to live in God himself created a body for himself amlu himself created a body for himself that by his creation he may Save The Lost creation that he had created now I want to I want to just stop there just for a moment you say well brother Ron I don't know about God creating himself a body he created a pillar of fire to be in he created a cloud to be in he created a will within the middle of a will to be in he took a zigzag lightning and stepped into a body and came and visited three men in a furnace of fire Moses saw him not just in a pillar of fire or in a burning bush but he said and Moses always desired to see God and God stepped into a body and let him see himself as a man didn't even let him see his face but saw the hinder parts of a man God came in the form of MDC in a body and ate meat and drank milk are you with me now God comes in this building and buildings like this all over the world as a wind he comes as a presence he comes as a pillar of fire he comes as an angel here he is Among Us he comes as a warm presence to [Applause] you as you said last night bumping into an angel Hallelujah that was a quote you're not just was saying it off of your cuff that's a quote you might ask her she's not in the who's who she's not a priest's daughter she's not in some great wealthy royal family her come on you her you now why a Satan fight you so hard I want to come back and get that why does Satan fight you so so hard no doubt just as as soon as the testimony was going forth Satan went to work to discredit the testimony why he is allowed to be in another dimension to watch the light the angel come from the portals of glory and come and visit with Mary not only Mary saw him but the devil saw him and he knew if that angel was coming to that virgin girl then the Prophecies of the word was getting ready to happen because it had never happened before let's just say this her first testimony created life a dead baby in the womb the first testimony his name Shall be Called Jesus there'll be no room in the N there will be no Cathedral to be birthed in no high priest will be there to give honor to the baby being born the dignitaries of the city will be nowhere to be found that's right what was it brother Ron God hiding himself no doubt the manger that was B built he never had any thought no doubt not even registered animals was inside of that Barn Bloodlines no doubt was just simple animals but you notice who visited Shepherds brother random said why did it have to be Shepherds because they would feel comfortable in a barn God loves to come to your home to these churches where he feels comfortable I want Jesus to be comfortable where we're at I just really don't like being at a place to where that I have to seem to put on an air or kind of have to step out of my level I don't like those kind of things I'm not real comfortable with dignitaries or higher lifted UPS I I like being with the children of God I I really like that now if I like that and you like that it must be from our father that's what he likes now notice he says it bypassed the Nobles of the land it bypassed the Nobles and was revealed to the nobody all the Nobles that were that were so decorated with their great doctor's Divinity and psychology and highly educated and great Cathedrals and things it was all bypass and revealed to no bodies the wisdom the infinite wisdom of almighty God did it to make known to them the greatest message that ever was the Messiah is is now on the earth oh I love that what a wisdom could only come from God who knows wisdom all the wisdom and all the schooling and everything was now laid to waste and bypass the greatest wisdom of God and brother bran preaches that and why it had to be Shepherds now we too have met an angel we too have met an angel Revelation 10 and verse 7 but not only Revelations 10 and verse 7 but Revelations 10 and verse one two angels on the earth at the same time the seventh messenger and Christ himself that's right now the sabath messenger had to leave the scene but Revelations 10:1 didn't leave yes and he is here to see the work to be finished he is here on the quietest service he is here on the loudest service and I'm not just saying that to our church but I'm saying it to every message Church never let us take a service for granted never let us walk in and just sit down and say entertain me but every service is drawing us closer to the Divine promise and we too want to say be it unto me are you getting it be it unto me according to Thy word as I just said all of our belief comes to one testimony now the message is always also also like that we believe that brother brandham was in a cave and as he was in a cave and he was praying about certain things that a man about six foot tall Olive complexion hair down to his shoulders and he walked in and he said he was sent from the presence of almighty God fear not amen and he began to tell him of his commission and brother Brandon began to give him excuses of you know he couldn't see himself he's going to preach around the world and are you with me now brother Ron do you believe that with all your hearts amen with everything that's within me you say well brother Ron I don't know if I can believe that I I just don't know well can you believe Mary can you believe Mary and here's a seventh here's a seventh Church AE messenger telling us how the angel came to me I was a little boy I was seven years old dad was listening to the tape how the angel came to me the presence of God filled my little bedroom where I was laying listen to the messenger and as I was laying in this little room I would say that that little room you couldn't fit that Pano in that little room but I'll tell you that little room was F filled with the presence of God my dad heard me crying and he came in and he said Ron did you hear that the angel came to brother brandom in a cave and he told me these words he said that same angel that we're listening to on the tape is in your room right now on I feel him right now brother Brandon was instructed to go to to a mountain and there he would get the seals at one point he thought it was his death now listen he went to a mountain that thousands of people had went to and he was visited by those angels and a cloud would appear let me just say I don't have it up I I don't I don't have my seal book with me but that seal book didn't have to be edited when it came home it didn't have to be edited when it came home he would preach God hid and and revealed in Simplicity and then the breach between the church ages and the seals and then he would stand there night after night even declaring I don't know what tomorrow night's seal will be like I don't know it myself but he would repeat it in every service he came to me today the same one are you with me now I'm not ashamed to preach this he came to me he opened the book this book is not close to us now we're not just presuming we're not just presuming here we're not gessing at it we're not looking at it a theological book the same author that's written this book has called you out and brought you out it's that angel that even is Among Us now now I come to a very important spot he wants to be born in your heart he's calling you to be not just a church but the bride it isn't that you called yourself that he called you that and he's waiting on a response many of you responded 50 years ago many of you been been Believers for such a long time and you went be it unto me according to Thy word amen now here's where the humanity comes in no doubt immediately when Mary left this visitation Satan started working did you work on her flesh no doubt he works on your flesh immediately whether it's an altar or your bedroom or whereever you're at trying to cause you to doubt to doubt the word to doubt your experience but you begin to testify no the world wasn't there when it happened you wasu and you know that you know that you know it was him it wasn't you it was him but you responded I need that I believe that's you father come into my heart excuse me you won't get it this far away what a condensation sension that God made when Adam fell God began to work his way toward the earth I won't be much longer but I want you to catch these things and he began to show himself in every Prophet Noah you could see God in Noah and God through Noah built an ark you could see God in job the oldest book of the Bible and regardless of what Temptation he trusted God you could see God in Abraham you could see God in Moses you could see God in Jeremiah you could see him in David in all of his nonsense you could see him in David you could see God in Solomon you could see God in Jeremiah Nehemiah nahome you could see God I'm talking about you can see God I I hope that you can see God and each other sure you can see fleshly manifestations and you see failures and you get disappointed in one another you get disappointed in yourself can we all say Amen at the same time I'm not pointing at other people you can see you can see Humanity you get disappointed in your flesh you get disappointed in the thoughts that go through your mind amen amen you get disappointed in the words that even you say to your spouse and you go oh man amen how did that happen we're Christians we're Holy Ghost filled and you can have a whole week and all of a sudden two minutes who caused that who caused that God didn't cause that my dad said they never had an argument I don't want to call my dead father a liar but I live there my mother would he would pick on her so much until my mother would get enough of it and my mother was not a weightlifter but she was quite Stout and when she got enough of it she'd take a broom to my [Applause] dad she would pick my little old daddy up that weighed about 160 PBS and she'd pick my mother's arms were like this and she'd pick him up put her on her head and do one of those ta those Texas ta tail spins I saw her carry him all the way around our trailer [Applause] running Connie don't do that to me I'm losing weight so don't you do that to me what does all of that tell us we want a body change oh yeah and the god that you feel that Warmness that you feel that presence of God that feel like you could take a Rapture at any moment you want this body you want this body not just our soul that has already been raptured into his presence you want this body to get a change yes you look in the mirror you're you're young now but you look in the mirror one day and all of a sudden it's gray you need glasses and you feel the aches and you feel the pains and iqo more than ever before need a body change now I want you to just notice Mary now is not under the influence of a rabbi she's under the influence of an Angel Joseph is the first one that she will tell and he will have an incredibly difficult time believing her so matter of fact he in his own mortal flesh will begin to think things brother Doug of putting her away privately that's right he's a very righteous man and this is a difficult saying he's read it in the scriptures but now it's happened in his home it's happened in his home no doubt some of your families said nope I don't believe that but you didn't walk away it only rooted your testimony only deeper because you knew people may have made fun of you but it only rooted your your testimony deeper you hung on to the word when Satan offered you an easier way you byass hundreds of churches sure you do but there's something here that feed your soul and you go out of this building and you get in your car and there's special parts of the service that is so real to you that is so real to you that anchors it doesn't matter how far it doesn't matter what the trouble is but there's so I'm not just talking to them I'm talking to you too it doesn't matter but if you're looking for every if you're looking for that one part of the service that goes that's for me now I want you to just notice now Mary testifies to Joseph and Joseph has a supernatural experience and an angel comes to him when she tell testifies to Elizabeth Elizabeth has a supernatural experience and the baby is has come to life and it's been dead she's never felt it kick and immediately when this testimony comes there's a result that happens now I'm coming to an end there's a result that happens and immediately she responds my soul doth magnify the Lord and life happens inside of her and Mary believes this Angel's words and she hasn't been with Joseph but the words of that testimony now begin to cause a Happening Now begin to cause a happening her Rob begins to get tighter where she feeding that baby from from this cursed Earth the food that she's eating from this cursed Earth that was cursed since Adam's flaw God was allowing her to eat that out of the ground because he was not going to just redeem mankind but he was going to redeem this cursed [Applause] Earth the word be to show on her that's when the pressure really got on God didn't Peck you because you were some panty waste Christian he picked you cuz he knew that regardless of the pressure that would come on you and the questions out
