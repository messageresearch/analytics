[37:53] sister betty i i i hope it's okay but i
[37:57] want to
[37:58] you know i don't never say hello in two
[38:00] minutes so
[38:02] but her husband was quite a friend of
[38:06] mine
[38:07] and he was kind of one of those friends
[38:09] that uh
[38:10] you knew when you were buddies with him
[38:13] and uh
[38:15] i had the honor to speak his funeral
[38:19] and terry was a real friend he let me
[38:22] hunt in his tree stand
[38:24] and i don't think he let hardly anybody
[38:26] else hunt in his tree stand but he let
[38:28] me hunt in these streets dan
[38:32] we became buddies
[38:35] and i knew that there was just a little
[38:37] something lacking in
[38:39] in his life and we were at the camp
[38:42] meeting and
[38:43] i believe it was two years ago is that
[38:47] correct
[38:49] and it was i had made the statement that
[38:52] you know if god will move even if he has
[38:56] to move behind the curtain
[38:58] and as i as i spoke that evening
[39:02] uh sister charnick got healed
[39:05] we prayed for her and a few others
[39:08] but there really wasn't a great stir in
[39:11] the open audience
[39:13] and i just i just stepped behind the
[39:16] curtain and when
[39:16] matthew was attending to me and and as
[39:19] as as i was maybe brother alden as well
[39:23] and as i stepped behind the curtain i
[39:25] went behind those big curtains
[39:27] and just when i did i felt that world of
[39:30] wind come
[39:32] and i turned and i prayed for
[39:35] nathaniel and sister caitlin
[39:38] and they were childless and was had
[39:41] great issue with that
[39:42] and god just spoke a word to them
[39:45] and then little charlie was born almost
[39:48] exactly a year later
[39:51] amen and we're so thankful for that what
[39:53] a miracle that was
[39:55] then another one and then another one
[39:57] and then there was brother dwayne
[39:59] jackson that had been struggling with a
[40:01] call
[40:01] for 17 years and god speaks directly to
[40:05] him
[40:06] and then brother guido was standing
[40:08] there and brother guido is
[40:10] is standing and he's just as he's
[40:12] standing there and
[40:14] i i remember the prayer that i prayed
[40:16] for him they've told a lie on you guido
[40:19] and they've come against you but
[40:22] god will handle that now guido i see a
[40:26] train coming for you
[40:28] and it'll be okay for you to get on and
[40:31] brother guido
[40:32] just throwed his hands in the air
[40:36] and he grabbed me up and he began to
[40:38] speak in
[40:39] in another language and and uh it was
[40:42] just an incredible moment
[40:44] when i whirled around i turned and terry
[40:47] was standing there
[40:49] tears was running out of his eyes and he
[40:51] said i can serve a god like that
[41:00] it was a moment for me and i grabbed
[41:04] terry and
[41:04] we begin to pray as we begin to pray
[41:07] the spirit of god fell on him
[41:12] and i believe the testimony is he was
[41:14] different from that second
[41:17] don't have to have a thousand people
[41:20] just you and god
[41:25] and i believe tonight terry's waiting on
[41:27] us

[43:10] i'm thankful for what god did in
[43:12] gabriel's life this year
[43:15] when i was having my brain tumor taken
[43:17] out
[43:18] the next day he came into the room to be
[43:21] with me
[43:22] and the room was full and he wanted a
[43:25] word with me
[43:26] and that room just emptied
[43:30] you know everybody had a reason to leave
[43:32] and it just
[43:33] emptied and when it emptied
[43:36] i was able to deal with him and he's
[43:39] never
[43:40] been the same amen

[43:57] yeah brother branham teaches us a man
[44:00] chooses a wife to reflect his character
[44:04] and you're a real lady
[44:07] and so now we get to see the inside of
[44:09] gabriel
[44:12] what he was looking for all along
[44:15] brother branham says that we step out of
[44:17] eternity
[44:18] into a space of time
[44:23] and we'll spend time here together and
[44:26] then one day we'll step back into
[44:28] eternity
[44:30] again so we're beginning to see the
[44:34] reflections of god
[44:36] in your life and you've taken a step
[44:39] forward and
[44:41] you were introduced and you came through
[44:43] that phase and you found there there was
[44:45] a lot of things that you liked about
[44:46] each other
[44:48] and now you've chosen to spend the rest
[44:50] of your lives together
[44:53] but we never want to do it without god
[44:56] and so today we're going to ask god to
[44:59] bless your engagement
[45:00] in a public way jesus we
[45:04] love you with all of our hearts

[1:08:26] john 11 25 jesus said unto her
[1:08:29] i am the resurrection and the life
[1:08:32] he that believeth in me though he were
[1:08:35] dead
[1:08:36] yet shall he live and whosoever liveth
[1:08:39] and believeth in me
[1:08:40] shall never die believe us thou this
[1:08:44] and then if you turn with me to
[1:08:45] ephesians chapter one
[1:08:48] i'm sorry ephesians chapter two verse
[1:08:49] one
[1:08:51] and you hath he quickened who were dead
[1:08:55] in trespasses and sins wherein in time
[1:08:58] past he walked according to the course
[1:08:59] of this world
[1:09:00] according to the prince of the power of
[1:09:02] the air
[1:09:04] the spirit that now worketh in the
[1:09:06] children of disobedience
[1:09:07] among whom we also also we all had our
[1:09:10] conversation
[1:09:12] in times past in the lust of our flesh
[1:09:14] fulfilling the desires of the flesh
[1:09:16] and of the mind and we're by nature the
[1:09:19] children of wrath even as others
[1:09:21] but god who is rich in mercy for his
[1:09:24] great love wherewith he loved us
[1:09:26] even when we were dead in sins hath
[1:09:29] quickened us together
[1:09:31] with christ by grace you are saved
[1:09:34] and hath raised us up together and made
[1:09:37] us sit together
[1:09:38] in heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:09:42] amen let's bow our heads and our hearts
[1:09:43] to him the gracious heavenly father
[1:09:46] we truly thank you lord jesus for this
[1:09:48] opportunity father lord to come in your
[1:09:49] presence this evening father
[1:09:51] we thank you lord jesus for your
[1:09:52] presence that's already here father lord
[1:09:54] and
[1:09:55] we just want to submit ourselves to you
[1:09:56] father lord one more time
[1:09:58] i pray o god that you forgive us of our
[1:10:00] sins i pray that you help me oh god to
[1:10:02] get out of the way speak through me
[1:10:03] hear through your people or that
[1:10:05] together father we'll give you all the
[1:10:06] praise honor and glory
[1:10:08] we love you lord and commit ourselves in
[1:10:10] this service into your hands in jesus
[1:10:12] christ's name
[1:10:12] amen god bless you you're seated
[1:10:15] with the help of the lord i'd like to
[1:10:17] title this sermon
[1:10:18] the voice of your resurrection
[1:10:22] i would like to make this very very
[1:10:24] personal because we know that salvation
[1:10:26] is a very personal affair we don't go in
[1:10:30] together as a group we don't go together
[1:10:31] by association we don't go in because of
[1:10:33] who our parents are
[1:10:35] we don't not we don't who our parents
[1:10:38] are what family background we come from
[1:10:39] does not put us
[1:10:40] in the body of christ and it doesn't
[1:10:42] take us out of the body of christ aren't
[1:10:44] you thankful for that
[1:10:45] romans 8 11 says but if the spirit
[1:10:49] of him that raised up jesus from the
[1:10:51] dead dwell in you
[1:10:52] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:10:55] shall also quicken your mortal bodies
[1:10:58] by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[1:11:02] that's one of the biggest ifs in the
[1:11:03] bible if
[1:11:05] the spirit of christ that raised up
[1:11:08] if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:11:10] jesus from the dead dwell in you
[1:11:12] it'll also quicken your mortal body so
[1:11:14] the voice of god
[1:11:16] is the word of god jesus said that my
[1:11:19] sheep hear my voice and a stranger
[1:11:21] they will not follow so it's important
[1:11:24] that as the word goes in every service
[1:11:26] that you that you understand that is god
[1:11:29] speaking through the chosen vessel and
[1:11:31] you must receive it as the word
[1:11:33] because if you receive it as just the a
[1:11:35] brother standing here and speaking his
[1:11:37] opinion you won't get anything
[1:11:39] but if you receive it as the word of the
[1:11:41] lord you'll get the reward of the word
[1:11:43] that's being said
[1:11:45] you'll receive the promise because the
[1:11:46] word is the seed brother jim and
[1:11:48] whenever the word is planted in your
[1:11:50] heart and you receive it
[1:11:52] it will then bring forth what that seed
[1:11:54] is
[1:11:55] if you get a peach seed and it's not a
[1:11:57] hybrid seed and you plant it in the
[1:11:59] ground
[1:12:00] a peach tree will grow up you take the
[1:12:03] spoken word of god which is the original
[1:12:05] seed
[1:12:06] into your soul and the word will come
[1:12:08] out
[1:12:09] if you need healing take that part of
[1:12:11] the word into your soul
[1:12:13] if you need deliverance take that part
[1:12:15] of the word into your soul
[1:12:16] it doesn't matter what you have need of
[1:12:18] you take that spoken word
[1:12:20] into your heart and it'll bring forth
[1:12:22] the promise of god
[1:12:24] in first peter 1 18 for as much as ye
[1:12:26] know
[1:12:27] that you are not redeemed with
[1:12:28] corruptable things as silver and gold
[1:12:30] from your vain conversation
[1:12:32] received by the tradition from your
[1:12:34] fathers but with the precious blood of
[1:12:36] christ
[1:12:37] as of a lamb without blemish and without
[1:12:39] spot
[1:12:40] who verily was foreign before the
[1:12:42] foundation of the world but was manifest
[1:12:44] in these times
[1:12:45] last times for you who by him do believe
[1:12:47] in god
[1:12:48] that god that raised him up from the
[1:12:50] dead and gave him glory that your faith
[1:12:52] and hope
[1:12:52] might be in god seeing that you have
[1:12:55] purified your souls and obeying the
[1:12:57] truth
[1:12:58] through the spirit unto unfeigned love
[1:13:00] of the brethren see that you love one
[1:13:02] another with a pure heart fervently
[1:13:04] being born again
[1:13:08] ye must be born again
[1:13:13] without being born again you will not
[1:13:16] see this resurrection
[1:13:18] without being born again you will not
[1:13:20] see a body change
[1:13:21] that's why jesus said you must be born
[1:13:24] again
[1:13:25] it's a requirement of every person god
[1:13:28] requires it
[1:13:30] not of corruptible seed but of
[1:13:31] incorruptible by the word of god
[1:13:34] which liveth and abideth forever so god
[1:13:37] deals with us gentiles as individuals
[1:13:40] god calls us we come into the world as
[1:13:42] as a sinner
[1:13:43] we come into this world with no hope for
[1:13:45] salvation but
[1:13:47] there there but there's within the
[1:13:49] inside of every
[1:13:50] well on the inside of every elected
[1:13:52] child of god
[1:13:53] is a seed is an eternal seed germ of god
[1:13:57] but it must be quickened you come into
[1:14:00] this world a sinner you come into the
[1:14:02] world with the with the desire for the
[1:14:03] things of the world
[1:14:04] so there must come a point where you
[1:14:06] hear the voice of god
[1:14:07] and the voice of god is directly to you
[1:14:10] and it becomes a personal resurrection
[1:14:17] now isaiah 49 says can a woman forget
[1:14:20] her suckling child
[1:14:22] you know satan many times tries to tell
[1:14:24] you that god has forgotten you
[1:14:25] satan many times tries to tell you that
[1:14:27] god doesn't hear your prayer
[1:14:29] isaiah says can a woman forget her
[1:14:30] suckling child that she should not have
[1:14:32] compassion on the son of a womb
[1:14:34] yea they may forget yet i will not
[1:14:37] forget thee
[1:14:39] behold i have graven thee upon the palms
[1:14:41] of my hands
[1:14:42] thy walls are continually before me
[1:14:46] whenever you hear the term that you've
[1:14:48] heard your name we've got to hear
[1:14:49] our name being called when adam and eve
[1:14:52] fell in the beginning they heard god
[1:14:54] running after them saying adam adam
[1:14:57] where arthel
[1:14:58] when the word is being preached and you
[1:15:00] feel the conviction in your heart
[1:15:02] that is god calling out your name
[1:15:04] because where the bride of christ is not
[1:15:06] beaten to submission the bride of christ
[1:15:09] is corrected out of love
[1:15:11] so when the word comes forth and it
[1:15:13] sometimes can cut you it can sometimes
[1:15:15] step on your toes
[1:15:16] but it's god's love it's his correction
[1:15:18] to you
[1:15:20] and that is god speaking directly to you
[1:15:24] that is a revelation that you must grab
[1:15:26] when the word is coming forth
[1:15:27] you must reach out and grab the promise
[1:15:29] of god that is your way of hearing adam
[1:15:32] adam where art thou
[1:15:33] when the word is speaking and you feel
[1:15:35] that conviction in your heart
[1:15:37] that is god speaking to you
[1:15:40] don't shun that away when you feel that
[1:15:43] inclination toward god that's god
[1:15:45] satan's not going to put that
[1:15:46] inclination in your heart satan will try
[1:15:48] and get you to run
[1:15:50] but whenever you feel the conviction
[1:15:52] conviction is a blessing
[1:15:54] conviction is a wonderful thing people
[1:15:56] hear the word of god and it does nothing
[1:15:57] for them
[1:15:58] people some people's conscience are
[1:16:00] seared
[1:16:01] so if you still have a desire for god in
[1:16:04] your heart
[1:16:04] and if you're in this church tonight
[1:16:06] that means you must have a desire for
[1:16:07] him
[1:16:08] so when you hear the conviction of the
[1:16:10] word as the word is coming forth and
[1:16:12] you're feeling a prick in your heart
[1:16:13] don't bury that
[1:16:16] listen that is the voice of god to you
[1:16:19] calling
[1:16:20] out to you and he's calling your name
[1:16:23] don't wait for a literal your literal
[1:16:25] earthly name being called
[1:16:27] that is why when the bible says
[1:16:28] whosoever will
[1:16:30] that's so much more wonderful than
[1:16:32] saying your name to your earthly name
[1:16:34] because whosoever will surely means you
[1:16:38] so jesus can never forgive you forget
[1:16:41] you i'm sorry jesus can never forget you
[1:16:42] he knows right where you are
[1:16:44] jesus wants to forgive you satan is
[1:16:47] trying to get you to run
[1:16:48] but jesus is trying to draw you
[1:16:52] so it's impossible to meet god without
[1:16:54] there being some sort of resurrection
[1:16:57] lazarus could not stay dead in the
[1:17:00] presence of god
[1:17:02] one day jesus was going through a little
[1:17:04] city of nain and a widow
[1:17:06] she already lost her husband and she
[1:17:07] lost her only son and there was a
[1:17:08] funeral procession going down
[1:17:10] and jesus the very resurrection himself
[1:17:12] stepped on the scene and changed things
[1:17:15] because there can be no death in the
[1:17:18] presence of the
[1:17:19] of the tree of life or the prince of
[1:17:20] life
[1:17:22] so there was no choice but for that
[1:17:24] widow's son to raise
[1:17:26] from the dead zacchaeus was not a well
[1:17:29] thought of man
[1:17:30] in his day he was a tax collector
[1:17:33] he was a turn code and he would he would
[1:17:36] believe that people drive their money
[1:17:37] and actually charge them more taxes
[1:17:40] than what they really owed and he
[1:17:42] pocketed he would not you would not want
[1:17:44] him to be your tax man
[1:17:46] you would not want him to be your
[1:17:47] neighbor and you would not think very
[1:17:49] highly of zacchaeus but yet when he was
[1:17:50] in the presence of jesus he changed
[1:17:53] people didn't want anything to do with
[1:17:55] zacchaeus
[1:17:57] but yet he had a wife whose name was
[1:17:59] rebecca and rebecca never quit praying
[1:18:01] for him
[1:18:02] so your spouse may be wondering
[1:18:03] somewhere your spouse may not be here
[1:18:05] tonight your spouse may be backslidden
[1:18:07] but keep praying for them
[1:18:08] because the prayers of rebecca finally
[1:18:10] caught up
[1:18:12] to zacchaeus and he began to get stirred
[1:18:14] he couldn't sleep anymore so one day he
[1:18:16] got up and he wanted to see
[1:18:17] who jesus was for himself and he climbed
[1:18:20] in the tree and we know the story
[1:18:22] and that same that that prince of life
[1:18:25] came through and he's seen zacchaeus was
[1:18:26] well hidden
[1:18:28] and he said zacchaeus should come down
[1:18:29] today i'm going to your house
[1:18:31] and jesus wants to come to your house
[1:18:33] you may be hiding
[1:18:35] you may think you're hiding but jesus
[1:18:36] knows where you're at you may be hiding
[1:18:38] behind
[1:18:39] behind your talents you may be hiding
[1:18:42] trying to hide in the world you may be
[1:18:43] hiding in church
[1:18:45] people hide in church but jesus knows
[1:18:47] where you're at
[1:18:49] and jesus knows your spiritual condition
[1:18:52] so when you meet god you don't have a
[1:18:54] choice but to come to life
[1:18:56] there was even a dead stick in the old
[1:18:58] testament when aaron put his rod left
[1:19:00] his raw there in the in the
[1:19:01] tabernacle of witness a dead stick
[1:19:05] came to life it bloomed it bore
[1:19:08] almonds in the presence of the prince of
[1:19:11] life
[1:19:12] now there's a spiritual principle i want
[1:19:14] you to hold in mind
[1:19:17] everything always happens brother
[1:19:19] shannon
[1:19:20] in the spiritual first before you see it
[1:19:24] take place in the natural
[1:19:26] that's a spiritual principle throughout
[1:19:27] the entire scripture
[1:19:30] abraham had to believe god for that son
[1:19:32] first
[1:19:33] he had to receive it first in his heart
[1:19:36] and then the word then the actual son
[1:19:38] manifested
[1:19:40] that's how healing takes place you
[1:19:42] accept the word you believe the word you
[1:19:44] you claim your healing
[1:19:45] you profess your healing and then your
[1:19:47] body actually falls in subjection
[1:19:49] to the word that you've received but the
[1:19:51] healing takes place here
[1:19:53] when you come to god and you give your
[1:19:55] heart to the lord and he saves you
[1:19:57] it takes place first and there may still
[1:19:59] be some things hanging around
[1:20:01] but then people start seeing that
[1:20:03] difference
[1:20:04] you come to god and you get born again
[1:20:06] and he gives you the holy ghost
[1:20:08] it happens on the inside first and then
[1:20:12] the outward will line right up to it
[1:20:14] because people can try and line up the
[1:20:16] outward and the inside not be right
[1:20:18] seek ye first the kingdom of god then
[1:20:20] all these other things will be added
[1:20:22] unto you
[1:20:24] brother braham said in the message if
[1:20:25] god be with us then where is all the
[1:20:28] miracles that's a great question isn't
[1:20:30] it
[1:20:34] god is with us which is why we're seeing
[1:20:35] miracles
[1:20:37] he said you know just sound a trumpet
[1:20:38] don't shake that don't shake
[1:20:40] down a wall that you can run a chariot
[1:20:42] races around sounding a trumpet
[1:20:44] but god said he's speaking of joshua
[1:20:46] going around jericho just
[1:20:48] just march around the wall seven times
[1:20:50] and the last day march 7
[1:20:53] and 13 times as you go around the wall
[1:20:55] at the last time let the priest go
[1:20:57] with before with the ark and sound a
[1:20:59] trumpet and when the trumpet sounds
[1:21:01] the walls will shake down what do they
[1:21:03] do he saw the miracle of god
[1:21:06] after he acted on the word of god
[1:21:10] where is your miracles brother ram asked
[1:21:13] now here's a prophet of god who has seen
[1:21:15] countless miracles who could write
[1:21:18] volumes of books
[1:21:20] on the miracles that god has done
[1:21:22] through his ministry and he's asking the
[1:21:23] question where's your miracles
[1:21:26] he said act on his word first
[1:21:30] you act on his word first you cannot put
[1:21:34] the miracle before the word
[1:21:36] you put the word first and then the
[1:21:37] miracle follows
[1:21:40] always put the word first how could the
[1:21:43] walls
[1:21:43] be shook down and leave one little house
[1:21:45] standing at harlot's house
[1:21:46] because she acted on the word of god why
[1:21:50] did the rest of them die
[1:21:51] and she lived she acted on the word of
[1:21:54] god and she saw the miracle of god
[1:21:56] that's the way to find it act on the
[1:21:58] word
[1:21:59] confess you're healed when you don't
[1:22:01] feel healed confess you're saved when
[1:22:03] you don't feel saved
[1:22:04] confess the word then watch the miracle
[1:22:08] act
[1:22:08] happen confess the word and then you
[1:22:11] watch your body line up with that word
[1:22:14] claim your loved one saved and then
[1:22:16] watch them come in
[1:22:18] start praising him for your miracle now
[1:22:23] as you because in the mind of god you've
[1:22:24] already received it when you receive the
[1:22:26] word
[1:22:26] it's finished it's finished it doesn't
[1:22:30] matter if you don't see it when you
[1:22:31] receive the word
[1:22:32] and you receive the promise in your
[1:22:34] heart and you believe it that settles it
[1:22:38] abraham believed god for that son that
[1:22:41] is why when god told him to take him up
[1:22:42] on the mountain
[1:22:43] it might have challenged his humanity at
[1:22:45] one point but you see there in the
[1:22:47] scripture where he said
[1:22:48] you stay here he told the servants
[1:22:49] because i'm the latter going up
[1:22:51] and we're coming right back to you he
[1:22:54] didn't care if he had to kill isaac he
[1:22:55] knew that he'd already received him as
[1:22:57] one from the dead
[1:23:01] you think of the woman at the well in st
[1:23:02] john chapter four brother branham refers
[1:23:04] to her probably in his prayer lines as
[1:23:07] he's trying to get the people see it in
[1:23:08] the scripture because here's the
[1:23:09] important thing to always remember
[1:23:11] the message is the scripture made
[1:23:13] manifest
[1:23:15] it's not don't then in your mind the
[1:23:17] message is a manifestation of the
[1:23:19] scripture so it will be found in the
[1:23:21] scripture
[1:23:21] because it is the word of god so he
[1:23:23] would he would be he would dramatize and
[1:23:25] build the scene
[1:23:26] of saint john chapter 4 to get you to
[1:23:29] realize that it was the same
[1:23:31] messiah the same god on the platform
[1:23:34] with his prophet doing the same work
[1:23:38] so the woman at the whale when she was
[1:23:40] sitting there we all we're all very
[1:23:41] familiar with the story
[1:23:43] she's sitting there and she couldn't
[1:23:44] come when the honorable women came and
[1:23:46] she sat there but when jesus came and
[1:23:48] asked her for her drink
[1:23:49] she recognized the word made flesh
[1:23:53] she recognized the word made flesh first
[1:23:56] then after that after she received the
[1:23:59] word
[1:23:59] she then had a ministry to go tell she
[1:24:02] had a ministry to go tell
[1:24:03] the people of samaria come see a man
[1:24:06] who's told me all the things i've ever
[1:24:07] done
[1:24:08] isn't this the messiah
[1:24:12] so there's a ministry and she types the
[1:24:15] bride there's a ministry for the bride
[1:24:17] there's a ministry for you as an
[1:24:19] individual when you receive something
[1:24:20] you've got to tell somebody something
[1:24:24] it's quite interesting that she had five
[1:24:26] husbands jesus said
[1:24:27] she had five husbands and the one that
[1:24:29] she was living with was not hers
[1:24:32] but jesus was hers jesus was the seventh
[1:24:34] man
[1:24:36] jesus was the seventh and complete jesus
[1:24:39] completed her she had to look nowhere
[1:24:40] else when she found him
[1:24:42] you can try many things in life you can
[1:24:44] run anywhere you want you'll never find
[1:24:46] nothing
[1:24:47] to match him you'll never find a
[1:24:50] relationship you'll never find an amount
[1:24:51] of money you'll never find an amount of
[1:24:53] fame
[1:24:53] to match him
[1:24:57] so when she went home she was like
[1:24:58] legion she was a changed woman
[1:25:00] and the whole city was moved and stirred
[1:25:02] by her testimony
[1:25:05] in saint john 4 god is the spirit of
[1:25:07] jesus speaking and they that worship him
[1:25:09] must worship him in spirit and in truth
[1:25:11] the woman saith unto him i know that
[1:25:13] messiah cometh which is called christ
[1:25:16] when he is come he will tell us all
[1:25:17] things jesus said unto her
[1:25:20] i that speak unto thee am he
[1:25:23] now jesus one time told a bunch of
[1:25:25] religious people that i and my father
[1:25:27] are one
[1:25:28] and they reached down and picked up
[1:25:30] stones that are ready to kill them
[1:25:33] jesus tells this prostitute that i am he
[1:25:36] and she believes what is the difference
[1:25:39] you had religious people
[1:25:40] the prophet of god said the religious
[1:25:42] people were clean on the outside
[1:25:44] but the inside of them were black and
[1:25:46] smutty and sinful
[1:25:47] and here you had a woman that took that
[1:25:49] took a wrong choice in life
[1:25:51] and her body was not pure but she was
[1:25:54] redeemable on the inside
[1:25:56] because she was able to experience a
[1:25:57] resurrection when she heard the voice of
[1:25:59] the messiah
[1:26:01] she had an elected seed in her that came
[1:26:04] forth to life
[1:26:05] when the s-o-n shined on it you put the
[1:26:08] seed
[1:26:08] in nature you put a seed in the ground
[1:26:10] brother mark and when that that
[1:26:12] warm sunshine shines on it it has no
[1:26:14] choice but to come to life
[1:26:17] an elected son or daughter of god when
[1:26:20] they hear the word when they hear the
[1:26:22] sun shine the s-o-n shine the voice of
[1:26:24] god
[1:26:26] the voice behind the voice when it
[1:26:28] quickens them there's no choice but to
[1:26:30] come to life
[1:26:31] you're like you you we come to the world
[1:26:33] like dead sticks
[1:26:35] we're just walking through life dead but
[1:26:38] whenever we get in the presence of the
[1:26:40] sun
[1:26:42] we have no choice if we're an elected
[1:26:44] child of god but to come to life
[1:26:46] you may have people trying to hold you
[1:26:48] back you may have people that come
[1:26:49] against what you believe
[1:26:51] you may have some people that attack
[1:26:52] which you believe that people are
[1:26:53] attacking this message
[1:26:54] but you know the sun quickens the seed
[1:26:56] to life not rocks
[1:26:58] you can be surrounded by rocks but god
[1:27:01] has come to quicken the seed in you
[1:27:03] and when he speaks the word to you it
[1:27:05] causes a resurrection within you
[1:27:08] and it causes you to come to life it
[1:27:10] causes you to hear that eagle scream
[1:27:13] because of the sea that you have and it
[1:27:17] causes a resurrection within you
[1:27:19] whenever when your acquaintances might
[1:27:21] have just left it laying there
[1:27:23] because if it's what's on the inside and
[1:27:26] upon this
[1:27:26] came his disciples and marveled that he
[1:27:28] talked to the woman yet no man said what
[1:27:30] seeketh thou
[1:27:31] well i talk is doubt to her the woman
[1:27:33] then left
[1:27:34] her water pot and went her way into the
[1:27:36] city and said to the men
[1:27:38] come see a man which told me all things
[1:27:41] that ever i did is not this the christ
[1:27:46] the bride is saying come see the man
[1:27:48] christ jesus
[1:27:50] come see the man christ jesus speaking
[1:27:52] through his word
[1:27:54] there was another young lady that has
[1:27:56] had a visitation one time by the name of
[1:27:57] mary
[1:27:59] mary had a supernatural supernatural
[1:28:02] angelic visitation
[1:28:03] and she was just an average little girl
[1:28:05] she was just a teenager
[1:28:08] but mary became pregnant by the spoken
[1:28:12] word
[1:28:13] of an angel the spoken word of god by an
[1:28:16] angel
[1:28:17] she received the spoken word in her
[1:28:22] brother branham said in the church age
[1:28:24] book the word of promise
[1:28:25] came to the virgin mary but the word of
[1:28:28] promise
[1:28:29] was he himself to be made manifest
[1:28:34] god was made manifest he himself acted
[1:28:37] at that time
[1:28:38] and fulfilled his own word of promise in
[1:28:40] the virgin
[1:28:41] it was an angel that had brought her the
[1:28:43] message but the angel's message
[1:28:45] was the word of god isaiah 9 6 he
[1:28:49] fulfilled
[1:28:50] at that time all that was written of him
[1:28:53] because she
[1:28:54] accepted his word to her
[1:28:58] she believed the word of the angel she
[1:28:59] said be it unto me according to thy word
[1:29:02] do you know mary had to believe
[1:29:04] something that's never been done before
[1:29:07] she had to believe what the angel of the
[1:29:11] lord spoke to her
[1:29:13] that when she because faith cometh by
[1:29:15] hearing and she was that predestinated
[1:29:17] virgin to carry
[1:29:19] the body of god the body of the lord
[1:29:22] jesus
[1:29:23] and she believed the word and when she
[1:29:25] received it in the spiritual first
[1:29:28] then all of a sudden after about three
[1:29:29] months she started showing
[1:29:32] and a few more months went by and she
[1:29:33] started showing she couldn't quite cover
[1:29:35] it
[1:29:36] and and then people had realized
[1:29:40] that something had happened you receive
[1:29:43] you become pregnant with a word
[1:29:45] and people will notice
[1:29:48] and you know mary after she received the
[1:29:50] word this visitation of an angel she had
[1:29:52] a ministry
[1:29:54] she had a ministry when she went to
[1:29:56] visit her
[1:29:57] her cousin elizabeth who was pregnant
[1:30:00] with
[1:30:01] with jesus christ forerunner who hadn't
[1:30:03] moved and he was dead in her womb
[1:30:06] in luke 1 30 and luke 1 41 and it came
[1:30:10] to pass
[1:30:10] when elizabeth heard the salutation of
[1:30:13] mary
[1:30:13] the babe leaped in her womb and
[1:30:16] elizabeth was filled
[1:30:17] with the holy ghost
[1:30:21] mary became pregnant with the word of
[1:30:23] god and then went and told somebody
[1:30:26] and god spoke through her and quickened
[1:30:28] life to someone else where does the life
[1:30:29] come through it comes through the body
[1:30:32] the body of christ and there's people
[1:30:35] that try and say that the bride don't
[1:30:36] have a ministry she absolutely has a
[1:30:38] ministry
[1:30:39] there's two scripture examples right
[1:30:40] there where the bride had a ministry
[1:30:42] and life was transferred through the
[1:30:44] body by the power of the spoken word
[1:30:48] and elizabeth as soon as she heard the
[1:30:50] salutation of mary the babe in her womb
[1:30:52] leaped for joy
[1:30:56] and she was filled with a holy ghost and
[1:30:58] she spake out with a loud voice and said
[1:31:00] blessed art thou among women
[1:31:02] and blessed is the fruit of thy womb for
[1:31:04] whence is this to me that the mother of
[1:31:05] my lord should come to me
[1:31:07] for lo as soon as the voice of thy
[1:31:09] salutation sounded in my ears the babe
[1:31:11] in my womb
[1:31:13] the babe leaped in my womb for joy
[1:31:17] the power of the spoken word will bring
[1:31:19] you life
[1:31:21] no matter what condition you you're
[1:31:22] facing right now
[1:31:24] when the word goes forth you grab it
[1:31:26] right now don't wait till sunday don't
[1:31:28] wait till monday you grab it right now
[1:31:29] while it's passing by
[1:31:31] because when the word passes you by
[1:31:33] that's like jesus passing you by because
[1:31:34] he's the word
[1:31:36] so when that word passes by you reach
[1:31:38] out and grab it because it's for you
[1:31:42] how many times the prophets lament and
[1:31:44] say she's missing it oh god help her
[1:31:46] jesus christ was passing by that
[1:31:48] person's way and they let it go by
[1:31:50] don't let him go by your way without you
[1:31:53] touching him
[1:31:56] so the the power of the spoken word
[1:31:59] elizabeth received the holy ghost
[1:32:01] the john came to life by the testimony
[1:32:05] by the word that mary said
[1:32:07] and we find in the new testament why
[1:32:09] peter yet spake these words the holy
[1:32:11] ghost fell on them that heard the word
[1:32:13] you receive it while peter yet spake the
[1:32:16] words
[1:32:17] the holy ghost fell on them while
[1:32:20] brother so-and-so is speaking the word
[1:32:22] the holy ghost can fall on you
[1:32:24] while brother so-and-so is speaking the
[1:32:26] word you can get the holy ghost you can
[1:32:28] get your healing you can get deliverance
[1:32:30] while the word is going forth don't let
[1:32:32] it go by your way
[1:32:33] don't let it just pass hear your name
[1:32:36] being called
[1:32:37] recognize that it's you it's not your
[1:32:38] neighbor it's not it's for you
[1:32:42] it don't matter if you're in the living
[1:32:43] room it don't matter if you're on the
[1:32:44] internet it's for you
[1:32:45] receive it god's word don't know no
[1:32:48] distance
[1:32:51] you know zachariah six months before
[1:32:54] mary's visitation of the angel zechariah
[1:32:56] met the same angel
[1:32:57] but disbelieved and god took away his
[1:33:01] ability to speak because he didn't
[1:33:03] believe the word of an angel
[1:33:06] but mary six months later received a
[1:33:08] visitation from the same angel
[1:33:12] and said be it unto me according to thy
[1:33:13] word
[1:33:15] and she was able to speak life
[1:33:18] not of her own self but she had
[1:33:21] something within her
[1:33:22] that when she spoke out that quick in
[1:33:24] life
[1:33:27] and whether life is quickened to you by
[1:33:29] listening to a summer of the prophet
[1:33:30] or life is quick unto you in a church
[1:33:32] here in a minister preach
[1:33:33] it's the word of god to you it's the
[1:33:36] word of god to you
[1:33:39] when jesus was here on earth and he
[1:33:41] lived his life and he was crucified
[1:33:44] and they stuck that spear in his
[1:33:46] precious body
[1:33:47] and he cried out with a loud voice there
[1:33:50] was a resurrection that happened
[1:33:53] there was a resurrection that happened
[1:33:54] when jesus cried with a loud voice the
[1:33:56] bible says that the old testament saints
[1:33:58] that is why it was so important for them
[1:34:00] to be buried in jerusalem
[1:34:02] that's it was so important for them to
[1:34:03] be buried in israel is because that's
[1:34:05] where the messiah was coming
[1:34:07] so when he cried out with a loud voice
[1:34:08] that it's finished
[1:34:10] they they came out of the graves
[1:34:15] the grave cannot hold the body of jesus
[1:34:17] down and neither can the grave hold down
[1:34:18] the body the bride body of christ
[1:34:21] there are saints that are sleeping in
[1:34:22] the dirt there are saints
[1:34:24] that are still on the earth and jesus
[1:34:27] said in the beginning of our text
[1:34:29] that whether they're that when they're
[1:34:31] whether they're dead or alive
[1:34:33] he said i am direction the the i am the
[1:34:35] resurrection and the life
[1:34:37] he that believeth in me though he were
[1:34:38] dead yet shall he live and whosoever
[1:34:41] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[1:34:42] die
[1:34:44] but believe us thou this
[1:34:47] believe us thou this
[1:34:50] in romans 8 29 for whom he did for no
[1:34:53] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[1:34:56] to the image of his son
[1:34:58] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:35:00] many brethren
[1:35:01] whom whom moreover whom he did
[1:35:04] predestinate
[1:35:05] them he also called and whom he called
[1:35:09] them he also justified
[1:35:10] and whom he justified them he also
[1:35:13] glorified
[1:35:19] when that seed that's placed in you
[1:35:21] before the foundation of the world
[1:35:22] it's like a lily brother talks about the
[1:35:25] lily it's born
[1:35:26] it's in the very very bottom of the pond
[1:35:29] it's underneath the mud
[1:35:31] it's got to come through the mud and the
[1:35:33] muck and that dirty nasty pond
[1:35:36] and it's stretching out for the sun
[1:35:39] it's filling out for the sun but that
[1:35:42] seed can't be stopped
[1:35:45] and there's no choice all that the
[1:35:47] father has given me
[1:35:48] will come to me
[1:35:52] think about this you're in you're in
[1:35:53] god's hand
[1:35:55] and satan can't take you out
[1:35:59] you can't do nothing to take yourself
[1:36:01] out
[1:36:03] god called you and if you're elected and
[1:36:06] you have that seed in you and you're
[1:36:08] feeling the pull
[1:36:10] there's a word for you tonight to come
[1:36:12] forth
[1:36:13] there's a word for you tonight like when
[1:36:15] jesus stood and he's he put back them
[1:36:16] small shoulders
[1:36:18] and he said lazarus come forth
[1:36:21] the word is crying out to the elected to
[1:36:24] come forth
[1:36:25] come out of her my people because before
[1:36:29] there can be a natural resurrection
[1:36:30] there's got to be a spiritual
[1:36:32] resurrection
[1:36:32] those that are sleeping in the ground
[1:36:34] that are waiting on you and i
[1:36:36] they they were spiritually resurrected
[1:36:38] first in their life
[1:36:40] then god called them home and they're
[1:36:43] guaranteed a resurrection
[1:36:44] they're guaranteed not by man they're
[1:36:47] guaranteed by
[1:36:48] the god of heaven their resurrection
[1:36:51] just like those that are alive and
[1:36:53] remain are guaranteed a rapture
[1:36:57] but you got to have the token in your
[1:36:58] hand
[1:37:00] you can't go in the rapture without the
[1:37:01] token
[1:37:03] you cannot go in the rapture without
[1:37:05] being born again
[1:37:07] that is your token it doesn't matter
[1:37:10] what anybody else says
[1:37:11] you cannot get into the rapture without
[1:37:13] the token
[1:37:14] nobody can get you if you've got that
[1:37:16] token nobody can take you out of the
[1:37:18] rapture
[1:37:24] brother rem said now then here we are
[1:37:25] coming to a conclusion
[1:37:27] as the eternal logos god was manifested
[1:37:30] in the sun
[1:37:30] and in jesus dwelt all the fullness of
[1:37:32] the godhead bodily and that eternal one
[1:37:35] was the father manifest in flesh
[1:37:37] and thereby gain the title of son even
[1:37:39] so we
[1:37:40] eternal in his thoughts in our turn
[1:37:42] become the many members spoken word
[1:37:45] seed manifested in flesh
[1:37:51] and those eternal thoughts now manifest
[1:37:53] in flesh are the sons of god
[1:37:54] even as we are so called we do not
[1:37:57] become seed by rebirth
[1:38:00] now understand this because you are born
[1:38:03] again
[1:38:03] is not what made you a child of god you
[1:38:05] were a child
[1:38:06] of god which gave you the ability and
[1:38:09] what
[1:38:10] on the inside to hear the word and be
[1:38:12] born again
[1:38:15] that's the difference you were always
[1:38:18] a child of god but you had spiritual
[1:38:20] amnesia
[1:38:22] but you're always a part of god you are
[1:38:24] always in the mind of god
[1:38:26] because if you weren't in the mind of
[1:38:28] god at the beginning then you won't be
[1:38:29] at the end
[1:38:30] but if you were at them in his mind at
[1:38:32] the beginning there's nothing
[1:38:34] that that can happen to keep you from
[1:38:36] being there not a single thing not a
[1:38:38] single devil in hell
[1:38:39] not every devil in hell can keep you
[1:38:41] from being there on that day
[1:38:43] because in the mind of god you are
[1:38:45] already
[1:38:46] there already there so it don't matter
[1:38:50] what satan whispers in your ear
[1:38:51] nothing else matters it's what god seen
[1:38:54] of you
[1:38:55] at the very beginning earth is when you
[1:38:58] take a picture now it's not so much
[1:39:00] now so much more but back back in
[1:39:03] in the old days as they call it when
[1:39:05] they would take a picture they had to
[1:39:06] take it in the dark room to develop it
[1:39:09] to bring out what the picture was earth
[1:39:12] is like a dark room
[1:39:14] where it proves your predestination
[1:39:17] it proves your election you prove your
[1:39:20] election to the devil
[1:39:22] god called you before the foundation of
[1:39:25] the world
[1:39:26] he thought of you and he he he knows
[1:39:29] everything
[1:39:29] but he's not looking so much at where
[1:39:31] you're at now he's looking at the
[1:39:33] finished product
[1:39:35] that is why the holy ghost is given to
[1:39:37] you based on predestination
[1:39:38] because god looks at you now you look at
[1:39:41] yourself
[1:39:41] not how other people look at yourself he
[1:39:43] looks at you at the end and he says
[1:39:45] he was with me before time and he's
[1:39:47] going to be there at the very end
[1:39:50] what happens in between who your family
[1:39:52] is you can't help that
[1:39:54] who they're not don't matter what you do
[1:39:56] in life what kind of job you have
[1:39:58] all that doesn't matter what matters is
[1:40:00] that you are in the mind of god
[1:40:02] and that now you're here hearing the
[1:40:05] voice of god
[1:40:06] and it's causing a resurrection on the
[1:40:09] inside of you
[1:40:10] that's bringing you forth to life but
[1:40:12] it's doing nothing for the rocks out in
[1:40:14] the world
[1:40:16] in the flesh we're no different in the
[1:40:19] flesh we still enjoy the things of life
[1:40:21] in the flesh we still get hungry we
[1:40:22] still get thirsty
[1:40:25] but it's the soul that we're talking
[1:40:27] about
[1:40:28] that's what separates the bride from the
[1:40:30] church because i
[1:40:32] my testimony is i'm in the bride
[1:40:36] i'm in the bride god will have people
[1:40:38] good people good people like your
[1:40:39] neighbors
[1:40:41] that may not be sitting here and they're
[1:40:42] good people they'll give their shirt off
[1:40:44] your
[1:40:45] their shirt off their back if necessary
[1:40:48] they've done good things for you
[1:40:50] the good people god has a place for them
[1:40:53] the blood of jesus saves the blood of
[1:40:55] jesus goes in places we can't even
[1:40:56] imagine
[1:40:58] but here tonight brothers and sisters we
[1:41:00] want to be in the bride
[1:41:01] we don't want to go to the tribulation
[1:41:03] period we want to escape it
[1:41:08] one of my favorite scriptures second
[1:41:10] corinthians 5 17 therefore if any man
[1:41:13] be in christ he is a new creature
[1:41:17] all things are passed away behold all
[1:41:20] things
[1:41:21] are become new so every elected child of
[1:41:25] god
[1:41:26] were quickened by the word of their day
[1:41:29] i'll give you a little more detail if
[1:41:31] you sit right here tonight
[1:41:33] and you're elected and you have the holy
[1:41:35] ghost and it's a promise if you don't
[1:41:37] don't be discouraged it's a promise unto
[1:41:39] you
[1:41:40] it's a promise but if you're a believer
[1:41:44] a
[1:41:44] true believer of this message that god
[1:41:46] has sent
[1:41:47] if you would have lived in the days of
[1:41:49] noah there would have been nine souls on
[1:41:50] the ark
[1:41:52] it doesn't matter what age you're
[1:41:54] expressed you're an elected child of god
[1:41:57] and you would have heard the word for
[1:41:58] your day
[1:42:00] because you're a thought of god and a
[1:42:03] thought is a word expressed
[1:42:07] god's voice in every age and every
[1:42:09] church age messenger awaken
[1:42:11] quickened and resurrected the elect of
[1:42:14] that age
[1:42:15] why are we here why are we sitting here
[1:42:18] right now
[1:42:20] because god sent a prophet
[1:42:23] many of you
[1:42:26] are married to who you're married to or
[1:42:29] are going to be married to who you're
[1:42:31] going to be married to
[1:42:33] because god sent a prophet
[1:42:38] think about that that affects your whole
[1:42:41] life
[1:42:42] now some of you might have come in and
[1:42:44] already had your spouse after you heard
[1:42:45] the word and god had already arranged
[1:42:47] that
[1:42:48] but i'm trying to make the point how
[1:42:49] this word goes so much deeper and the
[1:42:51] influence of the word
[1:42:52] goes so much deeper than just your
[1:42:53] natural life than just every day and you
[1:42:55] don't really
[1:42:56] realize how much it governs our lives
[1:43:00] god then messengers are very important
[1:43:03] because they are god's light in each age
[1:43:06] and they're so important that in the
[1:43:08] book of revelation jesus
[1:43:10] jesus has them in his right hand seven
[1:43:13] stars
[1:43:14] in his right hand and each one is a
[1:43:18] messenger given to each age to call out
[1:43:21] and their message causes a resurrection
[1:43:24] it's it's a voice of the resurrection of
[1:43:26] the elect in that age
[1:43:29] and it gives them the new birth when
[1:43:30] they hear the word when they receive the
[1:43:32] word for their day
[1:43:34] they're sealed in the body of christ but
[1:43:36] under their messenger
[1:43:38] the bible also calls and his voice was
[1:43:41] as the voice of many waters
[1:43:45] so under each messenger you had god
[1:43:48] called men that were under the same
[1:43:50] anointing
[1:43:51] speaking and preaching the same word not
[1:43:53] going above the messenger
[1:43:56] but they're speaking the same word
[1:43:58] they're preaching the same thing we're
[1:43:59] preaching the same thing brother branham
[1:44:01] preached
[1:44:02] we're preaching everything that that's
[1:44:03] preached has got to be come out of the
[1:44:05] message has got to come out of the word
[1:44:07] has got to be found in this bible
[1:44:10] it's the same message that's being
[1:44:12] preached and i love how brother andrew
[1:44:14] last week mentioned that diamond
[1:44:16] he preached the word has been preached
[1:44:18] but sometimes you may be even hearing it
[1:44:19] tonight from a different angle
[1:44:21] tomorrow you hear from another angle
[1:44:22] it's the same word but it can whenever
[1:44:25] you
[1:44:25] feel it strike that's faith grab a hold
[1:44:28] of it
[1:44:31] so brother braham said that the voice of
[1:44:32] any waters is the voice of the ministers
[1:44:35] through the holy spirit
[1:44:36] that's cried out to the people in every
[1:44:39] age
[1:44:41] standing there god took his prophet home
[1:44:46] but yet the word is still going forth
[1:44:49] the word just like it was through mary
[1:44:51] is still going forth and it's bringing
[1:44:54] it's quickening life in the elected
[1:44:56] people
[1:44:58] the word is being preached it's the same
[1:45:01] message
[1:45:05] he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:45:08] what the spirit saith to the churches
[1:45:15] most every that has most everyone that
[1:45:17] has a normal birth
[1:45:20] have ears to hear but not
[1:45:23] everyone has got the ability to
[1:45:25] spiritually hear what the spirit says
[1:45:28] so if tonight you're sitting here and i
[1:45:31] trust that you are
[1:45:32] and you got the and you got the hunger
[1:45:34] in your heart to hear the word of god
[1:45:37] you are a very blessed people we're
[1:45:39] living in an age when people
[1:45:41] hate the truth they have no think of
[1:45:43] this they have no desire for the truth
[1:45:47] so what did the bible say because they
[1:45:49] have no dis they because they have no
[1:45:51] love for the truth god will give them
[1:45:52] over to a lie
[1:45:55] so what about this age what is
[1:45:59] the message
[1:46:02] that could be a sermon within itself
[1:46:03] what is the message
[1:46:07] the message is found from genesis to
[1:46:10] revelation
[1:46:11] the message is jesus christ
[1:46:14] the message is the supper invitation of
[1:46:16] luke 14.
[1:46:18] we don't have time to reel these
[1:46:19] scriptures so if you're taking notes
[1:46:21] just drop these scriptures down
[1:46:22] and go back and read but this but the
[1:46:25] the message
[1:46:26] is the supper invitation of luke 14. the
[1:46:29] message
[1:46:29] is the bridegroom call of matthew 25.
[1:46:34] that's the message right there while the
[1:46:37] bridegroom terry they all slumber and
[1:46:38] slept but at midnight
[1:46:40] there was a cry made behold the
[1:46:42] bridegroom cometh go yet to meet them
[1:46:45] that's what the message tells us behold
[1:46:47] jesus christ our bridegroom he cometh
[1:46:50] prepare yourself to meet him
[1:46:53] ephesians 5 14 wherefore he saith
[1:46:57] awake thou that sleepeth and arise from
[1:47:00] the dead and christ
[1:47:01] shall give thee light that's the message
[1:47:04] calling out to you
[1:47:06] and to me to come out
[1:47:09] to be quickened the message quickens us
[1:47:13] it brings us life in isaiah 60 arise
[1:47:16] shine for thy light has come that's the
[1:47:20] message
[1:47:22] and the glory of the lord is risen upon
[1:47:24] thee
[1:47:25] for behold the darkness shall cover the
[1:47:28] earth and grows darkness to people
[1:47:29] but the lord shall arise upon thee and
[1:47:32] his glory
[1:47:33] shall be seen upon thee
[1:47:36] so you have two conditions in the world
[1:47:38] at the same time
[1:47:40] you've got darkness and you've got light
[1:47:45] just like in just like in the first
[1:47:46] exodus you had darkness in egypt
[1:47:49] but you had light in goshen at the same
[1:47:53] time
[1:47:56] the message is the shout of first
[1:47:59] thessalonians chapter four
[1:48:02] brother ram clearly identified the shout
[1:48:05] as the message
[1:48:06] so when there's a shout that goes forth
[1:48:08] and i'm not going to shout
[1:48:11] but it's supposed to wake you up unless
[1:48:14] i see too many of you sleeping then i
[1:48:15] may
[1:48:16] but the shout is a message and it calls
[1:48:20] the the church to attention it calls the
[1:48:23] elected to the attention
[1:48:24] it calls them it calls them out
[1:48:28] because remember the rapture we refer to
[1:48:30] the rapture but the rapture is actually
[1:48:32] a process
[1:48:34] the rapture is the shout the voice and
[1:48:36] the trump
[1:48:37] so if the message is the shout if you're
[1:48:40] truly baptized
[1:48:41] into the body of christ brother jim and
[1:48:43] you're in the body of christ and you've
[1:48:45] accepted
[1:48:46] the word and it's it's given you a
[1:48:47] born-again experience
[1:48:49] then you're already in the rapture
[1:48:52] you're already in the shout and so those
[1:48:55] those
[1:48:56] saints and we no doubt most all of us
[1:48:58] have got have got
[1:48:59] loved ones that are resting and they are
[1:49:01] waiting
[1:49:03] and they're waiting for the for they're
[1:49:05] waiting on us and resurrection morning
[1:49:06] they're going to rise
[1:49:08] they've already partaken of the shout
[1:49:12] so they're going to hear the voice
[1:49:15] to raise up from the dead to raise up
[1:49:18] out of the ground
[1:49:21] so you can't miss it when you're a part
[1:49:24] of the shout
[1:49:25] you're going to be a part of the voice
[1:49:26] and you're going to be part of the trump
[1:49:28] you're going to be gathered around
[1:49:30] how can you really receive if you've got
[1:49:32] the token life of jesus christ in you
[1:49:34] you're going to be there it's guaranteed
[1:49:37] that you're going to be there it's not a
[1:49:40] good chance it's not
[1:49:41] more than likely you are guaranteed
[1:49:44] to be there because you're holding the
[1:49:46] token
[1:49:48] you're holding the token if you're just
[1:49:51] holding church
[1:49:51] that's no guarantee if you're just
[1:49:53] holding a doctrine that's not guaranteed
[1:49:56] if you're whole in the world that
[1:49:57] certainly ain't that's not guaranteed
[1:50:02] in fact that's the the only way
[1:50:06] to make it in this rapture because we're
[1:50:08] starting to see pre-tribulation things
[1:50:10] we're starting to see the world as it's
[1:50:12] gone and it doesn't matter
[1:50:13] what what your political conviction may
[1:50:16] be the best president of
[1:50:18] any of our lifetimes right here nothing
[1:50:21] changed morally because she rejected the
[1:50:23] truth
[1:50:25] there might have been a nice policy
[1:50:27] lower taxes or whatever it may be
[1:50:29] but morally speaking america has been on
[1:50:32] the decline
[1:50:34] since she rejected him since she
[1:50:37] rejected
[1:50:38] the truth she's been on the decline in
[1:50:41] the world the church world brothers and
[1:50:42] sisters they missed it
[1:50:44] they're calling for revival
[1:50:48] they're calling for america's best days
[1:50:50] is yet to come
[1:50:51] the bride's best days are yet to come
[1:50:54] but this country has rejected the gospel
[1:50:57] which is why she's in the trouble that
[1:50:59] she's in
[1:51:00] any one of our young children any one of
[1:51:02] our young people anyone
[1:51:04] that has been heard the word
[1:51:08] could solve all the world's problems
[1:51:11] they go to summits and they go here and
[1:51:13] they go there he is the answer to every
[1:51:15] problem in this world
[1:51:17] but they don't want it
[1:51:21] they don't want it
[1:51:24] in fact we're at the second crucifixion
[1:51:26] of the word
[1:51:28] because jesus christ is the same
[1:51:29] yesterday today and forever and when he
[1:51:31] came the first time
[1:51:32] they crucified him when he came the
[1:51:35] second time
[1:51:37] when the word was presented and the word
[1:51:38] the full word came
[1:51:40] they rejected it and they crucified it
[1:51:45] so if there was a resurrection after the
[1:51:47] first crucifixion
[1:51:48] there's going to be a resurrection after
[1:51:50] the second crucifixion
[1:51:54] now when brother rand preaches the third
[1:51:56] seal
[1:51:58] he says the bride hasn't had a revival
[1:52:01] yet see now he was preaching the seals
[1:52:03] there
[1:52:04] there's been no revival there no
[1:52:05] manifestation of god to stir the bride
[1:52:08] yet
[1:52:08] we know she's been stirred see we're
[1:52:11] looking for it now
[1:52:13] it'll take those seven unknown thunders
[1:52:15] back there
[1:52:16] to wake her up again see yeah he'll send
[1:52:19] it
[1:52:19] he promised it now people
[1:52:23] people can get a little uneasy and they
[1:52:25] may get a little
[1:52:26] fidgety when they hear certain words
[1:52:27] there's no reason to be afraid of the
[1:52:29] word thunder
[1:52:31] it's in the scripture it's very very
[1:52:34] important
[1:52:35] a thunder is simply a voice
[1:52:38] so if there's seven thunders there's
[1:52:40] seven voices
[1:52:41] and it takes them seven voices to wake
[1:52:44] the bride up
[1:52:46] you see to wake her up to say come out
[1:52:49] of her
[1:52:49] my people and so that wakes the bride up
[1:52:53] see there's you've got to be resurrected
[1:52:55] spiritually before you can be
[1:52:57] resurrected
[1:52:58] naturally you've got to be you've got to
[1:53:01] receive the born-again experience
[1:53:03] and change your soul before your body
[1:53:05] can be changed
[1:53:08] so the voice of your resurrection
[1:53:11] when john his forerunner came john the
[1:53:13] baptist
[1:53:14] he was preaching and you know he he must
[1:53:17] have been a lot like what the messiah
[1:53:19] was going to be because remember they
[1:53:20] came and asked him are you the messiah
[1:53:23] they confused him with the messiah
[1:53:26] people thought brother branham was god
[1:53:29] but he's not
[1:53:34] but john introduced the lamb of god
[1:53:37] just like god's prophet introduced the
[1:53:39] lamb of god
[1:53:41] now remember when john introduced jesus
[1:53:44] christ he introduced
[1:53:45] all of god he introduced god in his
[1:53:47] fullness
[1:53:48] and so did brother william branham
[1:53:52] this picture right here
[1:53:56] the world hates it
[1:54:00] the world attacks it
[1:54:04] satan hates it but he knows it's true
[1:54:11] satan knows that that pillar of fire
[1:54:14] right here
[1:54:17] would come down in them services
[1:54:22] and cast him out
[1:54:26] you see this man here he was a vessel
[1:54:31] he was a sinner at one time and he had
[1:54:34] to be saved just like
[1:54:36] you he had to be saved just like you
[1:54:40] he had he had a pull for the world he
[1:54:42] wanted to be a boxer he wanted to be a
[1:54:44] writer
[1:54:46] but he had to surrender it all
[1:54:50] so he could be used of god
[1:54:53] now we don't worship the man but we
[1:54:56] listen to what he said
[1:55:00] because this pillar of fire right here
[1:55:02] is jesus christ
[1:55:06] you read in the bible that whenever
[1:55:10] paul was persecuting the church when
[1:55:11] jesus came
[1:55:14] and he was god in flesh and they killed
[1:55:17] him and he rose from the dead he said i
[1:55:18] come from god and i go back to god
[1:55:21] when paul was cruising when paul was
[1:55:23] persecuting the elected church the bride
[1:55:27] and he was on his way to arrest
[1:55:30] the church the elected word of god
[1:55:34] he was struck off a horse by this light
[1:55:38] and paul said when he said jesus said
[1:55:40] paul paul why persecute without me
[1:55:43] now think of this paul did not
[1:55:47] physically even see jesus but jesus said
[1:55:50] why persecuteth thou
[1:55:52] me so that means the body of christ
[1:55:56] is jesus christ so he said paul paul why
[1:55:59] persecute without me and he said paul
[1:56:01] said who are you lord
[1:56:02] now paul was a very indoctrinated man
[1:56:04] and he knew
[1:56:05] the law and that pillar of fire spoke
[1:56:09] back and said i'm jesus
[1:56:13] that pillar of fire is the same pillar
[1:56:15] of fire that would actually go
[1:56:16] and lead moses leave the children of
[1:56:18] israel
[1:56:20] that pillar of fire would would come and
[1:56:22] go throughout scriptures
[1:56:24] that pillar of fire is what each and
[1:56:27] every one of us must meet
[1:56:31] you don't have to see it but you've got
[1:56:33] to meet it
[1:56:36] because the holy ghost remember when on
[1:56:38] on the day of pentecost when the holy
[1:56:40] ghost came
[1:56:41] that it separated itself tongues of fire
[1:56:44] it's like tongues of fire
[1:56:46] that pill you have a portion that pillar
[1:56:48] of fire is with
[1:56:49] every elected child of god now god took
[1:56:52] god took his dear prophet home he did
[1:56:55] his job
[1:56:56] but that pillar of fire still with the
[1:56:58] bride that pillar of fire has been seen
[1:57:00] in the church
[1:57:01] in our church and i believe with all my
[1:57:04] heart the pillar of fire is here
[1:57:07] because he promised to be
[1:57:10] do you know satan attacks that picture
[1:57:12] because he hates it so much
[1:57:14] oh by the way he attacks this one too
[1:57:19] but you know this is peace to you
[1:57:23] this is peace to you but his judgment to
[1:57:26] the world
[1:57:31] whenever john seen jesus christ come he
[1:57:34] was preaching for a while
[1:57:36] and he seen jesus christ come one day
[1:57:38] and he said behold the lamb of god that
[1:57:40] takes away the sin of the world
[1:57:43] he later said he that hath the bride is
[1:57:46] the bridegroom
[1:57:47] but the friend of the bridegroom which
[1:57:49] standeth and heareth him rejoiceth
[1:57:51] greatly because the bridegroom's voice
[1:57:53] this is my joy therefore is fulfilled he
[1:57:56] must increase and john said
[1:58:00] i must decrease
[1:58:03] whenever brother branham's job was done
[1:58:05] god took him home
[1:58:07] he's at rest he's at peace but god still
[1:58:10] got work to do
[1:58:12] and so god did not take the pillar fire
[1:58:14] away when he took the prophet away
[1:58:20] ram said in the voice of the sign john
[1:58:21] calling out the elected
[1:58:23] and give it over to christ when he come
[1:58:27] i love that i must increase
[1:58:30] i must decrease he must increase
[1:58:35] in john 1 35 again the next day after
[1:58:37] john stood and two of his disciples
[1:58:39] and looking upon jesus as he walked he
[1:58:41] said behold the lamb of god
[1:58:43] and the two disciples heard him speak
[1:58:47] and they follow jesus when you really
[1:58:50] hear
[1:58:51] the voice behind the voice it won't make
[1:58:54] you follow a man it'll make you follow
[1:58:56] jesus
[1:58:57] because when you look in the scriptures
[1:58:59] do you know that john
[1:59:01] still had disciples after jesus after he
[1:59:03] introduced jesus
[1:59:04] he introduced jesus jesus came he he
[1:59:06] lived he did his work he died he was
[1:59:09] very
[1:59:09] resurrected and in the book of acts
[1:59:11] there were still people
[1:59:14] that were disciples of john and they
[1:59:16] were so blinded by the light
[1:59:19] they could not see who john introduced
[1:59:24] that's a repeat it's important
[1:59:27] we worship jesus christ but god sent a
[1:59:30] prophet to us to introduce him
[1:59:33] to us just like he sent eliezer
[1:59:37] to bring rebecca to isaac
[1:59:40] so whenever he heard him speak there was
[1:59:43] a disciple there were two disciples that
[1:59:44] heard john speaking and they said behold
[1:59:46] the lamb of god
[1:59:47] their disciples shifted their attention
[1:59:48] to jesus christ
[1:59:50] and one of them's name was andrew
[1:59:53] and remember we were dealing with go and
[1:59:54] tell the woman at the well after she had
[1:59:57] her experience she went and told
[1:59:58] somebody
[2:00:00] andrew went and got his brother he got
[2:00:02] his brother peter and said
[2:00:04] we found the messiah jesus called philip
[2:00:07] philip went and got his friend nathaniel
[2:00:11] see we have a work to do we have someone
[2:00:14] to tell
[2:00:16] malachi 3 revealed isaiah 53
[2:00:21] the lamb of god he was wounded for our
[2:00:23] transgressions
[2:00:24] by his stripes we were healed when that
[2:00:27] man
[2:00:28] when that god man came down john
[2:00:30] identified him as the lamb of god
[2:00:33] and malachi 4 we were promised the
[2:00:35] prophet
[2:00:37] and did he send him he sent him and he
[2:00:40] vindicated him
[2:00:41] but it's to introduce jesus christ
[2:00:44] is to awaken and given the then give the
[2:00:47] bride a resurrection
[2:00:50] but you can't hear a man you've got to
[2:00:53] hear god
[2:00:56] brother ram dealt very heavily with the
[2:00:57] voice of the sign
[2:01:00] see just like whenever jesus came on
[2:01:03] earth
[2:01:04] people loved his miracles people loved
[2:01:07] it when jesus
[2:01:08] fed 5 000. people loved it when he
[2:01:12] changed the water to wine people loved
[2:01:14] it when he raised the dead
[2:01:16] people loved it when he cleansed the
[2:01:17] lepers but whenever he began to preach
[2:01:21] and one day he said that i and my father
[2:01:22] are one
[2:01:24] then they picked up stones and when
[2:01:27] jesus christ came in this day
[2:01:30] they love the miracles they love the
[2:01:32] discernment
[2:01:34] they love seeing people get up off
[2:01:35] wheelchairs
[2:01:38] but when he preached the word and the
[2:01:39] voice came they rejected it
[2:01:42] they refused it because remember the
[2:01:44] coming of a prophet is a sign
[2:01:46] that god is ready to speak
[2:01:50] god don't just do things haphazardly
[2:01:54] god don't just have you here haphazardly
[2:01:57] i believe god has us here because
[2:01:59] there's something he's wanting to speak
[2:02:03] so the coming of a prophet within
[2:02:05] himself is a sign
[2:02:06] that god is getting ready to speak jonah
[2:02:09] was in the belly of the fish
[2:02:12] and when he came out that was a type of
[2:02:15] resurrection
[2:02:17] but that wasn't it jonah just didn't
[2:02:20] come out of the fish and everybody
[2:02:21] was so amazed and impressed and
[2:02:23] everybody went home jonah had a
[2:02:24] had a message there was a voice to
[2:02:26] follow that sign and then the voice was
[2:02:28] repent or perish and that's the same
[2:02:32] voice that follows this sign
[2:02:36] people invited this man on purpose
[2:02:40] to draw a crowd and bring in money
[2:02:44] people try to use his gift for their own
[2:02:47] personal gain
[2:02:48] but when he began to preach they
[2:02:50] rejected him
[2:02:53] so think of what the blessing it is that
[2:02:55] the very thing the the very thing that
[2:02:57] people rejected him over is the very
[2:02:59] thing that attracts
[2:03:00] you we weren't we
[2:03:03] god took his prophet home we would love
[2:03:06] to be in his prayer line
[2:03:07] i'd give anything to be in his prayer
[2:03:09] line but god took him home
[2:03:13] but why are we gathered here because of
[2:03:15] the voice
[2:03:16] because of the voice because we heard
[2:03:18] the voice of god not the voice of a man
[2:03:20] the voice behind the voice and it caused
[2:03:23] a resurrection within us
[2:03:27] and it quickened us to life
[2:03:31] in the queen of sheba brotherham said an
[2:03:33] evil and adulterous generation seeks
[2:03:35] after signs
[2:03:36] and there will be no sign given them but
[2:03:38] the sign of jonah for as jonah was in
[2:03:40] the belly of the wealth three days a
[2:03:41] night
[2:03:42] so the son of man must be in the belly
[2:03:44] of the well three days and nights
[2:03:45] now you spiritual minded people open up
[2:03:48] what's that
[2:03:49] what's that don't just read right over
[2:03:51] it let the spirit catch it for you
[2:03:53] what kind of a generation was seeking
[2:03:55] after a sign
[2:03:57] this generation this is that evil and
[2:04:00] adulterous generation
[2:04:02] that would seek after a sign everywhere
[2:04:04] every little sign they seek after it
[2:04:06] said there'd be no sign
[2:04:07] but the sign of jonah
[2:04:11] what was jonah the sign of the
[2:04:13] resurrection
[2:04:14] hallelujah the resurrection
[2:04:18] jonah when he came out of the well was a
[2:04:21] prophecy of what jesus would experience
[2:04:23] in the earth
[2:04:25] when brother branham would take people
[2:04:26] and would and that same pillar of fire
[2:04:29] would come and
[2:04:30] stand he said not two foot from where he
[2:04:31] was standing
[2:04:33] and that would reveal this pillar fire
[2:04:36] the presence of jesus christ the logos
[2:04:38] would tell the people what what they've
[2:04:40] done what they will do and brought
[2:04:41] deliverance and healing
[2:04:43] and salvation to people that was the
[2:04:45] sign to prove that he indeed
[2:04:47] raised from the dead that was the sign
[2:04:51] of the resurrection
[2:04:53] but there was a voice pushing behind
[2:04:55] that sign
[2:04:58] the pillar of fire was here to say that
[2:05:00] there was a voice that was ready to
[2:05:01] speak
[2:05:04] god sent the prophet
[2:05:09] for what it wasn't just for signs and
[2:05:12] wonders that was to catch
[2:05:14] the attention of the people because he
[2:05:16] had something to say
[2:05:20] because it was elected child there was
[2:05:22] elected seeds of god
[2:05:24] that would come 50 and 60 years
[2:05:27] after god took him off the scene that
[2:05:30] would be quickened by the words that he
[2:05:31] said that god spoke through him
[2:05:35] so there's two signs a pillar of fire
[2:05:38] and a voice the voice of the sign is
[2:05:41] what's quickening the elected of this
[2:05:43] age
[2:05:44] and it's preparing us for a resurrection
[2:05:46] and a body change
[2:05:47] that's what we're on the very cusp of we
[2:05:49] are on the very edge
[2:05:52] of the resurrection
[2:05:55] we're on the very edge of the body
[2:05:58] change
[2:05:59] the accuracy of the word is 100 percent
[2:06:03] and has never failed
[2:06:07] it's the voice that wakes up the elect
[2:06:11] the signs just get her attention
[2:06:14] but you must hear the voice of god
[2:06:18] speaking if we just come to church and
[2:06:21] we only hear
[2:06:22] a man preach we get nothing out of
[2:06:25] service
[2:06:26] but if you can look past the man and
[2:06:28] just and just know that he's just dust
[2:06:31] and that
[2:06:31] and that he's just trusting god to set
[2:06:33] him aside and speak through him
[2:06:35] then you can get a blessing out of it
[2:06:38] but as long as you only see the man
[2:06:40] you'll walk out and just get with the
[2:06:42] word of a man
[2:06:44] but look past the man in revelation
[2:06:47] 18 4 and i heard another voice from
[2:06:50] heaven
[2:06:52] saying come out of her my people that ye
[2:06:54] be not partakers of her sins
[2:06:57] and that ye receive not her plagues
[2:07:00] aren't you thankful for an ear to hear
[2:07:03] aren't you thankful for a heart to
[2:07:04] receive the word of god
[2:07:08] aren't you thankful that while the world
[2:07:10] is dying while the world has got all
[2:07:12] their hopes
[2:07:13] and political ambitions got all their
[2:07:16] hopes on an election
[2:07:18] or has all their hopes on the next
[2:07:19] election whereas all their hopes on what
[2:07:22] their 401k is or the stock market
[2:07:24] that's a miserable way to live
[2:07:28] but our hope is in the word and the word
[2:07:30] has never failed
[2:07:32] amen listen to our feet the musicians
[2:07:34] will come
[2:07:36] in john 5 28 marvel not at this
[2:07:41] for the hour is coming in the which all
[2:07:44] that are in the grave shall hear his
[2:07:46] voice
[2:07:47] so there's coming a time when everybody
[2:07:50] is going to hear his voice
[2:07:53] but we want to hear his voice now
[2:07:56] because when
[2:07:56] everyone that's in the graves will hear
[2:07:58] his voice then it's the day of judgment
[2:08:03] and shall come forth they that have done
[2:08:06] good unto the resurrection of life
[2:08:08] and they that have done evil unto the
[2:08:10] resurrection of damnation
[2:08:13] so he that hath an ear let him hear with
[2:08:16] the spirit saith unto the churches
[2:08:19] ye must be born again
[2:08:22] when you hear the voice behind the voice
[2:08:25] and you really receive the word for your
[2:08:27] day
[2:08:28] it will bring about a change it will
[2:08:31] bring about a born-again experience
[2:08:34] and you'll never be the same
[2:08:37] and the holy ghost the born-again
[2:08:39] experience is the token
[2:08:40] it guarantees you a place
[2:08:44] it is a reservation at the wedding
[2:08:46] supper
[2:08:48] nobody else can take your place you've
[2:08:50] got your place reserved
[2:08:53] because you hold the token amen let's
