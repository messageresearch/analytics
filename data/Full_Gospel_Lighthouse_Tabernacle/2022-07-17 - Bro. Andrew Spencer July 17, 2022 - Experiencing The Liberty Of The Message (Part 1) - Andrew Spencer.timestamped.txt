[33:23] i got a text this morning to sing a song
[33:27] i had on my heart maybe two i would sing
[33:29] but this one here kept coming to me
[33:31] i've never sung it
[33:34] about two years ago brother williams
[33:36] sent it to me i'd never heard it
[33:38] i wasn't capable of singing it then
[33:40] because it kind of overwhelms me
[33:42] he had no idea that how close to my life
[33:45] this song came
[33:48] i pray the lord help me through it this
[33:49] morning because
[33:51] not to give glory to that other thing
[33:53] but i just want to give praise to god
[33:54] for what he's done in my life
[33:57] i mean brother greg ain't never
[33:59] practiced it until just a while ago for
[34:00] about 30 minutes
[34:02] so it's fresh
[34:05] but brother greg happened to also bring
[34:06] up that
[34:08] after hearing this song he said you
[34:09] realize that two weeks before you
[34:11] started the church
[34:13] me and him got together at quaker state
[34:15] and we thought we done made a pack we're
[34:16] going to be drinking buddies
[34:18] little did we know we're going to drink
[34:20] but it wasn't rye yeah
[34:21] it's new wine
[34:26] so i just think that
[34:27] [Applause]
[34:29] i'd like for the devil to just take a
[34:30] look at the two that he thought he was
[34:31] getting a hold to that day where we're
[34:34] at now
[34:35] god had different plans

[59:41] morning we'd like to look over in a few
[59:44] passages here
[1:00:08] few passages this morning to gather our
[1:00:11] thought i'd like to look over in the
[1:00:13] book of luke chapter 4 and verse 18
[1:00:16] then to joshua chapter 2
[1:00:18] and then down to james chapter 1.
[1:00:31] amen
[1:00:33] luke chapter 4
[1:00:34] and verse 18. i'd like to speak to you
[1:00:37] this this morning on a thought that the
[1:00:39] lord's placed on our heart on
[1:00:41] experiencing
[1:00:42] the liberty of the message
[1:00:45] experiencing the liberty of the message
[1:00:48] and jesus taking the book
[1:00:52] read and he said the spirit of the lord
[1:00:54] is upon me because he hath anointed me
[1:00:57] to preach the gospel to the poor
[1:00:59] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[1:01:01] to preach deliverance
[1:01:03] to the captives
[1:01:04] and recovering of the sight to the blind
[1:01:07] to set at liberty them that are bruised
[1:01:10] to preach the acceptable year of the
[1:01:13] lord
[1:01:14] joshua chapter 2
[1:01:16] verse 1.
[1:01:24] and joshua the son of nun sent out of
[1:01:27] him
[1:01:28] two men to spy secretly saying go
[1:01:32] view the land
[1:01:33] even jericho and they went and came into
[1:01:36] and harlot's house
[1:01:38] named rahab
[1:01:40] and lodged there
[1:01:42] james chapter 1 and verse 22.
[1:01:52] hallelujah do you love the lord this
[1:01:54] morning
[1:01:55] amen
[1:01:57] james chapter 1 and verse 22
[1:02:00] but be you doers of the word and not
[1:02:03] hearers only
[1:02:04] deceiving your own selves
[1:02:07] for if any man be a hearer of the word
[1:02:09] and not a doer he is like unto a man
[1:02:12] beholding his natural face in a glass
[1:02:15] for beholdeth himself and go this way
[1:02:17] and straightway forgetteth what manner
[1:02:19] of man he was
[1:02:22] but whoso looketh into the perfect law
[1:02:24] of liberty
[1:02:26] and continueth therein
[1:02:28] continueth
[1:02:30] therein
[1:02:31] and he being not
[1:02:33] forgetful hearer but a doer of the work
[1:02:35] this man shall be blessed
[1:02:38] in his deed may god bless his word he
[1:02:40] may be seated in the presence of the
[1:02:41] lord as we said we'd like to speak to
[1:02:43] you on experiencing
[1:02:45] the liberty of the message
[1:02:47] and from the from the passion
[1:02:49] translation i sent to the brothers that
[1:02:50] they might share it with you this
[1:02:52] morning
[1:02:52] here in james chapter 1 verse 23 it says
[1:02:55] that if you listen
[1:02:57] to the word
[1:02:59] and don't live out the message that you
[1:03:01] hear you become like the person who
[1:03:02] looks in the mirror of the word to
[1:03:05] discover the reflection of his face in
[1:03:07] the beginning you perceive how god sees
[1:03:10] you in the mirror of the word but then
[1:03:11] you go out and forget your divine origin
[1:03:14] but those who set their gaze deeply into
[1:03:17] the perfect law of liberty are
[1:03:19] fascinated by
[1:03:20] and respond to the truth that they hear
[1:03:23] and are strengthened by it and they
[1:03:25] experience god's blessings in all
[1:03:29] that they do
[1:03:30] when you begin to look at that word or
[1:03:31] you begin to look that whosoever looketh
[1:03:33] in the perfect law of liberty you begin
[1:03:36] to look that the one that is looking is
[1:03:38] looking not just haphazardly but he is
[1:03:40] looking with an intent and he's looking
[1:03:42] earnestly into the perfect law of
[1:03:44] liberty which is none other than jesus
[1:03:46] christ but this message that that that
[1:03:48] we have that i thought brother william
[1:03:50] just did a phenomenal job setting a case
[1:03:52] for christ last night but this message
[1:03:54] that you and i so so love and we are so
[1:03:57] acquainted with this message is not that
[1:04:00] of a message of rules of of do's and
[1:04:02] don'ts and you can't go here and you
[1:04:04] can't do this you can't wear that or you
[1:04:06] can't wear this but it is that of
[1:04:08] liberty that is given unto the children
[1:04:11] of the most high god you'll find that if
[1:04:13] you're the more that you go deeper into
[1:04:15] this message you'll find that it is a
[1:04:17] message that is a love letter to his
[1:04:19] children that understand through the
[1:04:21] through the written word that they
[1:04:23] understand that this is guarding them
[1:04:25] from the from the snares of the fowler
[1:04:28] and actually what this message does it
[1:04:31] liberates you from where you was and it
[1:04:34] takes you to a place that god is
[1:04:36] destined for your divine origin that
[1:04:37] nobody else can go there except for
[1:04:40] those that have been liberated by this
[1:04:42] message and i'm so thankful that i can
[1:04:44] identify with those that have
[1:04:46] experienced the liberty of this message
[1:04:48] and i hear some people say well i can't
[1:04:50] do this because of the message or i
[1:04:52] can't go out and i can't do this with my
[1:04:54] friends like i used to well i can't do
[1:04:56] that either because you see there was
[1:04:58] something on the inside of me that got
[1:05:00] changed and i i got liberated from the
[1:05:02] man that i once was to the man that he
[1:05:04] wanted me to be you see i have no more
[1:05:06] desire to go out and do those things no
[1:05:08] more because there was something on the
[1:05:10] inside of me that got birthed by a new
[1:05:13] kingdom that only he could put there
[1:05:15] before the foundation of the world and
[1:05:17] i'm so thankful to be standing right
[1:05:19] here with not people that are barred up
[1:05:21] with sin or borrowed up with all kinds
[1:05:24] of circumstances of religion but a
[1:05:26] people that understand freedom and
[1:05:28] people that understand the freedom of
[1:05:30] worship hey people that understand the
[1:05:32] power of the message and what it does
[1:05:34] for them the message didn't come for us
[1:05:37] just to have another school or just to
[1:05:39] have another thought but the message
[1:05:40] came to bring a people to loose the
[1:05:43] seven seals and set her free from every
[1:05:46] dogma and creed and every idea of man
[1:05:49] where men had tried to keep her so many
[1:05:51] years bound down by cold formal
[1:05:54] religions but the message of the hour
[1:05:56] came to set and elect people free so
[1:05:59] that they could come to a place that
[1:06:01] only god destined that they would live
[1:06:03] at
[1:06:04] this message is not bondage this message
[1:06:07] is our freedom
[1:06:11] hallelujah
[1:06:12] webster says that the word liberty it
[1:06:15] means the freedom from restraint in a
[1:06:18] general sense and applicable to the body
[1:06:21] soul and mind it is a state of exemption
[1:06:25] from the control of others so a man that
[1:06:28] enjoys liberty when he enjoys liberty
[1:06:31] when there's no physical force to
[1:06:34] operate or to restrain his actions
[1:06:37] and i think that that's exactly what the
[1:06:39] message has done for us it has taken
[1:06:41] every physical force that the enemy has
[1:06:44] come in and tried to rob from you and i
[1:06:47] it has moved those things out of our way
[1:06:50] so that we can act exactly like the king
[1:06:52] wants us to act i believe that esther
[1:06:55] walked in there and she may have had
[1:06:57] fear because of me she may have walked
[1:06:59] into the king's court and she may have
[1:07:01] been fearful knowing that if the king
[1:07:03] doesn't drop down his scepter but if she
[1:07:05] would have really walked in there with
[1:07:07] the idea that i am the queen and i have
[1:07:09] every right to walk in here you know
[1:07:12] that she was completely liberated to
[1:07:14] walk in there because she was half of
[1:07:16] the kingdom do you realize today that
[1:07:18] you can walk into the shekinah glory
[1:07:21] because you own half of the kingdom this
[1:07:23] morning i want you to recognize that you
[1:07:25] are the most powerful people that has
[1:07:27] ever been upon the face of the earth
[1:07:29] george washington was a powerful man
[1:07:31] abraham lincoln was a powerful man but
[1:07:34] those men cannot even hold a shadow to
[1:07:36] what the bride of jesus christ is i say
[1:07:39] wesley was a good man luther was a good
[1:07:42] man but they can't stand in front of the
[1:07:44] church of the living god that's been
[1:07:46] liberated by the message of the hour
[1:07:50] [Applause]
[1:07:52] it's the light that done the work
[1:07:55] notice what brother man was saying the
[1:07:56] manifestation of the spirit in 1951 he
[1:07:59] said now the meeting will be what you
[1:08:01] determine in your own heart
[1:08:04] it can be a time that all of these
[1:08:06] people sitting here in these chairs can
[1:08:09] be at liberty walking around here on the
[1:08:12] street it can be those that's on cots
[1:08:14] delivered to those suffering with cancer
[1:08:17] and heart troubles we'll be back in here
[1:08:19] and it can be to every one of you a
[1:08:21] deliverance he said now if god will help
[1:08:24] me to let it be known to you just how
[1:08:26] simple it is then you receive it
[1:08:29] if you can recognize how simple it is
[1:08:32] then you can receive it and if you
[1:08:34] recognize that that no matter what may
[1:08:36] be called you can go through deuteronomy
[1:08:38] 28 and you can look at all the curses
[1:08:41] you can look at all the curses that
[1:08:42] would come upon the children of god if
[1:08:44] they turn back to serve the gods of
[1:08:46] egypt and you can look over there and
[1:08:48] you can line up all of those diseases
[1:08:50] but i want you to know there's one
[1:08:52] inoculation for every single one of
[1:08:54] those diseases and you can set here
[1:08:57] completely free from every cancer demon
[1:09:00] from every covet demon from every cold
[1:09:02] demon from every tuberculosis demon
[1:09:06] is that right i want you to know that
[1:09:08] there is power right here this morning
[1:09:11] and it's not just something that you're
[1:09:13] reaching out into the atmosphere that
[1:09:15] you can't grab a hold of but i want to
[1:09:17] know let you know that there is a living
[1:09:19] god that is here that is energizing this
[1:09:22] atmosphere that is energizing this
[1:09:24] people that will not allow you to be
[1:09:27] manhandled or devil handled but god
[1:09:30] wants you to be god handled god don't
[1:09:32] want you dealing with sickness god don't
[1:09:34] want you dealing with cancer god wants
[1:09:36] you to be god-handled i'll say this
[1:09:38] david was a giant killer but my god's a
[1:09:42] giant killer today my god's a
[1:09:44] cancer-killing god my god's a a sin
[1:09:47] killing god
[1:09:48] [Applause]
[1:09:54] i said let god have his liberty in this
[1:09:56] place
[1:09:59] let god have his liberty it's amazing
[1:10:01] thing when somebody
[1:10:03] begins to feel liberated
[1:10:06] you know there's just certain people
[1:10:07] around that you get around that
[1:10:08] sometimes you can get comfortable with
[1:10:10] and there's other people that you don't
[1:10:12] feel comfortable around
[1:10:13] and you kind of you kind of pull back a
[1:10:15] little bit because because they you're
[1:10:17] not in your comfort zone and and you
[1:10:19] just never know where the conversation
[1:10:20] is going so you try to guard yourself a
[1:10:22] little bit
[1:10:23] that's a smart thing to do
[1:10:25] but if you're really around somebody
[1:10:27] that you know that somebody that you can
[1:10:28] trust
[1:10:30] as the old saying goes you can let your
[1:10:31] hair down as it was ain't that right
[1:10:32] brother and you can let your hair down
[1:10:34] and you can just you can let yourself
[1:10:36] free and you can really enjoy that
[1:10:38] person because you know
[1:10:40] you know your conversation ain't gonna
[1:10:41] go somewhere outside but if you realize
[1:10:44] that that if you get around the
[1:10:45] atmosphere of the holy ghost that if you
[1:10:48] ever get one time good and comfortable
[1:10:50] in the presence of the living god you
[1:10:52] can really let your hair down you can
[1:10:55] shake out your bobby pins or you can
[1:10:57] shake out all your all your curls that
[1:10:59] you put up all morning you can really
[1:11:01] get comfortable in his presence and you
[1:11:03] can start having a conversation with the
[1:11:06] king of kings
[1:11:07] because you're comfortable with him it's
[1:11:09] amazing thing when you can feel freedom
[1:11:12] it's amazing
[1:11:14] now i'm
[1:11:15] i'm going i'm going back way back here
[1:11:17] just for a moment just to just to grab
[1:11:19] something something that i personally do
[1:11:21] not remember but if you if you're under
[1:11:23] the law
[1:11:24] if you're under the law you see you
[1:11:26] cannot have full liberty
[1:11:28] is that right if you're under the law
[1:11:30] but if you're under grace you can have
[1:11:32] full access to the liberty of jesus
[1:11:34] christ but they told me now this is this
[1:11:36] is they say and i have a whole lot of
[1:11:38] trouble with they say but you remember
[1:11:40] you'll you'll find out what i'm having
[1:11:41] problem with here but back when i was a
[1:11:44] child when we was living up in pilot
[1:11:45] virginia uh virginia there there we had
[1:11:48] a little house up there and our cousin
[1:11:50] that tj he'd come down every once in a
[1:11:52] while we we'd play and we man we killed
[1:11:54] more cowboys and more indians than
[1:11:56] anybody could ever imagine we had six
[1:11:58] shooters and everything else
[1:12:00] but they said i don't remember this
[1:12:02] thank god maybe he wiped it away from my
[1:12:04] memory
[1:12:05] you know i don't know but this is what
[1:12:07] they said
[1:12:08] but they said
[1:12:10] they said that me tj and matthew were
[1:12:12] out there playing and we was playing
[1:12:14] along and we went upstairs and we took
[1:12:17] those play handcuffs you know those
[1:12:18] things that kids got when these cowboys
[1:12:21] took him handcuffs
[1:12:23] and i don't know why in the world this
[1:12:25] is what they said i didn't do i didn't
[1:12:26] say it but they said that we took those
[1:12:29] handcuffs
[1:12:30] and we put them on matthew
[1:12:33] and we handcuffed him to the toy box or
[1:12:35] something up there
[1:12:36] and we went out and played exactly how
[1:12:38] we wanted to play obviously i don't
[1:12:40] remember it
[1:12:41] but obviously
[1:12:43] there was something that was the law
[1:12:44] there that was keeping us from really
[1:12:46] being liberated the way that we really
[1:12:48] wanted to play and buddy we thought we
[1:12:51] had liberation
[1:12:52] until
[1:12:54] the law
[1:12:58] until the law got home and i found out
[1:13:00] who had real liberty they had liberty to
[1:13:03] take their liberty to the backside
[1:13:08] now i don't remember that but that's
[1:13:09] what they say
[1:13:10] now i've got you over here on my side
[1:13:13] now they used to say that i used to
[1:13:14] drink
[1:13:16] they used to say that i run dope and
[1:13:18] they used to say all these other things
[1:13:20] but you see when the law came when jesus
[1:13:23] christ came he didn't do away with the
[1:13:25] law he magnified the law and he showed
[1:13:28] that he was the one that could fulfill
[1:13:30] every portion of it and the devil said
[1:13:33] that i did this and the devil said that
[1:13:35] i did this
[1:13:38] and he tried to arrest me so that i
[1:13:41] couldn't go on so i couldn't really have
[1:13:43] the liberty of the spirit of the living
[1:13:45] god but then jesus came by my way and
[1:13:49] said let them go free
[1:13:52] now we put the handcuffs on the devil
[1:13:55] it's time that you take this living word
[1:13:57] and push the devil back into a corner
[1:14:00] don't you let him push you around don't
[1:14:02] you let him tell you what you ought to
[1:14:04] do don't you let him tell you how you
[1:14:06] ought to worship
[1:14:08] it's time that you accept your liberty
[1:14:11] as the sons of the living god
[1:14:14] there ain't no experience like the
[1:14:16] liberty of this message
[1:14:20] but i'll tell you what i am sick and
[1:14:22] tired of hearing
[1:14:23] is people trying to arrest the spirit of
[1:14:25] the living god
[1:14:26] trying to cuff god in a corner and say
[1:14:29] we'll serve god the way we want to we
[1:14:31] won't have none of that worship we will
[1:14:33] have none of that screaming we won't
[1:14:35] have none of that acts 2 38 blabbering
[1:14:37] speaking in tongues
[1:14:39] she said that's the kind she said she
[1:14:42] don't want nothing to do with it if
[1:14:44] you're identifying that you don't want
[1:14:45] this in your church you are proving that
[1:14:48] you are a modern church and you're dead
[1:14:51] from the roots up
[1:14:54] stop arresting the power of the holy
[1:14:57] ghost and let the holy ghost have his
[1:14:59] liberty in the church of the living god
[1:15:02] if you're sitting in a church in that
[1:15:04] church i'm not trying to get you to move
[1:15:05] here but if your church is not say it's
[1:15:08] not accepting the liberty of jesus
[1:15:10] christ move
[1:15:13] move to a place that you can really
[1:15:15] worship god there's too many people
[1:15:18] crowding the message of the hour saying
[1:15:20] we got to do this and we got to do that
[1:15:22] let the message be the message the
[1:15:25] message will set you free the message
[1:15:27] will liberate you
[1:15:29] [Applause]
[1:15:38] you're just preaching that because your
[1:15:39] friends are preaching that you're just
[1:15:41] preaching that because your granddaddy
[1:15:42] preached that let me tell you this this
[1:15:44] was birthed on the inside of me before
[1:15:46] there was a foundation of the world i
[1:15:48] ain't preaching this because homer
[1:15:50] fraser preached i ain't preaching this
[1:15:52] because ron spencer preaching or tim
[1:15:54] pruitt's preaching i'm preaching this
[1:15:56] because this is exactly what paul
[1:15:58] preached
[1:16:04] where the spirit of the lord is
[1:16:06] there is liberty and now what he said in
[1:16:09] second corinthians 3 17 that where the
[1:16:11] spirit of the lord is the lord is that
[1:16:13] spirit
[1:16:14] and where the spirit of the lord is
[1:16:16] there is liberty there is freedom
[1:16:20] hallelujah
[1:16:23] let god
[1:16:25] have his liberty
[1:16:28] let me move on just for a moment
[1:16:33] no let me let me draw right right quick
[1:16:35] right here
[1:16:37] a few months ago there was a
[1:16:39] there was a meeting that went on
[1:16:43] there was a meeting that went on down in
[1:16:45] christiansburg virginia and we brother
[1:16:47] ron i went through the prayer line and
[1:16:48] you were many of you were there that
[1:16:49] night
[1:16:51] but i want to use this one individual
[1:16:54] just because of the experience that
[1:16:55] happened
[1:16:56] my cousin malachi had had been searching
[1:16:58] for us and we'd been taken away out of
[1:17:00] the prayer line i matter of fact i don't
[1:17:01] know how how i got to the van much less
[1:17:04] how dad
[1:17:05] got to his vehicle
[1:17:07] brother malachi was looking for us
[1:17:09] because he had a desire of his heart
[1:17:11] because he knew that there was a word
[1:17:13] that he needed right there
[1:17:15] and he was looking with everything that
[1:17:16] was within him and he was hunting for it
[1:17:18] he was trying to get to me and and then
[1:17:20] my wife my wife was able to make it make
[1:17:23] way for him to get there
[1:17:25] by the time that he got there things was
[1:17:26] just getting right on the inside of that
[1:17:28] van we had a van full of people in there
[1:17:30] and i'm telling you the holy ghost
[1:17:32] busted out in there and i i've never
[1:17:33] quite experienced anything like that but
[1:17:36] there
[1:17:37] there the angel the lord began to do do
[1:17:39] a work and brother malachi you can go
[1:17:40] and ask him he'll tell it to you he said
[1:17:42] but he never had a breakthrough like
[1:17:44] that in and that's his words he
[1:17:46] experienced his breakthrough
[1:17:49] and if you if you listen to somebody
[1:17:50] that really has had a breakthrough their
[1:17:53] language changes everything about them
[1:17:55] has changed we rode we rode up that road
[1:17:58] for 45 minutes to an hour i didn't know
[1:18:01] where i was but they were speaking in
[1:18:02] tongues and shouting going on for over
[1:18:04] an hour on the inside of that van going
[1:18:07] on we people were called by people were
[1:18:09] caught by accident and they heard what
[1:18:11] was going on and they just joined on in
[1:18:12] with us
[1:18:14] but what i what i'm trying to say is
[1:18:17] there's sometimes there's sometimes that
[1:18:19] you've got to get to a spot where you
[1:18:21] can get you can have a breakthrough and
[1:18:24] when you have a breakthrough you don't
[1:18:26] care who's around you you don't care
[1:18:28] what setting that you're in it doesn't
[1:18:30] even matter if it's in a van i want you
[1:18:32] to know the holy ghost who come to you
[1:18:33] in a car he'll come to you and anywhere
[1:18:36] that you are just to make sure that you
[1:18:38] get your breakthrough this message has
[1:18:40] the power to get you out of the trap of
[1:18:42] the enemy it has the power to set you
[1:18:44] free and it has the power to use you
[1:18:47] exactly where god wants you to be used
[1:18:49] at
[1:18:50] now brother burnham said in in the god
[1:18:52] who is rich in mercy he said that when
[1:18:54] any believer comes to god he becomes
[1:18:56] god's attributes of his word he said he
[1:18:59] is used to manifest the word that's
[1:19:01] promised for that day when any believer
[1:19:04] comes to god he becomes god's attributes
[1:19:06] of his word and he is used to manifest
[1:19:09] the word of that day
[1:19:11] just like abraham was used in the drama
[1:19:14] when you watch the drama how it set out
[1:19:16] that god was using the character of
[1:19:18] abraham but god doesn't just use anybody
[1:19:21] he uses somebody that was in his mind
[1:19:24] and he's using caliber of men and
[1:19:26] caliber of women that know how to handle
[1:19:28] the word and he knows what they're going
[1:19:30] to do with the word that's why he gives
[1:19:32] it unto them is that right but abraham
[1:19:35] knew what he wanted done with the word
[1:19:38] and abraham when he was out there and
[1:19:40] the in the and those kings came up there
[1:19:42] and got lot
[1:19:44] his nephew they come up there abraham
[1:19:46] the bible said that abraham armed
[1:19:48] himself and his 318 men servants and he
[1:19:52] went out there and he recovered all of
[1:19:54] the goods
[1:19:55] all of the goods that those kings had
[1:19:58] came in had came in and taken away from
[1:20:01] him and the kings and the king of sodom
[1:20:04] went down there and told abraham i want
[1:20:07] you to take of the goods now notice
[1:20:09] abraham was used to manifest the word of
[1:20:13] that day what was he doing he was
[1:20:14] expressing or manifesting christ as a
[1:20:17] savior and that king of sodom said now
[1:20:20] you take of these goods you went over
[1:20:22] there and you recovered a lot you
[1:20:24] recovered all the goods that these kings
[1:20:26] came in and stole now you come in and
[1:20:28] you take some of these goods but notice
[1:20:31] abraham's language he said i am not
[1:20:33] going to take of anything he said i'm
[1:20:35] not even going to take a shoestring from
[1:20:36] you he said because if i do you'll say
[1:20:39] that abraham is rich because of my hand
[1:20:42] and abraham was saying my liberty didn't
[1:20:44] come from you and my liberty ain't
[1:20:46] getting taken away from you
[1:20:48] is that right
[1:20:50] you see what god has given unto you is
[1:20:53] for you it ain't for somebody else it's
[1:20:56] for you
[1:20:57] you see what we have come become brother
[1:20:59] branham said and things that ought to be
[1:21:01] he said we have came from time beings to
[1:21:03] mortal beings to eternal beings he said
[1:21:06] when our when our soul was lit when our
[1:21:08] soul was lit by the very word of god we
[1:21:11] became sons of god
[1:21:15] it's amazing to me it's always
[1:21:16] astounding to me
[1:21:18] when god
[1:21:19] when god comes to us
[1:21:21] and he comes to us when we're in our
[1:21:23] trial and we're in our in our troubles
[1:21:25] but god does not come to us and talk to
[1:21:27] us about the problems that we're in he
[1:21:30] does not talk to us about our crisis he
[1:21:32] does not talk to us about this things
[1:21:34] that are going on he does not talk to us
[1:21:36] about our sickness he doesn't talk to us
[1:21:38] about our welfare but he comes to us
[1:21:41] just like he came to job and he took job
[1:21:44] up and showed him a vision and he showed
[1:21:46] him the very foundations of the world
[1:21:48] and said job where was you now i want
[1:21:50] you to look all over this vision job
[1:21:52] look at the panoramic here's the
[1:21:54] foundation of the world but job where
[1:21:56] was you at
[1:21:58] where was you at job was in the midst of
[1:22:01] the greatest trial of anybody that could
[1:22:03] ever go through in one year everything
[1:22:06] had been stolen from him his children
[1:22:08] been stolen from him his camels and his
[1:22:10] oxen and his and his asses have been
[1:22:12] taken from him but notice the one thing
[1:22:15] that the enemy couldn't take and it was
[1:22:17] his wife
[1:22:19] hallelujah there may be a lot of things
[1:22:22] that get shook off in this kingdom in
[1:22:24] this kingdom of laodicea but you have
[1:22:26] received a kingdom that cannot be shook
[1:22:29] and the wife of heaven everything around
[1:22:32] you might fall away everything around
[1:22:34] you may fade away but the king's wife
[1:22:37] will still remain
[1:22:42] he'd come to him talk about his problems
[1:22:44] he come to talk to him where he came
[1:22:46] from
[1:22:47] i noticed that every single time god
[1:22:49] come to me or comes to somebody that's
[1:22:51] in trouble he'd never talk to them about
[1:22:53] their problems
[1:22:55] he didn't come to abraham and talk to
[1:22:56] him about his problems what did he use
[1:22:58] he used him to manifest the word
[1:23:02] of his day
[1:23:04] what did abraham do he recognized that
[1:23:07] it was the anointing that led him to
[1:23:10] that victory
[1:23:12] is that right can you identify that it
[1:23:14] is the the anointing of almighty god
[1:23:16] that leads you to every victory small
[1:23:19] victories great victories it is the
[1:23:21] anointing of the lord that brings you to
[1:23:23] perfect liberty in the law of jesus
[1:23:26] christ now notice what the bible said in
[1:23:29] isaiah 58 and 6
[1:23:32] is not this the fast that i have chosen
[1:23:35] to loose the bands of the wickedness to
[1:23:38] undo heaviness heavy burdens and let
[1:23:41] oppressed let the oppressed go free and
[1:23:44] they break every yoke
[1:23:48] isn't this not the fast
[1:23:51] is this not what i am to do that the
[1:23:53] power of my word will break the yoke
[1:23:58] will break the burden will break the
[1:24:01] bands of oppression
[1:24:04] and any day that we've ever fought
[1:24:05] oppression and depression it's this day
[1:24:08] but you let your minds just recall for a
[1:24:10] moment when brother brandon was brought
[1:24:12] a woman that they had to stop the
[1:24:14] meeting for
[1:24:15] that this this woman's husband had there
[1:24:18] was no ambulance that would bring her to
[1:24:20] the meetings so this husband hired out
[1:24:23] men to take a station wagon and to carry
[1:24:27] this woman to brother branham's meeting
[1:24:29] because he knew that the doctors could
[1:24:31] not help her in the condition that she
[1:24:34] was in so they brought this lady to they
[1:24:37] locked his they brought this lady to the
[1:24:38] meeting and they put her down there in
[1:24:40] that basement and they brought brother
[1:24:42] branham down there and he drawed his
[1:24:43] attention to the woman and when he when
[1:24:46] he brought her down there the husband
[1:24:47] began to talk to the brother branham and
[1:24:49] speaking to speak to him and converse
[1:24:52] about what was going on you remember the
[1:24:53] story
[1:24:55] and they began to converse what was
[1:24:56] going on says she's been out of her mind
[1:24:58] these two years doctors can't help her i
[1:25:00] won't go through every single detail but
[1:25:01] brother man i'm saying i'm going to go
[1:25:02] over there and i'm going to shake her
[1:25:04] hand and when brother man hit the man
[1:25:06] had said no no don't do that don't do
[1:25:08] that he said gee she don't know who you
[1:25:09] are she's there's something on her and
[1:25:11] brother adam said she was slithering
[1:25:13] around like a snake
[1:25:15] so she's slithering around like a snake
[1:25:17] and it's amazing when you go to watch a
[1:25:18] demon that that is about to get cast out
[1:25:21] that he begins to go down to the ground
[1:25:23] where he first was bound to
[1:25:25] and there she began to slither on that
[1:25:27] ground brother branham went over there
[1:25:28] and he began to shake her hand and that
[1:25:30] demon grabbed a hold of brother
[1:25:31] branham's hand through that woman and
[1:25:33] jerked him up off of his feet he said if
[1:25:36] i wouldn't handle sturdy hands he said
[1:25:37] she would have pulled me down on the
[1:25:38] ground he said but there that that demon
[1:25:41] began to scream out of that woman and
[1:25:43] said william branham you have nothing to
[1:25:45] do with me and the husband said now now
[1:25:48] wait a minute she don't even know her
[1:25:50] own name now how does she know your name
[1:25:52] and brother brandon said now it's not
[1:25:53] that woman it's that demon on the inside
[1:25:56] of her and he said well what's causing
[1:25:58] this he said that demon recognizes that
[1:26:01] something is getting ready to happen and
[1:26:04] brother branham said that he just prayed
[1:26:06] a very simple prayer over that woman and
[1:26:09] they took her back there and she was in
[1:26:11] a right mind within a few hours now when
[1:26:14] you begin to think about when satan gets
[1:26:16] bound back to where he was and he's in a
[1:26:19] spot and he begins to act just exactly
[1:26:21] like he was watch what jesus christ does
[1:26:25] he shows that he was the seed that was
[1:26:28] come to bruise the serpent's head
[1:26:31] i've never seen one demon that was too
[1:26:34] powerful for my lord jesus christ i'm
[1:26:36] not making a challenge to the devil but
[1:26:38] i am challenging the name of jesus
[1:26:40] christ that every devil has to bow to
[1:26:44] the name of jesus christ you watch what
[1:26:46] happened when that simple little
[1:26:49] childlike faith was prayed over that
[1:26:51] woman with that much power that much
[1:26:53] demon power on the inside of her the
[1:26:56] name of jesus christ
[1:26:58] liberated that woman to the woman that
[1:27:00] she was born to be like
[1:27:06] now you don't realize that you run into
[1:27:08] devils all day head-long day every
[1:27:10] single one of you you run into them but
[1:27:12] you don't recognize it but i want you to
[1:27:14] know
[1:27:15] there is liberty to that enemy that may
[1:27:18] be attacking you
[1:27:19] might attack you with cancer might
[1:27:21] attack you of this might attack you of
[1:27:23] that
[1:27:25] but there
[1:27:26] is liberty
[1:27:28] when the word of god
[1:27:29] begins to have access you remember what
[1:27:32] isaiah would say in isaiah 10 and 27
[1:27:34] that his yoke from off of thy neck and
[1:27:37] the yoke shall be destroyed because
[1:27:40] of the anointing you watch what happens
[1:27:43] it's the anointing that breaks the yoke
[1:27:46] of the enemy and if you can realize what
[1:27:49] day that we're living in that we're
[1:27:50] going through birth pains like never
[1:27:52] before and it's a time to be steady
[1:27:55] because god is fixing to move and if
[1:27:58] you'll realize where you're standing at
[1:28:00] it's this day this scripture is
[1:28:02] fulfilled in your ears
[1:28:06] but you begin to watch as people go on
[1:28:08] through their christian journey or
[1:28:09] through their life through their walk or
[1:28:11] through their life you watch them and
[1:28:13] brother brandon just go do a study one
[1:28:15] time on living under your god-given
[1:28:17] privileges it's a powerful study and
[1:28:19] brother bannon would lay that lay that
[1:28:21] in there that we're living under our
[1:28:23] god-given privileges and i personally
[1:28:25] believe there's not ev there's not one
[1:28:27] person in here that has to live that way
[1:28:31] are we on the same are we on the same
[1:28:33] accord this morning that none of us have
[1:28:35] to live below our god-given privileges
[1:28:38] but we can come up to the level of our
[1:28:40] god-given privileges and access
[1:28:43] what god has given unto us
[1:28:45] but notice when people do live beyond
[1:28:48] their god-given privileges notice what
[1:28:50] psalms 137 says that by the rivers of
[1:28:53] babylon
[1:28:55] there was set down yea we wept and when
[1:28:58] we remembered zion
[1:29:01] when they remembered their liberty
[1:29:04] we hanged our harps upon the willows in
[1:29:06] the midst thereof for there they carried
[1:29:09] us away captive required of us a song
[1:29:12] and they wasted us required of us mirth
[1:29:15] saying sing us of the songs of zion
[1:29:20] but how shall we sing the lord's song in
[1:29:24] a strange land
[1:29:25] now let me ask you something there's no
[1:29:27] way that anybody can say things sing
[1:29:30] thank god i'm free as long as you're
[1:29:32] bound
[1:29:33] there's nobody that can sing there's
[1:29:35] power in the blood as long as you're
[1:29:38] still enslaved
[1:29:40] but if you can ever get free one time
[1:29:43] you can start singing thank god i'm free
[1:29:46] there's power in the blood of jesus
[1:29:49] christ
[1:29:51] well you notice these people had hanged
[1:29:53] their harps
[1:29:55] the thing that was built for worship the
[1:29:57] thing that was built for praise
[1:30:00] they hung it up on the willow trees
[1:30:05] i'm gonna deal with something real
[1:30:06] delicate right here
[1:30:08] but there's too many times people have
[1:30:10] been pushed aside to set their gifts
[1:30:13] over on a willow tree
[1:30:18] because they're trying to serve god out
[1:30:19] in some strange land
[1:30:24] i know what i'm talking about right here
[1:30:26] and i want to be real delicate but i
[1:30:27] want to i want to drive a point
[1:30:31] there's a person that's here that is
[1:30:33] that that is that is understanding
[1:30:35] exactly what i'm saying just now that
[1:30:37] was asked to hang their harp upon a on a
[1:30:39] willow tree i said we we're not going to
[1:30:42] have that here no more they were they
[1:30:44] were pushed in a corner that they
[1:30:45] wouldn't be able to have their praise
[1:30:47] the way that they wanted to but when
[1:30:49] they got into the land that they were
[1:30:51] destined to be here
[1:30:52] they were able to bring that heart off
[1:30:54] of that willow tree and really echo out
[1:30:57] the praises of the most high god you see
[1:31:00] because so many times it's not our own
[1:31:02] doing that does it but men try to push
[1:31:05] your gift over in a corner so that your
[1:31:07] gift doesn't shine and you watch when
[1:31:10] god designs a gift and he sets it up men
[1:31:13] can try to push it in a corner but god
[1:31:16] will make a way for it to shine out in
[1:31:18] its glory because he is the one that
[1:31:20] gifts and callings are without
[1:31:22] repentance
[1:31:24] if you've got a gift don't you let no
[1:31:26] man put you in a corner where you say
[1:31:28] well i don't necessarily have a gift can
[1:31:30] you say amen
[1:31:32] don't you ever let nobody put your gift
[1:31:35] over in a corner
[1:31:37] i say let liberty come in the church of
[1:31:40] the living god like never before it's
[1:31:42] not a time to hang up your hearts it's
[1:31:44] the time to get them down
[1:31:47] it's a time that you bring your
[1:31:49] menstrual out elijah and you start
[1:31:51] singing songs under the most high god
[1:31:55] [Applause]
[1:32:01] i'm gonna sing a song to you after a
[1:32:02] while and this means war
[1:32:05] and i'm gonna sing it to the devil you
[1:32:06] can't have my breakthrough
[1:32:08] you can't have my increase
[1:32:10] well i'm going to sing it just a little
[1:32:12] bit different a little bit later you
[1:32:13] can't have my message you can't have my
[1:32:16] dance you can't have my praise you can't
[1:32:18] have my preaching you can have my gift
[1:32:20] you can't have my heart you can't have
[1:32:22] my praise you can't have my dance you
[1:32:25] can't have my family you can't have my
[1:32:27] pastor you can't have this you can't
[1:32:29] have this you can't have this this means
[1:32:32] war
[1:32:36] if there ever was a time to seek a sword
[1:32:39] and a devil it's right now
[1:32:42] we're on the venice line it's time to
[1:32:45] run with everything that's within you
[1:32:47] [Applause]
[1:32:49] there ain't one chain on you brother
[1:32:50] randall there ain't one circumstance on
[1:32:52] you brother timmy it's time that you
[1:32:55] come into the land
[1:32:56] and sing
[1:32:57] [Applause]
[1:33:00] sing o'barren
[1:33:02] it's time to bring forth
[1:33:12] oh hallelujah
[1:33:16] hallelujah
[1:33:20] hallelujah
[1:33:25] but notice
[1:33:27] notice what brother branham says in
[1:33:28] broken sister it's a powerful message
[1:33:32] fits so perfectly with last night's
[1:33:34] message that was brought forth
[1:33:37] he said notice
[1:33:40] how the believer is liberated
[1:33:42] notice how he's liberated his ones
[1:33:45] who receive this water
[1:33:47] not a local rain
[1:33:49] not a revival from here and there
[1:33:52] and get the miss mill cramps and got
[1:33:53] wiggle tails in it
[1:33:55] but notice
[1:33:56] how he liberated his ones who received
[1:33:58] this water
[1:34:00] he said
[1:34:01] by grace not by a system or a cistern or
[1:34:04] an education
[1:34:05] he said he vindicates
[1:34:07] his word
[1:34:09] he said that's
[1:34:10] how he liberates the ones that received
[1:34:13] this water
[1:34:15] and you think about what you've been
[1:34:17] drinking on
[1:34:18] it's that artisan whale
[1:34:21] it's not where you're sad or you're
[1:34:23] satisfied with just one rain here or one
[1:34:25] rain on the weekend or one rain over
[1:34:27] here at a special meeting but it's a
[1:34:30] people that are feeding on the unfailing
[1:34:32] body word of the son of man
[1:34:34] and those that seek after the kingdom of
[1:34:36] god those that are hungry and thirst
[1:34:37] shall be filled
[1:34:39] and you watch how christ begins to
[1:34:41] liberate his people
[1:34:42] he comes down
[1:34:44] i happen to say i happen to say this is
[1:34:46] one of the greatest times of my whole
[1:34:48] entire life i've been preaching for 12
[1:34:49] years but i've never preached i've never
[1:34:51] preached a message people on this level
[1:34:53] before it's the same people but we're in
[1:34:55] a very special season that god is
[1:34:57] liberating his people with a rain that
[1:35:00] has came down from above i happen to
[1:35:02] believe this is that harvest rain
[1:35:04] it's that harvest rain that's getting
[1:35:06] that wheat exactly ready they're ready
[1:35:08] and you'll watch as the angels begin to
[1:35:10] bind up the tares and you watch as that
[1:35:12] weed begins to rejoice in the rain that
[1:35:15] came down
[1:35:17] the rain wasn't meant for the weed
[1:35:19] though there wasn't meant for the tares
[1:35:21] the tares rejoiced in it the tares
[1:35:23] praised the tares getting much excited
[1:35:26] about it just like you do but when the
[1:35:28] angels start binding up the tears and
[1:35:31] the rain comes down on the real wheat
[1:35:34] you watch that week shine like never
[1:35:36] before it's her rain it's her king
[1:35:40] hallelujah
[1:35:42] let me tell you that wheat when it gets
[1:35:44] under that rain and it gets stimulated
[1:35:46] it doesn't care what anybody else thinks
[1:35:49] it waves in the wind it blesses his name
[1:35:53] it brings a wave sheath before him
[1:35:59] do you see what happened down there just
[1:36:01] see what happened in louisiana just see
[1:36:04] what happened in tennessee did you see
[1:36:06] what happened in canada it's the
[1:36:08] rain
[1:36:10] it's a liberating rain
[1:36:15] this message didn't come to put you in
[1:36:17] some shackles it didn't come to bind you
[1:36:19] up this message came to liberate you and
[1:36:22] the bible said whom the son has set free
[1:36:24] is free
[1:36:25] indeed and you shall know the truth and
[1:36:28] the truth shall make you free
[1:36:30] for the lord the spirit of christ jesus
[1:36:33] christ have made me free from the law of
[1:36:36] sin and death
[1:36:40] you're free
[1:36:43] you're free
[1:36:45] now watch
[1:36:46] watch what jesus would do
[1:36:49] and notice how he takes it takes a woman
[1:36:52] of your fame
[1:36:54] and he comes to her
[1:36:56] at her life source
[1:37:00] he comes to her at her well
[1:37:04] i find it amazing that jesus will come
[1:37:05] to you where you are
[1:37:10] but it's amazing to watch what jesus
[1:37:11] does with you after you get done with
[1:37:13] your old well
[1:37:15] and you find a new one
[1:37:17] but notice what he did mother madam
[1:37:20] would take this woman
[1:37:23] prayer line after prayer line
[1:37:26] set up every single prayer line
[1:37:28] with this woman
[1:37:31] now what am i what was he doing he was
[1:37:33] he said now
[1:37:35] brother branham would say now now jesus
[1:37:37] when he was standing there he said he
[1:37:38] was catching her spirit he began to talk
[1:37:40] to her
[1:37:41] and he began to catch her spirit
[1:37:43] begin to talk to her where she was
[1:37:44] living at and know all those things
[1:37:47] branham said that jesus
[1:37:50] liberated her
[1:37:51] by the secrets of the heart
[1:37:55] he began to deal with her and you can go
[1:37:57] throughout you can go throughout about
[1:37:59] every message and you can find where the
[1:38:01] angel would come behind the message all
[1:38:03] the time and vindicate that this was the
[1:38:05] truth
[1:38:06] but you'll find almost in every single
[1:38:08] service that brother branham as he's
[1:38:09] setting up a prayer line he brings up
[1:38:11] this woman
[1:38:13] remember that woman at the well now now
[1:38:15] now sister you're standing here before
[1:38:16] me you're nervous you've got this you've
[1:38:19] got this condition that's going on
[1:38:21] and he said this is exactly how the
[1:38:23] master did it
[1:38:24] this is exactly how the master did it he
[1:38:26] caught her spirit they began to speak to
[1:38:28] her and he began to tell her the very
[1:38:30] secrets of her heart and he said she got
[1:38:32] her liberty by the secrets being known
[1:38:36] unto her and you watch what the spirit
[1:38:38] of the living god does when he takes
[1:38:40] that word of hebrews 4 and 12 that the
[1:38:42] word of god is quick and the discerner
[1:38:44] of the thoughts and the intents of the
[1:38:46] heart and it's amazing to watch that god
[1:38:48] would take a pastor or a preacher or an
[1:38:50] evangelist and he'll take him down an
[1:38:52] avenue because what is he trying to do
[1:38:54] he is trying to get the people of god to
[1:38:57] get into a spot where he can liberate
[1:38:59] them maybe in their mind maybe in their
[1:39:01] hearts maybe in their soul he's trying
[1:39:03] to liberate them so that man of god will
[1:39:05] go down through a channel and it looks
[1:39:07] like man this guy's so far off the map
[1:39:09] he's now he's nowhere near where i'm
[1:39:11] living at and you watch all of a sudden
[1:39:13] god will take a direct turn and he'll
[1:39:15] come down your tin can alley and what is
[1:39:17] he doing he is liberating you from the
[1:39:20] things that were holding you bound
[1:39:23] you remember when brother branham had
[1:39:24] that dream you remember when brother
[1:39:25] branham had that dream of that he fell
[1:39:28] asleep and there was that there was that
[1:39:29] man that was that was beating that woman
[1:39:31] brother branham thought at first that it
[1:39:33] was his mama that this man was beating
[1:39:34] his mama with that three corner club he
[1:39:36] was beating her and he said every single
[1:39:38] time that the woman would try to rise up
[1:39:40] and and accept the truth he said he
[1:39:43] began to beat her again he said but i
[1:39:45] began to recognize he said i began to
[1:39:47] recognize that that was the enemy and
[1:39:49] every time that she would begin to
[1:39:50] accept the the name of jesus christ
[1:39:52] baptism he said she was beating her with
[1:39:54] that trinitarian doctrine and he said
[1:39:57] every time i watched him he said he beat
[1:39:58] her he said but he said all of a sudden
[1:40:00] he said i was scared he said i was
[1:40:02] scared of him he said all of a sudden he
[1:40:04] said i reached up there and i grabbed
[1:40:05] him by the caller he said now you leave
[1:40:07] her alone or you're going to have to
[1:40:08] deal with me and brother baron said
[1:40:10] about that time he said his faith
[1:40:12] muscles begin to grow and he said he
[1:40:14] began to recognize he and he began to
[1:40:16] liberate her by the preaching of the
[1:40:19] name of jesus christ and you watch how
[1:40:21] the enemy comes in through every creed
[1:40:23] or every dogma he comes in and tries to
[1:40:26] beat the people down with a two-person
[1:40:28] god or a three priest a person god and
[1:40:30] he's trying to beat them down and put
[1:40:32] them in a corner so that they cannot
[1:40:34] accept the real liberty of the name of
[1:40:36] jesus christ but there was a prophet
[1:40:38] messenger that stood right here in this
[1:40:40] day in this laodicean church age and
[1:40:42] declared to you and i the power of the
[1:40:45] name of jesus christ and you watch every
[1:40:47] single time that satan comes against you
[1:40:50] and every time you begin to accept the
[1:40:52] truth and you begin to experience a
[1:40:54] little bit of liberty in the message of
[1:40:56] the hour satan will come and beat you
[1:40:58] down with a three-corner club you watch
[1:41:00] how he uses that thing and he'll beat
[1:41:02] you down but there is a power
[1:41:06] that you can experience in the power of
[1:41:09] this message
[1:41:12] don't you realize what satan is trying
[1:41:14] to do he's trying to push you over in a
[1:41:16] corner but i've already give you
[1:41:17] instructions what to do you push him in
[1:41:19] the corner don't you stand there and
[1:41:22] allow the the thwarted enemy and don't
[1:41:25] you allow him to push you back and say
[1:41:27] that you can't have this or you can't
[1:41:29] have this message or you can't have your
[1:41:31] breakthrough or you can't have your
[1:41:33] family
[1:41:35] it's a time that the church of the
[1:41:36] living god raise up not with a
[1:41:38] three-corner club but take the name of
[1:41:40] jesus christ take the rod of moses and
[1:41:43] beat down those pharaohs beat down those
[1:41:46] egyptians that are trying to keep you
[1:41:48] back there under the slave mentality
[1:41:50] it's time you be liberated miriam it's
[1:41:53] time that you get on the other side of
[1:41:55] your red sea grab your tambourine have
[1:41:57] yourself a praise break
[1:42:04] now watch
[1:42:05] he said but as long as satan can keep
[1:42:07] you afraid to claim your inheritance he
[1:42:10] said then he's got you
[1:42:12] and he said tonight maybe
[1:42:14] maybe a cancer has
[1:42:16] has conquered you maybe something else
[1:42:17] has taken a hold of you some disease or
[1:42:20] even the disease
[1:42:21] of sin or whatever it is it may look
[1:42:23] dark and gloomy to you now may look like
[1:42:25] you'll never recover
[1:42:27] maybe look like you can't get over that
[1:42:29] tb

[1:42:32] trouble whatever it is that tumor that
[1:42:34] crippled condition the doctor may may
[1:42:37] have every hope may say every hope is

[1:43:12] the one
[1:43:14] that is seeing the victory

[1:43:46] odyssey and flu jesus is looking at a
[1:43:49] people
[1:43:50] that are liberated
[1:43:52] but it's satan's tactic to keep you over
[1:43:55] here bound and looking through the eyes
[1:43:58] of humanity
[1:43:59] but if you can just shift your view just
[1:44:01] for a moment and look
[1:44:03] earnestly into the perfect law of

[1:47:44] upper room experience right now why
[1:47:45] don't you experience the same liberty
[1:47:47] that mary the mother of jesus christ's
[1:47:49] experience why don't you go on in the
[1:47:51] upper room where peter was a coward one
[1:47:53] path and on the other side he busted out
[1:47:55] preaching this message

[1:48:17] the way with jesus every devil can rise
[1:48:19] against me every circumstance and go
[1:48:22] against me but i'm going on with jesus

[1:48:37] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:48:40] [Applause]
[1:48:48] hallelujah
[1:48:53] you keep fanning it
[1:48:56] satan don't know what he's doing
[1:48:58] he don't know what he's messing with
[1:49:00] because we're not just justified
[1:49:03] we're not just sanctified
[1:49:05] we have been glorified
[1:49:07] what shall we say to these things of god
[1:49:09] before us
[1:49:10] so what power are you representing here
[1:49:12] today
[1:49:14] if jesus could stand there i i'm keep
[1:49:17] i'm gonna keep adding some fuel to this
[1:49:18] thing cause i got a feeling it's gonna
[1:49:20] blow here a little bit
[1:49:22] you better watch out
[1:49:24] brother ron's identified with explosions
[1:49:26] he's already been through one and knows
[1:49:28] how to come out on the other side
[1:49:34] we got somebody on our camp in our camp
[1:49:36] that knows how to go through the fire
[1:49:39] so i'm gonna keep building this guy this
[1:49:41] case up and we'll just let it blow here
[1:49:43] after a little bit if it's all right
[1:49:46] but if jesus could go there and when he
[1:49:48] was speaking to his disciples and his
[1:49:50] disciples came back and there was a
[1:49:52] father that came up there and his son
[1:49:54] was a lunatic and he and every time that
[1:49:56] that the enemy would come upon him he'd
[1:49:58] fall into the fire and he said look he
[1:50:00] said i brought my son unto your children
[1:50:02] under your disciples and he said they
[1:50:04] couldn't remove it off of it but jesus
[1:50:06] turned to them and they asked him said
[1:50:08] why couldn't we move this thing off of
[1:50:10] him he said because of your unbelief he
[1:50:12] said but if you can have the faith of a
[1:50:14] grain of a mustard seed you shall speak
[1:50:16] to this mountain and then we move from
[1:50:18] here to yonder notice what he said and
[1:50:21] nothing shall be impossible to you
[1:50:25] he didn't say to me he said to you and i
[1:50:27] speak the name of jesus to the church of
[1:50:29] the living god right here there is
[1:50:31] nothing that is impossible to a church
[1:50:34] that decides to believe
[1:50:36] if you believe for healing you better
[1:50:38] get ready you better watch out sickness
[1:50:40] will leave this place faster than you
[1:50:42] can imagine if you'll start believing in
[1:50:45] the power of healing
[1:50:49] let me tell you when jesus was standing
[1:50:51] up there and he was talking to his
[1:50:52] disciples in luke chapter 10 and he told
[1:50:54] him said now rejoice not because the
[1:50:56] enemies that your enemies are subject to
[1:50:59] you he said but rejoice that your names
[1:51:01] are written down in the lamb's book of
[1:51:04] life
[1:51:05] and then jesus said and behold i saw
[1:51:08] satan fallen like lightning
[1:51:11] what was it brother branham said it was
[1:51:12] when the church was receiving her power
[1:51:16] and when she was moving forward into the
[1:51:18] promises of god satan failed from the
[1:51:21] heavenly atmosphere and when you start
[1:51:23] believing for the impossible satan comes
[1:51:27] down as the prince of the power of the
[1:51:29] air
[1:51:30] i say yes
[1:51:32] yes now are we the sons of god
[1:51:36] it ain't some day coming
[1:51:38] it ain't someday in the future it's
[1:51:39] right now and i happen to believe that
[1:51:42] it's been provided there's a sacrifice
[1:51:44] that's been provided for your sin that's
[1:51:46] provided for your for for your healing
[1:51:48] it's provided for your freedom it's
[1:51:50] provided for your joy it's provided for
[1:51:53] your fee your peace i believe that every
[1:51:55] single one of you sitting here is an
[1:51:57] attribute of jesus christ and god is
[1:52:00] wanting to use you
[1:52:02] to manifest the very word of the shower
[1:52:10] i'm gonna keep driving
[1:52:11] i'm gonna keep driving right here
[1:52:13] every time i see a snake i don't just
[1:52:15] run over once i get it two or three
[1:52:17] times
[1:52:19] i think i don't hit this thing one or
[1:52:21] two times let's go ahead and get him one
[1:52:22] more time
[1:52:25] jesus christ is a perfect sacrifice that
[1:52:27] was provided for brother fred's surgery
[1:52:29] he was provided for your needs he was
[1:52:32] provided for your production and brother
[1:52:34] branham would say now if there's some
[1:52:35] serpent he said if there's a serpent
[1:52:37] that's got a foot and he's reaching out
[1:52:38] and grabbing me and it's attacking me he
[1:52:40] said i don't have to go down there and
[1:52:42] hit its foot he said all i have to do is
[1:52:44] reach over and hit it in the head and
[1:52:46] kill every organ in its body that way it
[1:52:49] can't attack me no more i'm gonna put
[1:52:51] you in reverse one more time i'm gonna
[1:52:53] run over top of you there is no weapon
[1:52:55] that is formed against me that shall
[1:52:57] prosper had felt good year of god little
[1:53:00] children and greater is he that is in
[1:53:02] you than he that is in the world now
[1:53:04] you're getting the point
[1:53:08] it's not by might it's not by power but
[1:53:11] by my spirit saith the lord
[1:53:14] [Applause]
[1:53:23] let's get him one more time he was
[1:53:26] wounded
[1:53:27] for our transgressions he was bruised
[1:53:30] for our iniquities the chastisement of
[1:53:32] our peace was upon him and by his
[1:53:35] stripes

[1:53:38] are healed

[1:55:57] god don't you dare let shake and pin you
[1:56:00] underneath a car or pin you in a corner
[1:56:03] stand there in your liberty and say
[1:56:05] satan i condemn the very works of the
[1:56:08] kingdom of hell take your hands off of
[1:56:10] god's property
[1:56:19] oh
[1:56:37] hallelujah
[1:56:40] let me get to my text
[1:56:48] oh that was free
[1:56:57] he cares for you
[1:57:00] he cares for you no matter where you are
[1:57:03] you might be an outsider on the outside
[1:57:05] of the wall
[1:57:06] but he cares for you
[1:57:08] he will come to you
[1:57:10] because he cares for you
[1:57:18] and rahab
[1:57:20] was an outsider he was an outcast
[1:57:24] but she had seen the power of the
[1:57:26] supernatural god
[1:57:27] because when you put on when you've been
[1:57:29] put on the outside of the city and
[1:57:30] nobody else wants you because of the
[1:57:31] lifestyle that you live in you start to
[1:57:33] see the outside what really what's
[1:57:35] really what's living like
[1:57:41] the same man putting you how satan may
[1:57:42] have put you out on the outside of the
[1:57:44] wall and give you a lifestyle
[1:57:48] gave you a lifestyle that it looked
[1:57:50] like well if she dies somebody else will
[1:57:53] take her place
[1:57:55] somebody else can fill in for her
[1:57:57] but she was coming to the end of her
[1:57:59] road she was about past her spot of
[1:58:01] prime and she was losing customers
[1:58:04] but she was on the outside
[1:58:06] and she was looking over there and she
[1:58:09] began to see a supernatural sign and
[1:58:11] they began to hear the murmurings and
[1:58:13] begin to hear about the supernatural god
[1:58:27] but she heard about a god that would
[1:58:29] lead a people when he was coming down in
[1:58:31] a pillar of fire and he was leading them
[1:58:34] i should begin to look and think if that
[1:58:36] god could do that for them people
[1:58:38] that were under that much slave
[1:58:40] mentality
[1:58:41] how much more does he care about me and
[1:58:43] my condition
[1:58:45] she begin to recognize and when you
[1:58:47] begin to recognize the presence of the
[1:58:49] living god it releases a power to you
[1:58:52] it'll set you free and this little rahab
[1:58:56] when she looked out there and there was
[1:58:58] two men that came by with a message and
[1:59:01] they came in there and she housed them
[1:59:03] in their notice when they came in there
[1:59:06] she lied to them and told them i don't
[1:59:09] know where they were but she was hiding
[1:59:12] that message in a secret spot
[1:59:15] she was hiding that message because she
[1:59:18] knew that it was her escape out of this
[1:59:20] chaos of life
[1:59:23] she was outcast but she was cared for by
[1:59:27] the king of kings
[1:59:28] and these two men made an oath with this
[1:59:31] woman
[1:59:33] they made an oath with this woman
[1:59:35] by the same
[1:59:37] by the same token that you let us down
[1:59:41] out of this window
[1:59:45] the same window that she was looking out
[1:59:47] and seeing the power of a supernatural
[1:59:50] god was the same window that she let
[1:59:52] those men down out of
[1:59:55] now she said now listen
[1:59:57] they said now listen
[2:00:00] look if you take up this token
[2:00:02] the blood of your family be upon you and
[2:00:05] not upon ourselves but i'm telling you
[2:00:08] as long as this token is there
[2:00:10] mamas and daddies let me tell you young
[2:00:12] girls let me tell you as long as this
[2:00:14] token is there
[2:00:16] the blood
[2:00:18] there you you cannot be guilty for
[2:00:19] yourself because there's somebody that's
[2:00:21] already paid for you
[2:00:22] mamas
[2:00:23] mamas right now is the time to play the
[2:00:25] token like never before right now is the
[2:00:28] time to go and listen to that message
[2:00:30] like never before he preaches it in 1963
[2:00:34] on my birthday
[2:00:35] september the 1st he preaches to you the
[2:00:38] token but he said these men made an oath
[2:00:41] with her that when the destroying angel
[2:00:43] comes by there by the name of joshua he
[2:00:46] will remember what we have said unto you
[2:00:50] let me say something to you i just was
[2:00:52] here and he remembers what we've said to
[2:00:55] you
[2:00:57] you're not going to leave here the same
[2:00:59] way you walked in here you may have
[2:01:01] walked in here one way but you're
[2:01:04] leaving here another
[2:01:09] can i give you a word of a prophet they
[2:01:11] told her said you go in there and you
[2:01:13] get your father and you get your mother
[2:01:15] you get your family and you get them on
[2:01:17] the inside of here and brother brandon
[2:01:19] said you take your token and you claim
[2:01:21] your children
[2:01:30] you may not be wanted by everybody else
[2:01:33] when i say this you're wanted by a
[2:01:34] captain
[2:01:37] because he cares for you
[2:01:40] what was it
[2:01:42] the token was her liberty
[2:01:45] the token was her way out
[2:01:47] and there is no other way outside of
[2:01:49] laodicea except for this token
[2:01:54] it ain't a tape
[2:01:57] it ain't a picture
[2:02:00] it's a life
[2:02:03] and the blood of jesus christ the life
[2:02:05] of jesus christ was set for you and i
[2:02:08] and you can walk out of your prison bars
[2:02:10] rahab
[2:02:11] everything is going to lack down around
[2:02:13] you everything is going to fall all
[2:02:15] around you but rahab ray have you had
[2:02:18] faith enough to believe in me and by
[2:02:21] your works your faith has been expressed
[2:02:27] hallelujah
[2:02:28] rahab
[2:02:29] i want you to get ready
[2:02:31] you're gathering everybody in here the
[2:02:33] token is your liberty everybody that you
[2:02:36] got in is going to go out free
[2:02:39] you remember when paul when silas was up
[2:02:41] there in acts 16 and 25 that the bible
[2:02:44] said at midnight paul and silas begin to
[2:02:47] pray and sing praises under god
[2:02:50] it was at the midnight hour
[2:02:53] when all hell was at its highest height
[2:02:56] you watch what brother branham says he
[2:02:57] said when the angel begins to deal with
[2:02:58] him it's about two or three o'clock in
[2:03:00] the morning he said it's when those
[2:03:01] devils are going to sleep here's but
[2:03:03] here at the midnight hour
[2:03:05] at the midnight hour paul and silas
[2:03:08] begin to sing praises unto god
[2:03:11] and they begin to sing in such a way
[2:03:14] that all of the prisoners heard them
[2:03:20] i tell you right now
[2:03:21] if you've been free by the power of
[2:03:23] jesus christ you ought to sing to every
[2:03:26] prisoner of sin ought to be able to hear
[2:03:27] you you ought to be able to praise to
[2:03:29] every prisoner of chains of sickness of
[2:03:32] complexes of anxiety every prisoner
[2:03:35] ought to be able to hear you
[2:03:38] and when they begin to sing
[2:03:41] maybe they got to sing in that song this
[2:03:43] means war
[2:03:44] i got joy in my soul
[2:03:46] god is in control i got satan on my
[2:03:49] trail but i'm singing all as well
[2:03:52] maybe they got up there and they were
[2:03:54] singing that song
[2:03:56] maybe they got singing sister mary ellen
[2:03:57] song every prayer he says to our god
[2:04:00] every word of worship is do i god
[2:04:03] maybe they got to sing in jeremiah song
[2:04:05] it's just like fire that shut up in my
[2:04:08] bones it's that holy ghost fire and shut
[2:04:13] up in my bones
[2:04:15] [Applause]
[2:04:17] [Music]
[2:04:19] and their praise
[2:04:21] they're praising when you think well
[2:04:23] is there really power in your praise
[2:04:29] rahab you might be on the inside but
[2:04:31] there's a shout on the outside that's
[2:04:32] going to get you out
[2:04:34] and paul and silas you may be on the
[2:04:36] inside and there might be prisoners on
[2:04:37] the inside of there with you but there's
[2:04:40] going to be a praise that'll get you out
[2:04:42] of here so it doesn't matter where your
[2:04:43] praise at your praise will get you out
[2:04:48] [Applause]
[2:04:51] and suddenly there was an earthquake
[2:04:54] and all of the prison doors flung wide
[2:04:58] there was something powerful when paul
[2:05:01] began to sing when paul began to praise
[2:05:04] there became an earthquake that the
[2:05:07] prison doors flung wide
[2:05:11] remember what the prison guard said
[2:05:13] said oh my goodness
[2:05:15] i'm going to commit suicide right here
[2:05:17] but paul said don't harm yourself
[2:05:20] don't you harm yourself we're still in
[2:05:22] here singing
[2:05:27] lay odyssey
[2:05:29] we have been set free from you
[2:05:31] every chain's been struck off of us
[2:05:34] every complex has been struck over us
[2:05:36] you can't hold us no more you can't
[2:05:39] hinder us no more but leonistia we're
[2:05:41] still here
[2:05:48] don't you harm yourself we're still here
[2:05:51] and there's hope for you
[2:05:53] what shall i do to be saved and paul
[2:05:56] took him out and baptized him in his
[2:05:58] house the same hour
[2:06:00] [Applause]
[2:06:01] oh let the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:06:04] move in this place

[2:06:13] experience liberty

[2:15:33] you start pulling your hearts off the
[2:15:35] willow trees
[2:15:36] and you start calling out and saying let
[2:15:39] every breath
[2:15:41] everything that hath breath praise ye
[2:15:43] the lord
[2:15:45] i will sing a new song unto the lord i
[2:15:48] would declare thy mighty works before
[2:15:51] this wicked generation i will sing i
[2:15:55] will sing yea i will sing and when you
[2:16:00] begin to break forth on the right hand
[2:16:02] and break forth on the left hand
[2:16:05] then god
[2:16:06] breaks forth
[2:16:14] notice now
[2:16:16] is not some time in the past
[2:16:19] now is not sometime in the future
[2:16:22] now
[2:16:24] is present
[2:16:26] it's in an instance
[2:16:30] i happen to believe
[2:16:32] that all things
[2:16:34] are possible to them
[2:16:36] that believe
[2:16:39] i believe
[2:16:40] in the most precious name that there is
[2:16:44] i believe in the one that came to set
[2:16:46] you free from the bondage of sin
[2:16:48] i believe in the one that is a cancer
[2:16:50] killer
[2:16:51] he's a tuberculosis killer
[2:16:55] he is an enemy
[2:16:57] killer
[2:16:58] and i happen to believe there ain't not
[2:17:00] one weapon that can stand before you
[2:17:02] that will prosper
[2:17:06] and i'd say let god have his liberty
[2:17:10] let god have his liberty so you can have
[2:17:12] your liberty
[2:17:14] let god break through so you can have
[2:17:15] your breakthrough
[2:17:18] young girls
[2:17:19] let me talk to you
[2:17:21] if you don't have a breakthrough you're
[2:17:23] gonna get left here
[2:17:25] if you don't really get serious and stop
[2:17:27] playing games
[2:17:28] god
[2:17:29] will do right by his word
[2:17:32] young boys
[2:17:33] it's not a time to play games
[2:17:38] young and older like it's not a time to

[2:18:07] look
[2:18:08] earnestly intently into the perfect law
[2:18:10] of liberty
[2:18:15] i say there's nothing too hard for him
[2:18:20] if he can roll a boy
[2:18:23] if he can roll a boy out of a tin can
[2:18:25] car
[2:18:26] and bring him out of a lie
[2:18:28] and bring forth an isaac
[2:18:32] he's more than able
[2:18:35] he's more than able to go through every
[2:18:37] one of every one of the one of your
[2:18:38] situations
[2:18:40] he's god for randy hinkle
[2:18:43] he's god for joe shifflet

[2:18:48] lambert he's god for timmy batten he's
[2:18:50] god for noah

[2:18:58] what you want done
[2:19:00] right now is a time for you to believe

[2:19:26] but i have come to declare war
[2:19:28] on hell

[2:19:34] and i will not bow down to the thoughts
[2:19:36] of men
[2:19:37] i am here simply as an instrument to be
[2:19:40] used by almighty god to liberate the
[2:19:42] sons of god so that they might be
[2:19:44] dressed in the message of the hour
[2:19:48] and if you've been living under a shadow
[2:19:50] maybe a wife telling you you did this or
