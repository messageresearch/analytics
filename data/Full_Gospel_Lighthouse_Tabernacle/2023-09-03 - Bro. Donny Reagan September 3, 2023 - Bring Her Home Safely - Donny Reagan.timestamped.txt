[1:06:58] working
[1:06:59] power amen we we just want to thank you
[1:07:02] for that Song of Solomon Chapter 3:
[1:07:07] 6 I realized brother Timothy and brother
[1:07:10] Tim didn't leave me a whole lot to
[1:07:14] say so I was thinking about preaching
[1:07:16] out the maps in my
[1:07:19] Bible because they covered everything
[1:07:21] from Genesis to
[1:07:22] Revelation but wasn't it awesome
[1:07:26] amen so
[1:07:31] wonderful so appreciate our brothers and
[1:07:33] their Ministry and their gift to the
[1:07:36] Lord and to God's
[1:07:38] people Song of Solomon chapter 3 verse
[1:07:43] six who is this that cometh out of the
[1:07:47] Wilderness like pillars of
[1:07:50] smoke perfumed with myrr and
[1:07:53] frankincense with all powders of the
[1:07:56] merchant behold his bed which is
[1:08:00] Solomon's three score Valiant men or
[1:08:03] about it of the Valiant of Israel they
[1:08:08] all hold
[1:08:11] swords now remember they all hold swords
[1:08:15] being
[1:08:17] expert being expert in war Hallelujah
[1:08:23] they all hold swords being an expert in
[1:08:27] war every man hath his sword upon his
[1:08:33] thigh notice where it's located upon his
[1:08:36] thigh and this is the reason because of
[1:08:41] fear in the
[1:08:43] night King Solomon made himself a
[1:08:47] chariot of the wood of Lebanon how may
[1:08:51] like to be remembered today as we pray
[1:08:53] God bless you me too
[1:08:56] Heavenly Father we are so grateful for
[1:08:59] this time that we can be
[1:09:02] together Lord God we realize that the
[1:09:06] world about us is dying darkness is
[1:09:09] moving in on the earth and we know the
[1:09:12] last plague is spiritual death and while
[1:09:16] death is striking everywhere around us
[1:09:19] we're so grateful that we're in the Ark
[1:09:21] of Safety and life is preserving us
[1:09:25] we've gathered here these few days and
[1:09:28] today is the last one and it's passed so
[1:09:31] quickly so much preparation so much
[1:09:33] prayer so much effort been put forth for
[1:09:37] these meetings we just pray Lord that
[1:09:40] there would be life changing things that
[1:09:42] have happened to these people for those
[1:09:44] who do not come here this is not their
[1:09:46] home church that they'll be able to take
[1:09:48] something back to their Church their
[1:09:50] assembly their family something Lord
[1:09:53] that can benefit them as well for we
[1:09:57] know we don't just come to special
[1:09:59] meetings this way that we can be able to
[1:10:01] receive for ourself but something that
[1:10:03] we can be be able to be changed and take

[1:10:31] God In The Name Of The Lord Jesus and
[1:10:34] the Saints said am you may be
[1:10:44] seated I'd like to speak to you this
[1:10:46] morning for just a little bit on bring
[1:10:49] her safely
[1:10:53] home for those of you you that are aware
[1:10:56] of the Song of Solomon you know that
[1:10:58] it's one of the mysterious books of the
[1:11:01] Bible Jews will not even allow their
[1:11:05] children to read The Song of Solomon
[1:11:08] until they're adults The Song of Solomon
[1:11:12] in the hidic Jewish culture it's called
[1:11:16] the holy of
[1:11:18] holies because it contains so much in
[1:11:21] there to a lot of people they don't even
[1:11:24] think it's inspired of course a lot of
[1:11:26] theologians have debated through the
[1:11:27] years that it was not really um meant to
[1:11:30] be in the Bible but yet we know that it
[1:11:34] contains much about us in there and it's
[1:11:39] a very beautiful story because it
[1:11:41] portrays the story of redemption which
[1:11:43] we love and we're part of that it opens
[1:11:47] up of course with Song of Solomon
[1:11:48] chapter one verse one and it gives us
[1:11:51] conveys to us a story of this great king
[1:11:55] Solomon and he was out and about his
[1:11:59] kingdom going about to look in different
[1:12:02] parts of Israel and see what God had had
[1:12:05] given them and he comes upon this
[1:12:08] certain Vineyard and he finds this
[1:12:11] beautiful young woman there now remember
[1:12:15] Solomon had all types of wives and it
[1:12:17] was a customary in that day of course
[1:12:20] but he run across one that was just more
[1:12:25] special than all the rest we don't even
[1:12:28] know her name but we she is identified
[1:12:32] by coming from the area of shunum so
[1:12:36] she's called a shulamite Solomon the
[1:12:39] word Solomon means peace and shulamite
[1:12:44] is the feminis form of Peace So he was
[1:12:49] Mr peace she was mpace
[1:12:53] Hallelujah Solomon is so Smitten by his
[1:12:56] love for her that he wants to make her
[1:13:00] his
[1:13:00] own and she feels so inadequate she says
[1:13:05] I am black and I am not beautiful and my
[1:13:09] my mothers my son my mother's sons
[1:13:12] rather they they looked upon me and they
[1:13:15] beat me and she goes to describing all
[1:13:18] of her faults and all the things about
[1:13:20] her making excuses for why she could not
[1:13:24] be worthy to be joined up to this man
[1:13:27] and remember this is a man that God has
[1:13:30] attributed such wisdom that there was
[1:13:32] not a man like him in the Old Testament
[1:13:34] that God had give him not only
[1:13:36] discernment but also of great wisdom you
[1:13:38] can imagine her now coming from a poor
[1:13:41] country um she there's no mention of her
[1:13:43] father so apparently her father was dead
[1:13:45] but her brothers were her Guardians so
[1:13:48] to be married in that day you'd have to
[1:13:49] go through the male figures in order to
[1:13:52] get her and she was overwhelmed first of
[1:13:55] all that Solomon would even want her why
[1:13:57] would he take any interest in her at all
[1:14:00] uh it was a great cultural thing for
[1:14:02] them in that day for the women not to be
[1:14:05] out in the sun very much because that
[1:14:07] Middle Eastern sun was so hot so it
[1:14:09] would tan them and um the finer women
[1:14:13] the upper cultured women were the ones
[1:14:15] that were fairer skinned because it was
[1:14:18] a sign of wealth in other words you
[1:14:20] would have somebody to sweep your porch
[1:14:22] you didn't do it you had somebody to
[1:14:24] pick your beans and your maters and your
[1:14:26] ters you didn't do it you stayed in the
[1:14:29] house and you stayed cool but this woman
[1:14:32] was unlike the rest of those fair
[1:14:35] skinned delicate type of women so she
[1:14:39] had the identity of wear and tear no
[1:14:42] doubt her hands must have had some
[1:14:45] cracks and crevices and even a few
[1:14:47] calluses and she would have been dark
[1:14:50] relatively compared to some of the other
[1:14:52] women and she could not see in herself
[1:14:55] as brother Tim brought it so beautifully
[1:14:57] to us last night wasn't that awesome she
[1:14:59] could not see in herself what Solomon
[1:15:03] saw in her now this man was a man who
[1:15:06] had all types of women come to his court
[1:15:09] he he was very great close acquaintances
[1:15:13] was the king of hyi the king of Lebanon
[1:15:16] and the king of the surrounding
[1:15:18] countries he made friendships with them
[1:15:19] because he needed Cedar he needed silver
[1:15:22] he needed gold he needed purple he needs
[1:15:25] loss of those things so he was a man of
[1:15:26] great Commerce so he contacted all of
[1:15:29] those and no doubt they wanted their
[1:15:31] daughters to be able to marry him
[1:15:33] because who wouldn't want to be married
[1:15:35] to King Solomon and this woman whenever
[1:15:39] she was spotted by him and Solomon I
[1:15:41] want you to notice the way that it
[1:15:43] mentions this about Solomon and it
[1:15:45] sticks out in verse 7 notice verse 7
[1:15:48] behold his bed which is Solomon's three
[1:15:51] score Valiant men are about it of the
[1:15:55] Ian of Israel now the word bed there
[1:15:57] actually the Hebrew word is mat metah so
[1:16:01] it was a couch or a bed or a buyer b i e
[1:16:06] r this is what the Lord Jesus touched
[1:16:08] the young man that had died and he was
[1:16:10] laying on this so the word matah is a
[1:16:13] bed or a a litter actually it's called
[1:16:15] as well and it comes from the root word
[1:16:18] which means to stretch out so it was it
[1:16:21] would have been something like the
[1:16:24] Indians would use and my visits to India
[1:16:26] I've actually seen them still using
[1:16:28] there that there so it was a lowered
[1:16:31] type of covered couch and according to
[1:16:34] your wealth you you could identify the
[1:16:37] wealth of the person by looking at their
[1:16:40] mat so they would have only room for one
[1:16:44] person in this mat so the identification
[1:16:47] of Solomon is identified by what he is
[1:16:51] writing on now remember my ter sermon
[1:16:54] title is BR her home safely so Solomon
[1:16:58] now he has he's been able to achieve a
[1:17:00] lot of great things he's built the house
[1:17:02] of God he built his own house and he was
[1:17:04] able to build things that like had never
[1:17:06] been seen before in the Kingdom of
[1:17:09] Israel so now he points toward
[1:17:11] establishing his kingdom and being able
[1:17:14] to be identified as what he was the son
[1:17:18] of David So in doing that he must not
[1:17:20] only build the house of God but he must
[1:17:23] be able to make a hype for the bride now
[1:17:27] this woman is absolutely a type of the
[1:17:30] Bride I'm sure you believe that so
[1:17:32] Solomon takes his own personal couch now
[1:17:36] he's out on this buyer this matah and
[1:17:40] whenever he's out going through in
[1:17:42] Galilee if you've never been there we
[1:17:44] was privileged several years ago with be
[1:17:45] with brother Tim and sister Karen there
[1:17:48] on a trip that we made and lots of
[1:17:50] Israel has no trees Barren Rocky nothing
[1:17:53] but sand and dust but when you move into
[1:17:56] Galilee which shunum was part of that
[1:17:58] District of Galilee when you move there
[1:18:01] you find the beautiful sea of ganes or
[1:18:03] the the Sea of Galilee and you see
[1:18:05] around it and beautiful trees and grass
[1:18:08] and just an awesome place just
[1:18:10] absolutely beautiful and shunum is not
[1:18:13] so far from that up in the northern part
[1:18:15] of Israel and this girl probably raised
[1:18:18] poor and probably thought she'd never
[1:18:21] even have a man that would love her or
[1:18:24] care for her
[1:18:25] but little did she know her Destiny was
[1:18:28] to be intertwined with the King of
[1:18:33] Kings so the idea is that God had this
[1:18:37] man now this is in his tight making era
[1:18:40] what he was would been riding on the
[1:18:42] Indians called it a Peloquin now Solomon
[1:18:46] then had made all these things for
[1:18:48] himself so Solomon made his own mat
[1:18:53] Solomon made his own Chariot Solomon
[1:18:57] made the Stables Solomon made and had
[1:19:01] all of these great things but now he's
[1:19:03] found a wife which is not to be
[1:19:06] identified with the rest of the women of
[1:19:09] the harim this is what it was called so
[1:19:12] he had all kinds of women or churches
[1:19:16] that were identified around him but this
[1:19:19] one took his
[1:19:21] heart you see when you read in the song
[1:19:24] of Solomon and you can hear about a
[1:19:27] relationship it's it's quite beautiful
[1:19:29] if you haven't read it in a while and
[1:19:31] it's quite beautiful in how that they
[1:19:33] are displaying their love each to the
[1:19:35] other and they use terms that are quite
[1:19:39] typical for that time frame but it also
[1:19:42] identifies her identity on the earth so
[1:19:46] she talks about what he is and she
[1:19:49] Compares him to certain fragrances and
[1:19:52] certain things that she was aware of
[1:19:55] and he finds where she is and he talks
[1:19:58] to her in the way that she can
[1:20:01] understand it let me give you an example
[1:20:03] so he talked about her and he said that
[1:20:06] her hair was like goat's hair now
[1:20:09] Brothers just in case you're wondering
[1:20:11] that's not something you'd want to speak
[1:20:12] to a young girl today if you're wanting
[1:20:15] a girlfriend don't tell her she's got
[1:20:17] goats
[1:20:18] hair cuz that'll be the first and last
[1:20:20] time you'll speak to her no doubt so
[1:20:23] what you have to do have to find the
[1:20:25] language that she speaks and be able to
[1:20:27] know what to say but you see for them
[1:20:30] whenever he looked and he saw her hair
[1:20:33] it was a great thing especially the ver
[1:20:35] the black goats because they were the
[1:20:37] ones of the highest order and the
[1:20:39] highest breeding and their hair was such
[1:20:42] exotic fine fine hair so and she would
[1:20:46] identify back with him and she would
[1:20:48] talk of how he smell and then he would
[1:20:50] take the identification of her and he
[1:20:53] would describe her back and forth and
[1:20:55] people would read and think what in the
[1:20:57] world are they even talking about and he
[1:21:00] would describe her breast and he would
[1:21:02] describe her body and he would describe
[1:21:05] her nature and her makeup then she in
[1:21:07] turn would come around and she would
[1:21:09] describe him and the other people were
[1:21:12] just sitting there reading and say I
[1:21:13] don't know what they're even saying to
[1:21:15] you I mean what are they even talking
[1:21:16] about and when you read that you
[1:21:18] realized that they had broke into one
[1:21:20] another's love language you see this is
[1:21:24] a problem a lot of our marriages even
[1:21:26] around the message that a lot of men
[1:21:28] they convey their language to their wife
[1:21:31] which is not necessarily the language
[1:21:33] their wife speaks and sometimes the wife
[1:21:36] will convey her language to the husband
[1:21:38] and the husband don't understand nothing
[1:21:41] she's talking about and they don't spend
[1:21:44] enough time studying and understanding
[1:21:46] each other's language so they can be
[1:21:48] able to convey to each other but this is
[1:21:51] one thing that makes the Lord Jesus such
[1:21:53] an outstanding husband
[1:21:55] he had to come down to the Earth to be
[1:21:57] able to take on himself Humanity he had
[1:22:01] to come down to become one of us and be
[1:22:04] able to take on our language now granted
[1:22:07] whenever he was here he would talk in
[1:22:09] Heavenly language sometimes and he would
[1:22:11] talk in Earthly language and St John 11
[1:22:13] he did that whenever he said that
[1:22:15] Lazarus was asleep talking in Heavenly
[1:22:17] language and then finally the disciples
[1:22:20] couldn't understand him so he said
[1:22:22] Lazarus is dead so he'd have to Swit
[1:22:24] switch over from Heavenly language to
[1:22:26] their language and then they could
[1:22:28] understand it but you see our Lord come
[1:22:30] to the Earth so that he might be able to
[1:22:32] speak to us in such a way that would
[1:22:35] bring us to the paths of redemption this
[1:22:38] is why the message of the hour it's not
[1:22:41] for
[1:22:42] everybody well come on somebody say Amen
[1:22:45] we realize that our message is not for
[1:22:47] everybody and we've come to realize in
[1:22:50] the last few years it's not even been
[1:22:52] for everybody that's been around it
[1:22:54] there's been a lot of folks that have
[1:22:56] left in the last few years because they
[1:22:59] realize this message was not for them
[1:23:01] well I feel sorry for him but I'm just
[1:23:04] glad I know it's for me aren't you glad
[1:23:07] it's for me amen I love it today more
[1:23:11] than I've ever loved it in my
[1:23:13] life amen and I say praise be to God for
[1:23:16] it because this this is my year 1983 we
[1:23:20] come to the message so we're in 2023 so
[1:23:23] 40 years I've been in this message and I
[1:23:25] love it now more than ever before
[1:23:30] amen and it's not just because brother
[1:23:33] brandham was from Kentucky either now I
[1:23:35] was born and raised about 35 miles from
[1:23:38] where he was born uh born and raised
[1:23:40] about 30 mi from where the fish was
[1:23:42] resurrected about 60 mies from where the
[1:23:44] squirrels were created a lot of those
[1:23:46] things happened in Kentucky so God must
[1:23:48] like Kentucky but I never even knew
[1:23:50] anything about William brandham never
[1:23:53] heard nothing about it until I'd already
[1:23:55] been preaching years in Pentecost and
[1:23:58] yet I realized there was a season and a
[1:24:00] time but yet some people this message is
[1:24:03] so rich it makes them sick to their
[1:24:06] stomach that's why a lot of them are
[1:24:09] vomiting it up that's why they're
[1:24:11] following to believe the sign and they
[1:24:13] don't believe the sign nor the word
[1:24:15] that's right but aren't you glad even
[1:24:17] though Mama turns away daddy turns away
[1:24:20] this one turns away you ain't going
[1:24:23] nowhere because you have found where you
[1:24:27] fit in the word of the
[1:24:32] hour I want you to notice in verse seven
[1:24:35] here that the Bible says behold his bed
[1:24:38] which is Solomon's notice the
[1:24:40] identification that's placed upon this
[1:24:42] means of Transport his bed which is
[1:24:46] Solomon's three score Valiant men are
[1:24:49] about it so now here we're in the stage
[1:24:52] to where that it's moved Beyond the
[1:24:54] espousal which is what would take place
[1:24:56] so when the espousal would take in take
[1:24:58] place in the Hebrew marriage the girl
[1:25:00] could not run away with the boy they
[1:25:02] didn't have anything like that it just
[1:25:03] didn't work it had to come through the
[1:25:06] mother and father because they looked as
[1:25:08] the marriage as being a contract not
[1:25:10] only between a man and a woman but
[1:25:12] between two families so they would come
[1:25:14] together they would drink a cup of wine
[1:25:16] and they would make this marriage
[1:25:18] contract now the the groom himself never
[1:25:21] actually dealt with the bride but it was
[1:25:24] either a lawyer or the friend of the
[1:25:26] Bride John the Baptist identified
[1:25:27] himself in that when he said the
[1:25:29] bridegroom he he rejoices he says the
[1:25:32] friend of the bridegroom rejoices when
[1:25:34] he hears the bridegroom's voice what did
[1:25:36] John mean John had been the friend of
[1:25:39] the bridegroom he foran the bridegroom
[1:25:42] to tell the bride your husband's coming
[1:25:45] your husband's coming so when John heard
[1:25:48] the groom the Lord Jesus speaking
[1:25:50] directly to the bride John said I've
[1:25:53] completed my race and I'm done why
[1:25:56] because John had been able to betro
[1:25:59] those elect in that day so now here this
[1:26:02] would have happened to this in this
[1:26:04] little shulamite woman and what they
[1:26:06] would do when a boy baby is born in the
[1:26:08] Jewish Family they plant a tree when a
[1:26:10] girl baby is born they plant a different
[1:26:12] kind of tree that tree will grow and
[1:26:14] grow and whenever they get ready to get
[1:26:16] married they will cut down his tree and
[1:26:19] her tree they will then cut those trees
[1:26:21] in half they will make four poles and
[1:26:24] they will put it under a canvas called a
[1:26:26] hoopah anybody ever heard that word
[1:26:28] before hoopah so under the hoopah after
[1:26:31] the engagement they will come together
[1:26:33] and they will Zen they will exchange
[1:26:35] their final vows they will drink the
[1:26:38] final cup of wine then he will take her
[1:26:41] into the tent and there he will reveal
[1:26:44] himself to her now Matthew chapter 25
[1:26:47] the Kingdom of Heaven shall be likened
[1:26:49] unto 10 virgins five were wise five were
[1:26:51] foolish while they all slumbered and
[1:26:53] slept the brid went out and the call
[1:26:55] goes out behold to meet the bridegroom
[1:26:57] but notice this is not the bride Matthew
[1:26:59] 25 is not the bride it's the foolish
[1:27:02] virgins and the wi virgins but the bride
[1:27:04] is not even mentioned remember Jesus
[1:27:06] gives us two Parables of Matthew Matthew
[1:27:08] 22 and Matthew 25 and one of them
[1:27:11] relates to the marriage of the King's
[1:27:12] son and the other is the guest you are
[1:27:15] not those guest you are the queen you
[1:27:19] are not those guests that's being
[1:27:21] invited to the wedding You're the Reason
[1:27:24] there is a wedding praise the Lord you
[1:27:27] are the reason that there is a
[1:27:31] wedding now I want you to notice that
[1:27:33] whenever it would take place generally
[1:27:35] the betral or the engagement would last
[1:27:38] about a year the reason is that is to be
[1:27:40] able to prove that that woman is not
[1:27:42] with seed of another man we've been
[1:27:45] going through that cycle in the message
[1:27:47] for a long time each generation gets
[1:27:49] their chance at a Revival so when one
[1:27:51] generation dies another generation comes
[1:27:54] and this is what's ongoing right now
[1:27:56] it's proven some of these people that
[1:27:58] have been around the message including
[1:28:00] message preachers have been with seed of
[1:28:03] another man that's why they can stand
[1:28:05] for 30 years or 40 years or whatever and
[1:28:08] preach the message and turn and walk
[1:28:11] away God have mercy is the only thing I
[1:28:13] can say oh my but the real bride will
[1:28:17] remain faithful because her womb in her
[1:28:20] mind and in her soul Belongs to the Lord
[1:28:23] Jesus not the devil may I say to the
[1:28:26] kingdom of hell today you might as well
[1:28:29] fold up your arms you might as well go
[1:28:32] ahead and surrender because the bride
[1:28:35] will not be defeated Satan will never
[1:28:40] take down this bride because she is
[1:28:43] ordained of life she is ordained of God
[1:28:47] all hell can never make her bow she will
[1:28:51] still be standing when all the Earth
[1:28:54] Hallelujah has been shaken when the
[1:28:57] nuclear bombs fall the bride will still
[1:29:01] be standing on God's promised word when
[1:29:04] there is no more cancer you still will
[1:29:08] be when there is no more devil you still
[1:29:13] will be because you are part of eternal
[1:29:19] life hallelujah hallelujah
[1:29:25] [Music]
[1:29:32] hallelujah
[1:29:34] hallelujah oh I feel sorry for those
[1:29:37] that turn away but we know it's
[1:29:40] necessary you know Jesus spoke a lot of
[1:29:43] great things and Judas heard a lot of
[1:29:45] great things I'm sure you know St John
[1:29:48] 14 when Jesus begins to write or say let
[1:29:51] not your heart be troubled you believe
[1:29:52] in God believe also in me and my
[1:29:54] father's house are many mansions if it
[1:29:56] were not so I would have told you you
[1:29:58] understand I know in St John 13 after
[1:30:00] the foot washing that Judas leaves St
[1:30:02] John 14 begins now with the 11 it begins
[1:30:06] with the 11 and the Lord Jesus St John
[1:30:09] 14 15 16 17 18 whenever you're coming up
[1:30:13] to that that is some of the most
[1:30:15] intimate verses of scripture in the New
[1:30:18] Testament Judas is now gone and the Lord
[1:30:21] Jesus is speaking to his bride I'm we
[1:30:24] hate to see it but there's got to be a
[1:30:26] Judas that'll pull away from us and
[1:30:28] whenever they do the Lord Jesus will
[1:30:30] start working his Works in a way like
[1:30:33] we've only dreamed Hallelujah remember
[1:30:36] on the way to emus when he raised from
[1:30:39] the dead it was him that sat there and
[1:30:41] performed the great Supernatural and
[1:30:44] they said no doubt this is him we know
[1:30:46] him by the way he's breaking bread amen
[1:30:49] I believe he's still on the Earth today
[1:30:52] taking men of God moving them aside and
[1:30:55] breaking the bread of life to the
[1:31:00] bride
[1:31:02] Hallelujah now here she
[1:31:05] comes oh I cannot imagine the
[1:31:08] anxiety and the
[1:31:11] worry this is a country girl let me ask
[1:31:15] you folks are you all getting ready for
[1:31:17] City
[1:31:22] Life are y'all getting ready ready for
[1:31:24] City Life you better be getting
[1:31:27] ready
[1:31:29] hallelujah
[1:31:31] hallelujah oh she's known as the country
[1:31:35] rural ways you know how that most of us
[1:31:37] probably country folks can you imagine
[1:31:41] her thinking in her mind how will I
[1:31:44] act how will I behave him and there will
[1:31:47] be diplomats and their wives people from
[1:31:49] this Embassy and that Embassy and there
[1:31:51] will be how in the world will I act and
[1:31:53] I mean what she knew about was cinnamon
[1:31:55] and and you know lies and flowers and
[1:31:59] trees that that was where she lived that
[1:32:02] was what she
[1:32:03] Ted and they showed up at her
[1:32:07] door three score men
[1:32:13] 60 I'm sure you remember the Tabernacle
[1:32:15] in the wilderness and the way it was
[1:32:17] laid out first it was set up beyond the
[1:32:20] camp then they enter into a further
[1:32:23] stage of the re ation of the Tabernacle
[1:32:25] and when they do they move the
[1:32:26] Tabernacle in the middle of the camp and
[1:32:28] then they got the tribes this way this
[1:32:31] way this way and this way and when you
[1:32:36] look at that the way it's perfectly
[1:32:38] projected by the numbers in the tribes
[1:32:40] Judah being the largest what you will
[1:32:43] see is the
[1:32:45] figure of the
[1:32:49] Cross and the Tabernacle is right where
[1:32:52] the cross beams
[1:32:55] me
[1:32:57] Hallelujah God showing in the Old
[1:32:59] Testament this is where I meet my people
[1:33:03] and God told Moses let them build me a
[1:33:06] tabernacle that I can live among them
[1:33:09] can you imagine how almighty God for
[1:33:12] millions of years has been waiting for
[1:33:16] that service last
[1:33:20] night you think you want to see him
[1:33:23] that's only half the story can you
[1:33:25] imagine how he longs to see you can you
[1:33:29] imagine how he's long for this day when
[1:33:32] he could get his people to this stage
[1:33:34] and the message over years we spend in
[1:33:36] the initial stages God sent a prophet
[1:33:39] God sent a prophet we all rallied around
[1:33:41] that we're not saying that that's not
[1:33:43] important it is important but now we're
[1:33:46] understanding we have a position also
[1:33:49] Malachi 456 does not just speak about
[1:33:53] brother br
[1:33:54] but it speaks about God and it speaks
[1:33:57] about brother brandham and it speaks
[1:33:59] about you behold I God will send unto
[1:34:03] you as a matter of fact God mentions you
[1:34:06] before he mentions brother brandom
[1:34:08] behold I will send unto you Elijah the
[1:34:12] prophet and he will turn the hearts of
[1:34:15] the children to the father what father
[1:34:17] as we heard both Services the apostolic
[1:34:20] fathers that's where we're being
[1:34:22] restored to and what's the Lord Jesus
[1:34:25] going to do he's going to use Mighty
[1:34:28] Valiant men and they're going to bring
[1:34:31] her home safely Hallelujah they don't
[1:34:35] have an agenda they don't have a
[1:34:38] denomination they don't have a desire to
[1:34:41] build a kingdom they have one purpose
[1:34:45] bring you home
[1:34:48] safely this is the real desire of true
[1:34:52] men of God get you there
[1:34:59] [Applause]
[1:35:04] safely so this is the
[1:35:08] Peloquin the solom and himself rote
[1:35:12] on and it shows up at her
[1:35:20] door imagine she goes to the door and
[1:35:22] she oh my
[1:35:26] Lord we've come to get you fair
[1:35:31] lady to take you to your
[1:35:35] king
[1:35:40] Hallelujah nervously waiting
[1:35:43] anticipation maybe trying to learn how
[1:35:45] to walk you know how do that they
[1:35:54] it was a
[1:35:55] whole new
[1:35:59] life powerless
[1:36:03] life she had to talk different you see
[1:36:06] this is why people saying when you're a
[1:36:08] mom and dad whenever they heard you come
[1:36:10] to the message maybe some of you young
[1:36:11] people or some of you family said
[1:36:13] they're in a cult everything about them
[1:36:15] is different they're walking different
[1:36:17] they're dressing different well of
[1:36:18] course you're getting used to Palace
[1:36:20] life you can't talk the way you used to
[1:36:23] talk you can't act the way you used to
[1:36:26] act we don't say the same things we used
[1:36:29] to say we don't hang around the same
[1:36:32] people we used to hang around amen we've
[1:36:36] got to get used to hanging around Angels
[1:36:39] not demons people that are in
[1:36:42] righteousness not wickedness
[1:36:45] [Applause]
[1:36:57] of course it was up to the
[1:37:00] bridegroom to send her the clothes she
[1:37:05] needed if some of you folks saw me
[1:37:07] working around my
[1:37:09] house I'll have an old on an
[1:37:12] old pair of blue
[1:37:14] jeans t-shirt depends on what I'm doing
[1:37:18] I may be laying stone or doing whatever
[1:37:22] sweating W smell good sweat running down
[1:37:26] my face and maybe I'll need something
[1:37:29] and I'll tell Carol I got to go to Lo CU
[1:37:30] she said you're not going like
[1:37:38] that why I wouldn't be dressed for the
[1:37:43] occasion you see you come here today
[1:37:45] dressed for the occasion right you
[1:37:49] didn't show up in your bakery clothes if
[1:37:51] you're a chef or you didn't show up in
[1:37:52] your easy work clothes you cleaned up
[1:37:55] thank you for doing that for all the
[1:37:56] rest of us you took a shower a baths or
[1:37:59] whatever that you did and you dressed
[1:38:01] for the occasion you look very
[1:38:04] nice but she did not have the clothes
[1:38:08] that she needed for such an
[1:38:13] occasion but it was the bridegroom's
[1:38:15] responsibility to provide for the bride
[1:38:18] something that would be
[1:38:21] fitting she could not afford such a
[1:38:24] dress she could not afford such a great
[1:38:27] thing as that and she knew that and he
[1:38:29] knew that neither can I stand before him
[1:38:33] in righteousness on my own neither can I
[1:38:36] with all my years of preaching all your
[1:38:38] years of whatever you've done we would
[1:38:41] be filthy and he knows that so what did
[1:38:44] he do he provided us a wedding garment
[1:38:48] he provided us a message in the last
[1:38:51] days and the prophet said if I can get
[1:38:54] her to stand still long enough to dress
[1:38:57] her in the Closs of the
[1:39:00] word don't you understand what church
[1:39:03] does for you it's dressing
[1:39:07] you that's
[1:39:11] right you imagine as they bring out this
[1:39:14] beautiful thing she says oh my goodness
[1:39:17] I've never seen anything like it in my
[1:39:20] life what what should I do put it on
[1:39:24] Fair Lady that's
[1:39:26] right your Royal
[1:39:33] Highness you imagine how awkward that
[1:39:36] must have been the first time
[1:39:39] anyone bow to
[1:39:42] her let me ask you how do you figure
[1:39:44] it's going to
[1:39:48] feel when you walk into heaven the first
[1:39:51] day and the angels of
[1:40:00] God the Lord Jesus had not prepared your
[1:40:03] new city before he came to the Earth but
[1:40:08] actually said I'm going away to do it
[1:40:10] what it's been under construction for
[1:40:12] many years and according to the church
[1:40:13] age book it's about done then the gates
[1:40:17] had already been hung the streets had
[1:40:19] already been
[1:40:20] laid and those Angelic beings sarap
[1:40:23] cherubims zooms all the Angelic host are
[1:40:28] anxiously breathlessly
[1:40:30] awaiting for who
[1:40:37] you you see sometimes this awesome
[1:40:40] presence that we feel it's the Lord
[1:40:42] letting the Angels come down to just
[1:40:45] Embrace us as it was to get us used to
[1:40:49] where we're going
[1:40:53] huah can you imagine when the angels of
[1:40:55] God said when we the prophet said
[1:40:57] whenever we stand here upon this earth
[1:40:59] and the angels will circle the Earth
[1:41:02] with bowed
[1:41:06] heads they have worshiped him since the
[1:41:08] day they were created for millions of
[1:41:11] years maybe they've sung they've adored
[1:41:14] they've worshiped they have praised but
[1:41:16] one day it will be that they will have
[1:41:19] nothing to
[1:41:21] say because you we'll take it from
[1:41:26] them they will be
[1:41:29] speechless that's right as we begin to
[1:41:33] sing
[1:41:37] Amazing
[1:41:40] Grace how
[1:41:45] sweet and the angels just bow their
[1:41:48] heads I don't know that song do you you
[1:41:51] know that song I said I've heard them
[1:41:53] sing it but I don't know it I'm glad I
[1:41:57] know
[1:41:59] it aren't you glad you know
[1:42:01] [Applause]
[1:42:19] it you see this is why we're not ashamed
[1:42:22] as brother the Tim dealt with it last
[1:42:24] night of our Pentecostal
[1:42:30] experience ever since I've been in this
[1:42:32] message I've been called a
[1:42:33] Pentecostal and most of the time it's
[1:42:36] never been used in a way to describe me
[1:42:39] in a complimentary
[1:42:44] way but whether they mean it that way or
[1:42:47] not I take it as a
[1:42:50] compliment because to say I'm like Peter
[1:42:53] I'm like John I'm like James I'm like
[1:42:57] Andrew that's a compliment to me brother
[1:43:01] sister
[1:43:03] Hallelujah I take it as a compliment to
[1:43:06] have the same baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:43:09] that fell on the day of Pentecost I
[1:43:12] considered a compliment to be going to
[1:43:15] heaven with the same type of
[1:43:18] [Applause]
[1:43:20] people hallelujah
[1:43:24] as a 12-year-old boy I went to my
[1:43:26] uncle's church and give my heart to God
[1:43:29] they taught me I had to have the Holy
[1:43:30] Ghost I didn't know what the Holy Ghost
[1:43:32] was went down to the to the river it was
[1:43:34] a river then it was a lake but it was
[1:43:35] down in the winter time so the water was
[1:43:37] real low and they broke the ice and
[1:43:40] baptized me in
[1:43:42] titles and then they kept telling me you
[1:43:44] got to have the Holy Ghost while I went
[1:43:46] up to the Altar and I'd pray and pray
[1:43:47] and pray finally one day something hit
[1:43:50] me Hallelujah I spoke in tongues I was
[1:43:53] laid around the Altar and cried and
[1:43:54] spoke in tongue until told I couldn't
[1:43:56] even get up they packed me out my daddy
[1:43:59] picked me up after he had got saved
[1:44:01] finally and picked me up and carried me
[1:44:03] out laid me in the back seat of the car
[1:44:05] carried me home I laid there the we
[1:44:07] hours of the morning still talking in
[1:44:09] tongues was it real brother Donnie it
[1:44:11] was real but I needed something to go a
[1:44:14] little bit deeper you see a baptism can
[1:44:17] be on your spirit but I didn't want it
[1:44:19] just on my spirit but I couldn't get it
[1:44:22] under that message of I'm sitting there
[1:44:25] in my uncle's church I had to hear the
[1:44:27] scream of a mighty Valiant
[1:44:30] Soldier Hallelujah Malachi 4 Luke
[1:44:35] 17:30 Revelation 10 the Palin had to
[1:44:39] come and get me and my Holy Ghost had to
[1:44:43] move into the Seal of my soul
[1:44:50] [Applause]
[1:44:56] so here were 60
[1:44:59] men anybody happened to know the number
[1:45:02] of people when the Tabernacle was set in
[1:45:04] the midst of the congregation of Israel
[1:45:14] 600,000
[1:45:16] 600,000 and here 60
[1:45:19] men personal guards
[1:45:23] of
[1:45:25] Solomon these guys are not mercenaries
[1:45:28] that were hired from money he sent his
[1:45:32] own
[1:45:34] bodyguard after his
[1:45:38] wife you realize how blessed you
[1:45:41] are to set under a Ministry of a man of
[1:45:45] God you realize how blessed you are many
[1:45:47] of you have heard preachers my message
[1:45:50] preacher some of the greatest men I
[1:45:51] believe that's ever lived than any age
[1:45:54] are alive in this day preaching the
[1:45:57] truth oh I know a lot of folks in the
[1:45:59] message don't like them oh that's to
[1:46:00] their own demise the Lord Jesus sent his
[1:46:04] men in this day not to add to this
[1:46:07] message not to take away from this
[1:46:09] message but to bring this message in
[1:46:11] their own gift in their own way that God
[1:46:13] uses them and for what purpose to bring
[1:46:16] you home safely because the Lord knows
[1:46:20] you're going to have many battles you're
[1:46:22] going to have many difficulties and when
[1:46:24] you leave this service today and some of
[1:46:27] you start home today or tomorrow
[1:46:28] whenever it is no telling what awaits
[1:46:31] you down the road but you didn't just
[1:46:33] get enough to help you shout while
[1:46:35] you're here but God wanted to charge
[1:46:37] your battery so when you go home
[1:46:41] whatever you face you'll be more than a
[1:46:44] match for the Devil look out hell here
[1:46:48] we come look out devil here we come look
[1:46:52] out caner look out sickness here we come
[1:46:57] in the name of
[1:46:58] Jesus
[1:47:11] hallu but may I say this the bride
[1:47:15] doesn't just have an Earthly
[1:47:21] guard Psalms 3 47 the angel of the
[1:47:24] Lord encamp us round about them that
[1:47:27] fear Him and Deliver Us
[1:47:32] them Matthew 18:10 take heed that you
[1:47:35] despise not one of these little ones for
[1:47:36] I say unto you that in heaven they
[1:47:41] Angels you have an
[1:47:47] angel I tell my church at home all the
[1:47:49] time I'm so accident prone my angel when
[1:47:52] whenever I stand before the Lord he'll
[1:47:54] wind up getting my
[1:48:01] reward poor guy I've caused him so much
[1:48:03] hardship in life you
[1:48:08] know in heaven their Angels do always
[1:48:11] behold the face of my
[1:48:13] father do you understand you have an
[1:48:16] Angelic
[1:48:18] representation in heaven
[1:48:24] your angel beholds the face of your
[1:48:26] father until you get there oh yeah then
[1:48:30] you can relieve
[1:48:35] him want you to notice the parallel of
[1:48:38] the two camps in heaven and in Earth
[1:48:41] Genesis 32:1 and Jacob went on his way
[1:48:44] and the angels of God met him and when
[1:48:46] Jacob saw them he said this is God's
[1:48:49] host and he called the name of that
[1:48:51] place May
[1:48:53] him May
[1:48:55] anim and it means the place of two
[1:49:01] camps so here were two
[1:49:04] camps it was Jacob's
[1:49:06] camp and the Angelic
[1:49:10] host Satan ain't scared just so much of
[1:49:13] you and
[1:49:14] I but sometimes onever we scream out he
[1:49:18] ain't hearing our voice he's hearing the
[1:49:21] voice of the Lord Jesus
[1:49:23] he may look at you and you say oh I'm
[1:49:25] such a puny outfit but it may be your
[1:49:27] angel that steps out from behind you and
[1:49:30] the devil looks at him and say uhoh uhoh
[1:49:33] I've been in battle with this one before
[1:49:41] uhoh you see the time of the bride's
[1:49:46] passage from this
[1:49:48] Earth to our
[1:49:51] home is going to be compassed with
[1:49:55] Darkness difficult times no doubt some
[1:49:58] of you have went through such hell in
[1:50:01] your life is being a
[1:50:02] Christian and there may be more that
[1:50:04] lays in front of us cuz we know whoever
[1:50:07] he takes from this world in a Rapture
[1:50:09] shows what kind of man he is if our lord
[1:50:13] Jesus Takes just one liar in the
[1:50:17] Rapture it proves he himself is a liar
[1:50:22] if he takes one woman in adultery one
[1:50:25] man that's uh hooked on porn and still
[1:50:28] says he believes the message that proves
[1:50:30] to us what kind of man the Lord Jesus is
[1:50:32] because the kind of woman a man marries
[1:50:34] shows what he is right so what kind of
[1:50:37] people will he take a people that are
[1:50:40] going to be so
[1:50:42] tried a people that's going to stand
[1:50:44] there and they're going to come to such
[1:50:46] test of life oh you know you hear people
[1:50:48] talk about it all the time oh I tell I'm
[1:50:50] just fighting such devils and I'm
[1:50:52] fighting this and that well the devil's
[1:50:53] discouraging me I ain't going back to
[1:50:55] church no more youen that's as far long
[1:50:57] as you've been
[1:50:58] been do you understand the real bride is
[1:51:01] not going to meet just Satan they're
[1:51:04] going to be challenged by God
[1:51:07] himself Jacob did not meet the
[1:51:11] devil he was wrestling with
[1:51:15] God imagine him tell now Lord you better
[1:51:17] back off I'm going to hurt you I'm going
[1:51:19] to hurt you
[1:51:22] I got to be changed God I got to be
[1:51:25] changed let me go let me go I will not
[1:51:29] let you

[1:51:41] alone I don't want to just have a little
[1:51:43] touch I want to be
[1:51:46] changed how many wants to be changed
[1:51:49] [Applause]
[1:52:03] so the bride is placed under the care of
[1:52:06] these Valiant men of whom must give an
[1:52:12] account there's no way you can imagine
[1:52:14] what a man of God grows through to bring
[1:52:17] one sermon to
[1:52:20] you the prophet told us that Jesus Jesus
[1:52:22] will not be beholden to any
[1:52:24] man so when these Servants of God that
[1:52:27] have produced The Bride encouraged her
[1:52:30] helped
[1:52:32] her I've often said if Carol my wife was
[1:52:35] going to the grocery store or somewhere
[1:52:38] out and she wants to have a flat
[1:52:42] tire she wouldn't even know where to
[1:52:44] look for that spare in the car would you
[1:52:49] hone well don't sit there and smile
[1:52:51] sister some of you wouldn't
[1:52:54] either God have mercy the truth is some
[1:52:57] of you men probably
[1:52:59] [Applause]
[1:53:07] would but if a man come along and saw
[1:53:10] her in
[1:53:12] need maybe he was straggly looking maybe
[1:53:15] his hair was all long and beard growed
[1:53:17] out and maybe hadn't took a bath in a
[1:53:18] few
[1:53:19] days but he said ma'am
[1:53:22] you having
[1:53:23] trouble she tried to call me and
[1:53:25] couldn't get me tried to call my
[1:53:27] son-in-laws couldn't get to him she know
[1:53:29] what she's going to
[1:53:30] do but this man said ma'am I I won't
[1:53:34] hurt you I I'm just here to help you if
[1:53:37] I
[1:53:38] can I'll be glad to change that for if
[1:53:40] you want me to she would you
[1:53:43] please so he changes it for puts it back
[1:53:46] in there said man' have a nice day I
[1:53:48] know Carol was left to know she'd say
[1:53:51] what is your name
[1:53:53] cuz I know my
[1:53:56] husband my husband will want to call
[1:53:59] you my husband will want to thank
[1:54:02] you and I
[1:54:04] would can you imagine the Lord Jesus
[1:54:06] when these men servants walk up before
[1:54:09] him can you imagine oh my when the
[1:54:12] Servants of God walk up before him can
[1:54:14] you imagine when that prophet in this
[1:54:16] generation walks up before him and he
[1:54:18] says many snares many difficulties you
[1:54:21] went through all that you did to bring
[1:54:23] this message to my bride and when we
[1:54:26] stand there oh won't it be a Day saints
[1:54:28] of God when we rally around that seventh
[1:54:31] angel messenger won't it be a day when
[1:54:35] you stand behind your pastor when you
[1:54:37] stand behind those men of God and the
[1:54:40] Lord Jesus says thank you thank you men
[1:54:45] of God for praying for preaching for
[1:54:49] studying for bringing my brother
[1:54:52] go safely
[1:54:55] home thank
[1:54:58] you
[1:55:06] hallu may I go on to say can you imagine
[1:55:09] how it's going to be for those around
[1:55:11] this message who say they don't even
[1:55:13] need
[1:55:15] preachers it's going to be a sad
[1:55:18] day that's
[1:55:20] right this is the way God's Prophet
[1:55:22] looked at the ministry God fortified his
[1:55:25] army with
[1:55:27] what
[1:55:29] himself in the
[1:55:31] form of
[1:55:33] prophets
[1:55:35] Apostles
[1:55:37] teachers
[1:55:39] pastors God fortified his army with
[1:55:44] himself in the form of pastors Apostles
[1:55:47] teachers prophets what was God doing
[1:55:50] listen did you ever think of the offices
[1:55:52] in the church it's God's
[1:55:56] dress inside dress an apostle a prophet
[1:56:02] a Seer fore before Satan ever gets to it
[1:56:04] done told it God dressed up in his
[1:56:10] church these offices are God's
[1:56:17] dresswear but Brother Don they're human
[1:56:20] beings of course they are ain't never
[1:56:22] been a preacher on the earth that wasn't
[1:56:24] a human being and every one of them is
[1:56:26] going to make mistakes but that still
[1:56:28] don't mean they're not God's generals
[1:56:30] and God's officers and God call
[1:56:34] [Applause]
[1:56:41] men what A peculiar term that brother R
[1:56:43] says these offices if God's dress wear
[1:56:46] when you see those offices pastors
[1:56:48] teachers evangelists what is that that's
[1:56:51] God's dress El where God's
[1:56:55] presence God's spirit working through
[1:57:00] men you see the
[1:57:03] protocol forbid
[1:57:06] Solomon from touching the
[1:57:09] Earth to where the shulamite
[1:57:14] was he couldn't go to her home to get
[1:57:17] her in other words he had to meet her in
[1:57:20] between her home in his
[1:57:26] home so what he did was he chose his
[1:57:29] personal
[1:57:31] bodyguards now you understand real God
[1:57:33] call men they're not in it for a living
[1:57:36] right I said they're not in it for a
[1:57:38] living they're not in it so they can be
[1:57:41] famous rich or important as a matter of
[1:57:44] fact it's one of the most deadly jobs
[1:57:45] you could have is to be a real gospel
[1:57:47] preacher I've had my life threatened
[1:57:49] many times in different parts of the
[1:57:50] world and even in the United stes it's
[1:57:52] hard to believe and my life has been
[1:57:54] threatened from message people that
[1:57:55] would have absolutely blowed my brains
[1:57:57] out had they could have done it and got
[1:57:59] away with it now that shows how blind
[1:58:01] some of the poor message people are come
[1:58:03] on so I I could have found a whole lot
[1:58:06] safer occupation than being who I am
[1:58:09] couldn't we Brothers we could have found
[1:58:11] one that would have made us maybe a
[1:58:12] whole lot more money but that doesn't
[1:58:14] really matter the king himself summons
[1:58:18] me I wasn't called by preachers I wasn't
[1:58:21] called by no nobody else but the king
[1:58:24] himself called me come on somebody and
[1:58:27] let me tell you something if you're a
[1:58:29] member of the Bride the king himself
[1:58:32] called you to whether you're a preacher
[1:58:35] or not you are bidden to be his
[1:58:39] [Applause]
[1:58:47] wife notice again the prophet said he
[1:58:49] presents his army in the form
[1:58:53] of five offices Apostles prophets
[1:58:56] teachers pastors evangelists that's his
[1:58:59] army that's his soldiers that's his
[1:59:04] commanding
[1:59:07] officers
[1:59:09] wow commanding officers listen what he
[1:59:13] says now they'll be all with the baptism
[1:59:16] of the Holy
[1:59:20] Ghost well praise the Lord
[1:59:23] we don't have a brandom seminary to send
[1:59:25] everybody to come on now none of our
[1:59:28] preachers go to Jeffersonville or
[1:59:30] Johnson City or wherever more and say I
[1:59:32] want to enroll in a message of college I
[1:59:34] want to enroll well we've got some of
[1:59:36] the pulpit that's all they are is
[1:59:37] intellectual Giants that's why they
[1:59:39] fight the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:59:41] fight the real move of God fight all you
[1:59:43] want to you ain't going to kill it it's
[1:59:45] been restored oh it'll burn down I
[1:59:47] guarantee you it'll burn down all the
[1:59:49] fodder it'll burn down all the shucks
[1:59:52] it'll burn down all the trash around it
[1:59:54] but we ain't never going to put out this
[1:59:56] original fire because it's the same fire
[2:00:00] that come off the altar of God the same
[2:00:03] power that raised the Lord Jesus from
[2:00:06] the dead he sent it back he sent it back
[2:00:10] in the form of a
[2:00:12] pacquin and said get in
[2:00:16] darling get in
[2:00:22] what was it that raised Jesus from the
[2:00:24] dead what was it it wasn't a Doctrine a
[2:00:29] Doctrine never died for you a Doctrine
[2:00:32] never hung on the cross a Doctrine never
[2:00:35] raised from the dead a Doctrine is not
[2:00:38] coming for you it was a
[2:00:42] person that's why that person when he
[2:00:45] received the fullness down at the river
[2:00:47] he could say destroy this Temple and in
[2:00:51] three days I will raise it
[2:00:56] up I'm sure you've noticed it before but
[2:00:59] the prophet points at out Force Jesus
[2:01:01] could not say before Calvary all power
[2:01:06] in Heaven and Earth is given unto
[2:01:10] me he could only say it after he raised
[2:01:13] from the
[2:01:15] dead you know of your Bible very well in
[2:01:17] the four gospels you know he was not
[2:01:19] called Lord Jesus Christ and neither

[2:22:31] gnawing on this Lamb's leg for days to
[2:22:34] come what do we doing eating the lamb
[2:22:37] before the
[2:22:43] journey maybe she had a fear of the
[2:22:46] night I've been in Africa and India and
[2:22:48] different parts of the world some of you
[2:22:50] Brothers traveled having the sounds
[2:22:52] there are so
[2:22:53] different I was in Africa several years
[2:22:56] ago at a hunting lodge and the man told
[2:22:58] me said now we've been having a leopard
[2:23:01] that comes around the place
[2:23:04] great bacon for a
[2:23:10] leopard and you know what was sad about
[2:23:12] it was they didn't have no locks on them
[2:23:15] doors and I'm thinking yall sure ain't
[2:23:18] Americans we lock our doors our windows
[2:23:19] and we put on the
[2:23:24] locks wouldn't you know at 3:00 in the
[2:23:26] morning I was woke up with this strange
[2:23:29] peculiar
[2:23:34] sound I grab the covers and pull them up
[2:23:36] by my
[2:23:42] neck so the next morning I told that guy
[2:23:45] I said man I must have heard that
[2:23:46] leopard he said what sound was it making
[2:23:48] I told him he SL said it was an anater
[2:23:51] [Laughter]
[2:23:56] that's the way the devil likes to do us
[2:23:58] he'll come and say I'm going to kill you
[2:24:01] I'm going to give you cancer it's going
[2:24:03] to take your life I'm going to take your
[2:24:05] boy I'm going to take your daughter and
[2:24:07] the Lord says I've got a mighty General
[2:24:10] standing at your door oh Hallelujah it
[2:24:14] ain't nothing but an an eater don't pay
[2:24:17] no attention to it an eaters are totally
[2:24:22] [Applause]
[2:24:34] harmless so this journey was about
[2:24:39] 50
[2:24:40] 50
[2:24:42] miles now remember she didn't they
[2:24:45] didn't charge a Delta jet didn't have
[2:24:48] Amtrak in those days
[2:24:51] but she had all these men around her 50
[2:24:53] miles so at least two if not three night
[2:24:59] stops would have been
[2:25:01] made so the sounds of the night coming
[2:25:06] in when the sun would start to set you
[2:25:10] know how it is at the night it didn't
[2:25:12] amazing your house can make all kinds of
[2:25:13] sounds during the day you hardly pay no
[2:25:15] attention to it but at night time
[2:25:23] especially if you're in somebody else's
[2:25:29] house and I've stayed in some houses
[2:25:31] before you believe whatever you want to
[2:25:32] believe okay but I've seen ghosts
[2:25:35] before now I know you think I'm crazy
[2:25:38] let me tell you you see some man
[2:25:39] standing in your bedroom that ain't
[2:25:40] supposed to be there and he disappears

[2:26:02] to disagree with you but you see I'm
[2:26:05] personal bodyguard to the
[2:26:07] king I've seen how you've smitten him as
[2:26:11] a matter of fact Solomon says one of
[2:26:13] your eyes just one of your eyes has
[2:26:16] captured my heart and he said turn away
[2:26:20] turn away my love I can barely stand
[2:26:23] even look at
[2:26:24] you your beauty has so taken
[2:26:29] me
[2:26:31] Hallelujah you see it's not because of
[2:26:34] who we are it's what he's given us that
[2:26:37] beautifies us that's
[2:26:41] right I saw a picture of a man several
[2:26:44] years
[2:26:46] ago he was up on this church he went to
[2:26:48] a Baptist Church and he he was Up on the
[2:26:50] Roof doing some
[2:26:52] work and he got his tools into the
[2:26:54] electrical wire coming in to that
[2:26:58] church and it caused this tremendous
[2:27:00] fire and once he got into the vaults he
[2:27:02] could not get out so it burned off his
[2:27:05] face and his hands and just terrible
[2:27:09] terrible he was one of the first people
[2:27:11] in America actually to have a face
[2:27:17] transplant he a girl would come to him
[2:27:19] every day he lived he lived but he had
[2:27:22] no
[2:27:24] face and she take him by the hand Daddy
[2:27:27] I love
[2:27:31] you no mouse couldn't
[2:27:34] talk but this man received a face
[2:27:39] transplant of course the first two
[2:27:41] people that he wanted to see was his
[2:27:44] wife and his
[2:27:47] daughter and she comes into the hospital
[2:27:49] room
[2:27:51] take
[2:27:52] your
[2:27:55] daddy my
[2:27:58] daddy you see the Lord Jesus put a face
[2:28:03] on Spirit
[2:28:06] God that's why Paul said we see it in
[2:28:09] the face of Jesus Christ we knew him
[2:28:11] from the Old Testament but we didn't
[2:28:12] have his face we couldn't tell what he
[2:28:14] look like but when brother brandom saw
[2:28:15] him he saw him there and he what do you
[2:28:17] see a face
[2:28:20] right a
[2:28:22] face he come through the fires of
[2:28:25] hell so the face of God could be put on
[2:28:29] so you could look not at a spirit but as
[2:28:32] a human
[2:28:33] being I don't know about you I can't
[2:28:37] wait till I finally get my
[2:28:41] time I've sensed his presence I've heard
[2:28:44] his voice audibly several times but how
[2:28:47] I wait for the
[2:28:49] day and I'll be able to just bow
[2:28:54] down and just sit there oh
[2:28:58] Jesus oh
[2:29:00] Jesus should I touch him or not should
[2:29:03] I I know he want me to said touch me
[2:29:08] Don go
[2:29:10] ahead don't only way I've ever known him
[2:29:12] is a veil between me and him cuz I need
[2:29:15] it but one day that'll be
[2:29:18] taken oh man of God God help me get
[2:29:24] home help

[2:29:40] home let me find a place to
[2:29:43] stop I feel brother Tim's anointing
[2:29:46] getting on me now
[2:29:49] [Applause]
[2:30:01] let me speed up the
[2:30:06] journey so they would have sent
[2:30:08] Messengers to Solomon and they said
[2:30:11] she's just outside the
[2:30:17] city so they would have had incense
[2:30:20] they would have had musicians yes Heaven
[2:30:22] has
[2:30:24] music they would have had singers
[2:30:26] Levites
[2:30:28] coites they would have had all the music
[2:30:31] and all of that and you imagine as she's
[2:30:34] getting
[2:30:37] closer I don't know if I'm ready for
[2:30:39] this I don't
[2:30:44] know you okay my
[2:30:48] lady are you are you okay
[2:30:51] Lord have mercy
[2:30:55] children you realize that Peter and
[2:30:57] James and John and Bartholomew and thus
[2:31:00] and Paul and and and Luther and and all
[2:31:03] the rest of those saints that have gone
[2:31:04] they have not yet seen the Lord Jesus
[2:31:06] face to face they're waiting in the
[2:31:09] sixth Dimension because it would be
[2:31:10] Unbecoming for them to see him in his
[2:31:12] Priestly garments splattered with the
[2:31:15] blood as it
[2:31:17] were so as long as there's one on the
[2:31:19] Earth that needs that Redemption he will
[2:31:22] still be dressed on those high priest
[2:31:24] clothes but you imagine one day he will
[2:31:27] step out and the angels will look at him
[2:31:30] and say today is the
[2:31:36] day how will they know it his chains of
[2:31:42] garments he won't have on a high priest
[2:31:45] garment glory be to God I feel like
[2:31:49] speaking in language now that in
[2:31:51] English
[2:31:53] Hallelujah can you imagine when the
[2:31:55] angels look at him and say today is the
[2:32:00] day the last one come in the last one
[2:32:02] got filled with the Holy Ghost the last
[2:32:03] one's come to maturity I don't know how
[2:32:05] it'll happen it'll be a miracle because
[2:32:06] all over the Earth the bride will be in
[2:32:08] that state however long without a high
[2:32:10] priest maybe 24 hours 12 hours two weeks
[2:32:13] I don't know how long it'll be but he'll
[2:32:14] change his clothes and he'll step out
[2:32:16] from behind the curtain as it was and
[2:32:18] the angels of God will say he's going to
[2:32:20] get
[2:32:23] her he's going to get
[2:32:26] her glory to God he's going get her
[2:32:31] today oh Lord he should the name
[2:32:34] [Applause]
[2:32:43] Jesus and all of the sudden all over the
[2:32:47] Earth
[2:32:55] a great sweep is what the prophet called
[2:32:58] it think of it going beyond the camp
[2:32:59] 1964 think of it missing people and they
[2:33:04] can't find you no more you're getting
[2:33:07] together with the rest of the group and
[2:33:10] you come up missing on the earth
[2:33:14] huah
[2:33:17] wow hallelujah hallelujah you come up
[2:33:21] missing on the
[2:33:23] earth and the devil said where did they
[2:33:26] go yeah where did they go I don't know
[2:33:28] what happened to them what happened to
[2:33:30] them they were LED they were led by men
[2:33:34] of God they were riding the
[2:33:37] Peloquin and
[2:33:39] merged into his
[2:33:43] presence so the singing the music from
[2:33:47] herem Jerusalem
[2:33:50] the incense would have come they would
[2:33:52] have also had incense preceding her here
[2:33:56] she was coming dressed in this Royal
[2:33:59] attire and the incense was fragrancing
[2:34:02] her as she come up into the presence of
[2:34:06] King
[2:34:07] Solomon you imagine whenever the
[2:34:10] preachers come and they
[2:34:12] deliver the precious
[2:34:15] cargo I was looking at this morning
[2:34:17] brother brim said that he valued you
[2:34:21] more than he did his own
[2:34:23] blood because he gave his blood for
[2:34:27] youlu if we had the literal blood of
[2:34:30] Jesus in our hands oh how carefully we
[2:34:31] would handle it I need to handle you
[2:34:33] more carefully than if I had the literal
[2:34:35] blood CU he gave that for
[2:34:40] you I love the word he uses a sweep will
[2:34:43] go over you you see we're used to being
[2:34:47] swept we were swept off our feet by him
[2:34:50] and then Jesus gives us a parable of the
[2:34:52] woman that had the 10 coins remember
[2:34:54] that and she lost one of them coins so
[2:34:56] what did she find out was the way to be
[2:34:58] able to find that coin she swept the
[2:35:00] house so the brides used to been swept
[2:35:03] and cleaned and re cleaned and swept you
[2:35:05] see those of you who don't like to be
[2:35:07] swept if I was you I'd get straightened
[2:35:09] out because that is part of the Rapture
[2:35:11] that's right so one of these days I'm
[2:35:12] going to get my final sweep and it'll go
[2:35:15] all over the Earth who knows where it'll
[2:35:17] start and all of a sudden
[2:35:19] Oh Glory to
[2:35:21] God maybe brother Tim will be sitting
[2:35:23] having his morning
[2:35:24] coffee looking across the table and
[2:35:27] thinking oh
[2:35:29] Karen how much I miss
[2:35:31] you how I love
[2:35:34] you and he'll feel a hand L over on his
[2:35:38] shoulder

[2:35:46] changed you're going to be changed
[2:35:51] children the devil will have all kinds
[2:35:53] of things along the journey to get you
[2:35:56] out of the Peloquin of the baptism of
