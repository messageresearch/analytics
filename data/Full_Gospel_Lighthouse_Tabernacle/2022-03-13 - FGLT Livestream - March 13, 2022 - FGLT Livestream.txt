already told you but if you'll turn with me to first samuel chapter 17 and we're going to catch toward the you know this story way way well and i just want to share a few scriptures with you verse 31. and when the words were heard which david spake they rehearsed them before saul and he sent for them and david said to saul let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight this philistine and david said and saul said to david thou are not able to go against this full listing to go fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man of war from his youth and david said unto saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lion a lamb out of the flock and i went after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me i caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him i want to ask you do you believe this story [Music] thy servant slew both the lion and the bear now notice these next words and this uncircumcisful listing shall be as one of them seeing he hath defiled the armies of the living god and david said moreover the lord that departed me that delivered me out of the the paul of the lion and saw the out of the paul the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this philistine and saul said unto david go these are next words are powerful and the lord be with thee amen maybe you have needs you'd like to share this morning with the lord just by raising your hands before the lord amen let's pray almighty god you're you're the creator of heavens and earth and i ask you now that you would anoint your servant of the lord you see our situation even as i stand here you're greater than every situation that there is i asked you that you would anoint this audience lord may this be the greatest service we've ever been in because we're getting closer to the coming of the lord and we sense your nearness we are very aware of the happenings that are happening around us but they could only happen because we're in this position now we ask you that you would come sweep through this audience lord i remember in in the meetings with brother branham he said come a wind through the audience i heard him just this morning whirlwind coming off of that hill down on that lake that same god's here now i asked you that you would come in a mighty way lord take over our bodies our vessels lord you can heal us standing right here you can heal us sitting in these pews today why cancer's nothing to the hand of god oh god every disease every lost loved one every prodigal that must come home even in the last moments of time lord god and if we are backslidden in our spirit lord as we were challenged last night i ask you for a refilling of the holy ghost oh god hallelujah come on the scene today touch our hearts now we pray in jesus christ's name we ask you amen and amen amen you can be seated amen you guys will help me there amen i want to speak to you on the spark of creation before i do i'm not going to sing i i don't feel i don't feel to do that this morning but i want to read a couple of scriptures or a couple of verses of a psalm the song says hold to god's unchanging hand the verses said time is filled with swift transition naught of earth unmoved can stand build your hopes on things eternal hold to god's unchanging hand the second verse says it like this and trust in him who will not leave you whatsoever years may bring if my earthly friends forsake and steal more closely to him clean chap verse 3 covet not this world's vain riches they so rapidly decay for those of you maybe you have a million dollars in the last weeks 70 000 of that's gone because of inflation inflation just eats the money right out from under you it's just gone it's just going covet not this world's vain riches so that rapidly decay seek to gain heavenly treasures they will never pass away verse four when your journey is completed and if to god you have been true fair and bright the home and glory your rapture soul of you amen hold to god's unchanging hand god's unchanging hand hold to god's unchanging hand god's unchanging hand build your hopes on things eternal hold to god's unchanging hand i'm starting this service a bit strange but this is the way i was told to do it a song has been sung here for decades i'm a soldier in the army of the lord i'm a soldier in the army i'm a soldier in the army of the lord verse one i got my war clothes on in god's army of the lord i got my war clothes on in god's army if i die i'm gonna die in the army of the lord if i die i'm gonna die in the army i got my breasts played on in the army of the lord i got my breasts played on in the army i'm gonna fight until i die in the army of the lord i'm going to fight until i die in the army of the lord i'm a soldier i want to say it for all eternity i'm a soldier let it be said you can put it on my gravestone i'm a soldier in the army of the [Applause] lord i get joy when i think about what he's done for me i get joy when i think about what he's done for me today i'm speaking this for you and i don't know how long i'll be if i go over time i'll pay you overtime but this is a result of about two months ago i got a visitation from the angel of the lord and i'm just not going to hold back anymore i don't know i don't know how much time i'm just not going to hold back any more on some of these things some of these things i've held very close to my chest but i feel today to share some things well brother ron i don't believe it well you just go to hell with what your unbelief so i feel very instructed and just for just for beginners in the study when i was studying yesterday i became a very much aware of a special presence that was standing in the room beside of me there's always results from that presence one of the results was brother jason jackson who was a friend of this church had sent me a text just a bit earlier and god just spoke something to me and i just in a couple of lines wrote a text to him and it was absolutely what he needed for what he's went through this last week i don't know and don't feel to share those things but i would say this to you god knows even on the internet that are watching today god knows your needs so because of that visitation i i want to speak some things the other day i was i was blessed with the company that came to our house of course i don't share any of what i'm going to speak and and so brother jason and sister megan brother tom hill brother terry and all of those that was with him he felt to create a gift for me and i have to say this to you this is one of the greatest gifts i've ever got brother jason is a as a new taxidermist and for those that don't know let me just preface this brother jason and sister megan would you just stand just for a moment there i want the world to see you guys just as a reminder and this may be some of these things may be redundant today but just as a reminder jason had decided he didn't like preachers and he didn't want to be in church he wanted nothing to do with it and then true and you know that sister megan for those that was around jason jason was a he was a difficult individual to be around and i'm just going to say that very lightly you can be seen brother ray sister sue i'd asked them to put some heating and air units in my house and he actually asked me said it'd be all right if i bring jason i think we were going to fly to edmonton that day i think we were flying to edmonton if my if i'm right and and so i just but i had just a short time and when they came and they started i went around and stood with them as they started and i asked jason i said would you like to walk through my house i'd like to show you what i'm doing i'd like to tell you what i'm doing and so i took i took jason through the house now remember this is a guy who don't like me and so i walked him through the house and i just began to talk to him about my mission of life my mission of life what i want from my home what i want for this church what i want for my family what this message has meant to me i i didn't pressure him whatsoever in any way but i'll tell you what it did to me changed his life and i'd say every person in this building could say amen amen for this we prayed for for this we prayed for and so maybe we could slip this just a bit closer i'll let you guys do that so we're just going to say maybe a couple months ago six weeks eight eight weeks it just came to me i want to do this for brother ron and so we asked brother terry terry over here to build this cabinet for those of you that don't know terry i'd like for you to spend a little time with terry terry was an orphan child and terry was the one that i asked to come and build my house for me you know how many you don't know how many supernatural days that we had terry klein is the top of my list he's an awesome human being and he built this cabinet and he's they begin to with the idea that we need to we need to have a representation of what this this is the creative word manifested sister megan i think you did this part first of all i think that's phenomenal but you took it from a very interesting place and i thought i thought that was phenomenal brother branham is telling perry greene and sydney jackson at the end of it perry is not sure if he believes a story or not isn't that right and and i wanted to just share these words pray green thought in his heart i'm either listening to a prophet of the god this either happened just as he's telling it or this man is deceiving me and yet he could think of no reason why brother branham would deceive him and he said just in that moment brother branham said brother perry it really happened now you see i'm not going to go through this but brother branham was hunting the year before he killed 34 squirrels and brother branham would only shoot him in the eye for those that know no brother branham he called himself a nervous little little rat at times because he was so he was so nervous and he wanted to shoot him perfectly he was an absolute marksman and so he would want to shoot him in the eye so he didn't destroy any of the meat and he's hunting in a place and he's hunting and there's no squirrel there's just no squirrel and the angel of god that stands on the platform that has met him so many times is now taking him into another realm now this is just not about squirrel it's not just about a 42-inch caribou or a silver-tipped grizzly bear but god is asking him and even challenges his faith and brother branham uses this term and i accepted his challenge and he began to speak hunted all day and he began to speak three squirrels and so what we have here brother tom climbed into tops of trees and i've got pictures and osha would not approve and these are limbs sycamore and locusts also you may not be able to see and maybe we just let everybody see later uh it has corn in here because brother brandon was hunting very near a cornfield but brother brown asked for three squirrels charlie cox was one of the individuals that was there and and brother brown tells charlie the story actually in one place they have to go and hunt hunt down that squirrel and they found it because it would had climbed in a certain spot and they asked charlie said what did you do with the squirrels he said we ate them charlie made an interesting statement he said those squirrels didn't have navels believe better not but they were created squirrels now i'm going to challenge you because you're getting ready to step into a rapture when we think of third pull or we think of a rapturing faith we think of these things god has a plan for you to change your body not just make you young again but make you new when you were at your best brother bam said and that was before the foundation of the world he took a picture of you before the foundation of the world and and brother jason was telling me of his inspiration to to do these squirrels and he said i i write on the inside of the animal i i write i write something whether it's a deer or whether it's whatever i just go right through these devil you don't have enough we will see a complete healing [Music] [Applause] trust in me i'll use you like never before and he has now i i want to share this and i want to leave this here if you get bored you can look at it but when i turned to brother jason in the house i asked him i said what caught what caused you to do this he said it just came to me and i thought the devil didn't come to him the sure one thing for sure the devil didn't tell him to do this for me three years ago he would have never gave a thought about doing this for me and may i say that at no cost at no cost these guys have been working and they wanted to be a part of this let me just say this to your testimony around the world god's still in the business with the spark of creation in our lives and i stood there i i just thought you know when i hear a sermon when i hear a sermon i want to i want to catch what caused that spark of inspiration because that spark of inspiration is eternal are you with me a lot of scriptures a lot of quotes a lot of thoughts a lot of feeler but what caused the sermon if it came from god it's a spark of eternal life what made michelangelo create moses there was a spark there was a vision and something sent him on a road of 44 years to work on that what caused him to paint some of the most beautiful pictures in the world all inspiration all gifts come from god it just is where they're inspired from men are inspired from a lot of different directions but when it's for god whether you realize it or not that's a part of eternal life i hear brother branham he'd say i was up at the house and i was so wore out from my travels and and i thought of this little church down here i thought of people you know they're having service down there i think i'll go i i think i'll go to church and i came to service to see now you know i'm paraphrasing i came to service this evening and this morning and i i i thought i i thought brother neville would be speaking and he asked me to speak so so maybe i'll i'll just i'll just pull a scripture and just start speaking to you a little while and then he would preach a sermon called and knoweth it one of the greatest sermons ever been amen you see it's that spark that spark that's got life in it i'm trying to hold myself together here a minute i want to share a quote with you i read this i sent my family this morning and when the son of god rises with healing in his wings it'll be totally impossible to hold those bodies in the ground any longer they'll come forth in the brightness of the son of god very nature we're getting ready to go into spring it don't look like it much around here but we're in spring the very nature itself testifies of that david was standing there before israel a backslidden king brothers that were quick to intimidate him for being daddy's little boy an anointed servant of the lord not anointed by man or not anointed deathly by his brothers not even by his father who had forgotten him when the prophet came but you see he had had fellowship with god brother branham said that's how god learns to trust you it's when he's had fellowship with you david begins to begins to give testimony and in the testimony you see brother branham would tell stories those stories would remind people of how great god is it would remind them that they would have faith for their condition sitting there where they are that was just not for the temporary audience but that's been for audiences around the world even today we can rehearse the stories like this david stands there before that king that king sees him as a little boy that king sees him as a ruddy fella no way does he see him as a warrior or a champion and and david is standing there and he begins to rehearse doesn't rehearse abraham's story and he doesn't rehearse moses's story he doesn't rehearse the other prophet story he rehearses his story i hear men that want to be critical of what i'm getting ready to do today i want you to understand i can rehearse these stories and not have to embellish them because i was there and i was an eyewitness of it remember when david walks off of the hill the stones that he pick up near the brook those stones have been used before because there was a war that was happening and angels of god rained down stones upon the heads of the enemy and destroyed thousands upon thousands of warriors now david a ready little boy with a testimony that said this uncircumcised philistine i want you to just think if nobody accepts the challenge israel is going to be under philistine rule and they're going to become slaves and men are going to die family structures are going to change and goliath could stand there and scream as long as nobody accepted the challenge we've come to rapture hour and we've accepted the challenge of believing this message with all of our hearts we're not a bunch of school children here we're men and women of god that have seen the very creativity of what god changed our lives these are more than stories this is reality david picks up a stone we know the story that goliath swared him and made fun of him that's what the devil will do to you he'll swear at you and make fun of you knowing he's getting ready to die david began to whirl a rock in a in a rope some time ago you know this story but some time ago brother tom hill back here he began to ask me i want to build a rifle for you i want to put brother branno's picture on it i i want to have some wonderful sayings for you and he said i want to do that for you and honestly i looked up to see how much it would be i didn't want you spending that kind of money but he wanted to do it he said i want to do it for him he came to me over and over again i want to do this for you what do you want on it and i would never tell him one night he walked in just the very night that we were going to announce to this audience that i had cancer god chose that very night for brother tom to walk through the back and have david slink today it's worth more than any rifle to me it's more than any rifle that you could have made brother tom or any pictures or any saiyans on it but it it means something and as i was preparing this sermon over the last while i thought about the inspiration what put it in his heart god in his time and god in his knowledge knows exactly what to do how to do it every situation another man would make this statement he says now the crucial moment has come now the time has come where i have either told the truth or it's a falsehood and the reason that i know that it's the truth god's word said it's the truth and that just settles it i do not doubt one word he said i may not i may not have faith to bring to pass the promises that he made but i would never stand in somebody else's way who could if i couldn't walk like enoch of old take a walk in the afternoon and go home with god i i would be happy to know that somebody else had faith enough to do it the great physician who was here who who said these signs shall follow them that believe if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover and if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but can believe if he can create squirrels it was already in the sermon brother jason if he can create squirrels who has no way at all or nothing there to believe it it's my own faith that goes in dust that my faith in what he has challenged me to ask he asked me he challenged me to ask it and i received his challenge in obedience to the word i asked it and it appeared god in heaven knows that's the truth can he also heal the sick if he can lift me with faith up this way even for the people even if they can't climb to that bracket even if they can't do it he can use my faith and he can lift me up to that place and i'm climbing for you i'm believing for you i'm speaking for you it was about 12 years ago that brother biscuit was sitting at his desk i was laying in a hospital in a sedated coma where you work brother nathanael and they had sedated me because i was burned my lungs were burned my face was burned my arms were burned and coincidentally because of the cancer and the medicine i'm becoming ghost white and you can even now see you can now see where they put my arms the skin off my arms the skin from my legs to my arms and you can see the stitches come here just a moment can you see that yeah yeah yeah come stand it's not a hard thing to do can you see that yeah could you point out it just just there for me amen amen amen thank you you see i couldn't see that for about 12 years but now because of cancer stupid devil he exposes what god did 12 years ago brother biscuit was sitting at his desk and something moves him i went back and listened to it three times to make sure i get some of these things right he said in my human thinking i was thinking sister connie will never answer the phone he didn't know that matthew was in one hospital and i was in another hospital and he tells sister connie he calls and he said while i was dialing he said i was thinking she'll never answer she's not going to be near the phone but he said something was telling me to call the phone and call sister connie and he said i only number he had was our home phone at that time and he called and connie answered the phone and he's and he uses this word connie i like the way he says it connie where are you i'm between hospitals ron's in uva and matthew that pulled me out of the fire was an rmh and begin to talk about the situation he said it is my understanding that the last to go is the hearing and he said so i would like for you to whisper in brother ron's ear that we have purchased mount baker bible way camp and god has told me that brother ron is going to be the speaker next year i'm putting the devil on notice today i'm tired of playing with his critical nonsense he's either god or he's not god hallelujah to god be the glory now i want you to just think about this here's a seasoned minister one of the greatest that's ever preached that has went around the world over and over and over again preaching that this message has fulfilled malachi 4 5 and 6 in revelations 10 7 and has preached the message of the hour and god speaks to him that i'm going to be the speaker not just to tend but i'm going to be the speaker at next year's bible way camp if you could think about the incredible odds of that happening how satan stacks odds against you and i i'm here to tell you and history bears it out that that next year my whole family went with me to be at that camp even my mother and my father they celebrated my daddy's birthday there and i i spoke in that meeting till about 11 1200 people and god supernaturally changed lives all over the building i was telling this story at a meeting at a convention there was a man setting he was sitting about right where you are brother jim and he was saying that i could tell it was just bawling it was in my notes so i told it and so i went to the office and this man charged into the office i thought of the audacity that this man did he just charges into the office he was a preacher he charges into the office and begins to contest the story that i just shared with you and i said you can't contest that it happened and then it begins to contest and go with that believe the sign nonsense and he begins to tell me that all of the questions about brother branham and all of these things about the finnish boy and about the bridge and all of their nonsense and about the cloud i said it happened just like the prophet said [Applause] listen he's either of the truth or it's a lie [Applause] well he told it different in different places in different places there were certain pieces that needed to be told [Music] i i said a lot of things to that man not beneficial to be spoke here i charged him that he would have to face god with his lies every one of those that have come against the message of the hour you didn't come against william brown ed bischo ron spencer donnie reagan tim pruitt you came against god [Applause] oh i hope they come back god will have to override his word to bring him back speak plain for a bit after the man was done he saw that he wasn't going to get nowhere with me he turned to walk out and i said just a moment i'm going to walk out with you i said you see there's two doors that we're going to walk out of and we walk out of this door and then we're going to walk out of that door and there's going to be a line of preachers standing there and there's a a professional photographer is going to take our picture and he just kind of whirled like this said how do you know that and i said same way i know this is true we walked out of that door and we walked out of another door and there was about 10 preachers standing there and it was a photographer with a huge huge camera in his and i said hey you stand beside me you see we know where we stand we know where we stand at let me just say we're worthy of rapture we either know where we stand or where we're not standing and this altar is open if you don't know that you know that you know that you know that there's nothing here in this world can hold you here nothing nothing can hold me hallelujah we're getting ready to go to louisiana louisiana's been a special place for me i got a probably my closest friend his brother tim pruitt got many close friends communicate with brother tim every day brother donnie's real close to that we're not here comparing any of that and i'm not trying to cause any feelings anywhere but you'll know who you are by your friends some of that closeness has been because of the miracles that have happened we were in a prayer line in one of the meetings and as i as i'm in the prayer land i turned to brother timothy and i said timothy where's your sister i i just saw a vision of drew that couldn't walk i just saw a vision of drew walking well bethany was just in line just a few more people you guys know her well we all know the story well and so bethany comes through the line and she's got a blanket because the baby that that uh lydia had just gave birth to had uh jaundice and they and so she was bringing the baby she was bringing the brave blanket through the prayer line and i asked her i said where's drew and she said he's in bed asleep i said i've just had a vision of drew walking she left the blanket we prayed for the blanket and they took the blanket and the baby was healed they brought drew and drew comes and we pray for him and you know the story it's almost a year later nothing happens he's still crawling he's still pulling himself across the floor and sister and sister uh karen has suffered a brain bleed and she's feeling sorry for herself and she's she's going through all the emotions of that brain bleed and and all of those things god's greater than brain bleeds and so as as she was sitting there she began to worship the lord and the spirit of the lord came down and touched sister karen and at the same time little drew ran all across that room ran all through the house that's our god [Applause] brother gabriel has a special relationship with drew and drew they they talk every week and drew and gabriel have a special relationship and let me just say gabriel's testimony is as supernatural as drew's testimony and i want to just link that back just a few years ago your life was in shambles it was tore all apart but god who is rich in mercy and on the day before i had brain surgery where they removed a tumor that big brother wayne lawson that preached here last week last week last week and and i i went blind in one side of my eyes on both eyes and i went to the doctor and they sent me to the hospital and they i stayed all day all day in hospital all evening in the hospital and they ran an mri on me about 10 30 at night and brother nathaniel sister sue came and my boys came and there was a little little doctor that didn't know and he walks in he says you have three three brain tumors you know that just knocked the very props out from under me and i would spend the rest of that week and them trying to shrink those tumors to where they could operate it on it and dr vastigari vista gary investigary he operated he he pulled it out he said it was just like a volcano it just exploded in my brain those doctors those doctors are very fine doctors i actually see some this week and they told me that i had about four months to live i'd like to say it's been a long four months but gable it would be worth it if you was the only thing that came out of it you couldn't put your life together you're doing everything you could you was looking for everything but you knew you knew you needed him and we were in the room there was about 30 people there and we were in the room and all of a sudden that room emptied except for you and i knew that if that room emptied and you were the only one standing there there was a reason and in the next 10 minutes gabriel went from old man to new man sarah you didn't want the old one but you can enjoy the new one the rest of your life because it's him mariah was at the louisiana camp that her hair was gone and i don't see sam but we're working he's working maybe you could have him and his girlfriend to watch this mariah had alcopecia and her hair was going and she came into that prayer line with three bobby pins and it's it's on the internet you can watch it three bobby pins she walks that that print three bobby pins and she said i believe i'll use these again alkopitia is not a disease that turns around it's not natural it doesn't turn around no more than i can tell brother steve steve i need you to grow hair and i'm using that for a reason because in a few days you'll have a head full i don't believe that brother ron you stay around then the rapture happens you look over steve say i remember a service brother ron said you're going to have a hair full sister mariah now has a complete hair head full of hair and it's beautiful because whenever god does something he does it really well he has his own laboratory filled we were sitting in the back of the building and andrew and katie couldn't have children and we were setting and michael dexter was there and i said andrew i i see now why we're just past the prayer line we're just finished with that i see now why katie can't have children it's her womb so the next time at home when i feel the angel of the lord come i want you to come down to the altar and we're going to pray for you and so i called him i think he was working upstairs and so you came and we prayed you were standing right here and we prayed and i prayed based on what the angel of the lord told me in louisiana six weeks later you go to the you go to the doctor and you're six weeks pregnant now her two girls if they'll stand if one of them both of them are awake there you go allie would you stand allium would you stand on the seat so that they can capture that amen she's her father in female form [Applause] those who know know you see if you just saw these things a couple by chance or have we got time for a little bit more now now this don't just happen to me sister joanne and brother tom ray were desiring children and they could not have them they absolutely could not have them it was totally impossible for them to have them and and i don't know the whole story and i've heard it before but for for brain fog or whatever they get a prayer cloth from sydney jackson and they begin to wear that prayer cloth they make that known they get prayer by brother biscuit they have brother biscuit to pray for them that they'd have a child and their first child they named him sam sam's a prince of a man and i'm talking about prince just for notes this message is filled with princes and princesses that are the very example of the embodiment of jesus christ living in human flesh and their children and their children's children because this message works don't bring me your excuses don't bring me your nonsense this message works and it's a supernatural message [Applause] they had a boy named michael and michael is one of the sharpest individuals i've ever met i mean his brain is he must be brains from his waist up because he don't have much waste some people when they get in the rapture they're already going to have perfect bodies and he happens to be one of those michael works in the office of the church he works there and i'm preaching the convention i tell his daddy i said tom god's calling michael into the ministry no yeah he's ran from it we had conversations i said i'm just telling you what god god's told me in a prayer line i was getting very weak and i turned i i believe it was john andes brother tim dodd brother murphy wong was standing there brother tom they were helping me and others were helping and i said where's michael ray he's in the back of the building i said go get him god's calling him into the ministry now let me just tell you there's a there's a great difference between zeal and calling and a lot of people are called by their mother their father their sister their brother or relatives and just because you've got zeal don't mean you're called and it causes men to shipwreck a lot of times young men when they come to god and they begin to become real dedicated servants of the lord because of their zeal others will say you're a preacher you know that'll sound flattering for a bit well you're a preacher generally preachers will catch whether you're a preacher or not is that a you would rather me tell you no you're not called yeah amen because any god called man is gonna run from it so michael comes up in the up in the prayer line you know there's just god just does things right in front of the whole world he don't do it in the corner he does it in front of the whole world you couldn't orchestrate it any different and and i begin and i hear the spirit of god speaking through tongues through me and then telling him that he's called to preach this gospel to carry this word you know what his words were no and he's screaming no with all of his heart kind of like moses standing before a bush kind of like brother branham explaining himself in a cave i can't go you know sometimes god just knows how to do it and now you can listen to michael ray as he preaches across the pulpit there in canada and you can see no man called him ron spitzer didn't call him but god ignited that gift on the inside of him brother tom i'm sorry i'm using your family here for a bit but he had a son named joel and sister joanne goes to brother biscuit just before i come for a convention and she's desperate seth she's desperate this boy is living in another place this boy is doing his own thing this boy thinks he's got the world by the tail so we go away for a couple of days and so we're staying at an apartment and i'm sitting with whitney whitney and we're watching planes land on water that don't happen in augusta county and so i'm i'm sitting watching those planes land on water it was a neat deal i mean it was just neat planes ran on water around here they fell on a lake probably the plane's going to be bigger than the lake and so we're watching that whitney i've got my i've got my feet up on the rail i preached the meeting i'm wore out i'm just sitting there and something speaks to me it says go to the door you've got a visitor well i get up i go to the door i'm not wanting to be bothered by nobody i'm honest with you and so i opened the door there's nobody standing there and so i i step out the door brother shannon you know you got a phone call from me and i step out of the door and here comes joel and i'm thinking he's got them curls you know he's he's a handsome dude i mean he's the dude i mean he he looks the part he's got them curls and they're just a bouncing he's got faded blue jeans on a t-shirt he's got sandals on and he's just prancing down there i said joe he said yeah i just want to come over see you guys i said won't you come in sit on the porch with me i'd love to we sat and we watched we watched you know the things going on and joel's sitting right beside of me and i just start talking to him he got quiet and the lord just read his life just read his life amen and i told him i said you are born and you have a sign of prosperity on you you're like joseph and you're going to be blessed in everything you do i think you got it too really do and you're going to be blessed in everything you do but you're wasting your life and he said god just read his whole life but just a couple of days before that meeting joanne goes to her daddy on the street and she says i'm praying for joel i'm praying for him he was born we couldn't have him and now the devil's trying to steal him away and here we are sitting on a porch and her prayers are being answered i don't have time to tell you how much god has blessed that boy's life in the construction field where you build hundreds of millions of dollar apartments and you're the head constructor over it all and and they move him all over the place why god came and the spark of creation literally changed that that human's life are you with me now are you with me what about your life what about a god rich in mercy for a joe shifflet that has been invited to a meeting and god unctions brother homer to go out and stand on the porch if he don't see you there he won't come in and one of the pillars of this church that cancer cannot defeat when he comes across those railroad tracks there stands a white-headed man standing on the porch waiting on him it's just okay that's okay you've met them so it's no need in me telling you but melody and kelvin brother kelly hildebrandt's daughter who had lost her husband had two boys and they're they're young strong boys i'm just going to tell the whole story she was in a church that was kind of a little bit distanced from the message or using the message and had her own thing going and she was making the decision do i stay here or do i they'll go to my daddy's church she never heard her daddy preach kelly hildebrant one of my best friends she never heard him preach first of all i think that's just stinking rotten amen of any preacher that would prohibit that i let me just tell you where i was at when i got this call i was sitting in the tenth floor of the ramada inn and i was looking at the bridge that people want to contest say it didn't happen so i'm looking at that bridge studying for tonight that night service and brother kelly calls me and we're in a conversation for about 45 minutes and i had it on speaker phone and sister connie was sitting on the bed listening to the conversation and at the end of it i said brother kelly i said when she does what she's going to do and she comes back to your church i'm sitting looking at the bridge that is so contested and i'm going to tell you something in the name of the lord god's going to give her a prince of a man i call kelly in about three weeks brother kelly in about three weeks and i said how's things going he said you won't believe how things are going rama it's happening so fast he said i just can't believe how things are going he said melody's engaged not just talking to somebody she's engaged brother ronnie's a prince of the man he's from manitoba i reminded him i was looking at the bridge and i said we talked about these things are you getting the point here god just amends his word he just says okay i'll prove this by this and i'll prove this by this and i'll prove this by this it happened i'll prove this by this it's kind of like brother biscuit with that finish boy that dead boy he he was preaching a meeting and he came into contact with a sister and that sister's husband was the driver of the car that killed the boy and then brother guido comes here and brother guido stands here and he says well it happened he said i've been there where it happened and he said what what people don't know is after after the boy was raised back to life brother branham goes to the next campaign he goes to the next meeting i i personally think it's a phenomenal thing i actually listened to it this morning of that boy being raised back to life brother branham let me just point this he said if this boy isn't off of the ground in five minutes he said call me a false prophet then he said you could line up every devil in hell and you couldn't stop it from happening so satan you're listening to the service you know it's the truth brother guido's children are watching this guy just spoke with them earlier this morning they're watching the service and so they know this is the truth brother gato comes and tells this and here at this audience and he said brother branham goes to the next place and he said there were 12 rows of wheelchairs and cots and he said when brother branham walks through the door he doesn't even get to the pulpit but everybody was off of their wheelchairs and off of their cots satan you couldn't hold that boy down then you couldn't hold that audience down i want to say this to you he can't hold us down hello brother doug hill comes here was brought back to life how many know that's the truth a little boy that's asleep on me right now i saw him three years before he was ever born to my daughter that couldn't have children and my son-in-law that was crushed but you can't stop what god's got on his plan and then god gave them another child and that child's name's zoe i call her shake and bake adena will you stand on your on your seat just now adanaya she asleep yeah she's on her way they had a conversation her and their dad had a conversation they had a conversation make sure i get this right sister sue called me and told me they had a conversation they were at having dinner and he was away from the table and she ordered a a diet pep a diet drink and and brother jonathan came back to the table and said uh is that is that a you order a soda pop two two things mean the same same thing two different kind of things mean the same thing she said that's kind of like jesus and god they're the same god's going to rapture little girls like adonia hallelujah satan whispered in my ear about your situation this morning whispered in my ear how long and i just whispered back to him she's already got a child in heaven isn't that right you lost one that god don't lose nothing and so standing there waiting on you so go tell the devil it's not about time and god's got everything a god that can take care of squirrels i walked through my office the other day and these words were spoke to me are you doubting the vision they're pretty sobering i'd be very honest with you are you doubting the vision and immediately my mind went back to bud software brother bischoff in a green checkered shirt i've never seen horns like that we don't have those kind of animals that color we don't have that kind of color here and then they're standing on that hill looking across glassing the animal and there it lays there it's laying in the sunshine and he said there he is one thing for there he is another thing to get him brother ma'am said him brother bud says you can't go across that shell rock it'll start sliding and brother brown turns around the button he said well that's the way the angel told me to go he said i'm going with you when they're looking at the animal you know there they are and brother biscuit wasn't aware that he was in division he was wearing a green checkered shirt and the tape measures pulled out and blaine had just showed up brother bud's son had just showed up and his hand went down on that on that tape and held it just exactly that young hand went down on that tape and brother biscuit has made this statement for years he made it to me he made it to others he said had it been 42 and a quarter i'd have doubted it had it been 39 and three quarters i would have doubted it he said but when it landed it landed exactly on 42 inches i just want to say this to you it's still 42 inches anybody that's killed animals and knows that there's horn shrinkage from green to dry it it's a lot of people shoot an animal and it shrinks from the time they get out of the stand so the time they go down there to get it you know that's a truth but let me just say when god does something he does it right and then they're walking off of the hill and i'm just about done and they're walking off of the hill and brother branham turns to bud and they're talking about before we get back to camp we've got to kill that silver tipped grizzly bear first of all bud has never seen a silver tipped grizzly bear never seen one and he said i can see for miles brother branham and brother budd's brother had an epileptic condition and brother branham prayed for him and god healed him and so he's got that faith as an anchor and and and brother branham just said he said i can see from miles and there's no bear and brother brandon i'm asking a question are you doubting division no no sometimes god challenges us i remember standing with brother tim pruitt and he's laying his hands on bethany she's about to have brooke and they've said that brooke is going to be born deformed you know this she's going to be deformed and she's going to have itty-bitty legs and brother tim pruitt says that he has saw in a dream that she was perfectly well and we're standing in a prayer line and i turned to brother tim and i said according to your dream i said bethany lay your hands on your belly that baby's going to be perfect and little brook is just a beautiful baby and she's just all over the place 100 exactly right are you with me the other day we walked around this building with our little buddy right there that couldn't walk i want to ask you audience are you doubting the vision some way that there's going to be a rapture for me and you god turned abraham and sarah back young again he put enoch and he not begin to walk and he walked right into a rapture elijah stepped on a chariot and stepped across [Music] i don't care what the devil whispers in your ear our eyes are going to see these things because more than a caribou more than a bear more than squirrels the inspiration that touched him to create that the inspiration touched you to get me david slang the inspiration that's got you here this morning when no doubt the devil give you every reason in the world to stay at home and you're still here i opened the door last week and i said i'm going to pray for donny and i open the door and donny's walking up the steps i said come i want to pray for you brother donny had been suffering for weeks even months and this week they found that he had he had an infection and he gave him antibiotics and he's a new man today [Applause] that's god that's god i was sitting at zeros and i was sitting beside you brother denny and sister sean and i turned to you and i said i see zach in a suit and you and him an altar and you thought it never happened and you were hoping it didn't happen but god wanted to do more than put you in a suit zach you want to change your life and for you to be a good husband to her first of all he had to change you and for him to be a good husband to you he had to change him and now he wants to do the same thing to you jason i have every one of your letters from prison everyone and everyone i prayed over them when i walked out this morning and saw you sitting on that back row you've been here a while now and maybe for others they don't know and they don't need to know god's not interested in your history he's got a blood to take care of that he's not interested in what you were he knows what you're going to be and he all he does is just take us a little spark of creativity and in just a moment he changes your life minnie's going to louisiana camp in a few days what about 25 maybe about 25 is going to go to camp but that same god that will be there is here right now he's here right now and

it's either the truth or it's not it's either the truth or it's not i heard a statement this week from the woman in purple and she said something very prophetic she said america this is what you voted for this is what you voted for and i'm reminded of a prophet's words this is what america wants but i'm going to be very honest with you i'm ready to go home when i think about those saints i just got a picture of ukraine and we're helping through brother berry coffee we're helping with some of those saints that that are having difficulty with bread and water they're not buying cars they're not buying homes their homes are being destroyed but not one believer has been killed of all of that and they love this message as much as you and i do they love it they're wanting a rapture as much as we are and out of the flux of it all ukraine is invaded and destroyed and they'll level that place if they're not careful they literally level it they're destroying it and it drove jews back home don't
