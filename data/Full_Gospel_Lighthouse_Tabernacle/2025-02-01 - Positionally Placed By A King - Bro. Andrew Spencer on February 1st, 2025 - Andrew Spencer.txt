I was just I just sitting back there just relishing in the in that verse where I speak Jesus for my family and and you don't realize how great this message truly is when you start looking at the whole of it like you just you just look at the um you just look at it it's it's like a like a legend and you see that you see the royalty of the body of Jesus Christ that this isn't just a a hand me- down religion but it is a people that have caught an experience of the same God and and I I remember um sister ranna's mama she was uh she is one of the first ones that uh the Lord dealt with when I and I

Lord God bless you Hallelujah if you have your Bibles this evening we'd like to look over in the Book of Revelations Revelations chapter one then we' like to go back to the Old Testament into 1st Samuel chapter 16 I'll try to talk louder for you brother AR we thankful to have brother met us here in the house Lord amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord he's always telling me ain't no way God can be as good to you as he's been to me so the Lord's been real good brother met us and we we so appreciate him amen amen how many has a need on their heart tonight that she'd just like to make known to the Lord amen Our God sees each and every one of our hands here tonight father we come before you tonight Lord we are a a grateful people Lord Jesus for all that you have done for us in this generation Lord God we could stand here and exercise our Authority and express and witness of the wonderwork power of Jesus Christ for for countless days Lord Jesus of how good that you've been to us and father we just have gathered here one more time Lord with needs on our lives and we've come here Lord Jesus to allow the word of God to wash over our lives and Minister unto us and to bless us for truly Lord Jesus we're your children and we we've come to your house father to hear from you we pray father that you would come in a very uh uh very Supernatural way Lord very subtle Lord that we would know that it was the the author of the book that was beginning to just allow The Winds of the Holy Ghost to blow through the building father now you see these hands that are lifted up you see these needs that have been presented unto you we ask father that thou would us come and have thine own way here tonight in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Revelations chapter 1 and verse 6 and hath made us Kings and priest unto God and his and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen 1st Samuel chapter 16 and verse one and while you're turning there I'm just going to read reread that verse in Revelation again and he hath made us Kings and priest unto God and his father to be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen 1 Samuel chapter 16 and verse one and the Lord said unto Samuel how long will thou mourn for Saul seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel feel thine horn with oil and go and I will send thee to Jesse the bethlehemite for I have provided me a king amongst his son we realize he's still Jehovah Gyra that he can take anything and make something out of it verse 12 and he sent and brought him in now he was Ruddy when you look at that word Ruddy I really like that word he was redheaded he was Ruddy and with all I used to be redheaded that's why I like that word and and my wife's done turn me a little bit gray-headed but praise God anyhow and with all of a beautiful countenance now that ain't got nothing to do with me right there and goodly look to look to and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is he then Sam took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David and from that day forward so Samuel rose up and went to Rama now notice notice these these two verses together you can't you can't separate them but the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him now you might look at it and you might see a timeline and you could see where the spirit of the Lord was taken away from Saul but you cannot take away these two these two moments that you're looking at here in history that when David is Anointed to be king that the spirit of the Lord departs from Saul and an evil spirit begins to trouble the Lord the reason why that that Saul was set up so that an evil spirit could come and trouble him was because he had rejected the headship of the word all right we'll let you be seated here tonight in the in the presence of the Lord I'd like to take a thought uh from this from this quote that I'm getting ready to read to you that brother Brandon would preach a series on on the great warrior and he would preach on the great warrior David and he would preach on the great warrior Joshua and I was just I was just going through this it's a real short real short service that brother brandham takes there and then you can hear it on the backside brother brandham goes into a into a healing meeting but brother brandom says some very profound things in 19 55 here he said now now notice David was called by election he was elected called and anointed and placed and by the help of the Lord I'd like to take these these four words as a subject tonight and I'd like to preach to you on a on a on a thought on positionally placed as a King David was was elected called anointed and placed elected by God called from the Sheep hering to be king anointed and positionally placed he said look Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph Abraham election Isaac justification and Jacob Grace and Joseph Perfection he said all right there you are called you are he said are you a David are you a David called elected first by God now how many Christians are here raise up your hand you're not a Christian by your desire you are a Christian by God's desire amen no man can come to me except my father draws him first you was elected by God before the foundation of the world to be a Christian that's scripture Jesus said no man can come to me except my father calls him he said so first thing you was elected called and then when God elected you then he called you and you heeded to his call then he poured the anointing oil on you the Holy Ghost and when the crws of oil what does the oil represent in the Bible the Holy Spirit and when he poured the oil upon him he baptized him with the Holy Spirit in a symbol form he said I hope you get that that just come fresh he poured the oil upon him and just went all over him a whole horn full of it not sparingly and that's the way God pours the holy ghost on a man not sparingly he just baptizes him into it anointing him with the spirit notice he right then when that anointing struck him he was positionally placed as king when that anointing struck him he was positionally placed as king and you are positionally placed in Christ Jesus as Kings and Priests is that right the moment you receive the Holy Ghost I want you to capture these words the moment you receive the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit God places you in the kingdom and air he said what a beautiful picture there you are now Paul in his letter in the Ephesian book when you look at it brother brandham brother brandham would come and tie these things together from Joshua that Ephesians parallels Joshua and Paul writing here in the third verse he said blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and we realize that Heavenly places is the believer's position in Christ Jesus and I I know that many of us as Christians that that many of us will we might feel like we have never being in a position to be able to say that we have amounted to anything or we might feel like sometimes that that we have never been in a position that we could say that we have witnessed the the supernatural or the spectacular come out of our own mortal flesh of by laying on the hands of of the sick and them being healed and being restored or or performing a miracle by by by speaking a word of Prophecy or things of that nature over over over somebody's life of maybe you can't put it put it down in paper where you where you saw a physical manifestation of the Holy Ghost and I realize that many many of Christians they they battle with Satan's attacks and his assments on making us feel like we are inadequate for not seeing or or understanding the very Supernatural or not seeing physical manifestation of God's power and Satan likes to make you feel like you are inadequate or or you're ill equipped and that just because you haven't seen something with a natural or in your own human life but in all actuality everything that you are as a Christian is is anything but ordinary I don't believe that that that that word ordinary should be in the Christian's vocabulary because there's nothing ordinary about a son and daughter of God because actually your whole entire life is Supernatural your entire being is Supernatural me and my wife was just talking yesterday to actually be a to actually have healthy born children in a world that we live in of of of of food that is depleted of nutrients to to be able to raise up children and to them to have all their function abilities I'd say it's It's Supernatural in in the least to be able to say that to have faith in a time of doubt it's completely Supernatural and to think about David when he was there and you might you he might have felt like he was insignificant as a little bitty old Shepherd boy when he was out there doing what his brothers wouldn't wouldn't do he was out there doing something and he might have looked like at some point in his life that he had been forgotten about and maybe in some people's eyes that David was underprivileged I would say that if you looked and you think about Mary the mother of Jesus that carried Jesus I'd say that she she may have never imagined that she was going to be chosen for something that was going to be so extraordinary that the world it would crumble the ideas of humanity that a virgin could could conceive and to think that she's going to be a part of this I highly doubt when her parents were were birthing her that when she came here that those things begin to come into her mind when you begin to think about the woman that washed Jesus's feet I I would say that it was likely that that likely she never thought that that she was going to be remembered throughout the generations but I love what David said in Psalm 65 and4 that blessed is a man whom thou choosest and causest to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts and we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thine house even of thy Holy Temple I'd say each of these members that we've just talked about I never look at them as days gone by but I always look at as as as characters in The Bible as a part of who we are and I I'd say that each of them each of them may have lived a life when they seem like it may have been just an ordinary life but I want you to realize that they was called for a greater purpose and they were were lifted up into Heavenly places and they were positioned by almighty God for something far beyond what they could see far beyond what they could comprehend and I I'd like to just maybe start this service here tonight and say so are you that your whole entire life is Supernatural and I never want it to be in your mind that you are just subpar that that that you are just ordinary because if youve receive the Holy Ghost you are Supernatural from the very crown of your head to the Souls of your feet if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have something that the devil has never had a part of you are a Powerhouse if you have a touch of Destiny by the Holy Ghost you have something that the world is trying to attain and Paul said in 1 Corinthians 1:27 that God has chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the wise and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty I'd say you could take our our little bitty our little bitty Prophet out of the hills of Kentucky he was a bootlegger son and nobody ever expected him or had the foresight to ever think that he would have a Ministry that would be powerful enough that he would be a that he would go and preach and he would he would lay hands on Kings and potentates actually the the hierarchy of the day and the men that surrounded William brandham they told him that these visions that he was having that those things were of the devil and they told him not to touch those things to the church World couldn't understand who who what William brandham was they couldn't understand his gift they couldn't understand his ministry they could not believe that he had met an angel they could not understand how how that this Angelic being was inspiring him to take him from scripture to scripture and tie these things together but I I want you to know they didn't realize how how great this man was but if you'd asked the maniac from Portland he would have a different story because this man had come in contact with a with a man that had knew God and had handled God and he wasn't afraid to stand in the face of a of a Maniac in the midst when all other preachers was scared in the city here stood a man that should have been scared looking at the at the at the fragments of his body and looking at the build of his body he should have been scared of that man but the God that was on the inside of William brandham he could tell a different story that that Maniac had to lay his hand and lay his body on top of William pranom because he realized that Satan has to understand that the challenge that he's come up against that when Satan comes and you've got something that's worth contending for Satan's going to fight you I don't think it should surprise any any Christian that if you've got anything of your life that it that it's worth having then Satan's going to contend for it that's why that Maniac came against William brandham because he had something where contending for it the hierarchy of the church World couldn't stop it demons couldn't stop it because all of heaven was behind it that Maniac had a different story and Elijah Perry had a different story when William brand in there when when William brandham went in there to console the family when Elijah Perry had died from Hemes where he had bled out brother brandham just went in there to console the family and when William brandham consoled the family he walked out and he was walking out out and brother random said that Elijah Perry had blood all over his body where he had completely HED out and he felt a hand upon his shoulder and turned him around and he said when I come to myself he said I was on top of him he said I had blood all over myself he said and I was calling for Elijah's life to come back you talk about Elijah talking to Elijah right there that he's asking for life to come back and die on Dry Bones he's he's asking for it to come back I'd say Elijah Perry could tell a different story he was elected he was called he was anointed and he was placed back into life again we realize that when brother brandham comes into the adoption series he picks up that Ephesians chapter one and he said we are assembled in Heavenly places he said that means that's the position of the believer he said that if I'm prayed up and you're prayed up or the church has prayed up we're ready for the message and we've assembled ourselves together as Saints called out baptized with the Holy Ghost filled with God's blessings called elected set together in Heavenly places now we are heavenlies in our souls our Spirits has brought us into a Heavenly atmosphere he said oh brother there you are a Heavenly atmosphere you see the difference between between you and the rest of the world is that you are a Creator you you have something on the inside of you I'd say that that that heaven has done something on the inside of you that you have the the ability to be able to create and he goes on to say he said now oh what could happen tonight he said what could happen tonight if we would be sitting here in in Heavenly atmosphere and the Holy Spirit moving over every heart that's been regenerated and become a new creature in Christ Jesus I I would like to ask that question tonight what could happen here tonight what could happen here tonight because we realize that we're Heavenly in our souls that even though Satan might battle us in our flesh and might battle us in our spirit but we are Heavenly in our souls and we realize that as globally in that we are in a very pit moment that as you look at Warlords that are setting themselves up that are being set up like like Warlords that are going on with Israel and Iran of Russia and Ukraine and you look at the USA and she's she is flexing her muscles and you are watching demon powers as they are moving into position and we realize that when William brandham comes and he preaches recog izing your day and its message he said National Force put Israel back in her Homeland again he said but it will be the power of the Holy Ghost that will put the people in The Bride because Jesus said my word is spirit and but my word is spirit and his life he said so the word will put the bride in her position and all of this you say well what is all this message about brother Andrew it's to put Eve back in her position again it's to put her back the whole thing of Christ The Mystery of God revealed it's eve being placed back in her rightful position again it should take her back there that's exactly what the message of the hour has done it's restored you you might feel like you're living an ordinary life but you're not you might feel like you're just going through the motions but you're not you might feel like you're just listening to a tape but you're not you might feel like you're just going to another church service but you're not why because you are Heavenly in your soul and the message has restored you back you don't have to succumb to Satan's Antics and believe his lies because there is a restoration that has put a bride in position to enforce the claims of the god that wrote the word now in the Samaran Church age brother manam goes into galatian chapter 4 and I'm just going to lay some foundational things here he he says now comes our triumphal Capstone on the baptism with the Holy Ghost and he pulls up Galatians 4 and4 and he says but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his Spirit or his God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons because you are sons and because you are Sons Sons God sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying ABA father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ he said there it is Jesus Christ came forth died upon the cross accomplished Redemption restoring to original owner by means of purchase or paying the price thereby plac us as Sons he did not make us Sons we for we are already Sons but he placed us as Sons for as long as we were in the world in the flesh we could not be recognized as his sons we were held captive by the devil but we were Sons nonetheless and hear this and because you are Sons God have sent forth his Spirit of his son into your hearts whereby you cry father father you see when you are saying that when a Jew is saying that it is the most intimate speech that a son can have to his father he is saying your heart is crying your spirit is crying you are my father my father he said upon whom did the Spirit fall at Pentecost Sons at Corinth whom who did it fall upon upon sons while they heard the word that's what the Bible said in Acts 10:44 that while the Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fail the reason why the Holy Ghost most fell on them was because they were Sons they had the identity of a son they may not look like it like a son on the outside but their entire identity was a son I believe that one of the key message or the key features of the message I is it's placing the bride back in her position but I also believe that it's growing of Greater of Satan's greatest tactics is to steal the identity of the Church of the Living God and to Rob her of her position and to cause a spiritual Amnesia to come upon the Church of the Living God and steal her identity to make her forget who she is forget she's got power and forget that she's a son and daughter of almighty God I was I was reading just before we left before church about about a story and it's called the prince the princes of the towers and then there there was a king Edward I 6 I believe and he had he had two sons and he had a brother his name was Richard and I I believe they were in England and so anyways say Richard was Richard uh Richard was wanting a throne for himself and King Edward I 6 had passed away and he went and these boys were just 12 years old so the King Richard he took and he he placed these two boys up in a tower and after a while after a while they they begin to lose their identity people actually started telling rumors that these boys were illegitimate even though they were the King's son and they they the end of the story was they they they thought that it still remains to be a mi a mystery because they don't even know what happened to them boys but this Uncle wanted the throne for himself so he took away their robes he took away the he took away their crowns he took away their identity you see you see you see you can take you can take just like just like Legion in the Bible what did Satan do he went in there and the first thing that he did he took away his identity he started robbing him of his clothes and gave him gave him devil clothes and what did he do he automatically displaced him he robbed him of his dresswear he began to scar him but when you see when the difference between the prince in towers and this man Legion was Legion came back to himself is that Jesus came in there and restored him back and notice when when Jesus restores the man he find you find him in the next picture he is sitting at the feet of the word you see the Bible said in Hosea 8 and4 they have set up Kings but not by me you see it's God's duty to place men in position not men that's why when Jesus is writing out Revelations chapter 1 he said he hath made us Kings and Priests so William brandham said salvation is his doing salvation is of the Lord ain't you thankful about that today that it ain't up to man to save you you it ain't up to William brandom to save you it ain't up to Ron Spencer to save you but Salvation is of the Lord ah come on now he said now all of Grace he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose we are Kings spiritual Kings oh we are going to be Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits on his throne but now we are spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom because the Bible said in Romans 5:1 17 for by one man's offense death reigned by one much more for they which received an abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ also colos Colossians 1:3 who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom reign of his dear son so right now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin the World the Flesh and the devil showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself for it is Christ in US willing and doing of his good pleasure yes indeed even now we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you so what does that got to do with my ordinary life I'll say it like this that all the qualities that was in Jesus Christ is now in you if you are seated as a as a Bible believing Christian as d David was standing there as a typee of Christ when the anointing oil flowed over his life he was placed as King David went back to being a Shepherd but he was placed as a king you might go back to Wars in your mind but you're still placed as a king you might go through troubles but you're still placed as a King when he filled you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are still placed as a king if the enemy comes in like a flood you are still placed as a king when the weapon that the enemy has formed against you you are still placed as a king when your family leaves you you are placed as a king when your friends walk away from you you are placed as a king I say this God did not put you here to rain over lay Osa to let you fall in ruin but he placed you here to raise up and be the Victorious son of almighty God that's why I have the ability to say cancer take your leave that's why I have the ability to say Satan get underneath of my feet because I didn't put myself here he put me here come on Ron Spencer didn't put me here hmer Frasier didn't put me here but a king saw that I was worth saving so he saved me he filled me and he gave me a crown he crowned my life with the Holy Ghost and I tell you what David's one of my favorite characters there's some powerful about David there a lot of kids that were probably named David there's a probably a lot of kids that was 12 years old and they was probably Ruddy but there was something different about this boy that the Bible declares that he was a man after God's Own Heart he was a kind of guy that you couldn't look on his outside because the outside would fool him but on the inside it'll it'll shut down all kinds of things I say that that's what you got to look to you can't look to your flesh because your flesh is going to let you down you can't look to the things that are around you because those things are going to let you down there was something about David that made him think different that made him hear different that made him worship different I love studying out David's Che when he's back there in a Shepherd because I'll be I'll be honest that's where David learned to be a king at that's really where he learned to be a king at because he's writing out Psalms 22 he writes out Psalms 23 and he gets there in the face of fear and he doesn't buckle to it now the Bible said in Romans 10:1 17 that Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God is that right so doubt is got to come the same way it's just you choose to listen to the wrong voice and David was back there by himself and I'd say that when you get by yourself there's a lot of things that'll start talking to you your mind will start talking to you your spirit will start talking to you and the enemy start talking to you you ain't got no friends you don't look lovely you don't look worthy you don't look big enough you're all out there by yourself but David chose not to listen to them voices David chose to give his power over to a kingship that he can see you see it's what voice you begin to Value because when you constantly are listening to fear and negativity and lies from the enemy you watch because you got good ground I just be real honest this this this this ground right here in Full Gospel Lighthouse it's good ground because if if you start preaching Faith to this good ground right here you'll watch Miracles start happening I'll I'll just be real honest with you you can say something to brother sanon and you let that seed fall in there you watch a miracle take place I I just say you could say it to brother Jerry because it's good ground and you let that seed fall in there and you watch a miracle take place why because it's good ground but if you are constantly listening to fear and constantly listening to well you're not good enough well God won't come through your prayers ain't going to change anything then doubt will begin to grow as quick as faith will if you'll begin to water that thing that's why I never listen to stupid people I I learned this a long time ago I you can't listen anything that the devil says because anything that comes out of H I tell you what makes me dangerous is when when you I just don't care I really just don't care what the devil says about me I really don't care what he says I'm going to die with I really don't care what he says I'm going to go to the Grave with I really don't care that's why I choose not to listen to stupid people that's why I choose not to listen to half-hearted Christians when they try to tell you that this is the way you got to live your life but they can't gets out of a paper bag so I choose to listen to this word because Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God I choose to listen to people that's got faith in their mouth I choose to listen to people that's got courage in our mouth I choose to listen to people that want to praise God whether they want to praise God or not they still praise God I choose to have those kind of friends that want to worship when they shouldn't be worship I want to have them kind of friends that believe when Satan tries to stop them from [Applause] believing do you hear what the devil said about you brother Angel I really don't care what the devil me because I've already read what a king said about me that he made me a king King Hallelujah and the devil can't take it away from me I've been crowned as a [Applause] king well blessed be the name of the Lord so I choose to refuse doubt and accept Faith Come On Son you know good and well the devil's been trying to talk to you and give you to doubt this message and doubt your healing and doubt your existence as a Son of God but stand there on your god-given privileges and take back Goliath's greatest weapon was his past his greatest weapon was his past but David's greatest weapon was not his P God Bless America David's greatest weapon was not his past but his future my past it's not my greatest weapon but my future is I'm a son in his eyes I was born to be a king I Was Born To Worship I was born to praise my pastor's not my weapon but my future of Heaven is my goal the Rapture is for [Applause] me brother random say about salvation he said he would he would illustrate it like a little button he said now when you're saved he said it's like a little bitt of button on the inside of you and he said as you begin to grow that little button begins to grow and he said as it begins to grow it begins to crowd out it begins to crowd out unbelief and it begins to crowd out un unbelief and fear and anxiety i' say i' say it's time that you let that seed of life begin to grow on the inside of you let it come to life he's designed you with a purpose to live for him you realize that he's designed you to be a king even when you don't look like it even when you don't feel like it he designed you now you remember when William brandom starts telling that story I I hope I Ain't Got You disturbed by me throwing my tie off I I just forgive me please forgive me I wouldn't do anything to offend the holy ghost or anybody else here but you realize that brother man start talking about that preacher went to that mechanic his his his car got to acting up on him and he was he was got to I'm sorry don't worry about it I'll be okay and so remember that little mechanic he was there and he was working on that car and and all of a sudden that he he tried this and he tried that and finally a man brother man said a man stood up in there in a in a in a real nice suit and and he said now why don't you tried this Sunday he said instead of that old mechanic being arrogant all those things he he actually listen to him said well what do you what do you suggest and he starts taking his advice and he said try this and try that he started doing this and everything that he couldn't do started working together and he looked up at him and said now who are you he said well I'm the chief engineer I'm the guy that built that thing so God knows exactly what he put in you to make the Dynamics Roll Just in right in time that because he's designed you in such a way and brother man him said it like this he knows what it takes to put a church in a Rapture order he designed it and put the parts together here in the Bible so you are designed by the word of God so no matter what comes against you you're designed by the word of God no matter what the enemy says against you you are designed by the word of God because he's still Jehovah jahra that he can provide himself a church and whether people want to serve God or not God is still able to raise up stones from Abraham and to make them sons of God I find it amazing that Jesus is standing there and Jesus is standing there 16 chapters later in Luke and he comes there and he's facing the same guys that John the Baptist was facing when he's standing up there preaching that if you ain't going to serve God God will raise Stones up and when they come in there in Luke chapter 19 and they begin to scream Behold thy King cometh riding to you on the F the coold of an ass and they begin to bless His holy name and said he was the most high God they turned to him and said why don't you why don't you turn around and rebuke your disciples for saying these things he said now if they don't cry out then the stones is going to cry out and I say this like we were singing ain't no Rock going to cry in my place ain't no stone going to cry in my place because as long as I'm alive I'm going to sing because I was designed by almighty God to be somebody that would take the word of God and put it upon their lips they would take Revelations 10:7 they would be Revelations 10:8 they would go and take the little book that was not closed but it was open unto them and they would stand there under the prophecy of Revelations 10:11 and they would prophesy again I love what D when in Deuteronomy chapter 30 that when Moses starts lining out the Commandments that that now Moses now you Moses is a pretty profound guy even though he he say he's got stuttering problem he he's pretty profound he's got some Revelation from almighty God and he stands there and he said now he said this commandment I've given unto you it ain't up in heaven and he said it ain't underneath the Earth he said it's so close that the devil will miss it he said but it's not thee and it's even in thy mouth now turn with me to 1st Samuel uh 17-31 and and when the words were heard which David spake they rehearse him before for S now I think that right there is enough to preach rest of the night on that right there that they rehears them before Saul that David had done got so so loud in the mouth that everybody around started telling Saul about it that's my kind of testimony service right there this wasn't just some popcorn testimony but David had some gumption about him he started telling about how he he went in there and done all these things now let me read on before I get ah hit of myself and he sent for him and David said to Saul let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine and Saul said to David thou are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he's a man of war from his youth it sounds like a good guy to be talking don't it and David said un sa thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a took it out of his flock and I went out after him and I smoted him and I and I delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me I caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him my servant slew both the line and the A and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them seeing he ha defiled the armies of the Living God David said moreover the Lord that delivered me out of the Paw of the lion and out of the Paw of the bear he would deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine and Saul said unto David go and the Lord be with you now I I I'd like to just say if we could just let them rocks talk I I satting there and I was in my study and and a brother gave me one of them rocks that was over there in that little creek he could have got it from anywhere but I trust the guy so I'm going to say he got it out of that Creek so I was sitting there and I was looking at that thing you know I'd say them rocks was probably there probably 4,000 years ago when David was there if we get to talking to them rocks and looking at them you you'd say that that rock we could say he was elected he was called by David he was anointed when he when David dropped him in his script bag and brother bandam said he that that David was a shepherd and had that honey in there because he had that honey for when he when his sheep got sick and he when he when he pulled that thing out it had the anointing on it so he so you see he said that's beautiful man there some honey in that rock right there he he pulls that rock out of there and it's got some honey on it and it's here it is it's elected it's called it's anointed and it's getting ready to be placed in a place am and you know you if you can only realize your position like David realized his position that something could take place right here that the Goliath of cancer would have to shut its mouth because the Bible didn't say tomorrow we will be the sons of God but it says right now we're the sons of God Jesus said it in his word right now we are sons of God you ain't got to sit there and say well I got to figure out how in order I'm going to create this power there is something powerful about you you don't have to manufacure no power because the original birth of the Holy Ghost will reproduce Christ in you the hope of glory the same qualities that was in Christ is the same qualities that's in you you ain't got to manufacture nothing man said that he was over in them uh in India and he said I was watching them firew walkers he said there they was he said they is out there and he said they was out there worshiping their idols and they was dancing around and he said they stick all kinds of swords and different things to their lips and mouths and he's walking over him hot coals and he said he said and Pentecostal is getting like that he said they are tried he said because they're always trying to manufacture something he said but the difference between the Hebrew children and these guys he said they didn't manufacture it they just they didn't tempt the Lord they just stepped into it you see you don't have to manufacture a healing if it's in you to produce it you don't have to manufacture giving the Holy Ghost it's in you to give it you don't have to manufacture anything you see that's the reason why the church world is in its case right now is because they're producing bastard born children they ain't been with the mate they ain't got no life in it they can't keep to the same word and they're producing stillborn kids they ain't got no power they never had an experience with the Holy Ghost I say this that if your children ain't got the Holy Ghost put them under this message put them under this message because what they are lacking is the essential oil that's been poured out in this generation by Malachi for under this ministry and it's placed us in a creation spot to create an atmosphere Where Eagles can be born David had the oil poured over him this woman of Grace has had the anointing oil poured over top of her and she is fully prepared to be restored right beside her King what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying this that just like David begin to speak you got to speak that David literally begin to speak his victory before he ever saw Goliath all he heard was his voice that's all he heard now I want to ask you a question how many's heard that you're not good enough and you're not going to make a Rapture you heard the voice but you didn't see the spirit where it came from now you know good and well that that Spirit didn't come from God because he's never said in your word in his word that you're not good enough and you're not going to make the Rapture but he said very much contrary but David just kept hearing it and there was something different about this voice he he realized that that wasn't the The Voice voice of of a friend that wasn't a voice of of a comrade on his side but it was a voice from an enemy and I always wondered why in the world was David's brother so worked up I mean come on now I mean wouldn't you wouldn't you wouldn't you like to be identified as the as the the guy that your brother killed that big old giant ain't that crazy like I know good and well that brother Jerry's the kind of brother that if David David that's funny Davey walks out there and he he goes out there and slays that Jerry's not the kind of guy so you you knucklehead you should have been back there feeding the Sheep why'd you bring us this cornbread down here I know good and well Jerry ain't that kind of guy but Jerry's going to get behind him I always wonder why in the world people can't get behind the message of the hour we're brothers here I don't care if brother Ron gets it done I don't care if brother Tim gets it done I don't care if brother Donnie gets it done we're on the same side don't call us a bunch of Knuckleheads get behind us get behind us instead of sitting there say you can't do it you're too small you ain't good enough you ain't got enough armor you ain't got enough intellectual properties be able to do it get behind David I got behind I I I'll just be honest with you somebody probably crucify me over this but I'm just going to tell it anyway but yesterday I was at my daughter's basketball game and and I walked into the restroom and I was coming out and I was I was getting ready I was getting ready to exit out and uh as Spirit of the Lord dealt with me I actually thought I had to get myself together cuz I thought we was going to have one them meetings you know I just the spirit of the Lord got so real and I I began to think about the fan Factor that that if you ever you ever seen a a team that you know was going to lose oh Lord is this Full Gospel Lighthouse thought I'd done moved in the Church of Christ here for a minute but you ever you ever been I know good and well I was on that football team everybody showed up and they realized we was getting beat now the year before we won a whole lot cuz Matthew was on a team but when it was my turn the fans knew we were going to have a two and eight record they were impressed that we won two still going to still got a touchdown on Spotswood praise God let me get back to the serious part of what I was talking about but you you realize that when that's funny that that's funny some of y'all people ain't from here you don't understand but you people are from here you know it's a fan factor for sure you put for defiance and Spotswood High School together it's a fan Factor but I I satting there and the Lord started dealing with me on this you can crucify me if you want to or not but I I'll just be real honest it was a real sincere moment and I I begin to think that there's a whole lot of people that are sitting in the crowd and they was up there on that hill and they wasn't one person that walked down there with David it wasn't one person that was behind David Saul sent him out there on a death errand Saul wasn't even down there in the valley with it you can hear it in a crowd you can hear it in a crowd when they do not believe that their team is going to win I'll just be real honest with you you can hear it in a church service when when people don't feel like they're going to get anything they they they there's all of a sudden a fan Factor comes in and they don't realize that they're getting ready to win one of the greatest battles if you just if you just get in it and and David walked down in there completely alone to the naked eye there was nobody cheering David on but on the other side there was shouts on the other side there was screams on the other side there was shouts it that their God was now going to sit there and they were going to watch the Philistine God become the god of the Israelites there that side was screaming this side had no voice behind it but that's to the naked eye because if we can look up into the Heavenly banister there was an arrayment of angels that were gathered around when nobody else was with David the Angels was with David and when nobody walked down in the valley with David the anointing was on David when nobody was cheering David on the anointing was there when nobody believed that he could do it Hallelujah let me say this to you little bride whether anybody cheers you on or not run run run whether anybody says you can do it or not fight go you will win the battle if you believe it this message is enough if you believe it the Holy Ghost is enough if you believe [Applause] it David let's hang up some trophies real quick because when you've got anything as I said that's worth contending for the enemy is going to come for it and sometimes it might come from the voices that are close to you and sometimes it'll come from the voices of the other side because when you start studying out 2 Samuel chapter 5 that when David has placed as king that immediately the Philistines started to seek him out when he comes into his kingship the enemy comes in and when you are crowned with the Holy Ghost don't think you're getting off easy that's when the enem is coming after you but David is standing there said I hung up this when pornography said I wasn't going to defeat it I hung it up when a line came in there of depression I hung it up when all the enemies that came in to steal God's children away I hung that up there and I'll say this that he be to prophesy his victory before he ever saw it and the Bible of Jesus Christ is the same way taking Revelations 10:11 and Deuteronomy 13:14 and she's putting the word that is in her mouth and she's speaking it just like Isaiah 5355 and 11 and the word is accomplishing what she says it's going to be she is beginning to prophesy that she's going to see Miracles that she is seeing Miracles that prodical are returning that healing is in our body that I will lay my hands on the sick and they shall recover she starts putting a word in her mouth and she starts believing it she starts valuing her own voice nobody else was saying this everybody else was saying it can't be done but this little David believed it could be done if he can take down a line he can take down a be surely he can take down a blasphemer come on some it's time that you shut Goliath's mouth once and for all imagine a court scene the judge is in his position the prosecutors in his def his position the defense attorneys in his position the jury's in its position and you you you sitting there and your watching and this criminal that is standing before the judge he's as guilty as guilty can be and the judge has the sentence in his hand and he has the verdict and he sentenced him to death and this criminal starts losing his ever loving mind he starts trying to manipulate the crowd he starts crying and anger and he starts screaming out and trying to trying to trying to prove that he's not guilty trying to scream all these things and the prosecutor stands up with the verdict in his hand and said look he's guilty he's guilty of these crimes he's guilty of these things I believe it the judges said it get him out of here and the BFFs walk in and they carry him out he's screaming all that time but he can't do nothing about it because the verdicts already been wrote so is a body of Jesus Christ the judg has already said it the cross has already proved it and this body of Jesus Christ is holding up the verdict in her hand and telling him it's over you will not manipulate me with fear no longer you will not try to curse me with anger no longer get out of here let me tell you what Jesus said in John 1611 the prince of this world is already judged he's already I want to say the thing that is cursing you is already been judged the thing that's tormenting you has already been judged and you have been positionally placed as a son and daughter of almighty God hold the verdict up it's over devil it's over devil it's over I'm telling you devil we're through come on somebody let the musicians come blessed be the name of the Lord most [Applause] high David didn't have anybody but he still one Jesus didn't have nobody but he still one me put it like this William Brandon didn't have no peers hey was nobody could Fellowship on the ministry that he was fellowshipping with there's a lot of Great Men and I've studied a lot of their context out but ain't none of them said they had a meeting with an angel in a cave there nobody that could fellowship with William brandom on the same level that he was in but I want to say this he ain't Alone nowall William brandham still W and you might feel like you're all alone and I want to bring this completely back around just now you are elected called anointed in place you ain't alone in this battle David was alone but you're not alone I'm going I'm going to finish this service with Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 5 if you have the passion translation I I I know it'd be a blessing to them we we've read over Ephesians 2 and 5 till we known it like the back of our hand but I I found this quite profound and the the passion it says even when we were dead and doomed in our many sins he United us into the very Life of Christ and saved us by his Wonderful Grace he raised us up with Christ the exalted one and we ascended with him into his glorious Perfection and authority of the Heavenly realm for we are now co-seeded as one with Christ throughout the coming ages we will be the visible display of the infinite Limitless Riches of the his grace and kindness which was showered Upon Us in Jesus Christ may God bless his word father we come before you Lord Jesus we extend our gratitude towards the heavens we express how grateful that we are that you have placed us in a position to realize Who We Are in the midst of Le oosa when we realize that the church world is naked she's miserable blind and she don't even know one but there's a body on Earth that she sees visibly that she's decorated in the grace of almighty God she's covered by the Limitless Grace and everything about her is decorated with the blood of Jesus Christ father I pray in these broken up words that you would make us aware that your presence is ever before us and that you will never leave us and you will never forsake us in our worst of Despair and in our greatest battles you are there and father maybe we don't understand why the crowd isn't behind us sometimes but may we never fail to recognize that the voice from the world that is unseen has already spoken our Victory so father we commit this service and these words into your hands in the name of Jesus God bless you let's sing this let's sing this tonight and Worship the Lord who conquered all and you are my [Applause] Champion Giants for when you stand undefeated every battle You Are I Am who you say I am you Crown me with confidence I am see de in the Heavenly Place defeated with the one who has [Music] ConEd I've tried so hard to see it took me so long to believe it that you choose someone like me to carry your [Music] Victory Perfection could never ear you give what you don't deserve you take the broken things and praise him to glory and you
