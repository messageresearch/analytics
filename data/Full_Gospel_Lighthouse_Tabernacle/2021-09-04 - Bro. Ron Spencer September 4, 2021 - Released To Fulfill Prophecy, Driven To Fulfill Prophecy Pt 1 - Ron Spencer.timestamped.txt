[1:06:25] if you'll remember brother branham will
[1:06:26] use a term about the welch revival he
[1:06:28] said there were some critical preachers
[1:06:30] that went there
[1:06:31] and they were looking for the welt's
[1:06:33] revival
[1:06:35] and carloads of them were looking and
[1:06:37] they came to a police officer
[1:06:40] and was standing there waving and they
[1:06:42] said we're looking for the welch revival
[1:06:44] and he said
[1:06:45] you have arrived
[1:06:49] so if you're looking for the bride's
[1:06:51] revival i i'd like to just tell you we
[1:06:53] have arrived
[1:06:56] it's not coming it's here
[1:06:59] amen and so we we know it'll be a short
[1:07:02] quick work
[1:07:04] we're seeing phenomenal miracles take
[1:07:06] place
[1:07:07] and uh if you haven't seen a miracle
[1:07:09] lately
[1:07:10] right here's one just to still be
[1:07:12] standing so
[1:07:13] amen amen we love you with all of our
[1:07:16] hearts i'd like to speak to you on
[1:07:19] released
[1:07:20] to fulfill
[1:07:22] prophecy
[1:07:24] driven
[1:07:25] to fulfill
[1:07:27] prophecy
[1:07:28] brother branham will use a couple terms
[1:07:30] and he would say this day
[1:07:33] this scripture
[1:07:35] is fulfilled
[1:07:37] literally
[1:07:38] in a service
[1:07:43] literally in a service four or five hour
[1:07:45] service literally in that service
[1:07:48] prophecy that had been laying there for
[1:07:50] hundreds of years
[1:07:52] in a gap of about four hours
[1:07:55] now's history
[1:08:00] now now that's quite a statement
[1:08:03] it's quite statement
[1:08:05] to give you an idea of what we're
[1:08:06] thinking of
[1:08:07] prophecy intercepts with time
[1:08:11] it can it can actually hover around the
[1:08:13] earth for hundreds of years and when the
[1:08:15] time comes
[1:08:17] and the individuals comes that have been
[1:08:19] pre-planned
[1:08:20] to be a part of that
[1:08:22] then it just happens
[1:08:27] it doesn't matter what the critics say
[1:08:29] it just happens
[1:08:32] mary was standing
[1:08:35] going to get water
[1:08:36] and an angel stepped from another
[1:08:38] dimension
[1:08:42] it did not matter what the critics said
[1:08:46] there's a bride on the earth that is
[1:08:48] standing here
[1:08:51] are you catching it now
[1:08:53] we're not looking for her she's standing
[1:08:56] here amen
[1:08:59] amen
[1:09:02] isaiah chapter 65 and verse 17.
[1:09:09] for behold i create a new heavens
[1:09:12] and a new earth
[1:09:14] and the former shall be not remembered
[1:09:18] nor come into mind
[1:09:20] imagine what isaiah was looking at
[1:09:23] the same one that prophesied a virgin
[1:09:25] shall conceive
[1:09:26] but now he's looking at you
[1:09:31] but be glad and rejoice forever in that
[1:09:34] which i create
[1:09:36] for behold i create jerusalem of
[1:09:38] rejoicing
[1:09:40] and her people a joy
[1:09:42] and i will rejoice in jerusalem and joy
[1:09:45] in in my people and the voice of weeping
[1:09:48] shall be no more hurted her nor the
[1:09:51] voice of crying
[1:09:53] these are phenomenal thoughts
[1:09:55] there shall be no more offense and
[1:09:58] infinite of days
[1:10:00] nor an old man
[1:10:01] that hath not filled his days for the
[1:10:04] child shall die at a hundred years old
[1:10:07] but the sinner being a hundred year old
[1:10:10] shall be cursed
[1:10:13] and they shall build houses and inhabit
[1:10:16] them and they shall plant vineyards and
[1:10:18] eat the fruit of them
[1:10:20] they shall not build and another inhabit
[1:10:24] they shall not plant and another eat
[1:10:27] for as the days of a tree are the days
[1:10:30] of my people and my
[1:10:33] mine elect
[1:10:34] shall long enjoy the work of their hands
[1:10:38] they shall not labor in vain
[1:10:40] nor bring forth for trouble
[1:10:42] for they are the seed of the blessed
[1:10:46] of the earth
[1:10:48] and their offspring with them
[1:10:51] and it shall come to pass that before
[1:10:54] they call i will answer
[1:10:58] and while they are yet speaking i will
[1:11:00] hear
[1:11:02] the wolf and the lamb shall feed
[1:11:04] together and the lion shall eat straw
[1:11:08] like a bullock and dust shall be the
[1:11:11] serpent's meat
[1:11:12] and they shall not hurt nor destroy in
[1:11:16] my holy mount
[1:11:18] saith
[1:11:19] the lord
[1:11:20] can i just share with you one more
[1:11:22] scripture while you're standing
[1:11:24] revelations 19 and verse 6.
[1:11:28] and i heard as if it were a voice of a
[1:11:31] great multitude as a voice of many
[1:11:33] waters
[1:11:35] as the voice of a mighty thundering
[1:11:37] saying hallelujah the lord god
[1:11:40] omnipotent reigneth
[1:11:42] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:11:45] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:11:47] lamb has come
[1:11:49] and his wife hath made herself ready
[1:11:58] and to her was granted that she should
[1:12:00] be arrayed and find linen clean and
[1:12:03] white for the fine linen is the
[1:12:05] righteousness of the saints
[1:12:07] and he saith unto me right
[1:12:10] blessed are they which are called unto
[1:12:13] the marriage supper of the lamb amen
[1:12:17] i'm talking about you now
[1:12:20] i'm gonna spend much of this service
[1:12:21] talking about you blessed are they which
[1:12:24] are called into the marriage supper of
[1:12:26] the lamb
[1:12:29] and he saith unto me
[1:12:31] these are the true saiyans
[1:12:34] of god maybe you have a need on your
[1:12:37] heart you just like to lift it before
[1:12:39] the lord just now
[1:12:40] amen
[1:12:42] almighty god we love you with all of our
[1:12:44] hearts
[1:12:46] we thank you for every individual that's
[1:12:48] standing here present and those that are
[1:12:50] watching even now
[1:12:52] the many needs that have come before us
[1:12:54] this week
[1:12:55] and god you're able to meet every one of
[1:12:58] them
[1:12:59] father there's not a god of this earth
[1:13:01] can meet one of those needs but you can
[1:13:03] meet every one of them
[1:13:05] you're the alpha and the omega the
[1:13:07] beginning of the end
[1:13:09] we ask you now that you would anoint
[1:13:11] this service in a mighty way
[1:13:14] drive back satan that would try to
[1:13:16] hinder this service in any way anything
[1:13:19] that would be done that would be
[1:13:21] irreverent i ask you now that you would
[1:13:23] anoint this audience with praise
[1:13:25] anoint them with worship
[1:13:27] anoint them that the seed of the word
[1:13:30] can ignite their hearts
[1:13:32] like never before father
[1:13:34] in jesus christ's name we pray
[1:13:37] a man and a man and amen you can be
[1:13:40] seated
[1:13:44] amen
[1:13:46] thinking of this pattern of scriptures
[1:13:48] and this is the great quote book itself
[1:13:51] john is as as i cannot even i cannot
[1:13:54] even fathom what it would have been like
[1:13:56] for
[1:13:57] isaiah to be able to see the end time
[1:14:02] he saw the
[1:14:03] the redeemer come
[1:14:06] he saw as a as a literally to be able to
[1:14:08] write the
[1:14:10] basically a commentary of the entire
[1:14:12] bible
[1:14:14] and then to to see the beginning all the
[1:14:17] way to the end and to see the bride even
[1:14:20] sitting at the marriage supper of the
[1:14:22] lamb and
[1:14:23] walking in our new city where a wolf
[1:14:26] and a lamb would lay together
[1:14:30] sometimes we just let words like that
[1:14:31] roll off of our lips but that could
[1:14:33] never be done in this fallen condition
[1:14:37] but god is not going to just
[1:14:40] recreate you
[1:14:43] you being a part of that eternal plan
[1:14:46] but this earth is part of that eternal
[1:14:48] plan
[1:14:49] where that this earth will be made over
[1:14:52] again
[1:14:53] where a lion and the lamb can lay
[1:14:55] together
[1:14:59] hallelujah a place where there'll be no
[1:15:02] pain
[1:15:03] no agony no death no graveyards
[1:15:08] no hospitals
[1:15:11] no drug addiction
[1:15:13] no sin nowhere
[1:15:16] nobody impatient
[1:15:18] only worship on their mind
[1:15:21] what a land to be from
[1:15:24] hallelujah can i talk about it just a
[1:15:26] little bit
[1:15:27] john was sitting there and he's on the
[1:15:29] isle of patmos and he's he's in one
[1:15:32] realm looking into another
[1:15:34] and i saw a new heaven and a new earth
[1:15:38] 21 verse 1 and i saw a new heaven and a
[1:15:41] new earth for the first heaven and the
[1:15:44] first earth were passed away
[1:15:47] let me just say right here at this
[1:15:48] junction of time don't plan on staying
[1:15:51] here
[1:15:56] don't plan on staying here
[1:16:01] this morning i i got up and i i just
[1:16:04] went to tears
[1:16:06] the messenger to sodom
[1:16:08] the messenger the pastor of presidents
[1:16:12] i i i read a commentary every morning
[1:16:15] from billy graham
[1:16:17] and i read a commentary from several
[1:16:20] guys but but anyway one's from billy
[1:16:22] graham
[1:16:24] and he just brought me to tears
[1:16:26] and he said for hundreds of years we've
[1:16:28] looked at newspapers and we've looked at
[1:16:30] telegrams
[1:16:32] and the news and it catches us and we're
[1:16:35] if we're not careful we'll be consumed
[1:16:38] with the headlines
[1:16:41] and he said it'll cause us to get
[1:16:42] emotional one way or another
[1:16:46] he said but i want to tell you this
[1:16:49] this world will not be here much longer
[1:16:54] there's a kingdom of christ that is
[1:16:56] coming
[1:16:57] and he's going to make everything new
[1:17:00] i'd like to echo that thought
[1:17:04] these presidents that we have up and
[1:17:07] down and and economics that we have up
[1:17:10] and down and and even this covert that
[1:17:13] we have that has everybody terrified
[1:17:17] just today i got two calls about
[1:17:19] is the
[1:17:20] is the vaccine the mark of the beast
[1:17:24] well let me just say this to you if that
[1:17:26] is the mark of the beast
[1:17:28] we have missed the rapture
[1:17:33] [Applause]
[1:17:43] are you with me
[1:17:44] well brother ron you know they've got a
[1:17:46] little piece of a chip of computer that
[1:17:49] they're putting in your body
[1:17:52] what are you reading
[1:17:56] what what are you reading
[1:18:01] well brother ron that that's a that's a
[1:18:03] sign of the mark of the beast brother
[1:18:05] branham got those shots
[1:18:10] i don't care if you do or you don't it's
[1:18:12] your health
[1:18:14] i don't care i don't i don't want to be
[1:18:16] a part of your politics
[1:18:18] but there is a mark of the beast
[1:18:20] [Applause]
[1:18:23] and it's a whole lot more dangerous than
[1:18:25] this covert that we're fooling with
[1:18:41] now let me let me just let me just bear
[1:18:44] in mind there's going to come worse and
[1:18:45] worse plagues on the earth
[1:18:50] are you with me
[1:18:51] and we've lost four from this audience
[1:18:54] we've three and then brother meadows's
[1:18:56] son would be four let me just say this
[1:18:59] to you they stepped from this dimension
[1:19:01] to that dimension
[1:19:04] and listen as a christian we don't lose
[1:19:11] we don't lose
[1:19:14] well brother ron i'm afraid it'll make
[1:19:15] me sterile
[1:19:16] well
[1:19:18] you might have been sterile before all
[1:19:19] of that
[1:19:20] there's a sister that's sick here
[1:19:22] they're taking in the rescue squad
[1:19:24] sister rachel vance and so we want to
[1:19:26] remember her in prayer
[1:19:28] let me just say this to you but we're
[1:19:29] looking for a new city
[1:19:32] and that's the scriptures that we bear
[1:19:34] in mind whose builder and maker is god
[1:19:41] watch what he says he said and i i saw a
[1:19:43] new heaven and a new earth
[1:19:45] for the first heaven and the first earth
[1:19:47] were passed away and there was no more
[1:19:48] sea
[1:19:50] and i john saw the holy city in the new
[1:19:53] jerusalem coming down from god
[1:19:55] out of heaven
[1:19:56] can you imagine that scene that he was
[1:19:58] watching
[1:20:00] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[1:20:03] husband
[1:20:05] and i heard a great voice out of heaven
[1:20:07] saying behold the tabernacle of god is
[1:20:10] with men and he will dwell with them and
[1:20:13] they shall be his people and
[1:20:15] god himself shall be with them and be
[1:20:18] their god
[1:20:20] and god shall wipe away all tears from
[1:20:22] their eyes and there shall be no more
[1:20:24] death think about these things
[1:20:27] we're coming to a time where death will
[1:20:29] not have a grip of humanity anymore
[1:20:34] neither sorrow
[1:20:37] nor crying
[1:20:40] there shall be
[1:20:42] there shall and neither shall there be
[1:20:45] any more pain
[1:20:48] for the former things are passed away
[1:20:53] and he that sat upon the throne said
[1:20:56] behold
[1:20:58] i make all things new
[1:21:00] i want you to understand this is not a
[1:21:02] president this is not a dictator of
[1:21:05] russia this is god
[1:21:08] this is the god that spend the earth
[1:21:12] and the 70 universes that we even know
[1:21:14] about god's first bible in the heavens
[1:21:17] it's that god
[1:21:20] that said i make all things
[1:21:26] new we get excited about a 42-inch
[1:21:30] caribou
[1:21:31] or a a bare silver-tipped grizzly bear
[1:21:34] before they got back down off of the
[1:21:36] mountain because that was a vision
[1:21:40] prophesied and now takes place
[1:21:43] and they're walking in the vision
[1:21:45] but if we can look at it
[1:21:47] you step from the pre-planning of god
[1:21:54] are you with me now
[1:21:57] you step from the pre-planning of god
[1:21:59] and regardless of what you've been
[1:22:01] through in your life
[1:22:09] they said you've went through some real
[1:22:10] difficult things and i just said at the
[1:22:12] end of my table the other day when you
[1:22:14] call me about you and melissa are
[1:22:16] getting married
[1:22:18] and
[1:22:19] thank you for inviting me to be a part
[1:22:21] of that brother andrew will do that for
[1:22:23] you but i thought i just i just kind of
[1:22:25] ride back at the chair and i said
[1:22:28] satan you can't stop god see
[1:22:33] you say well brother on my life's been
[1:22:35] marred it's been defeated over and over
[1:22:37] again don't you know this that god will
[1:22:40] not lose a one
[1:22:50] hallelujah he's not in the business to
[1:22:53] lose
[1:22:56] if he saw you before the foundational
[1:22:59] world
[1:23:00] and you are an attribute in his mind
[1:23:03] regardless of what you have been through
[1:23:05] in this earthly time period
[1:23:08] [Applause]
[1:23:11] this earthly time period doesn't change
[1:23:13] the mind of god
[1:23:16] you say brother on i don't know how in
[1:23:17] the world i'll make it through if he saw
[1:23:20] you before the foundation and he saw you
[1:23:22] in that new city there's not a devil in
[1:23:25] hell
[1:23:30] hallelujah
[1:23:31] there's not a devil in hell can't stop
[1:23:34] the plan of god
[1:23:42] glory be to god
[1:24:01] i like how he says it
[1:24:03] these words are true
[1:24:06] and faithful
[1:24:11] and he said unto me it is done
[1:24:14] i am alpha and omega
[1:24:17] the beginning in the end
[1:24:19] and i will give unto him that is a
[1:24:21] thirst a fountain of water of life
[1:24:24] freely
[1:24:27] you didn't do nothing to earn it
[1:24:32] hallelujah
[1:24:35] hallelujah there's people that's brains
[1:24:38] from their waist up
[1:24:42] they got degrees all over their walls
[1:24:45] there's ac there's people that are are
[1:24:47] way more handsome than i am
[1:24:50] maybe way more scholarly maybe greater
[1:24:53] speakers than i am but god deposited a
[1:24:56] seed on the inside of you
[1:25:00] and he watched over that seed all the
[1:25:02] way since adam
[1:25:04] and if god could watch over the
[1:25:06] pre-planning of that natural seed being
[1:25:09] carried through every generation
[1:25:12] [Applause]
[1:25:17] don't you have a weak god that can't get
[1:25:19] you from today till tomorrow
[1:25:22] i've got a god that can carry me from
[1:25:24] here to eternity
[1:25:32] let me just say it like it is stupid
[1:25:34] cancer can't stop the plan of god
[1:25:56] paul is writing now and he's writing to
[1:25:59] this church
[1:26:00] he's writing to every church brother
[1:26:02] branham said every one of them
[1:26:05] every one of the believers
[1:26:07] went down in faith
[1:26:09] looking for the rapture
[1:26:13] they were not defeated by death
[1:26:15] but they went down some of them were
[1:26:18] burnt
[1:26:19] some of them were heads were cut off
[1:26:21] some of them were slain asunder
[1:26:25] some of them have died some incredibly
[1:26:26] cruel deaths
[1:26:28] i think about the believers there's a
[1:26:31] church of in afghanistan of believers
[1:26:33] message believers that were that were
[1:26:36] destroyed
[1:26:39] by no hold himself he'll be held
[1:26:41] accountable of that
[1:26:44] but they were given testimony as
[1:26:48] the bullets were ringing out that god
[1:26:50] was faithful to them
[1:26:55] don't worry
[1:26:57] don't feel sorry
[1:26:58] they stepped from this dimension to that
[1:27:00] dimension
[1:27:01] and that stupid devil that pulled that
[1:27:03] trigger didn't know what he was doing
[1:27:07] he was releasing them
[1:27:09] from that tyranny of pressure and
[1:27:11] tormentors and they stepped into another
[1:27:13] dimension
[1:27:18] one of our brothers that was in prison
[1:27:22] came out of prison two weeks ago
[1:27:25] and i got pictures this week
[1:27:27] of he's already baptized three
[1:27:32] you can't stop this
[1:27:48] revelation 21 verse 7 i missed something
[1:27:50] i want to catch it
[1:27:52] he that overcometh
[1:27:54] shall inherit all
[1:27:58] things i will be his god
[1:28:02] and he will be my son
[1:28:04] amen
[1:28:07] but the fearful
[1:28:10] and the unbelieving
[1:28:13] and the abominable
[1:28:15] and the murders god is a pre-planner
[1:28:24] and the whoremongers
[1:28:26] and the
[1:28:27] sorcerers
[1:28:29] and idolatrous
[1:28:31] and liars
[1:28:33] shall have their part
[1:28:36] in the lake of fire
[1:28:39] now people don't want to hear about hell
[1:28:42] but jesus talked more about hell than he
[1:28:45] talked about heaven
[1:28:47] and the reason he did that was to try to
[1:28:49] keep you from going there
[1:28:53] and you will have to step across the
[1:28:55] blood of jesus christ
[1:29:03] to go to that place
[1:29:08] don't worry god don't send you there
[1:29:10] you send yourself
[1:29:14] don't worry
[1:29:15] god don't send you to hell
[1:29:18] you send yourself there
[1:29:21] there's a scripture says that touch not
[1:29:23] my anointed do my prophets no harm
[1:29:26] that's what it that that's what it says
[1:29:29] so
[1:29:31] men can live a life 50 70 90 years
[1:29:36] and in five minutes
[1:29:39] make a superior bad choice
[1:29:43] by speaking against the wrong thing
[1:29:47] if they could have just left it alone
[1:29:51] but they were driven to fulfill
[1:29:54] those going to the lake of fire
[1:30:01] i can't give you the positive without
[1:30:02] giving you the negative
[1:30:06] judas had a place in the scriptures
[1:30:11] are you with me now
[1:30:12] judas actually had a place in the
[1:30:14] scriptures
[1:30:16] he was pre-planned in the scriptures he
[1:30:18] had a place
[1:30:21] notice but he couldn't even live with
[1:30:23] his consequences of his choice
[1:30:27] i'm going to preach to you tonight
[1:30:32] i'm afraid there's way too many maybe
[1:30:34] you're watching this today there's way
[1:30:37] too many that has made choices against
[1:30:40] the messenger of this hour
[1:30:45] [Applause]
[1:30:48] and made very cruel statements against
[1:30:51] what did brother branham do to you
[1:30:57] what did these pastors do to you we're
[1:30:59] just trying to get people to not go to
[1:31:01] hell
[1:31:06] to live a citizen of the kingdom of god
[1:31:10] just be real christians
[1:31:14] but instead pick out thoughts and
[1:31:16] failures
[1:31:22] brother brother ron i'm an official
[1:31:24] critic
[1:31:26] won't that be a tag in hell
[1:31:32] won't that be something in hell
[1:31:35] to be the official critic of the message
[1:31:37] of the hour
[1:31:53] oh but brother ron he missed it on this
[1:31:55] and he missed it on that
[1:31:58] okay
[1:32:00] i don't even know why i'm here but here
[1:32:01] i am
[1:32:03] okay
[1:32:04] okay
[1:32:06] how many souls have you won
[1:32:12] how many cancers have you seen fall off
[1:32:14] with your prayer
[1:32:17] how many blind eyes
[1:32:19] how many people night after night for
[1:32:22] more than 40 years
[1:32:26] and never miss one time
[1:32:34] i'll tell you that's the same spirit
[1:32:36] that was standing there against noah
[1:32:40] don't you feel sorry for those people
[1:32:43] don't you back off and say well i feel
[1:32:45] sorry for those people they're headed
[1:32:47] for
[1:32:52] hell come on i'm not going to make it
[1:32:55] easy on them
[1:32:57] come on don't look for mercy from me
[1:33:00] you crucified my lord
[1:33:02] [Applause]
[1:33:04] you crucified this
[1:33:06] message you crucified the former pastor
[1:33:10] here
[1:33:11] and myself as well
[1:33:15] don't expect mercy from
[1:33:20] me because the pre-planning is here
[1:33:24] i'm preaching this sermon to you
[1:33:27] if i were you
[1:33:30] i wouldn't get mad at ron spencer i'd
[1:33:32] get on my knees
[1:33:39] i'd get on my knees
[1:33:41] and i'd start praying god forgive me

[1:34:19] instructions to go there so i went there
[1:34:28] i don't know about those instructions

[1:36:09] take any
[1:36:10] vitamins
[1:36:12] or any supplements
[1:36:14] and i just purchased two bottles they
[1:36:16] were quite quite expensive bottles and i
[1:36:18] just had purchased two bottles
[1:36:20] and i
[1:36:21] and i looked at it and i said
[1:36:24] i don't need this anymore
[1:36:26] and i thought about throwing them in the
[1:36:28] trash
[1:36:35] now you think about the odds of this
[1:36:41] and the lord spoke to me
[1:36:43] and said
[1:36:45] shannon would take those
[1:36:47] hallelujah
[1:36:48] so after service i called shannon over
[1:36:51] and i said brother shannon and i i don't
[1:36:53] know even how to say this
[1:36:55] but i was going to throw these things
[1:36:56] away
[1:36:58] and he told me that you could use those
[1:37:01] and he just kind of looked at me funny
[1:37:04] and he said i was going to order them
[1:37:05] today
[1:37:09] in that rain
[1:37:13] the other day he called me about a job
[1:37:15] situation
[1:37:17] and he was in the midst of telling me
[1:37:19] and i said wait a minute let me tell you
[1:37:20] what you're getting ready to do
[1:37:25] i said i was sitting i was bidding

[1:37:46] they were sitting with me and and i i
[1:37:48] actually bought a circle of those things
[1:37:50] but
[1:37:51] there was one i really wasn't interested
[1:37:53] in it and when i passed it by the lord
[1:37:55] said
[1:37:56] shannon's going to be a conductor
[1:37:59] hallelujah

[1:40:11] truth of god
[1:40:13] this message will produce a rapture it
[1:40:16] will produce a resurrection
[1:40:30] hallelujah
[1:40:37] i'm no great man for you to look at but
[1:40:39] i serve a great big god

[1:40:45] he is a he's an unlimited god
[1:40:48] and all things are possible
[1:40:50] [Applause]
[1:41:08] that's a pretty good starter in there
[1:41:15] now paul is saying
[1:41:17] if he could stand here and preach
[1:41:19] let's just let paul preach here just for
[1:41:21] a minute
[1:41:25] i would not have you to be ignorant
[1:41:27] brethren
[1:41:30] concerning them which are asleep
[1:41:32] this encompasses
[1:41:36] all that's in the ocean
[1:41:40] all that's in the sea
[1:41:42] all that's in the grave
[1:41:44] all that's been burned at the stake
[1:41:49] not just your mom and your daddy and all
[1:41:51] of the others that you so temporarily
[1:41:54] know but hundreds and thousands of years
[1:41:59] god's made a covenant with them
[1:42:04] hallelujah
[1:42:06] brother ron do you believe he'll do it
[1:42:08] again i got news for you abraham isaac
[1:42:10] and jacob walked and took a little
[1:42:13] whistle stop in jerusalem when jesus
[1:42:16] came back leading captivity captive
[1:42:21] and even unbelievers saw them in the
[1:42:24] street and had to testify
[1:42:28] hallelujah
[1:42:31] come on church
[1:42:33] the same melchizedek
[1:42:35] now was jesus
[1:42:38] that abraham had been sitting there
[1:42:40] looking into his eyes and now he's
[1:42:42] following out of that abraham's bosom
[1:42:46] and he's walking out of that grave
[1:42:49] one day our mamas and daddies are going
[1:42:51] to step out of that grave and brother
[1:42:53] homer's going to step from that
[1:42:54] dimension because god said so
[1:42:59] not cause i said so god said so
[1:43:14] so what is cancer
[1:43:17] so what is cancer
[1:43:19] that's nothing to fear
[1:43:26] brother branham was in
[1:43:27] in the cave with the angel of the lord
[1:43:29] they were having a conversation
[1:43:36] brother random was actually the one that
[1:43:37] brought it up to the angel
[1:43:39] and he said not even cancer
[1:43:44] so the angel didn't even think that
[1:43:45] cancer was
[1:43:47] even worth talking about
[1:43:51] but being cancer was the
[1:43:53] demon of this age
[1:43:55] the messenger brought it up
[1:43:58] and the angel said not even cancer
[1:44:06] i've got some of the greatest
[1:44:07] oncologists that you can have
[1:44:11] and they see no hope
[1:44:14] but they always say but you're god
[1:44:17] don't they sister connie but you're god
[1:44:21] you're in the one percent category your
[1:44:24] god
[1:44:27] let me just echo that across this
[1:44:29] audience tonight you may be told some of
[1:44:31] the worst things tomorrow morning or
[1:44:34] next week in a hospital room
[1:44:40] but your god
[1:44:42] [Music]
[1:44:46] brother harold
[1:44:47] satan would have destroyed you a long
[1:44:49] time ago
[1:44:51] but he didn't have enough
[1:44:58] he didn't have enough
[1:45:03] he would have destroyed many of you a
[1:45:05] long time ago but he
[1:45:07] he would have if he could have
[1:45:12] but it didn't have enough
[1:45:15] they gave me four months because the
[1:45:17] enemy came in with his sword to destroy
[1:45:20] my life but he didn't have enough
[1:45:32] now satan if you're here and you're
[1:45:33] standing on this platform i want you to
[1:45:35] just remember over the last year and a
[1:45:37] half of how many miracles have happened
[1:45:40] [Applause]
[1:45:46] i want you to just think about how many
[1:45:48] miracles have happened
[1:45:51] because god said i'll use you like never
[1:45:54] before and you did everything you can to
[1:45:57] stop
[1:45:59] the ministry of the bride
[1:46:03] but you can't stop it
[1:46:06] [Applause]

[1:46:27] you've tried
[1:46:28] you've lied you've cheated you've tried
[1:46:31] to destroy
[1:46:33] but this word will destroy you
[1:46:59] beloved jude 1 3
[1:47:02] beloved when i gave you all diligence to
[1:47:04] write unto you
[1:47:06] of the common salvation
[1:47:08] it was needful for me to write unto you
[1:47:10] and exhort you
[1:47:12] that you should
[1:47:14] earnestly
[1:47:17] contend for the faith
[1:47:19] which was once delivered unto the saints
[1:47:24] we are not a dainty
[1:47:27] wish-washy
[1:47:29] spineless
[1:47:37] we are a powerful army
[1:47:40] [Applause]
[1:47:41] more powerful than the archangels that's
[1:47:43] in heaven
[1:47:47] i'm not talking about ministry now i'm
[1:47:49] talking about every believer sitting in
[1:47:51] this building
[1:47:52] why don't you just point your at your
[1:47:54] chest right now
[1:47:55] that seed that god deposited has got
[1:47:58] power to speak a world on the outside of
[1:48:00] it
[1:48:02] it's deity himself living on the inside
[1:48:05] of you
[1:48:06] so don't talk negativity talk positive
[1:48:11] take god in his word
[1:48:19] hey

[1:48:48] he intentionally the writer
[1:48:50] intentionally
[1:48:52] left cain out
[1:49:01] oh but that's just one place in the
[1:49:02] scriptures okay
[1:49:04] in your entire old testament
[1:49:11] in the entire old testament it never
[1:49:13] mentions
[1:49:15] janice and james's by name
[1:49:22] never mentions them by name
[1:49:26] but over here in the new testament
[1:49:29] when god is riding
[1:49:34] he remembered them
[1:49:38] he remembered them
[1:49:40] you say well brother ron but it you know
[1:49:41] i can say anything against the message
[1:49:45] i may forget it
[1:49:49] but god will remember

[1:51:02] working for ashes
[1:51:08] but what do you do for jesus
[1:51:19] there was a man that wrote a letter to
[1:51:21] his grandchildren
[1:51:24] and this was a kernel
[1:51:26] but it makes a good statement
[1:51:30] he said when i get there i'm a carpenter
[1:51:32] here on earth but when i get there i'm
[1:51:33] going to help the lord build your houses
[1:51:36] try to send up enough material
[1:51:45] to build your houses
[1:51:53] i want to speak to you about being
[1:51:54] driven
[1:51:56] so many people are driven in the wrong
[1:51:57] directions
[1:52:02] we live in an age where everybody's con
[1:52:04] confused
[1:52:06] because they watch so much media
[1:52:12] every outlet everything

[1:52:18] much time
[1:52:20] reading the scriptures
[1:52:22] if you'd have taken as much time reading

[1:52:33] like it or not
[1:52:35] you will not get yourself in rapturing
[1:52:38] condition

[1:53:11] that is one of the greatest buttons on
[1:53:13] your phone
[1:53:18] if you have not found it yet
[1:53:20] block
[1:53:22] is the greatest
[1:53:30] i'm gonna give you a piece of my mind
[1:53:45] andrew you can clean all this up
[1:53:46] tomorrow

[1:54:00] with me
[1:54:10] the doctor told me the other day said
[1:54:11] you're gonna have to start taking some
[1:54:12] more time off
[1:54:15] you know in some cases i'm gonna protect
[1:54:17] her afterwards
[1:54:18] don't y'all get mad but i'm gonna take
[1:54:20] them but their words
[1:54:24] satan's going to be happy too
[1:54:31] don't get scared i'm 60 years old now
[1:54:33] and
[1:54:35] take care of old people
[1:54:38] i've been getting senior coffee for a
[1:54:40] long time just
[1:54:43] i've been doing that for a long time
[1:54:45] i've walked in way too many airports and
[1:54:48] people look across the counter and say
[1:54:49] do you enjoy traveling with your daddy
[1:54:58] trophy wife whatever
[1:55:00] i've heard it all
[1:55:02] but if i look this bad i might as well
[1:55:04] get the free coffee
[1:55:09] [Applause]
[1:55:13] what'd you go that way for brother ron
[1:55:15] because some of you getting too tense i
[1:55:17] need to relax you for a few minutes
[1:55:22] now remember
[1:55:25] remember
[1:55:27] enoch preached for over 300 years
[1:55:32] he prophesied for over 300 years
[1:55:36] while he was doing that he wrote god's
[1:55:39] bible
[1:55:41] in a pyramid
[1:55:44] and it was perfect actually the angles
[1:55:46] they cannot they actually say it's alien
[1:55:49] and and i have to agree with them
[1:55:54] they said alien activity
[1:55:56] helped create that pyramid well they
[1:55:58] were right they're right they're not
[1:56:00] always wrong
[1:56:02] because the god of our world
[1:56:05] helped enoch
[1:56:07] put that exactly right
[1:56:11] because no man could do it like that
[1:56:15] and the alien of this world our god
[1:56:18] helped him write the bible
[1:56:21] now here's where i want to go with this
[1:56:24] you're living in the most wicked age
[1:56:31] sodom is everywhere
[1:56:34] it's at walmart i don't go
[1:56:38] it's a target i don't go
[1:56:41] it's at amazon
[1:56:56] it's everywhere
[1:56:58] sodom's everywhere
[1:57:01] and if you're paying any attention to
[1:57:02] the news sodom is making the news every
[1:57:05] day
[1:57:10] and you hear all the fuss about
[1:57:12] abortions it's still murder
[1:57:26] and let me just let me just background
[1:57:29] here just for a minute all this fuss
[1:57:30] about afghanistan all that is is bullies
[1:57:34] taking over the opium
[1:57:36] fields so who is in control of the drugs
[1:57:44] ain't nothing else there
[1:57:50] are you with me see every kingdom is run
[1:57:53] by the devil
[1:57:57] it's run by the devil
[1:57:59] and even the fuss over the abortion
[1:58:00] issue if you really look into it deep
[1:58:03] enough it's about organs being big
[1:58:05] enough to where they can harvest them
[1:58:09] and it's millions of dollars that is at
[1:58:12] stake
[1:58:13] if they can't wait till a later
[1:58:15] trimester it's still myrrh
[1:58:22] come on
[1:58:23] it's still murder
[1:58:25] and i'm making the case right now why
[1:58:28] america can be destroyed
[1:58:31] [Applause]
[1:58:32] and i stand as a gospel preacher of this
[1:58:34] message and saying god is a righteous
[1:58:37] god and the cup of iniquity has ran over
[1:58:41] out of the cup and it's random off of
[1:58:44] the table and it's running in the floor
[1:58:48] i say even so come lord jesus
[1:59:10] well let me just stir the dimple just a
[1:59:12] little bit longer
[1:59:13] [Applause]
[1:59:16] i heard that old song song
[1:59:20] since i was a little child
[1:59:22] just a little longer please jesus
[1:59:26] why don't you get your writing self born
[1:59:28] again
[1:59:31] get born again and give your life to
[1:59:33] jesus christ
[1:59:36] sin will only take you to hell
[1:59:42] come on no man or woman or boy or girl
[1:59:44] is going to be without excuse
[1:59:47] this message has went throughout the
[1:59:49] whole world
[1:59:59] well is that enough is that enough of
[2:00:01] the negativity is that enough of that
[2:00:03] do you mind if i preach positive here
[2:00:05] just for a little bit
[2:00:07] in her day
[2:00:09] fanny crosby though she was blind
[2:00:15] though she'd been blind since a child
[2:00:18] though she was blind she could have sold
[2:00:21] being a pulper couldn't hardly afford
[2:00:23] her own apartment
[2:00:25] could have sold her gift
[2:00:29] to the world
[2:00:32] and could have written the national
[2:00:34] anthem of the united states of america
[2:00:36] or or the south she could have written
[2:00:39] all of those phenomenal songs but
[2:00:42] refused to write them that she could be
[2:00:45] an overcomer in her age
[2:00:48] susannah wesley
[2:00:51] that had three houses burned down
[2:00:53] 19 children were born from her womb only
[2:00:56] about six or seven of them would survive
[2:01:00] but yet she would pray three hours a day
[2:01:03] from her womb
[2:01:05] would come john which would be a
[2:01:08] messenger of the hour and charles that
[2:01:10] would be the song leader that would
[2:01:12] write thousands of songs
[2:01:16] she lived in horrible conditions
[2:01:22] but if she didn't have enough to do she
[2:01:25] wrote john's commentaries
[2:01:28] and diaries to where that
[2:01:31] literally millions could still read them
[2:01:34] today
[2:01:36] she don't talk about her deplorable

[2:02:21] preach
[2:02:22] newspaper articles people would come and
[2:02:25] to write about him
[2:02:27] they would say what draws people to you
[2:02:29] he said they didn't come to see me they
[2:02:31] come to see jesus
[2:02:34] brother branham said he preached
[2:02:35] conviction so powerful
[2:02:38] the anointing of god
[2:02:40] would flow from the pulpit and men going

[2:03:06] released from his hand
[2:03:08] to fulfill
[2:03:10] the word of the hour
[2:03:12] now watch this he wouldn't release

[2:03:37] always been driven to destroy the seed
[2:03:41] help me now
[2:03:43] he's always been driven it was in egypt
[2:03:46] he was driven to destroy moses
[2:03:49] it was with jesus he was driven
[2:03:52] and destroyed a generation to get a hold
[2:03:55] of jesus
[2:03:57] he's been driven to try to destroy you
[2:04:00] but god knew that that was going to
[2:04:02] happen
[2:04:03] and so he put something on you that
[2:04:05] would raise the standard against that
[2:04:08] devil
[2:04:21] chris you had to be born a certain day a
[2:04:24] certain hour with certain parents
[2:04:29] you were born to fulfill the purpose
[2:04:33] of more than setting a seat
[2:04:38] more than coming to church
[2:04:40] but that this message
[2:04:43] that's not going to rapture taper
[2:04:45] corners
[2:04:46] he's not going to rapture your books and
[2:04:48] your pictures
[2:04:50] he's not going to take he's not even

[2:05:29] best wine
[2:05:31] in the entire city
[2:05:36] he took a leper
[2:05:38] and he didn't have to pray all night
[2:05:40] he was greater than that leprosy
[2:05:44] when he came to your life he was a lot
[2:05:45] of different things
[2:05:47] it didn't take him 10 years to fix you

[2:06:14] his life was in turmoil
[2:06:18] he'd been a phenomenal ball player
[2:06:22] but that has an end
[2:06:25] if he went to the nfl it would have had
[2:06:27] an end and he had offers
