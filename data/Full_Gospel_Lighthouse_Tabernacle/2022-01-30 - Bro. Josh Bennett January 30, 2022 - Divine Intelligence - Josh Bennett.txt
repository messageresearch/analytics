tell you we are who we are by the grace of god amen it's so good to be here with you again this morning and just counted such an honor to be here and it is good to have my wife and i do i do believe that i think it would took longer than 20 minutes but i guess it could have been a good start she could tell some things but we're not going to allow that the lord has truly blessed me and 23 years and and they've been great and um she looks like she's 23 years old so but i i do appreciate uh the wife that god gave me and and i appreciate the the uh folks that come from the church appreciate them being here and uh with us this weekend just appreciate brother ron i want to say again and sister connie or andrew brother matthew all all of you just for your hospitality and i just feel at home i like to come into a church and hear an amen ring out i like to come in a church where people ain't ashamed to praise god and just let loose and say hallelujah and you know i i believe that god god enjoys that as well so you know i believe when we praise god it just as the praises go up the blessings begin to come down amen i believe that with all my heart so let's just bow our heads this morning as we look to him if you have a knee just lift it up before him heavenly father we just want to thank you lord we thank you for this this day that you've given us and lord we are gathered here today the first day of the week and here we are this morning in the honor of your resurrection we're so thankful lord to be gathered together with believers of like precious faith and and lord we're we're here today lord because you have you have called us you you have lord we're not here by our own choosing but you have chosen us and lord we've come here lord we we've come to see you and lord the only way that we'd be able to see you god is lord you've got to you've got to come and lord you've got to speak lord you've got to be active in this service and so god we're inviting you and lord we're just letting you know god that lord we're surrendering ourself in your hands and lord we want you to have preeminence lord we want to just step aside now and allow you to speak you you know the needs of the people lord i don't know their needs but you know all things and god i pray lord that you would just walk up and down the avenues of every heart here today and lord just discern the needs of the lives and i pray god that you would speak lord directly to those needs and lord we've got great confidence in your word we know god that your word shall not return unto you void but it shall accomplish the thing you've sent it to do and therefore god if your word would be preached here today lord it would not be in vain it could not be in vain but lord even while the word is being preached i believe that the sick can be healed lives can be changed lord the oppressed can be delivered lord i believe that with all my heart that's the confidence i have in your word i have no confidence in myself lord i'm not leaning on my on my own understanding or any arm of flesh but lord we're looking unto jesus who is the author and the finisher of our faith lord jesus we just pray that you'd have your way among us now as we commit ourselves into your hands in this service for your glory in jesus name amen amen if you take your bibles we'll turn to the book of romans in the 11th chapter of romans just pray for me and bear with me i'm a little bit um hoarse i been uh i'd had a little um sinus infection and so the been kind of struggling my voice and so uh somebody said well just call brother ron you know just tell him that you've been i said are you kidding me call brother ron and say man i gotta my voice is a little weak maybe i shouldn't preach i said yeah i can hear how that would go he said you big so we're just going to press on romans 11 verse 33 all the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been his counselor or who had first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen may god add his blessing to the reading of the word you can have your seats this morning thank you brother i'd like to just speak to you for a few minutes on the divine intelligence branham said it this way there in 1958 and the message wire we are not a denomination he said when i look at a tree he said i've been in the woods for a couple of three about two months now and he said i see the tree how pretty it is he said i as it goes down another one comes up in his place his perpetual life now think of that and somewhere that tree had a beginning it had to have a beginning and the only way it could be designated to be a tree or to be an oak or a beach or a popular or whatever it was it had there had to be a master intelligence behind it or just one been an oak tree and everything in the world would have been an oak tree seed but there was something some great master intelligence that had to set it in order he said blessed be his holy name he's the one who set the moon and the stars in the solar system he set everything in his order and he'll set the church in his order there in the church age book the prophet said let me inject a thought in here he said even our natural birth is based on election he said the female ovaries may produce many eggs but why is it that at a certain time a certain egg comes down and not another one see and then amongst the male sperm for no known reason a certain germ attaches itself to the to the egg while others could have just as easily attached themselves or had a better opportunity to do so and did not in paris see there's an intelligence behind all this otherwise what determines whether a baby is a boy or a girl or blonde or brunette or has a light or dark type of eye see and the prophet is saying there's an intelligence behind that and and and you know i know that goes against the uh the modern thinking of today and you know they they they believe that you make your own decision whether you're going to be a boy or a girl but uh i i believe that decision has already been made amen i believe that god made that decision and and and so the prophet is saying even our natural birth is based upon election and he's showing that all this should be telling you you're not here by chance you are not here amen by chance neither are you simply here because you chose to be here but there is something that has brought you here there's an intelligence behind it all and and so i i like how brother branham would say that there's an intelligence behind it all and then another place a master intelligence that's behind it and in in revelation is the fourth chapter uh the bible speaks of the four beasts and the or we will call them the four living creatures and we know that they were full of eyes before and behind and then the bible says they had eyes within and brother branham also picks that up and said it spoke of their intelligence he said see they had eyes in the front they had eyes in the back he said and they had eyes within he said therefore they could see what had been they could see what is now and they could see what will be and and he said it was speaking of their intelligence and we know that those four living creatures would represent the the the anointing of god that would be uh released through the seven church ages all seven church ages would have an anointing that that would would anoint the church to combat the enemy and the age that they lived amen and so those four living creatures were representing those anointed that anointing that would be would come upon the church i don't want to get too deep into that but but we know that in them having these eyes before and behind and within it showed that they knew what had been what is and what would come brother around said reflecting jesus christ the same yesterday amen today and forever throughout all the ages him that was which is and is to come is that right amen and we know that there is only one intelligence amen that knows the beginning from the end amen there's only one intelligence that can speak things amen that is going to happen in the future before they happen only god can do that do you believe that that's why the bible says in isaiah 42 and verse say i am the lord that is my name and my glory will i not give to another neither my praise to graven images behold the former things are come to pass and new things do i declare before they spring forth i tell you of them amen i love that because god can tell you about new things in other words god can tell you the future before it gets here is that right isaiah 46 and 9 remember the former things of old for i am god and there is none else i am god and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and i will do all my pleasure amen so god is is letting you know amen i know the future amen and i can tell you the future amen before it comes amen i tell you i'm glad that we're serving that kind of god amen because amen nothing ever catches him by surprise amen because he knows all things do you believe that now brother brown said in the easter seal he said do you he said remember this you and the stature that you are in this morning if you wasn't in his thinking then you're not now see see for you there's some part that's in you that's eternal and the eternal only belongs to god and in in god was his thinking of you sitting right where you are now see in his thinking i stood at the pulpit this morning because he's infinite and he knows all things and therefore he could tell the end from the beginning because he's eternal and then you being a son or daughter of god then you were in his thinking at the beginning i love how the prophet is saying god god saw you in the very seat that you're sitting in this morning before you got here even god knew you were going to be here he knew where you're going to be sitting at god knew i was going to be standing and preaching amen behind the pulpit and because he knew who was going to be here he meant he could he could deal with me amen in advance amen and the things that would be spoken even to meet the need that you have even not because i know but because he knows amen and there's a need amen there's something in you that's calling out for some brother brown things that are to be he said it's like a mother expecting a child he said and while she's expecting even that life that's in her begins to call out and she'll send the husband amen on a you know on a mission to go down and and get you know the pickles and ice cream or whatever kind of crazy thing that you know it is but there's something in her that's craving something is calling out for something and the prophet of god said amen and there's something in you amen the calling and god will send somebody to the pulpit hallelujah amen and god has already dealt with that man amen and laid things on his heart amen why amen because you have a need there's something in you calling out for it hallelujah church i want you to understand something there's a reason amen why god's got some god called men in this hour that'll preach this message that ain't ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ there's a reason amen that there's still some men amen that'll preach the truth i'll tell you that reason you're the reason hallelujah amen because there's somebody amen that needs to receive that word [Applause] hallelujah and god know the end from the beginning and therefore he could plan everything amen that it would work out just to his glory and all that gives us courage don't that give you courage to know that no matter what comes or what goes god is making everything the clock is ticking just exactly on time see sometimes we get weary we get upset we get hasty amen we think we must do this we must do that but remember god's clock will be just exactly on time and all these things has to be this way it has to be all done according to his great knowledge his foreknowledge amen god's knowledge is for knowledge in other words what's for now it's knowledge beforehand amen god has an expectation now this is the prophecy god has an expectation he knows what's going to happen amen how many has ever heard it preached and i know you've heard it preached you got to come with an expectation you'll get what you're expecting even when you come to the house of god you come with expectation amen amen and it's important that you have an expectation because god will meet your expectation but now the problem says god's got an expectation amen and god's expectation amen amen he already knows what's going to happen amen he knew you were going to be here amen and he knew exactly what was going to take place he says see because he's infinite he can foretell the end from the beginning because he's god and don't you think that satan's putting anything over on him oh no it's just all working out to display his attributes see this all he meant how could the great infinite god who knows everything see it's just the attributes of god being displayed so now the prophet saying satan is not putting something over on god i like to i've told my church this many times god is not up in heaven this morning chewing on his fingernails in a nervous condition he's not looking down at the world and thinking man that what a mess and it's all falling apart and and god and satan's taking control and god god ain't nervous about it amen he knew it would be this way as a matter of fact he wrote he he it's in this bible amen in kind in end time conditions was wrote in this bible thousands of years ago god already knew it would be this way and satan ain't getting nothing over on god god is only allowing amen things to take place amen to show how great his power is hallelujah church we're living in satan's eden how many believes that this is satan's eden this is the most wicked age that there's ever been sin is on the rampage amen look at the the rise of homosexuality you're living in sodom amen and this world ain't getting no better come on church amen it ain't going to get no better amen but i got good news amen amen as basically as it is and as dark as it gets god's still got a bride [Applause] hallelujah and god has allowed this world to get in this condition to prove to satan that no matter how dark it gets no matter how bad it gets amen no matter oh come on church amen i got a people amen that's gonna stand hallelujah i've got a bride that's gonna overcome and you are going to overcome the enemy in his own eden church you are a people like no other people because you're going to defeat satan in his own kingdom hallelujah in the very pinnacle of sainzin amen god has got overcomers hallelujah now watch god knowed all things brother brown said therefore he could plan he's never been taken by surprise and so he said the great un unchanging god cannot change man changes see but you can put your life upon anything that god said about said at any time because it's the truth because it's the only thing i have confidence in the prophet says the bible because man's word will fail but god is supreme see this year i know more than i did last year and you should too each day because we're finite so we gain knowledge amen we we you know we we learn from our mistakes or we should some of us better than other others but you know you know we we're continuing to to better ourselves and learn from ours and gain knowledge but the prophet said that god being infinite he is not gaining knowledge he is perfect to begin with amen therefore every decision he makes is perfect amen i want to tell you god don't have no backup plans hallelujah he don't need any even because when god makes a plan amen he's going to fulfill it amen he don't need a backup you are not a backup you know sometimes some people look and they see as a scripture would say that jesus came to his own his own received him not we know he was rejected by his own people is that right and then the in the gospel goes to the gentiles but let me tell you that the gentiles was not a backup plan amen god did not turn to the gentiles because the jews rejected him come on church amen he didn't come to the jews and said well that didn't work out i'll just go over here to the gentiles no before he ever come he already blinded their eyes because he had determined in himself i'm gonna have a gentile bride hallelujah you're not a backup plan you're a part of the original plan hallelujah and when god made a decision about you before the foundation of the world that decision was perfect he'll never change his mind some of y'all ought to shout about it amen because god even made a decision about you before the foundation of the world and some of it sometimes we think well you know but but you know look at all the mistakes how you don't think he knew that talking about a god that knows all things amen he he knew every mistake you would make he knew the mess you would make out of it amen he saw that amen but he made his decision amen before the foundation of the world because he could see past that hallelujah and he knew you're a part of him to begin with now watch [Music] see because we don't know the future we we tend to look to the past how many knows that that that men actually are able to predict the future i would say use the word predict they can predict future events by studying the past because history repeats itself and and men dedicate their their lives to you know they study the patterns and and these things and they're able to by that knowledge they study the past amen in other words to to gain a knowledge that they may predict future events by past events and and they do it in the you know in the military they do it in the government all aspects of life men st they do that to they study weather patterns and everything else amen that they might predict the future amen because and they're always looking to the past because but god don't have to do that amen and god is not predicting the future amen he is prophesying he is amen he is actually telling you in accurate detail what's going to happen hallelujah amen and i'll tell you this amen god does not just simply amen say you know a a a when a prophet speaks a word of prophecy it's not simply amen i know he's seeing it by vision a future event but he is not just see simply seeing the future and telling you what it's going to be he is actually speaking the word of god amen amen and when that prophecy goes forth that word amen can actually cause even that event to take place so in other words let me say this a word of prophecy amen can not only uh predict the future it can change the future [Music] and so the bible's not a history book because god you know there's a lot of history books there's a lot of history in the bible but the bible's not a a history book the bible is a book of prophecy is that right amen because you see a lot of men have wrote history books but they have to all they can only write about what has been even they cannot write about what will be amen but this bible the prophet said it this way he said let me tell you something let's just go in the history of the bible just a minute and see where it come from it was written by 40 different writers 40 men who wrote the bible over the space of 1600 years apart at different times predicting the most important events that would ever happen in the world's history and many times hundreds of years before it happened and there's not one error in the entire 66 books no author but god himself could be so accurate hallelujah not one word contradicts the other amen wrote over a span of 1600 years 40 different scribes writing the bible amen and when they compounded all together all their prophecies and writings dovetailed perfectly together amen and not one contradiction laying in the scripture amen the prophet said there's only one intelligence that could write such a book that's god himself and so with that in mind just thinking about this how that man has been able by history to study and and and study past victories and past feats and and they've done this and by that they've they've had advantage in the presence see even by studying the past it's gave them an advantage in the present situations and i just thought about that if man could look to history and it would be an advantage to him in the present in other words even just thinking about on a military uh uh uh platform you know if there is if people are in battle amen you know they even at sports you know they use it all the time amen when they're getting ready to face a team what they do they watch past games and they watch amen how they play and amen and how they you know how others defended against their offense uh uh you know and all these things and they're able to take advantage and have an advantage when the conflict comes even because of what they have seen has already happened amen and i thought if man was able to do that amen and that could be a great advantage to him what if you knew the future what if you actually knew amen where your enemy was going to be before he got there hallelujah amen and that's what we find in the bible when israel amen was fighting against the syrians i believe it was amen and the syrian king amen he said he said listen he said every time we go to battle he said the enemy knows where we're going to be before we ever get there and that king began to look around he said listen we got a spy in the camp there's a mole around here somewhere there's somebody that's telling even the secrets amen uh to israel and and somebody come up to the key said king there ain't no spy in the camp amen but the secret of the thing is it's a prophet down in israel hallelujah and he tells the king of israel amen the secret things that you think in your bed chamber amen and god is giving them a warning and they know where we're going to be before we ever get there come on church and the bible said that didn't just happen one time it didn't just happen two times even but time after time amen god had already warned israel of where their enemy was going to be and the enemy was actually bewildered amen they were confused and bewildered even because they didn't understand amen how israel had such an advantage over them and i want to say this this morning i think the devil is confused i think the devil is bewildered amen when he faces this bride he is wondering how in the world every tactic i've ever used it worked on every other group amen but it ain't working on me i'm hallelujah but let me just let the devil in on a secret we have had a prophet and he is coming this day and god our enemy has been exposed [Applause] hallelujah we know the tactics of our enemy the tricks of the devil has been exposed hallelujah brother brown said somebody asked me not long ago he said what do you think about the future i said i don't know what the future holds but i know who holds a future he says so that's the thing if i can just keep acquainted with him now i'm just getting where i really want to be this morning because i want you to catch this seeing the future can change the present brother madam said he's in a discernment now said all right lady he said do you believe these things are taking place from the spirit of god he said and us being strangers to each other he said if something would have would happen and let me know something about you if god can tell me what you have been surely he can tell me what you will be if he knows the past he knows the future seeing that makes him god another place another prayer line brother brown says now isn't he lovely sister he's the fairest of ten thousand he's the lily of the valley he is a morning star i perceive right now that you are a christian because your spirit begins to feel welcome see and i know that somewhere standing near he's standing because your spirit and the holy spirit which is now on me is becoming in contact with each other's seat and now he can reveal to me and if he knows what your past has been and you are the judge of that he and he tells you what your future will be surely if he knows the past he knows the future see if he'd tell the future before he told the past then you would wonder whether it was going to happen or not but if you tell you what you already know no has happened then you know whether the future is going to be right see how he does it it makes it so real there's no way out of it and then the prophet says now the audience can still hear my voice the woman seems to be moving away from me she's going back i see her she's standing in a building she's before a doctor the doctor says she has a tumor that's a thyroid tumor he says you must be operated on frankly i see a shadow coming over that that was the been the middle of last week you must have been operated on but the reason you didn't you heard i was coming here and you come and wanted me to pray for you before that could take place thus saith the lord that's true now watch because i probably have just told this this sister if if god would tell you something about your past see something that only something that she knew that brother branham did not know even but if god could reach back and tell her in great detail something about her past he said then you could trust what he says about your future amen just saying about is that not what we've seen uh at the woman at the well when when jesus meets the woman at the well he begins to speak to her amen and when he began to speed her he began to tell her he began to tell her about her past amen and he began to tell her about mean all the the trouble of her life amen and but but listen friends amen he was not just telling her about her past to leave her in that condition hey man he was not just telling her listen the things that he was telling her was not good things he was not reaching into her past and telling her about how what a good little girl she had been and and all the great things she had done in her life hey man she he was actually telling her about all her past and and the mistakes of her past and and the failures of her life but he was not bringing that up to condemn her he was not bringing it up to leave her in that condition he was only telling her about her past so that she could trust his word when he began to tell her about her future [Applause] hallelujah let me tell you something church this message didn't come to us amen to tell us how bad we are and what how how what a bad condition that we were in only leave us that way no sir it only come to tell us amen yes amen we were in a bad condition but there's a way out of it hallelujah amen god is not going to leave us in that condition [Applause] what intelligence could tell us these things you know you remember the story brother brown tells about the infidel he goes out he goes hunting you know he's going to go they're going to go hunting on this man's property and and you all know the story i want but you know the man says you preachers are barking up the wrong tree and so brother branham you know he don't i loved studying the life of the prophet brother brown didn't break his bible out start coming through scriptures and condemning the man's he just started talking to him and he looked over it and he starts talking about a tree and you know and and the thing about it is is the man said i'll tell you he said now there's one preacher i would like to meet one day and he starts he starts testifying about a neighbor that was dying amen and how that that a man they may come in and and discern and and and you know you all know the story and the and the sister was healed he said i'd like to meet that man one day and brother brown starts talking about that tree and how the sap he said what tells the sap amen to go down in the winter time and stay there until the spring of the year and then come back up in that tree what he said well you know that's just that's just nature and or so forth and he said well take a fence post stick it in the water and see what it does he said there's something there's got to be some intelligence there's something behind that amen in other words he was telling the man there's a god somewhere there is something greater than this i told the church a while back because you know i i've been studying quite a bit and though and the world is moving in a direction at a rapid pace especially in this generation amen people are moving rapidly to the idea amen of agnostic or you know or or atheists or people that don't believe in nothing or even some that just acknowledge there's something somewhere but we don't know what it is amen and people have become so open-minded that their brains fell out because church i want to tell you if you need proof there's god amen if you need proof that god is real open your eyes and look around you amen i don't know about you but everywhere i look i see god and the prophet was telling this infidel you know he used that tree and he told him it at the end he said now i'm gonna go hunt a few squirrels he said when i come back he said if you can tell me he said you just think on this as i go hunt squirrels when i come back if you can tell me amen what tells that sap to go down in the roots and hide in the earth in the wintertime come back in the spring he said i'll tell you what intelligence told me what was wrong with that woman up there hallelujah amen what intelligence was that i'm asking you the question this morning amen what intelligence have we seen in this day amen that knew amen amen their address amen knew what their names were come on church i'm not talking about just somebody standing up the pool they say hey somebody in this building got a heart uh a heart trouble there's somebody in here with a headache anybody could do that i'm talking about amen god coming down and time after time after time amen he would say amen you come from seoul from indiana you come from amen from kentucky amen you're from georgia amen you this is your address amen your name is so and so you're not even praying for yourself you're praying for a brother come on church amen that's not guesswork and let me just say this for the critics this morning not once have i ever heard on any tape where any of them people said wait a minute brother branham that's not the truth not one time come on church amen don't quit listen to this bunch i hear a bunch of critics say man amen let me tell you amen where's their vindication [Applause] hallelujah somebody called me a while back and and i don't even know why i'm going in this direction but i hope it's all right just follow the lord remember somebody called me a while back and said they want to send me a bunch of material and they wanted me to watch this video and he said would you be willing to do that i said absolutely not and i said i don't want the material and and and and they were pretty bothered by it because they said man they said you're just going to put your head in the sand you're leading them you're a pastor you've got your response for people's souls you're not and and and i said well i'm just i know i'm not interested and you know it's something something in me later amen because this is the thing that they told me and said well if you got what you claim you got what are you worried about you see how the they put the challenge if you got what you claim you have what are you worried about in other words if you if if you believe it's so uh uh so if you're standing so firm and and you're anchored in the word you've got the holy why are you worried about it why would you be scared to listen to it or read it i'm not afraid of it amen but you know i didn't have an answer right at the moment but later on as i was sitting there thinking about it the holy spirit just spoke to my heart and said because you have what you claim you have you won't listen to it because you have what you claim you have amen you ain't got time for that [Applause] and i got to thinking about that and you know i thought you know and and the argument was being made about the boy in finland and somebody told the story a little different over here and some brother wrote wrote about it different all the accounts weren't lining up and amen and i thought amen you know what amen you know why they got so much to talk about in brother brown's ministry is because there's a lot of testimonies to talk about ain't nobody arguing about people they raised from the dead there ain't no testimonies amen of anybody they raised from the dead amen there ain't nobody having no debates about even the visions that they had because they ain't never had a vision come on church the reason why there's so much to criticize is because god did so much in this day there's so much of the supernatural that has taken place in our hour that's why every gun out of hell is attacking this message hallelujah i'm way off my notes right now amen but i want to tell you this amen i'll make this challenge i'll put our young people up against any other group amen any denomination any movement come on church amen they say the message don't work look around you look at these young people sitting at the front of this church amen come to my church the front row is filled amen with young people young girls even hair growth out even dressed in modesty young boys that are acting like men and not a bunch of sissies brother you come too late to tell me that the message of the hour don't work it works [Applause] it is producing everything god said it would produce hallelujah amen and i am not ashamed to say this amen it has produced amen the greatest preachers that has ever stood in a pulpit and preached the word it has produced the greatest mothers it is produced come on church amen this message amen is jesus christ [Applause] mercy i'm out of time but y'all give me just a little grace this morning i'm trying to take my liberty for an hour but i'm i'm getting where i need to be and i just ask you for a few more minutes what intelligence i want to ask you this what intelligence led you here or maybe i'll ask you then why are you here amen why are you here i i i don't know you i don't know most of you amen but i think i could probably go to this church this morning and it would be incredible the testimonies that i would hear of how you got here amen something brought you here amen and brother banham talks about the the salmon gathering around in the ocean and he said they begin to come and they begin to gather and and he said he said they're getting ready to go back in the rivers that they were that they were birthed in amen they're going to actually to spawn and and they're going to their death but the prophet said it but nothing can stop them and you know what's amazing about that is they will go back to the very stream amen the very stream that they were birthed in they will go back to that very what leads them there who told them how to get there what kind of gps system do they have i'm talking about a fish that's been swimming around in the ocean amen you realize amen do you realize that they're actually a freshwater fish amen but they're living in salt water amen they weren't even born oh hallelujah amen they're actually living in a place amen but they were actually not born amen to live in that condition but at a certain time amen which amen by something that is unexplainable they begin to gather together but they are not gathering to stay they are gathering to leave hallelujah because there's a call in them to go back home listen when they start swarming around out there in the ocean they they don't come together to see who the biggest fish is they're not looking around saying who's got the best colors even they're not trying to fit come on church they got one reason they're gathering amen they're gathering together that they might return to the place of their birth and let me just say this the devil don't understand amen while you're gathering together like this amen but you are not gathering together look think about it amen there's people here from all different backgrounds different walks of life even you come from different places amen but you've all come together you didn't come here even to see one another you didn't come oh come on church amen you're gathered together ain't meant to leave [Applause] and there's nothing going to stop you [Applause] their journey is completely covered with obstacles they'll leap over waterfalls and leap through fish ladders that they call them and and there's bear and there's you know there's everything in the world trying to stop them you know i read a a story a while back it's cr incredible as they took a fish one of these fish was born in a hatchery and they released that fish and when it come to time with the spawning season that fish went right back up that stream and they went to the pipe that where that hatchery was released into that stream and that thing was so designed to where it would release you know with could release fish but they couldn't swim back in it but that fish went back up to that the entrance of that pipe and it just started backing up and bumping into that and it just kept on until it broke through swam up the very pipeline and back into the very hatchery it was born in it was a tagged fish and they found that fish right back in the exact hatchery that it was birthed in amen think about that talk about determination amen i'm talking about amen and i ask you amen what intelligence told that fish how to get there brother brown talks about you know though the there was a great earthquake going to happen in india and he said before days before all the birds left to flew out of the of the rocks of the walls the cattle and the different animals that stood in the shade of them walls moved out in the middle of the field huddled around each other amen leaned on one another and then days before that event took place amen what warned them i ask you this what intelligence led the animals amen to noah's ark in the days of noah what led them even what what intelligence was it that was leading you in that place amen and i'll say this if you can answer that question then amen i believe you can begin to understand why you're here this morning amen and and and let me say this there's many that are not here come on church amen many have fell away many have turned around even but you're still here amen and i say this it's not because you're a better people it's not because of the last name that you have it's because almighty god had already determined it before the foundation of the world you're not keeping yourself you're not holding yourself there's something greater than what you [Applause] are hallelujah let me just try to bring this down brother branham talks about because i want you to see how that seeing the future can change you in the present brother brown talks about you know congressman upshaw if you remember that in the in the the testimony brother branham says that he said he saw he saw a young boy and he he's fallen off a hay rack or something and brother brown says then he saw he sees a man and there's a great audience applauding this man he had a certain kind of collar on and this audience is applauding this man and then one of the brothers there he said brother branham that's that's mr upshaw he said he's right in the meeting now he's sitting around for he said that's the man and brother branham breaks into a vision if you remember in the vision he sees a doctor and the doctors got thick glasses and brother brown says he had taken the tonsils out of a little a little uh black girl and she it paralyzed her from her neck down and brother branham was telling he sees the doctor standing over her and he's shaking his head and the little girl is paralyzed from her neck down there's a there's a a brother brown said he begins to hear weeping there's a colored lady sitting in the audience she said that's my baby that's my baby brother brown says he said yes he said he said that was about two years ago he said then the vision breaks brother brown sees a little girl carrying a baby doll walking with a baby doll he said when he's now now remember he's just saw the past is that right i mean he sees the doc two years ago even the girl in the present is in this paralyzed condition even but now the prophet gets a vision of her future and he sees that little girl carrying a baby doll amen and as he speaks that amen he said she's healed it's over mama the girl is healed that's the saith the lord what gave him the courage to say that he had already saw a vision of her future and brother branham is beginning to if i remember the testimony right he's beginning to walk off the platform and the meetings come to a close he said and then a vision breaks he sees uh congressman upshaw in a brown suit tipping his hat walking down the street and then amen he speaks thus saith the lord amen the man is healed and for the first time in 66 years a man stood to his feet church i want you to understand i know the devil don't like that amen but that's the truth that's what god done in our day and do you know that that congressman upshaw said in many of brother brown's meetings and even after even the healing took place he was sitting in the meeting and brother branham would give the testimony and the man was sitting right there and not one time did he ever stand up and say that didn't happen that way brother man as a matter of fact i do not know on one tape at least brother brown starts giving the testimony and mr upshaw interrupts brother branham amen not to contradict what he's saying amen but actually to say that is the truth one time he walked across the platform hallelujah amen listen church amen this is not amen a fairy tale i'm talking about [Applause] and god told him about the future it changed him in the present there's another time brother branham brother brown was in this in a in africa there and he gives this testimony i think this testimony is amazing and brother brown said there was a in the meeting there he said there was tens of thousands of people and in that meeting you'll remember this they brought a boy up on the platform and they let him up with a chain and he they let him up there like a dog and the boy would have been born that way and he and and he would you know walk like a dog he had just didn't have wasn't in his right mind at all couldn't speak anything and you know what's amazing about it brother ron is when they brought that boy up there brother branham under the anointing of the holy spirit when the boy comes up he says he says he discerns the boy's heart and he says you're thinking about your brother who is crippled could you imagine this boy was born amen he wasn't even in his right couldn't even speak even brother brown said he he had been in this condition all his life couldn't even speak and now a prophet says you're thinking about he's discerning what's on this boy's heart and he said you're thinking about your brother who's crippled he fell off a yellow dog or a goat or something as he said and he said he's crippled and he said way back in the audience way back he said nearly a half block away he said a boy come running down through the audience and he threw down he had some clubs that he had been walking with and he had threw them down or he was lifting them up in his hands i believe he said lifting them up in the air saying i'm healed i'm healed amen then the boy was completely healed brother branham had looked back in the past he saw that boy fall and be injured he saw in the future he saw the boy walking and then brother branham all of a sudden he says he said he saw a vision now this boy is still on all four he's he's on his hands and feet walking like an animal chain around his neck and brother brown says he said he all of a sudden a vision breaks and he sees that boy standing on his feet tears flowing down his face in his right mind he said i knew it was all over then he spoke to the boy in the name of the lord jesus christ he said the boy couldn't even understand he said he said the boy when he would begin to speak to him he tried to do a little dance you know some kind of little dance and and and he said he couldn't even understand he said he spoke to him in the name of the lord he said to rise up and i love this because brother brown says amen and as he spoke to him he reached down [Music] and he took that chain that that had that around that boy's neck and that prophet of god by seeing that vision of the future brother ron he reached down and picked that chain up and he lifted that boy to his feet and for the first time in his life he stood upright like a man brother brown said tears began to flow down his face for the first time in his life he had his right mind listen church it shows the power of our god he could not even comprehend what was being spoken to him and neither did he have the ability to stand up on his own but that didn't stop the grace of god if god is determined to save you nothing can stop him if god is determined to heal you nothing can stop him church it ain't according to your ability he didn't even have the ability to understand what was being said amen but god bypassed all of that and when he couldn't stand up by himself a hand reached down and picked him up amen i thought about that and i thought about in the book of acts in the third chapter of acts amen when peter and john went by the gate called beautiful and there was a man laying there begging arms and he said peter said silver and gold have a number such as a hat such as we have we give unto thee in the name of jesus christ rise up and walk and the bible says amen that they lifted him up amen amen and he received strength amen in his in his feet is that right amen there had to be a power to lift him up let me just tell you church you might not have the strength to stand on your own this morning amen but i've got good news there's a power greater amen than what you are and there's a hand god has got a hand this one it is not short he can reach down and lift you up he caught a vision caught a vision of the of the future what give brother branham the what give brother brown the courage the courage to to be able to to reach down could you imagine could you imagine i just want you to think about this could you imagine here's a pr here's a man standing before tens of thousands of people tens of thousands of people and and and without apology without hesitating at all he declares it's over the boy's healed church he didn't wait for the boy to stand up he didn't have to wait a minute to actually see it happen he had already seen it happen you understand what i'm saying he had already seen it happen he knew it was going to happen that's what brother brown said whenever they come to the place in finland and and they come to this place the side of the road there pulled over and they seen the scene set here's a little debt a boy laying dead on the on the road brother brown something about the scene caught his attention something about the scene and he said wait a minute he said there's something about this and he tells one of the brothers he said go get your bible he said look in the fly leaf of your bible he said there's something wrote about this somewhere they went and got the bible and began to read in the in the fly leaf of the bible amen they began to see amen exactly amen what had been prophesied and then brother brown said when they began to recognize where they were standing and they began to realize we're standing in a vision is that right amen this has already been seen we're standing in the vision you know what brother brown said he said you could line up every devil out of hell now amen you can line every devil up amen it can't be stopped now amen line every devil and let me just say this amen the future was so clear amen the vision was so perfect amen that the prophet didn't have to wait to see the boy raise to declare it was going to happen amen he had a confidence why because he had already seen it hallelujah and you're thinking this word brother that's wonderful but why are you talking about somebody in africa and a boy in finland but let me just tell you this you have been seen in a vision your future is clear hallelujah there's going to be a rapture amen somebody is going to get a body change there's getting ready to be a resurrection come on church amen it's going to happen i don't have to wait to feel it i don't have to wait to see it amen something has wrote about it in this bible amen and as i look in the word i'm beginning to realize i'm living in the vision and you can light every devil out of hell up you won't stop it now hallelujah amen it can't be stopped this bride won't be stopped this rapture won't be stopped hallelujah the prophets already saw us in the preview amen in the vision amen he saw a bride listen church he saw the church he saw him being led by a witch he saw him dancing to a rock and roll beat he saw him falling off into hell but that ain't the end of the vision because the bride must come again and the last one looked exactly like the first one and when that bride amen come again into view even as she was walking over christian soldier hallelujah not falling a witch not falling off into hell but what did he see he saw her going up hallelujah i said god has already saw us going up and if you can realize in this world you're living in the vision your future is clear let's stand our feet this morning let me just close with this as the prophet said probably said when he come back from that trip to africa from africa there really andrew if you remember because he got in some trouble you know because he'd listen to men and there's some things that had taken place and brother brown was very sick he said it seemed like that heaven was just shut off to him and in that brother branham said that he was sitting in the room one night and he was thinking about his future that's what brother brown said the way he described he said was thinking about his future and as he said he said even he was this is the kind of thoughts he was having if you can imagine talking about a prophet of god i'm thinking about these things and he said he said well i guess this is the end of my ministry i guess it's all over now he's so sick and you know the it seemed like the lord wouldn't hear his prayers and he said i guess this is the end and he even had this thought in one place he said it like this he said he said well i guess that would be a good meeting to end on like because of the great supernatural things that god had done in there in africa and all the great healings and miracles had taken place and he said but as he was thinking on that brother brown said for the first time in months and months he said i felt that presence come into the room that voice began to speak to me says and as you were thinking on your future brother branham i don't fully understand what what he saw but he saw like some paper brother describing like typewriter paper he said begin to fold out he said then it just began to go all the way up into the heavens and the voice spoke to him and said your future is clear and god showed him this is not the end this is not your end your future is clear let me just encourage you with this and and leaving this morning amen you might be say you may be sitting here and maybe there's somebody here i don't know but maybe there's somebody here said i ain't felt that i ain't seems like the heavens is blocked off maybe you feel like i failed god and maybe you have i mean brother branham had made a mistake he i'm not saying that to belittle the prophet in any kind of way but he hadn't made a mistake it seemed like the heavens was shut off and you may be sitting here think man i made a great mistake i failed the lord and maybe you did fail god and maybe you you're getting a place in the and say because satan's an opportunist and he loves to take advantage of every situation he'll get you in the moments where you feel like you're a failure and you feel like you've failed god and and and and heaven is shut off from you and when and and when god is silent brother brown said that's when the devil starts talking but maybe this morning for the first time in a long time you could just feel the presence of the lord just come sweeping in the room what would it mean to you if you could just hear that voice say this is not your end your future is clear this is not your end church i want you to know we have not come to our end the greatest victory has ever been won the greatest achievement of the church is we're standing on the threshold of it what the prophets and the in the in the sages of old long to see we're living in the fulfillment of it right now this is not our end our future is clear can we bow our heads this morning lord jesus lord [Music] we believe with all of
