[24:03] morning, aren't we? Amen. And I asked
[24:05] Brother Doug Bowman if he would just
[24:07] come lead us to the throne of grace. We
[24:10] serve a mighty God, don't we? And we
[24:12] know he's capable of healing each and
[24:14] every one of these needs this morning.

[24:24] &gt;&gt; Isn't it good to be a Christian this
[24:25] morning? Amen. Let's pray over these
[24:28] requests.
[24:30] Lord Jesus,
[24:32] Lord, you're just such a mighty God. You
[24:34] did such a mighty thing for me last
[24:35] night and I just thank you so much for
[24:37] it, Lord. Lord, I'm just believing even
[24:40] more today, for me, for the rest of us,
[24:41] Lord, that you can do so many things,
[24:44] Lord, for us. Lord, you can touch our
[24:47] hearts. You can heal our bodies, Lord.
[24:49] Lord, things that we're praying for in
[24:51] our hearts that we don't even want to
[24:52] admit, Lord. You can come down here,
[24:54] Lord. You can expose those things. You
[24:57] can make all things brand new, Lord. And
[24:59] I just believe that you're going to do
[25:00] it for all of us today, Lord.
[25:04] Lord, we don't deserve any of this. But
[25:06] Lord, before the foundation of the
[25:09] world, you said that you're my son and
[25:11] my daughter, and I'm going to do
[25:13] everything to make sure that you're in
[25:14] the kingdom of heaven with me, Lord, for
[25:16] all eternity. And all we can do, Lord,
[25:19] is we can raise our hands and we can
[25:20] say, "Thank you, Lord. Thank you for
[25:22] doing that for us,
[25:24] Lord. These prayer requests,
[25:27] Lord, so many people dealing with
[25:29] sicknesses, Lord. Lord, just pains in
[25:33] their hearts, Lord, losing lost loved
[25:34] ones, Lord, having lost loved ones,
[25:37] Lord. I pray for Brother Ed's family,
[25:41] Lord. Just such a mighty warrior that's
[25:42] gotten his reward.
[25:45] Lord, I just know that you can do all
[25:47] things today, Lord. All it takes is a
[25:50] moment, just one moment with you, Lord,
[25:52] and can fix everything.
[25:55] Lord, I'm just believing mightily for
[25:57] all of these requests, Lord. Lord, I
[26:00] just thank you for our brother Joe Adams
[26:02] that's here with us, Lord. Lord, you
[26:04] know what he's done for me in my life,
[26:07] Lord. Five years ago. If it wasn't for
[26:09] him, I wouldn't be here today. And I
[26:12] just thank you for what you did last
[26:13] night. And Lord, I know he can do it for
[26:15] all of us. I know he can do even more
[26:17] today for me. Lord, I just thank you for
[26:20] all that you've done. Lord, I just ask
[26:22] that you bless this service, Lord. Bless
[26:24] it in a way like never before. And I
[26:26] thank you, Lord, and I love you. I ask
[26:28] it in Jesus name. Amen.

[29:58] I've been the one
[30:01] to shake with fear
[30:05] and wonder if you're even here.
[30:11] I've been the one
[30:14] to doubt your love.
[30:17] I've told myself
[30:20] you're not enough.
[30:26] [Music]

[31:48] [Music]
[31:49] beneath the weight
[31:52] of all my shame.
[31:54] [Music]
[31:56] I've been the one
[31:59] to believe
[32:02] that where I am, you cannot reach.
[32:09] You're the one who conquers giants.
[32:12] You're the one who calls out kings. You
[32:15] shut the mouths of lions.
[32:18] You tell the dead to breathe. You're the
[32:22] one who walks through fire. You take the
[32:26] orphan's hand. You are the one Messiah.

[32:54] [Music]
[32:59] And now I live
[33:04] with the spirit inside.

[37:43] where a song of thanksgiving starts
[37:47] because of all of your goodness
[37:51] and all the joy you give.

[41:29] welcome
[41:31] me?
[41:34] I was lost, but he brought me in. Oh,
[41:38] his love for me.
[41:43] Oh, his love for me.

[42:12] house,
[42:13] there's a place for me.
[42:18] I'm a child of God. Yes, I am.
[42:30] Free at last. He has ransomed me. His
[42:34] grace runs deep.
[42:40] While I was a slave to sin, Jesus died
[42:45] for me.
[42:48] Oh, he died for me.
[42:53] Who the son sets free.
[42:58] who is free in me.
[43:03] I'm a child of love. Yes, I am.

[45:16] [Applause]
[45:33] Aren't you thankful
[45:35] &gt;&gt; that the father didn't give up on you?
[45:38] Aren't you thankful that even though you
[45:40] walked away and you left everything that
[45:42] he had for you,
[45:43] &gt;&gt; he didn't give up on you,
[45:45] &gt;&gt; but he was desperate for you to come
[45:46] back home and he had his eyes up there
[45:48] on the hill. And there's a place in the
[45:51] father's house for you this morning.
[45:52] Aren't you thankful to the Lord Jesus
[45:54] Christ that there's a place for you?
[45:56] Hallelujah.
[45:58] Hallelujah.
[46:04] Hallelujah. As we get ready to bring out
[46:07] brother Joe this morning to come and
[46:09] preach the word of life, let's just
[46:10] stand and worship the Lord just a
[46:12] minute.
[46:15] Well, in that resurrection morning
[46:20] when the trump of God shall sound,
[46:24] we shall rise.
[46:26] [Music]
[46:28] Oh, then the saints will come rejoicing
[46:33] and no tears will ever be found.
[46:38] We shall rise.
[46:42] We shall rise.
[46:45] Well, we shall rise. Hallelujah. We
[46:48] shall rise. Amen. We shall rise
[46:54] in that resurrection.

[47:35] shall rise.
[47:38] We shall rise
[47:41] with our fathers and our brothers and

[50:16] Aren't you thankful that one of these
[50:17] mornings between the hours of 6:00 and
[50:19] 9, you got a promise that we shall rise.
[50:24] Hallelujah. Look at your neighbor and
[50:25] say, "I'm going to rise on that
[50:27] resurrection morning. I'm not I'm not
[50:30] somebody that's made up. I'm somebody
[50:31] that I was built to rise. I was not to
[50:34] go down, but I was built to come up."
[50:37] Hallelujah. I got a promise hanging over
[50:39] top of me. Hallelujah.
[50:42] Death can't hold me down. Cancer can't
[50:44] hold me down. Depression can't hold me
[50:46] down. Sickness and stigmas and
[50:49] complexes. I was born to rise.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:54] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Don't you just
[50:57] love the Lord with all your heart? Are
[50:59] you ready for the word of the Lord this
[51:01] morning?
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:04] It won't be long.
[51:09] Then we'll be leaving
[51:13] here.
[51:15] [Music]
[51:17] It won't be long
[51:24] and we'll be going home.
[51:31] Oh, it won't be
[51:35] long
[51:41] and then we'll be leaving
[51:45] here.
[51:49] Oh, it won't be
[51:52] long
[51:57] and we'll be going home.
[52:06] Oh, count the years as months.
[52:13] Oh, and count the months as weeks.
[52:23] And count the weeks as days.
[52:27] A windy day now.
[52:32] And we'll be going home. It won't be
[52:36] long.
[52:39] Oh,
[52:41] it won't be
[52:44] long.
[52:49] Oh,
[52:50] [Music]
[53:08] we go
[53:10] home.
[53:13] [Music]
[53:16] Well, if I had Andrew's voice, I would
[53:18] continue to worship. But we have a
[53:21] Chihuahua voice this morning.
[53:25] So, we're happy to be here with you.
[53:27] We're honored to be among God's chosen
[53:30] for this hour. And it's not just Full
[53:33] Gospel Lighthouse, but it's the bride
[53:34] worldwide.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; You know, this message produces some of
[53:38] the most quality people that there is.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:42] It's a people that share the same life,
[53:44] the same characteristics, the same
[53:46] passion, the same love that our father
[53:49] has as was in his son. And we we we're
[53:52] so thankful that God sent us a message.
[53:55] You know, as the older I get, the longer
[53:57] that I I stay here on earth and to dig
[54:00] into the things of God, the word, and
[54:02] then the message itself makes me have a
[54:05] greater appreciation
[54:08] for not only William Brandom and not
[54:10] only this message, but God's
[54:12] positionally placing a body and the
[54:15] understanding that we have and who we
[54:17] are. Because without that understanding,
[54:19] you'll just drift through life. You'll
[54:21] be up one minute and down the next. But
[54:23] God had anchored us in this word. And as
[54:26] I tried to preach to you last night, we
[54:28] have a hiding place. And when you're
[54:30] ever sheltered in that hiding place, no
[54:32] matter what buffets you, what storms
[54:34] rage against you, you have an anchor.
[54:36] You have a tie post. And this message,
[54:39] the further I go, Brother Ron, the
[54:41] deeper that anchor digs.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; You know, we've had tough battles and
[54:45] tough times, but God has ever remained
[54:48] faithful to us. And this morning I just
[54:50] want to take some time and
[54:53] you know my pastor and you know the
[54:57] testimony of his lengthy services but
[55:01] you know I've been privileged for 20some
[55:02] years to s under a great ministry
[55:05] &gt;&gt; a great pastor a great friend and I'm
[55:08] not going to hold you two hours so you
[55:10] can breathe. But I'm very grateful that
[55:13] God has positioned us under great
[55:15] leaders and great men of God to to bring
[55:18] the word to us to give us understanding
[55:20] in this hour.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; And what an understanding we have. But I
[55:24] want to speak just for a little bit this
[55:25] morning if I could on the mystery of his
[55:27] will.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; If you can catch the revelation of the
[55:31] mystery of his will. Not not brother
[55:34] Ron's will, brother Andrews will,
[55:36] brother Matt's, myself, any great man
[55:38] you want to put there, but the mystery
[55:41] of God's will. If you can take a little
[55:43] bit more of the highs out and maybe give
[55:45] me a little bit more lows, that'd be
[55:47] wonderful. Up here, um, we're going to
[55:49] look in Ephesians, and we understand
[55:51] that through the book of Ephesians,
[55:52] brother Brandon would tell us that the
[55:54] book of Ephesians is the book of Joshua.
[55:56] It parallels that. So, what did Joshua
[55:59] do? He placed the people in the land.
[56:03] And that's what Ephesians does for the
[56:05] bride. It places her in her original
[56:09] position in the body of Christ. And we
[56:11] start here in Ephesians 1 and verse
[56:13] three. It says, "Blessed be the God and
[56:15] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has
[56:17] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[56:20] and heavenly places in Christ." Notice
[56:22] verse four here. according as he has
[56:25] chosen us in him before the foundation
[56:28] of the world. So you being here this
[56:30] morning had nothing to do with man.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; You being here this morning had nothing
[56:35] to do with any great preacher. It had
[56:37] nothing to do with mama and daddy. that
[56:39] he has chosen us in him before the
[56:42] foundation of the world that we should
[56:44] be holy without blame before him in love
[56:48] having predestinated predetermined our
[56:51] destiny unto us the adoption of children
[56:54] by Jesus Christ according to the good
[56:57] pleasure of his will that word will
[57:00] there means purpose and plan so God has
[57:03] a purpose for each and every one of you
[57:06] that's here this morning young person he
[57:08] has purpose. He has a plan for your
[57:10] life. Grandmother, wife, husband, God
[57:14] has a purpose for you. And he has a
[57:16] purpose for the stage and the phase of
[57:18] the journey that you're in. And you know
[57:20] what? Don't get disgruntled with where
[57:22] you are in the journey.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Just keep following God's path, having
[57:27] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[57:29] children by Jesus Christ to himself,
[57:32] according to the good pleasure of his
[57:33] will, to the praise of his glory, of his
[57:35] grace, wherein he hath made us accepted.
[57:38] That word accepted there means to make
[57:40] an object of favor.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; When you look at yourself and you see
[57:44] mistakes, but brother Chris, he sees an
[57:47] object of favor. my that he wants to
[57:50] bestow his favor upon you in the
[57:52] beloved, in whom we have redemption
[57:55] through his blood, the forgiveness of
[57:56] sins, according to the riches of his
[57:58] grace, wherein he hath abounded toward
[58:00] us in all wisdom and prudence, having
[58:02] made known unto us the mystery of his
[58:05] will, according to his good pleasure,
[58:07] which he had purposed in himself, that
[58:10] in the dispensation of the fullness of
[58:11] times, he might gather together in one
[58:13] all things in Christ, both which are in
[58:15] heaven, which are on earth, even in
[58:18] in whom we've have obtained an
[58:20] inheritance being predestinated
[58:22] according to the purpose of him who
[58:24] workketh all things after his counsel of
[58:25] his will that we should be to the praise
[58:28] of his glory. The first who first
[58:30] trusted in Christ in whom you also
[58:32] trusted that after you have heard the
[58:34] word of truth, the gospel of your
[58:35] salvation, and whom also after you have
[58:37] believed, you were sealed with the Holy
[58:39] Gh spirit of promise, which is the
[58:41] earnest of our inheritance unto the
[58:43] redemption of the purchased possession
[58:45] unto the praise of his glory. God bless
[58:48] you. You can have your seats this
[58:49] evening.
[58:53] Like I said, I just want to take a
[58:54] little bit of time this this morning
[58:56] here and speak on the mystery of his
[58:58] will. And we find that a mystery in the
[59:02] Greek, it's mysterion, and it doesn't
[59:04] mean something that's spooky or hidden
[59:06] or unknowable, but it means a truth that
[59:09] is previously hidden. Thank you, brother
[59:12] Matt.
[59:13] But now being revealed by God. So a
[59:16] mystery is the divine purpose that was
[59:19] not fully understood in in the past but
[59:23] now we find that it's being made known
[59:25] unto us. And Paul will begin to explain
[59:28] remember before Paul came on the scene
[59:31] that the gospel or the ministry at that
[59:33] time was solely focused on the Jews. It
[59:36] was solely focused on the Pharisees and
[59:39] the Sadducees. And we find that one of
[59:41] the greatest mysteries is that God will
[59:44] turn from the Jewish dispensation. And
[59:47] now he would begin to turn his efforts
[59:49] through a vindicated prophet by the name
[59:51] of Paul and he would begin to establish
[59:53] the church on the revelation of who she
[59:56] is. Now remember Paul went on the back
[59:58] side of the desert. He wasn't taught by
[1:00:01] man but he spoke to God. Though he was
[1:00:03] taught under Galia, he had to take
[1:00:05] everything that he ever learned. He had
[1:00:07] to count it as dung and he got on the
[1:00:09] backside of the desert and he began to
[1:00:12] have the understanding of God. God would
[1:00:14] begin to reveal to Paul the great
[1:00:17] mystery that laid down through the ages.
[1:00:19] And yet Paul when he began to establish
[1:00:21] the church, he began to reveal to her
[1:00:24] the hidden mystery of God.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Before the Gentiles had no inclusion in
[1:00:31] the plan of God, or so it seemed, they
[1:00:35] had no inclusion. It was all the Jews.
[1:00:37] And and we find here in Ephesians 3 and
[1:00:39] in verse one, for this cause I, Paul,
[1:00:42] the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you
[1:00:44] Gentiles, if you have heard of the
[1:00:46] dispensation of the grace of God, which
[1:00:49] is given to me to you, how that by
[1:00:52] revelation he made known unto me the
[1:00:55] mystery, as I wrote a foreign words,
[1:00:58] whereby when you read, you may
[1:01:00] understand by knowledge in the mystery
[1:01:02] of Christ, which in other ages was not
[1:01:05] made known unto the sons of men, has now
[1:01:07] revealed unto his holy apostles and
[1:01:10] prophets by the spirit that the Gentiles
[1:01:13] should be fellow heirs.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; I say thank God for Paul coming that God
[1:01:18] can take a vessel and to begin to reveal
[1:01:21] his plan of redemption and that not only
[1:01:24] was the Gentiles who once was outside
[1:01:27] but now through the revelation and the
[1:01:29] making known of the mystery now God was
[1:01:32] bringing in a gentile people. See, God
[1:01:35] had purpose in his heart. God had
[1:01:37] purpose in his mind that he wanted to
[1:01:40] take somebody, not just forced to love
[1:01:42] him, not just forced to worship him, but
[1:01:45] a people that would love God for who he
[1:01:48] is and for what he's done for them. And
[1:01:50] God would call out a Gentile bride
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; and begin to establish her on the
[1:01:56] revelation of the word
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; that the Gentiles
[1:02:02] should be fellows and of the same body
[1:02:05] and partakers of his promise in Christ
[1:02:08] by the gospel. So Paul didn't keep this
[1:02:11] mystery, brother Ron, hidden.
[1:02:16] No, he received a message from the angel
[1:02:20] on the back side of that desert and God
[1:02:22] be just to flow into Paul and reveal
[1:02:25] into Paul and you know Paul's group was
[1:02:27] ready for a rapture.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Paul's group had everything they needed
[1:02:32] for the rapture. But there was Why could
[1:02:34] not Paul group take the rapture? Because
[1:02:37] of you right here tonight or this
[1:02:38] morning. See, Paul couldn't take a
[1:02:40] rapture because Paul wasn't aware that
[1:02:43] there was going to be six more church
[1:02:45] ages. But there was going to be a people
[1:02:47] in the final age in Satan's Eden that
[1:02:50] God was going to culminate. Matter of
[1:02:52] fact, here in this hour, this bride is
[1:02:54] the crescendo of everything that God had
[1:02:57] manifested and thought in his mind. You
[1:03:00] are that very manifestation here this
[1:03:02] morning. The very heart purpose of God
[1:03:05] is you. Full gospel lighthouse.
[1:03:09] I don't care what kind of day you're
[1:03:10] having. I don't care what kind of year
[1:03:12] you're having. I want you to come to the
[1:03:14] understanding and the revelation that no
[1:03:16] matter what you go through in life, you
[1:03:19] are the very heart purpose of God.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Every preacher that he's ever sent,
[1:03:24] every prophet that he ever sent, every
[1:03:27] messenger that he ever sent, he sent him
[1:03:29] for one purpose. Get me a bride.
[1:03:33] Come on, somebody. Can I tell you this
[1:03:35] morning? You are that gentile bride. You
[1:03:38] are that elect lady. You are that
[1:03:41] predestinated son and daughter of God.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; But Paul would begin to reveal the
[1:03:49] mystery. Though Paul didn't have it all
[1:03:51] because Paul wasn't aware that there was
[1:03:53] going to be seven total church ages with
[1:03:56] seven total messengers.
[1:03:59] But he began to reveal the mystery that
[1:04:02] the Gentiles were included in the
[1:04:05] purpose of God, in the will of God, in
[1:04:09] the plan of God. And the mystery, as we
[1:04:11] said, is a hidden thing.
[1:04:14] You know, we tell secrets sometimes.
[1:04:17] It's a secret thing. It's a hidden
[1:04:19] thing. It's a mystery.
[1:04:23] And what brother Brandham taught us that
[1:04:25] God would begin to reveal the secret
[1:04:28] things to his bride. He said, "Not to
[1:04:31] these flatterers, but to her."
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Can you see your position?
[1:04:38] You that's received this revelation. And
[1:04:40] it not just be, as I said last night,
[1:04:42] well, God sent a prophet. It's more than
[1:04:45] that. It's a revelation of a mystery.
[1:04:50] Not of who the messenger is, but who he
[1:04:53] was sent to.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; So that's the thing that we got to
[1:04:56] understand. We, you know, and I don't
[1:04:58] mean to, you know, in this day and age
[1:05:00] and our client and our culture and where
[1:05:02] we are within the message. I believe we
[1:05:04] should be mature enough now to recognize
[1:05:07] that yes, God sent us an Eleazar, but
[1:05:10] our affection should not be to Eleazar.
[1:05:13] So we reverenced that office. We
[1:05:15] appreciate him coming to get Isaac a
[1:05:18] bride. But notice he came and he would
[1:05:20] tell Isaac, he would tell uh Rebecca
[1:05:23] everything about Isaac. How he walked,
[1:05:25] how he talked, what pleased him, how he
[1:05:28] moved, what kind of gentle nature he
[1:05:29] had, what kind of man he was. And he
[1:05:31] revealed to Rebecca all the
[1:05:34] characteristics of Isaac, his master.
[1:05:36] And what do you think this messenger
[1:05:38] done in this age? He came to this end
[1:05:40] time bride and he be to reveal to her
[1:05:43] what makes God tick. He went back into
[1:05:46] the back part of God's mind and to begin
[1:05:48] to show that everything that God has
[1:05:50] ever done, every purpose and intention
[1:05:53] that God has ever had been with a
[1:05:55] gentile, a gentile bride in mind. And
[1:05:58] you are that bride this morning.
[1:06:03] He began to reveal the things of God,
[1:06:07] the nature of Christ to a bride. Oh my.
[1:06:12] Don't sit here and just shut this off.
[1:06:15] Recognize who you are.
[1:06:20] We would find here in the the scripture
[1:06:23] 1 Timothy 3:16, it says that without
[1:06:26] controversy,
[1:06:28] great is the mystery of godliness.
[1:06:32] So, we're going to find, we're going to
[1:06:34] look here just a few minutes on this,
[1:06:36] the mystery of godliness that God was
[1:06:39] manifested in the flesh. The logos
[1:06:43] now manifested in humanity.
[1:06:47] We have struggle with that.
[1:06:50] That how could the log go
[1:06:53] in my failures? How could that logos
[1:06:56] dwell in my humanity in my weaknesses in
[1:07:00] my shortcomings? And we allow the enemy
[1:07:04] to beat us and beat us and beat us
[1:07:07] around the stump on our failures, on our
[1:07:10] weaknesses, on our humanity. Look, I
[1:07:13] want you to understand this morning.
[1:07:14] Maybe you know we understand that by the
[1:07:17] scriptures and by the word and by the
[1:07:18] ministry of this hour that that soul of
[1:07:21] yours has been converted but this flesh
[1:07:23] still has weaknesses.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; You got to bring this thing under
[1:07:26] subjection. But don't let that ever
[1:07:28] steal away what God has done in your
[1:07:30] spirit what God has done in your soul.
[1:07:32] Your soul has been redeemed.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; And yet God manifesting in the flesh and
[1:07:40] he was justified in the spirit and he
[1:07:42] was seen of angels, preached unto the
[1:07:44] Gentiles, believed on into the world and
[1:07:46] received up into glory. Notice what is
[1:07:49] the mystery of godliness. That great
[1:07:52] Jehovah God can come and be a man. that
[1:07:56] he can walk the same shores, go through
[1:07:58] the same pain, deal with the same
[1:08:00] afflictions, and still come out
[1:08:02] victorious.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; It was a mystery that almighty God can
[1:08:06] come. And let me tell you, the greater
[1:08:08] mystery is that he's still here this
[1:08:10] morning.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; And his deity tabernacling your
[1:08:13] humanity.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; God is still doing the same thing that
[1:08:18] God has always done. It's a mystery of
[1:08:21] godliness
[1:08:23] that God was manifested in the flesh.
[1:08:26] This proves that he's God, the eternal
[1:08:28] word,
[1:08:30] that the word was made flesh. First John
[1:08:33] 1 or John 1:1, that in the beginning was
[1:08:35] the word, the word was God and the word
[1:08:37] was with God. And in verse 14, the word
[1:08:40] was made flesh.
[1:08:42] So if it did it in that day, cannot the
[1:08:46] word do the same thing today?
[1:08:50] Cannot the word have the same impact
[1:08:52] today.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; See, he is justified. He was justified
[1:08:57] in the spirit. Whereas he was reproached
[1:08:59] as a sinner and put to death as a
[1:09:01] malifactor. He raised again by the
[1:09:04] spirit of God and was so justified from
[1:09:06] all the the the the calamities and
[1:09:09] whatever else which was loaded upon him.
[1:09:11] He was seen of angels. He was preached
[1:09:13] unto the Gentiles. Notice the Gentiles
[1:09:16] gladly received the message.
[1:09:21] And he was believed on into the world
[1:09:23] and preached and he was received up into
[1:09:26] glory in his ascension.
[1:09:29] His crowning exaltation
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; that God didn't leave him in hell. God
[1:09:35] didn't leave him in a grave. And if God
[1:09:38] didn't leave him in a grave, if God
[1:09:41] didn't leave him in hell, what do you
[1:09:44] think he's going to leave you there for?
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just as he ascended, there's going
[1:09:50] to be a bride making an ascension
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; because it's still the same. He's still
[1:09:55] God. And brother Brand will tell us in
[1:09:57] spiritual signs of the time without
[1:09:59] controversy, great is the mystery of
[1:10:02] godliness for God was manifested in the
[1:10:04] flesh, seen of angels, handled into the
[1:10:07] world, received up into glory. So we
[1:10:09] find in this now that he was God made
[1:10:13] flesh. He tabernacled with us.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; I thank God that he can come in this
[1:10:20] hour in this humanity.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; So God reconciling the world to himself.
[1:10:27] And we find so all that God was, he
[1:10:30] pours it into Christ.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; And all that Christ was, he pours into
[1:10:35] the church, the bride. So we've seen
[1:10:38] it's not three offices or maybe say it
[1:10:41] like this three persons of the trinity
[1:10:43] but it's we got as three offices of one
[1:10:45] God and yet father son and holy spirit
[1:10:47] but we understand that everything that
[1:10:49] God was he's one but he pours every
[1:10:52] ounce of himself into a bride body
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; but that bride body must recognize who
[1:10:59] she is. You're not just a churchgoer.
[1:11:02] You're not just a message believer. You
[1:11:05] don't believe just that God just sent a
[1:11:07] prophet, but you must believe that that
[1:11:10] message that that prophet preached. It
[1:11:12] was fit to me to change my life. And we
[1:11:15] talked about somebody taking a rapture,
[1:11:18] somebody oh being changed, stepping out
[1:11:20] of mortal into immortality. Let me tell
[1:11:22] you, that's got to be a revelation. If
[1:11:25] nobody makes it in Virginia, I'm going
[1:11:27] to make it. I've been called for it.
[1:11:29] Why? because it's a mystery is being
[1:11:31] made known to me in this hour that I'm
[1:11:34] part of the plan of God. I'm part of the
[1:11:37] will of God
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; and the purpose of God.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; But notice in Revelations 10:7. So we
[1:11:47] start with Paul and Paul begins to
[1:11:50] preach to the Gentiles. He begins to
[1:11:52] reveal these things. The mystery that's
[1:11:54] been hid now revealed. See, that was the
[1:11:57] starting of the revelation.
[1:12:01] But in the days of the voice of the
[1:12:03] seventh angel, we're not starting the
[1:12:06] revelation any longer. In the days of
[1:12:09] the voice of the seventh angel, when he
[1:12:11] shall begin to sound, the mystery of God
[1:12:15] should be finished.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; That which was hidden is now going to be
[1:12:20] finished as he has declared to his
[1:12:23] servants to prophesy. So we see here
[1:12:26] that the angel of the Lord,
[1:12:31] never before
[1:12:33] was this angel or any angel permitted to
[1:12:36] say the things which this angel would
[1:12:38] share with this elect of this last day.
[1:12:42] So they had we've had great men of God,
[1:12:44] great messengers come through each and
[1:12:47] every age and call out a bride for their
[1:12:50] age and their dispensation. But there's
[1:12:52] something different about this one.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; I hope that's okay to say that this
[1:12:57] message, he will take all the loose ends
[1:13:00] of the previous ages and tie them all
[1:13:03] up.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; See, none of the others. They were
[1:13:06] reformers. Great men, but reformers. But
[1:13:09] this is not a reformer. This is a
[1:13:11] prophet. And not just a prophet, but a
[1:13:13] vindicated Messiah prophet. One sign to
[1:13:16] the generation. What was it doing? It
[1:13:19] was going to culminate in a wordborn
[1:13:21] bride. God wrapping it all up tied all
[1:13:25] the loose ends from the six previous
[1:13:27] ages. The beginning of the revelation is
[1:13:30] now going to be the finishing of the
[1:13:32] revelation.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; God making known his plan, his will.
[1:13:39] And brother Ram tells us here in the
[1:13:41] breach at the sounding of the seventh
[1:13:44] church age, the last church age, all the
[1:13:46] loose sins that through these church
[1:13:48] ages had been progged at or they've been
[1:13:51] wound together. But at the end of the
[1:13:54] Pentecostal age, we're supposed to
[1:13:55] receive according to the word. As God,
[1:13:57] help me tonight to show you through here
[1:14:00] that we're to be see, we're receive a
[1:14:02] messenger that will take all the loose
[1:14:03] sins out there. Reveal the whole secret
[1:14:06] of God. What? For
[1:14:10] the rapturing of the church,
[1:14:14] the mystery of his will.
[1:14:18] He's going to rapture a church.
[1:14:22] never before been done
[1:14:25] collectively a body.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; We're not talking about drinking
[1:14:31] Kool-Aid and everybody dying,
[1:14:34] but we talking about everybody rising.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; I know you can't comprehend that,
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; right? Cuz you're in this thing called
[1:14:44] flesh.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; You're finite.
[1:14:48] He's infinite. All we can think about is
[1:14:51] where are we going to eat after service?
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; All we can think about is work that's on
[1:14:56] the schedule for next week or we're
[1:14:58] thinking about the trial that we're in
[1:15:00] or going into or just coming out of.
[1:15:02] See, that's all that we can think about.
[1:15:04] But God doesn't dwell around those
[1:15:06] things. God is here to lift you up. He
[1:15:09] knows what's laying in his mind and he
[1:15:12] knows how to bring a ministry. He knows
[1:15:14] how to bring set you into a church. And
[1:15:16] one day this old mortal humanity is
[1:15:19] going to drop away from us. And we're
[1:15:21] going to take up on a new robe. It's
[1:15:23] going to be a robe of righteousness.
[1:15:25] It's going to be a body called a
[1:15:26] theophony body, a word body. And we're
[1:15:29] going to step out of this pest house
[1:15:30] into a new body. Never to sin, never
[1:15:33] toe, never to get cancer, never to have
[1:15:35] a bad day, never to shed a tear, a new
[1:15:38] body that he's going to give us, church.
[1:15:41] But it's the beginning of the mystery.
[1:15:43] But God sent a seventh angel to finish
[1:15:45] the revelation of the mystery.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; To finish the revelation.
[1:15:54] Oh hallelujah.
[1:15:56] Take the loose ends cuz this one probed
[1:15:59] here. This one probed there. This one
[1:16:03] probed. They probing by the intellect of
[1:16:05] man. And yet we understand God used man.
[1:16:08] There was a dispensation that man was
[1:16:11] his voice or his instrument. But the
[1:16:13] days of men are over.
[1:16:16] God sent a vindicated angel, a messenger
[1:16:21] to culminate.
[1:16:25] I want you to think of this service as a
[1:16:27] rapture service.
[1:16:30] Quit worrying about next week. Quit
[1:16:33] worrying about whatever you're worrying
[1:16:34] about.
[1:16:36] Put your focus on a body change.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're not where you need to be.
[1:16:42] Like that old color lady. That old color
[1:16:44] sister said, "I ain't what I ought to
[1:16:45] be. I ain't what I want to be, but
[1:16:48] praise God, I ain't what I used to be."
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. Look at what you used to be
[1:16:54] and say, "Thank God. I'm not that
[1:16:56] anymore. I'm not a drunk. I'm not a a
[1:16:59] prostitute. I'm not that. I'm a son of
[1:17:02] God. I'm a daughter of God. I've been
[1:17:05] born by the word of God.
[1:17:08] Quit looking at your failures. When you
[1:17:11] look in the mirror, tell the mirror it's
[1:17:13] a liar.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; That if it don't break.
[1:17:21] That mirror lies to you.
[1:17:24] It's saying, "Oh, you're getting old."
[1:17:26] Well, Chris, you're getting wrinkled up.
[1:17:28] You look at that mirror like, "You liar.
[1:17:34] I ain't getting old. I'm 18 to 20.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; You're lying to me.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; That mirror you look at it and said,
[1:17:43] "Oh, you look like an upside down melted
[1:17:46] ice cream cone."
[1:17:49] Boy, them ain't love handles, them are
[1:17:50] love rails.
[1:17:53] You looking at me and say, "You're a
[1:17:54] liar."
[1:17:56] Said, "There's a theophony that I'm
[1:17:58] going back to. There's a word body that
[1:18:00] I'm going back to. That's what I'm
[1:18:02] seeing. Look yourself in the mirror of
[1:18:05] God's word that I come from God. I'm
[1:18:08] going back to God. I've been changed by
[1:18:10] the word of God. God is making known the
[1:18:13] mystery of his will, the mystery of his
[1:18:15] purpose.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; And he will send you a messenger to tie
[1:18:25] all of it up.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; That's why I so appreciate this message.
[1:18:28] Let me tell you, I was out in
[1:18:30] denominations. They didn't preach these
[1:18:32] kind of truths.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, they take a smoke break. Look, I had
[1:18:39] friends I grew up with, Brother Andrew.
[1:18:40] I'd go out on Friday night, man, we'd
[1:18:43] have an all night drunk. Now, I'm not
[1:18:44] praising that, so get that out of your
[1:18:46] mind. Saturday night, we'd go out and
[1:18:48] get drunk. Sunday morning, they'd be in
[1:18:50] the house of God.
[1:18:54] You should have saw yourself last night.
[1:19:00] Sunday morning. You ain't no cherub.
[1:19:05] They say, "Oh, once saved, always
[1:19:08] saved."
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Look, I was a newborn babe in Christ.
[1:19:13] And I said, "Let me tell you, I believe
[1:19:15] once saved, always saved." But let me
[1:19:17] tell you, he's got to save you from
[1:19:19] something because you still going back
[1:19:21] to that same pest house. You going back
[1:19:23] to that slot that you've been eating.
[1:19:25] But I tell you what, when God got a hold
[1:19:26] of me, brother, when God got a hold of
[1:19:29] me, he took the desires out well before
[1:19:31] I came to the message. And if he can do
[1:19:33] that before, what can he do in I say,
[1:19:36] "Oh, glory to God." What can God do when
[1:19:39] the revelation of the mystery has been
[1:19:41] made known to her?
[1:19:46] When God got a hold of me, let me tell
[1:19:48] you, there was no going back,
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; man. My buddies dropped me like I was a
[1:19:56] bad habit
[1:19:58] and I was glad.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; But would tell us though then in the
[1:20:06] last age all these mysteries are to be
[1:20:09] solved
[1:20:11] and handed out. See the prophet didn't
[1:20:14] just take these mysteries as a
[1:20:16] collective bunch of intellectual
[1:20:18] understanding and keep it to himself.
[1:20:21] No. But when he ripped the seals, the
[1:20:23] lamb used him to tear the seals off the
[1:20:25] book, he was only fulfilling the word of
[1:20:28] God. But he had to hand that book to
[1:20:32] somebody.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you, there's got to be a
[1:20:35] somebody. There's got to be a people in
[1:20:37] this hour that will take the book from
[1:20:39] his hands.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, what use is it to tear the
[1:20:42] seals off of it if nobody's going to be
[1:20:45] there to receive it? But let me tell
[1:20:46] you, John was a type of the bride. And
[1:20:49] he had to take the book from the angel's
[1:20:51] hand. Not only did he take the book, but
[1:20:53] he had to devour the book. He had to to
[1:20:56] digest the contents of that book and
[1:20:58] prophesy again.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; So, you got a responsibility, bride.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Well, I believe in a private.
[1:21:08] Well, big deal.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Eat the book. Amen.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; See where you fit in the mystery of God.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; In the message adoption number four,
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; I just find these things unique. So,
[1:21:24] forgive me if I take my time here and
[1:21:26] dwell on little aspects of a quote, but
[1:21:28] he says the scripture packed me back
[1:21:30] into the Old Testament, then back over
[1:21:32] into the New Testament and tied
[1:21:34] something together.
[1:21:37] see the mystery of his coming,
[1:21:40] the mystery of his will, and the mystery
[1:21:43] of us sitting together.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; So the spirit took them to the Old
[1:21:47] Testament, then brought them to the New
[1:21:48] Testament and begin to tie all these
[1:21:51] things together.
[1:21:53] My
[1:21:54] man, don't take for granted this message
[1:21:56] that we have. See, remember, it cannot
[1:21:59] be taught in a seminary.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; It's a mystery. You cannot know it or
[1:22:06] you cannot know it by education, by
[1:22:08] theology. It's a mystery that's been
[1:22:10] hidden since the foundation of the world
[1:22:13] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:22:15] sons of God.
[1:22:19] And brother B will tell us now he's
[1:22:20] talking about the book of Revelations.
[1:22:22] This is in uh the church age. She said,
[1:22:24] "Now, you recall I mentioned at the
[1:22:25] beginning of this message that this book
[1:22:26] that we're studying as an is the actual
[1:22:29] revelation of Jesus himself in the
[1:22:31] church and his work in the future ages."
[1:22:34] Then I mentioned that it takes the Holy
[1:22:36] Spirit to give us revelation or we
[1:22:38] failed to get it.
[1:22:41] See, bringing these two thoughts
[1:22:43] together, you will see that it won't
[1:22:44] take just an ordinary study,
[1:22:48] thinking to an ordinary study and a
[1:22:50] thinking to make this book real. When I
[1:22:52] first came to this message, that's what
[1:22:54] I thought, brother Chris, I was going to
[1:22:55] do. Great big theologian at the Baptist
[1:22:57] church. Only been saved two years. Yeah.
[1:23:01] Chihuahua coming out.
[1:23:03] Thought I was somebody. Yeah. I was
[1:23:06] rudely awakened.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; But we find when I got hold of the
[1:23:10] tapes, I'm like, I'm gonna find out. All
[1:23:12] they want to talk about is William
[1:23:14] Brandon. William Brandon. William
[1:23:15] Brandon. William Brandon. I went to Eden
[1:23:16] Light Tabernac. It was more William
[1:23:17] Brandon than it was Jesus Christ. Early
[1:23:19] on. Everybody, they wouldn't tell me
[1:23:21] about Jesus. They told me about William
[1:23:24] Brandon. William Brand, I'm like, "Man,
[1:23:26] where's Jesus fit in this equation?"
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; So, I got me some tapes and I took them
[1:23:30] back and I was living on my own over
[1:23:32] Mississippi. Yeah, that's the root of
[1:23:34] all my problems. I'm from Mississippi.
[1:23:36] So, don't blame it on Louisiana. Don't
[1:23:38] look at us in disgust. I moved away from
[1:23:40] there. We're good now.
[1:23:43] But I sat down, brother Ron, in my in my
[1:23:45] bedroom and I began to play the tapes
[1:23:47] and I like I want to hear this man for
[1:23:49] himself.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; And I but I took it with the aspect of
[1:23:52] trying to prove him wrong. Now, how am I
[1:23:55] to prove an angel wrong?
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; But some of you are still trying to do
[1:24:00] that today.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Still trying to figure out where it's
[1:24:04] wrong, where he's off, where's this,
[1:24:06] where is that. But let me tell you, I've
[1:24:07] been in this message for 25, 26 years
[1:24:10] now, and I've not found one error. I've
[1:24:12] not found one fault. I started there in
[1:24:14] my bedroom trying to look for a fault.
[1:24:16] And God called me to preach this mystery
[1:24:19] to you today. There is no error. There
[1:24:22] is no fault. It's the vindicated word of
[1:24:25] the living God down to an elect.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; But I got a hold of the story of the
[1:24:34] ancient mama woman there in Memphis,
[1:24:36] Tennessee. how her faith grounded the
[1:24:38] plane cuz I was just a few hours south
[1:24:40] of Memphis and I know where Bill Street
[1:24:42] was. I used to party on Bill Street.
[1:24:47] That's probably walking in my steps.
[1:24:52] Oh, but something just began to ring
[1:24:54] out. And when he begin to pray for that
[1:24:56] boy,
[1:24:59] mama is getting light in the room. What
[1:25:01] is it? Revelation be to break forth.
[1:25:05] You know, it wasn't the revelation that
[1:25:06] we have today for that young man. But
[1:25:08] the revelation that he didn't have to
[1:25:10] die a sinner. He didn't have to die in
[1:25:11] that condition cuz all ain't your mama
[1:25:14] wanted wanted was to see her son saved.
[1:25:16] She didn't care if he died. Let me tell
[1:25:17] you, you got to get to that same place.
[1:25:19] I don't care if they die. I just want to
[1:25:21] see him saved. I just want to see him
[1:25:23] born again. I just want to see him
[1:25:25] filled with the baptism of the Holy
[1:25:27] Ghost. That's all I want is that
[1:25:30] assurance in this hour.
[1:25:36] And when brother Brandham came back to
[1:25:38] Memphis a little later and he jumped on
[1:25:40] that little trolley cart.
[1:25:44] Parson Brandom. Parsons Brandon.
[1:25:47] Remember me? No, I don't remember you.
[1:25:48] Are you that boy? I'm that boy. I'm not
[1:25:50] only healed, but I'm saved. Now,
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; let me tell you, it turned my heart,
[1:25:56] Brother Ron. It wasn't great preachers
[1:25:59] from Ron Spencer and Tim Puit and Donnie
[1:26:01] Reagan at the time. It wasn't their
[1:26:03] ministry. It was the simple faith of a
[1:26:05] colored sister to have enough faith to
[1:26:08] trust in a man to trust in the word, to
[1:26:11] trust in a message that she never heard
[1:26:13] of before.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; And that prayer of faith over that boy
[1:26:18] and his life changed and it had a
[1:26:21] connection. And I've never I tell you,
[1:26:23] I've never been the same.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And when this mystery
[1:26:28] is ever made fully known to you, when it
[1:26:31] drops from here down to here, let me
[1:26:33] tell you, there ain't no going back.
[1:26:35] There ain't no giving up. There ain't no
[1:26:37] surrender. There's nothing to go back
[1:26:39] to. Why? Because you're focused.
[1:26:41] Something has happened. Your heart has
[1:26:43] been turned.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; But the mystery,
[1:26:50] brother Bam says, requires the teaching
[1:26:52] of the spirit.
[1:26:55] We got great teachers in this message,
[1:26:58] but we got to have the spirit to anoint
[1:27:02] not only the great teachers, but the
[1:27:05] ears of the hearer.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Notice now he says now that means that
[1:27:10] the book it's going to notice he says
[1:27:13] it's going to take the operation of the
[1:27:15] Holy Ghost. That means that the book
[1:27:17] can't be revealed to anyone but a
[1:27:20] special class of people. Now, I know
[1:27:24] some of you have always wanted to be
[1:27:26] special.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I got one body in here that's
[1:27:31] going to say, "Amen."
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; You ever went to an airport? How many of
[1:27:36] y'all y'all go have airports in
[1:27:38] Virginia?
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Man, they get on you walk and they
[1:27:43] calling somebody's name and you just
[1:27:44] walking to your terminal, walking
[1:27:46] getting your food, walking getting your
[1:27:47] drink. You ain't thinking about a so and
[1:27:49] so. We need you here. We need you here.
[1:27:51] We need you here. Let them call your
[1:27:53] name one time.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Stop, drop, and roll. I'm going. They
[1:27:58] can call my name.
[1:28:02] And that's what I'm telling you. It's a
[1:28:05] special class of people. You look out in
[1:28:09] the world, there's millions in the
[1:28:10] world.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Come on, Virginia. Look around Virginia.
[1:28:14] Y'all got more than 10 people.
[1:28:18] But you're sitting here hearing the
[1:28:20] vindicated word of the hour been
[1:28:23] received the mystery of the will of God.
[1:28:25] It shows that you are the elect of God,
[1:28:28] a special class of people. Because only
[1:28:31] that special class can receive the
[1:28:34] revelation of the mysteries of God.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; That shows who you are. Oh, Satan tried
[1:28:40] to cover it up. Try to put sin on it.
[1:28:43] Try to put a family lifestyle on it.
[1:28:45] traditions. A man's over to keep that
[1:28:47] seed from coming forth. But let me tell
[1:28:49] you, all that the Father has given me
[1:28:51] will come to me. I don't care if that
[1:28:54] little seed's got concrete pouring over.
[1:28:56] It's going to find itself up. It'll
[1:28:58] break that concrete. It's going to come
[1:29:00] to life. I mean, I was born in sin,
[1:29:03] shaped in iniquity, come from a home
[1:29:05] that didn't serve God. But yet, God had
[1:29:07] a seed on the inside. And I went a long
[1:29:10] time, brother, sister. But God's
[1:29:12] promised that a son of God, he can go a
[1:29:14] long time before he ever recognizes that
[1:29:17] he's a son. But God planted a seed and
[1:29:20] that seed will germinate. It will
[1:29:23] manifest everything that God desired it
[1:29:25] to.
[1:29:29] There ain't enough affliction. There
[1:29:32] ain't enough hardships to keep that seed
[1:29:33] down. So, you're a special class of
[1:29:38] people.
[1:29:42] Oh, come on, somebody.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Man,
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell on myself briefly. No,
[1:29:49] I'm not. I'm going to keep preaching.
[1:29:50] Let's just move on.
[1:29:53] I just felt checked. I'm like, "All
[1:29:54] right."
[1:29:59] See, but the mystery, Brother Bram says,
[1:30:02] the mystery requires the teaching of the
[1:30:05] spirit or it will never become clear.
[1:30:10] the mystery,
[1:30:12] how we need to hear from God and lay
[1:30:14] ourselves open and become yielded to the
[1:30:17] spirit to hear him and to know. 1
[1:30:20] Corinthians 2 and verse 6, how be it we
[1:30:22] speak wisdom among them that are
[1:30:24] perfect. Yet not the wisdom of this
[1:30:26] world, nor the princes of this world
[1:30:28] that come to not, but we speak the
[1:30:30] wisdom of God in a mystery.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; This is Paul. Even the hidden wisdom
[1:30:36] which God ordained before the world unto
[1:30:38] our glory. God ordained before the world
[1:30:41] unto our glory. That's why you're here.
[1:30:44] That's why you couldn't stay in the
[1:30:45] Amish community because God ordained
[1:30:48] before the world for your glory. That
[1:30:50] you could hear the mystery of this hour.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Which none of the princes of this world
[1:30:56] knew. For had they had known it, they
[1:30:57] would not have crucified the Lord of
[1:30:59] glory. But as it is written, I have not
[1:31:01] seen, nor ear has heard, neither has it
[1:31:04] entered into the heart of man the things
[1:31:05] which God had prepared for them that
[1:31:07] love him. But as is notice, but but God
[1:31:10] had revealed them unto us by his spirit.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; This understanding that we have did not
[1:31:17] come by some great seventh grade
[1:31:20] educated Kuckian.
[1:31:23] I marvel at the books that that man
[1:31:26] would read
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; and not just read but comprehend
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; because it would take a spirit, the
[1:31:34] spirit to come and anoint him to pull
[1:31:36] out the things that we had need of
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; out of those great theological books.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; A seventh grade. Look, we got a Kuckian
[1:31:46] in here this morning.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I would have him stand up,
[1:31:50] but he'll probably reject me as his
[1:31:51] father-in-law, so we're not going to do
[1:31:52] that.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Now, we want to throw off on Kentucky,
[1:31:58] but KY's a beautiful state.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; I'm fond of Kentucky. I got a beautiful
[1:32:03] daughter living over there.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; But they're not a bunch of idiots.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; And we think, well, he's a seventh grade
[1:32:11] educated Kentucky. We off, you know,
[1:32:13] people in the world just offcast.
[1:32:15] He come from a broken home. home. He
[1:32:17] come from not a broken as far as
[1:32:18] marriage, but a broken home of alcohol
[1:32:20] and Catholicism and all those type of
[1:32:22] things. And yet God would take a man
[1:32:25] like that and begin to mold him through
[1:32:29] hardships, shape him so that he can
[1:32:32] deliver a message to an end time people.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; And we find here God has revealed them
[1:32:39] unto us by his spirit. And so God would
[1:32:42] use that mouthpiece and he would break
[1:32:45] the revelation open and begin to share
[1:32:48] things that have never been shared. Oh
[1:32:50] my I think it's marvelous after the
[1:32:52] seals come open how the book changed.
[1:32:56] How the ministry begin to change. How
[1:32:59] the focus begin to change. Christ the
[1:33:03] mystery, the invisible union, you know,
[1:33:06] Melzd, all these wonderful titles, but
[1:33:09] got to go beyond the title and look and
[1:33:11] see what God is doing. Every sermon,
[1:33:14] brother Ron, after the opening of the
[1:33:15] seals, the prophet is revealing the
[1:33:18] mystery.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Revealing the mystery that it was never
[1:33:22] about him,
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; but it was about them.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; It's all been about you. Let me keep
[1:33:29] going now. For what man knoweth the
[1:33:31] things of man? Say, the spirit of man
[1:33:32] which is in him, even so the things of
[1:33:34] God knoweth no man, but the spirit of
[1:33:37] God. And we, and he goes, now we have
[1:33:39] received not the spirit of the world,
[1:33:41] but the spirit which is of God, that we
[1:33:44] might know the things that are freely
[1:33:46] given to us by God.
[1:33:48] Then we go to Colossians 1 and verse 25.
[1:33:52] Wherefore am I made a minister according
[1:33:54] to the dispensation of God which is
[1:33:56] given to me for you. Notice the
[1:33:59] dispensation given to me Paul for you
[1:34:02] bride.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; I want you to see the placing church.
[1:34:06] Paul's not placing it on himself.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Paul knew the office which he held. Paul
[1:34:13] was very aware that he held the office
[1:34:16] of setting the church in order. That
[1:34:18] gentile bride, getting her ready,
[1:34:20] calling her out of that Pharisee
[1:34:23] lifestyle, out of that life of sin. But
[1:34:25] he says now God did it through me but
[1:34:28] it's for you. And let me tell you the
[1:34:30] same thought or the same thought and the
[1:34:33] same message that the apostle Paul
[1:34:35] preached William Brandham preached it.
[1:34:37] It never was about William Marryiam
[1:34:39] Brandom. It's always been about the
[1:34:42] revelation of the mystery of the bride
[1:34:44] of Jesus Christ.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; And when the seals come open he begins
[1:34:49] to reveal more and more and more the
[1:34:52] invisible union. And it begins to real
[1:34:54] more Christ, the mystery of God
[1:34:56] revealed. And what is the mystery of
[1:34:58] Christ, it's the mystery of the bride in
[1:35:00] this hour.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; God begins to pour it out. So it's no
[1:35:05] longer a mystery or a loose end,
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; but the mystery of God at the sounding
[1:35:10] of that seventh angel, it's finished.
[1:35:14] Then he says in verse 27, to whom God
[1:35:16] will make known what is the riches of
[1:35:18] his glory of this mystery among the
[1:35:21] Gentiles, which is Christ in you.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; See, Paul had that revelation.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; And Paul was sharing that revelation
[1:35:31] back in the Ephesian age. And I'm afraid
[1:35:35] sometimes we miss the revelation in this
[1:35:37] age.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, we got generations that grew up in
[1:35:40] the church.
[1:35:43] Look, I see a bunch of young people,
[1:35:45] generations that all they've ever heard
[1:35:47] is the message, the message, the messes,
[1:35:49] the message. All they've ever heard is
[1:35:51] great message preachers. But it's got to
[1:35:54] be more than just hearing the message.
[1:35:56] As I said last night, we didn't come to
[1:35:58] talk about the message. We come to get
[1:36:01] in the message. And the message is
[1:36:03] Christ. Don't just settle for sitting on
[1:36:06] a pew. Don't just settle for going to
[1:36:08] Full Gospel Lighthouse. Don't just
[1:36:10] settle for Evening Tabernacle. Don't you
[1:36:12] settle for just sitting under some man,
[1:36:14] but make sure you get into the message
[1:36:17] which is Jesus Christ
[1:36:21] and let him get into you.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; So when I begin to think about the
[1:36:25] thought that I preached last night and
[1:36:28] the thought that I'm preaching to you
[1:36:29] today,
[1:36:32] thou art my hiding place. And if I can
[1:36:36] give this a subtitle today, I can see
[1:36:39] Jesus, brother Ron, telling David, that
[1:36:42] thou art my hiding place.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; That you little bride are hiding
[1:36:51] Elohim.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; El Shadai, Yahweh,
[1:36:57] Adonai,
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; in this in this.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Thou art. He's telling you little bride,
[1:37:02] thou art my hiding place in your
[1:37:06] humanity, in your weaknesses.
[1:37:10] You're hiding Jehovah God.
[1:37:15] The mystery
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; of the revelation of the will of God
[1:37:19] being made known to an end time people.
[1:37:22] He's not out there telling TNN
[1:37:26] different channels about who he is, but
[1:37:29] he's telling you, bride,
[1:37:33] brother B would take this and he would
[1:37:34] make a statement here. He says, "Now, in
[1:37:36] Christ and mystery, we're going to come
[1:37:37] out of here for a little bit this
[1:37:38] morning. I don't know what time I
[1:37:39] started, so y'all just tell me when to
[1:37:42] stop."
[1:37:44] He says, "When this great revelation
[1:37:47] revealed mystery is made known to you,
[1:37:50] then you denounce all the things of the
[1:37:53] world."
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; So young person, if you got one foot in
[1:37:57] the world and one foot in the church,
[1:38:00] then the mystery ain't been made known.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; You can say, "I believe God sent a
[1:38:04] prophet till you blew in the face." But
[1:38:06] you just playing the life of a
[1:38:07] hypocrite.
[1:38:09] You got to be all the way in because
[1:38:11] when this great mystery, this revelation
[1:38:14] mystery is revealed to you, you denounce
[1:38:16] all the other things of the world. So
[1:38:19] when God in this message, so when you
[1:38:21] see God in this message, you can't see
[1:38:24] anything else.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; He's all I can see.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; I wake up talking to God. I go to bed
[1:38:34] talking to God.
[1:38:36] Now, I got a beautiful wife, but I don't
[1:38:38] wake up talking to her.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Not saying that wrong, honey.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; When she rolls over in the sleep, I'm
[1:38:48] over there talking to the Lord. I mean,
[1:38:51] I just love it. It's my life.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; And I go to bed talking. I wake up
[1:38:57] talking to him, planning the day. Then I
[1:39:00] go in and have devotion with him and you
[1:39:02] know and get before him you know before
[1:39:04] I start my day you know it's all
[1:39:06] everything he consumes everything about
[1:39:08] me and once you receive the revelation
[1:39:11] and it's not just who God is but it's
[1:39:14] who you are
[1:39:17] you start seeing not only who God is but
[1:39:19] you see your place notice now in the
[1:39:21] Bible we hear a story have a story
[1:39:23] Abraham and Sarah Abraham had the
[1:39:25] revelation he had it known to him he was
[1:39:28] going to bring forth this done. He was
[1:39:30] willing, brother Ron, to wait however
[1:39:31] long it took to wait. But Sarah
[1:39:34] struggled with the revelation.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Sarah struggled for 25 years. Oh, take
[1:39:40] my handmmaid Hagar. Take her and you can
[1:39:42] do this. And you know, and then after
[1:39:44] that was done, that was at the will of
[1:39:45] Sarah. She despised Hagar and despised
[1:39:49] that that bond child. Well, let me tell
[1:39:51] you, Sarah had to get to a place that
[1:39:54] she could judge God faithful. that God
[1:39:56] that gave the promise is more than able
[1:39:58] to fulfill the promise. And I'm here to
[1:40:00] tell you tonight or this morning rather
[1:40:02] when you judge God faithful that he is
[1:40:05] the same yesterday, today and forever,
[1:40:08] then you will see yourself in the plan
[1:40:10] of redemption. You will see yourself in
[1:40:13] the mystery of God
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; that it's not just for Abraham. It's not
[1:40:18] just for the preachers. It's just not
[1:40:20] for moms and dads. It's not just for
[1:40:22] deacons and great men. It's for
[1:40:23] whosoever will. If you judge God
[1:40:26] faithful this morning, God will fill you
[1:40:28] with the Holy Ghost and make known the
[1:40:31] revelation of his will, his purpose, and
[1:40:34] his plan for your life.
[1:40:37] And he's got to be everything that you
[1:40:39] desire, everything that you think about.
[1:40:42] And you denounce
[1:40:44] all the other things of the world.
[1:40:46] Brother Abraham would take Colossians
[1:40:48] 1:15-29
[1:40:51] and he would preach Christ the mystery
[1:40:55] of God revealed. And if you've not
[1:40:57] listened to that in some time or better
[1:40:59] yet, go study it.
[1:41:02] Don't leave it all on the ministry. You
[1:41:04] go study it.
[1:41:06] So he's picking up, brother Ronnie,
[1:41:08] picks up Paul's inspiration,
[1:41:12] the mystery that includes Gentiles.
[1:41:16] The mystery that means we come from God.
[1:41:20] We're going back to God. See, he not
[1:41:22] only preaches the mystery of godliness
[1:41:24] and who God is, but he begins to show
[1:41:26] who the bride is and why all this was
[1:41:30] sent for.
[1:41:32] Malachi 4.
[1:41:35] A lot of us for many years, we focus
[1:41:38] Malachi 4 only on the the messenger of
[1:41:41] Malachi 4. And we miss that little
[1:41:45] three-letter word.
[1:41:47] We miss that most important word in that
[1:41:50] entire scripture. Behold, I send you.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; I send you. It's got to be personal to
[1:42:02] you this morning that he's sending you a
[1:42:06] messenger that turns your heart from
[1:42:08] unbelief to believing, from not trusting
[1:42:10] to trusting. And and this revelation has
[1:42:14] to be the mo utmost importance. It's got
[1:42:16] to be the most important thing. And it's
[1:42:19] not taught by intellectual knowledge.
[1:42:20] It's not taught by being able to, you
[1:42:22] know, put quote on top of quote or verse
[1:42:24] on top of verse. But it's going to take
[1:42:26] revelation to understand
[1:42:29] the mystery of God. And then the bride
[1:42:32] must see who she is. And brother B, I'm
[1:42:35] going to tell us in Christ a mystery as
[1:42:36] I keep going here just for a little bit
[1:42:39] more.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; Mercy Tim Puit spirit got all over me
[1:42:45] this morning.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; And I did study good.
[1:42:53] Ah mercy. I'm going to get in trouble
[1:42:54] for this.
[1:42:59] He said, "God's secret mystery."
[1:43:03] I got to figure out how in the time
[1:43:04] frame here I'm going to wrap all this
[1:43:06] up.
[1:43:07] What time did I start?
[1:43:10] Okay, it don't matter. We're good. We're
[1:43:11] in Virginia. We're going to have church.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; See, now God's secret mystery that he
[1:43:18] had before the world began. Clue in
[1:43:20] here. This is after the opening of the
[1:43:22] seals. It's a new book. Now his ministry
[1:43:26] begins to shift.
[1:43:28] Now he's focused on this mystery
[1:43:30] revelation of who you are. He knows who
[1:43:34] he is. He knows he's the Elijah.
[1:43:37] He knows his position. He knows his
[1:43:39] responsibility. He's got to get you
[1:43:41] ready. So listen what he says here now.
[1:43:44] back in the back part of God's mind,
[1:43:46] there was something that he was trying
[1:43:48] that he was going to achieve and he had
[1:43:50] a motive in doing it in order to let
[1:43:52] himself be expressed.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; So in the back part of God's mind, he
[1:43:58] had thoughts.
[1:44:00] He had attributes. But let me tell you,
[1:44:02] never has it been before that God will
[1:44:05] send a man on earth that will reach into
[1:44:08] the very back part of God's mind and
[1:44:10] bring his thoughts to the forefront and
[1:44:13] reveal them to a people. But God in this
[1:44:16] generation, in this dispensation, in the
[1:44:19] finality of all the Gentile
[1:44:21] dispensation, he's in a vindicated
[1:44:24] prophet that would go into the very back
[1:44:26] part of God's mind and begin to reveal
[1:44:29] that that little bride, she was a
[1:44:32] thought in God's mind before the
[1:44:34] foundation of the world. That's where
[1:44:36] you were before the first sin ever came.
[1:44:39] Before the first atom and molecules ever
[1:44:41] blew off his hand, you were in God's
[1:44:44] thinking then.
[1:44:49] no other age.
[1:44:51] So God's greatest desire, how many wants
[1:44:55] to know God's greatest desire?
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Keep your hand up. It's you.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; God's greatest desire. I didn't tell you
[1:45:10] put your hands down.
[1:45:12] Simon says and I'm Simon
[1:45:17] under the alias of Joe. You can put your
[1:45:18] hands down,
[1:45:20] very well-trained students.
[1:45:26] But notice God's God's greatest. You
[1:45:29] know, we we read about great men,
[1:45:31] brother Ron, in the Bible, men like
[1:45:33] Shamgar. I think he and I are twins.
[1:45:37] Me, him, and Andrew. Anyway,
[1:45:40] don't get the two of us together. If we
[1:45:41] done done that, we got stories to tell,
[1:45:44] but we ain't tell them in church.
[1:45:49] Better not. But God's great desire,
[1:45:53] his predominant or prevailing thought is
[1:45:57] you.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Can I tell on myself? I'm going to tell
[1:46:01] them myself now.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; First time I walked in the Evening Light
[1:46:05] Tabernacle,
[1:46:07] it's like, "Oh, yeah." I thought I I'll
[1:46:10] be honest. I thought I was better than
[1:46:11] everybody there. Shame on me.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; I'm just being honest. I thought a bunch
[1:46:16] of old Backwoods country hick church. I
[1:46:19] come a long way, guys.
[1:46:22] A long way.
[1:46:24] And I come in there and then all of a
[1:46:25] sudden some little young lady.
[1:46:30] I ain't going to point
[1:46:34] right there. She is.
[1:46:37] She took a liking.
[1:46:40] She liked what she saw.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Hey girl, I don't blame you.
[1:46:49] [Applause]
[1:46:59] And I like what I saw.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; So we begin. I remember the first time I
[1:47:07] asked her, "You want to ride with me?" I
[1:47:09] remember that. You want to ride? I had
[1:47:11] to. She said, "You got to get the door."
[1:47:14] Weston, good job. So I got the door and
[1:47:17] from that point, that's all I could
[1:47:20] think about.
[1:47:22] I had to make her my bride.
[1:47:25] I mean, she looked good. She sang good.
[1:47:28] Amen.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; She smelt good.
[1:47:33] Hey, she had everything going in her
[1:47:36] favor.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; See, why are you saying this, brother?
[1:47:40] Cuz all I could think about was Jessica
[1:47:43] Shaw.
[1:47:45] I laid down thinking about her. I can't
[1:47:48] wait to talk to her again. I can't wait
[1:47:51] to church. Okay, I wanted to go to the
[1:47:53] house of God, but
[1:47:55] I had an ulterior motive in going,
[1:47:58] "Don't Hey, don't look at me like I'm
[1:48:00] dumb. Some of y'all been in the same
[1:48:01] spot, and some y'all drove three hours
[1:48:04] just to see her."
[1:48:07] But it was all I could think about. Now,
[1:48:09] if that's in the natural,
[1:48:12] and yet
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; in the back part of God's mind, there
[1:48:16] laid the mystery of bride,
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; an end time elect.
[1:48:22] She's perfect.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; She looks good.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; She dressed right.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; She smells right.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Oh my. All he can think about is the
[1:48:36] manifestation
[1:48:38] of that bride.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; His most predominant thought is you.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; It's not a Ron Spencer and Andrew or
[1:48:48] Matt or Joe or any great preacher. We're
[1:48:51] just subjects.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; We're part of that bride body. And like
[1:48:56] William Brandom is part of that bride
[1:48:57] body. But his most predominant thought,
[1:49:01] his crowning achievement is you.
[1:49:06] So much so that a prophet would preach
[1:49:08] the masterpiece.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't about him,
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; but it was about them.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; You are the masterpiece of God.
[1:49:21] God making known the mystery of his
[1:49:24] will.
[1:49:29] And I agree that we need a prophet. I'm
[1:49:31] not going to ever say we don't. I'm
[1:49:33] thankful for this prophet.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; If it wasn't for this prophet, we
[1:49:37] wouldn't know who we are.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; But church, you got to put your eyes
[1:49:42] also on who you are.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; And don't take for granted that God has
[1:49:49] called you in this hour.
[1:49:51] young person, you can't take for granted
[1:49:54] that you were born into the family in
[1:49:56] which you were born into. God
[1:49:58] predestinated that seed to come through
[1:50:01] that lineage so that you could hear this
[1:50:03] message in this hour.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Because notice, he's preparing a people
[1:50:08] for a change, for a rapture. That's the
[1:50:11] purpose of the message.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; It's not to elevate man. It's not to
[1:50:16] elevate ministries. It's not to elevate
[1:50:18] gifts. is to elevate Christ. And by
[1:50:21] elevating Christ, he's going to elevate
[1:50:23] and ascend a bride.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Listen what he says. Now, in his great
[1:50:28] mind, can I keep going? Yes, I can.
[1:50:30] Thank you.
[1:50:33] In his great mind, he wanted these
[1:50:35] attributes to be expressed.
[1:50:38] In him was love.
[1:50:40] In him was a father. In him was a son.
[1:50:43] In him was a savior. In him was to be a
[1:50:45] healer. All these great attributes that
[1:50:48] we see already expressed, they were in
[1:50:50] God. In another place, he would say
[1:50:52] these attributes are the thoughts of
[1:50:54] God.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; So you were the very thought of God.
[1:51:00] And so notice he but in him was love. He
[1:51:03] needed somebody to love him. He was not
[1:51:04] even God at this time. He was only an
[1:51:06] object of worship. And so the first
[1:51:09] thing that he did, he created angels.
[1:51:11] And angels begin to worship God. and
[1:51:14] holy, holy, holy. But even with the
[1:51:17] angels, God was not pleased. There was
[1:51:20] still something missing. Brother Ron, in
[1:51:22] the heart of God, God wanted to be more
[1:51:25] than just worship. God wanted to be
[1:51:28] loved.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, father, husband,
[1:51:32] whoever you are, I appreciate that your
[1:51:34] wife adores you and maybe she worships
[1:51:36] you, but it's got to be more than just
[1:51:38] worship. I want my wife to love me.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; And God wants his wife to love him
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; to reciprocate that love that he has for
[1:51:50] her. He wants it in return.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; But he was not God. And so he created
[1:52:00] the angels and here they are. They come
[1:52:02] and worship him. And but he wanted a
[1:52:04] bride. And he would tell us in Genesis
[1:52:07] that, "Oh, it's good that man shall not
[1:52:10] dwell alone."
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Cuz see, God knew what it meant, brother
[1:52:14] Matt, to dwell with his thoughts,
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; to not be loved, to not be worshiped. So
[1:52:20] he created Adam and he looked at Adam
[1:52:22] and Adam being an offspring of God, he
[1:52:24] had the same genetic strain. And inside
[1:52:26] of Adam, he looked at all the other
[1:52:28] human or not humanity, but all the other
[1:52:30] animal life. And all of them had a mate.
[1:52:33] But Adam didn't have a mate. He didn't
[1:52:35] have anyone to share his love with in
[1:52:37] his life with. So God put Adam to sleep.
[1:52:40] And from his rib, he made a helpmate.
[1:52:43] And see, that's what God is looking for
[1:52:45] is a helpmate. And he began to reveal it
[1:52:48] in every type of the Bible. And brother
[1:52:50] Bam said, "Therefore, the whole Bible is
[1:52:51] a revelation of God's mystery in Christ.
[1:52:53] The entire Bible is an expression of one
[1:52:56] goal that God had."
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; One goal.
[1:53:01] One goal. one goal, one purpose he
[1:53:05] wanted to achieve in the entire Bible.
[1:53:08] If you go read the Old Testament and he
[1:53:10] begin to show you Moses and Zapora,
[1:53:14] Joseph and a gentile bride, Boaz and a
[1:53:18] Moabitete, Ruth, Rahab the harlot
[1:53:21] marrying Salmon the general, Hosea
[1:53:23] taking a wife or the whoredom, Abraham
[1:53:25] and Sarah being translated back to young
[1:53:28] with a promise to bring forth the
[1:53:29] promised son. Every type in the Bible,
[1:53:33] God's showing, I'm going to take a
[1:53:36] gentile wife.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; One goal, brother Ron,
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; one purpose. That word, remember the
[1:53:46] mystery of his will. That word will is
[1:53:49] purpose.
[1:53:51] And it's been a mystery,
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; but he's typed it out down through the
[1:53:55] scriptures. But in this final age,
[1:54:00] through a vindicated prophet, a
[1:54:02] messenger, he be to tie all the loose
[1:54:06] sins. Hey, I'm up here.
[1:54:09] Everybody get back in check.
[1:54:14] Preaching's going on up here. Crying's
[1:54:16] going on over there. It's different.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; But we find everything that God has
[1:54:24] done. He's typed it out. And in this
[1:54:27] final age, in this final day, in Satan's
[1:54:32] Eden, he's going to call out a gentile
[1:54:35] wife.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; And he said that before the foundation
[1:54:41] of the world, he slipped on your finger.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; It wasn't when you came to the altar. It
[1:54:46] wasn't when you joined Full Gospel
[1:54:48] Lighthouse. It wasn't when you came to
[1:54:50] Even Light Tabernacle. It's not when you
[1:54:51] went to Jeffersonville. It's not when
[1:54:53] you came in contact with the message,
[1:54:55] but before the foundation of the world,
[1:54:57] he put that wedding ban of predestinated
[1:54:59] unmarited favor on your finger.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, he says, "I'm going to marry
[1:55:05] you."
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Placed it on you. He and he's going to
[1:55:09] bring that bride, those thoughts,
[1:55:11] brother Andrew, to the forefront.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; He's not ashamed
[1:55:16] of you.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:19] He's not ashamed to call you bride.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; In so much so, brother Matt, that he
[1:55:26] would tell a prophet, "I no longer call
[1:55:27] you church,
[1:55:30] but I'm calling you bride.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; You're part of me. You came from me. You
[1:55:36] were in my thoughts. And no time has it
[1:55:39] ever been before in any other previous
[1:55:42] ages has a prophet risen up and gone
[1:55:45] into the back part of God's mind."
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he did it for you.
[1:55:51] Can I keep going?
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; Colossians 1:27. To whom God will make
[1:55:55] known what is the riches of his glory,
[1:55:58] which is the mystery of the Gentiles,
[1:56:00] which is Christ in you. See, here's the
[1:56:04] mystery. Christ in you.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Look at your neighbor.
[1:56:10] Man, that's a mystery, ain't it?
[1:56:13] Amen.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Don't say yeah.
[1:56:20] Get yourself in trouble on Sunday
[1:56:22] morning.
[1:56:26] Not as a Now, I know some of y'all took
[1:56:28] that wrong. You thought I was saying
[1:56:29] your neighbor was ugly, but I never said
[1:56:30] that.
[1:56:34] But it's a mystery how that God can be
[1:56:38] hidden behind that vessel,
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; behind that veil. Cuz see Jeremy,
[1:56:45] do you know Amy? Amy, you know Jeremy?
[1:56:50] That's a yes. Y'all are married, right?
[1:56:54] April.
[1:56:56] I had him with the wrong wife.
[1:57:00] That bro wasn't going to say amen to
[1:57:01] nothing. I don't know who Amy is.
[1:57:04] That ain't no spirit of discernment up
[1:57:06] here. I can tell you that.
[1:57:09] Sorry, Sister A. April.
[1:57:14] Let me start that over. Jeremy, you know
[1:57:17] April.
[1:57:19] April, you know Jeremy.
[1:57:22] See, you know him better than anybody
[1:57:24] else in this room.
[1:57:27] And you know her better than anybody
[1:57:29] else in this room. You know what makes
[1:57:32] her tick.
[1:57:34] And she knows what button.
[1:57:40] Because you sisters have a way of
[1:57:41] pushing the button
[1:57:44] and it's not the eject button.
[1:57:48] It's a get mad quick button. I don't
[1:57:50] know how y'all figured that one out.
[1:57:55] But you know, and but yet behind that is
[1:57:58] a mystery is Christ.
[1:58:04] It's a mystery is Christ is behind that
[1:58:06] vessel and all their weaknesses and all
[1:58:09] their shortcomings and all their
[1:58:10] imperfections.
[1:58:13] Yet Christ,
[1:58:16] I'm so thankful, brother Ron, that
[1:58:17] Christ lives in our humanity.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; That deity, he would choose deity would
[1:58:25] come and tabernacle our humanity.
[1:58:30] We were all headed
[1:58:32] to a sinner's hell, our grave, and a
[1:58:37] devil's hell. But yet God, rich in
[1:58:39] mercy,
[1:58:41] had already saw you, predetermined you,
[1:58:45] placed his wedding band of unmmerited
[1:58:47] favor on your finger and he's keeping
[1:58:50] you from that. So we go on, as I said,
[1:58:53] what a perfect, brother says, what a
[1:58:55] perfect type of Christ, his deity, his
[1:58:57] love. He came forth into the world and
[1:59:00] laid himself over humanity,
[1:59:04] his church, his believers. Moses had
[1:59:07] them partly. David had them partly, but
[1:59:09] now he's talking about Jesus. But here,
[1:59:11] deity himself standing on earth, God in
[1:59:14] the fullness to die for the sin of the
[1:59:16] people. So God wouldn't let you continue
[1:59:19] down that road. He came.
[1:59:22] And sometimes we even and I please help
[1:59:25] me then understand the way I'm going to
[1:59:26] mean this. But even Jesus's appearing
[1:59:29] and him coming and paying that
[1:59:31] sacrificial
[1:59:32] sacrifice, it wasn't all about him. It
[1:59:35] wasn't about God proving that he can
[1:59:37] transcend and God can come and create a
[1:59:40] body and live in a body. It was more
[1:59:42] than just God coming from the great
[1:59:44] eternities and manufacturing or creating
[1:59:47] a body to step into and live in. But God
[1:59:50] created that body for one purpose is so
[1:59:53] that he could pay the sin debt that you
[1:59:55] couldn't pay.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Everything, church, that God has ever
[1:59:59] done, even sending forth Jesus Christ to
[2:00:02] pay for the sin that you couldn't pay.
[2:00:05] It was so that God could take a wife, so
[2:00:07] that God could take a bride, so that God
[2:00:10] could share his love with somebody.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; It's always been about you.
[2:00:17] Even in Jesus's coming, he had thoughts
[2:00:20] of being a healer. There had to be
[2:00:21] somebody to heal. Thoughts of being a
[2:00:23] deliverer, there had to be somebody to
[2:00:25] deliver. Thoughts of being a father,
[2:00:27] there had to be somebody that would,
[2:00:29] excuse me, accept him as his father and
[2:00:31] be sons of God. God didn't manifest
[2:00:33] himself in Jesus just to prove that he
[2:00:36] can become a man.
[2:00:39] I know that's a strong statement.
[2:00:41] I know many people may click that out
[2:00:43] and say, "Oh, brother Joe, don't even
[2:00:44] believe in Jesus Christ that he's a
[2:00:46] predominant one." I absolutely believe
[2:00:47] it.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; But I believe he had a purpose and I
[2:00:51] believe he had a plan and I believe he
[2:00:53] had a will. And you are the heart
[2:00:56] purpose of God.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, why would he come?
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; Why would he die?
[2:01:04] See, he became Jesus because of you.
[2:01:10] you mystery bride
[2:01:13] was what he was thinking of when he
[2:01:15] wanted sons and daughters of God. He
[2:01:18] came to heal you. He came to deliver
[2:01:19] you. He came to restore you. Came to
[2:01:21] reveal himself to you. He came to not
[2:01:23] only reveal himself, but he came to
[2:01:24] reveal who you are. He came to
[2:01:27] positionally
[2:01:29] place you as sons and daughters of God.
[2:01:33] I'm going to caveat just for a minute
[2:01:35] and I'm going to come back and we're
[2:01:36] going to start parachuting down. You
[2:01:39] know how they do in them 747s.
[2:01:41] They pull back a little bit and you feel
[2:01:42] a plane slow down a little bit. We're
[2:01:44] going to slow down a little bit because
[2:01:45] we coming to a landing. Now, don't get
[2:01:48] on the ground before I do.
[2:01:50] Don't open up the emergency doors and
[2:01:52] bail out on me. We're not done yet.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; I said we coming to Atlanta. Notice he
[2:01:58] came to positionally place
[2:02:02] Methodist,
[2:02:04] Baptist,
[2:02:06] Pentecostal, apostolic,
[2:02:10] different ones in the body.
[2:02:14] Said, "No longer give you a spirit of
[2:02:15] fear, but I give you a spirit of
[2:02:16] adoption."
[2:02:19] What is adoption, Brother Joe? It's the
[2:02:21] placing of a son.
[2:02:24] See, as a parent, there's a term out
[2:02:26] there. You can go look it up. It's
[2:02:28] called disownment.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; And as a parent, you can have a snotty
[2:02:34] little kid grows up into a wretched
[2:02:37] individual and you can disown that son
[2:02:40] or that daughter.
[2:02:43] You can disown them. Write them out.
[2:02:46] Sever ties with them never to do
[2:02:48] anything else with them ever again. like
[2:02:51] they never existed, never was a part of
[2:02:52] your family.
[2:02:55] But an adopted child, see, there's
[2:02:58] legalities to adopt a child. There's
[2:03:01] paperwork, there's time, there's things
[2:03:03] that has to go through, guys. It has to
[2:03:05] go through the legal system. But once
[2:03:07] that adoption has been made, and this is
[2:03:09] in the natural, and once that adoption
[2:03:11] has been clear, then you get all the
[2:03:14] rights as if you were the natural parent
[2:03:16] of that adopted child. And notice that
[2:03:18] adoption was to be permanent, never
[2:03:22] severed, never never broken.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; So why are you saying this, brother?
[2:03:29] Because I'm telling you that in the
[2:03:30] legalities of adopted children that an
[2:03:33] adopted child can never be unadopted.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; There's no legal process to unadopt a
[2:03:41] child once there's been adopted. What am
[2:03:43] I telling you? I'm telling you, if
[2:03:44] that's in the natural, then what about
[2:03:46] the spiritual? If God came in this hour
[2:03:49] and placed you as adopted sons and
[2:03:52] daughters of God, then God cannot
[2:03:54] unadopt you. But God's positioned you.
[2:03:58] He's placed you as his son, as his
[2:04:01] daughter, as his bridal this last day.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; He's not going to give up on you. He's
[2:04:06] not going to disown you and throw you
[2:04:09] away.
[2:04:11] But he quickens you with the Holy Spirit
[2:04:14] and places you in the family of God.
[2:04:17] My what a great revelation.
[2:04:21] But he said he had one purpose and I'm
[2:04:22] going to speed up through the rest of
[2:04:23] this. And through that purpose, let me
[2:04:27] back up. He said, "What was Jesus
[2:04:29] manifested for? To show God that he was
[2:04:32] God." And through that purpose, he
[2:04:33] achieved the church that he the fullness
[2:04:35] of God might bring to pass every
[2:04:37] promised word of God in the last days.
[2:04:40] when he gets the preeminence now the
[2:04:42] preeminence in the church the position
[2:04:46] his place in the church Jesus said he
[2:04:48] that believeth on me and the works that
[2:04:49] I do shall he do also even more than
[2:04:51] this shall he do for I go unto my father
[2:04:53] see that was his purpose there was a
[2:04:56] manifestation and now today he wants to
[2:04:58] get somebody that can that can see it
[2:05:01] that they can let the word otherwise let
[2:05:04] the word flow out in their life so the
[2:05:06] church becomes the word he says Now, he
[2:05:10] sanctified his spirit and the blood and
[2:05:12] the church that he might make every
[2:05:14] promise in the last days revealed. But
[2:05:16] he had a three-fold purpose, brother
[2:05:18] Ron. See, first he wanted God wanted to
[2:05:21] reveal himself to the people. He can
[2:05:23] only do that through Jesus Christ.
[2:05:26] Secondly, he wanted a premise in a body
[2:05:28] of believers, that is the bride, that he
[2:05:30] might live in a people. And third, to
[2:05:32] restore Eden, bring her back which was
[2:05:34] lost. That was the only thing that was
[2:05:36] out of order. So God came and manifested
[2:05:39] in the form of Jesus Christ and to have
[2:05:42] preeminence in the body of believers so
[2:05:44] that the bride and groom can go back to
[2:05:46] glory again back into the back part of
[2:05:49] God's mind. And that's what God has
[2:05:51] done. That's why he has sent you a
[2:05:53] message
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; and so that you can see where you came
[2:05:56] from. And if you can ever see where you
[2:05:59] came from, all the trials of this life
[2:06:01] will be nothing. Because why? Because I
[2:06:03] come from God. I'm going back to God. No
[2:06:06] cancer, no sickness, no trial, nothing
[2:06:09] can destroy that. I come from the very
[2:06:11] recesses of God's great thinking. I'm
[2:06:14] going back there, church. And Satan
[2:06:17] don't have enough. Hell don't have
[2:06:19] enough. Leodysia don't have enough. Oh,
[2:06:21] Virginia don't have enough. Louisiana
[2:06:24] don't have enough. This world don't have
[2:06:25] enough to keep us bound. We're going
[2:06:29] back to God because the mystery of God
[2:06:32] has been made known to a people.
[2:06:38] the anointed man. Now,
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; the anointed people. Hallelujah.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; Let me bring this down.
[2:06:47] God, he says, "And why cross feet?" God
[2:06:50] has got a purpose of you being here.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; You be like, I wish he'd tell me.
[2:07:00] He goes, "If you can only be get to the
[2:07:03] place, how much trouble would you save
[2:07:05] God and yourself?"
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; What is my purpose? This would be the
[2:07:11] manifestation
[2:07:13] of the word.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; All heaven,
[2:07:18] all creation is groaning,
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; groaning
[2:07:23] in pains for what? For the manifestation
[2:07:27] of the sons of God.
[2:07:29] Do you realize
[2:07:32] every tree, every animal, botney life,
[2:07:35] animal life is waiting on you?
[2:07:38] Some of you need to get your stuff
[2:07:39] together.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; Waiting on you
[2:07:44] to come into the manifestation of what
[2:07:47] God has called you to be.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; Never let this word be secondary.
[2:07:57] Never let it just be some byproduct.
[2:08:02] It has to be a priority.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; And priority number one,
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; the word of the hour.
[2:08:10] Hey, there may be times, wife, you may
[2:08:12] have to pull, kick, scream, kick, prod,
[2:08:15] whatever to get that man to church, but
[2:08:18] you get him there. Husband, it may be
[2:08:20] the same. You going to have to kick. Or
[2:08:23] maybe we don't kick. What we do is we
[2:08:24] promise. I take you shopping.
[2:08:29] I love shopping. I don't know how we get
[2:08:32] kicked. They go shopping.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. April looked at you then.
[2:08:39] I caught that. Yeah. I didn't get your
[2:08:42] name wrong that time.
[2:08:48] We do everything.
[2:08:50] And I look, we we we're humans, right?
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; We struggle sometimes. We're walking
[2:08:55] through those doors.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; Don't say that too loud. Your pastor's
[2:09:00] right here.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; But it's true. This humanity gets in the
[2:09:04] way. But if you can ever catch the
[2:09:07] revelation that the life that we now
[2:09:10] live, as Paul would say, I live by the
[2:09:12] faith of the son of God who loved me and
[2:09:15] gave him his life to me. We're not
[2:09:17] living this just because some favorite
[2:09:19] preacher or some, you know, whatever it
[2:09:21] may be. We're living this because Christ
[2:09:23] has come and tabernacled our humanity.
[2:09:28] So, not only did God have a purpose for
[2:09:30] Christ coming, but he has a purpose for
[2:09:31] your coming.
[2:09:33] Somebody's going to prove to devil that
[2:09:36] in Leodysia, he's going to have a
[2:09:38] church.
[2:09:40] Now, I know your your assistant pastor,
[2:09:42] he and I preached together, and he took
[2:09:44] a thought that I'd said, and I'm not
[2:09:46] going to go with it, but Satan borrowed
[2:09:48] a body.
[2:09:51] But God's also borrowing a body.
[2:09:55] And let me ask you, who's got a stronger
[2:09:57] body?
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; Who's got a greater body? He had one.
[2:10:02] God's got many.
[2:10:05] And if he with one can cause the fall,
[2:10:08] what can God do with many?
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; He can cause a rapture.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; He can call a rapture.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; Who you think's going to call this
[2:10:16] rapture? Brother Brandham ain't coming
[2:10:17] back to call the rapture.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; No, you're going to call that rapture.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; You're going to Your longing to be there
[2:10:25] is going to be so intense and so great,
[2:10:27] you're going to call that body change
[2:10:28] down.
[2:10:30] One minute you will be, the next minute
[2:10:31] you will not be anymore.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; Let me bring this down. Musicians, you
[2:10:36] can make your way back. Told you I was
[2:10:38] slowing that plane down.
[2:10:42] Brother tell us the law of the kinsman
[2:10:46] redeemer
[2:10:47] required
[2:10:49] or the law required a kinsman redeemer.
[2:10:51] The law of God required a kinsman
[2:10:53] redeemer.
[2:10:55] And he said grace met God's requirement
[2:10:58] in the person of Jesus Christ. See the
[2:11:01] law required it and grace met the
[2:11:04] requirement. And he said the kinsman
[2:11:06] redeemer first must be born of the human
[2:11:08] race and the virgin birth produce our
[2:11:12] kinsman redeemer
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; and he come as the lamb of god. God's
[2:11:17] law brother says required a kinsman
[2:11:19] redeemer. And the lamb come out holding
[2:11:21] it. He says I am their kinsman. I am
[2:11:23] their redeemer. I have made intercession
[2:11:25] for them and now I have come to claim
[2:11:28] their rights for them. Notice church,
[2:11:30] there's only one. I've come to claim
[2:11:32] their rights and that that I have a
[2:11:34] right to everything that lost in the
[2:11:36] fall. I paid the price. God has come to
[2:11:39] claim you in this hour. That's why you
[2:11:42] can receive a message.
[2:11:45] That's why your heart can be open to the
[2:11:48] mystery of God.
[2:11:51] Brother Bam said he died to res to
[2:11:53] resurrect his bride.
[2:11:57] Some of you may be questioned. How many
[2:11:59] you've ever had a question you didn't
[2:12:01] have an answer to?
[2:12:02] [Music]
[2:12:04] You felt embarrassed.
[2:12:07] Man, I should know that. I should know
[2:12:09] the answer.
[2:12:11] But there's times that we find ourselves
[2:12:13] without the answer.
[2:12:16] And we find generations that's gone
[2:12:18] before us didn't have the answer.
[2:12:22] But God sent a prophet and he said we
[2:12:24] now now we have the answer to the
[2:12:27] devil's question cuz down through six
[2:12:30] previous ages down into this leis and
[2:12:33] age he has questioned the validity of
[2:12:36] this bride.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; He's questioned your coming. He's
[2:12:40] questioned your integrity. He's in
[2:12:41] question your dedication to the word.
[2:12:43] But the prophet of God said, "Now, now
[2:12:46] we have the devil, the answer to the
[2:12:48] devil's question, that the headship has
[2:12:50] come and there's been an invisible union
[2:12:52] with the bride. That we're not going to
[2:12:54] stay here, church, but we're going to
[2:12:55] transcend and go back to our heavenly
[2:12:58] home, back where we came from. Now we
[2:13:01] have the answer. Now, this day, this
[2:13:03] moment, the revelation of the mystery of
[2:13:06] God's purpose and God's plan has been
[2:13:09] made known to a bride, to a
[2:13:10] predestinated, a lake seat of God. The
[2:13:14] marriage is at hand, church. God's
[2:13:17] three-fold revelation, God in Christ,
[2:13:19] God in his church, and we're going back
[2:13:21] to a kingdom. Oh, we have the answer to
[2:13:25] the devil's question. Not me that
[2:13:28] liveth, but Christ.
[2:13:31] That's why it's paramount that you young
[2:13:33] people get the Holy Ghost. Don't settle
[2:13:36] for a shout. Don't settle for a tear.
[2:13:38] Don't settle for a goosebump. You make
[2:13:41] sure you get the Holy Ghost. You make
[2:13:43] sure mom and dad, you get the Holy
[2:13:45] Ghost. And you preach Jesus Christ in
[2:13:47] that home and create an atmosphere
[2:13:51] for the presence of the angel, the Lord
[2:13:53] can come into your home and begin to
[2:13:56] move.
[2:13:58] One of the greatest compliments my
[2:14:00] family ever gave me, Brother Ron, and
[2:14:02] all my years of preaching.
[2:14:06] They said, "We want a home just like
[2:14:09] this."
[2:14:11] Just like this.
[2:14:13] [Music]
[2:14:14] There's laughter in that home.
[2:14:19] There's joy in that home.
[2:14:25] There's boundaries
[2:14:27] in that home.
[2:14:29] Why is that? Because there's Christ in
[2:14:32] the marriage.
[2:14:34] There's Christ in the home.
[2:14:39] Greatest compliment, Brother Chris, my
[2:14:40] kids gave me in all my years of
[2:14:42] ministry. I've cast out devils, Brother
[2:14:44] Ron. I've seen sick healed. I've done
[2:14:46] I've been uh been in great wonderful
[2:14:48] meetings. But that's the greatest
[2:14:50] compliment that's ever been given.
[2:14:53] [Music]
[2:14:55] What about Christ? What about his bride?
[2:14:58] As I begin to close this out, what Bible
[2:15:00] said, we stand justified in Christ.
[2:15:03] He said, justified in his sight. We are
[2:15:06] justified. We are his victory. The
[2:15:10] church is his victory. We come forth in
[2:15:15] the last days with the glorious gospel
[2:15:17] showing his victory. He died for this
[2:15:20] purpose
[2:15:21] and we are the proof of his victory.
[2:15:26] Oh, I love that. When we see him coming
[2:15:28] down and living among the church, that's
[2:15:31] the victory. Shows that he couldn't keep
[2:15:33] him in the grave and neither can he keep
[2:15:35] us in the grave.
[2:15:38] Oh, so the same word that moves from the
[2:15:40] head as a day comes to a close down into
[2:15:43] the body down into the body vindicating
[2:15:45] that they are one. Oh, here it is,
[2:15:48] church. He said, "There's been churches,
[2:15:50] churches, brides, brides, but there has
[2:15:52] to come one." Oh, come on, full gospel.
[2:15:55] I said, "There's been churches,
[2:15:56] churches, and brides, brides, but there
[2:15:59] must come one. There must come a bride
[2:16:01] of this last day who's the fulfillment
[2:16:04] of all that's been wrote up concerning
[2:16:06] the bride." And can I tell you, you are
[2:16:08] that bride. You are that manifestation
[2:16:11] of the bride of Jesus Christ. He's not
[2:16:14] coming for another. He's coming for you.
[2:16:16] Let's worship him this morning. Little
[2:16:18] bride, this is your moment. This is your
[2:16:21] hour. This is your time to give God
[2:16:23] praise. Let me tell you, she's bone of
[2:16:25] his bone, life of his life. She is him.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; I said she is him. She is the revealing
[2:16:33] of the mystery of God.
[2:16:37] He's hid it.
[2:16:40] But now it's in plain view.
[2:16:43] [Music]
[2:16:44] I said, "Now it's in plain view. He's
[2:16:48] not hiding you anymore. Now he's pushing
[2:16:51] you out. I'm going to have an elect. Do
[2:16:54] what you can, Satan. She won't fall like
[2:16:57] that first Eve fell, but she's going to
[2:16:59] stand the test.
[2:17:02] She is him."
[2:17:06] And he said, "Oh, how the bride
[2:17:10] loves to hold that promise."
[2:17:15] Honey, after 23 years,
[2:17:19] I hope you still
[2:17:22] love to be married to me.
[2:17:25] Right answer.
[2:17:29] And after 6,000 years
[2:17:33] and some 2,000 years of a gentile
[2:17:36] dispensation,
[2:17:38] I wonder, little bride, what is your
[2:17:41] answer?
[2:17:42] Lord, you made known to me the mystery.
[2:17:46] Everything's been about me,
[2:17:48] and now
[2:17:51] I'm in fulfillment. I'm here not just to
[2:17:54] be a churchgoer, not just to be a
[2:17:56] message believer, not just to agree that
[2:17:58] God sent a prophet, but to be the mer
[2:18:01] manifestation of the mystery,
[2:18:08] the very manifestation.
[2:18:12] Thou art my hiding place.
[2:18:20] He's here. I just felt it. Brother
[2:18:23] Andrew,
[2:18:30] you are hiding
[2:18:33] Elohim.
[2:18:37] with every
[2:18:39] head bowed and every eye closed just as
[2:18:42] we bring this to a close this morning.
[2:18:45] [Music]
[2:18:48] Thou
[2:18:50] are my Let these words come to your ears
[2:18:54] as if it's Jesus Christ himself speaking
[2:18:58] to you.
[2:19:01] Everything I ever done,
[2:19:03] every message I ever preached,
[2:19:07] every trial ever sent you away was for a
[2:19:09] purpose to call you, to form you, to
[2:19:13] fashion you, to shape you, to be my
[2:19:16] bride.
[2:19:18] Have I've come in this last day.
[2:19:22] And I'm making known to you, little
[2:19:23] bride. I'm whispering in your ear this
[2:19:26] secret mystery that I had before the
[2:19:28] foundation of the world. That you always
[2:19:31] were with me. And if you were ever with
[2:19:34] me, you always will be with me. I'm
[2:19:38] coming.
[2:19:40] I'm coming. Just a few more days, a few
[2:19:42] more sunsets, and I'm going to come and
[2:19:45] I'm going to change your body.
[2:19:48] I'm going to come and I'm going to
[2:19:49] transform you. That pest house that
[2:19:51] you're living in, you're not meant to
[2:19:53] live in that permanently. That cancer
[2:19:55] that's ravishing your body, one day it's
[2:19:57] going to leave behind and we're going to
[2:19:59] trans. We're going to take a step out of
[2:20:00] it and we're going to enter into a new
[2:20:02] body. Cuz where I am, there you may be
[2:20:05] also.
[2:20:07] The father in me, I and the father, you
[2:20:09] and me, and I in you, is the fulfillment
[2:20:12] of all the mystery of God. Father, we
[2:20:16] just come today, Lord. Want to say thank
[2:20:18] you for the time you've given us in your
[2:20:19] house, in your presence,
[2:20:23] Lord, I can just hear you say, "Thou
[2:20:26] thou art my hiding place.
[2:20:29] 5' 5 and 1/2 little vessel, Lord, but
[2:20:32] yet hiding the holiest of holies, God
[2:20:35] Almighty,
[2:20:36] manifesting the very
[2:20:39] mystery of the will of God." So, Father,
[2:20:43] we thank you this morning that you chose
[2:20:45] humanity to dwell in. You chose a bride,
[2:20:48] Lord God, from every aspect of life,
[2:20:52] every race, every creed, every tongue,
[2:20:54] every color. Lord, it has no uh
[2:20:57] implications upon your choice, God. You
[2:20:59] chose us all, Lord, to manifest
[2:21:03] an end time bride, Lord. and you showed
[2:21:06] us through the scriptures, Father, your
[2:21:08] purpose in your plan, choosing that
[2:21:11] Gentile,
[2:21:14] placing us in the family of God, placing
[2:21:16] us in the lineage of Christ. So Lord, I
[2:21:20] ask today that this word would begin to
[2:21:22] resonate and Lord, permeate their
[2:21:24] hearts, God. They will leave here with a
[2:21:28] Lord maybe a greater understanding of
[2:21:30] who they are,
[2:21:33] what you've called them to be, who
[2:21:34] you've called them to be. Father,
[2:21:37] Lord, manifest yourself. Reveal your
[2:21:40] great mystery in a greater way. Father,
[2:21:42] myself, my hands open to you up, Lord.
[2:21:46] I'm asking for greater understanding in
[2:21:47] this hour, Lord. Not just to be content
[2:21:50] on where I've been, Lord, the revelation
[2:21:52] that I've received, but Father, I want a
[2:21:54] greater understanding, a greater
[2:21:56] revelation, a greater outpouring,
[2:21:58] Father, of your spirit. And I'm asking
[2:22:00] that you would come, Lord God. Every
[2:22:02] hand lifted today, Lord. May you give a
[2:22:04] greater outpouring, Father, a greater,
[2:22:06] Lord, baptizing this morning, Lord, sons
[2:22:09] and daughters of God, Lord, fill their
[2:22:12] morning, Father, with your goodness and
[2:22:13] mercy and grace.
[2:22:16] We just ask Lord that that you would
[2:22:18] have your way now Lord as we close the
[2:22:20] service turn it back over to brother
[2:22:22] Andrew.
[2:22:25] We're so thankful God for a message
[2:22:29] for every messenger you ever sent Lord.
[2:22:31] every word that's ever been preached,
[2:22:34] Lord. Men like Ron Spencer and Tim Puit
[2:22:36] and Donnie Reagan and Wayne Lawson and
[2:22:39] Andrew Glover and Andrew Spencer and
[2:22:42] Matt Spencer and William Bolivan, Aaron
[2:22:44] Oglesby, Tim Timothy Puit, Joe Adams of
[2:22:48] the world, different ones, God, your
[2:22:49] great great ministries, David Mayers,
[2:22:52] men around the world, Lord, holding true
[2:22:55] to the word of God. And I pray God that
[2:22:57] in this hour, Satan's coming in. Lord,
[2:22:59] that's why your prophet said, "Satan's
[2:23:01] howling because we have the answer in
[2:23:03] this hour to the devil's question that
[2:23:05] the headship has come." And I'm asking
[2:23:08] God, not only come, but settle down on
[2:23:12] that bride body. Lord, change us.
[2:23:15] Father, I pray in Jesus name. Have your
[2:23:17] way, Lord. We bless you now in Jesus
[2:23:19] name. Amen.
[2:23:24] [Music]
[2:23:32] I have waited for this day
[2:23:37] that I could give to you my name.
[2:23:42] Eternity
[2:23:44] awaits us. Come away,
[2:23:49] my love. Oh, come away
[2:23:56] my love.
[2:24:01] Come away
[2:24:05] my love.
[2:24:10] I have waited for days
[2:24:14] and I could give to you my name.
[2:24:19] [Music]
[2:24:23] us.
[2:24:24] Come away.
[2:24:26] [Music]
[2:24:33] Lord, I come to you.
[2:24:38] Lord, I come to you.
[2:24:42] Well, let my heart be changed.
[2:24:47] Renew
[2:24:50] flowing from the grace
[2:24:55] that I found
[2:24:59] in you.
[2:25:09] Oh Lord, I've come to know
[2:25:15] the weaknesses I see
[2:25:20] in me
[2:25:24] will be stripped away
[2:25:28] [Music]
[2:25:32] by the power of your love.
[2:25:36] [Applause]
[2:25:39] Hallelujah.
[2:25:42] Oh,
[2:25:46] oh holy ghost.
[2:25:49] Oh, let your love surround
[2:25:53] [Music]
[2:25:56] me
[2:26:00] and breathe
[2:26:03] me.
[2:26:07] Oh, draw me to your side.
[2:26:15] Oh,
[2:26:17] and
[2:26:20] oh, as I
[2:26:24] rise above
[2:26:26] [Music]
[2:26:29] [Applause]
[2:26:30] [Music]
[2:26:32] and I will soar with you.
[2:26:36] Your spirit leads me on
[2:26:41] the power of your love.
[2:26:49] Oh Lord, unveil
[2:26:51] my eyes.
[2:26:55] Let me see your face
[2:27:00] to face
[2:27:03] the knowledge of your love
[2:27:09] as you.
[2:27:13] Oh.
[2:27:24] Oh Lord, renew my mind
[2:27:30] as your will unfold
[2:27:35] in my life
[2:27:38] in every day.
[2:27:47] By the power of your hallelujah.
[2:27:51] [Music]
[2:27:56] Oh
[2:27:58] [Music]
[2:28:03] ghost
[2:28:04] [Music]
[2:28:12] for me.
[2:28:17] [Music]

[2:28:23] Oh, draw me to your side.
[2:28:33] Oh,
[2:28:34] [Applause]
[2:28:35] [Music]
[2:28:37] oh, as I wait,
[2:28:41] I'll rise like you.

[2:28:49] and I'll soar with you.
[2:28:54] Your spirit leads me on
[2:28:58] in the power of your love.
[2:29:05] When the music fades
[2:29:09] and all is shrimp away
[2:29:12] and I simply
[2:29:14] come,
[2:29:21] longing just to breathe
[2:29:26] something that's a word
[2:29:30] that will bless your heart.
[2:29:38] I'll bring you more than a song.
[2:29:43] For a song in his head is not what you
[2:29:49] have required.
[2:29:56] You search what's deeper within
[2:30:02] through the way things appear.
[2:30:05] You're looking into my
[2:30:09] heart.
[2:30:11] [Music]
[2:30:14] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[2:30:22] And it's all about you.
[2:30:27] Yes, it's all about you, Jesus.
[2:30:32] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I made
[2:30:39] it. When it's all about you,
[2:30:45] it's all about you, Jesus.
[2:30:51] Oh, king of endless world.
[2:30:56] Oh, no one could express
[2:31:00] how much you deserve.
[2:31:04] [Music]
[2:31:06] [Applause]
[2:31:09] Oh, though I'm weak and poor.
[2:31:15] Oh, all I have is yours.
[2:31:19] Every single
[2:31:21] breath
[2:31:27] I'll bring you more than a song.
[2:31:32] For a song it is
[2:31:36] not what you have required.
[2:31:41] [Music]
[2:31:45] You search much deeper
[2:31:48] within
[2:31:51] through the way things appear.
[2:31:55] You're looking into my
[2:31:59] heart.
[2:32:04] I'm coming back to a heart of worship.
[2:32:12] It is all about you.
[2:32:16] Oh, it's all about you, Jesus.
[2:32:22] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I made.
[2:32:30] And it's all about you.
[2:32:35] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:32:42] Come live in me.
[2:32:46] Oh my life
[2:32:49] [Music]

[2:32:57] Come breathe in me
[2:33:01] and I will rise.

[2:33:17] all my life.

[2:33:56] I pray.
[2:34:02] Oh,
[2:34:04] here I am longing
[2:34:09] for you.
[2:34:19] Oh,
[2:34:21] hide me on your low
[2:34:27] and bring me to
[2:34:31] my knees.
[2:34:39] May I know Jesus
[2:34:43] more
[2:34:44] and more.
[2:34:48] Come and live in me, Lord Jesus.
[2:34:56] Come live in me
[2:35:02] all my life.

[2:44:57] we just ask that you just be remembering
[2:44:59] us and be remembering the entire Biscll
[2:45:01] family. Brother Bisll meant a whole lot
[2:45:03] to this congregation. And to be honest,
[2:45:06] if it wasn't for that man of God, a lot
[2:45:08] of things would be different about the
[2:45:10] dynamics of this church. And we
[2:45:12] appreciate the man of God and his family
[2:45:14] and what he has meant to us. And we just
[2:45:16] want to uh show our appreciation and our
[2:45:19] love to them in this time. And you know,
[2:45:21] you can be expecting our your loved one
[2:45:23] to go across on the other side, but when
[2:45:25] it happens, it just it just strikes
[2:45:26] different. And I tell you, heaven looks
[2:45:28] sweeter and sweeter more and more we go
[2:45:30] along this life's journey. We got a
[2:45:32] promise that one of these days we're
[2:45:33] going to walk down that little street
[2:45:35] and we're going to see everything that
[2:45:36] we've ever hoped for. Anything that ever
[2:45:39] loved him is going to be on that side. I
