Lord hear Mark 11 and 22. this is a familiar passage of scripture let's look here it says in Jesus answering Seth unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say to this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you that whatsoever ye desire when ye pray believe that you shall receive them and you shall have them and when ye stand praying forgive if ye have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you forgive not neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses I'd like to look at another place here in Hebrews 11 and 1. amen these are both familiar passages of scripture amen Hallelujah it says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report I'd like to go on down to the sixth verse for without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must first believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him I'd like to minister this morning on the challenge of faith let's go to the Lord in prayer father we thank you for your grace here this morning I thank you Lord for being with this allowing

Say Amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here this morning the challenge of faith and and it is quite a challenge amen but God's given us Faith to meet the challenge of this day now there the powers of darkness is here amount and we can't deny that the powers of Darkness are here and these powers are a challenge they are amen they're a challenge to your faith amen this is the last of the day this is the this will be the amen the going home of the church this is the time when amen it's it's a it's an incredible day of sin the prophet of God would tell us that man hell has come upon the Earth yeah and and we see it we've seen it with the virus we've seen it amen we see it with the economy there's so much uncertainty that is going on the people are uncertain everyone there's there's there no one knows what to do or how to invest they don't know how to do to do anything amen people are wondering how they're going to raise their families they they Wonder there are so many things and and and and yet I have I have seen too much fear within the church I've seen too much fear within our own ranks a man to where it seems like the whole thing has caught God off guard it would be as if God didn't know it was coming and and and that God can't fight her battles but I want to tell you today God is still God and God is still the great warrior God can you say man amen many many are looking Iman for for a great persecution before our faith can rise but I want to say faith come from the opening of the book we're not looking for a great trial we're not looking for a Great Tribulation we're not looking for these kinds of the well can you say Matt I know some people that feel like amen that you know you you you you you uh you you walk in humility you know and and walking in humility is to walk in defeat and amen you know and just and just be downtrodden by the devil but that ain't that that ain't walking in humility what can you say amen amen someone told me the other day she said well I just wanna I just want to be whatever the Lord wants If he if he wants me to be sick then I I want to be sick but I want to tell you it's God's will for you to be healed it's God's will for you to walk in Victory it's God's will for you to walk in Freedom can you say amen amen oh hallelujah amen it's a Beggar's mentality to hope that God is going to move somehow with compassion it's a Beggar's mentality Amen to say oh if the angel of the Lord would just stop by my way or amen if you just send a little healing for my sister send Lord if you could just spare a little bit of

say amen amen someone says we need more power I I I just I beg to differ with you I ask you what more power do you need it is here the word of God well praise the Lord now we want to associate the word with the preacher there's too many times when we're saying that amen well the preacher he's he's got all the Revelation but the Revelation has been given to the Bride of Jesus Christ and I want

Bible is manifested again like in the early days of Christ see cause you are a predestinated seed just like Christ was and when the rain falls on that seed the life produces itself when the Holy Ghost Falls I want to tell you Holy Ghost fall on this seed here you can look at the defeatism if you want you can look at your trial if you want you can look at this nasty world if you want or you can

can you say man amen what was Jesus commissioned to the to the original Church amen there in Mark 16 and 15. he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature brother Branham says not teach but preach demonstrate show that I'm real show that I'm alive show declare can you say man he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe how many believers do we have in the building Hallelujah Hallelujah I I just get you you can't you can't preach this without looking at brother Ron amen because what are we seeing a man that should have been dead three years ago only given four months to live you say oh my brother Wendell he still has cancer amen you are seeing a man in action you are

sword out I'm going to fight this is my day this is my hour I'm anointed to defeat the enemy come on Church we're seeing a general teaching us how to fight some of you can't even make it to church because you got a headache some of you can't even come to church because you had a bad hair day it's no wonder that Devil's whooping all over you all the time it's no wonder your children don't have victory in their heart it's no wonder there's no victory in the Church of God I say today it's time to square the shoulder and let the devil know I know who I am I know and whom I have believed and I am going to resist you [Applause] in a name somebody say in my name they'll cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not harm them and they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover foreign setting up here on the front row you might be saying how does it work if I just knew if I just knew how Ron Spencer makes this thing work there's there's some of you hey man my eye brother Wendell if I knew how it worked you don't need to know how it worked just believe in Who You Are [Applause] praise the Lord brother Branham says I don't know the mechanics of the Holy Ghost but I know it fell on me I can't tell the mechanics of it but I know the blessings of it that's all I care to know about is the blessings of the Holy Ghost and the mechanics he works them that is his secret [Music] I don't have to do it all I've got to do is believe it well praise the Lord I said praise the Lord Amen in the midst of the trial in the midst of the storm in the midst of laodicea in the midst of the demon oppressed World there is a church who is standing two to two with the Enemy and say I've been anointed to destroy the Yokes of the enemy another band said this boy couldn't be healed the disciples had power Jesus gave him power to heal all manners of sickness to cast out devils to cleanse the lepers and to raise the Dead he gave them the power but they didn't have faith to operate the power that they had how many's got the Holy Ghost Hallelujah Keep Your Hands Up Hallelujah now you know what that means if you've got the Holy Ghost that means that the Eternal Gene seed of God that's laying on the inside of that heart that was laying dormant has now been activated and energized that goes for you sis Hallelujah that goes for you young man [Applause] that goes for you can you say man Hallelujah it is there you've got to have the faith to believe it everything we yo it's easy to land on the preacher it's easy to lay it on the Evangelist it's easy to lay it on the Deacon but I'm here to tell you that God has equipped you Hallelujah these signs shall follow the preacher these signs shall follow the prophet these signs shall follow the rich these signs shall follow them that how many believers do we have in the building Hallelujah now he says they had power amen but they didn't have the faith to operate the word that was in them see what I mean but Jesus had it he was the word and he had faith that what he said would happen he said bring him here amen how long will I suffer you he had Faith with his power how did he he said I I can do nothing in myself why he relied upon what he was he relied in knowing he was the word he had faith in God who made him the word he was God the word they was that was in him and and he gave that give him Faith because he understood his position somebody say he understood his position he knew what he was because the scripture said what he was here every scripture tied in to prove that he was exactly what the scripture said he would be and he knew what he was therefore he relied on what God made him and if he did that then why can't we rely upon what God made us as believers no I'm preaching to somebody here he says these signs shall follow them that believe he had faith in what he was and if you're a Believer you have faith in what you are you're a Believer if you've got faith in God and the Bible says over here if our heart condemns us then we can't have faith but if our heart condemns us not then we have faith thank you some of you are saying yeah well Whoopi Doo whoopie doo I'm talking about the people that you might you you might be poor you might be illiterate you might be you might just be dumb Hallelujah but if you could realize and recognize who you is buddy there ain't no there ain't no way don't you die I want to tell you the devil knows when you know I said demons know when you know the enemy knows when you know they know when they've got to pull over you and they know when you're standing up against them they know when you're coward but they also know when you're taking up a name in the name of Jesus and you're standing there and you're saying I command that devil to leave my wife or to leave my child and bring well come on church I'm talking about a people that have been ordained of God we're not weak we're not beggarly we're not just our friends we are the very Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ I say we desert he deserves Glory and Honor [Applause] now the bride has never been more there has never been a greater identity to this bride and today that unsealed book has taken the cover off of you and God has openly declared Who You Are praise the Lord oh that that should make us want to entertain that word more than we've ever entertained him can you see man you see you're now living under the headship not of denomination not of not of another preacher you're not living under the headship of sin another man's opinion you're living under the headship of the Living Word and you know what the prophet of God said you are amen he says you are all glorious he said the Bride of Jesus Christ is as pure as Jesus Christ is her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her idea is found in him there is no fault found in hair she is his creation you know what that means let me if there's no condemnation then you can have total faith if the devil doesn't have any any chains on you doesn't have any amen holds on you then you can stand up and say I am who he says I am oh bless the Lord can you see me our identity has been swallowed up in the word Hallelujah we we lost our identity a long time ago we're his bride we've taken on his name we're we're not we're not living a name to ourself and him have his that's for the denominations but we are the Bride of Jesus Christ we are his very creation we're his word creation can you say Amen you know what that does that there is an eternal quality to the bride there is an eternal quality that no matter where you are and no matter what the circumstance is you are his and he is yours we'll praise the Lord the prophet says what he has she is manifesting on the Earth she has become a reflection of Jesus Christ your past is not even seen well praise the Lord because you're a new creation it's a word image it's a word creation the no longer that Hallelujah brother Branham says it like this he says from the beginning to the ending she is the work of her Lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God how can one fathom it how can one understand it though we cannot do it we can accept it by faith for God has spoken it can I hear a great big gay man and you're never going to have faith as long as you're identifying with your situation you've got to identify and you are word of his word oh come on now the glory of the Lord God sees God sees virtue in you God loves you even when you're in a when you're having a bad hair day amen even when everything is going wrong even when you feel like you don't have faith even when you feel like a man you're like Sarah and you're just questioning everything you just take yourself right back to that word and say I am not moving from that word God has spoken it and I believe it it don't matter what I feel it don't matter what I see it don't matter what the situation looks around me my children are going to be saved God is going to bring Victory I know it I know it I know it can you see man who identifying you are identifying yourself in him he's all Victorious therefore you're all Victorious he's all glorious there you're for therefore you're all glorious can you say man now I want to bring this in before I get to my get to my thought here because this challenge of Faith we've got to lose the identity of this baggage right here and we've got to accept that identity of him did you know that before Isaac could even come Sarah had to have a name change Hallelujah Abraham had to have a name change and God gave you a name change oh you're not a sinner you're a son of God I have a hard time saying I'm a sinner saved by grace I was a sinner been saved by grace now I am the Bride of Jesus Christ you can't be a sinner in the bride at the same time you can't be saved and lost at the same time you can't come on Church remember we're coming and setting in the pews and we're trying to regulate God by how we feel but how we see by their mistakes and by our our triumphs I want to say it's time for us to come and take him at his word his word is unfailing his word is our Victory his word will never fail can you say Amen therefore I stand upon God's word and I refuse to Bow I refuse to be in I refuse to give up God's anointed me to withstand the devil in this day I am the body of Jesus Christ here on the Earth [Applause] and you say Amen brother Madam said knowing who he was without a shadow of a doubt he knew he was the son of God he knew it for the word identified it buddy aren't you glad for a prophet that has come this day how many is glad that you can identify with scripture for this day come on Malachi Ford Revelations 10 7. Revelations 10 8. can you say Amen he says the word of God identified who he was he says if I do not the works of my father then Believe Me Not if I do them if I don't do them Works don't believe me but if I do then believe the works for they are the manifested word promised oh if you could just wake up to that a minute you see the word itself identified him who he was he said who can condemn me of sin in other words who can show me that my life and my Works don't fulfill exactly what the Messiah should do nobody could say nothing for he was then he had Faith to believe then of whatsoever he said it could happen and then he turned around and he said the works that I do shall you also a little while the world go uh well the world seeth me no more yet you shall because I'll be with you even in you take no thought what you shall say for it's not you that speaks it's the father that dwelleth in you he's the one that does the speaking it's not me it's the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works now the identification of a scripture Christian these words said Jesus these mine shall follow them that believe how can you call yourself a believer a people and deny those words how can you call yourself a Believer and deny any of this word you can't do it you're not a believer therefore the signs can't follow because you just accept what you want to believe and the rest of it what you don't believe it but you've got to take the whole thing and believe it and when you truly believe not make believe but really believe then those signs will follow them that belief oh compare a Christian today with those Christians long ago how does his disciples I walked in power of the spirit moved by the Holy Ghost to do it just a prisoner as I was preaching the other night he says wouldn't you like to see a church rise like that it's going to it's going back it's got to come that's your time just jump up and start shouting it's going to it's got to you know what I'm doing I'm just I'm just giving you a little shot in the arm you know what because who you are is who you are and there ain't nothing a preacher can do about it there ain't nothing the devil can do about it they're into all I can do is tell you who you are and to point you to the mirror of who you oh Hallelujah I'm glad to be a minister of the Gospel in this last day I'm glad to be able to preach this message you know what I'm doing I'm not changing nobody I am declaring unto you who you are well Glory Hallelujah [Applause] did you know the genetics of God are in you he says when a baby is conceived in the womb of a mother and when that one cell goes in there and another cell comes on top of that it's not one cell of a human and the next of a dog the next of a cat the next of something else it is absolutely straightly human being and when a man is born of the spirit of God punch your neighbor and say this is fixing to get good when a man is born of the spirit of God he don't inject anything into his life it's the unadulterated word of God Vindicated for that hour he takes the full word of God he don't put no Creeds nothing else to it it's purely an adulterated God's word made manifest Among Us now some of you may be still sitting here saying yeah yeah well we hear that a lot brother Wendell you know but but but but but brother Wendell but but no we ain't got no Billy Goats amen I'm preaching to the elect amen amen but I'm here but I'm here to tell you we need to bring those things down here to the altar and say I'm on a draw I'm gonna I'm gonna leave all those right

I'm going to believe God come on church amen this is there you say Amen I'd eat something deep this morning this is deep this is deep to where you can accept what God says about you regardless of what you're looking at come on Hallelujah but God has equipped you he's not equipped amen the denominations he's not equipped the others he's equipped his bride are you the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world there's too many that confused the bride with the whosoever will there is no destiny in whosoever will yes it's it's it's God's grace to the whosoevers yes it's God's mercy to the whosoevers yes God meant it when he said it yes there will be Millions who accept but there's no faith in whosoever will because they 'd be there [Applause] I pray that every one of them chooses life this message is that I'm preaching right now is going to whosoever Will but many are going to reject it how can you say man but the fact is if the germ seed of God is not in the soul when did that germ seed word get placed in that cell when you come to the altar when you were born in a preacher's family when did it happen well preach to me before the foundation of the world oh well I might not be there I might you're there [Applause] oh come on Church what did Romans 8 28 say Amen let me get to Romans here just turn real quickly to Romans Romans the eighth chapter amen how many loves him here this morning amen Romans 8. amen sorry they're sitting in my notes 28. for we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did pre uh him for he knew before he did four no past tense he also did predestinate past tense to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate past tense them he also called past tense and uh and and whom he called past tense then he also Justified past tense and whom he justified past tense them he also glorified past tense when your name is put in the Book of Life [Music] when your name you're not a whosoever your name is written in God's book and they will not lose one well that'll make you want to shout that'll make you want to rejoice I don't care what you're bringing to me I don't care what you're saying devil I am the Son of God I am anointed of God I've been equipped with the word of God and I'm going to stand toe-to-toe against you Hallelujah Hallelujah I said Hallelujah there's gonna be a lot of whosoevers that may be given eternal life at the white throwing judgment but you ain't gonna be there because your name is already secured in the rapture [Applause] can you say math I'm talking about a faith the whosoever will never rise to the occasion I've only got one bride I hadn't I well I gotta be honest I had I had some I had a lot of girls that liked me and they were the whosoevers and they were who but why my when my wife come along it didn't matter about all those whosoevers I lost their names I lost their phone numbers I I lost it all because I found the winner that pretty little girl back there is my girl [Applause] you don't matter what all the whosoevers wait he liked me first wait wait wait wait wait and she's just there hello [Applause] hello come on now her name is on the marriage certificate I just want to tell you devil you can say what you want denominations can say what they want but my name I said my name I've got that wedding band of predestinated Grace I've got that Hallelujah he loved me he died for me he's coming after me oh glorious day I am his thank God for his grace out there to the whosoever but there is a bride if you can believe this message you should be thankful to God if you've got something on the inside of you you should say yes thank you Jesus [Applause] acts 13 and 48 says and when the Gentiles heard this we're glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as many were ordained eternal life questioned as many as were ordained to eternal life believed well praise the Lord now you say you see how this matters you have got to think right and the only way you can think right is to look in the scripture and see who you are come on now but you see you were in God from all time he knew your name he knew the color of your hair he knew that you two boys were going to be the mighty Angel and the Earthly Angel last night God already seen it oh come on now God knew God knew that Ron Spencer he was going to be sitting there as a great General fighting that that devil of his life he knew it at the beginning he already knew it that's the reason why he placed that germ seed of God on the inside that ain't strong will of Ronald Dean Spencer that's the Eternal Jean seed of God you girls at the enemies pulling on you Amen in school and the enemy just keeps on and then and keeps trying to pull you in getting you to wear makeup and trying to get you to cut your hair and keep trying amen and all of a sudden there's something on the inside that rises up it doesn't mean that you're not fighting a war it doesn't mean you're not fighting a battle it don't mean the Ronald Dean Spencer it's not fighting a battle but he is a Son of God and you're a daughter of God and you have been equipped to destroy the enemy foreign get your swords out [Applause] and when it comes to the end you know it'll be the bride it'll be the spirit and the bride that talks to the whosoevers Revelations 22 and 17. and the spirit and the bride say somebody say the spirit and the bride say they've been given a voice come let him that heareth say come and let him that is The Thirst come whosoever will let him take of the Water of Life freely brother Branham says now watch that word what's the power now watch here he says how did God make the Earth he spoke it amen you see it he's speaking the world come into existence and this world this morning is the spoken word of God and he believed his own word here it is watch it that is what brother random is saying here it is watch it and if God and your and offspring of him and God is in you he'll believe his own word though it can't be seen though it can't be felt taste or anything he'll believe it see what I mean for God in you believes his own word is that right then you don't look at things you see you look at things that God has said oh praise the Lord I I I I think this morning we need to be thankful for the word of God we need to be thankful thankful for that word brother random says I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst how do we pray we pray in Jesus name don't we every prayer is in his name or there isn't any answer amen and he goes on down he says there's only one way to know his will and that is by the word of God now then this word he has left behind on the printer's page is part of him when you accept it by faith into a spirit filled light he goes on down he says there it is he is Spirit he is life that is exactly what the word is that is exactly what Jesus is he is the word so when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips it is the same as deity speaking [Applause] well you're not as little and insignificant as you thought you were when you can stand and what did he say ever Mountain has to go Satan cannot stand before that man what is causing this great confidence when she sees herself scripture am I taking too much time this morning seeing herself in Scripture this is why it was greatly important the mighty angel the Earthly angel and then the elect to take that book can you say man he didn't say to go to the angel for a blessing he said go to the angel and ask for he didn't he didn't even say ask for the book he says demand the book give me the book that is open in your hand can you say Amen Luke 17 30 as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man has that been fulfilled Joel or Malachi 4 I will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers has that been fulfilled what about Joel too I will restore the years of the Palmer worm the caterpillar the Locust and the canker worm has that been fulfilled well has it been fulfilled he's restored us Revelations 10 1 the mighty angel with an open book has that been fulfilled Revelations 10 9. take the Angels go to the angel and take the book hey is that being fulfilled so what can we say we can identify ourselves with that book Hallelujah now what does it do it does not make us stuffed shirts it is equipping us when we can see scripture being fulfilled today and when we cannot just see scripture of 60 years ago but we can identify ourselves in scripture today you know what that does that equips us 2023 it doesn't matter what the economy does it doesn't matter what the situations are it doesn't matter how bad things are I am the word made Manifest this is my hour what can you say man Amen brother Brandon would put it this way he says all his word of this day has got to be fulfilled we're living in the hour no matter what anyone else says the word has to be fulfilled heavens and earth will pass away but his word not his word now when Moses got all this together and seen by every direction the word being fulfilled it anointed his faith amen oh my what a thought this in itself itself sing the scripture pointing right straight to what it was and speaking of God the evidence of it there it anointed what faith he had in him to go to work what ought it to do to us we need a repentance we need a Revival I'm saying myself I need a shaking I need something I said I was speaking to myself this morning amen I need Awakening up and when I think of the great evidence and everything so perfectly laid out there it anointed the faith of Moses now how many beliefs that you're the one Hallelujah Moses says I'm not coming after I'm not just coming after work work we're not just going to take the cattle and we're not just going to take the strong man he says we ain't leaving a woman we ain't leaving a child he says we're not even going to leave a hoof behind we ain't leaving nothing for pharaoh can you say mine amen and when Moses came down there he was so anointed that when he walked up to Pharaoh on Pharaoh was all haughty he'd send him back out amen finally pharaoh says man won't you just leave us alone won't you you're plaguing my kingdom he says as long as I'm here I'm on your hands I'm going to plague your kingdom I'm going to plague your cattle I'm going to plague your water I'm going to plague everything as long as I'm here Pharaoh let my p i I'm saying that's the kind of determination we need here this morning I I don't care how long it takes but I want to let you know devil as long as I'm here [Applause] as long as you you you you can let me go anytime you want to and Satan said I ain't as love and as I'm here I'm gonna shake your kingdom in prayer I'm gonna shank your kingdom in faith I'm going to shake your kingdom with the word I'm going to sing the jailhouse down I'm gonna praise the victory until the walls come down I am on your hands [Applause] ain't gonna see me Molly grubbing around here I am on your hands devil foreign [Laughter] can you say Amen ain't no give up in me I am going to possess now as I start my descent here this morning this last day Ministry is serious business with God you are serious business with God can you say man now I I just want to put it your the bride that Christ has been waiting on for seven thousand or six thousand years amen he purchased her he bought her he washed her he's clothed her and he's empowered her can you say man now what is this to be I think as I my final thought here is the church needed something to fight with we needed something to fight with you you remember you remember there in the Old Testament that the Philistines had come in and taken all the swords and all the plow or all of the Spears from the from the Israelites there there was there there was no one matter of fact there was no sword found in the Kingdom except with Jonathan and Saul there was no blacksmiths the Philistines were holding Israel captive in their own land and the preacher he was backslid Saul was backslid he didn't know how to use a sword well praise the lord it's in the Bible but someone got courage someone got some courage and that's all I already told him the one the other one with the sword had told Jonathan he's now you guys you guys stay you know let's just stay here instead and then the Bible says that Jonathan and his armor Bearer he looked out there and he saw a bunch of Philistines over there and he looked over at his armor Bearer and he says do you think we can handle these guys and the armor Bearer says well you're the only one with a sword but I'm here to tell you mom where I'm ready to go I'm ready to go he says to just be me and you he goes let's let's do it Hallelujah now the other they're they're over there singing the blues or whatever they're doing in their Church amen and and they they were all having their they were in their morgue you know but old Saul old Saul and Jonathan or Jonathan and and his armor Bearer he took off up there amen and he looked over he said boy there's a bunch of them over there there's a bunch of them there and the armor Bearer says show enough is he says do you still think we can take it we got a sword we got a sword we've only got one but we got a sword I'll block what you slay Hallelujah and and the Bible says that the that the Philistines seen them and Came Upon them and they Slayer every one of them I'm glad for Bible History because the Bible says that Saul look around says what's going on down there so they're all looking through their binoculars and they're saying what there's this God that we there's there's this God that is slaying Philistines people are dead everywhere look around see who's missing Saul was missing and what did the Bible say they all took courage because one man had a sword oh can you say man now I I just want to put this right here in your mouth what is your sword the word is sharper than a two-edged sword come on Amen this this is what you're what what did the bible say that Jesus is going to slay all of his enemies with out of his mouth shall come forth a two-edged sword what did God say upon you they're in Isaiah 44 and 3. I will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry land and I will pour out my spirit upon thy seed and blessings upon thine Offspring Isaiah 59 and 19. so they so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising in the Sun and when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him and the Redeemer shall come to design unto them that turn from transgression and Jacob saith Lord as for me this is my Covenant with him my spirit is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed known out of the mouth of thy seed seed saith the Lord from henceforth and for forevermore that's your scripture [Applause] it ain't gonna be it ain't gonna be Jonathan with a sword it's not going to be a prophet with a sword it's not going to be brother Andrew and brother Josh with a sword you are going to have the sword brother Branham says and
