[34:27] Oh, from these eyes

[35:04] for as long
[35:07] as I have.
[35:10] I know Jesus.
[35:13] [Music]
[35:16] He said that I
[35:20] I could still
[35:23] go free.
[35:28] Oh, he said that I
[35:32] I could still
[35:34] [Music]
[35:35] go free.
[35:41] Oh, tell me what kind
[35:44] of a man

[36:14] Oh yeah, the man on

[36:21] He put me in
[36:24] his will
[36:26] and said that I
[36:30] I could still
[36:33] go free. Let's sing it one more time.

[37:14] worthy
[37:17] to live
[37:20] and not fit
[37:23] to kill.
[37:26] and a man on
[37:29] the cross.
[37:32] Put me in
[37:35] his will
[37:38] and said that I
[37:42] could still
[37:45] go free. One more time. Let's just think
[37:47] about it.
[37:51] that I
[37:54] could still
[37:57] go free.
[38:02] Tell me what kind
[38:06] of a man
[38:09] would reach down
[38:12] his hand,
[38:16] do this for me.
[38:25] unworthy
[38:28] to live
[38:31] and not fit
[38:34] to give
[38:37] a man on
[38:40] the cross.
[38:44] He in
[38:47] his will
[38:49] said that I
[38:51] [Music]
[38:53] could still
[38:54] [Music]
[38:57] free.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Aren't you so
[39:00] thankful for that tonight?
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. While we were yet sinners, while
[39:04] we didn't have our mind on the Lord,
[39:06] didn't really care about the Lord, he
[39:09] already had a plan for you. He already
[39:12] had a redemption laid out for you. He
[39:14] knew you would be here.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; He knew that when he came knocking on
[39:18] your heart, you would desire because you
[39:20] belong to him. You would desire to serve
[39:23] him
[39:24] &gt;&gt; and he has it all taken care of. What a
[39:26] mighty God. From before you ever had a
[39:29] choice, he had you on his mind.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; From cradle to glory,
[39:34] &gt;&gt; he's got it all under control. We get,
[39:37] you know, we get in, as they say, in a
[39:39] tizzy and we get all been out of shape
[39:40] about things and how things can go down
[39:42] here and don't go always like according
[39:44] to our plans, but we're living according
[39:47] to his plan.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful? Amen. God bless
[39:49] each and every one of you. Certainly
[39:50] good to see you all in the house of the
[39:51] Lord. We like to welcome you. Thank you,
[39:53] musicians. We like to welcome you to the
[39:56] house of the Lord. Pray you came hungry,
[39:58] ready to feast on the word of the Lord.
[39:59] Amen. We want to continue to remember as
[40:01] was mentioned for uh brother Ron,
[40:03] brother Andrew as they're on the
[40:04] missionary field. We just pray that God
[40:06] will continue to bless them. We'd like
[40:08] to welcome all of our visitors that are
[40:10] with us. I'd like to welcome brother and
[40:12] sister Turner back with us.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Jay, Sister
[40:17] Alyssa. Amen. God bless you, Sister
[40:18] Dave. Good to have you in the house of
[40:20] the Lord. Amen. God bless each and every
[40:22] one of you. We'll just go right to the
[40:23] scripture. Not keep you standing. If
[40:25] you'll turn with me to St. John chapter
[40:27] 3 and then in First Peter chapter 1,
[40:30] we'll just have one verse there, but
[40:31] we'll begin in St. John chapter 3.
[40:37] Do you love the Lord?
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you love the Lord, you've got
[40:41] to love his word because he is the word.
[40:44] Amen. We'll begin reading verse one.
[40:48] There was a man of the Pharisees named
[40:50] Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. The same
[40:54] came to Jesus by night and said unto
[40:56] him, "Rabbi, we know that thou art a
[40:58] teacher come from God. For no man can do
[41:02] these miracles that thou doest, except
[41:04] God be with him. Jesus answered and said
[41:07] unto him, verily, verily, I say unto
[41:11] thee,
[41:12] except a man be born again, he cannot
[41:15] see the kingdom of God.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man
[41:20] be born when he's old, can he enter the
[41:22] second time into his mother's womb and
[41:25] be born? Jesus answered, "Verily,
[41:27] verily, I say unto thee, except a man be
[41:30] born of water and of spirit, he cannot
[41:33] enter into the kingdom of God.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; That which is born of the flesh is
[41:38] flesh, that which is born of the spirit
[41:40] is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto
[41:43] thee, Ye must be born again. The wind
[41:46] bloweth where it listeth, and thou
[41:48] hearest the sound thereof, but can not
[41:51] tell whence it cometh, and whether it
[41:52] goeth." So is everyone that is born of
[41:56] the spirit. Amen. In 1 Peter chapter 1
[41:58] verse 23
[42:00] Peter Peter writing here being born
[42:03] again not of corruptible seed but of
[42:07] incorruptible by the word of God which
[42:12] liveth and abideth forever. Amen. Let's
[42:15] bow our heads and our hearts. Dear kind
[42:17] heavenly father, we come before you
[42:18] humbly in prayer Lord. Lord, we just
[42:20] acknowledge our and just Father, humble
[42:22] ourselves before you and acknowledge our
[42:24] insufficiency within ourselves. And we
[42:26] just want to surrender to you, Father,
[42:28] both speaker and hear. We just pray you
[42:30] forgive us of our sins. May you come in
[42:32] this service, Lord. And may the
[42:34] supernatural take place, Father, Lord,
[42:35] and may our lives be changed by your
[42:37] word. We love you. We thank you for this
[42:39] opportunity to be in your house in Jesus
[42:41] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless
[42:43] you. May be seated.
[42:45] With the help of the Lord, I'd like to
[42:46] take a title this this evening here on
[42:49] you must
[42:52] be born again.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; You must
[42:57] be born again. And the word must, that's
[43:00] not an option.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; That's not it' be a good idea. That's
[43:04] not advice. That's not a recommendation.
[43:07] But it's a declaration, a commandment
[43:10] from the very mouth of God himself that
[43:12] we must be born again.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God would read that and
[43:17] he would say that that's actually
[43:18] Jesus's first doctrine. That was the
[43:22] first doctrine that he preached was that
[43:24] we must be born again. He was out doing
[43:26] miracles and he he was, you know,
[43:28] dividing the fishes and loaves and he
[43:30] had great crowds. But then he began to
[43:32] start teaching the word and Nicodemus
[43:34] came to him as we read in the scripture
[43:36] there by night and and you know many
[43:37] people criticized Nicodemus for coming
[43:39] by night but the prophet said at least
[43:40] he came
[43:42] &gt;&gt; at least he got to Jesus you know he had
[43:44] a certain status and and and but he
[43:47] still came to Jesus and we find him
[43:49] later in the scripture actually helping
[43:50] take Jesus off the cross. But he came to
[43:53] Jesus and he asked and and he being a
[43:56] great teacher, he he looked at the
[43:57] ministry of Jesus and he said, "Surely
[43:59] with these phenomenal miracles that
[44:01] we've never seen before, surely you come
[44:04] from God. There's you've got to have the
[44:06] truth."
[44:07] &gt;&gt; And he said, "No man can do these works
[44:09] except he be of God."
[44:11] &gt;&gt; So he begins to ask Jesus and and and
[44:13] Nicodemus had to humble himself and he
[44:16] could not understand how can a man be
[44:19] born again.
[44:22] He even asked Jesus the the question,
[44:24] can how can a man can a man literally be
[44:27] born again? And Jesus begins to break
[44:29] down what that means to be born again.
[44:32] Now, Satan, if Jesus mentioned that it
[44:34] that you must be born again, and that
[44:36] was his first doctrine, that means it is
[44:38] a foundation. That means it's
[44:40] foundational. We have to be born again
[44:44] if we are to get our Christian
[44:46] experience right. And as we grow into
[44:48] the knowledge and revelation of the Lord
[44:50] Jesus Christ in this message, we need to
[44:53] have the right foundation.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Because when we don't build a home on
[44:57] the correct foundation, it will then
[44:59] begin to fall.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; So if we try to build our Christian
[45:03] experience and we don't have the correct
[45:05] foundation, there's going to be some
[45:07] things falling apart in our lives. We've
[45:09] got to get things in order and then
[45:12] think God has a provided way for
[45:15] everything. God is a God of order.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; He's not a God of chaos. He's not a god
[45:20] of confusion. He is a god of order.
[45:23] Everything is set in its place.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; So because it is so foundational, Satan
[45:30] has seen to it that in every church age,
[45:33] he always attacks the new birth.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; He always tries to make light of it. He
[45:39] always tries to sidetrack it. Could you
[45:41] imagine as message believers to actually
[45:44] believe that if you came to church and
[45:47] you shook the preacher's hand
[45:49] &gt;&gt; that that gave you the new birth?
[45:52] &gt;&gt; We can't even begin to imagine that. But
[45:54] people actually believe that.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; People believe that because you come and
[46:00] you shake the preacher's hands, God
[46:02] bless you. God bless you. You're born
[46:03] again. You're born again. That's not how
[46:05] it works.
[46:07] We cannot give the Holy Ghost as much as
[46:10] we wish we could to anyone. God is the
[46:14] only one that can give the Holy Ghost.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; And if you want the Holy Ghost, you have
[46:18] to come God's provided way to get it.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Just like there was a certain provided
[46:25] way for you to get here naturally, God
[46:28] has a provided way for us to be born
[46:30] again spiritually.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Right.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; It could have been a handshake. It could
[46:35] be where where you know where where
[46:37] denominations will put all the emphasis
[46:39] on if you speak in tonesues,
[46:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Regardless of what kind of life follows
[46:43] it,
[46:44] &gt;&gt; you keep speaking in tonesues until
[46:46] you're until you you just utter some
[46:47] confusion, live like a devil, but
[46:50] because you spoke in tonesues, you have
[46:52] the Holy Ghost.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is a life.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; It's not emotion.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; It brings emotion. But the Holy Ghost by
[47:03] definition is not emotion.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; It is not easy belieism.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God in the message of
[47:10] Easter Seal, he says, "I'm wondering
[47:12] today is what's happening. Are we really
[47:16] getting the people to God
[47:18] &gt;&gt; or are we just getting them to church?
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Are we really getting the people to God
[47:26] &gt;&gt; or are we getting them to church?"
[47:31] He said we must get them to Christ.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; Where this quickening power, it's good
[47:37] to go to church. Sure.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; If that's as far as we go, it's not far
[47:43] enough.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; When you come to church, that's good.
[47:47] But go on to Christ
[47:50] &gt;&gt; from the church.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; The church is not our salvation. The
[47:54] church is a is a body of believers.
[47:56] there. We naturally hear what what my
[47:58] what our eyes see. We are a group of
[48:01] believers that gather ourselves
[48:03] &gt;&gt; right
[48:04] &gt;&gt; around this unchanging word. But your
[48:06] church attendance does not merit you or
[48:09] me any salvation.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; And I'll even go even preaching the
[48:14] gospel doesn't merit me salvation. I've
[48:17] got to have a new birth just like you
[48:19] have to have a new birth. When I go
[48:22] home, I've got to live this message.
[48:24] Just like when you go home, you've got
[48:26] to live this message.
[48:28] [Applause]
[48:31] &gt;&gt; So, we must go from the idea that
[48:33] because we belong to a message church
[48:35] that gives us that that that will not
[48:37] get us into heaven.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; In fact, that will make us more
[48:41] responsible because we reheard the truth
[48:44] twice a week
[48:46] &gt;&gt; and hopefully during the week, too. But
[48:48] you at least hear the truth twice a
[48:49] week. And so we then become responsible
[48:52] because Jesus said to whom much is
[48:54] given, much is required.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; So much has been given to us. So there's
[48:59] much to be required of us.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; So we must go from the church to Christ.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; In the in another sermon, the bomb of
[49:11] Gil in Gilead, he says, you know, the
[49:14] new birth is what people want to dodge.
[49:17] They want to dodge the issue. So the
[49:19] devil patches it up. Said when you
[49:21] believe, that's when you're born again.
[49:23] That's not right.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; Listen, any birth, as I said before, any
[49:28] birth is a mess. I don't care where is
[49:30] that where it's at. If it's in a pig
[49:32] pin, it's a mess. A mess of pigs being
[49:34] born out there, it's a horrible thing.
[49:35] If it's out in a field when a cat's
[49:36] born, it's a horrible thing. If it's out
[49:39] in the pink decorated hospital room,
[49:40] it's a mess. A new birth is a mess. But
[49:43] you have to have that messy thing to
[49:46] bring forth new life. Come on.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; You know, dying is the hardest thing for
[49:51] a human to do,
[49:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[49:53] &gt;&gt; To walk to,
[49:57] &gt;&gt; we in our in our human nature will do
[49:59] anything to avoid death.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; We'll try and eat healthier.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; We'll try and work out.
[50:09] We'll try We'll try anything we can.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; We'll try and and do anything. But in
[50:16] and in the spiritual, the same thing
[50:18] applies.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; It takes the grace of God and you've got
[50:22] to break past yourself to humble
[50:25] yourself
[50:26] &gt;&gt; and say, "God, I don't care how I act.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; If he wants me to stand on my head,
[50:34] &gt;&gt; to get the Holy Ghost, I'll do it."
[50:39] &gt;&gt; So it doesn't the the pride and and what
[50:42] will people think?
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Come on. That's all got to go out the
[50:46] window. And you got we got to humble
[50:48] ourselves
[50:50] &gt;&gt; and say, "God, if like Buddy Robinson,
[50:52] if you don't give me the Holy Ghost,
[50:54] you're going to file a pile. You're
[50:55] going to find a pile of bones right
[50:56] here.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; It's a hard thing,
[51:04] but it's a mess.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; There's no way somebody had a mess
[51:09] getting a new birth and somebody got a
[51:11] new birth." And so that was the most
[51:13] beautiful new birth you've ever seen.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; It's a mess.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Now Jesus speaking to Nicodemus, he
[51:25] said, "That which is born of the flesh
[51:27] is flesh. That which is born of the
[51:29] spirit is spirit." So see, there's two
[51:32] bodies. There's the flesh and then
[51:34] there's the spirit.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Now we have three bodies. There's the
[51:40] the earthly, the heavenly, and the
[51:42] glorified.
[51:45] But Jesus is speaking here and Paul
[51:46] picks that up. There's two births.
[51:48] There's a natural birth and there's a
[51:50] supernatural birth. The first birth you
[51:53] is is why we look how we look. That's
[51:57] why you have the personality that you
[51:58] have. That's why you have the problems
[52:00] that you have.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Is because of the first birth.
[52:06] So, he made a way and that's from our
[52:08] mom and dad. And it's all fleshly. It's
[52:11] all sensual. It's all we're bound by the
[52:13] 10 senses.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; We're bound by the five senses of our
[52:17] body. We're bound by the five senses of
[52:19] our humanity. We've got to look past
[52:21] that.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; So, the first birth is from our mom and
[52:25] dad. The second one comes from above.
[52:28] Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15:47, he
[52:31] says, "The first man is of the earth,
[52:33] earthy. The second man is the Lord from
[52:35] heaven. As is the earthly, such are such
[52:39] are they also that are earthy.
[52:42] And as is the heavenly, such are they
[52:44] also that are heavenly. Now, as we have
[52:47] borne the image of the earthly, so we
[52:51] shall also bear the image of the
[52:53] heavenly.
[52:54] Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and
[52:57] blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.
[53:01] Right?
[53:03] &gt;&gt; What does that mean? That means our
[53:04] humanity
[53:05] &gt;&gt; cannot inherit the kingdom of God.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; That means we cannot walk into the
[53:10] kingdom of God. We cannot get to heaven
[53:12] because of who our last name is or how
[53:14] we look or our earthly associations or
[53:16] how much money we have. Nothing natural
[53:20] &gt;&gt; goes over there.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; And while I'm here, God does not have
[53:27] any grandchildren. Amen. Preach it.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; He's not a grandpa.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Everyone, the same young people, the
[53:36] same experience,
[53:38] &gt;&gt; assuming that your parents have the Holy
[53:40] Ghost. The same experience that your
[53:42] parents have, you have got to have.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; And if the Lord carries and you get
[53:47] married and you have children, then your
[53:49] children have to have the same
[53:50] experience you had.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; You cannot hand it down.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; You cannot give them. As I said earlier,
[53:58] the preacher can't lay his hands on you
[54:00] and in his humanity give you the Holy
[54:02] Ghost. Did they in the book of Acts lay
[54:04] their hands on them and they got the
[54:05] Holy Ghost? Yes. But it wasn't the
[54:06] apostles. It was God still giving them.
[54:09] Because remember the scripture said that
[54:11] the Lord added daily such as should be
[54:13] saved.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; So God does not have any grandchildren.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; It's only sons and daughters.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Good. So we all need our own individual
[54:24] walk
[54:26] &gt;&gt; experience.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; See, we get into the body of Christ
[54:31] individually, one at a time.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; We're birthed into the kingdom. But then
[54:35] when it's time at the time of the
[54:36] resurrection,
[54:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[54:38] &gt;&gt; We're all going to be translated and go
[54:41] up into the rapture as it's called
[54:43] collectively.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; But we're not born again collectively.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; That's for Israel, not for the Gentiles.
[54:51] That's good.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; So in Psalm 51:5, David said, "Behold, I
[54:55] was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did
[54:57] my mother conceive me."
[54:59] &gt;&gt; You don't have a choice. You when you
[55:01] breathe your first breath, you're born a
[55:04] sinner.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; True.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Psalm 58:3, "The wicked are estranged
[55:10] from the womb. They go astray as soon as
[55:13] they are born. As soon as they be born,
[55:16] speaking lies."
[55:18] Romans 3:23, "For all have sinned
[55:21] &gt;&gt; and come short of the glory of God."
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Psalm uh excuse me, Romans 5:12,
[55:28] "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered
[55:30] into the world, and death by sin, and so
[55:33] death passed upon all men, for that all
[55:36] have sinned."
[55:39] &gt;&gt; But brother William, I was born in the
[55:41] message.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; I never went out in the world. I never
[55:46] smoked a cigarette. I've never drunk a
[55:48] drop.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; I've never coroused. I've never done any
[55:50] evil thing. I'm pure.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; I've lived as clean as possible.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Well, if your angel wings survive those
[56:00] scriptures,
[56:02] &gt;&gt; this quote should clip them down pretty
[56:04] good.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Which I don't know how angel wings could
[56:10] survive those scriptures because the
[56:11] Bible says, "All have sinned."
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Listen to what the prophet of God says
[56:15] here. He says, "How are you going to go
[56:17] to heaven?" You say, "I've never sinned
[56:18] in my life." "Oh, the little darling, it
[56:21] was just an angel to begin with." That's
[56:24] a lie.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; I don't care how good you are, you're a
[56:32] sinner.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; And you don't have one thing. There's no
[56:36] priest, no bishop, no cardinal, no pope,
[56:38] no nothing else can save you because
[56:39] he's in the same boat you're in.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; We're going to get to in a few minutes.
[56:43] Just the same shape. The pope of Rome
[56:45] was born in sin
[56:47] &gt;&gt; shaped in iniquity come to the world
[56:48] speaking lies born by the sexual desire
[56:50] of a man and a woman when you where you
[56:53] going to get righteous out of that well
[56:55] his papa and mama were born the same way
[56:57] and when they were born the same way and
[56:58] his grandma and grandpa and on back it's
[57:00] sin to begin with so who can say that
[57:03] this is holy and that's holy there's not
[57:04] one thing holy there's only one thing
[57:06] holy that's Jesus Christ the son of the
[57:09] living God
[57:10] &gt;&gt; who was made perfect and our requirement
[57:12] is to be perfect Now, how are we going
[57:14] to be it? Now, listen what he says here.
[57:19] If I never had an evil thought in my
[57:22] life,
[57:24] if I never spoke a bad word in my life,
[57:28] if I never looked at anything evil,
[57:31] never thought anything evil
[57:35] or nothing, I'm just as rank and black
[57:40] as the smuddy walls of hell.
[57:44] I'm a sinner.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; I could come through life and stay
[57:48] locked up in a room like some of the
[57:50] Carmelite sisters or something and never
[57:52] see the world, stay there and pray all
[57:54] my life, do good, born a
[57:57] multi-millionaire, and give to the poor
[57:59] everything I got and I'm still a sinner
[58:01] and will go to hell.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He says, I might join the
[58:05] Lutheran church, Baptist, Pentecostal,
[58:07] Presbyterian.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; I may attend FGLT.
[58:13] when I'm on the cradle roll and live
[58:15] faithful to that church until a hundred
[58:17] years and my life is took and no man
[58:20] could point their finger at me and say
[58:21] he has ever even had as much as a bad
[58:25] thought.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; I'll go to hell just as sure as I'm
[58:30] standing.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; That cuts us all out.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; I'm a sinner. That's correct. I've got
[58:39] nothing. There's no way at all I could
[58:42] find any price to be paid. God required
[58:45] death.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; And if I give my own life, if I give my
[58:49] life, then how can I repent,
[58:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[58:52] &gt;&gt; The debt has to get paid first.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; So if the penalty for sin is death, yes,
[58:58] Lord, I'm a sinner. I deserve to die.
[59:00] Well, the penalty's got to be you got to
[59:01] pay the debt first. So if you give your
[59:03] life for your own sin, then how are you
[59:05] going to repent?
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Because you're dead. Right.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; See, it's an impossibility. He said,
[59:13] "And God was the only one
[59:18] &gt;&gt; only one
[59:20] &gt;&gt; who could lay his life down and take it
[59:23] up again."
[59:24] &gt;&gt; So he says, "So he could become sin."
[59:28] Now remember, he wasn't born sin. He was
[59:31] not sinful. He became sin. Brother,
[59:33] where did the sin come from? Right here.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. every human being on earth.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; So he took on that sin on himself and he
[59:41] paid the debt first.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; But what separated him from man is he
[59:46] was God.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; So he was able to die,
[59:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:50] &gt;&gt; And then resurrect.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; The debt's paid.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Now to have the Holy Ghost is to be born
[1:00:01] again.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; There's no difference.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I want to just labor on
[1:00:05] this just a little bit to save in save
[1:00:08] some confusion. You keep following the
[1:00:10] message in the church age book. Brother
[1:00:11] Ram clarifies this beautifully.
[1:00:14] To have the Holy Ghost is to be born
[1:00:15] again. To be born again is to have the
[1:00:17] token.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; You don't you don't become born again
[1:00:20] and then you go on to receive the Holy
[1:00:22] Ghost.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Now he says, I'll read the quote real
[1:00:25] fast. He says, "Now before we leave the
[1:00:27] subject, I want to make myself very
[1:00:29] clear on what the baptism with the Holy
[1:00:31] Ghost is according to the word. It's not
[1:00:33] according to me. It's not according to
[1:00:34] you. It has to be according to thus
[1:00:35] sayith the Lord or we are falsely led.
[1:00:38] He says to begin with, you will notice
[1:00:39] that in my meetings when I have finished
[1:00:41] preaching an evangelistic service or
[1:00:43] some teaching message, I cast the net
[1:00:45] and invite a response from the people. I
[1:00:47] ask them to come forward and receive the
[1:00:49] Holy Spirit. My Pentecostal friends upon
[1:00:51] hearing me say this believe that I'm
[1:00:53] inviting people to come forward and be
[1:00:55] baptized with the Holy Ghost because
[1:00:57] they are already born again. So when I
[1:00:59] invite those who are spiritfilled to
[1:01:01] come and deal with those who have
[1:01:02] answered the invitation to receive the
[1:01:04] spirit, these dear ones search forward
[1:01:07] and deal with the people in such a
[1:01:09] manner as to encourage them to yield to
[1:01:10] God and to believe, to speak in tongues.
[1:01:13] This has caused a great deal of
[1:01:14] confusion. I want to tell you exactly
[1:01:16] what I mean.
[1:01:18] I mean for the sinner to come forward
[1:01:20] and be born again which is to be
[1:01:22] baptized into the body of Christ by the
[1:01:24] Holy Ghost which is exactly what took
[1:01:27] place at Pentecost when the church was
[1:01:28] launched. In other words,
[1:01:31] to be born of the spirit is to be truly
[1:01:34] baptized with the Holy Ghost. It is one
[1:01:37] and the same.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; So what does being born again mean? What
[1:01:42] is it?
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; What is the Holy Ghost?
[1:01:48] It is the literal life of Jesus Christ.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; It is not an allegory. It is not a
[1:01:56] story. It's not a type. It's not a
[1:01:58] figment. It's not It's kind of like
[1:01:59] this. It's No, it is a literal. Everyone
[1:02:03] understand literal.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Like this is literally a bottle of
[1:02:08] water.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; It is literally the life of Christ
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; coming back and living in you.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; That's right. Good.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; You talk about a love story
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; to come and for God Almighty to come to
[1:02:22] leave glory and to come and to redeem us
[1:02:24] and want to live in us,
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is the anchor that keeps
[1:02:29] the flesh and human spirit in check.
[1:02:32] Because remember, your flesh is not born
[1:02:34] again.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Your human spirit is not born again.
[1:02:38] When you get born again and get the Holy
[1:02:39] Ghost, it is on the level of your soul.
[1:02:41] We are a triune being.
[1:02:45] We have a flesh,
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; That is what we see. We have the human
[1:02:51] spirit which would be like our
[1:02:52] personality,
[1:02:54] reasoning and memory and affection and
[1:02:56] and it's our mood. That's our human
[1:02:58] spirit. And then there's the soul. Now
[1:03:01] God, that's where God is concerned,
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:04] Because if he can get brother Noah our
[1:03:07] souls exactly with filled with the Holy
[1:03:10] Ghost which is what his plan is and we
[1:03:11] become born again then the Holy Ghost
[1:03:13] begins to permeate itself on the way on
[1:03:16] from the inside out and the world will
[1:03:19] then begin to to to drop off
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; different attitudes and different
[1:03:25] situations of life will begin to take
[1:03:27] care of itself because you are have you
[1:03:31] have a fountain that never runs dry.
[1:03:33] What did Jesus said? He that's born
[1:03:34] again will have rivers of water like
[1:03:37] flowing out of his belly.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; A fresh artisian well. When you get
[1:03:43] depressed,
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; You have something for that.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; There is a prescription for that.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; Peter wrote it out.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; There may be some side effects.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy. Come on.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Your life will get cleaned up.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Your marriage will improve.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Your family life will improve.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; For everything we have need of the Holy
[1:04:21] Ghost is the answer to everything.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the answer to
[1:04:25] everything. It don't our problems can
[1:04:27] come from a a million different
[1:04:29] directions,
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; right? And I promise you Jesus is the
[1:04:32] answer for every single problem.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Every single problem,
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; every single situation, every single
[1:04:38] worry. He is the center
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; of our lives. He should be the center of
[1:04:44] our lives.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is a keeping power that
[1:04:48] keeps you when you can't keep yourself.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; When you The Holy Ghost will also do
[1:04:54] this. when you don't feel like your
[1:04:57] prayers, Sister Dorothy, are getting
[1:04:59] this high,
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; but yet you're standing on what he said,
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; That's the Holy Ghost in you.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Because remember, we stand on the word
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; regardless of if we feel the emotion
[1:05:17] coming behind it or not.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; It's not the emotion that gives us the
[1:05:21] confirmation. It's what he said in his
[1:05:23] word.
[1:05:25] Like brother Ram trying to teach the
[1:05:27] Pentecostals about speaking in tongues.
[1:05:28] He said, "If I've got the tongue of a
[1:05:30] shoe, do I have the whole shoe?" Well,
[1:05:33] no. The tongue is a part of a shoe,
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; but it's not the whole shoe.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; He said in St. John 16:7,
[1:05:42] "Nevertheless, I tell you the truth. It
[1:05:44] is expedient for you that I go away. For
[1:05:46] if I go not away, the comforter will not
[1:05:48] come. But if I depart, I will send him
[1:05:50] unto you."
[1:05:51] The Holy Ghost is proof that Jesus was
[1:05:54] real
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; because how could you? Because remember
[1:06:00] he said if I go not away
[1:06:03] I can't send the spirit but if I go away
[1:06:05] I'm going to send the spirit back.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; So the Holy Ghost is actually evidence
[1:06:10] brother Jonathan that that Jesus Christ
[1:06:12] came and lived
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; and because he died is how the Holy
[1:06:17] Ghost then became available to us.
[1:06:18] Without his death, the Holy Ghost would
[1:06:20] have stayed bottled up in him. If Jesus
[1:06:22] would would have come and he would have
[1:06:24] done his ministry and he would have
[1:06:26] vanished like Melzdc,
[1:06:29] we would be helpless,
[1:06:31] hopeless, and lost.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; But because his body was broken, that's
[1:06:37] what released the elements of the new
[1:06:39] birth. That's
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; And made the Holy Ghost available for
[1:06:43] us.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Right? And then this also the Holy Ghost
[1:06:46] also proves that he ascended because he
[1:06:48] said I go back to the father and then
[1:06:50] the comforter
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; which is God in spirit form will come
[1:06:54] back to you.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Now how do we get into him? 1
[1:07:00] Corinthians 12:13. For by one spirit we
[1:07:03] are for by one spirit we are all
[1:07:05] baptized into one body whether we be
[1:07:08] Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or
[1:07:10] free and have all been made to drink
[1:07:12] into one spirit. So the way back into
[1:07:15] his body
[1:07:17] is the way it came out of his body.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Remember in St. John 19 when they came
[1:07:26] to Jesus
[1:07:28] and the sun was going down and they had
[1:07:30] to to to hurry up the crucifixion. They
[1:07:32] went and when they would crucify
[1:07:33] somebody, they would break their legs
[1:07:35] because that' make the weight of their
[1:07:37] body come down and it would kill them
[1:07:38] quicker. It was an act of mercy they
[1:07:40] called.
[1:07:43] But when they so they broke the the two
[1:07:46] thieves legs, but when they came to
[1:07:47] Jesus, because there was a scripture
[1:07:48] that said, "Not a single bone of him was
[1:07:50] broken."
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; When that soldier reared back that
[1:07:53] hammer, whatever they had, that
[1:07:55] scripture stood right there would not
[1:07:57] let him swing it.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; That's how perfect the scripture is.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Because when Moses gave them order to do
[1:08:04] Passover, they were not to break a
[1:08:05] single bone of that lamb on in the
[1:08:07] Exodus.
[1:08:09] So, one of the soldiers grabbed a spear
[1:08:12] and went up to him. And when he he
[1:08:13] thrust that spear in his side, water and
[1:08:16] blood came out of his side.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; And he said, and then Jesus cried out on
[1:08:23] the cross, "Father, into my into thy
[1:08:25] hands I commend my spirit." Right there,
[1:08:28] you have the elements of the new birth.
[1:08:30] That's
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; That was the antiype. Whenever whenever
[1:08:34] God put Adam to sleep in the Garden of
[1:08:36] Eden and put him to sleep and took Eve
[1:08:39] out of his side, out of a rib out of his
[1:08:41] side, that was a type of what was
[1:08:44] happening on the cross.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; We came from the side of Jesus Christ.
[1:08:50] Our new birth, what we needed to be with
[1:08:54] him for all eternity came out of him.
[1:08:57] Water, blood, and a spirit.
[1:09:00] So the only way to get back into him
[1:09:02] spiritually is by water, blood, and
[1:09:05] spirit
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; by justification, sanctification, and
[1:09:08] then the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Now, in 1 John 5:7, John speaking here
[1:09:14] again. He says, "For there are three
[1:09:15] that bear record in heaven, the Father,
[1:09:17] the Word, and the Holy Ghost. These
[1:09:19] three are one,
[1:09:23] and there are three in verse eight that
[1:09:25] bear witness in the earth, the spirit,
[1:09:26] the water, and the blood. These three
[1:09:29] agree in one. Now there's a world of
[1:09:32] difference between being one
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; right
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; and then agreeing in one.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; So whenever something is one like the
[1:09:42] father, the word, and the holy ghost,
[1:09:44] that means if you have one, you have all
[1:09:46] three.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; If you have the son, you have the father
[1:09:49] and you have the spirit.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; If you got the spirit, you got the
[1:09:51] father, you got the word. It's all one.
[1:09:53] That's good.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; But now there's three that bear witness
[1:09:57] in earth. The spirit, the water, and the
[1:10:00] blood. Now these three agree in one.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; So agreeing means they're all pointing
[1:10:06] you in the same direction in the same
[1:10:09] destination. But if they only agree in
[1:10:11] ones, that means you can have one
[1:10:13] without having the other
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; because they're not one, but they agree
[1:10:16] in one. Do you understand?
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; You can have the the the father, the
[1:10:21] son, the holy ghost. You can have the
[1:10:23] word, the spirit. It's all the same
[1:10:25] thing. Just like the Holy Ghost, the new
[1:10:27] birth, and the token is the same thing,
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; But you can be justified
[1:10:33] without being sanctified.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; You can be justified and sanctified
[1:10:37] without having the Holy Ghost because
[1:10:38] they agree in one.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; So it's a process just like a birth, a
[1:10:45] natural birth is a process.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:51] So justification simply just means you
[1:10:55] acknowledge you're a sinner
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; and you realize you need God.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; It's like you're walking in a certain
[1:11:02] direction and somebody taps you on the
[1:11:04] shoulder and you go.
[1:11:06] You turn from your sin. You turn from
[1:11:09] what you're doing and you begin to
[1:11:11] repent and you believe that the blood of
[1:11:13] Jesus cleanses you from all sin and you
[1:11:16] put your faith in that. It's simple.
[1:11:19] That's right.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; You confess your sins. You put it under
[1:11:22] the blood. It don't matter what you've
[1:11:24] done. Whatever. God puts it
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; in the sea of forgiveness. God puts it
[1:11:28] under his blood. It's over. You're
[1:11:30] justified. That gives you some freedom.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; But don't stop.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Because remember, as the Bible says in
[1:11:42] First Peter 3:21, "Baptism doth now also
[1:11:45] save us." And Peter says, "Not the
[1:11:47] putting away of the filth of the flesh,
[1:11:49] but the answer of a good conscience
[1:11:50] toward God by the resurrection of Jesus
[1:11:52] Christ." So when we come here and we're
[1:11:54] baptized, we are expressing to the
[1:11:56] church that something happened in us.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; That we have now turned around. We're
[1:12:04] now repented of our sins. We are
[1:12:06] identifying oursel in the death, burial,
[1:12:08] and resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[1:12:10] Christ. But that's just part of the
[1:12:12] justified state.
[1:12:16] But there's still things hanging on you
[1:12:17] in your life.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Wrong things, wrong habits.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Come on. That's right.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; You know, someone can smoke
[1:12:28] and hate doing it.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Someone can drink and hate doing it.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Someone can be addicted to pornography
[1:12:37] and hate it.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; They know it's wrong and they just begin
[1:12:41] to repent. God, I I I'm sorry I smoked
[1:12:44] another cigarette. I'm sorry. I just
[1:12:45] feel so bad. I hate doing it. God,
[1:12:48] please forgive me.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; He'll forgive you.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; But you still crave it.
[1:12:55] So, you need God to take away that
[1:12:58] desire out of your life
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; to where actually you don't even want it
[1:13:04] anymore. or you can't stand the smell or
[1:13:06] or whatever that weakness, that
[1:13:08] troubling that that that that that sin
[1:13:11] is in your life, you don't desire it.
[1:13:14] That means you're justified. Keep keep
[1:13:16] it under the blood. Keep asking God to
[1:13:19] forgive you, but then ask God to start
[1:13:21] taking it away from you.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Don't just use justification as a crush
[1:13:25] and say, "Well, bless God, man. I love
[1:13:27] to drink. I know God will forgive me."
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Then you make grace a disgrace.
[1:13:34] But even if if you still have the desire
[1:13:36] but you hate it, ask God to take it away
[1:13:38] from you. Ask God to sanctify you.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Sanctification is cleansing. And then
[1:13:45] God sets you aside for service,
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Now, don't get the born again experience
[1:13:52] confused with sanctification,
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Because you Now, let me just put this in
[1:13:58] here real fast.
[1:14:00] Even if you have the Holy Ghost,
[1:14:01] sanctification, justification, and even
[1:14:03] the Holy Ghost is not I've got the Holy
[1:14:05] Ghost, so bless God, I don't have to
[1:14:07] repent. I don't ever have to be
[1:14:08] sanctified of nothing anymore because
[1:14:10] I've got the Holy Ghost. I've done been
[1:14:11] through all three things. No, you've got
[1:14:14] to be cleansed every day. You've got to
[1:14:16] be You see things the enemy trying to
[1:14:17] creep in in your life. You say, "Lord,
[1:14:19] take that away from me. I don't want it.
[1:14:21] What are you doing?" You're keeping
[1:14:23] yourself sanctified. You're keeping
[1:14:25] yourself under the blood. You come in a
[1:14:27] service like this and the Holy Ghost is
[1:14:29] so thick, you say, "God, refill me with
[1:14:31] the Holy Ghost. I need more of you. I
[1:14:34] need more of you than I've ever had
[1:14:35] before." You keep repeating that cycle.
[1:14:38] You never stop. You never quit. You
[1:14:41] don't Being born again, Brother Gabriel.
[1:14:44] Being born again is not a graduation.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; It's actually a beginning.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; You're just now starting to live. Do you
[1:14:53] want me to tell you what the graduation
[1:14:54] is? Well done.
[1:14:56] Thou good and faithful servant, enter in
[1:14:59] the joys of the Lord that's been
[1:15:00] prepared for you from the foundation of
[1:15:02] the world. That's the graduation party,
[1:15:04] Brother Matt.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Getting born again, you're just learning
[1:15:07] how to walk. You're learning how to, you
[1:15:09] know, you're part of the family now.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; You're part of God's family, but you're
[1:15:14] still going to stumble. You're still
[1:15:15] going to fall. You're still going to
[1:15:16] scrape your knees. You're still going to
[1:15:18] going to make mistakes. You're still
[1:15:19] going to say things
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; that you shouldn't.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:15:26] And
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; if you don't believe that, get a toddler
[1:15:28] in your house.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; We have to constantly cleanse ourselves.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; So there is an initial process that you
[1:15:43] go through justification. And they're
[1:15:45] distinct. They're clear. They're
[1:15:47] beautiful. That's
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Justification is a beautiful thing to
[1:15:50] see someone come off the street, be a
[1:15:51] drug addict, be prostitute. I don't care
[1:15:53] what.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And then to come and
[1:15:56] get cleaned up and be and want to serve
[1:15:58] God.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; That is a beautiful powerful thing that
[1:16:01] only the blood of Jesus can do.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; And then you start noticing that they
[1:16:06] quit wearing makeup and they let their
[1:16:08] hair grow and
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; they quit wearing pants or whatever.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden they God starts
[1:16:16] cleansing things out of their lives.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Then they're ready for the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:24] Now there's temptations
[1:16:27] and there's desires
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; and there's a big difference between the
[1:16:32] two.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; So a temptation is comes from the enemy
[1:16:36] and they're a trap that comes from the
[1:16:38] outside not out of you. It comes from
[1:16:41] the outside and Satan is trying to trick
[1:16:43] you to fall, trying to tempt you to do
[1:16:45] evil, trying to tempt you to do wrong.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; But your desire
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; is to please God. There it is.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Your desire is to live for him.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Now, the new birth does not make us
[1:16:58] spiritual robots.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; To where God just gets a thumb drive,
[1:17:04] Brother Jim, and he just puts it right
[1:17:05] there and he downloads his whole will.
[1:17:07] He downloads every step you got to make.
[1:17:09] In a way, it kind of be nice because
[1:17:10] then you don't have to make any
[1:17:12] mistakes, right? You just know exactly
[1:17:15] what God wants you to do. You know
[1:17:16] exactly what God everything. That's a
[1:17:18] bad robot, isn't it?
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:24] But that's not that's not God wants us
[1:17:26] to overcome.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; God ain't going to have robots in
[1:17:30] heaven.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; He's gonna He wants you if it it pleases
[1:17:34] him just like you can just imagine how
[1:17:36] it made him smile. Sit there and look at
[1:17:37] Job and he knew what was in Job. And Job
[1:17:40] with through all of that refused to
[1:17:43] curse God.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; No matter what Satan did to him, Job
[1:17:49] refused to curse God. Amen.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Now, the new birth, as I said, does not
[1:17:54] make a spiritual robots and it does not
[1:17:56] do away with your free moral agency.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; You can make a terrible mistake,
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; but then he'll pay for it. You reap what
[1:18:03] you sow. That that's God's law. He'll
[1:18:05] forgive you. But yet, the new birth will
[1:18:07] align your desire with his.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Whereas the first birth, you wanted to
[1:18:12] do what you wanted to do.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; You wanted to go and and and chase what
[1:18:16] you wanted to chase.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now since a messy experience,
[1:18:22] you're like, "God, what do you want out
[1:18:23] of my life?"
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; You see the difference in the humility
[1:18:27] instead of I'm going to be this and I'm
[1:18:28] going to be that. There's nothing wrong
[1:18:30] with ambition and and you know, hard
[1:18:32] work and ambition. I'm all for that. But
[1:18:33] you got to channel that through the word
[1:18:35] of God, a thinking man's filter.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; So it aligns your desire with his.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; You make mistakes, but you don't have
[1:18:45] the desire to do so.
[1:18:49] And then some people can look the part
[1:18:52] but have a desire for the things of the
[1:18:54] world.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; See, so they can look like they're
[1:18:58] Christians. They can look like they're
[1:18:59] believers, but on the inside they have a
[1:19:01] desire for the things of the world. That
[1:19:04] is why we need a new birth
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; because we were all born with that.
[1:19:10] And I want to just inject here my my a
[1:19:12] part of my little testimony here. I grew
[1:19:14] up in the message.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:18] my whole family, most of my my very
[1:19:20] large family did.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; But see, growing up in the message is a
[1:19:24] wonderful blessing, Brother Jerry,
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; but it's not a shortcut.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; It's a blessing, but not a shortcut.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; So, growing up, you know, we'd listen to
[1:19:38] tapes a lot and just, you know, hear my
[1:19:40] parents talk about you need the Holy
[1:19:41] Ghost. We all need the Holy Ghost. We
[1:19:43] need the Holy Ghost. So, I began to
[1:19:45] desire it. And I'd pray. I didn't even
[1:19:46] know what it I didn't really understand
[1:19:48] what it was. I just knew I needed it
[1:19:49] because that's what I heard. So that's
[1:19:50] what I would pray. That's what I'd pray.
[1:19:52] That's what I'd pray. I didn't
[1:19:52] understand everything, but I knew I
[1:19:54] needed it. So when I was about 12, I had
[1:19:56] a dream. My sister, older sister, was
[1:19:58] also believing for the Holy Ghost and
[1:20:00] and praying and things. And I had a a
[1:20:02] wonderful dream. I dreamed that we were
[1:20:05] both kneeling at the foot of a man. He
[1:20:08] was in a white robe.
[1:20:10] And my sister in the dream had gotten
[1:20:12] the Holy Ghost. And this man had laid
[1:20:13] his hands on my head. And my sister in
[1:20:15] the dream said, "William, you're you're
[1:20:16] getting the Holy Ghost." And I'll never
[1:20:18] forget, I was 12. A sensation went from
[1:20:23] the top of my head. I've never
[1:20:24] experienced nothing quite like this. And
[1:20:27] as and I could feel it traveling through
[1:20:29] my body. And as it left, I didn't feel
[1:20:30] it anywhere else. And it literally went
[1:20:31] out my toes.
[1:20:34] And I woke up
[1:20:36] and I was it woke me up.
[1:20:40] So, I began to I told the dream to my
[1:20:42] family and I began to testify
[1:20:45] that I got the Holy Ghost. I even
[1:20:46] printed it and framed my little
[1:20:47] testimony that I had the Holy Ghost.
[1:20:51] But a few years as time went by and a
[1:20:53] few years went by,
[1:20:56] my life and the desires I still had did
[1:20:59] not line up with what I what I felt in
[1:21:02] that dream.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; So, what was I to do? either it was a
[1:21:08] beautiful sweet spiritual dream but the
[1:21:10] the the final evidence is a reality of
[1:21:14] your life
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; now that could even have been God
[1:21:19] showing for showing me but I took it as
[1:21:21] when I felt the sensation that's when I
[1:21:23] got it but my life following after did
[1:21:27] not follow the dream
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; it was a sweet dream but I did not have
[1:21:34] the Holy Ghost that way
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; right
[1:21:38] In the church age book, brother Ray
[1:21:39] would make a statement,
[1:21:41] we have gone by experience and not the
[1:21:44] word.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; He said away with experience as your
[1:21:46] measuring line. There's only one plum
[1:21:48] line, only one rod. That is the word.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; He said, Paul said, have you received
[1:21:54] the Holy Ghost since you believed? This
[1:21:56] is the whole of our problem right here.
[1:21:57] People repent of their sins. They get
[1:21:59] baptized in waters, but they don't go on
[1:22:01] and receive the Holy Ghost. You believe
[1:22:03] unto receiving the spirit. Believing on
[1:22:05] Jesus is a step in the right direction,
[1:22:07] which is toward the Holy Ghost. But
[1:22:09] people stop there.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; You've got to go all the way.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; So, a few years later, I was 15.
[1:22:17] And let me also let me let me say this.
[1:22:20] How many people here are still single?
[1:22:25] Okay.
[1:22:27] Take this opportunity in your life
[1:22:32] to listen to the message, to study the
[1:22:36] word,
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; to pray, read your Bible, all them
[1:22:40] things
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; like never before.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; You say, "Why, preacher?" Because
[1:22:45] whenever, just as the scripture says,
[1:22:47] whenever you get married and ever family
[1:22:50] comes along, life, even though you think
[1:22:52] you're really busy now, and I'm not
[1:22:54] denying that,
[1:22:56] but if you think you're busy now, wait
[1:22:59] till you have a family.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; You'll never have the time that you have
[1:23:04] right now.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; So, whenever you invest, whenever you
[1:23:07] make that spiritual investment within
[1:23:09] yourself,
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; when the God sends you a mate, and while
[1:23:12] you're at it, pray for a mate. Say,
[1:23:14] "God, if if you're not if you know, if
[1:23:16] you don't feel like they're around, say,
[1:23:17] God, wherever they are, you bring them
[1:23:19] to me.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Bring me to them. Pray for that person."
[1:23:23] But you're making that spiritual
[1:23:25] investment in yourself so that when you
[1:23:27] do get married, y'all are going to be
[1:23:28] awesome husbands.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Y'all are going to be wonderful wives.
[1:23:32] Y'all are going to be wonderful mothers.
[1:23:33] Y'all are going to be wonderful fathers.
[1:23:34] Why? Because you're investing in your
[1:23:37] future.
[1:23:41] Because now when you come home from
[1:23:42] work, you come home from school, you
[1:23:43] don't have the distraction of having to
[1:23:45] provide and all the things that come
[1:23:47] with life. You don't have the trials
[1:23:50] that you have as you get older.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; So make that investment in yourself now.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Good job.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; So I was 15 years old and trying to do
[1:24:01] this
[1:24:03] and I was listening to and I was still,
[1:24:04] you know, crying out to God and God had
[1:24:06] revealed to me there were things in my
[1:24:07] life that wasn't right. Now remember,
[1:24:09] he's not going to fill you if you're not
[1:24:11] sanctified correctly.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Remember, he's not going to fill the
[1:24:15] glass if it's still dirty.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; So my glass still had to be cleaned. So
[1:24:21] once my glass got clean, I was in my
[1:24:24] bedroom by myself and I would listen to
[1:24:27] the tape of souls that are in prison
[1:24:29] now.
[1:24:32] And the prophet of God begins to go
[1:24:33] through there and he's preaching on the
[1:24:34] third pool and and and when the part of
[1:24:36] the third pool and mercy is over and he
[1:24:38] had that vision of hell and my goodness
[1:24:40] when I heard that
[1:24:43] I knew I never wanted to go to a place
[1:24:47] like that.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Now everybody has their own sermon. Some
[1:24:50] people come to the Lord and get the new
[1:24:51] birth on just on a very on on a very
[1:24:55] like I guess if I if I can say this
[1:24:57] correct like a very like a positive
[1:24:58] note. But those that are in this prison
[1:25:00] now is a very is a powerful sermon, but
[1:25:03] it's one of them.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; It'll grip you.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; You having the Holy Ghost that'll still
[1:25:09] grip you.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; It'll make you check up. It's just one
[1:25:12] of them sermons. And I fell on my knees
[1:25:15] right by my bed. No preacher,
[1:25:19] no, you know, it don't have to be. It
[1:25:21] can be in church. Praise the Lord if it
[1:25:22] is, but it doesn't have to be. What was
[1:25:24] that young man that got it on a lawn
[1:25:25] mower? All right.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; God is sovereign.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; And I cried out to God. And let me tell
[1:25:31] you something. It was a mess.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; But it brought life.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; It brought life.
[1:25:40] So, how do I become born again? How do I
[1:25:42] get the Holy Ghost? As I said in Acts
[1:25:45] 2:38, Peter said unto them, "Repent and
[1:25:48] be baptized every one of you in the name
[1:25:50] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:25:51] your sins, and ye shall receive the gift
[1:25:54] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:56] You have to die.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; The only way for Jesus Christ to live in
[1:26:01] you is you have got to die. In Psalm
[1:26:06] 51:17, "The sacrifices of God are a
[1:26:08] broken spirit, a broken and a contrite
[1:26:11] heart, oh God, thou will not despise."
[1:26:15] Jesus said in in Matthew 16:25,
[1:26:18] "For whosoever shall save his life shall
[1:26:20] lose it, and whosoever shall will lose
[1:26:23] his life for my sake shall find it."
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; That's a deep statement right there. How
[1:26:28] can I save my life by losing it?
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; You lose your first life,
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; and you're going to get it in the second
[1:26:36] in the new birth.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; The only way you can be reborn is to
[1:26:41] completely die to yourself. That's
[1:26:43] right.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; 100%.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; If you cry out to God for the Holy Ghost
[1:26:49] and you've got and you've got a streak
[1:26:51] of of of like a reservement, there's a
[1:26:53] part of your life you just don't want to
[1:26:55] give up, God's not going to fill you.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Because remember, God can see that.
[1:27:03] We'll come and we'll pray for you.
[1:27:06] But God knows your heart when you come.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; And he knows if you're really really
[1:27:12] fully surrendering,
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Any part of you that's unsurrendered
[1:27:17] cannot be reborn.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; You've got to be willing to die out of
[1:27:19] everything, all your worldly desires,
[1:27:21] ambitions.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God was saying in the
[1:27:25] token, full obedience to the whole word
[1:27:28] of God will entitle you to the token.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. Amen.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Full obedience.
[1:27:33] So, somebody cannot get the Holy Ghost
[1:27:35] baptized in titles
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; because they haven't fully obeyed.
[1:27:39] Somebody can't get the Holy Ghost if
[1:27:40] they haven't been sanctified because
[1:27:41] they haven't fully obeyed. Somebody
[1:27:43] can't get the Holy Ghost or get born
[1:27:44] again when they haven't even repented.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Full obedience to the word will entitle
[1:27:52] you to the token. Think about that. It
[1:27:54] means then it's your inheritance. You
[1:27:56] are entitled to it. It belongs to you.
[1:27:59] Hallelujah.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; But it requires full obedience.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Abel knew what this meant.
[1:28:09] Abel was ready and willing to die with
[1:28:12] the sacrifice.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; He was not willing when when he was not
[1:28:16] willing to appease Cain by being
[1:28:18] inclusive and saying, "I'll tell you
[1:28:19] what, Cain. Here's this bloody, messy,
[1:28:21] nasty sacrifice, but let me get some of
[1:28:23] you a fruit and just that way we can all
[1:28:25] get along.
[1:28:28] You know, you you're really upset about
[1:28:30] it, but let's just add some fruit to
[1:28:32] this altar. No, it was blood only. Blood
[1:28:34] alone.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; In the resurrection of of Lazarus,
[1:28:38] brother said, Abel led his lamb away by
[1:28:40] a grape vine, sacrificed him on the
[1:28:42] altar, and Abel died on the same altar
[1:28:45] his sacrificed lamb died.
[1:28:48] And every believer that comes to Christ
[1:28:51] must die
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; on the same altar with his dying lamb,
[1:28:55] Christ, and die in Christ to be a new
[1:28:57] creature. Die out to the things of the
[1:28:59] world and become born again, a new
[1:29:01] creature in Christ Jesus. Die on the
[1:29:03] same altar of self-sacrifice.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; But as as human beings in our first
[1:29:09] birth, we try that. There's pride, maybe
[1:29:11] a little arrogancy, and there's things
[1:29:13] that we withhold.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; It's simple. But it's so hard for the
[1:29:19] human element.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; It's so hard to just say, "Lord, I'm
[1:29:24] just no good." It's easy. It's simple,
[1:29:27] should I say? But you got to be willing
[1:29:29] to die.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; In Galatians 2:20, Paul said, "I am
[1:29:34] crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I
[1:29:37] live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in
[1:29:38] me. And the life which I now live in the
[1:29:40] flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:29:42] God, who loved me and gave himself for
[1:29:44] me."
[1:29:46] You're not really ready to live for this
[1:29:49] message
[1:29:51] until you're ready to die for it.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Let me say it again. You're not fit to
[1:29:58] live until you're fit to die.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; You've got to be so convinced.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Abel never compromised on his
[1:30:10] revelation.
[1:30:13] Now think whenever Abel had whenever
[1:30:16] remember full obedience to the word
[1:30:18] entitled you to the token. Abel had his
[1:30:20] lamb on that altar and what did God do?
[1:30:23] There was canaines here fruit beautiful
[1:30:26] gold most beautiful thing you've ever
[1:30:28] seen and Abel's nasty looking altar over
[1:30:31] here all bloody.
[1:30:34] So how
[1:30:36] did Cain and Abel know which one pleased
[1:30:39] God?
[1:30:42] God consumed Abel's sacrifice.
[1:30:46] The fire of God came down and fell on
[1:30:49] Abel's sacrifice. And God vindicated
[1:30:52] Abel's sacrifice. And that is what
[1:30:55] caused the jealousy and hatred to swell
[1:30:58] up within Cain.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; As long as both sacrifices were laying
[1:31:02] there, scripture versus scripture,
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Quote versus quote.
[1:31:09] But which one is God going to vindicate?
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God preached out of the
[1:31:15] same Bible as the trinitarian.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Same Bible.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; But which ministry did God vindicate?
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; When God came down and vindicated Abel's
[1:31:27] message, that's how God spoke.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; How many times on tape do you hear the
[1:31:31] prophet of God preach and he's coming to
[1:31:33] the end of his sermon and he said, "Now,
[1:31:35] if I've told you the truth,
[1:31:38] Let God come and back me up.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; He would never back up. He'd never
[1:31:45] vindicate a lie.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; This is a vindicated message.
[1:31:53] When God sees when God looks down and he
[1:31:55] sees you willing to lay yourself on the
[1:31:57] altar and he knows that you're just done
[1:32:00] with yourself,
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; that you're literally done with
[1:32:04] yourself.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; He'll come down in a Holy Ghost fire and
[1:32:09] he'll consume you.
[1:32:13] He'll consume your life. You lay
[1:32:16] yourself down on the altar and say,
[1:32:18] "God, I've got nothing but myself.
[1:32:22] I want to lay myself down on the exact
[1:32:24] same altar
[1:32:27] and he'll come down and he'll consume
[1:32:28] you.
[1:32:31] In Romans 6:11, Paul says, "What shall
[1:32:33] we say then? Shall we continue in sin
[1:32:35] that grace may abound? God forbid. How
[1:32:38] shall we that are dead to sin live any
[1:32:40] longer therein? Know ye not that so many
[1:32:42] of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus
[1:32:44] were baptized into his death? Therefore,
[1:32:47] we are buried with him by baptism into
[1:32:49] death, that like as Christ was raised up
[1:32:51] from the dead by the glory of the
[1:32:53] Father, even so we should walk in
[1:32:55] newness of life. For if we have been
[1:32:58] planted together in the likeness of his
[1:33:00] death, we shall also in the likeness of
[1:33:02] his resurrection,
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; knowing this, that our old man is
[1:33:09] crucified with him, that the body of sin
[1:33:12] might be destroyed, that henceforth we
[1:33:14] should not serve sin. For he that is
[1:33:16] dead is freed from sin.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful?
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; You think of Elijah when he went down to
[1:33:25] challenge the children of bell. You talk
[1:33:26] about God consuming the sacrifice.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; He went and he had a vision what was
[1:33:31] going to happen and he goes and he be
[1:33:32] and he he makes a the prophet of God
[1:33:34] called their Mount Carmel showdown. And
[1:33:36] he told call all the prophets of B.
[1:33:38] said, "You get them all together and you
[1:33:39] do the sacrifices and let the God that
[1:33:42] answers by fire
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; be God."
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; You talk about an unmistakable
[1:33:48] challenge. It is a clear distinction.
[1:33:50] The God that answers by fire,
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; let that God be God. So, we know the
[1:33:56] story. And they begin to cut themselves
[1:33:57] and call on him all day. But in the e at
[1:34:00] the time of the evening sacrifice
[1:34:04] in the evening time Elijah begins to
[1:34:07] rebuild the altar of God. He begins to
[1:34:10] restore proper worship in Israel.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; And he tell he tells him fill. So not
[1:34:17] only did he lay the sacrifice all out,
[1:34:20] but he actually made it more impossible.
[1:34:23] He said fill four barrels full of water.
[1:34:25] And they just said pour it on sacrifice.
[1:34:27] And here goes four. Do it again. Boy,
[1:34:30] them servants must have been tired.
[1:34:32] Doing it again.
[1:34:34] A third time. Do it again.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; 12 barrels of water. It kept getting
[1:34:40] more impossible, more impossible, more
[1:34:42] soaking, more soaking. More soaking.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; And then First Kings 18:36, "And it came
[1:34:49] to pass, sorry, let's read down in verse
[1:34:52] 38, 37. Hear me, oh Lord. Hear me that
[1:34:54] this people may know that thou art the
[1:34:56] Lord God, that thou has turned their
[1:34:57] heart back again. Then the fire of the
[1:35:00] Lord fell and consumed the burnt
[1:35:02] sacrifice and the wood and the stones
[1:35:03] and the dust and licked up the water
[1:35:05] that was in the trench.
[1:35:08] And when the people saw it, they fell on
[1:35:09] their faces and they said, "The Lord, he
[1:35:12] is God. The Lord, he is God."
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; I say amen to that.
[1:35:20] Samson,
[1:35:23] he wouldn't fully surrender his life. He
[1:35:26] surrendered his strength, but remember
[1:35:27] he wouldn't surrender his heart.
[1:35:30] So what happened? We all know the story.
[1:35:32] He found himself in a layan condition.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; He fell asleep in the lap of a woman of
[1:35:40] ill fame.
[1:35:43] She lied to him that she loved him.
[1:35:46] Let me tell you, the world, Satan
[1:35:47] through the world, through your worldly
[1:35:49] friends or associates or whatever that's
[1:35:50] trying to get you away from this truth
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; is lying that they love you.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; They're lying that they're your friends.
[1:35:57] They're lying that they have your back.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; So Samson found himself in the leotan
[1:36:03] condition and he was sport for the
[1:36:05] enemy. You think about that here. He
[1:36:07] went from such mighty victories, killing
[1:36:09] a thousand Philistines with a with a
[1:36:11] brittle jawbone of a mule and carrying
[1:36:13] the gates of Gaza uphill and just
[1:36:14] impossible feats of strength when the
[1:36:16] anointing of God would fall upon him.
[1:36:18] And then at his end,
[1:36:21] his eyes are put out. He's no doubt
[1:36:23] naked and he he's he's miserable. He's
[1:36:26] blind. He's lost everything and he's
[1:36:29] grinding in the meal for the enemy. Come
[1:36:31] on.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; If that's not a le oysian condition, I
[1:36:34] don't know what is.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Brother dramatizing and he said that
[1:36:38] Samson, what must be going through
[1:36:39] Samson's mind of all the victories that
[1:36:41] he's won?
[1:36:43] And he's beginning to to to break in on
[1:36:45] a conversation here between Samson and
[1:36:47] the boy. And he said, "Little boy, put
[1:36:50] one of my hands upon this post. It's
[1:36:52] possible. Oh my. Lead me to the post
[1:36:55] that holds this because I want to rest
[1:36:57] my hands. I'm tired. I've been made fun
[1:36:59] of long enough." In other words, brother
[1:37:01] Ray, brother Ray, he was looking for
[1:37:03] that loadbearing wall.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; That's what he was really looking for.
[1:37:07] He said, 'I know, Samson speaking here
[1:37:09] says, 'I know, Lord, what it's going to
[1:37:11] cost, but maybe you will. There is a
[1:37:15] possibility.
[1:37:17] You're full of mercy. I failed you,
[1:37:19] Lord. He said, that ought to be the cry
[1:37:21] of the church tonight.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Remember, Brother Ron preached on once
[1:37:24] on um try again last weekend.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; You talk about Samson trying again.
[1:37:29] That's right,
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; little lad. Would you put my hand upon
[1:37:32] one pillar? Yes. Put my hand upon the
[1:37:34] other pillar? Yes. Is my hands placed
[1:37:36] right? He couldn't even see. Yes, they
[1:37:39] are right. And he started to pray. He
[1:37:41] said, "Lord, revenge my eyes." In other
[1:37:44] words, I've done wrong, but just once
[1:37:47] more, Lord.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; There stood that big bulk of frame,
[1:37:51] powerless and helpless. All at once, he
[1:37:53] began to feel something happening. every
[1:37:56] fiber in his body began to fill with the
[1:37:58] power of God.
[1:38:01] He said, "Those big brrawy muscles
[1:38:02] straightened up and he crushed it
[1:38:04] together. Let me die with him, Lord. Let
[1:38:06] me die with him. You raised me to
[1:38:08] destroy it. Now I built myself up around
[1:38:10] it. Let me destroy myself with it. My
[1:38:13] reputation, my whatever it is, let me
[1:38:16] destroy it. I want to see the power of
[1:38:19] God again." Amen.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Samson's heart in the last few minutes
[1:38:23] of his life was finally ready to fully
[1:38:25] surrender.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Look at what condition he had to get in
[1:38:29] before he was able to finally fully
[1:38:31] surrender.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; And when Samson was finally willing to
[1:38:36] surrender, he got more done in five
[1:38:39] minutes,
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Than he did in his entire life put
[1:38:43] together.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; The Bible said he killed more
[1:38:46] Philistines at that event. That's
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; right. that all came to watch and
[1:38:51] spectate and make fun of Samson. He
[1:38:52] killed more at that moment than he did
[1:38:54] his entire life
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; because he fully surrendered.
[1:38:58] The prophet says, "Always when the power
[1:39:00] of God comes in, the walls that you've
[1:39:03] built around you fall.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Your denominational walls will crush and
[1:39:09] God will be known again." He's the same
[1:39:11] yesterday, today, and forever. his every
[1:39:14] fiber filling with the Holy Ghost, every
[1:39:16] muscle filled, every bit of his body was
[1:39:18] filled up with the Holy Ghost. That was
[1:39:20] Samson's greatest victory.
[1:39:23] When he was ready to die,
[1:39:28] Moses was raised in the message.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; He was raised and he was groomed by his
[1:39:33] mother that he was the deliverer. So at
[1:39:35] the age of about 40 years old, he was
[1:39:38] willing to surrender his throne, but he
[1:39:41] wasn't ready to surrender his heart
[1:39:43] fully yet. He still had his own ideas on
[1:39:46] how to be a deliverer. But then God took
[1:39:48] him in the wilderness for another 40
[1:39:50] years and had to get it all out of him.
[1:39:53] So when he was 80 years old,
[1:39:57] you're never too old to be used of God.
[1:39:59] Amen.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; When he was 80 years old, God got his
[1:40:03] attention with a burning bush.
[1:40:06] And let me say this, we all need our own
[1:40:10] burning bush experience.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; The prophet would call it sacred sands.
[1:40:16] He said, "Oh, for those sacred sands, he
[1:40:19] has to take every real child there. He
[1:40:22] gets you on those places where there's
[1:40:24] no devil can ever come.
[1:40:26] There's no teacher can ever explain it
[1:40:28] away. He gives you something on those
[1:40:30] sands back there that of experience that
[1:40:31] you'll never forget as long as the ages
[1:40:34] roll on.
[1:40:36] No matter how atheiotic your mother,
[1:40:39] your daddy, your husband, wife, your
[1:40:42] associates may become, every true
[1:40:43] believer has that spot where God met
[1:40:47] them.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Now, that is very, very important
[1:40:50] because Satan is going to test you.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, I've had to take
[1:40:56] Satan back so many times to that spot.
[1:40:58] There's like a game trail.
[1:41:01] There ain't no grass growing there.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Because he's going to try you. That's
[1:41:07] why you got to have a undeniable new
[1:41:10] birth experience. Because when Satan
[1:41:12] comes against you, and he will, you can
[1:41:14] say, "No, come back, devil. This is
[1:41:16] where it happened. This is where I got
[1:41:19] my new birth." And there's nothing that
[1:41:22] you can do to convince me that that
[1:41:24] didn't happen.
[1:41:26] that belongs to you.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "Every true believer has that
[1:41:31] spot. There isn't one left out. Every
[1:41:33] believer has it. Every believer that's
[1:41:35] born of the kingdom of God knows that
[1:41:37] spot, that minute, that hour where God
[1:41:40] took him. That is your sister Stephanie.
[1:41:43] That is your sacred moment.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Sister Gabriella, that is your sacred
[1:41:49] moment.
[1:41:53] And nothing can ever take that away from
[1:41:55] you.
[1:41:57] Moses, after that burning bush
[1:41:58] experience, he was ready.
[1:42:01] He had a lot of supernatural
[1:42:03] vindication.
[1:42:04] But do you know the highlight of his
[1:42:05] ministry in Egypt,
[1:42:08] was not the fleas, was not the flies,
[1:42:10] was not the frogs, was not the turn of
[1:42:12] the water to blood. The highlight of his
[1:42:14] ministry, Brother Chris, was the token.
[1:42:20] That was the highlight of Moses's
[1:42:22] ministry
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; because all them other things was just
[1:42:24] to vindicate Moses.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Vindicate that God spoke was dealing
[1:42:29] with Moses and it was time to go.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; So we have to do you believe this
[1:42:35] message enough
[1:42:37] to apply the token
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; after all the manifestations and all the
[1:42:41] vindication that we seen. Do we believe
[1:42:44] the message enough to say God sent us a
[1:42:46] prophet? Right.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; We have got to apply the token
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; to our lives, to our homes,
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; because it's time to leave.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Israel had to believe Moses. Now,
[1:42:59] whenever they were applying the token,
[1:43:01] there was no thunder and lightning. And
[1:43:03] it was a very solemn thing,
[1:43:08] but they had to believe the word of a
[1:43:10] prophet
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; that it was time to apply the token.
[1:43:15] Brother Ram says, "You say,"I believe.
[1:43:17] Yes, I believe the message." That's all
[1:43:20] right. That's good.
[1:43:22] But you must have the token.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Remember the new birth, the token, the
[1:43:27] Holy Ghost is all the same thing. He
[1:43:29] says, "Do you hear brand of tabernacle?"
[1:43:30] I like to say, "Do you hear FGLT?"
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; You must have the token displayed.
[1:43:37] Without it, all your believing is in
[1:43:40] vain.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; See, you'll live a good life. You'll
[1:43:42] listen to what the word says. You'll go
[1:43:44] to church. You'll try and live right.
[1:43:45] That's fine. But that's not it. When I
[1:43:48] see the blood, that is the token.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Think of how close somebody can be to
[1:43:55] have a bucket of blood but be too
[1:43:58] ashamed or be too proud or whatever and
[1:44:00] to stick it in the corner of their
[1:44:02] house. Don't miss the rapture with this
[1:44:05] message in your house. Don't miss the
[1:44:07] rapture with the picture of the prophet
[1:44:09] on the wall. Get the token. That within
[1:44:12] itself is not the token. But get to what
[1:44:14] he said. He's pointing us to the Lord
[1:44:17] Jesus Christ.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; I'm not satisfied with just a good life.
[1:44:21] I want him. I want the token.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Paul would say, "If only in this life we
[1:44:26] have hope in Christ, we're of all men
[1:44:28] most miserable." That's right.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; When you have the token and you have the
[1:44:38] Holy Ghost,
[1:44:40] put it under any test and it'll prove
[1:44:43] itself.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "Whenever a man comes
[1:44:48] around a woman with a token, it's laying
[1:44:51] there."
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; When a woman comes around a man that's
[1:44:53] not her husband, the token is laying
[1:44:55] there. When you go around in in your
[1:44:58] daily life, the token is there.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; When nobody is watching, no human eyes
[1:45:03] are watching, the token is there.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; You've got to be identified with your
[1:45:09] sacrifice. You can't just have it. It's
[1:45:12] not good enough to kill the lamb and
[1:45:14] like I said, you put it in a bucket.
[1:45:15] It's got to be applied. You cannot be
[1:45:17] ashamed to have the token on display.
[1:45:20] Remember
[1:45:24] the literal blood of Jesus having it on
[1:45:27] your having it on your hands did not
[1:45:29] bring a person redemption or the Roman
[1:45:31] soldiers would have been saved but it's
[1:45:34] the life behind the blood.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Now this new birth we're going to find a
[1:45:42] a spot to close here.
[1:45:45] the new birth. There's an evidence of a
[1:45:47] new birth. In 2 Corinthians 5:17, one of
[1:45:50] my favorite scriptures says, "Therefore,
[1:45:52] if any man be in Christ, he is a new
[1:45:54] creature.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Old things are passed away, behold, all
[1:46:02] things are become new."
[1:46:04] One of the evidences of a new birth when
[1:46:07] you have the Holy Ghost
[1:46:10] is that this word is everyday living to
[1:46:12] you.
[1:46:14] So, what does everyday living to me
[1:46:15] mean? Well, that means that it's just
[1:46:17] like breathing.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; No one's got to sit there and say,
[1:46:20] "Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in.
[1:46:24] Breathe out."
[1:46:27] It just happens. Your heart just beats.
[1:46:29] It's just living.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; That's what this word is.
[1:46:32] If you find yourself struggling to live
[1:46:35] and you're finding yourself struggling
[1:46:36] with parts of the word, not that you
[1:46:38] can't understand, but if you find
[1:46:39] yourself having trouble accepting parts
[1:46:42] of the word, you need a new birth.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; You need a new birth. This word is
[1:46:50] everyday living to you.
[1:46:57] If the earth truly receives an apple
[1:46:59] seed, it'll produce apples.
[1:47:03] So, the genuine evidence of the Holy
[1:47:05] Ghost, the prophet said, is to be able
[1:47:07] to say amen to the word of God.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Now, the best way to say amen with the
[1:47:16] word of God
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; is with your life.
[1:47:21] We say amen with our mouth.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; But the real amen is with your life.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Now see, brother Brandham would bring
[1:47:29] out certain points. See, you have to
[1:47:30] realize he was dealing with certain
[1:47:32] congregations who put so much on love.
[1:47:34] You've got to love. No matter what the
[1:47:36] Bible says or don't matter how you live,
[1:47:37] you just have to love, love, love, love.
[1:47:39] So, Brother Brand would have to get
[1:47:41] there and dispel that and say, you know,
[1:47:43] who showed more love?
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Who showed more fruits of the spirit?
[1:47:46] You had certain ideologies that said
[1:47:48] it's just the fruits of the spirit. And
[1:47:50] then he would come down and say, "All
[1:47:51] right, who showed more fruits of the
[1:47:52] spirit? When Jesus when he cast down the
[1:47:54] money changers tables or that kind old
[1:47:56] priest?"
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; So he was, you have to realize who he
[1:48:00] was talking to. But that does not do
[1:48:02] away with the fact that the fruits of
[1:48:04] the spirit are the fruits of the spirit.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; That don't mean that somebody can get a
[1:48:10] message book, hold it on their arm, and
[1:48:11] say, "Bless God, I say amen to every
[1:48:13] word of God." And live like a devil.
[1:48:15] Right?
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Because they say amen and they've got a
[1:48:18] quote to say that I said amen to every
[1:48:20] word. So the prophet of God said I got
[1:48:21] the Holy Ghost. No,
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; you don't have the life, you don't have
[1:48:26] the life. You don't have the life,
[1:48:28] you're not born again. You don't have
[1:48:29] his life.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; So whenever a prophet said that the
[1:48:34] evidence of the Holy Ghost is he that
[1:48:35] can believe the word and receive it,
[1:48:37] it's actually magnifying the fruits of
[1:48:39] the spirit. Amen.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; When you listen to that to the token
[1:48:44] message, he talks about love being the
[1:48:47] evidence all through it as well.
[1:48:50] So don't get sidetracked. There are
[1:48:52] fruits of the spirit and they are in
[1:48:53] Galatians 5:22. But the fruit of the
[1:48:55] spirit is love, joy, peace,
[1:48:57] longsuffering, gentleness, goodness,
[1:48:59] faith, meekness, temperance. Against
[1:49:00] such there is no law. And they that are
[1:49:03] Christ have crucified the flesh with the
[1:49:05] affections and lust. So if like like I
[1:49:08] said a few moments ago, if you plant an
[1:49:09] apple seed, you're going to get apples.
[1:49:11] So if you plant, in other words, a new
[1:49:13] birth, if a new birth comes inside of
[1:49:16] you, you're going to get the fruits of
[1:49:17] the spirit. You're going to say, "Amen.
[1:49:19] You're going to believe every part of
[1:49:21] this message. Even the things you can't
[1:49:22] understand, you'll believe it because
[1:49:24] you know what? As I said, the new birth,
[1:49:26] you're you're just coming into things,
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; You don't immediately just mature and
[1:49:31] just know all things. Nobody does.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; We grow. And the way you grow is by you
[1:49:36] eating. If you quit eating, a child
[1:49:38] quits eating, they'll become
[1:49:39] malnourished.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Because when God, let me I'll say I'll
[1:49:48] say this too. When God gives you the
[1:49:49] Holy Ghost, God is always sweet. The
[1:49:52] Lord Jesus is always so sweet.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; But whenever you're a newborn babe, he
[1:49:57] takes special he takes really good care
[1:49:59] of you.
[1:50:04] and he draws himself very near to you.
[1:50:07] And that is the time you got to
[1:50:08] constantly eat. You got to constantly
[1:50:11] drink because let me tell you a
[1:50:12] Christian life is a journey.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; And the journey is not always through an
[1:50:16] oasis. The journey is not just always by
[1:50:19] the river and lowanging fruit and
[1:50:21] everything so wonderful. You're going to
[1:50:23] go through some times. You're going to
[1:50:24] go through some droughts. You're going
[1:50:26] to go through some sticky places. And
[1:50:28] you got to be so well rooted
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; and you got to tap into that that that
[1:50:33] river that flows from within you, that
[1:50:35] new birth. You got to be tapped in
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; like David said in Psalm 1 that he shall
[1:50:40] be like a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:50:43] water.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Our experience
[1:50:47] has got to live.
[1:50:52] It's got to live. Remember when Jesus
[1:50:56] getting ready to close, when Jesus,
[1:50:59] he was God from the first breath to the
[1:51:01] last, he's still God. But when Jesus
[1:51:04] went to the River Jordan,
[1:51:07] the Holy Ghost came on him and he was
[1:51:09] anointed for his earthly ministry. When
[1:51:11] John the Baptist came and he said, "I
[1:51:12] have need to be baptized." When he came
[1:51:14] to John,
[1:51:17] he said, "I have need to be baptized of
[1:51:18] thee." And what did Jesus tell him?
[1:51:20] Suffer it to be so. Now, when the Holy
[1:51:22] Spirit, when John seen the Holy Spirit
[1:51:23] descend upon him like a dove, watch the
[1:51:26] order of the scripture, what did that
[1:51:28] same Holy Spirit that anointed him?
[1:51:32] What did that Holy Spirit do with Jesus?
[1:51:36] Took him right into the wilderness
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; to be tempted of the devil.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; The spirit allow me to go through hard
[1:51:43] times and hard temptations. It did him
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; and it will us.
[1:51:52] That's right.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; So, no matter where you are in your
[1:51:55] journey, we're all on a journey.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; We're a a body of believers and and and
[1:52:01] we love every single one of you.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Don't let the enemy ever the
[1:52:08] circumstances of life or the
[1:52:09] circumstances of of fellowship or
[1:52:11] whatever it is, don't ever let the enemy
[1:52:13] think put in your mind that we don't
[1:52:16] love you with all of our heart.
[1:52:19] every single one of you.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; And we want
[1:52:23] our desire as ministers is that we all
[1:52:27] go in the rapture together.
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; That is our desire.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; And sometimes, you know, when when the
[1:52:34] preaching gets going, it may feel like
[1:52:35] it just it just you have to draw your
[1:52:37] toes in, but you know, that's that's out
[1:52:38] of love. That
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful for a prophet that
[1:52:42] told you the truth?
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; There's one quote. I didn't get to it,
[1:52:45] but he said, "You have to die. The
[1:52:47] problem is people don't stay there long
[1:52:48] enough. He said, "You have to rot."
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Sorry." He said, "I don't
[1:52:52] know how else to say." He said, "That's
[1:52:53] just sass religion." He said, "You but
[1:52:54] you have to rot." In another spot when
[1:52:57] he's telling his life story, he talked
[1:52:59] about him being sick or or something
[1:53:00] about puking. And he said, "Excuse me."
[1:53:02] He said, "But I'm just as sick when I
[1:53:04] puke as you are when you vomit."
[1:53:08] He just used good old English. And
[1:53:10] that's what we like. Just tell us what
[1:53:12] you mean.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; He wasn't pro. He wasn't polished and
[1:53:16] proper and this and that. And I'm
[1:53:17] thankful for it because I know I I know
[1:53:19] what he means.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; So, we're thankful that we have the word
[1:53:23] that no matter how much it even hurt him
[1:53:25] to have trinitarian friends and all them
[1:53:26] things and he would preach the godhead
[1:53:28] and he wouldn't budge a bit on it.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; And that's what real love is.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Do you remember that woman? I don't even
[1:53:34] know why I'm here, but do you remember
[1:53:36] that woman that was a Sunday school
[1:53:38] teacher,
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; right? And brother Ram was trying to get
[1:53:41] her and as a prophet he could see that
[1:53:43] she was getting a call on her life and
[1:53:45] she he tried to get her and and and deal
[1:53:47] with her and he and she got embarrassed
[1:53:50] and she got out after him after service
[1:53:52] and said don't you ever embarrass me
[1:53:54] like that again and he said well sister
[1:53:56] God was dealing with you and and and I
[1:53:58] was that was just your that was your
[1:53:59] time. Well, she went on became a Sunday
[1:54:01] school and she went through life and she
[1:54:03] got some kind of disease. Might have
[1:54:05] been venerial for all I remember, but it
[1:54:06] was a bad disease.
[1:54:08] And she went in the hospital and and her
[1:54:11] denominational preacher went there and
[1:54:13] tried to pray for her and things like
[1:54:14] that. And he was, you know, smoking and
[1:54:16] and living a life unworthy of the
[1:54:18] gospel. And right at the time of her
[1:54:21] death
[1:54:23] when the wrong
[1:54:26] messengers came for her, let me put it
[1:54:28] like that. And she began to see in that
[1:54:30] other dimension and be able to see
[1:54:32] chains of darkness and and evil spirits
[1:54:34] and demons coming to get her. She began
[1:54:36] to cry out at that impostor preacher for
[1:54:39] not telling her the truth. She said,
[1:54:40] "You deceiver.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Real love is the truth."
[1:54:48] And this message is a message of grace
[1:54:50] and it's love.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; And as I said, no matter where you are
[1:54:54] in your journey, I encourage you to keep
[1:54:58] traveling on. If you're if you're
[1:55:00] justified and you've repented of your
[1:55:02] sins and the blood of Jesus has cleansed
[1:55:04] you, praise God, my brother and sister,
[1:55:07] but move on to sanctification.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; There is a power that can take desires
[1:55:13] out of your life like this.
[1:55:17] There is a power.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; And if you're sanctified and you're just
[1:55:22] on the mountain top that God has
[1:55:23] delivered you from all these different
[1:55:24] things, that is so wonderful. That is a
[1:55:26] work of grace. That is a powerful work
[1:55:29] of the gospel.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; But then move on to the Holy Ghost.
[1:55:33] That's right.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Because remember Jesus taught if a
[1:55:35] person is empty
[1:55:37] and they don't get filled.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; When Satan is cast out, he's going to go
[1:55:42] and he's going to try and get other
[1:55:44] Remember whenever the the the prophet of
[1:55:46] God would deal with certain bad
[1:55:47] sicknesses, there'd be different demons
[1:55:49] calling out to the other ones for help.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; You never found the Holy Ghost doing
[1:55:54] that, do you? He's all powerful.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; But the demons would be would be in
[1:55:58] streaks and and he would see them in
[1:56:00] that other dimension. So these demons
[1:56:01] when they get cast out of a life if you
[1:56:03] don't get filled
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; they can come back and be way worse the
[1:56:08] next time.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; So if you're justified and you're
[1:56:13] sanctified and now you're just asking
[1:56:15] for the Holy Ghost and you're trusting
[1:56:17] God for the Holy Ghost, keep asking,
[1:56:20] keep knocking, keep praying
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; because remember you fully obey the
[1:56:24] word.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; So now you're entitled to the token. It
[1:56:28] belongs to you. The token is not it.
[1:56:30] Brother Ram said the token is the fair
[1:56:32] has been paid.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Your future, in other words, your future
[1:56:36] is clear.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; Whenever the death angel looks at you,
[1:56:40] oh, he's covered by the blood. Can't
[1:56:42] touch him or her.
[1:56:44] That means you're guaranteed to be in
[1:56:46] the rapture. Your price has been paid.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; You'll be there just the same as Jesus
[1:56:51] Christ will be there.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet.
[1:56:58] We need his blood every day.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; We need him to justify us, to sanctify
[1:57:04] us every day. And we most certainly need
[1:57:06] refillings of the Holy Spirit.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Brother R would quote part of this song
[1:57:13] is a poem or it turned into a song. It's
[1:57:15] called Am I Soldier of the Cross?
[1:57:18] And I like to just read it here in
[1:57:19] closing.
[1:57:21] Am I a soldier of the cross? a follower
[1:57:25] of the lamb.
[1:57:27] And shall I fear to own his cause or
[1:57:29] blush to speak his name? In the name the
[1:57:32] precious name of him who died for me.
[1:57:34] Through grace I win the promised crown
[1:57:36] where whatever air my cross may be.
[1:57:40] Must I be carried to the skies on a
[1:57:42] flowery bed of ease while others fought
[1:57:45] to win the prize and sail through bloody
[1:57:47] seas?
[1:57:49] Are there no foes for me to face? Must I
[1:57:51] not stem the flood? Is this vile world a
[1:57:54] friend to grace to help me onto God?
[1:57:58] That is a wonderful question for young
[1:58:00] people, for all of us, but anyone that
[1:58:02] has worldly associates. It's okay to
[1:58:05] have worldly associates. You need them
[1:58:06] in business and in life.
[1:58:08] But I do I strongly advise against
[1:58:11] worldly friends.
[1:58:14] You know, when you read the book of
[1:58:15] Proverbs, one of the first things that
[1:58:17] Solomon gives, I don't have it here in
[1:58:19] my notes, but in the very first chapter,
[1:58:20] you go read it, and he immediately
[1:58:22] warns, "Be careful who you hang out
[1:58:24] with."
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; So, is this vile world a friend to grace
[1:58:32] to help me onto God?
[1:58:34] Since I must fight, if I would reign,
[1:58:37] increase my courage, Lord.
[1:58:40] I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,
[1:58:44] supported by thy word.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Friends, as we read in the scripture,
[1:58:52] we must be born again.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Ran would preach a powerful
[1:58:57] sermon called invisible union of the
[1:58:58] bride of Christ. And he took his text
[1:59:01] right there from Romans 7 when Paul, it
[1:59:03] looked like he was talking about
[1:59:04] marriage and divorce. And he said that
[1:59:06] if a woman gets remarried before that
[1:59:08] first husband's dead or she's an
[1:59:09] adulteress and things like that. And he
[1:59:11] takes that and he spiritualized that.
[1:59:13] And Paul does too. He said, "But I speak
[1:59:15] of the church.
[1:59:17] Our first husband, our first man has got
[1:59:20] to be dead."
[1:59:23] We cannot be married to the world and to
[1:59:25] the Lord Jesus at the same time.
[1:59:30] If a man love the world or the things of
[1:59:35] the world, the love of God is not in
[1:59:38] him.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; I pray in this atmosphere
[1:59:44] where eagles can be born. that as the
[1:59:47] word was going forth that if you haven't
[1:59:50] been born again
[1:59:52] that you can look down and as the word
[1:59:54] was going forth that you can examine
[1:59:55] yourself and as you look in the mirror
[1:59:58] of God's word you realize
[2:00:01] I wasn't born for this world
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; right
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; my beak it it's curved
[2:00:08] is meant for ripping flesh
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; and not pecking in the ground
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; these wings wings.
[2:00:16] They're not just made to fly from off
[2:00:18] the coupe onto the onto the ground in
[2:00:20] some barnyard. They're made to soar into
[2:00:21] the heavenlies.
[2:00:25] I look at my feet and they're talents.
[2:00:28] They're not some short chicken feet made
[2:00:30] to just scratch on the ground. They're
[2:00:32] made to grab a hold of fresh prey.
[2:00:36] This word is the end time carcass.
[2:00:41] And if you feel that this word has
[2:00:43] pricked your heart
[2:00:45] and you haven't been born again, but you
[2:00:48] really feel like you've got the desire
[2:00:49] to be born again and know him
[2:00:53] and you have that desire with all your
[2:00:55] heart, then that means you're an eagle.
[2:00:59] [Music]
[2:01:00] You have that desire to fly into the
[2:01:03] heavenlies. You're tired of this world.
[2:01:07] I urge you
[2:01:09] never stop until you get the Holy Ghost.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; We're here and we're here to pray for
[2:01:15] you and we'll we'll we'll we'll put our
[2:01:17] faith with your faith, but it's an
[2:01:20] individual
[2:01:22] affair between you and God.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; We'll pray with you, but we can't see
[2:01:27] your faith.
[2:01:29] We can't see your heart,
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; but God can.
[2:01:33] And when God can see your heart,
[2:01:36] as I said, you could be on a lawn mower
[2:01:39] and God will just give it to you.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; God bless you tonight. Let's pray.
[2:01:46] Dear gracious heavenly father,
[2:01:49] Lord, how we thank you for your word. We
[2:01:51] thank you for your truth,
[2:01:53] Lord. Thank you, Jesus, that you've made
[2:01:55] a way that we can be born again, Lord.
[2:01:57] that we can that we can that we have a
[2:01:59] way out of this first birth, this first
[2:02:02] sticky nature, Lord, that even maybe if
[2:02:05] if if we deal with situations in life
[2:02:07] that we have something in us by the way
[2:02:09] of the new birth that can put that man
[2:02:11] under subjection.
[2:02:13] Thank you, Lord, for that. Thank you for
[2:02:16] the blood of Jesus. Lord, I just pray
[2:02:18] Lord over this congregation that you
[2:02:20] sanctify us by your blood, Lord. And if
[2:02:22] there's one that doesn't know you in the
[2:02:24] power of the resurrection, maybe they're
[2:02:25] not even justified. May they just fall
[2:02:27] under conviction even now by the power
[2:02:30] of the Holy Ghost and realize that
[2:02:31] they're living a life of sin and may
[2:02:33] they repent and turn from their ways and
[2:02:36] you're just and faithful to forgive
[2:02:38] them. Maybe Lord, they're in a justified
[2:02:41] state and they're just so tired of going
[2:02:43] and being beat around the same things
[2:02:45] over and over and over again. They hate
[2:02:48] the different deals and the situations
[2:02:50] they're dealing with and maybe different
[2:02:51] addictions and they need to be
[2:02:53] sanctified.
[2:02:54] Lord, the power of God is here to
[2:02:56] sanctify.
[2:02:57] And Lord, if they need a new birth, the
[2:03:00] power of God is here to fill them.
[2:03:04] Lord, if they only present themselves in
[2:03:06] the right atmosphere, in the right
[2:03:07] attitude and come with a broken heart
[2:03:10] and ready to fully surrender, Lord, you
[2:03:12] promise you to receive them and send
[2:03:13] forth your word and your spirit. Thank
[2:03:16] you for each one. Now, we just pray that
[2:03:17] may this word just continue to be in our
[2:03:19] hearts, Lord. May the words that we
[2:03:21] heard, Lord, may it fall on good ground.
[2:03:23] May it bring forth true harvest for your
[2:03:26] kingdom. We love you now. We commit the
[2:03:28] remainder of this service. We commit our
[2:03:30] lives a new to you in the name of the
[2:03:33] Lord Jesus Christ. And Father, if
[2:03:34] there's anything in our lives, no matter
[2:03:36] how long we've been walking with you,
[2:03:38] no, no matter how many even refillings
[2:03:40] of the Holy Ghost we've had, Lord, give
[2:03:41] us another one.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Fill us again. Fill us like never
[2:03:45] before. And Lord, I just pray, oh God,
[2:03:47] that in the name of Jesus Christ that
[2:03:49] you look while there's still mercy that
[2:03:51] you look with your eyes of mercy into
[2:03:53] our very souls. Lord, from the front to
[2:03:56] the back, from side to side, look upon
[2:03:58] us with your eyes of mercy while there's
[2:04:00] still blood on the throne.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; Lord, if there's anything in our life
[2:04:04] that would hinder us from taking a
[2:04:06] rapture, that would that would hinder
[2:04:07] us, oh God, from going and being with
[2:04:09] you and escaping this terrible
[2:04:11] tribulation that's coming on the earth,
[2:04:12] forgive us, Lord. Lord, if there's
[2:04:14] anything in our life that we're doing or
[2:04:16] or going about and we don't even realize
[2:04:18] that's wrong, reveal it, convict it.
[2:04:21] Give us the grace, oh God, to repent.
[2:04:23] Lord, we love you and we thank you for
[2:04:25] sending us this message.
[2:04:27] Thank you for the blood in this glorious
[2:04:29] gospel. We surrender our life to you and
[2:04:32] give you all the praise, honor, and
[2:04:33] glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[2:04:37] Amen. Amen. God bless you, saints.
[2:04:46] [Music]
[2:04:49] Oh, I was lost
[2:04:53] and undone
[2:04:56] without God.
[2:04:59] for his son.
[2:05:03] When he reached
[2:05:06] down his hand
[2:05:10] for me, I was nearing despair.
[2:05:16] Oh, I was near
[2:05:20] green despair
[2:05:23] when he came
[2:05:26] to be there.
[2:05:30] And he showed me
[2:05:34] that I
[2:05:37] could be free.
[2:05:40] [Music]
[2:05:43] Oh, then he lifted.
[2:05:48] My feet
[2:05:50] gave me gold
[2:05:54] recmp complete
[2:05:57] when he reached
[2:05:59] [Music]
[2:06:01] down his hand
[2:06:04] for me. How my heart doth rejoice.
[2:06:10] Oh, how my heart
[2:06:14] it does rejoice
[2:06:17] since I made
[2:06:21] him my choice.
[2:06:24] From the temp
[2:06:28] to him.
[2:06:31] Now I flee.
[2:06:37] Oh, now I leave.
[2:06:41] on his own.
[2:06:44] Oh, life secure
[2:06:48] from my heart.
[2:06:51] Won't s reach
[2:06:55] down his hand
[2:06:59] for me. When he reached down his hand.
[2:07:05] openly reach
[2:07:09] out his hand
[2:07:12] for me.
[2:07:18] Oh, when he reach
[2:07:22] way down
[2:07:26] for me.
[2:07:32] Oh, I was lost
[2:07:36] and undone
[2:07:40] without God
[2:07:43] for his son
[2:07:46] when he reach
[2:07:50] down his head
[2:07:53] for me.

[2:08:13] let all the earth rejoice.
[2:08:16] All the earth rejoice.
[2:08:19] He wraps himself in light
[2:08:25] in darkness tries to hide and trembles
[2:08:30] at his voice.
[2:08:32] Trembles at his voice.

[2:13:16] God this evening. Aren't you so thankful
[2:13:18] for that blood? You must be born again.
[2:13:22] I know it was the blood.
[2:13:27] as we prepare to dismiss. Oh, I know it
[2:13:30] was a blood. Well, I know it was a
[2:13:34] blood. Well, I know it was a blood for
[2:13:38] me.
