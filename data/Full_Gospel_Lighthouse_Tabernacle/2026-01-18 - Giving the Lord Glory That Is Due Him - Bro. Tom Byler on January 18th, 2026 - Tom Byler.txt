I you mind if I share this publicly? They invited me to come and pray over their home and uh and then pray over their well situation. And so their neighbors had drilled up to 700 ft deep on a well. And you know that you can you can use your multiplication real quick. You can spend tens of thousands of dollars. And so it was dark and we were able to they had lights and we went through the house and prayed in each room and had a had a real wonderful time there. Then we walked out to the place that they had had chosen to dig the well and you know we anointed that ground with oil and prayed the prayer of faith and uh they dug the well &gt;&gt; and it's 205 ft deep. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, for those that you don't know it, they saved that prayer saved them about $30,000. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So, listen, that's that's a big deal. &gt;&gt; That's a really big deal. And so, we're just we're just so thankful. We're so thankful. We were reminiscing this morning of the miracles that have happened in this church. And and I I want to share some of those things next week. But when we begin to think about the miracles like this baby getting ready to be born, you know, don't never let the miracles of God slip by you and &gt;&gt; and Isaac being born to parents that couldn't have children and my own grandson. Then Zoe coming along and she couldn't talk and was told that we were told over and over that she wouldn't be able to talk until late in her 20s. And uh well, if you get around her, she's going to tell you some stuff. And so we're just so happy for that. And and uh Sister Autumn, that baby doll that you got sitting beside of you, God so richly blessed you at the very same time. And remember, I'll never forget they telling her she was next in line behind Whitney in the prayer line. And I said, "Sister Autumn, the same angel is visiting your house." And and they showed up at the doctor's office, what, four weeks later, and they were showed up at the same time.

And so I've been told over the last few months that I would have to go on dialysis. Well, the doctor called me again this week and the surgeon called me to to kind of talk to me for a little while and he was talking to me and and uh the numbers have got to go up a long way, but you know, I'll take a little bit at a time. It'll be okay. I'll take a little bit at a time. And so and so we're just thankful. And so as he began to talk to him, he talked me to me probably about 10 or 15 minutes and and uh and we got to the end and he said, "I want to tell you, God bless you." So I know that I've got a surgeon that's a real Christian. So I'm really thankful for that. And so amen.

I was back there and said, "You never even prayed last night before you opened up service." So, shall we bow our heads? Lord Jesus, we come before you, Lord, and we've been taught, Father, by your prophet, that we ought to come before the author before opening the author's book. And Lord, ask God that you would just come in a special way and open the book to us, Lord, for we know it is only your Holy Spirit to quicken these words to us and make it alive, Lord. &gt;&gt; And Father, this morning, we want to thank you, Lord Jesus, for your presence, Lord Jesus, in your people, God. Lord, we can never be thankful enough. We can never praise you enough, Father, for what you have done and what you're doing in our hearts and lives, and what you're doing upon the face of the earth in a group of people getting them ready to leave this world and to come home, Lord, and the whole plan of redemption coming to a close, Lord. Father, when the bride leaves, Lord Jesus, and the Holy Spirit lifts, Father, and you come to claim that which you have purchased, that which you have bought, that which you've paid for, Lord. come to make redemption claims, Lord. And we'll see Paul's group come up. We'll see Arinius and Columba Luther Wesley and Pentecost and the message of the hour. We see each one coming up as the prophet described, Lord, to go into the air to meet you in the air. And won't it be a time, Lord? Won't it be a time, Lord? Lord, and we just thank you, Lord Jesus, that we don't just have to wait to get over there, Lord. But we've got an earnest already. We've got a down payment, Lord. And Father, we got the earnest of the spirit, Lord Jesus. We're already, God, raised from the dead. We're not a dead people, but we're alive in Christ. Lord, we're sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. We thank you, Father. Now we ask God that you'd just be with us Lord Jesus as we try to do what you have ordained God for us to do Lord and that is that by the foolishness of preaching save those that believe Lord we've gathered according to your word not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together Lord but we've gathered as you have told us to Lord Jesus Father we welcome you now to come and to be the speaker help me to get out of the way Lord and that you'll father just use the gift to speak to your people. May the spirit speak what he wants to say to the church this morning. We ask it in Jesus' name. And everybody said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." Once again, brother, no fear. Amen. So, hey, that old devil's dead. Amen. Give the Lord a hand. Say, "Thank you, Lord Jesus." Amen. Amen. If you will open your Bibles, we'll just get into the word. Amen. Time flies so fast, so we'll just at least hurry and get started. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There was a saying I think brother Ted Pedley used to say something about he says that old Indian out west and the cowboy and and that Indian said you know that train that big old mogul Indian said never get him started. Never get him started. Never get him started. White guy says oh yeah oh yeah it's going to get going. It's going to get going. No never get him started. All of a sudden, that old whistle blew and that steam flew up and them old engines begin to go get going down the tracks and the engine says, "Never get him stopped. Never get him stopped. Never get him stopped." Amen. So, we'll try to get stopped. Amen. Amen. God bless you this morning and we love y'all. Amen. Love, Brother Ron. Love your group here. Amen. Greet the folks back home. Amen. We're so thankful for them. And we want to thank everybody. I didn't get to last night, but you know, I truly believe it was the faith of my wife and the faith of the believers. And I thank brother Ron and for uh uh Andrew and all of y'all for your prayers for my wife. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're continuing to pray for brother Ron. How many we always lift him up in our prayers. And we're Amen. We're going to chop some more heads off. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And we're going to drive the enemy plum out of the land. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you glad to be free? Amen. &gt;&gt; How many's free this morning? Amen. Thank God I am free. Free. Free. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. All right, let's get started. Turn your Bibles if you will to 1 Coronicles. Amen. 1 Coronicles, if you will. Amen. And we want to try to uh maybe go just a little bit of a different direction. Like I said, we just try to follow the leading of the spirit. When you've got five pages or so, you just ask the Lord to say what he wants said and zip the lip to what he don't want said. Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, know he knows just what you have need of. &gt;&gt; Even brother Bam says sometimes he'll go down this little rabbit trail or down to other places and he says and it'll be just for somebody. Amen. You don't know just why you do it, but God knows what he's doing. &gt;&gt; I I want to say I truly believe that this right here is what God has ordained. That's right. &gt;&gt; How many believes that it is ordained of God to have church? It's ordained of God to have a five-fold ministry. It's ordained of God to minister the word and for people like me and the ministers to get out of the way and let the spirit speak to the church what he once said. Amen. And if it's the Holy Spirit speaking, folks, how many knows? Amen. He'll go out there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He'll come out there and he'll drop down. He'll drop that word down. Amen. And if you have need of need of healing, if you have need of salvation this morning, &gt;&gt; oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He can make it real to you. That's right. &gt;&gt; You pray for revelation more than anything else. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not going to get to read the word if I don't quit. Amen. All right. Praise the Lord. That's okay. Now, 1 Coronicles 16 and verse 23 will begin with. Sing unto the Lord, all the earth. Show forth uh show forth from day to day his salvation. How many believes that? That's what we like to do. We like to talk about his salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Declare his glory among the heathen, his marvelous works among all nations. For great is the Lord and little to be praised. No. Greatly to be praised. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He also is to be feared above all gods. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many knows there's many gods? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Many gods, but one true God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So he says, "For all the gods of the people are idols, but the Lord make the heavens. Glory and honor are in his presence. Strength and gladness are in his place. It's no wonder we get happy." &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; No wonder we get glad. &gt;&gt; Amen. Give unto the Lord, ye kindreds of the people. Give unto the Lord glory and strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. And we want to get into some of that. Amen. Because you you think, well, the Lord needs strength. Amen. The Lord needs blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sure. Because he is the God of blessing. &gt;&gt; So we bless the Lord, all my soul, and all that is within me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, here we want to get to our title. Give unto the Lord glory due unto his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. So my title is giving the Lord glory that's due him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Bring an offering and come before him. Worship him in the beauty of holiness. God bless you. You can have your seats this this morning. It is still morning I guess. Amen. Praise the Lord. I love that song, that last song. Amen. that brother Andrew sang because uh I want to just read that scripture and I heard as it were Revelations 19 and6 and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying hallelujah the for the Lord God omnipotent reignth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. I want to read a couple more scriptures just trying to final lay a foundation. Amen. I'm not really here to teach. Amen. I want to just try to with the help of the Lord just to preach. Amen. Amen. Just to preach and see what the Lord will have for us, but certainly preach his word. In Revelations the fourth chapter, if you want to go there, you can. Amen. Verse 7 it says, "And the first beast was like unto a lion. The second beast like unto a calf, the third beast like unto the face of a man, and the fourth beast like a flying eagle." &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, for those of you who understand what that was, that was the four powers of God that God Amen. led out, Amen. through the last 2,000 years. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. It was uh all these different powers and and and that he uh anointed his church with, his people with. And the last one, of course, was the flying eagle, which we love. Amen. &gt;&gt; The flying eagle. Amen. That's the eagle age. How many believe it's the eagle age? And the four beasts had each of them six wings about them, and they were full of eyes within. And they rest not day and night, saying, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was and which is and which is to come." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks, &gt;&gt; how many believe that? And that's what I really want to focus on. Amen. Is giving God his due. Amen. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GIVE God the glory that's due him. &gt;&gt; GIVE HIM THE PRAISE. That's due him. &gt;&gt; How many believe that he IS WORTHY &gt;&gt; OF A LOT OF PRAISE? &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; He's worthy of a lot of glory. &gt;&gt; MAN GLORIFIES SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Let me read the rest of my scriptures before we get started. But if you notice those beasts, those powers, they give honor. &gt;&gt; How many knows? That's why we come to church. We honor God. &gt;&gt; We honor God by coming to his house. And Amen. And the things that we do and the way that we dress and the way that we talk and the way we live. We want to live to honor. Let my life honor God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who liveth forever and ever. And the four uh bel I read that already. No. Verse 10 says, "And the four and 20 elders fall down before him that sat upon the throne and worship him that liveth forever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, Thou art worthy." &gt;&gt; Thou art worthy, O Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. To receive glory and honor and power, for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they were and are created. Now notice after the fifth chapter after he takes the book he was found worthy to take the book and to open the book what happens after the opening of the seals as we might say. Amen. They begin to sing a new song and and it verse says in chapter 5 11 and I beheld and another and I heard of the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beast and the elders and the number of them was 10,000 times 10 thousands and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you think it's time to just get a little louder? &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. GET A LITTLE LOUDER. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam taught us that IF YOU WAS TO DIE in your seat right now, &gt;&gt; Amen. IT WOULDN'T CHANGE YOUR CHARACTER one bit. &gt;&gt; IT WOULDN'T CHANGE HOW YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And brother Ben, IN ONE PLACE HE SAYS, YOU KNOW, IF GOD WAS TO CAST ME OFF IN the end, Amen. Because he he he says it many times. HE SAYS, I'D CERTAINLY BE WORTHY of him casting me off. How many feels that way? SURE, WE'RE NOT PERFECT. WE'VE MADE OUR MISTAKES AND AND SO FORTH, AND I'M BE WORTHY TO CAST ME INTO HELL. BUT HE SAYS, HE SAYS, "IF I WOULD FEEL, BUT IF I WOULD FEEL LIKE I FEEL NOW, I would love him in hell." &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. That's what he say. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVES THAT'S THE WAY IT OUGHT TO BE ON THE INSIDE of the inside? YOU'RE LIKELY NOT TO GET CAST OUT IF YOU'VE GOT THAT KIND OF LOVE for God. AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT, BROTHER AND SISTERS? I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, IF THAT'S THE SAME APPLIES, AMEN. FOR MY HEART AND FOR YOUR HEART. AMEN. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU IF I FEEL LIKE I FEEL RIGHT NOW IF I DROP DEAD. AMEN. HE CAST ME OFF. I'M GOING TO BE SAYING, "PRAISE THE LORD." &gt;&gt; NOW, EVERYBODY ELSE IN HELL IS GOING TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE CUZ I'M GOING TO BE PRAISING GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Which better did say, "If there was such a thing as love in hell, you know." Amen. If there's SUCH A THING AS PRAISING GOD IN HELL. And if I feel LIKE I DO NOW, I would give him glory. &gt;&gt; I WOULD GIVE HIM PRAISE. WE WOULD HAVE A HALLELUJAH CORNER IN HELL. &gt;&gt; You ain't never heard that before, have you? I ain't never said that before. Oh my. But I was just off of brother Brandon how he felt. If he felt that way. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so how many believe that's the way we need to feel? We need to have THE LOVE OF GOD IN OUR HEARTS. WE LOVE HIM MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. HE IS MORE DEAR TO US THAN OUR VERY BREATH. HE'S MORE SWEETER TO US THAN OUR VERY LIFE. HE'S MORE THAN LIFE TO ME. HE'S EVERYTHING. HE'S EVERYTHING. HE'S MY FATHER. HE'S MY MOTHER. HE'S MY BROTHER. HE'S EVERYTHING. AND HE IS WORTHY of my praise. &gt;&gt; What are we going to do, brother Angel? What are we going TO DO WHEN IT'S ALL OVER WITH? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS RIGHT HERE. THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOUD VOICE SAYING, "GLORY AND HONOR AND POWER AND STRENGTH BE TO THE LAMB CUZ HE'S THE ONE THAT'S WORTHY." THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO PRAISE HIM THROUGH THE EONS OF TIME. IT AIN'T GOING TO BE LIKE THE DEVIL AND GET BORED. I'M NOT GOING TO GET BORED IN HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; I'm not GOING TO GET TIRED OF GOING TO CHURCH. COME ON. &gt;&gt; CHURCH AIN'T GOING TO BE BORING FOR ME. HEAVEN AIN'T GOING TO BE BORING FOR ME. &gt;&gt; COME ON, BUDDY. &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO PRAISE GOD AND KEEP PRAISING GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I've started 20. Oh, I don't know.

YOU JUST DON'T COME TO GOD ON YOUR OWN. &gt;&gt; YOU JUST DON'T HAVE A DESIRE TO GET BAPTIZED ON YOUR OWN. AMEN. AMEN. NO MAN COMES TO ME EXCEPT MY FATHER. DRAW HIM. &gt;&gt; I HOPE YOU FEEL THAT DRAWING. I HAVEN'T DRAWN. HE'S DRAWING ME. &gt;&gt; HE'S CALLING ME. &gt;&gt; HE DRAW ME. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he draw you? &gt;&gt; Any napkins or anything? Amen. Give you a revelation of himself. Is that right? I looked at this scripture. Oh, and it just blessed my soul to think the one thing they say is worthy is the lamb &gt;&gt; that was slain. Amen. To receive power. Oh my. How many knows that we were WITHOUT STRENGTH? &gt;&gt; STRENGTH. &gt;&gt; WITHOUT POWER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; In sin, dead. But what DID GOD DO? HE COME AND HE TALKED TO US. HE SPOKE TO OUR HEARTS. HE LIFTED US UP. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT DID HE DO? HE BAPTIZED US WITH THE HOLY GHOST. HE SAID, "YOU SHALL RECEIVE POWER AFTER THE HOLY GHOST HAS COME UPON YOU." &gt;&gt; AMEN. TO BECOME SONS OF GOD. HOW MANY BELIEVE IT TAKES THE POWER OF GOD TO TRANSFORM YOUR NATURE AND YOUR DESIRES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. He does. &gt;&gt; And he does that. &gt;&gt; All right. Let's stop, rewind a little bit. I like to go back. Amen. And think about what God has done. Amen. Now, how many knows that? When God gives something, Amen. such as salvation or a pardon, is that right? People are responsible. &gt;&gt; Young people. &gt;&gt; You just didn't come here by accident. &gt;&gt; You didn't just happen to be here. There could have been another million that was born, but you were born. God chose you to be here. &gt;&gt; How many believes that? &gt;&gt; God chose me to be here. &gt;&gt; But we as human beings, being a human comes with responsibility. That's right. &gt;&gt; It comes with accountability. &gt;&gt; And every sin from Cain, isn't that right? &gt;&gt; Adam and Eve, every sin from the first sin to the very last sin must be paid for. &gt;&gt; IT MUST BE ACCOUNTED FOR. &gt;&gt; GOD KEEPS RECORD. THAT'S &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; GOD PUSHED THAT RECORD PLAYER WHEN YOU WERE BORN. AIN'T THAT RIGHT? AND EVERY THOUGHT THAT GOES THROUGH YOUR MIND, EVERYTHING YOU EVER DO, WHATEVER CLOTHES YOU OWE, IT'S ALL RECORDED. &gt;&gt; And someday on that day, it'll be played back. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you COME TO THE AGE OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND BEGIN TO AMEN, STEAL A LITTLE THIS OR STEAL A LITTLE THAT OR TELL A MOM, "NO, I DIDN'T DO IT. JUNIOR did it." Or some AND EVERY LITTLE THING and then it BEGINS TO ADD UP and guilt and AND SIN BRINGS GUILT UPON YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND IT CAUSES YOUR CONSCIENCE TO CONDEMN YOURSELF. PEOPLE BECOME MISERABLE THAT WAY. I MEAN KNOW IT'S MISERABLE TO HAVE SIN IN YOUR LIFE. IT'S MISERABLE TO BACKSLIDE ON GOD. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; AIN'T THAT RIGHT? I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I'VE DONE IT A TIME OR TWO. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I ain't got no wings. &gt;&gt; Hello. I'VE DONE A TIME. YOU HAVE A TIME OR TWO. AND I THANK GOD FOR HIS MERCY AND HIS GRACE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT YOU BECOME MISERABLE WHEN YOU BECOME BACKSLID. AMEN. YOU JUST GET A LITTLE LUKEWARM AND SEE HOW MISERABLE YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; There's no SENSE IN BEING MISERABLE. THERE'S NO SENSE IN BACKSLIDING. THAT'S WHY I TRIED TO CONVEY THAT ABOUT THE HOLIES OF HOLIES. AMEN. I BELIEVE THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO GET INTO IT. THAT INNER CHAMBER, THAT WALK WITH GOD RIGHT IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD THAT you can live with him. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN WORSHIP HIM YESTERDAY LIKE WE DID LAST NIGHT. BUT THAT WAS YESTERDAY. WE CAN WORSHIP AGAIN TODAY. WE CAN PRAISE HIM AGAIN TODAY. AND IF A TOMORROW COMES, WE'LL WORSHIP IT. WE'LL PRAISE HIM AGAIN TOMORROW. &gt;&gt; OH, PEOPLE THINK WE WORSHIP A BUNCH AND BECOME A LITTLE FANATICAL IN 25. WAIT TILL 26. BUT you're ready. WE'RE GOING TO SHOW HIM. HEY, I DON'T KNOW. HOW ABOUT YOU? BUT I CAME TO PRAISE THE LORD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CAME TO DO, BUT I CAME TO WORSHIP. I'M GLAD THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING, IT ISN'T JUST SOMETHING IMAGINARY. YOU'RE WORSHIPING GOD. THIS MORNING, WE'RE RAISING OUR HANDS TO GOD AND SAYING, "THANK YOU, LORD. IT'S REAL, PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; Salvation is real." &gt;&gt; Why am I so excited? Why am I so happy? I'll tell you why. Cuz how many knows this whole world, everything that's happened has been the plan of God? &gt;&gt; It's been his plan, &gt;&gt; right? And we serve a very, very merciful God. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? We know we have to give account. &gt;&gt; You got to give an account. &gt;&gt; Everybody got to give an account for what you've done. &gt;&gt; Revelations there. The white throne judgment, the dead, the sea, hell, death, the grave, everything called everybody up. And the books were opened, and every man was judged according to his deeds. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus knew this. God knew this. &gt;&gt; But what did he do? &gt;&gt; Isn't he sweet? &gt;&gt; That he made a way out of it. &gt;&gt; He made a way out. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he set up church. &gt;&gt; HE SET UP THE HOUSE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; He set up the house of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus when he came, he meant he conquered every devil. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HE CONQUERED EVERY TEMPTATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. He went Amen. AND CONQUERED HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; WENT TO CALVARY. AMEN. AND DIED THE MOST HORRIBLE DEATH THAT COULD BE could be uh dealt to him. Ain't that right? in &gt;&gt; the most horrible way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Went to the REGIONS OF THE LOST, GRABBED THE KEYS OUT OF THE DEVIL'S SIDE, SO TO SPEAK, JUST HAVING CONQUERED IT ALL. KICK THE GATES DOWN, GRAB THE KEYS, COME BACK UP, ASCENDED ON HIGH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. He says he ascended on high AND LET CAPTIVITY CAPTIVE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HOW MANY BELIEVES IN THIS MORNING YOUR CAPTIVITY, &gt;&gt; YOUR SORROW, YOUR FEAR, YOUR ANXIETY, ALL OF THOSE. AMEN. DON'T LET THEM BRING YOU CAPTIVE. YOU BRING IT CAPTIVE. &gt;&gt; GET IT UNDER YOUR FEET. &gt;&gt; GET DEPRESSION UNDER YOUR FEET. &gt;&gt; HE LET CAPTIVITY CAPTIVE AND HE GAVE GIFTS TO MAN. WHAT WERE THOSE GIFTS? APOSTLES, PROPHETS, PASTORS, TEACHERS. FOR WHAT? FOR THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS UNTIL WE ALL COME TO THE FULL STATURE OF CHRIST. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR. AMEN. IS TO CONVEY TO YOU THE GRACE OF ALMIGHTY GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. TO TELL YOU THE GRACE, THE PLAN OF SALVATION. &gt;&gt; The plan of salvation. Amen. &gt;&gt; That by the foolishness of preaching &gt;&gt; to save them that are lost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I love the thought that hey, even this morning as the go word goes forth, somebody can get saved. &gt;&gt; That's right. become an eternal creature that'll live through the ceaseless ages to come. Now, I don't know about you, but I would rather be right here than at a racetrack. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Or at a ball game. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Or anything anywhere else in the world. I'd rather be right here &gt;&gt; cuz greater things can happen right here &gt;&gt; than anywhere else. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just by the pure word of God going forth. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; He was so merciful. Amen. When he knew that there would be certain ones that would accept it. How many knows that he didn't die for haphazard read? He knew who would accept and who would and HE DIDN'T GO HE DIDN'T GO TO CALVARY ON JUST SOME WELL I HOPE SOMEBODY HAS PITY ON ME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. But he knew somebody would want it. &gt;&gt; WHOSOEVER WILL. AMEN. HE SAYS I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO WHILE I'M SIGNING THIS PARDON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'm glad this house of God HERE A MINUTE AGO I WAS TALKING ABOUT GOD CREATED THE HOUSE OF GOD. AMEN. AND PETER SAID JUDGMENT. JUDGMENT FOR OUR SINS. WE'VE COME TO JUDGMENT THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. When the PREACHER CONDEMNS YOU FOR THIS OR this condemns YOU FOR THAT, THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE HERE FOR. IF THE WORD CONDEMNS, SAY, "GOD, FORGIVE ME." CUZ I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT IN THIS HOUSE OF JUDGMENT, THERE'S MERCY. &gt;&gt; THERE'S GRACE IN THIS HOUSE OF JUDGMENT. AMEN. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, YOU CAN TAKE THOSE SINS OF YOUR PAST. AMEN. BECAUSE GET IT TO WHERE THERE'S NOW NO CONDEMNATION. THERE'S NO JUDGMENT THAT UNDER THEM THAT ARE IN Christ Jesus, WHO WALK NOT AFTER THE FLESH, but after the spirit. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that this morning? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Judgment must begin at the house of God. &gt;&gt; You got to deal with your sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why do you think people want to take their lives Why? Because a life outside of Christ is miserable. &gt;&gt; A life with a guilty conscience is miserable. &gt;&gt; You know, I had in my notes here, I says, you know, we need to have compassion for those folks out there that have blue hair &gt;&gt; with all those rings in them. &gt;&gt; All these, you know, hideous looking people, men walking around with fingernail polish on &gt;&gt; and all these things that they walk around. Amen. You know, brother Bam talked about when he was in in his day, he says, "Why does women run around on their husbands? Why do people go out to these clubs and why do they all go out there and do all of that?" HE SAYS, "BECAUSE GOD PUT A THIRST IN THEM. &gt;&gt; He put a thirst in them for satisfaction. &gt;&gt; They don't realize that that thirst can ONLY BE QUENCHED BY THE HOLY GHOST." &gt;&gt; AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, IN OUR GENERATION, those kids out there, THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN DARKNESS, AMEN, THEY'RE THIRSTING FOR SOMETHING. THAT'S WHY THEY COLOR THEIR HAIR. THAT'S WHY THEY PUT TATTOOS ON THEM. THEY'RE THIRSTING FOR SOMETHING. BUT PRAISE BE TO GOD, THERE'S A PLACE THAT THEY CAN COME AND GET SATISFIED. HALLELUJAH. HOW MANY THIS MORNING SAY, "I'M SATISFIED. I COME TO CHRIST AND I'M SATISFIED. I DRINK FROM THE WELL SPRINGS OF WELLS." AMEN. I'LL GIVE YOU WATER THAT YOU'LL NEVER THIRST AGAIN. AMEN. ANOTHER TATTOO WILL NEVER QUENCH YOUR THIRST. ANOTHER BLUE HAIR WON'T QUENCH YOUR THIRST. BUT GETTING ON YOUR KNEES. WOULD YOU SAY, "GOD, I WANT TO DRINK FROM YOUR FOUNTAIN. GOD, COME AND FILL THAT VOID THAT'S IN MY HEART. &gt;&gt; LET ME GET BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. FILL ME WITH THE HOLY GHOST. I'LL NEVER HAVE TO DO DRUGS AGAIN.

SPIKE THAT BOMB. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YEAH, that's what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; God is worthy more glory &gt;&gt; than a football, &gt;&gt; a pitchkin. &gt;&gt; They have that much fun. &gt;&gt; Amen. because of the strength that God gave them. &gt;&gt; And God, Isn't it nice sometimes when you hear a football player or one of them players say, "I just want to give God thanks." &gt;&gt; Isn't it nice when somebody just gives God a little bit of glory &gt;&gt; cuz he's given them strength. &gt;&gt; He's given them the ability to do that. Amen. Because every one of us knows, I don't know about you, but aren't you glad you are not running having to go SIT IN A WHEELCHAIR GETTING AROUND the morning. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. SO YOU SAY, "THANK YOU, LORD, THAT I CAN WALK. THANK YOU, LORD, FOR EVERY MOVEMENT I CAN MAKE. THANK YOU, LORD, FOR EVERY BREATH THAT I HAVE. I THANK HIM FOR EVERYTHING. HE IS MY BREATH. HE'S MY SUNSHINE. HE'S MY ALL IN ALL. &gt;&gt; He's everything. He's everything to me. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise be to God. I don't know about you, but I just wish that the world would realize the opportunity &gt;&gt; that's before him. &gt;&gt; The opportunity if they could just hear me as I say this that when God begin to think about pardoning his children, he didn't just pardon you. He says, "I'm going to go a little fanatical here and I'm just going to put it in here. Whosoever will." &gt;&gt; WHOSOEVER WILL COME. &gt;&gt; HE INVITES EVERYBODY COME. THE SPIRIT OF MERCY, COME DRINK FROM THE WATERS. MY REAL HARM IS REACHED OUT. &gt;&gt; BOY, I'll tell you what, WE'D BE IN A millennium already. Hello. WHAT A PLACE IT WOULD BE &gt;&gt; if even as brother Bam said, they embraced the gift that Solomon had of discernment &gt;&gt; and THAT THEY EMBRACED THAT AND THEY HAD A GOLDEN AGE. &gt;&gt; A GOLDEN AGE. I've often said, man, I'm here to tell you right now, Brother Brandham should have been the president of the United States. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? He should have been the president. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He'd have said, "No, Mr. garbage off. I know you what you're doing back there behind all those hills. I know the test that you're about to do. Ain't that right? Oh yeah. There wouldn't have been no secret. Amen. When they come and they try to beat us in North Korea or somewhere else, we'd be there already WAITING FOR HOW DID THEY KNOW WE WERE GOING TO come there? &gt;&gt; Amen. THEY HAD TO SAY, "WELL, THEY'VE GOT A PROPHET IN THE LAND. THEY'VE GOT SOMEBODY THAT KNOWS WHAT YOU DO IN YOUR BED CHAMBER." HALLELUJAH. AMEN. But I want to say this. We are not like those who do not give God the glory. &gt;&gt; How many knows Jesus is the most rejected one? &gt;&gt; He's a rejected one. &gt;&gt; Let me just hit a couple points here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. I wore my voice out, but he re regrouped me. Amen. I think I'll be able to make it through today. So, praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Jesus said one place he said, "Wherefore," he says, "shall I liken this generation. It is like unto the children sitting in the marketplace and calling unto their fellows, saying, we have PIPED UNTO YOU, BUT YOU HAVE NOT DANCED." &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT? GOD HAS PLAYED US SOME WONDERFUL MUSIC. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE HAS GIVEN US SOME WONDERFUL MUSIC. AMEN. THE SOUND OF THE COBBLESTONE STREET WHERE HE DRUG HIS LEFT CROSS LEFT AN OLD DRUG CROSS LEFT HIS KILL LEFT THE BLOODY STAIN. HALLELUJAH. IT WAS SWEET MUSIC TO ME. I DON'T KNOW THE WORLD MAY NOT WANT TO DANCE TO THAT BUT I'LL DANCE TO THAT MUSIC. I'LL DANCE TO THE MUSIC THAT GOD MADE. I'LL I'LL DO IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonas. And behold, a greater than Jonas is here. &gt;&gt; OH, THIS OLD AMISH BOY RIGHT HERE. HIS EX AMISH BOY, SHOULD I SAY? &gt;&gt; AMEN. When I THINK OF THE GRACE OF ALMIGHTY GOD. &gt;&gt; HELLO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN I THINK OF WHAT GOD HAS DONE IN OUR GENERATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And brother Brand come along. AMEN. HE SAYS, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW WHO I'M waiting on. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was our brother. Aren't you glad he didn't make himself some great one? Amen. &gt;&gt; Even when that lady from the south said, "Well, Reverend uh Dr. Reverend Brandham," he's in, "No, just call me brother if you love me and get your hand down here where I can shake it." He was just a brother, but he was waiting on someone to come. And he'd begin to zet would say, "Now, if this same Jesus would come again, Amen, that was here in Galilee, he would do the same things." And he said that he would. These works that I do shall you do also, and greater than these shall he do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Bam says, "Oh, in this great hour OF DARKNESS AND CHAOS OVER THE EARTH, we should be the happiest people in the whole earth." &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHY? TO REJOICE to know WHEN PEOPLE ARE INDOCTRINATED IN ALL KINDS OF FALSE DOCTRINES. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY KNOWS ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF THIS BIBLE IS FALSE DOCTRINE? ANY MAN-MADE CREED IS DOG DOG DOGMA. IT'S NOT ACCORDING TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; IT'S FALSE DOCTRINE. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOT TO BE ACCORDING to the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. All kinds of indocumentation. He says, you know, THE HINDU AND WE'RE ONLY we're the only ones that CAN SAY OUR OUR SAVIOR, OUR PROPHET HAS RISEN FROM THE DEAD AND IS ALIVE FOREVER MORE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And he has come and HE HAS PROVEN HIMSELF ALIVE. REJOICE TO KNOW. WHY ARE WE HAPPY? BECAUSE WE ARE NOT YOU WERE NOT indoccumented in autoism. And yet t today the real living God BY HIS WORD AND BY HIS VISIBLE EVIDENCE SHOWS US THAT HE'S HERE WITH us &gt;&gt; working moving LIVING ACTING JUST EXACTLY THE WAY that he always did. &gt;&gt; WHAT A PRIVILEGED PEOPLE WE ARE TO HAVE THIS. HOW MANY IS GLAD THAT GOD CAME IN THE WAY THAT HE DID AND SHOWING SIGNS AND WONDERS? Oh and still doing. HOW MANY KNOW HE'S STILL DOING MIRACLES, HE'S STILL DOING MIRACLES, he's still showing his signs and his wonders. &gt;&gt; AMEN. JUST THE FACT THAT YOU'VE GOT PRAISE LIKE YOU DO. JUST THE FACT THAT YOU'VE GOT FREEDOM LIKE YOU DO, IT'S A MIRACLE. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE YOU LOVING THE LORD IN THIS HOUR, IT'S A MIRACLE. &gt;&gt; YOU SERVING GOD IN THIS HOUR, IT'S A MIRACLE. IT'S GOD WORKING IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. You know how the Catholics, they'll read off a bunch of words in Latin or whatever, make a humming like sound or whatever. Where I come from, they're kind of like that same way. And they would say the same things over and over and over again. I was 14 years old when I left the Amish. 14 years old. And I can still remember how they preached. I don't know if y'all will relate to some of this, but they say as preaching. Amen. They'll read out of a German Bible. Amen. Let me tell you something. Brother Bam said, "Those people, they live holy." &gt;&gt; Amen. But just like everybody else, it's not a reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many's glad that we have reality? We've got the LIVING WORD LIVING AMONG US. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS NOT TO USE VAIN REPUTITION. AMEN. WHEN YOU PRAY, DON'T USE VAIN REPETITION. LET YOUR PRAYERS COME FROM YOUR HEART &gt;&gt; AND LET YOUR AMENS COME FROM YOUR HEART. LET YOUR HALLELUJAH COME FROM YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; But listen, he says that men of Nineveh will rise up. THE QUEEN OF THIS HOUSE SHALL RISE UP IN JUDGMENT IN this generation and con CONDEMN IT BECAUSE SHE CAME FROM THE UTTERMOST PARTS OF THE world &gt;&gt; to hear the wisdom of Solomon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in this hour, America, &gt;&gt; Americans, &gt;&gt; you can tell them of what God did in this generation through a prophet of God. how he said wait here and Jesus would come and do the same Messiah sign &gt;&gt; that woman at the well when she saw that sign she said she ran into the city ISN'T THIS THE MESSIAH HE'S TOLD ME EVERYTHING I EVER DONE &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT &gt;&gt; YOU CAN TELL PEOPLE THAT and say well I went to that message church and I just don't have I just don't want it &gt;&gt; you might not want it but you'll deal with the fact that you heard that Jesus Christ came in this hour and did the very same things and you rejected it &gt;&gt; hello and you rejected did it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have been fine before, but once you hear the truth, you don't walk away the same after that anymore. &gt;&gt; Once you reject the truth, Amen. But how many's glad? Praise the Lord. Let me tell you another story. Amen. Jesus signed my pardon. This I surely know. &gt;&gt; Amen. He took my place ON CALVARY. NOW I DON'T HAVE TO GO. &gt;&gt; All my life I give him. He gave his for me since Jesus signed my pardon. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many's glad that he signed your pardon? &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember the story of that American in the in the the Civil War. Amen. That young boy that was put in prison for forsaking his post &gt;&gt; and his buddy went and he went to Abraham Lincoln and got a signed paper. &gt;&gt; He got a signed paper said set him free. Came to that other buddy of his says, "I got a signed paper from Abraham." Amen. YOU CAN GO FREE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DON'T NOW? YOU COME IN HERE AND MOCK ME. BUT HE didn't know his friend real well, did he? COME HERE TO MOCK ME BECAUSE I'M GOING TO DIE TOMORROW IN FRONT OF THE FIRING SQUAD. GET OUT OF HERE. NO, I'M TELLING YOU. I'M TELLING YOU. IT'S A PARDON. THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY TO THE WORLD THIS MORNING. I'M TELLING YOU. I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S A PARDON. &gt;&gt; TAKE THE PARDON. TAKE THE PARDON. ACCEPT THE PARDON. OR YOU WILL HAVE TO GIVE AN ANSWER ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT FOR everything &gt;&gt; that you ever done. &gt;&gt; You'll have to accept judgment because you rejected mercy. &gt;&gt; Isn't it something that even though doesn't matter what kind of sinful things that you have done, God paid for it. Christ paid for it on Calvary &gt;&gt; and he signed your part and all you have to do is believe. Is that so hard, world? Is that so hard, people of THE EARTH? &gt;&gt; GOD SAID, "IF YOU WILL BELIEVE, GO YOU INTO ALL THE WORLD AND PREACH THE GOSPEL. HE THAT BELIEVETH AND IS BAPTIZED SHALL BE SAVED." &gt;&gt; You'll have to pay for all those sins. But for the one sin you'll go to hell for, just that one sin will send you to hell. He that believeth not &gt;&gt; shall be damned. Simple gospel, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Simple gospel. &gt;&gt; Receive what he has done. Accept it. You know, I thought about that story. Here's your pardon. Here's your pardon. &gt;&gt; Take it with you. He said, "Take it with you." Amen. &gt;&gt; Come here. Hold that. Let's say there's bars right here. I'm in prison. You come and you try to hand me that. So what are you talking about? That's a pardon from Abraham Lincoln. &gt;&gt; Abraham Lincoln. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's yours. Take it. &gt;&gt; Take it. I don't know. I Give me that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Give me that. You know what I'd do next? All right. I'd go over here. Hey, Mr. Taylor. &gt;&gt; Hey, Mr. D. Hey, Mr. Devil. Where are you? &gt;&gt; I GOT A PAPER FOR YOU. GET YOURSELF OVER HERE. &gt;&gt; I speak with authority. I got Abraham Lincoln's name out of here. How many bleach the name of Jesus Christ? Every devil tremble. They tremble at the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Jesus signed my pardon. This I surely know. He signed my pardon. Hallelujah. COME ON OVER HERE, MR. JAYLOR MAN, AND YOU OPEN THAT GATE. LET ME OUT NOW. THAT'S WHAT WE GOT TO DO. IF YOU'RE NOT FREE, YOU TELL THE DEVIL, YOU KNOW, MY SIDE HARD PARDON HAS BEEN SIGNED. YOU LET ME GO RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; EVERYONE OUT THERE, WHATEVER YOU HAVE NEED OF, SAY, GOD, IT'S MINE. DEVIL, LET IT GO. &gt;&gt; GIVE IT BACK TO ME. GIVE ME BACK MY FREEDOM. GIVE ME BACK MY JOY. GIVE ME BACK MY DEAD. GIVE IT BACK NOW. right now. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I COME OUT OF THAT JAIL DANCING. They ain't going to PUT A BUNCH OF BULLETS ALL IN ME. NO WAY. NO WAY AM I GOING TO HAVE A BUNCH OF BULLETS IN ME. Come on, BROTHER. JESUS FORGAVE ALL OF YOU. YOU CAN BE FORGIVEN OF EVERY SIN RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; RAISE YOUR HAND. SAY, "GOD, FORGIVE ME." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You're forgiven. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're forgiven. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He's more willing to forgive us &gt;&gt; than we are willing to accept it. &gt;&gt; More willing to forgive us than we are to accept it. That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. The devil held you. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; The devil held you. You was in his pawn shop. He had you in the back of his little old place back there. &gt;&gt; You couldn't go. You couldn't go. Jesus couldn't come and give you that paper. He couldn't come to give that pawn shop man that receipt cuz he hadn't paid for it yet. Ain't that right? Couldn't do it. No matter how much you would slay a lamb, offer the blood, that you would be covered for that year, you'd go out with the same desire again. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? You'd still go out with the same desire. This is a real lesson for us. Amen. But I'm here to tell you after Calvary, &gt;&gt; after Calvary, he came into that pawn shop and he gave that pawn shop owner SAID, "YEAH, I HAVE BOUGHT THEM. I have paid for them. LET THEM GO." &gt;&gt; LET THEM OUT. THEY'RE FREE NOW. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; NOW, I'm here to tell you, he gives you that paper. He forgives you. Not only does he forgive you, Amen. And this here is the kind of forgiveness that takes THE VERY DESIRE FOR SIN. &gt;&gt; OH, but I still struggle. I still have my ups and downs. I FIND MYSELF GOING BACK OUT INTO SIN. I FIND MYSELF SINNING AGAIN. BROTHER, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. YOU JUST HAVEN'T went deep enough. &gt;&gt; Come on. Are you with me? HOW MANY BELIEVE YOU NEED TO go deep enough to WHERE YOU HAVE POWER OVER YOUR BODY? POWER OVER DESIRES OF SIN. IF YOU DON'T, THEN THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST HAS NOT BEEN APPLIED LIKE IT SHOULD BE IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; SURE, God will forgive you. AMEN. BUT IF YOU HAPPEN to say SOMETHING WRONG, DO SOMETHING WRONG. SURE, HE'LL FORGIVE YOU. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW, HE ALSO GIVES YOU THE POWER, &gt;&gt; THE POWER TO OVERCOME IT. &gt;&gt; CUZ YOU'VE EITHER OVERCOME IT OR YOU HAVEN'T. AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, I'm here to tell you, I'm so glad that I'm like that little mouse. Amen. In the Egypt, the grains of Egypt. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; I'm here to TELL YOU, WE JUST DON'T REALIZE WHAT WE HAVE. &gt;&gt; AND I WANT TO REALIZE WHAT I HAVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, &gt;&gt; BOY, WE GET SO EXCITED ABOUT JUST A FEW THINGS, BUT LET ME SAY SOMETHING. THE WHOLE GARDENER IS FULL OF GRAIN. YOU AIN'T GOT TO SAY, "WELL, now God, I hate to ask you this. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; COME ON." &gt;&gt; You know, but maybe you could help me with my temper. &gt;&gt; Or maybe you could help me with a little this, that, or the other. I want you to know you can say, "God, give me all of it. God, HELP ME TO OVERCOME SIN AND DESIRES OF SIN. LET ME HAVE A BUNCH OF IT." YOU DON'T HAVE TO EAT SPARINGLY. DON'T EAT OF THIS food sparingly. Don't put it that don't take it from THEM GRAIN BINS, PACK IT IN YOUR MOUTH AND GO OVER THERE, MAKE A LITTLE HOLE AND DECIDE, I better pack up. I better sack SOME FOR LATER. NO, THERE'S PLENTY. &gt;&gt; ASK ABUNDANTLY THAT YOUR joy &gt;&gt; people might be able to tell. &gt;&gt; ASK SO MUCH UNTIL people can tell that you're happy. &gt;&gt; Ask me. Ask me. You ask me why I'm happy. So, I'll just tell you why. BECAUSE MY SINS ARE GONE. THEY'RE UNDERNEATH THE BLOOD. AND THE SEA OF GOD'S FORGETFULNESS. THAT'S WHY I REMOVED THIS DARKNESS FROM GOD. THAT'S WHY WE'RE HAPPY. THAT'S WHY I HAVE JOY. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN WALK THAT WAY EVERY DAY. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE YOU CAN WALK THAT WAY EVERY DAY WITH JOY IN YOUR HEART, PEACE IN YOUR HEART, THAT DEVIL UNDER YOUR FEET AS WE WERE SINGING LAST NIGHT? HALLELUJAH. I'm being carnal now, Brother Brown. I'm looking at the the clock. &gt;&gt; Take it down. My mind wants to be compassionate on y'all's getting tired. How many liked our worship last night? &gt;&gt; How many thought that was good? &gt;&gt; That was good. Amen. Why? I think you know if we would all drop dead, we'd all drop dead. I would trust that we'd rise on the other side saying glory. Hallelujah. I'M STILL THE SAME OVER HERE AS I WAS OVER THERE. I'M STILL GIVING GOD GLORY. I'M STILL GIVING GOD PRAISE. I'M DOING WHAT I WAS DOING OVER THERE. IT'S TIME TO ACT LIKE WE'RE OVER THERE YET. &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME TO PRAISE GOD LIKE WE'RE ALREADY THERE. &gt;&gt; OH, WE'RE AS GOOD AS THERE. LET'S REJOICE WITH THAT QUARTER. AMEN. THAT DOWN PAYMENT. YOU COULD BE JUST AS HAPPY WITH THE HOLY GHOST HERE. &gt;&gt; AS IF YOU HAD THE BREAD. WE'RE JUST AS HAPPY AS IF WE was in heaven. &gt;&gt; Give me five, GUYS. GIVE ME FIVE, GIRLS. HALLELUJAH. That's what we're GOING TO DO. WE'RE GOING TO GIVE SOME HIGH FIVES OVER. HALLELUJAH. That's what WE'RE GOING TO DO. WE'RE GOING TO SCREAM AND WE'RE GOING TO SHOUT. WE'RE GOING TO DANCE ABOUT. &gt;&gt; I'm going to LET THE GLORY WHALE WHEN THE ROLL IS COLD AND GLOWING. I'M HAVING THE TIME OF MY LIFE. &gt;&gt; Even when the time of my life isn't over. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Rejoice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Man, &gt;&gt; imagine what we could do if we didn't have this &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; breath to deal with. &gt;&gt; We could just have a good time. &gt;&gt; We wouldn't slow down. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No. Hallelujah. Give it all you got. &gt;&gt; Give it all you got. God is great. God is great. &gt;&gt; Hung the moon and the stars. NEVER HAD A BEGINNING, NEVER HAS an end. GOD IS GREAT. HE BROUGHT US HERE. He made who you are. HE BROUGHT US PROVIDED SALVATION FOR YOU. THE lamb did it all. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is worthy. Well, brother B, you can preach. Brother Ryan, you can preach. Brother Andrew, you can really preach. Brother Matt, you you can really preach. Let me tell you something. We can't preach, &gt;&gt; right? Amen. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; We can't preach, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; No. God gave us gifts. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that gift of God is what preaches. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's him. He gets the credit. AND HE SAYS, "GOD GETS THE CREDIT FOR PREACHING TO YOU THE WORD OF GOD. WE DON'T SEEK GLORY. WE GIVE HIM THE GLORY. &gt;&gt; HE gives me the grace." That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. Get somebody up here that don't have the gift and see what happens. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Well, like not sure what I'm going to say, huh? I guess we'll see what the forefathers did. No, &gt;&gt; you won't be able to preach. It's a gift that God gives. &gt;&gt; That's right, &gt;&gt; brother Brandon. How many know he was given that gift &gt;&gt; to where he could stand here and dream dreams or so to speak visions, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He was made his subconscious conscience built that close together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God gets the glory. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; How many believe God gets the glory? &gt;&gt; God is worthy &gt;&gt; of all of our praise. He is worthy of our shouting, &gt;&gt; our dancing, &gt;&gt; the way that WE LIVE, CONSECRATE OURSELVES, HONOR HIM WITH our lives. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; When we come into THE HOUSE OF GOD, I will enter his gates, &gt;&gt; with sadness in my heart. &gt;&gt; No, I will enter HIS GATES WITH THANKSGIVING IN MY HEART. I WILL ENTER HIS COURTS WITH &gt;&gt; PRAISE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GLORY, HONOR, POWER, STRENGTH, GLORY BE TO HIM. WE REALIZE IT'S ALL ABOUT HIM. &gt;&gt; WE TALK A LOT ABOUT US AND WHAT HE'S GIVEN US AND WHO WE ARE, but I like to talk about who he is. He's everything. &gt;&gt; He is my everything. He is my all. Amen. Sometimes I think we need to do in closing, we do need to do like Paul and Silas did. Ain't that right? They were locked up in the inner prisons. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, if Israel, if Israel would have just done it whenever they got in by the Red Sea. Hello. &gt;&gt; Paul and Silas in prison. &gt;&gt; Israel by the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; God put him in a trap, didn't he? &gt;&gt; There they were sitting. Oh man. Man, did Moses did you bring us out here to die? &gt;&gt; You know, wasn't there enough graves in Egypt? What kind of a leader are you, Moses? If they had just done it a little bit different. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If it had been Joshua and Caleb's, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; If David said, "Just stand still. Just hold still a minute." DIDN'T EVEN GOD SAY MANY TIMES HE SAYS, "YOU JUST STAND STILL. I WILL FIGHT YOUR BATTLE." THE BATTLE IS NOT YOURS. IT'S MINE. NOT THE BATTLE IS NOT YOURS. IT'S GOD'S. BROTHER ON THE BATTLE IS NOT YOURS. IT'S GOD'S. YOU ARE GOD. DEFEAT THE DEVIL EVERY TIME. HALLELUJAH. THE BATTLE IS HERE. REST, LITTLE BRIDE. REST. &gt;&gt; We have rest when hard times come. When struggles come, all those trials, all those tests that God puts us through. What is it to do? I've come to the conclusion. It's to bring us to the death of oursel. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; It's to teach us to rely on him, &gt;&gt; to give our battles to him, to give our fears to him and let him fight it for us. &gt;&gt; Because man, doesn't matter who and what. Remember this one thing. Your biggest enemy &gt;&gt; is still that old self of yours. &gt;&gt; Not in getting it out of the way. Not dying to yourself. Not committing things to God when you should. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But we're getting to that place, aren't we? How many's looking for a rapture? &gt;&gt; Yes. God bless your hands. We're all looking for that rapture anytime. And I'm here to tell you this morning, may we say, God, I don't care what you got to do. You have me &gt;&gt; ready. &gt;&gt; Often often says it's not a time to get ready. Not a time to get ready unless you're not ready. &gt;&gt; But Jesus said, "Be ready. &gt;&gt; Be ready. &gt;&gt; Be ready. Walk every day ready to go." &gt;&gt; How many in here? Just be honest. Heads bowed. Heads bowed. How many in here would say, brother Ba, I'll be honest with that question with what you statement that you made a while ago that death doesn't really change you. I heard brother B say that different times very strongly. It doesn't change who you are. It only changes your dwelling place. Can you say that you'd be ready to go? Or do you need to make adjustments? Do you need to commit yourself more to God? How many would be in here in that condition say I'm not where I ought to be. Amen. See, cuz the we don't come here just for our good places. We come to see where our bad places are, &gt;&gt; where we can give more to God. And that's who I'm calling on to now. Be honest. You're not raising your hand to me. You raise it to Jesus Christ and say, you know, I can't honestly say in my heart, can honestly say in my heart that I'm really ready and I want to be ready and Jesus loves you and Jesus will forgive you and Jesus will help you. He wants you to be ready more than what you do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so as you raise your hand, let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, you see these hands that still are not quite ready. There's still an element they need to change. There's still something, Lord, that they need to give over to you that they need to surrender. They haven't surrendered their life completely like they should. They're still struggling with this or that. Father, you see those hands right now. And we ask, God, that you go beneath that hand, Lord Jesus, and may they consecrate themselves more deeply, Lord. Surrender theselves more deeply, Lord, so that you can move in there. give an avenue of coming in and changing their life, Lord, and filling them with your spirit, Lord. Giving them that uncction of the Holy Spirit, Lord. We ask, God, that you would do this just now, Father, they wouldn't go to the same out of here as they came &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I've got so much to thank him for, so much to praise him for. Amen. How many knows that Lord has been so good to me? &gt;&gt; He's been so good to us. The least we can do is completely surrender to him. God bless you. Let's stand. Musicians, if you'll come. Amen. We'll turn it over. Amen to our pastor again. I want to say amen again. It's been a real pleasure to be with you. &gt;&gt; It is Amen. When brother Andrew and brother Ron an invited me over to come about six months ago, you know, I thought it was a long time and then just a few weeks I says, "Wow, it's already here." I thought, you know, that's just how quickly we'll be going back home. &gt;&gt; Amen. How lovely it would be to be able to be here, visit with everybody, get to know everybody, and wouldn't that be nice? &gt;&gt; But time and so forth doesn't allow us to do that. But I believe even the prophet says, you know, we'll make an appointment later on. We'll make an appointment. We'll all get together. I can just imagine it, can't you? &gt;&gt; All message churches to believers, at least the saved ones out of them. Amen. They'll all come up there. We'll have 10,000 years. We're so grateful for the mercy of God. God bless you people. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I pray that the word that's been brought has been a blessing to you, has encouraged you, brought your faith up, knocked the devil down. Amen. And brought you joy. God bless you, baby. God bless you, brother. Amen. God bless you, baby. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We got something to praise the Lord for, don't we? &gt;&gt; I was sitting yesterday morning with uh with a business partner. He came and just showed up for breakfast and he was sitting there talking. He's he's one of the smartest men I've ever met in my life. And he's sitting there and he was talking and he was talking about the different languages that that we use. And he said throughout our day, he said, "We you barely use a thousand words in our day in our vocabulary." And I began to think while brother Tom was just ministering on that thought. We never could express with all of the words that we've been able to have throughout our English language of how great our God is. &gt;&gt; I can tell you one thing for sure. We enjoy worshiping the Lord here. &gt;&gt; But he said this. He said this in his statement. He said, he said, "The Bible said to make a joyful noise to the Lord." &gt;&gt; And I I looked at him and he said, he said, "But so many people look at that and think it's just a loud voice." He said, "But they forget that there's something to be happy about, too." And I thought, "Here's one of the most smartest men that's ever walked in shoe leather." And here he is. His intelligence still tells him that there is a God that is deserving of all the worthy. He's worthy of all the glory, honor, and praise. Well, we're just a bunch of hillbillies down here. &gt;&gt; And there is something on the inside of us that wants to express that he is still Jehovah Gyra. He is still Jehovah Shalom.

We realize that the scripture says to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ every one of you for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that this promises unto you and to your children to many as the Lord our God shall call. And here's a proof today that God is still calling. &gt;&gt; And Peter went on to say and he began to testify to them many words said to be a witness unto this unward generation and our Lord Jesus Christ is still calling witnesses. And we're so thankful for our brother's decision to take on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Our brother, we just pray and God will refill you with the Holy Ghost as commissioned by his word. Father, we come before you today in this very sacred and sovereign moment. Lord, we realize, Lord Jesus, the abilities of human beings, Father, that we could we could do a whole lot with our hands, but Lord, we could never do anything what you're doing today. Lord, I so thank you, Father, that the word of the Lord is quick and powerful, that it still reaches. Our brother's been streaming for quite some time and here he is been coming the last few services father and feels the prick in his heart Lord Jesus to make everything right to bury the old man. And I pray father Lord Jesus that you would do exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ever ask or think. Now, Father, you said it in your words over 2,000 years ago that if we would repent to completely to completely turn away from the old man and to turn to you, Father, that you would fill us with the gift of the Holy Ghost. Our brother is desiring to take on not just a name, but the name of all of heaven and earth. We realize that the king's sword has been placed in the bride's hand. So, Father, today as I stand here with that rod of the name of Jesus Christ in my hand to strike down the enemy, I baptize our brother in Christian baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have brother Alvin's wife, sister Marian here to take on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We're so thankful for her decision today. Amen. is let's just pray and ask the Lord Jesus to do a great work in your life. Father, you commissioned us, Lord, right before your ascension to go into all the world and baptize them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. We realize today, Lord Jesus, that Peter picked up that revelation on the day of Pentecost and he stood there and preached unto them and 3,000 souls were saved on that day. And father, we realize Lord Jesus that he grabbed the revelation of who who the name of heaven is. It's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. So, Father, according to thy commission to go into all the world. Here we are in this little parcel of land in Elton, Virginia, baptizing and commissioning Lord Jesus, our sister, to go out there and to be a witness of the Holy Ghost. So, Father, according to thy word, I baptize our sister in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Mason, you're a special man to me. You remind me a lot of myself. You're the best golfer I probably ever played with in my entire life. Seen you hit some of the greatest shots. But I couldn't be more proud of you than I am right now. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You might be a pro in that world, but today you're a superstar in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; According to thy faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, you've repented of your sins. &gt;&gt; It was more than a girl that brought you here. It was our Lord Jesus Christ that did this great work. and God will finish. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we stand here, Lord Jesus, in this watery grave. Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, we sense the very nearness of the Holy Spirit, the witness of the great I am. Lord, you told us in your word that if we would go therefore and preach, Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, that you would bring forth some 40 and some 50, some 60, some 100fold. Father, Lord, Brother Mason's been sitting here, Lord Jesus, and has heard the message of the hour preached. It has stirred his heart abundantly, Father. We have seen you deal with his life over and over again. And today we are a witness, Lord Jesus, that you're still calling those. And Father, Lord, I stand here, Lord Jesus, in this very special moment. I pray, Father, that as I baptize him in water that you would baptize him with the fire of the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; Lord, he means so much to his mother and father. He means so much to Full Gospel Lighthouse, but he means so much more to heaven. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And Father, today he walks out of this water. Lord, completely different than he walked in. He walks out carrying the name of Jesus Christ, an ambassador of all of heaven. So according to thy word, I baptize brother Mason in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Let's stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. As we prepare to dis be dismissed this morning. Oh, there is power. Power, wonder working power in the blood of the lamb.
