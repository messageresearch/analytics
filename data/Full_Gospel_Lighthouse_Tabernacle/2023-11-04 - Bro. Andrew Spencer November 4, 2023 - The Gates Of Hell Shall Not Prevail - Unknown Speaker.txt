that we went through and as we read across these prayer requests there's many many amongst us many across the bride that are that are in very dire need and if a doctor would come and tell us those reports surely surely Satan would come and strike us with fear but Lord Jesus you told us not to fear you told us to walk with you and you will take us through every trial every test that we we come up against and Lord Jesus you won't put us through anything that we cannot handle and no matter how big that demon stands in front of us and how how big he might be we take it back to our Prophet when he stood there and he saw that demon getting bigger and bigger in front of him and then he just began to speak the word and he just got smaller and smaller and he realized that it was you that was standing there behind him and it's you that's going to be standing there with us all the way Lord and I just ask that your your healing hand would come and and come across the building and not only that Lord there's there's many Souls that that need a touch from you and it's bigger than just a physical touch it's a spiritual touch that needs the Holy Ghost over top of Our Lives because we know if that token is not applied when when you come and I believe that day is very soon these people will be left behind and we've we've sat and we've listened to the word and maybe you've been here for 30 and 40 years but if we our heart is not ready you will come and you will leave us right where we are sitting in the same condition that we've always set in and Lord Jesus my prayer tonight is that we would be able to leave this building tonight with a perfect love a perfect love with no matter who comes against us no matter what test or what what enemies come and say against us we can turn and say I forgive you and we turn and we we pray for that person that they may see the light that we have been given Lord and I just ask that we would just come and we would be able to pull on the gift tonight as brother Andrew's been inspired this week and he's been inspired to bring forth the word Lord Jesus I just ask that you would allow us to fall under that same anointing now Lord and just as our brother Ed Bisal is he would stay in there and he would be in the vision and and he wouldn't even recognize that he was the young boy in the Checker church allow us not to miss that Vision we've seen that we've seen that this is the time and the time and the Rapture is at hand allow us to recognize our place with you Lord allow us to be able to see what time it is and all the seals have been revealed all the Mysteries have been revealed the only thing left is a Rapture and your return Lord Jesus I ask that you would just come and you would anoint us now anoint brother rre and the song

lords into our midst Lord we feel Lord Jesus your presence even cooing to us as your children Lord here tonight we are asking Lord that you would begin to Min Minister To Us by the preaching of Thy word father we realize Lord that it is in this word that we we gain our strength Lord we recognize that our confidence is not in ourselves it's not in in our own doings but it is in you father so we commit this this service to you we committed our bodies we commit our mind and our soul father and yield ourselves over to the power of the Holy Ghost we realize that we see Wicked on every hand and we see men and women yielding theirselves to the powers that be but Lord if we can just yield oursel over to the power of the Holy Ghost father Lord I was reading today where brother brandom said if we could take all of our burdens everything that is upon this life and we could just lay let our let you take the burdens off of us and because we can come to you because your burden is easy and your yoke is light and I heard brother brandom say that that yoke when you put it upon us it's it's it's beded with feathers father Lord we don't know we think we know Pleasures in this life but the real pleasure father the real satisfying portion is the Holy Ghost father so we dedicate this service to you our beings everything that is done and said here tonight we want it to be done for the glory of the Lord father Lord I pray that You' move us aside just now and begin to minister To Us by Your Word father and we'll be careful to serve you in Jesus Christ's name and the bride says amen if you have your Bibles this evening we'd like to look over in the Book of Matthew Book of Matthew chapter 16 and verse 13 Book of Matthew 16 and verse 13 it's probably Gabriel's fault amen good to see you brother Steve sister Elizabeth God bless you tonight amen I'd like to speak to you tonight on on a thought that the Lord's put on my heart I was completely studying a different way and about 12 12:30 today the Lord changed my changed my thought and it was coming so fast and I was writing it down as fast as I could and I I said like I said like that a colored lady said Lord Jesus you going to have to back off before you hurt me here so so so this be this will be new to us all here tonight I know not going to preach anything higher than you what you already know but the Lord was putting some things together for us today so we just trust the leadership of the Lords but I'd like to speak to you tonight on the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail Matthew chap 16 ver 13 and when Jesus came into the coast of ciser Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said some say thou art John the Baptist some say Elias and others jeremias or one of the prophets and he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven ain't that amazing hear Peter standing on Earth but the Father in heaven was revealing these things to him and I said also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven may God bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the Lord why don't you reach over and grab your neighbor and shake their hand and just tell them let's have church tonight now we know that Jesus was not a philosopher that was searching for truth he was truth he was truth he was not a Mystic but he is a reality he was not a reformer he is the creator is that right he was not a Visionary because he was the light of the world he never had the reason because he know all things Jesus he never was in a hurry and he never was afraid and he never showed weakness our Lord Jesus Christ he never hesitated and he always is ready he was always sure and there was shortess in all that he said and all that he ever did he had no sense of sin and he had no need of forgiveness he never sought or needed advice he knew why he came and he knew from whence he came he knew who he was and he knew who the father was and he knew all about heaven he knew where he was going and he knew all about humankind he knew who Satan was and he knew every imp and he knew every demon and he knew every name that could be named of all of hell he had no lack our lord Jesus has no limitations and you and I tonight sit here SE in Heavenly places and we are recreated in Christ Jesus we are in Christ and we are members of him Jesus had no fear so you don't have to have fear Jesus he had no defeat so you don't have to live in defeat he did not shrink and he did not shrink to the power of pain or to the brutal brutal treatment that he was under but he showed that he was the master of every circumstance when they arrested him he was Master he was Master at the trial he was Master at the cross he was Master at the grave and he was Master over all of hell he was and will forever be the almighty God yet he was just a man but to know that tonight he's living in you and I he's living right here he is the same yesterday today and forever and when Jesus was standing here in mortal flesh 2,000 years ago the Gates of Hell could not stand against him and they could not prev Prevail against him even though they were against him it did not have enough prevailing power to overcome anything that Jesus was and all that Jesus ever stood for could never be defeated even though it looked like on Friday that they had defeated Jesus on the cross he was never defeated he was never defeated and to think that tonight that our Lord Jesus Christ is still the mighty conqueror even after 2,000 years he is still winning battles and he still fighting for us and to think that tonight that God sent us a message he didn't send us a message just to give us another church or to bring us another move he didn't give us a message just to build another church or just to have another Association but he brought us a message that would loose Us by the power of the loosing of the Seven Seals a body body word people that have been loosed by the preaching of Malachi 4 to recognize that we have been loosed to believe that all things are possible possible loose to believe that Satan has no power over the Church of the Living God and to think that tonight it was because of this message that called you by name that has given you authority to recognize like Peter was standing there and he was recognizing that this was a revelation that didn't come from William brandham himself it didn't come from his mama and it didn't come from his daddy but this Revelation that you have received of the message of the hour is just like Peter received it it came from the father above that's why it can't be a mama and a daddy experience for our young people they've got to know Jesus Christ by a born again true Revelation a born again experience baptized from the brains all the way to their toes they've got to be birthed under the kingdom of almighty God that's why our young people cannot be built upon intellectualism neither can they be built upon knowledge they've got to be built upon sound Doctrine you can't build these young people up on emotion and you can't build them up on their own religion and you can't build them up on legalism you got to build them up on the fundamental foundational faith that is the Bible Doctrine by the Bible word because if you just give them legalism it'll constrain their worship it'll constrain their life yet they can't be built upon a dead religion either they've got to be built upon the power of the Holy Ghost that's why Jesus gave us a Living Word not a dead word because the Holy Ghost is not a teaching the Holy Ghost is not a learned behavior it is not a Reformation it's a transformation and Jesus cared so much that he gave you a message that's got power behind it that's got Authority behind it and he told us that the gates of hell would not Prevail against this church well praise the Lord Brother bam said he said but today we have little Sensations and little isms and and that breaks us up and separates and little evidences and little everything else that separates us he said it's shows that we never come to that place where we're completely sold out to the almighty God and to stand on the pillar of his Eternal Word and say I now claim the faith that was once delivered to the Saints he said not from your lips but from your heart not from your lips but from your heart not an intellectual conception but a born again experience that makes you a changeed creature he said that's the faith that was once delivered to the Saints he said that's why you see people that some of them are on the housetop all the time others say well I I was healed yesterday but bless God I lost my healing he said you never had it to begin with he said but when that word is once anchored all devils in Hell couldn't shake you away from it because Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it what is it it is the spiritual revealed truth of Jesus Christ and when Jesus was standing there and told him Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it he was showing to us that Jesus was showing to us there at CIS Philippi that the gates of hell would be against us it shows us that hell would be against the Revelation not just the church but it would be against the revelation of what the church is built on but the gates of hell has been trying for over 2,000 years to Prevail against the Revelation that is in the body of Jesus Christ and it did not Prevail then and it will not Prevail now it has wared after years year after year time after time and it has went down in defeat but I'd say that you showed up to church tonight to show to the devil you are going down in defeat one more day you'll say well you have no idea what I've been through you still showed up here tonight and you got Gung it you got air in your lungs you got energy in your body you got a right mind to come to the house of God you say you can say well I've I've been through hell I went through hell I walked through hell I've walked through all all kinds of circumstances but you still had enough gumption to show the devil whose side you're on it's proof tonight that Jesus is still Jesus he's not a god of the Bible of days gone by he's the god of right now he's the god of my future he's the god of my past well blessed be the name of the Lord if it didn't stop Paul and it didn't stop Peter then the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against the body of Jesus Christ Hallelujah [Applause] now David said in Psalm 69 and2 that they that sit in the gate speak against me and I was the song of the drunkard Hallelujah I was the song of the drunkards you see the gates of a city it doesn't matter where they are throughout the cities the gates were always a place of concourse they were places where business was transacted it was a place where courts were frequently held at was at the gates and here all of the powers that be that that were setting there all the high ranking officials all the magistrates were a part of the Cry of reproach that was against David David was subject to town talk he was subject to town talk and everybody knows that good news it goes It goes only about an inch but bad news goes about a mile but even though David was sitting here and he was saying that the gates that these Gates that they that set by all the magistrates all the high-ranking officials all the magistrates they speak evil against me at the gate you see it shows to us that demons and mockers will always be against us but David didn't stop right there and listen to The Voice to the voices of the gates of hell but verse 13 it says but as for me what are you going to do with when hell shows up at your house what are you going to do when all hell turns loose on your family but David said but as for me do I have a David in the house of God tonight but as for me my prayer is unto thee in an acceptable time you see in my mocking I will pray to you in my defeat I will praise you come on somebody when in my weakness I will praise you when my victory I will glorify you in my sickness I will pray you you see you can sit there and you can listen to all the hounds of Hell Whispering all kinds of lies of you but you have got to turn your eyes and focus them on the one thing that will always remain same mockers will change face to face there'll be two fa today and eight faces tomorrow but there is one God one Lord One Faith who is above all through all and in you all he's not changing and he's not going away that's why David would say that the Lord is my light he is my light and my salvation of Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came up upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled are you hearing me all the gates of hell they stumbled you're not going to fall but they're going to fall stumbled it's time that you turn that finger around on the devil it's time he starts pointing he keeps pointing out things in your family things in your life things in your future that you can't even control yourself but it's time you turn the scriptures loose on him they stumbled and fell though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should arise against me in this will I be confident yes in this will I be confident the Lord is my light and my salvation what did he say in Isaiah 59 and 19 that when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him William Bram said Christ never sent me to build an organization he said but he sent me to build individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ that they might be a Powerhouse and a dwelling place of the Spirit by his word by his word see build up the individual to that place that's why Peter would say he said you are living stones built up a spiritual house it's showing that you're a living Revelation that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever yeah blessed be the name of the Lord somebody's going to be a revelation somebody's going to prove that all of hell can't win somebody's going to be the quickening power somebody's going to show they got the quickening power somebody's going to prove that the Dynamics is the Holy Ghost come on somebody now Christ ain't building a church that's just built out of stick and mortar he's not building a church that's built on emotions and not build it's he's not building a church that's built on feelings well I I felt I felt the presence of the god move over top of me and I had goosebumps run down all over my face all over my body God ain't building a church that just got goosebumps when the presence of the Lord comes he's building a church whether they get goosebumps or not he's building a church whether they feel the spirit of God or not he's building a church whether everybody's for you or whether everybody's against you I tell you what God's Building he's building a church that ain't a hot bid plant that's got to be petted around patted around got to have a pacifier in her mouth but she knows who she is she knows what he wants done with the word come on somebody if you don't like it turn your cat around the other way and it'll grub right he want somebody who knows who she is that she can call on his name Midnight day night in the middle of the day she can call on his name and find out that he's still that kind of God that he was back clearing the Bible know where the the Bible tells us of a lady in Proverbs chapter 31 that the Bible said that who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies ain't that beautiful that her price is far above rubies don't you know that the Bible tells you that you are not redeemed with corruptible things of gold and silver of things that do corrupt but you are Redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ don't you recognize how virtue with this this woman is it shows the value that the husband has of this woman because it isn't it isn't her value it's his value in here in her come on don't you see what makes you valuable it ain't your skin it's your soul that God thought of you before the foundation of the world and when he thought of you the lamb was slain Hallelujah the heart of her husband to safely trust in her so that he shall never that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life that's that's the woman that is married to Christ a woman that's fruitful a woman that's bringing forth many children raising some Warriors come on somebody I know we live in that whole this whole layout to see an age where everybody wants to be lovey lovey but God ain't raising them kind of children God's raising some Warriors that ain't afraid to stand up whether to defend somebody in their face or behind their back he's raising Warriors that'll tell the truth and nothing but the truth whether they got a Bible in front of them or a Bible behind them he's raising children under the most high God that ain't scared of any potentate or any King This Woman's a virtuous woman especially in his eyes with whom she is called the fairest amongst women a woman yes yes she might be the weaker vessel but it's not in her demise it just means that she is unable to do anything without him yet everything through him a virtuous one that means that she is uninjured in her love and her affection to Christ Jesus her husband this woman she's steadfast in her adherence to him by faith as her Lord and her savior she is incorrupt in her Doctrine she is sincere in her worship she is sincere in her spiritual praise she retains the purity of discipline she holds Holiness as a standard of life she holds the mystery of faith in a pure conscience this woman a virtuous woman is called a woman of strength a woman of Valor and a woman of Courage I don't know if you figured this out yet or not but I'm talking about you I can say that you could say this about this woman just like it was said in first Samuel 16 And1 18 about David the son of Jesse that this woman is mighty she's a mighty valued woman she's a woman of War she is prudent in matters she's a comely person and the Lord is with her I'm talking about the elect lady that was thought of before hell was ever created now push the devil around with that broom for once I was thought of before a hell and all of its Angels was ever created come against me all you want to push against me all you want to but I was in his mind first before you made me sick I was already healed Hallelujah before you made me fall he already seen me Rising I'm a virtuous woman I'm a woman that's Valiant to fight a woman that's got courage a woman that ain't afraid to boast of her power woo This Woman This bride is militant in her ways yes she's got many enemies name them off she's got many enemies and they might be power powerful and they might be Mighty they might seem cunning and they might seem crafty but with all of their policy and all of their power that they form down there in hell they will never overcome her the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against her is this all right with you tonight she engages with them all bring all your powers up here this virtuous woman is not hiding behind the cloak but she's standing behind the shield of faith Hallelujah this virtuous woman is called in the Bible of more than a conqueror she gains all of her spiritual strength from Christ she fights the Lord's battles she withstands every enemy she exercises Grace she does every good work and this bride will persevere until the end woo David said in Psalms 125 they that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion which cannot be removed but abideth forever as the mountains round about Jerusalem so the Lord is round about its people from henceforth even forever hallelujah hallelujah you believe that your Bible you believe that your Bible he will be around about you forever how many had some bad stuff happen to you this week I will be around you forever how many got some news this week that maybe you wasn't expecting I will be around you forever come on somebody there's people that are listening on this on the other side of the world that are having hard hard trials and troubles more than Maybe you can even imagine in their mind but the Lord is the god of his people I will be around about heroo Isaiah 14 and 30 and said the firstborn of the poor shall feed and the needy shall lie down in safety so let me give it to you like this and through him the poor supp poor will find pasture and the needy will lay down in peace and I will kill the root with famine and he shall slay thy Remnant so the Lord will starve the very root of the Philistines with a s with a famine that will annihilate all of their survivors send the weakest devil up here send the strongest devil up here my God's going to Star them out until they're annihilated you know what they get strength from is whipping you but do you realize what God is taking away from Satan he is taking the very power away from Satan Hallelujah verse 31 how oh gate cry oh City thou oh pelia palestinia art dissolved for Thou shalt come from the north I smoke and None Shall be alone in his appointed time Katie was showing me a video just just before service I didn't say nothing to her cuz I knew that the Lord had dropped this scripture in my heart today but it showed a they couldn't explain it but it looked like it was a great big pillar of smoke coming coming straight out of the earth and it was covering all the land of Israel how oh great oh gate cry oh City thou oh palestinia art dissolved for Thou shalt come from the north a smoke and None Shall be alone in his appointed time so let me put that in layman's terms that not even a straggler will make it out of the city Palestine can go over there in Israel right now and they can go over there and try to destroy all of Israel now you know good and well that that that in IND times that they would send out smoke cigal when they was trying to figure out when they was trying to figure out when they was trying to send it to their parties that were across the land they would send out a smoke signal and said it's time for war but the Bible is saying to us that the signal of War for the children of Israel is the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire you don't even recognize what is happening right now but the pillar of fire is in the room and is sending a signal to hell that the King of Kings has showed up to do damage to the powers of hell it's a smoke signal when the pillar fire shows up hell's about to lose what happened out there in Portland Oregon when that Maniac thought he was going to do all of his might and destroy the prophet he'd done it to many of preachers out there but this time he showed up at the the wrong church and tried taking on a wrong kind of preacher well I got news for all of hell we that kind of Believers tonight we still following that same Prophet that told that demon tonight you'll bow over my feet the pillar of fire is in the room and he challenging you to believe I am your weapons of warfare you cannot lose you cannot go down in defeat verse 32 what shall one then say or answer The Messengers of the nation what shall you say to all the nations out there what are you going to say to all the ntion all the nations out there that the Lord has founded this Holy Ghost move that the Lord has founded this Zion the Lord has founded Israel Hallelujah the Lord has founded this and the poor of his people shall trust in it what Jesus say my sheep know my voice they hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow what did he say I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my Father which gave them me is greater than all no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand and I my father are one hell you can do your worst but you ain't getting me out of Papa's hands cancer came and I was still in Papa's hands troubles came and I was still in Papa's hands Le oia came with his flu bug and tried to make it cold and make you lukewarm but I was still in Papa's hands come on somebody ain't no weapon that's going to be formed against you it's going to prosper is that right and it ain't by your might and it ain't by your power but it's by his Spirit sayith the Lord and any Warrior that thinks they're going to go out there and defeat the enemy on their own accord or By Their Own Strength ain't God's Warrior come on somebody if you think you're going to do this on your own you're going to find out real quick that defeat ain't far distant away from you but the Bible said it's not by might and it's not by power but by my spirit sayith the [Music] Lord CT stud CT stud said this a man from the 1800s he said someone live within the sound of a church or Chapel Bell he said but I want to run a rescue shop within the yard of Hell let me take this out maybe maybe I'm talking to the wrong group here tonight am I talking to or Full Gospel Lighthouse here is this microphone too loud for you or is it too is it too soft for you or or y'all y' y'all want to have church here tonight and I showed up here and I know Jesus showed up here and I know you're preaching with me but I want to know is everybody on the same message here tonight we are one body we're one Accord some people want to live that kind of easy life tell me how it is to love all my neighbors tell me about it tell me how to to get prosperity and how to get wealth brother Andrew I tell you I do it you probably don't want to hear the answer pull that baby out but there's a lot of people in this layot see and age that want to live close by the fence they want to be real close and you don't recognize that's more dangerous than actually being being outside of it we don't want to just talk about the message we want to be in the message so there's a lot of people that want to be in close to the chapel Bell or be up there get a 15minute sermon have some guy preach the them some flowery speech that'll tell them how to get to heaven and how to love their neighbors but CT stud said but I want to run a rescue shop right in the yard of hell we're right here in the midst of Elan let it be a signpost to this community that we are running a rescue shot from hell I don't care how bad you are I don't care how low you are I don't how care how bad you are bring the worst sinner into this city into this place and my God will show that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against the mercies Hallelujah come on somebody you're called to go higher you're a Powerhouse you're a Powerhouse by the word can I give you Bible Doctrine by the word you're more than a match for the Devil by the word you're Satan's worst nightmare by the word you're an invincible Army and Satan don't care what your title is he don't care what your last name is he don't care if you whether you're a Fraser a Spencer a brandom whether you're a how as hell whether you're whether you're a good whether you're a Thomas I'm covering some land today I don't care if you're a Lambert I don't care if you're a shifflet I don't care if you're Noel Satan does not care what your last name [Applause] is he didn't call my name somebody call your neighbor's [Applause] name now say I didn't call your name hopefully you know your neighbor's name if not we're going to have one of those meetings here my name's John some people say well a so many new people coming in here we just don't know we don't know all their names well let me tell you if you ain't figure that out that's God's doings don't worry you get 10 million years to find out what their name is and what their story is well let me get back to my point Satan don't care what your last name is whether you're a brandom or a Spencer he's coming to attack your mind your money your spirit your soul he's coming to attack you and take away from everything and get you off balance to make you disbelieve the word of God because he knows that if this church finds a revelation of who she is and what Satan is that she will be an invincible Army I tell you right now Satan can do its worst against the church of the Living God and will still be standing well come on somebody I got one goal and it's Rapture and I got news hell ain't going to stop me come on somebody hell ain't going to stop me Bible said in James James 4:7 to resist the devil and he will flee from you but a lot of people they try that I rebuke you I rebuke you I rebuke you but they do not find the very first portion of that scripture submit yourself therefore unto God surrender yourself you are never going to win with an unsurrendered heart you're never going to overcome that's why you find people well bless God I my feelings got hurt tonight and I guess I'm going to quit church or I'm going to give up and I they didn't sing my song [Applause] tonight it's because they are serving God from an unsurrendered heart let me tell you something when you go over there and you start reading about Samson I'm gonna get to him just a little bit later Lord willing but when you start reading about Samson laying his head in Li of's lap what was the first sign it was a sign of uncommit the next sign and she started shaving off his uncommit and she started shaving off his pride I got this I got control of this I can handle this come on somebody I can live this in church I can live this around my peeps I can live this come on somebody I know that's one of y'all New Age kind of talk ain't it peeps it's chill he where's Jay at I need him he knows that lingual and he teaches it to me but what did he do she started shaving off those Seven Locks I've got this I've got this I've got this figured out I'm okay I've defeated lions and I've defeated all all these Philistines I've I've tied a thousand foxes together I've I've defeated all of these enemies before he got confident he got confident in his own stature but Jesus is not building a church that is built upon their own strength he's building a church that's fully committed come on somebody but don't you pay no attention to what the devil says to you if he tells you you're uncommitted that's proof to me right there I am committed might be committed to an aane institution one these SP but I am committed to the Lord Jesus Christ you see we've got a building to build we got a church to build and you cannot stop and listen to the lies of the devil and the critics that are sounding off their sounds of hell but we've got a church to build by the blueprints of the word and when you build it according to to the revelation of Jesus Christ the gates of hell that's why William Brandon would say to you that you're not feeding on the mind of a man but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man I'm not building you up on emotion I'm not building you up on my mind I'm not building you up on William brownon the man I'm building you up on the message of the Angel and when you build a church that kind of way Satan knows no defeat like what's coming to him Satan might think that he's got the upper arm or the upper hand on you but when God shows up it looked all right in legion's life as long as Jesus wasn't in the picture but when Jesus gets past the storm and he starts walking on the banks of gadara and he starts walking up there Legion is about to get a new name and hell has been against the church all of these years but she does not realize hell does not realize that Jesus is showing up you remember that story about that that woman that woman that was that was brought there ambulance wouldn't take her and and she was completely she was actually in an instain institution and and her husband wanted to get her into brother Brandon's meetings everybody all right and he was trying to get her into brother brandom's meetings and so these guys took a took a station wagon and they and they they put her in there five guys couldn't hold her down she kicked out she kicked out the windows out of the back end of that station wagon and and they put her down there in the basement of that Auditorium where brother brandham was and brother brandham was called down there that Auditorium and brother Bram brother Baron was down there they called him down there and he he started seeing her like that and she was bleeding all over legs where she kicked out that glass and he said what happened here so the husband be to tell the story that she'd been in this insane Institution for 2 years and didn't know her own name didn't know her she she completely lost her mind mother band said well I'll go over and talk to her and the husband said no don't do that you she'll kill you so brother man said he said I walked over there and he said I I took her by the hand I took her by the hand and he said I shook her hand and he said I I he said how do you do and brother Bram said that that woman in all of her strength said it was n't her said but it was another Power he said she had completely yielded herself to that power it's amazing and he said here she was a little B old woman and he said she about flung me across a room and said she started slithering on her back like a snake you know the story she started slithering on her back like a snake and said William brandom you have nothing to do with me and the husband said how did she know your name she ain't even spoken to years she don't even know she don't even know her name brother R said that's not that's not her talking that's the power that she yielded to that's speaking out of her he said William brandham you have nothing to do with me he said but the Jesus I represent does you see the Jesus that I represent here tonight hell might think that that I don't have nothing to do with your life and Hell might think that that that I'm speaking things that are that maybe maybe don't make no sense to you but the Jesus that I represent has got everything to do with your life brother Bram said I simply prayed the prayer of faith over her and said send her back to the doctors and let them dismiss her he didn't take her off medication the doctors took her off medication Hallelujah the doctors dismissed her and in two days she was backing her right mind the very next week she was sitting in William bram's meeting and became a pastor's wife don't tell me God can't take a nobody Satan will do all that he can to interrupt God's plans he'll do everything I was listening to souls that now are in prison when brother random is preaching and I found I have always found was amazing but I was listening to it this week and reminded me there brother random he's getting ready to go he's getting ready to go into the vision of hell he goes to he tells us about J C penny about seeing those women there those cat eyes and that that makeup all over her face and you remember you remember the story when brother brandham is getting ready you can hear him he's getting ready to move into the vision of it and all of a sudden there's an interruption in the back end of the church and it's a lady back there and they called to him said she's beginning to faint back there and and so he prays he prays over and said Lord touch her and then he goes into the vision again and then all of a sudden another Interruption they brought her up here and he prayed for her what was hell trying to do it was trying to stop from getting this this vision of Hell On Tape because if you see through a prophet's lens he said whatever I got to do I would persuade men not to go there you see what hell was trying to do it was trying to interrupt God's plans for telling a bride that's not your dwelling place that's not your destiny come on somebody hell was not created for you it was created for the devil and his angels you got nothing to do with hell the only thing you got to do with hell is to conquer it you have no idea what I've been through through you've got every right to look at Hell in its face and say get back to hell where you came from come on come on somebody don't act like you got your angles angels Wings on right now you got every right as a son and daughter of God when the demon of Torment comes and torment your family and torment your mind turn your faith loose on that devil you've got more power than all the angels in heaven you're a son and daughter of the most high God tell hell I have nothing to do with you and you have nothing to do with [Applause] me I'd like to title this portion of the sermon Satan's defeat is all right to have two sermons in one sermon yeah Satan's defeat because if you look at the Bible in 1 John 3 and8 it says for this purpose somebody say for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil but look at Colossians chapter 2 and 15 and having spoiled principalities and Powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it so according to the Bible Jesus has destroyed the works of the devil he has spoiled his power he has triumphed over hell so we must recognize that Satan is a defeated foe that Jesus's Triumph was my Triumph his victory was my victory he did nothing for himself he did it all for you and me he defeated Satan for us he spoiled all of its principalities and all of its powers so if Satan has got a hold of you it's got a hold of you by an illegal possession okay if Satan's got a hold of you he got a hold of you he got a hold of your mind he got a hold of this well it's going to be this long it's going to be this it's going to be this far my I I know what I'm talking about I saw it that Satan will put that little doubt in there and he'll try to put it for a day in the future but if he's got a hold of your mind if he's got a hold of your marriage if he's got a hold of your future husband if he's got a few if he's got a hold of your Holy Ghost if he's got a hold of your dance if he's got a hold of your shout if he's got a hold of your joy if he's got a hold of your peace if he's got a hold of your family if he's got a hold hold of your health he is holding it by an illegal possession he's defeated tonight so if he he is holding you he is holding a hold of the master that created him that's strong brother Andrew I tell you how strong it is if you got the Holy Ghost living on the inside of you then you've got the master of the universe and if Satan has put one little chain of of Affliction or doubt in your mind he's got a hold of the master of the universe it's time Hallelujah this ain't some Genie In A B it's time you turn loose the power of the most high God on the Dynamics of hell what Jesus say and these signs shall follow them that believe I want you to exercise your faith real quick Lay Your Hands over there on your neighbor and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name in my name they shall cast out devils in my name they shall take up serpents in my name that shall drink and a deadly thing and it shall not harm them in my name that shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover if Satan's got a hold of your life he's holding a hold of you illegally tonight and you've got the authority of the Holy Ghost to stand there and say Satan take your hands off of God's Property [Music] hallelujah what am I saying to you I'm saying this to you according to the dream that was shown to the to the prophet and he said I seen them people down there and they were screaming out this is a house of Hell Deliver Us Deliver Us he said but oh he said those big old iron bars seemed like they were 10 inches thick and he said I couldn't do it on my own strength he said but then I Heard a Voice you've got power to do so he said in the name of Jesus Christ House of Hell give way in the name of Jesus Christ if it worked once brother Joel it'll work again I say this to you as the Church of the Living God house of Hell give way in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah cancer is defeated at the name of Jesus Christ every demon has to bow at the name of Jesus Christ tuberculosis has to bow at the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah gouts got to Bow bad circulations got to Bow blessed be the name of the Lord every demon has to bow to the name it ain't the name of a trinity it ain't the name of the church it's a name of Heaven it's the name of Jesus Christ and the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against that name Sugar's got to Bow prodical have to come prison doors have to fling wide At The Mention of the name Hallelujah and there was a creaking and there was a popping and they come out of there running delivered delivered delivered House of Hell give [Applause] way he's a God that recreates he's the god that makes new if you lost your first love he can give it back to you Hallelujah I ain't never lost my faith and I ain't never lost my praise come on somebody Satan can steal your joy he can steal your health but God is a God that has given it back what' you show up to church for tonight come on somebody you go to the gas station to fuel up on gas you go to the grocery store to restock your kitchen you're showed up at the house of God to restock with rocket fuel that'll put you in a rapture know all the powers name them all all of Hell doesn't have enough power to stop my Jesus when William Brandon standing there with the boy in Finland and he recognizes this is the vision this ain't just another boy he's in a moment I feel like I'm in a moment right now call it Deja Vu call it whatever you want to but I feel like I'm in a moment maybe I'll just call it like this I'll call it modern events being made clear by prophecy I feel like I'm in a moment and William brandom recognized when he was in the vision when he was in the vision are you in the vision and when he recognized he was in the vision and he read recognized the panoramic he recognized this was the boy he said you can line up every devil in hell and he said they couldn't stop the vision to comeing to pass you're not some dead fining boy you're the Bride of Jesus Christ you know that he's called you by name come on stop letting that devil lie to you tell you ain't going to make a Rapture stop him right now dead in his tracks pull the shotgun out and pull both bubble D both double barrels on him and turn loose the power of this word hallelujah oh Hallelujah I want to ask you a question can you afford to be subject to the devil one more moment then arise from your bondage shake off them heavy chains come on somebody let healing rise why don't you confess he's my high he's my high tower why don't you confess I'm more than a conqueror why don't you Hold Fast your profession without wavering he's a Lord my God that heals all of my diseases Satan I've had enough of your traps I've had enough of your plans I know hell ain't accustom this kind of service but this is the kind of service that we were bornn for if God would turn the word surely he would say I got you on my mind surely you'd recognize he's talking to you what is it he's going to have somebody that's willing to show that they are possessors of the Gate of the enemy come on Samson you got it in you brother Charles a pillar of fire could be so close to you it could stand right there and watch over your life and raise you up for a moment like you're standing in it's because he's destined you for this age you were not destined to fall and you were not destined for Satan's plans come on Samson you're born for this purpose come on Samson come on Samson get your head out of the wrong place come on Samson you're born with a power the Bible said in judges 16 and I'm closing fast as I can but Samson had got himself in a bad spot he found himself in a harlot's house you ain't that bad off you sitting there in the house of God you ain't that bad off come on now you ain't that bad off you ain't about to give up you had something on the inside of you call it whatever you want to but about midnight Samson woke up and he was realizing that he was living in the wrong house and when he rose up I say it was the angel of Lord that went down there woke Samson up he said you in the wrong house and the Philistines are outside of the city they have found out that you are living in the wrong house and they are coming down here to destroy you but when Samson got woke up by the angel of the Lord something got woke up on the inside of Samson and Samson went out there and grabbed a hold of the gates of gssa and he took them 36 miles and put them up there on top of hibron so that all the world could see he climbed 36 miles went up 3,200 ft in altitude something got woke up on the inside of Samson it said that an average man carrying 550 lbs it putting out 0.5 horsepower I don't know an average man that can carry 550 lbs but I want to meet that guy but it said that's what sence says that an average man carrying 550 lbs is putting out 0.5 horsepower Samson was putting out 28.5 horsepower carrying not 550 lbs he was carrying 10,700 lb all the way up to 21,400 lb amen don't you tell me you ain't got enough when you got Jesus you got more than enough come on somebody if Samson did not have the Holy Ghost and had enough power to carry not only Gates but he carried the post and he carried the bars 36 miles it's time you take a walk down the aisle and show hell whose side you own but let me point you let me change your vision real quick Samson fell Samson found himself grinding at the Mill he had a lot of power when the Holy Ghost would strike him but let me point you to a man you know what it's like when you fall you know what it's like when you fall and you feel that guilt on you and you're so heavy it's heavy guilt is a very heavy place and you find people that are always living from their past it shows they haven't caught the vision of their future yet but if they can ever capture their future to me that's my greatest job as a pastor a preacher is to turn your vision away from your past and your future but you recognize what the power of sin does it makes you depressed it makes you start popping anxiety pills it makes you start seeing psychiatrist it makes you start seeing a psychologist that's what sin does to you it makes you feel so dirty so guilty but this man this man he didn't just take one of your sins he took all he took all your sins 7 billion people in the world over 6,000 years put him on this man brother Greg you mind being being a part of this sermon tonight we're going to take a walk I'm going to ask y'all to do something that y'all going to feel very uncomfortable doing but I want all the sides all the people on this side and all the people on that side I want you to cry crucify and I want you people right here there's more people in the sides than it is in the middle so I want you to cry don't do it don't do it I want you to put yourself right there where them Jews were now wait a minute wait a minute y'all don't know Greg like I know Greg Greg's a good man he never done anybody wrong he's lived a holy life he's done right things he's he lived by the Bible and he's carrying your cross that you should have been carrying when he felt like giving up there was somebody said don't give up don't give up you got what it takes if you don't go they weren't that Silent Scream like you're angry crucify don't do it crucify him they're turning on you Jesus your family's turning on you the people that you love they're turning on you but if you don't go if you don't go I'll never be able to free myself from the guilt are you willing to climb up that hill are you willing to take on the reproach of all the sin of the world he's a good man he's lived a virtuous life and all hell can be against him he's more than enough he cared so much about you that he wouldn't let his hands hang down in defeat so he let him nail his hands to the Cross to prove he's more than enough he's more than enough for your sins Greg he's more than enough for your family sins he's more than enough we got 200 people here tonight but Jesus is telling you take off your old burdens take off your chains they can be against you all they want to hell can raise its ugly head against you but it'll never Prevail against you Greg ma it can raise its ugly head but what you got deposited on the inside of you before the foundation of the world is a pulsation of heaven and Heaven is saying you're more than able the Gates of Hell will never
