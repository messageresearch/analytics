[29:58] &gt;&gt; That's a really big deal. And so, we're
[30:00] just we're just so thankful. We're so
[30:02] thankful. We were reminiscing this
[30:04] morning of the miracles that have
[30:06] happened in this church. And and I I
[30:10] want to share some of those things next
[30:11] week. But when we begin to think about
[30:14] the miracles like this baby getting
[30:15] ready to be born, you know, don't never
[30:18] let the miracles of God slip by you and
[30:22] &gt;&gt; and Isaac being born to parents that
[30:26] couldn't have children and my own
[30:27] grandson. Then Zoe coming along and she
[30:30] couldn't talk and was told that we were
[30:32] told over and over that she wouldn't be
[30:34] able to talk until late in her 20s. And
[30:39] uh well, if you get around her, she's
[30:41] going to tell you some stuff.
[30:43] And so we're just so happy for that. And
[30:46] and uh Sister Autumn, that baby doll
[30:50] that you got sitting beside of you, God
[30:53] so richly blessed you at the very same
[30:56] time. And remember, I'll never forget
[30:59] they telling her she was next in line
[31:01] behind Whitney in the prayer line. And I
[31:03] said, "Sister Autumn, the same angel is
[31:06] visiting your house." And and they
[31:09] showed up at the doctor's office, what,
[31:12] four weeks later, and they were showed
[31:14] up at the same time. You talking about,
[31:18] and they looked at each other and they
[31:19] said, "Well, we know why we're here."
[31:23] Amen. And I love that baby doll with all
[31:26] my heart. I'm so thankful for what God
[31:28] can do. And he's such a miracle working
[31:31] God. And I want to thank I want to thank
[31:34] the Lord. Uh I got some good numbers
[31:36] this week.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for that.
[31:42] I'm so thankful for that.
[31:47] For those that don't know, we have
[31:49] fought cancer for six years. Brain
[31:51] cancer, lung cancer throughout the body.
[31:54] and and uh the medicine has has worked
[31:58] on my kidneys really bad. And so I've
[32:00] been told over the last few months that
[32:02] I would have to go on dialysis. Well,
[32:05] the doctor called me again this week and
[32:07] the surgeon called me to to kind of talk
[32:09] to me for a little while and he was
[32:11] talking to me and and uh the numbers
[32:14] have got to go up a long way, but you
[32:17] know, I'll take a little bit at a time.
[32:19] It'll be okay. I'll take a little bit at
[32:20] a time. And so and so we're just
[32:23] thankful.
[32:30] And so as he began to talk to him, he
[32:32] talked me to me probably about 10 or 15
[32:34] minutes and and uh and we got to the end
[32:38] and he said, "I want to tell you, God
[32:40] bless you."
[32:42] So I know that I've got a surgeon that's
[32:44] a real Christian. So I'm really thankful
[32:46] for that. And so amen. Thank God we got
[32:50] a physician that's higher than all men
[32:53] and
[32:53] &gt;&gt; we know the report that we believe and
[32:56] that report is the arm of the Lord. And
[32:58] so we're thankful for that. Today is a
[33:01] special day.

[55:59] just Last night, I think I got into the
[56:01] testimonies and everything. I don't
[56:03] know. I was back there and said, "You
[56:04] never even prayed last night before you
[56:06] opened up service." So, shall we bow our
[56:08] heads?
[56:10] Lord Jesus, we come before you, Lord,
[56:12] and we've been taught, Father, by your
[56:14] prophet, that we ought to come before
[56:15] the author before opening the author's
[56:18] book. And Lord, ask God that you would
[56:20] just come in a special way and open the
[56:22] book to us, Lord, for we know it is only
[56:24] your Holy Spirit to quicken these words
[56:27] to us and make it alive, Lord.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; And Father, this morning, we want to
[56:30] thank you, Lord Jesus, for your
[56:32] presence, Lord Jesus, in your people,
[56:34] God. Lord, we can never be thankful
[56:36] enough. We can never praise you enough,
[56:38] Father, for what you have done and what
[56:40] you're doing in our hearts and lives,
[56:42] and what you're doing upon the face of
[56:44] the earth in a group of people getting
[56:46] them ready to leave this world and to
[56:48] come home, Lord, and the whole plan of
[56:50] redemption coming to a close, Lord.
[56:53] Father, when the bride leaves, Lord
[56:55] Jesus, and the Holy Spirit lifts,
[56:56] Father, and you come to claim that which
[56:59] you have purchased, that which you have
[57:01] bought, that which you've paid for,
[57:03] Lord. come to make redemption claims,
[57:06] Lord. And we'll see Paul's group come
[57:08] up. We'll see Arinius and Columba Luther
[57:12] Wesley and Pentecost and the message of
[57:15] the hour. We see each one coming up as
[57:17] the prophet described, Lord, to go into
[57:19] the air to meet you in the air. And
[57:22] won't it be a time, Lord? Won't it be a
[57:26] time, Lord? Lord, and we just thank you,
[57:29] Lord Jesus, that we don't just have to
[57:30] wait to get over there, Lord. But we've
[57:33] got an earnest already. We've got a down
[57:35] payment, Lord. And Father, we got the
[57:38] earnest of the spirit, Lord Jesus. We're
[57:40] already, God, raised from the dead.
[57:43] We're not a dead people, but we're alive
[57:45] in Christ.
[57:47] Lord, we're sitting in heavenly places
[57:49] in Christ Jesus. We thank you, Father.
[57:53] Now we ask God that you'd just be with
[57:54] us Lord Jesus as we try to do what you
[57:57] have ordained God for us to do Lord and
[58:00] that is that by the foolishness of
[58:03] preaching save those that believe Lord
[58:06] we've gathered according to your word
[58:08] not forsaking the assembling of
[58:09] ourselves together Lord but we've
[58:12] gathered as you have told us to Lord
[58:14] Jesus Father we welcome you now to come
[58:17] and to be the speaker help me to get out
[58:19] of the way Lord and that you'll father
[58:21] just use the gift to speak to your
[58:23] people. May the spirit speak what he
[58:25] wants to say to the church this morning.
[58:28] We ask it in Jesus' name. And everybody
[58:30] said,
[58:31] &gt;&gt; "Amen." Once again, brother, no fear.
[58:33] Amen. So, hey, that old devil's dead.
[58:36] Amen. Give the Lord a hand. Say, "Thank
[58:37] you, Lord Jesus."
[58:40] Amen.
[58:44] Amen. If you will open your Bibles,
[58:46] we'll just get into the word. Amen. Time
[58:48] flies so fast, so we'll just at least
[58:51] hurry and get started. Amen.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:56] Amen.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. There was a saying I think brother
[58:59] Ted Pedley used to say something about
[59:01] he says that old Indian out west and the
[59:04] cowboy and and that Indian said you know
[59:07] that train that big old mogul Indian
[59:09] said never get him started. Never get
[59:11] him started. Never get him started.
[59:13] White guy says oh yeah oh yeah it's
[59:15] going to get going. It's going to get
[59:17] going. No never get him started. All of
[59:19] a sudden, that old whistle blew and that
[59:21] steam flew up and them old engines begin
[59:23] to go get going down the tracks and the
[59:26] engine says, "Never get him stopped.
[59:28] Never get him stopped. Never get him
[59:30] stopped." Amen. So, we'll try to get
[59:33] stopped. Amen. Amen. God bless you this
[59:36] morning and we love y'all. Amen. Love,
[59:38] Brother Ron. Love your group here. Amen.
[59:40] Greet the folks back home. Amen. We're
[59:42] so thankful for them. And we want to
[59:43] thank everybody. I didn't get to last
[59:45] night, but you know, I truly believe it
[59:48] was the faith of my wife and the faith
[59:50] of the believers. And I thank brother
[59:52] Ron and for uh uh Andrew and all of
[59:56] y'all for your prayers for my wife.
[59:57] Amen.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; And we're continuing to pray for brother
[1:00:00] Ron. How many we always lift him up in
[1:00:02] our prayers. And we're Amen. We're going
[1:00:04] to chop some more heads off. Ain't that
[1:00:06] right?
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; And we're going to drive the enemy plum
[1:00:09] out of the land. Amen.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you glad to be free?
[1:00:14] Amen.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; How many's free this morning? Amen.
[1:00:16] Thank God I am free. Free. Free.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. All right, let's
[1:00:22] get started. Turn your Bibles if you
[1:00:23] will to 1 Coronicles. Amen. 1
[1:00:26] Coronicles, if you will.
[1:00:29] Amen. And we want to try to uh maybe go
[1:00:33] just a little bit of a different
[1:00:34] direction. Like I said, we just try to
[1:00:36] follow the leading of the spirit. When
[1:00:38] you've got five pages or so, you just
[1:00:40] ask the Lord to say what he wants said
[1:00:42] and zip the lip to what he don't want
[1:00:44] said. Amen.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; I mean, know he knows just what you have
[1:00:47] need of.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Even brother Bam says sometimes he'll go
[1:00:50] down this little rabbit trail or down to
[1:00:52] other places and he says and it'll be
[1:00:54] just for somebody. Amen. You don't know
[1:00:56] just why you do it, but God knows what
[1:00:59] he's doing.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; I I want to say I truly believe that
[1:01:03] this right here is what God has
[1:01:05] ordained. That's right.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; How many believes that it is ordained of
[1:01:08] God to have church? It's ordained of God
[1:01:11] to have a five-fold ministry. It's
[1:01:13] ordained of God to minister the word and
[1:01:15] for people like me and the ministers to
[1:01:17] get out of the way and let the spirit
[1:01:20] speak to the church what he once said.
[1:01:22] Amen. And if it's the Holy Spirit
[1:01:24] speaking, folks, how many knows? Amen.
[1:01:26] He'll go out there.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; He'll come out there and he'll drop
[1:01:29] down. He'll drop that word down. Amen.
[1:01:32] And if you have need of need of healing,
[1:01:34] if you have need of salvation this
[1:01:36] morning,
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; oh, hallelujah.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. He can make it real to you. That's
[1:01:40] right.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; You pray for revelation more than
[1:01:42] anything else.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not going to get to read the
[1:01:46] word if I don't quit. Amen. All right.
[1:01:48] Praise the Lord. That's okay. Now, 1
[1:01:51] Coronicles 16 and verse 23 will begin
[1:01:54] with. Sing unto the Lord, all the earth.
[1:01:58] Show forth uh show forth from day to day
[1:02:03] his salvation. How many believes that?
[1:02:06] That's what we like to do. We like to
[1:02:08] talk about his salvation.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Declare his glory among the
[1:02:14] heathen, his marvelous works among all
[1:02:19] nations. For great is the Lord and
[1:02:24] little to be praised. No. Greatly to be
[1:02:28] praised.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He also is to be feared
[1:02:33] above all gods.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many knows there's many gods?
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Many gods,
[1:02:44] but one true God.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:48] Amen.
[1:02:50] So he says, "For all the gods of the
[1:02:53] people are idols, but the Lord make the
[1:02:56] heavens. Glory and honor are in his
[1:02:59] presence. Strength and gladness are in
[1:03:03] his place. It's no wonder we get happy."
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; No wonder we get glad.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Give unto the Lord, ye kindreds of
[1:03:11] the people. Give unto the Lord glory and
[1:03:15] strength.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:03:20] And we want to get into some of that.
[1:03:22] Amen. Because you you think, well, the
[1:03:24] Lord needs strength.
[1:03:27] Amen. The Lord needs blessing.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sure. Because he is the God of
[1:03:32] blessing.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; So we bless the Lord, all my soul, and
[1:03:36] all that is within me. Amen.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Now, here we want to get to our title.
[1:03:41] Give unto the Lord glory due unto his
[1:03:44] name.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So my title is giving the Lord
[1:03:48] glory that's due him. Amen.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Bring an offering and come before him.
[1:03:53] Worship him in the beauty of holiness.
[1:03:56] God bless you. You can have your seats
[1:03:58] this this morning. It is still morning I
[1:04:01] guess. Amen.
[1:04:04] Praise the Lord. I love that song, that
[1:04:07] last song. Amen. that brother Andrew
[1:04:10] sang because uh I want to just read that
[1:04:14] scripture and I heard as it were
[1:04:16] Revelations 19 and6 and I heard as it
[1:04:18] were the voice of a great multitude and
[1:04:20] as the voice of many waters and as the
[1:04:23] voice of mighty thunderings
[1:04:26] saying hallelujah
[1:04:29] the for the Lord God omnipotent reignth.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. I want to read a
[1:04:36] couple more scriptures just trying to
[1:04:38] final lay a foundation. Amen. I'm not
[1:04:40] really here to teach. Amen. I want to
[1:04:43] just try to with the help of the Lord
[1:04:44] just to preach. Amen. Amen. Just to
[1:04:47] preach and see what the Lord will have
[1:04:49] for us, but certainly preach his word.
[1:04:52] In Revelations the fourth chapter, if
[1:04:54] you want to go there, you can. Amen.
[1:04:57] Verse 7 it says, "And the first beast
[1:04:59] was like unto a lion. The second beast
[1:05:02] like unto a calf, the third beast like
[1:05:05] unto the face of a man, and the fourth
[1:05:07] beast like a flying eagle."
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, for those of you who
[1:05:11] understand what that was, that was the
[1:05:13] four powers of God that God Amen. led
[1:05:17] out, Amen. through the last 2,000 years.
[1:05:20] Is that right?
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was uh all these different
[1:05:23] powers and and and that he uh anointed
[1:05:26] his church with, his people with. And
[1:05:28] the last one, of course, was the flying
[1:05:30] eagle, which we love. Amen.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; The flying eagle. Amen. That's the eagle
[1:05:34] age. How many believe it's the eagle
[1:05:36] age?
[1:05:37] And the four beasts had each of them six
[1:05:39] wings about them, and they were full of
[1:05:41] eyes within. And they rest not day and
[1:05:43] night, saying, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord
[1:05:46] God Almighty, which was and which is and
[1:05:49] which is to come."
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when those beasts give glory
[1:05:55] and honor and thanks,
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; how many believe that? And that's what I
[1:06:00] really want to focus on. Amen. Is giving
[1:06:03] God his due. Amen.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; GIVE God the glory that's due him.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; GIVE HIM THE PRAISE. That's due him.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; How many believe that he IS WORTHY
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; OF A LOT OF PRAISE?
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; He's worthy of a lot of glory.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; MAN GLORIFIES SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Let me read the rest of my scriptures
[1:06:33] before we get started.
[1:06:35] But if you notice those beasts, those
[1:06:37] powers, they give honor.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; How many knows? That's why we come to
[1:06:42] church. We honor God.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; We honor God by coming to his house. And
[1:06:47] Amen. And the things that we do and the
[1:06:49] way that we dress and the way that we
[1:06:50] talk and the way we live. We want to
[1:06:52] live to honor. Let my life honor God.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who liveth forever and ever. And
[1:06:58] the four uh bel I read that already. No.
[1:07:02] Verse 10 says, "And the four and 20
[1:07:04] elders fall down before him that sat
[1:07:06] upon the throne and worship him that
[1:07:07] liveth forever and ever and cast their
[1:07:09] crowns before the throne, saying, Thou
[1:07:13] art worthy."
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Thou art worthy, O Lord.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. To receive glory and honor and
[1:07:21] power, for thou hast created all things,
[1:07:24] and for thy pleasure they were and are
[1:07:29] created.
[1:07:30] Now notice after the fifth chapter after
[1:07:33] he takes the book he was found worthy to
[1:07:36] take the book and to open the book what
[1:07:38] happens after the opening of the seals
[1:07:40] as we might say. Amen. They begin to
[1:07:43] sing a new song and and it verse says in
[1:07:45] chapter 5 11 and I beheld and another
[1:07:48] and I heard of the voice of many angels
[1:07:52] round about the throne and the beast and
[1:07:53] the elders and the number of them was
[1:07:55] 10,000 times 10 thousands and thousands
[1:07:57] of thousands
[1:07:59] saying with a loud voice,
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Don't you think it's time to just get a
[1:08:07] little louder?
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:08:10] Come on. GET A LITTLE LOUDER.
[1:08:14] HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam taught us that IF YOU WAS TO
[1:08:18] DIE in your seat right now,
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. IT WOULDN'T CHANGE YOUR CHARACTER
[1:08:24] one bit.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; IT WOULDN'T CHANGE HOW YOU ARE.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And brother Ben, IN ONE PLACE HE
[1:08:31] SAYS, YOU KNOW, IF GOD WAS TO CAST ME
[1:08:33] OFF IN the end, Amen. Because he he he
[1:08:36] says it many times. HE SAYS, I'D
[1:08:38] CERTAINLY BE WORTHY of him casting me
[1:08:40] off. How many feels that way? SURE,
[1:08:42] WE'RE NOT PERFECT. WE'VE MADE OUR
[1:08:43] MISTAKES AND AND SO FORTH, AND I'M BE
[1:08:46] WORTHY TO CAST ME INTO HELL. BUT HE
[1:08:48] SAYS, HE SAYS, "IF I WOULD FEEL, BUT IF
[1:08:50] I WOULD FEEL LIKE I FEEL NOW, I would
[1:08:53] love him in hell."
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. That's what he say.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVES THAT'S THE WAY IT
[1:08:58] OUGHT TO BE ON THE INSIDE of the inside?
[1:09:01] YOU'RE LIKELY NOT TO GET CAST OUT IF
[1:09:03] YOU'VE GOT THAT KIND OF LOVE for God.
[1:09:05] AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT, BROTHER
[1:09:06] AND SISTERS? I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, IF
[1:09:08] THAT'S THE SAME APPLIES, AMEN. FOR MY
[1:09:10] HEART AND FOR YOUR HEART. AMEN. I'M HERE
[1:09:12] TO TELL YOU IF I FEEL LIKE I FEEL RIGHT
[1:09:14] NOW IF I DROP DEAD. AMEN. HE CAST ME
[1:09:16] OFF. I'M GOING TO BE SAYING, "PRAISE THE
[1:09:18] LORD."
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; NOW, EVERYBODY ELSE IN HELL IS GOING TO
[1:09:22] BE UNCOMFORTABLE CUZ I'M GOING TO BE
[1:09:24] PRAISING GOD.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Which better did say, "If
[1:09:33] there was such a thing as love in hell,
[1:09:34] you know." Amen. If there's SUCH A THING
[1:09:37] AS PRAISING GOD IN HELL. And if I feel
[1:09:39] LIKE I DO NOW, I would give him glory.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; I WOULD GIVE HIM PRAISE. WE WOULD HAVE A
[1:09:44] HALLELUJAH CORNER IN HELL.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; You ain't never heard that before, have
[1:09:50] you? I ain't never said that before.
[1:09:57] Oh my. But I was just off of brother
[1:10:00] Brandon how he felt. If he felt that
[1:10:02] way.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so how many believe that's the
[1:10:05] way we need to feel? We need to have THE
[1:10:07] LOVE OF GOD IN OUR HEARTS. WE LOVE HIM
[1:10:10] MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. HE IS MORE DEAR
[1:10:12] TO US THAN OUR VERY BREATH. HE'S MORE
[1:10:15] SWEETER TO US THAN OUR VERY LIFE. HE'S
[1:10:18] MORE THAN LIFE TO ME. HE'S EVERYTHING.
[1:10:21] HE'S EVERYTHING. HE'S MY FATHER. HE'S MY
[1:10:23] MOTHER. HE'S MY BROTHER. HE'S
[1:10:25] EVERYTHING. AND HE IS WORTHY of my
[1:10:28] praise.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; What are we going to do, brother Angel?
[1:10:33] What are we going TO DO WHEN IT'S ALL
[1:10:35] OVER WITH? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE
[1:10:36] GOING TO DO. WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS
[1:10:38] RIGHT HERE. THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOUD
[1:10:40] VOICE SAYING, "GLORY AND HONOR AND POWER
[1:10:43] AND STRENGTH BE TO THE LAMB CUZ HE'S THE
[1:10:47] ONE THAT'S WORTHY." THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
[1:10:49] GOING TO DO.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO PRAISE HIM THROUGH THE
[1:10:52] EONS OF TIME. IT AIN'T GOING TO BE LIKE
[1:10:54] THE DEVIL AND GET BORED. I'M NOT GOING
[1:10:56] TO GET BORED IN HEAVEN.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; I'm not GOING TO GET TIRED OF GOING TO
[1:11:01] CHURCH. COME ON.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; CHURCH AIN'T GOING TO BE BORING FOR ME.

[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO PRAISE GOD AND KEEP
[1:11:09] PRAISING GOD.

[1:11:45] your life to Almighty God, getting
[1:11:47] filled with the Holy Spirit. He Let me
[1:11:51] TELL YOU SOMETHING. AMEN. YOU JUST DON'T
[1:11:53] COME TO GOD ON YOUR OWN.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; YOU JUST DON'T HAVE A DESIRE TO GET
[1:11:57] BAPTIZED ON YOUR OWN. AMEN. AMEN. NO MAN
[1:12:00] COMES TO ME EXCEPT MY FATHER. DRAW HIM.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; I HOPE YOU FEEL THAT DRAWING. I HAVEN'T
[1:12:05] DRAWN. HE'S DRAWING ME.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; HE'S CALLING ME.

[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Any napkins or anything?
[1:12:17] Amen.
[1:12:20] Give you a revelation of himself. Is
[1:12:23] that right? I looked at this scripture.
[1:12:27] Oh, and it just blessed my soul to think
[1:12:30] the one thing they say is worthy is the
[1:12:34] lamb
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; that was slain.
[1:12:38] Amen.
[1:12:40] To receive power.
[1:12:43] Oh my.
[1:12:45] How many knows that we were WITHOUT
[1:12:48] STRENGTH?
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; STRENGTH.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; WITHOUT POWER.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; In sin, dead.
[1:12:54] But what DID GOD DO? HE COME AND HE
[1:12:56] TALKED TO US. HE SPOKE TO OUR HEARTS. HE
[1:12:58] LIFTED US UP.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT DID HE DO? HE BAPTIZED US WITH
[1:13:02] THE HOLY GHOST. HE SAID, "YOU SHALL
[1:13:04] RECEIVE POWER AFTER THE HOLY GHOST HAS
[1:13:07] COME UPON YOU."
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. TO BECOME SONS OF GOD. HOW MANY
[1:13:10] BELIEVE IT TAKES THE POWER OF GOD TO
[1:13:12] TRANSFORM YOUR NATURE AND YOUR DESIRES.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. He does.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; And he does that.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:13:28] Let's stop,
[1:13:30] rewind a little bit. I like to go back.
[1:13:35] Amen.
[1:13:36] And think about what God has done. Amen.
[1:13:40] Now, how many knows that?
[1:13:45] When God gives something, Amen. such as
[1:13:49] salvation or a pardon, is that right?
[1:13:53] People are responsible.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Young people.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; You just didn't come here by accident.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; You didn't just happen to be here. There
[1:14:05] could have been another million that was
[1:14:07] born, but you were born. God chose you
[1:14:10] to be here.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; How many believes that?
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; God chose me to be here.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; But we as human beings, being a human
[1:14:18] comes with responsibility.
[1:14:21] That's right.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; It comes with accountability.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; And every sin
[1:14:28] from Cain, isn't that right?
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Adam and Eve,
[1:14:33] every sin from the first sin to the very
[1:14:37] last sin must be paid for.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; IT MUST BE ACCOUNTED FOR.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; GOD KEEPS RECORD. THAT'S
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; GOD PUSHED THAT RECORD PLAYER WHEN YOU
[1:14:48] WERE BORN. AIN'T THAT RIGHT? AND EVERY
[1:14:50] THOUGHT THAT GOES THROUGH YOUR MIND,
[1:14:52] EVERYTHING YOU EVER DO, WHATEVER CLOTHES
[1:14:53] YOU OWE, IT'S ALL RECORDED.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; And someday on that day, it'll be played
[1:14:59] back.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you COME TO THE AGE OF
[1:15:02] ACCOUNTABILITY AND BEGIN TO AMEN, STEAL
[1:15:04] A LITTLE THIS OR STEAL A LITTLE THAT OR
[1:15:06] TELL A MOM, "NO, I DIDN'T DO IT. JUNIOR
[1:15:08] did it." Or some AND EVERY LITTLE THING
[1:15:10] and then it BEGINS TO ADD UP and guilt
[1:15:13] and AND SIN BRINGS GUILT UPON YOURSELF.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND IT CAUSES YOUR CONSCIENCE TO
[1:15:19] CONDEMN YOURSELF. PEOPLE BECOME
[1:15:21] MISERABLE THAT WAY. I MEAN KNOW IT'S
[1:15:23] MISERABLE TO HAVE SIN IN YOUR LIFE. IT'S
[1:15:25] MISERABLE TO BACKSLIDE ON GOD.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; AIN'T THAT RIGHT? I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
[1:15:31] YOU, BUT I'VE DONE IT A TIME OR TWO.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; I ain't got no wings.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Hello. I'VE DONE A TIME. YOU HAVE A TIME
[1:15:38] OR TWO. AND I THANK GOD FOR HIS MERCY
[1:15:40] AND HIS GRACE.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT YOU BECOME MISERABLE WHEN YOU
[1:15:46] BECOME BACKSLID. AMEN. YOU JUST GET A
[1:15:48] LITTLE LUKEWARM AND SEE HOW MISERABLE
[1:15:49] YOU ARE.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; There's no SENSE IN BEING MISERABLE.
[1:15:53] THERE'S NO SENSE IN BACKSLIDING. THAT'S
[1:15:55] WHY I TRIED TO CONVEY THAT ABOUT THE
[1:15:56] HOLIES OF HOLIES. AMEN. I BELIEVE THAT'S
[1:15:58] WHERE WE NEED TO GET INTO IT. THAT INNER
[1:16:00] CHAMBER, THAT WALK WITH GOD RIGHT IN THE
[1:16:03] PRESENCE OF GOD THAT you can live with
[1:16:05] him.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN WORSHIP HIM YESTERDAY LIKE WE
[1:16:10] DID LAST NIGHT. BUT THAT WAS YESTERDAY.
[1:16:12] WE CAN WORSHIP AGAIN TODAY. WE CAN
[1:16:15] PRAISE HIM AGAIN TODAY. AND IF A
[1:16:17] TOMORROW COMES, WE'LL WORSHIP IT. WE'LL
[1:16:19] PRAISE HIM AGAIN TOMORROW.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; OH, PEOPLE THINK WE WORSHIP A BUNCH AND
[1:16:25] BECOME A LITTLE FANATICAL IN 25. WAIT
[1:16:28] TILL 26. BUT you're ready. WE'RE GOING
[1:16:30] TO SHOW HIM. HEY, I DON'T KNOW. HOW
[1:16:32] ABOUT YOU? BUT I CAME TO PRAISE THE
[1:16:34] LORD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CAME TO DO,
[1:16:36] BUT I CAME TO WORSHIP. I'M GLAD THAT
[1:16:39] WHAT YOU'RE DOING, IT ISN'T JUST
[1:16:41] SOMETHING IMAGINARY. YOU'RE WORSHIPING
[1:16:43] GOD. THIS MORNING,
[1:16:45] WE'RE RAISING OUR HANDS TO GOD AND
[1:16:47] SAYING, "THANK YOU, LORD. IT'S REAL,
[1:16:50] PEOPLE.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Salvation is real."
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Why am I so excited? Why am I so happy?
[1:17:01] I'll tell you why.
[1:17:04] Cuz how many knows this whole world,
[1:17:07] everything that's happened has been the
[1:17:08] plan of God?
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; It's been his plan,
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; right? And we serve a very, very
[1:17:14] merciful God.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:17:19] We know we have to give account.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; You got to give an account.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Everybody got to give an account for
[1:17:26] what you've done.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Revelations there. The white throne
[1:17:32] judgment, the dead, the sea, hell,
[1:17:34] death, the grave, everything
[1:17:37] called everybody up. And the books were
[1:17:40] opened, and every man was judged
[1:17:43] according to his deeds.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; And Jesus knew this. God knew this.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; But what did he do?
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Isn't he sweet?
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; That he made a way out of it.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; He made a way out.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he set up church.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; HE SET UP THE HOUSE OF GOD.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; He set up the house of God.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus when he came, he meant he
[1:18:20] conquered every devil.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; HE CONQUERED EVERY TEMPTATION.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN. He went Amen. AND CONQUERED
[1:18:27] HIMSELF.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; WENT TO CALVARY. AMEN. AND DIED THE MOST
[1:18:31] HORRIBLE DEATH THAT COULD BE could be uh
[1:18:34] dealt to him. Ain't that right? in
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; the most horrible way.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Went to the REGIONS OF THE LOST,
[1:18:40] GRABBED THE KEYS OUT OF THE DEVIL'S
[1:18:43] SIDE, SO TO SPEAK, JUST HAVING CONQUERED
[1:18:45] IT ALL. KICK THE GATES DOWN, GRAB THE
[1:18:48] KEYS, COME BACK UP, ASCENDED ON HIGH.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN. He says he ascended on high AND
[1:18:54] LET CAPTIVITY CAPTIVE.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HOW MANY BELIEVES IN THIS
[1:18:59] MORNING YOUR CAPTIVITY,
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; YOUR SORROW, YOUR FEAR, YOUR ANXIETY,
[1:19:06] ALL OF THOSE. AMEN. DON'T LET THEM BRING
[1:19:08] YOU CAPTIVE. YOU BRING IT CAPTIVE.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; GET IT UNDER YOUR FEET.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; GET DEPRESSION UNDER YOUR FEET.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; HE LET CAPTIVITY CAPTIVE AND HE GAVE
[1:19:19] GIFTS TO MAN. WHAT WERE THOSE GIFTS?
[1:19:22] APOSTLES, PROPHETS, PASTORS, TEACHERS.
[1:19:25] FOR WHAT? FOR THE PERFECTING OF THE
[1:19:27] SAINTS UNTIL WE ALL COME TO THE FULL
[1:19:29] STATURE OF CHRIST. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
[1:19:31] HERE FOR. AMEN. IS TO CONVEY TO YOU THE
[1:19:34] GRACE OF ALMIGHTY GOD.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN. TO TELL YOU THE GRACE, THE PLAN OF
[1:19:38] SALVATION.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; The plan of salvation.
[1:19:42] Amen.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; That by the foolishness of preaching
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; to save them that are lost.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; I love the thought that hey, even this
[1:19:50] morning as the go word goes forth,
[1:19:52] somebody can get saved.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; That's right. become an eternal creature
[1:19:57] that'll live through the ceaseless ages
[1:19:59] to come. Now, I don't know about you,
[1:20:01] but I would rather be right here than at
[1:20:02] a racetrack.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Or at a ball game.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Or anything anywhere else in the world.
[1:20:07] I'd rather be right here
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; cuz greater things can happen right here
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; than anywhere else.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just by the pure word of God going
[1:20:16] forth. That's
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; He was so merciful. Amen. When he knew
[1:20:20] that there would be certain ones that
[1:20:21] would accept it. How many knows that he
[1:20:24] didn't die for haphazard read? He knew
[1:20:25] who would accept and who would and HE
[1:20:27] DIDN'T GO HE DIDN'T GO TO CALVARY ON
[1:20:29] JUST SOME WELL I HOPE SOMEBODY HAS PITY
[1:20:31] ON ME.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN. But he knew somebody would want
[1:20:35] it.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; WHOSOEVER WILL. AMEN. HE SAYS I'LL TELL
[1:20:39] YOU WHAT I'LL DO WHILE I'M SIGNING THIS
[1:20:41] PARDON.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'm glad this house of God HERE A
[1:20:44] MINUTE AGO I WAS TALKING ABOUT GOD
[1:20:46] CREATED THE HOUSE OF GOD. AMEN. AND
[1:20:48] PETER SAID JUDGMENT.
[1:20:52] JUDGMENT FOR OUR SINS. WE'VE COME TO
[1:20:54] JUDGMENT THIS MORNING.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. When the PREACHER CONDEMNS YOU FOR
[1:20:57] THIS OR this condemns YOU FOR THAT,
[1:20:59] THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE HERE FOR. IF THE WORD
[1:21:01] CONDEMNS, SAY, "GOD, FORGIVE ME." CUZ
[1:21:03] I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT IN THIS HOUSE
[1:21:06] OF JUDGMENT, THERE'S MERCY.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; THERE'S GRACE IN THIS HOUSE OF JUDGMENT.
[1:21:11] AMEN. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, YOU CAN
[1:21:13] TAKE THOSE SINS OF YOUR PAST. AMEN.
[1:21:16] BECAUSE GET IT TO WHERE THERE'S NOW NO
[1:21:18] CONDEMNATION. THERE'S NO JUDGMENT THAT
[1:21:21] UNDER THEM THAT ARE IN Christ Jesus, WHO
[1:21:23] WALK NOT AFTER THE FLESH, but after the
[1:21:26] spirit.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that this morning?
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:37] Judgment must begin at the house of God.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; You got to deal with your sin.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why do you think people want to
[1:21:48] take their lives
[1:21:50] Why? Because a life outside of Christ is
[1:21:52] miserable.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; A life with a guilty conscience is
[1:21:55] miserable.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; You know, I had in my notes here, I
[1:21:58] says, you know, we need to have
[1:21:59] compassion for those folks out there
[1:22:01] that have blue hair
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; with all those rings in them.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; All these, you know, hideous looking
[1:22:07] people, men walking around with
[1:22:09] fingernail polish on
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; and all these things that they walk
[1:22:13] around. Amen. You know, brother Bam
[1:22:15] talked about when he was in in his day,
[1:22:17] he says, "Why does women run around on
[1:22:18] their husbands? Why do people go out to
[1:22:20] these clubs and why do they all go out
[1:22:22] there and do all of that?" HE SAYS,
[1:22:23] "BECAUSE GOD PUT A THIRST IN THEM.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; He put a thirst in them for
[1:22:27] satisfaction.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; They don't realize that that thirst can
[1:22:31] ONLY BE QUENCHED BY THE HOLY GHOST."
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, IN OUR
[1:22:35] GENERATION, those kids out there, THOSE
[1:22:37] PEOPLE THAT ARE IN DARKNESS, AMEN,
[1:22:39] THEY'RE THIRSTING FOR SOMETHING. THAT'S
[1:22:41] WHY THEY COLOR THEIR HAIR. THAT'S WHY
[1:22:42] THEY PUT TATTOOS ON THEM. THEY'RE
[1:22:44] THIRSTING FOR SOMETHING. BUT PRAISE BE
[1:22:46] TO GOD, THERE'S A PLACE THAT THEY CAN
[1:22:48] COME AND GET SATISFIED.
[1:22:53] HALLELUJAH.
[1:22:54] HOW MANY THIS MORNING SAY, "I'M
[1:22:56] SATISFIED. I COME TO CHRIST AND I'M
[1:22:58] SATISFIED. I DRINK FROM THE WELL SPRINGS
[1:23:01] OF WELLS." AMEN. I'LL GIVE YOU WATER
[1:23:02] THAT YOU'LL NEVER THIRST AGAIN. AMEN.
[1:23:05] ANOTHER TATTOO WILL NEVER QUENCH YOUR
[1:23:06] THIRST. ANOTHER BLUE HAIR WON'T QUENCH
[1:23:08] YOUR THIRST. BUT GETTING ON YOUR KNEES.
[1:23:11] WOULD YOU SAY, "GOD, I WANT TO DRINK
[1:23:13] FROM YOUR FOUNTAIN. GOD, COME AND FILL
[1:23:15] THAT VOID THAT'S IN MY HEART.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; LET ME GET BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF JESUS
[1:23:20] CHRIST. FILL ME WITH THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:23:23] I'LL NEVER HAVE TO DO DRUGS AGAIN. I'LL
[1:23:25] NEVER HAVE TO DO ANY OF THAT TO FEEL
[1:23:27] GOOD."
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I GOT THIS DRINK 20
[1:23:35] YEARS AGO. I'M STILL BROKE.
[1:23:39] I STILL FEEL GOOD.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; THIS THIS DRUG DON'T WEAR OFF.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; AREN'T YOU GLAD THAT IT DON'T WEAR OFF?
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; IT LASTS AND IT'S GOING TO LAST 10,000
[1:23:52] YEARS.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; WE'LL JUST BE STARTED.
[1:23:57] YOU AIN'T NEVER HEARD THE KIND OF
[1:23:58] PRAISE,
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; THE KIND OF GLORY, THE KIND OF SHOUTING,
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; THE RUNNING, THE SCREAMING, AND THE
[1:24:07] HOLLERING,
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; LOUD VOICING. HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:31] He's worthy of glory.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; He's worthy of honor.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; He's worthy of praise.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; These bodybuilders,
[1:24:42] they'll build their bodies and become
[1:24:43] Hercules. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Look at
[1:24:46] him today.
[1:24:49] great, big, strong. Amen. You and I, we
[1:24:54] enjoy our youth.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; But as we get older, we begin to lose
[1:24:58] that strength.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they glorify these big BUILD
[1:25:03] BODYBUILDERS. THEY GLORIFY THAT
[1:25:05] STRENGTH. THEY DON'T REALIZE THEY
[1:25:07] WOULDN'T HAVE NONE OF IT IF IT WASN'T
[1:25:08] FOR THE ONE THAT DESERVES TO BE GIVEN
[1:25:10] STRENGTH.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN. GIVE HONOR AND GLORY TO.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; They'll go to car races to the Indies
[1:25:17] and THEY'LL GO 180 MPH. AMEN. THEY'LL
[1:25:20] WATCH THEM ZOOM BY. WATCH THEM ZOOM BY.
[1:25:22] AMEN. And there's one will GET IN THE
[1:25:24] FRONT. AMEN. AS HE COMES DOWN PERHAPS,
[1:25:26] AMEN. TO THE FINISH LINE, CROSSES THAT.
[1:25:28] AND WHOEVER THEY'RE ROOTING FOR, YOU
[1:25:30] AIN'T NEVER SEEN HOW EXCITED THEY GET.
[1:25:34] YEAH. D. OH YEAH. SCREAM, HOLLER.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; AIN'T THAT RIGHT? BROTHER BAM SAYS WE
[1:25:40] OUGHT TO BE JUST EXUBERANT ABOUT THE
[1:25:41] THINGS OF GOD AND AMEN. AS THE WORLD IS
[1:25:45] THAT DELIGHTS IN HIS PLEASURES.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; TELL ME ABOUT THE POWER OF GOD THAT CAN
[1:25:56] TAKE AWAY MY ZEN ZOOM. HALLELUJAH.
[1:25:59] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. HALLELUJAH. POWER. THAT'S
[1:26:05] WHAT I'M COVERING. HE'S WORTHY OF POWER.
[1:26:09] GLORY, HONOR, STRENGTH.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; That's right. We ought to just be as
[1:26:28] exubant in the things of God as the
[1:26:30] world is
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; in their things.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; How many believe we ought to be just a
[1:26:36] little more
[1:26:38] Just a little more.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; You let your favorite team, your
[1:26:43] football team.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. You let that quarterback and you
[1:26:47] let that running back favorite running
[1:26:48] back. Amen.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Back in my my day, back in my day, back
[1:26:53] when I watched a little football. I
[1:26:55] don't anymore and hardly keep up with
[1:26:57] it. But it was Danny Marino and Mark
[1:27:00] Clayton. And Danny Marino, I really
[1:27:02] liked him. He could throw a pass now. He
[1:27:04] could throw a pass. And them little
[1:27:06] scrawy 180 lb Mark Duper, Mike Clayton,
[1:27:09] they could run and they COULD JIG OFF,
[1:27:12] DIG OFF. AND THEN DANNY MARIA PUT RIGHT
[1:27:15] IN THERE.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; HELLO. NOW, I'm telling you now, when
[1:27:21] they do that, when they run into the end
[1:27:23] zone and they jump up and tip that ball
[1:27:26] with the finger, come down AS THEY'RE
[1:27:28] FALLING AND GRAB IT. THEY COME UP AND
[1:27:31] THEY GO SPIKE THAT BALL, DO A LITTLE
[1:27:34] JIG.
[1:27:36] HELLO.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, BUT WHEN BROTHER
[1:27:39] TIM PUIT, AMEN. DWAYNE LAWSON WAS here
[1:27:42] in them meeting,
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; I'm here to TELL YOU, IT WAS ONE
[1:27:45] TOUCHDOWN AFTER ANOTHER,
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; AND WE'D GO, "THAT'S RIGHT. PREACH IT,
[1:27:48] BROTHER. PREACH IT. THAT'S THE TRUTH."
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:12] I remember a few years ago, I think it
[1:28:15] was the Super Bowl, the Tennessee
[1:28:17] Titans, I believe it was,
[1:28:20] if I'm not wrong, my memory might
[1:28:22] forget, but it was a team and it was the
[1:28:25] last 30 seconds. It was the last 30
[1:28:29] seconds of the whole game. It was pretty
[1:28:32] much tied up or they needed a touchdown
[1:28:34] to win and it was the last play. Just a
[1:28:37] few seconds. Hello.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, he handed IT OFF
[1:28:42] TO THAT ONE THAT uh
[1:28:46] what do you call you? Hand it to your
[1:28:47] running back. Running back. Thank you.
[1:28:50] I'm a very good football man. Ain't
[1:28:53] handed it off. He ran over to the left
[1:28:56] AND WENT FOR THE TOUCHDOWN AND EVERYBODY
[1:28:58] WAS OFF THEIR SEATS. YEAH. COME ON. AND
[1:29:01] HE COME DOWN AND SOMEBODY TACKLED HIM.
[1:29:04] BOOM.
[1:29:06] And then the goal line was over there.
[1:29:10] HE WAS A YARD SHORT.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; YOU WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.
[1:29:15] HOW MANY KNOWS HE THAT HAS BEGUN A GOOD
[1:29:17] WORK IN YOU IS ABLE TO PERFORM IT.
[1:29:20] YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO HAVE TO BE
[1:29:21] DISAPPOINTED.
[1:29:23] THERE'S NO DISAPPOINTMENT FOR US. WE'RE
[1:29:26] GOING TO WIN.
[1:29:31] WE ARE WINNERS. IT'S ALREADY IN THE
[1:29:34] BOOK.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; That's right. Boom. SPIKE THAT BOMB.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; YEAH, that's what I'm talking about.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; God is worthy more glory
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; than a football,
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; a pitchkin.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; They have that much fun.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. because of the strength that God
[1:29:59] gave them.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; And God, Isn't it nice sometimes when
[1:30:01] you hear a football player or one of
[1:30:04] them players say, "I just want to give
[1:30:05] God thanks."
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Isn't it nice when somebody just gives
[1:30:08] God a little bit of glory
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; cuz he's given them strength.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; He's given them the ability to do that.
[1:30:13] Amen. Because every one of us knows, I
[1:30:15] don't know about you, but aren't you
[1:30:17] glad you are not running having to go
[1:30:18] SIT IN A WHEELCHAIR GETTING AROUND the
[1:30:20] morning.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. SO YOU SAY, "THANK YOU,
[1:30:22] LORD, THAT I CAN WALK. THANK YOU, LORD,
[1:30:24] FOR EVERY MOVEMENT I CAN MAKE. THANK
[1:30:26] YOU, LORD, FOR EVERY BREATH THAT I HAVE.
[1:30:28] I THANK HIM FOR EVERYTHING.
[1:30:31] HE IS MY BREATH. HE'S MY SUNSHINE. HE'S
[1:30:34] MY ALL IN ALL.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; He's everything. He's everything to me.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:46] Praise be to God.
[1:30:54] I don't know about you,
[1:30:57] but I just wish that the world would
[1:31:00] realize the opportunity
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; that's before him.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; The opportunity if they could just hear
[1:31:10] me as I say this that when God begin to
[1:31:13] think about pardoning his children, he
[1:31:16] didn't just pardon you.
[1:31:18] He says, "I'm going to go a little
[1:31:20] fanatical here and I'm just going to put
[1:31:22] it in here. Whosoever will."
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; WHOSOEVER WILL COME.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; HE INVITES EVERYBODY COME. THE SPIRIT OF
[1:31:29] MERCY, COME DRINK FROM THE WATERS. MY
[1:31:32] REAL HARM IS REACHED OUT.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; BOY, I'll tell you what, WE'D BE IN A
[1:31:37] millennium already. Hello. WHAT A PLACE
[1:31:40] IT WOULD BE
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; if even as brother Bam said, they
[1:31:44] embraced the gift that Solomon had of
[1:31:46] discernment
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; and THAT THEY EMBRACED THAT AND THEY HAD
[1:31:52] A GOLDEN AGE.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; A GOLDEN AGE. I've often said, man, I'm
[1:31:56] here to tell you right now, Brother
[1:31:57] Brandham should have been the president
[1:31:58] of the United States.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? He should have been
[1:32:02] the president.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; He'd have said, "No, Mr. garbage off. I
[1:32:06] know you what you're doing back there
[1:32:07] behind all those hills. I know the test
[1:32:10] that you're about to do.
[1:32:13] Ain't that right? Oh yeah. There
[1:32:15] wouldn't have been no secret. Amen. When
[1:32:18] they come and they try to beat us in
[1:32:20] North Korea or somewhere else, we'd be
[1:32:23] there already WAITING FOR HOW DID THEY
[1:32:24] KNOW WE WERE GOING TO come there?
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. THEY HAD TO SAY, "WELL, THEY'VE
[1:32:28] GOT A PROPHET IN THE LAND. THEY'VE GOT
[1:32:30] SOMEBODY THAT KNOWS WHAT YOU DO IN YOUR
[1:32:31] BED CHAMBER."
[1:32:34] HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:37] AMEN. But I want to say this. We are not
[1:32:40] like those who do not give God the
[1:32:43] glory.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; How many knows Jesus is the most
[1:32:46] rejected one?
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; He's a rejected one.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Let me just hit a couple points here.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:59] Thank you, Lord Jesus. I wore my voice
[1:33:02] out, but he re regrouped me. Amen. I
[1:33:04] think I'll be able to make it through
[1:33:05] today. So, praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:33:08] Jesus said one place he said,
[1:33:10] "Wherefore," he says, "shall I liken
[1:33:12] this generation. It is like unto the
[1:33:14] children sitting in the marketplace and
[1:33:16] calling unto their fellows, saying, we
[1:33:18] have PIPED UNTO YOU, BUT YOU HAVE NOT
[1:33:20] DANCED."
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT? GOD HAS PLAYED US
[1:33:25] SOME WONDERFUL MUSIC.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE HAS GIVEN US SOME WONDERFUL
[1:33:29] MUSIC. AMEN. THE SOUND OF THE
[1:33:31] COBBLESTONE STREET WHERE HE DRUG HIS
[1:33:33] LEFT CROSS LEFT AN OLD DRUG CROSS LEFT
[1:33:35] HIS KILL LEFT THE BLOODY STAIN.
[1:33:37] HALLELUJAH. IT WAS SWEET MUSIC TO ME. I
[1:33:40] DON'T KNOW THE WORLD MAY NOT WANT TO
[1:33:41] DANCE TO THAT BUT I'LL DANCE TO THAT
[1:33:43] MUSIC. I'LL DANCE TO THE MUSIC THAT GOD
[1:33:45] MADE. I'LL I'LL DO IT.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; The men of Nineveh shall rise in
[1:33:54] judgment with this generation and shall
[1:33:56] condemn it because they repented at the
[1:33:58] preaching of Jonas. And behold, a
[1:33:59] greater than Jonas is here.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; OH, THIS OLD AMISH BOY RIGHT HERE. HIS
[1:34:06] EX AMISH BOY, SHOULD I SAY?
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. When I THINK OF THE GRACE OF
[1:34:11] ALMIGHTY GOD.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; HELLO.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN I THINK OF WHAT GOD HAS DONE
[1:34:15] IN OUR GENERATION.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And brother Brand come along.
[1:34:19] AMEN. HE SAYS, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW WHO
[1:34:20] I'M waiting on.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was our brother. Aren't
[1:34:25] you glad he didn't make himself some
[1:34:26] great one? Amen.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Even when that lady from the south said,
[1:34:31] "Well, Reverend
[1:34:33] uh Dr. Reverend Brandham," he's in, "No,
[1:34:35] just call me brother if you love me and
[1:34:37] get your hand down here where I can
[1:34:38] shake it."
[1:34:40] He was just a brother, but he was
[1:34:42] waiting on someone to come. And he'd
[1:34:44] begin to zet
[1:34:50] would say, "Now, if this same Jesus
[1:34:52] would come again, Amen, that was here in
[1:34:54] Galilee, he would do the same things."
[1:34:56] And he said that he would. These works
[1:34:58] that I do shall you do also, and greater
[1:35:00] than these shall he do.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Bam says, "Oh, in
[1:35:07] this great hour OF DARKNESS AND CHAOS
[1:35:08] OVER THE EARTH, we should be the
[1:35:11] happiest people in the whole earth."
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHY? TO REJOICE to know WHEN
[1:35:16] PEOPLE ARE INDOCTRINATED IN ALL KINDS OF
[1:35:18] FALSE DOCTRINES.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY KNOWS ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF THIS
[1:35:22] BIBLE IS FALSE DOCTRINE? ANY MAN-MADE
[1:35:25] CREED IS DOG DOG DOGMA. IT'S NOT
[1:35:27] ACCORDING TO THE WORD.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; IT'S FALSE DOCTRINE.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOT TO BE ACCORDING to the Bible.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. All kinds of indocumentation. He
[1:35:35] says, you know, THE HINDU AND WE'RE ONLY
[1:35:37] we're the only ones that CAN SAY OUR OUR
[1:35:40] SAVIOR, OUR PROPHET HAS RISEN FROM THE
[1:35:43] DEAD AND IS ALIVE FOREVER MORE.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And he has come and HE HAS PROVEN
[1:35:48] HIMSELF ALIVE. REJOICE TO KNOW. WHY ARE
[1:35:50] WE HAPPY? BECAUSE WE ARE NOT YOU WERE
[1:35:52] NOT indoccumented in autoism. And yet t
[1:35:55] today the real living God BY HIS WORD
[1:35:58] AND BY HIS VISIBLE EVIDENCE SHOWS US
[1:36:00] THAT HE'S HERE WITH us
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; working moving LIVING ACTING JUST
[1:36:06] EXACTLY THE WAY that he always did.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; WHAT A PRIVILEGED PEOPLE WE ARE TO HAVE
[1:36:11] THIS. HOW MANY IS GLAD THAT GOD CAME IN
[1:36:14] THE WAY THAT HE DID AND SHOWING SIGNS
[1:36:16] AND WONDERS? Oh and still doing.
[1:36:20] HOW MANY KNOW HE'S STILL DOING MIRACLES,
[1:36:22] HE'S STILL DOING MIRACLES, he's still
[1:36:24] showing his signs and his wonders.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN. JUST THE FACT THAT YOU'VE GOT
[1:36:30] PRAISE LIKE YOU DO. JUST THE FACT THAT
[1:36:32] YOU'VE GOT FREEDOM LIKE YOU DO, IT'S A
[1:36:34] MIRACLE.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE YOU LOVING THE LORD IN
[1:36:37] THIS HOUR, IT'S A MIRACLE.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; YOU SERVING GOD IN THIS HOUR, IT'S A
[1:36:42] MIRACLE. IT'S GOD WORKING IN YOUR LIFE.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:36:54] You know how the Catholics, they'll read
[1:36:57] off a bunch of words in Latin or
[1:37:00] whatever, make a humming like sound or
[1:37:03] whatever.
[1:37:05] Where I come from, they're kind of like
[1:37:07] that same way. And they would say the
[1:37:09] same things over and over and over
[1:37:11] again. I was 14 years old when I left
[1:37:13] the Amish. 14 years old. And I can still
[1:37:17] remember how they preached.
[1:37:20] I don't know if y'all will relate to
[1:37:22] some of this, but they say
[1:37:42] as preaching. Amen.
[1:37:46] They'll read out of a German Bible.
[1:37:48] Amen.
[1:37:53] Let me tell you something. Brother Bam
[1:37:54] said, "Those people, they live holy."
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. But just like everybody else, it's
[1:37:59] not a reality.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many's glad that we have
[1:38:02] reality? We've got the LIVING WORD
[1:38:06] LIVING AMONG US.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS NOT TO USE VAIN
[1:38:12] REPUTITION. AMEN. WHEN YOU PRAY, DON'T
[1:38:15] USE VAIN REPETITION. LET YOUR PRAYERS
[1:38:17] COME FROM YOUR HEART
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; AND LET YOUR AMENS COME FROM YOUR HEART.
[1:38:21] LET YOUR HALLELUJAH COME FROM YOUR
[1:38:22] HEART.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; But listen, he says that men of Nineveh
[1:38:29] will rise up. THE QUEEN OF THIS HOUSE
[1:38:31] SHALL RISE UP IN JUDGMENT IN this
[1:38:32] generation and con CONDEMN IT BECAUSE
[1:38:35] SHE CAME FROM THE UTTERMOST PARTS OF THE
[1:38:36] world
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; to hear the wisdom of Solomon.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; And in this hour,
[1:38:46] America,
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Americans,
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; you can tell them of what God did in
[1:38:51] this generation through a prophet of
[1:38:53] God. how he said wait here and Jesus
[1:38:55] would come and do the same Messiah sign
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; that woman at the well when she saw that
[1:39:00] sign she said she ran into the city
[1:39:02] ISN'T THIS THE MESSIAH HE'S TOLD ME
[1:39:04] EVERYTHING I EVER DONE
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN TELL PEOPLE THAT and say well I
[1:39:08] went to that message church and I just
[1:39:10] don't have I just don't want it
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; you might not want it but you'll deal
[1:39:15] with the fact that you heard that Jesus
[1:39:17] Christ came in this hour and did the
[1:39:18] very same things and you rejected it
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; hello and you rejected did it.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have been fine before, but
[1:39:28] once you hear the truth, you don't walk
[1:39:29] away the same after that anymore.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Once you reject the truth, Amen. But how
[1:39:34] many's glad? Praise the Lord. Let me
[1:39:37] tell you another story. Amen. Jesus
[1:39:40] signed my pardon. This I surely know.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. He took my place ON CALVARY. NOW I
[1:39:48] DON'T HAVE TO GO.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; All my life I give him. He gave his for
[1:39:51] me since Jesus signed my pardon. Amen.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; How many's glad that he signed your
[1:39:57] pardon?
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember the story of that
[1:40:00] American in the in the the Civil War.
[1:40:04] Amen. That young boy that was put in
[1:40:06] prison for forsaking his post
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; and his buddy went and he went to
[1:40:10] Abraham Lincoln and got a signed paper.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; He got a signed paper said set him free.
[1:40:15] Came to that other buddy of his says, "I
[1:40:17] got a signed paper from Abraham." Amen.
[1:40:20] YOU CAN GO FREE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU
[1:40:23] DON'T NOW? YOU COME IN HERE AND MOCK ME.
[1:40:25] BUT HE didn't know his friend real well,
[1:40:27] did he? COME HERE TO MOCK ME BECAUSE I'M
[1:40:29] GOING TO DIE TOMORROW IN FRONT OF THE
[1:40:30] FIRING SQUAD. GET OUT OF HERE. NO, I'M
[1:40:33] TELLING YOU. I'M TELLING YOU. IT'S A
[1:40:35] PARDON. THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY TO
[1:40:37] THE WORLD THIS MORNING. I'M TELLING YOU.
[1:40:39] I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S A PARDON.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; TAKE THE PARDON. TAKE THE PARDON. ACCEPT
[1:40:51] THE PARDON. OR YOU WILL HAVE TO GIVE AN
[1:40:54] ANSWER ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT FOR
[1:40:55] everything
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; that you ever done.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; You'll have to accept judgment because
[1:41:01] you rejected mercy.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Isn't it something that even though
[1:41:06] doesn't matter what kind of sinful
[1:41:07] things that you have done, God paid for
[1:41:10] it. Christ paid for it on Calvary
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; and he signed your part and all you have
[1:41:15] to do is believe.
[1:41:18] Is that so hard, world? Is that so hard,
[1:41:21] people of THE EARTH?
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; GOD SAID, "IF YOU WILL BELIEVE, GO YOU
[1:41:25] INTO ALL THE WORLD AND PREACH THE
[1:41:27] GOSPEL. HE THAT BELIEVETH AND IS
[1:41:29] BAPTIZED SHALL BE SAVED."
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; You'll have to pay for all those sins.
[1:41:36] But for the one sin you'll go to hell
[1:41:37] for, just that one sin will send you to
[1:41:40] hell. He that believeth not
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; shall be damned.
[1:41:47] Simple gospel, isn't it?
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Simple gospel.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Receive what he has done. Accept it. You
[1:41:56] know, I thought about that story.
[1:42:01] Here's your pardon. Here's your pardon.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Take it with you. He said, "Take it with
[1:42:07] you." Amen.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Come here.
[1:42:12] Hold that. Let's say there's bars right
[1:42:14] here. I'm in prison. You come and you
[1:42:17] try to hand me that. So what are you
[1:42:19] talking about? That's a pardon from
[1:42:20] Abraham Lincoln.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Abraham Lincoln.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; It's yours. Take it.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Take it. I don't know. I Give me that.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Give me that. You know what I'd do next?
[1:42:40] All right. I'd go over here.
[1:42:43] Hey, Mr. Taylor.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Hey, Mr. D. Hey, Mr. Devil. Where are
[1:42:49] you?
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; I GOT A PAPER FOR YOU. GET YOURSELF OVER
[1:42:53] HERE.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; I speak with authority. I got Abraham
[1:42:58] Lincoln's name out of here. How many
[1:42:59] bleach the name of Jesus Christ? Every
[1:43:01] devil tremble. They tremble at the name
[1:43:04] of Jesus Christ.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus signed my pardon. This I surely
[1:43:09] know. He signed my pardon. Hallelujah.
[1:43:13] COME ON OVER HERE, MR. JAYLOR MAN, AND
[1:43:15] YOU OPEN THAT GATE. LET ME OUT NOW.
[1:43:19] THAT'S WHAT WE GOT TO DO. IF YOU'RE NOT
[1:43:21] FREE, YOU TELL THE DEVIL, YOU KNOW, MY
[1:43:23] SIDE HARD PARDON HAS BEEN SIGNED. YOU
[1:43:25] LET ME GO RIGHT NOW.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; EVERYONE OUT THERE, WHATEVER YOU HAVE
[1:43:30] NEED OF, SAY, GOD, IT'S MINE. DEVIL, LET
[1:43:32] IT GO.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; GIVE IT BACK TO ME. GIVE ME BACK MY
[1:43:36] FREEDOM. GIVE ME BACK MY JOY. GIVE ME
[1:43:38] BACK MY DEAD. GIVE IT BACK NOW.
[1:43:43] right now.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; I COME OUT OF THAT JAIL DANCING.
[1:43:55] They ain't going to PUT A BUNCH OF
[1:43:57] BULLETS ALL IN ME. NO WAY. NO WAY AM I
[1:44:00] GOING TO HAVE A BUNCH OF BULLETS IN ME.
[1:44:09] Come on, BROTHER. JESUS FORGAVE ALL OF
[1:44:11] YOU. YOU CAN BE FORGIVEN OF EVERY SIN
[1:44:14] RIGHT NOW.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; RAISE YOUR HAND. SAY, "GOD, FORGIVE ME."
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; You're forgiven.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; You're forgiven.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; He's more willing to forgive us
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; than we are willing to accept it.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; More willing to forgive us than we are
[1:44:37] to accept it. That's right.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:41] Hallelujah.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:44:51] The devil held you. Ain't that right?
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; The devil held you.
[1:44:57] You was in his pawn shop. He had you in
[1:45:00] the back of his little old place back
[1:45:02] there.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; You couldn't go. You couldn't go.
[1:45:06] Jesus couldn't come and give you that
[1:45:08] paper. He couldn't come to give that
[1:45:11] pawn shop man that receipt
[1:45:15] cuz he hadn't paid for it yet. Ain't
[1:45:18] that right? Couldn't do it. No matter
[1:45:21] how much you would slay a lamb, offer
[1:45:24] the blood, that you would be covered for
[1:45:27] that year, you'd go out with the same
[1:45:30] desire again.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? You'd still go out
[1:45:32] with the same desire. This is a real
[1:45:35] lesson for us. Amen. But I'm here to
[1:45:38] tell you after Calvary,
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; after Calvary, he came into that pawn
[1:45:43] shop and he gave that pawn shop owner
[1:45:45] SAID, "YEAH, I HAVE BOUGHT THEM. I have
[1:45:48] paid for them. LET THEM GO."
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; LET THEM OUT. THEY'RE FREE NOW.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; NOW, I'm here to tell you, he gives you
[1:45:58] that paper. He forgives you. Not only
[1:46:00] does he forgive you, Amen. And this here
[1:46:02] is the kind of forgiveness that takes
[1:46:05] THE VERY DESIRE FOR SIN.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; OH, but I still struggle. I still have
[1:46:20] my ups and downs. I FIND MYSELF GOING
[1:46:22] BACK OUT INTO SIN. I FIND MYSELF SINNING
[1:46:24] AGAIN. BROTHER, LET ME TELL YOU
[1:46:26] SOMETHING. YOU JUST HAVEN'T went deep
[1:46:28] enough.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Come on. Are you with me? HOW MANY
[1:46:32] BELIEVE YOU NEED TO go deep enough to
[1:46:34] WHERE YOU HAVE POWER OVER YOUR BODY?
[1:46:36] POWER OVER DESIRES OF SIN. IF YOU DON'T,
[1:46:39] THEN THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST HAS NOT
[1:46:40] BEEN APPLIED LIKE IT SHOULD BE IN YOUR
[1:46:42] LIFE.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; SURE, God will forgive you. AMEN. BUT IF
[1:46:47] YOU HAPPEN to say SOMETHING WRONG, DO
[1:46:48] SOMETHING WRONG. SURE, HE'LL FORGIVE
[1:46:50] YOU. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW, HE ALSO
[1:46:52] GIVES YOU THE POWER,
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; THE POWER TO OVERCOME IT.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; CUZ YOU'VE EITHER OVERCOME IT OR YOU
[1:46:58] HAVEN'T.
[1:47:00] AMEN.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; OH, I'm here to tell you, I'm so glad
[1:47:05] that I'm like that little mouse. Amen.
[1:47:07] In the Egypt, the grains of Egypt. Ain't
[1:47:10] that right?
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; I'm here to TELL YOU, WE JUST DON'T
[1:47:14] REALIZE WHAT WE HAVE.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; AND I WANT TO REALIZE WHAT I HAVE.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU,
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; BOY, WE GET SO EXCITED ABOUT JUST A FEW
[1:47:22] THINGS, BUT LET ME SAY SOMETHING. THE
[1:47:23] WHOLE GARDENER IS FULL OF GRAIN.
[1:47:26] YOU AIN'T GOT TO SAY, "WELL, now God, I
[1:47:28] hate to ask you this.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; COME ON."
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; You know, but maybe you could help me
[1:47:33] with my temper.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Or maybe you could help me with a little
[1:47:36] this, that, or the other. I want you to
[1:47:38] know you can say, "God, give me all of
[1:47:41] it. God, HELP ME TO OVERCOME SIN AND
[1:47:43] DESIRES OF SIN. LET ME HAVE A BUNCH OF
[1:47:45] IT." YOU DON'T HAVE TO EAT SPARINGLY.
[1:47:48] DON'T EAT OF THIS food sparingly. Don't
[1:47:51] put it that don't take it from THEM
[1:47:52] GRAIN BINS, PACK IT IN YOUR MOUTH AND GO
[1:47:54] OVER THERE, MAKE A LITTLE HOLE AND
[1:47:55] DECIDE, I better pack up. I better sack
[1:47:57] SOME FOR LATER. NO, THERE'S PLENTY.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; ASK ABUNDANTLY THAT YOUR joy
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; people might be able to tell.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; ASK SO MUCH UNTIL people can tell that
[1:48:11] you're happy.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Ask me. Ask me. You ask me why I'm
[1:48:22] happy. So, I'll just tell you why.
[1:48:24] BECAUSE MY SINS ARE GONE. THEY'RE
[1:48:27] UNDERNEATH THE BLOOD. AND THE SEA OF
[1:48:29] GOD'S FORGETFULNESS.
[1:48:31] THAT'S WHY I REMOVED THIS DARKNESS FROM
[1:48:33] GOD. THAT'S WHY WE'RE HAPPY. THAT'S WHY
[1:48:35] I HAVE JOY.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN WALK THAT WAY EVERY DAY.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE YOU CAN WALK THAT WAY
[1:48:40] EVERY DAY WITH JOY IN YOUR HEART, PEACE
[1:48:43] IN YOUR HEART, THAT DEVIL UNDER YOUR
[1:48:45] FEET AS WE WERE SINGING LAST NIGHT?
[1:48:52] HALLELUJAH. I'm being carnal now,
[1:48:55] Brother Brown. I'm looking at the the
[1:48:56] clock.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Take it down.
[1:49:04] My mind wants to be compassionate on
[1:49:07] y'all's getting tired.
[1:49:16] How many liked our worship last night?
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; How many thought that was good?
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; That was good.
[1:49:27] Amen.
[1:49:28] Why? I think you know
[1:49:31] if we would all drop dead,
[1:49:34] we'd all drop dead.
[1:49:38] I would trust
[1:49:41] that we'd rise on the other side saying
[1:49:44] glory.
[1:49:46] Hallelujah.
[1:49:48] I'M STILL THE SAME OVER HERE AS I WAS
[1:49:50] OVER THERE. I'M STILL GIVING GOD GLORY.
[1:49:53] I'M STILL GIVING GOD PRAISE. I'M DOING
[1:49:56] WHAT I WAS DOING OVER THERE. IT'S TIME
[1:49:58] TO ACT LIKE WE'RE OVER THERE YET.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME TO PRAISE GOD LIKE WE'RE
[1:50:02] ALREADY THERE.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; OH, WE'RE AS GOOD AS THERE. LET'S
[1:50:06] REJOICE WITH THAT QUARTER. AMEN. THAT
[1:50:08] DOWN PAYMENT. YOU COULD BE JUST AS HAPPY
[1:50:10] WITH THE HOLY GHOST HERE.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; AS IF YOU HAD THE BREAD. WE'RE JUST AS
[1:50:15] HAPPY AS IF WE was in heaven.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Give me five, GUYS. GIVE ME FIVE, GIRLS.
[1:50:24] HALLELUJAH.
[1:50:26] That's what we're GOING TO DO. WE'RE
[1:50:28] GOING TO GIVE SOME HIGH FIVES OVER.
[1:50:31] HALLELUJAH.
[1:50:33] That's what WE'RE GOING TO DO. WE'RE
[1:50:34] GOING TO SCREAM AND WE'RE GOING TO
[1:50:35] SHOUT. WE'RE GOING TO DANCE ABOUT.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; I'm going to LET THE GLORY WHALE WHEN
[1:50:44] THE ROLL IS COLD AND GLOWING. I'M HAVING
[1:50:46] THE TIME OF MY LIFE.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Even when the time of my life isn't
[1:50:51] over.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Rejoice.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:04] Man,
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; imagine what we could do if we didn't
[1:51:07] have this
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; breath to deal with.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; We could just have a good time.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; We wouldn't slow down.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; No. Hallelujah.
[1:51:27] Give it all you got.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; Give it all you got.
[1:51:39] God is great. God is great.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Hung the moon and the stars. NEVER HAD A
[1:51:45] BEGINNING, NEVER HAS an end. GOD IS
[1:51:47] GREAT. HE BROUGHT US HERE. He made who
[1:51:50] you are. HE BROUGHT US PROVIDED
[1:51:52] SALVATION FOR YOU. THE lamb did it all.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is worthy.
[1:52:02] Well, brother B, you can preach. Brother
[1:52:05] Ryan, you can preach. Brother Andrew,
[1:52:07] you can really preach. Brother Matt, you
[1:52:09] you can really preach. Let me tell you
[1:52:11] something. We can't preach,
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; We can't preach,
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; No. God gave us gifts.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; And that gift of God is what preaches.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; It's him. He gets the credit. AND HE
[1:52:26] SAYS, "GOD GETS THE CREDIT FOR PREACHING
[1:52:28] TO YOU THE WORD OF GOD. WE DON'T SEEK
[1:52:31] GLORY. WE GIVE HIM THE GLORY.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; HE gives me the grace."
[1:52:38] That's right.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. Get somebody up here that
[1:52:42] don't have the gift and see what
[1:52:43] happens.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Well, like not sure what I'm going to
[1:52:48] say, huh? I guess we'll see what the
[1:52:51] forefathers did. No,
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; you won't be able to preach. It's a gift
[1:52:57] that God gives.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; That's right,
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; brother Brandon. How many know he was
[1:53:00] given that gift
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; to where he could stand here and dream
[1:53:04] dreams or so to speak visions,
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; He was made his subconscious conscience
[1:53:10] built that close together.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; God gets the glory.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; How many believe God gets the glory?
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; God is worthy
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; of all of our praise. He is worthy of
[1:53:23] our shouting,
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; our dancing,
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; the way that WE LIVE, CONSECRATE
[1:53:28] OURSELVES, HONOR HIM WITH our lives.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; When we come into THE HOUSE OF GOD, I
[1:53:34] will enter his gates,
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; with sadness in my heart.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; No, I will enter HIS GATES WITH
[1:53:40] THANKSGIVING IN MY HEART. I WILL ENTER
[1:53:43] HIS COURTS WITH
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; PRAISE.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:53:50] GLORY,
[1:53:52] HONOR, POWER, STRENGTH, GLORY BE TO HIM.
[1:53:57] WE REALIZE IT'S ALL ABOUT HIM.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; WE TALK A LOT ABOUT US AND WHAT HE'S
[1:54:01] GIVEN US AND WHO WE ARE, but I like to
[1:54:04] talk about who he is. He's everything.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; He is my everything. He is my all. Amen.
[1:54:11] Sometimes I think we need to do in
[1:54:13] closing, we do need to do like Paul and
[1:54:15] Silas did. Ain't that right? They were
[1:54:18] locked up in the inner prisons.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:21] Oh, if Israel, if Israel would have just
[1:54:24] done it whenever they got in by the Red
[1:54:27] Sea. Hello.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Paul and Silas in prison.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Israel by the Red Sea.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; God put him in a trap, didn't he?
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; There they were sitting. Oh man. Man,
[1:54:39] did Moses did you bring us out here to
[1:54:41] die?
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; You know, wasn't there enough graves in
[1:54:44] Egypt? What kind of a leader are you,
[1:54:46] Moses? If they had just done it a little
[1:54:49] bit different.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; If it had been Joshua and Caleb's,
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; If David said, "Just stand still. Just
[1:54:55] hold still a minute." DIDN'T EVEN GOD
[1:54:57] SAY MANY TIMES HE SAYS, "YOU JUST STAND
[1:54:59] STILL. I WILL FIGHT YOUR BATTLE." THE
[1:55:02] BATTLE IS NOT YOURS. IT'S MINE. NOT THE
[1:55:06] BATTLE IS NOT YOURS. IT'S GOD'S. BROTHER
[1:55:08] ON THE BATTLE IS NOT YOURS. IT'S GOD'S.
[1:55:10] YOU ARE GOD. DEFEAT THE DEVIL EVERY
[1:55:12] TIME. HALLELUJAH. THE BATTLE IS HERE.
[1:55:15] REST, LITTLE BRIDE. REST.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; We have rest when hard times come. When
[1:55:21] struggles come, all those trials, all
[1:55:24] those tests that God puts us through.
[1:55:25] What is it to do? I've come to the
[1:55:28] conclusion. It's to bring us to the
[1:55:29] death of oursel. That's
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; It's to teach us to rely on him,
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; to give our battles to him, to give our
[1:55:38] fears to him and let him fight it for
[1:55:40] us.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Because man, doesn't matter who and
[1:55:42] what. Remember this one thing. Your
[1:55:45] biggest enemy
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; is still that old self of yours.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Not in getting it out of the way. Not
[1:55:50] dying to yourself. Not committing things
[1:55:53] to God when you should.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:59] But we're getting to that place, aren't
[1:56:00] we? How many's looking for a rapture?
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Yes. God bless your hands. We're all
[1:56:06] looking for that rapture anytime. And
[1:56:09] I'm here to tell you this morning, may
[1:56:11] we say, God, I don't care what you got
[1:56:15] to do. You have me
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; ready.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Often often says it's not a time to get
[1:56:21] ready. Not a time to get ready unless
[1:56:23] you're not ready.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; But Jesus said, "Be ready.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Be ready.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; Be ready. Walk every day ready to go."
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; How many in here? Just be honest. Heads
[1:56:39] bowed. Heads bowed. How many in here
[1:56:41] would say, brother Ba, I'll be honest
[1:56:43] with that question
[1:56:45] with what you statement that you made a
[1:56:48] while ago that death doesn't really
[1:56:50] change you. I heard brother B say that
[1:56:51] different times very strongly. It
[1:56:53] doesn't change who you are. It only
[1:56:54] changes your dwelling place. Can you say
[1:56:57] that you'd be ready to go? Or do you
[1:57:00] need to make adjustments? Do you need to
[1:57:01] commit yourself more to God? How many
[1:57:03] would be in here in that condition say
[1:57:05] I'm not where I ought to be. Amen. See,
[1:57:07] cuz the we don't come here just for our
[1:57:10] good places. We come to see where our
[1:57:12] bad places are,
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; where we can give more to God. And
[1:57:14] that's who I'm calling on to now. Be
[1:57:16] honest. You're not raising your hand to
[1:57:19] me. You raise it to Jesus Christ and
[1:57:20] say, you know, I can't honestly say in
[1:57:22] my heart, can honestly say in my heart
[1:57:25] that I'm really ready and I want to be
[1:57:28] ready and Jesus loves you and Jesus will
[1:57:32] forgive you and Jesus will help you. He
[1:57:34] wants you to be ready more than what you
[1:57:35] do.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so as you raise your hand,
[1:57:37] let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, you see
[1:57:39] these hands that still are not quite
[1:57:42] ready. There's still an element they
[1:57:44] need to change. There's still something,
[1:57:46] Lord, that they need to give over to you
[1:57:47] that they need to surrender. They
[1:57:49] haven't surrendered their life
[1:57:50] completely like they should. They're
[1:57:51] still struggling with this or that.
[1:57:53] Father, you see those hands right now.
[1:57:55] And we ask, God, that you go beneath
[1:57:57] that hand, Lord Jesus, and may they
[1:57:59] consecrate themselves more deeply, Lord.
[1:58:02] Surrender theselves more deeply, Lord,
[1:58:04] so that you can move in there. give an
[1:58:06] avenue of coming in and changing their
[1:58:08] life, Lord, and filling them with your
[1:58:11] spirit, Lord. Giving them that uncction
[1:58:13] of the Holy Spirit, Lord. We ask, God,
[1:58:16] that you would do this just now, Father,
[1:58:18] they wouldn't go to the same out of here
[1:58:20] as they came
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:27] Amen.
[1:58:30] I've got so much to thank him for, so
[1:58:33] much to praise him for. Amen. How many
[1:58:36] knows that Lord has been so good to me?
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; He's been so good to us. The least we
[1:58:40] can do is completely surrender to him.
[1:58:43] God bless you. Let's stand. Musicians,
[1:58:44] if you'll come. Amen. We'll turn it
[1:58:46] over. Amen to our pastor again. I want
[1:58:50] to say amen again. It's been a real
[1:58:53] pleasure to be with you.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; It is Amen. When brother Andrew and
[1:58:59] brother Ron an invited me over to come
[1:59:01] about six months ago, you know, I
[1:59:03] thought it was a long time and then just
[1:59:05] a few weeks I says, "Wow, it's already
[1:59:08] here." I thought, you know, that's just
[1:59:10] how quickly we'll be going back home.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. How lovely it would be to be able
[1:59:16] to be here, visit with everybody, get to
[1:59:19] know everybody, and wouldn't that be
[1:59:21] nice?
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; But time
[1:59:24] and so forth doesn't allow us to do
[1:59:26] that. But I believe even the prophet
[1:59:28] says, you know, we'll make an
[1:59:29] appointment later on. We'll make an
[1:59:30] appointment. We'll all get together.
[1:59:34] I can just imagine it, can't you?
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; All message churches to believers, at
[1:59:38] least the saved ones out of them. Amen.
[1:59:41] They'll all come up there.
[1:59:43] We'll have 10,000 years. We're so
[1:59:46] grateful for the mercy of God. God bless
[1:59:48] you people. In the name of the Lord
[1:59:50] Jesus Christ, I pray that the word
[1:59:52] that's been brought has been a blessing
[1:59:53] to you, has encouraged you, brought your
[1:59:55] faith up,
[1:59:57] knocked the devil down.
[2:00:00] Amen. And brought you joy. God bless
[2:00:02] you, baby. God bless you, brother.
[2:00:06] Amen. God bless you, baby. Praise the
[2:00:08] Lord.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; We got something to praise the Lord for,
[2:00:12] don't we?
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; I was sitting yesterday morning with uh
[2:00:17] with a business partner. He came and
[2:00:18] just showed up for breakfast and he was
[2:00:20] sitting there talking. He's he's one of
[2:00:21] the smartest men I've ever met in my
[2:00:23] life. And he's sitting there and he was
[2:00:24] talking and he was talking about the
[2:00:26] different languages that that we use.
[2:00:28] And he said throughout our day, he said,
[2:00:30] "We you barely use a thousand words in
[2:00:33] our day in our vocabulary." And I began
[2:00:36] to think while brother Tom was just
[2:00:38] ministering on that thought. We never
[2:00:41] could express with all of the words that
[2:00:44] we've been able to have throughout our
[2:00:46] English language of how great our God
[2:00:49] is.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; I can tell you one thing for sure. We
[2:00:53] enjoy worshiping the Lord here.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; But he said this. He said this in his
[2:00:57] statement. He said, he said, "The Bible
[2:00:59] said to make a joyful noise to the
[2:01:01] Lord."
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; And I I looked at him and he said, he
[2:01:04] said, "But so many people look at that
[2:01:06] and think it's just a loud voice." He
[2:01:08] said, "But they forget that there's
[2:01:10] something to be happy about, too." And I
[2:01:12] thought, "Here's one of the most
[2:01:14] smartest men that's ever walked in shoe
[2:01:15] leather." And here he is. His
[2:01:18] intelligence still tells him that there
[2:01:20] is a God that is deserving of all the
[2:01:23] worthy. He's worthy of all the glory,
[2:01:25] honor, and praise. Well, we're just a
[2:01:27] bunch of hillbillies down here.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; And there is something on the inside of
[2:01:31] us that wants to express that he is
[2:01:34] still Jehovah Gyra. He is still Jehovah
[2:01:38] Shalom. He is more than able to reach to
[2:01:41] the uttermost parts of the earth. And I
[2:01:44] just want to thank him with everything
[2:01:45] that's within me. Is that your heart's

[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; Today we have our brother Alvin Y over
[2:22:04] here as a candidate, a candidate to be
[2:22:07] taken on the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:22:08] Christ. We realize that the scripture
[2:22:11] says to repent and be baptized in the
[2:22:13] name of the Lord Jesus Christ every one
[2:22:14] of you for the remission of your sins
[2:22:16] and you shall receive the gift of the
[2:22:18] Holy Ghost that this promises unto you
[2:22:19] and to your children to many as the Lord
[2:22:21] our God shall call. And here's a proof
[2:22:24] today that God is still calling.
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; And Peter went on to say and he began to
[2:22:29] testify to them many words said to be a
[2:22:31] witness unto this unward generation and
[2:22:34] our Lord Jesus Christ is still calling
[2:22:36] witnesses. And we're so thankful for our
[2:22:38] brother's decision to take on the name
[2:22:40] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Our
[2:22:42] brother, we just pray and God will
[2:22:45] refill you with the Holy Ghost as
[2:22:47] commissioned by his word. Father, we
[2:22:50] come before you today in this very
[2:22:52] sacred and sovereign moment. Lord, we
[2:22:55] realize, Lord Jesus, the abilities of
[2:22:57] human beings, Father, that we could we
[2:23:00] could do a whole lot with our hands, but
[2:23:02] Lord, we could never do anything what
[2:23:04] you're doing today. Lord, I so thank
[2:23:08] you, Father, that the word of the Lord
[2:23:10] is quick and powerful, that it still
[2:23:12] reaches. Our brother's been streaming
[2:23:15] for quite some time and here he is been
[2:23:17] coming the last few services father and
[2:23:19] feels the prick in his heart Lord Jesus
[2:23:21] to make everything right to bury the old
[2:23:24] man. And I pray father Lord Jesus that
[2:23:27] you would do exceedingly abundantly
[2:23:29] above all that we could ever ask or
[2:23:31] think. Now, Father, you said it in your
[2:23:33] words over 2,000 years ago that if we
[2:23:36] would repent to completely to completely
[2:23:39] turn away from the old man and to turn
[2:23:41] to you, Father, that you would fill us
[2:23:43] with the gift of the Holy Ghost. Our
[2:23:45] brother is desiring to take on not just
[2:23:48] a name, but the name of all of heaven
[2:23:51] and earth. We realize that the king's
[2:23:53] sword has been placed in the bride's
[2:23:54] hand. So, Father, today as I stand here
[2:23:57] with that rod of the name of Jesus
[2:24:00] Christ in my hand to strike down the
[2:24:02] enemy, I baptize our brother in
[2:24:04] Christian baptism in the name of the
[2:24:07] Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:41] We have brother Alvin's wife, sister
[2:24:43] Marian here to take on the name of the
[2:24:46] Lord Jesus Christ. We're so thankful for
[2:24:48] her decision today. Amen. is let's just
[2:24:51] pray and ask the Lord Jesus to do a
[2:24:54] great work in your life. Father, you
[2:24:57] commissioned us, Lord, right before your
[2:24:59] ascension to go into all the world and
[2:25:02] baptize them in the name of the Father,
[2:25:04] Son, and Holy Ghost. We realize today,
[2:25:07] Lord Jesus, that Peter picked up that
[2:25:08] revelation on the day of Pentecost and
[2:25:11] he stood there and preached unto them
[2:25:13] and 3,000 souls were saved on that day.
[2:25:16] And father, we realize Lord Jesus that
[2:25:18] he grabbed the revelation of who who the
[2:25:21] name of heaven is. It's the name of the
[2:25:23] Lord Jesus Christ. Father, Son, and Holy
[2:25:26] Ghost. So, Father, according to thy
[2:25:28] commission to go into all the world.
[2:25:30] Here we are in this little parcel of
[2:25:33] land in Elton, Virginia, baptizing and
[2:25:36] commissioning Lord Jesus, our sister, to
[2:25:38] go out there and to be a witness of the
[2:25:40] Holy Ghost. So, Father, according to thy
[2:25:42] word, I baptize our sister in the name
[2:25:45] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:26:20] Mason, you're a special man to me. You
[2:26:24] remind me a lot of myself.
[2:26:26] You're the best golfer I probably ever
[2:26:28] played with in my entire life.
[2:26:31] Seen you hit some of the greatest shots.
[2:26:34] But I couldn't be more proud of you than
[2:26:36] I am right now.
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:26:38] &gt;&gt; You might be a pro in that world, but
[2:26:41] today you're a superstar in the kingdom
[2:26:42] of God.
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; According to thy faith in the Lord Jesus
[2:26:47] Christ, you've repented of your sins.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; It was more than a girl that brought you
[2:26:52] here. It was our Lord Jesus Christ that
[2:26:54] did this great work.
[2:26:56] and God will finish.
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we stand here, Lord Jesus,
[2:27:02] in this watery grave. Father,
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; Lord, we sense the very nearness of the
[2:27:07] Holy Spirit, the witness of the great I
[2:27:10] am. Lord, you told us in your word that
[2:27:13] if we would go therefore and preach,
[2:27:14] Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, that you would
[2:27:17] bring forth some 40 and some 50, some
[2:27:20] 60, some 100fold. Father, Lord, Brother
[2:27:23] Mason's been sitting here, Lord Jesus,
[2:27:26] and has heard the message of the hour
[2:27:28] preached. It has stirred his heart
[2:27:30] abundantly, Father. We have seen you
[2:27:33] deal with his life over and over again.
[2:27:35] And today we are a witness, Lord Jesus,
[2:27:38] that you're still calling those. And
[2:27:40] Father, Lord, I stand here, Lord Jesus,
[2:27:43] in this very special moment. I pray,
[2:27:46] Father, that as I baptize him in water
[2:27:48] that you would baptize him with the fire
[2:27:50] of the Holy Spirit,
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; Lord, he means so much to his mother and
[2:27:54] father. He means so much to Full Gospel
[2:27:57] Lighthouse, but he means so much more to
[2:27:59] heaven. Oh yeah.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; And Father, today he walks out of this
[2:28:02] water. Lord, completely different than
[2:28:04] he walked in. He walks out carrying the
[2:28:07] name of Jesus Christ, an ambassador of
[2:28:10] all of heaven. So according to thy word,
[2:28:12] I baptize brother Mason in the name of
[2:28:15] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:28:40] Amen. Let's stand.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. As we prepare to dis be dismissed
[2:28:50] this morning. Oh, there is power. Power,
[2:28:55] wonder working power in the blood
[2:28:59] of the lamb.
[2:29:02] Oh, there is power, power, wonder
[2:29:06] working power in the precious blood of
[2:29:10] the lamb.

[2:30:12] dismissed. There is power, power, wonder
