and um again it's such a delight to be here with you and we you know when you when we first get up when I in the room there thinking of all the wonderful things I want to say about your pastor and and uh and about the church here and then you get here and you get a little nervous and you say all right I just need to start preaching amen but we do appreciate brother Ron Spencer and you know he's always he's been a great blessing to the bride around the world and lots of times people look at preachers as well they've got it easy and you know as if they don't have any problems but your pastor here has has exhibited over and over the faith and the Deep confidence that he has in the Lord Jesus Christ and we appreciate men like that that amen that can fight behind the pulpit and then fight at home too can you say Amen and so we we mightily appreciate our brother and we appreciate brother Andrew brother Andrew come and preach for us uh uh preach for you at our youth camp last year and done a tremendous job and and um and so we we just greatly uh we just feel like it's a real honor to be here behind this Pulpit here this evening I trust that I can say something a man that will be a blessing to you and um so let's look here in Genesis the 18th chapter we're going to read the first six verses and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he set in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door I want you to notice that he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and said Lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant let a little water I pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree and I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts after that ye had after ye uh shall pass on for therefore are ye come to your servant and they said so do and do as thou has said and Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal and kneel it are needed and make breads up on the earth I want you to notice here the intensity the brother that Abraham has toward the angel of the Lord he is entertaining the angel of the Lord and I want to preach here tonight when entertaining the angel of the Lord entertain means to give attention to it means to nurture it means to receive someone it means to cling to and the scripture says in the as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man there's going to be a revealing and there's going to be a receiving let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you tonight for your blessings how wonderful it is to be in the house of the Lord and father it's a privilege to stand here to minister to this group right here in Virginia and I pray Lord that you would bless them bless their pastor Lord bless sister Connie Lord and all of the laborers here in the church I pray Lord that your blessings would be upon this service that it would be upon your word tonight I pray Lord that you would anoint your servant father I I just ask that you would just step up behind the platform now and that you would Minister to the people is my prayer we love you father and we're so thankful for your grace in our lives in the name of Jesus we pray can the Church Say Amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here tonight I want to speak on entertaining the angel of the Lord as it was in the days of Sodom I think we can pretty well attest that amen we're living in those days we it's a day of absolute self-gratification it was a day when every man done that which was right in his own eyes until there were absolutely no boundaries there there was no boundaries to sin it was a discovering of their sexuality it was a day of homosexuality uh children born gender neutral Madness as long as they wanted it they got it Sodom was a a day of great perversion Iman there was no questioning of the of the belief system you see lot's senses had literally become so numbed I I want you to think about that until he become accustomed to this new Norm becomes so accustomed until he could rub shoulders with the sodomites and really think oh surely surely God you know looks on the heart and and the people are loving God in their own way and and and maybe he was attending his own a church every Sunday morning because you see these sodomites were avid worshipers amen they they amen their worship wasn't as strict as Abraham's of course but but they believed full-heartedly that God would accept them in their worship no matter what they were they were all covered because they were worshipers well can you say Amen and lot didn't have enough get up in him to stand out he couldn't stand out so he Blended in now I want to set the stage for what this Mighty Angel A man was coming into can you say amen that's for Abraham's way of seeing things lot simply could not see it he was blinded to the fact that Sodom was fixing to burn he was blinded to the fact amen that he himself had had fallen so far behind he was blinded to the fact that God was fulfilling his promise to Abraham can you say mine they're in Romans 1 and 21 this is because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools well praise the Lord I I think that pretty well tells us where we're at today amen you you you you can't find anybody amen hardly in the in the secular world or in the religious world that that believes even a portion of this Bible anymore oh man you can pick out any denomination you want to amen show me where the power of God is show me where the overcoming glory of God is in the church show me what's going on Amen they've got their light shows they've got their million dollar stages they've got everything going on Amen but I want to tell you there's a God that is here Among Us the angel of the Lord is among us tonight and that angel is here to fulfill his promise to you man can you say man hallelujah amen you see those actions are the results of the blindness of the age lot had nothing in him to change him amen for it is only in the revealing of the son of man is where the glory of the Lord is revealed to the elect of God I want to tell you young people you can't look off to the right you can't look off to the left amen you can't look and lay out a Seer and find your your satisfaction you've got to find it in the word because God is here to fulfill his word to whoever is sitting there waiting for that promise to be fulfilled I want to tell you here tonight God's here to fulfill his word I want to tell you God he is not a stranger to his promises if God spoke it God will bring it to pass well blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen we've got the light shows we've got the smoke better and how we got amen all of these things that's coming to pass but only in the revealing of the son of man is where the body change is going to happen how many believes there's going to be a body change how many beliefs there's going to be a Rapture how many beliefs there is a new Heaven and a new Earth [Applause] it requires the angel of the Lord among us amen Luther couldn't didn't produce the son of man the methodists haven't produced the son of man amen the Baptist or the Pentecostals all of their yester churches amen have been poisoned by Sodom the life has come back to the original Queen brother Brandon would put it this way he says she is now a dry shock it's past the spirit of God passed through her is true and will not she will not be Heir with the Vindicated seed work she sure will not be she will not be in the Rapture she'll be a church member and may come up in the second Resurrection but judged according to what she's heard but the elect has got a promise [Applause] amen now I want to say here this evening as I am building upon my thought Abraham's seed is not caught up in laodicea culture don't get caught up and lay ought to see a culture now come on now they will never see you for who you are and you will never be fulfilled out there and lay ought to see you amen out there in this sin and out there in the muck and out there in the mark well praise the Lord amen these days we've got these you know you've got that internet and you've got your cell phones and and it's easy to see you know I I hope it's okay here tonight but amen it's easy to pull up you know you know the the little videos of the of all of the singers gospel singers singing and they've got their they've got their earrings on and they've got their makeup and and they look like pretty old people and amen and it looks like the glory of the Lord is with them and well praise the Lord amen but I want to tell you there's an elect that is going to stay away from Sodom amen they're not there trying to fit in with Sodom they have got a promise of God and that promise is what they're clinging to they know God won't lie they know God will keep his word they know God's Gonna fulfill his promise oh can you say Amen but when the angel of the Lord comes she is sitting at his feet she is adoring him she is loving him she is giving him the joy that you have her heart can you say Amen Hallelujah amen as long as you've got your heart looking at other things you can't love him as long as you've got your heart amen strung out here and strung out there and strung out here what come on church amen but there is a bride that is without spot she is withhel wrinkle and the presence of God is with her [Applause] Hallelujah well praise the Lord Hallelujah I know the Temptations are there amen you young people I was a young person myself Hallelujah believe it or not I used to have hair amen used to be good looking amen I know what it's like amen for the pressures of this world to pull on us I know what it's like for the enemy to try to amen pull me this way and and lust to pull me this way and the pornography to pull me that way come on church amen these young people are young and the devil is fighting for him but I want to tell you we've got the holy spirit with us he will not fail us his anointing is with us entertain his presence you should never come and sit in a church service and not entertain his presence you should never stand in a Bible study and not entertain his presence amen we got you can come in here and sit on the church all you want to keep your hands all folded amen and step there and wait for the preacher to move you but I want to tell you God is here if you can recognize him Hallelujah he's still a Healer he's still a deliverer he's still a baptizer he's still a filler with a holy ghost entertaining his presence [Applause] oh Hallelujah come on now you can't entertain him as long as you're sneaking around with those little mini skirts and you can't entertain him with skinny jeans on you can't entertain him as long as you're trying to fit in with all the weirdo haircuts and well praise the Lord amen well I'm a Christian amen Soul was lot Soul was lot and lot was so blinded to what God was doing in that day he was so blinded amen that he would have been destroyed he would have been destroyed by the destroying Angels come on church but it was Abraham that God appeared to it was the one who was waiting it was the one who was seeking it was the one who was entertaining his presence praise the Lord amen you see brother Branham said now look at it bruised wounded tour opened up his side with a Roman spear in order that by the Holy Spirit we could be baptized into his body partakers of his divine nature you get it would you become a partaker after coming into his body a partaker of his divine nature Christ nature in you how can you cheat and steal and lie and backslide and proselyte everything else with the divine nature of Christ in you it is impossible so let that soak just a few minutes because it's right if you're a partaker in Christ then you become a new creature and old things have passed away and all things have become new can I hear a great big amen all of our warrings and fussings and stewings and arguings and tempers all of these things just pass away do you see it what is the fruit of the spirit we've been we've planted on church membership upon shouting upon demonstrations of our words but the fruit of the spirit is first love love who when you love those that are in love alone that's the spirit of Christ love joy peace long-suffering goodness meekness gentleness patience there's the fruit of the spirit so no matter how what what church you belong to or what you have done now you say now brother Branham I tell you I do this and I do that I know what what I've got because I can pray for the sick and and they're healed brother Brianna and God just revealed the word to me like this and like that and like the other and I've got the knowledge of the word he says you're absolutely wrong oh now that hits us hard you're up you're wrong if you're not entertaining his presence he says I heal the sick and I speak with tongues and I do these things and I cast out Devils then he'll come to me in that day with the same story can you say amen amen he says depart from me you workers of iniquity I don't even know you he says that kind of changes the picture doesn't it brother Abraham and Sarah must I remind you must I remind you that God has got a specific promise for you Abraham didn't follow lot out there in Sodom he had a different revelation well I'm fixing to preach here in a minute but in the revealing of the son of man when God is revealed in the form of dust when God is here Discerning the hearts of the people night after night with Precision year after year the son of man literally restoring the hearts to the faith oh come on church it was God's love for you that sent a profit to you [Applause] man oh come on Amen but oh what was wrong in those days there they wanted they wanted the Miracles they wanted to that they wanted the discernment they wanted these things here but when the word came it was the word that was going to produce that body change it was it was the revealing of the son of man at that tent oh come on church amen it's not in our emotion and buddy I love emotion it's not Amen in our singing and I love this singer but it is in the Blessed word that has come hallelujah amen shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God when you ain't got a song you've got the word when your emotions are gone you've got the word when you're feeling empty you've got the word it's that word oh come on Church it's that word that'll defeat the Devil any time any place under any condition whether you feel it it's still there whether you're whether you're high on the mountain or low in the valley that word is still there Hallelujah though I walk to the valley Ron Spitzer the wife walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for that one with me for thy rod and that's death Shepherd's rot the shepherd's staff the shepherd's words leading oh Hallelujah brother Wendell I'm scared for my life right now just keep walking with the word another window I just don't know what the next step is just keep walking with the word I just don't know how I'm going to produce that baby just keep walking with the word there's going to come a time where you're going to come into Sarah and say Sarah the angel is at my door the angel the one I met the one who gave the promise the one who's never failed that God is at my door [Applause] been waiting a long time keep on waiting been standing here a long time keep on standing he's here on the Earth [Applause] you say there's only one flaw that I have with that analogy brother Wendell it's been 60 years since the prophet was here so the angel must have went home with him the angel of the Lord is still on the Earth and the last I heard that it was the mighty angel coming to the Earthly angel well praise the Lord foreign I need some help come here buddy I need both of y'all right there amen come up here Hallelujah I need one of you to stand right up here stand stand on that chair right there Hallelujah I need you to stand right here at the pulpit Hallelujah don't be reading my notes I need I need another volunteer come here come here the might you got to be up there come on you're the mighty angel now does the bible say that that the mighty angel came with me closed book or an open book huh it was closed in Revelations 5 but Revelations 10 the mighty Angel is descending from heaven with an open book you're down here Hallelujah Hallelujah you weren't expecting much anyways Hallelujah the mighty angel is to come to the Earthly angel well praise the Lord is that the way the Bible reads now is that something brother Branham conjured up or is that the way the Bible reads it the mighty Angel is to come with an open book and give it to the Earthly angel [Applause] all right come on down that you hand the book to the Earthly angel don't close that book now you get up there and you start preaching Point your finger preachers have got to point their finger [Applause] the mighty Angel is very disappointed in you right now so the mighty Angel has just came to the Earthly Angel and the Earthly Angel is giving you the book [Applause] he didn't come to me he didn't come to another Andrew he didn't come to brother Ron he didn't come to brother Josh he came to the seventh angel messenger [Applause] but too many people put it all with the seventh angel messenger but the seventh angel said my job is to declare that he is here the seventh Angel's job is to declare the angel of the Lord is here [Applause] come on now but you're gonna miss that angel as long as you're looking to Hollywood you're going to miss that angel as long as you're looking to lay out of sea it's time to look into the promises of God [Applause] thank you now as he's declaring as he's declaring the word amen are you hearing me the message can only come through the seventh angel but the only reason the mighty angel came down the only reason the Earthly Angel proclaimed was because this little nobody this fellow here that no one likes not even girls will look at him thankfully he's got a mama she still loves him I'm just joking amen all of a sudden all of a sudden there is a hope that is happening to this bride we've been waiting for seven Church ages we've been waiting for 2 000 years but when the angel of the Lord showed up on Earth it was a declaration the promise is fixing to be fulfilled every time that word is being preached every time that word is being preached you are being empowered every time that word is being preached all of a sudden Faith muscles are growing every time that word is being preached God's taken a little bit of nobody and he's raising you up and he's showing you his glory come on now it's not your glory but it's his own Glory it's his own manifestation and with him comes the Power with him comes the glory with him comes healing with him comes deliverances with that angel comes all of Heaven can you say math now he's declaring now the Angels declared and he's declaring you're here brother brother Brandon would say now the mighty angel they ain't where he said then Angel the Lord his three feet from where I am He said Come a Little Closer as you'd get a little closer he'd say that warm feeling you're feeling that's him come on now he was introducing you to him the word but as good of a man as you are you've got to go to the Grave you can now be seated nope uh and now we've got everybody coming around amen building memorials Hallelujah billing memorials to the Grave of the Earthly angel now we've got all of the oh come on but I'm here to tell you he ain't there he ain't there he's went beyond the curtain of time he's waiting on you and he's already been given the promise that there is going to be an elect who is going to come to that angel and say give me the Revelation I hear it on the tapes I hear it in the seals I read it in the church age book but I need a revelation from God to me can you say Amen give these guys a hand clap you can take this work you can listen to the seals but if that angel ain't setting their revealing it to you it's just another it's another sermon amen amen you can have the whole library but if that angel isn't there amen entertaining or giving you the Revelation oh come on church amen it still takes the anointing of the holy spirit it's not what you hear it's not what you read but it's in the anointing to reveal that word unto you [Applause] thank you Hallelujah can you see man lot can't change maybe lot read the prophecies maybe lot heard the prophecies from Abraham telling them while he was in his church but lot did not have the little Walmart barcode Hallelujah if you go get your item and you take your atom and you you run it up there to to the cash register and what do they do they don't ask you what is this what is that no they're scattered across the barcode and that scanner tells them what it is because this product is in this that's right lot did not waste lot was not in the system hey man now a lot didn't have the slightest idea Oh Glory oh come on church but there's an elect here on the earth that was in God's mind before the foundation of the world and he has promised I'm going to come down amen I'm going to send Elijah it's going to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers and the angel of God is going to come down and Empower them with a book They're going to be anointed they're not going to be an average church member they're not just going to sit in a church anymore and sing in a choir or play in the music but these men would be anointed of God to defeat the Devil they would be empowered by God to destroy the strongholds of the enemy it's not a pixie gonna come down and wave a magic wand Over You Someday you're gonna merge right in to the Rapture killing Devils as you go can you say man can you say Amen [Applause] so it's not in your knowledge that mighty one that is Among Us how can you say man do you realize that your friends do not have the power within them to change themselves zebra can't change your stripes no matter how much how much you wash them what can you say man leopards can't change their spots and neither could Sarah and neither could Abraham the only difference is one had a barcode from heaven and when the angel came by something started reading ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding something started saying he's near he's near can you say man I wonder sometimes about our attitudes amen Hallelujah but the Bible said Iman that before the fire falls the son of man was to come to Earth and he would be revealed word in flesh and as long amen as the word was in Melchizedek as long as it was in the angel as long as the angel came and he had the word in him he was the only one of power so Abraham knew he held the promise he's here it's about time for fulfillment I'm not gonna let him go Abraham never could produce that baby Sarah couldn't produce the baby but the angel [Music] right you think that he was just going to come and say shake his hand and say God bless you I'll see you on the next trip I'm too tired tonight hey I know this service is way too long I don't feel like praying this morning come on when Abraham saw that angel Abraham wasn't going to let him go oh my oh did did you see all of the amen all of the all of the verbs in there amen he ran to meet him he bowed himself to the ground he cried Lord if I have found favor in thy sight pass not away let a little water be fetched wash your feet rest yourselves I will fetch the morsel of meal Comfort your hearts Abraham hey son come on come on but when the words left the lips of Melchizedek I call it I call the angel McHale's dick Maybe I'm Wrong but when it left the the the lips of that angel and said according to the time of life Sarah is going to have a child it was it was it was now are y'all hearing me it was now in the womb of the heart of Abraham and Sarah was in a bad mood hallelujah amen she said you're you're just quacky Hallelujah in the hands of the Lord Discerning the hearts quickly it was to reveal wait a minute this is not just another man he's not entertaining just some strange fella here this is the Angel of the Lord speaking and according to the time of life she had the baby because she receives the word of the Lord now the prophet of God told us Abraham or Moses was the word and the glory of the Lord would be upon him he was the word he was God to the people but once he delivered the word to the people then the veil could be taken back off of his eyes off of his face you know why because the word was no longer in him the word was now are y'all hearing me the mighty Mighty ain't out here for a show impregnate the bride with that word can you say math amen Hallelujah Oh Glory to God I feel like shouting right now when they received the word of the son of man Abraham and Sarah became the vehicle for the Eternal words of God it was no longer in his a body of dust and flesh now it's in their bodies of dust and flesh now you gotta no you got an old man and an old woman lot don't see anything different but they have received the word of the Lord it's hidden in the womb of their heart wouldn't you have liked to have been a fly on the wall that morning when Abraham got up wiping the sleep out of his eyes and he does the Double Take well baby mama is that you oh come on now amen false teeth are gone she's no longer using the cane she's a walking around she's even flirting with him a little bit how Louie oh yeah amen he looked out the tent door and he says Lord I could hear Sarah say the word is coming to pass I'm glad I entertained the word of the Lord the whole Church of the Living God we're fixing to enter into a body change we're fixing it Hallelujah we've been waiting and we've been waiting but the angel has appeared in this generation he would not have appeared if he did not expect to bring you into that body change [Applause] it was no longer in the angel it was now in Sarah Hallelujah come on I'm gonna I'm gonna use you Hallelujah come on up here you were old and ugly while ago but now there come a change the change happened in the countenance first the change happened in the accepting of that word and believing it the way the seventh angel brought it you say you follow the message and you ain't doing it the way the brother Brandon said to do it you ain't in the message but when you are taking Hallelujah I can tell that you're doing it the way brother Brad I'm done it because you're at church tonight Hallelujah well Glory amen but she accepted the words of the angel long time before the poochie started pooching I'm not saying you're fixing to have a baby I'm not amen can you say man when the friends did not agree when lot did not understand when there was a church split over this Revelation like went that way and Abraham stood there in the desert when everything was chaotic they were living under a promise I want to tell you here tonight you are living under a supernatural promise [Applause] thank you sis Hallelujah can you say man now you say brother one that's just a little it's a little far-fetched I believe those that are entertaining the angel of the Lord I believe that the world can see it [Applause] you can't be entertaining God and living in sin [Applause] well you're just saying brother wouldn't let us ask for no more no no no no I'm here to tell you that there's a plenty of Abraham's elect seed that are out there in Sodom and it's got to be somebody who has news the angel the Lord is here that is going to lead them to the presence of the Lord [Music] can you say Amen the world had to testify oh God the sons of men became Tabernacles for The Living Word the sons of men become an expression of the words they're not just words on a page that you're reading in a message book but this is the presence of God to bring to pass his word in you even the king had to testify that there had been a change can you say Amen it was no longer in Melchizedek it is now in Sarah now brother Branham says but this is this this is Spirit that comes upon the promised word for this age so you've got the messenger who has come anointed and he has preached but this is spirit that comes upon the promised word for the age brings forth and manifests not two tables of stones but the presence of the Living God not a mythical thought somebody made up or some Houdini a trick but the very promise of God revealed and made manifest right before us and then he asked what sort of a veil will that be behind now you can look there brother on and say well I know it's in him I can see it you can look at brother Andrew and say I I know it's in him I can see it you can look at her brother Josh and brother Sean preachers around I I can see it in them but the Bible says where brother Branham says in that day Luke 17 20 which is actually 17 30. I believe it is Jesus said when the son of man is being revealed not men the son of man not an organization the son of man The Living Word the word living itself again among the people the word itself made flesh in you you are the reflection of this hour the message you're the reflection of it where glory to God even the king had to look and say testify that there had been a change amen Abraham says hey baby you look too you you look hot and I'm going to tell you right now yeah I need you to I need you to do something for me Hallelujah tell that King that you're my sister and uh because he'll kill me for you and you think and and you think you've got a bad husband he she says all right so surely enough they get up there they get through the king king looks out the window and he looks down and go oh well who's that girl down there who's that girl in there hey get her get get her up here get her up here so it's a man they scramble around bring them all into the king and and and and Abraham's under his breath saying remember what I told you yes yes yes so here comes here's Sarah amen and she says I I'm I'm his sister he says good because I want to marry you and if it had not been for the Angel of the Lord if it had not been for the angel of the Covenant the one who made the promise to Sarah and Abraham at the beginning was now here going to make sure oh come on Church you wonder you wonder if God forgot about your promise God's been right there with you the whole time keeping you the whole way God's leading you to your promise not now to your promise some of you feel like your destiny will never come some of you feel like God has totally forgotten about you God's not forgot about you God's putting you through the test God's putting you through the trial God sends you through these tormenting times he puts you those places but he's taken you to your destiny the angel of the Covenant is with you ready he tells him that night in a dream he says hey that's not your that's another man's wife he goes whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa she told me he said I know what she told you but I'm here to tell you that's not your woman that's his woman I've made a promise with him I'm going to raise up a a nation out of him and her well praise the Lord he says that's my prophet and I want you to return the man his wife and I want you to also have him to pray for you or I'll shut up the womb to the whole Kingdom can you say Amen can you say Amen you see God's word made flesh no church I say when we look at the intensity of God in this generation sin around the world seven times when we see the intensity of what God has done in our day I think it'd be her obsessed to entertain his presence honor love give him our everything he's doing something Supernatural today he's promised there would be a bride's Revival he said that there will come a church that will do the Greater Works we're in it he says now the word itself made flesh in you you are the reflection of this hour the mess of the reflection of it see you live again you live the life that was in Jesus you're in the presence of the son what happens to it what happens to the church finally listen the Chuck the Chuck pulls away from the wheat and what it gets to be man of May manifest what happens the life that was in the shuck went on out in the wheat the life won't change the carriers change they denominate the blades and the tassel and the shook but the weak cannot change it's got to be a Ministry just exactly on the word like he was on the word and like the first church was on the word spirit filled Spirit fed not denominational fat word fed and I say God let me be impregnated with your word [Applause] [Music] can you see math now you belong can I have a little more time you belong to a many membered body as the Bride of Jesus Christ the life of the plant is in you you are that matured we everyone get your finger point it to yourself and say I am the seed I am the matured wheat plant some of you is looking around and say does he know what he's talking about he don't even know me yeah I do you wouldn't be here you wouldn't have a desire you wouldn't be setting under the anointed word of the hour but what you've got to start doing is entertaining God's word instead of entertaining your condemnation foreign condemnation belongs to the serpency that is The Condemned seed you are the Fallen seed and you have been restored back you have been redeemed back can you say ma'am you can't condemn this Pride there's only one condemned seed and that is the serpent seed [Applause] now you might be in the same jail hell a jail cell with them but when the angel of the Lord shows up and says you don't belong in that in that denominational system you don't belong in the Creed you don't belong in the dog but you don't belong in the Cesspool of sin what happened God sent a message to you to come out of her my people that you receive not of her plagues [Applause] if you entertain the word of the Lord in your mind like you entertain that condemning Spirit you would be a lot further along [Applause] if you had received the word of the Lord that was spoke by the prophet of God you would be standing up chasing Giants right now [Applause] instead of letting that little old Beetle chase you around oh Hallelujah well I feel good about right now I I feel like I I feel like I like to just jump on some devils about right now Nana Boo Boo devil you ain't you've come way too late we are the church we are the bride the angel of the Lord has appeared to us given us that open book condemnation Hallelujah come on now this story comes to mind I remember some years back there was a girl that had been stolen or kidnapped from the hospital when when she was just a baby and and now that Mom and Dad had never given up and looking for and every year they were doing that and that FBI or whatever that and that digital thing there to what the girl might look like and every year they'd put it out and put it out and finally the girl's 12 years old and someone sees this image and says calls the hotline and said I think we just seen the girl and so they they go and investigate it sure enough they do the DNA test the girl belonged to this Mom and Dad Earl was not a good girl this this girl had known the the depths of perversion and sin she had been she had become quite a thief and become amen you see that the man that had kidnapped her had made her do a lot of evil things had her doing filthy things and had her had had her doing a lot of a lot of his evil work so the day come the day come when the when the the girl was going to meet the parent and they said little lady that's your mom and dad she looked she says that's not my dad she said that man there's my dad they said no no you see he kidnapped you from the hospital and and you belong to them and she says no I don't believe you I don't believe you she says he's my dad they said the DNA is here to show you that he the girl was so confused and she's trying to and then one gentle person stood up and said listen little girl your mom and daddy has still got a room for you your mom and daddy has has been buying new toys all along this man made you that evil person made you do filthy things made you he says won't you come home to your mom and daddy they won't make you do that anymore they love you you've got your own bedroom at their house I I want to tell you here God sent us a DNA God sent us a prophet with the word and said you never were the Serpent's children you never belong to the Serpent's house you always wear a son of God that is news from heaven oh Let Me Entertain if the angel is here don't let me say no no that's not me when the angel is saying you belong to him no no no no no no no oh but the holy spirit is saying yes yes yes this is who you are this is who you are come on Church hey man I want you to I want you to look at that devil right now and tell him I'm not listening to you anymore I'm going to entertain God I'm going to entertain his word I'm going to take his blood I'm going to take his spirit amen I think environment matters I think if you want the presence of the Lord you've got to create an environment that environment should not just be at the church house it needs to be at your home can you say Amen Fellowship should be wholesome ah I I like the they're in in Malachi the the third chapter right as it goes into the right as it goes into the fourth chapter man there in Malachi 3 and uh and it talks about the age talks about our age he says your words have been Stout against me saith the Lord yet ye say what have we spoken so much against thee ye have said it is vain to serve God what prophet is it that we have kept his coordinates and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts and now we call the proud happy and Yea they that work wickedness are set up and Yea they that tempt God or even delivered then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared him that thought upon his name are y'all hearing me a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared him and that thought upon his name and they shall be mine saith the Lord of hosts in the day when I make up my jewels I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him and then shall he return and discern between righteous and wicked between him that serveth God in him that serveth him not for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the Lord of hosts that it shall not leave them neither root nor branch and then you skippled them down and it says and ah but I will send you Elijah the prophet oh come on before that great that terrible day of the Lord are you hearing me I say Brotherhood is good oh oh there's something about there's something about when you're talking about the Lord how many knows the aims of the Lord knows when you're talking about him how many knows that that oh that old Spirit how many talked a little you know started talking about your problem or or started you know belly aching and then watch how many felt the spirit of Gloom come into that room brother Ron what the the greatest thing he had brother Ron was telling me uh he he's told me yesterday that the greatest thing that he has fought with that cancer was not the cancer itself was that Spirit of Oppression that came with that that was trying to bring him down but the Lord delivered you from that and that's how you're whipping this old devil that you're whooping come on foreign and I want to tell you he's coming up here preaching when he don't feel like preaching he's coming to church when he don't feel like coming to church he's getting up putting his britches on and getting out and doing things when he don't feel like it huh I've been with him in meetings Hallelujah and and we try to get him hey go take a nap you know go to Hallelujah he says Napster for old people amen hey we tried to don't overdo it brother Ron don't overdo it buddy I'm just here to enjoy myself Hallelujah what's what's what's you see the spirit of the Lord don't you know that the angel of God hears you when you are talking about his word Hallelujah be careful little eyes what you see be careful little lies what you see for the father up above looking down in Tender Love be careful little ears what you hear be careful little mouth what you speak be careful little mind what you entertain can you say Amen the book of remembrance is written for those who know how to entertain his presence I wonder tonight I wonder how many angels are in this building right now I wonder about the presence of I wonder how many of you are on the verge of a breakthrough I wonder whose son or whose daughter is fixing to come to the Lord because somebody has been entertaining his presence can you say math you see there's a and I I'm I'm winding it down I'm trying my best you guys are good you guys are fun people to preach to amen you've got a built-in receiver and somewhere up there there was a transmitter or I have one vice versa transmitter receiver any man I think the receiver's up there and this is the transmitter I don't know all I know is there's ain't no court okay you Fellers on the front row don't even remember what phones were when we had cords we could always tell where my sister was at just follow the court Hallelujah he had cords everywhere everyone had chords y'all remember how many you Elders remember the Chords chords on everything when I first started doing electrical my boys they don't even they they don't even use corded drills or nothing I said buddy all I've ever known was a quarter or in my early days was corded drills amen go do a house and I'd have to go steal someone else's electricity next door you know plug into there I repented chords but you see there is a connection they have found they have discovered that fourth dimension that fourth dimension there are sound waves coming through the building can you say mine you don't have to go to the radio station to hear your favorite song all you have to do is tune in with your receiver and you can hear your favorite song how many likes SM uh uh XM uh that that that huh Series XM 65 that that Christian station Hallelujah is anyone listen to that around here there's a few of you amen did you know that I listened to the same station 1200 miles away from you did you know when I go way up North I have driven although I've driven as far as you can go up in the in in in Ontario we're talking about as far up as you can go hey you can't and it's all dirt road and I could steal hear my music you know why because somebody tapped in to that fourth dimension if this little congregation right here tonight could understand that it's more than a preacher it's more than a church service it's it is the presence of God and when the brother Branham would stand there and declare he is here you couldn't see it but he could see it you had to believe it and he taught us how to enter into that prison can you say man oh my Spirits travel on words your eyes and your ears issue amen they they they they Usher Spirits into your soul songs Television Internet texts and people are not aware that they are subjected to Spirits on a daily basis by simply tuning into that junk with their phone and you wonder why you ain't got no faith it's because you are channeling demons into your mind [Applause] if you shut the channels off to those demons and put that same anointing of the Holy Spirit into your mind [Applause] if it worked for the prophet it'll work for you [Applause] what can you say Amen you sound like to have some scriptures okay First Corinthians 15 and 33 be not deceived evil Communications corrupt good manners well praise the Lord your thoughts the process of thinking the formation of opinions your thoughts is what you consider your thoughts is what you Ponder upon that's why he told Timothy Sean profane and vain babblings that will increase unto more ungodliness and their words will eat like a canker shut those Spirits off and entertain the presence of the Lord when you wake up in the morning time it's good to entertain him come on I was in a service and and it was my my time to preach the church was packed I was in the back Pastor would came out of the study and was coming down and then and and and all of a sudden a baby a a woman started screaming my baby his dad he's dead can't breathe he's and so she jumps up with all the musicians that everyone took off from under the back the whole everyone was coming and and and and the pastor I was I was the Evangelist you know I was just standing there and the pastor grabs me and then pushes me over you know pushes me out and and says you handle this that was that was the way that it was you know didn't tell me to handle it he just pushed put me out there Hallelujah so I said everyone stop everyone stop musicians go back play something Softly everyone go back to your seats the woman is screaming and the baby is is just black and blue and lifeless and they started singing and I said now let's pray and right there of me instantly the warmth came through went into that body the little boy stood up looked around at everybody was healed and never had no more problem what was it Satan was trying to come in and we were all fixing to entertain that devil that had just walked in the door but instead we refused to entertain him come on Church I said come on Church brother Sean's wife his first wife sister Rebecca when the when the kids were small which which one of you kids were down in the basement you you broke a broke a faith faith right there I've had her hand that's my niece right there that pretty neat that girl right there is my niece amen sister Faith there she was on a roller skates down in the basement and she fell was it your was it your arm she broke her arm that arm just went just I mean it was it was it was broke and sister Rebecca tried to call Brother Sean couldn't get a hold of him tried to call others couldn't get a hold and at first it was tough didn't know what to do but all of a sudden she stopped she says I am the master of this situation the presence of the Lord is with me she calmed the children down and they begin to pray and while she was praying her and the children was praying all of a sudden little faith she quit crying they opened their eyes that arm was just as straight as straight can be brother Jonathan y'all know brother Jonathan brother Jonathan Martin he was out there evangelizing and and and uh you know the the kids needed to run around Sister Laura went out I went into Walmart and so the kids were just out playing around in Littlefield and and and one of the boys had fallen and snapped his leg it was it went into a hole and snapped that leg and that leg just snapped and he thought oh no here we are I've got a I've got to be in at a service we're a long ways away from home and they prayed God came on the scene and set the leg you see entertain God and not experience the supernatural thank you but you've got to keep your channels clear are you understanding you cannot be inside them and have an entertaining the presence of the Lord you cannot be in two places are you young people listening to me this is not just for the old man this is for young people but you're gonna have to make up your mind I'm going to take my eyes off of all of Sodom and I'm going to walk with God can you see man wandering thoughts brother Branham talks about wandering thoughts amen curious thoughts exploring starts in the mind and then sin is conceived amen brother Brandon says the reason they do this is because they're not conscious that God is watching you lose the very thought of God being there listening at you God is putting down everything you're thinking about he knows it in his recording book your thoughts are louder in heaven than your voice is here on the Earth think the right thoughts can you say man now brother Branham says now we don't have any reverence to God you the musicians can come everybody thinks he's so secured they don't think reverent they don't reverent God like they should why do they do this because they're not conscience of his presence that's the reason people do that they don't recognize it they can't they can't comprehend that they're in the presence of God their minds become so con perverted and taken up in the things of the world until they don't even pay attention to it go to church sure realize that you're in the presence of God not only in a church wherever you are you're in the presence of God if they could do as David said I put the lord always before my face therefore I shall not be moved as long as the Lord was before him he could not be moved another place now I think the reason that people do those things is because they're not conscious of his presence yet he is there whether you think he is or not he sees every look you make every move you make he knows all about it but we ought to realize this am I making my point brother Branham in uh you know in discernment and he he says he says do you believe that you're in the presence in his presence that's what makes you feel that way something's vibrating over your spirit that you know being a Christian has to be the holy ghost or what this audience would only believe like you just now lady if this whole audience could believe for one moment you would see one of the greatest things happened there'd be a spontaneous wave of power hit this building here I speak in the name of Jesus Christ that's a prophet are y'all hearing me I I think about he says another place he said look at this woman standing here you want to be well lady if God will let you know what's wrong with you will you accept your healing you got stomach trouble that's right you go eat if if thou believes on the Lord Jesus amen God bless you all right the lady sitting right there looking at me elderly lady looked like like looked like everyone could see that now there's a light hanging over this gray-headed lady right right here she suffers
