you we certainly love you with all of our hearts thank you for your prayers for us in the meetings and and uh at Brother Kelly's and then at brother Tim's and of course I was with you on one night there somewhere or another and and uh we certainly had a wonderful time Heaven's going to be a place where we'll never depart from one another ever again and the thing that we find and as you well know is people just like you all over the world called The Bride of Jesus Christ and that's what this message has produced and so we certainly appreciate you and all that all that you done many of you were at the meeting last week at brother Tims and amen and our our saxs player was a star there and so we certainly enjoyed having her there each and every one of you Matthew he's back he's back nobody lik Matthew and so had a wonderful time with Matthew Matthew got on the stage there one time and amen we certainly someday we'll tell you all about it but uh we certainly enjoyed being there with brother Tim and brother Wayne and brother who else preached with me Kelly Kelly yeah amen well that happened day before yesterday so amen amen had a wonderful time and uh looking forward to tomorrow amen it's just just looking forward to that amen isn't he good to us amen we're coming down to the end of the line and we can see by the things that are happening in the world the world has become a tender box and it's getting ready to get on fire and there's some things that are going on where leaders are saying that this is the last war that will be taking place and so whether it is or not we realize that events begin to happen and they come right up against the Rapture and because of a predestinated seed God will back them off with the angels of the Lord amen one of these days he won't back them off and we just we just realized that we could be getting ready to go home here just in a very short time and so we we certainly want to be ready and and if there's anything that I can give you advice to be is like Moses instructed the children of Israel when you eat that lamb have your feet shot have your clothes on get your traveling clothes ready cuz we're going to be leaving eat that lamb commune with that lamb make sure that you eat it all residue burn it with fire the Death Angel is coming by and once it comes by there's going to be a spirit of the Lord that will cause pharaoh to harden his heart and tell you to go so I would say this to you we don't know when it'll happen that's right but have your shoes on have your shoes on don't put off coming to the Lord if you're a prodal come home come home come home and well brother Ron I'm ashamed to come back come home come on yeah you may be greasy and dirty but we got a blood that'll take care of that hallah well we got a blood and and and and you say well brother Ron i' I've send away my day of Grace you're still breathing so come home and come home and we'll we'll help you get there we hope you get there God bless you tonight and we certainly love you with all of our hearts and and um I hadn't I've been away a little bit and so Andrew instructed me to preach tonight so I'll try to do as good as Andrew does and so looking forward to shaking your hand tomorrow and and and uh uh enjoying some food with you always enjoy this time and I think it's important it's one of the important days that we have right because because we're going to a land where we're going to Fellowship through eternity oh what a day that's going to be and all be young there'll be no watches and be no hurry and so we're we're that's why we're trying to enjoy services like this to get ourselves ready to go amen if you turn with me to habca chapter 2 and then Psalms chap 118 and verse 22 habca chapter 2 and verse Two Brother Wayne Lawson he he actually used this on Sunday morning and I already had in my notes for tonight so if you accuse me of uh of copying brother Wayne that'll be okay too so amen what a powerful preacher amen habca chapter 2 and verse two amen and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he might run that readeth it for the vision is for an appointed time but the end but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it t wait for it because it will surely come it will not t Psalms 118 and verse 22 the stone which the builders refused is become the head of the corner and this is the Lord's doing and is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the Lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it I think it's important that we realize the moment that we're standing in God made this day to be exactly like it is and we can Rejoice because we're here save now I beseech thee Oh Lord oh Lord I beseech thee send now Prosperity Blessed Be he that cometh in the name of the Lord and we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord God is the Lord which hath showed us light buying the sacrif spice with cords even the horns of the altar Thou Art my God and I will praise thee Thou Art my God and I will exalt thee oh give thanks for unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever maybe of a need on your heart you just like to pray Lord Jesus we love you tonight and we're so thankful to be standing here again Lord we ask you that you would bless this audience as we stand stand here in your presence one more time we don't know we we Mark these moments and we we just ask you that you would help us strengthen us tonight anoint us Lord and may our minds just be clear to where we can just grasp the the word of the Lord touch our hearts now we pray in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen you may be seated I'd like to speak to you and and just start the subject no way can I cover it but I'd like to speak to you on time intercepting with prophecy sometimes when a when the voice of of God speaks through a prophet it may not fulfill itself while that Prophet is on the scene maybe it'll be hundreds of years the word will circle the Earth for literally 800 years or whatever it would be Behold a virgin shall conceive no doubt a lot of people thought well the message hasn't come to pass and so Isaiah's gone but you see everything has a time in a season and so there comes a time when the wheels of Prophecy will hit certain cogs and it will begin to fulfill we realize as the Bride of Jesus Christ we very much aware that we're reading tomorrow's newspaper we realize that just like when Jesus was on the cross from the time that they arrested him the Prophecies of the Old Testament begin to roll literally so fast you couldn't keep up with them that's right they begin to be fulfilled and Jesus would go through his life and say that it might be fulfilled that it might be fulfilled that it might be fulfilled and he would do do certain things because the word was quoting the word about himself and so brother Ram said he would look at the word to see what he must fulfill and so we realize that as the Bride of Jesus Christ being the final voice to the final age that we realize that we're literally right at the end of the age the layout of seal will go right on into the tribulation period but we realize that this bright age that we're living in is the maturity of the Bride is it's not an age it's an age within an age but let me just say this you it's a sign of the maturity of the Bride is here not just in this church but around the world Hallelujah and we're preparing for the coming of the Lord so what we are witnessing even among us we're witnessing fulfillment after fulfillment take place time has intercepted with prophecy so quickly brother man would say he said it's happening so fast out there on that desert he said it's accumulating so fast you can't keep up with it because the seals were being revealed so those are some of the thoughts that I want to I want to to share with you this evening brother bman says in countdown which is an important sermon he said oh God and he's praying just before he preaches oh God let us be counted worthy through the blood of Jesus no Meritus of our own do we claim but through his merits may we worthily to stand at that day as we confess our wrongs and desire to stand in his righteousness with the great Prophet Daniel and all those that who will stand when the records are given until then Lord make us instruments in your hand make us ears instruments this morning of the hearing of the word make my lips instruments to speak it for we ask it in Jesus name May our understanding understand the will of God I think that's a phenomenal prayer a phenomenal prayer you'll understand it more as we go now he would State make a statement I challenge you to believe that Jesus Christ is revealed in the form of the son of man in human flesh through the bride's body if we could ask ourselves challenge ourself may we see him even Among Us that's right brother Rand would use the term and he would go from science he would say that they they're saying be because there's an atomic clock which they call the end of the world and he said at that point in the late 50s early 60s said it was three minutes to midnight I I read an article the other day that said we're about 18 seconds before midnight brother Rand would make this statement he says now in shalom he said now good morning means peace darkness is gathering what's it gathering for to show light Isaiah 60 and verse one Rise and Shine for the light is come to you that's the reason I can say shalom the light has come to you God's peace to the elected woman to the elected lady those who God before the foundation of the world called out on and ordained to that I want you to just think once it was a thought with God then it was words with a prophet but you're said it in human flesh now and maybe there are times that you think well I'm not doing anything Supernatural Well maybe this service will help you with it you are the word living in flesh he says now the rest of them will never see it they'll never know nothing about it the Bible said so and Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draw him first and he said all that the father has given me will come God's not going to lose one he said when we see Darkness settling Darkness just before the day we know that the morning star is hanging Yonder to introduce the coming Sun that's when the Morning Star shines it's it's it's going between It's always darkest just a few minutes before the day the blackout comes the moon fails to shine the darkest before the day is because light is pressing the darkness but the Morning Star comes out and says good morning Shalom Hallelujah I like that don't you forgive me I just have several quotes I want to lay to you just to catch your mind he says he says now now in Shalom he says now the Symphony of God's Great drama that he's playing it changes him and he said his Symphony at is at the Junctions the composer and those who are interested I like how he says that the composer and those who are interested listen for the change so because we are [Music] interested we're listening for the change don't you love him he said God's great mystery he said it's a secret he had kept this secret nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it he didn't reveal it that's the reason under the Sabbath mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence Jesus when he was on the earth they wanted to know when he would come and he said it's not even the son himself don't know when it's coming think about that when it's going to happen see God has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason and there was silence in heaven for a space of a half an hour seven Thunders uttered their voices which you know that's the voice of God and he said and he said and John was forbidden to write it the coming of the Lord and he said that's one thing that hasn't been revealed as of yet when he will or how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't he has showed or even revealed it even in type that is in the Bible he said therefore the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ am and he says H I like brother Brams H the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible and all the acts of the Believers in the Bible has been a type amen an expressing of what God's Great goal is and now in this last age he has revealed it he's revealed it he saved it for you than Lord if you you think about all the schools and all the theologians and all of the trying to understand the code of the scriptures and the mysteries of God and God hid it from them God just hides it right in plain sight and he takes a little Kentucky preacher that's right with hardly any education with hand and totes and all different kind of things and takes him from a background that nobody would want to have a part of carrying water to a steel that didn't offend God that didn't offend God come down in a tree and said never never drink or smoke or defile your body I have a work for you to do where was the water going to a steel what was you doing when God spoke to you where was you at when God began to deal with you in your life I'll tell you most of us were lost and alienated from the kingdom of God but God rich in [Applause] Mercy we didn't even know who we were we just we just were trying to find something searching something out there was a deep that was calling to the deep and there was nothing in life that seemed to satisfy us right trying this and trying this and trying this and trying this but one day you heard an eagle scream and that eagle screamed over top of you and you said that's me the scripture says in second Peter chapter 1 verse 16 I think this is powerful how he says it for we have not followed cunningly devis Fables when we made known unto you the power and the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ but were eyewitnesses of his magesty for he received from God the Father honor and Glory when there was such a voice to him from the excellent Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard and when we were with him in the Holy Mountain we have also a more sure word of Prophecy that's when until you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place unto the day Dawn and the day star arising your hearts knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation man can interpret it God is his own interpreter God bless you brother John let me just say this you you can't make the word fulfill itself I don't care how high you jump you can't make the Rapture happen but it'll be right on time the resurrection you could go and call you could go call them call him out of the grave it'll never happen but one morning the dimensions will blend and S away and if I could say it right I believe we're closer than ever before I believe Two Worlds are coming together I believe it would cause a incredible incredible desperation in our heart if we knew how close we were Israel was just attack you would had to been in a hole somewhere to have not known that but they were attack we cannot describe the incredible horror that took place amen two forces they're both screaming for the same piece of property the Temple Mount it's an Esau Jacob deal their Heritage are screaming good people on both sides but somebody's going to fulfill the word of God terror is from the devil now now let me just say as the Bride of Jesus Christ we too are in a battle we too are in a battle for the Holy Land every promise in This Book Is Ours when men are taken away and this don't work no more and the days of Miracles has passed and this ain't for us and this ain't it's all for us every promise in this book is ours and we're in a spiritual war every one of us fighting against the darkness because remember the quote just said we're light pressing the darkness and so it's an enemy that would try to destroy Israel and destroy the people of God there remember they're God's people and and I want to just tell you they're they not going to [Applause] lose they're not going to lose now I got a further part of that you're not going to [Applause] lose that's right listen the critics say that Jesus never came on the Earth but he did the critics said that Abraham didn't own that property but but they've got the promises of the word of God and those Scrolls we own this I want to tell the devil we all miss this says that we're the Queen of Heaven this says that we're Sons and Daughters of God this says that greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world this says that we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them ande the Lord in the air that's what this says the last few days of quotes have came forth from incredible leaders that says that this is the war to end all wars maybe you should not have attacked us amen the gates of hell are now opened was a quote that was made by President Biden the other day thankful I can actually quote him he had met with gold in my ear literally days before Yan Kipper the young Kipper war and they were standing there knowing that the enemy was breathing down and the enemy is always trying to destroy Israel trying to destroy you personally and he was standing there beside of her and she made an incredible statement she said you see we have nowhere to go that's right we will never go back to those gas Chambers ever again that's right those threats continue to come to destroy them God help our brothers and sisters let me just let let us just remind ourself just for a moment that the the same God that spoke to Abraham can you count the sand of the sea it was too overwhelming he said no now he's standing there trious he said can you count the sand of the sea so shall thy seed be that's his natural seed and then he asked him to count the stars of the heaven and he said so shall thy seat be Now understand god'll never forget one of them and he'll never forget one of them and I don't care what the enemy does in that dark Forex of what he is capable of doing he can't win now I I just want to I just want to talk to you just for a little bit if that's okay yeah folks we're on a journey yes sir we're on a journey we're we're either destined for a body change or we're destined for a tribulation period the message has prepared us for the Rapture and identified us for the Rapture now you know you can't make yourself believe it right amen you can't make yourself believe it maybe even when you came in there were people that were friends of yours that came in with you but after a while they just kind of trickled off but something held you something held you and it held you because you can't hold on to yourself now I I want to explain to you what held you before you were born before the Earth was even created God deposited a seed on the inside of you before the foundation of the world so before you were even a thought in humanity you were in [Music] [Applause] God you say well brother Ron it just seems like every force from hell is trying to destroy you you ought to be praising the Lord and instead of giving yourself a pity party start worshiping God because Satan would destroy you if he could now you see we had a prophet that fulfill Malachi 4 5 and 6 God can't destroy the Earth until as he sends the the gentile people a messenger and that Messenger will call us call us out of denominational systems and call us not just to be a kingdom but call us back to the word it'll call us back to the word and we'll see ourself in the word the same as Jesus looked at the word to see what he must fulfill and maybe you're maybe this is one of your first times hearing this but listen Jesus knew the scriptures as Jonas was in the belly of the whale or hell so must the son of man be he was but look at the scripture said I will not suffer mine Holy One to see corruption based on Prophecy he could stand there and say destroy this Temple and in three days I raise it up [Applause] again he could stand and look at the word and say I am my father are [Applause] one he can look at Behold a virgin shall conceive and Jesus knew where he came from he wasn't part Mary and part God he was all [Applause] [Music] God are you with me now now God had to send a messenger no knowing that America had been raised up to fulfill scripture policeman of the world and she has done all of that she's been a she's been a power for Rome we see that we we can see the purple we can see the purple dress we can you know we can see Sodom among us and we can see the corruption in our government you know brother R said he could put an Abraham Lincoln and a George Washington in every County it wouldn't turn it around Billy Graham declared in the 90s he said America has went too far and there's no way back for it messenger of Sodom would make that statement I found it interesting I found that this week you see you see all of the prophecy that has been a foretold for all of these thousands of years is now literally happening in our lives and you say well brother Ron I'm a nobody well let me just mention a few nobodies there was a man named shamgar and Satan even remembers him there was a man named Joseph that told his brothers a a dream yeah and he told them about a kingdom rise and how he would be lifted up and how even the brothers would bow and in worship and then they they sold him for pieces of silver told a lie that he had been killed destroyed and he goes and he's in Egypt and they tell a lie on him he winds up in prison two men with him and he he tells their dream then he winds up and and he he fulfills the vision of even that pharaoh and he becomes to the right hand of pharaoh you'd never hear Joseph saying I'm portraying Jesus Christ but that's what he was doing God was prophesying in Joseph's life it's going to be good you just hang with me Joseph in a prison for years but he was fulfilling the word Joseph standing there and Haring all the Garners of Egypt and filling them full he was portraying Jesus Christ with his brothers com and and Benjamin comes and his father comes he was portraying Jesus Christ married to a gentile wife he was portraying Jesus Christ but nowhere does he say I'm living out prophecy he didn't have a book of Joseph David taking care of sheep doesn't realize he's fulfilling prophecy he doesn't realize God's got a vision it's going to come right through his life he's Ruddy he's red hair is red he's he's he's more of a handsome man than he is a warrior he's a he's a musician he's a musician and by his music and being in the presence of God it drives away demons War goes on and he comes with a sling not with an ecclesiastical vest not with some doctorate degree but he takes a sling and he picks up five smooth stones question came to me this week what about all these people that are being murdered and being destroyed isn't that horrible what's going on you need to read the scriptures God destroyed 85,000 in one day one day hail stones and five of those stones David picked up those stones had been used before and he picks up those five stones and it destroys Goliath David becomes king David becomes rejected a man walks up and spits in his face over and over again there's nothing more anything more reputable than you can do than to Hawk and spit in a man's face and one of David's men says let me have his head he said no let him alone that's right that's am on this is bigger than me and you that's right cuz Jesus would be spit in Jesus would be rejected and here he was a king that was being rejected nowhere do you hear him say I'm fulfilling the vision of what Jesus is going to be like amen I'm sure Jonah's Journey was pretty rough sister Jara he realized that as they were throwing things off of the boat for these men to be saved I have to say I become accountable I'm the man I'm the man and they throw him off of the boat yeah well God's got transportation for him he just had to get him off the boat he's got Transportation he created but it was a great well a great fish that's right he created a great fish and that great fish no doubt had a lot of seaweed in there because brother R said Jonah was covered in seaweed and Jonah it literally had an oxygen tin in it obviously cuz they're at the bottom of the ocean and God provides for him three days oxygen cuz first of all he's got to get Jonah right he's got to get him to repent for his own self-will he's got to getting prepared when you get on ground you got to preach what I'm telling you to preach some people don't understand brother brandham brother brandham was under the instruction of the angel of God he was not a political guy he was a messenger from the Throne of God to get you ready don't try to polish him up don't try to make it right just believe [Applause] it just believe it God had to get him to where he would say exactly what he wanted him to say Jonah found himself turning Every Which away because the scripture said if you could get your face toward the temple he'll hear your prayer and he would turn and turn and turn and turn to get himself toward the temple because he knew that he was now in a spot that he couldn't do nothing to help himself but being that Tarsus believed in a fish God it had to be an incredible sight when when this great fish rolls up on the beach and beaches itself and opens its mouth a prophet runs [Music] out oh what a paradox believe a sign ought to take that on for a while if they want something to do they ought to take that on for a while nowh does he say well I'm fulfilling what Jesus is going to be like Ruth did not know Esther did not know Tamar did not know Sarah did not know that they were typing [Music] you so look at your type look at your type you overcame then you'll overcome now each one of these played a part of the attributes of the coming Christ I don't know if you understand this or not but you're playing a part of redemption right now you're part of the vision of the open book if I can just come to you just a moment in the book of the Lamb's Book can I just type it just for a moment amen and it comes to a name called India Spencer Hallelujah now you can't see your name there but God knows you'll be there so he watched over your natural seed now I could have called 200 and something names here but I'm I'm calling her will you stay with me well that's your granddaughter well okay yeah is but God watched over her and there was nothing could to stop her from coming how many of you have let's just say on the internet have flought the enemy that said you're not going to make it well if God couldn't stop your getting here and God watched over all the way to get you here he knew that you would arrive so you're now the vision living now that don't make you stuff shirt or I'm so and so that ought to make you more humble than ever before we're none of us are anything without the grace of Jesus Jesus Christ so India we're a part of God's Vision God met him in a cave his message was to come out of her my people you made a journey to find truth God gave you a guide to lead you and guide you even when you couldn't see and when you come to the message you begin to identify where you came from and you realize that your family tree is not so important I want to hurt your feelings now some of us come out of some really rough stuff but they were just the natural but you came from God you came from God through your natural family you inherited a lot of bad stuff yeah but you actually came from God and this message tells you where you came from and because of the seed that's in you you go that's absolutely the truth that's right when other people go I don't like that I don't I can't stand that I don't like that and you go what's wrong with you can't you see acts 238 can't you see one God Amen Hey listen once you see Jesus Christ you can't see nothing else once you see you're a part of the word you can't see nothing [Applause] else go back what would I go back to brother randam I want you to remember time intercepting with prophecy these messages are more than just man's thoughts they are more than just man's thoughts this is more than just a conjecture of a man so the Angels meeting with him to deliver messages at certain times in chronological order and brother Bram would say you're not feeding on the mind of a man but you're feeding on the body word of the son of a man so you're not feeding on the personality of brother brandom but you're actually feeding on Christ the word now what that's going to do with you is you're not going to have brother brandom's nature and neither are you going to get my nature but the word deposited on the inside of you will produce Jesus Christ so brother random would walk out and he would begin to preach the way of a true prophet and then he would explain to us in the way of a true Prophet what a prophet's job is and he would take us back to Amos and he would talk to us about how Amos came and he narrowed his eyes at the sin and then later hundreds of years later Jesus would stand on the same Hill am he would preach a sermons and I'm just going to go through here what is the attraction on the mountain and brother Brandon would come and Jesus is fulfilling one prophecy after another go get the cult the fall of an ass it's got to be a it's got to be an animal that's never been rode by man before it can't be a denominational system got to be totally impossible for that animal to be ridden by natural man so for that animal that's never been rode on before to be totally quiet now I want to just think about this for a moment for Jesus to get on that animal yes sir and to ride in the chaos of people screaming and pulling leaves and throwing their coats down and hosana to the king there was an anointing hit in that area because the King was coming they would reject him and crucify him in a week but the king had arrived prophecy had been made flesh cost them to hush cost them to not worship if I do that the rocks will cry out Amen brother brm would use this statement he said prophecy was becoming history and he would also use that same type of statement when it come to Sunset after the seals were revealed prophecy is now history there will come a time when we leave the Earth that all the prophecy that is rolled and now you're living will change in the moment in the twinkle of an eye and all be his strength I think it's interesting that brother Brandon would preach godhead and revealed in Simplicity and he would explain who Jesus really is then he would preach the breach because now God was going to reveal the Mysteries to the Bride of Jesus Christ and the bride would be the only group that would hear it this is is going to the breach is between the church ages and their dispensations and the bride and only the Queen of Heaven is actually going to say that's a truth because in the seals it's going to expose who Satan is and it's going to expose the denominational systems and it's going to expose the mystery of iniquity that even is working amongst us and it's going to expose every evil spirit that there's ever been it's going to expose all of that but it's going to also reveal who you are are you with me are you staying with me I'm I'm sorry he would preach a sermon the Mighty God unveiled the very deity of Jesus Christ he's not three he's not two he's one I think it's incredible that brother brandham in in these incredible sermons would say it so simply until a child could understand it let me let me give you an instance I went to a play the other day he would say and he said it would be the same person playing different parts and he said they just changed their mask it's not a bunch of different gods it's a same God changing mask that's not too hard to see is it I love it how he says would you like to know how the world was created I'm going to paraphrase right now and he said the logos he said he spoke out of it and he said he believed his own word and he spoke let there be a son and the son came into existence you realize what a phenomena the sun is that's right one of these idiots said they were going to fly into the Sun Well try that out try that out I'm sorry I was I was S I was sitting in the doctor's office the other day getting shots in my knees and I I just heard a deal it was on the radio and I heard a deal that there was a man spending $2 million a year on health care and he was he was he was literally he was in his 40s and he said I'm going to live for immortality okay and he's spending $2 million a year on a team of doctors Brother Ray that's watching his organs and I'm just going to say it watching his release of his bowels and his water and making sure that his organs are working well he takes 111 pills a day I'm not doing any of that I'm not doing any of that but I'm going to live forever I've done got I've done come to a conclusion all brother on all that's Hocus Pocus well stick around maybe you'll see me just before I go maybe you'll see me just before I go I'm going to look younger than that guy right there take your glasses off Andrew that come here Andrew I'm going look a lot like this guy right here and he's not going to have any gray in it'll be all right [Applause] I'm going to get a body change that's right and if you can hear this voice it's going to be me but it's going to be the word living in human flesh well brother Ron I I well maybe I'll just catch you just for a few minutes maybe I can just tell you some things that you really will believe as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the coming of the son of man and he describes what the conditions of that age is do we have those same conditions sir as an ni as a fig Leaf putteth forth her budding leaves you know summer is night and brother brandham said keep your eyes on Israel that's your time clock and so she has been a nation now since about 46 48 that's right and God gathered them all back home he gathered them home there's hundreds and even millions are scattered throughout the Earth yet that's right who supports Israel but she has had her flag now this is the first time in 2500 years she's had her flag that's right there's a reason that she's there amen right God forced her to go home he forced her to go home and the whole world she went back to a land that nobody wanted her to have they still don't want her to have it is a fulfillment of Prophecy now you may not believe us but if you can if you're going to stay and miss the Rapture there's two prophets that are coming to they're coming they're coming and they're going to preach the message that you've heard except it won't be seals it'll be trumpets that's they won't be liked either but they'll be killed in the street but God raised them back up and let me just say there will be 144,000 believe the message in Israel so they're not going to lose this war brother Ron what do you make of hundreds of thousands of people going to the streets and protesting and all that it's the drums of the war cry it's the drums of the war cry prophecy is going to be fulfilled amen and people are getting under tribulation anointing that's right now can I get just a few more minutes when brother Brandon was on the scene King Jesus was here but King El was Presley King and he was anointed from the region of the darkness and rock and roll was just the Beatles came under that same inspiration those those people went under that same inspiration there was an anointing hit the world and the bop and the music begin to go because remember Satan is the is the song leader that was in heaven and so he uses music and Elvis Presley standing there had sold his Birthright he had been a song leader in his Granddaddy's Pentecostal church and felt the whole Holy Ghost but he perverted that gift and he began to sing but even in his concerts this is what fools a whole lot of people even in his concerts he could sing Amazing Grace and thousands of people could come under conviction and he would even stand there and weep and cry cuz he knew those two Dimensions women wouldn't satisfy his soul money wouldn't satisfy Soul drugs wouldn't satisfy Soul cuz he knew what reality was are you with me now that just shows you the influence of a spirit I don't know about you but sometimes I stand in awe of how corrupt our government has come in the last 15 years and listen no matter no matter if they were independent they're corrupt don't get your eyes on all of that all of that business brother brandham explains it to us it's of the devil you I know you guys live in the real world and people either want to talk sports or the natural world or they'll talk politics and you can sit in a restaurant we just did the other day Connie and I sit in a restaurant and people can get religious in a second cussing just a few moments ago and get religious in a second because of what's going on in Israel they can get religious in a second they can get into Political discussions and be friends and literally be in an argument you would think they hated each other what does that brother on but when Abraham Lincoln was here you know he was a mighty man he was a phenomenal man do you know that they tried to kill him 18 different times s on his way to the White House from Chicago he hired the pieron right to watch over him to get him he did not travel straight from Chicago to Washington cuz they would have murdered him he went through all different kind of routes to get him to Washington knowing he was going to be killed he said it over and over they're going to kill me yeah but we held his him as an incredible great man people don't want good [Music] people they don't want good people they don't want good people can I I'm I'm being simple but I'm just laying my platform for maybe next week they don't want clean television they don't clean movies are you with me people would rather worship a star in Hollywood or on a football field or a basketball field or a baseball and those people are not going to give you no money I got their hats but I don't get paid I got a Cod or two with the star on it but I don't get paid to where that thing and they can lose 42 to 10 I just go to sleep that's right does it upset your day no the whole that's said they're all lost why did why did you bring that up brother Ron people can get aggravated at people worshiping [Music] God and and tell you you got to calm down why what influence is causing you to want people to calm down well brother Ron when we get there we're going to dance on streets or go you ain't doing it here you ain't lifting and screaming your voice [Music] [Applause] here I believe in a balance I do too I really do but if people can go worship a ball game why can't we worship God with all that said I just want to make a real statement here with statements to try to stop people from worshiping that might offend me but what about offending the angel of God what about offending the angel of God so I would caution you cuz we're fulfilling prophecy here I'm sorry I just want to drop a couple more things here Revelations 101 is our day and we realize that that Revelations 10:1 is Christ The Mighty angel coming to this age that is the Heavenly Mighty Angel Revelations 107 is the Earthly messenger and they're both on the earth at the same time but the rest of Revel Gans 10 from 8 through is you eating the book living the word prophesying again so let me just say this to you we are participants of the rapture amen I don't think we can say it any better and scream any louder We Are The Living Word in flesh and Satan's done everything he can brother Charles to discredit it to destroy it to stop it to influence to distract us well how does he distract us if you're not careful you'll throw rocks at one another but if you can realize you're all on the same team you're all on the same team and if I took a picture tonight like God's going to take a panoramic picture where that Elton group I like that don't you so I'm going to I promise you I'm finishing with this thought so when I drove up in this afternoon I drove up a asphalt driveway you can be seated just for a minute I drove up an asphalt driveway I drove by our sign there's a waterfall there now I I drove around and there's a beautiful bank that's there and I drove around the church I just thought I I brother johnie I I saw you sitting out on the I just thought what a great thing to have you sitting on that on that bench out there and I thought you know I was sitting with brother Homer in a in the living room and he said I'm going to buy some property I'm going to

she would sing she sang to an empty church but do you know what happened relle and Paul walks in the back row and they sat down they had to think this a great big building that's great big building you know they're good preachers but ain't nobody here and they would come after we started and they would leave before we could get to them and we would go did you catch them oh no they're gone and they did that over and over and over again and I watched them when we all came back together look over here hallelujah you just have to smile at how God gets you here you you literally have to smile of how God collects his children how does it all fit in the plan of God you're living it out you're living it out but brother Ron I just get in a car drive to work I get in a car come to church I come

lose Paul how could we lose how could we lose if we were ever in in his mind Satan can't take us out Jesus's prayer father keep them John 17 keep them he wasn't just talking to the disciples he was talking about you and I want to say this as we end the service this evening we may face some difficult times as we get headed into the rapture we we might might face some very difficult times you just hang on Amen you just hang on it'll be worth it after all you mean brother Ron are you going to give me a difficult time oh no I'm not the one giving you a difficult I'm your cheet eater but the enemy
