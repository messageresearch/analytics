[45:35] the service but also for the wedding
[45:38] today and we're so looking forward to
[45:40] what brother Andrew has to bring forth
[45:43] this morning what a wonderful service we
[45:45] had with brother Isaac last night and
[45:48] and I just so enjoyed that isn't God
[45:51] good to
[45:53] us I'd just just like to say thank you
[45:55] for your prayers for me me over the last
[45:57] couple of weeks and and uh before we
[46:01] went to to Louisiana Youth Camp the
[46:05] Monday before on that Saturday before
[46:08] that we had begin to have some heart
[46:10] issues and I begged the cancer doctors
[46:13] to let me go to the camp and I told them
[46:16] I'd be a good boy and they wanted to put
[46:19] me in the hospital and they're good
[46:21] doctors they wanted to put me in the
[46:22] hospital to help me and run EKG and that
[46:25] didn't show anything but they knew the
[46:27] story was the story and so we went to
[46:31] Louisiana by God's grace we had
[46:33] incredible meetings on Saturday night I
[46:36] spoke over about an hour and a half and
[46:38] then we had a thre hour prayer line I
[46:41] don't know there was lot of you that was
[46:43] in that prayer line and you knew what
[46:45] what that was all about amen thank you
[46:48] Lord I didn't make it to the service
[46:49] till the next morning because it was
[46:51] just too weak and we got on an airplane
[46:53] that evening and I had a good day Monday
[46:56] and then on Tuesday morning I woke up
[46:58] and I was very I was very sick and then
[47:02] I I went to a doctor and kind of told
[47:05] him what was going on he said well you
[47:07] need to be seen I didn't tell Connie
[47:09] that but and then I went to we went to
[47:13] eat and uh then after that we had a
[47:16] couple of things to do when we were on
[47:18] our way home I said uh I think I'm going
[47:21] to need to be seen and and I said well
[47:23] maybe maybe we'll wait till tomorrow
[47:25] I'll get on the treadmill in the morning
[47:27] if I have trouble in the morning uh I'll
[47:30] let you take me to the doctor how many
[47:33] men are in the
[47:36] building I just described every one of
[47:42] you go ahead wives punch your husbands
[47:45] that's it's a
[47:49] truth the squad picked me up on on on T
[47:54] Tuesday and they took me to the hospital
[47:57] at AMC and then then we were there and
[48:01] as we were there and they begin to work
[48:03] on me they told me my EKG was good
[48:05] everything was looking good and then
[48:07] they pulled blood work and said we got a
[48:10] problem and then and then right while
[48:12] they were working Matthew was getting
[48:14] ready to go home had already started
[48:16] home and he had left about 10 minutes
[48:19] and then I had a massive heart
[48:22] attack the doctor told me on the way
[48:24] down to the to the
[48:27] to the cathb he said had this happened
[48:29] anywhere else you would be in real bad
[48:32] trouble and so God knows exactly where
[48:36] for you to have a massive heart attack
[48:38] at and so so we was an AMC and a couple
[48:41] stance were put in on there then they
[48:43] were nervous about working on the Widow
[48:46] Widowmaker and so they sent me to UVA
[48:49] and there we begin to be have work done
[48:51] on us again and God was just good to us
[48:57] and uh that's all I can say we've had a
[48:59] week of recovery I i' I've never known
[49:02] what this kind of weakness was all about
[49:05] but here we
[49:06] are and uh given time we'll be back on
[49:10] the battlefield again and so I'm just
[49:12] honored that I can be with you I'd like
[49:14] to thank you for your prayers thank you
[49:17] for God's mercy and his goodness to us
[49:20] brother horn we just don't know where

[49:28] we're doing now is we're we'll walk a
[49:31] we'll walk a bit and ride a little
[49:33] stationary bicycle a bit and rest a bit

[56:48] the Bible and begin to flip over and
[56:51] read through the book but Lord it takes
[56:53] you to reveal the very heart and the
[56:55] Very secrets of this book I believe that
[56:58] you have things in store for us today so
[57:00] father we commit this service into your
[57:03] hands in the name of the Lord Jesus
[57:06] Christ amen and amen if you have your

[57:14] 24 verse 34 and we again would like to
[57:17] say we welcome all of our visitors here
[57:20] and just want to make you feel as
[57:22] welcome as as possible and
[57:27] certainly excited for for this day and

[57:34] trend here and uh this is uh this is a
[57:39] pretty neat deal never done this before
[57:41] so but they they so desired to just to
[57:44] have the presence of the Lord and just
[57:46] kind of right behind the service here so
[57:49] you know what this might just it just
[57:50] might turn out to be something new here
[57:52] so it may not be for everybody but it's
[57:55] all right
[57:57] I like it so that's okay hopefully you
[58:00] like it so amen do you love the Lord
[58:02] today amen Genesis CH 24 and verse 34
[58:08] and the Bible said here and he said I am
[58:11] Abraham's servant and the Lord hath
[58:13] blessed my master greatly and he has
[58:16] become great and he hath given him
[58:18] flocks and herds and silver and gold and
[58:21] men's servants and Maid servants and
[58:22] camels and asses and Sarah my master
[58:26] wife bear a son to my master when she
[58:29] was old and unto him hath he given all
[58:33] that he
[58:34] hath notice what elzer is doing here
[58:37] he's laying out a foundation to
[58:39] Rebecca's family that all that Abraham
[58:42] has is because of the
[58:45] supernatural notice he said and my
[58:47] master made me swear saying thou shallal
[58:50] not take a wife to my son of the
[58:52] daughters of the Canaanites in whose
[58:53] land I dwell but Thou shalt go into my
[58:56] father's house and to my Kindred and
[58:59] take a wife unto my son and I said unto
[59:01] my master per Adventure the woman when
[59:04] not follow me notice he said and he said
[59:07] unto me the Lord before whom I walk will
[59:10] send his angel with thee and prosper thy
[59:13] way and thou shalt take a wife for my
[59:16] son of my Kindred and of my father's
[59:19] house may God bless his word he may be
[59:21] seated today in the presence of the Lord
[59:23] I'd like just to take a few minutes and
[59:25] speak to you on a thought today on a
[59:27] bride for Christ a bride for Christ and
[59:31] to me this this this book of Genesis
[59:34] chapter 24 is one of the most beautiful
[59:35] books most beautiful chapters in all all
[59:38] the Bible it begins to express to us the
[59:41] the greatest one of the greatest love
[59:42] stories and it's amazing to me that you
[59:44] can you can read all of Genesis chapter
[59:47] 24 and you can see the very message of
[59:49] the hour laying right there as God is
[59:52] calling out a body but the reason to me
[59:55] that it is so beautiful is because I
[59:58] don't just see Rebecca in the picture I
[1:00:00] see myself in the picture and I believe
[1:00:03] that if we can just take a glance back
[1:00:05] and as brother as brother Isaac would
[1:00:07] say last night just take a look again if
[1:00:09] we can just take a take a look into the
[1:00:11] holy word of God we can really see and
[1:00:14] capture the very Mind Of God by
[1:00:16] Revelation and we know that what we see
[1:00:19] in the natural is a type of what we are
[1:00:21] seeing in the spiritual as well brother
[1:00:24] bandam said if you want to see where the
[1:00:25] church is at he said look where women
[1:00:27] are at and you watch the conduct of
[1:00:29] women and you see them but you're
[1:00:30] watching what is happening right now
[1:00:33] amongst the body of Jesus Christ it's a
[1:00:35] it's it's telling us of what is
[1:00:37] happening in the very Mind Of God
[1:00:39] because William Brandon would tell us in
[1:00:41] the Christ the mystery of God revealed
[1:00:43] he said God had in the back part of his
[1:00:45] mind he said he had something that he
[1:00:47] was going to try to do that he was going
[1:00:49] to achieve he had some motive that he
[1:00:51] was going to do he said in God was all
[1:00:54] of these attributes attributes of father
[1:00:56] attributes as a son attributes as a
[1:00:58] Healer he said but in him was love and
[1:01:01] all of these great attributes that we
[1:01:03] see today all of those attributes were
[1:01:06] in God and they were expressed they were
[1:01:08] in God but now they are expressed but
[1:01:12] this we know that God does not have new
[1:01:14] thoughts towards you and I God's not
[1:01:16] trying to fall in love with you god
[1:01:19] already loves you he already loves you
[1:01:22] he's not trying to figure out any many
[1:01:25] Mighty Mo
[1:01:26] choose one here or there but God knows
[1:01:28] exactly the one that he selected before
[1:01:31] the foundation of the world and we know
[1:01:34] that that the prophet would come and he
[1:01:36] would preach a preach a message on a
[1:01:38] choosing of a bride and in there brother
[1:01:40] Brandon would lay out some very powerful
[1:01:42] things that all of our life they it has
[1:01:45] choices in it the way of life it's a
[1:01:47] choice it's we have a right to make our
[1:01:49] own way we we choose our own way that
[1:01:51] the way that we want to live he said
[1:01:53] education is a choice right and wrong is
[1:01:56] a choice your Eternal destination is a
[1:01:59] choice he said but there's another
[1:02:01] choice that we have in life and he said
[1:02:03] that's a life's companion he said a
[1:02:05] young man or a young woman that's
[1:02:07] stepping out of life has been given a
[1:02:09] right to make a choice he said that
[1:02:11] young man chooses the young man woman
[1:02:14] the young woman has a right to accept or
[1:02:16] reject it but it's still a choice on
[1:02:19] both sides both man and woman they have
[1:02:22] a right to make a choice and there we go
[1:02:25] all the way back back into the Garden of
[1:02:26] Eden and you can see that when when God
[1:02:29] created man that man was made there he
[1:02:31] was made in the very image of God and
[1:02:33] there there we recognize that there he
[1:02:36] was all by himself and God saw him he
[1:02:39] saw that he was walking in him but there
[1:02:41] was something on the in on the inside of
[1:02:43] God that he was wanting to express
[1:02:45] through his man Adam he was wanting to
[1:02:47] express something because if God did not
[1:02:50] have it on the inside of him he would
[1:02:52] have never expressed it through Adam but
[1:02:54] he was looking for a wife that he could
[1:02:56] call by his own name so he caused the
[1:02:59] Deep Sleep to come upon Adam and out of
[1:03:02] Adam he brought Eve and there Adam would
[1:03:05] call her the woman of life he would call
[1:03:07] her and say now she is now bone of my
[1:03:09] bone she's now life of my life my
[1:03:12] brother Brandon would say he said now he
[1:03:14] said but God God Adam did not have a
[1:03:16] choice in this matter he said he didn't
[1:03:18] have a choice in this matter because God
[1:03:21] gave him that woman he gave him that
[1:03:23] woman he said and you seen IM me imately
[1:03:26] what her character was when she turned
[1:03:28] down the word of God and her motives was
[1:03:30] turned over to reasoning and turned down
[1:03:33] the headship but I'm so grateful to know
[1:03:35] that in this hour that there is a second
[1:03:38] Eve that has chosen a different headship
[1:03:40] and her headship is not her knowledge
[1:03:42] but it is the intellectual properties of
[1:03:44] almighty God that she is completely not
[1:03:47] led by and persuaded by reasonings and
[1:03:50] intellectual modern ways but this Lady
[1:03:52] of Grace is led by the very Spirit of
[1:03:55] almighty God and we recognize that if he
[1:03:58] was the word then this church this bride
[1:04:01] has got to be a bride of the word is
[1:04:03] that right because in the beginning was
[1:04:04] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:04:07] the Word was God but you go down in
[1:04:09] verse 14 and then the word was made
[1:04:11] flesh so if he was the word in the flesh
[1:04:14] then this bride's got to be the word in
[1:04:16] flesh is that right now notice what he
[1:04:19] says to us in the church age he said
[1:04:21] Jesus Christ is choosing his own bride
[1:04:24] just the same as men choose their Brides
[1:04:27] today he said the bride today does not
[1:04:29] simply decide that she's going to take a
[1:04:32] certain man or for a husband no sir it
[1:04:34] is the groom who decides and chooses a
[1:04:37] certain woman for his bride because the
[1:04:40] Bible said in John 15 and 16 you have
[1:04:42] not chosen me but I have chosen you now
[1:04:46] according to the word of God the bride
[1:04:48] was chosen before the foundation of the
[1:04:50] world this choosing of the bride was
[1:04:52] purposed in himself Ephesians 1 and9 and
[1:04:56] Romans 9 and11 says that the purpose of
[1:04:58] God according to the election might
[1:05:01] stand he said you can't read it any
[1:05:03] other way to me it's a very powerful
[1:05:05] thing you can't read it any other way
[1:05:07] that the purpose of God according to
[1:05:09] election might stand now notice what he
[1:05:11] says he said the heart purpose the
[1:05:14] Eternal purpose of God if you want to
[1:05:17] know his heart if you want to know God's
[1:05:19] heart he said notice the heart purpose
[1:05:22] the Eternal purpose of God was to take a
[1:05:26] bride of his own choosing this bride is
[1:05:29] not man chose She's Not Elected by some
[1:05:32] board but she is chosen out of the very
[1:05:35] mind of almighty God and that choosing
[1:05:38] that his purpose was in himself being
[1:05:41] Eternal was decreed before the
[1:05:43] foundation of the world we did not
[1:05:45] become seed by the rebirth we were seed
[1:05:49] therefore we could be reborn so let me
[1:05:51] say it to you like this in a greater
[1:05:53] magnitude before re Becca ever got down
[1:05:56] there to the whale she was already chose
[1:06:00] before she ever watered the animals she
[1:06:02] was chose before you fell in sin you was
[1:06:05] already elected before you had mistakes
[1:06:08] you was already chosen before you got in
[1:06:10] drugs you was already chosen you may
[1:06:13] have not look like the elect at one
[1:06:15] point of your life but because the genan
[1:06:18] seed of God was deposited on the inside
[1:06:20] of you he chose you because of that seed
[1:06:23] and he draws himself I want to say it to
[1:06:26] you this morning that this Supernatural
[1:06:29] presence has put you in position for the
[1:06:32] wedding that has taken place it's
[1:06:35] without the presence of the Lord that
[1:06:37] every meeting is just a protracted
[1:06:39] meeting but this Supernatural presence
[1:06:41] of the Angel of the Covenant has put you
[1:06:44] in position let me put it in other terms
[1:06:47] this is a pre-arranged marriage let me
[1:06:49] put it to you a little bit clearer this
[1:06:51] is a predestinated marriage you didn't
[1:06:54] set this up it daddy didn't choose you
[1:06:56] your mama didn't choose you but almighty
[1:06:59] God chose you before the foundation of
[1:07:01] the world just like the angel was
[1:07:04] directed to go down there and directed
[1:07:06] Phillip to go down there and preach to
[1:07:08] the unic it was the Angel's job to
[1:07:10] direct him but it was Philip's job to to
[1:07:13] direct The Germ seat of almighty God and
[1:07:16] just like the angel was leading elaser
[1:07:19] Hallelujah just like he was leading
[1:07:21] elaser it's that same angel that was
[1:07:24] directing elzer but it was elaser that
[1:07:27] begin to drop in the very secrets about
[1:07:30] Isaac he told him that these are modern
[1:07:33] Vince made clear by prophecy he she
[1:07:35] begin to tell him about leadership she
[1:07:37] begin to tell him he begin to tell her
[1:07:39] about his future home that he's made for
[1:07:42] his Earthly bride but the Heavenly
[1:07:44] bridegroom and she be to tell him about
[1:07:46] the token that'll be placed over your
[1:07:49] life what was it elaser knew elaser knew
[1:07:53] when he had a conversation with Abraham
[1:07:55] and he put his hand underneath of his
[1:07:57] thigh elaser had the assurance that the
[1:08:00] angel was going before him then he could
[1:08:03] decide to go because he had something
[1:08:06] that was there to back him up and I
[1:08:08] believe that every Christian every man
[1:08:10] of God every preacher if they can come
[1:08:12] to a spot where they re where they've
[1:08:14] reached and met a met an acquaintance
[1:08:17] with the angel of the Lord they got
[1:08:19] every assurance that the angel has went
[1:08:21] before them you can stand there in the
[1:08:24] face of criticism and you can stand
[1:08:26] there because you've got a job to do and
[1:08:29] that's to get Christ to wife it doesn't
[1:08:31] matter if you're a if you're a janitor
[1:08:33] your job is to get Christ a wife it is
[1:08:36] your job as a minister to stand there
[1:08:38] and preach and get God a wife and God is
[1:08:41] not wanting something of the world he's
[1:08:43] not want something that that looks like
[1:08:45] the world that dresses like the world
[1:08:47] he's wanting a woman that's got the kind
[1:08:50] of character that matches his character
[1:08:53] she's bone of his bone she's life of his
[1:08:55] life she's power of his power her
[1:08:58] Hallelujah her attention is his
[1:09:00] attention her ideas are his ideas and
[1:09:04] when elaser knew that the angel was
[1:09:06] going before him Abraham the father the
[1:09:10] father of Isaac begin to load down the
[1:09:13] camel train with all of the blessings
[1:09:15] that he was not going to pour out on
[1:09:17] denominations but he was going to pour
[1:09:19] them out on the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:09:22] let me say this to you there is not
[1:09:24] something that elaser was packing that
[1:09:27] was for another woman but what elaser
[1:09:30] was packing was for this Rebecca it was
[1:09:33] not for the other Church ages it was not
[1:09:35] for the other Generations but this woman
[1:09:38] Hallelujah elaser didn't tell her now
[1:09:41] honey this is for another day this is
[1:09:43] for and this is for another hour but he
[1:09:45] be to pour out that Isaiah 53 is for you
[1:09:49] he begin to pour out that Isaiah 54 no
[1:09:52] weapon that is formed against you shall
[1:09:54] prosper
[1:09:56] what did he do he did exactly like the
[1:09:59] Song of Solomon would say that he
[1:10:02] brought me to his banqueting house and
[1:10:05] His Banner Over Me Is love you study
[1:10:08] that out you study that out you begin to
[1:10:10] see he didn't just bring her to any
[1:10:12] house he brought her to the house of
[1:10:15] wine what did elaser do he brought her
[1:10:18] to a wine of stimulation of Revelation
[1:10:22] that would take her into a realm that
[1:10:24] she can't expl expain on her own what is
[1:10:26] it it's a supernatural message that
[1:10:29] draws the attaction of the attraction of
[1:10:32] the Bride to the
[1:10:34] bridegroom what was it when El eer was
[1:10:37] watching what was he doing he was
[1:10:38] watching for character he was looking
[1:10:41] for character and when he saw her down
[1:10:43] there at the well when he done made a
[1:10:45] supernatural call and he seen her down
[1:10:47] there and she begin to begin to do his
[1:10:51] very prayer begin to act out the very
[1:10:54] prayer of elaser what was it brother
[1:10:56] brandom said it showed that she was
[1:10:59] willing to go before she ever spoke a
[1:11:02] word her actions showed that she was
[1:11:05] ready to go and before you go in a
[1:11:07] Rapture your actions are going to show
[1:11:10] that you're going in a Rapture what was
[1:11:12] it she had character that she was
[1:11:14] willing to surrender her own power her
[1:11:18] own energy over to his power to his
[1:11:22] anointing and that's one thing that God
[1:11:24] has always counted his character
[1:11:27] remember mam said the elaser sweated it
[1:11:29] out until he found character he said
[1:11:32] character for Isaac the bride which the
[1:11:34] church is a type of he said you know
[1:11:37] that he said that was the natural seed
[1:11:39] Abraham he said but this is the Royal
[1:11:41] Seed of Abraham he said well if elaser
[1:11:44] the messenger was hunting out the bride
[1:11:46] and trying to find character he said if
[1:11:49] that man has come a messenger of this
[1:11:51] last day trying to find the bride for
[1:11:53] Christ he will not look look in a
[1:11:55] denominational membership he will look
[1:11:58] for character that's willing Watch God's
[1:12:02] character first then get her ready to
[1:12:05] meet Isaac and after he had found the
[1:12:07] character then he get her to stand still
[1:12:10] long enough to listen to the message of
[1:12:13] Isaac that shows what kind of character
[1:12:15] that you are that you stood still long
[1:12:18] enough to let the message of the hour
[1:12:20] wash you wash you of traditions wash you
[1:12:24] of ideas what is it it's a union that's
[1:12:27] taking place that's what God's looking
[1:12:29] for somebody that'll adhere to the word
[1:12:32] of God somebody that'll listen to it
[1:12:34] you're not just wanting some man's not
[1:12:36] just wanting he's not just wanting any
[1:12:38] type of woman he's wanting a woman of
[1:12:41] Grace and if you see a man choose that
[1:12:44] type of woman it shows what's on the
[1:12:46] inside of that man if he chose if he
[1:12:48] chose some Jezebel if you chose some
[1:12:50] worldly worldly thing it shows what's on
[1:12:53] the inside of a man but if you see a man
[1:12:55] choose somebody that is fit fit by the
[1:12:59] message of the hour it shows the very
[1:13:02] character of that man that is laying on
[1:13:04] the inside of him you remember when
[1:13:06] brother randam when he said I was going
[1:13:08] to take a walk and I was going to go
[1:13:09] check on them couples I was going to go
[1:13:11] check on them couples that I'd done
[1:13:12] married and one was up there on that
[1:13:14] hill and he said they didn't have to
[1:13:15] work for their money they didn't have to
[1:13:17] do anything they' inherited all their
[1:13:18] money he said so I thought I'd just walk
[1:13:20] up there he said I went up there to that
[1:13:22] great big old mansion and he said there
[1:13:24] I was was he said I stood out there and
[1:13:27] he said there there was a bickering on
[1:13:28] the outside he said they was fussing
[1:13:31] because they had went to a dance the
[1:13:32] night before and she'd got into the arms
[1:13:34] of another man and he was upset about it
[1:13:37] and when brother Brandon went and
[1:13:39] knocked on the door there they came and
[1:13:41] ran and they was holding each other's
[1:13:42] hand said howdy brother brandom oh yeah
[1:13:47] what was it brother random said it was a
[1:13:48] paint in fire what is it a paint of fire
[1:13:51] is a is a deception it's showing you
[1:13:53] it's for days gone by and he'll never
[1:13:55] get warmed by it again he said what was
[1:13:58] it it was a put on now I know good and
[1:14:00] well you Brothers don't want some put on
[1:14:02] you want a woman that you get home at
[1:14:04] night that's a real thing is that right
[1:14:08] so brother Adam said I took a walk he
[1:14:10] said and I walk down that hill and he
[1:14:12] said I'd married another couple and he
[1:14:14] said I walked down there and he said
[1:14:16] they didn't have much money he said but
[1:14:18] they had a box car he said they made a
[1:14:20] box car their home he said there they
[1:14:22] was they took those tacky buttons and
[1:14:24] put it up there he said' and they didn't
[1:14:25] have much money and they counted out
[1:14:27] their money here and there brother horn
[1:14:29] and said this one's for that this one's
[1:14:30] for that he said but honey I so longed
[1:14:33] to get you that dress down there that's
[1:14:35] hanging in the shop she said honey I got
[1:14:37] a good dress and he said the question
[1:14:40] came to me William brandom who is the
[1:14:42] rich one in the picture let me ask you
[1:14:45] Brothers if you got all the money in the
[1:14:47] world but your wife can't live to the
[1:14:49] message what do you
[1:14:51] have I don't believe that we ought to
[1:14:53] try to offer ourselves up to Jes Jesus
[1:14:55] Christ as some halfway woman but we
[1:14:57] ought to dress oursel fully in the
[1:15:00] message of the
[1:15:04] hour when you go to choose a
[1:15:07] wife you see really what's on the inside
[1:15:10] of that man we really didn't know what
[1:15:13] was on the inside of brother Chester
[1:15:16] until we seen when he chose sister
[1:15:19] Hannah but it showed the very character
[1:15:23] of the bridegroom when he chose the
[1:15:26] bride and when you choose a wife you are
[1:15:29] wanting a woman that can match your
[1:15:33] life you want a woman that'll match your
[1:15:36] goals you want a woman that'll match
[1:15:38] your intensity you want a woman that'll
[1:15:41] match your passion you want a woman
[1:15:43] that'll match your motives you want a
[1:15:45] woman that'll match your future you want
[1:15:47] a woman that'll match your goals you
[1:15:49] don't want to have two heads in a home
[1:15:51] you want a woman that'll look the part
[1:15:53] that'll dress the part that'll be the
[1:15:55] part that'll dress herself in Hallelujah
[1:15:59] in front of the world that'll dress
[1:16:01] herself as a body of Jesus Christ and
[1:16:04] when nobody's looking she'll dress
[1:16:06] herself like the body of Jesus Christ
[1:16:08] and when elaser was looking for that
[1:16:10] type of woman he prayed a certain prayer
[1:16:13] and when Rebecca come down there brother
[1:16:15] manham said that the angel of the Lord
[1:16:18] was up there wooing on Rebecca's heart
[1:16:21] before she ever came down to the whale
[1:16:24] she made a marched down there but why
[1:16:26] did she go to the whale Sister Barbara
[1:16:28] she went down there because the angel
[1:16:31] was directing her to go by the whale why
[1:16:34] do you love this message so much you
[1:16:37] didn't get here on your own there was an
[1:16:39] angel that woed you to the Waters of
[1:16:43] Life hallelujah what was it when she got
[1:16:47] there she matched the
[1:16:51] message let me say this to you when you
[1:16:54] get there when the Rapture takes place
[1:16:56] there's going to be no trimmings taking
[1:16:58] place God's not going to have to cut off
[1:17:00] lust off of you God's not not going to
[1:17:03] have to cut the world off for you you
[1:17:05] are being judged right now the word of
[1:17:08] God is cutting every excess of the
[1:17:10] things of life off of you because he
[1:17:12] wants a wife that looks like him a woman
[1:17:16] that dresses like him a woman that
[1:17:18] speaks like him a woman that acts like
[1:17:21] him and it's the angel of the Lord that
[1:17:24] begin to call to
[1:17:26] her and brother maram said now notice
[1:17:29] this he said why didn't them other woman
[1:17:32] come down
[1:17:34] there the call was made the prayer was
[1:17:38] made but why didn't the rest of them
[1:17:40] women come down
[1:17:42] there brother Ram said it was because
[1:17:45] they weren't blood
[1:17:48] relation that shows right there why you
[1:17:51] were able to come to this hour come to
[1:17:53] this message is because you're a blood
[1:17:55] bought body of Jesus Christ you're led
[1:17:58] by the very spirit of God and it's a
[1:18:00] connection coming together it's a union
[1:18:04] that's coming together today that the
[1:18:06] born again the Holy Ghost filled people
[1:18:09] is connected with God are led by the
[1:18:12] Holy Spirit what is it what draw you to
[1:18:15] this attraction that is taking place on
[1:18:17] the
[1:18:17] mountain it's somebody that has chose
[1:18:21] you before you chose yourself
[1:18:25] you didn't make yourself the bride he
[1:18:28] made you the
[1:18:29] bride because when he slipped on the
[1:18:32] wedding band of unmerited Grace upon
[1:18:35] your finger it showed right
[1:18:37] there brother random was asked a
[1:18:39] question will the bride go in the
[1:18:41] Rapture he said oh that's easy
[1:18:45] yes it's for you let me tell you the
[1:18:48] wagon wheels are rolling down the street
[1:18:52] and it's for you it's not for everybody
[1:18:54] else it's not for the people that think
[1:18:57] they're in it it's for you you have
[1:18:59] spent the last year of your marriage of
[1:19:02] your engagement preparing yourself
[1:19:04] dressing yourself and I know there's a
[1:19:06] lot of people that's ridiculed you
[1:19:09] because of the way that you've dressed
[1:19:10] yourself but when it come to the last
[1:19:13] day when when the when the when the
[1:19:15] Rancher's son when he told her I'm
[1:19:17] coming back on this day for you she
[1:19:20] prepared herself she dressed herself and
[1:19:23] the dress fit her perfectly Al she'd
[1:19:25] been working on it and it looked just
[1:19:28] right it looked just right Hallelujah
[1:19:32] and he came not for the scoffers on the
[1:19:35] porch but he came for this Lady of
[1:19:38] Grace brother bam said it's just like
[1:19:41] it's just like there when the angels
[1:19:44] that are seen on Jacob's Ladder
[1:19:46] ascending and descending he said it's
[1:19:48] kind of like that drama what is it he
[1:19:50] said Romeo and Juliet he said what is it
[1:19:53] he said them Ang are coming down he said
[1:19:55] the ladder set up against the wall and
[1:19:58] he said he comes over there and
[1:20:00] says I'm here for you
[1:20:03] honey this message attracted you this
[1:20:07] message called you this message the
[1:20:10] reason the very idea that the message
[1:20:13] came by your way ought to signal to you
[1:20:16] that you are somebody more than just
[1:20:18] another lady it's a sign to
[1:20:22] you that you are she let me say this to
[1:20:25] you when you meet him you will not be
[1:20:30] disappointed you won't be disappointed
[1:20:33] because elaser has done such a great job
[1:20:36] he's give you 1,00 sermons he's laid in
[1:20:39] Revelations and secrets and Mysteries
[1:20:42] all about your Isaac and you won't be
[1:20:44] disappointed when you come down to the
[1:20:46] Altar and I want you to know when you
[1:20:48] come to the altar with this Lord Jesus
[1:20:51] he's not going to be a runaway groom
[1:20:53] he'll be right there to catch you he'll
[1:20:55] be right there waiting on you let me
[1:20:57] tell you get yourself in trouble this
[1:20:59] groom will be right
[1:21:00] there he will be your protection he will
[1:21:03] be your God and he throws a veil off of
[1:21:07] you and shows that I'm your head now I'm
[1:21:11] your protector I'll take care of you
[1:21:15] that's what is taking place in this
[1:21:17] building today you're going to see it in
[1:21:19] the natural but that's what taking place
[1:21:21] in the spiritual it's a change of
[1:21:24] headship that is taking place you no
[1:21:26] longer take your thoughts but you say
[1:21:29] let this mind be in me which was in
[1:21:31] Christ Jesus it's a transition of your
[1:21:35] headship to his headship and I want to
[1:21:38] say that the headship has found a body
[1:21:41] that he can fully rest himself in notice
[1:21:44] verse 63 and Isaac went out to meditate
[1:21:48] in the field at evening time and he
[1:21:51] lifted up his eyes and saw and behold
[1:21:54] the camels were coming and Rebecca
[1:21:57] lifted up her eyes and when she saw
[1:21:59] Isaac she lighted off of the
[1:22:03] camel this word light it off it means to
[1:22:07] accept she fell down from herself and
