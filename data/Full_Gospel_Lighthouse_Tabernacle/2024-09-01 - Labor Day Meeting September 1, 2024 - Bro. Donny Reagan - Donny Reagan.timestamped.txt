[54:09] praying for our daughter Erica I know
[54:12] that you did so many times to her
[54:15] sickness and we're so thankful for that
[54:18] we appreciate
[54:19] that 45 years ago today I took Carol to
[54:24] the hospital
[54:26] about 22 hours later our little
[54:31] second child was
[54:33] born her name is Erica
[54:36] [Music]
[54:38] Lee the Lord Jesus Eng graced us with
[54:41] her in our life and we're so thankful
[54:43] for
[54:47] that but he decided he wanted to call
[54:49] her
[54:51] home and I'm just so thankful that I was
[54:54] able to lead her to the Lord and preach
[54:58] a message that one day we're going to
[55:00] meet her
[55:02] soon amen that's the hope we
[55:05] have if it's only good in this life what
[55:08] good does it do us that's right so
[55:12] tomorrow will be her birthday and um
[55:15] we're plan on getting together with our
[55:16] family so we certainly appreciate you've
[55:18] remembered us if you would also speaking
[55:21] of birthdays today is brother Andrew
[55:23] Spencer's birthday
[55:24] [Music]
[55:25] [Applause]
[55:35] on Tuesday will be brother Tim PR's
[55:39] [Music]
[55:44] birthday praise the
[55:47] Lord let's turn if you would to the book
[55:49] of numbers um chapter
[55:52] 13 I didn't brother Timothy and brother
[55:55] Tim just do an awesome
[55:58] job
[56:04] wonderful as a minister whenever you're
[56:07] preaching in in a meeting such as this
[56:10] you
[56:11] always no matter whether you're at home
[56:14] if you're a pastor or whether you're out
[56:16] there's one thing that always presses on
[56:18] your heart and that is to find the mind
[56:22] of the Lord for the service because
[56:25] there's so many things you could say so
[56:28] many things that you could bring to the
[56:30] people of God and all of them truth of
[56:33] course but you also know that there may
[56:36] be people there
[56:38] that's facing suicide amen facing
[56:42] disease facing such catastrophic news in
[56:46] their
[56:46] homes and you want to be so sensitive
[56:50] that the spirit of God will help you
[56:52] that you'll be able to say something
[56:54] that will help them so I noticed after
[56:57] the first service brother Timothy it I
[57:00] felt like caught the mind of the
[57:02] Lord that these meetings this year were
[57:05] going to be a little bit different than
[57:07] any that I'd participated in before up
[57:10] here and brother timc come along the
[57:14] same lines and I'd studied something
[57:17] that um I wanted to bring to you but
[57:21] after after those two Services I just
[57:23] felt to go a different way
[57:26] uh so I trust that it'll be a blessing
[57:29] to you
[57:30] today numbers
[57:33] 13:31 but the men that went up with him
[57:37] said we be not able to go up against the
[57:41] people for they are stronger than
[57:44] we and they brought up an evil
[57:48] report of the land which they had
[57:51] searched into the children of Israel
[57:53] saying the land through which we have
[57:55] gone to to search it is a land that
[57:58] eateth
[58:00] up the
[58:02] inhabitants
[58:03] thereof and all the people that we saw
[58:08] in it are men of great
[58:13] stature now I know you read your Bible
[58:16] and you're very familiar with the
[58:17] scripture and I'm sure you know these
[58:20] people were
[58:22] lying come
[58:24] on they were not telling the truth
[58:27] that's right because all the people they
[58:29] saw in that land were not
[58:35] Giants it was only a few of them that's
[58:38] right but isn't it amazing how when we
[58:40] go to looking at things if we're not
[58:42] careful what's minimum we
[58:45] maximize and what's maximum we
[58:50] minimize now something had happened to
[58:52] them well listen as they go on all the
[58:56] people that we saw in it are men of
[58:58] great stature and there we saw the
[59:00] Giants the sons of anac I me knows what
[59:04] the word aack means anybody long
[59:09] neck long neck well I guess it really
[59:12] depends on how you look at the meaning
[59:14] of that word if you're an optimist you
[59:16] look at it one way if you're a pessimist
[59:18] you look at it another if you're an
[59:20] optimist you look at a man with a long
[59:22] neck I don't know where you're going to
[59:23] miss a Target like that come on
[59:28] Amen there we saw the Giants the sons of
[59:31] anoch which come of the
[59:33] Giants and we were in our own
[59:37] sight as
[59:39] grasshoppers we were in our own sight so
[59:41] now they're comparing themsel to the men
[59:44] they saw and this is the way they see
[59:46] them themselves and keep in mind what
[59:47] brother Tim preached to us last night
[59:50] and so we were in their
[59:53] side so what did they do go asked
[59:57] them yeah come on so they went up and
[1:00:00] asked them right you understand what
[1:00:02] they're doing they're
[1:00:04] lying right now think of who these
[1:00:08] people
[1:00:09] were they were message
[1:00:15] leaders these are not Philistines
[1:00:18] amorites Hittites jebusites coites no no
[1:00:22] no no these are message people all
[1:00:26] following the same Prophet
[1:00:29] supposedly and so we were in their sight
[1:00:34] I may all you be remembered today as we
[1:00:36] pray God bless you let's just hold our
[1:00:39] requests in our
[1:00:41] heart Heavenly Father we count it such
[1:00:43] an honor to be able to stand before your
[1:00:45] children
[1:00:47] today we have been blessed Lord to be
[1:00:50] able to be together these short days and
[1:00:53] truly they passed so fast
[1:00:57] Lord God we're Desiring for that hour
[1:01:00] when we will be changed and we'll be
[1:01:03] able to be caught up to your house and
[1:01:05] we'll never have to part again Lord
[1:01:08] we're just praying today that you would
[1:01:10] help us in this last
[1:01:12] service may may I be able to get out of
[1:01:14] the way and speak only that which would
[1:01:17] be pleasing to you if I'd go to say
[1:01:20] something that would be wrong stop me
[1:01:23] Lord if there's a need here to today or
[1:01:26] many that would be outside the confines
[1:01:29] of what I've studied and looked at I
[1:01:32] pray that you'd help me to be sensitive
[1:01:35] sometimes they don't need but a couple
[1:01:36] of words to a person that is so
[1:01:39] desperate so we ask you Lord would you
[1:01:43] come one more time and visit us in a
[1:01:47] special way we're so needy of you we
[1:01:51] commit the service to you today Father
[1:01:53] in the name of Jesus and the Saints said
[1:01:58] amen God bless you you may be
[1:02:05] seated so I'd like to speak to you today
[1:02:09] and I want to ask you this sermon title
[1:02:12] in the form of a
[1:02:16] question whose
[1:02:18] report will you
[1:02:23] believe every day of our life we're
[1:02:26] constantly under an
[1:02:27] onslaught of
[1:02:30] suggestions and ideas from the world
[1:02:34] that's around us every
[1:02:36] day by advertisements by pictures on our
[1:02:41] smartphones you know I read the other
[1:02:43] day where they say in in the year in our
[1:02:46] nation of a presidential
[1:02:49] election high blood pressure goes High
[1:02:54] higher heart heart attacks
[1:02:58] increase trauma
[1:03:01] increases it's because people look and
[1:03:04] they're uncertain they're just not sure
[1:03:08] how is it going to go and what's this
[1:03:10] person going to do and that person going
[1:03:12] to do and and we know that through the
[1:03:14] power of our media that they can project
[1:03:18] things that are absolutely lies that's
[1:03:22] right and yet many of our American
[1:03:24] people are so dumb and lack such
[1:03:26] spiritual discernment they believe it
[1:03:28] with all their
[1:03:29] heart so we know that there's a power of
[1:03:33] persuasion and there's a power of
[1:03:36] assimilation an assimilation means to be
[1:03:39] able to take something into yourself and
[1:03:42] you become one with that so every day of
[1:03:45] Our Lives we're constantly being under
[1:03:48] that onslaught of information of media
[1:03:52] of Lies Of Satan trying to affect who we
[1:03:56] are didn't brother Tim beautifully
[1:03:58] displayed that to us last night and it's
[1:04:00] a great challenge I believe one of the
[1:04:02] greatest challenges that we're going to
[1:04:03] have in this hour is US believing what
[1:04:06] we know about ourselves versus What God
[1:04:09] Says About Us and most of the time it's
[1:04:12] not the same thing but I I honestly
[1:04:16] again believe that God will have a
[1:04:17] people who will take him at his word and
[1:04:21] believe what he says over the top of all
[1:04:24] their failures and all their mistakes
[1:04:26] and all their
[1:04:27] shortcomings let's read again if you
[1:04:30] would in numbers chap 14 verse1 and
[1:04:33] let's look at the effect of this evil
[1:04:36] report and all the congregation lifted
[1:04:39] up their voice and cried and the people
[1:04:42] wept that night now why why are they
[1:04:45] doing this because these other preachers
[1:04:48] is it okay if I call them that because
[1:04:51] these other preachers who had went over
[1:04:54] into the land and come back and they
[1:04:56] brought back this negative report all
[1:04:59] the things that they saw that would seem
[1:05:01] to be so impossible for them to ever
[1:05:03] take it so it goes from one to the other
[1:05:06] to the other to the other now you
[1:05:08] imagine when they go home that night and
[1:05:10] they all go back to their tents and they
[1:05:13] go to talking about it and you know how
[1:05:15] things like that are so by the time they
[1:05:18] got done there ain't no telling how big
[1:05:20] them Giants were there ain't no telling
[1:05:23] how big the walls were there's no
[1:05:25] telling how many things that they shared
[1:05:28] one to another I imagine it would be
[1:05:30] absolutely amazing if we would start a
[1:05:33] story right here on the front row with
[1:05:35] brother Eddie and I'd tell brother Eddie
[1:05:38] tell all them back to there you would
[1:05:40] tell the other it would come here and
[1:05:42] start with this brother go all the way
[1:05:43] back through there start with this
[1:05:45] brother go all the way back through
[1:05:47] there and the brother right in the very
[1:05:49] back would come up and tell me what I
[1:05:52] said that's right there ain't no telling
[1:05:55] what he would say that I
[1:05:59] said now not because any of you were
[1:06:02] trying to lie but it's just something
[1:06:05] about the human being and that's one
[1:06:07] thing that makes me sick to my stomach
[1:06:09] sometimes whenever these people who've
[1:06:12] left the message and they try to make uh
[1:06:14] God's Prophet a because he doesn't have
[1:06:18] total recall on the stories that he
[1:06:21] tells well anybody here that does you
[1:06:23] can come up and take this microphone
[1:06:26] [Applause]
[1:06:28] praise the
[1:06:30] Lord so by the time it got from one to
[1:06:34] the other to the other it would be un un
[1:06:37] just be unbelievable what they were
[1:06:39] believing so watch in verse two and all
[1:06:41] the children of Israel murmured against
[1:06:43] Moses and against Aaron and the whole
[1:06:46] congregation said unto them would
[1:06:49] God would God we had died in the land of
[1:06:53] Egypt would God we had died in the
[1:06:57] wilderness and wherefore hath the Lord
[1:07:00] brought us un this land to Fall by the
[1:07:04] sword that our wives and our children
[1:07:06] should be appr prey were it not better
[1:07:09] for us to
[1:07:11] return into
[1:07:14] Egypt now where did they get all this
[1:07:17] where did they get all of this this was
[1:07:20] not from The Messengers of
[1:07:23] truth but they be to add to it and fear
[1:07:28] begin to
[1:07:29] multiply now watch what verse four
[1:07:32] reveals about them and they said one to
[1:07:37] another let us make a
[1:07:41] captain now watch they've been following
[1:07:44] a
[1:07:45] prophet but they don't want a prophet
[1:07:48] anymore they want a captain a political
[1:07:53] man a business man or a man that maybe
[1:07:58] they can manipulate a little bit and
[1:08:01] what do they want that man to do and let
[1:08:03] us return
[1:08:06] into
[1:08:08] Egypt God's Prophet had obeyed God's
[1:08:11] word giv them water when there was none
[1:08:15] gave given them Quil when there was none
[1:08:18] given them bread when there was none and
[1:08:21] yet now they want a captain that will
[1:08:25] lead them where wow they knew a true
[1:08:27] prophet of God would never take them
[1:08:30] back to
[1:08:31] Egypt amen let me tell you one thing
[1:08:33] there are no true men of God in this
[1:08:37] message that want to lead us back to a
[1:08:39] denomination that we come out of there
[1:08:42] are no true men of God in this message
[1:08:45] that want to make a new
[1:08:48] denomination God's Prophet told us in
[1:08:51] 1961 thus saith the Lord now listen thus
[1:08:55] thus saith the Lord that God had given
[1:08:58] to us a Homeland and he said you get
[1:09:01] back to your Homeland which is the
[1:09:05] message of the hour it's no reason to me
[1:09:09] that Satan has anointed people in this
[1:09:11] end time and they're trying to point out
[1:09:14] Humanity of the Prophet they're trying
[1:09:16] to show you seemingly a flaw here and a
[1:09:19] flaw there why the devil wants to get
[1:09:21] you away from your Homeland only in the
[1:09:25] reveal word of the hour will there be a
[1:09:29] rapturing face that will change our
[1:09:32] bodies I passed by many churches in the
[1:09:35] last few days coming up here all types
[1:09:37] of denominations all types of systems
[1:09:40] I'm not being judgmental just telling
[1:09:42] the truth rapturing faith will not lay
[1:09:45] in any of them it will take the message
[1:09:49] of the hour to be able to raise the
[1:09:51] people on the Earth that will believe
[1:09:54] for The Impossible and that is a body
[1:09:58] change on a worldwide
[1:10:01] scale we're believing for something that
[1:10:04] has never been Enoch believed for one
[1:10:07] man we're believing for the dead to
[1:10:10] raise we're believing for the living to
[1:10:13] be changed in a moment in a twinkling of
[1:10:17] an eye it'll take more than badst
[1:10:19] theology it'll take more than Methodist
[1:10:22] theology it'll take more than
[1:10:25] Pentecostal theology well let me go a
[1:10:27] little farther it'll take more than just
[1:10:30] message quotes it'll take more than
[1:10:33] intellectual faith of believing that God
[1:10:36] has sent a prophet you must be born
[1:10:39] again you must have the very life of
[1:10:43] Jehovah himself that has quickened you
[1:10:46] to eternal
[1:10:48] [Applause]
[1:10:50] life
[1:10:53] Hallelujah so report yes do you
[1:10:58] believe you imagine if they would have
[1:11:01] had
[1:11:02] YouTube in the days of numbers
[1:11:05] 13 and they had all kinds of people on
[1:11:08] there before cameras and they'd be
[1:11:10] saying I want to give my testimony today
[1:11:14] come
[1:11:15] on why I left that
[1:11:18] cult that
[1:11:20] Moses I'm so free
[1:11:26] until you wake up in the tribulation
[1:11:29] period and you wonder why you're
[1:11:34] there yeah these these folks that have
[1:11:36] left the message are so free they can
[1:11:38] dress any way they want to and do
[1:11:40] whatever they want to and and they call
[1:11:42] that
[1:11:44] freedom is there any women here in the
[1:11:46] church today assembly that have long
[1:11:48] hair and have long dresses and and your
[1:11:51] pastor stands before you with a bull
[1:11:53] whip and makes you should dress that way
[1:11:56] I don't think they understand our women
[1:11:59] want to dress this
[1:12:02] way it is not a bondage to the daughters
[1:12:05] of God they are
[1:12:09] free I said they are free they are free
[1:12:13] from the spirit of
[1:12:15] Jezebel our young girls don't do this
[1:12:18] because we make them they do it because
[1:12:21] they are born again
[1:12:25] Brothers don't dress like that the way
[1:12:28] they do and they don't go around with
[1:12:29] many skirts on in this crazy Age come on
[1:12:32] somebody our brothers don't wear dresses
[1:12:35] and do that because they're scared they
[1:12:38] don't want to do it because that's not
[1:12:40] the way a real man
[1:12:42] dresses come on somebody our preachers
[1:12:45] Don't Preach this because they're scared
[1:12:48] they preach it because they believe it
[1:12:52] they believe this message they believe
[1:12:55] the word of God for this hour as a
[1:12:57] matter of fact there's not enough devils
[1:12:59] in hell to pull us away from this
[1:13:03] revealed word of the hour whose report
[1:13:07] do we believe the report of Malachi 4
[1:13:11] the report of Luke
[1:13:14] 1730 that's the report we
[1:13:20] believe oh
[1:13:26] but here are some other
[1:13:28] guys in verse six Joshua the son of none
[1:13:31] and Caleb the son of jafan which were of
[1:13:35] them that searched the land rent their
[1:13:38] clothes oh yeah they spake unto all the
[1:13:41] company of the CH of is are saying the
[1:13:44] land which we pass through to search it
[1:13:48] is an exceeding good
[1:13:50] land oh yeah two
[1:13:53] groups saw exactly the same thing and
[1:13:57] come up with two exact opposite
[1:13:59] reports if the Lord Delight in us then
[1:14:03] he will bring us into this land and give
[1:14:05] it to us a land that floweth with milk
[1:14:08] and honey only Rebel not ye against the
[1:14:11] Lord neither fear ye the people of the
[1:14:13] land for they are
[1:14:16] bread amen for
[1:14:21] us fa can look at the land and say don't
[1:14:25] you all realize God had them to work all
[1:14:28] summer and them Gardens and it's harvest
[1:14:31] time we're going to walk right in get
[1:14:32] all them peaches we're going to get all
[1:14:34] them cabbages and all them carrots and
[1:14:36] all them pumpkins and man alive look
[1:14:39] what God's done for us but other people
[1:14:41] oh we can't do it we can't do it listen
[1:14:43] it's not just that way pertaining to the
[1:14:45] message itself it can be that way
[1:14:47] pertaining to your healing it can be
[1:14:50] that way pertaining to that Addiction in
[1:14:52] your life or that Spirit that's hung
[1:14:54] over you you oh my there's a brother
[1:14:56] come up in the church the other day and
[1:14:58] he say been fighting there brother Tim
[1:15:00] knows you well and he said he' been
[1:15:02] going through something for several
[1:15:03] several years depression and sadness oh
[1:15:06] it just seemed like he could not get out
[1:15:08] of it been prayed for by this one that
[1:15:10] one the other one myself and the
[1:15:11] brothers begin to pray for him I got a
[1:15:13] text from them the next morning he said
[1:15:15] I'm as lot as a feather the presence of
[1:15:17] God come down and set me free that's
[1:15:20] what I'm talking about I'm talking about
[1:15:22] if you're here today and you're
[1:15:24] depressed you don't have to leave
[1:15:26] depressed you may be sad now but you
[1:15:29] don't have to leave here sad why whose
[1:15:32] report will you believe I believe we as
[1:15:35] the people of God can have joy
[1:15:38] unspeakable and full of Glory we can be
[1:15:41] up when the devil says we ought to be
[1:15:44] down we can have so much happiness down
[1:15:47] inside of our soul that the devil says
[1:15:49] then people are crazy well that may be
[1:15:52] the way he perceives us but we're a not
[1:15:55] and we're getting ready to leave this
[1:15:57] world and we're getting our fuel tanks
[1:15:59] filled with rapturing
[1:16:07] faith so just in case my friends you are
[1:16:12] wondering do I still pray for people who
[1:16:15] have
[1:16:17] cancer even though God in his wisdom
[1:16:20] took my daughter amen
[1:16:25] oh yeah I
[1:16:28] do as a matter of fact we've seen
[1:16:30] several miracles in the church since
[1:16:31] Erica passed
[1:16:34] away if the devil thought it would stop
[1:16:38] me oh he's crying bad right
[1:16:41] now if he thinks it's going to stop you
[1:16:44] when you have disappointments no you
[1:16:47] know why we're made of the stuff that
[1:16:50] don't Bluff we are made oh Hallelujah we
[1:16:54] are made of the stuff it's the same
[1:16:57] stuff Peter was made out of and the same
[1:17:00] stuff Paul was made out of this is the
[1:17:03] report we believe we are more than
[1:17:06] conquerors to him who loved us and gave
[1:17:10] himself
[1:17:13] for do I understand
[1:17:17] no do I understand why God took my baby
[1:17:20] girl
[1:17:22] no my heart is still so broken amen I
[1:17:27] can't even hardly look at a picture of
[1:17:29] her
[1:17:33] amen my heart is
[1:17:38] broken I heard brother BR say years ago
[1:17:41] when I first come to the message and I I
[1:17:43] never really understood it he said God
[1:17:45] you've broken my heart over and over
[1:17:49] again and I thank you for it
[1:17:57] but I've learned to trust him in a way
[1:18:00] that I've never trusted him
[1:18:02] before and even when he says
[1:18:05] no when he says wait a while can you
[1:18:08] know kind of affect you a little bit but
[1:18:10] when he says
[1:18:11] no it really can affect you but if
[1:18:15] you'll allow it he'll bring you on the
[1:18:17] other side of that no and you'll be
[1:18:20] stronger than you ever were
[1:18:23] before how pain ful it was and brother
[1:18:25] brenon must have looked at his little
[1:18:27] girl as she was laying there and her
[1:18:29] eyes crossed before she died and him
[1:18:32] trying to understand God why would you
[1:18:34] do this why would you allow this God
[1:18:38] Amen and he said if God wouldn't answer
[1:18:41] him the devil
[1:18:42] would and he said when he stood there
[1:18:44] the devil told him look you've prayed
[1:18:46] for people you've climbed up and down
[1:18:48] them power poles you've done this and
[1:18:51] that and the other he wouldn't even have
[1:18:52] to speak he wouldn't even have just look
[1:18:55] this way and should get up and be well
[1:18:57] he said I was about ready to say well if
[1:18:59] that's the way he
[1:19:01] is but he said there was something down
[1:19:03] on the inside of me oh how many's been
[1:19:07] there before oh my goodness people think
[1:19:09] boy I that Devil he's giv me the office
[1:19:12] battle I've met that devil let me tell
[1:19:14] you something right now friends it ain't
[1:19:16] near nothing whenever you meet the
[1:19:18] Devils it ain't near as bad when you
[1:19:20] meet families and friends but whenever
[1:19:23] you meet God and you find yourself
[1:19:25] wrestling with
[1:19:29] him you see that little woman had so
[1:19:32] much faith that the Lord Jesus when she
[1:19:34] come out of desperation was her need and
[1:19:37] the Bible said the Lord Jesus answered
[1:19:40] her not a
[1:19:42] word and when he did give her a word it
[1:19:44] wasn't a good
[1:19:46] one he said
[1:19:48] woman boy we'd call him a racist today
[1:19:51] wouldn't woman I'm not s but to the
[1:19:55] house of Israel you ain't nothing but a
[1:19:58] dog right two Greek words used for
[1:20:02] dog Jesus called her big
[1:20:07] dog but the word she answered back was I
[1:20:10] ain't no big dog I'm a little dog I'm
[1:20:14] even little than what you said but that
[1:20:17] ain't got nothing to do with it I've got
[1:20:18] a need
[1:20:20] today what would you do if your pastor
[1:20:23] would call you a dog what would you do
[1:20:25] if you even felt like one of the
[1:20:26] preachers here today said the word dog
[1:20:28] and looked at you and you'd say Lord
[1:20:30] have mercy I'm so offended I ain't going
[1:20:32] back you know what that little woman had
[1:20:35] so much faith I love the way the prophet
[1:20:37] describes her he said she had so much
[1:20:39] Faith Jesus himself couldn't run her
[1:20:44] off people leave church cause the
[1:20:47] preacher don't shake their hand they
[1:20:49] leave church cuz they don't like this
[1:20:51] and don't like that the Lord Jesus is
[1:20:54] coming for people that so love him that
[1:20:58] even Jesus himself can't run them off oh
[1:21:01] you imagine the Lord Jesus looking at
[1:21:04] you and said get out of
[1:21:06] here go on
[1:21:10] pleas the disciples they looked at them
[1:21:12] that day and said you all want to go
[1:21:15] what about you you preachers you want to
[1:21:18] leave Jesus said go ahead Peter you want
[1:21:20] to get on out of here he said Lord to
[1:21:22] whom would we go you've got the words of
[1:21:24] eternal
[1:21:28] now we've got to be petted and got to be
[1:21:30] baby and we've got to have the you know
[1:21:32] the associate associate associate
[1:21:34] position of this and that and the other
[1:21:36] the prophet said if you compare
[1:21:37] Christianity Today what it was in that
[1:21:39] first century they didn't have to have
[1:21:41] positions they didn't have to be baby
[1:21:43] they were rough people they LED God they
[1:21:46] trusted him I believe that's part of
[1:21:48] what we're going to be restored to in
[1:21:50] the last day but we got people walking
[1:21:53] around their feelings on their shoulders
[1:21:55] all the time and their lips all pooched
[1:21:57] out oh Lord what a way to end this
[1:21:59] meeting oh my goodness come on somebody
[1:22:02] have we got the type of faith in this
[1:22:04] building that if Jesus himself stands in
[1:22:07] your way and say you can't go you say
[1:22:09] yes I am you ain't keeping me out Jesus
[1:22:13] my name is on your backook hallelujah oh
[1:22:17] the devils in hell will not stop me
[1:22:28] can you imagine Jacob trying to witness
[1:22:31] about his
[1:22:35] God and he tells people his name and
[1:22:37] tells him things that he's done then he
[1:22:40] gets real personal and said oh yeah I
[1:22:42] said this God of mine broke my
[1:22:47] hip looking at you like
[1:22:51] what what
[1:22:54] he's a god of
[1:22:57] love he ever he ever hurt you all come
[1:22:59] on now oh my we love the love aspect
[1:23:03] don't we but sometimes God hurts
[1:23:07] you but it's because he does love you
[1:23:10] it's for your good he don't have to
[1:23:12] treat you the way he does these people
[1:23:15] out here don't you understand they get
[1:23:18] saved and there'll be many of them
[1:23:19] that'll come up that day oh I wish
[1:23:21] people could understand it there is a
[1:23:23] million miles of difference between a
[1:23:26] Believer and a
[1:23:29] disciple look at how many times the New
[1:23:31] Testament uses the word disciple you
[1:23:33] know what that word comes from it comes
[1:23:35] from the same root word that we use from
[1:23:39] discipline how many of these people went
[1:23:41] to church today around in this area will
[1:23:43] they stand disciplined oh no they'll
[1:23:45] call thems a Believer I believe in the
[1:23:47] cross I Believe In The Blood I believe
[1:23:48] in heaven I believe in hell I don't want
[1:23:50] to go to hell don't want to go to heaven
[1:23:51] well you got to quit cutting your heart
[1:23:53] now who in the world told you that ain't
[1:23:55] no preacher telling me how to live Ain't
[1:23:56] No preacher telling me I can do this why
[1:23:59] they don't want discipline well I wish
[1:24:01] somebody would preach with me this
[1:24:03] morning it's sad because a lot of the
[1:24:05] message folks are the same way they
[1:24:08] don't want discipline they go to this
[1:24:09] church and then the preacher preaches on
[1:24:11] they get mad and they go to that church
[1:24:13] and they go to that church well
[1:24:15] Hallelujah we believe in a post of Duty
[1:24:18] all right but a lot of Us carry our post
[1:24:20] ho diggers in the back pocket and when
[1:24:22] the preacher preaches on our house
[1:24:24] we dig our post up and dig another post
[1:24:27] hole over here and we just go from one
[1:24:29] to the other where are those rugged
[1:24:32] Christians that can say I don't want to
[1:24:34] just be a believer I want to be a
[1:24:40] disciple I know you know it from reading
[1:24:43] your Bible but you realize the Lord
[1:24:45] Jesus preached more about our
[1:24:48] cross than he did his own
[1:24:55] your cross and whosoever does not take
[1:24:58] up Not My Cross Jesus said right we can
[1:25:01] put them on mirrors we can wear them on
[1:25:03] our clothes we can wear a chain around
[1:25:05] our neck but can we take up our
[1:25:12] cross that's the report I know a lot of
[1:25:16] men as they get older they get softer
[1:25:17] and I think my church is praying that I
[1:25:19] will but they're facing reality and
[1:25:22] realize so far I ain't
[1:25:31] notice this in numbers 14:36 and the man
[1:25:34] which Moses sent to search the land who
[1:25:36] returned and made all the congregation
[1:25:38] to murmur against him by bringing up a
[1:25:43] slander the word slander is
[1:25:47] Whispering
[1:25:49] defamation evil report unfavorable
[1:25:55] saying even those men that did bring up
[1:25:58] the evil report upon the land
[1:26:02] died don't you understand what trouble
[1:26:04] is going to be for those who have sat in
[1:26:06] our
[1:26:07] ranks and have pulled away and they're
[1:26:09] spending the rest of their
[1:26:11] life trying to disprove this
[1:26:15] message it's going to be amazing the
[1:26:18] scientists who stand before God one day
[1:26:20] and spent their entire life proving
[1:26:22] there was no God and then they wind up
[1:26:25] facing
[1:26:26] him many archaeologist spent many of
[1:26:28] their years Church his story and spent
[1:26:30] many of their years saying that was
[1:26:32] never a man by the name of Pontius
[1:26:35] Pilate that ever lived until a few years
[1:26:39] ago that's right until they found this
[1:26:42] gigantic Stone brother Tim brother
[1:26:43] Timothy and US was there several years
[1:26:45] ago and they find this Stone there in
[1:26:47] Tiberius of cesaria and they they
[1:26:49] digging around there and found this
[1:26:51] great big massive Stone let's guess
[1:26:53] who's name on it Pontius
[1:26:57] pilot and then just recently I read a
[1:27:00] letter where one of the certain men had
[1:27:01] written a letter from Pontius pilot unto
[1:27:04] Emperor Nero and he was talking about
[1:27:07] after Nero before Nero whenever he was
[1:27:10] talking about the Lord Jesus so those
[1:27:12] men spent all their lives totally in
[1:27:16] vain you imagine spending your life I
[1:27:18] say if all these folks that have left
[1:27:20] the message would have spent that time
[1:27:21] studying the message before they left
[1:27:23] they still might be in it but they've
[1:27:26] spent a whole lot more time since they
[1:27:27] live it but you know what they're
[1:27:29] supposed to do that somebody is going to
[1:27:32] bring up an evil report but I'm on the
[1:27:35] other side I'm one of them oh Hallelujah
[1:27:38] I'm one of them that's supposed to bring
[1:27:41] up a good report ain't we brothers are
[1:27:43] you here today as one of them I'm going
[1:27:46] to bring a good report I'm going to say
[1:27:49] the message is full of goodness and the
[1:27:51] message is full of word and the message
[1:27:54] Mage it ain't up just a bunch of dry
[1:27:56] theology but the message brings to us a
[1:27:59] return to the original baptism of the
[1:28:02] Holy Ghost same power same signs same
[1:28:06] wonders same
[1:28:08] [Applause]
[1:28:13] Jesus Oh
[1:28:16] My who
[1:28:18] report will you
[1:28:21] believe let us move over to 1 Samuel
[1:28:25] verse 17 chapter 17:
[1:28:28] 42 and when the Philistine looked about
[1:28:31] and saw
[1:28:33] David he disdained
[1:28:36] him disdained which is to
[1:28:39] despise holding
[1:28:42] contempt to be vile and
[1:28:46] worthless for he was but a
[1:28:48] use and
[1:28:50] Ruddy and of a fair countenance
[1:28:54] and the Philistines said unto David am I
[1:28:56] a dog David could have said yeah
[1:29:00] man you said it big
[1:29:04] boy am I dog that thou comest to me with
[1:29:07] staves and the Philistine cursed
[1:29:11] David by his
[1:29:14] gods and the Philistines said to David
[1:29:17] come to me oh yeah maybe your Philistine
[1:29:21] today is a cancer
[1:29:26] maybe your Philistine is something else
[1:29:28] you're dealing with in your life and he
[1:29:31] laughs at
[1:29:37] you notice the Philistine had a
[1:29:41] confession the Philistine said to David
[1:29:44] come unto me and I will give thy flesh
[1:29:48] unto the fowls of the
[1:29:51] air and to the Beast of the field
[1:29:55] now let's size these guys up a
[1:29:59] non-armored
[1:30:01] Goliath would have weighed approximately
[1:30:06] 760
[1:30:08] lbs and David weighed in at
[1:30:19] 110 and Goliath was still outnumbered
[1:30:24] [Applause]
[1:30:30] adding the weight of his armor at about
[1:30:33] 125 lbs made him
[1:30:38] 885 with a spear sword shield and helmet
[1:30:44] easily over
[1:30:46] 900
[1:30:49] amen sell outnumbered real
[1:30:52] bad right

[1:30:57] looking at a man who has a spear that is
[1:31:00] 20 feet long so from here this B on the
[1:31:04] corner you just take the end of it and
[1:31:06] just just like that and rip you wide

[1:42:26] Fearless he said today I'll cut your
[1:42:29] head

[1:43:24] deliver thee unto mine
[1:43:26] hand and I will smite
[1:43:29] thee and I will take thine head from

[1:43:44] deeper realm and I will give the
[1:43:49] carcasses of the host of the Philistines

[1:43:59] word Goliath means
[1:44:01] Splendor God's going to humiliate the
[1:44:04] devil's Splendor with a
[1:44:08] runt as I stood downstairs
[1:44:11] earlier they got some trophy cases down
[1:44:14] there of the FFA and different ball

[1:44:51] when the people of God I ain't just

[1:46:46] Victory praise the
[1:46:48] Lord oh I love that about the prophet of

[1:50:02] closer than any other generation to
[1:50:04] having
[1:50:08] it notice David said and it shall come
[1:50:13] to pass it came to pass rather when the
[1:50:17] Philistine

[1:50:24] that David
[1:50:28] hasted and
[1:50:32] ran you got to be kidding
[1:50:35] me toward the
[1:50:40] Army now you imagine but now his brother

[1:51:36] out of that same
[1:51:37] Brook amen this is one of them
[1:51:45] Hallelujah he picks up five of
[1:51:48] them because Goliath had four brothers
[1:51:55] so he had to get out the right rock with
[1:51:58] the right name on it yeah that looks
[1:51:59] like g o l
[1:52:01] i d e a d d e v i l dead devil yeah
[1:52:05] that's him that's
[1:52:09] him and David is so inspir where is this
[1:52:13] man get now remember he had no
[1:52:18] tapes he didn't have 66 books of a Bible
[1:52:20] so he didn't have a pastor and local
[1:52:22] church he didn't have a choir to stand
[1:52:24] up and sing like my goodness when that
[1:52:25] song they song while to go absolutely
[1:52:27] awesome I mean anybody could go looking
[1:52:28] for a giant after that

[1:52:33] and he stand look at that great big
[1:52:35] glory to God let me add him let me add
[1:52:37] him let me add
[1:52:39] him and here comes Goliath and David
[1:52:42] takes off
[1:52:46] run whose report yes do you believe
[1:52:53] or would you side with the report of
[1:52:55] wisdom
[1:53:01] So-Cal now we
[1:53:03] believe the message of the
[1:53:07] hour but we believe that we have moved
[1:53:11] into a different
[1:53:13] era that we no longer need
[1:53:17] fanaticism and emotion
[1:53:27] and imagine how David would film some of
[1:53:29] our churches he say dear God you all say
[1:53:32] you got the Holy
[1:53:36] Ghost I'd say if David would have been
[1:53:38] here in this meeting the deacons had
[1:53:40] took him out probably half a dozen times
[1:53:41] each service and that been before the
[1:53:43] preacher ever come out a man without the
[1:53:46] Holy Ghost had so much to praise God for
[1:53:49] he had so much to worship God for and he
[1:53:52] so anointed just a
[1:53:55] kid and he takes off running after that
[1:54:02] cancer
[1:54:07] Hallelujah the prophet said the little
[1:54:09] boy weighed about 110 PBS kind of
[1:54:11] scrawny drawled up little fella Here
[1:54:14] Come Little David just a
[1:54:16] bouncing just a bouncing in the spirit
[1:54:19] and then brother B says H ha
[1:54:23] ha well glory to God I say we ought to
[1:54:26] say that haa at the Devil when the devil
[1:54:30] say you ain't going to make it

[1:55:08] Israel he placed it before him all the
[1:55:11] devils in Hell couldn't wait across
[1:55:14] Little David dancing in the spirit
[1:55:18] that's right oh Glory Hallelujah now
[1:55:21] remember the Jews were taught by God to
[1:55:23] dance amen so they danced at festivals
[1:55:27] they danced at all kinds of things but
[1:55:30] all their dancing was not in the
[1:55:32] spirit right so there'd be different
[1:55:34] times they just get up and dance and
[1:55:36] dance and dance it was just their custom
[1:55:38] a lot of Middle Eastern people still do
[1:55:39] the same thing today but David wasn't
[1:55:42] just
[1:55:43] dancing he was in the
[1:55:46] spirit David put his hand in his bag
[1:55:53] don't worry I'm not going to throw
[1:55:56] this I'm a dead shot now with a gun and
[1:55:59] with a bow a lot of dead animals on my
[1:56:01] wall to testify the same but I don't
[1:56:04] want to just be a a dead shot with my
[1:56:07] rifle or with my bow I want to be a dead
[1:56:11] shot against
[1:56:12] hell I want to be a dead shot right here
[1:56:15] in this service today come on somebody
[1:56:17] with me Brothers is that right I don't
[1:56:19] want to miss I ain't using a scatter gun
[1:56:21] today a shotgun I want to be able to
[1:56:23] hone that thing right on in and bust
[1:56:25] that devil away from you where you'll be
[1:56:27] able to walk out of here and say praise
[1:56:30] God I'm going to meet this challenge I'm
[1:56:32] going to meet whatever it is before me
[1:56:34] and by the grace of God I'm going to
[1:56:36] overcome it none of us know what awaits
[1:56:38] us when we get back home but whatever
[1:56:40] awaits us I know who we're taking with
[1:56:43] us if trouble awaits you don't fret over
[1:56:46] it don't worry over it Jesus will be
[1:56:48] there with you he said I'll never leave
[1:56:50] you I'll never forsake you I'll go with
[1:56:53] you all the way to the end of the
[1:56:56] [Applause]
[1:56:59] world and he
[1:57:01] took fence a
[1:57:05] stone and slang
[1:57:09] it we need to do some slang at
[1:57:14] it don't just sing slang
[1:57:22] and
[1:57:24] smoked the
[1:57:26] Philistine in the
[1:57:31] forehead that the stone
[1:57:36] sunk into his
[1:57:41] forhead
[1:57:43] huh and he
[1:57:45] fell upon his
[1:57:48] face
[1:57:50] wow so he rather has ever hunted and you
[1:57:54] hunt with a bow or certain velocity in
[1:57:56] your
[1:57:57] rifle and what will it do it shocks the
[1:58:01] animal and they will go backwards
[1:58:03] because of the foot pounds per pressure
[1:58:07] that you're hitting them but instead of
[1:58:10] this nearly half a ton Target falling
[1:58:13] backwards which would have been normal
[1:58:16] he got hit in the forehead so here this
[1:58:18] thing is moving my just flying through
[1:58:21] there and the power of God got behind it
[1:58:23] and
[1:58:24] went that's
[1:58:27] right he should have went this
[1:58:30] way he should have went this
[1:58:33] way unless of
[1:58:36] course the Lord God wanted to put him on
[1:58:39] his
[1:58:45] face and make him bow for
[1:58:49] me oh
[1:58:52] hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to God

[2:03:35] I
[2:03:36] mean any all Unitarian or Methodist or
[2:03:39] Church of
[2:03:41] God this message is to turn our hearts
[2:03:43] back to the faith of the original
[2:03:47] Apostolic
[2:03:48] fathers they cast out Devils they raised
[2:03:51] the Dead they healed the sick and they
[2:03:53] gave their life for the Lord Jesus
[2:03:57] Christ let me close 1 Samuel 1715 let's
[2:04:00] stand together if you would so David
[2:04:02] prevailed over the Philistine with a
[2:04:05] sling and with a stone and smoked the
[2:04:09] Philistine and slew him but there was no
[2:04:11] sword in the hand of David therefore
[2:04:14] David
[2:04:15] ran and stood upon the Philistine and
[2:04:19] took his sword and Drew out of the
[2:04:20] sheath thereof
[2:04:22] and slew him and cut off his head
[2:04:26] therewi and when the Philistines saw
[2:04:28] their
[2:04:30] Champion was dead oh
[2:04:33] yeah they
[2:04:36] fled amen the meaning of the word report
[2:04:40] saved this to the
[2:04:41] last it's the Hebrew word
[2:04:44] shuah it means news or Tidings or to
[2:04:50] mention news Tidings or to mention talk
[2:04:56] about so how do you know that the
[2:04:59] champion of hell is not fighting against
[2:05:02] you this very day and God is that close
[2:05:05] to delivering
[2:05:07] you and if Satan can make you negative
[2:05:09] or make you down maybe you come to the
[2:05:11] meetings and you had a great
[2:05:12] anticipation you think I didn't get what
[2:05:14] it come for oh no Lord oh no oh no well
[2:05:16] just cuz you didn't get it now don't
[2:05:17] mean you ain't going to get it over to
[2:05:18] eat in place we're going to eat lunch
[2:05:20] out it don't you ain't going to get it

[2:05:34] get God gets it to you don't let
[2:05:39] go whose report will you
[2:05:43] believe no doubt after these meetings
[2:05:46] there'll be a lot of sermons that'll be
[2:05:48] inspired to be preached
[2:05:51] against
[2:05:55] them I'm glad when God called me to
[2:05:57] preach it he give me more to preach on
[2:05:59] than
[2:06:00] preachers I don't think some message
[2:06:02] preachers would have anything to preach
[2:06:03] about if they didn't listen and watch
[2:06:04] other preachers so they could find
[2:06:06] something to preach
[2:06:07] about God never called me to Paul never
[2:06:09] told him as he preach the preachers he
[2:06:11] said preach the
[2:06:14] word so that's to be
[2:06:18] expected look friends it'll happen just
[2:06:22] like this that's right the mechanics of
[2:06:24] the world is in action right now
[2:06:26] pre-tribulation anointing is on the
[2:06:29] earth there has been more un resolutions
[2:06:34] declared against Israel than all the
[2:06:36] rest of the nations of the world
[2:06:39] together we've seen it through the thing
[2:06:41] of October 7 how many nations now we see
[2:06:43] College starting back up again and the
[2:06:45] students are hating Israel don't you see
[2:06:48] it's here Satan's getting his mechanics
[2:06:51] to together you understand when the
[2:06:53] bride goes say if she goes on Tuesday
[2:06:55] morning or whenever it is the devil
[2:06:58] ain't got 6 months the devil ain't got a
[2:07:01] year the Bible says whenever he comes
[2:07:03] down he knows he's got but a short time
[2:07:05] right if the bride leaves at 8:00 in the
[2:07:07] morning by tomorrow afternoon this world
[2:07:11] will be turned totally upside down right
[2:07:15] the churches politics everything it's
[2:07:17] working behind the scenes right now and
[2:07:20] when the bride goes up up Satan comes
[2:07:23] down why the people he's been accusing
[2:07:26] are standing there in glorified bodies
[2:07:29] and he can't say
[2:07:30] [Applause]
[2:07:31] nothing as long as we're here in this
[2:07:33] top of a body he can say something but
[2:07:35] boy once we get that body he ain't
[2:07:38] welcome no
[2:07:39] more oh my goodness if you're here today
[2:07:41] without the Holy Ghost I'm telling you
[2:07:43] it's not enough to believe God sent a
[2:07:44] prophet it's not enough to go to brother
[2:07:46] Ron's Church brother Tim Church wherever
[2:07:48] it is you go you must have that
[2:07:50] identification of the Holy Ghost in your
[2:07:54] soul that you can show that token that
[2:07:57] the price is
[2:07:59] paid can we bow our hands
[2:08:04] together I wonder if there be here today
[2:08:06] that you're just not
[2:08:09] sure if you have the Holy Ghost or not
[2:08:11] you love the Lord you want to go to
[2:08:14] heaven you want to be in the Rapture but
[2:08:15] you're just not sure if you have the
[2:08:18] Holy Ghost or not would you raise your
[2:08:19] hand to God today God bless you we won't
[2:08:21] embarrass you or nothing like that God
[2:08:23] bless you oh my God bless
[2:08:26] you

[2:08:32] Jesus maybe some of you are sick got an
[2:08:35] Affliction in your body terrible disease
[2:08:37] you'd like to be remembered today in
[2:08:39] prayer would you raise your hand to God
[2:08:41] I believe you got some men on this pull
[2:08:43] pit that know how to slang
[2:08:46] stones but these men's call is to help
[2:08:49] you to learn how to be a stone Slinger
[2:08:53] maybe somebody here bound with a habit
[2:08:55] of besetting
[2:08:57] sin you need the Lord to help you would
[2:08:59] you raise your hand some of you lacking
[2:09:02] peace and joy in your heart amen well
[2:09:06] let me just ask you this how many of us
[2:09:08] would like to have a refilling of the
[2:09:10] Holy Ghost oh Lord God my hand goes up
[2:09:13] all the brothers back here behind me

[2:09:27] Israel we know Israel as a nation is a
[2:09:30] type of
[2:09:31] us we see them Lord in the last Almost

[2:40:42] meetings a completely different
[2:40:45] person refilled with the Holy Ghost
[2:40:48] healed
[2:40:49] [Music]
[2:40:51] healed delivered and completely set
[2:40:55] free by the preaching of the word the
[2:40:58] Holy Spirit
[2:40:59] Falls and he begins to minister to
[2:41:03] different ones in different ways he has
[2:41:05] a word this way has a gift in the body
[2:41:09] so that this brother or this sister will
[2:41:10] catch it that way I love the Dynamics of
[2:41:13] the body of Jesus Christ that he knows
[2:41:15] how to capture the attention of his
[2:41:17] elect and bring them to the Forefront of
[2:41:20] the battle because he know that you
[2:41:22] won't run away from it but you'll
[2:41:25] slang you'll slang that
[2:41:28] sling he knows what you got on the
[2:41:30] inside of you so he puts you right here
[2:41:33] in the midst of the greatest battle
[2:41:34] that's ever been fought and he knew that
[2:41:36] you wouldn't let Satan destroy your mind
[2:41:39] and destroy your spirit and destroy your
[2:41:41] soul so he gave you the greatest weapon
[2:41:43] that he ever could he gave you the
[2:41:45] message of the
[2:41:46] hour and we just want to say from Full
[2:41:49] God Hospital lighthouse we thank all of
[2:41:50] our visitors for being here we thank you

[2:42:19] all of the the people that are behind
[2:42:21] the scenes here at Full Gospel
[2:42:22] Lighthouse this is the first time that
[2:42:24] we ever held a meeting outside of our
[2:42:26] own our own tent our out our own church
[2:42:29] facility bringing it here and I want to
[2:42:32] say that I am
[2:42:34] abundantly impressed with our team at
[2:42:36] Full Gospel
[2:42:40] Lighthouse brother Jeremy brother Scotty
[2:42:43] brother Evan brother Adam brother Ruben
[2:42:46] brother sister Crystal and sister
[2:42:48] Stephanie would could do it without you
[2:42:49] and I'm sure I'm going to miss somebody
[2:42:52] but I just want to say that I I'm
[2:42:55] sufficiently impressed with the presence
[2:42:56] of the Holy Ghost how it has impacted
[2:42:58] these brothers and sisters because we
[2:43:01] Minister from here we Minister behind
[2:43:05] this pull pit but those brothers and
[2:43:08] sisters are used by almighty God to send
[2:43:11] the gospel around the world place it on
[2:43:13] a platform so that people across the
[2:43:16] Nations can be blessed by these meetings
[2:43:18] they never understand the impact of what
[2:43:21] they're having and we just want to say
[2:43:23] God bless you God wish bless
[2:43:32] you we have a wonderful team here for
[2:43:35] Gospel Lighthouse but we could not have
[2:43:38] done this meeting God sent us one of his
[2:43:41] one of his best from all the way from
[2:43:42] Brother Tom Ray to be here brother
[2:43:45] Jonathan Frey he felt it on his heart to
[2:43:47] come here and be a part of these
[2:43:48] meetings and to assist us in the sound
[2:43:51] booth and in any way possible we just
[2:43:53] wanted to put his shoulder to the wheel
[2:43:54] and we just want to say God bless you
[2:43:55] and your family brother johathan for
[2:43:57] coming and being a part of these
[2:43:59] meetings also Brother David Dexter from
[2:44:01] brother Tim puit church we just want to
[2:44:03] say God richly bless you he's become a
[2:44:05] real bosom buddy here and uh he's been a
[2:44:09] real friend and we've seen the Lord use
[2:44:11] his use his ministry in sound and his
[2:44:14] wife's Ministry of music to be a
[2:44:16] blessing and we just want to say God
[2:44:18] Rich bless you and I could not do this
[2:44:21] entire meeting with these guys without
[2:44:24] our
[2:44:25] musicians you know forgive me I know I
[2:44:29] know that you have different churches
[2:44:30] and I know that you're from your home
[2:44:31] church and you you might be a little bit
[2:44:33] partial but I think these guys are the
[2:44:36] absolute
[2:44:38] best y'all forgive me if I hurt your
[2:44:41] feelings but I think the world of these
[2:44:43] guys and I wouldn't take a million
[2:44:45] dollars for them they have been they
[2:44:49] have been supernaturally blessed and
[2:44:51] used by almighty God to give their gifts
[2:44:54] they don't do this for a show to be
[2:44:56] honest a lot of them would like to hide
[2:44:57] behind that curtain and not be seen
[2:44:59] that's just typically how gifts work in
[2:45:01] a body but these brothers and sisters
[2:45:04] have have
[2:45:05] spent countless hours practicing music
[2:45:08] and developing the gift that God's
[2:45:10] placed in their life and we just want to
[2:45:11] say God richly bless you and each and
[2:45:14] every one of you I know that we're going
[2:45:16] to miss some things and I couldn't do it
[2:45:18] without our Deacons our ushers and and
[2:45:20] and I know you come to the close of the
[2:45:22] meetings and you hear these things and
[2:45:23] they're just words to some people but
[2:45:26] for me it's my heart this is my heart
[2:45:30] because I could not hold brother Ron and
[2:45:32] myself brother Matthew brother William
[2:45:34] we could not host a meeting like this
[2:45:36] without the people at Full Gospel
[2:45:38] Lighthouse so if you could do a favor
[2:45:40] for me if you're a visitor here I want
[2:45:42] you to just take some time and say God
[2:45:43] bless you may not see everything that
[2:45:45] they do but just just reach out there
[2:45:47] brother Brandon would say it like this
[2:45:49] God bless you is the greatest thing that
[2:45:50] you could say to him and I just want to
[2:45:52] appreciate you from this meeting and say
[2:45:55] that we love you with the love of the
[2:45:57] Lord amen we have some announcements
[2:45:59] that we're just going to go over because
[2:46:01] we're getting ready to be dismissed we

[2:46:07] every one of you to come to we have

[2:46:11] army and we want to make sure that an
[2:46:13] army that's behind David comes and eats
[2:46:16] with us because we we we've we we''ve
[2:46:19] spent some time in preparations getting
[2:46:21] these things together and we just would
[2:46:23] like to turn around and bless you for
[2:46:25] coming and being part of these meetings
[2:46:27] and I trust that we've treated you in
[2:46:29] some way that you have bound to like one
[2:46:31] of them at
[2:46:32] least and I appreciate you coming here
[2:46:34] and and eating on the word of God so
[2:46:37] that you can go and enjoy our chicken I
[2:46:40] I really don't like it when people come
[2:46:41] and eat my chicken but don't eat the
[2:46:42] spiritual food but that's neither here
[2:46:44] nor there Jesus had them we all got them
[2:46:46] so so let me move on to my
[2:46:49] my my announcements so if if the
[2:46:53] brothers sisters could maybe just cast
[2:46:54] the the address to where we're going
[2:46:56] it's it's a half a mile from here if
[2:46:58] you've been here in our past Labor Day
[2:46:59] meetings it's right here at Spotswood
[2:47:01] High School and uh there's the address
[2:47:04] I'm going to give you permission to pull
[2:47:05] out your phone to snap a picture of that
[2:47:07] right there it's 368 Blazer drive all
[2:47:10] you got to do is when you pull out of
[2:47:11] these pull out of the driveway here just
[2:47:13] take a left go all the way back down to
[2:47:15] 33 which I believe it's about two10 of a
[2:47:18] mile and you take a r and you go down
[2:47:21] the road about a half a mile and it's
[2:47:22] there on your left and it's Spotswood
[2:47:24] High School and uh we've got some things
[2:47:26] that we need need to make note of we
[2:47:29] make this every year because we really
[2:47:31] we really don't want to pay your fines
[2:47:33] and we won't pay your fines so we're
[2:47:35] going to make this mention to you
[2:47:36] there's a fire lane at this place it's
[2:47:38] red it's red around the curbs do not
[2:47:41] park where these red lines are you will
[2:47:43] get a
[2:47:44] ticket I was there yesterday we setting
[2:47:46] up some things and a fire truck come
[2:47:48] right through a and if I'd have been in
[2:47:49] that red lane they had give me a ticket
[2:47:51] because they fueled up the fuel station
[2:47:52] for Rockingham County is right there so
[2:47:54] please do not park where a red lane is
[2:47:56] when you're pulling into Spotswood it's
[2:47:58] a loop it just goes around you just
[2:48:00] circle around it and you park there in
[2:48:02] different places and you enter into the
[2:48:04] building if you're looking at the
[2:48:06] building on the left major entrance
[2:48:08] there's some picnic tables out there and
[2:48:09] I'm sure that you by the time you get
[2:48:11] there there'll be a line of people so
[2:48:12] you won't miss where to go in the
[2:48:13] building that and uh we'll have somebody
[2:48:16] there to make sure uh that the the doors
[2:48:19] should be about open if they're not open
[2:48:21] it's because the brothers and sisters
[2:48:23] are still preparing there and we're
[2:48:24] going to have prayer here at the end of
[2:48:26] these announcements and so that when you
[2:48:28] get there you can just go ahead and
[2:48:29] start eating and you can say that
[2:48:31] brother Andrew and the church blessed it
[2:48:33] and you just go right on in and I know
[2:48:35] there's a lot of people that love this
[2:48:36] next part of my announcements watch your
[2:48:41] kids watch your kids there's cameras
[2:48:44] everywhere and I'm not going to say what
[2:48:46] I've always said you know what I'm going
[2:48:48] to say watch your
[2:48:50] kids and parents if you have a little
[2:48:52] bitty child and you think they need to
[2:48:55] be assisted just stay with them make
[2:48:58] sure one parent is watching them or know
[2:48:59] where they are because Full Gospel
[2:49:01] lighthous does a lot of things but we
[2:49:03] don't babysit we don't hand out
[2:49:05] pacifiers to our to our congregants here
[2:49:08] and we don't hand them out to you and we
[2:49:09] don't we don't plan on babysitting your
[2:49:11] children so uh God give them to you so
[2:49:13] we're going to let you do the duty that
[2:49:15] God give them to you so we've got two
[2:49:17] gyms that are in the place uh one is for
[2:49:20] the little kids and there is there's a
[2:49:22] jumpy house in there and uh that's for
[2:49:25] the little guys and I'm sure I'm going
[2:49:26] to make my way down there me and brother
[2:49:28] Aaron probably check out that sliping
[2:49:29] slide
[2:49:31] and we'll show y'all that we can preach
[2:49:33] behind the pull pit and we can having
[2:49:35] fun with you at the same time so but we
[2:49:37] also have another gym that's directly
[2:49:39] behind the where we're going to be
[2:49:40] eating at and that's for the young
[2:49:41] adults and the uh and the older kids and
[2:49:44] there's going to be volleyball
[2:49:46] basketball in those in that gym there
[2:49:49] and we ask that uh after you get done
[2:49:51] eating if you wouldn't mind just
[2:49:52] cleaning up after yourself and uh this
[2:49:55] is not our facility and uh we just ask
[2:49:58] that you would respect it like I know
[2:49:59] that Sons and Daughters of God will uh
[2:50:02] the bathrooms you you'll find that
[2:50:03] there's there's one on the left one on
[2:50:05] the right and uh I I just want to just
[2:50:08] say this these brothers have have spent
[2:50:11] their their energies in this meeting and
[2:50:14] just be wise with your time with with
[2:50:16] them please don't give them your life
[2:50:17] story in 5 minutes and uh just be wise
[2:50:20] with brother Ron if not brother Matthew
[2:50:22] will probably come move you away from
[2:50:24] him if you're just leaning on him too
[2:50:26] much don't take offense I give him full
[2:50:28] authority to do so so if you're going to
[2:50:30] get mad at him you're going to be mad at
[2:50:31] me so don't do that because we don't
[2:50:33] want to make you we don't want anybody
[2:50:34] be mad at us and also we we we have this
[2:50:38] note we have a real nice walking trail
[2:50:40] outside of Spotswood Trail uh outside of
[2:50:43] Spotswood High School there and a lot of
[2:50:45] people have walked that in years past
[2:50:47] and it's right out in front of the
[2:50:49] school and um it's a real nice Trail but
[2:50:51] we ask you not to walk it because
[2:50:53] there's a few beehives out there very
[2:50:55] large beehive is is what I've been told
[2:50:57] and we'd rather you not get stung by it
[2:51:00] so uh we we'd like this day to go pretty
[2:51:02] good without anybody swelling up here
[2:51:04] except for eating on the good food
[2:51:06] [Music]
[2:51:09] so
[2:51:11] amen just before we before we leave here

[2:51:16] seats and uh if there's anything here
[2:51:18] that's yours please take it with you
[2:51:20] because tomorrow this will turn into a
[2:51:22] school and if you leave something here
[2:51:24] it probably won't get uh return to you
