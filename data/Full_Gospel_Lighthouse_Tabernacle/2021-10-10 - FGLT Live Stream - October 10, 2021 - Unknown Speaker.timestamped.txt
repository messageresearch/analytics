[18:01] lead us to the throne of grace this
[18:03] morning
[18:06] [Music]
[18:10] before we bow our heads i just want to
[18:12] testify with
[18:13] a miracle that i saw and this was this
[18:15] was back when i was six seven years old
[18:18] when we were coming home from church
[18:20] and i just the reason i want to testify
[18:22] this is because i believe in a god that
[18:24] works miracles
[18:25] and it's not only in our lives but
[18:27] everywhere around us as well
[18:29] and
[18:30] as we were coming home from church
[18:32] i was i was actually asleep in the back
[18:34] seat of the car
[18:35] and i wake up to
[18:37] us hitting the deer
[18:38] and as the deer it goes it was a nice
[18:40] little eight point buck and you hunters
[18:41] know once once a deer gets hit that's
[18:44] injured
[18:45] it's not going to come around it's it's
[18:47] going to take off it's going to find
[18:48] something what it's laying over the
[18:50] ditch
[18:51] and as we stop the car we look over
[18:55] and dad actually gets out and he said
[18:56] you know i don't want to let us suffer
[18:58] well as he gets out of the car
[19:00] the deer gets up
[19:02] and can barely walk and it walks starts
[19:04] walking back across the road
[19:06] as he's walking across the road dad just
[19:08] gets back in the car and said okay well
[19:09] maybe it's gonna be okay
[19:11] or it walks and it just stops right in
[19:12] front of our car so we can't move and it
[19:14] just looks into the into the window of
[19:16] the car
[19:18] so dad said well maybe it wants prayer
[19:19] so mom opens up the passenger side of
[19:22] her window
[19:23] and this buck walks right around to the
[19:24] passenger side of the window
[19:27] and sticks his head antlers and all
[19:29] inside the vehicle
[19:31] so we pray for it we begin to pray for
[19:34] it and we actually pick out all the
[19:36] grass and dirt that's in the antlers of
[19:38] that deer
[19:39] as soon as we get done praying for it
[19:41] dad that says go on and be healed in the
[19:43] name of jesus christ and as he says that
[19:46] that deer just eases his head back out
[19:47] the window and just
[19:49] nods to us and takes off running just as
[19:51] nothing's ever even been done to it
[19:53] before
[19:54] and i've seen miracles happen like that
[19:56] before in our life and if you say you i
[19:58] haven't seen a miracle like that we saw
[20:00] one last night we see one step in front
[20:02] of us every sunday morning when he comes
[20:04] out to preach
[20:06] we got we serve a goddess that works
[20:08] miracles
[20:10] and don't take for granted the miracle
[20:11] that comes and stands in front of us
[20:13] every sunday morning when he comes out
[20:16] let's just bow our heads and believe for
[20:17] everything that we are asking for can be
[20:19] answered
[20:20] [Music]
[20:22] lord jesus we just thank you for the
[20:23] wonderful opportunity that we have this
[20:25] morning
[20:27] the opportunity to come that that many
[20:29] take for granted and they don't even
[20:31] think to to come into service on a
[20:33] sunday morning or a sunday night or
[20:34] saturday night
[20:36] we can just come and we can offer every
[20:38] need that we have we can offer every
[20:40] every healing that we are asking for we
[20:43] can ask for prodigals to come home lord

[43:42] look over in the book of the poetry
[43:43] there in ecclesiastes
[43:45] uh chapter three
[43:47] ecclesiastes chapter three
[44:05] amen
[44:08] chapter 3 this morning and say amen when
[44:11] you have it
[44:20] i love that sound
[44:22] the pages of the bible
[44:24] just
[44:26] flowing open
[44:29] it's that scam it's that sound that
[44:31] scares the devil
[44:35] but it's more than just pages that he's
[44:37] scared of
[44:38] it's a people that have become a
[44:40] materialization
[44:41] of the very word of god
[44:44] ecclesiastes chapter 3 and verse 1
[44:47] for
[44:48] everything there is a season and a time
[44:52] for every purpose under heaven
[44:54] a time to be born and a time to die
[44:57] a time to plant and a time to pluck up
[45:00] that which is planted
[45:02] a time to cue and a time to heal
[45:04] a time to break down and a time to build
[45:06] up
[45:07] a time to weep and a time to laugh
[45:10] a time to mourn
[45:12] and a time to dance
[45:14] a time to cast away stones and a time to
[45:16] gather stones together a time to embrace
[45:19] and a time to refrain from embracing
[45:22] a time to seek and a time to lose a time
[45:25] to keep and a time to cast away
[45:28] a time to tear
[45:29] a time to sow time to keep silence and a
[45:32] time to speak
[45:33] a time to love and a time to hate a time
[45:36] for war
[45:37] and a time for peace
[45:39] and verse 11 says
[45:41] he hath made everything beautiful
[45:44] in his time may god bless his word he
[45:46] may be seated in the presence of the
[45:47] lord
[45:48] so as we have read here this morning we
[45:51] realize that there is a time for
[45:52] everything
[45:54] and we realize that that we are in one
[45:56] of the greatest greatest of times that
[45:58] we've ever been living in and but yet
[46:01] we're living in a time where so much is
[46:03] changing there's constantly change and
[46:05] if there's one thing that could be said
[46:07] is that if there's a constant in this
[46:09] life is that things change
[46:11] and we look out upon this world and we
[46:13] see that the changing of time is upon us
[46:15] as we look out upon the leaves and we
[46:17] realize that that the sap is going down
[46:19] out of the trees and we realize that the
[46:21] leaves will soon be falling and some
[46:23] starting to fall according to the
[46:25] different times and seasons and the and
[46:27] the migration of different things and
[46:29] and droughts and and waters and
[46:31] different things but everything is
[46:33] constantly changing and we realize that
[46:36] that change change happens and most of
[46:39] us as human beings we hate change my
[46:42] little daughter ally
[46:43] we can move a piece of furniture and she
[46:45] can break out in a tear just in a matter
[46:47] of seconds she's always done that from a
[46:49] little bitty baby she can break out and
[46:50] cry without a with within a drop of a
[46:53] hat but you move one piece of furniture
[46:55] and and she'll just begin to cry and
[46:57] said dad things are always changing
[47:00] and you know humanity we we don't like
[47:02] change we get comfortable in the way
[47:04] that we are and we just don't want to we
[47:06] don't want to move out of our comfort
[47:07] zone and we don't want to we don't like
[47:09] change but god god has given us a a
[47:12] scripture and a formula to know that
[47:15] change is a good thing as well change
[47:17] ain't always bad but change is always it
[47:21] isn't always a bad thing but change is
[47:22] for the good it just look at your own
[47:24] personal life and you look at how you
[47:26] were and you watched the change that
[47:28] happened it wasn't a bad thing because
[47:29] you were a rotten stinking scoundrel but
[47:31] you watched the change that come and
[47:33] happened in your life and we realized
[47:35] that man was built to advance and man
[47:38] was built to go on and move higher but
[47:40] when man become
[47:41] in a state of stagnancy and you realize
[47:44] that when men get when men get in that
[47:46] spot of stagnancy that they begin to
[47:48] lose at sight of the goal that is set
[47:51] before them and that is why that we must
[47:53] always stay persistent and we must
[47:56] always stay perseverant before the
[47:58] promises of god and realizing that that
[48:01] he is running after us just as much as
[48:03] we are running after him and there is a
[48:06] goal that is ahead and paul would say
[48:08] that that i am running this race with
[48:11] patience and there's a there's a goal
[48:13] that is set before us and and though
[48:15] though you might be running through this
[48:17] journey in life and there's things that
[48:19] you're running past and things that are
[48:21] changing in your view and in your
[48:22] scenery but realize that there's a goal
[48:25] that is ahead and we're looking at this
[48:27] this morning and realizing that there is
[48:29] a time for a change to happen and then
[48:33] we look at men that they they get into a
[48:35] spot of stagnancy and men get caught up
[48:38] in a job and they they lose they lose
[48:40] their love for the job or men get caught
[48:42] up in a relationship or they get bored
[48:44] with a relationship so they're looking
[48:45] for somebody else and come on somebody
[48:49] they're looking for a change of scenery
[48:51] they're looking for a a fresh a breath
[48:54] of fresh air and maybe a fresh outlook
[48:56] on life and humanity's got to humanity's
[48:59] always got to be moving and always got
[49:01] to be doing things but you know i know
[49:03] that there are things that sometimes
[49:05] that you just got to go on a vacation
[49:06] because you just need a break from you
[49:08] need a break from who you are you need a
[49:10] break from everything you've been
[49:12] through and you need a you need a
[49:13] vacation from yourself but yeah i'm so
[49:16] glad that god never has to have a change
[49:19] of scenery with you and i he he never
[49:21] gets tired of what he's looking at it
[49:23] even though we daily we fall and daily
[49:25] we we get back up and daily we we stay
[49:28] in his promises but i'm so glad that he
[49:30] don't get tired of looking at me and
[49:32] looking at my problems and looking at my
[49:34] anxieties or looking at my fears or
[49:36] looking at your problems but he's always
[49:39] there and to realize that there is a
[49:41] constancy in our life that that things
[49:44] are always changing we're advancing we
[49:46] want a better job we want a better house
[49:48] what is that showing it is showing that
[49:51] humanity was built to advance and if we
[49:54] could build these kind of vessels and
[49:56] these kind of buildings it is showing
[49:58] that there is something in the eternity
[50:01] that would make us long for something
[50:04] that does not change
[50:07] and we realize that god is the god that
[50:09] does not change and he's a god that
[50:12] always remains the same and this is what
[50:14] we realize that there is politics that
[50:17] are always changing the demographics of
[50:19] the land are always changing you watch
[50:22] as you watch buildings that you'll watch
[50:24] how that men will move a civilization
[50:27] and you will watch how that one place
[50:28] becomes deserted and the town moves on
[50:31] and it just goes outside of the skirts
[50:33] maybe a mile or two and you'll watch
[50:35] that place becomes a ghost town because
[50:37] they were not willing to move on with
[50:39] change in 2020 throughout a pandemic a
[50:42] lot of a lot of businesses didn't want
[50:45] to change so they died and they are a
[50:47] ghost town but people have to be able to
[50:50] adapt to change
[50:52] but this is what i want to get to you
[50:54] today before we move forward is that you
[50:57] are serving a god that does not change
[51:00] you don't have to advance into you don't
[51:02] have to advance and think my i've got to
[51:04] get up there with god or god's got to
[51:07] get down here with me god is not
[51:08] changing he is consistent in all of his
[51:11] ways he is he is not slack concerning
[51:14] his promises and just like we know that
[51:17] that that presidents can change their
[51:19] policies but a king can never change his
[51:22] promises if a king once says one thing
[51:25] it's got to come to pass exactly the way
[51:28] the king has wrote it and this i know
[51:31] that what jesus has said is forever the
[51:34] truth
[51:36] now notice what the bible says in psalms
[51:38] 102 and 24
[51:42] i said oh my god take me not away in the
[51:45] midst of my days thy years are
[51:47] throughout all generations of old hast
[51:50] thou laid the foundations of the earth
[51:52] the heavens are the work of thy hands
[51:55] but they shall perish but thou shall
[51:57] endure yea all of them shall wax old
[52:00] like a garment as a vesture shalt thou
[52:03] change them and they shall be changed
[52:05] but thou art the same and thy years
[52:09] shall have no end the children of thy
[52:11] servants shall continue and their seed
[52:14] shall be established before thee the
[52:17] things that we look at on a daily basis
[52:20] they might change the people around us
[52:22] might change there might be people that
[52:24] are around you that might walk away from
[52:26] this truth there might be people that
[52:28] are around you that might go by the way
[52:30] of the grave the scenery around you
[52:32] might change but the god who holds your
[52:35] destiny in his hands the god that knows
[52:37] your beginnings and the god that knows
[52:39] your endings the god that knows your
[52:40] good times and the god that knows your
[52:42] bad times the god that holds your life
[52:44] in his hands the god that knows every
[52:46] hair on your head the god that knows the
[52:49] fleas the god that knows all the
[52:50] sparrows is a god that is saying that i
[52:53] will not change everything around you is
[52:55] changing but as he said in malachi
[52:58] chapter 3 i am the lord our god and i
[53:00] change not but this is what i want you
[53:03] to know he's not just telling you that i
[53:06] won't change he's not just good enough
[53:08] to say that i'm not changing but this is
[53:10] he's saying is that his elect his seed
[53:14] shall remain and they shall be
[53:16] established in the earth
[53:18] there are things that are changing there
[53:20] are people that are moving there are
[53:22] people that are passing by but you as
[53:25] the elect of god have put on
[53:28] have put on a righteous robe by the
[53:31] blood of jesus christ change ain't
[53:33] always a bad thing but change will make
[53:35] you move to where god is wanting you at
[53:38] you remember when the prophet was up
[53:40] there at cherith where there was no rain
[53:42] for three and a half years that god was
[53:44] going to take care of his prophet
[53:46] when he was up there and and he got he
[53:48] got to a spot where there was no water
[53:50] but he went up there to the brook of
[53:52] cherith and there we realized that god
[53:55] was using a paradox to come feed him
[53:58] manna he would feed him manna through
[54:00] ravens that would come and one day the
[54:02] ravens stopped bringing food and one day
[54:05] the bible said in verse 7 that the brook
[54:07] dried up
[54:09] what was god doing he was making him to
[54:12] move on and you know we will go through
[54:14] spots of times like that in our life
[54:16] when things seem to be running out and
[54:19] seems things seem to be empty and things
[54:21] seem to dry up and man i really enjoyed
[54:24] those services a while ago but i i just
[54:26] don't know i just don't i don't feel the
[54:28] same way that i that i that i know i
[54:30] need to feel about it it's like the new
[54:32] has worn off you know it's just like
[54:34] that toy you got on christmas if you
[54:36] really if you if you really don't have a
[54:38] new birth
[54:40] the new aware off of it and church will
[54:42] just become some some meeting but this
[54:44] is more than just a meeting of of the
[54:46] minds and a meeting of people but this
[54:48] is a conference with the holy ghost but
[54:51] there will be times in your life in a
[54:54] season when it seems like god ain't came
[54:56] by your way but god ain't forgot you
[54:58] there might becomes in your life when
[55:00] you feel like man alive does god even
[55:03] love me i've been out here have been fed
[55:05] all these days and so many times we get
[55:08] like jonah and we care more about our
[55:10] little bitty tree than we care about the
[55:12] souls down there in enema
[55:16] and you know we look at these things and
[55:18] we say you know what god god doesn't
[55:20] love me he dried up these things and now
[55:23] i don't know if i really have an
[55:24] experience or not but i want to say this
[55:27] to you god's hardest words are not his
[55:30] last words
[55:33] his hardest words are not his last words
[55:36] you might go through a spot and it feels
[55:38] like man he has taken the belt to my
[55:40] heart
[55:42] he's whooped me upside down and one
[55:44] thing or another he beats me over this
[55:46] or he whips me over that
[55:49] ye i just feel like i'm going through a
[55:51] spot with well
[55:54] i don't even know if he loves me anymore
[55:56] it shows you're a son if you can stand
[55:58] the chastisement
[56:00] but those that are bastard children
[56:02] can't handle what you're going through
[56:05] his hardest words are not his last words
[56:08] and what god has for you ending at
[56:11] cherith will lead you to a zero path
[56:14] what is going to bless you in one spot
[56:17] is going to take you to another journey
[56:19] and when you get to xeropath you won't
[56:21] be the only one that will be eating
[56:23] meals and cakes but there will be a
[56:25] widow and her son
[56:28] you may have dried up in one spot but
[56:30] god's wanting to further your experience
[56:33] into the holy ghost
[56:35] god ain't wanting you to stay stale and
[56:37] stay comfortable where you're at and
[56:39] that's the problem with so many people
[56:41] that they get into a spot of
[56:43] justification and sanctification and
[56:45] they feel like i've went far enough and
[56:48] they'll stay right there and they are in
[56:49] a very dangerous and a very troublesome
[56:52] time as they get comfortable where
[56:54] they're living at they've got a new
[56:56] spirit but they don't have his spirit
[56:58] and they can feel the anointing come on
[56:59] their flesh and man can they get
[57:01] emotional man can they shout they are in
[57:04] a time but you cannot stop in the
[57:07] transition you have to move forward
[57:12] god's not willing
[57:14] that you would perish
[57:15] he's not willing that you would get
[57:17] stale in your experience but god is
[57:19] wanting to advance you
[57:21] into the holy ghost and you begin to
[57:24] watch as god comes down and begins to
[57:26] move over a congregation you'll watch as
[57:29] he begins to remove the staleness over
[57:32] that life
[57:33] you'll watch when somebody goes cold or
[57:35] they go formal and you'll watch one time
[57:38] in the presence of almighty god
[57:40] they're kind of like a chicken over
[57:42] there they they they you know that
[57:44] chicken is a bird just like an eagle
[57:46] it's got feathers just like an eagle but
[57:48] that chicken is an earthbound creature
[57:51] and it can't get no higher than just a
[57:53] little bitty feet or a few feet off of
[57:55] the ground but that eagle is built for a
[57:58] spot that he could fly into the
[58:00] heavenlies and that mother eagle is not
[58:03] willing that her children would walk
[58:05] around in a state of staleness and stay
[58:08] there and look like a bunch of chickens
[58:10] but when it comes for a time and a
[58:12] season when those little eaglets have
[58:15] feathered out
[58:16] mother looks at them and says it's time
[58:18] to stir the nest
[58:20] and if god let me say this to you feel
[58:22] like you got kicked out of the nest
[58:25] god has not forgot about you and god
[58:28] ain't going to let you fall to the
[58:29] ground god is going to raise you up
[58:32] because there's something laying on the
[58:34] inside of you that he deposited
[58:37] that nature is laying there
[58:41] you know there's some people that live a
[58:44] chicken life where they've got just
[58:46] enough religion just to make them
[58:48] miserable
[58:50] you watch a chicken and man and lava can
[58:52] get under the greatest auspices of the
[58:54] holy ghost and they can get so high but
[58:57] they'll never get no higher but you
[58:58] watch an eagle one time they'll soar up
[59:01] one time and they say hey i felt good
[59:03] i'm going up one more time i'm taking it
[59:06] up higher
[59:08] your wings were built so that you could
[59:11] come out of these things
[59:14] it's a time to change positions
[59:17] and god
[59:19] when we look at at the ending
[59:21] of the days of moses
[59:23] when he thought man
[59:25] what in the world are we going to do now
[59:27] our prophets gone
[59:29] but god began to take them in to the
[59:32] promises
[59:33] he began to lay out the borders
[59:36] and he had a changing of administration
[59:39] and you find that what the bible says in
[59:41] joshua 1 and 9 have not commanded thee
[59:45] be strong and of a good courage be not
[59:47] afraid neither be thou dismayed for the
[59:49] lord thy god is with thee whithersoever
[59:52] thou goest deuteronomy 31 8 and the lord
[59:56] then the lord he it is that doth go
[59:58] before thee he will be with thee he will
[1:00:01] not fail thee neither forsake thee fear
[1:00:04] not neither be dismayed there are going
[1:00:07] to come times in your spots
[1:00:09] in your life when there's changing
[1:00:11] happening that is happening around you
[1:00:13] maybe somebody goes off the scene or
[1:00:15] maybe your connection maybe have died
[1:00:17] out just for a minute but realize that
[1:00:20] it's a timing and a transition time that
[1:00:22] you are going to a spot when moses when
[1:00:26] moses could only take them so far it
[1:00:28] come time for joshua under his
[1:00:30] commission to take them into the land
[1:00:33] but do you think he caught god off
[1:00:35] surprise when moses went out there and
[1:00:38] smote the rock twice it didn't catch him
[1:00:40] off guard he knew he was making a way
[1:00:44] for a joshua commission to come in the
[1:00:46] past and this is what this message is
[1:00:49] it's a laying out of the borders
[1:00:53] the prophet could take you so far and
[1:00:55] the prophet could go but here jehovah
[1:00:57] jesus savior has come to lead you into
[1:01:00] the promises of the message of the hour
[1:01:03] and if you're not willing to advance
[1:01:05] into the holies of holies
[1:01:10] you'll stay out there where it's all
[1:01:11] cloudy you'll stay out there where it's
[1:01:13] all smoky
[1:01:14] and you're gonna get in trouble
[1:01:17] i'll tell you what'll happen if you get
[1:01:19] in that kind of condition in a spot of
[1:01:21] sanctification you'll get like aaron's
[1:01:23] two sons nadab and abyhu over in
[1:01:25] leviticus chapter 10 when they got out
[1:01:28] there and they try to create their own
[1:01:29] religion of the message and try to
[1:01:31] create their own ideas of how the holy
[1:01:34] ghost wants to be and how the holy ghost
[1:01:36] was supposed to be given and how the
[1:01:37] holy ghost was supposed to be preached
[1:01:40] and they brought in a strange fire and
[1:01:42] god killed them on the spot because god
[1:01:44] would never allow a strange fire to come
[1:01:47] in and take the place of the baptism of
[1:01:49] the holy ghost it ain't my idea it ain't
[1:01:52] my words it's god's words and the only
[1:01:55] thing that'll keep burning is the fire
[1:01:57] that was put on the altar in the very
[1:01:59] first place it's a holy fire
[1:02:03] that's too many people around the ranks
[1:02:05] of the message today they try to put a
[1:02:07] strange fire in things but it'll die
[1:02:09] right where it's at you watch people in
[1:02:11] their spiritual walk and you'll see that
[1:02:13] they can't go no further because they
[1:02:15] have died and god will never let a
[1:02:17] strange fire get in his way
[1:02:24] lord have mercy
[1:02:27] you remember when
[1:02:29] you remember when balaam
[1:02:31] when balaam was asked by bailiff
[1:02:33] he's one
[1:02:36] there's a lot of people jealous you
[1:02:40] he was wanting balaam
[1:02:42] that that was operating
[1:02:44] that was operating as a prophet
[1:02:46] he was wanting him to go up there and
[1:02:48] he was wanting him to go up here and
[1:02:50] curse israel
[1:02:51] but notice what balaam did he he did the
[1:02:53] right thing first he went up there and
[1:02:55] he shot god
[1:02:56] let me ask god what what his thoughts is
[1:02:58] on these things and god said don't touch
[1:03:00] a member of my people
[1:03:03] and that's what
[1:03:04] that's what the enemy is wanting to do
[1:03:06] is to is to curse you
[1:03:08] he's wanting to torment you and he's
[1:03:11] wanting to destroy you but i want to say
[1:03:13] this to you that god will never
[1:03:14] disappoint you that god will never let
[1:03:17] you down and god will never be proven
[1:03:20] wrong
[1:03:23] ah let me come down just a little bit
[1:03:25] further and god won't just be
[1:03:27] just he won't just come down and be
[1:03:29] proven wrong as himself but god will not
[1:03:32] allow he will not allow your experience
[1:03:36] to be
[1:03:37] proven wrong
[1:03:41] you know when the enemy comes in like a
[1:03:43] flood
[1:03:45] god will raise up the standard
[1:03:48] and when the enemy comes in to try to
[1:03:50] prove whether you got the goods or not
[1:03:52] god will make sure to prove that you got
[1:03:55] it
[1:03:56] he will prove his word that the same way
[1:03:59] they got it up there in acts 2 is the
[1:04:01] same way that you get it
[1:04:04] god ain't going to let you down god
[1:04:06] ain't going to back off of his promises
[1:04:08] god ain't going to let no man curse you
[1:04:10] how can you curse what god has decided
[1:04:13] to bless
[1:04:16] and balaam grabbed over in numbers 23-19
[1:04:19] that god is not a man
[1:04:23] humanity's fleeting and humanity's
[1:04:25] failing but god
[1:04:27] is not a man elohim is not a man
[1:04:31] he is the self-existing one he can do
[1:04:34] without the politics and the religions
[1:04:36] of the world but god is not a man that
[1:04:39] he could lie
[1:04:42] [Applause]
[1:04:44] neither the son of man that he should
[1:04:46] repent hath he said and shall he not do
[1:04:49] it or have he spoken it and shall he not
[1:04:51] make it good
[1:04:54] he is the same yesterday
[1:04:56] today
[1:04:58] and forever first corinthians 10 and 13
[1:05:01] the bible said there have no temptation
[1:05:03] taken you but such is common to man but
[1:05:05] god is faithful somebody say god is
[1:05:08] faithful
[1:05:10] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[1:05:12] above that that you are able but will
[1:05:14] with the temptation also make a way of
[1:05:17] escape that you may be able to bear it
[1:05:20] second corinthians 4 and 16
[1:05:23] for which cause we faint not
[1:05:25] but though our outward man perish yet
[1:05:28] the inward man is renewed
[1:05:30] day by day amen amen
[1:05:34] for our light affliction
[1:05:37] which is just for a moment
[1:05:39] worketh for us a far more exceeding an
[1:05:43] eternal weight of glory
[1:05:45] moses come to a spot and god said moses
[1:05:49] you have circled this mountain long
[1:05:51] enough
[1:05:52] it is time to move on you have circled
[1:05:55] the baptism of the holy ghost you have
[1:05:57] circled that spot of sanctification long
[1:06:00] enough
[1:06:01] it's time to move on and with those
[1:06:04] people of the old generation won't
[1:06:06] worship him god will raise up a new
[1:06:08] generation that'll worship him in spirit
[1:06:11] and in truth
[1:06:13] this is high time that the church of the
[1:06:16] living god raised to her potential
[1:06:18] [Applause]
[1:06:22] you remember
[1:06:24] you remember that indian chief
[1:06:26] he was up there and he said how you
[1:06:27] doing indian chief
[1:06:28] how you doing up here chief he's
[1:06:30] swelling not too good i got a warrant
[1:06:32] inside of me so what's going on
[1:06:34] what's going on so well i got two dogs
[1:06:36] on the inside of me one's white one's
[1:06:38] black
[1:06:39] and they're constantly growling and
[1:06:41] they're constantly fighting at one
[1:06:42] another and they said well well who
[1:06:44] who's winning he said the one that i
[1:06:46] feed the most
[1:06:48] and the one if you keep feeding your
[1:06:50] carnal nature that's the one to keep
[1:06:52] winning if you keep feeling sorry for
[1:06:54] yourself living in a spot of of just
[1:06:57] living here of of feelings and emotions
[1:07:00] you will never live any higher your
[1:07:03] christian faith is not built upon your
[1:07:05] emotions let me tell you god if god was
[1:07:08] building your your christian faithful
[1:07:10] emotions and what you feel and what you
[1:07:12] see it wouldn't be nobody's heading here
[1:07:15] but by the grace of god he didn't build
[1:07:17] your christian faith on what you see
[1:07:19] what you feel what you smell what your
[1:07:21] emotions are he built it thus on thus
[1:07:24] saith the lord
[1:07:28] are you going to feed
[1:07:29] who are you going to feed there is going
[1:07:31] to be a war inside
[1:07:34] but notice
[1:07:35] when paul goes over there in the book of
[1:07:38] hebrews and he starts preaching on the
[1:07:40] promises of god are more and greater
[1:07:45] and he goes over there in hebrews 9 and
[1:07:48] he starts pulling out that the blood of
[1:07:50] bulls and goats was there and it's
[1:07:53] sanctified to the purifying of the flesh
[1:07:57] he said but how much more
[1:08:00] how much more shall the blood of the
[1:08:03] lamb jesus christ also purge your
[1:08:07] conscience from dead works to serve a
[1:08:10] living god
[1:08:11] you don't know what i've been through
[1:08:12] brother andrew you don't know the mind
[1:08:14] battles that i go through i you don't
[1:08:16] know what i did in my past that's why
[1:08:18] there's a blood
[1:08:20] your emotions and your past man it's
[1:08:22] stacked up against you everybody here's
[1:08:24] gotta
[1:08:27] man i tell you what if we could read
[1:08:28] your first book

[1:08:43] let me get a little personal i'm glad
[1:08:44] that i can't read the fraser and the
[1:08:47] spencer's first book
[1:08:49] man it was a bunch of bad dudes in that
[1:08:52] thing a bunch of mixed up crowds a bunch
[1:08:54] of bootleggers and a bunch of
[1:08:55] moonshiners
[1:08:58] oh but the blood of jesus christ purges
[1:09:01] you from your conscience to serve a
[1:09:04] living god
[1:09:05] he said well i keep having these bad
[1:09:07] thoughts of what i did and what i should
[1:09:08] do and what i would what i fell into i
[1:09:10] believe the blood is big enough to purge
[1:09:13] your memory
[1:09:14] i believe that the blood is strong
[1:09:16] enough to purge every sin that was
[1:09:18] committed before you recognize and even
[1:09:21] after you recognize the blood is for you
[1:09:23] church of the living god and when the
[1:09:25] blood has set you free
[1:09:30] if you accept it if you accept this
[1:09:32] pardon it will purify your soul it'll
[1:09:35] purify your mind but a pardon is only a
[1:09:38] part in if it's accepted as a party the
[1:09:42] governor has walked into your chambers

[1:10:15] and say johnny go ahead and fly all the
[1:10:18] other birds are flying south the only
[1:10:20] thing that is keeping you there is your
[1:10:22] mind battle and we realize that that is
[1:10:24] where the greatest battles fall out
[1:10:27] anywhere it stays at though but you can
[1:10:29] go free you have been unchained by the
[1:10:32] anointing of almighty god
[1:10:37] i know it's been a little while for you
[1:10:42] i know it's been a little while for you
[1:10:46] you gave your heart to god
[1:10:49] and he fell back in
[1:10:50] he fell back in a little hole
[1:10:53] i know it's been a little while for you
[1:10:55] you forgot how to use him things
[1:10:59] but i would tell you you got what it
[1:11:00] takes to come off of it
[1:11:03] you got what it takes to come off the
[1:11:05] ground you got what it takes
[1:11:07] to live up there where you are built to
[1:11:09] live at
[1:11:12] oh i'm preaching to you today
[1:11:14] it's a time for you to change your
[1:11:16] thinking and change over to his thinking
[1:11:18] that's why paul would say in philippians
[1:11:20] 2 and 5 let this mind be in you which
[1:11:23] was also in christ jesus
[1:11:28] he took on the form of humanity so that
[1:11:30] he could think like humanity he could be
[1:11:32] like humanity and he proved that he had
[1:11:34] the power over death hell and the grave
[1:11:37] even humanity even the mind battles
[1:11:45] i am cleansed
[1:11:48] i am washed
[1:11:50] i am
[1:11:51] safety fire
[1:11:53] i'm holy ghost filled
[1:11:57] i water baptized
[1:12:00] i'm one with my god
[1:12:04] for all
[1:12:07] times
[1:12:08] cause jesus
[1:12:10] my savior
[1:12:13] he's alive
[1:12:24] it reaches
[1:12:28] to the
[1:12:29] highest mountain
[1:12:32] oh
[1:12:33] and it flows
[1:12:35] to the low
[1:12:39] over your habits
[1:12:41] over your addictions over all your
[1:12:43] complexes and your stigmas and mind
[1:12:45] battles it flows past those things
[1:12:49] he flows past your humanity it flows
[1:12:52] past what you think it flows past all of
[1:12:54] those things
[1:12:56] there's a blood trail
[1:12:59] that satan can't cross
[1:13:04] it's a time
[1:13:06] for change
[1:13:08] notice
[1:13:10] if god be forced then where be all his
[1:13:12] miracles he said and that's the same now
[1:13:14] it's time the time has come for action
[1:13:16] at the time has had come when playing
[1:13:18] church had come to a halt with god and
[1:13:21] there's no play in church we must get
[1:13:23] down to business and i trust that the
[1:13:25] same god will make this upon the heart
[1:13:27] of the people tonight that it's a time
[1:13:30] for a heart of playing church and
[1:13:32] playing religions and playing righteous
[1:13:34] and now it's a time for action as i was
[1:13:37] speaking this morning upon the subject
[1:13:38] of the new birth and what it was and how
[1:13:40] we how how we come to it surely that
[1:13:43] still sinks into your heart now the time
[1:13:45] has come to act upon what you know to be
[1:13:48] the truth you cannot act with faith
[1:13:50] until you first know
[1:13:52] what you're doing
[1:13:53] you've got to first know what you're
[1:13:55] doing before you can have faith to do it
[1:13:58] and someone had said to me one time i i
[1:14:00] know the doctrine was talking about a
[1:14:02] miracle that had happened among a six
[1:14:04] per a sick person and he said to me
[1:14:06] preacher don't you believe that if you
[1:14:08] told them people to go out and touch a
[1:14:10] tree or a post that the same thing would
[1:14:13] take place i said well no sir i said
[1:14:15] because you cannot have faith in
[1:14:17] touching a tree or a post
[1:14:18] faith is not that loose it's got to be
[1:14:21] based upon some noted fact that you've
[1:14:23] got to know something about what you're
[1:14:26] having faith in before you can have
[1:14:28] faith in it
[1:14:29] if it was that loose that you could go
[1:14:32] and touch that post right there man a
[1:14:34] lot of you got in trouble and you was a
[1:14:36] hundred miles away from that post well i
[1:14:39] guess god ain't god no more but your
[1:14:41] faith ain't in a post your faith ain't
[1:14:43] in a tree your faith ain't in your
[1:14:45] feeling your faith ain't in your emotion
[1:14:47] but your faith is based upon the what
[1:14:49] the blood has said about you
[1:14:53] you know when jesus is coming down to
[1:14:55] the close of his ministry and he comes
[1:14:57] over there that that he says howbeit
[1:15:00] when the spirit of truth has come that
[1:15:02] he will guide you into all truth he will
[1:15:05] take a mind and he will show it before
[1:15:08] you
[1:15:09] and we're living in an hour when we when
[1:15:12] when when men are following men
[1:15:15] i never thought that we'd come to a day
[1:15:17] like we've come to today in the social
[1:15:19] realm of things when people are going
[1:15:21] about man did you see who's following me
[1:15:26] man i got the most popular person down
[1:15:28] there church following me i got the i
[1:15:30] got the bishop where i got the i got the
[1:15:32] mayor following me when you know i was
[1:15:34] always raised all my life it was about
[1:15:36] who you following it was about following
[1:15:38] jesus it wasn't about the mayor it
[1:15:40] wasn't about who was following you it
[1:15:41] was about jesus you following jesus
[1:15:44] everywhere i could care less what you
[1:15:46] got on your insta face and all of your
[1:15:48] friends if you ain't got the friend
[1:15:50] jesus you ain't got one friend
[1:15:57] but the bible said that we have not
[1:15:58] received the spirit of the world but we
[1:16:01] have received the spirit of almighty god
[1:16:04] that he would lead us into these things
[1:16:06] and we know that christianity that
[1:16:08] mortals are influenced by this realm of
[1:16:11] the heaven above and we realize that
[1:16:13] there are demons that also influence so
[1:16:16] we are going to be influenced by one
[1:16:18] realm or another i have told you parents
[1:16:21] be careful and watch the influence
[1:16:25] if the influence has taken you away from
[1:16:27] the promises of god you're watching that
[1:16:30] that is not the comforter that'll guide
[1:16:32] you into all truth but if it's a
[1:16:34] comforter of the flesh
[1:16:40] it'll lead you to destruction but the
[1:16:42] comforter of the soul will lead you to
[1:16:46] all truth
[1:16:55] remember when he got up early
[1:16:57] when he got up there on that indian
[1:16:59] death walk
[1:17:01] he got up here on hurricane mountain he
[1:17:03] got walking around
[1:17:06] i'm a pretty good indian i got i got it
[1:17:08] laid up in my i got it laid up in my dna
[1:17:10] and
[1:17:11] you know you got that pride built up
[1:17:15] and that pride
[1:17:16] pride's a good thing
[1:17:18] if it's used in the right way
[1:17:21] but we realize that the crown of pride
[1:17:23] leads to destruction
[1:17:27] pride
[1:17:28] i think you ought to take pride in your
[1:17:29] work
[1:17:30] got to take pride in who you are as a
[1:17:32] son and daughter of god but pride can
[1:17:33] also lead you to destruction
[1:17:36] here he is walking around up there
[1:17:38] you know what he's doing up here
[1:17:40] you know what he's looking for and he
[1:17:42] gets up there and he gets circled up and
[1:17:44] he gets so confused and he gets so
[1:17:46] bombarded of where he's at and he gets
[1:17:48] up there he gets up there and he ain't
[1:17:50] got no god to lead him where he's going
[1:17:53] at and he thought you know i'm going to
[1:17:54] find my way out of here i i'm too good
[1:17:56] of a i'm too good of a tracker i'm too
[1:17:58] good of a hunter i'm too good there's no
[1:18:00] way i could get lost a pair how many
[1:18:02] does that sound like your life
[1:18:04] you've gotten yourself in a condition
[1:18:06] well i can get myself out of this i get
[1:18:08] myself out of this trouble i'm getting
[1:18:15] but finally he got to a spot
[1:18:18] and he said god
[1:18:20] i have done got lost on where i'm at i
[1:18:23] didn't got fogged up in this kind of
[1:18:25] condition up here on this mountain and i
[1:18:27] can't get to where i'm supposed to be
[1:18:29] going at but god if you could just lay
[1:18:32] your hand on me and point me in the
[1:18:35] right direction so i know where to go at
[1:18:37] and god is as good as his word he's an
[1:18:40] ever-present help in the time of trouble
[1:18:43] he will lead you he will guide you into
[1:18:46] all truth
[1:18:48] oh yeah
[1:18:50] young people get fogged up in their mind
[1:18:51] is this right or is that wrong or is
[1:18:53] this right or do i follow this thing or
[1:18:55] follow that thing if you ain't following
[1:18:57] christ you're following the wrong thing
[1:18:58] [Applause]
[1:19:04] i i know you've been praying i know
[1:19:06] you've been praying i want you to be
[1:19:08] watching for something
[1:19:10] there's going somebody come by and lay
[1:19:12] their hand on you and when they do it's
[1:19:14] time to turn back to look where the sky
[1:19:16] is part of that it'll lead you in the
[1:19:18] right direction
[1:19:20] but you can't stop right there
[1:19:22] you got to go down through say hey i've
[1:19:23] been in this spot before i've been in
[1:19:25] this condition before i've been up here
[1:19:28] on this mountain before i know that if i
[1:19:31] can ever get a hold of that line up
[1:19:33] there if i can touch that line it'll
[1:19:35] lead me back to everything that i hold
[1:19:37] dear and everything that i hold true in
[1:19:39] this world and he just kept walking with
[1:19:41] a gun in one hand and his hand up and he
[1:19:44] was going along his way he was trusting
[1:19:46] in him and if you could ever get your
[1:19:48] line up
[1:19:51] it's already set over top of you but all
[1:19:54] you've got to do is raise your hand
[1:19:57] raise your hand
[1:19:59] you'll touch that line
[1:20:05] oh you'll touch that line
[1:20:06] it was a time when pride had to fall
[1:20:08] away and he had to come back and say god
[1:20:11] i need your help
[1:20:13] but too many times people get prideful
[1:20:14] and say i can do this on my own
[1:20:18] you have had a true
[1:20:20] way of a prophet set before you
[1:20:24] you've had a vindicated prophet set
[1:20:26] before you
[1:20:28] you've had the supernatural set before
[1:20:29] you
[1:20:30] you just reached back up there i i lost
[1:20:33] sight
[1:20:34] i got cold
[1:20:35] i'll let something sneak in
[1:20:37] but god if you can
[1:20:41] you just let me get up here
[1:20:46] i got a pair of my own human spirit
[1:20:49] i got a pair of my own human ability
[1:20:53] i couldn't find my way out of it if i
[1:20:55] wanted to
[1:20:57] i got myself in a mess
[1:21:02] i'm gonna tell you get a hold of this
[1:21:03] line
[1:21:04] the storms may come the fogs may come
[1:21:08] and the troubles may come but get a hold
[1:21:09] of that line and don't you ever let it
[1:21:11] go
[1:21:14] i was in a spot of confusion but one
[1:21:17] time my hand at the lie
[1:21:20] i decided i ain't gonna let go of it and
[1:21:22] it led me right back to what i held dear
[1:21:24] in life
[1:21:27] you'll go through cycles of revival and
[1:21:29] death and rival and death because you
[1:21:31] lost your first love
[1:21:43] i don't know what else to do
[1:21:45] don't ever let go
[1:21:48] well i just throw up my hands
[1:21:51] and i start praising the
[1:21:54] lord i'm all by myself up here don't
[1:21:57] worry
[1:21:58] he knows how to get you out of it
[1:22:02] it's a time
[1:22:03] for a change
[1:22:06] you remember when when gideon was living
[1:22:08] in an hour when the midianites had come
[1:22:10] in and the many nights over in judges
[1:22:12] chapter 6 and i got time to read it to
[1:22:14] you but you remember when they got over
[1:22:16] there in that spot when they when when
[1:22:18] the israelites had done evil in the
[1:22:20] sight of the lord and the million lights
[1:22:22] had had control over top of the nation
[1:22:24] for seven years
[1:22:27] and he had they had control over and
[1:22:29] what they would do is they would come in
[1:22:31] and they would oppress the land for
[1:22:33] these seven years and they would come in
[1:22:35] like an invading locust and they would
[1:22:37] destroy and that's way the enemy always
[1:22:39] does he comes in at harvest time
[1:22:42] when everything's right for season and
[1:22:44] here these midianites would come in like
[1:22:46] an invading bug and they would eat down
[1:22:48] the very life off of the tree and there
[1:22:50] they would come in and they would camp
[1:22:52] around the air around the sites of
[1:22:54] israel and they would come in and they
[1:22:57] would destroy the crops they would
[1:22:58] destroy their animals they would plunder
[1:23:01] through their homes all this was done
[1:23:03] because they started serving
[1:23:06] a strange god
[1:23:09] but god has always had one person that
[1:23:12] he could put his hand on and he found
[1:23:15] this little coward
[1:23:17] to you and i
[1:23:19] to you and i he looked like a coward he
[1:23:21] was back there hiding
[1:23:24] he was back there hiding and he was
[1:23:26] stretching out the wheat
[1:23:28] because he wanted just a little bit for
[1:23:30] his family
[1:23:32] and notice what he said
[1:23:35] thou mighty
[1:23:36] man of valor
[1:23:39] you were just doing
[1:23:41] what you were called to do
[1:23:43] and he called you what you were
[1:23:46] he didn't call you what you look like
[1:23:53] aren't you glad he didn't call you what
[1:23:54] do you look like
[1:23:57] i could tell you there's a lot of you
[1:23:58] i'm in your boat with you we didn't look
[1:24:00] like sons
[1:24:04] but he didn't call me what i look like
[1:24:06] he called me what i was
[1:24:09] you are a mighty man a valor and what
[1:24:12] did gideon do the very first thing that
[1:24:15] he did he went up there
[1:24:17] and he destroyed
[1:24:19] his father's idols
[1:24:23] now notice
[1:24:24] the scripture portrays to us that gideon
[1:24:28] and his ten men 11 go up there at night
[1:24:31] time to destroy the the the idols of
[1:24:34] baal and here when there was one that
[1:24:37] was a son of perdition that wouldn't go
[1:24:39] all the way but there was an eleven that
[1:24:41] would go on into the preaching of the
[1:24:43] furthing of the baptism of the holy
[1:24:45] ghost and here we are as the 11th hour
[1:24:48] workers and we're going to get the same
[1:24:50] reward we're going to get the same holy
[1:24:52] ghost
[1:24:53] and it's a time like never before to go
[1:24:56] in and destroy
[1:25:00] destroy the idols
[1:25:02] of country music
[1:25:07] oh you was told it was okay to listen to
[1:25:10] but you listened to it so long that it
[1:25:12] destroyed your very spirit
[1:25:15] you listened to your own mind games and
[1:25:18] you stood there but it's time that you
[1:25:20] rise up and destroy the works of the
[1:25:23] enemy
[1:25:24] why brother andrew country music ain't
[1:25:26] that bad
[1:25:27] are you serious you know listen hi and
[1:25:30] listen to country music and god knows
[1:25:31] how long but i can tell you when i was
[1:25:34] back in the day when i was an idiot
[1:25:36] listen to that stuff i had everything in
[1:25:38] the world robbed from me by one song
[1:25:43] lost my girlfriend lost my dog to my
[1:25:45] best friend jake
[1:25:52] but i like that southern gospel
[1:25:56] brother andrew
[1:25:58] it just
[1:25:59] [Music]
[1:26:00] you got to watch the spirit of that too
[1:26:05] before long you're up here worshiping
[1:26:10] like bill gaither
[1:26:16] lord what have you got me into
[1:26:20] i'm preaching on a time for change
[1:26:27] it's a time to destroy
[1:26:29] i can live with that in my closet really
[1:26:32] can you
[1:26:33] you might be able to live and get by
[1:26:35] as a layout of seeing but you cannot
[1:26:36] live and get by as a church of the
[1:26:38] living god
[1:26:40] gideon and the
[1:26:42] israelites could hide all they want to
[1:26:44] back there in their closet and they had
[1:26:47] nothing but stinking skeletons back
[1:26:49] there
[1:26:50] hiding in their claws hiding in there
[1:26:52] for pants hiding they never make up
[1:26:54] hiding in there with their music that
[1:26:56] was destroying the very spirit of their
[1:26:58] soul
[1:26:59] it was destroying and eating away all of
[1:27:02] their experience and they went back
[1:27:04] there to their habits
[1:27:06] but god was once somebody that would
[1:27:09] raise up and say hey it's time for a
[1:27:11] change it's time that we start hiding
[1:27:14] like a bunch of scaredy cats and we come
[1:27:16] out front and we start destroying these
[1:27:18] many nights
[1:27:21] he didn't call you what you look like he
[1:27:23] called you what you were and he said go
[1:27:26] in your strength you may have been born
[1:27:28] in a poor house of manessa but i got
[1:27:30] something laying on the inside of you
[1:27:32] that's built for the challenge
[1:27:34] you can change this situation
[1:27:37] young people
[1:27:38] [Applause]
[1:27:40] watch a change start happening
[1:27:43] [Applause]
[1:27:50] i don't know if i have strength brother
[1:27:52] let's do it again
[1:27:56] you remember that little stream
[1:27:59] there's always bubbling
[1:28:05] it's because of birds
[1:28:07] said you're always happy
[1:28:09] you're always happy why is it because
[1:28:11] the birds come and drink from you is it
[1:28:12] because humanity or is it because this
[1:28:15] no it's none of those reasons
[1:28:20] i look at brother shannon
[1:28:22] i think man
[1:28:26] how can he stay bubbling not me
[1:28:28] personally i i understand why he's
[1:28:30] bubbling but he abused people
[1:28:33] and look
[1:28:34] how in that thing there
[1:28:36] can he stay bubbling like that
[1:28:41] surely he's on the stuff
[1:28:44] [Applause]
[1:28:46] i knew it
[1:28:48] he couldn't live that way all that time
[1:28:50] he went back that old stinking drinking
[1:28:56] no
[1:28:57] he found a new wine
[1:29:07] you look at him
[1:29:09] yeah i've been done everything to him i
[1:29:12] put i put cancer in the pastor

[1:29:33] it's him behind me public
[1:29:37] it's him behind me pushing me it's him

[1:30:33] battle
[1:30:34] i said no
[1:30:37] that's too much
[1:30:38] that's too much
[1:30:41] they can't go all the way
[1:30:43] like you're going
[1:30:46] scenery around me changing
[1:30:48] the numbers are getting smaller all we
[1:30:50] can we've been going through layout to
[1:30:52] see it seems like
[1:30:54] since 1960 manual numbers keep getting
[1:30:56] smaller what in the world
[1:30:58] it's too much
[1:30:59] it's too much
[1:31:01] now let's take them down here to this
[1:31:03] brook
[1:31:05] let's see how they do
[1:31:07] are they still serving that old god of
[1:31:08] bale
[1:31:09] or they got their eyes on a real prize
[1:31:12] you see if you
[1:31:14] if you get your eyes on a stagnant god
[1:31:17] it'll make you stagnant but if you got
[1:31:19] your eyes on a living and moving god
[1:31:21] you'll keep your eyes up there where the
[1:31:23] promises don't ever change or don't ever
[1:31:26] cease and you'll keep your eyes up there
[1:31:28] and you'll watch there'll be some
[1:31:29] scenery change around you your loved
[1:31:31] ones might walk away from you but you
[1:31:33] want to be 300 that'll walk out there
[1:31:36] and some real sons and daughters of god
[1:31:39] and take down 122
[1:31:41] 000 million nights because they were
[1:31:44] under the auspices of a general by the
[1:31:46] name of gideon that was a mighty man of
[1:31:48] valor we are under the auspice of the
[1:31:52] holy ghost he's a mighty man he's a
[1:31:55] champion of champions he's a king of
[1:31:57] kings he's a lord of lords he's greater
[1:32:00] than alcohol he's greater than tobacco
[1:32:02] he's greater than your spirit of
[1:32:04] depression he's greater than your
[1:32:06] disease he is a champion
[1:32:09] and he's still gonna win no matter what
[1:32:11] you put him through he ain't changing he
[1:32:14] ain't lost the battle yet
[1:32:21] we'll not be defeated
[1:32:23] we'll not be defeated we'll not be
[1:32:26] defeated anymore
[1:32:29] well since jesus christ god's only son
[1:32:32] he fought to battle anyone i will not be
[1:32:36] defeated
[1:32:37] anymore
[1:32:43] i've been living that defeated life
[1:32:45] brother andrew it's time to come up here
[1:32:48] and stop a living
[1:32:50] in a defeated spot
[1:32:51] and start walking to the undefeated
[1:32:54] realm that you were called to
[1:32:58] it's time for a change
[1:33:01] it's time for a change
[1:33:03] i don't know how i can put the music out
[1:33:07] i don't know how i
[1:33:09] sometimes i
[1:33:11] sometimes i get caught up in all the
[1:33:12] confusion of all the
[1:33:14] all the music going at one time
[1:33:16] the
[1:33:17] the trombone's going and the triangle is
[1:33:19] going and
[1:33:20] and the drums are going and the trumpets
[1:33:22] are going and all the all the all the
[1:33:25] all the horn instruments are going and
[1:33:26] all the all the all the string
[1:33:28] instruments are going i i just can't
[1:33:30] seem to find
[1:33:31] my spot where it's at
[1:33:34] you watch as that director comes
[1:33:37] he'll bring some real peace to the chaos
[1:33:40] and you'll think man alive
[1:33:45] how in the world
[1:33:46] [Music]
[1:33:47] can it get those people
[1:33:48] in sync
[1:33:51] they they're so
[1:33:53] they're so
[1:33:54] they got so many things on them
[1:33:56] and you watch that director come
[1:34:02] here's this
[1:34:03] director's stick this morning
[1:34:05] he takes that little stick
[1:34:07] and he starts waving it
[1:34:12] and he brings a piece over the people
[1:34:14] that's a weird stick
[1:34:18] and he brings a piece
[1:34:20] and all of a sudden you think
[1:34:22] there's no way that she's going to make
[1:34:25] it
[1:34:26] there's no way she can put forth that
[1:34:28] kind of broad music
[1:34:30] and all of a sudden
[1:34:31] the director takes charge
[1:34:35] and all of a sudden there comes a change
[1:34:37] over the atmosphere
[1:34:39] and everything comes in order
[1:34:42] and she starts playing that bride music
[1:34:46] that only she knows how to play
[1:34:49] and then he calls one from all the way
[1:34:51] down there in a spot in buena vista
[1:34:53] virginia there's no way they'll ever
[1:34:56] live it right
[1:34:57] and the director grabs a hold of the
[1:34:59] word
[1:35:00] and there's a people from univista that
[1:35:03] scream out amen
[1:35:05] there's no way those
[1:35:07] hillbillies from grottos can ever make
[1:35:09] that bride music work
[1:35:13] and he starts
[1:35:14] sweeping over them
[1:35:16] and they start saying amen to the days
[1:35:19] of miracles are not past that he's still
[1:35:21] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:35:24] he'll go all the way back in the hills
[1:35:27] of west virginia and he'll get a little
[1:35:29] red-headed girl
[1:35:31] there's no way she'll play that music
[1:35:33] satan you just watch
[1:35:36] you watch the director's got his hand
[1:35:38] and his wand in his hand and he's
[1:35:40] whooping it and he's swirling and he's
[1:35:42] bringing peace over the chaos of life
[1:35:50] he will do the work
[1:35:55] i don't know if i'm going to say this
[1:35:56] right
[1:35:57] but there was a great violinist by the
[1:35:59] name of paganini
[1:36:02] i did it
[1:36:05] one time
[1:36:07] he was going ready getting ready to go
[1:36:08] out before a great audience
[1:36:10] and he grabs his violin and he goes out
[1:36:12] before the people and the people are
[1:36:14] roaring
[1:36:16] paganini
[1:36:17] the great violinist has come
[1:36:20] he waits for the rush of the of the huss
[1:36:22] and everything to fall
[1:36:24] and he starts looking down at his
[1:36:26] instrument
[1:36:27] i said something's wrong
[1:36:30] i'm wrong here
[1:36:32] this ain't my violin
[1:36:34] something is
[1:36:35] something
[1:36:36] something is wrong and he begins to tell
[1:36:38] the people that there's something wrong
[1:36:40] just give me a minute and he goes back
[1:36:42] in the back to where his violin was
[1:36:45] and he realized that somebody has stole
[1:36:48] his famous violin
[1:36:50] and he walks out before the people and
[1:36:52] said i'm sorry
[1:36:54] there's been a great mistake that has
[1:36:56] taken place
[1:36:58] somebody has come and stole
[1:37:00] my famous violin
[1:37:03] but i want to show you
[1:37:05] that it's not in the violin but it's in
[1:37:08] the soul
[1:37:10] and he starts taking that worthless
[1:37:12] piece of junk of violin
[1:37:15] what was it doing the master had it in
[1:37:17] his hand
[1:37:20] and you may have looked
[1:37:25] i know there ain't no way they can do it
[1:37:28] ain't no way a justin clyde could live
[1:37:30] that kind of message ain't no way that
[1:37:33] jason shiftly could ever do it i know
[1:37:36] good and well that greg mays can't do it
[1:37:40] so i'll take one of them
[1:37:42] important people so-called important
[1:37:44] people and i'll put him in that place
[1:37:48] ain't no way he could play this kind of
[1:37:50] music
[1:37:51] and all of a sudden god starts taking
[1:37:54] his bow
[1:37:56] and he starts strumming it across the
[1:37:58] life
[1:37:58] of greg mays
[1:38:01] [Music]
[1:38:05] he's the one playing the music
[1:38:08] he's the one that's strumming across
[1:38:10] your life
[1:38:12] you could have never come to this
[1:38:13] position
[1:38:14] you could have never raised to this spot
[1:38:17] but he decided
[1:38:20] oh the enemy came in to steal to kill
[1:38:22] and destroy
[1:38:24] he tried to destroy he tried to rob and
[1:38:26] strip everything off of him
[1:38:30] let's just face it some of your strings
[1:38:32] have done been broke
[1:38:37] and everything's out of whack
[1:38:40] but he starts tuning
[1:38:43] the very characteristics of your life
[1:38:47] and you start portraying
[1:38:49] that's him
[1:38:51] and then for a while it looked like man
[1:38:55] there's no way
[1:38:57] that jim noel will ever get in tune
[1:39:01] and he starts bending that thing
[1:39:04] and he starts strumming it and it's
[1:39:05] almost there
[1:39:07] it's almost there
[1:39:09] and two
[1:39:10] just somebody of a normal while they
[1:39:12] think that strain's gonna break at any
[1:39:14] moment but he knows how much he can take
[1:39:18] and he starts putting those strings in
[1:39:20] place
[1:39:21] and he starts playing
[1:39:23] on the wings
[1:39:25] of a snow white dove
[1:39:27] and these are the things that are to be
[1:39:40] and he starts playing
[1:39:42] over your life
[1:39:45] the sweetest love song
[1:39:48] i
[1:39:49] am redeemed
[1:39:54] when you were worthless
[1:39:57] he made the most beautiful music
[1:40:00] come across your life
[1:40:04] you were in a spot where you weren't
[1:40:05] able to be god
[1:40:07] but he knew what you were hiding it
[1:40:11] when you go to reading
[1:40:14] over over in the book of luke chapter 8
[1:40:16] and you see a woman that's got an issue
[1:40:20] i mean she's got a bad issue
[1:40:22] 12 years she's lived with this
[1:40:24] but she comes in
[1:40:28] i laid it all down on the line
[1:40:30] to grab a hold of him
[1:40:34] and the bible said when she touched him
[1:40:38] things began to change
[1:40:41] the people around him began to rebuke
[1:40:42] and said
[1:40:43] you're supposed to be the great messiah
[1:40:47] and you're saying who touched me
[1:40:48] everybody's touching you
[1:40:50] there was something different about this
[1:40:52] woman
[1:40:54] and when she realized
[1:40:56] that she couldn't hide no more
[1:41:00] she began to declare
[1:41:02] that these were the things that he done
[1:41:06] you can't hide no more
[1:41:08] you had faith enough to touch him now
[1:41:10] it's time to release your testimony
[1:41:15] i want you to know he's he's got his bow
[1:41:17] in his hand
[1:41:19] and he's strumming
[1:41:21] the great
[1:41:23] position
[1:41:25] now it's there
[1:41:28] i've been so broken and abused
[1:41:31] and he starts fixing you
[1:41:33] each stroke
[1:41:36] oh how i love him

[1:41:45] and you start seeking out
