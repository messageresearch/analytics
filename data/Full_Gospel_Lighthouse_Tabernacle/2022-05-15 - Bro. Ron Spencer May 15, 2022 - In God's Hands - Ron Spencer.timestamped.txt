[45:19] it on the shelf enjoy it
[45:21] and we won't preach you anything outside
[45:23] of the word of the lord and so that's
[45:25] what we believe that's what we're
[45:26] committed to this morning amen if you
[45:29] will turn with me to first timothy
[45:30] chapter 4 and verse 12.
[45:35] amen
[45:38] i would like to speak to you this
[45:40] morning and the lord has dealt with me
[45:42] over the last couple of weeks on this
[45:44] phrase
[45:45] in god's hands
[45:48] and
[45:50] in god's hands
[45:52] i think i think if we could come to the
[45:54] conclusion today we're very thrilled
[45:57] that we're in god's hands
[46:01] the reason this is so important to us
[46:03] today
[46:05] is because the world is in chaos
[46:09] world war iii is upon us
[46:11] if you can't see that the you're not
[46:14] paying attention
[46:16] every week
[46:17] there's an escalation
[46:19] of nuclear disaster
[46:22] israel is preparing for major conflict
[46:25] it's not getting a lot of
[46:27] attention in our in our media
[46:30] but there's a lot of conflict that is
[46:32] going on in israel they're fighting for
[46:35] their borders
[46:38] and yet at the same time in all of this
[46:40] chaos
[46:42] there's a bride that is in good shape
[46:46] and she stands around the world whether
[46:49] she's in ukraine
[46:51] or or wherever country that she's in
[46:54] god is making a way for her and in it
[46:57] all we are enjoying the refreshing of
[47:00] the presence of the lord
[47:02] last night we experienced a sweep
[47:05] of the holy spirit like like a new one i
[47:08] never quite seen like before
[47:11] recognizing it was the angel of the lord
[47:14] and
[47:14] and
[47:15] and listen don't never miss out on those
[47:17] things
[47:19] so we're watching what's happening
[47:21] if i could just say it like this
[47:24] we had a prophet that stood in two
[47:26] worlds at the same time
[47:30] and now there's a bride that stands in
[47:32] two worlds
[47:38] did you catch that
[47:41] at the same time
[47:43] amen
[47:44] first timothy chapter 4 and verse 12
[47:47] let no man despise thy youth
[47:51] but be thou an example of of the
[47:54] believers in word
[47:57] in conversation
[47:59] in charity
[48:01] in spirit
[48:04] in
[48:04] faith
[48:06] in purity
[48:08] now if you will turn with me to john
[48:10] chapter 20 and verse 24
[48:16] i'll be standing for quite a while you
[48:18] can kind of relax your legs there for a
[48:20] minute
[48:26] john chapter 20 and verse 24
[48:29] but thomas one of the twelve called
[48:31] didymus
[48:34] was not with them when jesus came
[48:38] the other disciples therefore said unto
[48:40] him
[48:42] we have seen the lord what a statement
[48:46] we have seen the lord
[48:49] but he said unto them except
[48:52] i shall see
[48:55] in it
[48:56] except i shall see in his hands the
[48:58] print of the nails
[49:01] and put my finger
[49:03] in the print of the nails and thrust my
[49:06] hand into his side
[49:09] i will not believe
[49:12] and after eight days again the disciples
[49:14] were
[49:15] within and thomas said unto them
[49:18] and then jesus
[49:20] and then came jesus and the door shut
[49:23] and the door stood in the midst
[49:25] and stood in the midst and said
[49:28] peace be unto you
[49:31] and then he said to thomas
[49:34] reach hither
[49:36] thy finger
[49:38] and behold my hands
[49:41] and reach hither thy hand
[49:44] and thrust it into my side
[49:47] and be not faithless
[49:49] but believing
[49:52] and thomas answered and said unto him
[49:55] my lord
[49:57] and my god
[50:00] and jesus said unto him thomas
[50:03] because thou has seen me
[50:06] thou has believed
[50:08] now here's where you are
[50:10] blessed are they
[50:12] that have not seen
[50:15] and yet have believed
[50:19] you may be seated
[50:29] i dare say that nobody told jesus
[50:33] that thomas is doubting
[50:35] amen
[50:38] i dare say that when jesus was in the
[50:40] room
[50:42] when jesus calls thomas out
[50:45] of all of those men
[50:47] and he tells him
[50:50] put your finger in my print
[50:54] he realized that jesus knew of a
[50:56] conversation
[50:58] a week ago
[51:03] thomas put your hand in my sight
[51:07] to see where that sword was
[51:11] thomas did
[51:12] and then thomas said
[51:14] my lord and my god
[51:16] and then jesus tells him
[51:20] blessed are you
[51:23] for you see
[51:25] but blessed are those that
[51:28] believe
[51:30] and they never get the opportunity to
[51:32] see
[51:34] last night i was i was sitting on the
[51:37] stage here
[51:42] and this came in my heart i've just been
[51:44] studying and pieces have been of the
[51:46] puzzle has come together
[51:49] sometimes we don't recognize that
[51:52] that every day is supernatural
[51:56] and that we as individuals here 2000
[51:59] years later are in his hands
[52:02] though we don't see him
[52:04] and though we don't feel him
[52:07] and though that
[52:08] you know we're maybe not in a spiritual
[52:11] mode at the moment
[52:12] but we're in his hands
[52:16] there was a wreck that happened
[52:18] brother shannon and and brother greg was
[52:21] coming home from mckee
[52:23] and they came up on another wreck and
[52:25] they tried to avoid that wreck
[52:28] and they went flipping through the air
[52:31] destroying that jeep
[52:33] as i look back on it as i drive past
[52:36] that place it looks absolutely almost
[52:39] impossible
[52:42] of how they landed
[52:44] and how they didn't hit trees head-on
[52:48] or take the literally the whole lid off
[52:50] of that thing
[52:52] and and just kill them both in the
[52:54] moment
[52:56] it looked like angels
[52:58] took them up
[53:00] and laid them down
[53:05] i was sitting i was sitting in a chair
[53:07] later that night and i was just thinking
[53:09] on some things and i was
[53:11] i was reading in christ the mystery of
[53:14] god revealed
[53:16] and i came to a certain paragraph
[53:19] paragraph 71
[53:22] brother branham says this he said
[53:25] he jesus
[53:27] should be the principle that's right we
[53:29] believe it
[53:31] don't we he said and if he is that
[53:34] then he should be the principal theme
[53:38] of our talking
[53:40] of our thinking of our singing
[53:43] of our walks
[53:45] and he should be the principal theme of
[53:48] our life
[53:51] and if he is the principal theme of our
[53:54] life
[53:56] and the bible is in us of the bible and
[53:59] the bible is in us
[54:01] he should be the principal thing
[54:04] theme of everything that we do
[54:07] or
[54:08] think
[54:10] everything should be
[54:12] christ
[54:17] now
[54:18] here's how here's how that worked out
[54:21] i sent that
[54:23] i clipped that and sent that to brother
[54:25] shannon
[54:26] and brother shannon immediately
[54:28] responded that's the last words i heard
[54:32] before our
[54:34] our jeep flipped in the air
[54:43] now you think of the odds of all of that
[54:48] of over almost 1200 books
[54:52] 1200 messages
[54:54] i'm reading the message that he was
[54:56] listening to in the jeep
[55:00] and i come to this certain paragraph and
[55:03] god speaks to me send that to brother
[55:06] shannon
[55:08] and it happens to be the words
[55:12] that was being spoken as they were
[55:14] flipping in the air and it's the last
[55:16] thing that they remember
[55:22] i think that we
[55:24] we should realize real quickly
[55:27] in all of our lives
[55:28] we're in his hands
[55:36] we're in his hands
[55:39] in him was
[55:40] all the fullness of god
[55:43] in him was the fullness of god and the
[55:45] fullness of the promise
[55:48] when we're baptized into him
[55:51] we have every promise
[55:55] that god made laid at our fingertips
[56:00] no sin is there no death is there
[56:04] and even sickness can't stay in his
[56:07] presence
[56:10] if satan then puts his hands on you and
[56:13] tries to tempt you into something you
[56:16] hold your token in your hands and show
[56:19] it that you're a redeemed
[56:21] product of jesus christ
[56:24] let your
[56:26] unadulterated faith wave that token
[56:29] there i am a product
[56:32] of jesus christ
[56:36] [Applause]
[56:47] the token is the word to identify you
[56:51] living
[56:52] itself out
[56:54] that's god's
[56:56] being his own interpreter
[57:00] the interpretation
[57:02] of the word
[57:04] lives in you
[57:07] it's a living word
[57:09] it's a living attribute
[57:12] i want to see god god's living
[57:15] in your life
[57:19] he says you don't have to say well well
[57:22] now you interpret my tongue
[57:24] that ain't it he interprets your life by
[57:28] the word and when he takes your word
[57:31] what you are and identify his word
[57:34] through there
[57:36] there don't need to be any
[57:37] interpretation
[57:39] it's already there god does his own
[57:41] interpretation
[57:43] and we have his promises for this day
[57:47] god's way of doing anything is speak the
[57:50] word
[57:52] and the word is the entire revelation of
[57:55] jesus christ nothing to be added to it
[57:58] nothing to be taken away from it
[58:01] whatsoever does it the bible says his
[58:04] part whosoever does it or takes away
[58:07] from her adds to it his part will be
[58:09] taken out of the lamb's book of life
[58:13] the bible doesn't need
[58:15] anybody to interpret it
[58:18] god is his own interpreter
[58:21] [Applause]
[58:22] [Music]
[58:26] now if we can say this about this this
[58:29] book what about our life
[58:34] god don't need our opinions
[58:37] he don't need our additional thoughts to
[58:40] it
[58:48] brother brown said now break to us the
[58:50] bread of life as we open back the pages
[58:52] of the word
[58:54] because we know that the bible is of no
[58:58] private
[58:59] interpretation
[59:01] god doesn't need us to interpret his
[59:04] life
[59:06] he is his own interpreter
[59:10] he said one day let there be and there
[59:12] was light
[59:14] he said behold a virgin shall conceive
[59:19] and she did
[59:22] i don't think none of us can argue with
[59:23] that
[59:24] they argued with it in that day and they
[59:26] may argue it to today but we believe her
[59:29] testimony
[59:31] we don't need a thousand people to
[59:33] crutch up our testimony
[59:36] if you have met god your life changed
[59:39] a lot of people meet religion and they
[59:41] have to vow and vow and vow and vow and
[59:44] cycle and cycle and cycle they get
[59:46] church entity or an intellectual
[59:48] conception
[59:49] but if you ever meet jesus
[59:52] if you ever having a personal experience
[59:55] there will never be no going back
[1:00:06] he said now in the bible if you turn i
[1:00:08] believe if i've i i believe if i've i've
[1:00:12] never had a message that i've i've tried
[1:00:14] to undertake to speak on that i've never
[1:00:17] first read the word because the word my
[1:00:20] word will fail
[1:00:22] i'm a man
[1:00:24] but his word
[1:00:27] can't fail
[1:00:30] he is god
[1:00:35] i believe we're all
[1:00:37] in agreeance with that
[1:00:43] if any bride is prepared we are
[1:00:47] brother ron but i'm facing so many
[1:00:49] issues
[1:00:50] he's prepared you to go through those
[1:00:52] things
[1:00:55] realize that we're standing in the
[1:00:57] darkest age that there's ever been
[1:00:59] but he's given you grace to get through
[1:01:02] this
[1:01:04] you need more than the hand of your
[1:01:06] father or your mother or your pastor you
[1:01:09] need the hand of jesus
[1:01:12] to guide you in the darkness because in
[1:01:15] the darkness
[1:01:17] there's a lot of there's a lot of
[1:01:19] imagination can go on in the darkness
[1:01:23] are you with me
[1:01:24] if you remember those little children in
[1:01:26] a cave
[1:01:28] and they were there and they cut the
[1:01:29] lights off and the little girl got all
[1:01:31] excited
[1:01:33] but their little brother said but there
[1:01:35] is a man
[1:01:38] there is a man here that can turn on the
[1:01:40] lights
[1:01:41] we're standing in the darkness of this
[1:01:43] age
[1:01:44] but the man has turned on the light
[1:01:55] i would say that god is up to the task
[1:02:00] he's absolutely up to the task to
[1:02:02] prepare us to get us ready for the
[1:02:04] rapture it'll be up to no man he didn't
[1:02:07] leave it up to a man with noah
[1:02:11] he told noah to get inside
[1:02:14] and god shut the door
[1:02:17] because noah as a man would have always
[1:02:20] been waiting on certain certain so and
[1:02:22] so
[1:02:24] but god shut the door and noah couldn't
[1:02:27] open the door
[1:02:30] moses as a man being the interpretation
[1:02:34] of god living in a human being
[1:02:37] moses as a man would have never went
[1:02:39] back down to egypt where he was
[1:02:41] humiliated as a young man
[1:02:44] but when he met that pillar of fire
[1:02:48] god put something in his hand
[1:02:52] sure we can talk about god creating the
[1:02:54] heavens and the earth and rolling the
[1:02:56] zodiac off of the fingertips or in
[1:02:59] revelations chapter 1 with him standing
[1:03:02] there with the angels in his right hand
[1:03:05] but god wants to use your hands he wants
[1:03:08] to use your feet
[1:03:11] [Applause]
[1:03:17] moses went back down before the greatest
[1:03:20] army and stood there and said
[1:03:22] who sent you here and he said i am that
[1:03:24] i am
[1:03:26] he went down as a one-man invasion
[1:03:30] amen
[1:03:31] a one-man invasion destroyed the whole
[1:03:34] army
[1:03:37] let me just recognize this setting where
[1:03:39] we're sitting at tonight
[1:03:42] that army of egypt was the strongest
[1:03:45] army in the world
[1:03:47] and god sent one man
[1:03:52] and putin can make a lot of boasts
[1:03:55] and he's got a lot of bombs and he will
[1:03:58] fulfill the word of god
[1:04:02] he will do that he will fulfill the word
[1:04:05] it's up to me and you to get ready for a
[1:04:07] rapture
[1:04:09] our job is to get ready for a rapture
[1:04:11] his job is to get ready to blow up
[1:04:14] america he'll do his job
[1:04:18] that goes out and it goes to the halls
[1:04:20] of washington
[1:04:21] i've stood in your oval office that's
[1:04:23] all i've also stood in the in the center
[1:04:26] of china's great great great places
[1:04:29] there and they're great governments none
[1:04:31] of those things impressed me
[1:04:34] i met a god that rolled the whole world
[1:04:36] off his and he has it in his hands
[1:04:48] brother aren't you concerned that
[1:04:50] somebody might get it and challenge you
[1:04:52] let me just say you had a prophet
[1:04:55] and that prophet told you that russia
[1:04:57] was going to bomb you
[1:04:59] and was going to blow america to bits
[1:05:06] because you turned the message down
[1:05:23] i want you to think about potentials
[1:05:25] that god puts inside of us
[1:05:29] maybe i'll strike your carnal side just
[1:05:31] for a moment
[1:05:40] in the kentucky derby just last week
[1:05:45] a two-year-old colt finished dead last
[1:05:48] in his last race
[1:05:50] disappointed his ain't his his owners
[1:05:54] placed him in a in a claiming race
[1:05:58] where any anybody could claim ownership
[1:06:00] of him
[1:06:02] for a fee an older man purchased the
[1:06:05] cold after missing the chance to claim
[1:06:07] another horse that he wanted
[1:06:09] he said it was his last attempt
[1:06:13] for some success in the racing industry
[1:06:19] the coat won
[1:06:21] by 17 wins
[1:06:26] his new owner was encouraged
[1:06:29] but in the races that followed he
[1:06:30] finished third twice fourth
[1:06:33] once fifth once
[1:06:36] his owner however still believed in him
[1:06:41] 2022 we come to it
[1:06:44] what's the cult's only chance to race
[1:06:47] in a major thoroughbred race
[1:06:51] which are limited
[1:06:53] to three-year-olds
[1:06:55] the day before the kentucky derby the
[1:06:57] field of horses was already full
[1:07:01] but then at the last moment a famous
[1:07:03] trainer
[1:07:04] scratched and withdrew his horse
[1:07:08] the coke took that place
[1:07:10] in the field of 20 horses just 30
[1:07:15] seconds before the deadline
[1:07:19] suddenly he was in the game and he had a
[1:07:22] chance
[1:07:24] all the metrics
[1:07:26] all the predictors were against him
[1:07:32] neither was his owner his trainer nor
[1:07:35] his jockey
[1:07:37] had ever been associated
[1:07:40] with a horse in the kentucky derby
[1:07:43] they had no experience
[1:07:46] his jockey had never won a major event
[1:07:50] they were decidedly outsiders
[1:07:53] newbies in an extremely elite arena
[1:07:59] on the morning of the race his odds of
[1:08:01] winning were 80 to 1.
[1:08:05] the second longest odds in derby history
[1:08:10] halfway around the track the colt was 16
[1:08:14] horses back from the lead
[1:08:17] he couldn't even be seen in the field of
[1:08:19] the view of the drone camera flying
[1:08:22] above the race he was a nobody
[1:08:25] he was a throwaway
[1:08:27] he was inconsequential
[1:08:30] participant at this point
[1:08:33] but then
[1:08:38] you just might as well smile
[1:08:44] but then he made his move
[1:08:47] he began to work his way through cancer
[1:08:59] he began to work his way through the
[1:09:01] trials of life
[1:09:13] i couldn't help but do that
[1:09:16] he began to work in his way through a
[1:09:17] crowded pack
[1:09:19] finding a few narrow fleeting
[1:09:21] opportunities to improve his position
[1:09:24] and as they headed toward the finish
[1:09:25] line
[1:09:26] he had miraculously moved to fifth then
[1:09:30] forth but still no one noticed him
[1:09:33] everyone's intention was firmly on the
[1:09:35] battle between the two famous front
[1:09:37] runners
[1:09:39] only seconds before the finish he
[1:09:41] suddenly almost magically passed those
[1:09:43] two front runners
[1:09:46] the announcer struggled to identify his
[1:09:48] name in time
[1:09:51] and almost in a single breath rich
[1:09:54] strike is coming up on the inside oh my
[1:09:56] goodness the longest shot has won the
[1:10:00] kentucky derby
[1:10:07] where there is life
[1:10:09] there is hope
[1:10:11] anything is possible
[1:10:14] don't let nobody count you out
[1:10:18] persistent and determination will beat
[1:10:20] all odds
[1:10:23] you may not be in the best starting
[1:10:25] position
[1:10:26] you may not be the biggest and the best
[1:10:28] horse
[1:10:31] you maybe only made it in the last 30
[1:10:34] seconds
[1:10:35] you might have only been bought for 30
[1:10:38] 000 while all the others were multiple
[1:10:40] millions of dollar horses
[1:10:43] they may have never counted you in
[1:10:57] it ain't about to have out about having
[1:10:59] the best of everything or being the
[1:11:00] biggest or the favored
[1:11:02] it's about the size of the heart
[1:11:10] i thought you'd enjoy that
[1:11:15] we're against all odds
[1:11:18] but we're in his hands
[1:11:21] our challenge is to finish
[1:11:25] many quit many turn aside
[1:11:28] many have excuses
[1:11:30] many are not dedicated
[1:11:33] many are not committed
[1:11:36] but the scripture tells us to lay aside
[1:11:39] every weight
[1:11:41] and the sin that does so easily beset us
[1:11:45] this is believers this ain't drunks
[1:11:48] prostitutes and dope addicts
[1:11:50] this is people sitting in pews with pies
[1:11:53] and dresses on
[1:11:54] you got to lay aside every weight
[1:11:57] every excuse
[1:12:05] stay the course
[1:12:09] regardless of your challenges
[1:12:25] a man named glenn cunningham
[1:12:28] forgive me i'm just going to take some
[1:12:29] examples here
[1:12:31] was a young boy
[1:12:34] burned in a in a fire
[1:12:36] by a stove
[1:12:40] they literally decided the doctors
[1:12:42] decided we'll cut his legs off and he
[1:12:44] begged them
[1:12:45] don't cut my legs off
[1:12:48] he was burned so bad until his legs were
[1:12:50] not recognizable it was just meat
[1:12:54] sat in a wheelchair laid in the bed
[1:12:57] and he would inch his way out to the
[1:12:59] fence
[1:13:01] watch other children going backwards and
[1:13:03] forwards
[1:13:05] one day he had to strengthen the
[1:13:07] determination to grab a hold of the
[1:13:08] fence
[1:13:10] and pull himself up and stand
[1:13:14] this was a miracle
[1:13:17] this was a phenomenal germany from his
[1:13:20] seat to standing position
[1:13:25] day by day he began to teach himself to
[1:13:28] step one stepping aside moving backwards
[1:13:31] and forwards
[1:13:33] it wasn't long though he was walking
[1:13:36] it was set in his goal
[1:13:38] i want to be the fastest man in the
[1:13:41] world
[1:13:44] nobody would have gave him a chance
[1:13:48] if you're gonna look at the present
[1:13:49] circumstances you would have never gave
[1:13:52] him a chance that's a dream
[1:13:57] wake up
[1:13:58] but he had a vision
[1:14:01] i'm not just going to walk i'm not just
[1:14:04] going to be productive in my life
[1:14:06] but i'm going to be the fastest man in
[1:14:09] the world
[1:14:13] and glenn cunningham
[1:14:16] went into the olympics
[1:14:19] as a young man
[1:14:21] and competed
[1:14:22] and was the first man to get near a
[1:14:25] four-minute mile
[1:14:27] and begin classed
[1:14:29] as the fastest man
[1:14:31] in the world
[1:14:34] you never know where somebody's been at
[1:14:36] in their life
[1:14:37] until you've walked in their moccasins a
[1:14:40] little while
[1:14:44] beethoven is known to be one of the
[1:14:46] greatest composer and writers that are
[1:14:48] ever lived
[1:14:50] but beethoven became deaf
[1:14:53] and he saw the legs off of his piano and
[1:14:56] on a hardwood floor played and listened
[1:14:59] to the vibration of the music and
[1:15:01] composed
[1:15:03] he did not let deafness
[1:15:08] it may have drove him into isolation and
[1:15:11] he may never hear his music ever again
[1:15:13] in his life but there was a gift that
[1:15:16] was on the inside of him that he refused
[1:15:19] to quit and shut up
[1:15:21] somebody ought to be shouting right now
[1:15:24] [Applause]
[1:15:32] stephen hawkins
[1:15:35] is known to be one of the brightest men
[1:15:37] that ever lived
[1:15:41] stephen hawkins sit in a chair
[1:15:44] and it's computerized in every way
[1:15:48] he went into dno dna codes he went into
[1:15:51] outer space he actually discovered that
[1:15:53] there was a god
[1:15:55] much to the chagrin of the scientific
[1:15:58] community he discovered that god created
[1:16:01] the heavens and the earth amen
[1:16:04] just for a good note
[1:16:09] other great scientists
[1:16:11] if they were honest would say the same
[1:16:13] thing
[1:16:19] einstein
[1:16:20] was the name i was looking for
[1:16:22] he actually believed that god created
[1:16:24] the heavens and the earth
[1:16:28] but stephen hawkins didn't let his
[1:16:29] debilitating condition
[1:16:32] close him down
[1:16:36] he used the gift that was inside of him
[1:16:38] to try to better the world
[1:16:43] fanny crosby was blind
[1:16:46] yet there was a gift on the inside of
[1:16:48] her
[1:16:49] it was a gift to write music
[1:16:52] and she would be one of the greatest
[1:16:54] greatest
[1:16:56] gospel music writers
[1:16:59] in the history of time
[1:17:02] and here's where i start to preach
[1:17:05] and they made fun of her and they mocked
[1:17:08] her
[1:17:10] how will you know him fanny crosby she
[1:17:13] said i will know him by the nail prints
[1:17:17] in his hands
[1:17:28] she said i may have never seen the sun
[1:17:30] shine on this side of my life but i will
[1:17:32] appreciate it when i get there
[1:17:37] job had many trials cruel in many ways
[1:17:44] when god came to talk to him he did not
[1:17:46] talk to him about the trial that he was
[1:17:49] in
[1:17:50] god asked him where was you job
[1:17:57] when i spoke the word and i took my
[1:18:00] hands and i said let there be
[1:18:03] he could have talked to him about
[1:18:05] building mountains and building the
[1:18:07] caves and building the oceans and
[1:18:10] building all that he built
[1:18:14] he's going to talk to him about building
[1:18:16] all of the mountains that we would enjoy
[1:18:19] the deserts and building every situation
[1:18:22] of life
[1:18:26] he didn't come to give him a pity party
[1:18:30] he reminded him job you in my hands
[1:18:36] so no matter what trial that you have
[1:18:38] none of us has ever been in job's
[1:18:41] situation
[1:18:45] i've been called job i hope i'm not
[1:18:50] fallen off of a house 40 feet
[1:18:52] they said i would never walk again
[1:18:55] burned
[1:18:58] burned and laid to where that they were
[1:19:00] going to harvest my organs a month later
[1:19:04] and five hours from the harvest and of
[1:19:06] the organs i woke up
[1:19:10] a doctor would say to me
[1:19:12] god must have a great purpose for you
[1:19:14] and your life
[1:19:17] i would lay in the hospital with a
[1:19:19] stroke eight days
[1:19:20] and on the eighth night
[1:19:23] there was a nurse came in and she had a
[1:19:26] little light and she came in and she
[1:19:27] came around the bed and she said mr
[1:19:29] spencer have you been praying and i said
[1:19:32] yes ma'am
[1:19:33] she said i've not been your attending
[1:19:35] nurse but i've heard about you
[1:19:38] and she said when i walked through the
[1:19:39] door i felt a presence that i've never
[1:19:41] felt before in my life
[1:19:44] said were you praying i said i was
[1:19:46] praying
[1:19:47] i said do you know him she said i don't
[1:19:50] know him
[1:19:51] and in a few moments i led that lady to
[1:19:53] the lord jesus christ
[1:19:55] and all stroke conditions left and i
[1:19:57] went home the next day
[1:20:00] you see we're instruments in the hands
[1:20:02] of god
[1:20:07] we may be battled with the road to hell
[1:20:10] is paved with good intentions
[1:20:12] we may be battle with complacency and
[1:20:15] getting common in life we made battle
[1:20:18] with neglecting to do the right thing
[1:20:20] we may battle with procrastination i'll
[1:20:23] do it another day
[1:20:31] we're humans we put things off
[1:20:37] our hands are different than any other
[1:20:40] instrument of our body
[1:20:43] our hands has
[1:20:44] thousands of things that it can do
[1:20:47] it can feel a hot heat it can feel cold
[1:20:51] it can be tender to a wife or tender to
[1:20:54] a child
[1:20:57] it can pick up strong objects and put it
[1:21:00] above our heads
[1:21:02] it can do incredible
[1:21:03] crafts
[1:21:05] in the hands of our hands it's been said
[1:21:09] that if a basketball in my hands has a
[1:21:11] little value
[1:21:12] but a basketball in the hands of michael
[1:21:14] jordan
[1:21:18] a golf club in my hands has absolutely
[1:21:21] no value
[1:21:24] as brother ted would say baloney
[1:21:29] but in the hands of tiger woods
[1:21:33] he makes more money
[1:21:35] with advertisements than he ever did on
[1:21:37] a tour
[1:21:40] an artist brush in my hands
[1:21:43] will draw stick figures
[1:21:47] be of little value
[1:21:49] but at the hands of da vinci
[1:21:57] a baseball bat in my hands
[1:22:00] will get you foul balls
[1:22:04] but in the hands of shaytani just to
[1:22:06] give you an idea i do keep up
[1:22:09] he just hit a hundredth home run last
[1:22:11] night
[1:22:12] i just checked just for good measure
[1:22:20] in his hands it's worth hundreds of
[1:22:22] millions of dollars
[1:22:24] a guitar a drum a piano
[1:22:27] all instruments in the hands of in the
[1:22:29] book of psalms
[1:22:33] but in many churches they're not welcome
[1:22:38] [Music]
[1:22:40] this is a church to where that we
[1:22:43] worship the lord
[1:22:48] this is a church where we lift up our
[1:22:50] voices and worship god don't let it
[1:22:52] scare you
[1:22:56] don't let it scare you
[1:22:58] people go to ball games and scream and
[1:23:00] holler
[1:23:01] [Applause]
[1:23:03] and there's no value to that to not
[1:23:05] tomorrow morning
[1:23:10] they go to race car races and sit in the
[1:23:13] hot blistering sun
[1:23:16] never complaining of hate
[1:23:26] buy shirts and t-shirts nobody's paying
[1:23:29] you to do that you're paying to do that
[1:23:34] hundreds of dollars for tickets
[1:23:38] screaming
[1:23:39] that guy that's driving will never hear
[1:23:41] your voice but yet you scream
[1:23:47] we come to church and the enemy tells us
[1:23:49] it's too hot it's too cold somebody said
[1:23:51] it in my seat
[1:24:04] just for good measure the green bay
[1:24:06] packers is sold out for as long as it is
[1:24:08] going to be there
[1:24:11] and just for your information green bay
[1:24:13] is one of the coldest outside fields
[1:24:16] that there is nobody's complaining
[1:24:22] you there
[1:24:24] welcome here
[1:24:29] don't you bring that code here
[1:24:48] i've never had a day
[1:24:51] to where i decided to
[1:24:53] pull my shirt off and stand in sub-zero
[1:24:55] weather
[1:24:59] and paint myself green
[1:25:07] and put a cheese head on the top of me
[1:25:11] [Applause]
[1:25:13] and yet you will let the devil whisper
[1:25:15] in your ear when you walk into church
[1:25:29] when god saved you and he healed you and
[1:25:32] he raised you up and you're still
[1:25:34] standing today in the most wicked age
[1:25:37] that there's ever been
[1:25:39] when nobody gave you a chance
[1:25:42] you're in god's hands
[1:25:45] hallelujah
[1:25:47] [Applause]
[1:26:01] the other day i was told by doctors
[1:26:09] seems like every day i'll get a request
[1:26:11] how are you doing
[1:26:14] the other day i was told by doctors you
[1:26:16] have still as much cancer as you've ever
[1:26:18] had
[1:26:21] you're still on the same amount of chemo
[1:26:23] but we're real happy with what however
[1:26:25] you're doing
[1:26:26] you're one of a kind
[1:26:29] we didn't go home and cry and go to bed
[1:26:33] put a pillar over top of our head and
[1:26:35] say well we haven't diminished a cell of
[1:26:37] this cancer
[1:26:39] not a cell that's been gone or destroyed
[1:26:43] we've had prayers from around the world
[1:26:45] cards from around the world
[1:26:48] gifts from around the world
[1:26:50] but in god's hands
[1:26:53] i'm going to preach to you
[1:26:56] in god's hands i've dedicated and
[1:26:58] committed the rest of my life
[1:27:01] to destroying the works of the devil as
[1:27:04] long as he gives me strength and health
[1:27:08] i will stand here and stand around the
[1:27:11] world and preach the gospel
[1:27:15] of jesus christ
[1:27:32] don't bring me your excuses

[1:27:58] get up off your couch
[1:28:01] and go do something good for humanity
[1:28:35] hallelujah
[1:28:51] the scripture says that i can do all
[1:28:53] things
[1:28:59] through christ which strengthens me
[1:29:04] let me just say this you nothing great

[1:38:22] trying to take care of all the nerves
[1:38:24] that i've got going on
[1:38:26] now what happens in this church

[1:38:55] joseph was re actually
[1:38:58] living
[1:39:00] the life of jesus
[1:39:03] moses was actually living the life of
[1:39:06] jesus
[1:39:08] he nowhere ever stepped out over the red
[1:39:11] sea and said
[1:39:12] i'm portraying jesus christ
[1:39:15] he's going to come like a prophet unto
[1:39:17] me
[1:39:19] nope he didn't say it
[1:39:21] as a matter of fact he said
[1:39:23] god you can let us die
[1:39:26] god can help us here
[1:39:28] and god simply said why are you crying
[1:39:31] out to me
[1:39:32] stretch that which is in your hand
[1:39:37] paraphrase it now stretch that which was
[1:39:40] in your hand out over the sea
[1:39:43] god didn't send a lightning bolt he
[1:39:46] asked him to use what he had in his hand
[1:39:48] that's what god's asking us to do today
[1:39:51] he's gave you the best word he's gave
[1:39:53] you the best message
[1:39:56] he has equipped you with the best tools
[1:39:58] that he can give you
[1:40:00] [Applause]
[1:40:07] for reference
[1:40:08] noah preached 120 years
[1:40:11] and he won eight souls
[1:40:14] by most people's standard eight people
[1:40:17] in their church
[1:40:19] is not a big church
[1:40:24] but if you look at the previous church
[1:40:27] it was eight times bigger
[1:40:30] than enoch walking off
[1:40:33] so eight was quite sizable
[1:40:39] noah never had no training on ship
[1:40:41] building he was a farmer
[1:40:46] he did not have the best wood to work
[1:40:48] with
[1:40:49] but that was what god chose for him
[1:40:56] no architects was set up
[1:41:00] to art to set us up as an adventure for
[1:41:03] him to build
[1:41:05] no doubt people thought at the end of
[1:41:07] the journey well noah's building that's
[1:41:10] a zoo
[1:41:12] noah
[1:41:13] had
[1:41:15] maybe if god told him said now noah
[1:41:18] i'm going to give send in and i'm going
[1:41:20] to get you together two by two all the
[1:41:23] animals of the earth can you imagine
[1:41:25] what a job that would have been
[1:41:29] if you think god can't take care of you
[1:41:31] he can gather animals from all over the
[1:41:33] earth 2x2
[1:41:44] i got a note the other day
[1:41:46] it says you think you're having a bad
[1:41:48] day
[1:41:49] you're the third champ chimpanzee on the
[1:41:52] way to the ark
[1:41:54] and baby it's starting to rain
[1:42:11] it's good aunt cake thank you
[1:42:18] how do i feed them
[1:42:21] how do we eat
[1:42:23] god's gonna flood the whole earth
[1:42:27] never seen any kind of destruction like
[1:42:29] this
[1:42:30] all i was told he didn't tell his
[1:42:32] children he didn't tell his wife
[1:42:34] god told him and he explained it to him
[1:42:37] and he preached from that text for 120
[1:42:39] years
[1:42:41] people get really bored with sermons
[1:42:43] i've heard that before i've heard that
[1:42:44] before but can you imagine being in
[1:42:46] noah's
[1:42:48] pastorship
[1:42:50] and no matter where he started out he
[1:42:52] ended up it's gonna rain
[1:42:57] and you borderline believers you're
[1:42:59] going to you're going to die
[1:43:02] and as a matter of fact if you're not on
[1:43:04] the ark you're going to hell
[1:43:12] i imagine that made some social circle
[1:43:15] upsets
[1:43:18] if you ain't in our church
[1:43:21] you're going to hell
[1:43:24] but it wasn't his words it was god's
[1:43:26] words
[1:43:28] don't argue with me i'm just a preacher
[1:43:30] this morning i had three eggs two pieces
[1:43:34] of bacon and a piece of ham it was good
[1:43:40] my job to preach to you
[1:43:43] three hebrew children
[1:43:46] refused to bend and bow
[1:43:49] they were in god's hands
[1:43:51] i won't be much longer but stay with me
[1:43:54] shamgar
[1:43:56] had 600 men that repetitively came and
[1:44:00] stole all of his crops but left him just
[1:44:02] a little bit but something happened to
[1:44:04] him today
[1:44:06] and there was about an eight-foot stick
[1:44:09] with a stone on one end and a spear on
[1:44:12] another he was a farmer but something
[1:44:14] struck him
[1:44:16] i don't need ten thousand at my side all
[1:44:19] i need is god
[1:44:30] let me just say this you you don't have
[1:44:32] to eat the whole elephant just one bite
[1:44:34] at a time
[1:44:36] you don't have to kill 600 at one time
[1:44:39] just one at a time but when you're done
[1:44:42] 600 men will be dead
[1:44:51] a little boy
[1:44:52] was holding a blind man
[1:44:56] and the blind man had been a mighty man
[1:45:00] but today they were going to make a
[1:45:02] sport out of him
[1:45:05] and that little boy
[1:45:08] was holding
[1:45:09] this man's hands
[1:45:11] and he heard a lot about from mom and
[1:45:13] daddy who his man was
[1:45:15] no doubt he had been one of the little
[1:45:17] boys that had watched other children
[1:45:19] spit on him while he was working in the
[1:45:21] mill in the town center
[1:45:24] because they made fun of him
[1:45:28] this man had carried gates
[1:45:30] on his shoulder
[1:45:32] this man had killed
[1:45:34] a lot of people
[1:45:36] this man had took a jawbone of an ass
[1:45:39] and destroyed a thousand men
[1:45:41] and today this blind man his his hair
[1:45:44] had grown back out he looked horrible
[1:45:46] but his hair had grown back out but
[1:45:48] somewhere in the silence of that
[1:45:50] grinding of that meal
[1:45:52] i wish i could preach to you right now
[1:45:55] somewhere in the grinding of your meal
[1:45:57] while you're going in circles and
[1:45:59] circles around the revolution of that
[1:46:01] meal that satan thinks he's got you
[1:46:04] bound to why don't you have a prayer
[1:46:05] meeting
[1:46:07] why don't you have a prayer meeting
[1:46:09] that'll shake the shingles off of the
[1:46:10] roof why don't you decide i'm done with
[1:46:13] this devil i'm going to give god the
[1:46:16] rest of the days of my life
[1:46:18] and i'm going to do it with all my heart
[1:46:21] i'm done with excuses i'm done i'm done
[1:46:25] i'm done with my weakness god if you
[1:46:28] give me the strength i'm gonna push and
[1:46:31] i'm gonna push
[1:46:33] [Applause]
[1:46:48] and he put his hands he said if you
[1:46:49] would just
[1:46:50] show me the pillars that this building
[1:46:53] stands on
[1:46:56] if you could just put me there
[1:47:05] i don't know
[1:47:07] i don't know i don't know what happened
[1:47:08] that little boy
[1:47:10] but somewhere god's got a place for that
[1:47:12] little boy
[1:47:15] maybe you can tell me later
[1:47:17] what happened that little boy but
[1:47:19] i don't know
[1:47:20] i don't know i read the bible a whole
[1:47:23] lot and i've always wondered about that
[1:47:24] little boy
[1:47:25] but if you were ever in god's mind you
[1:47:27] will always be in god's mind
[1:47:33] if you were ever in god's mind you will
[1:47:36] always be in god's mind
[1:47:42] he put his hands
[1:47:43] on the pillars
[1:47:48] and he had a prayer meeting
[1:47:52] and he could hear him making fun of him
[1:47:55] and against all odds
[1:47:57] he knew he was in god's hands
[1:48:02] he knew today is my last day on earth
[1:48:05] so if today's my last day on earth oh i
[1:48:07] feel like preaching
[1:48:09] if today is my last day on earth let me
[1:48:11] kill more today than i've ever killed in
[1:48:14] my whole life
[1:48:16] and he began to push
[1:48:20] and a
[1:48:21] well-constructed building
[1:48:23] disintegrated
[1:48:25] oh yeah
[1:48:26] in god's hands
[1:48:37] can you give me can you give me two more
[1:48:38] minutes
[1:48:49] i've been giving this a lot of thought
[1:48:52] a lot of thought
[1:49:03] we're going to have a baptism we're
[1:49:04] going to have communion here
[1:49:07] but i don't know how much longer we're
[1:49:08] going to do this i'm going to be honest
[1:49:10] with you
[1:49:13] we've been sent a message and god's not
[1:49:15] sending another
[1:49:20] to come out of her my people and get out
[1:49:21] of those denominal systems
[1:49:25] god's opened up the word to us
[1:49:28] we don't have to probe and figure
[1:49:33] and it's not that
[1:49:35] we're
[1:49:36] living anything that's religious it's
[1:49:38] just god living inside of us
[1:49:41] and just changed our lives so when we
[1:49:43] met him
[1:49:45] we did different
[1:49:47] but it's different
[1:49:49] whitney's not in i've been waiting but
[1:49:50] whitney's not in just now and
[1:49:53] whitney got into prayerline the other
[1:49:55] day at the tent meeting
[1:49:57] andrew mentioned to some of it whitney
[1:50:00] has suffered
[1:50:01] for much of her life with an eating
[1:50:03] disorder to where she couldn't eat
[1:50:04] certain things
[1:50:06] and they put her on a lot of different
[1:50:08] diets and she'd get sick and she'd get
[1:50:10] sick and she'd get sick and she would
[1:50:11] get sick
[1:50:12] and
[1:50:14] and
[1:50:15] we tried everything in the world
[1:50:18] she can tell you but we tried every we
[1:50:20] took her all kind of doctors because hey
[1:50:22] she's my baby girl man i do anything for
[1:50:24] her
[1:50:27] davey just happened to walk on water so
[1:50:30] i had to give her
[1:50:35] and so so anyway
[1:50:38] you know it was a miracle that she had
[1:50:40] the two babies because even the doctor
[1:50:41] last week said it was impossible for you
[1:50:44] to have children i can't figure how in
[1:50:46] the world you had children i can tell
[1:50:47] you it was in god's hands
[1:50:50] isaac we saw isaac three years just like
[1:50:53] your wedding we i saw that two years
[1:50:55] before i saw isaac walking through the
[1:50:58] yard with his little finger up
[1:51:01] and i know this may not be socially
[1:51:03] cleric today but he had a disney shirt
[1:51:06] on i saw that too
[1:51:10] but you know i saw that three years
[1:51:12] before
[1:51:14] and then the impossible happens
[1:51:17] and whitney has a baby and then she has
[1:51:20] another baby named zoe
[1:51:23] and so she was going to bring zoe
[1:51:25] through the prayer line
[1:51:27] and her own condition for her stomach
[1:51:30] and
[1:51:31] she knew that that i wouldn't last long
[1:51:34] in the prayer line because the prayer
[1:51:35] line was the longest prayer line we've
[1:51:36] ever seen
[1:51:39] incredible miracles that came out of
[1:51:41] that prayer line
[1:51:42] because it's in his hands
[1:51:44] this revival is in his hands this is not
[1:51:48] a man doing anything this is not me
[1:51:51] it's not any favorite preacher it's god
[1:51:54] doing these things
[1:51:57] and and whitney
[1:51:58] she actually i asked her to write the
[1:52:00] testimony down and whitney whitney said
[1:52:02] that she watched and she knowed that
[1:52:05] they would pull me at any time and the
[1:52:07] boys would pull me and they would take
[1:52:09] me home
[1:52:10] and it would be that whitney was at the
[1:52:13] edge of the tent holding zoey
[1:52:18] as i was going out and my eye caught her
[1:52:23] and i grabbed zoe
[1:52:25] and i picked her up and i began to pray
[1:52:27] for her and as i began to pray for her i
[1:52:30] begin to speak in tongues
[1:52:33] those that are very close to us zoe
[1:52:35] hasn't been saying any words formulated
[1:52:38] and i begin to pray looser tongue looser
[1:52:41] tongue
[1:52:43] she's she's starting to she's starting
[1:52:45] to talk after a while people be telling
[1:52:48] her
[1:52:53] on the way home last night she said i'm
[1:52:55] mad
[1:52:56] i'm mad
[1:53:00] tammy she probably got that from you
[1:53:01] that's probably your side look at you
[1:53:03] sideways
[1:53:06] [Applause]
[1:53:16] y'all take me out here real quick
[1:53:27] when i turned around i grabbed whitney
[1:53:28] and held her
[1:53:30] and i began to pray for her
[1:53:33] i never thought anything of her
[1:53:35] condition
[1:53:37] not a thing of her condition
[1:53:40] and i prayed to her and i said baby doll
[1:53:43] you don't have to go through that prayer
[1:53:44] line you're well
[1:53:49] you're well you don't have to go through
[1:53:50] that prayer line you don't have to stand
[1:53:51] the weight you're well
[1:53:54] and she went home and she's ate
[1:53:56] everything that she wanted to eat
[1:53:58] without a stomachache
[1:54:13] national force put israel in her place
[1:54:16] the holy ghost has put us in our place
[1:54:19] there's not a bomb can drop until god
[1:54:21] allows it to drop
[1:54:23] angels are standing ready to collect us
[1:54:25] to take us home
[1:54:29] come on church
[1:54:31] it feels like every service is a
[1:54:33] convention here it feels like we're
[1:54:35] getting closer and closer and closer i
[1:54:38] want you to realize
[1:54:40] i had a visitation the other night and
[1:54:42] he said these three words to me
[1:54:48] hallelujah you're in my hands
[1:54:54] you're in my hands

[1:55:27] maybe you're a leopard
[1:55:29] full of sin today
[1:55:31] he's not ashamed of you
[1:55:33] he'll wrap his loving arms around you
[1:55:36] and you'll feel his hands as he wraps
[1:55:38] his arms around you
[1:55:40] he's not scared
[1:55:42] because you're in his hands
[1:55:44] and i finished
[1:55:46] when you were flipping
[1:55:50] you were in his hands
[1:55:57] because he's got plans
[1:56:01] and i want to say this to you
[1:56:03] if you're in his hands
[1:56:07] god has great big plans
[1:56:10] for you
[1:56:18] that was good wasn't it janetta

[1:57:40] lord come touch us today
[1:57:44] forgive us of our sins
[1:57:48] maybe we just need to repent
[1:57:50] of a little error in our life

[1:58:11] miracle in my life but many are not
[1:58:14] fighting cancer
[1:58:18] but it's a miracle to live
[1:58:22] maybe may our children appreciate their
[1:58:24] youth
[1:58:28] don't let a day go by neglect to serve
[1:58:30] god
[1:58:37] through me
