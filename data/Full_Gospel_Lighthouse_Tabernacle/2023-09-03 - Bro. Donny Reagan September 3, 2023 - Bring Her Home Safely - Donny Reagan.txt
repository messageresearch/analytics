of some complications that she was having but we're believing God for his Miracle working power amen we we just want to thank you for that Song of Solomon Chapter 3: 6 I realized brother Timothy and brother Tim didn't leave me a whole lot to say so I was thinking about preaching out the maps in my Bible because they covered everything from Genesis to Revelation but wasn't it awesome amen so wonderful so appreciate our brothers and their Ministry and their gift to the Lord and to God's people Song of Solomon chapter 3 verse six who is this that cometh out of the Wilderness like pillars of smoke perfumed with myrr and frankincense with all powders of the merchant behold his bed which is Solomon's three score Valiant men or about it of the Valiant of Israel they all hold swords now remember they all hold swords being expert being expert in war Hallelujah they all hold swords being an expert in war every man hath his sword upon his thigh notice where it's located upon his thigh and this is the reason because of fear in the night King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon how may like to be remembered today as we pray God bless you me too Heavenly Father we are so grateful for this time that we can be together Lord God we realize that the world about us is dying darkness is moving in on the earth and we know the last plague is spiritual death and while death is striking everywhere around us we're so grateful that we're in the Ark of Safety and life is preserving us we've gathered here these few days and today is the last one and it's passed so quickly so much preparation so much prayer so much effort been put forth for these meetings we just pray Lord that there would be life changing things that have happened to these people for those who do not come here this is not their home church that they'll be able to take something back to their Church their assembly their family something Lord that can benefit them as well for we know we don't just come to special meetings this way that we can be able to receive for ourself but something that we can be be able to be changed and take something back home with us I pray you'd help me today Father to get out of the way Lord I need you dear God help me I pray anoint me but father what good but that do if you don't anoint them as well so speak through me hear through them and live through us all to the glory of God In The Name Of The Lord Jesus and the Saints said am you may be seated I'd like to speak to you this morning for just a little bit on bring her safely home for those of you you that are aware of the Song of Solomon you know that it's one of the mysterious books of the Bible Jews will not even allow their children to read The Song of Solomon until they're adults The Song of Solomon in the hidic Jewish culture it's called the holy of holies because it contains so much in there to a lot of people they don't even think it's inspired of course a lot of theologians have debated through the years that it was not really um meant to be in the Bible but yet we know that it contains much about us in there and it's a very beautiful story because it portrays the story of redemption which we love and we're part of that it opens up of course with Song of Solomon chapter one verse one and it gives us conveys to us a story of this great king Solomon and he was out and about his kingdom going about to look in different parts of Israel and see what God had had given them and he comes upon this certain Vineyard and he finds this beautiful young woman there now remember Solomon had all types of wives and it was a customary in that day of course but he run across one that was just more special than all the rest we don't even know her name but we she is identified by coming from the area of shunum so she's called a shulamite Solomon the word Solomon means peace and shulamite is the feminis form of Peace So he was Mr peace she was mpace Hallelujah Solomon is so Smitten by his love for her that he wants to make her his own and she feels so inadequate she says I am black and I am not beautiful and my my mothers my son my mother's sons rather they they looked upon me and they beat me and she goes to describing all of her faults and all the things about her making excuses for why she could not be worthy to be joined up to this man and remember this is a man that God has attributed such wisdom that there was not a man like him in the Old Testament that God had give him not only discernment but also of great wisdom you can imagine her now coming from a poor country um she there's no mention of her father so apparently her father was dead but her brothers were her Guardians so to be married in that day you'd have to go through the male figures in order to get her and she was overwhelmed first of all that Solomon would even want her why would he take any interest in her at all uh it was a great cultural thing for them in that day for the women not to be out in the sun very much because that Middle Eastern sun was so hot so it would tan them and um the finer women the upper cultured women were the ones that were fairer skinned because it was a sign of wealth in other words you would have somebody to sweep your porch you didn't do it you had somebody to pick your beans and your maters and your ters you didn't do it you stayed in the house and you stayed cool but this woman was unlike the rest of those fair skinned delicate type of women so she had the identity of wear and tear no doubt her hands must have had some cracks and crevices and even a few calluses and she would have been dark relatively compared to some of the other women and she could not see in herself as brother Tim brought it so beautifully to us last night wasn't that awesome she could not see in herself what Solomon saw in her now this man was a man who had all types of women come to his court he he was very great close acquaintances was the king of hyi the king of Lebanon and the king of the surrounding countries he made friendships with them because he needed Cedar he needed silver he needed gold he needed purple he needs loss of those things so he was a man of great Commerce so he contacted all of those and no doubt they wanted their daughters to be able to marry him because who wouldn't want to be married to King Solomon and this woman whenever she was spotted by him and Solomon I want you to notice the way that it mentions this about Solomon and it sticks out in verse 7 notice verse 7 behold his bed which is Solomon's three score Valiant men are about it of the Ian of Israel now the word bed there actually the Hebrew word is mat metah so it was a couch or a bed or a buyer b i e r this is what the Lord Jesus touched the young man that had died and he was laying on this so the word matah is a bed or a a litter actually it's called as well and it comes from the root word which means to stretch out so it was it would have been something like the Indians would use and my visits to India I've actually seen them still using there that there so it was a lowered type of covered couch and according to your wealth you you could identify the wealth of the person by looking at their mat so they would have only room for one person in this mat so the identification of Solomon is identified by what he is writing on now remember my ter sermon title is BR her home safely so Solomon now he has he's been able to achieve a lot of great things he's built the house of God he built his own house and he was able to build things that like had never been seen before in the Kingdom of Israel so now he points toward establishing his kingdom and being able to be identified as what he was the son of David So in doing that he must not only build the house of God but he must be able to make a hype for the bride now this woman is absolutely a type of the Bride I'm sure you believe that so Solomon takes his own personal couch now he's out on this buyer this matah and whenever he's out going through in Galilee if you've never been there we was privileged several years ago with be with brother Tim and sister Karen there on a trip that we made and lots of Israel has no trees Barren Rocky nothing but sand and dust but when you move into Galilee which shunum was part of that District of Galilee when you move there you find the beautiful sea of ganes or the the Sea of Galilee and you see around it and beautiful trees and grass and just an awesome place just absolutely beautiful and shunum is not so far from that up in the northern part of Israel and this girl probably raised poor and probably thought she'd never even have a man that would love her or care for her but little did she know her Destiny was to be intertwined with the King of Kings so the idea is that God had this man now this is in his tight making era what he was would been riding on the Indians called it a Peloquin now Solomon then had made all these things for himself so Solomon made his own mat Solomon made his own Chariot Solomon made the Stables Solomon made and had all of these great things but now he's found a wife which is not to be identified with the rest of the women of the harim this is what it was called so he had all kinds of women or churches that were identified around him but this one took his heart you see when you read in the song of Solomon and you can hear about a relationship it's it's quite beautiful if you haven't read it in a while and it's quite beautiful in how that they are displaying their love each to the other and they use terms that are quite typical for that time frame but it also identifies her identity on the earth so she talks about what he is and she Compares him to certain fragrances and certain things that she was aware of and he finds where she is and he talks to her in the way that she can understand it let me give you an example so he talked about her and he said that her hair was like goat's hair now Brothers just in case you're wondering that's not something you'd want to speak to a young girl today if you're wanting a girlfriend don't tell her she's got goats hair cuz that'll be the first and last time you'll speak to her no doubt so what you have to do have to find the language that she speaks and be able to know what to say but you see for them whenever he looked and he saw her hair it was a great thing especially the ver the black goats because they were the ones of the highest order and the highest breeding and their hair was such exotic fine fine hair so and she would identify back with him and she would talk of how he smell and then he would take the identification of her and he would describe her back and forth and people would read and think what in the world are they even talking about and he would describe her breast and he would describe her body and he would describe her nature and her makeup then she in turn would come around and she would describe him and the other people were just sitting there reading and say I don't know what they're even saying to you I mean what are they even talking about and when you read that you realized that they had broke into one another's love language you see this is a problem a lot of our marriages even around the message that a lot of men they convey their language to their wife which is not necessarily the language their wife speaks and sometimes the wife will convey her language to the husband and the husband don't understand nothing she's talking about and they don't spend enough time studying and understanding each other's language so they can be able to convey to each other but this is one thing that makes the Lord Jesus such an outstanding husband he had to come down to the Earth to be able to take on himself Humanity he had to come down to become one of us and be able to take on our language now granted whenever he was here he would talk in Heavenly language sometimes and he would talk in Earthly language and St John 11 he did that whenever he said that Lazarus was asleep talking in Heavenly language and then finally the disciples couldn't understand him so he said Lazarus is dead so he'd have to Swit switch over from Heavenly language to their language and then they could understand it but you see our Lord come to the Earth so that he might be able to speak to us in such a way that would bring us to the paths of redemption this is why the message of the hour it's not for everybody well come on somebody say Amen we realize that our message is not for everybody and we've come to realize in the last few years it's not even been for everybody that's been around it there's been a lot of folks that have left in the last few years because they realize this message was not for them well I feel sorry for him but I'm just glad I know it's for me aren't you glad it's for me amen I love it today more than I've ever loved it in my life amen and I say praise be to God for it because this this is my year 1983 we come to the message so we're in 2023 so 40 years I've been in this message and I love it now more than ever before amen and it's not just because brother brandham was from Kentucky either now I was born and raised about 35 miles from where he was born uh born and raised about 30 mi from where the fish was resurrected about 60 mies from where the squirrels were created a lot of those things happened in Kentucky so God must like Kentucky but I never even knew anything about William brandham never heard nothing about it until I'd already been preaching years in Pentecost and yet I realized there was a season and a time but yet some people this message is so rich it makes them sick to their stomach that's why a lot of them are vomiting it up that's why they're following to believe the sign and they don't believe the sign nor the word that's right but aren't you glad even though Mama turns away daddy turns away this one turns away you ain't going nowhere because you have found where you fit in the word of the hour I want you to notice in verse seven here that the Bible says behold his bed which is Solomon's notice the identification that's placed upon this means of Transport his bed which is Solomon's three score Valiant men are about it so now here we're in the stage to where that it's moved Beyond the espousal which is what would take place so when the espousal would take in take place in the Hebrew marriage the girl could not run away with the boy they didn't have anything like that it just didn't work it had to come through the mother and father because they looked as the marriage as being a contract not only between a man and a woman but between two families so they would come together they would drink a cup of wine and they would make this marriage contract now the the groom himself never actually dealt with the bride but it was either a lawyer or the friend of the Bride John the Baptist identified himself in that when he said the bridegroom he he rejoices he says the friend of the bridegroom rejoices when he hears the bridegroom's voice what did John mean John had been the friend of the bridegroom he foran the bridegroom to tell the bride your husband's coming your husband's coming so when John heard the groom the Lord Jesus speaking directly to the bride John said I've completed my race and I'm done why because John had been able to betro those elect in that day so now here this would have happened to this in this little shulamite woman and what they would do when a boy baby is born in the Jewish Family they plant a tree when a girl baby is born they plant a different kind of tree that tree will grow and grow and whenever they get ready to get married they will cut down his tree and her tree they will then cut those trees in half they will make four poles and they will put it under a canvas called a hoopah anybody ever heard that word before hoopah so under the hoopah after the engagement they will come together and they will Zen they will exchange their final vows they will drink the final cup of wine then he will take her into the tent and there he will reveal himself to her now Matthew chapter 25 the Kingdom of Heaven shall be likened unto 10 virgins five were wise five were foolish while they all slumbered and slept the brid went out and the call goes out behold to meet the bridegroom but notice this is not the bride Matthew 25 is not the bride it's the foolish virgins and the wi virgins but the bride is not even mentioned remember Jesus gives us two Parables of Matthew Matthew 22 and Matthew 25 and one of them relates to the marriage of the King's son and the other is the guest you are not those guest you are the queen you are not those guests that's being invited to the wedding You're the Reason there is a wedding praise the Lord you are the reason that there is a wedding now I want you to notice that whenever it would take place generally the betral or the engagement would last about a year the reason is that is to be able to prove that that woman is not with seed of another man we've been going through that cycle in the message for a long time each generation gets their chance at a Revival so when one generation dies another generation comes and this is what's ongoing right now it's proven some of these people that have been around the message including message preachers have been with seed of another man that's why they can stand for 30 years or 40 years or whatever and preach the message and turn and walk away God have mercy is the only thing I can say oh my but the real bride will remain faithful because her womb in her mind and in her soul Belongs to the Lord Jesus not the devil may I say to the kingdom of hell today you might as well fold up your arms you might as well go ahead and surrender because the bride will not be defeated Satan will never take down this bride because she is ordained of life she is ordained of God all hell can never make her bow she will still be standing when all the Earth Hallelujah has been shaken when the nuclear bombs fall the bride will still be standing on God's promised word when there is no more cancer you still will be when there is no more devil you still will be because you are part of eternal life hallelujah hallelujah [Music] hallelujah hallelujah oh I feel sorry for those that turn away but we know it's necessary you know Jesus spoke a lot of great things and Judas heard a lot of great things I'm sure you know St John 14 when Jesus begins to write or say let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me and my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you you understand I know in St John 13 after the foot washing that Judas leaves St John 14 begins now with the 11 it begins with the 11 and the Lord Jesus St John 14 15 16 17 18 whenever you're coming up to that that is some of the most intimate verses of scripture in the New Testament Judas is now gone and the Lord Jesus is speaking to his bride I'm we hate to see it but there's got to be a Judas that'll pull away from us and whenever they do the Lord Jesus will start working his Works in a way like we've only dreamed Hallelujah remember on the way to emus when he raised from the dead it was him that sat there and performed the great Supernatural and they said no doubt this is him we know him by the way he's breaking bread amen I believe he's still on the Earth today taking men of God moving them aside and breaking the bread of life to the bride Hallelujah now here she comes oh I cannot imagine the anxiety and the worry this is a country girl let me ask you folks are you all getting ready for City Life are y'all getting ready ready for City Life you better be getting ready hallelujah hallelujah oh she's known as the country rural ways you know how that most of us probably country folks can you imagine her thinking in her mind how will I act how will I behave him and there will be diplomats and their wives people from this Embassy and that Embassy and there will be how in the world will I act and I mean what she knew about was cinnamon and and you know lies and flowers and trees that that was where she lived that was what she Ted and they showed up at her door three score men 60 I'm sure you remember the Tabernacle in the wilderness and the way it was laid out first it was set up beyond the camp then they enter into a further stage of the re ation of the Tabernacle and when they do they move the Tabernacle in the middle of the camp and then they got the tribes this way this way this way and this way and when you look at that the way it's perfectly projected by the numbers in the tribes Judah being the largest what you will see is the figure of the Cross and the Tabernacle is right where the cross beams me Hallelujah God showing in the Old Testament this is where I meet my people and God told Moses let them build me a tabernacle that I can live among them can you imagine how almighty God for millions of years has been waiting for that service last night you think you want to see him that's only half the story can you imagine how he longs to see you can you imagine how he's long for this day when he could get his people to this stage and the message over years we spend in the initial stages God sent a prophet God sent a prophet we all rallied around that we're not saying that that's not important it is important but now we're understanding we have a position also Malachi 456 does not just speak about brother br but it speaks about God and it speaks about brother brandham and it speaks about you behold I God will send unto you as a matter of fact God mentions you before he mentions brother brandom behold I will send unto you Elijah the prophet and he will turn the hearts of the children to the father what father as we heard both Services the apostolic fathers that's where we're being restored to and what's the Lord Jesus going to do he's going to use Mighty Valiant men and they're going to bring her home safely Hallelujah they don't have an agenda they don't have a denomination they don't have a desire to build a kingdom they have one purpose bring you home safely this is the real desire of true men of God get you there [Applause] safely so this is the Peloquin the solom and himself rote on and it shows up at her door imagine she goes to the door and she oh my Lord we've come to get you fair lady to take you to your king Hallelujah nervously waiting anticipation maybe trying to learn how to walk you know how do that they it was a whole new life powerless life she had to talk different you see this is why people saying when you're a mom and dad whenever they heard you come to the message maybe some of you young people or some of you family said they're in a cult everything about them is different they're walking different they're dressing different well of course you're getting used to Palace life you can't talk the way you used to talk you can't act the way you used to act we don't say the same things we used to say we don't hang around the same people we used to hang around amen we've got to get used to hanging around Angels not demons people that are in righteousness not wickedness [Applause] of course it was up to the bridegroom to send her the clothes she needed if some of you folks saw me working around my house I'll have an old on an old pair of blue jeans t-shirt depends on what I'm doing I may be laying stone or doing whatever sweating W smell good sweat running down my face and maybe I'll need something and I'll tell Carol I got to go to Lo CU she said you're not going like that why I wouldn't be dressed for the occasion you see you come here today dressed for the occasion right you didn't show up in your bakery clothes if you're a chef or you didn't show up in your easy work clothes you cleaned up thank you for doing that for all the rest of us you took a shower a baths or whatever that you did and you dressed for the occasion you look very nice but she did not have the clothes that she needed for such an occasion but it was the bridegroom's responsibility to provide for the bride something that would be fitting she could not afford such a dress she could not afford such a great thing as that and she knew that and he knew that neither can I stand before him in righteousness on my own neither can I with all my years of preaching all your years of whatever you've done we would be filthy and he knows that so what did he do he provided us a wedding garment he provided us a message in the last days and the prophet said if I can get her to stand still long enough to dress her in the Closs of the word don't you understand what church does for you it's dressing you that's right you imagine as they bring out this beautiful thing she says oh my goodness I've never seen anything like it in my life what what should I do put it on Fair Lady that's right your Royal Highness you imagine how awkward that must have been the first time anyone bow to her let me ask you how do you figure it's going to feel when you walk into heaven the first day and the angels of God the Lord Jesus had not prepared your new city before he came to the Earth but actually said I'm going away to do it what it's been under construction for many years and according to the church age book it's about done then the gates had already been hung the streets had already been laid and those Angelic beings sarap cherubims zooms all the Angelic host are anxiously breathlessly awaiting for who you you see sometimes this awesome presence that we feel it's the Lord letting the Angels come down to just Embrace us as it was to get us used to where we're going huah can you imagine when the angels of God said when we the prophet said whenever we stand here upon this earth and the angels will circle the Earth with bowed heads they have worshiped him since the day they were created for millions of years maybe they've sung they've adored they've worshiped they have praised but one day it will be that they will have nothing to say because you we'll take it from them they will be speechless that's right as we begin to sing Amazing Grace how sweet and the angels just bow their heads I don't know that song do you you know that song I said I've heard them sing it but I don't know it I'm glad I know it aren't you glad you know [Applause] it you see this is why we're not ashamed as brother the Tim dealt with it last night of our Pentecostal experience ever since I've been in this message I've been called a Pentecostal and most of the time it's never been used in a way to describe me in a complimentary way but whether they mean it that way or not I take it as a compliment because to say I'm like Peter I'm like John I'm like James I'm like Andrew that's a compliment to me brother sister Hallelujah I take it as a compliment to have the same baptism of the Holy Ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost I considered a compliment to be going to heaven with the same type of [Applause] people hallelujah as a 12-year-old boy I went to my uncle's church and give my heart to God they taught me I had to have the Holy Ghost I didn't know what the Holy Ghost was went down to the to the river it was a river then it was a lake but it was down in the winter time so the water was real low and they broke the ice and baptized me in titles and then they kept telling me you got to have the Holy Ghost while I went up to the Altar and I'd pray and pray and pray finally one day something hit me Hallelujah I spoke in tongues I was laid around the Altar and cried and spoke in tongue until told I couldn't even get up they packed me out my daddy picked me up after he had got saved finally and picked me up and carried me out laid me in the back seat of the car carried me home I laid there the we hours of the morning still talking in tongues was it real brother Donnie it was real but I needed something to go a little bit deeper you see a baptism can be on your spirit but I didn't want it just on my spirit but I couldn't get it under that message of I'm sitting there in my uncle's church I had to hear the scream of a mighty Valiant Soldier Hallelujah Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelation 10 the Palin had to come and get me and my Holy Ghost had to move into the Seal of my soul [Applause] so here were 60 men anybody happened to know the number of people when the Tabernacle was set in the midst of the congregation of Israel 600,000 600,000 and here 60 men personal guards of Solomon these guys are not mercenaries that were hired from money he sent his own bodyguard after his wife you realize how blessed you are to set under a Ministry of a man of God you realize how blessed you are many of you have heard preachers my message preacher some of the greatest men I believe that's ever lived than any age are alive in this day preaching the truth oh I know a lot of folks in the message don't like them oh that's to their own demise the Lord Jesus sent his men in this day not to add to this message not to take away from this message but to bring this message in their own gift in their own way that God uses them and for what purpose to bring you home safely because the Lord knows you're going to have many battles you're going to have many difficulties and when you leave this service today and some of you start home today or tomorrow whenever it is no telling what awaits you down the road but you didn't just get enough to help you shout while you're here but God wanted to charge your battery so when you go home whatever you face you'll be more than a match for the Devil look out hell here we come look out devil here we come look out caner look out sickness here we come in the name of Jesus hallu but may I say this the bride doesn't just have an Earthly guard Psalms 3 47 the angel of the Lord encamp us round about them that fear Him and Deliver Us them Matthew 18:10 take heed that you despise not one of these little ones for I say unto you that in heaven they Angels you have an angel I tell my church at home all the time I'm so accident prone my angel when whenever I stand before the Lord he'll wind up getting my reward poor guy I've caused him so much hardship in life you know in heaven their Angels do always behold the face of my father do you understand you have an Angelic representation in heaven your angel beholds the face of your father until you get there oh yeah then you can relieve him want you to notice the parallel of the two camps in heaven and in Earth Genesis 32:1 and Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met him and when Jacob saw them he said this is God's host and he called the name of that place May him May anim and it means the place of two camps so here were two camps it was Jacob's camp and the Angelic host Satan ain't scared just so much of you and I but sometimes onever we scream out he ain't hearing our voice he's hearing the voice of the Lord Jesus he may look at you and you say oh I'm such a puny outfit but it may be your angel that steps out from behind you and the devil looks at him and say uhoh uhoh I've been in battle with this one before uhoh you see the time of the bride's passage from this Earth to our home is going to be compassed with Darkness difficult times no doubt some of you have went through such hell in your life is being a Christian and there may be more that lays in front of us cuz we know whoever he takes from this world in a Rapture shows what kind of man he is if our lord Jesus Takes just one liar in the Rapture it proves he himself is a liar if he takes one woman in adultery one man that's uh hooked on porn and still says he believes the message that proves to us what kind of man the Lord Jesus is because the kind of woman a man marries shows what he is right so what kind of people will he take a people that are going to be so tried a people that's going to stand there and they're going to come to such test of life oh you know you hear people talk about it all the time oh I tell I'm just fighting such devils and I'm fighting this and that well the devil's discouraging me I ain't going back to church no more youen that's as far long as you've been been do you understand the real bride is not going to meet just Satan they're going to be challenged by God himself Jacob did not meet the devil he was wrestling with God imagine him tell now Lord you better back off I'm going to hurt you I'm going to hurt you I got to be changed God I got to be changed let me go let me go I will not let you go oh Hallelujah I will not let you go till you change me I don't want to be blessed alone I don't want to just have a little touch I want to be changed how many wants to be changed [Applause] so the bride is placed under the care of these Valiant men of whom must give an account there's no way you can imagine what a man of God grows through to bring one sermon to you the prophet told us that Jesus Jesus will not be beholden to any man so when these Servants of God that have produced The Bride encouraged her helped her I've often said if Carol my wife was going to the grocery store or somewhere out and she wants to have a flat tire she wouldn't even know where to look for that spare in the car would you hone well don't sit there and smile sister some of you wouldn't either God have mercy the truth is some of you men probably [Applause] would but if a man come along and saw her in need maybe he was straggly looking maybe his hair was all long and beard growed out and maybe hadn't took a bath in a few days but he said ma'am you having trouble she tried to call me and couldn't get me tried to call my son-in-laws couldn't get to him she know what she's going to do but this man said ma'am I I won't hurt you I I'm just here to help you if I can I'll be glad to change that for if you want me to she would you please so he changes it for puts it back in there said man' have a nice day I know Carol was left to know she'd say what is your name cuz I know my husband my husband will want to call you my husband will want to thank you and I would can you imagine the Lord Jesus when these men servants walk up before him can you imagine oh my when the Servants of God walk up before him can you imagine when that prophet in this generation walks up before him and he says many snares many difficulties you went through all that you did to bring this message to my bride and when we stand there oh won't it be a Day saints of God when we rally around that seventh angel messenger won't it be a day when you stand behind your pastor when you stand behind those men of God and the Lord Jesus says thank you thank you men of God for praying for preaching for studying for bringing my brother go safely home thank you hallu may I go on to say can you imagine how it's going to be for those around this message who say they don't even need preachers it's going to be a sad day that's right this is the way God's Prophet looked at the ministry God fortified his army with what himself in the form of prophets Apostles teachers pastors God fortified his army with himself in the form of pastors Apostles teachers prophets what was God doing listen did you ever think of the offices in the church it's God's dress inside dress an apostle a prophet a Seer fore before Satan ever gets to it done told it God dressed up in his church these offices are God's dresswear but Brother Don they're human beings of course they are ain't never been a preacher on the earth that wasn't a human being and every one of them is going to make mistakes but that still don't mean they're not God's generals and God's officers and God call [Applause] men what A peculiar term that brother R says these offices if God's dress wear when you see those offices pastors teachers evangelists what is that that's God's dress El where God's presence God's spirit working through men you see the protocol forbid Solomon from touching the Earth to where the shulamite was he couldn't go to her home to get her in other words he had to meet her in between her home in his home so what he did was he chose his personal bodyguards now you understand real God call men they're not in it for a living right I said they're not in it for a living they're not in it so they can be famous rich or important as a matter of fact it's one of the most deadly jobs you could have is to be a real gospel preacher I've had my life threatened many times in different parts of the world and even in the United stes it's hard to believe and my life has been threatened from message people that would have absolutely blowed my brains out had they could have done it and got away with it now that shows how blind some of the poor message people are come on so I I could have found a whole lot safer occupation than being who I am couldn't we Brothers we could have found one that would have made us maybe a whole lot more money but that doesn't really matter the king himself summons me I wasn't called by preachers I wasn't called by no nobody else but the king himself called me come on somebody and let me tell you something if you're a member of the Bride the king himself called you to whether you're a preacher or not you are bidden to be his [Applause] wife notice again the prophet said he presents his army in the form of five offices Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists that's his army that's his soldiers that's his commanding officers wow commanding officers listen what he says now they'll be all with the baptism of the Holy Ghost well praise the Lord we don't have a brandom seminary to send everybody to come on now none of our preachers go to Jeffersonville or Johnson City or wherever more and say I want to enroll in a message of college I want to enroll well we've got some of the pulpit that's all they are is intellectual Giants that's why they fight the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fight the real move of God fight all you want to you ain't going to kill it it's been restored oh it'll burn down I guarantee you it'll burn down all the fodder it'll burn down all the shucks it'll burn down all the trash around it but we ain't never going to put out this original fire because it's the same fire that come off the altar of God the same power that raised the Lord Jesus from the dead he sent it back he sent it back in the form of a pacquin and said get in darling get in what was it that raised Jesus from the dead what was it it wasn't a Doctrine a Doctrine never died for you a Doctrine never hung on the cross a Doctrine never raised from the dead a Doctrine is not coming for you it was a person that's why that person when he received the fullness down at the river he could say destroy this Temple and in three days I will raise it up I'm sure you've noticed it before but the prophet points at out Force Jesus could not say before Calvary all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me he could only say it after he raised from the dead you know of your Bible very well in the four gospels you know he was not called Lord Jesus Christ and neither Matthew Mark Luke or John he's only called that in the book of Acts praise the Lord this same God has he made both Lord and Christ so that's where we get Lord Jesus Christ Lord curios Master Christ Christos anointed one he was born Jesus but he become Christ he was born Jesus but he become into the position of Lord so he was Lord Jesus Christ we were born lost but we come into the position of being found we were Bor Hallelujah we were born blind but now we see we have been born into that position notice chapter 3:8 here in the Song of Solomon watch how it describes these men they all hold swords now wasn't amazing their identification was not they was holding a tape player and pushing play now they do push play that's where they feed on right Brothers we feed there we feed on the message of the hour but their defense for the bride was say oh devil back off back off I'll push play I'm I'm warning you devil I'll push play and Obey I'm telling you [Music] devil God never had 60 MP3 players or 60 tape recorders either real to real or a track or cassette but most of us don't even have them anymore anyway well well don't get quiet on me now and start pouting but I want you to notice what they had swords you think these men don't know how to use it I wouldn't want to have a front seat on the front row but sometimes I'd like to hear after these meetings when the demons go Gathering down in hell [Applause] I cannot imagine this meeting's been planned of course since last year already demons was dreading it I guess you're going to have one next year if the Lord Telles they're already dreading next year too can you imagine when the devil said all right all right which demon is the sign now who wants to volunteer for service the Full Gospel Lighthouse for Jesus has got their meetings set for 2024 BL the Rapture of course takes place oh yeah he believes in rapure that's right how many wants to volunteer every deviled hallelujah hallelujah you imagine them saying I don't want my hi burned I don't want my hi tore off they shouted they jumped they daned all over my head I don't want to go up there oh Hallelujah hallu and then Satan goes to picking him vacation I'm on vacation I'm going to Dollywood I'm going to the resort I don't want to go please say let me out of it imagine they say devil you don't know what it's like you get to stay down here in the main headquarters y'all to be up there amongst them bunch of preachers y'all to be up there when they get alone in the presence of God and they go to study even them young girls go to shouting and dancing even them y'all you see when the Lord Jesus gave birth to this searching machine and Peter thought James and them they thought well we got to carry the word on that what are we going to do and the devil had just seen what they' all done at Calvary every one of them denied him every one of them turned away John Mo was the only one that we know of that was even near at the cross at the time of his death and them demons down in hell was s said this thing won't last six months well Peter's got an issue with John and John's got an issue with Andrew and they've all got an issue with all the rest of them I mean they're the only ones right remember them two sons of thunder sons of ban Andes and they said why yeah they'll kill one another in 6 months time that's why they needed to go to Pentecost you see if we could get a lot of our message preachers filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost we'd get rid of allot this preacher jealousy wouldn't we Brothers we get rid of all these false ideas and false doctrines come on somebody and building Cults if we can get the generals if we can get the preachers full of the Holy Ghost and the power of God hallelujah to carry out the work of the Lord Jesus hell will pay hell will [Applause] pay some of them poor old dumb Devils sat said all right who wants to go attack this thing called the church thing he never had heard the word before he didn't know what it was he heard Jesus said there Matthew on this rock I'll build my church he said church that's a new word I don't remember that in the old test what we got that at well he must be going to get some new guys I me because they no way these guys can do it I've done seen all the issues they cause among themselves but Jesus said Boys you've got my quotes you've got the quotes of the prophets you've been quoting them you've been talking about it for years most of the pH most of the disciples if you know it were Pharisees most of them were so they were very legal very legal they studied that law they knew that law but they didn't have the Holy Ghost I hate to pull cold water on the service this morning but I'm afraid that's one of the biggest lacks Among [Music] Us so him devil said say all right I need somebody go up around the day of Pentecost I'll go this is going to be fun I can't wait I'll have John and Peter they'll be knocking one another's block off I'll get Peter so iming up Peter was I'll get him so angry at all the rest of them and they waited day one day two day three day four and when the day of Pentecost was fully come them demons was hanging around that Upper Room Mayday May Mighty Satan we've been tricked amen what do you mean what do you mean we thought it was them preachers but it's Jesus it's Jesus he come back on the day of Pentecost in the form of the pillar of fire and Peter got part and John got part and Andrew got part oh I'd love to been down in hell that day when it said Satan he done it again you remember how he tricked us on Calvary he tricked us on P go Satan I hate to be the bear of bad news on we thought we done a a great thing when we kill Jesus but I'm afraid we've spread this [Applause] thing Hallelujah I'm afraid we've spread this s Satan H how many days did the Lord Jesus walked by the lame man at the gate cuz that was a way he frequented I heard brother Rong say years ago you imagine he'd look at that guy and say hold on my boys will be through here after a while I'll save this one for Peter hallelujah hallelujah Satan for years has been tickled to death with us message folks cuz we have fussed we have fought not saying the fusses is over either not saying the fighting is over but our goal today is not to point to one of these men our goal today is not to point to this man or any other man on the internet our goal is to point you toward the lord Jesus and to beckon you to get in in the Matan get in the pacquin amen ride this thing Hallelujah ride this thing to your body change [Applause] Church imagine when she opens the door and she looks outside your ladyship we have come to carry you to your king wonder the anticipation just like we feel I'm not good enough I'm not worthy how can I do this I'm a country girl I'm not ready for City Life how can I be a queen how can I be a queen imagine the main one stepping up my lady this is Solomon's Matan himself you mean the king himself wrote this into the palace yes my lady and he wanted to make sure that you felt very comfortable so he didn't send you another Spirit but he on H Hallelujah Hall you imagine Here Comes This 10 cow bride my lady these 60 Valiant men pastors teachers evangelists there they stand scars on their faces some of them with fingers cut off some of them limping a little bit David said I want my greatest men in that last age to escort [Music] her there they stand imagine some of them standing there my lady my lady scar in their face one over here with his hand nearly cut off standing there battle scarred veterans she could rest knowing they were experts through many dangerous tolls and snares we have already come and many of them were done for your sake did not Paul tell the first age Church age Christian he said I was thrown in jail I was beaten I went through all of this for you as a matter of fact after Paul being thrown in jail there was a Roman guard which kept Paul that was one of them that was actually converted Paul had to go down to jail to get that seed praise be to God and many preachers started preaching after they heard Paul was thrown in jail how many men have been affected by the lives of these men and others like them around the world so she tells her mother goodbye my mama Baptist th Mama Church of God that's right B Mama Apostolic B Mama Church of Christ soal honey don't go don't go you follow it a cold like the little Eagle down in the Barnard when the mama eagle flew over [Applause] and he looked around and said what in the world was that because there was something on the inside that answered to that [Applause] scream Hallelujah you imagine and that old Pastor rooster call call call where false St away for that you get a [Music] [Applause] tap imagine as she look back at that house and said goodbye World [Applause] goodbye now remember it had silver on it the Peloquin which speaks of redemption silver it had gold which speaks of deity made of chatim wood which spoke of of humanity so the deity overlaid the humanity it had blue which spoke of the Heavenly it had the Scarlet which also was a color of dignity remember it was the AIL cacus the silicus know what that was it was a little insect a tiny little insect that lived on oak trees and only the female would have one little tiny drop of this C color that they would use to make the colors of scarlet and blue the other was a molusk out of the Mediterranean Sea they had to go to so much trouble to get those colors but they were colors of dignity and royalty she' probably never even touched such stuff before right but now they help her up into this place let me tell you something children if the first church age Christians would have heard some of these messages y'all have heard this week that'll probably tore this building down what God has sa for us in this last day he knew we need it he knew all hell would turn loose against us and he said I've got to save my message of the end time it's going to be full of dynamite Hallelujah I'm going to anoint my men Hallelujah you imagine if Peter was here today can you imagine if John was here today the deacons would have had to set him down Peter would have been running around glory to God glory to God they say well Peter's at it again yeah he's on another drw the prophet said when you get the Holy Ghost you can be intoxicated every day of your life you go to bed intoxicated you get up intoxicated [Applause] they all whole swords being expert in war now they were not grasping them but it's where they had them on their thigh if you notice in the Book of Revelation that's where our Lord wore him is so they pack their sword high like he did praise the Lord Brother don't you ever get afraid y ought to send me back up before I come out nervous wreck you ever get scared brother Ron brother Tim brother Timothy Carol said praying for this morning she was coming to church I said thank you because I don't have a clue what I'm going to preach oh she grabbed him the hand and said dear God please help Donnie today please help him you ought have been praying to if you know how to I wasn't sure which way to go but when I'm called to fight I do know how to fight don't we we know how to fight so devil at your own risk at your own risk devil false Doctrine sheep Stealers enter at your own risk because we do know how to use this sword Hallelujah and we will use it to defend God's [Applause] bride you see the King was taking no chanes that's right there would have been Marauders there would have been Bandits they would have to camp at night this is more than a Day's Journey so they can only move so far and they'd have to stop are you okay my lady I'm fine I'm just I'm just trying to absorb all this I know bless your hearts some of y'all are going to leave this meeting drunker than I don't know what these men of God have overloaded you I'm telling you why they have given you so much stuff you're going to be gnawing on this Lamb's leg for days to come what do we doing eating the lamb before the journey maybe she had a fear of the night I've been in Africa and India and different parts of the world some of you Brothers traveled having the sounds there are so different I was in Africa several years ago at a hunting lodge and the man told me said now we've been having a leopard that comes around the place great bacon for a leopard and you know what was sad about it was they didn't have no locks on them doors and I'm thinking yall sure ain't Americans we lock our doors our windows and we put on the locks wouldn't you know at 3:00 in the morning I was woke up with this strange peculiar sound I grab the covers and pull them up by my neck so the next morning I told that guy I said man I must have heard that leopard he said what sound was it making I told him he SL said it was an anater [Laughter] that's the way the devil likes to do us he'll come and say I'm going to kill you I'm going to give you cancer it's going to take your life I'm going to take your boy I'm going to take your daughter and the Lord says I've got a mighty General standing at your door oh Hallelujah it ain't nothing but an an eater don't pay no attention to it an eaters are totally [Applause] harmless so this journey was about 50 50 miles now remember she didn't they didn't charge a Delta jet didn't have Amtrak in those days but she had all these men around her 50 miles so at least two if not three night stops would have been made so the sounds of the night coming in when the sun would start to set you know how it is at the night it didn't amazing your house can make all kinds of sounds during the day you hardly pay no attention to it but at night time especially if you're in somebody else's house and I've stayed in some houses before you believe whatever you want to believe okay but I've seen ghosts before now I know you think I'm crazy let me tell you you see some man standing in your bedroom that ain't supposed to be there and he disappears you'll believe in them [Applause] too you imagine just ever now that you okay my lady you okay I'm fine thank you all I'm I'm not worthy of all this all this attention oh my lady I don't want to disagree with you but you see I'm personal bodyguard to the king I've seen how you've smitten him as a matter of fact Solomon says one of your eyes just one of your eyes has captured my heart and he said turn away turn away my love I can barely stand even look at you your beauty has so taken me Hallelujah you see it's not because of who we are it's what he's given us that beautifies us that's right I saw a picture of a man several years ago he was up on this church he went to a Baptist Church and he he was Up on the Roof doing some work and he got his tools into the electrical wire coming in to that church and it caused this tremendous fire and once he got into the vaults he could not get out so it burned off his face and his hands and just terrible terrible he was one of the first people in America actually to have a face transplant he a girl would come to him every day he lived he lived but he had no face and she take him by the hand Daddy I love you no mouse couldn't talk but this man received a face transplant of course the first two people that he wanted to see was his wife and his daughter and she comes into the hospital room take your daddy my daddy you see the Lord Jesus put a face on Spirit God that's why Paul said we see it in the face of Jesus Christ we knew him from the Old Testament but we didn't have his face we couldn't tell what he look like but when brother brandom saw him he saw him there and he what do you see a face right a face he come through the fires of hell so the face of God could be put on so you could look not at a spirit but as a human being I don't know about you I can't wait till I finally get my time I've sensed his presence I've heard his voice audibly several times but how I wait for the day and I'll be able to just bow down and just sit there oh Jesus oh Jesus should I touch him or not should I I know he want me to said touch me Don go ahead don't only way I've ever known him is a veil between me and him cuz I need it but one day that'll be taken oh man of God God help me get home help me but you're a preacher but I need preachers too I need preachers help me help me get home let me find a place to stop I feel brother Tim's anointing getting on me now [Applause] let me speed up the journey so they would have sent Messengers to Solomon and they said she's just outside the city so they would have had incense they would have had musicians yes Heaven has music they would have had singers Levites coites they would have had all the music and all of that and you imagine as she's getting closer I don't know if I'm ready for this I don't know you okay my lady are you are you okay Lord have mercy children you realize that Peter and James and John and Bartholomew and thus and Paul and and and Luther and and all the rest of those saints that have gone they have not yet seen the Lord Jesus face to face they're waiting in the sixth Dimension because it would be Unbecoming for them to see him in his Priestly garments splattered with the blood as it were so as long as there's one on the Earth that needs that Redemption he will still be dressed on those high priest clothes but you imagine one day he will step out and the angels will look at him and say today is the day how will they know it his chains of garments he won't have on a high priest garment glory be to God I feel like speaking in language now that in English Hallelujah can you imagine when the angels look at him and say today is the day the last one come in the last one got filled with the Holy Ghost the last one's come to maturity I don't know how it'll happen it'll be a miracle because all over the Earth the bride will be in that state however long without a high priest maybe 24 hours 12 hours two weeks I don't know how long it'll be but he'll change his clothes and he'll step out from behind the curtain as it was and the angels of God will say he's going to get her he's going to get her glory to God he's going get her today oh Lord he should the name [Applause] Jesus and all of the sudden all over the Earth a great sweep is what the prophet called it think of it going beyond the camp 1964 think of it missing people and they can't find you no more you're getting together with the rest of the group and you come up missing on the earth huah wow hallelujah hallelujah you come up missing on the earth and the devil said where did they go yeah where did they go I don't know what happened to them what happened to them they were LED they were led by men of God they were riding the Peloquin and merged into his presence so the singing the music from herem Jerusalem the incense would have come they would have also had incense preceding her here she was coming dressed in this Royal attire and the incense was fragrancing her as she come up into the presence of King Solomon you imagine whenever the preachers come and they deliver the precious cargo I was looking at this morning brother brim said that he valued you more than he did his own blood because he gave his blood for youlu if we had the literal blood of Jesus in our hands oh how carefully we would handle it I need to handle you more carefully than if I had the literal blood CU he gave that for you I love the word he uses a sweep will go over you you see we're used to being swept we were swept off our feet by him and then Jesus gives us a parable of the woman that had the 10 coins remember that and she lost one of them coins so what did she find out was the way to be able to find that coin she swept the house so the brides used to been swept and cleaned and re cleaned and swept you see those of you who don't like to be swept if I was you I'd get straightened out because that is part of the Rapture that's right so one of these days I'm going to get my final sweep and it'll go all over the Earth who knows where it'll start and all of a sudden Oh Glory to God maybe brother Tim will be sitting having his morning coffee looking across the table and thinking oh Karen how much I miss you how I love you and he'll feel a hand L over on his shoulder hallu and you know it won't be long then you're going to be changed you're going to be changed children the devil will have all kinds of things along the journey to get you out of the Peloquin of the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't you leave it how he loves him today hallelujah how many has needs here today in your life in your family your home that you just raised your hand to the Lord maybe it's sick you need healing maybe the Holy Ghost would you mind doing something that we haven't done all these these three services would you just lay your hand over on the person standing by you we're going to pray for one another dear Lord Jesus we count it's such an honor to ride in your pacquin the same robe that fit Elijah after years of molding Elisha wore that same robe and you sent back the same Holy Ghost for us to be filled with Lord may we climb up in this Peloquin of the Holy Ghost and sit there till the day of our Redemption may we hear the teaching and the preaching of Ministers of the Gospel that we can be changed Lord how we thank you for these Services dear God we have our hands laid one upon the other right now father in the name of of Jesus I rebuke depression I rebuke sickness Satan in the name of Jesus you are Defeated come
