[54:31] cause i'm so in love
[54:36] hallelujah what a love affair
[54:39] that's going on between the bride
[54:42] and the bridegroom what a special time
[54:45] that we're in
[54:48] it's wedding season there's a much ado
[54:51] about
[54:52] full gospel lighthouse there's many
[54:54] things that are
[54:55] taking place and transpiring and uh
[54:59] all that is due to a wedding that's
[55:02] coming forward
[55:03] a lot of work's being done on the
[55:05] landscape and a lot of work's being done
[55:06] in the fellowship hall
[55:08] and we want to thank brother jim he's
[55:10] putting the final touches on the
[55:11] fellowship hall
[55:12] appreciate him doing all that for us and
[55:15] it looks amazing
[55:17] and looking forward to the time when we
[55:19] can all be back in there together
[55:21] and uh but there's something else that's
[55:24] going on
[55:26] all this is because a wedding has taken
[55:29] place
[55:30] all the stirring on the inside of the
[55:31] bride is because there's a wedding
[55:33] taking place
[55:35] i believe what a prophet said that he
[55:37] slept that
[55:38] he slipped that wedding band of
[55:40] unmerited grace upon your finger before

[57:01] day long
[57:04] but i believe god's got something to say
[57:06] to us tonight
[57:08] amen it's always good when he passes by
[57:11] our way
[57:12] romans chapter 8 and verse 1 and the
[57:15] bible says that
[57:16] there is therefore now no condemnation
[57:19] to them which are in christ jesus who
[57:22] walk not after the flesh
[57:24] but after the spirit if you're going
[57:26] down to verse 14
[57:30] the bible says here for as many as are
[57:33] led
[57:34] by the spirit of god they are the sons
[57:37] of god
[57:38] now what led you here this evening
[57:41] that shows you who you are for you have
[57:44] not received
[57:45] the spirit of bondage again to fear but
[57:47] ye have received
[57:48] the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ab
[57:51] our father
[57:53] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[57:56] our spirit
[57:56] that we are the children of god
[58:00] and if children then heirs heirs of god
[58:03] and joint heirs with christ
[58:05] if so be that we suffer with him
[58:08] that we may be also glorified together
[58:10] let's just speak to the lord just now
[58:13] heavenly father we come and approach the
[58:15] throne of mercy lord one more time
[58:17] lord as we humble ourselves in the
[58:19] presence of the lord we
[58:20] we just ask god for a special move of
[58:23] the holy spirit lord
[58:25] you see these things lord that you've
[58:26] placed upon my heart lord jesus and i i
[58:29] just asking lord that you would set me
[58:31] aside just for a few moments in time
[58:33] to speak to your children father you see
[58:35] the needs that are amongst us the hearts
[58:38] lord jesus that need a real a real
[58:40] refilling of the holy ghost
[58:42] lord those that are that are carrying
[58:44] burdens lord that seem too much
[58:46] but may they come and lay them down at
[58:48] the feet of jesus tonight
[58:50] lord as you pass by our way lord i pray
[58:53] that we be careful to reach out and
[58:55] touch you
[58:56] lord help me to do a good job and get
[58:57] out of the way in jesus name
[58:59] amen god bless you you can be seated in
[59:01] the presence of the lord this evening
[59:05] it's an amazing thing as children that
[59:08] we
[59:09] as children of god we we are influenced
[59:12] by another realm we are influenced by
[59:15] by this book we are influenced by his
[59:17] spirit and we know that
[59:19] that the more we read this book the more
[59:21] we begin to look like the author of this
[59:23] book
[59:24] and you can watch as a child as they
[59:26] begin to walk that you can notice
[59:27] certain characteristics how they walk
[59:29] and how they handle themselves that
[59:31] they're picking up different things
[59:32] that are passed down through their
[59:34] genealogy and how they handle themselves
[59:36] and
[59:36] how they move and there's certain things
[59:38] that you just can't you just can't make
[59:40] up but it's just
[59:41] birthed down through a bloodline and
[59:43] characteristics are passed down
[59:45] and the bible says here that we walk not
[59:47] after the flesh but we walk after the
[59:50] spirit
[59:51] and we realize that today that we're
[59:53] living in a very
[59:54] powerful time as sons and daughters of
[59:56] god but we're living in a very
[59:58] odd time but we know that we're living
[1:00:00] and what brother branham would say that
[1:00:02] we're living
[1:00:03] in two worlds and we can be walking
[1:00:05] right here in the midst
[1:00:06] in the midst of laodicea and we can
[1:00:08] realize that there are two worlds that
[1:00:10] are going on there's a world that's more
[1:00:12] real than this world
[1:00:14] that is sitting here and in that world
[1:00:16] everything is perfect in that world
[1:00:18] in that world our law our loved ones are
[1:00:20] there and
[1:00:21] and i find it amazing that brother
[1:00:23] branham would say about our loved ones
[1:00:25] he said they're only as far away
[1:00:27] as you make them and you remember you
[1:00:29] remember
[1:00:30] when when brother branham was after his
[1:00:32] wife mita after her mother had passed
[1:00:34] away and she was just having a real hard
[1:00:35] time with it
[1:00:36] and brother branham began to speak to
[1:00:37] her he said honey he said it may not be
[1:00:39] necessarily something that you can
[1:00:40] understand
[1:00:41] he said but your mother he said it may
[1:00:43] not be something you understand he said
[1:00:44] but your mother
[1:00:45] is sitting right over there on the couch
[1:00:47] so you see it's there
[1:00:48] that world is right here and they're
[1:00:51] only as far
[1:00:52] as we make them now if we realize and
[1:00:55] brother jason jackson sent me a quote
[1:00:56] last weekend he said now
[1:00:58] he said when i go off of the scene
[1:00:59] brother brandon i'm saying when i go off
[1:01:00] the scene
[1:01:01] he said he said and you start singing
[1:01:03] that song i only believe
[1:01:05] he said i'll be ever so close he said
[1:01:08] i'll be there
[1:01:08] listening at you at you singing that
[1:01:11] song and he said if i go on
[1:01:13] he said if i go on you sing that song
[1:01:15] and i'll be real close
[1:01:16] now now think about that just for a
[1:01:18] moment when you begin to think that if
[1:01:19] that realm
[1:01:20] if that realm is that close and they're
[1:01:22] moving just a bit faster than this realm
[1:01:25] is moving
[1:01:25] they're in another dimension how much
[1:01:28] greater as
[1:01:29] god is he's coming to his children and
[1:01:31] he's doing his best to get his children
[1:01:34] out of this dimension into that
[1:01:35] dimension where we don't worry about
[1:01:38] things we don't fear about things but i
[1:01:40] i really believe that tonight that that
[1:01:42] we're setting in a spot that only
[1:01:44] believers can walk
[1:01:45] in we are living in an hour where only
[1:01:48] the fully adopted sons of god can walk
[1:01:50] in this
[1:01:51] hour and they only can tap into the
[1:01:53] channel of the holy ghost
[1:01:55] and only the elect can walk there and
[1:01:57] brother branham would tell us that out
[1:01:59] of
[1:01:59] every single revival twins would come up
[1:02:02] and you see
[1:02:03] whenever you you try to do things in the
[1:02:05] carnal realm you'll always
[1:02:07] produce carnality but any times the
[1:02:10] spirit realm begins to come and come
[1:02:12] behind the word of god
[1:02:13] you will see the real genuine christian
[1:02:16] believer is produced
[1:02:18] under that spirit of word under that
[1:02:20] word of the hour
[1:02:21] and you remember you remember when abram
[1:02:23] when he was when he was given a promise
[1:02:25] that god had promised him that he was
[1:02:27] going to have a son
[1:02:29] and throughout throughout his life and
[1:02:31] here he was when god testified to him at
[1:02:33] 75 years old that he was going to have a
[1:02:35] son
[1:02:36] and his wife 60 years old told them that
[1:02:38] they were going to have a son
[1:02:39] and they they hadn't seen anything they
[1:02:41] hadn't they hadn't seen any movement
[1:02:43] they hadn't seen any
[1:02:44] they hadn't seen the spirit move on them
[1:02:46] for a long time they hadn't felt the
[1:02:48] anointing of god move on them for a long
[1:02:50] time
[1:02:51] so they tried to go into the carnal
[1:02:53] realm and they produced themselves an
[1:02:55] ismailite
[1:02:56] you see when they when they begin to
[1:02:58] produce an ishmaelite they produced a
[1:03:00] wild man
[1:03:00] and we know we know that when abraham
[1:03:03] and sarah begin to trust in their own
[1:03:05] human ingenuity and they begin to use
[1:03:08] hagar
[1:03:09] to bear the child ishmael that he was
[1:03:11] born
[1:03:12] a child of fleshly bondage and any
[1:03:14] anytime that you try
[1:03:16] to produce an intellectual conception of
[1:03:18] this message
[1:03:19] you will always produce a child of
[1:03:21] fleshly bondage
[1:03:23] you see whenever you try to talk
[1:03:24] somebody in this message
[1:03:26] you'll there'll somebody else be able to
[1:03:27] talk them out of this message whenever
[1:03:29] you try to
[1:03:30] show them certain things somebody else
[1:03:32] can
[1:03:33] show them or show them something else
[1:03:35] but anytime that the spirit of the
[1:03:37] living god comes behind
[1:03:38] something and he puts a stamp of
[1:03:40] approval upon it it will produce nothing
[1:03:43] but a genuine
[1:03:44] son and daughter of god you don't have
[1:03:46] to work it up you don't have to pump it
[1:03:48] up you don't have to prime it up
[1:03:49] because it's what god said that it would
[1:03:52] be it's not nothing intellectual
[1:03:54] it's not a wild man it's not a religious
[1:03:56] man but it's somebody that's been in the
[1:03:58] arena
[1:03:58] that somebody that's met melchizedek
[1:04:00] it's somebody that has met him
[1:04:02] and they know that he's going to change
[1:04:04] their body and the same one that
[1:04:06] changed their body can produce an isaac
[1:04:08] and if a god can produce an isaac
[1:04:10] he can produce a realm and if he can
[1:04:12] produce a realm he can produce a
[1:04:14] sacrifice and if he can produce a
[1:04:15] sacrifice
[1:04:16] he can produce children right here in
[1:04:18] laodicea that'll come out above every
[1:04:20] triumph
[1:04:21] above every temptation above every
[1:04:23] sickness above
[1:04:24] every desire and every temptation
[1:04:26] because we
[1:04:28] are not of the bondwoman but we are of
[1:04:30] the free
[1:04:31] and paul said stand fast in the liberty
[1:04:35] where christ
[1:04:36] has made us free he didn't tell us to go
[1:04:39] back
[1:04:40] into the world he told us to stand like
[1:04:42] a man
[1:04:43] be firm like a man preach like a man
[1:04:46] live like a man sing like a man love
[1:04:49] like a man
[1:04:50] he told us to stand fast therefore in
[1:04:53] the liberty
[1:04:54] when christ came to set you free he
[1:04:56] didn't save you
[1:04:58] to put you up in some bondage he sets
[1:05:00] you
[1:05:01] free he sets you free that you can live
[1:05:04] this message
[1:05:05] he sets you free that you could be this
[1:05:08] message
[1:05:08] he set you free because the son of man
[1:05:12] was looking for a body to live in and i
[1:05:15] say
[1:05:15] to the church of the living god you are
[1:05:18] that body
[1:05:21] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:05:28] hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the
[1:05:32] lord
[1:05:33] now notice notice here and expectancy
[1:05:37] the brothers have it upstairs he said
[1:05:39] now what man
[1:05:41] calls foolish god calls great
[1:05:45] now what man cause full is god calls
[1:05:48] great and what
[1:05:49] just vice versa that's right what god is
[1:05:51] full of what is foolishness of god seems
[1:05:53] great to man
[1:05:55] and what is great to god seems fullness
[1:05:57] to people
[1:05:58] you got to get out of the world into a
[1:06:00] spirit a supernatural realm
[1:06:03] to understand it certainly you have
[1:06:07] so you've got to get out of this
[1:06:10] carnality
[1:06:11] to break into the realm of the
[1:06:13] supernatural
[1:06:15] in jesus on the authority of the word he
[1:06:16] said now visions make me weak he said
[1:06:19] you're living in two worlds you're here
[1:06:22] and then and you're in another world and
[1:06:23] you can't help that
[1:06:25] just like you dream to dream with your
[1:06:26] eyes open
[1:06:28] he said god does that in sovereign grace
[1:06:30] not because you asked for it
[1:06:32] you couldn't ask for it god does it
[1:06:34] himself
[1:06:35] before you were born this was set in
[1:06:38] order by god it's your subconscious
[1:06:40] scientifically speaking like
[1:06:42] you dream a dream this conscious is
[1:06:44] inactive and this one becomes active
[1:06:47] then when you awake when you're asleep
[1:06:49] your dreams and things you did here
[1:06:51] then when you wake up this one is
[1:06:53] inactive and this one here is active
[1:06:55] then you remember things that you
[1:06:57] dreamed of years ago
[1:06:59] you know what i'm talking about you know
[1:07:00] what the brother branham is speaking
[1:07:01] here
[1:07:02] you dreamed a dream some 20 years ago
[1:07:03] and there's certain things
[1:07:05] details in there so so so defined
[1:07:09] that you know everything about
[1:07:13] i remember having a dream as a young
[1:07:16] child i remember having a dream that we
[1:07:18] were there my papaw charlie's old church
[1:07:20] and
[1:07:21] it seemed like it seemed like there was
[1:07:24] kind of an odd dream
[1:07:25] but it seemed like i i was down at the i
[1:07:28] was down at the altar
[1:07:30] and i was one of i was one of a pen
[1:07:33] of a bowling ball and a bowling ball
[1:07:34] this great big black bowling ball
[1:07:36] kept coming it was a nightmare what it
[1:07:39] was
[1:07:40] kept coming and trying to knock me down
[1:07:42] and i kept having that dream throughout
[1:07:44] all of my life
[1:07:45] and there are certain things that i
[1:07:46] remember about that but i never had that
[1:07:49] dream ever again
[1:07:50] when i found the blood
[1:07:53] you see there are certain things that
[1:07:55] are active in the subconscious that
[1:07:57] you're grabbing hold of
[1:07:59] he said now he said this conscious is
[1:08:01] inactive and this one becomes active
[1:08:03] then when you awake when you're asleep
[1:08:04] you dream things they did here
[1:08:06] and then when you wake up this one is
[1:08:08] inactive and this one here is
[1:08:10] active then you remember things that you
[1:08:12] dreamed of years ago
[1:08:13] you were some part of somewhere you were
[1:08:16] a part
[1:08:18] of you somewhere some people doesn't
[1:08:20] dream their subconscious is way back a
[1:08:22] dreamer doesn't sleep
[1:08:24] sound and then he can't help it because
[1:08:26] he dreams but a seer and a seer is
[1:08:28] neither
[1:08:28] his subconscious back there nor here is
[1:08:31] right there
[1:08:32] he doesn't go to sleep he breaks from
[1:08:34] one world to another
[1:08:36] and from the natural to the supernatural
[1:08:38] now you remember when brother branham
[1:08:40] went to mayo clinic and they began to
[1:08:41] speak to him
[1:08:42] and they began to look at him and tell
[1:08:44] him that his subconscious
[1:08:46] and his conscience laid right close
[1:08:48] together
[1:08:49] and they said now he said they told him
[1:08:51] they said no this is a very odd thing
[1:08:52] and they wanted to study him out and
[1:08:53] understand some of these things
[1:08:56] and he said he said now he said i can't
[1:08:57] make that opry
[1:08:59] he said only god can make that operate
[1:09:02] he said he said i
[1:09:03] began to talk to the doctor and begin to
[1:09:05] tell them he said he said can you
[1:09:06] dream me a dream he said neither can i
[1:09:09] have a vision for you
[1:09:10] but you see brother branham was breaking
[1:09:12] into a world and
[1:09:14] whenever you would hear brother random
[1:09:15] on tape you'll hear him break into a
[1:09:17] world
[1:09:18] he can begin to tell you somebody's past
[1:09:21] he can tell you what they've been
[1:09:22] through
[1:09:23] because he's breaking into a world that
[1:09:25] was real
[1:09:26] it was something that had went on in the
[1:09:28] past and not profit by a divine gift
[1:09:31] was able to look into that realm and
[1:09:34] break in there
[1:09:35] and show them show them their past
[1:09:38] it's an amazing thing when you go to
[1:09:39] studying all of those scriptures and
[1:09:41] studying all the things about prophets
[1:09:43] and seers down through the old testament
[1:09:44] and then you see in this last day that
[1:09:47] there is a prophet
[1:09:48] that would come and would break into a
[1:09:50] channel and begin to tell you all about
[1:09:52] your past but what i love about that
[1:09:54] is brother branham didn't leave you at
[1:09:56] that spot in your past but he would also
[1:09:58] tell you
[1:09:59] about your future i
[1:10:02] i try not to get ahead of myself but i
[1:10:04] want to tell you god's already seen your
[1:10:06] future
[1:10:07] now notice he said he said here in jesus
[1:10:10] christ saying yesterday he said just
[1:10:11] think
[1:10:11] it breaks out into another dimension
[1:10:13] speaking of visions
[1:10:15] he said out where nobody knows nothing
[1:10:17] about it it's in a supernatural realm
[1:10:19] and calls up things that has been done
[1:10:23] way years ago how can you doubt god now
[1:10:26] he's speaking to his sister he said
[1:10:27] throat's better now isn't it sister
[1:10:29] is that right raise your hand you're
[1:10:30] healed that's exactly
[1:10:32] i didn't even tell you what it was it
[1:10:35] told you
[1:10:36] what had happened you're healed you're
[1:10:39] all right god bless you
[1:10:41] you see there the spirit of the living
[1:10:43] god was speaking about something that
[1:10:45] was happening
[1:10:46] right there in the natural but a
[1:10:48] supernatural god
[1:10:50] broke in through a seer and told this
[1:10:53] sister
[1:10:53] he told you what had happened
[1:10:57] whoo hallelujah when brother branham
[1:10:59] begins to have his first experience with
[1:11:01] with the second pool and you know what
[1:11:03] the first pool was that brother random
[1:11:05] had they
[1:11:05] had the gift in his hand and in the
[1:11:07] second pool when brother branham was
[1:11:08] there in saskatchewan
[1:11:10] in the queen's garden arena there was a
[1:11:12] woman that was standing before him he'd
[1:11:14] seen visions before but this woman
[1:11:16] this had never happened in his second
[1:11:18] ministry here the first time this woman
[1:11:20] standing before him
[1:11:21] and he said he said now something's
[1:11:23] happening brother baxter
[1:11:25] caught what had happened he said now
[1:11:26] this is what the angel told you about
[1:11:28] but there he said he said now this
[1:11:30] sister standing in front of him
[1:11:31] he said now he said now i i see a little
[1:11:34] girl that's that's 12 years old and got
[1:11:36] a school desk she's sitting at a school
[1:11:37] desk
[1:11:38] and she's bouncing a pen and the pin
[1:11:40] flies up and it strikes her in the eye
[1:11:42] and that sister says hey that was me i'm
[1:11:45] blind in my right eye
[1:11:46] and then the vision moves and he said he
[1:11:49] sees a 16 year old girl
[1:11:51] running as hard as she could with a
[1:11:52] ribbon in her hair and a checkered dress
[1:11:55] he said i said i see you running and
[1:11:57] you're running from a great big yellow
[1:11:59] dog that's chasing you and that same
[1:12:01] sister says
[1:12:02] that was me that was me and brother
[1:12:04] random then he said i was looking down
[1:12:06] at her
[1:12:07] and i looked back again and he said i
[1:12:09] seen a lady coming from a white house or
[1:12:11] a barn
[1:12:11] red-looking barn coming towards a white
[1:12:13] house and she had an apron on and
[1:12:15] holding something like this
[1:12:17] she was walking slow and i seen her and
[1:12:18] i said i see a lady coming i said sister
[1:12:21] it's you that was a normal time then i
[1:12:24] said i couldn't recognize it
[1:12:26] he said i could recognize it being the
[1:12:28] same woman
[1:12:29] i said now i see the lady you started up
[1:12:32] the steps and i see there's a flower bed
[1:12:34] over to your right and the steps go up
[1:12:36] like this and there's something wrong
[1:12:38] with your back i see
[1:12:39] i i see you can't get up the steps and i
[1:12:42] see
[1:12:43] and i said you leaned over sideways and
[1:12:45] you're crying and heard her say
[1:12:47] if i can ever get to brother branham's
[1:12:49] meetings it'll be over
[1:12:51] and then when i said that somebody
[1:12:53] caught the woman
[1:12:54] now why would god show him this without
[1:12:58] having a purpose behind it
[1:13:00] brother branham said now he's in the
[1:13:02] absolute brother madam said he
[1:13:04] said when there was millions out there
[1:13:06] in the world that was groping and sin
[1:13:08] and he saved me he said but he had a
[1:13:10] reason in saving me
[1:13:12] he said when there was bishops when
[1:13:14] there was great
[1:13:15] educational and intellectual people he
[1:13:17] said but he saved me
[1:13:19] for a reason he saved me for a reason
[1:13:22] now he's got a reason
[1:13:24] in telling you who you are he's got a
[1:13:26] reason in a prophet saying
[1:13:28] this is what has happened he's got a
[1:13:31] reasoning behind it and he said now
[1:13:33] he said when he said somebody caught
[1:13:35] that woman and she started to faint
[1:13:37] he said but when she came to her blind
[1:13:40] eye was normal
[1:13:41] her back she could move it anyway her
[1:13:44] arthritis was fine and
[1:13:46] she can move her back anyway just
[1:13:47] perfectly something
[1:13:49] had happened what was it there a prophet
[1:13:53] was breaking into a channel of the
[1:13:55] unseen world
[1:13:57] and bringing it to a scene world and the
[1:13:59] results
[1:14:00] happened because a supernatural god was
[1:14:03] standing
[1:14:04] right there he said the only thing that
[1:14:09] this has done
[1:14:10] he said and this supernatural has
[1:14:12] awakened ministers
[1:14:14] out of the sense bound around into a
[1:14:17] place
[1:14:17] where they can see god is present
[1:14:21] it has awakened ministers out of a
[1:14:24] sense-bound realm
[1:14:26] this realm right here it's awakened
[1:14:28] ministers
[1:14:29] to see that god is present now brother
[1:14:32] branham said now
[1:14:33] the vision don't heal you it just
[1:14:36] vindicates that his presence is near
[1:14:40] i can see a vision over top of you
[1:14:42] tonight but it ain't gonna heal you
[1:14:44] but it'll tell you that his presence is
[1:14:47] near
[1:14:48] [Applause]
[1:14:52] hallelujah many of you don't know what
[1:14:54] happened here last weekend but there was
[1:14:56] a little boy
[1:14:57] that was having a little bit of trouble
[1:14:59] standing up on his own and getting his
[1:15:01] feet underneath of him hadn't really
[1:15:02] made much movement
[1:15:03] on walking but there was a vision there
[1:15:05] was a vision and spoken if you'd only
[1:15:07] realize
[1:15:08] what has happened this week sister
[1:15:10] gabrielle could testify to it
[1:15:12] what has happened to that little baby
[1:15:14] this week
[1:15:15] you would realize that the presence of
[1:15:17] the living god
[1:15:18] is ever near
[1:15:22] who did that who did that
[1:15:27] brother ron didn't do that the minister
[1:15:29] didn't do that
[1:15:30] it was only showing that the presence of
[1:15:33] the living god
[1:15:34] is here now i want you to know i can
[1:15:36] tell you
[1:15:37] that the vision of the lord god has said
[1:15:40] that you're going to be there
[1:15:42] i can tell you that your future is clear
[1:15:45] i can tell you can look into the word of
[1:15:47] god
[1:15:47] and i can tell you by the word of truth
[1:15:49] that you're going to be
[1:15:50] there but it ain't gonna do me one bit
[1:15:52] of good to tell you that if you ain't
[1:15:54] gonna believe it
[1:15:55] but if you'll believe it if you'll
[1:15:57] believe it
[1:15:58] it'll put you there if you'll believe it
[1:16:01] your body will get healed if you'll
[1:16:03] believe it your loved one will be there
[1:16:06] if you believe it god ain't looking for
[1:16:09] unbelievers
[1:16:10] because unbelievers can't walk where the
[1:16:12] lord walks but he's looking for
[1:16:14] real rugged men sons daughters of god
[1:16:18] that ain't scared to stand toe-to-toe
[1:16:20] with the devil
[1:16:21] right in the midst of laodicea when hell
[1:16:24] seems to be on a fury
[1:16:25] there is a real people called by his
[1:16:28] name
[1:16:29] that ain't ashamed to stand up for god
[1:16:38] you know what it's like being in this
[1:16:41] presence
[1:16:46] and the realities of god
[1:16:49] become realities of you
[1:16:53] brother and would preach a sermon called
[1:16:55] the unfailing realities of god
[1:16:59] but you know what it's like to be
[1:17:00] standing in this presence
[1:17:02] and the power of his presence comes and
[1:17:04] he begins to woo to you
[1:17:06] it begins to call to you you begin to
[1:17:09] make love with him
[1:17:12] and all of a sudden you begin to see a
[1:17:13] great move of the holy ghost
[1:17:16] sometimes when he moves he moves with a
[1:17:19] great shout
[1:17:21] sometimes when he moves there's a holy
[1:17:22] hush on the people
[1:17:24] sometimes he'll move in this place he'll
[1:17:27] begin to move in this place and you'll
[1:17:28] begin to see wherever you are
[1:17:31] when the presence of god you'll begin to
[1:17:32] see a milky a milky film that begin to
[1:17:35] set over the top of the crowd
[1:17:37] and that cloud just seems to come down
[1:17:39] over top of the people
[1:17:40] when you begin to see the move of the
[1:17:42] holy spirit what you're watching is that
[1:17:45] god has settled down over top of his
[1:17:47] children
[1:17:48] and that god is about to do something
[1:17:50] and you're getting ready to watch the
[1:17:52] invisible
[1:17:53] made visible and when you begin to
[1:17:55] recognize his presence you see you see
[1:17:58] it's one thing if you recognize me
[1:18:00] it's one thing if you recognize brother
[1:18:02] ron but if you recognize him
[1:18:05] it will release a power to your
[1:18:06] situation are you with me when the woman
[1:18:09] in the bible recognize
[1:18:11] that the son of god was coming by her
[1:18:13] way
[1:18:14] she she called out said lord lord
[1:18:17] even even the master gets the the
[1:18:21] the children get to eat of the bread
[1:18:23] that falls off the masters table
[1:18:25] and she began to talk to him he didn't
[1:18:27] move one time
[1:18:28] when she called him the son of david but
[1:18:30] when she called him
[1:18:32] her lord then his attention
[1:18:35] got turned over to the situation because
[1:18:38] she recognized
[1:18:40] that this was him and if you could
[1:18:43] recognize
[1:18:44] that you are in the presence of jehovah
[1:18:47] it will release a power
[1:18:48] over your situation if you'll begin to
[1:18:52] recognize that he's moving in this place
[1:18:54] like he's never moved because god when
[1:18:56] god moves he's got a purpose in his
[1:18:58] movement
[1:18:59] god don't move just to move he don't
[1:19:01] move just for a show he don't move just
[1:19:03] for an act but when he moves
[1:19:04] brother adam said his children move with
[1:19:06] him and if you're ashamed to move on
[1:19:08] with god
[1:19:09] god will leave you right where you're at
[1:19:11] but in the spirit of the living god
[1:19:13] moves his children move with it and if
[1:19:16] you're willing to move this morning
[1:19:18] willing to move this evening if you're
[1:19:21] willing to get out of your
[1:19:22] cold dead cold formal religion
[1:19:25] if you're willing to move out of the
[1:19:27] things that's held your bounds
[1:19:29] if you're willing to move
[1:19:36] you're willing to move
[1:19:39] you'll begin to recognize this is him
[1:19:42] you'll watch things start trans
[1:19:44] transplant transforming in front of your
[1:19:46] life unfolding and things will begin to
[1:19:48] be made manifest in front of you last
[1:19:51] weekend
[1:19:53] last weekend brother malachi come up
[1:19:55] here and he was sitting he was sitting
[1:19:56] here to play he was sitting he came up
[1:19:58] here and sings
[1:19:59] and before he got up here and singing he
[1:20:01] was sitting down and he was reading his
[1:20:02] bible like a real christian does before
[1:20:04] church and he's sitting down there and
[1:20:05] reading his bible and somebody sat down
[1:20:07] beside him
[1:20:08] it wasn't gabriel it was the angel of
[1:20:11] the lord
[1:20:13] he hit gabriel and said hey he just sat
[1:20:16] down here beside me
[1:20:17] if you could only realize that he's
[1:20:20] wanting to sit down beside you
[1:20:22] and just begin to talk it over with you
[1:20:24] this evening
[1:20:25] all your burdens will be gone if you can
[1:20:28] just talk it over
[1:20:29] with jesus it's a real paradox to the
[1:20:32] world today
[1:20:33] that people actually believe what the
[1:20:36] bible says
[1:20:37] and then they live out what the bible
[1:20:38] says
[1:20:40] it's a paradox they can't understand how
[1:20:42] in the world you dress like that
[1:20:44] how you act like that how you talk like
[1:20:46] that how you walk like that it's a
[1:20:48] paradox
[1:20:49] but it's true and i want to say to you
[1:20:52] that i have proof
[1:20:53] that the pillar of fire is right here in
[1:20:55] our midst tonight
[1:20:56] it ain't a manifestation of a of a tumor
[1:20:59] leaving it ain't a manifestation of
[1:21:01] cancer leaving
[1:21:02] though that could be possible but yet i
[1:21:04] want to prove to you
[1:21:05] that the pillar of fire is back in the
[1:21:07] church of the living god
[1:21:10] when we see a young people standing up
[1:21:12] and saying hey
[1:21:13] i'm sick and tired i'm sick and tired of
[1:21:16] this depression spirit
[1:21:17] i'm sick and tired of this layout of
[1:21:19] seeing flu that makes me cold and formal
[1:21:22] and grabbing hold of my life when young
[1:21:24] people
[1:21:25] now you that's been sitting here for
[1:21:27] years and years and years it's an
[1:21:28] amazing thing for you to still be
[1:21:30] sitting here
[1:21:30] but when church of the living god when
[1:21:33] your young people
[1:21:34] is sitting in a place when there is 10
[1:21:37] times more demons
[1:21:38] that are out after your young people
[1:21:40] it's a proof
[1:21:41] that the pillar of fire is right here in
[1:21:43] our midst because a young people
[1:21:45] start casting down imaginations
[1:21:49] and they start living what this word is
[1:21:52] and say hey i'm sick and tired of this
[1:21:54] i'm sick and tired of living this way
[1:21:56] let me have the holy ghost
[1:21:57] let me have the blessings of god let the
[1:22:00] joy of the lord fill my soul
[1:22:02] when the world wants a social gospel
[1:22:04] where they can come and go and say
[1:22:05] please
[1:22:06] there's a young people there's a young
[1:22:09] people
[1:22:10] that still believe in this old-fashioned
[1:22:13] gospel
[1:22:18] there's a young people say give me you
[1:22:24] he's here amongst us i don't believe
[1:22:27] that he ought to allow it to become
[1:22:29] common to us
[1:22:33] he's here
[1:22:36] you see when people begin to let things
[1:22:38] become common to them
[1:22:40] that's when they start missing what he's
[1:22:42] doing
[1:22:43] but we should never take it for granted
[1:22:46] that he moves in a service like yes
[1:22:52] i've seen him move over top of a
[1:22:54] situation standing right here in
[1:22:55] surfaces like this
[1:22:57] and the holy ghost began to dissolve
[1:22:59] tumors
[1:23:00] in a sermon like this i was in a i was
[1:23:03] in a meeting one time
[1:23:04] i was in a meeting one time down in
[1:23:06] south carolina and there was a brother
[1:23:08] that was facing
[1:23:09] impossible impossible circumstances in a
[1:23:12] human realm
[1:23:13] and they and their the voice of god
[1:23:16] began to speak over him
[1:23:18] and says now there's a light over top of
[1:23:20] you and i heard the man of god saying
[1:23:22] i don't know what your problems are but
[1:23:25] god does and that man
[1:23:27] that was a great man began slain in a
[1:23:29] spirit because the purifier
[1:23:31] was present i was one time in a meeting
[1:23:34] down in murfreesboro tennessee
[1:23:36] down in a banquet and it was kind of a
[1:23:38] odd setting but then
[1:23:41] by meaning it was an odd setting because
[1:23:43] there became a a prayer line or an altar
[1:23:45] call out a banquet most time at a
[1:23:47] banquet
[1:23:47] and most time in the banquet you're
[1:23:49] introducing somebody in christ and
[1:23:50] they're
[1:23:51] here at a banquet they begin to have a
[1:23:52] prayer line
[1:23:54] and there's these young people begin to
[1:23:56] make a half moon
[1:23:57] and they begin to gather around they
[1:23:59] just kind of made their own alter
[1:24:01] and it was inside of an old barn that
[1:24:03] they'd turn into a place a beautiful
[1:24:05] place turn it into a banquet
[1:24:07] i will tell you god i'll meet you in a
[1:24:08] barn he'll meet you in the car
[1:24:10] he'll meet you in the church he'll meet
[1:24:12] you in your bedroom
[1:24:13] he'll meet you in your house and there
[1:24:16] in that in that barn
[1:24:17] where we was having that banquet and
[1:24:19] young people just like you got sitting
[1:24:21] right here
[1:24:21] they began to gather around and the
[1:24:23] spirit of the living god began to call
[1:24:25] out situations
[1:24:26] and call out certain needs and all of a
[1:24:28] sudden there was a sister that was
[1:24:30] fighting depression
[1:24:31] and a suicidal spirit and the sooner the
[1:24:33] spirit of the living god called out that
[1:24:35] thing
[1:24:36] a pillar of fire the pillar of fire
[1:24:38] stepped out over top of that little
[1:24:39] daughter
[1:24:40] and come running right down behind me
[1:24:42] and went over behind
[1:24:44] sister sister harmon and brother
[1:24:46] joseph's wife
[1:24:47] and the purifier come down and rolled
[1:24:48] through that place and that girl left
[1:24:51] there delivered
[1:24:52] he was proving that the pillar fire is
[1:24:54] greater than suicide
[1:24:56] and i want to say to you that the pillar
[1:24:58] of fire is still greater than suicide
[1:25:01] he's greater than anxiety he's greater
[1:25:03] than depression he's greater than cancer
[1:25:06] [Applause]
[1:25:09] i was praying with a young boy one time
[1:25:10] down in north carolina
[1:25:14] i'm using these illustrations or the
[1:25:16] events so i don't have to call out your
[1:25:18] situation
[1:25:19] i was praying for this young boy one
[1:25:21] time down in north carolina
[1:25:23] hey come up he come up after i had an
[1:25:25] altar call
[1:25:26] this young boy come up and there was a
[1:25:28] witchcraft spirit upon him and a
[1:25:30] rebellion spirit
[1:25:31] and all of a sudden the spirit of god
[1:25:33] began to speak directly to him and call
[1:25:34] out certain things that only he would
[1:25:36] know about and i watched
[1:25:42] as that light as that light began to
[1:25:44] move and there began to be an opening
[1:25:47] for an opening for the spirit of god to
[1:25:49] move in but then i watched the darkness
[1:25:52] the darkness of that witchcraft spirit
[1:25:54] began to try to threads
[1:25:56] thrush out and push out the spirit of
[1:25:58] god and because that young boy
[1:26:01] didn't accept the liberty of christ he
[1:26:04] walked away
[1:26:05] with that witchcraft spirit upon him i'm
[1:26:08] only telling you this
[1:26:10] that it's all what you accept here
[1:26:12] tonight
[1:26:13] you can walk away completely delivered
[1:26:15] you can walk away
[1:26:16] all the answers of the message
[1:26:18] completely settled in your life
[1:26:20] you can walk away but it depends on what
[1:26:22] you give yourself to
[1:26:24] now you can turn on a tv and you can
[1:26:27] push a button
[1:26:28] and you can bring it into a certain
[1:26:29] channel but before it ever got on that
[1:26:31] channel
[1:26:32] it had to fly through an airwave and
[1:26:34] that channel is tapped in in such a way
[1:26:37] that it brings it down so you can see it
[1:26:39] now i want to break into a world
[1:26:41] and bring it down where you can see it
[1:26:43] that by his stripes
[1:26:45] you are healed
[1:26:51] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[1:26:53] set with me
[1:26:54] in my throne if you can see it there's a
[1:26:57] channel open for you to walk into

[1:28:55] that's filled with the spirit of
[1:28:56] almighty god walk with god
[1:29:00] you can read over in the book of jude
[1:29:02] verse 14 and you
[1:29:03] see that enoch was the seventh from adam
[1:29:07] and he prophesied of these same behold
[1:29:09] the lord
[1:29:10] cometh with ten thousand other saints
[1:29:13] the things that you're living out enoch
[1:29:15] prophesied
[1:29:17] the things that you're seeing enoch
[1:29:19] prophesied he prophesied of the day
[1:29:21] you're living in
[1:29:22] he prophesied that carnal men were
[1:29:24] satisfied
[1:29:25] with their condition that they were
[1:29:27] living in he was there preaching to them
[1:29:30] a message that took it back to eden
[1:29:33] you see when when enoch was walking on
[1:29:36] the earth
[1:29:36] he was walking on the earth 57 years he
[1:29:40] walked on the earth with adam
[1:29:41] and he was living amongst the people
[1:29:44] that were doomed
[1:29:45] for destruction but he was walking with
[1:29:47] god
[1:29:48] he would talk to adam he began to talk
[1:29:50] to him and adam could
[1:29:52] reverse and and converse back to him and
[1:29:54] tell him that i controlled nature
[1:29:56] i was able to move things for eve i was
[1:29:58] able to speak to the wind
[1:30:00] and the wind would listen to me i could
[1:30:02] speak to storms
[1:30:03] and they would move out of the place
[1:30:06] and enoch as he testified as he walked
[1:30:10] as he fellowship with adam he began to
[1:30:12] talk to him about what it was like down
[1:30:14] there
[1:30:15] and when he got all of adam's testimony
[1:30:18] enoch began to preach and he began to
[1:30:21] preach
[1:30:21] that there is a perfect eating that was
[1:30:23] coming
[1:30:25] he walked with god every single day he
[1:30:27] walked for god for 365 years
[1:30:30] in constant fellowship with that eden
[1:30:32] realm
[1:30:35] kind of like you and i we're in constant
[1:30:37] fellowship with a realm
[1:30:38] that's not of laodicea layout to see it
[1:30:41] don't know what you're living in
[1:30:42] and they ought to see it don't know what
[1:30:44] you're believing in but you are living
[1:30:46] in a world just like enoch was living in
[1:30:49] he was walking with doomed people that
[1:30:51] were on their road to destruction
[1:30:54] and here you are right here in laodicea
[1:30:57] walking with people that are headed for
[1:30:58] the tribulation
[1:31:00] you're walking with people that are
[1:31:01] headed for judgment but you are walking
[1:31:03] with the son of man and a son of man and
[1:31:06] gonna leave you here
[1:31:08] he knows exactly where you're at he
[1:31:10] knocked where he lived
[1:31:11] and walked so close to god that god
[1:31:14] could not deny him the rapture
[1:31:17] i want to say to you that you're living
[1:31:19] so close to god
[1:31:21] you're walking so much with god that god
[1:31:24] cannot deny you the rapture
[1:31:26] [Applause]
[1:31:29] the bible said that enoch walked and he
[1:31:31] was not
[1:31:33] the bible said in hebrews 11 that by
[1:31:34] faith enoch was translated
[1:31:36] that he should not see death and was not
[1:31:39] found because god
[1:31:41] had translated him but before his
[1:31:44] translation
[1:31:45] he had this testimony that he pleased
[1:31:48] god
[1:31:49] i wonder if there's anybody that can
[1:31:51] have a testimony
[1:31:52] that you're pleasing to god now if you
[1:31:55] go to studying out enoch's name
[1:31:57] enoch's name means dedicated and if
[1:31:59] you're not dedicated to the cause
[1:32:01] you'll never walk with god if you're not
[1:32:03] dedicated to this message
[1:32:05] this message will come by your way but
[1:32:07] if you're dedicated
[1:32:09] you can walk with god you can talk with
[1:32:11] god
[1:32:12] you can live with god this message will
[1:32:14] fill you
[1:32:15] all in all it won't be jesus's word but
[1:32:18] it'll be your word and jesus said if you
[1:32:20] abide in me
[1:32:21] and my words abide in you ask what you
[1:32:24] will
[1:32:25] and it shall be done unto you
[1:32:29] as enoch begins to walk he said hey i'm
[1:32:32] the seventh from adam
[1:32:34] and i'm typing a people that are seven
[1:32:36] from adam i'm gonna walk
[1:32:38] until god takes me and it's going to be
[1:32:40] a type of a people
[1:32:42] that they're going to walk with god
[1:32:43] they're going to talk with god
[1:32:45] and one of these mornings between the
[1:32:47] hours and six and nine
[1:32:48] god is going to snatch up his children
[1:32:53] when the spirit of the lord falls upon
[1:32:56] my heart
[1:32:57] i will walk like he not walked
[1:33:02] every day he was walking he didn't
[1:33:05] settle for a halfway walk
[1:33:07] maybe one day he began to run because he
[1:33:09] realized that it was getting a little
[1:33:11] closer to the gate
[1:33:12] i say i'm running i'm running my last my
[1:33:15] home
[1:33:19] hallelujah right here in the midst of
[1:33:21] layout i see
[1:33:22] there's a people that's walking they're
[1:33:25] dedicated
[1:33:26] they're dedicated to this message
[1:33:29] enoch's family didn't hinder him
[1:33:34] enoch's children didn't hinder his walk
[1:33:39] and neither will it hinder my walk
[1:33:42] and it better not hinder your walk your

[1:44:16] that you can't figure out
[1:44:18] and he's here to beat down the
[1:44:19] depression that's trying to beat you

[1:44:21] and he says let them go
[1:44:24] [Applause]
[1:44:26] yes there was a mama praying yes there
[1:44:29] was a daddy praying
[1:44:30] but on the other side of that prayer
[1:44:32] came of moses
[1:44:34] [Applause]
[1:44:34] [Music]
[1:44:37] i'm going to tell you mamas and daddies
[1:44:38] don't you give up
[1:44:40] there's a moses on the other side of
[1:44:42] your prayer
[1:44:44] i want to tell you there's angels that
[1:44:45] are watching over your children
[1:44:47] i'm not just talking about prodigals i'm
[1:44:49] talking about the ones that are sitting
[1:44:51] in here
[1:44:51] full of the holy ghost
[1:44:54] there are angels that are here with
[1:44:57] marching orders
[1:44:58] to make sure you make it home tonight
[1:45:00] and make sure you get back to church
[1:45:02] tomorrow
[1:45:02] they're here watching over you and when
[1:45:05] shaken tries to make you fall in
[1:45:06] temptation
[1:45:07] god says back up that's not for you
[1:45:18] god has so designed this hour
[1:45:26] that he knows every nook and cranny of
[1:45:29] laodicea
[1:45:32] he knows every spot and he knows every
[1:45:33] temptation is coming by your way
[1:45:35] and i want to tell you god is greater
[1:45:37] than your temptation
[1:45:40] god's greater than your lust god's
[1:45:43] greater than your own fleshly desire
[1:45:45] he's greater than all of that and paul
[1:45:48] says over in titus chapter 2 he said
[1:45:51] in this present world that we are to
[1:45:53] deny
[1:45:54] these things we are to deny all the
[1:45:57] lustly flesh we are to deny
[1:45:58] all of these things that come up against
[1:46:00] us in this present world
[1:46:02] right here in this world you're living
[1:46:03] in you can deny the things
[1:46:05] that are not of god i want to tell you
[1:46:08] church
[1:46:09] you can overcome it because there's an
[1:46:11] overcomer here
[1:46:13] and the mighty conqueror is standing
[1:46:15] right
[1:46:16] here god had his best down there in
[1:46:20] egypt
[1:46:22] and moses got him out of it because he
[1:46:24] was born a deliverer
[1:46:25] god had his best when he walked when
[1:46:27] there was a little boy that walked down
[1:46:29] into the valley of elah
[1:46:30] that he looked like he was a 12 year old
[1:46:32] ruddy boy but what he was was more than
[1:46:34] a conqueror
[1:46:35] he was a champion because he was
[1:46:36] anointed god had his best when he had
[1:46:38] david down there
[1:46:39] after goliath god had his best when
[1:46:42] there was a man
[1:46:43] that was thrown into a lion's den by the
[1:46:45] name of daniel and daniel come out on
[1:46:47] the other side and said i told you king
[1:46:49] i was going to see you in the morning
[1:46:51] here i am
[1:46:52] god had his best down in the lion's den
[1:46:55] god had his best when the three hebrew
[1:46:58] children went into a fiery furnace and
[1:47:00] they didn't even have a stench of lay
[1:47:02] odyssey upon them
[1:47:04] the only thing that laodicea did when
[1:47:06] the flames of layout i see it comes from
[1:47:08] come against them it only loosed the
[1:47:10] bands that was upon them
[1:47:13] laosea can do all it wants to it's just
[1:47:16] making me more rapture ready
[1:47:19] let me tell you let me go a little bit
[1:47:21] further god had
[1:47:23] had his best when he had jesus on the
[1:47:25] scene
[1:47:28] now to me jesus looked real good
[1:47:31] when he healed the widow of name and son
[1:47:33] jesus looked real good
[1:47:35] he looked real good when he raised
[1:47:37] lazarus from the dead he looked real
[1:47:39] good when he healed blind bartimaeus but
[1:47:42] he looked his best
[1:47:43] when he's climbing up calvary's hill
[1:47:45] [Applause]
[1:47:47] and i want to go a little bit further
[1:47:49] god had his best when paul was there
[1:47:51] god had his best when wesley was there
[1:47:54] god had his best when luther was there
[1:47:56] god had his best when william branham
[1:47:57] was there and
[1:47:59] god has his best in the body of jesus
[1:48:02] christ
[1:48:03] god is determined and dedicated to put
[1:48:06] his best runners in
[1:48:08] to finish the last course
[1:48:12] go ahead i'm the best that god's got
[1:48:17] say it with a little attitude i'm the
[1:48:20] best
[1:48:21] that god's got i'm the best young person
[1:48:24] i'm the best worshiper you can get
[1:48:28] offended if you want to
[1:48:30] i'm the best because god saw me
[1:48:33] before the foundation of the world
[1:48:38] ah brother andrew he likes to brag about
[1:48:40] himself
[1:48:42] no i don't but i do like bragging on my
[1:48:46] jesus
[1:48:47] i ain't got a whole lot of muscles all
[1:48:49] them was given to my big brother matthew
[1:48:53] but there's a god that's being on the
[1:48:57] path
[1:48:57] that's packed on the inside of my soul
[1:49:01] that's a whole lot bigger than layout i

[1:49:07] you know how brothers do i'm closing you
[1:49:10] know how brothers do they
[1:49:12] they fool around one another
[1:49:15] i say these things because i know i'm
[1:49:17] not stupid enough to do it
[1:49:20] i look at matthew every once in a while
[1:49:22] joking joking
[1:49:23] before joking i said matthew what'd you
[1:49:26] do if i just reach over and punch you
[1:49:28] right in the face
[1:49:30] he said well you probably knocked me out
[1:49:34] he said but when i come too you better
