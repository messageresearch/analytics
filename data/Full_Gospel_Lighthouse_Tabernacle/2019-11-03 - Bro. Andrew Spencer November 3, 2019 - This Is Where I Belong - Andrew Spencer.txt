this portion a quote in this evening from the Ephesian Church age it is his life that is flowing and pulsating in the church giving her life and without him there would be no life salvation is of the Lord there was no one with him when he tried the fierceness of the wrath of the fiery furnace it was not another but him who hung upon the cross and gave his blood he is the author and the finisher of our faith he is the Alpha and Omega of our salvation we are espoused to him and not another we don't belong to the church we belong to him his word is law creeds dogmas by laws and constitutions have no effect on us yes it is Jesus alone who walks in the midst of the churches it is God in her willing and doing of his good pleasure never forget that you have only one relationship to God and God has only one relationship to you that is Jesus and Jesus alone he's walking in the midst of the church he's telling you that he will never leave you and that he'll never forsake you sums 47 and verse 1 o

and and lift up the praises to the God that is worthy of all things Lord I believe that you have come down to do extreme and special things here this evening Lord we're just see we're just a part of it we're glad to be a part of these things that you're doing in this hour in this day and Lord we don't want to take it for granted that you have allowed us to come into the house of the Lord Lord before we know that there are those that are suffering persecution that are not able to be in the house of God Lord to stand with this truth Lord Lord it bears a reproach but Lord may we may we gladly bear the reproach of Christ father may we stand and never be ashamed of this gospel lord I pray that those that are listening by the way of the open airwaves listening through the live stream I pray you bless them Lord I pray you minister to them that could not be in the house of God those that are those that are sick and afflicted and shut-in tonight we pray a supernatural blessing upon them may they feel the anointing quite as strong here in their room as we feel it here tonight Lord I pray that you would just go by their way Lord I pray you forgive us of our sins our mistakes our failures

not brother on but the Matthews are traveling up the road I pray the angel the Lord would lead them up the highway so God put a hand of protection around them Jesus we're here and we are we are a signing for duty tonight we're stepping into the road that you called us to you know our position now you have the preeminence in the name of Jesus Christ and the Bride of Christ says a man a man may God bless you you may be seated in the presence of the Lord this is where we belong I hope you don't mind I hope you don't mind me speaking these things that's where God continues to bless us at and lead us to and I believe we found our our spot in life that we belong and I believe that's where we should stay is in the spot that God blesses us and the Bible said in Psalms 47 and for that he shall choose our inheritance for us he has he shows in the place that we belong in and this is the land of our inheritance this this gospel that we preach this is the land of our inheritance and it's God's will for us to inhabit the promises of God not for us to leave them sitting on our coffee table and and sitting there on our on our bar and sitting there at our house it is our job and our duty to feed on this word to take the little book eat that little book become the little book it's God's will that we inhabit these promises and and he is not a God that keeps things to himself but he's a good God he's a God that knows how to give good gifts you see we know how to give good gifts and Jesus said howbeit that you being evil know how to give good gifts how much more about your heavenly Father how much more said he give you those good things and those things that you asked of tonight I believe tonight I want to start this out with a challenge I believe tonight that that you can have what if so ever you ask in the name of Jesus tonight I I told you I was coming tonight and I was going to blow hails doors off with what I've got to say and so by the help of the Lord tonight I want to preach to you on on where we belong that this is our land and if God gave us this land we should do everything within our power to protect this land to keep this land to defend this land he's a good God he's given us the very best that he could absolutely give when he gave us the word he didn't give us some week he didn't give us some week weapon he gave us the greatest weapon that's ever been placed in the hand of humans in your hand tonight the Moses had a rod in his hand but in your hand tonight is a living word in your hand tonight is a sharp two-edged sword and when you remember in sabino canyon when a Kings sword came down he was not a king sword it was the King's sword and it didn't come down with a Seif upon it he came down ready to go to battle and you are the people of the open book you're the people of the land you're the people of the King's sword and learn a word where the Kings word is there is power I say to you tonight by the power of Almighty God the Kings word is in this place the word of the Lord is in this place the king of kings is in this place there's power here tonight hallelujah God has given us everything that we have need of in our journey when he gave us the baptism of the Holy Ghost everything you have need of he gave it to you right there you see he brought us to a land of promise he didn't bring us through a land of lies in a land of imagination he brought us to a land of promise and you know there's 88 hundred promises in the Bible from God eighty eight hundred promises from God and you know every single time God had kept his word eighty eight hundred times God kept his work the devil made nine promises in the Bible and nine times the devil lot it shows you that I'm on the Lord's side tonight because I'm taking the side of 8,800 promises tonight I want you to know that what I'm preaching to you is a God that cannot fail a God that cannot lie a God that will not back up on his word 8,800 promises in the ministry of william branham there was 80 380 visions that took place that you can hear on tape 80 380 visions that were told to you and I what is this it is telling us that the god of heavens is speaking to us people said well I don't I haven't heard from God in a while pick up your Bible pick up your Bible every time I don't care if it's one scripture you just read the word of Almighty God hallelujah we are in the land of promise and these promises are lifting us higher they're not degrading us they're not beating us down they're not telling us that we're not worthy but in the contrary they're telling us that we are worthy that he thought a whole lot of us he thought that we are a value there is the promises of God or lifting us higher they're not like Satan that degrade Assad's degrades us and beats us back and forth but the promises of God are you a man but as our scripture reading has told us that we belong in the land of triumph we don't belong in the land of defeat God know what you dealing and belonging in the land of sickness he know what you're living in the land of misery he what you're living in a good land he wants you living in a land that's overflowing it's flowing with milk and honey it sounds like a sticky place but you just stick right with this word it's a land that's flowing with the promises of God are you with me tonight you know what you're living in a land of sickness a land of home oh I learned the trouble he wants you living in a lay of health are you with me he wants you to be successful in your soul he wants you to be successful with your body in your mind when you go to work he wants you to be successful he wants you to be blessed when you come here bless when you go out blessed in your storehouses blessed in your basket he said he make you the head and not the tail he said he put you above and not beneath that's the dog we don't belong in the land of curses we belong in the land of blessings hallelujah we belong in the land of triumph the Bible says God Enki God has grown up with a shout and a shout of triumph you know that victory and trial for two different things you see God don't want you shouting with a voice of misery you know you have the allow you have the ability and the power to be able to speak to be able to speak things into existence and what you let it go out of your lips is what you will see made manifest I'm not talking about just power mind over matter and the power of speech but I'm talking about speaking God's work you know if you speak if you speak doubt you're gonna live in doubt if you speak fear you're gonna live in fear you know where you're speaking from you know in your own life where you're speaking from maybe you're a husband maybe your mother and you know how you're speaking to your children and sometimes maybe you maybe you corrected your children in the wrong atmosphere and the wrong spirit you corrected them in anger when you didn't do it in love and your voice was a voice of anger instead of a voice of love but I found that the voice of God is a corrective voice it's a voice that wants you to live right it's a voice that wants you to overcome it's a voice that will lift you higher and if you start speaking like the world that you came from I believe that we ought to shout I believe we are the dance but it should be a dance of triumph it should be a shout of triumph all right we're going to speak from a voice and that voice is going to come out as a voice of triumph but victory and triumph or two different things you see victory is when you win the battle but triumph is the celebration of victory you see triumph is win the roman army that would come in after they had went out and they'd fought the battle when they would come in after their victory the roman armies would come in and they would have a show of the spoils of the victory and they would parade around the city and they would display the glory in the power of their kingdom that they had won this battle they would go through there in a triumphal parade they would go down there knowing that they won the victory but victory is when you win the battle and triumph is a celebration it's a celebration I wanted to declare to you tonight that tonight is the night of celebration you've been defeated you've been in a battle take a look around you got some scars you've been in a barrel but tonight's the night of celebration tonight is not the night of defeat tonight is not the night where you still fight in the battle tonight is the night of triumph tonight is the night when you go through the city and you take the lives head and you drag it behind you and said this is what I overcome this is what I defeated I want you to call your demons out into the street tonight and take a double-barrel shotgun and blow the devil's head off tonight have a celebration and a shout not a shadow mystery not a shout adapt hallelujah shout of triumph every praise is to our God the night is the night of celebration he made you a promise that he'd be with you and in you to the end of the world tonight's a night of celebration we're talking about brother Ralph's going home you're talking about a size celebration you think we're having a celebration here but over on that side a precious ruby has made it over they are in triumph brother Ralph won the victory I'm sure brother lanes got the banjo in his hand I'm sorry brother homer singing it sound and dancin I wonder my converse made it on the other side tonight's the night of celebration rod you will not go down in defeat who there's a greater Kingdom than Rome here this is a kingdom of God you're in the winner's circle you can't see it maybe but you're in it you know the Bible says in 2nd Corinthians 2 and 14 thanks be to God which always not sometimes not maybe but always causes us to triumph in Christ but to have a celebration you got to have a victory and have a victory you got to have a battle so tonight is the night of celebration tonight's the night of celebration we're going to do battle here tonight I told you I was coming come on some bye I told you I was coming and all heavens coming with me Hey I want you to know we're here to do business tonight we're here to do business tonight tonight's the night of celebration I'm speaking it I'm walking into it this is my land you promised me that I would have it I'm going to have it tonight Oh hallelujah they count backwards in NASA ten nine eight all the way down to one but we can upwards we're in the seventh seventh day we're ready for takeoff tonight's a night of celebration you may go through a battle all week long throughout your mine you've been battling all week long but tonight the battle will be finished the victory will be one and you will

sanity we are fight for our peace fight for our joy fight for our love fight for the Holy Ghost fight for our family they were fighting for and I'm willing to fight with you I'm the kinda guy that you call when you need to go into battle when you need nobody I'm not just talking about somebody that's scared to get their hands dirty I'm talking about the guy that's able to take the gloves off I'm the guy to Clos and it comes to that type of job and I come to do business tonight is there anybody else that's willing to go in the battle with me let's bring back the spoils tonight [Applause] hello I'm nice tonight let's get to work so we look at the children of Israel that they knew that this land belong to them the promise belongs to them and they could look at through the eyes of faith and say that's where we belong when everybody else was saying that they wouldn't didn't want to go over there there was a Joshua that rose up and a Caleb that rose up that was a type of the true believers in Christ Jesus they rose up no matter the critics that tried to keep them off of the land you talk about a journey that they had to go through they had to go and they had to look at the red sea they had to go and look at the Jordan and God opened up the Red Sea and open up the Jordan because there was a land that belonged to them on the other side of it they had to go through the struggles they had to go through the critics they had to go through the obstacles of faced and for listings and Giants and critics but they were people that was destined to take the land the Bible says in numbers 33 and 52 drive out the inhabitants and the Lord speaking to Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho saying speaking to the children of Israel and saying to them when you're passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land you ain't got to go out and fight somebody else's battle but you got to fight your battles it's not about bowing out it's not about going out and fighting degrade the nominal Christians job and fighting their battles this is our battle this is where God destined us to you don't fight the battle out there you fight the battle in here then you should drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their pick destroy all their molten images and quite put down all their high places and ye shall dispossessed the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for I have given you the land who's saying this Jehovah Edel him Almighty God is saying this that I've given you this land to possess it it was their job to go and kick them off it was their job because the land was rightfully ours it was rightfully theirs and there were squatters on the land but you can kick a squatter off and a squatter will come back a squatter will try to live off for your experience and degrade your experience it's trying to tear it down and try to make you knock down to the devil but that's what a squatter is he'd try to steal your joy they try to steal your family he'll try to show you try to strip the land of all the nutrients of it but it's your job to fight to maintain that land to maintain the land job said that though God slay me yet I'm going to trust him and I will maintain my cause with him job said I know I've lived the right kind of life I've lived the right kind of life I have a destined these things I've I've proclaimed these things I've walked into these things but I will maintain my cause no matter what the critics were saying around hope he was maintaining his ways he was walking in his ways and God knows a way that we take tonight it's our job to fight to maintain God gave us this land and it's our job to guard the borders of this land you gotta guard the burdur borders of your new birth young people you got a guard you got a guard your dress you know you with me tonight you got a guard your experience you got a guard your speech young girls you got a guard your heart young boys you got a guard your heart mamas and daddies you got a guard your family God gave them to you he didn't give them to me gave me it's your job to guard for them it's your job to protect them hallelujah you got to do the job we must defend our god-given rights every promise in the book is mine we got to defend it we got a fight on our hands and we got to win the battle you know that we find that the scripture tells us that God has always had overcomers throughout every age in every age there's been over comers and God has always had one man that he could put his hand upon and he could say that's my man I can tell him what to do and he'll do exactly what I says he's doing there was a Moses there was an Abraham there was an Isaac and a Jacob and a Joseph that God could lay his hand upon then there rose up a Moses that he delay his head in the port and he would do exactly what God told him to do then there was a Joshua that rose up that God could place his hand upon him and said that's my servant I can tell him what to do and that's exactly what he'll do he won't waver what all the other people say around him and when Joshua came to the crisis of his ministry in Joshua chapter 10 when he had the enemy routed and he had him pushed back in a corner he needed a little bit more time to deal with his demons he needed a little bit more time so that he could destroy the enemy that was trying to keep them off of their belongings it was his job to go in there as a son of God to speak the things then right into existence and I want to say this to you tonight we want to say the right things we want to say the right things tonight had ear I could say the right thing about the save the Lord what about you and I tonight let's say the right thing tonight that's nothing but the truth and tell us why I was standing at this crisis where he needed a little bit more time to deal with the demons that were keeping him off of his land and he said son he didn't pray about it he didn't seek God about it but he said son stand still and moon thou hang there of the valley of a Jalan until I defeat my enemies tonight so night you need a little bit more time ask that the preacher preaches one more minute so that you defeats our enemies hallelujah but God said that I will give you the land I won't give you the land in one year but I'll give it to you little by little so the land won't overtake you come on somebody the land is just going to keep coming you keep walking into it but you can't walk out of it traveling out depression driving out nervousness traveling out out anxiety little by little walk into your land walk into your inheritance you were seen in the vision you were seen in the vision I can tell you I can tell you what to do to get in that vision but I can't move the Hat I can't move the hat everything's got to be in place I want you to know children the hats in place and the people are walking right in step we're in the vision we're in the vision we're in the safe the Lord and Satan cannot defeat let's say if the Lord try and stop us try and keep us off our land hallelujah it's nighttime just speak to the Esso in May the Esso in hangover your life tonight until you're completely delivered completely healed completely set free you belong in the land of healing you belong in the land of deliverance well let's just live right there I want to ask you what are you living out are you living in misery are you living in home or are you living in defeat what step out of that I've gotten testimonies out of these services that we've been speaking but the time heal sitting back there send me a note last weekend he said the Lord came by and touched my shoulder he said where else can he get that at he said this is where I belong at [Applause] sister Laura sent me word this morning only this morning and said the Lord of the Lord came to her and said Healing is where she belongs at Church of the Living God Healing is where you belong that you don't belong in the land of sickness I belong in the land of a living mercy hello I'm gonna be that man that God can put his hand upon they said that's my man that's my servant he'll do what I says do I believe that we're looking at the type of people that's overcomers that now is the time to go and pursue and overtake it I want to tell you that I hear the rustling of winds in the wind in the Leafs of the mulberry trees and it's time to go and take it it's time to go it's time to go and defeat the Philistines do you hear that I hear the abundance of rain coming get your rain barrels out tonight's the night of celebration Oh hallelujah it may look very small it may look like the size of a hand of a man there but I want you to know there's coming a cloud that's coming whoa hallelujah that's coming a cloud that's going to drop a Holy Spirit rain upon you tonight go ahead get your rain barrels out get your heart ready let your faith loose I know what I'm preaching tonight I'm preaching to your faith I'm preaching to your faith tonight and when faith is being preached healings got to take place I mean that's just as simple as it is so I know by the time that I get done with this service there is going to be healing coming forth from your lips faith will hear your body faith will raise you up hallelujah we belong right here and I don't plan on moving off of it try to push me around all you want to but I'm staying right here try to push me off my leg I'm under a Joshua Commission hallelujah I've looked over at the parallel I've looked over at the parallel over in Ephesians and it tells me that I was predestined to take it I was predestined living though I was dead I am now alive Oh hallelujah I may have not looked like I didn't belong in this land but I want you to know hallelujah this is my land it may have been sometimes in your pasture didn't look like that you were inhabitant of the land but I want you to tell you you're a part of the land [Music] you're a part of the promise do you believe that tonight I'm a part of the problems I'm a part of us say the lord who can't be defeated there this is my inheritance but you got to fight for it God didn't intend for you to be wore out God didn't intend for you to be slapped wore out and you can't come and you you come to the house of God and you sleep all the way through I believe it's been a shock for the bridegroom to wake us up maybe you still sleeping food but I want to tell you that he has descended and he's had a shout and a voice and a trumpet at all do all three things at one time hallelujah he's here he's here y'all didn't intend for you to be wore out and be unsure that's the enemy's job that's the enemy's job to make you feel unsure it's the enemy's job to make you feel now make you feel unconfident it's the enemy's job to make you feel that you're not healthy it's the enemy's job to strip away your immune system it's the enemy's job to make you not strong it's the enemy's job to make you disbelieve in your weapon or warfare and tell you and make you not confident in your weapon or warfare when our weapons are not carnal but mighty and pulling down the strongholds of God we are to cast down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the mind of God tonight cast it out cast out fear cast out doubt I wonder if there's anybody in here that knows what I'm talking about tonight that tonight's your night I want you to know that Jesus came the Bible said that Jesus came to destroy the works of the enemy and I want to tell you that Jesus is on your road like he was on the road to legions place I want you to know he's on your road and he's hunting for you he's heading for you tonight and he as good as his word he's coming hallelujah he's coming make ready Jesus is coming oh yeah tonight's the night you forgive me I already see the end but I'm trying to get you through the battle can I tell you something you're already seen in victory so while you're fighting right now I want you to fight with the mindset that you're a winner remember that the Bible said as we read in our scripture reading in Psalms 47 and 9 that the shields of the earth belong unto the Lord that means all of the weapons the shield and the weapons of warfare belong to the Lord that means the rulers of this earth belonging to the Lord there's nothing that can touch you and say unless you see God's got control of everything he's in control of every thing and there's not one evil spirit that can come in here and block you that God don't have control over tonight there's spirits that are flying around in here tonight to get you to disbelief but the lord of the lord to you and those spirits is we rebuke that devil those spirits can touch one hair of your head until God gets permission gives them permission we should never live below our god-given River juice we should go in there and possess everything that all that better day that is rightfully ours we should possess the gate of sickness possess the gate of death possess the gate of backsliding in I'm gonna need a quote I got one for you the biggest fault that I can find with any of the churches and expenses the real church that's born again they don't know who they are you don't realize what the privilege that God has given you your looking for something way off in some kind of a millennium but that's one that the devil's pulled over you the Bible says now are we sons of God not we will be we are now in every redemptive blessing that the Lord Jesus died for is our personal property right now everything that he died for not we will be we are now you're an heir you're an heir to the promise you're an heir to the land you're in a valley look you're an heir to the God of creation tonight when you leave normally when you leave you grab all of your belongings you grab your purse you grab your Bible you grab your sweater you

tonight I say Oh God go and lift up their faith now I know him raise him up higher lift him up higher you were going for the rapture you were born for the body change you were born for this message it belongs to you [Applause] Oh Moses said that we're not leaving a hook behind and the reason why he said we're not leaving a hook behind it's because it belonged to him you can hear the vision you can hear the prophet tell about the vision of the 42-inch caribou but there were certain things that were not maybe adding up in his own mind that he couldn't figure out well there's nobody here it ain't God there's nobody here that's got a green checkered shirt so it wasn't the time he thought in his mind but when he turned around and he looked at brother Eddie he said well brother Eddie I thought you didn't have a green checkered shirt he said brother branham I didn't think I did either but my wife packed this old shirt why did she pack that old shirt because it belonged in the vision Oh [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] it was to be there you're talking about anointing of God that God would so anoying a wife that which she wouldn't throw away assert that was a part of the vision I was seeing on the other side you can try to throw me away all you want to but I belong in the vision oh let the devil try to knock me down let him try to stop me I belong there I see what scene there our offspring was seen there they belong there let up come come hallelujah there's power that laziness truth tonight we're here we're giving witness we're giving witness to what the word can do there's a nose on your face because it belongs there there's an ear on your hair because it belongs there you're a part of this body but there was a sister one time that came to the Prophet that was holding a handkerchief over her nose you remember that story she was holding that handkerchief over nose he thought she said I thought she was weeping about something he said when she took the handkerchief away that nose was completely eaten off and the vibration said that it was cancer you see the demon was trying to rob something from the place that had belong that but the nose belongs back in that position that's where it was born to be a hurry with me and the Prophet bready and three months later three months later he seen a woman waving hadn't said do you remember me brother man do you remember me so no I don't really remember you remember how was the lady that had a nose that was eaten off but there was a new nose that was put in there and those belong there and that's what God gave her God didn't give her an ear to go on there or an eye to go there but a nose to go there because I nose belong there and God knows where the Sun air is supposed to be and he knows where the daughter is supposed to be and they'll be right there what happened the doctor couldn't explain it she told the doctor I just changed I just change doctors well who to go see doctor Jesus they belong in that position they belong in that spot go to doctor Jesus he heals all of your heart diseases he higher here's all of he hears and heals all of your problems you're built to take this land you're annoying its oppressor battle and I'm getting ready to drive something right smack into the eye of the devil I've been looking at this thing for the last month and I'm coming against Satan in the name of Jesus there's power in the name of Jesus we know what it'll do to a table we know what the name of Jesus will do to a table we know what the name of Jesus would do to a dead baby we know what the name of Jesus would do to a dead womb come on somebody we know what the name of Jesus would do we realize that there's power in the name of Jesus that when we speak the name Jesus that something's got to shake David said in Psalms 1 8 10 and 10 that all nations can pass me about but in the name of the Lord when I destroy them it may look like you're surrounded but you're surrounded by him the Prophet would say that this age is the grandest of Ages because it's the ending of time and the blending of eternity it's the greatest sinful age it's more sin in this age than there's ever been and the powers of Satan as many times harder to fight against than it was in any age we're fighting against a real devil it's not just some thought were fighting Iraq gets a real devil it's trying to steal away your health and still away your joy and all of these belongings that I read to you it's trying to steal all those things away to you but you don't have to scream at the devil to make you move I've stood beside men that try and they thought they had to stand there and scream at the devil to make him move you ain't got to scream at no devil the devil recognizes one thing and that's faith the devil realizes that there's a blood that's backing it up you see because when I stand there I'm not standing on my own accord and that demon does not have to he don't have to mind me but he has to mind the one that I represent he has to mom the name in which I'm proclaiming and there's no other name under heaven and earth where men should be saved but by the name of Jesus Christ the Bible said that all men shall bow and they shall worship that name they serve I'll at the name of Jesus Christ that name is power for tonight it drives demons back he drives fear back you ain't got to scream at no devil he don't care how much you cut up ain't gonna bother him more than one bit you can't scare him but the blood scares him there's a life behind that blood and that's what he's scared off the blood of bulls and goats didn't scare him away but the blood of Jesus does it's a perfect blood it'll move Satan you remember when that mania I came you forgive me but I'm not still in a battle here you remember when the mainly I came had Portland Oregon and he said that I'm going to break every bone in your body that you're nothing but a snake in the grass and the night tonight I'm going to I'm going to do these things to you you remember the proclamation that the devil made out of this man you remember those Saints but you remember that the demon lost why did he lose because there was a blood there and the Spirit of the Lord proved who belonged in the and Satan lost I'm going to drive this just here just now that Satan is a loser Satan is a loser a loser is somebody that's unable to succeed a loser is someone who this doomed to fail a loser is someone who consistently loses you know it wouldn't be very fair in the sports realm if you could tell who was going to

loser we started out this sermon talking about that tonight's the night tonight's the night of the celebration that you are going to win the battle the victory is over it's already done let me drop a few more things to you when I feel like a person is worthy of it when they're going for a job I'll tell them if I feel like they're worthy of it I'll tell them use my name use my name as a reference why because whether you won't believe it or not my name has power behind it I as a leader in this community when you go for a job and you put my name down a brother ons name it is associating you with a leader of the community and it is saying when I'm saying that I think what I'm saying is if I can tell you that you're worth to take my name and go to the job I'm saying that I believe that this person is worthy enough to get the job done that I believe that they should be hired out I don't give that out to everybody but there's certain people that I believe it's worthy of giving out my name too because they're worthy they're worthy they can get the job done I'm saying I'm saying that I believe that they'll be a good hire for you as the company I believe they'll be good for you I'm giving my name you see my name's backing you up whether you know this or not your name's got value my name's got value to it there's value to a name I was I was dealing with a place of business a couple years ago and it's trying to give me a runaround over over a certain business deal and I said hold up it was a manager didn't know the situation I said hold up one minute I don't believe you recognized Who I am you see because I send thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars through your place of business and I don't believe you want me turning that down you see I tell them that you're a reputable place and a place of good business that people can get a good deal here but I don't believe that you want me telling the people that I influence that this place is a place of business that does bad business and they're shysters they're liars I don't believe you want me doing that you see he didn't realize who I was but once I brought him up to who I was he quickly changed his stance why because he wanted mine any one of your business you see Satan has to take a change of stance when you come against him in the name of Jesus Christ because there's value in the name that you speak in are you with me tonight you see God must have thought something of you that he would tell you that you can take my name I got so back you speak in my name you prophesy my name I got so six and I got your 12 I will go before you I will be behind you yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they cook for
