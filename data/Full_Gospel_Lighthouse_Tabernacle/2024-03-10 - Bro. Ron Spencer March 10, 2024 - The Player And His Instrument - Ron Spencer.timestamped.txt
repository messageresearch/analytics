[48:28] last week we so enjoyed brother Jason
[48:30] Jackson being with us and amen all that
[48:33] took place afterwards and God just came
[48:36] Among Us and confirmed the word and it
[48:39] was such a such a special time and we
[48:42] sure love him with all of our hearts
[48:45] next weekend I just want to just drop a
[48:47] note and and uh I I want to sometimes as
[48:52] we have special speakers well I don't
[48:54] want you to think it's just just enough
[48:57] special speaker just like brother Jason
[48:59] we don't want to miss we don't want to
[49:02] miss what's going on brother Tom Ray and
[49:05] brother Michael Ray means a whole lot to
[49:07] us as a family and uh we so love them I
[49:11] go a long way back with them and in the
[49:14] years don't want to tell you how many
[49:15] years we go back but brother Tom has
[49:18] been a special friend of mine so many so
[49:20] many years and sister Joan of course is
[49:23] brother bis's uh granddaughter and for
[49:28] and for for to be some time with them I
[49:30] was able to speak in their camp meeting
[49:33] so many years and uh that's always been
[49:36] a special time brother Bisal was the one
[49:38] that called when I was in the coma and
[49:42] uh God dealt with him early that morning
[49:45] to call Sister Connie and she was
[49:48] actually brother Matthew was in one
[49:50] hospital and I was in the other and he
[49:53] told her that that that the Lord had
[49:56] spoke to him that morning that I would
[49:58] be the speaker at Mount Baker camp and
[50:00] that was the first time that they had
[50:02] bought that camp and so so anyway we we
[50:07] she came she came to the hospital with
[50:10] that news and it would be that day that
[50:13] that they would say that I wouldn't live
[50:15] but she had heard another
[50:18] voice and so we've had special times
[50:21] together whether it was in whether it
[50:23] was in North Carolina at the camp
[50:25] meetings we were together many times and
[50:28] then at uh and Murphy's Boro at at
[50:31] brother Billy Andrews so many times and
[50:34] and then when we went to Switzerland I
[50:36] was with Switzerland I know of nine or
[50:38] 10 years I was with him there in
[50:40] Switzerland and brother Tom was with us
[50:42] in on a few of those meetings and then
[50:45] I've spoke with brother Tom in uh in
[50:48] Switzerland as well then in North
[50:50] Carolina as well and then we went to
[50:52] China and that was one of the highlights
[50:55] of my life to be able to speak speak
[50:56] with brother Tom Ray brother Murphy Wong
[50:59] in in China we saw so many phenomenal
[51:02] Miracles take place and then the
[51:04] protection hand of God and so we we're
[51:08] so honored to have them coming our way
[51:10] we've worked on this a long time amen
[51:14] and if I could tell you how long we've
[51:15] worked on it we we've worked on it quite
[51:17] a long time but it's hard to arrange a
[51:19] family of 19 people to
[51:22] come and so if your seat gets reserved
[51:25] next week don't get offended at brother
[51:27] Tom we got to set them somewhere and so
[51:31] amen I'm sure these guys have already
[51:33] made that decision and they didn't make
[51:36] that decision because you're setting
[51:38] there they just they had to make a
[51:39] decision to put 19 people in together we
[51:42] want them as a family to sit together
[51:44] and so brother Michael Ray he and I have
[51:47] a special bond because he was working in
[51:49] the church office and had never an
[51:52] intention to be a preacher as a matter
[51:56] of fact that was the last thing we
[51:57] wanted to do but I went and I don't know
[52:00] what year that was but I went to their
[52:03] camp and God had spoke to me that I
[52:05] would deal with brother Michael and uh
[52:09] that God was calling him to preach the
[52:11] gospel and so I actually had to call him
[52:14] into the prayer line and when I told him
[52:16] what I told him he began to scream no no
[52:21] no so the next day he came to the to the
[52:24] house at brother Toms to try to talk me
[52:26] out of it and I said well I didn't call
[52:29] you amen and I said well I I tell you
[52:32] what you do you you go to brother Ed and
[52:36] just as a confirmation you have brother
[52:38] Ed to tell you that brother Ron was
[52:46] wrong and so when you hear brother
[52:48] Michael Ray you you know that we have
[52:52] been a part of his life and and then I
[52:55] was I was blessed to be at his his or
[52:59] ordaining uh to be a minister and uh God
[53:03] has blessed us together there and uh I
[53:07] just am I'm I'm actually thrilled that
[53:10] they will stand in this pull ppit amen
[53:12] then brother Aaron Oglesby which I was a
[53:14] part of his ministry and he'll be here
[53:16] in a few maybe a month or two and so
[53:18] we're looking forward to having brother
[53:20] Aaron you know God has the best amen he
[53:24] just absolutely has the best and so amen
[53:28] we're so thankful for that brother
[53:30] Chester is not here this morning but he
[53:32] wrote me a note this morning his first
[53:34] note to me and so brother his name is
[53:37] Chester Theodore Bennett and that you
[53:40] know when I saw him they were trying to
[53:42] call him something else and and I saw
[53:45] him Chester
[53:47] fit and when I heard Teddy when I heard
[53:50] his middle name Theodore you and I have
[53:53] a special link to Theodore and so so I
[53:57] think it's going to work out he's coming
[53:58] to move and be a part of our our our our
[54:01] lives here and so we're just looking
[54:03] forward to having him in the body of
[54:06] Christ here as well so glad to have each
[54:08] and every one of you and uh we love you
[54:11] with all of our hearts and we're just
[54:13] all in this Symphony
[54:15] together amen we're so glad we're so
[54:18] glad to be together and we so love you
[54:21] with everything that's within us isn't
[54:23] he good to
[54:25] usen brother Tim prit was at at Oklahoma
[54:28] last week with brother Matt Morris and I
[54:31] don't know exactly where they were but
[54:33] they were sharing stories backwards and
[54:35] forwards and brother Matt has been a
[54:38] friend of ours for such a long time
[54:40] and and he told him a story and we've
[54:44] heard it from a different angle but I I
[54:46] like this one I hope you don't mind me
[54:47] sharing
[54:49] it he said brother Matt Morris told of
[54:52] going to Indiana and was in a restaurant
[54:55] and a man over heard them talking and
[54:58] asked that asked if they were speaking
[55:00] of William brandom and they replied
[55:03] yes so he introduced himself as Mr
[55:08] furnish I hope I'm saying that right his
[55:11] grandfather owned an ice cream store the
[55:15] man said that that Red's family had a
[55:19] boy upstairs who had polio and hadn't
[55:23] been able to
[55:24] walk brother Brandon would would come by
[55:26] and spend time with them and sometimes
[55:29] he'd play checkers with
[55:31] them one day he asked if he could go
[55:34] upstairs and see the boy and pray for
[55:37] him and they said yes and the mother
[55:39] took him upstairs and left him there
[55:42] with the boy and went back down to the
[55:45] shop after a while brother brandham came
[55:48] back downstairs and said with when
[55:50] you're setting the table tonight set an
[55:53] extra plate amen
[55:56] they were thinking that brother brandom
[55:58] was coming for
[56:00] supper she sat out her very best
[56:03] dishes and she prepared the meal and
[56:06] they waited for brother Brandon but he
[56:07] didn't come red prayed and begin the
[56:11] meal and about the time they there was a
[56:14] sound that was heard from the stairs and
[56:18] this boy that was afflicted with polio
[56:21] came walking down the stairs for supper
[56:25] Hallelujah Lord
[56:27] the man that was told the story he said
[56:30] I know that to be
[56:32] true because I am the
[56:36] son of the boy who was
[56:40] healed and unless he was healed I
[56:43] wouldn't be
[56:45] here give the Lord a great big hand for
[56:54] that Hallelujah
[56:57] so it's always good to have the angel of
[56:59] the Lord come by your way isn't
[57:01] it I just think it's kind of neat and in
[57:04] that story brother Brandon would went
[57:06] would go by them and all of his busyness
[57:08] of schedule brother Doug just think
[57:10] about it all of his busyness of schedule
[57:12] and all the Mysteries being revealed he
[57:14] went by and played Checkers amen I think
[57:18] that's pretty
[57:20] cool I read through a scripture and I
[57:23] want to share it with you again because
[57:25] it will have more meaning to you a
[57:27] little
[57:28] later this is Isaiah chap 2 and verse 4
[57:32] and he shall judge among the the Nations
[57:35] and shall rebuke many people and they
[57:38] shall beat their swords into plow shears
[57:42] and their Spears into pruning Hooks and
[57:45] Nation shall not lift up sword against
[57:48] Nation neither shall they learn War
[57:53] anymore David would say something like
[57:55] this and bringing it to an individual
[57:58] level Psalms 139 and verse
[58:02] 13 for thou H has possessed my Reigns
[58:07] thou H has covered me with the my
[58:09] mother's womb I will praise
[58:13] thee for I am
[58:15] fearfully and wonderfully made I'd like
[58:18] for you to read the scripture with me I
[58:21] will praise thee for I am fearfully and
[58:25] wonderfully made marvelous are thy works
[58:30] and my soul knoweth right well I want
[58:33] you to just hold on to that scripture
[58:36] who made
[58:40] us wasn't our mother and
[58:43] father we came from them but actually
[58:47] God watched over even our natural
[58:52] realm well brother Ron I've never seen a
[58:55] miracle look in the
[58:59] mirror look in the mirror our family
[59:02] heritage has a lot of horror stories in
[59:05] it Wars and plagues and coming to
[59:09] America as immigrants and coming across
[59:12] on very difficult situations and living
[59:17] in a land and listen let me just say
[59:20] when the forefathers came into this
[59:22] place it was I'm sure it was a beautiful
[59:25] place
[59:28] but it had to be civilized and it had to
[59:31] be brought to where we could live here
[59:34] we're going to go back to that kind of a
[59:36] place uh Heaven's going to be a special
[59:38] place and he says for I am
[59:41] fearfully and wonderfully made and he
[59:45] said my substance was not hid from thee
[59:48] when I was in secret and curiously
[59:50] rought in the lowest parts of the earth
[59:52] Thine Eyes did see my substance and yet
[59:55] being
[59:57] unperfect and in and in Thy Thy book and
[1:00:00] all my members were written listen God
[1:00:04] knew the
[1:00:07] good and the
[1:00:10] bad which in continuance was fashioned
[1:00:14] when as yet there was none of them how
[1:00:18] precious also are thy thoughts unto me
[1:00:22] God's thoughts are
[1:00:24] eternal am God's thoughts are Eternal
[1:00:29] and we are actually the materialized
[1:00:33] thought of God sitting right here in
[1:00:35] this building
[1:00:36] today and he says oh God how great is
[1:00:40] the sum of them and if I could count
[1:00:43] them they are more in
[1:00:47] number than the sand that's quite a
[1:00:50] statement and when I
[1:00:53] awake I am still with thee brother renom
[1:00:58] says and we have seen his star and we
[1:01:00] have came to worship he said did you
[1:01:03] ever see them when they were fixing to
[1:01:06] mold a
[1:01:08] bell some famous Bell for a church Chim
[1:01:12] or or
[1:01:13] something they had to give it a certain
[1:01:16] ding you see if if you're ringing a Chim
[1:01:20] it takes a certain range for every
[1:01:24] bail
[1:01:26] he says and it takes a certain materials
[1:01:29] to go in there for so much brass and so
[1:01:35] much steel and so much of the other ores
[1:01:39] to get into this Bell and if it's just
[1:01:43] straight brass it won't ring
[1:01:45] right it's got to have all kinds of ma
[1:01:50] materials throwed into it to make it
[1:01:53] ring the right T kind kind of a tone and
[1:01:57] the man who has put the the mold up and
[1:02:02] set up the mold he knows exactly what it
[1:02:06] takes to go in that CPA and he said and
[1:02:11] what it takes to go into that metal to
[1:02:13] make that
[1:02:16] Bell that bell ring that tone now notice
[1:02:20] now brother random is going to come to
[1:02:22] us he said God is our great Cooper
[1:02:27] am God is the great Refiner's
[1:02:30] furnace that wor he has to put things
[1:02:35] upon us and trials notice these words
[1:02:39] they're important to us this morning and
[1:02:41] trials and persecutions and things to
[1:02:45] mold it together to make our testimony
[1:02:54] ring I'm going to read that again
[1:02:56] because this is the important sentences
[1:02:58] of this sermon God is our great
[1:03:03] KOA God is the he is the great Refiner's
[1:03:09] furnace that where he has has to put
[1:03:13] things to Upon Us trials and
[1:03:18] persecutions and things to mold it
[1:03:21] together to make our testimony rank
[1:03:27] for a certain time and a certain note
[1:03:30] that he wants to ring out every
[1:03:33] day this week the Lord spoke to me and
[1:03:37] dropped this in my heart in a very
[1:03:39] Sovereign
[1:03:41] way and he begins to deal with me and I
[1:03:44] I don't know how to put it in words
[1:03:46] exactly but I'll do my best and we would
[1:03:49] just call cancer a
[1:03:52] wound and he said this wound
[1:03:57] is
[1:03:58] causing you to be
[1:04:01] driven with purpose like never
[1:04:07] before taking that thought I go back to
[1:04:11] four years ago when he spoke to us
[1:04:15] remember he
[1:04:17] spoke if you will trust
[1:04:23] me I will use you like never
[1:04:31] before I don't know if you realize it
[1:04:33] today but as we begin to go into this
[1:04:36] thought your life is the
[1:04:40] interpretation of this message being
[1:04:42] lived
[1:04:45] out there will be many people that never
[1:04:48] read a book or never listen to a tape or
[1:04:51] never even know the M name wegan brandom
[1:04:55] but they will look at your
[1:04:57] life and it is because you're you're
[1:05:01] attached to the Sheep
[1:05:04] music your life is a musical instrument
[1:05:08] through which God wants to
[1:05:11] live now a musical instrument you're
[1:05:15] gifted all gifts come from God and a
[1:05:18] musical instrument actually becomes an
[1:05:21] extension of your own
[1:05:24] life and through that gift you play to
[1:05:27] the world now I if we could just think
[1:05:30] about this for a moment Satan has did
[1:05:34] everything that he can
[1:05:37] do to discredit the
[1:05:39] message the messenger the ministry of
[1:05:43] this day and he's done everything maybe
[1:05:46] even possibly this week to try to
[1:05:50] discourage
[1:05:53] you to deflect your your attention away
[1:05:56] from what's really focused on the word
[1:05:59] of
[1:06:00] God and if he can and if he can do that
[1:06:03] and if you can get your mind on
[1:06:05] something that's carnal or just
[1:06:10] stuff just stuff he will keep you from
[1:06:13] your life
[1:06:17] source and he will do that and I I as I
[1:06:19] think about this even in our
[1:06:23] prayer we'll actually pray very very
[1:06:28] selfishly and I I want to be very honest
[1:06:31] right here I learned very quickly in my
[1:06:35] trial not to pray for
[1:06:39] myself cuz I found out the more that I
[1:06:42] prayed for others the more God did for
[1:06:47] me now your
[1:06:50] music is a living music being played out
[1:06:55] a few few years ago before cancer I
[1:06:58] spoke a sermon on the
[1:07:02] hurt will not destroy the
[1:07:05] music and as I look back at it as I look
[1:07:09] back God was speaking to me almost in a
[1:07:13] prophetic way as I was speaking the hurt
[1:07:18] will not destroy the
[1:07:21] music and that was before the trial came
[1:07:28] now if we can just look at it he's did
[1:07:31] everything that he can to stop the music
[1:07:33] in your
[1:07:35] life but if we remember it's not us but
[1:07:39] we're bone of his bone we're life of his
[1:07:43] life the bride is she as
[1:07:46] him we're not just mechanics but we're
[1:07:49] also the Dynamics of it maybe you don't
[1:07:53] understand the Dynamics maybe you don't
[1:07:54] understand the word worship maybe you
[1:07:56] don't understand the spark of the fire
[1:07:59] but we need
[1:08:01] him it's more than just knowing quotes
[1:08:04] and knowing the message and having
[1:08:06] intellectual property that is important
[1:08:09] but we need
[1:08:11] him Hallelujah something phenomenal
[1:08:14] happened last night I saw a streak of
[1:08:16] fire as you guys was singing the song
[1:08:21] get in the
[1:08:23] room I want to be in the room if I got
[1:08:25] to tear a tile off of the top of the
[1:08:27] roof I want to be in the room I want to
[1:08:31] be in the room with
[1:08:37] him are you with
[1:08:39] me
[1:08:43] now these decades since the messenger he
[1:08:46] left and his fleshly lips were
[1:08:50] sealed this message has went around the
[1:08:54] world and and uh it took men to get it
[1:08:57] around the world it took men with great
[1:08:59] vision and we've been a part of that but
[1:09:02] let me just say this to you we don't do
[1:09:05] it to build
[1:09:07] schools or to even Kingdom build we do
[1:09:11] it that the message that is
[1:09:13] seeds and its words has life in it and
[1:09:17] then that life comes alive and whether
[1:09:20] you go to Europe or Africa or to to to
[1:09:24] Mexico or south America no matter where
[1:09:26] you go it's the same
[1:09:30] spirit and when you meet people it's
[1:09:33] just exactly like you've known them all
[1:09:36] of their lives just in a few minutes you
[1:09:38] feel like you've known them all of their
[1:09:39] life and whether you realize that or not
[1:09:42] you step from eternity into
[1:09:45] time and one day we'll go back into
[1:09:48] eternity
[1:09:49] again and we all are a body around the
[1:09:53] world and we need one another
[1:09:57] we need one another and so as a body of
[1:10:00] Believers around the world we're playing
[1:10:03] out the interpretation of this
[1:10:07] message this message is more than a book
[1:10:10] or a tape or a picture on the wall or
[1:10:13] laws of dos and
[1:10:16] don'ts this message is Jesus
[1:10:20] Christ living among us and living in US
[1:10:25] I pray that we can live such a
[1:10:28] life though people won't see
[1:10:37] us I turned the
[1:10:39] corner I went to see Titus play baseball
[1:10:43] was it this week this week
[1:10:46] and and quite a number was from the
[1:10:49] church here was
[1:10:51] there and so brother r i don't believe
[1:10:55] in those things well brother brandham
[1:10:57] said while you boys are in town why
[1:10:59] don't you go over to Louisville and take
[1:11:01] off take in a baseball
[1:11:04] game so anyway I I went to see
[1:11:08] Titus to to
[1:11:11] play and I I rounded the
[1:11:14] corner and Donna who is who is your
[1:11:19] neighbor help me with a last
[1:11:22] name bis
[1:11:26] and she she may she watches all of her
[1:11:28] services and so I tell you
[1:11:30] hello and she's a part of her
[1:11:33] congregation she watches every service
[1:11:36] and and she she begin to just quickly
[1:11:39] respond and quickly begin to talk and
[1:11:44] and she sees
[1:11:47] something she sees something
[1:11:51] real and then when I turned around there
[1:11:54] was another lady standing she actually
[1:11:57] works at Green
[1:11:58] Valley and uh she was standing there and
[1:12:02] so she watches his
[1:12:06] service and so and so
[1:12:09] anyway we begin to talk a bit and we
[1:12:12] talked and her husband Dallas came and
[1:12:15] and we begin to talk and we stood there
[1:12:17] for a few minutes and and then I turned
[1:12:20] around and there was somebody else
[1:12:21] talking and they said that they watched
[1:12:24] the services and and then there was
[1:12:25] another one standing there brother Ron
[1:12:28] well I didn't know them and they begin
[1:12:30] to talk about we enjoy your
[1:12:32] services
[1:12:35] amen we're not
[1:12:39] alone we're not alone here amen the
[1:12:43] symphony is
[1:12:45] playing aren't you glad to be a part of
[1:12:50] it aren't you glad now we know this
[1:12:54] message is
[1:12:55] is Christ revealed to us more than just
[1:12:59] in churchianity when we hear the titles
[1:13:02] titles have incredible meaning to us
[1:13:05] brother BR would stand and speak sermons
[1:13:08] like the Mighty God
[1:13:10] unveiled that sermon couldn't have been
[1:13:12] preached in any other age till this age
[1:13:16] when he preaches the
[1:13:18] Masterpiece and he and you just you just
[1:13:20] know how he takes those things and the
[1:13:24] token
[1:13:26] and he begins to talk about it more than
[1:13:29] a chemical life but it's a real life
[1:13:33] must be on display in our lives when he
[1:13:38] goes through the seals and men had not
[1:13:40] been allowed to touch it but as as he
[1:13:43] spoke last night the waiting was over
[1:13:46] and God opened the book for the Bride of
[1:13:49] Jesus Christ so you'd have Sheep music
[1:13:52] to
[1:13:53] play and we begin to realize that as the
[1:13:57] horse riders rode and God sent an
[1:14:00] anointing on the people to overcome
[1:14:02] those hor Riders are you with me and the
[1:14:06] Thunders were revealed and and the
[1:14:08] church ages let me just say as I as I
[1:14:11] was looking at my church age book this
[1:14:12] morning looking at it listen of all of
[1:14:16] the churches of the world they don't
[1:14:17] have a book like that right then he
[1:14:21] begins to speak a prophetic message
[1:14:23] called things that are to
[1:14:27] be because
[1:14:29] words Visions become words and then they
[1:14:32] become
[1:14:33] reality then he speaks a sermon like
[1:14:36] Shalom where I'm drawing these sermons
[1:14:39] from invisible Union of the bride and we
[1:14:42] begin to be United with Jesus Christ
[1:14:45] here on the earth Christ the mystery and
[1:14:48] Christ revealed in his own word and then
[1:14:51] he speaks
[1:14:52] leadership and he speaks that a couple
[1:14:54] of different different times and then he
[1:14:56] speaks communion the last service that
[1:14:59] before his lips will be sealed the last
[1:15:02] service you can't
[1:15:06] orchestrate forgive me but you can't
[1:15:09] orchestrate a life like what's
[1:15:14] lived many people and I I just want to
[1:15:17] drop this to you many people looked at
[1:15:21] brother brandom and called him God right
[1:15:25] and I I have to say this they saw so
[1:15:27] much of God it confused
[1:15:32] them but listen he wasn't God he wasn't
[1:15:36] wanting us to worship him he said if you
[1:15:39] love me call me
[1:15:42] brother and he said I can't be proud of
[1:15:45] my Earthly mother and
[1:15:48] father are you with me he had a love for
[1:15:50] them but he said he said there's he said
[1:15:54] but but my heavenly
[1:15:57] father and if I could take that and go
[1:16:00] to the scripture we realize that we're
[1:16:03] fearfully and wonderfully
[1:16:07] made and God watched over El every
[1:16:11] element that would go into our
[1:16:15] lives not just the great
[1:16:17] elements but the
[1:16:20] discouragements the wars that we would
[1:16:22] have to go through now sometimes
[1:16:25] when we come to
[1:16:27] it there's events I I thought it was so
[1:16:30] powerful what you said last night on the
[1:16:32] waiting and catching and being
[1:16:35] aware there was boys on the road to
[1:16:38] EMAs brother randam would speak a sermon
[1:16:41] called when their eyes are open and he
[1:16:44] says he said there they were walking
[1:16:47] with
[1:16:48] him and he expounds the scriptures of he
[1:16:52] had fulfilled all of the prophecy of the
[1:16:56] scriptures brother Bram said six hours
[1:16:59] he spent with
[1:17:00] them but at the end he was getting ready
[1:17:02] to make his way on
[1:17:06] further and they constrained him they
[1:17:09] put their hands on him and pulled him
[1:17:11] into the house and then when he broke
[1:17:14] the bread they recognized that's
[1:17:19] him I want to just say this to you don't
[1:17:22] come to a church service
[1:17:25] wherever you go to church don't go to
[1:17:27] service just for another
[1:17:30] service don't put in time just for more
[1:17:35] time every one of us have a part to
[1:17:40] play don't take it for
[1:17:43] granted these times won't always be
[1:17:47] here this is passing and it's going way
[1:17:50] too
[1:17:51] quick and I want you to understand don't
[1:17:54] allow it to just slip by and and oh I
[1:17:57] missed it or I should have paid more
[1:18:01] attention all of you went to school now
[1:18:04] you wish you'd have paid more
[1:18:06] attention I'm afraid too many people are
[1:18:08] going to come to church and and miss
[1:18:16] it now God's had Visions all the way
[1:18:20] down
[1:18:20] through especially through the Gentile
[1:18:23] dispensation whether it was Paul irius
[1:18:27] Columba and then under the inspiration
[1:18:30] of that there was Ministries that rose
[1:18:32] up powerful Ministries and they played
[1:18:36] their
[1:18:42] part we're at the
[1:18:45] finish I don't know how I can say it to
[1:18:47] you but we're at the
[1:18:50] finish and I want us to just think about
[1:18:52] this thoughts how many more services do
[1:18:55] we have
[1:18:58] left how many more services do we have
[1:19:01] left none of us are even promised
[1:19:05] tomorrow none of us are promised
[1:19:08] tomorrow all of us in our mortal flesh
[1:19:12] are
[1:19:14] dying I don't I don't mean to be a bear
[1:19:16] of bad news but all of us are dying but
[1:19:19] when we're in this space of life I don't
[1:19:21] want it just to go through and waste it
[1:19:28] I think one of the greatest failures is
[1:19:30] a man Wast his
[1:19:35] life I'm sure we can see the guy that's
[1:19:38] WI a beer bottle he Wast his life for a
[1:19:41] drug addict in his he Wast his
[1:19:44] life just been a selfish individual all
[1:19:47] about himself or an
[1:19:50] idolator waste his
[1:19:52] life but I I I think something what
[1:19:56] about sitting in
[1:20:00] church we all the people that heard the
[1:20:02] message of the hour and they were there
[1:20:05] to see a
[1:20:06] miracle or to be a part of a crowd or be
[1:20:09] a part of an anointing going forward
[1:20:12] where are they at
[1:20:14] today are you with me don't waste your
[1:20:19] opportunity whether you set in this
[1:20:21] church or or whatever church that you
[1:20:23] set in
[1:20:25] don't waste your
[1:20:35] opportunity sorry sometimes I become
[1:20:37] emotional right there in a
[1:20:40] spot I want you to understand that God's
[1:20:43] purpose will take
[1:20:47] place it will take
[1:20:50] place he will have a bride yes he will
[1:20:54] well brother Ron I I I don't I I don't I
[1:20:58] I just have many disagreements okay it's
[1:21:01] not for
[1:21:02] you brother Ron I don't think it's ought
[1:21:05] to be this way and I don't think it
[1:21:06] ought to be that way okay it's not for
[1:21:08] you well I don't want to dress a certain
[1:21:10] way it's not for
[1:21:12] you I can't surrender myself to it it's
[1:21:15] not for
[1:21:16] you are you with me listen when the
[1:21:19] wheat gets throwed in the air and the
[1:21:22] wind blows there's a lot of cha gets
[1:21:24] blowed
[1:21:26] away
[1:21:28] right people walked up to the ark and
[1:21:30] they had all kind of scoffing and all
[1:21:32] kind of mocking it wasn't for them but
[1:21:35] I'll tell you what it
[1:21:37] was there was a
[1:21:41] flood well brother r i somebody sent me
[1:21:44] a letter the other day scolding me for
[1:21:46] preaching the Rapture before tribulation
[1:21:48] Hey
[1:21:50] listen I got news for you I don't want
[1:21:53] to go through the tribulation
[1:21:56] amen obviously it was somebody didn't
[1:21:58] know anything about the
[1:22:00] message but I've heard a
[1:22:03] voice and the sheet music does not play
[1:22:06] for me in the tribulation
[1:22:10] period I'm not going to be a part of
[1:22:17] that are you with
[1:22:21] me but for the ones that says it's not
[1:22:23] for me or my trials are too big or my
[1:22:26] Situation's too big and I can't focus on
[1:22:29] the word I want to tell you the Sheep
[1:22:31] music for the tribulation is is
[1:22:39] coming I had a cousin it was a young man
[1:22:42] he died of a heart attack I actually
[1:22:45] took my business
[1:22:47] over and chimney sweeping many years
[1:22:51] ago and he told me he said what should I
[1:22:54] do
[1:22:56] his name was Rick and I said well
[1:22:58] Rick I don't know quite how to tell you
[1:23:01] if this message is not for you you can't
[1:23:04] build a bomb shelter deep
[1:23:09] enough you can't get
[1:23:11] enough grains of gold that'll sustain
[1:23:15] you
[1:23:16] amen and as a matter of fact if you live
[1:23:19] in the United States it's not going to
[1:23:20] be a good place to be
[1:23:23] at
[1:23:25] so I don't know maybe move move to
[1:23:30] Mexico now you think there's an
[1:23:32] immigration problem coming now you just
[1:23:35] wait till they stop dropping
[1:23:38] bombs it's going to be the other
[1:23:42] way I don't want to get political on you
[1:23:45] now but 7 million people have came to
[1:23:47] America since Biden's been in office
[1:23:50] that's greater than 36 States well can
[1:23:53] you imagine how many is going to head
[1:23:55] that
[1:23:57] way this ain't going to be the
[1:24:02] spot it ain't going to be the spot to to
[1:24:04] be
[1:24:05] at just drop in that for you that's just
[1:24:09] good for your
[1:24:11] flesh now I want you to understand God
[1:24:14] has determined our our our
[1:24:17] ways he don't force nothing on you but
[1:24:22] but we are the thoughts of God that's
[1:24:24] right maybe your parents said I'll have
[1:24:27] two children or I'll have three children
[1:24:29] or I'll have five children or I'll have
[1:24:30] 13
[1:24:32] children good
[1:24:36] luck
[1:24:38] but but more than parents thinking about
[1:24:41] having a boy or having a girl or I'd
[1:24:43] like to have another little boy to play
[1:24:45] with that little boy or I'd like to have
[1:24:47] another little girl to to play with that
[1:24:49] little girl or you know I'd like to have
[1:24:51] a little girl I'm I'm getting 45 years
[1:24:53] old and I'd like to have another little
[1:24:55] girl and uh you know I just want to
[1:24:58] always change diapers and so hey that's
[1:25:00] good if that's I don't have the nerve
[1:25:03] for it anymore
[1:25:06] but but listen more than all of
[1:25:09] that we're the thoughts of
[1:25:13] God I want you to think about it he made
[1:25:17] you so tall he made you so fluffy he
[1:25:21] made your eye color a certain way he
[1:25:24] actually even designed your
[1:25:30] personality and he did all of that so
[1:25:33] you would be a certain
[1:25:34] way and he would drop certain gifts in
[1:25:37] your
[1:25:39] life and then when you was in the world
[1:25:43] maybe you was raised in a Christian home
[1:25:45] and you wanted to experiment a little
[1:25:46] bit and God begin to deal with your life
[1:25:50] there was nothing in the world that
[1:25:52] would satisfy you
[1:25:55] amen and God begin to brood over you and
[1:25:58] and begin to pull on you and you begin
[1:26:00] to realize this is the only real thing

[1:29:35] him utter any of those words but that
[1:29:37] was wrestling in his
[1:29:40] mind and then God spoke to him you carry
[1:29:44] out your plans your wife will leave
[1:29:47] you you won't have your children and
[1:29:50] then God said something to him I'll
[1:29:52] leave you oh
[1:29:56] I'm so thankful for
[1:29:59] leadership I'm so thankful for a spirit
[1:30:01] of God that will turn us to way to where
[1:30:05] he is our entire
[1:30:09] focus a lot of people leave you in your
[1:30:12] life D but let me just say I don't want
[1:30:16] God to ever leave
[1:30:22] me now I want you to think God has had
[1:30:25] plans not just for your life
[1:30:27] here but he's got plans for you to walk
[1:30:30] on streets of
[1:30:34] go are you with
[1:30:36] me I'm going to skip some things Brother
[1:30:39] David iers from Belgium I don't know if
[1:30:42] any of you remember him but he came here
[1:30:45] after Easter last
[1:30:47] year from
[1:30:49] Belgium he's a wonderful young man I I
[1:30:51] met him when he was a young struggling
[1:30:55] Minister and he was struggling to find
[1:30:58] his way there was troubles in the church
[1:31:00] the church was
[1:31:01] unstable and he was just trying to find
[1:31:03] his place he wanted to be a help
[1:31:05] wherever he could be I actually had
[1:31:08] breakfast with him one morning and God
[1:31:10] dropped in my heart even where he was at
[1:31:15] trying to find his
[1:31:17] way that the young man that was sitting
[1:31:19] across the table from me was a futural
[1:31:23] general
[1:31:24] in the army of the
[1:31:28] Lord now I didn't share that with him
[1:31:31] but I just knew in my
[1:31:33] heart it would be in a meeting in
[1:31:36] Switzerland to where the church was in t
[1:31:38] such
[1:31:39] turmoil until it looked like the whole
[1:31:41] thing was going to fall apart they
[1:31:43] actually went into a hotel room and they
[1:31:47] just was looking for it to fly apart but
[1:31:49] God had bigger plans and the Holy Spirit
[1:31:53] Dropped In the room and Men begin to ask
[1:31:58] forgiveness and for leadership of the
[1:32:02] church and in just a little while and
[1:32:05] maybe in the coming months Brother David
[1:32:06] iers would become the pastor
[1:32:09] There Brother David iers has been a real
[1:32:12] pillar in Europe I don't know if you
[1:32:15] hear this or not uh they listen quite a
[1:32:17] bit but he came here and we didn't know
[1:32:22] this part about him but after the
[1:32:24] meeting was over we was having special
[1:32:26] fellowship and there had been some
[1:32:28] special moments in fellowship and we
[1:32:30] would just weep and cry and presence of
[1:32:32] the Lord and we were sitting at the
[1:32:36] table and and you know he said begin to
[1:32:39] say that I I play a
[1:32:41] saxophone I didn't know that about him
[1:32:43] he said I play a saxophone and he was
[1:32:46] just beginning to talk about his love
[1:32:48] for the saxophone and and you know he he
[1:32:52] said but he said I have a desire he said
[1:32:54] I've put money away from a long time but
[1:32:57] I'll probably never be able to afford it
[1:33:00] and he said but there's a saxophone
[1:33:01] that's built and it's built and it he
[1:33:05] said in World War II all of the shells
[1:33:10] were shot and all of the brass was taken
[1:33:13] and the metals that were taken there's a
[1:33:15] man got inspired in the
[1:33:18] 80s to start taking re and recycling
[1:33:22] bombs and shells and
[1:33:24] and start making
[1:33:28] saxophones out of this
[1:33:31] material and this man was inspired from
[1:33:34] Isaiah chapter 2 and verse
[1:33:38] 4 and it was inspired that the that the
[1:33:42] plow shears and and the pruning Hooks
[1:33:45] and and the swords be melted down to be
[1:33:48] used for something
[1:33:50] useful and would not learn the ways of
[1:33:52] War anymore
[1:33:54] and he said that musical instrument is
[1:33:56] so
[1:33:59] inspirational of what was of war and
[1:34:02] killing Humanity now beautiful
[1:34:07] music can be played through
[1:34:10] it and he told it in such a way until
[1:34:15] brother Andrew spoke up and said well
[1:34:17] how much is the
[1:34:19] saxophone and he said I'm afraid to tell
[1:34:22] you and we we are very patient
[1:34:27] people the conversation didn't go
[1:34:29] nowhere until he told
[1:34:34] us and brother Andrew and
[1:34:38] myself paid for that
[1:34:43] saxophone now I don't know how many even
[1:34:45] know that till
[1:34:47] today and we're not I'm not wanting any
[1:34:49] credit whatsoever but I think about the
[1:34:53] people that were
[1:34:54] killed and the war thank you you guys
[1:34:58] are you guys are out of this
[1:35:03] world did you set it
[1:35:05] up you're you're
[1:35:09] [Applause]
[1:35:16] awesome there he is hold that just for a
[1:35:20] minute I want you to that's in actually
[1:35:22] in the shop you can't tell
[1:35:38] but all right get it together
[1:35:45] run somebody was
[1:35:49] inspired to make more than just a a a
[1:35:52] saxophone
[1:35:55] but I'm going to take it the materials
[1:35:57] from
[1:35:59] war and it doesn't have to mean death
[1:36:02] anymore but it can mean
[1:36:06] life the other day when Andrew was
[1:36:08] preaching and I've rewatched it Andrew
[1:36:11] over and over again Brother David
[1:36:13] sitting there playing the music and you
[1:36:14] can hear the music
[1:36:16] playing and I thought listen this man I
[1:36:20] don't know how many he's made but it
[1:36:22] fell into the hands and we were a part
[1:36:24] of it it fell into the hands of a bride
[1:36:30] preacher and it's more than just
[1:36:33] preaching but it's a life being blurred
[1:36:37] through that
[1:36:38] instrument an amazing grace through that
[1:36:42] instrument is more than just a
[1:36:46] [Applause]
[1:36:50] song Give the Lord a hand right there
[1:37:02] you can leave that up for a
[1:37:05] bit Paul writes about
[1:37:08] himself 2 Corinthians chap 11 and verse

[1:40:28] I've got good excuses
[1:40:36] here sorry I've been laying a foundation
[1:40:39] here I am if you think about David's
[1:40:42] life and let's just get a little scheme
[1:40:44] of it you think about David's life he
[1:40:47] went from a boy that was
[1:40:49] forgotten to a man that became a giant
[1:40:52] slayer amen a man that became
[1:40:57] king and being a king he wasn't perfect
[1:41:01] and he became an
[1:41:03] adulter and then he became a
[1:41:07] murderer and the blood of the house came
[1:41:09] on his
[1:41:11] home and much turmoil did he
[1:41:15] quit no sir his Focus was on being King
[1:41:20] right his Focus was on got to build a
[1:41:25] temple and if I can't build a temple I'm
[1:41:28] going to gather the material from all
[1:41:31] over the world if I can't do the job God
[1:41:35] if you're stopping me there I'll
[1:41:38] help I'll help
[1:41:48] Solomon when God spoke to
[1:41:51] Moses we know the story story Moses
[1:41:54] quickly said I can't speak well he had
[1:41:57] an impediment of speech and the
[1:42:00] impediment was so bad till he had to
[1:42:03] have a an interpreter with him so people
[1:42:06] could understand what he was saying did
[1:42:08] it stop the
[1:42:10] message you said it more miracles took
[1:42:13] place after 80 years
[1:42:15] old all of that happened to him 80 years
[1:42:20] now in his past having great difficulty
[1:42:23] getting people to believe that he was
[1:42:24] the prophet of the
[1:42:34] hour he didn't have the Holy Ghost so he
[1:42:36] smoked the rock
[1:42:39] twice that didn't destroy the
[1:42:44] music it didn't destroy the music
[1:42:47] brother Ron but the scar of my life you
[1:42:50] don't know what I'm I'm preaching to you
[1:42:52] this morning if I the case I'm preaching
[1:42:54] to
[1:42:55] you I hope you get it I I don't know who
[1:42:57] I'm preaching to I've actually sent out
[1:43:00] word for three different individuals to
[1:43:03] listen to this sermon

[1:43:13] hard but don't let it take the focus off
[1:43:18] of the sheet

[1:43:30] president of of
[1:43:35] Egypt what a journey that it was we read
[1:43:39] a men like John Wesley I took time to
[1:43:42] read his story his daily biography let
[1:43:46] me just drop a couple things he was cast
[1:43:48] out of his own church they didn't want
[1:43:51] him no other Church want wanted him so
[1:43:54] he took a soap box and began to preach
[1:43:56] on the
[1:43:58] street he didn't have a church big
[1:44:00] enough after a while and he
[1:44:03] stood listen for those people that don't
[1:44:06] want a motion listen to this words he
[1:44:09] stood while
[1:44:11] preaching and the Holy Ghost so fell
[1:44:15] until 10,000 people were slain in the
[1:44:21] spirit when after wave and they fell
[1:44:25] under the anointing of

[1:44:58] set up this message is important I want
[1:45:00] you to hear it but they were slain in
[1:45:02] the
[1:45:04] spirit that's the effects of this

[1:50:41] plain life sometimes is not
[1:50:49] pretty I saw the pictures through the
[1:50:51] years of
[1:50:53] crawling like an
[1:50:56] animal and it was a victory for her to
[1:50:59] be able to crawl like an
[1:51:02] animal and her mom would send pictures
[1:51:06] and
[1:51:08] video did it stop
[1:51:18] her Ella has grown up and she's she sat
[1:51:21] here in this church
[1:51:23] Ella's been very
[1:51:25] attached and I have a great love for
[1:51:29] her but Ella has turned out to be a such
[1:51:33] a beautiful
[1:51:34] woman until she could be a
[1:51:37] model anywhere in the
[1:51:40] world stupid
[1:51:45] devil Ella has got
[1:51:50] character she didn't have to go through
[1:51:52] the hall of school to get as a learn
[1:51:56] Behavior but she has such a prayer life
[1:52:00] and such a dedication for god listen
[1:52:03] I've sat and listened to her quote
[1:52:05] scriptures and quotes for over an
[1:52:10] hour with such
[1:52:12] power and such character I
[1:52:18] marveled I marveled here she's a
[1:52:22] girl girl she didn't let it stop
[1:52:27] her I'll tell you what Satan since you
[1:52:30] want to afflict his service I'll tell
[1:52:32] you this you couldn't stop
[1:52:36] her you couldn't stop her she didn't
[1:52:39] have a pity
[1:52:41] party she's never said feel sorry for
[1:52:45] me sure she's been through depression
[1:52:48] and sure she's been through every Agony
[1:52:50] and every mental condition will I be a
[1:52:52] forever child will I be a child that'll
[1:52:55] never be able to accomplish anything in
[1:52:58] life now a college
[1:53:03] student when your focus is on the Sheep
[1:53:07] music just play your instrument just
[1:53:21] play
[1:53:28] I don't know Ella well the next one you
[1:53:30] will
[1:53:31] know I met him as a younger
[1:53:34] man we've been friends for a long
[1:53:39] time he didn't let his
[1:53:43] disability stop
[1:53:46] him he walked on his ankles with his
[1:53:50] feet turned in until
[1:53:53] he was able to have surgeries to
[1:53:54] straighten it up to where he could walk
[1:54:00] now and now his heels are his
[1:54:05] ankle those feet
[1:54:08] scream every
[1:54:10] day I have known him as a
[1:54:13] friend a long
[1:54:16] time and I've never heard him say I
[1:54:21] quit
[1:54:23] I have never heard Tim
[1:54:26] PR I've never heard him say feel sorry
[1:54:30] for
[1:54:32] me but he took that
[1:54:36] disability and let him drive him to
[1:54:38] studying the word of God and defeating
[1:54:41] every devil in hell and overcoming this
[1:54:43] leodys in world and get a bride ready
[1:54:46] for
[1:54:48] Rapture are you with
[1:54:51] me
[1:55:00] and in the last few years when God chose
[1:55:02] to take his Queen a home to be with the
[1:55:05] Lord he didn't stop and say I feel sorry
[1:55:09] for me I'm I'm through all these
[1:55:10] different kind of things let me just say
[1:55:12] this you it drove
[1:55:14] him to a higher
[1:55:17] level no discredit to the past but he
[1:55:20] preaches better now than ever before
[1:55:24] more stupid devil it causes you to be
[1:55:27] more
[1:55:29] focused and the more wounded you become
[1:55:33] the more focused on every punch you
[1:55:39] throw Give the Lord a good hand right
[1:55:51] there
[1:55:56] for the next one I'm humbled and
[1:55:59] honored and don't I don't know what the
[1:56:01] next feelings would
[1:56:03] be but there was a athlete in t in
[1:56:09] Canada his name was Terry
[1:56:14] Fox Terry Fox being an athlete extremely
[1:56:18] Olympic
[1:56:19] Athlete cancer struck him
[1:56:24] and they amputated a
[1:56:26] leg and put a prosthesis on
[1:56:34] it he could have said well I'll I'll get
[1:56:36] an office
[1:56:38] job he could have said well I'm just
[1:56:41] going to sit at home on my couch and not
[1:56:43] do
[1:56:49] anything but he said cancer has drove me
[1:56:51] to this this purpose I'm going to make
[1:56:55] people
[1:56:56] aware that the that the research needs
[1:57:00] help and his goal
[1:57:03] was 24 million people in Canada at that
[1:57:07] time if I can get a dollar from each one
[1:57:09] of them I can raise $24
[1:57:12] million so he started out on the east
[1:57:15] side of
[1:57:18] Canada and begin to
[1:57:20] run and when when he ran he ran a
[1:57:24] marathon every
[1:57:27] day every
[1:57:29] day not just one
[1:57:32] day but he ran it every
[1:57:37] day he could have had
[1:57:40] excuses he could have said I'm
[1:57:43] tired he could have said it's not worth
[1:57:46] it as a matter of fact there was very
[1:57:48] little attention when he started out
[1:57:51] very little if you know anything about
[1:57:53] his story now 60 different
[1:57:56] countries run Terry Fox
[1:58:01] runs he was doing it to try
[1:58:04] to try to get awareness to cancer that
[1:58:07] was trying to take his
[1:58:09] life and as he ran
[1:58:11] across he became more of a celebrity as
[1:58:14] he
[1:58:15] ran and he was in great he was in great
[1:58:18] great City places and he was celebrated
[1:58:23] as he
[1:58:24] came he came to the North toward the end
[1:58:27] of his race and all of a sudden cancer
[1:58:30] moved from that part of the body and
[1:58:32] moved into the
[1:58:33] lungs and he had to stop the
[1:58:36] race 9 months later he would succumb to
[1:58:44] cancer and this is when the article was
[1:58:47] written and I don't know have a have a
[1:58:48] Time State damp stamp on it
[1:58:52] but the last last recording was not 24
[1:58:56] million was raised but
[1:58:59] 850 million dollar have been raised in
[1:59:03] his name and in his
[1:59:05] honor amen I'm telling you that story
[1:59:11] because all through Canada people have
[1:59:13] sent me pictures of the Terry Fox run
[1:59:17] they're going to run at it in that day
[1:59:19] and they're running for run
[1:59:27] Spencer the other day there was a
[1:59:29] marathon took
[1:59:31] place and Michael Dexter we'll see him
[1:59:33] in a few

[2:08:25] playing he could have settled well this
[2:08:28] is going to be my journey this is going
[2:08:30] to be but he was determined I'm going to
[2:08:32] walk
[2:08:34] again one day he got the courage and he
[2:08:37] was rolled out there many times but one
[2:08:40] day he got the courage to pull himself
[2:08:43] up and stand can you imagine what that
[2:08:47] felt
[2:08:49] like he'd never do it they said he'd
[2:08:51] never do it and he's
[2:08:53] standing and the next day he determined
[2:08:56] to take some steps brother Doug and he
[2:08:58] took some
[2:09:00] steps and before long as those kids were
[2:09:03] playing backwards and forwards he was
[2:09:05] moving from one picket to
[2:09:07] another one day he decided I'm going to
[2:09:13] run I'm going to
[2:09:18] run let me just say this to you
[2:09:22] when he asent he won the gold
[2:09:25] medal in the Olympics for running a
[2:09:28] four-minute
[2:09:30] mile very few people knew the
[2:09:34] story they just celebrated the victory
[2:09:37] but they didn't know the
[2:09:40] story they didn't know what it
[2:09:44] took when I watched David iers play
[2:09:47] through that horn people can't
[2:09:49] appreciate the story that's right what
[2:09:53] was for death is breathing forth
[2:09:56] life when we walk through those Gates
[2:09:59] one of these days
[2:10:02] together we're going to scream We Made
[2:10:05] It by his
[2:10:07] grace we made
[2:10:12] it we made
[2:10:20] it
[2:10:30] and one more character I want to drop to
[2:10:33] you and like standing allegiance to the
[2:10:35] flag this character we need to stand
[2:10:40] to he left through a
[2:10:43] gate with thorns on his
[2:10:49] head thorn that would be pressed into a
[2:10:52] certain place because the Romans knew
[2:10:54] exactly how to
[2:10:55] torture Thorns to where that they went
[2:10:58] would go so deep until they would cause
[2:11:02] strokes and his eyes were filled with
[2:11:06] blood and they were running
[2:11:10] down he didn't walk to a hero's
[2:11:13] March they were screaming at him and
[2:11:16] saying Blasphemous things and spitting
[2:11:19] on him no was encouraging him go go
[2:11:24] go they were making
[2:11:28] fun and he would come to a pot a
[2:11:31] spot to where he couldn't carry it
[2:11:36] anymore and a man would step under that
[2:11:40] cross and carry
[2:11:44] it I want to talk to that man when I get
[2:11:47] to
[2:11:49] heaven he's somebody I want want to talk
[2:11:52] to when he put his arms and shoulders
[2:11:54] under that cross and Jesus is hanging
[2:11:58] near
[2:11:59] him and Jesus can hardly take one step
[2:12:02] at a time but there's no
[2:12:07] stop I I would like to be if I was with
