[29:40] I'm not on an ego trip. I'm nothing
[29:47] on my own.
[29:50] I've made mistakes.
[29:53] I often slip
[29:56] just common
[29:59] flesh and bones.
[30:02] I got to prove someday
[30:05] what I heard this message say
[30:09] that I'm of a special kind.
[30:15] For when he was on the cross,
[30:22] I was on his mind.
[30:31] Yes, he knew
[30:34] me.
[30:38] Yet he still loved
[30:41] me.
[30:47] He whose glory
[30:50] makes the heaven
[30:54] shine.
[30:59] so unworthy
[31:07] of such
[31:09] mercy.
[31:15] Yet when he
[31:17] was on the cross,
[31:23] I was on
[31:26] his mind.
[31:34] A look of love was on his face, the
[31:41] thorns
[31:44] on his head.
[31:49] The blood was on
[31:52] that scarlet robe.
[31:56] It stained
[31:58] a crimson ring.
[32:03] Though his eyes were on
[32:07] the crowd that day,
[32:11] he looked ahead
[32:14] in time.
[32:18] Cuz when he was on the cross,
[32:26] I was on
[32:29] his mind.
[32:35] Yes, he
[32:37] knew
[32:39] me.
[32:43] Yet he still
[32:45] love
[32:46] me.
[32:49] Thank you.
[32:52] He whose glory
[32:56] makes
[32:58] the heavens
[33:00] to shine.
[33:05] See, I was so unworthy
[33:13] of such
[33:15] mercy.
[33:22] Yet when he was on
[33:26] the cross,
[33:30] I was on
[33:33] his mind.
[33:37] Yes. When he
[33:39] was on
[33:41] the cross,
[33:45] we
[33:47] was on
[33:49] his mind.
[34:40] Sometimes I wonder, is he faithful?
[34:44] Does he see me in my trouble? Does he
[34:49] understand?
[34:51] Sometimes I question if he's able.
[34:56] Can he resue? Can he save me? again and
[35:00] again.
[35:01] When I look back,
[35:05] did he move every mountain? Did he part
[35:09] every sea? Yes, he did. So, yes, he did.
[35:16] Did he defeat the darkness? Did he
[35:19] deliver me? Yes, he did.
[35:23] So, yes, he can.
[35:26] Yes, he did. So, yes, he can.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Sometimes those voices try to tell me
[35:36] I've forgotten and I've fallen too far
[35:40] from his hands. But I know what kind of
[35:44] God he is. And I'm trusting in his
[35:47] promises. I'm believing and I'm singing.
[35:51] Yes, he can.
[35:54] Did he move every mountain? Did he part
[35:58] every sea? Yes, he did. So yes, he can.
[36:04] Did he defeat the darkness? Did he
[36:08] deliver me? Yes, he did. So yes, he can.
[36:15] Yes, he did. So yes, he can. I've seen
[36:21] too much now. I can't deny.
[36:25] He's come through every single time.

[36:46] every sea? Yes, he did. So yes, he can.

[37:35] Yes, he did.
[37:38] Yes, he can.
[37:48] Amen.
[37:50] Amen. That's the authority of a believer
[37:52] right there. Yes, he did. So, yes, he
[37:56] can. Why don't we give the Lord a hand
[37:58] clap of praise tonight? Amen.
[38:01] Do you believe that he did it then?
[38:04] &gt;&gt; So, he can do it right now.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of God that I serve.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And it's good to be in the
[38:11] house of the Lord this evening, isn't
[38:13] it? Amen. What a wonderful time that
[38:15] we're looking forward to this weekend
[38:17] and having our brother Thomas Ber from
[38:19] Elkton, Kentucky here. We're just our
[38:21] souls are excited and uh I'm just so so
[38:25] honored to have our brother to be here
[38:27] this weekend. I I remember when I was
[38:29] sitting out there on our uh we were
[38:32] actually eating at brother Brad Pal's
[38:33] out there on his back porch and I just I
[38:36] just felt the witness of the Holy Ghost
[38:38] come down and and I just asked Brother
[38:39] Tom would you would you come and
[38:41] minister for us and and he and he agreed
[38:43] to it and just felt a real witness of
[38:45] the Holy Spirit and then just to find
[38:47] the right timing and then just to see
[38:49] brother Tom's background and to see what
[38:52] the Lord's doing here with uh with those
[38:54] coming out of the Amish movement and
[38:56] brother Thomas came out of that many
[38:58] many years ago and just just to see what
[39:00] our Lord is doing right now. I believe
[39:03] that God is always perfectly on time. I
[39:07] don't know what you come expecting this
[39:09] weekend, but I'd say get your cups
[39:10] ready. I'd say ask big things because
[39:13] our God is more than able to do great
[39:16] things. Amen. Amen. Let's just stand

[39:34] Christ in baptism. But if you if you
[39:36] would desire to be baptized, the water
[39:38] is ready. And we just say like the
[39:40] scripture says, water's here. What do

[41:23] He said that I
[41:26] I could still
[41:29] go free. Yes, he
[41:34] Oh, tell me what kind
[41:38] of a man
[41:41] who would reach out
[41:44] his hand
[41:47] and do this for me.
[41:56] worthy
[41:59] to
[42:02] and not feel
[42:05] to kill.
[42:07] than a man on the cross.
[42:13] He put my name in
[42:16] his will
[42:19] and said that I
[42:22] I can steal.
[42:25] Oh no.
[42:28] Oh, now I never
[42:32] clue.

[43:43] restains
[43:45] they broke off
[43:49] in chains
[43:51] and said that I

[43:58] it tonight? But those blood rich saints
[44:01] said you can go free. He said behind
[44:06] I can still brother Thomas as you come.
[44:21] Oh reach down
[44:24] his hand
[44:27] and do this for me.
[44:37] So

[44:51] the cross
[44:53] had my name in
[44:56] his will.
[44:59] He said that I

[45:05] go free.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Having predestinated us unto the
[45:16] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[45:18] unto himself according to according to
[45:21] the good pleasure
[45:23] &gt;&gt; of his will. How many believes you're in
[45:25] his will?
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this evening. We
[45:28] greet you all in the name of the Lord
[45:30] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; It is certainly good to be here. Amen.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; And so, Amen. We just greet you from the
[45:38] saints up in Elton, Kentucky. I know
[45:40] every one of them would want to say,
[45:42] "God bless you, brother and sister." How
[45:44] many of you are all part of the family
[45:46] of God?
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And I told my church one
[45:50] time, what would what would it be if
[45:52] Brother Donny's church, Brother Tim's
[45:54] church, y'all's church, and all in our
[45:56] church, what would it be if we was all
[45:58] together?
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; It'd be heaven, wouldn't it?
[46:02] &gt;&gt; It' be heaven. Amen. Cuz how many
[46:04] believe that's one day?
[46:06] &gt;&gt; That's what that's the plan. Isn't that
[46:07] right?
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, God bless you. You can be
[46:10] seated for a minute. And uh usually when
[46:12] a preacher tells you that, you know that
[46:14] it might be a little long. Amen.
[46:17] So, amen. I just I got a lot I like to
[46:21] speak with you by the help and the grace
[46:23] of the Lord, but we do want to thank
[46:24] brother uh brother Andrew and brother
[46:26] Ron for the opportunity to speak to you.
[46:29] Amen.
[46:30] And so, we just want to share a couple
[46:32] testimonies maybe before we get started.
[46:35] Amen. Uh God is certainly good.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; And I think it was probably six months
[46:40] ago you asked me to come preach and I
[46:42] says, "Well, wow, I ain't got to worry
[46:43] about study. That's going to be way up
[46:45] ahead." And so for six months, I've been
[46:47] taking a little notes here and not notes
[46:49] there and and uh for the last week, I
[46:52] guess, you know, I took just tried not
[46:54] to do too much work. Thank you,
[46:55] musicians. Amen. Not to do too much work
[46:57] and just study and and write things down
[47:00] and so forth. And so, Amen. I thought,
[47:02] you know, if I if your man can't get
[47:04] ready in six months, I don't know if he
[47:07] ever will get ready, right?
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And on the other hand, we've been
[47:13] getting ready so long. So, my my my I I
[47:17] can show you about 10 pages here. So,
[47:19] you know, Amen. We're we're very ready.
[47:22] But anyway, we just uh we prayed about,
[47:25] you know, what to speak and and so forth
[47:28] because there's so much. How many
[47:30] believes we have so much?
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I thought, you know, I was a
[47:33] little under a little bit of anxiety or
[47:34] whatever. Just Lord, you know, I I'm not
[47:37] here to perform. I'm not here to be a
[47:39] somebody. I'm not trying to be like
[47:41] somebody else or whatever. And I was
[47:42] just praying. Amen. And the Holy Spirit
[47:45] spoke to me. Amen.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; And I was listening to Brother Andrew
[47:49] speaking uh just the other day. And
[47:51] during his sermon, he said something
[47:52] about he, you know, the Holy Spirit just
[47:54] told him just to let it loose. Let it
[47:57] loose. And I thought, well, the Holy
[48:00] Spirit told me just be yourself.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Just be yourself. Amen. How many believe
[48:06] that's what we want to be?
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Just be yourself. Amen.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; And we do want to thank each and every
[48:11] one of you for your prayers. Amen. I've
[48:13] got my warrior queen with me tonight.
[48:15] Amen.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; I don't know if y'all have ever heard me
[48:19] say that, but you know, and brother Ed
[48:22] Borto, God bless you. It's good to see
[48:23] you. I didn't know you would know you'd
[48:25] be here, but God bless you. It's good to
[48:26] see you.
[48:27] As you know, you know, about a little
[48:29] over a year ago, I thought that being a
[48:33] pastor for about 33 years now, uh, you
[48:36] know, I thought I had went through every
[48:37] trial that there, you know, bought could
[48:39] be, you know, and so, you know, and I
[48:42] and I I'll kind of preach to my s uh my
[48:45] uh my church there that, you know, once
[48:48] you pass a test, I don't know that God
[48:49] just puts it on to you again. You know,
[48:51] usually when you're in school, if you
[48:53] pass a test, you move up the next grade.
[48:57] And uh so I said, "Well, you know, we've
[48:59] had it pretty nice. It's going pretty
[49:00] smooth, pretty nice, you know, and and
[49:03] uh you know, and I thought, I don't
[49:05] know, you know, and then when we went to
[49:08] the doctor, you know, and the diet
[49:09] doctor, you know, diagnosed her with
[49:11] stage four breast cancer and said that
[49:14] it was in her bones, all the way in her
[49:15] bones, and she had complained a little
[49:17] bit about a pain in her back and and a
[49:19] couple other spots where it was just
[49:21] hurting." Amen. And um uh so we kind of
[49:24] kind of got a glimpse that it was
[49:26] probably in that that bone, you know, or
[49:27] whatever. And but it was in her lungs.
[49:30] All in her lungs. All in her all of her
[49:32] I asked the doctor when he said it's in
[49:34] her lymph nodes. And I says, "Well, how
[49:35] many li too many to count, you know?" So
[49:38] I guess they're all connected somehow.
[49:40] And so all her lymph nodes, all in her
[49:42] lungs, uh breast of course, and then in
[49:45] her bones. And so and a little bit later
[49:47] on the doctor had said, you know, she's
[49:49] just got a lot of cancer. kept saying a
[49:51] lot of cancer
[49:54] and uh so when I asked the doctor also
[49:56] when we was first in at the emergency
[49:57] room he said um after the other one had
[50:00] went over with Donna and showed her all
[50:02] the different ones and stuff and I said
[50:04] well what where do we go from here
[50:05] doctor and a female doctor came in and
[50:07] said uh you know and she began to talk
[50:10] to her and I says what do we do now do
[50:11] we remove the breast or where do we go
[50:14] that wouldn't uh that wouldn't do
[50:15] anything but leave a scar and and then
[50:17] she looks her in the face and says just
[50:20] so you Oh, you are going to die of
[50:22] breast cancer. And it pretty rubbed her
[50:25] up, you know. And of course, I was
[50:27] shocked and and it it kind of shocked me
[50:29] and I began to cry a little and, you
[50:31] know, kind of get go on her lap and and
[50:34] so forth. But she just stroke my head
[50:40] and said, you know, don't you worry,
[50:42] honey. Said, that's what she said.
[50:45] That's not what I said.
[50:50] Amen.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And she kept talking about how
[50:56] that she says, you know, it's not my
[50:58] faith, it's his faith. I got two
[51:00] grandkids that I'm teaching school and
[51:02] I've been in my line of duty and I'm not
[51:04] going to go nowhere. Thank you, brother.
[51:06] Amen. And so I'm not going anywhere. And
[51:09] of course, our whole family had to be
[51:10] gathered together. And to make a long
[51:12] story short, she had says, "Look, you're
[51:14] all acting like I'm dead already. I'm
[51:16] not dead and I'm not dying. And so y'all
[51:18] get back to building your house and
[51:19] doing whatever you're doing. And then
[51:21] the atmosphere and we all had to come up
[51:23] in that right in faith.
[51:25] Amen. And so do you know by God's grace
[51:28] the last PET scan and everything they
[51:30] had they said it's gone out of all of
[51:31] her lymph nodes out of her lungs and the
[51:33] he bones are healing and she's feeling
[51:35] great. Give God glory. Thank you Jesus.
[51:40] Stand up honey. There's my wife right
[51:42] there.
[51:49] Hallelujah.
[51:51] Hallelujah.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; God is good.
[51:55] God is good. He's worthy of praise.
[51:58] Amen. And she's feeling really good. And
[52:00] Amen. Amen.
[52:04] So before I tell you the next testimony,
[52:08] I want to finish that one. And like I
[52:10] said, that was and the way that it felt.
[52:13] I know brother Ron, he's went through
[52:15] the same thing. He's went through a a a
[52:18] very very big trial, very big test. But
[52:21] the way that it felt when they told us
[52:23] that was it felt like we were like in a
[52:26] Roman arena, like we had been thrown in
[52:29] an arena,
[52:30] &gt;&gt; with a a with a devil, with a gladiator
[52:34] that was experienced, very experienced,
[52:37] a Goliath.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Let's just say Goliath. That's right.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; And he's a very very trained warrior.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that the you know the the
[52:46] story was is you're going to have to
[52:47] fight and this fight is to the death.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Oh come on.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to die here.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Come on.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to die here. Ain't that
[52:55] right?
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And like my wife says, I'll tell
[52:57] you what who's dying. It's the devil is
[52:59] dying. Amen. Not my wife. It's going to
[53:02] be the devil that dies.
[53:04] Hallelujah.
[53:06] Amen.
[53:08] And so I felt like Lord I have not had a
[53:11] test. We have not had a test like that.
[53:14] Amen. Because I say I because she's part
[53:17] of me and I'm part of her. I mean know
[53:19] you know you're one.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so you know it was just you
[53:24] know but we're just so grateful for the
[53:26] mercy of almighty God. Amen. And so when
[53:28] when I seen her faith Amen. even way
[53:31] above mine. Uh, you know, that's when I
[53:34] said, "That girl right there, she's my
[53:36] warrior queen that God's using my wife
[53:41] to whoop the devil with." Amen.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; And she'll credit God. She says, "It
[53:45] ain't my faith. Don't say it's mine, but
[53:47] she's had it." And God give it to her.
[53:48] How many believe? Amen. That's the way
[53:50] it should be. It's got to be God's
[53:51] faith. Amen.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; And then a then a miracle. To me, it was
[53:56] a miracle even today. Amen. because you
[53:59] know we've we've had a lot of lot lot of
[54:01] things that we've went through and
[54:03] because of the things that we've went
[54:04] through hope you don't mind me sharing
[54:05] this brother an Amen. Um I've had I've
[54:10] had u a fear of coming up here like this
[54:13] in front of anybody but really in my
[54:15] church and weddings and and places like
[54:18] that. You know, you get a little nervous
[54:19] coming out here just because you're you
[54:22] don't want to say anything wrong or you
[54:23] really want to please the Lord and
[54:24] there's a little bit of that nervousness
[54:26] there. But this was not this is on a
[54:28] whole different level. This was a demon
[54:30] that would just man it would just over
[54:32] overwhelm you and make you feel like you
[54:34] can't do that. You just can't do it. You
[54:36] can't do it. And so and I've had that
[54:38] for quite a long time. Maybe in maybe 15
[54:41] years or something. And so I know my
[54:43] church back home is there watching. it.
[54:45] And so, uh, you know, and it's been I've
[54:48] overcome it a little bit seems like, but
[54:50] I've just never and I could come out
[54:52] here and start talking or pray or
[54:54] whatever and then get past it and go,
[54:55] but I'm telling you what, that old
[54:57] spirit of fear and it was nothing but a
[55:00] devil.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; It would really hit you and it would
[55:02] just oh, it just make you start
[55:04] trembling, you know. And so, uh, so I
[55:06] was and it it actually that devil tried
[55:09] to come on me even today because, you
[55:11] know, I really hadn't gotten over it and
[55:12] everything. But um and I just rebuked it
[55:15] in the name of the Lord. And I says,
[55:16] "I'm going to talk to Brother Ron. I'm
[55:18] going to talk to Brother Ron because
[55:19] I've heard of all the different people
[55:21] that he's prayed for and the Lord honors
[55:23] his prayer and everything." And I says,
[55:24] "We're just going to as my friend, but
[55:26] we're going to we're going to whoop this
[55:27] thing and I'm going to talk to Ron." So
[55:28] we sat down in his living room today for
[55:30] very long time and and I shared with
[55:32] him, you know, the anxiety and that
[55:34] extra fear and you know that comes and
[55:36] all and um and uh so he he talked to me
[55:41] and gave me a lot of really good advice.
[55:42] Really good advice. I'm telling you,
[55:45] y'all got a just a wonderful pastor.
[55:46] Amen.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; The best of the best. Amen. We Amen.
[55:52] Amen.
[55:54] And so anyway, to end that, I just want
[55:57] to say that we prayed together. Amen.
[56:00] And since we've prayed,
[56:03] Amen. This is the first time I've come
[56:04] out here without any of that fear.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; First time. Say, "Praise the Lord."
[56:10] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[56:13] Hallelujah.
[56:17] So remember, if you've got something
[56:19] that's bothering you for a year, you
[56:21] remember you just keep pressing on.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; God will hook that thing sooner or
[56:24] later. Amen. Just keep pressing on.
[56:27] Amen.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is good, isn't he?

[56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you richly.
[56:35] Amen.
[56:38] If you will, once again, let's stand and
[56:40] we'll just get into the word of God.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Bless.

[56:57] Jesus. Amen.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; I like that song. Don't you? Let me tell
[57:00] you about my Jesus. Amen. My
[57:03] granddaughters, they're they sing that
[57:04] sometimes if they have the other little
[57:06] girl with them and so forth, but I love
[57:08] that song. Let me tell you about my
[57:09] Jesus. And so, that's what we want to do
[57:11] with the help of the Lord tonight. Amen.
[57:14] Turn your Bibles if you will. We'll go
[57:16] just into the book of Hebrews. Hebrews.
[57:20] Amen.
[57:29] We will try not to hold you too awful
[57:31] long. At least not past 9 9:30. Okay.
[57:36] But I I do like I do like this. I like
[57:40] when we can have the atmosphere or the
[57:42] attitude that Lord, we're here now
[57:45] &gt;&gt; and Lord, whatever you want to do,
[57:46] that's what we'll do. Amen. Amen. We're
[57:48] not going to have in our mind
[57:49] preconceived, hey, it's certain time.
[57:51] Forget that. Amen.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; We'll be here all night. We'll be here
[57:54] all night if God wants. Amen.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; But just go until the Holy Spirit is
[57:58] done because I'm here to tell you it's
[58:00] about him doing something.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go before I Amen. Amen.
[58:05] All right. in uh
[58:08] Hebrews
[58:12] 10.
[58:21] Hebrews 10
[58:23] and verse 19.
[58:25] Having therefore, brethren, boldness to
[58:28] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[58:33] Jesus. Amen.
[58:36] And then over in
[58:39] first Corinthians, I believe it is
[58:46] 1 Corinthians the 3r chapter
[58:50] and verse
[58:53] 21. 3:21.
[58:56] Therefore, let no man glory in men, for
[58:59] all things are yours.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Whether Paul or Apollos or Cphus or the
[59:06] world or life or death or things present
[59:09] or things to come, all are yours, and ye
[59:14] are Christ, and Christ is God's. May God
[59:17] add the blessing to the reading of the
[59:18] word. You can be seated. Amen. I begin
[59:20] to uh I'll just be honest with you. I
[59:23] begin to study and I really want to just
[59:27] title this with the help of the Lord
[59:30] entering the holiest by the blood.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Originally I had thought
[59:37] about u titling this why we are the
[59:43] happiest people on the earth.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know why? Because brother
[59:50] Brandham, he said, "A Christian, he does
[59:52] not have one worry in the world."
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "I'm here to do nothing
[59:59] but to build the faith of the people
[1:00:01] just to get them built up to a place
[1:00:03] where it gets all the scare away from."
[1:00:05] We're trying our best to do that. The
[1:00:07] Christian doesn't have one worry. They
[1:00:09] should be the most freest, happiest in
[1:00:13] all the world.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, and I've said this
[1:00:19] before in the church. YOU KNOW,
[1:00:20] SOMETIMES YOU just feeling like saying,
[1:00:22] you know, I'm not one that should be or
[1:00:25] want to be, but I am.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; How many would say that with me? I am
[1:00:32] THE HAPPIEST PERSON IN THE WORLD.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'VE GOT THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
[1:00:39] GHOST AND YOU ARE SAVED, FOLKS, YOU'VE
[1:00:41] GOT SOMETHING TO BE HAPPY ABOUT.
[1:00:46] HALLELUJAH. HOW MANY KNOWS THAT GOD ONE
[1:00:48] TIME wasn't even God?
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; All right. WASN'T EVEN GOD. WAY BEFORE
[1:00:55] THE FIRST ANGEL was made. BEFORE THERE
[1:00:57] WAS any angels AT ALL, HE DWELT BY
[1:00:59] HIMSELF.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; HE WAS ALL BY HIMSELF. AND AS WE KNOW,
[1:01:04] THE PROPHET SAID, "GOD means an object
[1:01:06] of worship."
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; AIN'T THAT RIGHT? GOD IS AN OBJECT WAS
[1:01:09] HAD NOTHING TO WORSHIP HIM. SO HE WASN'T
[1:01:11] EVEN GOD. NOT THAT he didn't exist.
[1:01:14] Amen. IF YOU WANT TO STRETCH YOUR MIND
[1:01:16] JUST A LITTLE, TRY TO THINK OF WHERE YOU
[1:01:18] MIGHT ASK, WELL, WHEN DID GOD START? HOW
[1:01:20] FAR BACK DID IT GO?
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; HOW FAR BACK DID IT GO?
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT MY JESUS. HE
[1:01:30] ALWAYS WAS.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; HE ALWAYS WILL BE.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; HE IS. AND HE ALWAYS WILL BE.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; And everything centered around him.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED WAS
[1:01:42] HE BEGAN TO CREATE ANGELS and the angels
[1:01:44] worshiped him. The saraphims all of
[1:01:46] heaven WORSHIPED HIM JUST IN THE LAST
[1:01:48] COUPLE OF WEEKS. GOD JUST KIND OF MADE
[1:01:50] IT REAL TO ME. I SAID, YOU KNOW, WE
[1:01:52] WONDER. WE THINK ABOUT THAT DIMENSION
[1:01:54] AND HOW THAT GOD WAS AND HOW THOSE
[1:01:56] ANGELS ARE THERE DAY AND NIGHT FLOPPING
[1:01:58] their wings saying holy, holy, HOLY,
[1:01:59] HOLY, AND ALL THAT THAT WAS AND ALL THE
[1:02:02] EONS OF TIME, HOW LONG IT'S BEEN SINCE
[1:02:05] THOSE ANGELS ARE THERE WORSHIPING HIM.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE THINK ABOUT THAT. BUT YOU KNOW,
[1:02:10] I GOT A REVELATION GOD SHOWED ME. HE
[1:02:12] SAYS, YOU KNOW, AMEN. WE HAVE TO WONDER
[1:02:14] THAT,
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO WONDER BECAUSE ONE
[1:02:18] OF THESE DAYS, WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING
[1:02:19] THAT WITH THEM. AMEN. FOR THE EONS OF
[1:02:22] TIME THAT IS TO COME. WE'RE GOING TO
[1:02:24] KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE WITH GOD FOR
[1:02:26] THE EONS UPON EONS OF TIME.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Can't say time because there won't be no
[1:02:32] time.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; But hallelujah. AREN'T YOU GLAD TO BE
[1:02:35] PART OF THAT? AMEN.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY KNOW THAT GOD HAS A PLAN? HE'S
[1:02:39] GOT A PLAN. AMEN. AND TO BE A PART OF
[1:02:41] THAT PLAN should make us excited.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; We truly should be Amen. enthused.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember the gospel. AMEN. WHEN
[1:02:51] THEY FIRST CAME, AMEN. THE GOSPEL WAS IT
[1:02:53] WAS tidings

[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; I just don't understand WHY PEOPLE WANT
[1:03:41] TO BE CRITICAL of how emotional we got.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; I don't understand it.
[1:03:50] EVEN BROTHER BANNON COULDN'T UNDERSTAND
[1:03:52] HOW THEM GIRLS COULD BE OUT THERE
[1:03:53] DANCING. Ain't that right? Amen. HE
[1:03:55] SAYS, "MAYBE I HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH
[1:03:57] VICTORY IN MY LIFE." AMEN. MAYBE GOD
[1:03:59] NEEDS TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BATTLE, MAN.
[1:04:01] SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE VICTORY. SO YOU'LL
[1:04:03] SAY, "THANK YOU, LORD.

[1:04:19] BEING HAPPY.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; We ought to be the happiest people.
[1:04:30] Hallelujah. Brother Bam said it this
[1:04:32] way. He says, "Listen, SO WHAT ARE YOU
[1:04:35] WORRIED ABOUT? WHAT ARE YOU STEWING
[1:04:37] ABOUT? WHY ARE YOU GOING ALONG WITH A
[1:04:39] GREAT BIG FACE, big long face?" HE SAID,
[1:04:42] "LET'S LOOK UP AND GR.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; LET'S LOOK UP AND GRIN." AND NOT ONLY
[1:04:48] GRIN, but let's laugh.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Let's laugh. AMEN. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT
[1:04:55] LET'S LIFT UP HOLY HANDS AND GIVE PRAISE
[1:04:58] TO HIS NAME.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; If I stay on course tomorrow morning,

[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; We're like that little fatted calf where
[1:05:44] the farmer wasn't so lazy and he gave
[1:05:46] him some food.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not babies anymore. That's
[1:05:51] right.

[1:06:30] A CHURCH THAT'S ALL GOT A LITTLE
[1:06:31] WILDFIRE THAN A BUNCH OF ICICLES HANGING
[1:06:34] FROM THE CHANDELIERS.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Brother B said the Pentecostals even
[1:06:41] used to lick their lips.
[1:06:45] Oh, taste and SEE THE LORD IS GOOD. AND
[1:06:46] I GO AROUND LICKING MY LIPS. THIS IS
[1:06:49] GOOD. OH, TASTE THAT THE LORD IS GOOD.

[1:07:06] hour?
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; You know, we could take a whole sermon.
[1:07:09] I love the way Brother Andrew touched on
[1:07:11] it, but I'm here to tell you, we should
[1:07:13] be thankful.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Give thanks.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; That's right. cuz he's worthy of thanks.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because of what he's done in our
[1:07:22] generation,
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; we can't fathom. WE JUST HARDLY CAN'T
[1:07:24] FATHOM
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; THE GOOD THINGS THAT GOD HAS GIVEN US.
[1:07:28] HOW GOOD WE REALLY HAVE IT.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; So he makes this statement, brother
[1:07:34] Bamz. He says, "Footsteps, footsteps is
[1:07:37] victory." I'll tell you today, he says,
[1:07:39] "Let's trot on the lands that God give
[1:07:41] us. Divine healing, powers of God,
[1:07:43] everything. Coming into Christ is like
[1:07:46] going down to a great big arcade here,
[1:07:48] going into a variety store. And you look
[1:07:51] all around and there's everything in
[1:07:53] there. The shelves are full of nice
[1:07:55] pretty things.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; And everything that I LIKE.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY KNOW THAT GOD KNOWS JUST WHAT
[1:08:02] YOU LIKE?
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; He knew that you would LOVE MALACHI 4.
[1:08:06] HE KNEW THAT YOU WOULD LOVE THE
[1:08:07] VINDICATION OF AMEN. THEIR NAME IS FROM
[1:08:10] SO AND SO. IF I'VE TOLD YOU THE TRUTH,
[1:08:12] IF CHRIST DON'T COME, AMEN. YOU OUGHT TO
[1:08:14] GOT AIN'T GOT TO BELIEVE ME. BUT IF HE
[1:08:16] DOES, THEN HE THUS SAYAITH THE LORD. HOW
[1:08:18] MANY MEAN WE GOT? THUS SAYAITH THE LORD.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Good things.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; So he says it this way. And listen, I
[1:08:27] part partly uh pulled in this uh this
[1:08:31] scripture here where he says, you know,
[1:08:34] whether it's the world or whether it's
[1:08:35] life or whether it's death. Uh
[1:08:39] whoa. We could stop there, couldn't we?
[1:08:41] Whether it's life OR EVEN DEATH.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE DEATH is ours?
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T FEAR DEATH ANYMORE. WHAT IS IT?
[1:08:48] IT'S A HORSE AND BUGGY THAT'S GOING TO
[1:08:50] CARRY US OVER. PAUL SAID, "OH, DEATH,
[1:08:53] WHERE IS YOUR STAIN? OH, GRAVE, WHERE IS
[1:08:55] YOUR VICTORY?"
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN. GIVE ME SOME OF THAT OFF OF THE
[1:08:58] SHELF.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE IT'S A VARIETY STORE?
[1:09:02] AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS
[1:09:03] WEEKEND. IS THAT ALL RIGHT?
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; We're going to GET LADDERS. WE'RE GOING
[1:09:05] TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH THIS
[1:09:09] VARIETY STORE. WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT
[1:09:10] WE GOT.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Tell me what I got.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; WOO. HALLELUJAH. And he talks about, you
[1:09:18] know, um if you had a variety store with
[1:09:20] all these little gizmos, this that or
[1:09:22] the other. Another place he says right
[1:09:24] down there off the next next one, he
[1:09:25] says the trouble with Christians today
[1:09:27] is they don't realize what is provided
[1:09:29] for them.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Come on now.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Come on, preacher.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:37] Oh, I want to go back before the
[1:09:38] foundation of the world again. Amen. In
[1:09:41] God's thinking, and we will here in a
[1:09:43] minute. All right. They don't realize
[1:09:45] what they got. Many people doesn't
[1:09:47] realize the great glories and powers
[1:09:49] that's provided for them. Coming into
[1:09:51] Christ is like a walking into arcade
[1:09:54] down here, a great department store. He
[1:09:56] says it. He calls it a department store.
[1:09:58] And of course, WE CAN WE CAN JUST
[1:09:59] IMAGINE a little bit of of our own and
[1:10:01] thinking about a DEPARTMENT STORE. FOR
[1:10:03] US HUNTERS,
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; it would be Cabelas.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Can you imagine somebody say,
[1:10:12] "You inherit Cabelas. THE DOORS ARE
[1:10:14] LOCKED. HERE'S the key. EVERYTHING IN
[1:10:16] THERE IS YOURS."
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; OH, we might have to. You'd be frowning,
[1:10:21] huh?
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; No. You'd say, "Hey, GIVE ME THE KEY.
[1:10:27] GIVE ME THE KEY."
[1:10:29] GOD.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; AND YOU'D GO IN THERE AND EVERY GUN THAT
[1:10:31] YOU COULD EVER IMAGINE, EVERY BOAT YOU
[1:10:33] COULD EVER IMAGINE, EVERY FISHING POLE
[1:10:35] YOU COULD EVER IMAGINE, EVERYTHING IS IN
[1:10:37] THERE AND IT'S PROVIDED FOR. IT'S ALL
[1:10:39] YOURS.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE THIS IS ALL OURS? AMEN.
[1:10:43] IT'S MINE. FROM TIMBER TO TIMBER, IT'S
[1:10:46] MINE. MINE. MINE. MINE. YES. JESUS IS
[1:10:49] MINE.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:56] THAT'S WHY I'M THE HAPPIEST PERSON IN
[1:10:58] THE WORLD. IF THAT DON'T GIVE YOU JOY, I
[1:11:00] DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. You We CAN ONLY TOUCH ON
[1:11:07] SOME OF THE THINGS.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:12] Praise be to God.
[1:11:15] Hallelujah.
[1:11:17] That's right. A great department store.
[1:11:20] Amen.
[1:11:23] I think Sister Katie was saved talking
[1:11:25] about that department store for women's
[1:11:27] clothes in Pennsylvania somewhere. She
[1:11:29] liked to go back there, huh? Women's
[1:11:32] clothes just massive.
[1:11:37] Your eyes would pop up. Oh, yeah. I like
[1:11:40] that dress. I like this. I I TELL YOU
[1:11:42] WHAT, I LIKE THIS OUTFIT AND I LIKE THAT
[1:11:44] OUTFIT. MY YOU WOULD HAVE YOU A TIME,
[1:11:45] wouldn't you? Amen. THAT'S KIND OF WHAT
[1:11:48] WE'RE doing tonight. And tomorrow
[1:11:50] morning, we're in this department store
[1:11:52] and we're just looking at what ours.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Look at what's mine.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. We go on this department store and
[1:12:01] we look we look over here on the shelf
[1:12:03] and what do we find?
[1:12:05] We find a book. We the book department.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; You got the Bible.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then you got the fulfillment
[1:12:14] of the Bible. You got the seven seals.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; You got the church age book.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. AND WE WE HAVE FOUND
[1:12:21] OUT. HOW MANY KNOWS? WE HAVE FOUND OUT.
[1:12:23] WE DON'T HAVE TO WONDER WHERE WE'RE
[1:12:24] COMING FROM. WE DON'T HAVE TO WONDER
[1:12:25] WHAT THE PLAN OF GOD IS. YOU DON'T HAVE
[1:12:27] TO WONDER ALL OF THOSE THINGS. AMEN. IT
[1:12:29] WAS THE THAT PART OF GOD'S MIND. AMEN.
[1:12:32] WHEN YOU OPEN THAT BOOK, YOU REALIZE
[1:12:33] THAT EVEN GOD WASN'T EVEN GOD ONE TIME.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AND THEN HE CREATED ANGELS,
[1:12:40] DID ALL OF THESE THINGS. AMEN. CREATED
[1:12:42] ANGELS. AND then there was trouble in
[1:12:46] heaven.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many knows heaven had some
[1:12:49] trouble?
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Now, let's just go back a little bit.
[1:12:55] Even before him, before the first star
[1:12:57] was created, before anything that was
[1:12:59] made, before the foundation of the
[1:13:01] world, how many knows that he had you in
[1:13:04] his
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; mind?
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; He had he had you in his mind. And we'll
[1:13:13] get into the trouble in heaven in the
[1:13:15] middle a little a little bit because we
[1:13:17] want to bring in how that God had
[1:13:18] something in his mind and we know what
[1:13:20] he had in his mind. He said herein is
[1:13:22] set forth the love of God. He desired
[1:13:25] and love a family of his own. How many
[1:13:27] appreciate your family?
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; See that's what God had in mind. Amen.
[1:13:31] Before anything ever started, he wanted
[1:13:33] a family. He wanted a wife.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; He wanted children, SONS AND DAUGHTERS
[1:13:38] LIKE HIMSELF.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HOW MANY KNOWS THAT'S GOD'S
[1:13:41] PURPOSE TONIGHT? AMEN. IS TO BRING his
[1:13:44] children, Amen, TO THE AGE OF ACCOUNT OR
[1:13:46] THE OF MATURITY.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; The age of maturity.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:13:57] Oh my. SO HE SAYS, "SON'S LIKE HIMSELF.
[1:14:01] THEREFORE, BEFORE HIM LIES ALL OF
[1:14:03] mankind as one lump of clay, and out of
[1:14:05] that same lump of clay, he will now make
[1:14:07] vessels of unto honor and unto dishonor.
[1:14:10] The choosing will be his own choosing.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; How many knows HE CHOOSE YOU LONG BEFORE
[1:14:20] YOU CHOSE HIM?
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; He's the one that chose you.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother, you're not a Christian.
[1:14:28] You're not GOING TO MISS. SHUT UP. GOD
[1:14:29] CHOSE ME.
[1:14:33] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE GAVE HIS ONLY SON. AMEN. SO,
[1:14:37] HOW CAN YOU LAY ANYTHING AT THE CHARGE
[1:14:39] OF GOD'S ELECT?
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD THAT JUSTIFIES.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD THAT SANCTIFIES. IT'S GOD THAT
[1:14:46] FILLS WITH THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I'm going to put you out of
[1:14:51] the message. Go ahead and try.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T BRING ME IN AND YOU CAN'T PUT
[1:14:57] ME OUT.
[1:15:02] HALLELUJAH.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY WE TELL THE DEVIL TOO
[1:15:08] EVERY TIME HE TRIES AND GETS YOU TO
[1:15:10] FALL. DEVIL, YOU DIDN'T BRING ME IN.
[1:15:11] AMEN. AND YOU CAN'T TAKE ME OUT. THERE'S
[1:15:14] NOTHING CAN SEPARATE ME FROM THE LOVE OF
[1:15:16] GOD. NOT TRIBULATION, NOT DISTRESS.
[1:15:18] AIN'T NOTHING CAN SEPARATE US FROM THE
[1:15:20] LOVE OF GOD.
[1:15:22] HEY,
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; but says when a believer has an ABSOLUTE
[1:15:26] EXPERIENCE ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE
[1:15:27] DESERT AND A PREACHER AIN'T SUPPOSED TO
[1:15:28] PREACH, YOU CAN'T CALL YOURSELF A
[1:15:30] CHRISTIAN UNTIL YOU HAVE MET GOD ON THE
[1:15:32] BACK SIDE OF THE DESERT.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE WHEN THAT HAPPENS,
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; SIR,
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; WHEN THAT HAPPENS,
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOT ENOUGH IMPS, NOT ENOUGH
[1:15:39] DEVILS IN HELL TO EVER TAKE IT FROM YOU.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:15:50] I'M ALMOST 64. I GOT SAVED AT 20. AND
[1:15:53] I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, IT WASN'T ME THAT
[1:15:55] HELD ME. IT WAS GOD THAT HELD ME.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; HE HAS BROUGHT US SAFE THUS FAR. I AIN'T
[1:16:01] WORRIED ABOUT MAKING IT. I ALREADY MADE
[1:16:03] IT.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I ALREADY MADE IT.
[1:16:12] I ALREADY HAVE A GLORIFIED BODY. I'VE
[1:16:14] GOT A WAITING FOR ME.
[1:16:18] THAT'S WHAT I FIND IN GOD'S GREAT STORE,
[1:16:21] A THEOPHONY.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; That's why we ought to be the happiest
[1:16:30] people.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; You ain't got nothing to be scared of.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:44] Ain't God good?
[1:16:47] You see folks that's home. ALL MY LIFE
[1:16:51] YOU HAVE been faithful.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; All my life you have been good.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; So good.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; With every breath barely have any. WITH
[1:17:01] EVERY BREATH THAT I AM ABLE, I WILL SING
[1:17:05] OF THE GOODNESS OF GOD. I WILL SHOUT
[1:17:08] ABOUT THE GOODNESS OF GOD.
[1:17:13] HE'S BEEN SO GOOD TO ME.
[1:17:16] HE'S HELD ME. HE PICKED ME UP WHEN I WAS
[1:17:18] DOWN. HE HEALED ME WHEN I WAS SICK. HE
[1:17:20] SAVED MY SOUL WHEN I WAS LOST. HE FILLED
[1:17:23] ME WITH THE HOLY Ghost when I need the
[1:17:24] Holy Ghost.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Y'all going to kill me.
[1:17:34] You were right.
[1:17:40] That's all right. If I hard have a heart
[1:17:42] attack,
[1:17:44] you remember I died happy.
[1:17:50] I died happy.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; We don't realize, I read one place,
[1:17:59] Brother Bram says, if this would all
[1:18:01] come down on us all at once, the rapture
[1:18:05] would almost take place. where we're not
[1:18:07] bringing it all at once, but we're
[1:18:09] eating a little this and a little that.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; WHO KNOWS? MAYBE BEFORE THE CHURCH IS
[1:18:14] OVER, THE RAPTURE TAKE PLACE.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; HOW many is looking for? We've had the
[1:18:19] woman IN PURPLE. WE'VE HAD THE AMERICAN
[1:18:21] POPE.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "AFTER THAT PURPLE WOMAN, THE
[1:18:24] NEXT THING HE'S FIRE, RUSSIA'S GETTING
[1:18:26] RAMPED UP. THEY'RE GETTING READY TO
[1:18:28] SHOOT SOMEBODY."
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; HELLO. But I ain't GOING TO BE ME CUZ
[1:18:32] THAT THAT ROCKET IS IN THE SKY. I DON'T
[1:18:35] CARE IF I SEE IT WITH MINE. BROTHER
[1:18:37] BRANDON SAID BEFORE IT BREAKS, THE BRIDE
[1:18:39] WILL BE GONE.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT I LIKE. THAT'S MY PROMISE.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; That's part of the varieties. That's
[1:18:50] God's word.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:19:08] So
[1:19:10] then God created all those angels.
[1:19:15] Heaven was all in good harmony.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Everything was going good.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; Then all of a sudden
[1:19:25] something happened, didn't it?
[1:19:29] Somebody
[1:19:31] let heaven become common to him.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; What' I do with my glasses?
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Got to watch that sneaky pulpit. It lies
[1:19:53] from you.
[1:20:01] That's all right. I think I've had him
[1:20:02] there and said, "Where's that?"
[1:20:05] Or I've had I've had one here and put
[1:20:07] another one here.
[1:20:10] Done all kinds of stuff. Never know what
[1:20:12] you're going to do.
[1:20:15] But amen.
[1:20:17] So the devil,
[1:20:19] we know Satan, he was God's right- hand
[1:20:21] man, wasn't he?
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; God's right hand man. And all of a
[1:20:25] sudden
[1:20:26] he become let heaven become common.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; How many knows that's we got to warn we
[1:20:33] got to be careful of that.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; We got to be careful that this message
[1:20:37] the word of God doesn't become common.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; And then it begin to no doubt murmur and
[1:20:43] then begin to gossip.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; How many know that's why brother Bram
[1:20:46] says the poison acids.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come from the spit of the devil.
[1:20:51] When you've got uh gossiping and
[1:20:54] discontent,
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; discontentment, boy, is it not a good
[1:20:58] thing?
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Complaining. God hates complaining.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; God hates murmuring.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he had it up there first.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. He hates WHEN SOMEBODY CAUSES
[1:21:09] DIVISION IN THE CHURCH.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; HE HATES IT. WHY? CUZ HE HAD A DIVISION
[1:21:13] UP THERE. AIN'T THAT RIGHT? AND SATAN
[1:21:15] TOOK TWOTHIRDS OF THE ANGELS. AMEN. AND
[1:21:17] WHEN NATHAN AND KORA WHEN THEY BEGIN TO
[1:21:19] SPEAK AGAINST MOSES AND SAY LIKE THE
[1:21:21] DEVIL DID UP IN HEAVEN, GOD, YOU'RE NOT
[1:21:23] THE ONLY HOLY ONE. WE WANT SOME OF THE
[1:21:24] WORSHIP, TOO.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; WE WANT SOME OF THIS GREATNESS AND HIS
[1:21:28] GLORY, TOO. AND THAT'S WHAT NATHAN SAYS.
[1:21:30] GOD, GOD DIDN'T LIKE IT SO WELL THAT HE
[1:21:32] HAD MOSES TO SEPARATE HIM. SAID, "ALL
[1:21:33] THAT'S ON OUR SIDE, COME ON OVER."
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; IT'S TOUGH WHEN the pastor has to DO
[1:21:37] THAT SOMETIME. AND ALL THAT'S ON GOD'S
[1:21:39] SIDES, COME ON.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; HELLO.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD HATED IT SO BAD, HE CRACKED THE
[1:21:44] EARTH OPEN. AMEN. AND THEY WENT
[1:21:46] SWALLOWED A HOLE DOWN INTO HELL, SO TO
[1:21:49] SPEAK, as the people listen. So, Lord,
[1:21:52] help us.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; MY POINT IS THIS. GOD WANTS CHILDREN. HE
[1:21:56] WANTS SONS AND DAUGHTERS LIKE HIMSELF.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; And we all ALREADY KNOW THAT IN THE
[1:22:02] WHOLE PROGRAM OF GOD, GOD WANTED TO
[1:22:04] DISPLAY HIMSELF. HE WANTED TO BE A
[1:22:06] SAVIOR. HE WANTED TO BE A HEALER.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; But he couldn't do it if we didn't get
[1:22:10] lost.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; OH, I'M SO GLAD THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER
[1:22:13] HOW BAD THINGS ARE. IT DON'T MATTER IF
[1:22:15] YOU ARE AMEN STRICKEN WITH CANCER OR
[1:22:17] WHATEVER IT IS. AMEN. GOD IS GREATER.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; GOD IS GREATER. AMEN. THERE'S A PLAN.
[1:22:24] GOD HAS GOT A PLAN IN IT ALL. AND SO HE
[1:22:26] ALLOWED US TO GET INTO THIS PLACE
[1:22:27] THROUGH THE FIRST ADAM.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT? THROUGH THE FIRST ADAM,
[1:22:31] HE ALLOWED TO COME INTO THE FALL AND
[1:22:33] EVERYTHING.
[1:22:35] BUT PRAISE BE TO GOD FOR THE SECOND
[1:22:37] ADAM. HOW MANY BELIEVE WHEN SECOND ADAM
[1:22:39] COME AND WHEN HE WAS ON CALVARY,
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; GOD HAD THAT IN HIS MIND BEFORE THE
[1:22:43] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. AMEN. WHEN HE
[1:22:45] SAID, "IT IS FINISHED," IT WAS FINISHED.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; But B said, "IF JESUS WAS HERE IN MY
[1:22:54] SUIT RIGHT NOW AND YOU WANTED to be
[1:22:56] healed, he couldn't heal you." That's
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; IS THAT WHAT HE SAID?
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. HE COULDN'T HEAL. HE WOULD
[1:23:02] TELL YOU, "I ALREADY DID.
[1:23:06] I already did. It's already done.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; MY WIFE, BROTHER, WE GOT TO SAY IT'S
[1:23:12] ALREADY DONE. AND YOU CAN'T JUST SAY,
[1:23:14] "WELL, I hope it will, but I'm not going
[1:23:16] to tell nobody that I'm healed."
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Uh-uh. You've got TO CONFESS IT WITH
[1:23:20] YOUR MOUTH PUBLICLY, BROTHER. TELL THEM,
[1:23:22] "WELL, I BELIEVE I'M HEALED."
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; GOD IS MY HEALER. GOD IS MY SAVIOR. I
[1:23:30] DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE SEEKING THE BAPTISM
[1:23:31] OF THE HOLY GHOST. SAY, "I'VE GOT THE
[1:23:33] BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST." GOD'S GIVEN
[1:23:35] IT TO ME. IT'S RIGHTFULLY MINE.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE RIGHTEOUS, THEY TAKE IT BY
[1:23:40] FORCE.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; TAKE IT BY FORCE.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Take it. DON'T ASK THE DEVIL. THE DEVIL
[1:23:46] IS absolutely been stripped of ALL OF
[1:23:48] HIS POWER, ALL OF HIS AUTHORITY. HE
[1:23:51] CAN'T HAVE YOUR JOY. HE CAN'T HAVE YOUR
[1:23:53] PEACE. AMEN. IF HE'S TAKEN IT FROM YOU,
[1:23:55] YOU GOT TO GO AND TAKE IT BACK.
[1:24:01] COME ON.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; What does it THE DEVIL? BUT R SAYS
[1:24:05] FAITH. AMEN. IT'S NOT SOME meek thing,
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; IT'S BARELY. IT BEATS DOWN. DEVIL, I'MMA
[1:24:12] BEAT you down.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Beat him down.
[1:24:31] Well, that's usually about time we
[1:24:32] close. Y'all ready to close?
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; It goes fast when you're having a good
[1:24:37] time, don't it?
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; That's right. It goes fast.
[1:24:42] No. But how many is thankful
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; that
[1:24:48] this message that God brought us in this
[1:24:50] generation? How many knows that God
[1:24:52] before the foundation of the world in
[1:24:53] the Old Testament, he knew that we would
[1:24:56] get in this condition?
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; And that's WHY HE PUT IN MALACHI 4.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Can we go to a couple places like that?
[1:25:05] Would that be all right? I love this.
[1:25:11] Malachi 4 right quick if I can find it
[1:25:15] right here. I love these scriptures.
[1:25:18] Behold, the day cometh that shall burn
[1:25:20] as an oven, and all the proud and all
[1:25:22] that do wickedly shall be stubble, and
[1:25:24] the day that cometh shall burn them up,
[1:25:26] says the Lord of hosts. How many knows
[1:25:28] where at that day?
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; And it shall leave them neither root nor
[1:25:32] branch. But unto you
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; who FEAR MY NAME, SHALL THE SON OF
[1:25:37] RIGHTEOUSNESS ARISE
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; WITH HEALING.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Not just through BROTHER BRANDON, BUT
[1:25:42] HEALING TODAY.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE HE'S A HEALER TODAY?
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO DECLARE, AND WE LOVE IT, THAT
[1:25:48] GOD IS NOT DEAD. HE NEVER DID DIE. HE
[1:25:51] WENT ON THE CROSS, BUT THAT WAS HIS SON.
[1:25:53] AMEN. BUT HE'S NOT DEAD. HE'S ALIVE
[1:25:54] FOREVER MORE.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER.
[1:26:00] THAT EXCITES US. So the SON OF
[1:26:02] RIGHTEOUSNESS ARRIVED WITH HEALING IN
[1:26:04] HIS WINGS.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Oh man. Over in Ephesians, he says he
[1:26:09] ascended. He that ascended also
[1:26:11] descended far above the heavens that he
[1:26:12] might fill all things. And he gave some
[1:26:14] apostles and some prophets, evangelists,
[1:26:16] some pastors and teachers for the
[1:26:18] perfecting of the saints, for the
[1:26:20] working of the ministry, FOR THE
[1:26:21] EDIFYING OF THE BODY OF CHRIST TILL WE
[1:26:24] ALL COME into the unity of the faith AND
[1:26:25] OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE son of God AND
[1:26:28] TO A PERFECT MAN.
[1:26:32] HOW MANY IS DESIRING TO BE WHAT GOD
[1:26:34] THOUGHT OF YOU
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD?
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; LISTEN PEOPLE, WE'VE GOT A RESTORED
[1:26:41] WORD.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS RESTORED THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; BUT THAT DON'T mean you've been
[1:26:46] restored. But I want YOU TO KNOW IF
[1:26:48] YOU'LL TAKE THOSE WORDS, IF YOU'LL TAKE
[1:26:50] PAUL A PRISONER, THE STATURE OF A
[1:26:52] PERFECT MAN. AMEN. THE GREATEST BATTLE
[1:26:54] EVER FOUGHT. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT'S THE
[1:26:55] BRIDE'S DRESS WEAR? IT'S TIME TO GET OFF
[1:26:58] THE BOOKS AND ENTER THE HEART. AMEN.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO BE A I DON'T WANT TO BE
[1:27:04] A SHOULD BE.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; I DON'T want to be a wannabe. I want TO
[1:27:07] BE A BE. I AM.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; I AM WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; IT'S NO NEED TO BE DESIRING THOSE
[1:27:16] THINGS. THAT'S YOURS.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; You know, here's a pretty good
[1:27:20] revelation
[1:27:22] that I've said about that. Christ has
[1:27:26] already done it.
[1:27:29] Brother preached a message called he
[1:27:31] cares. Do you care?
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; In that message, he says he cared. Now
[1:27:35] he's waiting for you to care.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; He said he makes a statement, but you
[1:27:39] got to care first.

[1:27:58] children. AMEN. GOD CARED FOR THEM AND

[1:29:11] wind OF DOCTRINE BY THE SLIGHT OF men

[1:29:30] AND HE GOT HIS MESSAGE FROM TALKING TO A
[1:29:32] GIRL. AMEN. That was at a HOSPITAL DYING
[1:29:34] AND SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS OKAY. Remember
[1:29:36] that? Smoking a cigarette and everything
[1:29:38] else. Amen. And she said to him that
[1:29:40] that you know it's I just I I love the
[1:29:42] LORD BUT I JUST FIND IT SO HARD TO SERVE
[1:29:46] GOD. AND BROTHER B SAYS THAT OUGHT TO BE

[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:30:34] Let me uh go back for just a minute
[1:30:38] on this thought of letting things become
[1:30:42] common to you.
[1:30:45] Because we know a lot of the mysteries.
[1:30:49] Is that right?
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; We know a lot of the mysteries.
[1:30:54] We hear things so much. Let me just Can
[1:30:57] I just put it the way Brother Brandon
[1:30:58] put it? You know, I always tell my
[1:31:00] church, you know, it's it's one thing
[1:31:03] for me to say something, but when I read
[1:31:05] this,
[1:31:07] it's vindicated.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. To me, it's it's it's more than
[1:31:11] what I would say. That's why I like to
[1:31:13] read it.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Tell me the story again. How many love
[1:31:17] the stories?
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; So here's the story. Brother Bam says a
[1:31:21] long time. He says some time ago a man
[1:31:22] went uh was down by the sea went to the
[1:31:25] seaside. He was going over there to
[1:31:26] rest. He wanted to refresh himself. He
[1:31:28] loved the thought of to hearing those
[1:31:30] seagulls that flew over the water to
[1:31:32] skip down there and those waves coming
[1:31:34] in roared and busted in the air. He
[1:31:36] wanted to smell that salt water. He
[1:31:38] says, "It'll be such a rest to live by
[1:31:41] the so seashore a while. I just want to
[1:31:43] rest. I want to live by the seashore and
[1:31:45] see the sea of things and so what it has
[1:31:47] to offer. The blue sky reflect from the
[1:31:49] sky out of the water. The foam and so
[1:31:51] forth boil up." And he said, "If I can
[1:31:54] just look at that and hear that." And on
[1:31:56] his road down to the seashore, he met a
[1:31:58] man coming.
[1:32:00] He was an old salt and the old sailor
[1:32:02] from the sea. He says, "Where goest
[1:32:04] thou?" He said, "I'm go down to Seashore
[1:32:06] to enjoy the goodness of the sea." The
[1:32:09] old soul said, "I don't see nothing
[1:32:11] better good about it. The waters are
[1:32:13] just waters. The sky is just sky. The
[1:32:15] golf skull is just a a bird." You see,
[1:32:17] he had seen it so much until it become
[1:32:20] common to him. It wasn't thrilling to
[1:32:22] him anymore.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; That's what's the matter with people. He
[1:32:25] says, "YOU'VE SEEN THE GOODNESS AND THE
[1:32:27] MIRACLES AND THE DIVINE THINGS, AMEN, OF
[1:32:29] GOD, MOVING AND WORKING UNTIL IT BECOMES
[1:32:32] COMMON TO YOU. YOU DON'T NOTICE IT
[1:32:34] ANYMORE.
[1:32:35] AMEN. I've noticed in the meetings where
[1:32:37] THE LORD UNDER DISCERNMENT SPEAK RIGHT
[1:32:39] OUT IN THE AUDIENCE AS HE DID WHEN HE
[1:32:41] WALKED THE SHORES of Galilee and
[1:32:43] promised he said he would do it AGAIN
[1:32:44] AND PEOPLE THE FIRST TIME THEY SAY, "OH
[1:32:46] WOW, WAS THAT EVER A GOOD SERVICE." Oh
[1:32:49] man, that's got to be the Lord. AND THE
[1:32:51] NEXT TIME, WELL,
[1:32:53] I guess it's all right.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Now listen to this. It's common. It's
[1:33:00] passed over. You don't notice it
[1:33:02] anymore. The eyes of your understanding,
[1:33:04] your heart becomes closed to it. THE
[1:33:06] THRILL, THE BLESSEDNESS OF KNOWING, THE
[1:33:08] RISEN LORD JESUS STANDING IN OUR MIDST
[1:33:11] SHOULD SEND EVERY SOUL TO THE HEIGHTS
[1:33:13] BEYOND ANYTHING THIS WORLD COULD EVER
[1:33:14] THRILL. IT SHOULD DO SOMETHING FOR YOU.
[1:33:17] AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETIMES
[1:33:19] YOU'LL HEAR ANOINTED PREACHERS, YOUR
[1:33:21] PASTOR, BROTHER RON, BROTHER ANDREW,

[1:33:28] PREACHING. WE JUST SAID, "WELL, he's
[1:33:30] doing pretty good, I guess. Come on.

[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; We need to be like that little old lady
[1:33:39] THAT COME OUT OF THE MOUNTAINS. AMEN.
[1:33:40] WENT TO A BAPTIST CHURCH AND THE
[1:33:41] PREACHER SAYS, YOU KNOW, JESUS CHRIST
[1:33:43] CAME TO SAVE SINNERS AND SHE WENT,
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; "HALLELUJAH.
[1:33:48] THAT'S WHY I PREACH IT, BROTHER.
[1:33:50] WHY?" AMEN. THE AMAZING STORY OF GRACE.
[1:33:53] LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, BROTHER
[1:33:54] BAPTIST. WHEN YOU HEAR ME, WHEN I'M OVER
[1:33:55] THERE WAY DOWN IN THE HOLLER SOMEWHERE,
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; ISN'T THAT RIGHT? WHEN YOU HEAR SOMEBODY
[1:34:00] SINGING, "AMAZING GRACE, HOW SWEET THE
[1:34:02] SOUND THAT SAVED THE RICH. OH, BROTHER
[1:34:04] BANNON MADE IT." WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE
[1:34:06] SINGING, "OH, THE SEVEN SEALS OF GREAT
[1:34:08] MISERY." NO, WE'RE GOING TO SING ABOUT
[1:34:09] THE GRACE OF ALMIGHTY GOD.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Amazing grace.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; all right, we got a few people that come
[1:34:33] from where I come from. And this is my
[1:34:35] word to you. If you can see this
[1:34:38] message,
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; if you can believe that God sent a
[1:34:40] prophet,
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; you ought to give God praise.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; CUZ JESUS SAID, "THOSE PEOPLE OUT THERE,
[1:34:46] THE PHARISEES, THEY HAVE EYES, BUT THEY
[1:34:48] SEE NOT. THEY HAVE EARS, BUT THEY HEAR
[1:34:50] NOT. BUT BLESSED ARE YOUR EYES. BLESSED
[1:34:53] ARE YOUR EARS, BECAUSE THEY CAN RECEIVE
[1:34:56] THE THINGS OF GOD.
[1:34:58] HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:00] HOW MANY'S BLESSED? WE'RE ALL blessed
[1:35:03] because we can see the THINGS OF GOD.
[1:35:05] GOD HAS OPENED OUR EYES. WE SAY, "THANK
[1:35:07] YOU, JESUS.
[1:35:09] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 10,000
[1:35:12] YEARS FROM NOW, I'M GOING TO BE DANCING.
[1:35:14] I'M GOING TO BE SHOUTING. I'M GOING TO
[1:35:16] BE SAYING, "THANK YOU, LORD."
[1:35:20] It was amazing.
[1:35:23] AMAZING.
[1:35:25] AMAZING THAT HE THOUGHT OF ME BEFORE THE
[1:35:28] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Chose me
[1:35:33] BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Never let the simple gospel,
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; the simple message of grace and faith.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:53] Don't let it become common.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; No, it's precious.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; It's precious.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; How many believe faith is precious?
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; You see, you are saved by grace.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; But how? But how?
[1:36:15] Through faith.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Through faith.
[1:36:18] And that not what you mustered up, not
[1:36:22] what you tried, BUT THE BIBLE SAYS IN
[1:36:25] FACT THAT BY THE GIFT OF GOD,
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; THAT FAITH THAT WAS GIVEN YOU TO
[1:36:29] BELIEVE.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Thank you, Jesus.

[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; for you to believe.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Others are happy. Others are
[1:36:43] happy DRINKING FROM A STAGNATED
[1:36:44] FOUNTAIN. THEY'RE HAPPY DRINKING FROM A
[1:36:47] MAN-MADE SYSTEM.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE HAPPY WITH WIGGLE TAILS IN IT.
[1:36:51] THEY'RE HAPPY WITH GREEN MOSS
[1:36:52] EVERYWHERE. BUT NOT ME.

[1:36:57] here, YOU WANT SOMETHING FRESH. YOU WANT
[1:36:59] THE FRESH GOOD WORD OF GOD. BUBBLING UP.

[1:38:10] come down from heaven having great
[1:38:12] power, and the earth was lightened with
[1:38:15] his glory.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; How many believe this? Isaiah 6, HE

[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "Did you ever meet
[1:41:22] somebody that went into the Holies of
[1:41:23] Holies?"
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; It can be a cloudy day. It can be
[1:41:28] trials, tribulation,
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; and all those things, but yet they're

[1:43:11] MY GRANDKIDS want me to be quiet. I SAY,
[1:43:14] "PRAISE THE LORD.

[1:43:36] these. Just a few notes.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; You know, that's when the Holy Spirit
[1:43:40] really comes.

[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; I like when he comes and he just stops
[1:43:43] you at the second bird. Word. Not bird.
[1:43:47] It's a word.

[1:43:58] Ron. And they love the brothers.

[1:44:12] Christ. That's all I want to do is tell
[1:44:14] you how much I love him with all my
[1:44:17] heart, with all my soul, WITH ALL MY
[1:44:19] STRENGTH. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT WAS THE
[1:44:20] FIRST COMMANDMENT AND he never could do
[1:44:22] it? A lot of people don't do it. But how
[1:44:25] MANY BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT THE CHURCH IS

[1:44:34] OF OUR SOUL, ALL OF OUR STRENGTH. WE
[1:44:36] LOVE HIM.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; And uh and he cried, HIS ANGEL DID,
[1:44:45] MIGHTILY WITH A STRONG VOICE, SAYING,
[1:44:48] "The Pentecostals are dead,
[1:44:51] the Methodists are dead, the Baptists
[1:44:53] are dead." I MEAN, THOSE HE DECLARED,
[1:44:55] "THOSE CHURCHES ARE DEAD. AMEN.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; THEY HAVE REJECTED THE VERY ONE THAT
[1:45:00] THEY CAME TO BELIEVE 2,000 YEARS AGO.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE COME HERE AND DOES THE SAME
[1:45:04] THING, THEY REJECT HIM.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE CHRIST. NO, YOU
[1:45:10] REJECT HIM WHEN HE COMES AND DOES THE
[1:45:11] VERY SAME THINGS.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; HAS HIS PICTURE TAKEN AND EVERYTHING
[1:45:15] ELSE.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; AIN'T THAT RIGHT?
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; WHOA.
[1:45:20] I SAY WOE TO PEOPLE THAT GET CAUGHT UP
[1:45:25] in not believing that the prophet is the
[1:45:27] prophet anymore.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS ONCE YOU'RE ENLIGHTENED
[1:45:30] AND HAVE TASTED OF IT AND YOU TURN AWAY,
[1:45:33] HE SAYS, "BROTHER BAM SAYS YOU'RE GONE.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GONE.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO MORE REMISSION FOR SUCH
[1:45:41] SINS."
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY GLAD THAT GOD KEEPS YOU?
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; WE AIN'T GOT AN EXPERIENCE ON OUR FLESH
[1:45:48] AND IN OUR SPIRIT. THAT'S THE KIND OF
[1:45:50] PEOPLE THAT CAN GO. BUT NO, THE ONES
[1:45:52] THAT'S IN THE SOUTH, YOU CAN'T BE LOST.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; NO, you cannot disbelieve God's word.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; I want to get to the verse here for
[1:46:03] people JUST COMING OUT. MAN, BABYLON THE
[1:46:06] GREAT IS FALLEN IS FALLEN and has become
[1:46:09] the habitation of devils.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Bam said, "You have
[1:46:14] hateful spirits and the hole OF EVERY
[1:46:17] FOUL SPIRIT, THE CAGE of every unclean
[1:46:19] and hateful bird.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; All the nations have drunk
[1:46:24] of putting their own interpretation,
[1:46:26] their own ideas
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; with the word of God.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; You could do that in days past and God
[1:46:31] would weaken your ignorance. But once
[1:46:33] the pure word is restored, you can't do
[1:46:36] that anymore. Once you know the
[1:46:38] revelation OF WATER BAPTISM THAT NOBODY
[1:46:40] WAS BAPTIZED IN THE TITLES THEY ALWAYS
[1:46:42] USE THE NAME. YOU DON'T HAVE TO revel
[1:46:45] have to have a revelation for that.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; IT'S AS PLAIN AS THE DAY.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU WILLFULLY TURN FROM THE TRUTH.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; You better watch out.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:57] And the nations have drunk of the wine
[1:46:58] of the wrath of her fornication. And the
[1:47:00] kings of the earth have committed
[1:47:01] fornication with her. The merchants of
[1:47:03] the earth have waxed rich through
[1:47:04] abundance of her delicacies. And I heard
[1:47:06] another angel, another voice FROM HEAVEN
[1:47:09] SCREAMING, "COME OUT! GET OUT OF THERE
[1:47:13] BEFORE YOU CATCHING THE MARK OF THE
[1:47:14] BEAST."
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; IT'S A MARK OF THE BEAST. COME OUT.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; You're looking at a COME OUT PERSON. I'M
[1:47:22] LOOKING AT A COME OUT CROWD THAT HAS
[1:47:25] COME OUT OF THAT DENOMINATIONAL SYSTEM.
[1:47:28] HURRY, HURRY. QUICKLY, QUICKLY. GET OUT
[1:47:31] OF THERE FAST.
[1:47:35] come
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; and become his bride.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; How many wants to become his bride?
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to make a long story short.
[1:47:50] I believe that this message was sent to
[1:47:54] get a bride ready.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Probably God said, "I'm dressing the
[1:47:58] bride."
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; Wasn't he dressing the bride? How many
[1:48:01] believes it's the word that dresses
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; the bride?
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; He talked about how filthy she is. How
[1:48:09] she's committed fornications. She don't
[1:48:11] care what the word of God says. My
[1:48:13] church teaches different fornication.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; My church teaches don't teach that.
[1:48:19] Well, does the Bible say it? And if it
[1:48:21] does, fornication.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; God has a right to put you away.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU THAT HAS RECEIVED IT. All right.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Can I give you some news? You that have
[1:48:32] received it.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; I love this quote.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; THIS IS MY MESSAGE TO CHURCH now as we
[1:48:38] go off the air. HE SAYS, "IF YOU'RE
[1:48:40] STANDING, YOU'RE STANDING ON GOD'S WORD
[1:48:42] AND WITH GOD'S WORD EVERY AMEN."
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT AS WE GO ON, WE
[1:48:47] HAVE TO SAY, "GOD, TAKE ALL DOUBT OUT OF
[1:48:49] MY LIFE."
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; LORD, THIS DOESN'T LINE UP WITH THE
[1:48:52] MESSAGE. TAKE IT OUT. THAT DON'T LINE UP
[1:48:54] WITH THE MESSAGE. TAKE IT OUT.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE YOU'RE NEVER REALLY
[1:48:57] ENTITLED TO THE TOKEN UNTIL YOU COME TO
[1:48:59] FULL OBEDIENCE TO THE WORD OF GOD. WE'LL
[1:49:02] NEVER BE 100% BLESSED UNTIL YOU YIELD
[1:49:04] COMPLETELY TO THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; OH, I SAY THIS. AMEN. GOD HELP US. I
[1:49:11] believe THAT GOD THROUGH A PROPHET OF
[1:49:12] BROTHER BRANDHAM BROUGHT A SON OF GOD TO
[1:49:14] MATURITY.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; SO MUCH SO HE COULD TELL DIDN'T TELL HIM
[1:49:18] what to say. TELL THAT YOUNG COUPLE OUT
[1:49:20] THERE THAT'S BASICALLY MAKING LOVE ON
[1:49:21] THE FRONT PEW. TELL THEM WHATEVER YOU
[1:49:23] SAY TO THEM, IT'LL BE THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; And what did he say? You know, as an
[1:49:32] asan as fire was, how many know he could
[1:49:35] have spoken death to him?
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; They could have dropped that.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; But no, he had Christ's spirit on the
[1:49:40] inside. He says, "I forgive you for
[1:49:42] that." And he said the right word. God
[1:49:45] could trust him with speaking to the
[1:49:47] storm. He could talk to the bull, the
[1:49:49] hornets, speak the word. I don't know
[1:49:51] about you, Lord. Help me to come to
[1:49:52] maturity to where my things when things
[1:49:54] come up no matter what the situation is
[1:49:57] you can say like Billy Paul about his
[1:49:58] dad the one thing about him he could
[1:50:00] control every situation.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; All right I'm reading this to you.
[1:50:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:50:12] So he says
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; thank you.
[1:50:19] Amen.
[1:50:21] This is my message to you. Resting.
[1:50:23] Amen. You're every amen,
[1:50:25] EVERY JOT, EVERY TIT. Where are you
[1:50:29] standing? I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU, PULL
[1:50:31] AWAY FROM THEM SHUCKS out there. You
[1:50:33] won't never get perfect out there.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Get in here where you CAN GET RIPE
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE SUN. HOW MANY KNOW THE DEVIL
[1:50:41] AND HIS CHILDREN, THEY'RE GETTING RIPE.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; GOD AND HIS CHURCH, YOU, WE'RE GETTING
[1:50:47] RIPE.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; WE'RE GETTING READY. WE'VE GOT TO BE
[1:50:50] READY.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; And you listen, I can hear the COMBINE
[1:50:54] COMING. YOU'RE STANDING COMPLETE,
[1:50:56] JUSTIFIED AS THOUGH YOU NEVER DONE IT IN
[1:50:59] THE FIRST PLACE.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU ARE THE PURE, VIRTUOUS,
[1:51:04] SINLESS BRIDE OF THE SON OF THE LIVING
[1:51:07] GOD. I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT THIS MESSAGE IS
[1:51:09] TO DO. IT'S TO BRING US TO PENTEST 100%
[1:51:12] PURE AND SPOTLESS,
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; In closing, I want to say this.
[1:51:20] I want to tell you about somebody that
[1:51:23] came back from heaven to apologize.
[1:51:26] Somebody came back from heaven to
[1:51:29] apologize
[1:51:30] for some little thing they had done. You
[1:51:34] know who that was?
[1:51:36] Sister Hope.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; Remember his wife? Why did you call me
[1:51:40] back? Why did you call ME BACK IN SUCH A
[1:51:43] BEAUTIFUL PLACE? BUT I want to tell you
[1:51:45] something.
[1:51:46] I want to tell you something. REMEMBER
[1:51:48] WHEN I TOLD YOU TO GO GET THOSE
[1:51:49] STOCKINGS? And I didn't look it up, but
[1:51:51] it was two different kind of stockings.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; And he forgot what IT WAS AND HE GOT THE
[1:51:55] WRONG KIND. He says, "I never told you
[1:51:58] that that was the wrong kind." CAN YOU
[1:52:00] IMAGINE COMING BACK FROM HEAVEN and
[1:52:02] having that one little thing?
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Just want to make sure it's right.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; How many wants to be that way? So, God
[1:52:07] help me.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Stand with me this night if you will.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:52:15] We won't have an altar call, but I do
[1:52:18] want to pray for you. Amen.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; I want you to search your heart. Close
[1:52:23] your eyes. Bow your head. Search your
[1:52:25] heart. Ask yourself, are you ready to go
[1:52:28] if he comes tonight yet? Have you still
[1:52:31] got things in your life that you know
[1:52:32] isn't right? You know you need to make
[1:52:35] them right and you want to be pure
[1:52:37] before God. You'd raise your hand and
[1:52:38] say, "Brother Ber, I'll be honest.
[1:52:42] I want to be right with God. I'm not
[1:52:43] just exactly where I want to be,
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; but I want to be that much. I want to be
[1:52:47] that sensitive to everything that I do
[1:52:49] to make sure that it's right. God, help
[1:52:51] me never to complain, never to murmur.
[1:52:53] God don't like those things. He loves
[1:52:55] for you to be content. Like Paul says, I
[1:52:57] have learned whether I am full or
[1:52:59] whether I'm in in need. I have learned
[1:53:01] to be content. Having food and
[1:53:04] raignment, let us be content. Amen.
[1:53:06] You're content when you have Christ. If
[1:53:08] you have a roof over your head and shoes
[1:53:10] on your feet, let's pray. Lord Jesus, as
[1:53:12] our hands go up, Lord, and we come
[1:53:14] before you now and we ask, God, that
[1:53:16] you'll come down into our hearts and our
[1:53:17] souls, Lord, and Father, if we have
[1:53:20] taken something from the neighbor, our
[1:53:21] tool or so to speak, something small
[1:53:23] like that, Lord, and we just haven't
[1:53:25] made it right, God, we raise our hands
[1:53:27] and say, God, forgive us. If I've done
[1:53:29] wrong, I want to be right. I want to be
[1:53:31] your bride. I want to be the way that
[1:53:32] you want me to be, Lord, so that I don't
[1:53:34] have to worry. I don't have any fear. I
[1:53:36] don't have to have any condemnation in
[1:53:38] my heart. And so tonight I ask God that
[1:53:40] you'll touch every hand that has went
[1:53:42] up. Lord, may they go out those double
[1:53:45] doors different than what they have come
[1:53:47] in. Lord, Father, now we put God
[1:53:50] everything of our past in the sea of his
[1:53:52] forgetfulness. And we under put it under
[1:53:55] the blood and we ask you to forgive us.
[1:53:57] Make us better Christians for you. Amen.
[1:54:01] God bless you. I would like to ask you
[1:54:02] one more one more question if you would
[1:54:06] just a second on the music. One more
[1:54:08] question.
[1:54:09] 2025 is past, isn't it?
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; A lot of us maybe have regrets.
[1:54:15] And there's this saying, isn't it, that
[1:54:18] you can't change the past. You can't
[1:54:21] change the past.
[1:54:25] I was praying about that. You can't
[1:54:26] change the past. But you know that ain't
[1:54:29] true.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; How many believe that's not true?
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; That's not true.
[1:54:36] Because I'm telling you right now, as
[1:54:39] long as he's on the mercy seat,
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; as long as HE'S ON THE MERCY SEAT AND
[1:54:44] YOU DROP THAT AND YOU ASK him to forgive
[1:54:46] you,
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING OF 2025, EVERYTHING YOU DONE
[1:54:49] WRONG, HOW MANY BELIEVE YOU CAN CHANGE
[1:54:51] THAT, YOU CAN ERASE THAT BY THE BLOOD OF
[1:54:54] JESUS CHRIST.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, JESUS.
[1:55:07] Not only that, remember that 80year-old
[1:55:09] atheist brother Brandham led to the led
[1:55:11] to Christ with an apple.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Led him to Christ with a apple.
[1:55:16] What what power tells that sap to go
[1:55:18] back down in that tree. Amen. And that
[1:55:20] man was an atheist. And he was 80 YEARS
[1:55:24] OF DEFYING GOD, SAYING THAT THEY WERE
[1:55:27] BARKING UP THE TREE. A LION DOG HE
[1:55:29] CALLED PREACHERS.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; But 80 years of sin, 80 YEARS OF
[1:55:36] WRONGDOING.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE CONFESSED IT AND MAKE IT RIGHT,
[1:55:40] IT WAS ALL WASHED AWAY.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; When brother Ben WENT BEYOND THE CURTAIN
[1:55:47] OF TIME and he said a certain sister
[1:55:50] come up and hugged him and he said,
[1:55:52] "Remember that sister?
[1:55:54] Remember her?" "No, I don't remember
[1:55:56] her." He says, "You should. She was past
[1:55:58] 80 or 90
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; when you led her to Christ.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe God can erase all
[1:56:05] the past?
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, if you follow
[1:56:07] Christ, you have a word that your past,
[1:56:09] it's though you never done it in the
[1:56:12] FIRST PLACE.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; I LIKE THAT OFF THE SHELF. GET THAT OFF
[1:56:15] THE SHELF. I'LL TAKE THAT. I'LL ENJOY
[1:56:18] THAT. IT'S things that I like. THOSE ARE
[1:56:21] THE THINGS I LIKE.
[1:56:25] I CAN BE HAPPY. YOU CAN BE HAPPY. YOU
[1:56:28] OUGHT TO BE THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE ON THE
[1:56:30] FACE OF THE EARTH OR IN THE UNIVERSE.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; God bless you richly. Isn't God good?
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. All my life you have been
[1:56:42] faithful.
[1:56:46] And all my life you have been
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; so good.
[1:56:54] with every grace that I am in.
[1:57:01] God bless you.
[1:57:04] Oh my goodness. God bless you, brother.
[1:57:06] Love you, my friend. Thank you.

[1:57:53] Oh, you have led me through the fire
[1:58:00] in the darkest time.
[1:58:03] For you are close like no other.
[1:58:09] Well, I've known you as a father.
[1:58:15] I've known you as my friend.
[1:58:20] I have live
[1:58:23] in the goodness
[1:58:25] of God.
[1:58:31] Oh, and all my life you have been
[1:58:35] faithful.
[1:58:41] Oh, and all my life you have been so so
[1:58:47] good
[1:58:50] with every breath that I am made. Oh,
[1:58:58] I will sing
[1:59:01] of the goodness
[1:59:03] of God. I love you, Lord.
[1:59:07] I love you, Lord.
[1:59:12] Oh, for your mercy never fails me.
[1:59:19] Oh, all my days
[1:59:22] I've been held in your hand.
[1:59:29] Moment that I wake up
[1:59:34] until I lay my hand.
[1:59:38] I will sing
[1:59:41] of the goodness
[1:59:44] of God.
[1:59:50] Oh, and all my life you have been
[1:59:54] faithful.
[1:59:59] Oh, and all my life you have been so so
[2:00:06] good
[2:00:09] with every breath that I am made.
[2:00:15] Oh, I will sing
[2:00:19] of the goodness
[2:00:22] of God.
[2:00:26] Your goodness is running after.
[2:00:29] It's running after me.
[2:00:35] Cuz your goodness is running after. It's
[2:00:39] running after me.
[2:00:43] With my life laid down, I surrender now.
[2:00:48] I give you everything
[2:00:54] cuz your goodness is running after.
[2:00:58] It's running after me.
[2:01:04] All my life you have been faith.
[2:01:14] All my life you have been so so good.
[2:01:23] With every breath that I am able,
[2:01:30] I will sing
[2:01:33] of the goodness
[2:01:36] of God all my life.
[2:01:43] All my life.
[2:01:48] All my life.
[2:01:52] And all my life you have been so so
[2:01:58] good.
[2:02:02] With every breath that I am able,
[2:02:09] I will sing
[2:02:12] of the goodness
[2:02:15] of God.
[2:02:17] You deserve the glory
[2:02:22] and the honor.
[2:02:27] Oh Lord, we lift our hands in worship
[2:02:32] as we praise your holy name. And you
[2:02:37] deserve the glory
[2:02:42] and the honor.
[2:02:47] Lord, we lift our hands in worship
[2:02:53] as we praise your holy name. For you are
[2:02:58] great.
[2:03:01] You do miracles
[2:03:03] so great.
[2:03:06] There is no one else like you.
[2:03:12] Oh, there is no one else like you.
[2:03:17] For you are great.
[2:03:20] You do miracles
[2:03:23] so great.
[2:03:26] There is no one else like you.
[2:03:32] Oh, there is no one
[2:03:36] else like you
[2:03:42] and you deserve the glory.
[2:03:47] and the honor.
[2:03:52] Lord, we lift our hands to worship
[2:03:58] as we praise your holy name.
[2:04:02] You deserve the glory.

[2:06:03] to the promise
[2:06:06] I have.
[2:06:08] in you.
[2:06:12] Oh my Jesus,
[2:06:17] my savior.
[2:06:20] Oh Lord, there is none
[2:06:24] like you.
[2:06:27] Oh my days.
[2:06:32] Oh, I want to praise
[2:06:37] the wonders of your mind.
[2:06:42] Oh, your mighty love.
[2:06:50] My father,

[2:06:58] the tower of refuge
[2:07:03] strength.
[2:07:05] Oh, let me bring.
[2:07:09] Oh, all that I am.
[2:07:14] Oh, never see.

[2:07:29] Hallelujah.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. Sing it with all that's
[2:07:33] within you.
[2:07:43] Hallelujah.
[2:07:53] At the sh
[2:07:58] of your name.
[2:08:03] Oh, I sing for joy
[2:08:07] at the work of your hands.
[2:08:14] Is that your song? Is that your
[2:08:16] testimony?
[2:08:20] Nothing,
[2:08:22] nothing compares
[2:08:25] to
[2:08:31] you.
[2:08:34] It's a play song. I never lost my praise
[2:08:36] in KFC.
[2:08:39] I I don't know. I don't know who who was
[2:08:43] ever in many of the camps when we were
[2:08:46] younger. I know there's a selection of
[2:08:50] of the believers here in this corner
[2:08:52] about about my age that went to camps.
[2:08:56] I I sat over there and I just
[2:09:02] just cried my eyes out
[2:09:04] just thinking
[2:09:07] I saw I I just I know for any of us we
[2:09:11] saw a flashback tonight
[2:09:15] because the same message that stirred
[2:09:17] Brother Tom 20 some years ago is the
[2:09:20] same message that is still doing it
[2:09:22] right now.
[2:09:26] Nothing changed.
[2:09:31] Nothing changed.
[2:09:33] People may have went one way and people
[2:09:35] may have went another way, but the
[2:09:37] message was ALWAYS
[2:09:39] ALWAYS OUR JOY. IT WAS ALWAYS, IT WAS
[2:09:43] ALWAYS WHAT KEPT US as believers.
[2:09:49] Hallelujah.
[2:09:52] There was a reason and you can ask any
[2:09:54] of us, anybody that was back there when
[2:09:56] we was back there when we was when we
[2:09:59] was the kids at the camps. There was two
[2:10:01] guys that I was that was our favorite
[2:10:03] preachers that we wanted to preach camp
[2:10:06] and it was brother Ron Spencer and
[2:10:07] brother Tom Ber. You can ask my wife
[2:10:09] right there cuz you know good and well
[2:10:11] you was going to hear the message and
[2:10:13] you was going to leave there bubbling
[2:10:15] full of joy. and I'd say a full gospel
[2:10:18] lighthouse.
[2:10:24] But this song kept resonating in my
[2:10:26] heart.
[2:10:29] This song, oh I lost some blessings.
[2:10:35] Let's go. Let's go to the very first
[2:10:36] verse. Oh,
[2:10:39] I've lost some good friends
[2:10:43] long away.
[2:10:47] Some loved ones departed
[2:10:51] in heaven this day. But thank God I
[2:10:56] didn't lose everything.
[2:11:03] Well, I've lost faith in people
[2:11:07] who said they care.
[2:11:11] In the time of my crisis,
[2:11:15] they were never there.
[2:11:20] But in my disappointment,
[2:11:24] in my season
[2:11:26] of pain,
[2:11:28] oh, one thing never wavered,
[2:11:32] one thing never changed.
[2:11:39] Well, I never lost my hope.
[2:11:45] Oh, and I never lost my joy.
[2:11:54] Oh, and I never lost my faith.
[2:11:59] Oh, one more so far.
[2:12:03] I never lost my praise.
[2:12:09] Well, I've let some blessings.
[2:12:13] I let them slip away.
[2:12:18] When I lost my focus
[2:12:22] and went a straight, but thank God I
[2:12:28] didn't lose everything.
[2:12:35] Well, I lost positions
[2:12:39] that were so dear
[2:12:43] and I lost some battles
[2:12:47] by walking in fear.
[2:12:51] But in the midst of my struggles, oh in
[2:12:56] the season of my pain,
[2:13:00] well, one thing never wavered,
[2:13:04] one thing never change.
[2:13:10] That I never lost my home.
[2:13:17] Oh, and I never lost my joy.
[2:13:26] Oh,
[2:13:27] I never lost my faith.
[2:13:31] Oh, God.
[2:13:33] Oh, somebody say, "Well, I never lost my
[2:13:38] hope."
[2:13:41] Oh, come on, somebody sing it. Oh, I
[2:13:44] never look that devil in your eyes and
[2:13:48] say, "I never lost it."
[2:13:52] And I never lost my I never lost it. I
[2:13:57] never lost it. I never lost it. I never
[2:14:02] lost my faith.
[2:14:05] But most of
[2:14:09] I never lost my praise.
[2:14:16] Oh,
[2:14:17] I never lost my I never lost.
[2:14:23] Come on, somebody. Oh, I never lost my
[2:14:28] joy.
[2:14:32] Lord,
[2:14:34] I never lost my faith.
[2:14:48] Hallelujah.
[2:14:50] Hallelujah.
[2:14:52] Hallelujah.
[2:14:58] I never lost it. It may have LOOKED LIKE
[2:15:01] IT. I may have looked down. I MAY HAVE
[2:15:04] LOOKED LIKE I WAS IN THE VALLEY, DOWN ON
[2:15:06] THE MOUNTAIN, UP ON HERE, BUT I NEVER
[2:15:08] LOST IT. Come on, SOMEBODY. I MAY HAVE
[2:15:10] BEEN IN SOME TRIALS. I MAY HAVE BEEN IN
[2:15:13] A BATTLE, BUT I NEVER LOST IT. I NEVER
[2:15:16] LOST my hope. I never lost my hope in
[2:15:18] this message. I never lost my joy.
[2:15:23] I STILL GOT MY JOY.
[2:15:26] I still got my joy.
[2:15:30] I still got it.
[2:15:33] That's why we ought to be the most
[2:15:35] happiest people on the earth. I got my
[2:15:38] joy
[2:15:40] and I got my joy shoes on.
[2:15:44] Anybody got their joy shoes on tonight?
[2:15:49] Well, go ahead and dance on them joy
[2:15:51] shoes just for a minute.
[2:15:56] Go ahead.
[2:15:58] Go ahead.
[2:15:59] The message gave you a right TO PUT YOUR
[2:16:02] JOY SHOES back home.
[2:16:06] MAYBE YOU STEPPED OUT OF THEM FOR A
[2:16:08] MINUTE, BUT JUST STEP RIGHT BACK IN.
[2:16:12] YOU'LL FIND OUT THE SHOE STILL FITS.
[2:16:19] Come on, somebody. You didn't CHANGE
[2:16:22] SIZES. YOU JUST STEPPED OUT OF THE SHOE.
[2:16:25] Let's step back in.
[2:16:30] I say put your joy shoes on.
[2:16:34] Well, if you got joy shoes on, then you
[2:16:37] better get ready to dance. You better be
[2:16:39] ready to run. You better ready to leap.
[2:16:48] If this message will put that kind of a
[2:16:51] joy inside of a 64 year old man,
[2:16:56] what ought it to do to you young boys?
[2:16:59] How many of you boys got your joy shoes
[2:17:01] on?
[2:17:08] Hey, we used to sing that song.
