[39:00] God we have we've handled him amen if
[39:05] you have your Bibles today we' like to
[39:06] look over in the Book of Ecclesiastes

[40:11] that you'd like to make known unto the
[40:13] Lord amen we don't ask these things out
[40:16] of tradition but we ask these things
[40:19] because we realize that they we are a
[40:21] very needy people we realize that we are
[40:24] coming before the king of kings in these
[40:26] moments and we realize that he hears our
[40:29] very heart's cry so we don't do this out
[40:31] of tradition but we ask it because we
[40:33] serve a God that sees all things and we
[40:36] are holding fast our confession that he
[40:38] is our high priest and I know that he's
[40:40] able to reach unto the uttermost parts
[40:42] of the world and touch your life in a
[40:44] very special way and that's that's what
[40:46] we want here today is that the king
[40:48] would come and touch us in a very
[40:50] special way I believe today is going to
[40:51] be a very special day in the Lord so
[40:53] let's just let's just bind our hearts
[40:55] together tonight this morning and just
[40:58] just begin to think upon the word of the
[41:00] Lord and ask him to come and minister to

[41:33] same but what changes is not you Lord

[41:57] almighty God now Lord I I know that
[41:59] there are congregants that are at home
[42:01] that are streaming that need a touch
[42:03] from you and we ask God that you would
[42:04] be merciful unto them this morning now
[42:07] father as we prepare to get oursel out
[42:09] of the way and to study Thy word we ask
[42:12] God that the author of the word would
[42:13] take position today that you would be

[42:20] would receive something from yourself oh
[42:22] God in our vessels Lord that would make
[42:24] us more like you in every way I pray
[42:27] that you would demonstrate who you are
[42:30] through the Church of the Living God
[42:31] today as we yield our vessels to you we
[42:34] are going to be careful to look for you
[42:36] today so we invite you just now to take
[42:39] this service we give you Full O we give
[42:42] you full obedience and as we sacrifice
[42:44] ourself over to you may you just come in
[42:48] the name of Jesus Christ amen amen
[42:53] Ecclesiastes chapter 8 and verse 4 says
[42:57] that where the word of a king is there
[43:00] is power and who may say unto him what
[43:04] doest thou Revelations chapter 3 and
[43:08] verse
[43:11] 20 I know that you all are aware of what
[43:15] is taking place in Los Angeles in
[43:18] Hollywood and we have received a a
[43:21] prophet's message in this day that told
[43:23] us that these things would come to pass
[43:28] there are there are believers in that
[43:30] city as well and we know that God is not
[43:33] going to he's not going to allow
[43:35] anything to happen to his children well
[43:38] you say well brother Andrew what about
[43:40] those people there in Los Angeles those
[43:42] Believers will what will happen the same
[43:44] thing that'll happen to you will happen
[43:45] to them we'll be caught up in a moment
[43:47] in the twinkling of an eye it doesn't
[43:49] matter where you are it doesn't matter
[43:51] what country you're from we are serving
[43:52] a God of all lands right so we want to
[43:55] be remembering remember than that we we
[43:59] we love people that we love people it
[44:02] doesn't matter what their name is it
[44:03] doesn't matter their background we love
[44:05] people and so in our hearts it it makes
[44:09] us groan for the coming of the Lord to
[44:11] see these things amen Revelations
[44:13] chapter 3 and verse 20 and we realize
[44:16] that this this book of Revelation has
[44:18] depicted unto us the the thermostat of
[44:21] this age that you and I are living in
[44:24] but in verse 20 it says behold I stand
[44:27] stand at the door and knock not any
[44:29] other age was he standing on the outside
[44:32] but on this age this church world has
[44:34] kicked him out and knock and if any man
[44:37] hear my voice and open the door I will
[44:40] come into him and will sh with him and
[44:43] he with me to him that overcometh will I
[44:45] grant to sit with me in my throne even
[44:49] as I also overcame and am sat down with
[44:52] my father in his throne he that hath an
[44:55] ear let him hear what the the spirit
[44:57] saith unto the churches and as you go
[44:59] down to Revelations chapter 4 we realize
[45:03] that the reward that is upon the
[45:05] believer in this generation or upon this
[45:07] church age we realize that the reward is
[45:10] to set upon the throne or set in the
[45:12] Throne of those that overcome the age
[45:15] that is their reward verse verse one of
[45:18] chapter 4 says after this I looked and
[45:21] behold a door was opened in heaven and
[45:23] the first voice which I heard was as it
[45:26] were of the trumpet talking with me
[45:28] which said come up hither and I will
[45:30] show thee things which must be Hereafter
[45:33] and immediately I was in the spirit and
[45:36] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[45:39] one sat on the throne if you book if you
[45:41] look in the Book of Daniel you will see
[45:43] there was no one in on the throne then
[45:46] but you see now he has taken possession
[45:49] of that throne and he that set was
[45:52] looked was to look upon as as like
[45:54] Jasper and a Sardis Stone and there was
[45:57] a rainbow round about the throne and
[46:00] inside like unto an emerald and round
[46:03] about The Throne were four and 20 seats
[46:06] and upon the seats I saw four and 20
[46:09] Elders sitting clothed in white rment
[46:12] and they had on their heads crowns of
[46:15] gold may God bless his word you may be
[46:17] seated today in the presence of the Lord
[46:20] by the help of the Lord I'd like to
[46:22] speak to you on a on a subject today on
[46:25] the Kings the the king's domain and
[46:28] we've been on this thought about our our
[46:31] king and the demand of a king for quite
[46:33] some time and we realize that studying
[46:35] out these things that you begin to look
[46:37] throughout history and you will see that
[46:39] Earthly Kings have risen and they have
[46:42] fallen but there is only one king whose
[46:45] Throne is eternal and that's King Jesus
[46:48] Christ that rules in righteousness and
[46:51] in truth and in power and as we read
[46:53] last evening of Zechariah Chapter 14-9
[46:56] the the Lord shall be king over all the
[46:59] Earth in that day there shall be one
[47:01] Lord and his name one now when you begin
[47:05] to think about this thought of a domain
[47:07] you begin to look at it at a king's
[47:09] domain it refers to a certain a certain
[47:13] geographical area or a a a realm or his
[47:17] territory over which a king begins to
[47:20] exercise his authority his Rule and he
[47:23] governs the people in that land when you
[47:25] look at this a king's domain that King's
[47:28] domain it encompasses both physical
[47:31] lands and it also encompasses the people
[47:35] that are under that King's jurisdiction
[47:37] and you begin to look at it maybe in a
[47:39] broader sense it signifies the influence
[47:42] that that King has it signifies the
[47:45] power that that King has and the
[47:47] responsibility that that King has
[47:49] throughout that entirety of that realm
[47:51] now just to begin to visualize just for
[47:54] a minute a kingdom where where the Kings
[47:57] word is law we live in America where we
[47:59] don't have a king over us but we are
[48:00] under we are under a political reign of
[48:03] a of a president but in in Worlds where
[48:06] there is still kingdoms where kings are
[48:09] still in position that King his word is
[48:12] law you see and when that King begins to
[48:15] make a decree it's written maybe out on
[48:18] a scroll and in in older times you would
[48:20] see it as it would be ritten out in a
[48:22] scroll on a scroll and then that king
[48:25] would take his his ring or his Insignia
[48:28] and he would place his seal upon that
[48:30] scroll now that seal meant something to
[48:32] the people that was carrying that
[48:34] message because they recognized that it
[48:36] wasn't just handed out by a foot soldier
[48:38] but this was something that came from
[48:40] headquarters itself that the Seal of the
[48:43] King was upon this because that seal it
[48:46] marks it it marks his authority it it
[48:49] shows that nobody else gave this word it
[48:51] wasn't it wasn't just somebody down the
[48:53] road this this seal could not be
[48:55] impersonated
[48:57] the seal couldn't be impersonated
[48:58] because the king had this made
[49:01] specifically over his kingdom and over
[49:03] his Reign and each King had a different
[49:05] seal you see that seal it doesn't matter
[49:09] it doesn't matter what what what what
[49:11] man was carrying it but what matters was
[49:14] that the king had placed his seal upon
[49:16] that command and you begin to maybe that
[49:19] scroll could have carried out it could
[49:20] have carried out different commands of
[49:22] it could have been commanding an army to
[49:24] go to such and such place or it could
[49:27] have been carrying out granting Mercy to
[49:29] a person that was in prison it could
[49:31] have been it could have been releasing
[49:33] Justice to to the demographic or the
[49:35] community or the kingship but the power
[49:38] of that decree it was not it was not the
[49:41] the power of it didn't lie upon the
[49:43] parchment of the paper that was on it
[49:45] was not upon the messenger the power was
[49:48] not in the messenger that was carrying
[49:50] at but the very power of that King's
[49:53] decree was the king's word himself
[49:57] it's the word of a king and the Bible
[50:00] said in Isaiah
[50:02] 551 it says so shall my word be that
[50:05] goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not
[50:08] return unto me void but it shall
[50:10] accomplish that which I please and it
[50:12] shall prosper in the thing where unto I
[50:14] send it you see when God speak there his
[50:17] when God speaks any of his words his
[50:19] word is unmatched in power and authority
[50:23] there's a lot of kings that have talked
[50:25] there's a lot of Kings that have have
[50:27] seals there's a lot of kings that have
[50:29] written down different laws but there's
[50:31] a major difference between an Earthly
[50:33] king and the King of Kings because a
[50:36] man's words will fall but God's words
[50:38] will forever remain to be the same now
[50:42] you and I realize that in this in this
[50:44] age that God has equipped us with a with
[50:47] the most powerful weapon that there ever
[50:49] has been that's ever been placed in the
[50:51] hand of all of humanity God has equipped
[50:54] us with the word of God and that word
[50:56] has changed our lives it's changed our
[50:59] circumstances it's changed our demeanor
[51:02] we realize that the word of God would
[51:04] defeat the defeat the enemy any time any
[51:07] place under any circumstance and the
[51:10] word of a King has the ability to go
[51:12] throughout when he makes a decree it has
[51:14] the ability to set events in motion it
[51:17] has the ability to change lives of of
[51:19] people in that Community whether they
[51:22] Prosper or whether there is more
[51:23] taxation but no matter what that King
[51:26] said
[51:27] that King's word is law you look in the
[51:29] Bible when you see Daniel Daniel was a
[51:32] man of of of man of great stature he was
[51:35] a man that had set up in his heart that
[51:37] he was not going to defile himself with
[51:39] the king's meat or the king's drink and
[51:41] he had built himself up into a position
[51:44] that the king loved him he loved his
[51:46] wisdom he he loved to have his knowledge
[51:48] sitting on his board but the king had
[51:51] made a decree one time that he didn't
[51:53] even realize what he was saying that no
[51:55] man could pray for such and such amount
[51:57] of time and even though he loved Daniel
[52:00] because the king had made a decree that
[52:03] King had to carry out his commission and
[52:06] Daniel had to go to the den of the
[52:09] Lions but Daniel was counting on more
[52:12] than the word of a natural King Daniel
[52:15] was counting on the King of Kings words
[52:17] he didn't know whether he would deliver
[52:19] him or not but God is a god he's a god
[52:22] of lions he's a god of fire he's the god
[52:25] of water
[52:28] hallah Hallelujah you see when the word
[52:31] of a god of our God is given it
[52:34] transforms
[52:35] lives it changes our hearts it's it
[52:38] directs our paths it fulfills all of his
[52:41] Divine will because where the word of a
[52:43] God where the word of a king is there's
[52:46] power behind it this ain't just some
[52:49] man's word this is a word of a king and
[52:51] nobody can o oppose what the King has
[52:55] spoken David said in Psalms 45 and6 thy
[52:59] Throne oh God is forever and ever the
[53:02] scepter of thy kingdom is a right
[53:05] scepter when you begin to look and I
[53:07] begin to study out the characteristics
[53:10] of of Earthly King's domain and then you
[53:12] begin to place it together and begin to
[53:15] blend the thoughts of of an Earthly King
[53:17] and and the Heavenly King there are five
[53:20] major uh characteristics that that stand
[53:23] out to me about a domain one of them is
[53:25] territorial
[53:27] Authority protection provision and peace
[53:30] and Order and a king's domain is is is
[53:33] defined to me it's divined it's defined
[53:36] by these aspects of a of a man's
[53:39] territory and it could be talking about
[53:41] his it could be talking about his region
[53:44] it could be talking about his control it
[53:46] could be talking about how much of
[53:48] geography that he has you see and I
[53:50] think it's amazing when you begin to
[53:52] study them things out you begin to see
[53:54] that that natural Kings teritory
[53:56] territory has limitations on it but our
[53:59] King Hallelujah he is infinite and
[54:02] eternal the king's Authority in that
[54:05] domain he has the ultimate authority to
[54:07] be able to make laws enforce laws
[54:10] enforce Justice and he has the authority
[54:13] to govern people under his domain he is
[54:17] that King if it's if it's a
[54:19] characteristic under protection that
[54:21] King is
[54:23] responsible he is responsible for the
[54:26] people that are underneath of his
[54:27] kingdom he is there to make sure that
[54:30] they are safe he is there to make sure
[54:32] that they they have they have their
[54:34] well-being is completely everything
[54:37] everything is in is in order because
[54:39] they are depending on the king that's
[54:41] right you see as a king you see you have
[54:44] set yourself up and there are people
[54:46] that are under you so you've got to be
[54:49] able to provide as a king as well you
[54:52] see you've got to be able to ensure that
[54:54] your kingdom is prospering you got to be
[54:56] sure that the people that their needs
[54:59] are provided for and then the
[55:01] characteristic of a Kingdom's domain is
[55:04] peace in
[55:06] order because what domain really
[55:09] flourishes if there is no
[55:12] peace you be honest you just be real
[55:15] honest you look at the world that we're
[55:16] living
[55:18] in ain't much peace
[55:20] here you see a the the success of a
[55:23] domain is depending upon the heart
[55:26] Harmony and the stability that is placed
[55:28] there under that under that domain now
[55:31] the Bible tells us it's very clear that
[55:34] you and I are going to sit with him on
[55:36] his throne that you and I are going to
[55:39] sit with him on his throne and we
[55:40] realize that when Adam was placed here
[55:43] over 6,000 years ago or when when we see
[55:46] Adam coming into into light in the
[55:48] scripture that Adam was said here and
[55:51] the Bible tells us that the Earth was
[55:53] Adam's domain that Adam had rulership
[55:56] over top of this domain he he controlled
[55:58] the winds he controlled he controlled
[56:00] the waves he controlled the trees he set
[56:02] times and he and he moved things into
[56:04] its position Adam was placed here to
[56:07] rule over the land of this age now
[56:10] brother bandam comes and he preaches in
[56:11] the church ages he said now who who is
[56:14] the God of this Earth he said man is he
[56:17] said that's his domain he said you see
[56:20] everything in the earth is subject to
[56:21] that man he said but through sin's fall
[56:24] you see through the fall of Man
[56:26] you see he be begin to get subject to
[56:29] sin he said but through Christ redeeming
[56:32] power he comes back again because the
[56:34] Earth belongs to man it was given to him
[56:38] that he would be ruler over everything
[56:40] now you know Eve stepped into position
[56:43] under Adam's headship and she recognized
[56:46] that Adam had some boundaries that he
[56:49] could move things into position you see
[56:51] a queen knows as her position that her
[56:54] King has andc the boundaries of his
[56:57] domain if he wants more land he just
[57:00] goes out and he fights for that
[57:04] land Hallelujah that Queen knows her
[57:07] position she knows her kingship
[57:09] boundaries she knows where he has where
[57:12] he's got limitations and where his
[57:14] jurisdiction runs to now brother
[57:16] brandham says some very powerful things
[57:18] and how can I overcome about the
[57:20] believer's domain he said notice when he
[57:23] says in Revelations chap 20 through 22
[57:26] he said now he he Hallelujah the
[57:29] Overcomer will sit with me not on my
[57:31] throne but in my Throne because a king's
[57:34] domain he said it reaches from this side
[57:37] of this boundary to this boundary he
[57:39] said but a but this king's boundary he
[57:42] said it reaches from eternity to
[57:45] Eternity he said Christ is the ruler the
[57:48] ruler at this time he is the complete
[57:51] domain of almighty
[57:53] God but he says the church will be with
[57:56] him the bride will be with him in his
[57:59] throne throughout the entirety of his
[58:02] domain I'll say this as a queen you know
[58:05] that John 14:12 still exists as a queen
[58:09] you know that John 15:7 still is in
[58:11] action as a queen as a church in action
[58:14] you know that Mark 16 is still under
[58:17] your
[58:18] domain that's
[58:21] right
[58:24] Hallelujah David's domain
[58:27] David ruled over Israel and
[58:29] Judah David's domain was established and
[58:32] expanded by almighty God blessing him
[58:35] and protecting him and governing him
[58:38] Solomon's domain was marked by peace and
[58:41] prosperity and the wisdom that almighty
[58:43] God gave him you can look at the
[58:45] Pharaohs of Egypt that they their ruled
[58:47] no matter what their name was no matter
[58:50] what their background that their rule
[58:52] was over top of the land of Egypt that
[58:54] was their domain they they centered
[58:57] thems around the Nile River and their
[58:59] domain was characterized by
[59:01] architectural pyramids and and things
[59:04] that are still lasting even in this hour
[59:06] you look at King Nebuchadnezzar and you
[59:08] could see that his domain was was there
[59:10] in Babylon and Babylon is is shown as
[59:13] one of the most prosperous kingdoms that
[59:15] ever was it stretched all the way from
[59:17] Babylon all the way to Mesopotamia all
[59:20] the way to the Far East but you find in
[59:23] Daniel 4 and verse 22
[59:26] it says about Nebuchadnezzar talking
[59:28] about the dream it said is this it is
[59:31] thou oh King that thou art grown notice
[59:34] word grown and become strong for thy
[59:36] greatness is grown and reaches unto
[59:39] heaven and thy Dominion to the end of
[59:42] the Earth you go on reading the final
[59:44] verses of Daniel chapter 4 it talks
[59:47] about Nebuchadnezzar's domain it talks
[59:49] about it had reached so high that it was
[59:52] guiding all the way up to heaven but you
[59:54] see that if you go on reading that God
[59:56] begin to cut down Nebuchadnezzar's
[59:58] Throne he be to cut down his kingdom
[1:00:01] this was a kingdom that was flourishing
[1:00:03] this was a domain that was known
[1:00:05] throughout all the worlds but God
[1:00:08] hallelujah he sets times and he sets
[1:00:11] Kings he raises them up and he sets them
[1:00:14] down and Nebuchadnezzar was cut down and
[1:00:17] hued like a
[1:00:19] tree Nebuchadnezzar set out decrees he
[1:00:22] set out different laws but this was not
[1:00:25] the law when Daniel was speaking he said
[1:00:28] this was a decree from the most high
[1:00:32] Daniel saying it ain't my word Daniel
[1:00:34] saying this ain't some King's word this
[1:00:36] is the most High's
[1:00:40] word I'm going keep building today I
[1:00:43] could tell you about many Earthly Kings
[1:00:46] I could tell you about Charlamagne that
[1:00:47] was over top of the Holy Roman Empire I
[1:00:50] could tell you I could tell you about
[1:00:52] King Henry VII that was over top of the
[1:00:54] England domain I could tell you about
[1:00:56] gask Khan that was over top of the
[1:00:58] Mongol Empire I could tell you about
[1:01:01] King Louis the 14th about how he was
[1:01:03] over top of the over the top of the
[1:01:05] domain of of France and how that how
[1:01:08] that he ruled throughout his throughout
[1:01:09] his entirety as a
[1:01:11] king you see it reaches their domain
[1:01:15] reaches as far as they set the
[1:01:18] boundaries I could tell you all about
[1:01:20] these i' I've spent some time studying
[1:01:22] them out but the greatest thing the
[1:01:24] greatest point that stood out to me yes
[1:01:27] they had Authority yes they had
[1:01:29] rulership but their domain was limited
[1:01:32] to geographically it was they limited to
[1:01:36] how many boundaries they could set it
[1:01:38] was limited to a certain time as long as
[1:01:40] they were King their laws stood in place
[1:01:43] but when that king passed off the scene
[1:01:46] the decrees begin to change but this
[1:01:49] King my King has running from eternity
[1:01:53] to Eternity he has no limit a his power
[1:01:57] never ceases he has the ability to heal
[1:02:00] you today and heal you tomorrow he has
[1:02:03] the ability to save you and keep you he
[1:02:06] has the ability as a king to set things
[1:02:10] in
[1:02:17] motion it's quite the
[1:02:20] contrast between a natural King and an
[1:02:22] Earthly king and a Heavenly King
[1:02:28] now Jesus said
[1:02:30] this behold the kingdom of God is within
[1:02:37] you now I want you to be listening very
[1:02:40] closely and I want you to be on the edge
[1:02:43] of your seat as it were I'm going to
[1:02:44] just build some things because I'm going
[1:02:52] somewhere and I want you ready
[1:02:57] so do I have your full
[1:03:00] attention because God did not just
[1:03:02] deposit this message to us just to just
[1:03:05] give us another form or just give us
[1:03:07] another religion God deposited this to
[1:03:10] us and he released these very very
[1:03:13] special revelations in this hour because
[1:03:16] he realized that his domain it was
[1:03:20] running it was running right up to Le
[1:03:22] oosa it had went through seven Church
[1:03:24] ages and Church agents had dismissed him
[1:03:28] there through men of that coming in of
[1:03:30] creed they had dismiss dismissed the
[1:03:32] Holy Spirit from operating amongst the
[1:03:35] Church of the Living God they had
[1:03:36] dismissed the idea that God still did
[1:03:38] Miracles and that God still did Divine
[1:03:41] healings and that God still was the same
[1:03:44] but in this generation God has brought
[1:03:46] back into full picture that all the
[1:03:49] things that had been dismissed all the
[1:03:51] things that had been broken apart all
[1:03:53] the things that men begin to say this
[1:03:55] wasn't these King's word all of a sudden
[1:03:58] a little Kentucky hillbilly begin to put
[1:04:01] these things back into order and said
[1:04:03] this is the King's word I know men have
[1:04:06] rejected the messenger I know they have
[1:04:08] rejected the seal but the hillbilly
[1:04:11] Kentucky put the king's word back in its
[1:04:16] position the kingdom of God is within
[1:04:20] you now when brother Brandon Begin to
[1:04:22] teach us in Christ The Mystery of God
[1:04:24] revealed he begin to teach us he begin
[1:04:27] to lay in some very very powerful things
[1:04:29] and you ain't listened to it for a while
[1:04:31] go back and listen to it if you want to
[1:04:33] know anything about my Ministry it's
[1:04:35] spend in them four hours right there and
[1:04:37] brother Bon begins to lay lay in some
[1:04:40] things there about the threefold purpose
[1:04:43] of almighty God he goes in there and he
[1:04:45] starts talking about Born Again
[1:04:47] Believers that are born into the kingdom
[1:04:49] of almighty God and he goes in there and
[1:04:51] he lays out that first Christ is his
[1:04:54] purpose his first purpose was to express
[1:04:56] himself completely God in Christ so he's
[1:04:59] going to reveal himself through the form
[1:05:01] of the son of man of Luke 17 and3 of
[1:05:04] Revelations 10 Malachi 4 secondly he was
[1:05:07] going to have the preeminence by his
[1:05:10] church so he was going to literally his
[1:05:12] bride was going to literally become the
[1:05:14] Living Word they would be the voice of
[1:05:16] this message they would be live voices
[1:05:19] that's why William Brandon would stand
[1:05:21] there in the Revelation series and said
[1:05:23] oh how we need in Jeffersonville
[1:05:26] thousands thousands of live voices not
[1:05:29] just a voice that'll fall off the map
[1:05:31] not just a voice that I'll speak today
[1:05:33] and won't speak tomorrow we need live
[1:05:35] voices he said that's the Thunder that
[1:05:38] shakes the devil that's the preeminence
[1:05:41] of Christ Living on the inside of a body
[1:05:44] of
[1:05:46] Believers his third purpose was to
[1:05:48] restore the kingdom back to its rightful
[1:05:51] position what are you saying brother
[1:05:53] Andrew I'm saying that in this
[1:05:54] three-fold purpose is where God is
[1:05:57] changing our mind changing our life and
[1:06:00] one of these days he'll change our
[1:06:04] [Applause]
[1:06:07] bodies
[1:06:09] Hallelujah I want to turn loose a
[1:06:10] preacher but let me let me keep going
[1:06:13] brother M say in there he said now our
[1:06:16] headship is a kingdom our headship is a
[1:06:18] kingdom he said the kingdom of God is
[1:06:20] within you he said we belong to a
[1:06:22] kingdom and the kingdom is the word of
[1:06:24] God made spirit and life in your own
[1:06:26] life and bringing to promise bringing to
[1:06:28] pass every promise in this day you see
[1:06:31] he's making the headship and the body
[1:06:33] completely redeemed to bring about the
[1:06:35] message of the last day this was not
[1:06:37] just placed on Malachi 4 but the
[1:06:40] headship the kingdom is within you so
[1:06:44] the headship has now got a body that it
[1:06:47] can rest him it's now got a body it can
[1:06:49] move in it's now got a body he can work
[1:06:51] in it's now got a body he can live in
[1:06:54] the Kingdom
[1:06:56] the kingdom the kingdom is here to bring
[1:06:59] a
[1:07:00] [Music]
[1:07:03] message Adam rolled the natural he
[1:07:07] controlled winds he controlled trees but
[1:07:10] in this Hallelujah in this hour it's
[1:07:13] okay if I turn him loose just for a
[1:07:15] minute but in this hour Eve fell Eve
[1:07:18] fell back there in the Garden of Eden
[1:07:20] but right here in Satan's Eden there is
[1:07:23] a counterpart to the king and her domain
[1:07:26] reaches to Eternity that's why she has
[1:07:29] the ability to say to complexes you've
[1:07:32] got to go in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:07:35] this is your domain this is your
[1:07:38] power a King when he says something he
[1:07:41] means something he's got power to back
[1:07:44] it up he isn't just making vain promises
[1:07:47] he's not making empty promises to us
[1:07:49] that he can't
[1:07:51] keep so he said he' give you the Holy
[1:07:54] Ghost well receive receive
[1:08:02] it brother Melvin the thing you've been
[1:08:04] looking for it's all over you
[1:08:07] buddy the thing you've been looking for
[1:08:10] is right here in this room a lot of
[1:08:12] people are looking for miracles but it's
[1:08:13] right here in the room a lot of people
[1:08:16] are looking for deliverances but it's
[1:08:17] right here in the room how can you say
[1:08:19] that because the king said it
[1:08:38] May
[1:08:42] Hallelujah I feel
[1:08:49] better I can't have no constriction on
[1:08:52] me it
[1:08:54] just let's go back to our
[1:08:57] text in Revelation chapter
[1:09:00] 4 brother brandom refers to this in
[1:09:04] Revelations chapter 4 and part
[1:09:09] two it just happened this past week
[1:09:12] believe
[1:09:14] it's 65 years or 64 years or on Friday
[1:09:20] it would have been 64 years that when
[1:09:22] William brandham gets done finishing
[1:09:23] preaching the Revelation series that the
[1:09:26] pillar of fire begins to draw out begins
[1:09:29] to draw out the seven Church ages
[1:09:31] according to how brother Brandon has
[1:09:32] draw it out and brother brandom goes in
[1:09:34] here excuse me for dropping that in he
[1:09:37] said but he said now look he said to
[1:09:39] look upon a Sardis stone and a jasper
[1:09:40] stone he said he was sitting on his
[1:09:42] throne I read this to you last weekend
[1:09:44] but I'd like to build on it today he
[1:09:45] said how would you all like to see him
[1:09:47] setting upon his glory he said now let's
[1:09:50] run let's turn over to Revelations
[1:09:52] 21-1 and he goes there and he said he
[1:09:54] carried me away the spirit to a great
[1:09:56] and high mountain showed me the great
[1:09:58] City and the holy Jerusalem descending
[1:10:00] Out of Heaven from God he said having
[1:10:02] the glory of God having the glory of God
[1:10:04] and her lights was lik UN to a stone
[1:10:06] most precious even like Jasper as clear
[1:10:09] as Crystal notice he goes on he said now
[1:10:12] her light the light who is the light he
[1:10:14] said and the city had no need of the sun
[1:10:16] because the lamb is a light thereof he
[1:10:18] said Jasper s a stone he said now notice
[1:10:21] he said the glory of God is Jesus Christ
[1:10:24] and the glory of Jesus Christ is his
[1:10:25] church now when you begin to look at
[1:10:28] John throughout the entirety of the Book
[1:10:30] of Revelation you will find that John
[1:10:32] represents a the bride body that that
[1:10:35] one person in a vision can represent
[1:10:37] many many many members there but John is
[1:10:39] representing the he is representing the
[1:10:41] Bride of Jesus Christ and we realize
[1:10:44] that that from Revelations chapter 4 to
[1:10:46] Revelations 19 that the church has been
[1:10:48] caught up that the church is already
[1:10:50] gone on but we realize that when you
[1:10:52] start reading Revelations chapter 4 you
[1:10:54] will see there you begin to see the
[1:10:56] appearance of fire you begin to see the
[1:10:58] rainbow and the seven colors round about
[1:11:00] The Throne that the Bible said and the
[1:11:02] color of amber as the appearance of fire
[1:11:04] about it and the appearance from
[1:11:05] appearance of his loins even upward and
[1:11:08] appearance of his loin even downward I
[1:11:10] saw as it was the appearance of fire you
[1:11:12] begin to look at the fire of the Holy
[1:11:14] Ghost spraying out it was spraying out
[1:11:16] the Revelation or the the rainbow of the
[1:11:18] seven colors you see them seven colors
[1:11:21] have a have significance in it they're
[1:11:23] laying in there now brother random goes
[1:11:25] there he said now the glory of the Lord
[1:11:26] he said the glory of the Lord is
[1:11:28] covering over his church because he is
[1:11:30] in his
[1:11:31] church the glory of the Lord is covering
[1:11:34] over his church because he is in his
[1:11:36] church the kingdom of God is within you
[1:11:38] he said this was the appearance the
[1:11:40] appearance and the likeness of the glory
[1:11:43] of the Lord now what happened out there
[1:11:45] in 1950 at the Houston Coliseum we begin
[1:11:47] to recognize that the pillar of fire
[1:11:50] begin to whip in this generation and it
[1:11:52] begin to show up that it wasn't it
[1:11:54] wasn't just a man but there was a
[1:11:56] Vindication that was behind this man
[1:11:58] that all of heaven was behind this
[1:12:00] ministry and it was showing that
[1:12:02] Revelations 10:1 cared enough to come
[1:12:04] over top of Revelations 10:7 and he
[1:12:07] begin to show that the pillar of fire
[1:12:10] had made its return again now when
[1:12:12] William brandham is standing there in
[1:12:13] Lakeport California I believe it's 1960
[1:12:16] and he begins to preach and he he begins
[1:12:18] to lay out some things and the pillar
[1:12:20] fire begins to show up in the room
[1:12:22] there's a photographer that is sitting
[1:12:24] there and he said and the Holy Spirit my
[1:12:26] brother Manon was he he didn't want
[1:12:27] pictures being taken while he was
[1:12:29] ministering because he was looking for
[1:12:31] that light but something spoke to that
[1:12:33] photographer said take a picture take
[1:12:35] the picture and he snapped one picture
[1:12:38] and then he snapped another picture and
[1:12:40] there you begin to see the very Throne
[1:12:41] of God as it set out there you see the
[1:12:44] seven licks of fire you begin to see it
[1:12:46] brother brandom said now we've got it in
[1:12:48] codak Chrome he said you see the streaks
[1:12:50] of rainbow they're going back and forth
[1:12:52] you see the bride is covered by the
[1:12:55] glory of the Lord the bride is covered
[1:12:58] by the glory of the Lord You See Jesus
[1:13:00] Christ is the glory of God but the glory
[1:13:03] of Jesus Christ is his church and this
[1:13:05] church has been covered by the glory of
[1:13:08] almighty God it don't surprise me that
[1:13:10] you see the pillar of fire in this
[1:13:12] meeting it won't surprise me whether you
[1:13:14] see the Holy Ghost whipping in here we
[1:13:16] ought expect to see them thanks I'll be
[1:13:19] honest the king's here so we might as
[1:13:20] well expect to see him you remember that
[1:13:23] little bitty girl out there that was
[1:13:24] waving her flag and she got to cry
[1:13:27] because the king didn't see her well you
[1:13:29] ain't got to worry whether the king sees
[1:13:30] you or King don't King Jesus has always
[1:13:33] been looking on you he said he never
[1:13:35] leave you and he never forsake
[1:13:39] you now I I sitting back here in the
[1:13:41] study and I I was reading over these
[1:13:43] things and maybe brother Matthew Spencer
[1:13:45] would come here not that you anybody
[1:13:48] could have done this I could have done
[1:13:50] it with that other microphone on but
[1:13:52] anyways we realize that this is this is
[1:13:55] from Life
[1:13:57] Magazine it wasn't in Time
[1:14:02] Magazine cuz there ain't no time limits
[1:14:05] on our
[1:14:06] King it was in Life Magazine we realized
[1:14:09] that brother Brandon was up there and he
[1:14:11] he he's given a word from the Lord to go
[1:14:13] out west and to go out there and you
[1:14:15] remember the you remember the promise
[1:14:16] when brother Brandon was standing there
[1:14:18] in 1962 and he begins to preach s is is
[1:14:20] the sign of the end and brother Bram
[1:14:22] goes out there and brother Bram says now
[1:14:24] he said he speaks to the men that were
[1:14:26] with him he begins to tell them now them
[1:14:28] angels are up here waiting on me now
[1:14:30] brother bam goes up there and they're
[1:14:32] hunting them Haven a Hogs and you
[1:14:33] remember that brother bandam is standing
[1:14:35] there and he and all of a sudden he
[1:14:37] hears a great blast while he while he's
[1:14:39] he's picking that cuar off of his leg
[1:14:41] brother BR thought he was shot that
[1:14:42] somebody shot him and all of a sudden
[1:14:44] there were seven angels that coming from
[1:14:46] the sky and they gave him a revelation
[1:14:48] to go back east and to preach the Seven
[1:14:50] Seals now brother manam he he he doesn't
[1:14:53] realize this I believe it's in uh it is
[1:14:55] the rising of the sun I believe I
[1:14:57] believe that's right that he begins to
[1:14:59] talk about this this uh this addition
[1:15:01] here in in Life Magazine brother brandom
[1:15:03] don't even know whether it's there and
[1:15:05] brother brandham is sitting there and
[1:15:06] he's looking at it and he's he's he's
[1:15:08] coning over the he's pondering over
[1:15:10] these things that he begins to look at
[1:15:11] it and the spirit of the Lord tells him
[1:15:13] to turn it to the right he said you see
[1:15:17] it's our Lord Jesus Christ up there
[1:15:19] looking over top of the land you see our
[1:15:22] King is looking over top of you now if
[1:15:25] you go you read Revelations chapter 10
[1:15:27] you throw that up there for us uh
[1:15:30] sister Alysa glasses ain't
[1:15:34] on Revelations chapter
[1:15:37] 10:1 and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[1:15:40] down from heaven clothed with a cloud
[1:15:42] and a rainbow was upon his head now the
[1:15:45] author of this magazine was not a
[1:15:48] message believer the guy that took that
[1:15:51] picture was not a message believer but
[1:15:53] if you look on the next page
[1:15:55] you will see the rainbow of moon beams
[1:15:57] that is over top of the
[1:16:01] head if you go back one more page you
[1:16:05] will see that there is a picture of five
[1:16:08] watches and the description says five
[1:16:11] young ladies who are never
[1:16:14] late Hallelujah There is five wise
[1:16:17] virgins that will be right on time they
[1:16:20] have met and heard the bridegroom's call
[1:16:23] the message of the hour and has shouted
[1:16:25] over top of them and they recognized
[1:16:28] this is a king's
[1:16:30] message this is life this ain't time
[1:16:34] this is life how can you put time on you
[1:16:38] as eternity to
[1:16:45] Eternity now we realize that the Book of
[1:16:47] Revelation is in symbols is that right
[1:16:49] thank you brother Matthew it's in
[1:16:51] symbols so we realize we realize that
[1:16:54] that's just a symbol that ain't our Lord
[1:16:56] up there it is our lord it's a symbol of
[1:16:58] him in the heaven but to realize that
[1:17:01] he's come and they Fe he's coming A
[1:17:03] Spiritual manifestation of the Bride
[1:17:06] coming of Jesus Christ in this hour that
[1:17:09] the queen has the
[1:17:11] authority it has the authority of the
[1:17:14] king's seal you said well I don't know

[1:17:26] against sickness that seal will prove
[1:17:28] whether you got it or not there's a lot
[1:17:30] of things that happen to good people but
[1:17:33] because the king seal is there Satan can
[1:17:35] never take your life he talked to job
[1:17:38] job he took everything from job he
[1:17:41] whipped him he put him he put him he put
[1:17:43] him through the trials of his life he
[1:17:45] took his children he took his manifest
[1:17:47] he took his success he took all of it
[1:17:49] away from him but he told him you can't
[1:17:52] touch his life
[1:17:55] come on somebody what are you at the end
[1:17:57] of the
[1:17:58] day you're the same person you was when
[1:18:01] you was born here but something's
[1:18:03] changing on the outside of you the
[1:18:06] natural man's changing but there is a
[1:18:08] genan Sheed of God that was deposited in
[1:18:11] you before the foundation of the world
[1:18:13] that no preacher put it there no
[1:18:15] Doctrine put it there but almighty
[1:18:19] God so life that's why Paul could say in
[1:18:23] Galatians 2 and 20 that I am crucified
[1:18:25] with Christ nevertheless I live yet not
[1:18:28] I but
[1:18:34] Christ it will not surprise
[1:18:37] me if you walk out of the service and
[1:18:39] say you've seen the pillar of
[1:18:42] fire it won't surprise me one
[1:18:45] bit it won't surprise me one bit if you
[1:18:48] begin to see the Milky presence of
[1:18:49] almighty God begin to float in this
[1:18:51] place I've seen it many times I saw it
[1:18:54] right when Sister Sarah and sister jolia
[1:18:56] was singing and some people was in a
[1:18:58] different world but all of a sudden the
[1:19:00] Milky presence of almighty God just
[1:19:01] begin to drop in
[1:19:03] here it won't surprise me because
[1:19:06] William Brandon would stand there he
[1:19:08] would stand there and he'd be talking to
[1:19:09] a patient in a line he began to talk to
[1:19:11] him he said now he he would call out
[1:19:13] certain needs and certain diseases and
[1:19:15] certain things he said now you're being
[1:19:17] covered over by the pillar fire he said
[1:19:19] now standing between standing between me
[1:19:22] and the patient is the Angel of the Lord
[1:19:25] you realize that that that that you are
[1:19:27] the reason why this world cannot be
[1:19:31] destroyed you're the reason why the
[1:19:33] tribulation is being held off it's
[1:19:36] because your mercy to this generation
[1:19:39] you see the glory of the Lord is
[1:19:40] standing between between Le oia and
[1:19:43] judgment brother Brandon would tell us
[1:19:45] he said the first Throne was in heaven
[1:19:47] the Judgment seat he said but the second
[1:19:49] Throne was in Christ he said but now the
[1:19:51] third Throne is in man so you are
[1:19:54] literally
[1:19:55] The Mercy Seat to this dying generation
[1:19:58] and people don't even realize when you
[1:20:00] go to work with him and when you go to
[1:20:01] Walmart and when go through your
[1:20:03] day-to-day activities they do not
[1:20:05] realize how close they are to the throne
[1:20:07] of almighty God because you are you are
[1:20:11] a body word you are covered by the
[1:20:14] bleeding word and the mercy seat is in
[1:20:18] plain
[1:20:21] view people I was me and Aden was on uh
[1:20:26] we was where were we we've been so many
[1:20:28] places he he likes to stay home but I
[1:20:31] take him
[1:20:35] places he looks at me when I ask him can
[1:20:38] you go with me here and you know you
[1:20:40] know i' go with you anywhere brother
[1:20:41] Andrew but I'd rather be
[1:20:43] here we was in uh we was in Tennessee we
[1:20:47] had standing there and we we're doing
[1:20:49] some window shopping while the girls
[1:20:50] were doing real shopping and uh it's
[1:20:53] real buddy
[1:20:58] Hallelujah them girls it doesn't matter
[1:21:00] if it's Black Friday or any
[1:21:03] Friday we standing there and all of a
[1:21:05] sudden this Pentecostal preacher comes
[1:21:06] up he starts talking starts talking to
[1:21:09] us and what I found amazing I don't even
[1:21:12] remember the whole context of the of our
[1:21:15] conversation but he he put his hand on
[1:21:17] brother alen and said he said people
[1:21:19] don't realize he said' the church ain't
[1:21:21] a building he said but the church is in
[1:21:23] you and I thought brother here he was
[1:21:26] and I mean I'll just be honest with you
[1:21:27] he looked like a pervert come straight
[1:21:28] from the pits of
[1:21:30] hell I don't care if it's Pentecost or
[1:21:32] not that's what he looked
[1:21:36] like had a chain running down his neck
[1:21:39] and had his hairs hanging out and he
[1:21:40] cared more about his appearance than he
[1:21:42] did care about the Church of
[1:21:44] God and I thought when he put his hand
[1:21:46] on brother Al and said the Church of God
[1:21:48] is in you I thought buddy you as as
[1:21:49] close as you ever going to get right
[1:21:52] here you as close to the I tell you
[1:21:54] brother Joe shifflet had a say in many
[1:21:56] times he would always say he said he
[1:21:58] would talk to doctors and he would say
[1:21:59] he said you know he said I'm the most
[1:22:01] important person you're going to meet
[1:22:03] today you're the mo I'm the most
[1:22:05] important you don't even realize
[1:22:07] sometimes what people are bumping up
[1:22:09] against what makes them what makes you
[1:22:11] jump and makes you shout they don't
[1:22:13] realize that they're bumping up to Mercy
[1:22:15] but you realize that you're bumping up
[1:22:17] to Angels you're bumping up to Eternity
[1:22:19] and it changes your whole
[1:22:22] demeanor brother random comes an
[1:22:23] anointed one at at the end time brother
[1:22:25] Manon begins to connect and lay some
[1:22:27] things together about the third pole and
[1:22:30] he connects Luke 17:30 Revelations 10
[1:22:33] and Malachi 4 and it begins to connect
[1:22:36] them things together he begin to tell us
[1:22:38] that all of it was tied together that
[1:22:41] all of it was tied together all of it of
[1:22:43] the son of man Malachi 4 that he was
[1:22:46] Christ and he's going to be in you and
[1:22:49] I'm going to send you Elijah so he is
[1:22:51] sending us Elijah Christ is here so
[1:22:54] there's got to be a youu here right
[1:22:56] there's got to be a people of the third
[1:22:58] pole because it wasn't just for William
[1:23:00] brandom come on I'll say it like this it
[1:23:02] wasn't just for Hatty R and it wasn't
[1:23:05] just for that storm out there in col
[1:23:06] Colorado and it wasn't just for sister M
[1:23:09] tumors but it was for you come on
[1:23:12] somebody it wasn't just to speak
[1:23:13] squirrels into existence but it was to
[1:23:15] Speak Life to Sisters Whitney's womb it
[1:23:18] was Speak Life to brother Davey's
[1:23:20] crushed hips it was to Speak Life to
[1:23:22] brother Ron when he was burned in a c in
[1:23:24] a in a burn
[1:23:25] center that third pole is in
[1:23:32] action so the word of the Lord is in her
[1:23:36] it ain't no longer in the hands of just
[1:23:37] William banham it ain't just in the
[1:23:39] hands of the mighty Angel but it's in
[1:23:41] your hand I'm not just talking about a
[1:23:43] king but I'm talking about the king this
[1:23:46] ain't just a king sword this is the king
[1:23:48] sword Paul said in 1 Corinthians 4:20
[1:23:52] the kingdom of God is is is not in word
[1:23:55] but it's in power brother Randon picks
[1:23:57] that up in the message Oneness he said
[1:23:59] the kingdom of God is God's word made
[1:24:02] Power the kingdom of God is God's word
[1:24:05] made Power what is the kingdom of God
[1:24:08] it's within you the Kingdom's in you and
[1:24:11] when the word comes in there what does
[1:24:13] this word begin he said it turns itself
[1:24:17] into
[1:24:20] Power well glory to God sometimes you
[1:24:23] just don't need a miror
[1:24:24] but sometimes you
[1:24:27] do sometimes you ain't got no money in
[1:24:29] your wallet and sometimes you do brother
[1:24:32] Mar I'm said now if I really needed that
[1:24:33] old Barlo knife even though I know it's
[1:24:35] setting up there on that cabinet back at
[1:24:37] home he said if I really needed it he
[1:24:39] said I could believe in it be right
[1:24:40] there in my pocket in a matter of
[1:24:42] seconds what are you saying I'm saying
[1:24:44] that faith is the word that faith is a
[1:24:47] revelation of what the word is and Faith
[1:24:50] turns the word into Power what was had R
[1:24:53] doing was lining herself up with the
[1:24:56] word and it became Power to her and it
[1:24:59] released salvation to her little boys it
[1:25:02] turns itself into Power making it say
[1:25:04] exactly what it said so a king's word
[1:25:07] has got to remain a king's word to
[1:25:10] remain to have power behind
[1:25:16] it now go back to the message I preached
[1:25:20] on Veil
[1:25:22] Glory you see that Veil of the Holy
[1:25:25] Ghost it was working it was working in
[1:25:29] one man but now it's working that Holy
[1:25:32] Ghost is now operating it was there on
[1:25:35] the day of Pentecost but now it was
[1:25:37] working in Acts three you see what did
[1:25:39] they do they turned the word of Luke
[1:25:41] 24:49 and he turned it into power when
[1:25:43] he was up there waiting on that promise
[1:25:45] because the king had told him that this
[1:25:47] was coming and the King told him to be
[1:25:48] at such and such place and it was going
[1:25:50] to happen that way I say this that the
[1:25:53] king had spoke that this is the way the
[1:25:54] things are to be he begin to talk to us
[1:25:56] if the Rapture is at hand and there
[1:25:58] modern events that are made clear by
[1:26:00] prophecy he begin to talk to us about
[1:26:01] communion he be to talk to us about
[1:26:03] spiritual food in due season and the
[1:26:05] King started talking who is this MDC he
[1:26:08] began to talk to us about he began to
[1:26:10] talk to us about countdown he began to
[1:26:12] talk to us about the Masterpiece you
[1:26:14] begin to see that God was hid and he was
[1:26:16] revealed in them titles that was
[1:26:18] preached by William brandham and you
[1:26:20] begin to see Christ is a mystery of God
[1:26:23] revealed you what is it's a bride that
[1:26:26] is turning this word into power just
[1:26:28] like after the day of Pentecost Peter
[1:26:30] and John walked up there and they was
[1:26:32] walking by the beautiful gate there laid
[1:26:34] a man that was sitting there for so many
[1:26:36] years but when they walk by there they
[1:26:38] turned word into power and such as that
[1:26:41] said such as I have give I Thee in the
[1:26:44] name of Jesus Christ why walk walk I say
[1:26:49] this to you as such as I have give I
[1:26:52] Thee in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:26:55] you need your pocket bll fold your
[1:26:57] pocket bill fold up filled up then I say
[1:27:00] step in line for it if you need a body
[1:27:02] change step in line for it if you need
[1:27:05] restoration step in line for it if you
[1:27:07] need healing step in line for it turn
[1:27:10] word into
[1:27:13] Power come on now William brandham said
[1:27:16] we've got enough power he but what we
[1:27:18] need is to stop blowing the power at the
[1:27:21] top and put the wheels in action let him
[1:27:24] roll let him roll let him roll don't
[1:27:28] talk about it put it into action the
[1:27:30] king's word the king sword what's in
[1:27:33] your hand what are you going to do with
[1:27:52] it somebody going to speak something
[1:27:54] into
[1:27:57] existence it's where eagles are born
[1:27:59] right here in the atmosphere like this
[1:28:00] somebody's going to speak something to
[1:28:04] existence so what do you keep preaching
[1:28:06] about them prodical for because I
[1:28:07] believe somebody's going to speak it
[1:28:08] into
[1:28:10] existence I believe that God didn't put
[1:28:13] it on my heart to keep preaching it just
[1:28:15] for no reason I believe somebody's going
[1:28:16] to take that into action it ain't going
[1:28:18] to just be Hatty R story it'll be Denny
[1:28:20] Vance's
[1:28:21] story it'll be chasty Fraser story
[1:28:25] come on somebody how about you you're
[1:28:27] going to start talking some things when
[1:28:29] the bride gets into speak condition with
[1:28:31] her condition with her High her High
[1:28:33] King her bridegroom then all of a sudden
[1:28:36] you begin to watch there ain't no
[1:28:37] difference no more the two have become
[1:28:40] one they're saying the same thing that
[1:28:43] the king spoke what the king saw they're
[1:28:52] manifesting Joshua
[1:28:55] and his commission was go out there and
[1:28:57] possess the
[1:28:58] land he go out there and possess the
[1:29:00] land he laid out the boundaries laid out
[1:29:02] the borders he began to lay out that
[1:29:04] this was his domain this was the
[1:29:06] believer's domain that's why Caleb could
[1:29:08] stand there at 85 years old he said I'm
[1:29:11] as strong as I ever was and he would
[1:29:13] standing there said give me my Mountain
[1:29:15] Caleb didn't care whether there was
[1:29:16] anakims on there whether they was living
[1:29:18] on his property or whether they was
[1:29:20] living on his domain he recognized that
[1:29:23] was his promise that came from a prophet
[1:29:25] messenger and stood there and told him
[1:29:26] that these things were his so he
[1:29:28] recognized it was time for him to go in
[1:29:31] there and defend his borders we have a
[1:29:33] land without boundaries we got to fight
[1:29:36] for our boundaries Brothers I'm telling
[1:29:38] you you got to fight for your prayer
[1:29:39] life you got to fight for your home you
[1:29:42] got to fight for your wife you got to
[1:29:43] fight for your children I say secure the
[1:29:46] boundaries secure the boundaries
[1:29:48] Brothers what are you saying I'm saying
[1:29:49] put the token on display because God has
[1:29:52] given us a commission and he's places
[1:29:54] here in this generation I say give me my
[1:29:58] Mountain we realize that Christ in the
[1:30:01] true church is going to be a
[1:30:02] continuation of the book of Acts and
[1:30:04] Satan hates that book he hates the Book
[1:30:07] of Genesis he hates the Book of
[1:30:09] Revelation but in there I find my true
[1:30:12] identity as a Queen of
[1:30:17] Heaven he knows that if the people it's
[1:30:22] based on a little word
[1:30:26] if if if you believe if you accept it if
[1:30:31] you confess it he knows that if the
[1:30:35] people get the true revelation of the
[1:30:38] Antichrist Spirit working in the frame
[1:30:40] framework of the church that he will be
[1:30:45] defeated but you'll be an invincible
[1:30:47] Army that means that you're uncapable of
[1:30:51] being defeated
[1:30:54] I'm talking about little bitty
[1:30:55] Housewives being Invincible I'm talking
[1:30:58] about grandma's being Invincible I'm
[1:31:01] talking about little bitty children
[1:31:03] being Invincible I'm talking about
[1:31:05] people that believe because
[1:31:07] if he didn't put no age requirements on
[1:31:10] it he didn't say how old you got to be
[1:31:12] he didn't say how mature you got to be
[1:31:14] he said but if thou believest all things
[1:31:18] are possible
[1:31:30] hallelujah our King has left nothing
[1:31:36] undone he's turned over every stone of
[1:31:38] Revelation in this
[1:31:40] hour he's given you power he's given you
[1:31:44] Revelation he's given you Authority and
[1:31:46] you are placed here not to be ruled by
[1:31:49] Satan but to rule over
[1:31:51] Satan with me you go to reading
[1:31:54] Joshua the Book of
[1:31:56] Joshua you begin to read in Joshua
[1:31:59] chapter
[1:32:00] 12 that Joshua goes in there and he
[1:32:03] starts lining out the name of these
[1:32:05] Kings I I ain't going to spend much time
[1:32:07] right there but he starts lining out all
[1:32:10] the kings that they went in there and
[1:32:12] they took back their domain maybe I'll
[1:32:14] grab that at some of time but I'm not
[1:32:15] going to spend much time right there but
[1:32:19] Joshua knew that if he was going to have
[1:32:21] total Victory he was going to have to
[1:32:23] have a total surrender from
[1:32:29] everybody look at the Battle AI look
[1:32:32] where they begin to get in trouble with
[1:32:34] W with the with the golden wedge and it
[1:32:36] begin to get grab a hold of that that
[1:32:38] Babylonian garment it got him in trouble
[1:32:41] so you before you're going to have total
[1:32:42] Victory you got to have a total
[1:32:44] surrender let me let me just drop that
[1:32:46] right there before you can ever be
[1:32:49] successful as the Queen of Heaven you
[1:32:51] have got to surrender your will and your
[1:32:54] ways over to him before you ever be a
[1:32:57] successful housewife you got to be a
[1:32:59] submissive
[1:33:00] housewife I don't mean you Brothers run
[1:33:02] over top of them but before you ever
[1:33:05] before you're ever going to grow in the
[1:33:06] presence of the Lord you've got to
[1:33:09] surrender you ever watch somebody's got
[1:33:12] a that man they can flat sing the dog
[1:33:14] down I mean they can just they can sing
[1:33:15] you happy and they can they can may I
[1:33:17] tell you what they make you cry
[1:33:19] sometimes some some people make you cry
[1:33:20] all the time when they sing
[1:33:24] you know sometimes we're a blessing to
[1:33:26] them sometimes they're a blessing to
[1:33:29] us when they're when we're a blessing to
[1:33:31] them it's when we're letting them
[1:33:36] sing but there's some people that can
[1:33:38] flat sing it down I mean they can they
[1:33:40] can make you boohoo and cry and run
[1:33:42] mascara all over your face because man
[1:33:43] they just got the talent but until they
[1:33:45] surrender that until they surrender that
[1:33:49] gift to almighty God they will never
[1:33:51] fully realize what the anointing of God
[1:33:52] truly is but you watch somebody that
[1:33:55] maybe can't even carry a tune in a in a
[1:33:57] bucket and they can't hardly make their
[1:33:59] way out of a paper bag and all of a
[1:34:00] sudden they just get to they get to sing
[1:34:02] and all of a sudden the angels of God
[1:34:04] get involved and they take that they
[1:34:05] take that realm up to another they take
[1:34:07] it up to another octave and all of a
[1:34:08] sudden the blessings of God come down
[1:34:10] you don't care whether they can sing or
[1:34:12] not what matters is they surrender their
[1:34:15] gift to almighty
[1:34:18] God you see it's kind of let me let me
[1:34:20] place it in this view for you it's kind
[1:34:22] of like when we had that play up here
[1:34:24] and everybody everybody got I called
[1:34:26] everybody out and everybody was getting
[1:34:28] their accolades and they was getting
[1:34:29] rewards you see there were
[1:34:32] certain you see there's there there's
[1:34:34] some people that live for that moment
[1:34:37] right there they live for that moment
[1:34:40] right there they they they they are
[1:34:41] waiting on that moment of recognition
[1:34:43] where people recognize him and they they
[1:34:45] called out their name and man it felt
[1:34:47] good when when you know when you know
[1:34:49] you just you fell in line to it and you
[1:34:50] were just you were there but you there
[1:34:53] are people that that are looking for
[1:34:55] those accolades and they're looking for
[1:34:56] their rewards but they never put in the
[1:34:58] time to learn out their lines and they
[1:35:00] never put in the time to to make them
[1:35:02] themselves accountable unto under the
[1:35:03] work of the Lord you see a lot of people
[1:35:05] like rewards but they never want to show
[1:35:08] up so I'm saying this to you if you want
[1:35:10] some rewards if you want to set on his

[1:35:23] defeat Satan right here in his Eden then
[1:35:26] we've got to put in a
[1:35:32] time that was
[1:35:36] free brother I I I was reading this last
[1:35:39] night I got home and I was reading over
[1:35:40] some notes and brother maram started
[1:35:43] talking about Stephen he said he's a man
[1:35:45] full of the Holy Ghost I don't know if
[1:35:47] this fits here or not but I'm going to
[1:35:48] say it he said but he said man Steph was
[1:35:51] a man full of the Holy Ghost he said you
[1:35:52] couldn't put him out on the house he was
[1:35:53] like like a house on fire on a windy day
[1:35:55] he stood out there and he wasn't a
[1:35:56] preacher he was a deacon he stood out
[1:35:58] there and he was living his life and he
[1:35:59] was teaching all of them and he was
[1:36:00] telling them all about taking them all
[1:36:01] the way from David all the way to Jesus
[1:36:03] Christ and took him out there and
[1:36:05] brother BR I found this amazing is
[1:36:07] brother Bram said to he he said now he
[1:36:08] said he said domain runs from eternity
[1:36:10] to Eternity he said but when a man sits
[1:36:12] down he said that means he's finished
[1:36:14] his work and Jesus sat down on the right
[1:36:17] hand on the right hand of God he was
[1:36:18] sitting there and all of a sudden
[1:36:20] brother man said that that because Sten
[1:36:22] was such a man he said almighty God
[1:36:25] brush back the skies he said it must
[1:36:28] have been something Steven must have
[1:36:30] really meant something to him so he
[1:36:32] stood up so he stood up and he said he
[1:36:35] welcome stepen back
[1:36:37] home I say this I'll say that the King
[1:36:40] of Kings one of these days is going to
[1:36:42] stand up and it's going to come for his
[1:36:44] bride you must mean something very
[1:36:46] powerful to him so he stands up from his
[1:36:49] finished
[1:36:51] work one of these days is's going going
[1:36:53] to roll back to the
[1:36:55] skies and he's going to come and catch
[1:36:57] you no I ain't talking about I ain't
[1:36:59] talking about thr at the world she's a
[1:37:01] Rapture ass I'm talking about right now

[1:37:05] back the Skies over your life he's
[1:37:07] rolling them back and saying you're
[1:37:09] worthy you're worthy because in this
[1:37:11] hour the lamb stood up not in Paul not
[1:37:15] in Paul's day not in Luther's day not in
[1:37:17] Wesley's day but in this day the lamb
[1:37:20] stood up
[1:37:24] let me drive this our King has power
[1:37:27] he's got power over physical ailments
[1:37:30] he's got power over the natural world he
[1:37:32] can turn water into wine he can walk on
[1:37:35] water he can feed 5,000 our King has
[1:37:38] power over death proving it when he
[1:37:40] raised Jar's daughter he proved it when
[1:37:42] he raised Lazarus from the grave he
[1:37:44] proved it when he raised the Widow of
[1:37:46] Na's son he has the power over the
[1:37:48] supernatural when he would cast demons
[1:37:50] out by laying hands on them he has the
[1:37:52] power he has power over the supernatural
[1:37:55] when he spoke to Legion he has the power
[1:37:57] over the supernatural when the boy that
[1:37:59] came to him that was thrown into the
[1:38:01] fire by that demon that epileptic boy
[1:38:05] that demon had to recognize when it come
[1:38:07] to them disciples he seen that there was
[1:38:09] no there was no real surrender there but
[1:38:12] when he come to Jesus he saw there was
[1:38:14] an anointing there there was a power
[1:38:16] there there was a life
[1:38:18] there the Bible said in Romans 14-1 17
[1:38:21] that the kingdom of God is not meat and
[1:38:24] drink but it's righteousness and peace
[1:38:27] and joy in the Holy Ghost it ain't just
[1:38:30] natural things it ain't just going to
[1:38:32] church but it's about having the power
[1:38:34] it's about having righteousness it's
[1:38:36] about having peace on Monday and Joy on
[1:38:39] Tuesday it's talking about having the
[1:38:41] Holy Ghost throughout all the entirety
[1:38:43] of your
[1:38:44] life and if you're going to be a king if
[1:38:47] you're going to be a king like the Bible
[1:38:49] said he hath made us Kings
[1:38:54] yeah the major difference between King
[1:38:57] David and King
[1:38:59] Saul was Saul was willing to let things
[1:39:05] live he was willing to let things live
[1:39:08] so he let King AAG the king of the
[1:39:10] amalekites he let him live instead of
[1:39:12] putting things to death that should have
[1:39:14] been put to death the major difference
[1:39:16] between him and David was that David was
[1:39:19] not going to allow any Philistine or any
[1:39:22] Amite to stand there in a god place in
[1:39:25] the position of God's
[1:39:30] word so Saul didn't reverence the king's
[1:39:34] word you study out your
[1:39:40] demons you study them out you know how
[1:39:42] they come to
[1:39:44] you you watch somebody's got a lust
[1:39:46] devil you study out you know when it's
[1:39:49] coming you know you got somebody that's
[1:39:51] got a got a jealous Spirit on them you
[1:39:53] know when it's
[1:39:55] coming you watch somebody that's got
[1:39:57] maybe a pornographic devil on them they
[1:40:00] know when it's
[1:40:01] coming you study them out and Amite you
[1:40:05] begin to study out an amit's movements
[1:40:07] throughout the Bible that Amite I know I
[1:40:09] ain't saying that right the Amite he's
[1:40:12] persistent he's a sneaky little
[1:40:15] booger but he's a very distructive Force
[1:40:18] I'll tell you what an amot does an amot
[1:40:21] will come in behind you he'll sneaking
[1:40:23] behind you and he'll steal your joy away
[1:40:25] he'll steal your health away he'll steal
[1:40:26] your family away he steal your wife
[1:40:29] away why because Saul Let Him
[1:40:33] Live Saul let him live but you look back
[1:40:36] over and and I believe it's numbers
[1:40:40] or Exodus 17 that you'll see that that
[1:40:44] that Moses wasn't going to allow any of
[1:40:46] them amenites to live and God wasn't
[1:40:48] going to let him live so he seen that as
[1:40:51] long as as long as Moses's hands were
[1:40:54] held up that they that they Israel begin
[1:40:57] to win the war but when he let down his
[1:41:00] hands he let down his hands then the
[1:41:02] amates be to win and wage war over top
[1:41:04] of Israel so there were some faithful
[1:41:06] brothers and sisters that got around the
[1:41:08] message of the hour and they began to
[1:41:09] lift it back up into place and all of a
[1:41:11] sudden all of a sudden they begin to
[1:41:12] wage war and they begin to win the war
[1:41:15] and you'll find out that Israel won the
[1:41:17] battle because Moses's hands were hung
[1:41:21] up and they wasn't going to fall down
[1:41:23] well Jesus thought so much of you that
[1:41:26] on the day on on the day that he was
[1:41:29] crucified he let the Roman soldiers
[1:41:31] pierce his hands up on the cross because
[1:41:34] he didn't want you to go down and defeat
[1:41:36] he held his hands up there and said as
[1:41:39] long as I got my hands up they're going
[1:41:41] to win this war what am I saying don't
[1:41:44] be AA kill
[1:41:46] AAG you see what happened the prophet
[1:41:49] had to come back in line to the king's
[1:41:52] word and step step right in there to
[1:41:54] finish what Saul refused to do don't be
[1:41:57] a Saul be a David kill that King kill
[1:42:02] King complex kill King stigma kill King
[1:42:07] fear kill King doubt kill it kill
[1:42:12] it go to Joshua 10 go to Joshua 12 go
[1:42:16] read it all 31 Kings look over their
[1:42:19] domain but Joshua was not willing that
[1:42:23] the King AI would
[1:42:26] live 36 men died that day in AI this
[1:42:32] ain't never happened
[1:42:34] before what's
[1:42:36] wrong what
[1:42:38] happened something maybe Joshua was lost
[1:42:41] his
[1:42:43] anointing but while they was down there
[1:42:45] in Jericho and they got to looking at
[1:42:47] the enticements of the
[1:42:48] world they started letting some things
[1:42:50] live
[1:42:53] and they didn't recognize the king's
[1:42:55] word they didn't recognize so they
[1:42:57] started they started bringing in some
[1:42:58] things I say this it's time to kill King
[1:43:01] doubt it's time to kill that Amite
[1:43:03] spirit it's time to kill AAG it's time
[1:43:06] to stop listening to the blading of of
[1:43:09] the goats and the Lambs out there and
[1:43:10] it's time to start it's time to start
[1:43:12] dealing it's time to start dealing with

[1:47:56] he's here I say he's here in power I say
[1:47:59] he's here in demonstration I say he's
[1:48:03] here I say he's worth
[1:48:09] worshiping me and brother Matthew Mard
[1:48:12] was out in
[1:48:15] Oklahoma and we we was out there
[1:48:18] preaching a a youth meeting and but
[1:48:20] Matthew was there we come down last
[1:48:23] service man that meeting was just
[1:48:27] powerful just
[1:48:30] powerful I'll be honest that's the
[1:48:32] thickest I've ever seen
[1:48:34] it be honest it's is the thickest I've
[1:48:37] ever seen the presence of the Lord and I
[1:48:39] believe you could attest to it and your
[1:48:41] wife and it was so
[1:48:44] physical but it reminded
[1:48:46] me when the prophet was over in that
[1:48:48] foreign country and then people was
[1:48:51] packing their idols
[1:48:54] and they started throwing down their
[1:48:56] Idols brother brand said it was such a
[1:48:58] dust cloud that raised up it reminded me
[1:49:02] that when people start throwing down
[1:49:03] idols and throwing down all these things
[1:49:05] that holding them back all of a sudden
[1:49:06] the presence of God come
[1:49:09] down I know Satan will try to block you
[1:49:12] Vision with with clouds of doubt and
[1:49:14] clouds of fear but why don't you let the
[1:49:16] presence of the Lord just drop in your
[1:49:18] heart it's something very powerful when
[1:49:20] you go to talking about the Lord he'll
[1:49:22] he'll come
[1:49:23] I was talking about this same instance
[1:49:26] just a few weeks ago I was riding around
[1:49:27] with some boys in Florida it invited me
[1:49:30] to go on a Gator hunt and I was down
[1:49:32] there and they were just talking about
[1:49:33] the presence of the Lord and all of a
[1:49:34] sudden I wasn't going to say this but I
[1:49:36] I just feel I just feel it would bless
[1:49:40] you I we was just talking about that
[1:49:42] same
[1:49:43] event it was that event that changed
[1:49:46] your
[1:49:48] life
[1:49:49] right and we just riding in the car we
[1:49:53] talk about it because I had prayed if if
[1:49:56] God wanted me to go do this I don't go
[1:49:59] to Every invitation but a gator hunt was
[1:50:01] pretty
[1:50:01] cool and uh I was I was uh we was just
[1:50:07] talking about that I was talking about
[1:50:08] this instance about the presence of the
[1:50:10] Lord being that thinki and just start
[1:50:11] talking I found that when you start
[1:50:13] talking about the
[1:50:14] king it begins to show his
[1:50:18] glory that's why don't surprise me if
[1:50:20] you you sit here and you see a flicker l
[1:50:22] or you see a you see like a star just
[1:50:25] kind of go through the room I've seen
[1:50:27] him multiple times here this morning it
[1:50:30] doesn't changed one thing about whether
[1:50:31] I see it or whether I don't I know he's
[1:50:33] here because his word says he's here but
[1:50:35] we started talking about it right here
[1:50:37] in the car we starts talking about these
[1:50:39] Supernatural events and I look over at
[1:50:41] the brother and he all of a sudden that
[1:50:45] that he was just moved by the presence
[1:50:48] of the Lord and you could see you could
[1:50:49] see like every fiber of his being was on
[1:50:51] fire of the Holy Ghost
[1:50:54] and we had prayed for a super it was
[1:50:56] like a sonic boom went off in my ear and
[1:50:59] all of a sudden the presence of the Lord
[1:51:00] was just sitting right
[1:51:02] there now I said that to say this is
[1:51:06] that when you start talking about a
[1:51:08] king a king begins to take the throne
[1:51:11] room of your heart it begins to manifest
[1:51:14] his glory I believe it was uh brother he
[1:51:16] ain't sitting up here brother Gavin
[1:51:18] wherever he's at he in he in this he's
[1:51:21] in this same building
[1:51:23] and brother Wayne Lawson was ministering
[1:51:25] and all of a sudden the pillar fire
[1:51:27] showed up he I believe he said that that
[1:51:29] service was real scary daddy something
[1:51:31] like that he said well why was it scary
[1:51:34] he said because that fire that fire well
[1:51:38] that same service there was people that
