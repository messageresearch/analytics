the book and to loose the seven seals thereof verse nine and they sing a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seven seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to

a man God is so gracious to us and to see his wonderful acts amongst us what a mighty God that we serve I sent a clip a little scripture that I was reading in Psalms reading this morning over in Psalms chapter one 19 and 16 David said that I would delight myself in thy statues that I will not forget thy words and when we delight ourselves in something we won't forget it is that right if it's a pleasant time in the Lord you won't forget it if it if it's a drab time for you you'll forget these things but I can tell you for the children of God I don't think there's ever a drab time and his presence but it's things that we delight ourselves in the Lord and we know that we have a faithful high priest that is standing amongst us today that is more than able to meet the needs that we would present to him today we want to continue to lift up our pastor brother Ron he'll be speaking for us this morning we ask that the Lord would use him in a mighty way were so thrilled with what the Lord is doing in his life and we can truly say that we're seeing miracles in front of us we started out this this year with the theme that we will see miracles and if you have not seen a miracle you have not got your eyes open hallelujah to have our pastor standing in this pulpit today is an absolute miracle I say blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be his holy name the doctors told him they was given in four months when they gave him when they seen the brain tumor for the very first time they told him you've probably got about four months to live I told you he had a knack for breaking what the doctors had said and that don't surprise me because it's not Ron Spencer it's Elohim so I'm so thankful to know that he's in our presence so we want to continue to lift up brother on and pray for him today that God would use him in a special way to be able to speak to us and the people in Edmonton today that God would bless both congregations and the bride around the world I want to lift up sister Karen Pruitt still there and in need and we're just thinking the Lord for her continued healing in her body dear church family please pray for my sister and her husband who both have Kovach

[Applause] yes [Music] [Music] god bless you you can be seated a moment god bless you too to my family and in Edmonton Canada as well this morning we certainly love you with all of our hearts and brother Harold and sister Lian and brother and and sister sandy and brother Moses that Minister there what a team that they have and what an a group of people that they have there we certainly love you with all of our hearts as well as the people here you know sometimes Satan thinks he's got us all buffaloed and it just seems like you can't be in touch with one another but God knows how to arrange things and so amen we love you with all of our hearts and we love you there we wish we could be there they've they've got me restricted flying right now for the for the time being because of the tumors and and different things but I believe that will resolve itself before long and so I'd like to thank you this would be my first time addressing you in Edmonton but I'd like to thank you for your prayers over the last months and I remember 12 years ago you prayed for me that when I came through the burns that my face would not be disfigured and you prayed as a body of believers brother Harold who has been my buddy hero for so long and and we've traveled and did a lot of things together and and and so we brother Harold had you as an audience to pray that my face would not scar in the Bernsen and it didn't and we thank the Lord for that I don't know particularly what you prayed for on this journey but over the last six months since about Christmas when we were diagnosed with cancer and then Stage four and brain cancer and then lung cancer I don't know particularly what part that you decided to pray for but I'd like to thank you for praying for that part and [Music] what you don't realize only a few weeks ago I was hardly able to stand in the pool fit to speak but this morning I feel strong as they did in December I'm thinking the Lord for that [Applause] [Music] hallelujah it's a paradox we're just at the prep just before they doubled the chemo and you know the medicine is the same but you see a couple of weeks ago we were inspired to make a trip 17 hours and to be with brother Tim Pruitt and his wife in the situation that is going on there but it was during the service just previous before that that I must get to Jesus you know sometimes God could heal us right exactly where we are but I felt that inspiration in the middle of the night that spoke to me you spoke it and it seemed like an insane trip but and I spoke to Andrew about it and he made the arrangements very quickly and and brother Alden and brother Adam quickly agreed to drive that trip secretly because nobody else wanted me to make such a trip as that but I just felt on my heart I had to get get there and it was in a prayer meeting on Tuesday night that the Lord came in a supernatural wagon did an incredible work for us and we since that night it's not been the same [Applause] [Music] a man a man so you continue to pray for us as we we journey through the different curves and we certainly love you this is your body as well and we as from Virginia love you with all of our hearts and you know we didn't have to buy a ticket we did have to eat airplane food we didn't have to worry about being on a schedule we're not sleeping in a hotel room hallelujah and we're going to have service together here this morning amen [Music] amen brother Harold felt that this was the will of the Lord and I just felt an unction of the Spirit of God as we begin to make some preparations and I Andrew as Andrew as you know does most of our preparing now and what an awesome job that he did last night but the things that he does behind the scenes it's just incredible and and in this season of life he's just been a lifesaver to me and I thought last night was as good as I've ever heard him preach and so a man I hope you enjoyed it there in Edmonton this was already on my heart before I knew anything about the Edmonton meetings and so I believe that this morning is going to be epic for not just here but for Edmonton and a lot of places and so and so I begin and I want to lay a little groundwork for not just Edmonton but also for you when God inspires us to speak a sermon God uses man he doesn't he doesn't use a piano to speak his word he doesn't use a guitar he uses man and he uses us to speak and many times it's even in prophetic words that he is using and sometimes we're sitting in a service and cannot fathom what he's doing even as a speaker even as a speaker we don't understand what he's doing in the moment that he's doing it until that we can look back and see that God was orchestrating some events how many of ever said in a service to wear that that you were said in there and you maybe went 30 40 minutes in the service and then all the sudden you realized he's talking to me he's the discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the hearts he he knows exactly what's going on and he can gather thousands of people together and yet be so intimate Kelly comes to you and that service and you go did they pick out that service just for me so last year I was I was just being pushed to war driven to order a thought and that thought I would deliver it in a couple of different places one of which would be Edmonton and an Edmond and I would speak it and I think it was one of the first places that I spoke it and I think I came home and spoke it later here and that sermon would be take it back and I I don't want to do this by redundance but I but I want to look back at that being prophecy and I want to look at this as being fulfilled where yes because they would say that there's very few people has been through what we have been through in the last six months one side of the trial and now on the other side of the trial with a lot of with a lot of uncertainty in front and Satan's saying a lot of things in front of us but we're going to make a declaration and I feel anointed to make a declaration it's time to pursue it and overtake it and have a full restoration could you agree with us as this morning [Music] [Applause] [Music] Amen list and to her feet this morning and we just want to share some scriptures with you [Music] now I have a very good feeling that I'm not the only one in this boat and so if Satan stole some stuff from you today's a good day to put him on notice this is more than a service this is more than a sermon this is more than a preacher we're just not any church we're the bride of Jesus Christ and this is an open book and we're people of the open book and every promise in this book is my baby baby do I sound strong enough brother Jordan don't sound like no sick man Dora Psalms 23 and 1 the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures and he leadeth me beside the still waters and it restores my soul and he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake Wow here's a scripture we're fulfilling yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me not my friends not my friends not my buddies oh they're with me but Jesus is with me amen thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou prepares the table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with all in my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen you may be seated may the Lord bless the reading of his words this morning I want to go to the end of the book in revelations 21 and verse 1 and I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first Earth were wrought were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God how many of you believe that you're a part of that promise before we go any further this morning in the infinite mind of God I'm a part of that promise so if he could get you here if he could watch over all your gene seed all the way since Adam and he could get you here can he get you there [Applause] hallelujah and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow or crime as human beings we can't compromise even comprehend a world with no death no tears of agony no sorrow no dying we cannot compromise even comprehend a forest with it with no dead leaves laying at it not one blade of grass dead no rose wilted but we're headed to such a lamp he that setteth upon the throne sis behold I make all things new and he said unto me write these words are true and faithful God says these words that I have just spoke to you John are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end and I will give unto them that is athirst of the fountain of water of the life freely hallelujah he that overcometh shall I in shall inherit all things Kris this is for you what you call your name this is for me and I will be his God and he shall be my son now the one that wrote it like that is also the one that wrote it like this in Psalms 27 through David his prophet the the Lord is my light and my salvation of whom shall I feel the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked and even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will I be confident one thing I have desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord forever how never lose my focus no matter how bad the battle come on church so many people blame everybody around them because of their battle because of their discourage him because of what they're going through never lose your focus because of what you're going through for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock and now shut my head be lifted up above my enemies round about their fall I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of joy I will sing I will sing praises unto the Lord not the choir will sing for me or my favorite singers were sinful men but in the midst of all of the trouble when the world is falling apart political systems have fallen apart churches are falling apart people are falling apart come on church stay with me I will encourage myself I will stop when I'm the only one standing there by myself I won't begin to sink I won't begin to lift my spirits I will begin to fellowship with Almighty God for in the time of trouble in in Revelation chapter 3 in verse 20 behold I stand at the door and knock Jesus is standing at this door and knocking and If any man will hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me now notice these words to him that overcometh not to him that survived us not to give that just mix away or to him that serves God on Sunday and then it's different the rest of them yes but to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I've sat down with my father in his throne revelations chapter 12 forgive me he says and I heard a loud voice in heaven saying now there comes a junction now is come salvation and strength and the Kingdom of our Lord and the power of his Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony you've got to take this personal nobody's going to overcome for you but you I want you to say this with you nobody's going to overcome for me but me this is my power and this is my time you are what you are when you by yourself [Applause] this rapture is about you and God it is individual the Word of God this ain't magic this ain't some special spell or some special recipe this ain't just magic quotes magic words this isn't some myth of Hollywood this is not churchianity you have been placed in Laodicea the wickedest work condition the world has ever seen it is a world that put Jesus outside of the door and said they don't need him in their home in their churches in their governments they took their Ten Commandments down and told God they didn't need it and churches became weak pulpits men became sissies wait with me don't believe it on the governess don't believe it on the presidents don't blame it on the king´s overseas come on Trix we have we are reaping the seeds that have been sold but God also made some sowing he has showed a bride in this interim that will not Bend and will not bow but she will take the Word of God and she will prevail [Applause] baby idiot lazy boy brother on people fall away we had this conversation coming down the road people do this people does that people dress this way people dress that way and people have that kind of music people are caught up with this and people are caught up with that and I just finally said to to sister Cluny and sister Nancy I said well Jesus had some words for that Jesus was on his way of the cross and people were doing everything in the world and people are doing all of that and doing all of that and the disciples we're talking about it and Jesus just spoke up said what is that to you let's just examine it just a moment oh but my loved ones are doing that they're just don't you know they're just nothing but cosmic dust and if they don't reach for mercy there's a hell but they are sending themselves there it's not you it's not you they rejected the light you accepted the light and they rejected to light and it puts you on two complete different paths even Spurgeon would say they're just dust I'm supposed to take it easy Romans 8 and verse 31 what shall we then say to these things now let's just look at where we're at just now and I I don't want to spend 30 minutes here but let's just look at where we're at right now with the world falling apart but it's supposed to do that but the bride has been gathered and we were supposed to be gathered and where did he gathered us from from all ends of the earth we didn't gather ourselves to this message God gathered us to this message and we heard a voice and it was real and that voice gathered us to this word and we just recognized the word and the word spoke volumes to us and it became real so he gathers you thought you were in control of your life and then you recognize God was in control then we recognized that we were pre-planned before the foundational world we recognized we were in the mind of God we recognize that we're part of an orchestration that God has taken part in and whether it was Abraham or Sarah or Rahab or me a Meyer a Jeremiah and Mabel or Gomer or for whatever matter their names were called in the scripture whether it was Shamgar that would defeat six hundred men and and of all of the entire Bible God uses one scripture to tell his life story where it was that the woman into well that brother Branham would use night after night after night and she goes to a well and she's had five husbands and the one she's living with not her husband but she goes to the well and Jesus sends his disciples away and Jesus goes to the well and waits on her he was gathering the seed and that's what he's even doing today he's gathering his seed and in the matter of a little bit of a conversation she recognizes this is the Messiah Oh brethren I don't know how that new birth works let me just say you can't meet Jesus and walk away the same person I don't know I don't understand all the mysteries you can't make Jesus of this word and walk away the same person oh you might say I don't know how that fits together how I fit in it but let me just say this - God's got a plan for your life [Applause] if God be for us who can be against us now we're just laying some things down here and he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things now you thought I was just being a little dyslexic reading my works slow he's telling you brother Nathaniel there's nothing in the book he will hold nothing nothing are you catching that then why can't we believe for all things then why can't we believe for all things but better on some things are impossible are they are they are they are they are they look at your net but are they what a Bunny's grace waited what about his grace don't be surprised at this very last end as we're coming toward the raptured days as we're coming in people that come to the well that are so disqualified that have such filthy lives that are so since cards and tell you it you would probably in normal life not said nowhere near them in a restaurant must let Church but God so rich in mercy there's a table that's gotta be full and he said go to the hedges in the highways and bid them to come just in vitam just in vitamin and your invitation spade something to their hearts and they go I believe a will I can speak volumes right there verse 37 a and all these things were more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded this is Paul's writings for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor things to come nor things to come go ahead and say my thanks to Tom Satan keeps telling you he's gonna make a blow at you nor things to come and I'm saying it Plus Lee nothing's to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord last year I read a scripture and I'm not going to go back and reread your scriptures but it was in 1st Samuel chapter 30 and it was where the Amalekites David came back from from incredible victory and they were all all of his men were shouting and all of them were singing a lot of them were dancing and all of them were doing great things and they were all happy and they were on their way home and they were on their way home and they were they had had an incredible victory all of us enjoy incredible victories all of us enjoy victories we all enjoy having testimony services and song services after we've just had a victory but you find a full listing and the Felicity to stand out front and he'll boast and he'll bragged and he'll tell you how big he is and he'll tell you what he's gonna do to you but remember you've got a sling remember you've got five stones you've met his kind before but David on his way home as a tight for us David on his way home the Endicott's had came and destroyed his homes his wives had taken all of their possessions not just the king but taken every man that had in a way and all of the company of Israel and taken all their goods you know that's what the enemy wants to do he don't want to just make you sick he wants to cure you he don't want to just turn you and get you out of church he wants to lead you into sin and get you into real trouble and to destroy your [Applause] he wants to make a slave out it he wants to do a lot of things together if he can just get your focus up just a little bit and if you remember last year as we were standing in Edmonton and I was preaching to you that David stood there and now his men as they were standing on the ashes of their homes these homes had had a had had where the Spirit of God had been there with him and they had danced and shouted read the scriptures together and enjoyed the presence of God but now their wives were gone their children were gone their treasures was gone their families was gone their environment was gone and they're standing on the ashes and now the men want to turn against the leader because the enemy has done this to them it proves to us that you cannot lose your focus and you must keep it on God Edmonton especially at your place I read to you and I tried to recount it this last couple of days of how many scriptures that are read but I read hundreds of scriptures to you about and David encouraged himself now that was then before a trial no doubt that that sermon blessed many people and I got many letters and many calls and many texts over that sermon of how that it touched people's lives now if it would do it then I want to come back and touch it now I want to come back and touch it now remember when I stood there and I begin to say to us it's our responsibility to take it back [Applause] the words of God was takes it back this is where David has to encourage himself as I look back God was speaking prophetically not just to me but to many others speaking to the bride of Jesus Christ sending it around the world we are people of the open book we are the bride we're not just a church we are the bride we have not been gathered to the personality of a man we're not man followers were not a court where the bride of Jesus Christ Jesus has lifted our mists and none of us because where Jesus is I will draw all men unto me God will not tolerate worship to no mana or to no image it must be to him and him alone just as the first commandment would be as I've looked back standing on that platform there and now I said here today and I thought over the last couple of weeks is it's time for this sermon to be preached and God just kept bringing it back up not knowing that Edmonton would be a part of this as well as other congregations that God has inspired me to speak this to the last time that I would speak such a sermon like this was at brother miss Colson but the Tom race and God would do much work there in that service naturally think of service is just a service and I just want to I just now I want to focus something so that these next few minutes will become real when is a service more than just a service at brother Joe greens I would speak to service and they would feel some resistance in the service and they would just stop feeling it and I would feel some things in and very cautious about how things are God's not a showman for nobody and as they begin to make some statements that if the audience don't want it God will operate behind the curtain if an audience is not receptive to it God will go to move behind the curtain and the service takes place and and and a few come to the author and they pray for them and one of them was sister Charlotte as sister Charlotte had had had suffered sugar diabetes for many years in her life and God just come and touched her body right there in the service and then another sister right behind her got a supernatural touch and they just happened right the corner and then another young lady and I just turned around and and and I never I don't think I even gathered my Bible and I just stepped behind a curtain you were there Matthew was there how Dan you were there and as a step by the height but behind the curtain what you dissed and sister Anna your sister was involved and her sister was sitting there this could be in grow and she was she was standing and she was standing in that service behind that curtain nobody could see her back there but she was doing work behind the curtains in the technical booth and as I passed by and I walked by all the sudden something turned me like that and God spoke to me to go to her and he began to speak just a couple of things to her then only she would know and then her husband would know and I prayed for them that they'd have that child was it just the service listened in just a few days avoiding charlie is getting ready to be born [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] then another young man would step up and his wife would step up and she stepped before and and and then the Lord told her exactly what was going on and then and then and then her hospital would stand there and and and and God would speak to him he had ran from the Lord for 17 years and God would speak to him he's now preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ [Music] was it just a service I'd say it was more than a service brother gido my friend and many of your friends even in Edmonton would step they have to step out and he was standing there and gido had been in a meeting the South Carolina and while it was in South Carolina he was standing there amongst about 40 40 preachers 60 preachers God would call guiteau's name and tell him you got a letter in your a girl in your case in your hotel and it's a critics letter pay no attention to it and he carried that letter for me to read pay no attention to it veto would come the next week to North Carolina and said in the mission meetings there at North Carolina and then and then standing there it would be the last time we'd see each other and standing there as he's watching all of these events happened and the Lord spoke to him as couple specific things and then God spoke to him said Geeta there's a train coming it's okay for you to get on it was it me or was it God was it me or was it God this isn't your back is hurting your bellies hurting some man trying to make himself out act like brother branham no it's the same God if you can just get rid of the Scarecrow's it's the same God [Applause] not just happening here it's happening around the world had a special friends name's Terry Terry was standing there and as he's standing there brother Joe we'd been friends for many years as a matter of fact we were the kind of friends that he had let me hunting his treestand and his boys all of the years of their growing up never got to hunting treestand brother Joe Green never got to hunt in the treestand no other evangelist pastor nobody got to hunting to trace that but he let me hunt in history staff Terry had said in church for years decades since they've been married and he was an incredible guy he had an incredible personality and he'd never give his heart to the Lord he'd never surrendered he knew what was right and he would do some what you might say preaching but he had never surrendered his life to the Lord and he was standing there and he watched all of those events happen there that night this service was more than a service I hope you're catching some things now not just here in Edmonton here and in Edmonton and Terry and Terry said I can serve a god like that hello was a Andrew I'd say sixty couple and one day I want you to ask yourself in Edmonton and now what have you done with your time how important is the moment right now how important is the moment right now and Terry's had a lot of complexes but in that moment he said I can serve a god like that young people may be moms and dads is held back for decades they don't take they don't take 10 minutes I wonder all the pettiness of life and and the blame games of life and what about you you serve a god like that I grabbed you brother and it was a very emotional moment for me because I realized this was not just a time moment this is eternal and the seat which God had deposited before the foundation of the world was now having a moment two weeks later Terry would would find out he had cancer didn't know it before and in a couple of months I would stand at his funeral and they held that funeral to like agree that and I stood with every confidence brother Vernon that a man could stand with and say this man met her real good and stood in a real moment and his life was changed in that moment never to go back let's just say glory be to God how important is a moment it's life and death maybe the enemy seems to have destroyed a lot of things in your life God didn't make me sick because God don't make people sick God didn't make me sick that was in my DNA and it started out somewhere they don't know where it started out but it started out in there maybe it was a place on my face maybe it was a place on my leg and it's in there and it's been in there for we don't know but we know it was at least been in there eight years it's what they're saying in that eight years supernatural offense have happened while I was there now hang with me just a moment so during that process of time this body was taken on death and at the paradox of the same time some of the most phenomenal miracles that mortal beings can visibly watch God was doing through the same body are you with me dad been raised teachers been healed people coming out of wheelchairs death Theory finish and coming back are you with me type low pressure sugar diabetes and the greatest miracle of all is drunks and prostitutes drug addicts and even religious people hallelujah switch is the greatest miracle of them all can get a new birth and a transformation because we're not rehab sinners this is not a place where you come and live with your sins will not rehab centers formation centers is a paradox where life and death works right side by side so did we just when death begins to operate and destroys our homes and destroys months of our lives do we just stand and say well this is the way that it's going to be get our bucket list together fill it out and then start to try to fulfill it or do we ask believe us say I don't need you to pity me I need you to rejoice with me [Applause] do we lie and say we don't have a bad day no do we look at our problems and our situations and just say well I got it coming to me we just mark those days down as bad days and say Satan you tormented me on this day so now you're guilty because God is a just God and being a just God he won't even whip the devil unless he's got a just cause and then God says there's no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper now I might be fighting cancer but I'm not quit [Music] I'm not volts in a way and I'm not scared of it and I'm not a coward so when you look down the line and there stands Ron Spencer he ain't runnin he ain't a coward and he ain't turning back [Applause] [Music] now I want to ask you if I can stand here under these conditions now I'm going to preach to you what about you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Applause] Oh [Applause] [Music] come on okay I'll see you in the morning [Applause] [Music] now this might be a simple simple thought as I close I'm not going to be long because I wanted to I want it to last it's up to you it's up to you it's up to you it's up to you we're not waiting on God to fulfill his part right take these off we're not waiting on God to fulfill his part Edmonton we're not waiting on God to fulfill his part he's done everything that he can do it's our turn the grand said we were the final voice to the final age he said God's looking for thousands of live voices are you with me well then said I'm so glad a man can so completely serve God until the desert serve God tell the devil don't know what to do with him are you with me yes all of those are powerful quotes the scripture said greater is He that is in you than he that it's in the world it is true jesus said if he abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will when when the boys went down in Acts chapter 3 and said silver and gold have I none but such as I have give up thee in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk this is an action Scripture we are not waiting on somebody else to do the job or somebody else coming we're here we're here you don't have to wait on a blog to come out or some favorite thing to come out it's you and God it's you in this message it's you in the Word of God this message is more than a script it's more than just words that are poetically put together but this message is Christ given to the bride of Jesus Christ not to be imitated but to be lived Satan don't have enough you don't have enough he would have already defeated you if he had enough hema needed this week the devil's talk to you don't listen to him he's a liar and he tells you all different kind of things he would have already cooked you if he had enough I think the devil would've killed is going to kill me well here's where I want to come down to this morning brother a we're buddies but when Satan got the opportunity somewhere and now I'm closing because I'm gonna go back to 2007 witness convention and I preached there that the devil Kate touch a hair of your head until he gots permission from God he cannot touch one red or gray hair of my head until he got permission from God so somewhere God and him had a conversation and before then I would go through this round God said I got confidence and it wasn't confidence in the flesh of Ron Spencer or the confidence of it in you in your flesh when he had confidence in the seed brother William and that seed has eternal life in it with me and God has watched over that seed that he deposited before the foundation well he's watched over that seed that seed is eternal you remember a little bit ago we said and I saw a new heaven and a new earth and then God will be with him and got a watch over them and he will be their God and he'll wipe away the tears are their eyes so he watched over you before the foundation world and he watched over you doing your mom and dad and he watched over your grandfather and all the way down the line he's watched over you now and he's going to get you there and you'll go through trials and God said I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you but I'll be with you to the end of the world [Music] and though this body was kind of discouraged when it heard about that it had three tumors in it and they were all full of cancer and the lungs were full of cancer and the cancer was trying to spread sure it brings all kind of worry and agony and situation but God didn't fail me there he ain't failing me now [Applause] [Music] if he couldn't touch a hair of my hand without this permission it was that God that gave him permission then that God is with me and that God told David pursue it overtake it recovered all lovely scriptures and musicians come without fail recover all did you hear that words without fail without fail I want you to repeat this works with me was not failure without fail now Edmonton you may not understand but I'm having to preach short sermons it's made I've been too short I don't know how long I've reached because I'm because I'm weary in my flesh but sometimes short sermons are powerful but I don't know what you're fighting in Edmonton or in Louisiana or in North Carolina or wherever you hear this sermon this sermons more than about Ron Spencer you're watching a miracle I don't know if you can fathom what we have been through but my family has been dreary has been very good to me and when I've been laying in the floor and having to be helped at the bathroom and that can be on days like today in a moment's notice but the Donny you know that I mean chemo can make you sick and you can have this stronger day and then take chemo and in a matter of about 20 minutes you're you're tough shape but our neighbors don't know anything about it my friends don't know anything about it but this church many of them know how weak that I've been but you have watched a miracle happen to hear in this audience you've watched a miracle happen my doctor stood Wednesday and said you've had the best two weeks in six months [Applause] [Music] I Got News for you I know years ahead of me [Applause] [Music] here from the closing thought you as a world has watch God perform a miracle in front of your eyes now I'm going to say some statements that may take you off your off your step system moment Satan can't stop this Satan can't stop this I felt a reservation I thought maybe your unbelief but Satan can't stop it so we're going to speak to it cancerous tumors have to live now let me just let me just say this it is nothing to what God's getting ready to do listen what he's doing to my body right now is literally kindergarten you ready for this you ready for this it's nothing to what God's getting ready to do there's been people in the grave for 2,000 years and you can do their best just trying to figure out

your joy if he stole your peace if he stole your health if he stole your life if he stole your family if he stole your deliverance if he stole your happiness if he stole your family from you it's a
