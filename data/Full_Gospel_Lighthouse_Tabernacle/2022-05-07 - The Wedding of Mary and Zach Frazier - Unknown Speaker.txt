[Music] you may be seated on behalf of the families we would like to thank each and every one of you for coming today what a glorious day that this is how god has blessed this whole event and we're so thankful for and we celebrate this moment of two lives becoming one and we're very honored to be a part of it we know that god has an infinite purpose in this day he's already expressed that in several different ways i would like to think on behalf of them for special guests brother kelly and sister myra hildebrandt for being here from saskatoon canada and so we certainly love them with all of our hearts there's also guests watching on from another dimension and two of them would be dottie and rodney that would be watching as a part of this today two years ago i had a vision and that vision was that we would be standing here at this altar mary and zach and i told them that vision two years ago that we would be standing here it would be a glimpse of what god knows in the future and as i heard them talk about wanting to have an outside wedding we planned it i watched it take place i told sister connie i said i can't tell him anything i can't put any influence on it but god said would be according to the vision be standing here i think it's really interesting that god in all of his infinite wisdom in all the world spinning in their orbit he cares about the little bitty details of the situations of our lives so we realize that this wedding has supernatural element to it all together i personally want to congratulate you too before once again before you get married the lord god said it is not good for man to be alone i will make a helper suitable for him and the lord god made a woman from the rib that he had taken out of the man and he brought her unto the man and the man said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh for this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and be joined to his wife and they will become one flesh proverbs 31 talks about you mary a woman of notable character who can find she is worth far more than rubies her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value always remind zach of these words she brings him good not harm all the days of her life marriage has always been a joyous occasion in canaan of galilea it was gladdened by the presence and the blessing of the lord jesus himself because god intended marriage to bring the blessing of joy to our lives if you'll remember that jesus blessed water and turned it into wine and he knows how to take care of your lives and if he could take and bless 52 barrels of water and make it the best wine that was in the whole region he knows how to take care of every little detail and when you're talking to him you believe that he can meet your needs the scripture says that god is the author of love the bible teaches us that god is love and that love comes from god from the beginning to the end the bible is a love story there we read of god's love for his people of the love that he sent christ to the cross to redeem us love for the sinner the abiding love for the redeemed we read of the love of a man and a woman of jacob's love for of rachel mary pledged to joseph the shulamite and her beloved in the beginning when the lord god formed man from the dust of the ground he placed him in the garden of eden and adam was lonely so the lord made a companion a helper for him and he was no longer lonely he was busy from that time on the scriptures tells us husbands love your wives just as christ loved the church and gave himself for her to make her holy cleansing her by the washing of the water through the word to present her to himself as a radiant church without a stain or wrinkle or a blemish but holy and blameless in the same way husbands are to love their wives as their own bodies wives submit yourselves to your husbands as to the lord for the husband is the head of the wife as christ is the head of the church his body of which he is the savior now as the church submits to christ so also wives should submit themselves to their husbands and everything god leads us take advantage of that one god leads us to our life's companion we're taught by a prophet of the lord that we stepped out of eternity into a space of time and you found one another and you'll live life and you'll step back into eternity again what a wonderful thought what an absolute wonderful thought abraham prayed that god would find a wife for his son isaac and god remembered the prayer and abraham's servant found rebecca the servant bowed and worshiped and praising god then he brought her to his master son the scripture says that isaac loved her and was comforted the scripture says that love is patient love is kind it does not envy it does not boast it is not proud it is not rude is not self-seeking it is not easily angered it keeps no record of wrongs love does not delight in evil but rejoices with truth it always protects it always trusts and it always hopes and love always preserves the union that you're about to embody with these ideas is not to be entered into lightly or unadvisedly but reverently disgracefully soberly in the fear of god into such a union you're about to be joined our declaration of consent zach will you have this woman to be your wife to live together in a holy covenant of marriage will you love her and comfort her honor and keep her in sickness and in health forsaking all others be faithful to her so long as the both of you shall live if so answer i do got it will you have this man to be your husband to live together in the holy covenant of marriage will you love him comfort him honor him in sickness and in health forsaking all others being faithful to him as long as the both of you shall live if so answer i do who gives this woman to be married to this man go get her let us all bow our heads heavenly father we approach you today lord on this day that you have predestined before time began if we've watched these two come together as a couple father and now to enter into this union lord this is not just a typical wedding but this is a wedding that you have decided to bless and father it may look like a normal wedding to some but this is the greatest thing is that you are the unseen guest here today you have blessed them to come to this moment to fulfill a vision lord and as their love grows and in this day i pray that they would cherish the moments that that will come forth and the memories that that will take place here and i pray a special blessing upon it for zach and mary as they walk forward in this day may you come with them be with them and be their god and be their helper bless them today i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen are you ready for your vows isaac take you mary isaac take you to be my wife to be my wife to heaven to hold to heaven from this day forward from this day for better for worse for better for worse for richer for poor rich

till death as god is my witness god is my witness i give you my promise i give you my promise having this kind of love in your hearts you have chosen to exchange rings as a sign and a seal of the vow that you are making today though small in size these rings are very large in significance made of precious metals they remind us that love is not cheap it's not common indeed love may cost us dearly made in a circle their design tells us that love must never end or ever come to an end we must keep it continuous and as you wear these rings whether together or apart for a moment may these rings be a constant reminder of the glad promises that you are making today i give you this ring as a symbol of my bow and with all that i am and all that i have i honor you in the name of the lord jesus christ [Music] i give you this ring as a symbol of my vow with all that i am and all that i have i honor you in the name of the lord jesus christ in ecclesiastes chapter 4 and verse 9 the scripture says that two are better than one because they have a good return for their work if one falls down his friend can help him up but pity the man who falls and has no one to help him if two lie down together they will keep warm but how can one keep warm alone the one may be overpowered and two can defend themselves a cord of three strands is not quickly broken today zach mary have been woven together by god as one in marriage one man one woman and god by keeping him at the center of your marriage his love will continue to bind you together as throughout your marriage let's do the unity
