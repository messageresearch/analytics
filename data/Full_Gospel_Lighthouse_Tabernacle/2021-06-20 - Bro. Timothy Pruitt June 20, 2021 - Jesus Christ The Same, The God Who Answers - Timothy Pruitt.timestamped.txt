[50:07] the tempter's power
[50:10] is broken
[50:11] [Music]
[50:15] when jesus comes

[50:58] from home and friends
[51:03] the evil spirits drove
[51:08] him
[51:12] among the twos
[51:17] he dwelt in misery
[51:22] [Music]
[51:25] he cut himself
[51:30] while the demon power
[51:34] possessed him
[51:38] then jesus came
[51:43] and said the captive free
[51:48] amen aren't you thankful when jesus

[1:00:06] [Music]
[1:00:10] hallelujah happy father's day
[1:00:15] i wanted to greet you this morning and
[1:00:17] and uh
[1:00:18] just just tell you happy father's day
[1:00:20] this morning
[1:00:22] god's blessed us in so many ways and
[1:00:24] we're just so thankful father for
[1:00:26] our heavenly father amen we're all from
[1:00:30] the same family
[1:00:32] it doesn't matter nationality language
[1:00:35] whatever whatever place that god put us
[1:00:38] on the earth
[1:00:39] we're part of the same family and every
[1:00:43] one of us are different and unique
[1:00:45] and he built us just that way but isn't
[1:00:49] it amazing that he can come and speak in
[1:00:51] an audience of people
[1:00:53] and speak around the world and in five
[1:00:55] minutes come and soothe your soul
[1:00:58] no matter how difficult the complex of
[1:01:00] issues that you're fighting today
[1:01:02] amen i thought last night was just
[1:01:04] absolutely
[1:01:05] incredible amen i i just really enjoyed
[1:01:09] that
[1:01:10] brother david we we so thank you guys
[1:01:12] for coming
[1:01:13] and being with us and he said he's
[1:01:15] coming back labor day and
[1:01:17] amen we're holding him to that as well
[1:01:20] amen the pruitt and spencer family
[1:01:23] you're
[1:01:23] intertwined in a lot of different ways
[1:01:26] there's been a lot of miracles that have
[1:01:28] happened
[1:01:28] among us and we believe that even today
[1:01:33] i'm standing in a miracle
[1:01:36] because satan designed it that i would
[1:01:39] be gone
[1:01:40] and maybe be in a hole somewhere another
[1:01:42] but what he doesn't realize
[1:01:46] that should i go by the way of the grave
[1:01:48] i'm standing with jesus anyway
[1:01:50] so amen so we thank the lord for
[1:01:54] his grace and mercy to us and we thank
[1:01:56] the lord that god is touching sister
[1:01:58] karen
[1:01:59] and and is with her and drew
[1:02:02] and lord we're just so thankful that
[1:02:04] he's made friends with gabriel
[1:02:06] amen he's going to be a police officer
[1:02:09] one of these days and so
[1:02:11] amen we certainly love you with all of
[1:02:13] our hearts i wanted to greet you before
[1:02:15] brother timothy comes brother timothy is
[1:02:18] a special young man to me
[1:02:20] and i remember many years ago i told his
[1:02:23] daddy i said
[1:02:24] he's going to make a great preacher he
[1:02:25] said don't tell him
[1:02:28] whatever you do don't you tell him
[1:02:31] well he did anyway somebody must have
[1:02:35] told him from up above and so
[1:02:37] amen i i like the way that timothy
[1:02:39] operates he looks like that
[1:02:41] he looks like that he's not doing
[1:02:43] anything and in a moment he cuts the
[1:02:45] devil's head off and so
[1:02:47] amen i like his style i wish i could
[1:02:49] preach more
[1:02:50] like that one day when i grow up i'll be
[1:02:52] a better preacher when
[1:02:53] you get there here's what i want to say
[1:02:56] this morning we came this weekend
[1:02:58] for father's day but we're going to have
[1:03:00] a party
[1:03:01] yeah yes sir
[1:03:04] it's a party of killing devils
[1:03:08] and uh i i said this before i i don't
[1:03:11] want sympathy
[1:03:14] because we're in this war
[1:03:17] because satan brought his best against
[1:03:19] us brother randy
[1:03:21] he brought his best he picked out his
[1:03:23] best to come against us
[1:03:25] but he still don't have enough
[1:03:29] and we're standing here this morning
[1:03:30] brother emmanuel to remind
[1:03:32] him he don't have enough because my
[1:03:35] heavenly father that is watching over me
[1:03:40] he has provided everything that i have
[1:03:43] need of
[1:03:44] in this life's journey i will not
[1:03:47] retreat i will not bend i will not bow i
[1:03:50] will not turn back i will not give up
[1:03:54] i refuse to give up i'm never never
[1:03:56] never never going back
[1:04:01] so we've got nothing to hang our heads
[1:04:03] about today
[1:04:05] victory is on our side
[1:04:12] so let's just raise the white flag of
[1:04:14] victory today
[1:04:16] hallelujah may this be more than a
[1:04:19] father's day
[1:04:21] but may we worship our heavenly father
[1:04:24] and remind him he put something on the
[1:04:27] inside of us
[1:04:28] and deposited there a seed of eternal
[1:04:31] life

[1:19:57] but we will not be defeated
[1:20:04] cause we've got the power
[1:20:11] in the name of the lord
[1:20:19] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:20:23] lord
[1:20:25] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:20:30] oh my now won't you just lay hands on
[1:20:32] one another
[1:20:34] let's go to him in prayer right now as
[1:20:36] we would start this service
[1:20:41] father we come to a special moment
[1:20:46] a special time in end time but has been
[1:20:49] played out in eternity
[1:20:52] you know lord the very things that upon
[1:20:53] our hearts this morning
[1:20:55] very things that you've directed us in
[1:20:57] this path lord that we've walked on
[1:21:00] we know you're here today to touch and
[1:21:02] to meet needs
[1:21:04] lord i also realize i'm here
[1:21:06] commissioned
[1:21:07] commissioned to let the devil know
[1:21:11] this cancer to know your time is over
[1:21:15] father we're here to know let's just
[1:21:17] stand up on the promises of god
[1:21:20] lord we're here even in this moment some
[1:21:22] thousands of miles away from evening
[1:21:24] like tabernacle and as they start their
[1:21:26] service
[1:21:28] there's a little woman sitting there
[1:21:29] lord been in a lot of confusion and a
[1:21:33] lot of anxiety and fear
[1:21:35] the devil of torment has come upon her
[1:21:38] but we go beyond what we see and we go
[1:21:40] beyond what we think
[1:21:42] we step into a heavenly atmosphere and
[1:21:44] we call out the name of jesus
[1:21:47] and we speak against that spirit and we
[1:21:49] command it to go in jesus name
[1:21:52] lord is not a maybe it's not a hope so
[1:21:55] but it's your
[1:21:56] word today as thus saith the lord satan
[1:21:59] you take your hands off of god's
[1:22:00] property
[1:22:01] you're defeated here and you're defeated
[1:22:03] there
[1:22:04] you will not have your way you will not
[1:22:06] you will not bring these down into
[1:22:08] defeat but we will arise
[1:22:10] and we'll go out of here victorious
[1:22:13] because god god has given it to us
[1:22:15] and what our god has given you can't
[1:22:18] take away
[1:22:19] we praise you now for these things and
[1:22:21] we glorify your name
[1:22:23] and we worship you almighty god i
[1:22:25] believe there's those here today lord
[1:22:27] that's got darkness upon them
[1:22:29] there's darkness upon their lives and
[1:22:31] they've got questions and they don't
[1:22:32] know where to turn to
[1:22:34] but lord there's a man here that can
[1:22:35] turn on the light
[1:22:37] there's a man here that can just reveal
[1:22:39] their thoughts to them
[1:22:40] and and their anxieties and their fears
[1:22:42] and their worries
[1:22:43] and spirits who would try to haunt them
[1:22:46] in the night
[1:22:47] would just dissipate and disappear by
[1:22:49] the mighty name of jesus we commit this
[1:22:52] service to your hands lord we committed
[1:22:54] for your glory and for your honor in
[1:22:57] jesus name
[1:22:59] amen amen let's turn to hebrews 13 and
[1:23:02] verse 8.
[1:23:16] and also we'll turn to first kings 18
[1:23:18] and verse
[1:23:19] just like to say it's very just an honor
[1:23:22] to be with you today
[1:23:23] amen it's on father's day but i believe
[1:23:27] it's more that our our life is more than
[1:23:29] about just earthly fathers and we
[1:23:31] appreciate earthly fathers
[1:23:33] but i'm on here i'm here on business for
[1:23:36] the king
[1:23:37] amen the king of kings our father in
[1:23:40] heaven amen
[1:23:41] hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8 says
[1:23:44] jesus christ
[1:23:45] the same yesterday today and
[1:23:48] forever first corinth first kings 18 and
[1:23:51] verse 21
[1:23:52] and elijah came unto all the people and
[1:23:54] said how long
[1:23:55] halt you between two opinions if the
[1:23:58] lord be god
[1:23:59] follow him but if baal then follow him
[1:24:03] and the people answered him not a word
[1:24:06] then said elijah unto the people i even
[1:24:09] i only
[1:24:10] remain a prophet of the lord but baal's
[1:24:12] prophets are 450 men
[1:24:16] let them therefore give us two bullocks
[1:24:19] let them choose one bullock for themself
[1:24:21] and cut it in pieces
[1:24:23] and lay it on the wood and put no fire
[1:24:25] under and i will dress the other bullock
[1:24:28] and lay it on the wood
[1:24:29] and put no fire under it and call ye on
[1:24:32] the name of your gods
[1:24:34] but i will call on the name of the lord
[1:24:37] and the god that answers by
[1:24:39] fire let him be god and all the people
[1:24:43] answered and said it is well
[1:24:47] spoken down to verse 36 and it came to
[1:24:50] pass
[1:24:50] at the time of the offering of the
[1:24:52] evening sacrifice that elijah the
[1:24:54] prophet came near
[1:24:56] and said lord god of abraham isaac and
[1:24:58] of israel
[1:24:59] let it be known this day that thou art
[1:25:02] god in israel
[1:25:03] that i am thy servant that i have done
[1:25:05] all these things that thy word
[1:25:07] hear me o lord hear me that this people
[1:25:10] may know that thou art the lord god
[1:25:12] and that thou has turned their heart
[1:25:15] back again
[1:25:16] then the fire of the lord fell and
[1:25:18] consumed the burnt sacrifice
[1:25:20] and the wood and the stones and the dust
[1:25:23] and licked the water up in the trench
[1:25:25] that was in the trench
[1:25:26] when all the people saw it they fell on
[1:25:29] their faces and they said the lord
[1:25:32] he is the god the lord he is
[1:25:35] the god amen there's gods but there is
[1:25:39] the god
[1:25:40] there's lords but there is the lord
[1:25:44] amen god bless you today you can be
[1:25:52] seated
[1:25:58] amen i'd like to speak to you on jesus
[1:26:00] christ the same
[1:26:02] the god that answers amen he is a god
[1:26:06] that answers
[1:26:07] he knows exactly what battles we're in
[1:26:10] he knows exactly
[1:26:11] you know i'm very thankful to serve a
[1:26:13] god that he's not surprised
[1:26:15] about where we are today he's not
[1:26:18] sitting back
[1:26:18] shocked at the political atmospheres and
[1:26:22] the
[1:26:22] and the spirits around and all the
[1:26:24] things that are going on around he's not
[1:26:26] shocked by any of that
[1:26:28] he knows exactly where we're at he knows
[1:26:30] exactly where you're at today
[1:26:32] he knows exactly your struggles he knows
[1:26:34] all the things that are going on
[1:26:36] but not only does he know about it he
[1:26:38] cares about it
[1:26:39] i'm very thankful to serve a god who
[1:26:41] cares amen because
[1:26:42] you know satan would try to let you try
[1:26:44] to tell you in your mind that nobody
[1:26:46] cares nobody understands what i'm going
[1:26:48] through
[1:26:49] nobody god don't care god don't know
[1:26:51] anything like that but that's nothing
[1:26:52] but a lie of the devil
[1:26:54] but god is coming this hour to show us
[1:26:56] over and over
[1:26:58] that he cares and he's a god that
[1:27:00] answers you know
[1:27:01] you know brother brown would say it like
[1:27:03] this he said when man what man calls
[1:27:05] great god calls foolish
[1:27:07] and what man calls foolish god calls
[1:27:09] great
[1:27:10] he said what we got to do is get back to
[1:27:13] the program of god
[1:27:14] and find out what god wants to do and he
[1:27:17] said the only thing
[1:27:18] i know to do is prayer prayer is the key
[1:27:22] that's the answer prayer changes things
[1:27:25] prayer is the most powerful weapon that
[1:27:28] was ever put in the control of human
[1:27:30] beings
[1:27:31] there's no atomic bomb there's no
[1:27:33] hydrogen bomb we could say
[1:27:34] nuclear bomb as powerful as prayer
[1:27:37] prayer
[1:27:38] will even change the mind of god amen
[1:27:41] we've got scripture for that we know the
[1:27:43] king that
[1:27:43] the prophet of god was told to go say
[1:27:45] get your things in order you're going to
[1:27:47] die and he would turn his
[1:27:48] head to the wall and he would cry out to
[1:27:50] god and he would ask and it was thus
[1:27:52] saith the lord
[1:27:54] that he had come and delivered to him
[1:27:55] and he would turn his head to the wall
[1:27:57] and he would cry out to god
[1:27:58] and ask for 15 more years and as the
[1:28:01] prophet was walking out god would speak
[1:28:03] to him and go back and tell him
[1:28:05] look you can have those 15 years amen
[1:28:08] because prayer
[1:28:09] can even change the mind of god god
[1:28:12] would say in matthew 7 and verse
[1:28:14] 7 he would say jesus would say ask and
[1:28:16] it shall be given to you
[1:28:18] seek and you shall find knock and it
[1:28:21] shall be opened to you now he wouldn't
[1:28:23] put this in the scripture
[1:28:24] unless it was true he wouldn't he
[1:28:27] wouldn't say to ask
[1:28:28] unless it would be given to you
[1:28:30] otherwise it would be unjust he wouldn't
[1:28:32] say
[1:28:32] find or let or or to seek unless you
[1:28:35] would find it he wouldn't say
[1:28:37] knock and it would stay closed but it
[1:28:39] would have to open
[1:28:40] because it's declared in his word to be
[1:28:42] so amen
[1:28:43] for everyone that asketh receiveth and
[1:28:46] he that seeketh findeth
[1:28:48] and to him that knocketh it shall be
[1:28:50] open or what man is there a view of whom
[1:28:53] his son asked of bread
[1:28:55] will he give him a stone or if he would
[1:28:57] ask a fish
[1:28:58] would he give him a serpent will there
[1:28:59] be any father today that would do that
[1:29:01] to your child
[1:29:02] no you wouldn't do that you as an
[1:29:03] earthly father you got your your best
[1:29:05] the best interest of your child
[1:29:07] and heart and if they ask for something
[1:29:09] many times you'll try to do whatever you
[1:29:11] got to do
[1:29:12] amen to provide it to give it to them he
[1:29:14] said he said so if you
[1:29:16] then be an evil how much to know how to
[1:29:19] give good gifts to your children
[1:29:21] how much more shall your father which is
[1:29:24] in heaven give good
[1:29:26] things to them that ask of him so i'm
[1:29:29] here to ask of him today
[1:29:31] i'm here to knock upon the door of
[1:29:33] heaven and say father
[1:29:34] i have a need i i'm here seeking
[1:29:36] healings and deliverances
[1:29:38] and salvations and i know if i ask
[1:29:41] i'm going to receive if i seek i'm going
[1:29:45] to find if i knock
[1:29:47] it's going to be open to me amen it's
[1:29:49] not my word it's not my wishes it's his
[1:29:51] word and his
[1:29:52] declaration that he put in the scripture
[1:29:55] that what he
[1:29:56] whatever i ask in his name it shall be
[1:29:59] given unto me
[1:30:01] hallelujah you say well i don't know
[1:30:03] about healing he's healing the will of
[1:30:04] god well
[1:30:05] he wouldn't put it in his word if it
[1:30:07] wasn't his will his
[1:30:08] word is his will so he put it in his
[1:30:11] word by his stripes you are healed
[1:30:13] amen therefore it is the will of god to
[1:30:16] heal you
[1:30:18] hallelujah amen you know as i was
[1:30:21] preparing this week
[1:30:22] uh uh for for wednesday night service
[1:30:25] at home and i actually ministered this
[1:30:27] at home and and and and just knowing the
[1:30:30] things that were going on and
[1:30:31] what was facing at home and i want to
[1:30:33] give you just a little background as we
[1:30:34] go into this for a moment
[1:30:36] i'll try not to be too long but i can't
[1:30:38] promise anything it's in his hands
[1:30:40] amen so uh but you know i i was thinking
[1:30:44] and we're here we're here we're moving
[1:30:45] into and to seem like a stormy time and
[1:30:48] i was wondering
[1:30:49] you know what what god was doing you
[1:30:51] always kind of
[1:30:52] thinking you know sometimes it takes you
[1:30:53] a moment to kind of get your bearings
[1:30:55] you know when the ship gets to rocking
[1:30:57] and rolling it takes a moment to
[1:30:59] steady yourself and so you know as david
[1:31:02] would say you know
[1:31:03] and when he went to zig lag and he found
[1:31:05] it burned and he found it uh
[1:31:07] and destroyed and all the women and his
[1:31:09] children everything was taking place
[1:31:11] it took a little bit for him to get
[1:31:12] himself together it took him a moment
[1:31:15] he would even his men it took them a
[1:31:16] moment to get themselves together
[1:31:18] because
[1:31:18] they was even thinking of stoning their
[1:31:20] leader and they was thinking of killing
[1:31:22] him
[1:31:22] amen because of all the destruction and
[1:31:24] things that had taken place but the
[1:31:26] scripture says
[1:31:27] david encouraged himself in the lord
[1:31:30] he went back to the word of god and he
[1:31:32] went back to the past victories and
[1:31:34] and the things that god had done for him
[1:31:36] and he began to call upon the name of
[1:31:38] god and was as we're speaking on in the
[1:31:40] god it answers
[1:31:41] god answered and he said pursue
[1:31:45] and you shall recover all
[1:31:48] amen i remember a sermon some time ago
[1:31:51] take it back
[1:31:52] amen we haven't forgot that we're
[1:31:54] pursuing the enemy
[1:31:55] and we're going to take it back he's the
[1:31:58] god that answers amen we've cried unto
[1:32:00] the lord
[1:32:01] for healing and deliverance and we're
[1:32:03] going after it in the name of jesus
[1:32:05] and we're going to take back every every
[1:32:07] part of our health
[1:32:08] god's not a it doesn't do something
[1:32:10] halfway and when he does it he does it
[1:32:12] perfectly
[1:32:14] hallelujah amen so when we're looking at
[1:32:16] these things we're going to
[1:32:17] call upon the name of the lord and we're
[1:32:19] going to encourage ourselves
[1:32:21] in what god has already said because
[1:32:23] what he said
[1:32:24] is what he does amen and so
[1:32:28] i was linked thinking of these things
[1:32:30] and i was reminded
[1:32:32] you know of actually of of of a accident
[1:32:35] that had happened in our family
[1:32:36] it was a moment that it was a very a
[1:32:39] very tried seemed like tragic moment
[1:32:42] that the the devil had come and struck
[1:32:43] my little daughter down
[1:32:45] adriana her name's adriana and she had
[1:32:48] been at a
[1:32:48] a park and she i probably told this but
[1:32:50] i just feel to tell it again
[1:32:52] and and she was at a park and and and
[1:32:54] they was playing frisbee golf and
[1:32:56] i was actually at home on this it was
[1:32:57] saturday morning beautiful days
[1:32:59] beautiful spring day and or maybe it's
[1:33:01] even the middle of the winter i don't
[1:33:02] remember but it just happened to be a
[1:33:04] beautiful day
[1:33:05] and just the weather was beautiful and
[1:33:07] so you know in louisiana we can have hot
[1:33:09] days but in louisiana
[1:33:10] we have 70 degrees weather right in the
[1:33:12] middle of winter
[1:33:15] hallelujah sunshine for weeks and i
[1:33:18] enjoy that i don't like cold weather
[1:33:20] amen so anyway uh you know it was
[1:33:22] happened to be that kind of day so a lot
[1:33:24] of the young people went out and they
[1:33:25] began to
[1:33:26] play that game and so i'm home studying
[1:33:28] supposed to be preaching sunday night
[1:33:30] on a god we can rely on and i was i it
[1:33:32] was just one of those days that couldn't
[1:33:34] get my thoughts
[1:33:34] in their line couldn't couldn't couldn't
[1:33:36] think you know get scriptures and all
[1:33:38] those things had a few things together
[1:33:40] but i could tell it wasn't
[1:33:41] really hitting the mark and so i looked
[1:33:43] at sister ruth i said let's go get some
[1:33:45] hamburger meat and let's get some
[1:33:46] fixings for hamburgers let's go out to
[1:33:48] that park and let's get ready to make
[1:33:50] them kids some hamburgers they're about
[1:33:51] done so
[1:33:52] let's do that so we gathered the rest of
[1:33:54] the children and this about eight years
[1:33:55] ago
[1:33:56] we gathered the rest of the children and
[1:33:57] we went to the park and
[1:34:00] andrew or one of them brought these
[1:34:01] little rip sticks and and they're like a
[1:34:04] skateboard but they're they're just on
[1:34:06] two wheels and i i
[1:34:07] i wouldn't dare get on one i like to
[1:34:11] stay all in one piece
[1:34:13] hey man but they they they've been
[1:34:14] riding them around but you know in
[1:34:15] louisiana we got flat ground it's not
[1:34:17] that big a deal and
[1:34:18] but over there at this park there's
[1:34:20] actually some pretty good hills there
[1:34:21] and you know
[1:34:22] and adriana was planning on going to a
[1:34:24] camp meeting with us up in uh cloverdale
[1:34:26] and
[1:34:27] and there she was dreaming of going
[1:34:28] snowboarding so somebody had told her he
[1:34:30] said you know
[1:34:31] this is similar to a snowboard and you
[1:34:33] just get on that hill and you ride it
[1:34:34] down and
[1:34:35] and and this you'll learn how to even
[1:34:37] you'll be able to snowboard and so but
[1:34:39] the difference is
[1:34:40] it's not snow in louisiana it's asphalt
[1:34:44] and so she gets you know i'm flipping
[1:34:45] hamburgers not really paying no
[1:34:47] attention and she gets up on this thing
[1:34:48] and
[1:34:49] her brother and another boy gets on two
[1:34:51] others and here they come down the hill
[1:34:53] and
[1:34:53] down at the bottom of this hill there's
[1:34:54] a curve and it's going around to the
[1:34:56] left
[1:34:57] and and they're flying and i'm just i've
[1:34:58] got my i'm just looking i'm like god
[1:35:00] have mercy what are y'all doing
[1:35:02] and i was like no don't do that and and
[1:35:05] next and then i sing they made the curve
[1:35:07] and they said
[1:35:08] you make the curve it went back up the
[1:35:09] hill and you slowed down and stopped
[1:35:11] well i no sooner got that out of my
[1:35:14] mouth here comes adriana now
[1:35:15] she was determined she's going to be
[1:35:17] tougher than the boys so she goes up a
[1:35:19] little higher
[1:35:20] on the hill and she takes off down this
[1:35:22] hill and i watch her and out of the
[1:35:24] corner of my eye catch her and here she
[1:35:25] comes down this hill
[1:35:26] and i'm thinking she's not going to make
[1:35:28] the curve she's not going to make it and
[1:35:29] sure enough she didn't she went down
[1:35:31] into a parking lot
[1:35:32] and there wasn't any cars there wasn't
[1:35:34] anything going on there that day is
[1:35:36] but just us believers was there and she
[1:35:39] went down probably another hundred yards
[1:35:40] down through that just straight on
[1:35:41] downhill catching speed going towards
[1:35:43] the lake
[1:35:44] but before you got to the lake there was
[1:35:46] there was sand and there was trees and
[1:35:48] there was concrete and there was poles
[1:35:50] and there was all kinds of stuff
[1:35:52] she hit the end of that asphalt and she
[1:35:53] flipped end over end over in we measured
[1:35:55] it about 30 feet
[1:35:57] she flew through the air and she would
[1:35:58] come to rest her head up against the
[1:36:00] steel pole
[1:36:02] and there was some young people that was
[1:36:03] down there walking on the beach down
[1:36:05] there at the lake and they began to
[1:36:06] scream for us to come and so we drove
[1:36:08] down to where she was and
[1:36:10] i knelt down beside her and i raided it
[1:36:12] raised her over on her back i rolled her
[1:36:14] over on her back and just trying to be
[1:36:15] as easy because i didn't know you know
[1:36:17] she'd broke something or what
[1:36:18] and i'm just beginning to talk to the
[1:36:20] lord and i talking to adrian as well
[1:36:22] saying adriana talk to
[1:36:24] daddy speak to me and she opened her
[1:36:26] eyes and her eyes just all rolling
[1:36:28] around in her head and
[1:36:30] and she was just moaning this terrible
[1:36:32] moan and i just
[1:36:33] bowed my head i said father we're out
[1:36:36] here
[1:36:36] enjoying some time in nature we're not
[1:36:39] out here
[1:36:41] just previously doing things where we're
[1:36:44] enjoying time with other believers and
[1:36:46] in nature
[1:36:47] but i believe you're the same god that
[1:36:49] when the prophet of god was fishing at a
[1:36:51] place
[1:36:52] and his friend got bit by a snake
[1:36:53] remember the story
[1:36:55] and he knelt down and he prayed and the
[1:36:57] very effect of that snake's bite
[1:37:00] was gone in just a minute and i'm
[1:37:02] believing you're that same god that the
[1:37:03] very effect
[1:37:05] of this wreck will be gone in just a
[1:37:07] moment
[1:37:08] and and then i looked and she would open
[1:37:10] her eyes and i watched as those crossed
[1:37:12] eyes would become straight
[1:37:14] and her first words were to me daddy i
[1:37:16] can't see you
[1:37:18] and i said lord i just watched these
[1:37:20] eyes come straight
[1:37:21] now give her back her sight her next
[1:37:23] words were daddy i see you now
[1:37:27] god was moving very very powerfully and
[1:37:29] very fast
[1:37:30] and i watched and just and we called for
[1:37:32] the ambulance to come
[1:37:34] and and it took about 20 minutes for
[1:37:36] them to get out to where we was and
[1:37:38] and and they they began to take her load
[1:37:40] her up and as they began to load her up
[1:37:42] she had been laying there for that time
[1:37:44] just in pain and suffering and why am i
[1:37:47] here and
[1:37:48] what's going on how did i get here all
[1:37:50] all her memory was gone of that day she
[1:37:52] did not remember being there playing any
[1:37:54] kind of
[1:37:54] uh frisbee she didn't remember none of
[1:37:56] the other things that had happened
[1:37:58] but as they began to load her up i
[1:38:00] watched her mind begin to come back
[1:38:02] she said oh we was here we're at the
[1:38:03] lake state park and
[1:38:05] we played frisbee golf and and we're
[1:38:07] just fixing it was going to eat
[1:38:08] hamburgers yes i remember now
[1:38:10] and god began to move very quickly
[1:38:14] sister ruth would get in the ambulance
[1:38:16] with her and go to the hospital with
[1:38:17] other
[1:38:18] brothers that would be was there would
[1:38:19] take my kids with them and
[1:38:21] i would follow them one of the brothers
[1:38:23] had called my dad and
[1:38:24] and told him what is going on and he
[1:38:26] laid the phone down he said lord
[1:38:28] let there not be one broke bone
[1:38:32] amen and so as we follow that ambulance
[1:38:34] there and i begin to pray and i begin to
[1:38:36] thank god for all that had happened
[1:38:38] and all that had taken place and as i
[1:38:41] had one hand on the wheel and one hand
[1:38:42] in the air be honest with you i don't
[1:38:44] know how i made it
[1:38:45] there to homer to meet with my father
[1:38:46] but i made it somehow but anyway i was
[1:38:48] praising god but i hurt my heart
[1:38:50] and in that moment i heard my voice
[1:38:52] speak and it said what you've seen in
[1:38:54] the natural
[1:38:55] you'll also see in the supernatural
[1:38:58] well right there on sunday night i gave
[1:39:00] the testimony of what had taken place
[1:39:03] that god had come on the scene that god
[1:39:05] in a moment had changed the whole scene
[1:39:07] that a little girl that had been dirty
[1:39:09] and dark darkened by the
[1:39:11] spots of and scarred up and all that
[1:39:13] lost her mind
[1:39:14] but god moved in such a way that we get
[1:39:17] to the hospital
[1:39:18] they x-ray after x-ray cat scan after
[1:39:20] cat scan
[1:39:21] every kind of thing that they could do
[1:39:23] to try to determine if there was broke
[1:39:25] the doctor come in and said sir he said
[1:39:27] we're going to keep her overnight but he
[1:39:28] said i want to tell you something
[1:39:30] we can't even find a sign of a
[1:39:32] concussion
[1:39:35] it's all gone
[1:39:42] hallelujah he's the same god this
[1:39:44] morning
[1:39:46] hallelujah if he can make it to where
[1:39:47] they can't find a sign of a concussion
[1:39:50] he'll make it to where they can't find a
[1:39:51] sign of cancer
[1:39:55] he's that kind of god amen and it just
[1:39:58] takes a moment in his presence
[1:40:00] to where it's all white you remember
[1:40:02] that moment when you was in his presence
[1:40:04] and every sign of cigarettes every sign
[1:40:06] of every
[1:40:07] kind of sign of sin was washed away from
[1:40:10] your life
[1:40:10] and the devil with every kind of x-ray
[1:40:12] and every kind of mr
[1:40:14] hell's mri could look at you and not
[1:40:16] find
[1:40:17] one side of it he's that kind of guard
[1:40:21] this morning
[1:40:29] i got up that night a sunday night and i
[1:40:33] told the testimony
[1:40:34] adriana was there in that service i went
[1:40:36] between services and picked her up at
[1:40:38] the hospital
[1:40:39] within just a few days every scar was
[1:40:41] gone
[1:40:45] it was a it was a miraculous working of
[1:40:47] the holy ghost
[1:40:48] amen of gods of power to come on the
[1:40:51] scene we witnessed it
[1:40:52] and i said now i've heard my voice i
[1:40:54] said it wasn't me
[1:40:56] i had no control of it but i heard my
[1:40:57] voice speak said what you've seen in the
[1:40:59] natural
[1:41:00] you'll also see in the supernatural i
[1:41:03] said i don't know what's about to happen
[1:41:05] but god's about to move on somebody
[1:41:08] that very next wednesday night brother
[1:41:10] philip roncalli that's at our church
[1:41:12] today
[1:41:12] amen had been away from god been out
[1:41:15] seven or eight years
[1:41:16] and thought the devil had told him the
[1:41:18] message wasn't for him
[1:41:19] he couldn't live it he couldn't do
[1:41:21] nothing with it he knew it was a truth
[1:41:23] but it wasn't for him
[1:41:25] told him all kind of lies and here he
[1:41:26] found himself in a scarred situation
[1:41:29] spiritual amnesia amen didn't know who
[1:41:32] he was anymore and lost his uh
[1:41:34] his ability to even even think that he
[1:41:37] could ever deserve
[1:41:38] anything from god but that night as his
[1:41:40] family had prayed for him and prayed for
[1:41:42] him and prayed for him
[1:41:44] amen later they would find piles of
[1:41:45] handkerchiefs under his bed
[1:41:47] where those kids would come to minister
[1:41:49] and say i want a handkerchief
[1:41:50] i want a prayer cloth for my daddy
[1:41:52] because i want my daddy back
[1:41:54] yeah amen and here he came that
[1:41:57] wednesday night as they were getting
[1:41:58] ready for church
[1:41:59] the spirit of god began to move upon him
[1:42:02] and he said hey
[1:42:03] if y'all don't mind if you'll wait a
[1:42:04] minute i'll get ready and i'll go with
[1:42:06] you
[1:42:08] he came to church but he didn't come in
[1:42:10] a time of expectation or an attitude
[1:42:12] of expectation he came in a bad move you
[1:42:15] know we me and him was raised up
[1:42:16] together and
[1:42:17] and so we had a lot of fights and we had
[1:42:19] a lot of tussles as young men
[1:42:20] growing up and he said of all things
[1:42:22] brother timothy's preaching
[1:42:28] but i began to speak on identity crisis
[1:42:31] from from what had happened and god gave
[1:42:33] me several services on that thought
[1:42:35] and and i began to speak on identity
[1:42:37] crisis and i would come down to the last
[1:42:39] part about the french soldier who had
[1:42:41] who had been
[1:42:42] out there in the war and been struck by
[1:42:44] this this bomb that went off close to
[1:42:46] him
[1:42:47] and it had happened to amnesia and it
[1:42:49] was taking them back on a train
[1:42:51] and they stopped for a little break and
[1:42:53] he gets out and brother brown talks
[1:42:54] about it said he gets out
[1:42:55] he begins to look around at things and
[1:42:57] he began to look her over and he said
[1:42:59] all of a sudden his
[1:43:01] his eyes caught a water tower
[1:43:04] and he said it was something very
[1:43:06] familiar about that and and the soldier
[1:43:08] began to watch him that was garden and
[1:43:09] he began to walk towards his water tower
[1:43:12] then he went down a little trail all the
[1:43:14] way down to a little house and there was
[1:43:15] a father that was sitting there
[1:43:17] waiting on him and said son i've been
[1:43:19] waiting for you to come
[1:43:20] and you're back now
[1:43:24] well at that moment that spirit that was
[1:43:27] on brother philip broke because
[1:43:29] you know in his mind he's saying well i
[1:43:31] didn't heard all this stuff i've been
[1:43:32] gone seven years and ain't got nothing
[1:43:34] new to preach and
[1:43:35] all all of a sudden i said about the
[1:43:36] water tower and he said brother branham
[1:43:38] didn't say that
[1:43:42] and at that moment that spirit broke you
[1:43:44] know why because he had just bought a
[1:43:46] house
[1:43:47] and he was going out on that front porch
[1:43:49] and in the front of his house was his
[1:43:51] water tower
[1:43:53] and he had been fixing his coffee and
[1:43:55] going on his front porch and looking at
[1:43:56] that water tower
[1:43:57] and thinking about his life and he
[1:43:59] needed to get right with god
[1:44:02] what i've seen in the natural i have now
[1:44:04] seen in the supernatural
[1:44:06] but i'm here to see it again this
[1:44:08] morning
[1:44:09] [Applause]
[1:44:11] hallelujah i'm here to see it again this
[1:44:13] morning amen
[1:44:14] amen my daughter adriana now amen god
[1:44:17] has brought her back from afar
[1:44:19] from a place that she was almost broken
[1:44:22] almost
[1:44:22] you know irreparable seem like but god
[1:44:25] came on the scene
[1:44:28] hallelujah i understand we got another
[1:44:30] adriana here this morning
[1:44:31] he's the same god for you this morning
[1:44:35] amen you may feel broken you may feel
[1:44:38] unreparable
[1:44:39] you may feel like there's no no hope for
[1:44:41] you and all hope is gone
[1:44:43] but what i've seen in the natural i'll
[1:44:45] also see in the supernatural
[1:44:47] he's a god who answers by fire he's a
[1:44:50] god who answers
[1:44:51] amen mamas have prayed daddies have
[1:44:53] prayed but your prayers have not went
[1:44:56] unheard

[1:45:00] is here to answer
[1:45:01] your prayer

[1:45:13] began to send out wednesday morning
[1:45:16] i began to send i was already getting
[1:45:18] ready for the night but god had actually
[1:45:20] gave me this sermon on the friday before
[1:45:23] it doesn't always happen like that i
[1:45:24] just felt the urge set down
[1:45:26] and god in just a few moments laid it
[1:45:28] all out on friday on saturday we'd take
[1:45:31] our my mother to the
[1:45:32] er not knowing what is going on with her
[1:45:35] and it seemingly had gotten worse and
[1:45:37] worse and worse and worse

[1:45:40] to send out texts to ministers to pray
[1:45:43] to believe to join us that god is going
[1:45:46] to move

[1:45:49] to go to go to the restroom and
[1:45:51] and and i began to walk through my room
[1:45:54] and as i'm walking i'm crying and
[1:45:55] praying
[1:45:56] asking the lord to move on the scene and
[1:45:58] i heard my voice speak

[1:51:42] god met moses there's been a cry for a
[1:51:46] deliverer
[1:51:47] 400 years they cried 400 years of
[1:51:50] promises seemed to fall down to the
[1:51:52] ground
[1:51:53] but the time came for the promise to be
[1:51:55] fulfilled
[1:51:57] amen and there wasn't enough devils in
[1:51:59] hell that was going to keep it from
[1:52:00] coming to pass
[1:52:01] when the time comes for the promise to
[1:52:03] be fulfilled the devil don't have enough
[1:52:07] because if he had enough he would bring
[1:52:09] enough but he don't have enough
[1:52:11] and so if he had enough of it because he
[1:52:13] knew that this was god's children he had
[1:52:15] heard
[1:52:16] god's decree over their life he had
[1:52:17] heard all the things and so
[1:52:19] if he would have had enough to keep them
[1:52:21] in slavery he would have brought enough
[1:52:23] but he didn't have enough
[1:52:26] amen amen if god if the devil could keep
[1:52:29] you in
[1:52:30] sickness he would do it but he don't
[1:52:32] have enough
[1:52:33] if he had enough he would bring enough
[1:52:35] but he don't have enough
[1:52:38] because the prophet of god would say it
[1:52:39] like this he said when all hell turns
[1:52:41] loose
[1:52:42] all heaven turns loose with it so when
[1:52:45] you see
[1:52:46] hell turning loose turn your eyes from
[1:52:48] hell and look to heaven because
[1:52:50] it's also turning loose it's also coming
[1:52:53] to pass
[1:52:54] it's also falling upon a heart to
[1:52:57] believe that
[1:52:58] all things are possible
[1:52:59] [Applause]
[1:53:00] [Music]
[1:53:02] [Applause]
[1:53:04] but god met moses in an unexpected age
[1:53:06] the prophet will say like this
[1:53:08] had an unexpected place in an unexpected
[1:53:11] way
[1:53:12] god didn't meet moses the way he usually
[1:53:14] met man meets men
[1:53:15] he met him in an unusual way the way he
[1:53:18] chose to meet moses
[1:53:21] i know people thinks well god only does
[1:53:22] it one way but they put them in a box
[1:53:24] and
[1:53:24] that's their box that ain't god's box
[1:53:28] right so so they try to put him in the
[1:53:30] only
[1:53:31] you know the baptist have got him where
[1:53:32] he only answers this way and this one
[1:53:34] got him the only answer this way and
[1:53:35] this one got him the only answer this
[1:53:36] way
[1:53:37] and even the messages got him where he
[1:53:38] only answers this way in a tape
[1:53:44] you know i was i was just out of place
[1:53:47] there by the nathan bryant
[1:53:49] and we was back again we spoke was there
[1:53:52] two years ago on memorial day
[1:53:54] and we was back again two years later
[1:53:57] supposed to been there the year before
[1:53:58] but you know coveted
[1:54:00] so anyway was there two years later me
[1:54:02] and brother aaron oglesby and brother
[1:54:04] joe adams
[1:54:05] had been called to minister there for a
[1:54:06] meeting
[1:54:08] and in the first service there was this
[1:54:10] little girl got up
[1:54:11] 16 year old girl i think 16 17 something
[1:54:14] like that
[1:54:15] got up she got she said i got a song to
[1:54:18] sing as a memorial
[1:54:20] she said two years ago she said i was a
[1:54:22] 14 year old girl
[1:54:24] she said i would their family had come
[1:54:26] from the tabernacle
[1:54:28] and said i i was in that in a place in a
[1:54:30] very dark place
[1:54:32] said that i'd been led into by some
[1:54:34] friends from church
[1:54:36] into pornography and and other things
[1:54:38] even homosexual things he didn't say all
[1:54:40] that but that's what had happened
[1:54:42] he said well you shouldn't bring that
[1:54:44] shame it ain't no shame no more because
[1:54:45] it's all gone
[1:54:49] amen i he don't accuse her neither do i
[1:54:51] accuse her
[1:54:53] to me it's an awesome thing because it
[1:54:56] gives somebody else the faith when she
[1:54:57] holds up that giant
[1:54:59] it gives somebody else to faith i can do
[1:55:01] it too
[1:55:03] she said i'm going to get up and i'm
[1:55:04] going to sing this song as a memorial
[1:55:06] and she said because two years ago i was
[1:55:09] in a dark place and said i was just
[1:55:10] about to take my life
[1:55:12] he said but i came to a meeting and god
[1:55:14] began to move on my heart and i found
[1:55:16] myself on a saturday night in a prayer
[1:55:18] line
[1:55:18] and brother aaron was praying different
[1:55:20] brothers around me so but i told brother
[1:55:22] aaron what was going on and all the
[1:55:24] things that were happening in my life
[1:55:25] and he looked me directly in the eyes he
[1:55:27] said i can't help you
[1:55:30] she said i almost fainted he said but i
[1:55:33] represent one who can
[1:55:36] [Applause]
[1:55:38] and she said i met that one who can she
[1:55:41] said my life ain't been the same for two
[1:55:43] years now
[1:55:44] god came on the scene and changed my
[1:55:47] whole life
[1:55:48] changed everything about me and i'm
[1:55:50] standing here as a memorial
[1:55:52] of a saving grace
[1:55:55] her father would later talk to me the
[1:55:57] next day he said brother timothy
[1:55:59] god did it that way for a reason he said
[1:56:01] because i was raised
[1:56:02] that it only came through a tape that it
[1:56:04] could only come through a certain way
[1:56:06] and it can only come through a tape
[1:56:08] he said i believe god still speaks
[1:56:09] through tapes but i realized that night
[1:56:11] god's got a fivefold ministry and god
[1:56:14] can come through that man
[1:56:15] to speak to my daughter and i'm a
[1:56:17] witness her life
[1:56:19] is not the same
[1:56:22] hallelujah so it'll come sometimes in an
[1:56:24] unexpected place
[1:56:26] in an unexpected time in an unexpected
[1:56:28] way
[1:56:29] but god's going to answer god's going to
[1:56:33] meet the need
[1:56:34] god's going to touch the heart amen he
[1:56:36] met moses not by an expected way
[1:56:40] all of a sudden one day moses without
[1:56:41] tending some sheep and he looks and he
[1:56:43] sees a bush that's on fire but it's not
[1:56:45] burning
[1:56:47] well that's kind of unexpected
[1:56:50] normally when the bush is on fire it's
[1:56:52] burning to the ground
[1:56:54] but this was unexpected so he said well
[1:56:56] i'm going to turn aside and i'm going to
[1:56:58] see this
[1:56:59] thing and so he walks up to it and a
[1:57:02] voice speaks out of that bush
[1:57:04] well that's real unexpected
[1:57:07] said moses take off your shoes because
[1:57:10] you're now on holy ground
[1:57:12] and the voice begins to speak to him and
[1:57:15] to touch his heart
[1:57:16] and to challenge him for the hour that
[1:57:18] was at hand
[1:57:21] but god answered it would so challenge
[1:57:24] him and so stir him
[1:57:26] to where he would take a rod a donkey
[1:57:28] and a wife and a child
[1:57:29] and he would go down to egypt and they
[1:57:31] said where you going moses i'm going
[1:57:33] down to take over
[1:57:35] i'm going down to destroy satan's
[1:57:37] kingdom i'm going down to destroy the
[1:57:40] tolls
[1:57:40] that's been on the lives of my brothers
[1:57:42] and sisters they've been slaves too long
[1:57:45] [Applause]
[1:57:47] oh hallelujah amen he's the same god
[1:57:50] that met me
[1:57:52] and i've come here with my slingshot of
[1:57:54] faith some of you been slaves too long
[1:57:57] you've been slaves to your anxiety and
[1:57:59] your fear and your depression
[1:58:00] and spirits of every kind but in the
[1:58:03] name of jesus today you're gonna walk
[1:58:05] out of here free from those things
[1:58:07] those things that once hold you and
[1:58:09] what's held you all their life
[1:58:11] and you've been tormented day after day
[1:58:13] god has come in an unexpected way
[1:58:15] in an unexpected time to bring you
[1:58:18] deliverance
[1:58:28] sometimes it may come as this is as a
[1:58:30] disguise
[1:58:32] per the scripture would say we entertain
[1:58:34] angels unaware
[1:58:35] it may come another way around about a
[1:58:37] way but no matter which way it comes
[1:58:40] it comes we've asked
[1:58:43] we shall receive god said so that's why
[1:58:46] that's all that matters what it and then
[1:58:48] when he speaks it's settled forever
[1:58:51] you hear me it's settled forever
[1:58:55] just like those two ladies that was
[1:58:56] there in a prayer line remember the
[1:58:58] story

[2:03:10] he said there's another realm that's
[2:03:11] beginning to try to speak to us
[2:03:14] he said you have to be in tune to
[2:03:16] receive what is
[2:03:17] what he's saying amen to preach the
[2:03:20] sermon on being in tune with the
[2:03:21] supernatural
[2:03:22] you know it's like you know we don't
[2:03:23] have it no more so much but numbers i
[2:03:25] know a lot of y'all remember
[2:03:26] them old dials and you're in your radio
[2:03:29] not talking about tvs this
[2:03:30] tonight this morning amen in the radio
[2:03:33] and you would have to turn it and
[2:03:36] today
[2:03:39] what was you doing you was tuning it in
[2:03:41] there was a receipt there was a sending
[2:03:43] station and a receiving station and they
[2:03:45] had to be in tune with one another
[2:03:47] to receive the signal and brother
[2:03:49] branham said this is how you get your
[2:03:50] heart in tomb
[2:03:52] he said you just begin to think god is
[2:03:54] god
[2:03:58] [Music]
[2:03:59] so right now let's cast down every
[2:04:01] imagination
[2:04:02] let's cast down every thought i'm
[2:04:04] casting down every thought about my mom
[2:04:06] i'm casting down every thought
[2:04:07] that's been going through my mind and i
[2:04:09] got one thought right now let's get it
[2:04:11] in our mind god
[2:04:12] is god
[2:04:15] when you realize he's god if he's still
[2:04:18] god he's still on the throne
[2:04:19] if he's still god he still answers by
[2:04:21] fire if he's still god

[2:04:42] amen he's still god and so if god is god
[2:04:47] and he won't change
[2:04:55] that's all that matters as long as god
[2:04:58] comes and answers
[2:05:00] and as long as we recognize it to be god
[2:05:05] because sometimes it comes unexpected
[2:05:07] and he speaks and you thought well
[2:05:09] that's just something
[2:05:10] but it was god
[2:05:13] got to be in tune with it say god this
[2:05:16] morning tune my dial
[2:05:19] tune it to the supernatural when i walk
[2:05:22] in this
[2:05:22] doors right here i got one thing on my
[2:05:25] mind
[2:05:26] god is god when i walk out of this door
[2:05:29] i got one thing in my mind
[2:05:30] god is god and he don't change
[2:05:34] he said even jacob one time ready made
[2:05:36] him an unexpected place
[2:05:37] in an unexpected way at an unexpected
[2:05:40] time
[2:05:41] he met god in a wrestling match
[2:05:46] but it was god regardless of whether
[2:05:49] he's in a burning bush or a wrestling
[2:05:51] match
[2:05:51] it was god the main thing god came and
[2:05:54] changed jacob
[2:05:55] from a deceiver into a prince
[2:05:59] jacob got a hold of something that he
[2:06:01] could look at and hold with his hands
[2:06:03] and sing that was god
[2:06:04] and he wasn't going to tell it turn it
[2:06:06] loose he said you lay your hands on hold
[2:06:08] something that's real
[2:06:09] you catch a vision from god and see his
[2:06:11] presence hold on to it until god sends
[2:06:14] back the answer
[2:06:15] and when god sends it back a revival
[2:06:17] will start in your heart
[2:06:18] it will not just be in your heart it'll
[2:06:20] be in your family's heart
[2:06:22] it'll burn from one to another amen to
[2:06:25] see the power of a living god
[2:06:27] something's real no matter what form he
[2:06:29] comes in
[2:06:30] but god has a way of sending things to
[2:06:33] us
[2:06:34] answering our prayers
[2:06:36] [Applause]
[2:06:38] he said i believe we just need to open
[2:06:40] our eyes and be ready to receive it
[2:06:42] god is going to send it to us in his way
[2:06:45] of doing it
[2:06:48] an unexpected time and an unexpected
[2:06:51] place
[2:06:52] in an unexpected way when he realized it
[2:06:54] was god he held on to it
[2:06:58] the children of israel the three hebrew
[2:07:00] children they found god in an unexpected
[2:07:02] place in an unexpected time
[2:07:05] in an unexpected way it was a dark time
[2:07:08] for them
[2:07:09] but you know before you can ever have
[2:07:11] victory you've got to have trials
[2:07:13] if there was no war there'll be no
[2:07:15] victory
[2:07:17] amen you can't have victory without war
[2:07:20] you can't have miracles without having
[2:07:22] something
[2:07:22] have need of a miracle you know when we
[2:07:25] begin to
[2:07:26] sing the songs we shall see miracles
[2:07:28] maybe we didn't realize we got to have
[2:07:30] to go through something to see a miracle
[2:07:33] but that don't change it we're going to
[2:07:35] see a miracle
[2:07:38] hallelujah amen the three hebrew
[2:07:40] children down have been brought to a
[2:07:42] spot
[2:07:43] the king had made a declaration that if
[2:07:45] anybody did not bow down to this image
[2:07:47] they would be thrown in the fiery
[2:07:48] furnace
[2:07:49] but they purpose in their heart i we
[2:07:51] will not bow
[2:07:52] we will not turn around we're going to
[2:07:54] go on with jesus we're going to stand
[2:07:56] for him
[2:07:57] whether he is a fiery furnace or whether
[2:07:59] it's not fiery furnace o king
[2:08:01] live forever you are a king but you're
[2:08:03] not the king
[2:08:06] but we serve the living god and though
[2:08:08] if god will slay us
[2:08:10] yeah we're going to trust him that was
[2:08:12] shadrach meshach and abednego's promise
[2:08:14] and they held on to it and they wouldn't
[2:08:16] turn it loose
[2:08:17] in the worst time in the worst moments
[2:08:20] they
[2:08:21] held on
[2:08:25] brother brown would say it again he said
[2:08:26] the greatest weapon that's ever put in
[2:08:28] the hands of mankind is prayer
[2:08:30] it changes everything
[2:08:36] hallelujah you know i got to think i was
[2:08:38] i think i was talking brother andrew and
[2:08:40] i was making the decision to come on i
[2:08:43] said you know
[2:08:44] it was some years ago back in the 40s
[2:08:48] this group of men thought it was a good
[2:08:49] idea to float some boats across the
[2:08:51] pacific ocean
[2:08:52] and set off some bombs on pearl harbor
[2:08:56] and they did they brought destruction on
[2:08:59] all sides for a moment
[2:09:01] and they thought wow we got a victory
[2:09:03] and they're flying them planes and
[2:09:04] landing them back on that
[2:09:05] aircraft carrier and they're rejoicing
[2:09:07] and they're drinking their their victory
[2:09:08] drinks and every hoo-ha
[2:09:10] and carrying on and the general that
[2:09:12] army stood up and he says you know
[2:09:14] he said this has been a great day he
[2:09:16] said but i'm afraid we've awakened us
[2:09:18] sleeping
[2:09:19] giant
[2:09:24] all of a sudden the war machines of the
[2:09:26] us and all the power of the us began to
[2:09:28] turn
[2:09:29] and it began to turn out boats and
[2:09:31] armies and and
[2:09:32] and planes of all kinds and and
[2:09:34] scientists begin to become anointed
[2:09:36] under a power
[2:09:37] amen they begin to invent things and
[2:09:39] begin to move until where they could
[2:09:41] invent an atomic weapon i wonder if
[2:09:44] those men would have dropped them bombs
[2:09:46] if they realized the last result was an
[2:09:48] atomic bomb not one but two dropped on
[2:09:50] them
[2:09:52] if they would have made that decision
[2:09:54] that this is how the end's gonna come
[2:09:58] and i want to give the devil fair
[2:10:00] warning you come and drop the bombs in
[2:10:02] the wrong spot
[2:10:03] you may have come to this island you may
[2:10:05] have come to that country you may come
[2:10:07] to that place
[2:10:08] but you have dropped bombs in the wrong
[2:10:10] spot you have awakened a sleeping tide
[2:10:14] amen it's not by my powers not by my my
[2:10:17] works it's not by who i
[2:10:18] am but by his spirit saith the lord
[2:10:22] amen we are now anointed with the power
[2:10:24] of the holy ghost

[2:10:42] and say devil i'm coming at you
[2:10:44] in the name of the lord and you let it
[2:10:46] go in faith

[2:10:50] answer
[2:10:51] he'll send it right to the head of that
[2:10:53] child and he will fall
[2:10:55] at your feet i say god anoint us this
[2:10:59] evening

[2:13:18] you're not sitting back and just letting
[2:13:20] the devil run over you
[2:13:21] he's attacked one of your leaders but
[2:13:23] that ain't the time to sit back and say
[2:13:25] oh my what are we going to do
[2:13:26] no it's a time to move forward it's a
[2:13:30] time to advance on the enemy
[2:13:32] the enemy may be screaming he may be
[2:13:34] hollering he may be rioting
[2:13:35] he may be see that's what the devil is
[2:13:37] going to do just like they're doing now
[2:13:39] on the streets they're riding when they
[2:13:40] try to
[2:13:41] when somebody tries to stand up for
[2:13:43] something right or something
[2:13:44] in our law enforcement they're riding
[2:13:46] against them they're
[2:13:47] riding against the very power to protect
[2:13:50] and to serve
[2:13:52] just like the devil is riding it's the
[2:13:54] very power that's coming to the
[2:13:56] body of jesus christ amen the holy ghost
[2:13:59] to try to tell you
[2:14:00] you don't have to live that way you
[2:14:01] don't have to go on no longer that way
[2:14:03] but there's a power greater than the one
[2:14:05] that's been against you
[2:14:08] but don't you think the devil's going to
[2:14:09] right and he's going to fuss
[2:14:11] and he's going to scream what's he

[2:16:31] this joy that i got the devil didn't
[2:16:34] give it to me
[2:16:37] aren't you thankful about a joy that's
[2:16:38] not a temporary joy
[2:16:41] it's not temporary in the sense that
[2:16:42] it's determined by how joyful you are
[2:16:44] about how good a day you're having no
[2:16:45] that ain't determining nothing
[2:16:47] i'm joyful because i see an old rugged
[2:16:49] cross i'm
[2:16:50] joyful because i see a risen savior
[2:16:54] amen amen he comes in the darkest of
[2:16:57] moments
[2:16:58] in the darkest of times in the darkest
[2:17:01] of
[2:17:01] issues and spirits on every kind trying
[2:17:04] to drive you back and push you back off
[2:17:06] the promises of god
[2:17:08] trying to make you step back and say
[2:17:11] maybe this ain't the day maybe it's for
[2:17:14] somebody else
[2:17:16] maybe it's for so you know for that
[2:17:19] brother yes
[2:17:19] that was over there and just keeps
[2:17:21] backing you know this ain't the time to
[2:17:23] back
[2:17:23] up it's a time to say devil
[2:17:26] that's my promise
[2:17:30] and when you stand on it the devil's
[2:17:32] going to scream
[2:17:33] and he's going to holler and he's going
[2:17:35] to make a bunch of noise
[2:17:37] but that's all he's got
[2:17:40] amen is noise
[2:17:44] but that's not all you got you say oh
[2:17:47] brother timothy we got a lot of noise no
[2:17:48] that ain't just noise
[2:17:51] no there's a creative power behind that
[2:17:54] voice
[2:17:55] that'll go beyond this little church
[2:17:57] building right here and go into heavenly
[2:17:59] realms
[2:18:00] and begin to speak against that enemy
[2:18:02] and that enemy will hear your voice
[2:18:04] and say i gotta move off
[2:18:10] because how you know he's only got noise
[2:18:12] because i can read about him as a white
[2:18:13] horse rider
[2:18:14] as he begin to ride in the first church
[2:18:16] age he was a white horse rider and he
[2:18:18] was a writer with a bow
[2:18:20] and nowhere else you know what you can
[2:18:22] do with a bow but no
[2:18:24] errors you can do a lot of clanking
[2:18:28] that's about all the good it's going to
[2:18:29] do it might put some lashes on somebody
[2:18:32] but it ain't going to kill nobody it
[2:18:34] might he might
[2:18:35] you know put a few bruises in a few
[2:18:36] bumps but that's all it's going to be
[2:18:38] able to do
[2:18:39] because he don't have the power over
[2:18:41] your life to take it from you
[2:18:43] god showed us at the beginning to a
[2:18:45] prophet's message
[2:18:46] this enemy that we serve or that we were
[2:18:49] fighting
[2:18:50] is not a a armed enemy

[2:19:16] that don't bluff amen if they was
[2:19:20] resting on their own human abilities
[2:19:22] and what they could do see or think it
[2:19:24] would they would be somebody would back
[2:19:26] up but it's not me that he's coming
[2:19:28] against he's coming
[2:19:29] against the one that's on the inside of
[2:19:31] me
[2:19:32] and that one on the inside of me has
[2:19:34] omnipotence
[2:19:35] it has eternal life and it'll make every
[2:19:38] devil flee
[2:19:39] it'll make every devil flee and try and
[2:19:42] cry and scream
