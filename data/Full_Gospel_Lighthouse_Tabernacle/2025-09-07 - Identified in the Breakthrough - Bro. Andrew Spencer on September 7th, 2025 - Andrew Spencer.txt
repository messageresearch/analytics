You give as God's blessed you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; How many appreciated that word last night? &gt;&gt; Yeah. This song I'm about to This morning I heard brother Phil Ron Calli sing it. He never left me. I thought about it as brother Matt preached last night where I went through a time in my life where I'd gave my heart to the Lord and I fell back to the cares of the world. In about a year and a half, you know, the Lord never quit talking to me dealing with my heart. I'm so thankful that he never gave up on me. &gt;&gt; You know, he knew something I didn't. He knew I was his. &gt;&gt; Now I know that I that he's mine. &gt;&gt; Brother Matt spoke about a love last night. You know, someone that ain't got Christ in their life, they know the difference of people that do and they don't. &gt;&gt; The devil told me when I come back, people's going to laugh. They going to say, "Here he is again. He couldn't stand the first time. He's back. He's going to try it again." You know, that's what the enemy does. But when I came through them doors back there, I wasn't here 30 seconds. And I knew I'd been lied to &gt;&gt; cuz brother brother Bill, brother John Kelly, brother Ralph met me with a love that I knew was real. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I tell you, you say, "Well, what kind of difference did it make? I'm here. &gt;&gt; I knew I done got in the presence of something real." And I knew that God would give me that kind of love. And I think that's the kind of love we want. What Brother Matt spoke about last night. I just pray I believe that's each one of our desires that we'd be so full of that love that we can take that to our job just like he said &gt;&gt; for those that maybe got something against us for no reason. You know, we just want to live that life that's salty because a person knows when they get in that real presence &gt;&gt; of God. And I'm just thankful for him and what he's done for me in my life. Amen. &gt;&gt; So many directions. You know the roads all look the same. He gave me instruction. [Music] I disregarded in shame. Oh, and sudden destruction. You know, it soon came my way. And I have to say I only had me to blame. Oh, but he never left me. Though I turned my back on him, I was living in a world of sin. I was trying to run away. He never left me when I chose to walk away. Even when I couldn't pray, you know, he never left me. You know, I chose the wrong road because it looked good to me. I walked blindly on the word. You know, I just couldn't see. Oh, that I was lost and I was dying. Oh, but now I'm trying. You know I reached out to Jesus. Oh, you know he reached out to me. I found that he never left me. Though I turned my back on him, I was living in a world of sin. I was trying to run away. [Music] He never left me. when I chose to to walk away even when I couldn't pray. You know, he never left me. You see, I chose the wrong room. because it looked good to me. I walked blindly onward. You know, I just could not see that I was lost and I was dying. Oh, but now I'm trying. You know, I reached out to Jesus. You know, he reached out to me and he never left me. Though I turned my back on him, I was living in a world of sin. I was trying to run away again. Oh, but he never left me when I chose to walk away. [Music] And even when I couldn't pray, you know, he never left me. [Music] [Applause] [Music] There are moments nothing can heaven and earth meet face to face. When a broken heart begins to change, the word takes on flesh and a soul finds faith. Where the unfulfilled are satisfied &gt;&gt; and the unknown scars are relying. There's an open door to a brand new life in the presence of the Savior. I just want to be in the room. Want to be in a room when you move. And I'm not leaving. Not leaving till you do. I just want to be in the room. Want to be in the room when you move. And I'm not leaving. Not leaving till you do.

And I'm not leaving. Not leaving till you do. [Applause] [Music] There's a deep and endless hunger living in my soul. [Music] God has promised in his word that he will make us whole. Well, it is time for it to happen. the huge portion of heaven. [Music] It will make and bring to pass that tremendous victory in the love divine. For I'm tired of tramping on this mountain.

Make it easy, Lord, cuz I'm so in love with you. Amen. It truly is easy to worship the Lord, isn't it? Amen. Amen. God bless you today. If you have your Bibles, we'd like to look in the book of Mark, chapter 2. Man, just want to make a mention here. Um, for those that are on the internet and and those that are that consider this their their home church and are in in a driving distance and they they can't make it um at every single service, but we just want to make this and kind of give a u just a little bit of time for preparation for those that would like to be here. on October the 4th, we are planning to have communion and footwashing here. And so we just want that to be upon the people's minds this weekend. Uh uh we're just giving brother Ron a break. And uh so u he we're very happy we're very happy to have our brother Ron and and to uh allow us to take this Sunday morning here. Amen. You know, every every once in a while it takes you just you just got to have a good break every once in a while. And man, I I brother Brandon will talk about that sometimes. You just got to have a a time of refilling and and that's that's truly what we had last night and last weekend and where God come and filled our cup to the brim and Amen. Isn't it good to be a Christian? &gt;&gt; Amen. I would like to uh just speak to you today something I I had I had me another sermon picked out here today and uh it was it was it was one of them Andrew sermons, you know, it was it was one that I would have enjoyed preaching. Brother Matt Mccclard and Sister Dorothy had bought me some new shoes for my birthday and and I I was just intending on breaking them things in and a good one them a good old dancing sermons this morning. But this morning, the Lord woke me up and just um kept speaking a word to me um about 5 5:30 this morning. And so I'd like to just speak to you on a thought on identified in the breakthrough. Identified in the breakthrough. Mark chapter 2 and verse one. And again he'd entered into Capernaum after some days and it was noised that he was in the house. It's a powerful thing when he's in the house &gt;&gt; and then everybody else recognizes it. &gt;&gt; It's one thing for him to be here, &gt;&gt; but it's another thing for us to recognize his presence. &gt;&gt; And straightway many were gathered together in so much that there was no room to receive them. No, not so much as about the door. It would be kind of like our Labor Days in a sense. &gt;&gt; Everybody's heard that Jesus is going to be in the house. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Everybody's packed in. They're sitting on the countertops. They're sitting on the couch. They're sitting on the floor. Everybody's leaning up against the window. And they're sitting on the outside and they're peeking through the windows and they're listening. Now, if I was those people, I'd been as close as I could have got. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; I'd have put if I if I'd have had to stick my head through the window or just lean over top of somebody just to hear him say the right word. &gt;&gt; I'd been right there. &gt;&gt; And there was no room to receive them. No, not so much as about the door. And he preached the word unto them. And they came unto him bringing one sick of Pauly which was born of four. And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was. And when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of Pauly lay. Let's just speak to the Lord just for a minute. Heavenly Father, we come before you, Lord, this morning. Lord, we're your children, Father, and count it in honor, Lord Jesus, to know that you have birthed us into thy kingdom, Lord Jesus. To realize your true greatness is here amongst us, Lord Jesus. To realize that you have come into this house, Lord, and others are speaking to others, whispering through the ears, he was to pass by this way. &gt;&gt; And I believe that the master has called this morning and he's calling for us. And father, I pray, Lord Jesus, that you would allow your servant, Lord. I've humbled myself. I've tried to get myself out of the way, Lord, completely, Lord, yielding my vessel to you. Now, Father, you see your children, Lord Jesus. You see exactly what they are dealing with in their spiritual walk. And we ask, Lord Jesus, that thou wouldest come. And Lord, that you would just sit down at the table, Lord, and you begin to teach us your word, Father. And may while you begin to teach and preach the word, Father, may may hearts be ministered to, Lord, I pray that no matter what we've got to do in this service, Lord, may we get to you, Father. whatever we've got to tear apart, whatever we've got to get to, Lord Jesus, to just to press through the mark, Lord God, to come closer to you, Lord, I pray that you would take control of every spirit just now, Father. And that you would use this sermon, Lord, this service today to be edifying to your body, Father. That it would glorify the God of heaven, Lord. Lord, we study, we prepare, Lord, and then you come and you begin to show forth your your mind, Lord. And we just want to completely envelope ourselves in your mindset today that you could come in such a special way, Father, that we would recognize that you was in the room. Lord, we love you so much and give you this service today in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be seated today in the presence of the Lord. As we said, we'd like to just title this little message on identified in the breakthrough. And I I didn't even I didn't even I didn't even have enough time to really prepare for this thought, but it's just just what the Lord was speaking to me this morning. And and I I I just trust that the Lord will get behind this this morning. And we find right here in this scripture that faith will find a way no matter what. Faith will find the way. And that's the kind of faith that this this believing group of people had. These four people it said they came unto him bringing one sick of the policy and they had that kind of a desperate faith. You see true faith will never stop at barriers. Sometimes you have to get to a place or a position in your life that you have to literally tear off the roof and remove whatever begins to stand in the way of you getting to Christ. And we realize that that we that we are identified as Christians that we are identified as believers. But we also carry about in our bodies we carry identities. There are things in our DNA. There are things in our in our human walk that we carry. Every one of us have our own identity. And nobody else can make that up except for us. And we realize that they are also on the inside of us that God placed the gene seed of God on the on the inside of us. And everything everything about what he placed on the inside of us carries about his demeanor and his identity as well. Each and every one of us it we we write things. Our signature is different. Our our fingerprints are different. We even have a digital digital stamps about us even all over the internet now that that prove who you are. And there is a major thing that we live in in this world is the case of identity theft often times where somebody wants to come in and steal somebody's identity so that they get the benefits that that person is getting. They get their social security. They get their they get some of their tax credits. They get different things. what it is. It's a bogus that is trying to act like the reality. And in reality, all they are is a counterfeit. And I think it's powerful when you begin to study the message of the hour and you begin to look at it from the eyes of an eagle anointing and through a seer, through a prophet that we recognize that there this this message has words of power. And truly, you begin to look at it, the message has the ability to find out who we truly are. Even though we have layers of of our of our DNA that are there, we we have things that we have built up, complexes and stigmas, we have things that we have built up in our own mind. We have things that we have went through. We have things that we are are are intending to go through. But we find that the message of the hour finds us exactly who we truly are. And it speaks to us on on our level exactly where we need him to speak to us. And I think it's so amazing that God could take a hillbilly Kentucky and he could speak to us in deep levels. He could speak to us on the surface and he could go beyond the surface. And I think it's amazing when the eagle anointing begins to pierce right into the depths of our soul and it begins to bring out our true identity. We can look at it and see that God has pre-planned our coming here to this world so that we recognize that we're not just caring about our father's DNA or our mother's DNA, but we are caring about a heavenly DNA that will literally take us into a position that only a believer can go through. &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, true identity, brother Brandham would teach us that true identification is shown to us by God's characteristics. And it's not just by fundamentals because Balam had the fundamentals, but Moses had the fire. Balam had the doctrine, but Moses had the demonstration and the power. And we recognize this about God's presence is that God's presence brings about a supernatural confirmation. Whenever Jesus would show up or or when God would show up, the pillar of fire was there. The the you begin to see the you begin to see the water. You begin to see the smitten rock. You begin to see the brass serpent. You begin to see healings that would transpire. You see, because God was going to show about his identity and his characteristics would always align with the promise of the age that he was coming to. And how they recognized that God was with them was that there was a shout of the king in the midst of the camp there. And it was showing that God that his atonement and his authority was with them when they had the shout of the king. And I think it's powerful when you begin to identify what this message is. It is the shout of the king. And I believe that is literally what has have given us the ability to break through denominational barriers and break through our ideologies. And it really proves our identity when we fully accept. Hallelujah. When we fully accept that this message is a part of ourselves. &gt;&gt; You see, because God's characteristics are always supernatural. It's not like Balam's ways of natural things. You see, when you begin to notice in Balam and Moses, Moses, the difference wasn't in the teaching because they was teaching the same things. The difference was that the characteristics of God was identifying himself right amongst Moses. What was it? God was identifying himself. Hallelujah. That he was going to rewrite another second book of Acts right here in this generation. So therefore, God identify himself in a bride body. &gt;&gt; Brother Madam would say and show us the father and it sufficeth us. He said, "I believe that God's going to give us a breakthrough tonight. I believe it is on the audience." Now, I don't know if I don't know if you recognize this, but I guarantee you that there are people that showed up in this room to worship the Lord this morning. I guarantee you that there are people that showed up today just to raise their hands or they showed up here just to give an amen to the almighty God. I guarantee you that there is something that is going to transpire. Now, this is where I'm at as a as a pastor, as a leader here, that if God would wake me up in the early mornings, if he would speak to me that there is an identification beyond the breakthrough, that we are identified in the breakthrough, then I could say and put my words with a prophet's words, and I would say that there's a breakthrough on the audience. What are you saying, brother Andrew? I am saying this that there is deliverance in this room tonight. There is a powerful powerful breakthrough upon the people today. And I believe this that you're going to have to tear off the roof to get to him. &gt;&gt; I guarantee you that you didn't just waste your gas money &gt;&gt; so that I could see your pretty new dress. I guarantee you that you did not show up here so that I could see your new your new hairdo. I guarantee you that you didn't just show up in this room just so that you could be seen on the camera so somebody over in South Africa could see the way that you dress. I guarantee you you the reason why you showed up is because you wanted to get to Jesus. And there's going to have to come a time in your life when you've got to deny self. &gt;&gt; That you went to church just out of tradition. No, there was something a deep call to the deep that was bringing you that was bringing you. This is more than a tradition. It's your identity. It is attached with going to church. [Applause] But if you're going to get to him, you're going to have to silence the crowd on the outside &gt;&gt; because there ain't no room in here. There's not enough room for your need in here. There's not enough space for your room in here because wherever Jesus is, the room is always packed out. The room is always full when Jesus is there. But be if you're going to get to him, you're going to have to break past the barrier of the crowd. The doorway was blocked. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine in the days of Jesus even put yourself in the 1960s and are trying to get to the prophet. They're literally squeezing their way in. &gt;&gt; They're literally squeezing their way into the doors just trying to get a seat in the I wonder if we would show up to church like that. I wonder if we would come to church like I wonder if we would worship like that. I wonder if we would truly get into a position that we've got to get to him no matter if I got to press through the crowd or I've got to silence the voices in the crowd. And I believe that too many times today that people are hindered by people's opinions. They're they're hindered by criticism. They're hindered by peer pressure. They are hindered by the air condition. They are hindered by the music's too loud. They are hindered by he's not my favorite preacher. They're hindered by they're they're they're just they're just they're worshiping way too loud. &gt;&gt; It's like a it's like an athlete and he's been told by the coaches and he's been told by everybody on his team that he won't be a starter. He's told him he's never going to make it, that he'll never be successful. But there's something on the inside of him. &gt;&gt; People's been telling him he's going to ride the bench and he never be up there. But if you're ever going to get to a position of successfulness, you are going to have to fight past your own fears. You're going to have to fight past other people's opinions. You're going to have to fight past what everybody else is saying. I'm like Paul said in Galatians 1:10, whether do I serve men or do I serve God? Am I going to please you or am I going to please God? Am I going to show up to church to please God or am I going to show up to church to please almighty God? I've got to come with that kind of tenacity, that kind of perseverance that I've got to get to Jesus. No matter if you don't want me to get to Jesus, if you don't want to worship, if you don't want to praise, if you don't want a breakthrough, I've got to come to that in my position. it because when you get desperate, it brings about a determination that you're going to get to him. And when you get that kind of desperate, determination takes over and determination births a miracle. &gt;&gt; Brother Man said it in the serpent seed. He said that's the reason that God is opening these things through us. That God is bringing his sons into manifestation. He's going beyond the human limitations of any human knowledge way into the spiritual revelations and he's bringing it down. You are either going to be identified with the outsiders or you're going to be identified with those that are willing to get into the house. &gt;&gt; Well, they got there first. If you get here first, you get in the church. Now, let me go on. The Bible was never written to show us only what God was and what God did in the past. But the Bible was written to show us who God is and what he wants to do in every single generation and everywhere on earth because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. So the same way that he acted 2,000 years ago when they was trying to get into the house, he's got to act the same way today. Now remember said in Israel your life worthy of the gospel. He said that word is the truth. Right? And the spirit of God will recognize his own writing. He is identified by his writing. It speaks of him and you are identified by believing it. It gives you your credentials of identification. There are five steps of receiving a gift. One of them there's got to be a reason to give it. There's got to be a reason to receive it. There's got to there's got to be somebody that's going to give the gift. And then there's somebody's got to make the purchase of the gift. And then the very last one is the person that's got to accept the gift. &gt;&gt; You have got to come to a position where you accept &gt;&gt; and believe that you are identified with this word. Therefore, Paul said, "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might." Now, remember, this is your identification. It is your credentials when you believe the word. Put on the whole armor of God that you might be able to stand against the ws of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you might be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand. Can you identify yourself there? First John 4 and4 says, "You are of God, little children, and have overcome them because greater is he that is he than he that is in you than he that is in the world." Can you identify yourself right there? 2 Corinthians 3:5. Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think of anything of ourselves, but our sufficiency sir, &gt;&gt; my abilities, my breakthrough is of God. &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 12:9. And he said unto me, my grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory &gt;&gt; in my infirmities that the power of Christ might rest upon me. &gt;&gt; I'd say that man of Pauly never thought of it like that. But today is going to be a little bit different. He had himself some they. I wonder if you have a they in your life. There's a lot of people that have a they say you'll never make it. &gt;&gt; They say you won't last. They say you can't live the message. They say you have went too far. They say that God had don't give the Holy Ghost no more. There's a whole lot of days out there. But I'm thankful to be identified with this kind of they they cared enough for me. They cared enough for me to get me into the room. They thought that he was powerful enough to get me into the room. They they they What kind of people are in your corner? &gt;&gt; What kind of people are you listening to? Let me say if your friends are not putting you in the room where Jesus is, then drop your friends. Get rid of them. But identify yourself with this kind of a thing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Isaiah 40 and 29. Can you identify with the word? He giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might. He increases strength. Even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall. Even when you think that you can make it, young men, even when you think that you can go on your own tenacity, when you think you can go in your own strength and you can live out this message on your own, God says he can't do it. &gt;&gt; But they, oh, hallelujah. But they, I'm identified as this kind of they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. Hallelujah. They shall mount up with wings as eagles and they shall run. &gt;&gt; I'm identified as they shall walk and not faint. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 54:16. Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, that bringeth forth an instrument for his work, and I have created the waster to destroy. No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper, and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and the righteousness is of me, saith the Lord. Revelations 12 and 10. And I heard a loud voice saying, "In heaven, now is come salvation, strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ. For the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night." Right there is that day. They said you wouldn't make it. They said you wouldn't last. They said you couldn't live the message. They said it's them demons of hell that are putting that there. But you are not identified. &gt;&gt; You are identified in a breakthrough. &gt;&gt; And they and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony. And they love not their lives under the death. Hallelujah. A man sat by a hospital room 38 years and he blamed it on they. &gt;&gt; I don't have no friends that have put me down in the water. Let me say if Jesus is your friend, forget they &gt;&gt; forget them. But when Jesus shows up, there's a miracle that is getting ready to take place. You see, this man had laid there many a times. He had went through it. But this time, this morning, this moment, this chance, you see, you've got to be like Samgard in moments like this. That there are times in your life where you get beat up and the Philistines and the demons of hell come in and they robbed you year after year, day after day. Another Labor Day went by and you got robbed and you didn't get your blessing. But one day, Shamgar had his moment. One day, Shamgar was identified with a breakthrough. I'm not going back. I'm not letting them take my message. I'm not letting them take my joy. I'm not letting them take my peace. I'm not letting them take my family. I'm not letting them take my wealth. I'm not letting them take my spirit. I'm not letting them take my victory. I'm not letting them take my liberty. I'm not letting them take my dance. I'm not letting them take my shout. I Shanggar was identified with his breakthrough. There's two sides of Shangar. It depends what story you read. &gt;&gt; So read the rest of your story. Don't stop in the middle of it. [Applause] Brother would teach us in the greatest battle ever fought. He would lay in there that there we begin to watch when Lucifer de deceived onethird of the angels of heaven. You see, if you would stop right there in the story, you would think that the enemy had overcome almighty God. But God was going to use this to prove his attributes. And it looked like that those angelic battles that they were victorious there in heaven. And brother Brandham said that angelic battles came down from heaven and became human battles. He said sin did not originate here on earth. But where sin originated was right there in heaven. And we realize that there these spirits, these demonic powers, they lost their position, but they still have power. And these spirits are here with one purpose and that is to keep you from your breakthrough. It is to keep you. It is to keep you in the mindset, what if Jesus can't reach you? What if he's traveled on too far? What if you've went too far on God? Maybe you send away your day of grace. Maybe you looked at the wrong thing one too many times. One too many times. But I found out about my Lord Jesus. He's a God of first chances. He's a God of second chances. He's a God of third chances. Let me say this. None of us would be in this room if he wasn't the God of first and second and third and fourth chances. &gt;&gt; Brother Manam said, "I watched Adam and Eve as we're walking out of the Garden of Eden. I can hear him say it in the message of grace." He said, "There they were. She had all of her scientific knowledge, but there the fall came. There they were walking out on their own. No way back to Almighty God." Then I could hear the prophet say, "And then grace come breaking through." Oh, amazing grace. How sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. What are you saying, Brother Andrew? I'm saying that young kids have got to come to a position where they tear the roof off. I'm saying that our young people have got to tear the roof off. I'm saying that you've got to push past what you think of yourself and what the devil thinks of you and what Christianity thinks of you. &gt;&gt; You're going have to tear the roof off of it. &gt;&gt; You say, "But I backslid, Brother Brandham." He said, "That don't make a bit of difference." He knows just exactly what you backslid over. He knows just exactly where you're at. You say, "Well, brother Random, I went off without him, too. I had an opportunity one time to speak. I had an opportunity one time to be a Christian. I had an opportunity. The preacher made the call and I went and I tried it once and I failed and I did this and I did that." No matter what you've done, &gt;&gt; God has still got his eye on you. &gt;&gt; Those disciples went off without him one night and the darkest of hour. Then when that devil got them away from there, away from his presence. You see, that's what the devil is doing. He is looking for an entrance. When you leave his presence, that's where the disciples got in trouble. When Jesus went up on the mountain to pray, they should have went with him. &gt;&gt; But just because you went on without him doesn't mean he ain't seeing you. Now, I'm a Bible reader. &gt;&gt; And I've read this story many of times. This story does not is not one of the highlight stories for me that I remember Peter and the disciples for. Because that's not how I identify them. I identify them just like Jesus identified them on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; How easy it is that we identify oursel by our failures and by our faults and by what other people say. &gt;&gt; But I am not identified by my faults nor my failures nor what other people say. I am identified by my breakthrough. Notice, you see, when his presence is with us, it shows that God's approval is on his life or on our lives. So, you could say, "I want his presence in me. His presence is going to bless me. I'm not leaving here until he blesses me like Jacob did." He's not identified as a sher. He's not identified as a liar. He's not identified as a man that could pull tricks. But he was identified as a man that pressed through that David is all and he wrestled it out and it was about the rising of the son that when the angel was wrestling with Jacob that his change came. &gt;&gt; That is where you identify Jacob at. &gt;&gt; But too many times you look on yourself and you see Jacob and you don't see Israel. Why is it? Because this old sticky nature that you got a hold of, this old flesh you got a hold of, it will hinder you all the days of your life, it will afflict you. It'll talk you into pleasing yourself more than pleasing God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But I want you to know this. Even though his booger is sticky and he likes to hang on to sticky things, there is given a power to the church of the living God to be able to override that sticky nature. &gt;&gt; I I'll just say it like brother Joe Green says it. I drink as much as I want to. I smoke as I want as much as I want to. I go out and I corouse as much as I want to. The difference between me and a lot of people is God took my one away. Come on, somebody. You can see the way I dance. You can see the way that I enjoy the Lord. I did that when I was out in sin, too. &gt;&gt; I went to the clubs. I went to Stanton. I danced all night long. You know why? Cuz I wanted to. &gt;&gt; But ever since a day in Canada, I never went in a club. I never went out in the streets. And I figured that if I could do that out there in the streets of Stanton, then I could surely do it in the house of God. The difference is I'm identified in my breakthrough. I'm not identified in my past. [Applause] Now when Jesus looks on this man, &gt;&gt; he looks on him and he says, "Thy sins are forgiven thee." Now the prophet taught us what sin is. A lot of people look at sin as the things they do, the things they look at, the things they say. Those are attributes of sin. But the prophet told us what sin is. It's unbelief. ran him in a message persevering. He said he's dealing with a patient. He said, "Now you're ill. You've been to a doctor and he really would advise an operation. The operation is on the colon." That's true, isn't it? Here's another thing. You are desperately in need of a spiritual. You haven't been feeling right. You kind of feel a little washed away and little you want to come back. Well, you're back now. &gt;&gt; I didn't time that out, but that's pretty quick. Now, I can tell you by the grace of God, that by the blood of Jesus Christ that you're back, but a prophet had the ability to look into a person's life and say, "You've been looking, you've been searching, you've been wanting, and you've been wanting to get back for a long time." And he looks on the individual and says, "You're back now." &gt;&gt; Now, who you going to listen to? You going to listen to they or you going to listen to an eagle anointing. You want it to come back. Well, you're back now that quick. You remember that old boy that was come off that little train ride, Sister Gabrielle? He was coming out there and he stood out there and he's looking at that he's looking at that water tower and things begin to remember. He begin to remember where he came from. He had he he was finding his identity. He'd been shell sharked like a lot of people had been shell sharked by sin. They have forgot what God ordained them to be. And here he was. He's looking at that water tower. One state, he doesn't know who he is. But one glance at the water tower, one glance at the smitten rock and it starts leading him back home. I say young people, I said no matter how far you went in God or how far you went away out in sin, if you can just take a look at this smitten rock and start looking and find out that your identity is not in the games of the world. It is not in the things of this layan age, but your identity is in the gene seed of almighty God that he placed on the inside of you before the foundation of the world before you could ever make a wrong mistake, before you can make a right choice. You are back now. &gt;&gt; Now go believe him with all your heart and you get well in Jesus Christ's name. Your sins are forgiven. Now watch a prophet. Now I didn't say it. I didn't say your sins are forgiven. He said that. It wasn't me. It was him. &gt;&gt; I don't want to hear a man say I'm forgiven. But I want to hear the father &gt;&gt; again. And he would say, "Now sin cannot be covered by drinking, by casting it aside, by joining a church, by trying to do better. Sin can only be killed by the power of God, the blood of Jesus Christ." Wouldn't you want a life like that? If you would, you believe God is in the building. His never failing presence is always near, no matter where you go. &gt;&gt; It doesn't even matter what your last name is. That's right. &gt;&gt; There's grace for you. You remember the prophet had a son by the name of Billy Paul. Billy Paul was a young man. Brother Brandham come home from some meetings one time and he saw Billy out there and he was struggling. He got hanging out with the wrong crowd and he got smoking cigarettes. Brother Brandham called to him and said, "Billy, you doing all right?" She had to add them all doing okay. He said, "Billy, you know you're lying to me. He's you smoking them cigarettes. He said he said, "Daddy, I won't do it no more. I won't do it no more." Brother Brandham said he still kept on doing it. Brother Brandham said, "I I had a vision." And he said, "Billy Paul in this vision was just falling, falling, falling, and falling." He said, "I was screaming to him." And he wouldn't wake up. He wouldn't come to himself. He wouldn't do anything. He just kept falling and falling and falling. A little while later, Billy Paul was out playing. He got out there and he fell into some water and he got pneumonia. And the doctor give him a shot. And the doctor come to Brother Brandham said, "Brother Brandham said, I've killed your boy. I killed your boy." He said, he said, "Don't tell me that." He said, "I've been through so much. God, don't don't take my son. God, if there's still grace for Billy, God, would you turn this around?" He said, "And all of a sudden, a vision fell before my eyes." And he said there I saw Billy Paul falling falling kept falling. He kept falling. He said but the difference in this vision and that vision. He said in this vision there was two hands that come underneath of Billy Paul and it raised him back up. And he said before long I heard him saying daddy daddy daddy you see the difference between your fall and this side of glory is a new birth. Hallelujah. And this side of it, you are not identified with the one that has fallen, but you're identified with the God that is raising you back up. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Convinced and concerned. He said the identity of the gospel being identified in you is when you see that you have passed from death unto life and become a new creature in Christ Jesus. That's the identity of the Holy Spirit when you pass from death unto life. So literally is where your identity is. That's the identity of the Holy Spirit is when you pass over Jordan, Sister Seb, it's when you pass, you know, now I I go overseas a little bit and I go to different countries and I'm carrying I'm carrying a a pack of an an identity card that wherever I go and and whenever I travel internationally now inside of the states, all I got to do is carry a little identity card that you get from DMV. has my driver's license. It's got a picture of me, but the picture is not of me as an old man, but it's a picture as of I am right now. It's not a picture of me when I was a little bitty child. It's a picture of me right now. Now, when I carry that passport, it's also got a picture in there. But this is there's a difference is is that this has been identified by the United States of America and it packs a seal of the United States upon it. And when I carry that passport with me and I'm going it it that passport is giving me of the ability to be able to go into new territories of where I've never been before. All because of this identity card and the seal of my government. It has given me access to be able to go into new territories. And when I get back to that border or to that customs agent, I can just simply show him my identity. He looks at my identity card and he looks at me and said, "You got to pass. You can come on through." You see, the difference between you and being able to walk into the kingdom of God is a seal of God's approval upon your life of the new birth. And when that new birth is there, you have the abilities to step into new territories and walk into a new land. your new birth. &gt;&gt; The reason why the reason why so many people struggle to express themsel in the land of the Holy Ghost is because they never found an altar. They have never found their way weeping their way back to Christ. Too many times people, they stay on the outside of a born-again experience and they come to church, they go to church, they read one scripture a day, and they stay the same way they ever was before. &gt;&gt; But that ain't my story. &gt;&gt; Now, if that's your story, there's a God that's still got the pen in his hand. &gt;&gt; The difference between me and you is I let God have the pen back. Hallelujah. I let him have the pen back because I was trying to write out my story, but God said, "No, I got something different for you. &gt;&gt; You are either going to let yourself write your own story and go to a devil's hell &gt;&gt; or you're going to let God write your story. Hey, that's rough. No, I love you. &gt;&gt; I love you. I really do. Cuz I remember being right there, young man. I remember being right there. I had the world by the tail like a tiger, man. I had it. I Man, I wore my Superman shirt, bro. I I was glad about it. I was glad to wear it. I thought I was invincible. Me and Sister Mary and a few other of us here, we thought we was invincible. We did all kinds of stupid stuff. You know why? Cuz I stupid. The difference between me now and then, there's still a little bit of that stupidity there. But there's a new birth to make sure I don't do them stupid things. &gt;&gt; I ain't some great man. I don't have a great education. I don't have a I don't have a whole lot of money like the rest of the world does. But the major difference between me and Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and the Pope and Putin is I got something that the world can't have. I got something that changed my life. I got something that when I was in that trash bin and I was looking for when I was looking for potato chips. God said, "That's not your story. Give me the pen back. Give me the pen back. Give me the pen back." And I was like Jacob. I was wrestling it out. Why? Because the old man didn't want to die. But all of a sudden, I said, "I'm not going to let you go until you bless me &gt;&gt; and it was noised." He was in the house. I'll be honest. I I wouldn't have known this unless I just done it. But I have preached over 700 sermons in 15 years. Only reason I know that is because I was messing around on my computer trying to move from one program to the next program and it said this is going to be a while. Just be thankful. I don't preach everything I have on my notes. &gt;&gt; There's a difference between me and a lot of preachers. I know when to stop because if you don't stop at the right time, baby, you are buying it back. Kind of like that farmer one time. Come in, sit down at church. Preacher kept on preaching. He just going away, going away. And all of a sudden, a farmer stands up. He said, 'Where are you going? He said, 'I got to go mow my hay. He said, ' Man, you should have done that before you come to church. He said, I didn't have to before church. That joker don't preach too long. God don't ever let me have that kind of reputation. &gt;&gt; But in 700 sermons, I'll give you my notes. I'll give you all my script. I'll give you all my scriptures and sermons. I'll give them to you. But none of them can preach as loud as your life. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; The reason is is because you decided to tear the roof off. &gt;&gt; You decided, you made up a decision in your mind. This message works. I'm going to live true to this message. I'm going I'm going to let it change my family. I'm going to let it change my life. I'm going to let it wash me. I'm going to let it make me new. I'm going to let it make me new be a new husband. I didn't know how to be a husband. I didn't know how to be a daddy. But the message taught me how. &gt;&gt; You know why? I watched it in my father and I watched it in my grandfather. Where did they get that from? The message. &gt;&gt; How'd you learn to be a business partner, a businessman? I learned it from the message. I put God first. I paid my tithe. I learned it from the message. &gt;&gt; Where'd you learn to be a friend at? I learned it from the message. &gt;&gt; I just decided that I got to tear the roof off &gt;&gt; because I don't just need him every once in a while. &gt;&gt; And I don't just need him just on a Saturday night and a Sunday. I figured out a long time ago that I need Jesus because without Jesus, I am an old I'm an old wretched man. But give me Jesus. I'll tear the roof off and paralytics will walk. The deaf will hear. The blind will see. The dumb will speak. Take this whole world. &gt;&gt; But let me tear the roof off. &gt;&gt; Now, this is the teacher of teachers. There's been Elijah. There's been Moses. There's been great prophets, major prophets, and minor prophets. But the Bible recorded that no man ever spake like this man, that even the winds and the waves obey him. So, we ought to pay close attention to what he's saying. Now, he's got something powerful about his voice because he has the ability to preach to five to 6,000 and set it out on such a panoramic that 5,000 people will start noising what Jesus is saying about the biatitudes. There's something special about his words and the way he says it. So, when he speaks, you begin to listen to him. I don't know if Jesus was sitting down crisscross or if he's sitting down at the table, sitting in a chair that many philosophers think that Jesus was the one that created the table. I don't know how he was sitting, but the prophet would say it. He said, "There he was." He said he was sitting there and he was teaching them the word. He said, "And all of a sudden the dust started to fall around him while he was teaching the word." You'd imagine he's created this dust, but there's something different about this. It's not from the ground. It's coming from above. And it actually stops Jesus in his tracks. It captures his attention. That's the kind of faith that this bride has that she has captured the anointed one's attention. There were four people that loved this boy. They'd watched Jesus heal the leper. They watched Jesus do mighty things. And Jesus is teaching. And Jesus is breathing. And Jesus is speaking. And Jesus has profound ways. And just about that time, somebody tears the shingles off. Now, you can either be identified with I've never walked before. You can either be identified as I got a little bit of shake in my hands. I got the pausy and I just can't live it right. And I I don't know if I can I don't know if I can really live this message or you can be identified as coming through the roof. I wonder what would happen today if all of a sudden the drywall started cracking and dust from the shingles and the gravel from it and the plywood and the splinter start coming off and all of a sudden there's four people standing on top of the roof and they're looking down on the Son of Man and all of a sudden they start lowering down their faith and they put their faith on the line and they put their friend right there where Jesus Jesus is now. You can be identified with somebody that's in the bed and stays in the bed. &gt;&gt; You can be identified as laying there in your sickness because sickness is a vehicle, &gt;&gt; but it needs somebody to drive it. Spirits are a vehicle. They need somebody to drive it. And so they're looking for somebody that they could work their way into. How how they get in this building today is because somebody allowed a spirit to get here. Now, it's either God's spirit or it's an evil spirit. Brother Brandon would teach us about cancer. That cancer, he said it's simply just a a demon spirit. He said it's a spirit in a form. He said, "Then it goes to a bruise cell and then it takes on that form because it needs a body that it can work through. It simply needs the ability to be able to work in that body. But this man had somebody that cared enough for him even when he couldn't get to Jesus. when your prodals can't get to Jesus. There was somebody that listened to a token message and said, "You take that token and you apply it to by your faith upon your lost son and your lost daughter and you bring them back in." &gt;&gt; This Pauly had found a body, but this Pauly was getting ready to lose its vehicle. Hallelujah. I'd be an upset human being, brother Chris. If I done drove my Corvette to church and man, it was looking fine out there and I get out there and somebody done took that rascal. &gt;&gt; I'd say it's them kind of service right now today. Satan, do you hear me? &gt;&gt; You are losing the keys to your car. You are losing the keys to my mind. You are losing the key to my business. You are losing your key to my body. You are losing your key. You will not drive me from this place and that place. You will not drive me from fear to failure. You will not drive me from mistake to mistake. But I'm going to drive you right to the blood of Jesus Christ. I say get out of my car. Get out of my car. Get out. Hallelujah. It's an old song. It's an old song. Say, it says, "Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't." You know what I'm talking about, sister Seb? Maybe one day I we'll sing it together. Says, "Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it." Then it goes on says, "Don't let the devil dry. You let him dry. He'll ruin your life. Don't do it. [Applause] I think you could do it a whole lot better than me, sis. Tell that devil, you taking the keys back. Tell that devil, you can't have my mind. You can't have my breakthrough. You can't have my body. You can't have my spirit. You can't have my joy. You can't have it. You can't have it. You can't have I tell you this. The devil thought he had me, but I got away from him. I got away. Now, Samson's got a powerful story. Samson Samson was known by his supernatural strength. He was s he was known by an extraordinary strength that was tied to his Nazerite vow. He was known for his feats of power and his feats of h of defeating conflicts of of the Philistines and conflicts with himself and he had conflicts with Delilah. But that was not his story. The final act of Samson's life is where he's identified at. You can look at his story and you can see all the faults. But then you could see the greatest victory came when he died to himself. When he is standing there, his identity came at the breakthrough of the threshing meal. Hannah, Hannah, do you hear me? Do you hear me? You are either going to be known or identified by baroness, by persecution, by mockery and bitterness, or you're going to give birth to a miracle. &gt;&gt; Blind Barameus, do you hear me? You are either going to be identified as a blind man that was led around by a dove and led a lamb by led around by a lamb, or you're going to be identified as a man that decided today is the day. &gt;&gt; I'm going to scream out. I'm going to give my all. I'm going to press through. I'm not going to be identified as a blind man no more, but I'm going be identified as a man that saw Jesus with my very own eyes that he touched. &gt;&gt; Walls of Jericho that I built up in my own mind. &gt;&gt; Do you hear me? Do you hear me? You're not going to be my identity. &gt;&gt; If these walls could talk, there's a reason why I'm on the outside. But just give me a moment with my Jehovah Savior. &gt;&gt; And these walls won't be my identity much longer. You see, I got a cord hanging on the outside of these walls. And that's my identity. I once was no good. I once was a failure. I once let men into my life that robbed me and cheated me and steal from me and did all kind and they abused me. Amen. &gt;&gt; If these walls could talk, &gt;&gt; when you study Jewish tradition, you will find the reason why Rahab is in this condition is because of her mama and because of her daddy. They sold her into this Now, I don't have to have a raise of hands here, but I know some of you have been abused by your mom, &gt;&gt; mentally, physically. I know some of you have been abused by your dad and other people in your life. &gt;&gt; But this message is not holding that over you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This message gives you access to grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, they did you wrong. Yeah, they hurt you. Yeah, they said wrong things. Yeah, they sold you into sin. But this is not a message of disgrace. &gt;&gt; It's a message of grace. &gt;&gt; I find it so amazing that the very first people that Rahab wants in her house is her mama and her daddy. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can either be broken by your past and let that be your identity. &gt;&gt; Or you can allow the master &gt;&gt; to mold the clay in such a way &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; They said, "God, they did me wrong, but I don't want them to miss the rapture." &gt;&gt; What kind of breakthrough did Joshua give to her? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Dryness. Do you hear me? I ain't seen a raindrop in three and a half years. The only time I ever felt any refreshing was cuz a little be a women widow woman up there. was decided she was going to take care of me. But do you hear me, Donus? Today, my spirit's going to be refreshed. Today, I'm coming to a position where I'm going to be refreshed. Dryness, do you hear me? I don't see any signs of a pouring out of the Holy Spirit yet. But you will not be my identity. that there was not enough water to go around. But do you hear me? I'mma pray. I'mma pray. No way. It's still dry in this air. No. I'mma pray. I'mma pray. No. No. No. It stay right there. They ain't came back to the house of God yet, so I'm going to pray again. They ain't forgave me yet, so I'm going to pray again. I I haven't felt the anointing yet, but I'm I'm going to pray again. I I ain't felt my breakthrough yet, so I'm I'm going to pray again. You know what? I I feel like I'm turning a corner, though. I feel like I'm I I feel like I'm I feel like I'm getting ready to see something manifest, but I'm going to pray again. Even though I feel like it's coming, even though I I know it's close, I'm going to pray again. I'm I'm going to press through. I'm going I'm going to pray even though I don't feel like praying. I my knees are hurting. I don't I don't even have enough strength to climb the heel. I I got to send other people up there to even go up there to Full Gospel Lighthouse and tell me whether God's real or God's not. And and I I I just I got to pray. Ahab, get down there because I see a cloud like the size of a man's hand. &gt;&gt; Why? Because Elijah decided to press through. [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The law won't hold me back no longer. Fear won't hold me back no longer. Circumstances won't hold me back no longer. My money that I've wasted won't hold me back no longer. I got to get to Jesus. He's the only hope that I have left. I wonder how many people heard Homer Frazzia preach and they didn't get to Jesus. I wonder how many people heard Ron Spencer preach and they didn't get to Jesus. I wonder how many people have heard these fine brothers minister &gt;&gt; and they didn't get to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Don't let that be your story. She's 12 years old. She's about to die. But I got to get to him. I got these priestly robes on. But I got to get to him. I'm probably going to get kicked out of the denominations cuz if I if I go there, if I get close to him, if I draw near to him, they're going to identify me with him. But I got to get to him. I wonder what really is holding you back. &gt;&gt; I wonder what's really Is it the fear factor? of what other people think about you. Or is it really you? &gt;&gt; Obviously with Darius, it was not what other people thought of him. But you see, he doesn't give it up. And he had a man come to him said, "Don't trouble the master no more. She's done dead." And I got a powerful quote I want to read to you right here. Now watch, watch what brother Brandham says here. He said, "Now, but in that Lord Jesus, he was possessed with a power that went beyond earthbound limitations. He walked over that cold, still formed dead girl." Now Jarius don't care what people say. &gt;&gt; He's done shed his priestly groves. He don't care what the crowd said about him. He doesn't even care what the messenger said about his girl. &gt;&gt; He's walking with a master. &gt;&gt; He walked over there to that cold still form of a dead girl. Oh, hallelujah. And he took her by the hand and he looked around and said, "Where is everybody?" They're outside making fun, criticizing everything. He was possessed with the power that he could speak into another world. And he began to speak in tongues and said talikumi that his soul returned back to this little girl. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now there's getting ready to be a change. I don't know her name, but Jarius did. And I don't know your prodal's name, but you do. But the difference is that the master knows &gt;&gt; and the master has come into this room to bring them back to life. &gt;&gt; And I want you to know the master is here. He is here in power and in demonstration to make sure that you get up out of your deadness because he's come here today to quicken you to get you out of your stuper to get you out of your ideas of you can't go no more and you can't go on this way and I I don't know if I can go or not but I want to so I want to Hallelujah. I want to give this to you church. He said he gave that same power to his church. Now lay your hands over on one another. Shamgar, Samson, Hannah, Elijah, blind Barnameus, Jarius, Zenian woman. He laid his hand over on that dead body and said, "So, return back to hear this little girl." Hallelujah. He gave that same power to his church. That when you're forsaken and downcast, God give us a language to speak out into another world. That when Jesus was forsaken on the cross and all man had forsaken him, he died speaking in another language. My God, why hast thou forsaken me? And the church tonight is possessed with that kind of a power. You have the power to lay your hands on the sick and they shall recover. There are people that come to church that don't even want to come to church. There are people that love coming to church. There are people that have needs. There are people that love the Lord and they still need a touch from the master and it's been noised abroad this morning that he's in the house. Won't you let the master touch you? I wonder what you're going to tear off this morning. I wonder what's in your way. I wonder what's really holding you back. A lot of people it's sports. A lot of people it's their ideas. A lot of people it's what they want to do. I'm not the man that makes up what the shingle is. You know what the shingle is. But I want to remind you about a man of God that came here two years ago and preached on a sermon called tile wreckers. You're either going to be a tie wrecker. You're going to be identified as somebody that breaks through. Or you're going to be identified with somebody that didn't have the courage to get up and come to an altar and make things right. Do you realize his presence is here to change your identity? Father, these children have their hands laid over on your masterpieces that you created. They are here. They have desired that you would come and manifest your glory to them. And Lord Jesus, I invite you just now to come and manifest your ways through your people. Lord God, we can see the limbs as they begin to struggle and they begin to they begin to have life come to them and they begin to bow in the wind. What is it? The earth is groaning and it's testifying to us that there is a people that is on the edge of a breakthrough of a rapture. But almighty God, may you come and break in through this room just now. And may you just push us past our fears. Lord, I pray that you would just come in a supernatural way and you would charge us. Lord, I pray that today as we begin to unite our faith, our hands are laid over on one another. I pray God that you would take control of this body of believers and you would begin to manifest your glory right here, right now, oh God. And that we would tear off the roof and you would begin to lower us into a position that we would see the son of man with his hand looking upon us saying, "Rise up and walk." So, Father, I pray this blessing over your people today that they would rise to walk in a newness of life. &gt;&gt; And may the Father rejoice that there was somebody that got up out of their bed. &gt;&gt; Father, I pray God that all of the heavens would begin to rejoice because one sinner begin to repent and begin to turn back to you, Father. Lord Jesus, our eternity can be defined by this moment in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Let the musicians come. I won't be stopped by walls. I won't be stopped by crowds. I won't be stopped by silence. And I won't be stopped by shame. I see giant killers out here. &gt;&gt; Now, parents, you can either keep them back there on the backside hurting sheep or you can let them go. I say every one of these young people deserve a rock. &gt;&gt; Let's give them a rock. &gt;&gt; Let's give them a rock. &gt;&gt; I see some Davids out there that deserve a rock. Let's give them a rock. I don't know whether you can accept it or not, but these young people one day in their life are going to be known as giant killers. That's right. &gt;&gt; Whether you accept it or not, I choose to believe that on the inside of these boys is giant killers, is serpent bruisers. I choose to believe that if people will walk away from this message that God's got people that'll stand right here. Let's give them a rock. Let's give them a rock. &gt;&gt; Now you've been practicing. &gt;&gt; You've been practicing. been back there and he killed a line. He killed that besetting sin. &gt;&gt; He killed the fear of being in front of people. &gt;&gt; Now it's time for a public show. &gt;&gt; You've been reading the Bible. You've been listening to the tapes. And now it's time. I won't give you a rock. Now, before you ever got in this valley, them rocks was already there. Before Goliath ever come down off of his side of the hill, them rocks was already there. Before Saul made a choice he wasn't going down there, them rocks was already there. What made the difference in David and the rest of them was his identity was known as picking up a rock. There's a lot of people that have chose not to pick up this rock and to sling it at the devil. But I want to give you the courage to know &gt;&gt; that if you can pick up this rock, &gt;&gt; it'll kill every Goliath. It'll kill every giant. It'll kill every spirit. It'll kill every anxiety. It'll kill depression. It'll kill. It'll kill. It'll kill. But I want to ask you a question. Do you have the courage? [Applause] Do you have the courage to grab this rock? [Music] It just comes to my mind just now. Believe it's Colonel Travis in the Alamo. [Music] And he's got the he's got the army on the outside, but he's got an army on the inside. And he looks at him. Boys, it's a good chance we're going to die right here today. If you're you're free to go if you want to. We got the whole Mexican army out there coming down on us. He said, "But you that want to stay with this army, I'm going to draw a line in the sand. And you that come on this side of it will show me that you're willing to fight with me." [Music] Young people, Full Gospel Lighthouse, I draw a line in the sand this morning. [Music] Who's on the Lord's side? [Music] God. Oh my hearts are mened. Oh with the presence. [Music] Oh the king.
