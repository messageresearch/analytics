don't know he might be the colonel of the military next year or something but he's just got a brand new job it's a dream job for him he's an investigator now for the state police and uh god i mean you

there's just phenomenal benefits that just goes with it i he's never failed me i i i'll never have to i have to say this he's never failed me amen i'm proud of this message i love this message i love the lord jesus that's among us and and you know i think brother branham would be really proud to come to this church and preach here and just take a little time tell us some stories and amen well maybe one of these days during the resurrection we'll just have have him to do that and so you think that'd be all right amen i don't know if we'll be on his list to see but wouldn't that be nice and so amen god bless you if you'll turn with me to hebrews chapter 11 verse 33 got a lot of nice text after the service last night thank you guys for that from a lot of different places and i was just nuts and bolts preaching we're going to be part of the this this great orchestra and god's getting us ready and we're going to go through some things to get there and uh and so we're just we're just thankful for this before reading this i just want to share this thought i cannot imagine the responsibility of paul with a few sentences telling life stories of these people they were born in the rhythm of the music and regardless of the backdrop of their lives they overcome paul didn't get to call our names but our names are written here i want to read it again for you hebrews 11 33 who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stop the mouths of lions quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword and out of weaknesses were made strong wax valiant in flight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection thinking in there to come after this writing 68 million christians give their life for the cause of jesus christ due to rome others had trial of cruel mockings scourgings yea moreover the bond of imprisonments they were stoned they were sown asunder were tempted were slain with the sword wondered about in sheepskins and in goat skins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and dens and caves of the earth and these all haven't obtained a good report through faith received not the promise god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect chapter 12 verse 1 wherefore see and we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us and here is the whole is the whole thing looking unto jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy was set before him endured the cross despising the shame that is set down at the right hand of the throne of god may the lord bless the reading of his word this morning you may be seated brother branham is speaking in shalom and he's talking about symphony he says now to you adults the scripture is god's symphony he said only the composer knows what it really means and he reveals it to those who are listening i want to be one of those don't you who are interested in knowing what the drama is but you'd have to know about the symphony first it's not just something that you see it's the changing the junctions of the word of the music it throws sometimes it's going to go this way for a while a certain beat after a while it changes all around what is it to you that who wouldn't understand it or don't know nothing about it and not interested in it it's just a racket it's a fuss but to those who know about it they're watching for it they know it's coming hallelujah that's where we're at we we know it's coming so we have these times of symphonies of the symphony of god's word that the whole drama changes and you who are interested listen for that change you know it's getting close you hear the way the drums are obedient amen want something to happen you know this is a change see it's going to break into a burst in a few moments and he said and you're watching for that you can tell that the way the drums are timing brother brahm did believe in drums oh god if you can hear the drums of the finish now if you can hear the echo of the music of the heavenly word singing itself out and it shall come to pass in the last days the symphony of god's great drama that he's playing it changes him the symphony at the junction the composer and those who are interested listen for that change and that's what all of this stuff is to us we're listening we're watching and i think about when i read this quote many people that were sitting there just allowed this to just kind of go right over their heads they missed the whole thing they really wasn't interested in the word they were interested in the gift maybe the interested in the personality of the man but there was a voice that was behind the voice we have been gathered to a message come out of her my people and be not a partaker with the plagues don't be caught up with those blasphemous names and the creeds and dogmas but we've been gathered to a message and we're just have to be honest with you we're interested in it it's what my life's goal has been i'm interested in this message every time you appears something happens we see the time getting close we see back yonder long again ago when the church ages was all darked out he said we were listening we sing the one right when the with the word the beating with the word and after a while what happened here he come himself and vindicated we heard the word say so in the days of the sabbath angel the church ages he said the seventh angel's message would be the last message and all we find out over here in revelations 10 in the in the days of the message of the sabbath angel the mystery of god should be finished and they are we're not looking for another messenger we're not looking for another great man are you with me and the seventh seal would be pulled back it should be there then all at once when it's happening a vision broke go to tucson a great noise will take place at this time and you'll be thoroughly understand and know that it's sent brother branham has taken these junctions of his life and showing us revelations 10 1 revelations 10 7 luke 17 30. malachi 4 5-6 these scriptures are happening and let me just say never let that become redundant to you never let that become common to you centuries has waited on this to happen because we had to have a messenger that would get a gentile bride ready we had had the bible for 2 000 years at least in the form that we have now at least since about martin luther and zwingli and some of those men that began to get the met the bible together but listen we had the bible what what did it produce over 40 000 denominations we needed a messenger are you with me not one that was going to boast of himself but we needed a messenger that could stand in this day and declare the word of god without guests without guests he was a seer prophet he was like an old testament prophet that could see all the way back even before the beginning when he talks about adam and eve and her blonde hair and and his right shoulders and god sending them out of the garden and then he calls them back and he takes lambskins and wraps it around it that was a messenger with vision form to be able to stand in a pulpit and watch it happen he wasn't guessing at it he was watching it happen but listen he wasn't just talking about adam and eve he's talking about you too he watches melchizedek with with abraham he watches abraham and jehovah jireh take his son upon a hill and and he said god will provide himself a lamb he would scream to us as the changes would be coming stay with me as i lay my foundation this morning change is coming just throw it to it and he would remind us even as believers don't miss it why would he tell us don't miss it because the cares of this life will delude it misdirect you cause you to go in different directions but keep your focus on the word it would be just like eloheeser that would would pick would the angel would give rebecca the revelation drop it in her heart i'll go with the man i'll go with this message and she waters the camels that she rides on but ellie heezer she was not to fall in love with eleazar was giving her secrets about what isaac was like brother branham did not want us falling in love with wink and branham oh it's sure to good to fall in love with him but his purpose was to get you to fall in love with the lord jesus christ he constantly told us i'm not your healer i'm not your savior i'm not your deliverer i needed i needed saving i needed healing as people we quickly fall in love with humanity and if you're not careful you'll fall in love with temporary flesh that is going to die and go back to the ground but god the mighty angel came to oversee this message and listen that angel did not leave the earth when the messenger left the earth he is among us even now i'd like to say this to you we have lived long enough to see this message in every corner of the earth [Music] so i would say this to us be ready be ready let's play our part brother man would say these statements he said that's the way that you do god he said you don't stand off and look at it you get into the rhythm of it how do you get in there you're born into it into the rhythm of the word when you become part of the word you had to become part of the dance to get to the dance you have to become part of the ball game something that you're interested in to get into the ball game brother brown would say later in another sermon getting in the spirit getting in the spirit a lot of people pray but they really don't pray a lot of people read the bible but they really don't read the bible a lot of people worship but they really don't worship you got to get in the spirit of it hallelujah that's what we come this morning for not to just do another service we come to get in the spirit this is my part i'm going to play my part now this is a very important quote i know i'm laying some heavy stuff for you but you just hang right here he said you have to become part of the word to know god's symphony you cannot become part of the word if you don't eat it i'm just going to be honest with you if tapes are never played in your home if it can be said about your house that the voice of the prophet is never there there's something wrong with your revelation young people play it in your bedrooms because you're part of the symphony there's a good chance that you're not going to live to be 50 years old this is your time this is your message listen listen i live this every day in our home growing up it didn't hurt me it didn't hurt me the strongest things that brother branham said it didn't hurt me oh brother ron i want my children to have a good time are you looking at the temporary are you looking at the pyramid eternal i'm not telling you to listen to it 24 hours a day but i'm telling you you got to feed you got to feed on the word you got to listen to the word brother on but i can't read no more my eyes have got too bad there's there's there's bible we listen to the to the bible all the way to church today sister connie's got a program we listened all the way to church i got a program i listen to the scriptures some words i can't say i enjoy listening to the word of god it's got power in it the word is a seed and it has the potential to release it's got power in it and the and the sheep music of god's word is the word of god are you with me now and he says you have to become part of the word to know god's symphony his symphony is when it's playing you understand amen i caught something there just a moment ago let me just share this with you you can feed on every kind of political news that there is that's satan's kingdom and at the end of the the programs or whatever you're it agitates you the reason it agitates you you're not from this world i'm gonna preach this is not your world this world is only gonna get worse your vote don't even count no more you might as well get it through your head but this is not our world this message is our world now notice this you're watching for it he said the works that i do shall you do also greater than this shall you do these last days the great changing of time we get into the beat the beat of the word find his purpose the hour that we're living it is useless to find luther's day it was a great revival it was a tremendous overcoming it was the writing of the bible and in the background of that luther had to live in persecution and literally had to be under a german king or they would have killed him the pressure that he was under as a messenger but there was a lot of flaws in his life are you with me now wesley what a great revival he was cast out of all of the churches but he stood there in the streets and in the fields one occasion 10 000 people slain in the spirit someone told me a while back said that god don't slay people in this spirit no more well you god don't change and john wesley this before azusa street john wesley is preaching to 10 000 people and they all are slain in the spirit and he don't understand because the power of the message of that day of that orchestra was playing so strong and it had such a rhythm to it and the people were anointed to catch the word they were literally slain in the spirit and he tried to get them to set up and listen to the word i pray today the word has incredible effect on our lives remember when feni would preach feeney was a converted lawyer he was ashamed of receiving the holy ghost he was out praying for the holy ghost behind his office two women passed by and he stood up and he realized that i'm ashamed and he broke through the shame and he received the baptism of the holy ghost and when he began to preach he was not a pretty man as a matter of fact his he had a nasally voice it really shrieked when he spoke but he preached with such power until men would drop their lunch boxes five miles away and give their heart to jesus christ rochester new york became a place to where crime was so low until the police officers became the original barbershop quartets that's what the power of the gospel can do [Music] brother ron i don't know about that we're going to a kingdom there'll be no police officers you'll be out of a job there'll be no police officers there there'll be no warriors there there'll be no funeral homes there there'll not be one hospital there no walmart's there just think about all the things that won't be there hallelujah there'll never be a fight or a brawl or a fuss we get so consumed in our time element everything's got to be right on time every everything has got to be just right on time and you know you just you know you're just so busy and that's what the devil will do he'll get you so busy he'll rob you he'll rob you of your time and sometimes it's over trivial things sometimes you'll give you a whole week of things to gossip about get it today get it tomorrow if the devil can just drop a little rumor and we can just drop a little rumor it'll consume your mind and your thoughts and your thoughts will be on all of this you guys are getting ready to go to college and so the devil will tell you yeah you ain't gonna be able to function away from home you're not gonna have your mom and daddy around you to watch over you and protect you and this is gonna be a whole lot different than than high school yeah well that's that's silly that's absolutely correct it's correct but you got a goal that you want to go through somewhere you want to be a teacher i think that's what both of you guys want to be so you got to go through the work to be a teacher so you got to get it i'm going to preach to you you got to get it in your mind i got to get through this i may not like it i may have some difficult times but i'm going to get through this i am committed to this if you're a nurse you're a doctor whatever you are in your life here's a guy that sits with a pre-med degree listen there was times he felt like quitting but let me just say this you he had to talk to himself over and over to get himself through did he make all these i'm sure he didn't he's in my family but to play your part now let's just suppose for a moment that your part in the symphony is to play the trumpet you're not the star of the show you're just part of the music and so the script is given to you and the script is there in front of you and you play that and you play it and you play it and you play it you probably won't get it right the first many times but once you get yourself out of the way once you get your personality out of the trumpet [Music] and just play what's on the sheet music and you're not sitting there with the pen in your pocket going i'm not going to play that part and i don't like that part and i don't like that part i believe it ought to be let me just say this just play it how it is just play corinthians how it is just play galatians how it is just play the book of revelations how it is god wrote it we're his children and we believe it just how it is i'm not here to argue with it i'm here to believe it i don't even have to understand it it's not up for me to understand [Applause] it's way above my pay grade to rewrite it now he's one person whether it's in his bedroom or in his living room or sitting on the front porch and he's sitting there playing and he's listening to what he's playing maybe he can youtube how it's supposed to sound and to mimic it perfectly because when he gets in front of the director the director is under the inspiration of the composer and the composer wants it a certain way it's not up for negotiation here he wants it a certain way a lot of people want to argue with our prophet but let me just say this to you your argument is much higher than our prophet and so and so the director gets under the inspiration of the composer and so he gathers people that can play the park i know some backgrounds of some of these things and so there are people that will come that will audition for the part i did some reading here and the people that say it ought to be played another way they are immediately scratched off [Music] and the people that put themselves in the part they're scratched off because what we're to do is when there's 25 000 people sitting with paying tickets many of them sitting in tuxedos and fine dresses and they paid a lot of money they're wanting to hear beethoven life written hundreds of years ago but beethoven believed that my my my lyrics will will go into eternity listen this message will go into eternity [Music] beethoven's probably won't but this message will go into eternity we'll stand one of these days as overcomers of laodicea were living vessels that played the park as a minister we're not to put our personality over this word we're not to put our thoughts over this word we're not to put our opinion over this word because remember remember brother branham met an angel in a cave sister connie he was the only man of this dispensation of many dispensations that could say i met an angel in a cave and preached sermons like how the angel came to me hundreds of ministers sitting around him none of them had that testimony are you with me and brother branham would stand there it didn't matter whether they believed it or not i want you to understand when we come to this message it don't matter whether people believe it or not i'm not i'm not here to try to convince the unbeliever or the fake believer the pretend believer i i'm not here to convince them i'm not trying to get goats to be bred into sheep wolves we have no interest in them we're just getting the bride ready to play the final part because we are the final voice to the final age and we have a message to play we've got sheep music to play are you with me brother branham would go beyond the curtain of time and see us as believers and we would tell him that we're resting on this message because he preached what paul preached and he preached what peter preached are you with me now those people were turned young again so we got a glimpse of heaven then we got a glimpse of hell i've sat in the parking lot where brother branham was sitting watching that woman come up over that escalator speaking in another language and with that hair doing with that coloring of her eyes if brother branham could see what we see today on a daily basis he he talked about how hell was blending its dimension if he could see that in 6465 what about today but he also had a vision of the bride bride from every nation listen there was the modern bride that came forth in her i don't even talk about her attire her bikini fig live situations literally porn situation what the church has produced are you with me now but he saw a bride come forth a bride out of every nation coming forth and he watched her at the end and he was so proud watching her at the end how she came back again and one kind of got out of step and he and he screamed to her get back in line get back in line that's why church is so important that's why the assembling of ourselves together is so important we're an encouragement to one another it's easy to sit in your bunny slippers and drink your coffee watch your favorite preacher from one segment to another segment but get yourself out of bed put your clothes on shake off every devil in hell and every backsliding spirit that you have to fight all week long get to church come with an attitude that i'm gonna get something from god i'm gonna play my part as a body of jesus christ i don't have to be a star i don't have to be a strong personality i just want to put my shoulder to the will let that freedom reign [Applause] amen now let's just take for a moment the backdrop behind brother branham here in america just in america we have a cuban missile crisis we have the vision of the youngest president to be elected a camelot of sorts jfk is elected it's almost a camelot that takes place and he stands at his inauguration said it's not what this country can do for you but what you can do for this country women given the right to vote vision's happening so rapidly now think about the spirits that are being released when brother branham is preaching some of these most incredible sermons the beatles come on the scene the beatles come on the scene and literally when they arrive in america there's such an anointing on them until people that are sick go and where they are getting off of the plane are healed thinking that the messiah has arrived the race rights was everywhere in america what you see today is the harvest of what brother branham was contesting with race was taking place let me just say something to you about race we're christians we're christians and we all came from the adamic race we are christians and if you are prejudiced here is an altar [Applause] malcolm x was on the scene and he was a militant part he came out wanting to fight wanting to kill wanting to do a lot of different things on the other side of that the flip of that was martin luther king who was a phenomenal speaker who was more polished in many of his ways who actually was a great visionary because he had a vision that one day that we could all live together that's not on this earth but there is coming a land there is coming a land and it won't be by political ramifications of getting things done it'll be by the blood of jesus christ [Applause] music begins to turn loose and i'm not going to go far with this but the bebop of the music begins to turn loose the 50s music turns loose many of you were involved in it elvis turns loose elvis is almost like a messiah on the scene and has an anointing he was his granddaddy's song leader in the tent meetings he was anointed even anointed with the holy ghost on his flesh and he could stand and preach seeing jailhouse rock and at the end of the concert sing amazing grace on the wings of a snow white dove he could sing some of these songs and bring audiences to their knees with conviction but he sold his birthright he sold his birthright you see all of this was hell open in itself revelations 9 hell opened itself that pit that smoke that was coming forth every spirit that was being loosed after the seals were revealed now today what you and i have as our backdrop is the harvest of all of the seeds or all of the spirits are coming forth because spirits don't live in trees they don't live in pulpits they don't live in your pews they live in human beings if you could look at the schools that we had when i was going to school if i could just give that witness i did not know what sodom and gomorrah was i heard it preached in the pulpit i did not know i definitely didn't have anybody in my school identifying themselves as a cat we sat in the airport the other day with a woman dressed completely head to toe as a cat and when they brought her food she put her mouth in her plate insanity and her family around her seemed like normal decent people somewhere they they take on a spirit prisons are full of people that were good people brother tom you were a guard brother jeremy you were a part of that system maybe some of you others were guards in those in those in those prisons they were good people in there can't even believe that i did such an atrocious thing but a spirit came on them and they killed her wife or they killed their children or they killed their buddy down the road they robbed a bank let me just tell you something personal when i worked at a grocery store that's where i started out i worked at a grocery store six and a half almost seven years i was a meat cutter when i married sister connie i really liked the job but god didn't want me to be a meat cutter all my life and so every person that we caught shoplifting had way more money in their pocket to pay for the items that they stole every one of them told us fred graham was one of the other guys that was a part of that and they would tell us something just got on me and i just took it we caught the mayor of the city shoplifted i know he did not need to do it we caught the judge's sons shoplifting and so they got all rattle boxed and began to swing and we gave them exactly what they were looking for i haven't always been a preacher and my daddy taught me one principle don't never start a fight but always end it i taught my boys the same principle and since the devil wants to pick a fight with us we might as well end it [Applause] now let me just say this to you all of this in our backdrop but the sheep music declares we will overcome did you hear me talk to you last night about all the things that you go through but god says at the end of it you're going to come forth like gold so always remember no matter what you go through and you can't see your way through it and everything that's going on around you remember god's in control you're in his orchestra just play the music at the end of it thousands of people are going to stand and say we made it [Applause] i just want to give you can i just do a little teaser work here brother branham comes to the pulpit and no doubt you know we're getting ready to have a labor day service here and we're expecting to be over capacity we're expecting to be really really full and but we're expecting a meeting of the ages that's our expectations and god has never he's he's never he's never let me down i just have to be honest with you he just he just don't let you down maybe you went to ball games and they let you down maybe you went to concerts and they let you down and maybe maybe you did different things in the world that lets you down but when you're dealing with god he'll never let you down people are going to come with expectation and brother branham's day he preached in much smaller churches than this and people would come and they'd wait for hours sometimes they'd sleep all night long in the parking lots and they would stand for hours waiting to get in the door now we don't have that problem here yeah you probably need to get here a little bit early but they didn't know what brother brown was going to preach to him where there was projected love or perfect love or or when love projects and brother branham stands and talks about bees when he's mowing comes up around him and i had such a love for them and i just began to talk to them and they just went back in the ground there's times i find myself wanting to have that kind of love this morning as i was being stung by a yellow jacket i had that i thought you know i wish i had that kind of love this is just one and if i can find your nest crossing the fence getting in the pen with a bull hey listen i was raised on a farm i know what a bad bull is a bad bull would take your life and to do it in a heartbeat it's one of our greatest fears with my dad because he would stumble a lot and he always kept a bull between twelve hundred and two thousand pounds he'd rub it on the head and give it grain every day and i visibly watched dad get tossed in the air and he was an elderly man i watched him get tossed in the air and he'd go back and rub that that bull's head but brother branham got in a field with a bull that had killed a man and that bull comes snorting and stomping and here it come and brother brown starts talking to him now what was happening was it's the same gift that happened in a prayer line and he would talk to people and he said now you know that there's something standing between you and i and and he would tell them said now you've had this condition and it came from this condition and your name is so and so your address is so and so and the doctors told you so and so now your daughter you've been praying for your daughter and this is her condition and this was her best friend this she's got a friend that's got this you see she did not know it she had stepped into the building and now she's a part of the orchestra and she's standing there with all kind of backdrop in her life and she's standing and the creator of heavens and earth is standing between her and it's this is more than a gift this is more than some kind of uh uh of of a what mentalist operation this was god himself saying i want to be in control of your life and they come into the prayer line one way and they walk out a complete different way i come to this service very much aware the angel lord is always here and i personally believe when this cancer purpose is over with he hasn't got enough strength to stay in this body and it'll be gone and evaporated in a moment our buddy brother tim prout said in the service of the wings of the snow white dove at the end of it i spoke to you last night that a service is more than just two weeks of study it's a lifetime and brother branham goes through a lifetime of the orchestra of his life and he comes down to the end of it brother jeff he starts singing a song on the wings of a snow white dove and in that service he writes a verse to it can you find that real quickly for me i'm getting i'm getting toward an end here i'll finish this next week have you enjoyed this so far today what a relaxed atmosphere that we've had you won't feel this at walmart that's one thing for sure now watch this though i have suffered in many a way i cried for healing both night and day faith wasn't forgotten by the father above he gave me his sign on the wings of a dog i haven't got permission from this but sitting about 30 feet as a little boy about 12 years old this they've taken him there just maybe to get a chance to get him prayed for and all those miracles happen god didn't forget that little boy now his family don't hardly recognize who he really is but he'll speak here saturday night of our labor day meeting and he's one of the best friends of my entire life if i ever needed a buddy i got one in tim pruitt god didn't forget him but he used that situation in his life he could never play ball or all of the different kind of things but god had a higher purpose than playing ball god raised him up to be one of the greatest preachers in all of history i'm not ashamed to say that i'm just proud to be his buddy from the backwoods of kentucky donny reagan came a nobody but god took a nobody listen if you're part of the orchestra god knows how to find you he knows where to get you our two boys that are preaching in ohio they've had one of the most phenomenal meetings timothy pruitt and andrew lee spencer you can't make those kind of things happen you can't make it happen satan's fought both of them boys with everything that he could fight them with and there's a backdrop behind them of pain and words that were said but they are playing their part in the orchestra and i would say they're doing real well can i can i just talk to you just a little bit more brother brain would come to the pulpit and he would talk about things that are to be and this is a service that is literally multiple visions that god is going to speak to his wife this is what it's going to be like it's not a chance it's not disney world this is not my wishes this is what it's going to be like this is what you're going to enjoy for eternity now there may have been a lot of people sitting in the services that were bored but there were some people there that was interested they were interested in the rhythm this this text is going to put me somewhere i very much am aware that as we get toward the rapture the moments we don't know the last day we don't have a day to waste but these texts these messages are put you in ready condition [Applause] and these are warm-ups now if you get there an hour so early at a at a at a symphony and believe it or not i've been in it and it sounds like the awfulest racket that you've ever heard in your give me a drumstick two of them and they're all warming up and it's literally almost blow your mind away and there's a guy that comes out there with a tuxedo one and he's you know he's for the for the ones that i've seen and even youtube i know you can't believe that but most of them got bushy hair they're just different sort of people but they know the music and they know who's been assembled and they know who's worked real privately and they know that they've accomplished and they're ready for this moment and now it's going to be okay i'm not going to be embarrassed we're ready we're ready the date is set we're ready and he steps up and he and everybody in the audience gets real quiet and there's a silence for a while everybody gets themselves set am i right everybody gets themselves set and they're not thinking about shopping they're not thinking about who's sitting beside of them actually at a spot to where it's me and music now i'm not going to play every part here now there's certain part of the scripture that i'm going to play there's certain parts of it i'm going to get to play but when it comes my turn i don't want to be off beat i don't want to be out of key and i don't want to put myself into it all of my training now is for this day and they begin to play and they play and they're listening over there and they're listening over there everybody's got a part to play everybody's got a part to play everybody not just one person can be the whole symphony everybody's got a part to play and everybody begins to play their part and they begin to do it on time and after a while it begins to build and that director he's using that stick as a reminder every motion has meaning to it every motion has meaning to it and these lyrics we're not changing them today we're playing them today because these lyrics will rapture you it'll change your body it'll call homer frazier out of the grave the voice of the resurrection is in the bride he won't come forth an old man with one leg he'll come forth a young man full of strength because this message works [Music] your loved ones will step from the grave even it's always back to the gases they'll step
